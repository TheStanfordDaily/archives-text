University broadcasting
used to be either some
thing no one had heard
about or wouldn't watch, if
avoidable.
So one group of innovative
thinkers decided that the un
cannily boring programming
needed an overhaul.
Their idea? "The Study
Break," a late night comedy
show in the vein of "David Let
terman" and "Saturday Night
Live."
"It'll be like a travelling

clown show," says senior
Joel Stein, the show's host.

The brainchild of sophomore Matt
Kulikowski, its producer, "The Study

Break" will feature pre-recorded skits, a
live-studio audience, guests and

spokesmodels.
According to Stein, the show plans to
seek out intriguing guests from the

Naked Guy to Rhodes scholars, to Molli,
a worker at the Contraceptive Center.
The show will include gimmicks such as

"Whine of the Week" — featuring com
mon student excuses — and Stein will
have a therapy session with someone

psychoanalyzing him each week.
"The Study Break" will be the first
product to air from the revamped XTV,

now called the Stanford Cardinal Broad
casting Network. As a coordinator, Ku
likowski began recruiting writers and

technicians, and ended up with a staff of
more than 50 people.
"We tried to choose the best minds on

campus," says Kulikowski. Many of the
writers have worked previously on the

Ram's Head production, "Gaities." And
sophomore Alex Wiesen, a music spe
cialist, will act as co-host much in the

same way as Paul Shaeffer does on the
Letterman show.
"He'll just be playing all the time,"

Stein says. "He'll be working on his
album while we do the show."
Stein, however, maintains that other

talents determined who would staff
"The Study Break":
"They chose me because I'm

good-looking. We chose people in the
same way that they choose yell-lead
ers. Talent isn't an issue—just looks."

With recordings tentatively
scheduled on Mondays, the producer
expects to attract a live audience

from the Stanford communi
ty to the Ricker Dining and
Performance Center "studio."
According to sophomore
Matt Kulikowski, the produc
er of the show, they will
choose viewers from dorms in
the order of which residences
granted support. So far,
Madera has first priority in
seating.

"I hope they come," voices
the more hesitant Stein. "On the other hand,
people will come see live what they could see on
TV. It's part of the American psyche. But we'll
probably only get three viewers on TV."

Kulikowski, who has a back

ground in video production

spanning from his early

a
high-school years,

has felt both

burdened

and

motivated by the project since its beginning.
The show has suffered particularly from techni
cal difficulties.
"A lot of the equipment we've been using is
getting old and needs repairs, but we've been
trying to do the best with what we have," says
Kalikowski. But the benefits outweigh the diffi
culties.
"It's the best way to prepare someone who
wants to get into this line of work," he adds. "It's
the only thing that could keep me doing all
nighters."
Senior Jeff Springer, head writer for the pro
ject and ex-head writer for Gaities — who com
plains of the abundance of writers and the lack
of technicians — describes the experience as
both "an adventure and an endless set of frus
trations.
"Unlike theater, writing for television has

the advantage that it doesn't have to be huge and
grandiose. It's something I haven't done before
and something I hope to do more of in the fu
ture."

Stein says he believes the show satisfies a
duty to the Stanford population which, ac
cording to his estimations, only watches an
average of three hours of television a week.
"It's an opportunity to watch televi
sion," Stein says."And I want to be able to

say that I've got my own television show. I can
give tapes to my parents."
Apart from creative difficulties, the show also
suffers from financial constraints. Although un-

derwritten and sponsored by outside
business, the team needs new equip
ment and could use their own studio,
according to Kulikowski.
"We haven't [won] our special
fee requests over the last couple of
years," he says.
"We are working on a serious
deal with American Airlines and
Tropicana. I also hope the Ye Olde
Safer Sex Shoppe takes out an ad on
the show." Stein adds.
Kulikowski, who has a long
term perspective, also hopes to es
tablish a closer relationship be
tween SCBN, the Stanford Drama
Department and the Communica
tions Department.
He is already concerned about

the prospects for SCBN in the future. "The
Study Break" will run until the end of the year,
but may have problems with the turnover of
students. Stein, a senior and a main part of the
show, will have to be replaced, eventually.
Solutions undoubtedly rely on the way Stan
ford viewers receive the"The Study Break." So
far, the program will appear along with the
Sports Division, and the mystery-drama series
"Cardinal Sins," also live broadcasts from
SCBN.
SUNet is available to the vast majority of
Stanford students, with hook-ups in all major
dorms and in all buildings within Campus
Drive. The only exceptions are the Row and the
Cowell Cluster, which are expected to be wired
by next year.
"We think it is going to be a real big success,
but we don't expect anyone to watch," says Stein.
