# What's the 4-1-1?

You've seen them at frat parties. You've seen
them at house parties. You've seen them at hip
hop Night at the Coffee House. Without them,
there could be no party.
The worst deejays just play one CD or tape after
another, with agonizing pauses in between. Those who
are better can gauge the mood of the crowd, pulling
out just the right selection to keep the party going
strong. The best use their records to play the crowd
like a violin, speeding up or slowing down the tempo

of the party at will.
But you're not impressed. You think you can do bet
ter. You've seen "House Party," "Juice" and "Pump Up
the Volume." And you've watched them do it at parties
since high school. All you have to do is get your par
ents to ship you those turntables that you put in stor
age, hook them up to your 200 watt amp, set up your
speakers and you're in business.
Darnell L. Brooks of B-Side Productions has just that
attitude. In his first year at Stanford, the quality of the

campus deejays didn't impress
Brooks, now a junior. "Freshman year
we used to go to all the parties and,
basically, we just didn't like what we
saw.
"We didn't like none of the deejays
on campus — we thought they were
wack, and like, damn, we could do
this shit better ourselves," he says.
"We did our first party in winter of
1990, and that's how we got started.
We ended up doing that party free,
just to break onto the scene."
He laughs, recalling, "Turned out
pretty good for our debut."
You'd think that deejays are just in it
for the money. But Brooks, who spe
cializes in hip-hop, seeks more than
just financial rewards. "If I do a live
mix or something and everybody's
just hyped about it... that's the
biggest thing. And I really like music,
so that's the thing that keeps me
going, because at Stanford University,
the money is not that good.
"If I really didn't like it, I would've
quit a long time ago," he adds.
But you don't care about the
money. You just want to spin
those records. What does it
take?
"Patience," say seniors Kim Ha and
Kelly Portnoff, in unison. "Especially
on the Stanford campus. You get a lot
of complaints — you just have to
take the abuse."
Known professionally as The Quake,
the two women have been partners
since their sophomore year, specializ
ing in modern rock. In their efforts
to make a name for themselves on
campus, they've encountered a some
what unique problem — partygoers

'We didn't like none
OF THE DEEJAYS ON CAMPUS —
WE THOUGHT THEY WERE WACK,
AND LIKE, DAMN,
WE COULD DO THIS SHIT BETTER OURSELVES.'

heap extra abuse upon female deejays.
"If there was a man up there who didn't know shit
and just stood there and pretended like he was deejay
ing, while we were doing all the work, they wouldn't
bother us. But as soon as they see two women up there
... they come up to to the turntables, they ask to start
spinning records, they want the headphones, they
want to start scratching."
Their male peers, however, can be more open-mind
ed. "As soon as they see that I can mix, they're
impressed." But Ha has no illusions about their praise:
"They think of it more in terms of using me as a gim
mick, because people'll go 'Wow. There's a girl up
there — and she knows what she's doing.' "
For Ha, deejaying runs in the family. "My sister dee
jayed professionally. She had all the equipment and all
the records. Two years ago, she had a baby and she had
to take care of it, so she couldn't deejay anymore."
That got Ha thinking about the possibilities that were
suddenly available. "I figured I'd use the equipment."
But Ha knew she would need a partner. "I asked Kelly
because she likes to dance and she likes music — I need
ed a good person to give me input on music selection."
Sophomore George Perry, a hip-hop deejay, was even
more adamant about the need for a competent partner:
"There's always one person who more people know
about than the other, but there's no way anybody can
deejay alone. It's the expense, it's the time, it's the
moving stuff — I mean, just think of any deejay. Like
DJ Red Alert. There's no way he could go to do a party
and move all his equipment, set up, spin and get the
crowd going by himself."
Sophomore Peter Smiltins currently backs him up.
"He deejays a little less than half the time," Perry says.
"The setup at school is half his and half mine. Without
him, it'd be nothing."
Perry and his partner take pride in having a good
working and business relationship. "The money is
split halfway. I've heard of deejays who are like, 'I'm
keeping all of this, and you can just be down,' but
that's bad business."
It's definitely a business. It isn't just fine men or women
requesting a song in their most seductive voices. And, as
in any business, what's more important to a deejay than
natural talent is patience and dedication. "Learning how
to deejay is a process that you really have to do on your
own. You have to learn how to get everything on beat at
the same time. And it takes forever. I'm not even gonna lie
— it took me two years to get on beat."
And that's just what it takes to keep the music
going without interruption. Scratching and
mixing — a manual blending of two records at
the same time — take even more time to learn, and

are difficult to do well. But hip-hop deejay Ron
Worthy of Raw Vibes, an alumnus who still works in
the area, says that scratching and mixing aren't essen
tial for the Stanford crowd:
"There are some deejays on campus that can mix, and
mix regularly. And I've been to some of their parties and
not really seen much excitement. At some of my parties,
where I'm into what people want to hear, I'll see my
crowds having a great time. You can create the same

effect [as mixing] if you're playing really good music "
He adds facetiously, "As long as it's not going from
120 beats per minute down to, like, 30."
Also, most campus deejays, he says, aren't true mix
ers like the deejays on the East Coast. "I'm used to a
guy mixing records and almost creating another type
of song. I see people here beat-matching and blend
ing, but there are only a few true mixers."
Worthy differs from the other deejays in that he pri-

marily uses compact
discs instead of vinyl
records. "When I first
started I didn't plan
to be a deejay. I was
using my collection,
and my collection was
CDs, so I just went
from there."
He defends his use
of compact discs on a
practical level, saying,
"You can create some
continuity when you
use CDs. Music is
music to me. If a guy
has CDs and he's
rockin' the house and
making me feel good,
I don't care. If he's
playing the Isley
brothers on an eight
track, I'm gonna like
it just as much as if
he's playing it on
vinyl."
But Worthy
doesn't prefer them
to vinyl at all. "If I
could afford it, I
would use vinyl.

Completely. But to start using two [turntables] and
all the shit that goes in with that — I mean that
costs a lot of money. And I just could not afford that
... because I never really planned to be a deejay like
I am now."
He's right about the costs. Turntables, known as
twelves in deejayspeak, cost between $250-
$500 apiece — and you need a pair of them. A
mixer will run about $200. An amplifier costs upwards
of $300. Speakers range from $400 to $800, or more.
Repair and equipment expenses are also expensive.
And on top of all that, deejays have to keep their
music current or go out of business. It's clearly not a
venture for the faint of heart, or the light of wallet.
Small wonder then, that alumnus Donnovan
Somera of Divine Beat Sounds recommends that peo
ple trying to break into the business buy used equip
ment. "Ninety percent of the things that we use you
can buy used and get great deals on them. The worst
mistake you can make is putting all the capital into
new equipment because the reality is that nobody
cares.
"You could probably do pretty well on [a budget]
between $1000 and $2000." More fortunate people
can start up on "mommy and daddy's, or someone
else's capital," he continues. Divine Beat tried as much
as possible to keep within a decent budget:
"Renting is a good idea because if you don't have
the capital up front you can rent for a while, make
some money and start funnelling that money back
into new or used equipment."
He adds, however, that some equipment, such as
turntables should be bought, because "you don't
know what you're getting if you rent them.
