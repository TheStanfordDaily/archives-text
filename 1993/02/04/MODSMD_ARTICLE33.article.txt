Sex with severed
limb: Horrorshow
is sexy and scary

Children of the Corn II

Coming from Indiana, I've seen a lot of
corn.
Every time I went to or from my house, I
had to pass rows of corn. I've eaten corn
bread, corn dogs, raw corn, creamed corn and
corn salad. It's enough to drive you crazy.
Which is exactly what happens to these
sweet litde kids from Gatlin, Nebraska in
"Children of the Corn II." And by crazy I don't
mean red-wine-with-fish, topless-at-Tresid
der crazy, I mean kill-your-parents, demon
worship kind of crazy. Magnificently crazy.
If you saw "Children of the Corn" I, you're
in a select group. You're also in for a treat if
you go to the sequel, because it's actually bet
ter than the original. Even if you didn't see the
original, the writers made it so you can un
derstand the sequel. No dummies, they.
Picking up after the parental massacre de
picted in Corn I, Corn II has the murderous
little kids of Gatlin adopted by loving families
in the neighboring town. Unfortunately, the
kids flip out again, start worshipping "He
Who Walks Behind The Rows" and kill adults
in varied and creative ways. Then the movie
gets better.
But a warning is in order: the movie's not
that good. The actors overact, exuding fake
emotion and crocodile tears. In addition, the
plot is incredibly convoluted: before the film
ends, the munchkin murder spree has been
blamed on a combination of factors including
fornication, pesticides, devil worship, the
Bible and Jacksonian Native American-re
moval policies.
But the movie has good points, too. The
soundtrack spooks and surprises the audi
ence at all the right moments, and there's a
neat computer animation sequence.
Most of all, however, the movie has death
— some of the most amusing death ever seen.
A house and a hydraulic lift provide a clever
homage to "The Wizard of Oz," lacking only
striped socks. One great scene features a man

dying after blood explodes from every orifice
in his face. There's even a sex scene involving
a severed hand. Hilarious.
And then there's the wheelchair scene ...
but no, you'll have to see that for yourself. Suf
fice to say, it's about the best killing ever.
So don't go to "Children of the Corn II" ex
pecting great filmmaking. But if you want to
be frightened, disgusted and — yes —
amused, this is the flick for you. Maybe it's not
"Citizen Kane," but "Citizen Kane" didn't
have someone torn to shreds by farm ma
chinery. Too bad.

Half-man half*ant
all laughs in this
boisterous B*ffilm

Matinee

Kissing in a bomb shelter! A dentist with
claws! A picnic menace beyond your worst
nightmares!
"Matinee" stars John Goodman in a movie
that is part teen flick, part horror spoof and
part nuclear scare. The relationship between a
navy boy's adolescent tribulations, a giant ant
named Bill and the Cuban Missile Crisis re
mains tenuous, but director Joe Dante
("Gremlins") transforms the flimsy plot into

a fun B-movie.
The film initially focuses on Gene Loomis
(Simon Fenton), whose family has just ar
rived at the naval base in Key West, Fla. Facing
the typical problems of a new kid in town,
Gene retreats into horror magazines and
movies, rather than making friends. As
"Matinee" begins, Gene eagerly awaits the up
coming release of "MANT!" which promises
"Half Man... Half Ant... All Terror!!!"
Just as the movie is scheduled to open, the
Cuban Missile Crisis begins, and the easy
going, beach-loving Key Westers begin to
panic. Lawrence Woolsey (Goodman), the di
rector/producer of "MANT!" arrives in town
for his movie's premiere and decides to take
advantage of the residents' fear of nuclear war.
Like real-life producer William Castle, on
whom his character is based, Woolsey gleeful
ly concocts gimmicks that will terrify the au
diences of his horror movie. Buzzers in the
movie seats, an earthquake machine and spe
cial visual effects create havoc in the theater.
The only flaw of "Matinee" is its presenta
tion of a satiric plot against the backdrop of
nuclear war. Even a goo-spitting ant cannot
make the potential threat of human extinc
tion funny.
Goodman gives a delightful performance
as Woolsey, a slightly sleazy but good-hearted
showman. He is exuberant, witty and
tremendously fun to watch.
As it spoofs early pseudo-scientific horror
movies, "Matinee" has an air of hilarity. It is
impossible not to laugh at "MANT!" when a

shoe salesman turns into a giant ant, or when
a wife begs her husband to "listen to the man
in you and put the insect aside!"
"Matinee" again amuses when it pokes fun
at coming-of-age teen movies. Dante deliber
ately overdramatizes and oversentimentalizes
his plot. He produces characters right out of a
John Hughes movie: the nerd, the naughty
but- nice sweetheart, the outsider, the tough
guy, the ditsy mom and the obnoxious
younger brother.

Hired killer flick:
As much fun as a
bullet in the guts

Sniper

"Sitting in an office and giving men or
ders to kill is just as bad as shooting someone
straight in the heart," says marine Thomas
Beckett, essentially explaining the message
of "Sniper" to his partner Richard Miller
(Billy Zane).
However, watching the two men troll
around the jungle for two hours shooting at
random targets as part of a vaguely-defined
mission undermines its potential. This con
temporary "Heart of Darkness" is all dark
ness without any heart.
Tom Berenger plays Beckett, a marine
sniper in Panama who knows his job and the
terrain, but habitually loses his partners
along the way. Miller is a rookie, fresh out of
training, who won an Olympic medal for
shooting, but has no field experience and has
never shot a man. The two are sent on a mis
sion together to assassinate a Panamanian
general, or two, or three.
Left in the jungle with only Beckett and
his gun, Miller finds out that rank means
nothing in the face of experience and that his
textbook training matters little when faced
with a real situation.
Despite Miller's dedication to the mission,
he frequently hesitates to pull the trigger.
However, he gets over this aversion after his
first kill. As Beckett points out, "The only one
that really mattered was the first one."
Unfortunately, this is true for the viewer
as well, and after an eternity of the two forg
ing through streams, clearing brush, sniping
and griping, it wouldn't really matter to the
most die-hard action fan if both of them
were killed, too.
The clever cinematography makes the
movie more bearable. Throughout the film,
the camera follows each bullet, which, like
an arrow, reminds the viewer of the primi
tive instincts underlying our complex mod
ern society.
Berenger is quite good with scant material
while Zane's talent lies in the comic moments
— such as a scene where he meticulously ap
plies his camaflouge make-up — because of
the film's poor script, his character does not
develop or degenerate as the action implies,
but makes sudden about-faces instead.
The film could have succeeded with more
skilled writers, but Michael Frost Beckner
and Crash Leyland are not those writers. Di
rector Luis Llosa's work might have had a
chance if these themes hadn't already been
covered infinitely better in other films,
"Sniper" is clearly no "Apocalypse Now."
