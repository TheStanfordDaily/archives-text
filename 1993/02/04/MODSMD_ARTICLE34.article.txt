Bitter vegan who
enjoys oral sex?
Try Consolidated

Consolidated

Nobody is safe from criticism.
And in typical fashion, Consolidated
proves on their new album that they pretty
much don't like anyone — unless they're an
actively protesting, pro-choice, vegan, non
homophobic, bitter, disillusioned Ameri
cans, who both give and receive oral sex.
After "Friendly Facism," Consolidated
had pretty much nailed everything as far as
liberal ideals go. "Play More Music," how
ever, is not only more liberal, but criticizes
everything from the meat and dairy indus
tries to mindless slamdancing.
It's not surprising to hear the familiar
mishmash of media bites that has become
an integral part of Consolidated's sound.

Traditional dialogue, recorded by Consoli
dated records at their concerts, also fills the
gaps between songs. Yet Consolidated's de
cision to no longer make their album be
musical probably surprises the listener
most.
Unlike previous albums, "Play More
Music" doesn't have any of the danceable,
laid-back tracks like the popular "Dysfunc
tional" and "Unity of Oppression," instead
favoring more tracks like "The Sexual Poli
tics of Meat," which basically superimposes
media bites over industrial disco beats.
Considering the impact of the more
danceable tracks upon their success, as well
as the appeal to a larger, more "ignorant"
audience, it's surprising that Consolidated
instead has chosen to focus their work on a
more limited sound that appeals only to
their fans, firm believers in their lyrical
doctrine.
But the album isn't all bad. The token
genre-bashing track, "Accept me for what I
am" rips into the sexist, racist, homo-pho
bic slant of many heavy metal bands, and
makes a poignant statement about the need
for the acceptance of homosexuality. And
"Suck Me," — a song about cunnilingus
and the need for equality in sexual relations
— is not only amusing, but refreshingly dif
ferent as well.
Consolidated has never been very musi
cally oriented and, while they are some
times considered part of the industrial
disco genre, they have always strived to sep
arate themselves from it. In a recent inter
view with "Volume," they explained their
agenda:
"Unlike the rest of the industrial disco
groups, our idea of strength has no connec
tion with Constructivism or Futurism or
the heroic imagery of totalitarian art ....
We aim to show that rock music is not in
strumental in promoting social change,
that it is useless as a vehicle. We need to
change the social conditions in which
music is produced and consumed before
music can change anything."
"Play More Music" falls short of what
some of the listeners might have expected.
The shift from a less musical style towards a
more direct sound definitely alienates
mainstream audiences. But for the diehards
who know and love Consolidated's real mo

tives, the album is required listening.

New Prodigy disc
only disappoints:
nothing new here

The Prodigy Experience

The Prodigy is to the U.S. rave scene as
Ross Perot was to the Presidential Elections:
rich kids with big toys, in it for a joy ride.
However, The Prodigy is the largest break
beat outfit to make it here, both in the under
ground warehouses and on commercial,
clear-channel FM.
Breakbeat house accelerates hip-hop
drum tracks to about 135 beats per minute,
covering them with synthesizers. "Charly" —
The Prodigy's smash '91 single — is the only
breakbeat song on the road to becoming as
important to any rave collection as Maurice's
"This Is Acid." It's now re-released on "Expe
rience" for the umpteenth time with an
umpteenth remix — "Charly XXIV: Charly
Takes Manhattan In 3-D."
"Experience" is a wealth of already-proven
rereleases, and positions The Prodigy as
Time Warner's "hip-underground™" flavor
of the month. (Pssst... Prodigy, don't think
they'll keep you around long. If we were you,
we wouldn't quit our high-paying day jobs.)

The new remix adds, well, we counted
four new notes in the "Charly" theme — you
do the math ... at $14.99, that would be
$3.75 per note, before sales tax. Maybe they
can quit their day jobs.
Despite this rip-off, "Experience" has one
extreme gem that probably won't be released
on single: "Weather Experience" — an eight
minute romp through what sounds like sci-fi
movie-theme washes, merging with deep, hard
acid lines and a slower breakbeat than usual.
Another credit to the album is very creative
sampling, covering everything from 1970s
public service messages to roots reggae. But
overall, the album is disappointing and we rec
ommend any of their previous EPs or single
edits — releases with much stronger mixing.
If you're interested in the Ragga House
vein, try SL2's "On a Ragga Tip," The Orb's
"Perpetual Dawn," the Ragga Twins' "Shine-
Eye" or even Ezzee-Possee's "Everything
Starts With An E." These tracks rely upon
more complex arrangements, and more in
ventive hooks than what quickly degenerates
through the musical Cuisinart of Prodigy's
one-riff formula stretched to seven minutes.
Ragga House is extremely powerful and in
fectious; if it doesn't make you move, go over
to Cowell for one of those free pulse checks.
The bio claims "Experience" is "virtual re
ality for the ears" — but that's the sort of
cheesy text and borrowed-interest imagery
the majors use to recalculate their "in the
scene" informants and youth demographics,
after they've already sucked the style dry.
