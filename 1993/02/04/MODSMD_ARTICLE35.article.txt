Damaga
A British politician (Jeremy
Irons) embarks on a scan
dalous affair with his son's fi
ancee (Juliette Binoche) that
ends inauspiciously. Based on
the novel of the same name,
"Damage" stays true to airport
reading with graphic sex
scenes and a trite plot. Rated R
■ Man Bites Dog
An impoverished film crew fol
lows a serial-killer in mock
documentary style as he
knocks off victims and dumps
the bodies. The plot thickens
as the crew transforms from
observers to accomplices in an
effort to finance the documen
tary. Violence over-shadows
comedic aspects leaving the
audience more disturbed than
entertained. Not Rated
■ Hexed
A hotel clerk (Arye Gross) with
a penchant for embellishing
the truth, and an obsession
with an international super
model (Claudia Christian), un
knowingly impersonates the
model's blackmailer in order to
score a date with her. Yet the
supermodel has a few secrets
of her own — she's a formerly
obese fugitive killer who fled
from America to France before
becoming a model. Uproari
ously funny. Rated R
Aspen Extreme
T.J. Burke (Paul Gross) leaves
his blue collar job to chase
dreams in Aspen, Colo., drag
ging his best friend (Peter Berg)
with him. While Burke works his
way into the ranks of ski star
dom, his friend gets lured into

■ = recommended

the depths of Aspen's under
world. Breathtaking scenery
and daredevil stunts will satisfy
ski lovers, but storyline follows
a lengthy and predictable
course. Rated PG-13
Body of Evidence
Madonna plays a Portland
gallery owner on trial for mur
dering her elderly millionaire
lover with sex and a little co
caine on the side. Her lawyer
(Willem Dafoe) gets entangled
in her case and in her bed.
Tawdry S&M tableaux and an
unlikely plot leave the movie
nothing more than a giant in
fomercial for "Sex." Rated R
■ Alive
Severed members of a
Uruguayan rugby team strug
gle to survive a plane crash in
the snow covered Andes.
Based on a novel that was
based on a true story, the sur
vivors are forced to cannibalize
their dead. The harrowing de
tails are the film's strength, but
sweeping scores and slick ac
tion sequences undermine the
gritty realism. A mostly-suc
cessful docudrama. Rated R
Bad Lieutenant
A cokehead cop (Harvey Keit
el) tries to redeem himself by
catching some kids who raped
a nun with a crucifix. A relent
lessly shallow film with just one
powerful scene: the degrading
sexual humiliation of two
teenage girls at the hand of the
Lieutenant. Writer-director
Abel Ferrara should be forced
to masturbate at gunpoint to
atone for this schlock-fest.
Rated NC-17
