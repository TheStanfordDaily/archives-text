While President Bill Clinton struggles to fully inte
grate gays, lesbians and bisexuals into the military,
it may be an ideal time to rent gay-themed and
good ole' anti-war videos.
A touching tale of male hustlers struggling to survive on
the seamy streets of Portland, Oregon, My Own Private
Idaho stars River Phoenix, Keanu Reeves and Red Hot
Chili Pepper's bassist Flea. Writer-director Gus Van Sant
blends the storyline with a poignant retelling of Henry IV.
A visual treat and a standout performance by Phoenix.
A trenchant anti-war movie, Paths Of Glory is the
first in a series of such films by director Stanley Kubrick
("Full Metal Jacket"). French troops abort a suicidal of
fensive against an impregnable German stronghold. The
embarrassed and angry General selects a single man from
each unit and court-martials him. Kirk Douglas plays an
officer struggling to defend the men against certain death
sentences. An insightful look at the lunacy of war.
Using the unrest generated by the punk movement in
1970s Britain, writer-director Isaac Julien's Young Soul
Rebels examines the intersections of race, class and sexu
ality. A black gay man is murdered in a local park, and two
pirate deejays — one straight, one gay—try to track down
his killer. Julien constantly plays with our expectations, en
abling the film to transcend its murder-mystery origins.
Actor-heartthrob Daniel Day-Lewis ("Last of the Mo
hicans") and director Stephen Frears ("Dangerous Li
aisons") exploded onto the film scene with My Beauti
ful Laundrette, a fresh, funny and sexy look at interra
cial gay love in South London. Day-Lewis plays a work
ing-class white kid who falls in love with a Pakistani im
migrant. Together, they try to turn a rundown laundro
mat into a "Ritz among laundrettes."
Finally, Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove takes a
more humorous look at the insanity of war. A series of
political and military mishaps give two psychotic U.S.
generals the opportunity to launch a preemptive nuclear
strike against the Soviet Union. Peter Sellars plays three
roles, including the criminal mastermind and the hero, in
this fast-paced farce. Highly entertaining. ■
