The last word on ■..

It's too damn cold to let it all hang out.
As the north wind blows across campus
and the rain sets in again, nudity could even
be a hazard to your health.
Unless you're going to rub vaseline on your
nipples to keep them from chapping, and use
menthol-rub to keep all mucus-membranes
happy, nakedness is just not practical.
After a while, the suspense in choosing

The new FADS

If you went to see Consolidated in concert for the
first time, you'd probably want to ease into their
hard-driving industrial disco beats.
That's why their current North American tour
features the New Fast Automatic Daffodils as their
opening act.
The New FADS moody brand of hypno-funk has
culminated in their latest album, "Body Exit Mind."
Produced by Craig Leon, whose previous credits in
clude Blondie and the Ramones, the album is a fluid
mix of rolling bass grooves and lashing guitar
sounds that sounds like Joy Division with a mon
ster riff.
Adamantly anti-techno, FADS is not a rave band,
but, they still demand technical perfection in their
music.
Look for the band from Manchester, England
when they open for Consolidated in San Francisco
later this spring.

which socks and shoes you're going to wc»r
might become a little unsatisfying, as your
flesh tone stays the same. Gone will be all the
daily gratuitous compliments from pseudo
friends regarding your flattering sailor-suit
dresses. No more "that pea green muumuu
looks so flattering on you."
Plus, naked butts are so ugly.
I mean, unless you're gonna take out stock

Passion fish

Friday Feb. 5 the Palo Alto Square opens an exclu
sive peninsula engagement of "Passion Fish," the new
film by writer-director John Sayles. Mary McDonnell
plays a soap-opera star, recently confined to a wheel
chair, who leaves her New York lifestyle to return to
her southern birthplace. She spends her time bitterly
abusing a series of nurse-maids, until Chantelle
(Alfre Woodward) stands her ground. Shot against
the rich backdrop of the Louisiana bayou, "Passion
Fish" is an intimate film edged with humor.
The Palo Alto Square is located at 3000 El
Camino Real.

in Nair and do it all right, the naked human
body is just nasty. The Puritans were right.
Lift it, hold it in, cover it up and flatten it out,
just keep those garanimals on.
Besides, shaving cute little shapes in your
pubic hair is overrated, and the razor burn is
a bit traumatic. Plus, your semi-significant
other won't accept less than a tattoo.

clude Blondie and the Ramones, the album is a fluid
mix of rolling bass grooves and lashing guitar
sounds that sounds like Joy Division with a mon
ster riff.
Adamantly anti-techno, FADS is not a rave band,
but, they still demand technical perfection in their
music.
Look for the band from Manchester, England
when they open for Consolidated in San Francisco
later this spring.

which socks and shoes you're going to wc»r
might become a little unsatisfying, as your
flesh tone stays the same. Gone will be all the
daily gratuitous compliments from pseudo
friends regarding your flattering sailor-suit
dresses. No more "that pea green muumuu
looks so flattering on you."
Plus, naked butts are so ugly.

Passion fish

Friday Feb. 5 the Palo Alto Square opens an exclu
sive peninsula engagement of "Passion Fish," the new
film by writer-director John Sayles. Mary McDonnell
plays a soap-opera star, recently confined to a wheel
chair, who leaves her New York lifestyle to return to
her southern birthplace. She spends her time bitterly
abusing a series of nurse-maids, until Chantelle
(Alfre Woodward) stands her ground. Shot against
the rich backdrop of the Louisiana bayou, "Passion
Fish" is an intimate film edged with humor.
The Palo Alto Square is located at 3000 El
Camino Real.

in Nair and do it all right, the naked human
body is just nasty. The Puritans were right.
Lift it, hold it in, cover it up and flatten it out,
just keep those garanimals on.
Besides, shaving cute little shapes in your
pubic hair is overrated, and the razor burn is
a bit traumatic. Plus, your semi-significant
other won't accept less than a tattoo.
