Education is the most effective rem
edy for Germany's hate crimes, the
Consul General of the German Con
sulate in San Francisco told about 25
students and faculty members at Haus
Mitteleuropa yesterday afternoon.
The German government has intro
duced programs for all age levels to pro
mote tolerance, Elmar Weinder said.'
He added that the most valuable way to
enlighten people is to educate them on

both present problems and past history.
"Single German states are sovereign
in education," Weinder said. "But
there is always an obligation to teach
the history of this century, especially
the Third Reich, the Weimar Republic
and the Holocaust."
Despite the difficulties the country
is experiencing, he also said students
should not hesitate to study in Berlin.
Weinder started his speech by dis
cussing hate crimes, saying that with
German reunification's social and eco
nomic changes came an unemployment

rate as high as 50 percent in many East
German communities and a three mil
lion unit housing shortage.
The country is also having problems
with its asylum laws, he said, which
allow refugees who are not eligible to
work in Germany to receive money and
housing for up to six years.
Although the government is now
implementing stronger conditions for
asylum seekers, the policy is currently
funded through taxes, Weinder said.
Some Germans, he explained, do not
want to help foreigners when Germany

has so many of its own domestic prob
lems. He said as a result of these cata
strophes, some Germans have become
xenophobic and anti-Semitic.
"Values, families, social identity
broke down," he said. "All these factors
contributed to pent-up frustration and
insecurity which erupted into civil un
rest, the sort of free-flowing, sponta
neous aggression which in turn finds
its own victims."
Weinder spent the afternoon at
Stanford, meeting with President Ger
hard Casper and other faculty.
