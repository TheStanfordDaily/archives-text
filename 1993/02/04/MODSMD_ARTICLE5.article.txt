# Salamanders delay eco-house
## Almost-endangered amphibians make home on Knoll 
### Troy Parkins Editorial staff 
When talk of new housing on the
Knoll began, both students and adminis
trators wanted an environmentally sen
sitive "eco-house."
But by being environmentally correct,
Stanford may end up with no housing.
The return of the tiger salamander, once
thought to be extinct, has halted con
struction indefinitely.
Biologists found the rare salamanders
on the Knoll Monday, according to cam
pus planner Drew Oman. Stanford had
hoped to construct two undergraduate
residences on the land southeast of Lake
Lagunita.
Originally scheduled to open in 1994
and house 190 students, this project will
be delayed by the new discovery for at
least two months, if not forever.
"It's a novel situation on campus,"
Oman said. "We haven't had any species on
our land that have been protected before."
Oman said biologists have indicated
the need to delay the project while they
develop a habitat conservation plan for
the amphibians.

University officials will wait until the
plan comes out in March to make a deci
sion on the construction, Oman said.
Alan Launer, a staff biologist at the
Center of Conservation Biology, said the
government could place the salamander
under endangered species protection as
soon as six months from now.
"They have been showing up every
where; from kitchens in the Suites to the
Psych Corner," Launer said. "Near the
intersection (of Campus Drive and Ju
nipero Serra) is the best place to see the
salamanders and it is amusing to see 12
heads popping up, looking around."
And just because salamander sight
ings have gone up since the beginning of
the rainy weather does not mean they
aren't rare, Launer warned.
Launer said Stanford has been good
about looking after the salamander's
concerns, keeping Lake Lag full last year
during the drought to help the salaman
der's survival.
"The University is not being like the
usual developer â€” moving in the plow.
They are looking at the salamander as if
it was on the endangered list already,"
Launer said.

Stanford and the salamander have
had a long history together, said biolo
gist Mike Westfall of the Coyote Creek
Riparian Center. More than fifty years
ago, a professor noted migrations of tiger
salamanders back and forth across Ju
nipero Serra.
"I knew they were around," Westfall
said. "So when I would drive down Ju
nipero Serra I would look for them." Last
year, his diligence finally paid off.
Westfall and colleague Rich Seymour
spotted a single tiger salamander going
across the road last March. "We were
very excited. This was the first sighting
in over twenty years," he said.
The University hired the biologists to
investigate the salamander situation.
They were the ones who found the juve
nile tiger salamanders living in the Knoll
earlier this week.
Both scientists followed up on the
sighting, and in June of last year they
saw more salamanders crossing Ju
nipero Serra, making their trek back to
the foothills. During the storms last
month the salamanders began to leave
