# Dekker named graduate dean

### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
English Prof. George Dekker, named associate
dean for graduate policy this week, has pledged to
make graduate issues such as housing and diversity
his top priorities.
Although his job holds little formal power, Dekker
said he plans to act as an advocate for graduate stu
dents and make sure their needs "aren't just shoved
under the table or ignored."
"It isn't clear to me that I have a lot of power or re
sources to do anything in particular," he said. "On
the other hand, I'm well placed to communicate
things with people who do have power and re-

sources."
Dekker's position was created by
University President Gerhard
Casper earlier this year, after a
number of graduate students com
plained that they lacked a central
advocate within the administration.
The dean of graduate studies had
played that role until two years ago,
when the position was eliminated by
budget-cuts.

Derek Miyahara, a graduate student in the School
of Education and chair of the ASSU's University re
lations committee, said he is encouraged by Dekker's
appointment.
"I think he's going to be a fine advocate for gradu
ate students," Miyahara said. "He's shown himself to
be aware of the issues and he's someone who listens,
so I'm sure we'll be meeting with him soon."
Dekker will actually be the third-ranking official
in charge of graduate policy, after Provost Gerald
Lieberman and Dean of Research Charles Kruger,
who appointed Dekker.
But Dekker said neither of them "has possibly got
the hours in the day" to spend on graduate issues, so
he will be the main official responding to students'
concerns.
