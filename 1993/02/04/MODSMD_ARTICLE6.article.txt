# Dekker named graduate dean
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
English Prof. George Dekker, named associate
dean for graduate policy this week, has pledged to
make graduate issues such as housing and diversity
his top priorities.
Although his job holds little formal power, Dekker
said he plans to act as an advocate for graduate stu
dents and make sure their needs "aren't just shoved
under the table or ignored."
"It isn't clear to me that I have a lot of power or re
sources to do anything in particular," he said. "On
the other hand, I'm well placed to communicate
things with people who do have power and re-

sources."
Dekker's position was created by
University President Gerhard
Casper earlier this year, after a
number of graduate students com
plained that they lacked a central
advocate within the administration.
The dean of graduate studies had
played that role until two years ago,
when the position was eliminated by
budget-cuts.

Derek Miyahara, a graduate student in the School
of Education and chair of the ASSU's University re
lations committee, said he is encouraged by Dekker's
appointment.
"I think he's going to be a fine advocate for gradu
ate students," Miyahara said. "He's shown himself to
be aware of the issues and he's someone who listens,
so I'm sure we'll be meeting with him soon."
Dekker will actually be the third-ranking official
in charge of graduate policy, after Provost Gerald
Lieberman and Dean of Research Charles Kruger,
who appointed Dekker.
But Dekker said neither of them "has possibly got
the hours in the day" to spend on graduate issues, so
he will be the main official responding to students'
concerns.

Graduate students have com
plained in the last two years that
without a dean in charge of grad
uate policy, wider graduate issues
such as affirmative action have
been ignored.
He said he has already exam
ined figures on the ethnic makeup
of last year's entering class of

graduate students. Making sure
the University is meeting its affir
mative action goals is "one of the
things I'll be keeping an eye on,"
he said. "If I find, for instance,
that we're falling down seriously
in our commitment to diversity,
then I'm going to be reporting
that to the proper people."
Graduate students have also
complained of uncertainty about
where they should take concerns
or questions about policy issues.
Dekker said he hopes his title,

which clearly identifies him as the
official involved with graduate
policy, will end any confusion.
"The name tells you that if this
is a policy matter that concerns a
graduate student, then I'm some
body who can be contacted about
it,"he said. "I think that's the
most important part of this — to
actually have somebody who is
responsible."
Dekker said he plans to meet
regularly with students, with Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary

Edmonds and with administra
tors. "I think I can be a channel
for graduate student concerns
and be a bit of a traffic manager,"
he said. "I can make sure these
concerns get communicated to the
appropriate people."
One issue he plans to study is
whether the University is admit
ting more master's students than
it can handle. Increasing the
number admitted has "significant
adverse effects," he said, such as
stretching the student housing

supply too thin.
Dekker's appointment is half
time, but he plans to work full
time for the first few months
while learning the job. A specialist
in American literature, Dekker is
working on a book-length study of
Henry James.
Dekker joined the Stanford fac
ulty in 1972, chaired the English
department from 1978 to 1981
and in 1984-85, and has frequent
ly been a member of the Faculty
Senate.
