## Stanford picks fourth best in nation; 19 All-Americans 
### Noah Blake Senior Staff Writer 
In the annual recruiting war over high school foot
ball talent, good college programs rebuild, while great
programs reload.
Coach Bill Walsh announced at a press conference
yesterday that the Cardinal had acquired plenty of
powerful ammunition by bringing in one of the best
recruiting classes in Stanford football history.
This batch of will-be freshmen is ranked tops in
the Pacific 10 Conference Perhaps that was to be ex
pected with Walsh as coach and with the recent trou
bles of traditional Pac-10 powerhouses Washington,
USC and UCLA. But virtually no one knew just how
talented these recruits would be.
Stanford's class of 1997 contains 19 All-Ameri
cans, many of whom have the speed that the Cardinal
desperately needed last year in losses to Arizona and
Washington. The group is ranked fourth in the na
tion by ESPN, behind only Florida State, Michigan
and national champion Alabama. If the experts are
right, Walsh and his staff outre
cruited the likes of Miami, Notre
Dame and Oklahoma.
Despite all the publicity that is
sure to follow these recruits, Walsh
knows his players will eventually
have to prove themselves on the
field. "I wish [this class' national
rankings] were the national rank
ings for playing," Walsh said. "But
they're only for recruiting."
Some of the recruits will be
making a difference very early in
their Stanford careers. "I expect
any number of our freshmen to be
on the field next season when we
play Washington in the opener,"
Walsh said.
Mike Mitchell, a 6-foot, 210-
pound running back from Phoenix,
may have the most immediate
impact on the Cardinal program.
The other four runners in the
class are also highly regarded, and
their talents range from blazing
speed to crushing power.
"These are five men that we
think are a real addition to the

squad," Walsh said. "In the run
ning back position, if you're really
talented, you can make the shift
faster than in other positions."
Handing the ball off to these
exceptional runners will be two of
Stanford's most highly-touted
recruits. Scott Frost and Tim
Carey, respectively the third- and
fifth-rated quarterback prospects
in the nation, bring incredible
offensive credentials to the Farm.
Frost, whose mobility Walsh
compared to that of former Stan
ford great John Elway, threw for
over 2,000 yards in his senior sea
son and ran for over 1,500 more.
And while Frost's 21 passing TDs
are impressive, his 33 rushing
TDs are virtually unheard of.
Carey is more of a pure passer
than Frost, and his numbers reflect
that. Last year he threw for 3,397
yards and 35 TDs at Los Alamitos
High School and was named Cali
fornia's Player of the Year.
But recruiting great QBs is
nothing new for Stanford. Recruit
ing speedy wide receivers, however,
is very unusual for the Cardinal.

Four of the nation's top 16
pass-catchers decided to attend
Stanford, and together they may
be the fastest group that the Car
dinal has ever had. "We didn't
shore [the WR positionj up — we
shifted gears," Walsh said.
Although he has been away from
putting together a Stanford recruit
ing class for a while, Walsh indicated
that the wooing game hasn't
changed all that much. Most impor
tantly, perhaps, recruits who want to
play at Stanford must still meet very
stringent entrance requirements.
"We didn't have a lot of people that
qualified for admission," Walsh said.
"Basically the great athletes who
could meet the academic require
ments were on our target list."
Walsh did admit, however, to
being slightly out of touch with the
technological changes in recruiting.
"It's very important to carry a phone
in the car — in the future we'll be
armed with phones on our hip."
Phones were ringing off the
hook when Walsh committed a few
minor recruiting violations last
month, but the Cardinal coach
addressed these concerns in classic
Walsh style. "It was a white-collar
crime. I now feel like those guys
who manipulated stocks," he
joked. "But I must say publicly
that that will never happen again."
As to whether a class this tal
ented will be the exception or the
rule in the coming years, no one
knows. But everyone may have
just learned something new about
the Stanford football program.
"What we've indicated to the
general public is we can be a great
university and still be competitive
athletically," he said. "Stanford
does this in other sports — why
not in football?"
Why not indeed.

Bill Walsh holds court as he discusses the Cardinal's 1993 football recruits yesterday. On National Let
ter of Intent Day, it was revealed that Stanford, with 19 All-Americans and six state Players of the Year,
signed one of the country's top five classes.
