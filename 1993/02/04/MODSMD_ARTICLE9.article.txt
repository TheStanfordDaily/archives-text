Second King trial begins
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A second
trial began yesterday for four policemen
in the beating of Rodney King, and more
than 300 prospective jurors were asked
if they participated in deadly riots that
followed the first trial.
The prospective jurors also were asked
whether they could reach a verdict with
out fear of a new outbreak of violence.
About 10 percent of the prospective
jurors were black and 10 percent appeared
to be other minorities. A quarter of the
panel appeared elderly. The federal trial is
being held in downtown Los Angeles; the
prospective jurors were drawn from
throughout the metropolitan area.
The four officers are charged in the
videotaped beating of King after he was
chased and stopped for speeding on
March 3, 1991.
Afghan capital under siege
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Rebels
seeking to overthrow the Islamic govern
ment fired scores of rockets into the Afghan
capital yesterday, killing at least 14 people
and wounding 79, state radio reported.
More than 300 people have been
killed and 1,500 wounded, most of them
civilians, in a two-week siege by the fun
damentalist Hezb-e-islami rebel group
headed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

The factional fighting prompted the
United Nations to withdraw its interna
tional staff from eastern and southern
Afghanistan, saying the government
could no longer guarantee their safety.
The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees ordered the evacuation after
unidentified gunmen shot and killed
four U.N. employees on Monday, said
Hugh Hudson, a spokesman for the com
missioner's office.
Israel may deport more
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said yesterday that Israel
retains the right to deport suspected
Palestinian militants despite its recent
offer to take back some of the hundreds
of men expelled in December.
Rabin was responding in Parliament
to sharp criticism from the opposition
Likud party and right-wing groups over
the Cabinet's compromise offer to
return 100 of the deportees and take
back the nearly 300 others within a year.
The deportees rejected the compromise,
and Palestinian negotiators to Middle East
peace talks say they will not return to the
bargaining table until all the deportees are
returned from southern Lebanon.
"The principle ability to remove for a
limited period of time hundreds of
inciters, leaders and organizers remains,"
Rabin said.
