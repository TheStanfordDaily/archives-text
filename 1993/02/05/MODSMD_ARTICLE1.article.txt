# Less of everything: students feeling the pinch of budget cuts

Loans are slow, food service is closed
on weekends, and the CPPC, UAC and fi
nancial aid advisors haven't been avail
able for weeks.
With the first year of the two-year Uni
versity-wide budget cuts halfway over,
students are starting to feel the effects of
the smaller staffs and reduced hours.
"For me, it just means you have to
plan out your day more," said senior Rob
Price. "You just can't walk in and expect
that someone is going to be there to help
you. I guess we've all been spoiled a little.
We're getting closer to the lines they
have at public schools."
The cuts have been necessary,
though, administrators say, since each
student affairs department has had to
trim 15 to 22 percent from their operat
ing budgets.

"In any university — in order to pre
serve academics — students affairs is hit
first," said Mary Edmonds, vice provost
for student affairs. "We'll do our best to
maintain academic support, but we
aren't going to be able to sustain all the
student services."
The solutions vary from department
to department; some administrators say
that students have been inconvenienced,
while others maintain that they are still
providing many of the same services, just
in a different way.
Less hours, less staff
Reducing hours is one of the most com

dent services, from the registrar's office
to the branch libraries, have scaled back
their hours by four to 15 hours per week.
While some students say it's been in
convenient, most have found ways to ad
just their schedules accordingly.

More difficult to deal with, though, has
been the limited individual attention
available to students because of staff cuts.
In the Financial Aids Office, hours
have been reduced, to one and a half
hours each day, and there are no advi
sors available on call, said Robert Huff,
director of the Financial Aids Office.
The office has put general informa
tion on voice mail, but Huff said it hasn't
been too successful. "Most students
would like personal service, and I'd like
to give it to them, but there's not enough
staff," he said.
Less staff has also slowed down the
disbursement of loans because applica
tions take longer to process.
"All our cuts translate into people hav
ing to wait longer," said Ellen Williams,
the associate director of financial aids. "It
takes a longer time to deliver aid. . . .And
