# Less of everything: students feeling the pinch of budget cuts
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Loans are slow, food service is closed
on weekends, and the CPPC, UAC and fi
nancial aid advisors haven't been avail
able for weeks.
With the first year of the two-year Uni
versity-wide budget cuts halfway over,
students are starting to feel the effects of
the smaller staffs and reduced hours.
"For me, it just means you have to
plan out your day more," said senior Rob
Price. "You just can't walk in and expect
that someone is going to be there to help
you. I guess we've all been spoiled a little.
We're getting closer to the lines they
have at public schools."
The cuts have been necessary,
though, administrators say, since each
student affairs department has had to
trim 15 to 22 percent from their operat
ing budgets.

"In any university — in order to pre
serve academics — students affairs is hit
first," said Mary Edmonds, vice provost
for student affairs. "We'll do our best to
maintain academic support, but we
aren't going to be able to sustain all the
student services."
The solutions vary from department
to department; some administrators say
that students have been inconvenienced,
while others maintain that they are still
providing many of the same services, just
in a different way.
Less hours, less staff
Reducing hours is one of the most com
mon ways departments save money. Stu
dent services, from the registrar's office
to the branch libraries, have scaled back
their hours by four to 15 hours per week.
While some students say it's been in
convenient, most have found ways to ad
just their schedules accordingly.

More difficult to deal with, though, has
been the limited individual attention
available to students because of staff cuts.
In the Financial Aids Office, hours
have been reduced, to one and a half
hours each day, and there are no advi
sors available on call, said Robert Huff,
director of the Financial Aids Office.
The office has put general informa
tion on voice mail, but Huff said it hasn't
been too successful. "Most students
would like personal service, and I'd like
to give it to them, but there's not enough
staff," he said.
Less staff has also slowed down the
disbursement of loans because applica
tions take longer to process.
"All our cuts translate into people hav
ing to wait longer," said Ellen Williams,
the associate director of financial aids. "It
takes a longer time to deliver aid. . . .And
that has an impact when they
can't pay their bills."
Cowell Health Center has also
experienced similar problems in
coping with a 16 percent decrease
in its operating budget. It used to
be open 24 hours a day. But over
the past four years, hours have
been whittled down to half that
time, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
While Cowell's hours have
decreased, the number of stu
dents using Cowell has risen,
making it more difficult to sched
ule appointments. It can take two
to three weeks to schedule a meet
ing with a Cowell physician, said
Alejandro Martinez, one of Cow
ell's acting directors.
"It's harder for students to be
seen when they need to be seen,"
Martinez said, adding that stu
dents will often end up "feeling
frustrated."
Less personalized service has
also been the route the Career
Planning and Placement Center
had taken in order to deal with its
25 percent budget cut, said CPPC
Director Ruth Schneider.
Along with voice mail to
replace on-call staff members, last
year's hour-long appointments
have been cut down to 45 min
utes, and students will often have

to wait up to three weeks before
they can see a counselor.
Fifteen-minute drop-in appoint
ments are available for students
who call in the morning for a meet
ing; otherwise, students who stop
by and can't see a counselor can
view videotapes that provide a
basic overview of the CPPC's ser
vices.
The CPPC also used to employ
students to summarize all the job
listings it receives and classify
them into career areas, but no
longer does.
Students can also expect less
tutoring available at the Center
for Teaching and Learning. The
CTL pays tutors to help the
approximately 1,000 students
who come in every year. But in
order to operate on a budget
that's a quarter smaller, the CTL
will have to reduce the tutoring.
Next year, tutoring will either
be limited to freshmen and sopho
mores, or it will be provided for
introductory courses only, accord
ing to CTL Director Michele Mar
incovich.
She estimated the reduction
would affect 20 to 30 percent of
the CTL users.
This year, the CTL has also cut
its lecturer positions by 40 per
cent, meaning there are fewer sec
tions of the learning strategies
and reading improvement classes
it offers every quarter.

Food service has had
to trim about $3.3
million from its
budget. Next year it
will eliminate Friday
lunches and dinners
at some dorms.
Florence Moore Hall
will also have to do
without its hot
breakfast, which will
be switched to
continental breakfast.

Several students have com
plained because they have not
been able to get into these classes
or have had difficulty scheduling
appointments to discuss their
study skills, Marincovich said.
Centralizing services
Food Service and University
libraries, taking another approach
to coping with the financial pinch,
have centralized some of their ser
vices in their effort to save money.
It's the reason why residents of
Kimball, Castano and Lantana
have to eat in other dining halls
on the weekend. The decision not
to expand these newer dorms'
food service hours to seven days a
week has saved a great deal of
money, according to Keith Guy,
the director of Housing and Food
Service.
Food service has had to trim
about 10 percent — or about $3.3
million — from its budget. It will
become even more consolidated in
next year's cuts, by eliminating
Friday lunches and dinners at
some dorms. Florence Moore Hall
will also have to do without its hot
breakfast, which will be switched
to continental breakfast.
"We're allowing students to
have a full range of meals, but
just not in their own houses,"
Guy said. Students are "inconve
nienced a little," but he said he
has received few complaints.
And for those days that Food
Service closes down, there won't
be much food at Tresidder either,
since it has had to reduce its bud
get by 20 percent, or $227,000.
"We've identified 25 days of
the year that Tresidder is not very
busy, such as on holidays and
interim days," said Tresidder
Director Roberta Braden. On
those days, Tresidder will be
closed.
Another major cut made was in
the Office of Student Affairs,
which runs programs out of
Tresidder. Every program — such
as the lunchtime concerts and
Coffee House programs — have
been eliminated, except for the
Holiday Faire and ballroom danc
ing.
The Office of Residential Edu
cation has also cut programs,
along with some residence staff.
The combined effects of earlier
repositioning and last year's bud
get cuts amounts to a 30 percent
decrease.
"The guiding philosophy has
been to preserve, to the extent
possible, the RAs and the RFs,"
said Alice Supton, the director of
residential education.
However, one resident fellow
had to be eliminated last year, and
another one will be eliminated

this year. In addition, the number
of resident assistants in upper
class dorms has been reduced by
one each, and funds for guest
speakers and other programs
have also been cut back.
The 20 percent cuts in the
entire University library system
have translated into fewer staff
members. In addition, the entire

reference service at Meyer
Library has moved into Green
Library. While collections and
reserves still operate out of
Meyer, the University may turn
the undergraduate library into a
24-hour study space this year.
"We haven't taken (library ser
vices) away, but we have reconfig
ured them," said Karen Nagy,

director of library academic and
information systems.
She said the only service lost in
restructuring are the instruction
al referenceMibrarians who aided
students through their research
process.
Improvements in sight
But for many of the weakened

services, solutions are in the
works. In the next few years, the
Financial Aids Office hopes to be
able to otter students financial aid
information through computers,
similar to the registration and
academic information offered on
Axess.
Departments are solving some
of the budget problems through
less personalized service. While
some remedies — such as having
no financial aid advisors on call —
have inconvenienced students,
others have actually made stu
dents' lives easier.
The most recent improvement
has been the Axess system, which
was put into place a year ago.
Being able to access full infor
mation about their records so eas
ily has been a boon for students.
"It's easier to access information
on the computers. You don't have
to stand in line," said sophomore
Kent Burke.
Acting registrar Jack Farrell,
who is a freshman advisor, said
his advisees and advising associ
ate really appreciate the conve
nience of Axess.
A survey of the 500 students
who tested out Axess last spring
quarter found that most users
were generally "very ethusiastic."
And some of the money Resi
dential Education managed to
save through streamlining has
been put toward the purchase of
new computers and scanners for
the dorm clusters.
The Macintosh SEs that were
in the dorms were simply too old,
said Jeff Merriman, the director
of residential computing. They
were replaced with Mac LC ll's
over the summer, and those will
probably be replaced newer mod
els within three years.

Fewer advisers, longer lines and shorter hours have been a few of the effects budget cuts have had on
student services in the year since the University announced its $43-million budget reduction plan.

"In any university — in order to pre
serve academics — students affairs is hit
first," said Mary Edmonds, vice provost
for student affairs. "We'll do our best to
maintain academic support, but we
aren't going to be able to sustain all the
student services."
The solutions vary from department
to department; some administrators say
that students have been inconvenienced,
while others maintain that they are still
providing many of the same services, just
in a different way.
Less hours, less staff
Reducing hours is one of the most com
mon ways departments save money. Stu
dent services, from the registrar's office
to the branch libraries, have scaled back
their hours by four to 15 hours per week.
While some students say it's been in
convenient, most have found ways to ad
just their schedules accordingly.

More difficult to deal with, though, has
been the limited individual attention
available to students because of staff cuts.
In the Financial Aids Office, hours
have been reduced, to one and a half
hours each day, and there are no advi
sors available on call, said Robert Huff,
director of the Financial Aids Office.
The office has put general informa
tion on voice mail, but Huff said it hasn't
been too successful. "Most students
would like personal service, and I'd like
to give it to them, but there's not enough
staff," he said.
Less staff has also slowed down the
disbursement of loans because applica
tions take longer to process.
"All our cuts translate into people hav
ing to wait longer," said Ellen Williams,
the associate director of financial aids. "It
takes a longer time to deliver aid. . . .And
that has an impact when they
can't pay their bills."
Cowell Health Center has also
experienced similar problems in
coping with a 16 percent decrease
in its operating budget. It used to
be open 24 hours a day. But over
the past four years, hours have
been whittled down to half that
time, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
While Cowell's hours have
decreased, the number of stu
dents using Cowell has risen,
making it more difficult to sched
ule appointments. It can take two
to three weeks to schedule a meet
ing with a Cowell physician, said
Alejandro Martinez, one of Cow
ell's acting directors.
"It's harder for students to be
seen when they need to be seen,"
Martinez said, adding that stu
dents will often end up "feeling
frustrated."
Less personalized service has
also been the route the Career
Planning and Placement Center
had taken in order to deal with its
25 percent budget cut, said CPPC
Director Ruth Schneider.
Along with voice mail to
replace on-call staff members, last
year's hour-long appointments
have been cut down to 45 min
utes, and students will often have

to wait up to three weeks before
they can see a counselor.
Fifteen-minute drop-in appoint
ments are available for students
who call in the morning for a meet
ing; otherwise, students who stop
by and can't see a counselor can
view videotapes that provide a
basic overview of the CPPC's ser
vices.
The CPPC also used to employ
students to summarize all the job
listings it receives and classify
them into career areas, but no
longer does.
Students can also expect less
tutoring available at the Center
for Teaching and Learning. The
CTL pays tutors to help the
approximately 1,000 students
who come in every year. But in
order to operate on a budget
that's a quarter smaller, the CTL
will have to reduce the tutoring.
Next year, tutoring will either
be limited to freshmen and sopho
mores, or it will be provided for
introductory courses only, accord
ing to CTL Director Michele Mar
incovich.
She estimated the reduction
would affect 20 to 30 percent of
the CTL users.
This year, the CTL has also cut
its lecturer positions by 40 per
cent, meaning there are fewer sec
tions of the learning strategies
and reading improvement classes
it offers every quarter.

Food service has had
to trim about $3.3
million from its
budget. Next year it
will eliminate Friday
lunches and dinners
at some dorms.
Florence Moore Hall
will also have to do
without its hot
breakfast, which will
be switched to
continental breakfast.

Several students have com
plained because they have not
been able to get into these classes
or have had difficulty scheduling
appointments to discuss their
study skills, Marincovich said.
Centralizing services
Food Service and University
libraries, taking another approach
to coping with the financial pinch,
have centralized some of their ser
vices in their effort to save money.
It's the reason why residents of
Kimball, Castano and Lantana
have to eat in other dining halls
on the weekend. The decision not
to expand these newer dorms'
food service hours to seven days a
week has saved a great deal of
money, according to Keith Guy,
the director of Housing and Food
Service.
Food service has had to trim
about 10 percent — or about $3.3
million — from its budget. It will
become even more consolidated in
next year's cuts, by eliminating
Friday lunches and dinners at
some dorms. Florence Moore Hall
will also have to do without its hot
breakfast, which will be switched
to continental breakfast.
"We're allowing students to
have a full range of meals, but
just not in their own houses,"
Guy said. Students are "inconve
nienced a little," but he said he
has received few complaints.
And for those days that Food
Service closes down, there won't
be much food at Tresidder either,
since it has had to reduce its bud
get by 20 percent, or $227,000.
"We've identified 25 days of
the year that Tresidder is not very
busy, such as on holidays and
interim days," said Tresidder
Director Roberta Braden. On
those days, Tresidder will be
closed.
Another major cut made was in
the Office of Student Affairs,
which runs programs out of
Tresidder. Every program — such
as the lunchtime concerts and
Coffee House programs — have
been eliminated, except for the
Holiday Faire and ballroom danc
ing.
The Office of Residential Edu
cation has also cut programs,
along with some residence staff.
The combined effects of earlier
repositioning and last year's bud
get cuts amounts to a 30 percent
decrease.
"The guiding philosophy has
been to preserve, to the extent
possible, the RAs and the RFs,"
said Alice Supton, the director of
residential education.
However, one resident fellow
had to be eliminated last year, and
another one will be eliminated

this year. In addition, the number
of resident assistants in upper
class dorms has been reduced by
one each, and funds for guest
speakers and other programs
have also been cut back.
The 20 percent cuts in the
entire University library system
have translated into fewer staff
members. In addition, the entire

reference service at Meyer
Library has moved into Green
Library. While collections and
reserves still operate out of
Meyer, the University may turn
the undergraduate library into a
24-hour study space this year.
"We haven't taken (library ser
vices) away, but we have reconfig
ured them," said Karen Nagy,

director of library academic and
information systems.
She said the only service lost in
restructuring are the instruction
al referenceMibrarians who aided
students through their research
process.
Improvements in sight
But for many of the weakened

services, solutions are in the
works. In the next few years, the
Financial Aids Office hopes to be
able to otter students financial aid
information through computers,
similar to the registration and
academic information offered on
Axess.
Departments are solving some
of the budget problems through
less personalized service. While
some remedies — such as having
no financial aid advisors on call —
have inconvenienced students,
others have actually made stu
dents' lives easier.
The most recent improvement
has been the Axess system, which
was put into place a year ago.
Being able to access full infor
mation about their records so eas
ily has been a boon for students.
"It's easier to access information
on the computers. You don't have
to stand in line," said sophomore
Kent Burke.
Acting registrar Jack Farrell,
who is a freshman advisor, said
his advisees and advising associ
ate really appreciate the conve
nience of Axess.
A survey of the 500 students
who tested out Axess last spring
quarter found that most users
were generally "very ethusiastic."
And some of the money Resi
dential Education managed to
save through streamlining has
been put toward the purchase of
new computers and scanners for
the dorm clusters.
The Macintosh SEs that were
in the dorms were simply too old,
said Jeff Merriman, the director
of residential computing. They
were replaced with Mac LC ll's
over the summer, and those will
probably be replaced newer mod
els within three years.

Fewer advisers, longer lines and shorter hours have been a few of the effects budget cuts have had on
student services in the year since the University announced its $43-million budget reduction plan.
Loans are slow, food service is closed
on weekends, and the CPPC, UAC and fi
nancial aid advisors haven't been avail
able for weeks.
With the first year of the two-year Uni
versity-wide budget cuts halfway over,
students are starting to feel the effects of
the smaller staffs and reduced hours.
"For me, it just means you have to
plan out your day more," said senior Rob
Price. "You just can't walk in and expect
that someone is going to be there to help
you. I guess we've all been spoiled a little.
We're getting closer to the lines they
have at public schools."
The cuts have been necessary,
though, administrators say, since each

been the limited individual attention
available to students because of staff cuts.
In the Financial Aids Office, hours
have been reduced, to one and a half
hours each day, and there are no advi
sors available on call, said Robert Huff,
director of the Financial Aids Office.
The office has put general informa
tion on voice mail, but Huff said it hasn't
been too successful. "Most students
would like personal service, and I'd like
to give it to them, but there's not enough
staff," he said.
Less staff has also slowed down the
disbursement of loans because applica
tions take longer to process.
"All our cuts translate into people hav
ing to wait longer," said Ellen Williams,
the associate director of financial aids. "It
takes a longer time to deliver aid. . . .And
that has an impact when they
can't pay their bills."
Cowell Health Center has also
experienced similar problems in
coping with a 16 percent decrease
in its operating budget. It used to
be open 24 hours a day. But over
the past four years, hours have
been whittled down to half that
time, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
While Cowell's hours have
decreased, the number of stu
dents using Cowell has risen,
making it more difficult to sched
ule appointments. It can take two
to three weeks to schedule a meet
ing with a Cowell physician, said
Alejandro Martinez, one of Cow
ell's acting directors.
"It's harder for students to be
seen when they need to be seen,"
Martinez said, adding that stu
dents will often end up "feeling
frustrated."
Less personalized service has
also been the route the Career
Planning and Placement Center
had taken in order to deal with its
25 percent budget cut, said CPPC
Director Ruth Schneider.
Along with voice mail to
replace on-call staff members, last
year's hour-long appointments
have been cut down to 45 min
utes, and students will often have

to wait up to three weeks before
they can see a counselor.
Fifteen-minute drop-in appoint
ments are available for students
who call in the morning for a meet
ing; otherwise, students who stop
by and can't see a counselor can
view videotapes that provide a
basic overview of the CPPC's ser
vices.
The CPPC also used to employ
students to summarize all the job
listings it receives and classify
them into career areas, but no
longer does.
Students can also expect less
tutoring available at the Center
for Teaching and Learning. The
CTL pays tutors to help the
approximately 1,000 students
who come in every year. But in
order to operate on a budget
that's a quarter smaller, the CTL
will have to reduce the tutoring.
Next year, tutoring will either
be limited to freshmen and sopho
mores, or it will be provided for
introductory courses only, accord
ing to CTL Director Michele Mar
incovich.
She estimated the reduction
would affect 20 to 30 percent of
the CTL users.
This year, the CTL has also cut
its lecturer positions by 40 per
cent, meaning there are fewer sec
tions of the learning strategies
and reading improvement classes
it offers every quarter.

Food service has had
to trim about $3.3
million from its
budget. Next year it
will eliminate Friday
lunches and dinners
at some dorms.
Florence Moore Hall
will also have to do
without its hot
breakfast, which will
be switched to
continental breakfast.

Several students have com
plained because they have not
been able to get into these classes
or have had difficulty scheduling
appointments to discuss their
study skills, Marincovich said.
Centralizing services
Food Service and University
libraries, taking another approach
to coping with the financial pinch,
have centralized some of their ser
vices in their effort to save money.
It's the reason why residents of
Kimball, Castano and Lantana
have to eat in other dining halls
on the weekend. The decision not
to expand these newer dorms'
food service hours to seven days a
week has saved a great deal of
money, according to Keith Guy,
the director of Housing and Food
Service.
Food service has had to trim
about 10 percent — or about $3.3
million — from its budget. It will
become even more consolidated in
next year's cuts, by eliminating
Friday lunches and dinners at
some dorms. Florence Moore Hall
will also have to do without its hot
breakfast, which will be switched
to continental breakfast.
"We're allowing students to
have a full range of meals, but
just not in their own houses,"
Guy said. Students are "inconve
nienced a little," but he said he
has received few complaints.
And for those days that Food
Service closes down, there won't
be much food at Tresidder either,
since it has had to reduce its bud
get by 20 percent, or $227,000.
"We've identified 25 days of
the year that Tresidder is not very
busy, such as on holidays and
interim days," said Tresidder
Director Roberta Braden. On
those days, Tresidder will be
closed.
Another major cut made was in
the Office of Student Affairs,
which runs programs out of
Tresidder. Every program — such
as the lunchtime concerts and
Coffee House programs — have
been eliminated, except for the
Holiday Faire and ballroom danc
ing.
The Office of Residential Edu
cation has also cut programs,
along with some residence staff.
The combined effects of earlier
repositioning and last year's bud
get cuts amounts to a 30 percent
decrease.
"The guiding philosophy has
been to preserve, to the extent
possible, the RAs and the RFs,"
said Alice Supton, the director of
residential education.
However, one resident fellow
had to be eliminated last year, and
another one will be eliminated

this year. In addition, the number
of resident assistants in upper
class dorms has been reduced by
one each, and funds for guest
speakers and other programs
have also been cut back.
The 20 percent cuts in the
entire University library system
have translated into fewer staff
members. In addition, the entire

reference service at Meyer
Library has moved into Green
Library. While collections and
reserves still operate out of
Meyer, the University may turn
the undergraduate library into a
24-hour study space this year.
"We haven't taken (library ser
vices) away, but we have reconfig
ured them," said Karen Nagy,

director of library academic and
information systems.
She said the only service lost in
restructuring are the instruction
al referenceMibrarians who aided
students through their research
process.
Improvements in sight
But for many of the weakened

services, solutions are in the
works. In the next few years, the
Financial Aids Office hopes to be
able to otter students financial aid
information through computers,
similar to the registration and
academic information offered on
Axess.
Departments are solving some
of the budget problems through
less personalized service. While
some remedies — such as having
no financial aid advisors on call —
have inconvenienced students,
others have actually made stu
dents' lives easier.
The most recent improvement
has been the Axess system, which
was put into place a year ago.
Being able to access full infor
mation about their records so eas
ily has been a boon for students.
"It's easier to access information
on the computers. You don't have
to stand in line," said sophomore
Kent Burke.
Acting registrar Jack Farrell,
who is a freshman advisor, said
his advisees and advising associ
ate really appreciate the conve
nience of Axess.
A survey of the 500 students
who tested out Axess last spring
quarter found that most users
were generally "very ethusiastic."
And some of the money Resi
dential Education managed to
save through streamlining has
been put toward the purchase of
new computers and scanners for
the dorm clusters.
The Macintosh SEs that were
in the dorms were simply too old,
said Jeff Merriman, the director
of residential computing. They
were replaced with Mac LC ll's
over the summer, and those will
probably be replaced newer mod
els within three years.

Fewer advisers, longer lines and shorter hours have been a few of the effects budget cuts have had on
student services in the year since the University announced its $43-million budget reduction plan.
