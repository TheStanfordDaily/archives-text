GM found negligent
ATLANTA (AP) — A jury found the
nation's biggest automaker negligent
yesterday in the fuel-tank design of a
General Motors pickup truck and
awarded $105.2 million to the parents
of a teen-ager killed in a fiery 1989
crash.
The Fulton County State Court jury
awarded 17-year-old Shannon Moseley's
parents $101 million in punitive dam
ages and $4.2 million for the value of his
life. The parents' lawyer had asked for
$100 million in punitive damages.
GM attorney Fred Bartlit told jurors
the verdict itself was already "a crushing
blow" to the company.
The company did not immediately say
whether it would appeal. Georgia law
gives the judge the option to increase or

lower a jury award, but Judge A.L.
Thompson did not say whether he
would.
U.S. productivity up 2.7%
WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans'
productivity climbed 2.7 percent last
year, the most in two decades, according
to a government report that raised hopes
that a long-awaited rebound in the
nation's competitive standing is at hand.
In a torrent of good economic news
yesterday, other reports showed:
•The nation's retailers had surpris
ingly strong sales in January;
•U.S. factories in December enjoyed
their biggest surge in orders in 17 months;
•After rising for three straight weeks,
new claims for unemployment benefits
finally eased a bit in late January.
