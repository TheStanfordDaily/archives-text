## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Congress
approved a bill late last night guarantee
ing workers up to 12 weeks unpaid leave
for family emergencies after shoving aside
a Republican effort to link the measure to
the military's ban on homosexuals.
The White House scheduled a cere
mony this morning for President Clin
ton to sign into law his first major bill
since taking office.
After three days of debate, the Senate
approved the so-called family leave bill
71-27 after defeating a GOP attempt to
bog the measure down with an amend
ment codifying the military's gay ban.
The House, staying late to rush the
bill to Clinton, approved it by a vote of
247 to 152.
"It's a down payment for working fam
ilies," Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said of the bill. "They have an adminis
tration and a Congress on their side."
But Republicans who opposed the bill

on grounds it would hurt business com
plained that Democrats were ramming
the bill through.
"We're doing this all because we have
to have a 'photo op' at 9:30 a.m. at the
White House," said Rep. Bob Walker, R-
Penn.
Clinton had asked Congress to hurry
on the measure, which was vetoed twice
by former President Bush.
In addition to granting workers up to
12 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of
a child, adoption or a family health
emergencies, the measures ensures they
have the same job, or an equivalent
post, when they return. Companies with
less than 50 workers are exempt.
Before its final vote, the Senate defeat
ed a GOP attempt to give employers more
say on when employees could take half
days off for medical emergencies. That
provision, identical to one tacked on by
the House, went down 59-39.

With final action, the family leave bill
would be the first legislation to pass the
103 rd Congress as well as the first to hit
Clinton's desk.
The House passed the bill late
Wednesday. It got temporarily side
tracked as the Senate took a four-hour
respite to debate a Republican-led effort
to block Clinton's plan to lift the ban on
gays in the military.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas shot back at those who scolded
him for forcing the gays debate. He said
the family leave bill won't become law
for six months so delaying debate for a
half-day "I don't think is going to bring
the country to a stop."
During the gays debate, the Senate
adopted a non-binding resolution that
approves Clinton's compromise with
Democratic congressional leaders tem
porarily suspending the formal discharge
of homosexuals from the military.
