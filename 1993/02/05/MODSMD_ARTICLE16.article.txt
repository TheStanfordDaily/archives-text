Ice-T s Stanford speech
reflects anti-intellectual
streak among students

Movie actor, rap star
and homeboy Ice-T, author
of the controversial rap
song "Cop Killer," is coming to
town, and he's gonna tell Stanford
what it's like defending the First
Amendment and getting down and
dirty with Tipper and Jesse Helms.
Maybe he'll even perform for us.
Maybe not — the ASSU isn't
paying him that much.
But they are paying him more
than the customary traveling costs.
The ASSU voted unanimously,
without debate, to compensate Ice-
T $4,000 in addition to travel costs
for gracing our campus, and to give
his expert opinion on freedom of
expression.
While Ice-T did manage to stir up
quite a controversy with the lyrics
of his album "Body Count," which
denigrate women and border on an
incitement to violence, what
insightful contribution can he
make to the censorship debate with
regard to his work? That it's a free
country, and that "Cop Killer," by
advocating the murder of police
men, was an outlet for the frustra
tion of the entire black nation?
Those would be rather obvious
sentiments for $4,000. What is the
new angle that Ice-T is bringing to
Stanford? What will he offer that he
hasn't already said? Let's hope Ice-
T offers some original perspectives.
Roble RA Nicole Sanchez said
she spearheaded the effort to bring
Ice-T to campus in response to the
lack of debate on the censorship
issue involved in record-label advo
cate Tipper Gore's ascension to the
role of second lady. If that's the rea
son for his visit to Stanford, then
there's a wide range of better choic
es. Invite Tipper Gore herself, or a
lawyer from the ACLU; invite
Frank Zappa or John Denver, who
both testified to Congress against

record-labeling; maybe even invite
Jesse Helms. Get a Supreme Court
justice to come, or try for any judge.
These people demonstrate knowl
edge, experience and thoughtful
contributions to this issue.
But, of course, most people don't
care what Ice-T is going to say, as
long as they see him in person.
Look at some of the recent
speakers past or slated: Branner
Presents kicked off two weeks of
trivia by inviting the Naked Guy,
Andrew Martinez, to speak. The
creators of the yo-yo and Crystal
Pepsi are also on the docket. White
Plaza had its biggest crowd in
months with (surprise — more
nudity!) Pete Huyck shaving his
rear while a panel discussing Native
American Issues, which included
some very distinguished figures in
Native American policy, had a
sparse turnout.
What we have are some of the
brightest students in the country
trying very hard not to be nerdy.
Witness the prevalence of those
who claim not to study (or not that
much anyway). See also the fact
that, in some dorms, the only show
with a consistent viewership is
"Beverly Hills 90210."
This laid-back sensibility is not
bad in moderation. It's natural that
people want to get away from per
petually analyzing weighty issues,
literary works and lab data. Yet
earnest anti-intellectualism erodes
the potential for meaningful discus
sions and new insights.
People don't want to get involved
with activities they anticipate to be
overly scholarly. But Ice-T is cool,
and we are eager to extract what
philosophy we can, to justify his
visit. We don't want to become
more educated outside of the class
room unless the lessons are taught
by the rich and famous. Any intel
lectualism other than the random
is uncool.
So, invite Ice-T to give a concert
(he'd have to sell his own tickets) or
even be a member of a panel to dis
cuss issues. But just because he has
a right to make a ruckus doesn't
mean we have to glorify it.
