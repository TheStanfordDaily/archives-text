TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER,
at one time or another, this space
is occupied by protracted personal
statements.
Instead of having the reader try to
decipher just which columnist I am ( Is
he the sports guy? Sorry, no. The weird,
off-kilter, random humorist? Only in my
dreams. Asian angst? Counter question:
Do you like your liver where it is? Anti
feminist, conservative reactionary? This
isn't the Review, kids. Voice of the
unheard masses? If they are and remain
unheard, who cares? Cynical anarchist
with a chip on his shoulder? I've been
called worse. Now back to the sen
tence.), I'll lay it all out for you in the
most succinct way that I can.
My personal statement is as follows:
I don't think overly much about
myself.
I think even less about other people.
What this means is that I don't give a
rat's ass if you like to have sex with
turnips or if your people have been
oppressed for millions of years by the
CIA. I didn't do it (except for the turnip
part). Perhaps, if I am not part of the
solution, then I am part of the problem,
but I doubt it.
I am in favor of anything that allows
anyone to do whatever he or she wants,
as long as it doesn't keep me from doing
whatever I want.
Maybe that's a Rousseauian utopia,

but CIV was just too long ago and my
books are at home being gnawed by rats.
I think that People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals has admirable
goals, but their movies make me queasy.
That's about all there is, so now I'll
segue into a brief column.
I am not a pre-med. I haven't taken
many classes with pre-meds. I know a
few pre-meds. I think some pre-meds
are silly. I think pre-med books are
silly.
It all goes back to get-rich-quick
schemes on the comics page of the Sun
day paper. How can you earn $20,000 a
year and work only 10 hours a week?
Send in $10 and receive a pamphlet on a
guaranteed scheme.
Answer: put an ad in the local funny
pages telling people how they can earn
$20,000 a year . . . blah, blah, blah.
My friend who is a pre-med, let's call
him Heinrich, bought a book called How
to Get into Med School in the 90's writ
ten by a bunch of doctors who probably
can't practice anymore because of mal
practice.
These guys weren't from Harvard
Med or any of the other big guns, but
rather they were from decent, but not
stellar, med schools.
For all you pre-meds out there, I will
now summarize the entire book in the
next few paragraphs, so perk up and pay
attention.

Be yourself when writing the admis
sions essays and at the interview (No!
gasp! I was going to pretend to be a para
plegic turtle).
In college play a team sport so that
the schools will know that you are a
"team player" (gee, I really like bad
minton, but I should play a team sport
like ice hockey so that the schools will
realize that I can work with others coop
eratively).
Also, be articulate and clear in the
interview (so much for my plan to get
blasted and then spew on my interview
er). The book then goes on to list a
bunch of questions that may be asked
during an interview, such as, "When
was the last time you masturbated" (I
am now . . . ), "When was the last time
you had sex?" (I have this turnip garden
. . . ), and a bunch of other questions the
answer to which are, in polite company,
"Bite me."
That's all there is to it. I just saved
you pre-meds something on the order of
$10, so please mail me $5 and then we'll
call it even.

Kenny Mai is a senior majoring in Elec
trical Engineering. His column will
appear Fridays.
