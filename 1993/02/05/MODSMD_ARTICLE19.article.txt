Staid cheerleaders, plucky band both worthy of support

IN BETWEEN TAKING POT-shots
At the Band and dollies, David
Carder (and 44 football players [!])
responded to the Jan. 22 editorial diss
ing the cheerleaders, but really missed
the point concerning the strong feelings
about the cheerleading squad which are
felt in many quarters. The fundamental
problem, regardless of whose fault it is,
is that the Stanford sports crowds don't
respond well to the cheerleaders.
Few people will fault the cheerlead
ing squad for their dedication and
enthusiasm. You'll see them out on the
fields and gyms practicing cheers, gym
nastic stunts and card flashing for
hours on end.
But the crowds don't respond. The
yell leaders devote a lot of attention to
hopping, clapping and yelling in rhythm
in front of crowds. But the crowds still
don't respond. Yes, as Carder puts it,
they may "valiantly try to address the
lack of crowd participation" at football
and basketball games. But it is a valiant
effort that, after several years, still
doesn't work. Why?
Part of it is the fans. A large propor
tion of the Stanford sports crowds are
fair-weather friends at best, happy to
stand up and yell when they see great
feats, but rarely willing to catalyze
these feats by standing and yelling.
Another problem, though, is a lack of
effective cheerleading. Cheerleaders
need spirit, enthusiasm, energy and
effective ways to work a crowd. But
they've spent years doing the same
kinds of traditional set formations with
automaton motions, stilted chants and
elaborate stunts that have lost the
audience's attention before they are
even executed.
Watch Psycho-Fan at basketball
games. He generates more crowd ener
gy than the entire cheerleading squad.
Why? Because his enthusiasm and
energy look real, even without a color
matched cardinal outfit, artifice or pre

tense. Cheerleaders: if you want crowd
response, then be cheer leaders. Crowd
the sidelines until you're pushed back
by security, yelling at the top of your
voice for the entire game. Not chanting
"Dee (pause) Fense (pause) Clap
(pause) Clap (pause) Dee (pause) Fense
(pause) Clap (pause) Clap (pause)" in a
perfect 4-4 meter.
Look people in the eye and scream
like you're more psychotic than they
are and dare them to top you. Run into
the crowd and yell at lame sunbathers
to get off their butts and make noise.
Wrap a red bandanna around your
head to soak up the sweat, and be in
the front rows of the basketball back
board seats disrupting the opponent's
free-throw shooters. Cover yourself
from head to toe in maroon face paint
and red hair color that has run and
stained half your T-shirt by game-end
because you were too busy looking
genuinely enthused to notice. Be visi
ble at times other than your allotted
time-outs.
Think of Homer Simpson when he
was mascot for the Springfield Isotopes.
Dare to be stupid in the cause of getting
people involved in the noise. Do flag
boy and flip boy and the time-out flip
flop get good yells? If so, work them up
more. Is that yell that starts with a uni
son "O-Kay" meeting with resounding
silence? Then don't beat a dead horse.
Is this your image of a rousing
national-cheer-squad-of-the-year preci
sion unit? Maybe not. Will it get more
people on their feet? Maybe. Probably.
At any rate, cheerleaders, your entire
approach to cheerleading and crowd
rousing doesn't seem to be working.
Are you going to keep doing the same
style of cheers year after year, to
mediocre response, or are you going to
try different things and new approaches
to find out what does work? Getting
people to make noise — that's what it's
supposed to be all about, isn't it?

Getting back to the letter, I'm
amazed that Carder (representing half
the football team) can write with a
straight face, criticizing The Daily for
"attacking a small student group," and
decrying such "an irresponsible petty
display." Meanwhile, his letter is an
utterly unsubtle attack upon the
LSJUMB and the dollies, making a
ludicrous attempt to seize a moral high
ground with a few minutiae, most of
them utterly irrelevant, about the dol
lies.
In response, I must state that the
Band (including the dollies) is one of
the most loyal groups of fans that Stan
ford Athletics has ever or will ever see.
They are always there, even during the
seasons when the teams rarely win.
They are the kind of fans that, after the
'89 earthquake, spent the following
days putting together scripts and props,
including a 300-pound Monty Python
Trojan Rabbit, for their shows in a
game against Utah attended by less
than 20,000.
They go to football and basketball
road games without a per diem, sleep
ing four to a room and always have
more people wanting to go than can be
taken along. They make a lot of noise at
games. They think up 10 different ways
to yell "De-Fense" and keep it up
through an entire 45-second clock or
time-out. Do they have games, halftime
shows and seemingly at times whole
seasons where the concepts come up
flat and the crowd isn't all that
impressed? You bet. Do they stay with
those bad shows or ideas and keep try
ing to force them to work over and over
again? No.
Frankly, Carder doesn't appear to
know a damn thing more about the
dollies and the Band than he does
about the cheerleaders. He even
stretches his questionable essay by
claiming, as a regular attendee of bas
ketball games, that he has failed to

ever hear groans about the cheerlead
ers, save from the band, and that the
crowd usually increases its cheers,
stomping and clapping when they
appear. Uh huh.
It is admirable that Carder, et al,
would come to the defense of one of the
more universally persecuted organiza
tions on campus. It seems a shame that
they couldn't leave it at that and added
in an innuendo-filled, apparently unre
searched attack upon some of the most
loyal supporters of Stanford sports.

Staid cheerleaders, plucky band both worthy of support

IN BETWEEN TAKING POT-shots
At the Band and dollies, David
Carder (and 44 football players [!])
responded to the Jan. 22 editorial diss
ing the cheerleaders, but really missed
the point concerning the strong feelings
about the cheerleading squad which are
felt in many quarters. The fundamental
problem, regardless of whose fault it is,
is that the Stanford sports crowds don't
respond well to the cheerleaders.
Few people will fault the cheerlead
ing squad for their dedication and
enthusiasm. You'll see them out on the
fields and gyms practicing cheers, gym
nastic stunts and card flashing for
hours on end.
But the crowds don't respond. The
yell leaders devote a lot of attention to
hopping, clapping and yelling in rhythm
in front of crowds. But the crowds still
don't respond. Yes, as Carder puts it,
they may "valiantly try to address the
lack of crowd participation" at football
and basketball games. But it is a valiant
effort that, after several years, still
doesn't work. Why?
Part of it is the fans. A large propor
tion of the Stanford sports crowds are
fair-weather friends at best, happy to
stand up and yell when they see great
feats, but rarely willing to catalyze
these feats by standing and yelling.
Another problem, though, is a lack of
effective cheerleading. Cheerleaders
need spirit, enthusiasm, energy and
effective ways to work a crowd. But
they've spent years doing the same
kinds of traditional set formations with
automaton motions, stilted chants and
elaborate stunts that have lost the
audience's attention before they are
even executed.
Watch Psycho-Fan at basketball
games. He generates more crowd ener
gy than the entire cheerleading squad.
Why? Because his enthusiasm and
energy look real, even without a color
matched cardinal outfit, artifice or pre

tense. Cheerleaders: if you want crowd
response, then be cheer leaders. Crowd
the sidelines until you're pushed back
by security, yelling at the top of your
voice for the entire game. Not chanting
"Dee (pause) Fense (pause) Clap
(pause) Clap (pause) Dee (pause) Fense
(pause) Clap (pause) Clap (pause)" in a
perfect 4-4 meter.
Look people in the eye and scream
like you're more psychotic than they
are and dare them to top you. Run into
the crowd and yell at lame sunbathers
to get off their butts and make noise.
Wrap a red bandanna around your
head to soak up the sweat, and be in
the front rows of the basketball back
board seats disrupting the opponent's
free-throw shooters. Cover yourself
from head to toe in maroon face paint
and red hair color that has run and
stained half your T-shirt by game-end
because you were too busy looking
genuinely enthused to notice. Be visi
ble at times other than your allotted
time-outs.
Think of Homer Simpson when he
was mascot for the Springfield Isotopes.
Dare to be stupid in the cause of getting
people involved in the noise. Do flag
boy and flip boy and the time-out flip
flop get good yells? If so, work them up
more. Is that yell that starts with a uni
son "O-Kay" meeting with resounding
silence? Then don't beat a dead horse.
Is this your image of a rousing
national-cheer-squad-of-the-year preci
sion unit? Maybe not. Will it get more
people on their feet? Maybe. Probably.
At any rate, cheerleaders, your entire
approach to cheerleading and crowd
rousing doesn't seem to be working.
Are you going to keep doing the same
style of cheers year after year, to
mediocre response, or are you going to
try different things and new approaches
to find out what does work? Getting
people to make noise — that's what it's
supposed to be all about, isn't it?

Getting back to the letter, I'm
amazed that Carder (representing half
the football team) can write with a
straight face, criticizing The Daily for
"attacking a small student group," and
decrying such "an irresponsible petty
display." Meanwhile, his letter is an
utterly unsubtle attack upon the
LSJUMB and the dollies, making a
ludicrous attempt to seize a moral high
ground with a few minutiae, most of
them utterly irrelevant, about the dol
lies.
In response, I must state that the
Band (including the dollies) is one of
the most loyal groups of fans that Stan
ford Athletics has ever or will ever see.
They are always there, even during the
seasons when the teams rarely win.
They are the kind of fans that, after the
'89 earthquake, spent the following
days putting together scripts and props,
including a 300-pound Monty Python
Trojan Rabbit, for their shows in a
game against Utah attended by less
than 20,000.
They go to football and basketball
road games without a per diem, sleep
ing four to a room and always have
more people wanting to go than can be
taken along. They make a lot of noise at
games. They think up 10 different ways
to yell "De-Fense" and keep it up
through an entire 45-second clock or
time-out. Do they have games, halftime
shows and seemingly at times whole
seasons where the concepts come up
flat and the crowd isn't all that
impressed? You bet. Do they stay with
those bad shows or ideas and keep try
ing to force them to work over and over
again? No.
Frankly, Carder doesn't appear to
know a damn thing more about the
dollies and the Band than he does
about the cheerleaders. He even
stretches his questionable essay by
claiming, as a regular attendee of bas
ketball games, that he has failed to

ever hear groans about the cheerlead
ers, save from the band, and that the
crowd usually increases its cheers,
stomping and clapping when they
appear. Uh huh.
It is admirable that Carder, et al,
would come to the defense of one of the
more universally persecuted organiza
tions on campus. It seems a shame that
they couldn't leave it at that and added
in an innuendo-filled, apparently unre
searched attack upon some of the most
loyal supporters of Stanford sports.
