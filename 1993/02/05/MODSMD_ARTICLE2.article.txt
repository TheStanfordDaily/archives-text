Slots in the ticket lottery for
rap artist Ice-T's Feb. 20 appear
ance will be available in White
Plaza Monday and Tuesday ac
cording to speech organizer Nicole
Sanchez.
Only students, faculty and staff
will be able to enter the lottery.
"No outsiders will gain admis
sion," Sanchez said. "This is for
Stanford only."
The speech will be held in the
400-seat Cubberly Auditorium
and broadcast live on the Univer
sity's cable television system.
Both the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network and the
Stanford Instructional Television
Network will carry the speech.
Ice-T has been criticized for the
questionable content of some of
his material, but is most widely
known for his song "Cop Killer,"
which sparked police protests and
efforts to ban the single from radio
air-play. Perhaps responding to
such pressure, Ice-T's record
label, Time-Warner, dropped the
artist last week.
The ASSU Senate last week
unanimously approved $4,000 in
funding for the speech. The Stan
ford Concert Network and Roble
Hall will foot the rest of the ap
proximately $6,500 cost — $5,000
of which will go to Ice-T.
Ice-T is expected to discuss top
ics pertaining to his career experi
ences, including the nature of the
criticism he received, his objec
tives as an artist, and free speech
and the attempts to limit it.
