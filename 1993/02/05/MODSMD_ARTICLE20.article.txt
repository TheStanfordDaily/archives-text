# Letters Policy
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes letters from
its readers. Letters will be published
at the editor's discretion and are
subject to editing. All letters must
include the author's name, phone
number and Stanford affiliation, if
any. Submissions with more than
five signatures must designate a rep
resentative.
Letters should be turned in on a
Macintosh disk in Microsoft Word
format with a paper copy of the sub
mission. Disks should have the
owner's name written clearly on the
front and may be picked up two busi
ness days after they have been
dropped off.
Submissions are published on a
space-available basis at the discre
tion of the Opinions editors.
Bring letters to The Daily's
offices in the Storke Publications
Building, fax them to (415) 725-1329
or mail them to: Letters to the Edi
tor, The Stanford Daily, Storke Stu
dent Publications Building, Stan
ford, CA 94305.
