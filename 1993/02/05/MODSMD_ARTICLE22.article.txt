# Joel Stein: Perfume for Reality

### 
cK^PECTACLE

PURE SPECTACLE. WHEN 500 PEOPLE
showed up at White Plaza to watch men in
bad wigs shave Pete Huyck's gluteus max
imus, spectacle was already thick in the air.
But when the dollies got down on all fours
to thrust their own gluteus maximi to the
music of should-be-forgotten '70s rock
bands played by wind instruments — well,
then spectacle simply stole the show from
Norelco.
So drop the computer science major
and burn the law school applications.
What the '90s itch for is public-relations
experts. They want people who can
dream up Zoo TV — and justify it with
words like "cyberpunk."
Better yet, they want people who go the
whole nine yards (yes, nine) and make real

spectacle. Fireworks. Top 40. Years of sur
gical skin-lightening. Thousands of people
holding colored construction paper in the
shape of giant, mutant, raciaily-Benet
tonized children. Now that's spectacle.
Seems as if the whole world is demand
ing an interdisciplinary in PR. Just
think, Pete Huyck spent an entire night
making sandwiches — and calling every
person he knew in the Directory, begging
them to come. Turns out PR is more than
shaving your ass — it's hard work. Not to
mention cajoling males into smearing
foamy Gillette on your rear-end. The least
the university could do is give the boy a
unit. It kind of looked like he could use one.
Imagine, classes in crowd-control.
When 18-year-old Stanford students are
dropping trou to support a UC-Berkeley
student, why not give them a hand? And
if Barbara Streisand bears the majority of
her breasts to introduce our new presi
dent, well, who are we to look away? After

all, what could be more spectacular than
breasts? Applause. Applause. Cough.
Jobs, good, high-paying PR jobs, are
popping up everywhere. It doesn't matter
for who, as long as the PR is good
enough: It really doesn't matter who the
ringleader is, as long as the clown show is
big enough. Example One: The E Chan
nel gives butt-bongo innovator Howard
Stern his own TV show, while New Line
Cinema lays out cash for a full-length
movie of his slightly-underdeveloped
"Fartman" character. Example Two: At
the very same time that Huyck was shin
ing himself up, former antichrist Keith
Rabois was visiting from his new home at
Harvard Law, nonchalantly roaming
around campus like parole was suddenly
up, and people didn't do anything more
than point and giggle, probably willing to
pay money to see him make a funny
speech. Example Three: In the new, big
ger, louder world, even Hitler can be

rehistoricized as the Überßarnum, as
neo-nazis with bad musical taste — left
with no one interesting to steel-toe-kick
around — try to make do with Turks.
Some people — Pete, of course exclud
ed — could really use a couple of courses
in that PR major. "Better to be wrong
than boring," a wise baby boomer once
said. And, it turns out, better to be point
less and naked than dressed and a G-Spot
editor. For, it seemed like the two editors,
who took the stage while Pete hobbled
back to the Deke house with his pants
and his body hair still around his ankles
— wanted the attention qua attention
just as badly as Pete. It became harder
and harder to discern exactly where spec
tacle ended and feminism began, but who
cares anyway? That line was blurred long
ago by Madonna, forcing Gloria Steinem
to roll around in the grave her publisher
lacks the heart to toss her into.
Spectacle is beautiful, it's American

and it's 100 percent MTV- sanctioned, so
why not canonize it here at Stanford?
Without spectacle, all the fun would be
revealed for the emptiness which could
never prop it up. And that wouldn't make
for good television, would it?
