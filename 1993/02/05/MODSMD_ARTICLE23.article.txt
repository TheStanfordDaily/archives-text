## Weatherford ready to backstroke into record books 
### Kay Hong Staff Writer 
Armed with only a Stanford tattoo, an interest
in organizational behavior and enough motor coor
dination to play a quality game of hoops, Derek
Weatherford has set his sights on a season that
most collegiate swimmers can only dream about. In
fact, the backstroke specialist from Ft. Meyers,
Florida has already set three new pool records, col
lected a multitude of first-place finishes in dual
meets and managed to rival newsworthy "signifi
cant other" Janel Jorgensen in terms of press cov
erage so far this season.
However, Weatherford's swimming career start
ed off on a slightly inauspicious note. "When I was
younger, I was always scared to leave my parents'
backs because I was really afraid of the water," he
claims. However, Weatherford's family moved to
Florida when he was eight, and his parents decided
that learning to swim would be a good safety mea
sure.
Seven years later, Weatherford missed a spot on
the 1988 Olympic team in the 200-meter back
stroke by 0.3 seconds. In a sport where athletes
"peak" in their early to mid-twenties, his perfor
mance as a 16-year-old was nothing short of
remarkable.
In 1992, Weatherford again tried for a spot on
the Olympic squad, but health problems limited his
amount of training and he again failed to make the
team. "In '88 I was a pretty immature swimmer,"
Weatherford said. "I was more nervous, and in '92
I had some physical problems. I'll definitely be
around for four more years though. I like to set
goals and achieve them, and I haven't had a chance
to realize that one goal.
"This year has been surprising — it's new to be
swimming so well during the season. We had a
meet at Texas earlier this season and I swam excep
tionally well. It wasn't just in a couple events — we
were swimming three events a day through a three
day weekend. [Coach] Skip [Kenney] and I have no
idea what my potential is and that's really excit
' _ M
ing.
According to Kenney, Weatherford is a swim
mer worth getting excited about. "He's awesome,"
Kenney claims. "He's a 'money' swimmer and
that's what a coach looks for — a guy who will
step up and give you a big swim right when you
need it.
"This year he's been absolutely dedicated to
hard work. That's how he's been successful in the
past and he doesn't really know any other way. He
complains in the pool, but he's really just venting

some of his excitement and energy. After he's done
complaining, he pushes off and swims like hell."
"It's exciting to swim well," Weatherford said.
"Not just for me personally, but when I look
around at my teammates and see the best collegiate
team in the country — in the country's history —
now that's exciting. It also helps that I happen to
be swimming well," Weatherford admitted.
Actually, Kenney feels that Weatherford is
swimming "well" enough to be "the only guy in the
country who has enough speed to break Jeff
Rouse's American record."
Weatherford was the first Cardinal swimmer to
claim the American record in the 200 backstroke
last year, only to have teammate Brian Retterer
and, subsequently, Cardinal Olympian Jeff Rouse
reset the mark.
"Last year, Derek, Brian and Jeff were all part of
a formula for success — they helped each other and
really worked well together," Kenney said. "But
Jeff's graduated and Brian's a redshirt this year
(due to injury). It's Derek's turn to break another
record.
"I'm convinced that he would've been on the '92
Olympic team if he hadn't been hospitalized for
kidney stones a couple times earlier that year. It
really hurt him mentally going into trials and not
being able to train hard. That's the kind of guy he
is. This summer he put in a lot of hard work and
was one of the top eight in the world in the back
stroke."
Sometimes Weatherford's and the team's enthu
siasm for their sport can overflow from the pool
into their everyday lifestyles, taking them to levels
that would be considered extreme by most athletes.
Weatherford and most of his teammates can be
seen sporting Stanford tattoos on their left hip,
running through campus clad only in their training
suits and sneakers, and exuberantly swimming
through "suit on head" naked practices every
Wednesday afternoon.
"We do a lot of things that people don't under
stand," Weatherford admitted. "We're so close as a
team that we're not embarrassed to do things like
that. I think most athletes on campus respect us
for our training and spirit."
And for their tenacity. After shedding some
excess weight and an unwanted affiliation with the
Pillsbury company (his frosh nickname was
"doughboy"), Weatherford has emerged as a super
star on a team comprised of standouts.
This weekend, Weatherford has another oppor
tunity to shine, and perhaps set another pool
record. Sports fans should be treated to two of the
best dual meets in Cardinal swimming history as
Stanford prepares to take on both USC and UCLA.
"We've got the eye of the tiger — we're ready to
kill," Weatherford said.
"We're really fired up and plan on swimming our
strongest line-up," Kenney agreed. "We'd love to
have a good crowd out there on both days — the
Band is planning to come out on Saturday. These
are our two biggest meets because of the USC and
UCLA rivalry — we haven't beaten USC in a dual
meet in three years."
But history won't repeat itself if Derek Weath
erford has anything to say about it. "I'm always
trying to improve," Weatherford said. "I plan on
going out of swimming with a bang. It's better to
burn out than to fade away."
