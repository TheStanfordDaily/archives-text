# Men's hoops declawed by Wildcats, 61-96

TUCSON- In the Valley of
the Sun, all the Stanford basket
ball team saw was the blackness
of night. No. 8 Arizona raced out
to a 15-2 lead in the first five
minutes of the game and never
looked back, blitzing the Cardi
nal 96-61 before a sold-out
crowd of 13,975 at McKale Cen
ter.
Guard Khalid Reeves hit a
three-pointer only 10 seconds
into the contest, sending a mes
sage early that Arizona's nine
game conference winning streak
at McKale would not be in jeop
ardy. The Wildcats led by as
many as 22 in the opening peri
od, as Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery shifted his lineup
several times in search of a com
bination that would work.
But to the Cardinal's misfor
tune, none did. After the break,
Arizona outscored Stanford by
15 on a series of plays that will
surely appear in Arizona's year
end highlight film. Wildcat
coach Lute Olson employed a
full court press that produced a
multitude of steals for guards
Damon Stoudamire and Khalid
Reeves.
"What you saw was a very
good Arizona team against a
not-so-good Stanford team,"
Montgomery said. "They com
pletely dominated us in every
phase of the game."
Stanford (6-14, 1-7 Pacific 10
Conference) was manhandled on
the boards by Arizona (14-2, 8-
0) on both ends of the floor. The
Wildcats enjoyed a 54-24
rebounding advantage, 38 of
which were defensive, therefore
limiting Stanford's scoring
opportunities.
As has been a recurring
theme all season, Stanford's
lack of strength inside was a
severe detriment. Starting cen
ter Jim Morgan fouled out with
only four points, and starting
forward Bart Lammersen like
wise had only four points. Lam
mersen and Darren Allaway,

who played in reserve despite a
sore ankle, also got into foul
trouble with four each. As a
result, Arizona big men Joseph
Blair and Ed Stokes, who fin
ished with 16 and nine points,
respectively, had what seemed
to be more room than the Grand
Canyon to maneuver inside.
Stanford was a dismal 8-for
-27 from the field in the first
half, and improved only slightly
in the second to finish the game
with a 35 percent mark. For
ward Brent Williams led the
charge of futility, managing to
convert only 3 of his 12 first
half attempts en route to a 5-of
-17 display on the night. Marcus
Lollie ended with an uncharac
teristic five points.
Stanford freshman guard
Dion Cross, in his second game
since moving into the starting
lineup, was the only Stanford
player not to be intimidated by
playing in McKale. He led the
Cardinal with 15 points—l 3 in
the second half—and made three
three-pointers even though
Reeves had a hand in his face.
"Dion was one of the few pos
itives," Montgomery said. "Get
ting Darren back on the floor
was the other."
But the best thing that
Montgomery could say about
this game was that it ended.
"Arizona is playing with a lot
of confidence—they're the best
team in the league," Mont
gomery said. "That was as poor
an effort that we've put into a
game in quite some time."

Al Green — Daily
Freshman forward Darren Allaway braved an ankle injury to tally five
points for the Cardinal, but his effort could not stave off an aggres
sive Arizona attack.
