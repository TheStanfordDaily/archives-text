# Women swimmers prepare for Texas
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
In the locker rooms yester
day, the co-captains of the
women's swim team, Janel
Jorgensen and Anne Mahoney,
prepared a huge chocolate chip
cookie in the shape of Texas.
The theme of their afternoon
practice was "Eat Texas," the
Cardinal's perennial archrival
at the NCAA Championships.
"We look forward to the
Texas meet every year," said
Stanford coach Richard Quick.
In the past four years, Stan
ford and Texas have swapped
holding the top spot at the
NCAA Championships. The
Cardinal won the crown in
1989, lost it for two years and
recaptured it last season.
"Everyone on this team
would love to repeat as nation
al champions," said senior
breaststroke specialist Lori
Heisick. "That means we have
to swim well against Texas this
weekend and give a tremen
dous team effort at the
NCAA's in five weeks."
In order to get past the
Longhorns this week the Car
dinal will have to face the likes
of Olympian Beth Barr and
Whitney Hedgepeth.
Both Hedgepeth and Barr
posted their best times in the
backstroke events last year.
Stanford will answer their
challenge in that event with
what has been touted as the
strongest backstroking core in
the nation, according to Quick.
Besides concentrating on
the overall victory, the Cardi
nal also hopes to post more
NCAA qualifying times at
Texas' fast pool. Due to
reduced water turbulence and
wave motion in the
Longhorns' pool, several world
and Olympic records have been

set there.
"We're going to try to capi
talize on the meet this week
end because they have a great
facility," Quick said. Thus far,
the Cardinal has qualified
swimmers in nine individual
events and two relays, with a
little less than half the season
to go.
However, before facing off
against the Longhorns, Stan
ford will first stop off at Dallas
today to take on SMU in hopes
of logging their fifth dual-meet
victory of the season.
The Mustangs are led by a
host of foreign Olympic
freestylists representing Den
mark and Belgium. At the fore
front is two-time Olympian
Gitta Jensen who finished
fourth in the 50-yard free, 100
free and 200 free at last year's
NCAA Championships.
Another Mustang threat is
freshman Berit Puggard, who
is fresh off the 1992 Danish
Olympic squad. She will be
competing in both the freestyle
and the butterfly events.
Swimming alongside Puggard
is Sandra Cam, an Olympian
who finished 10th in the 400-
meter free in Barcelona.
"In swimming against
SMU, I want to get there and
swim as few events as possible
and win," Quick said. "If possi
ble, everyone will swim one or
two of their best events, win
them and we'll have enough
points to win the meet. This
weekend we have to concen
trate on Texas."
If the No. 3 Cardinal defeats
the No. 2 Longhorns this week
end, Stanford might go up in
the rankings. However, Florida
will remain the No. 1 seed, even
though both Stanford and
Florida are undefeated this
year and the Cardinal is the
defending NCAA champion.
