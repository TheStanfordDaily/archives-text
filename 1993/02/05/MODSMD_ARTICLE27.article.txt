in the U.S. Winter Nationals at Colorado
Springs this weekend.
Currently ranked fourth in the nation,
Lynch aims to keep his position on the national
team and qualify for the World University

meet will not affect Lynch's collegiate record,
retaining a spot on the national team would
make him eligible for funding to cover training
expenses after his Stanford career.
"If he hits everything, I think he can win"
said coach Sadao Hamada of Lynch. The Cardi
nal men's team returns to action on Feb. 12
against San Jose State.
Fencing
The men's and women's varsity fencing
teams travel south this weekend to Pasadena,
where they will face their west coast com
petition one final time before Western Region
al next month.

to give the Titans the necessary number of regular
season matches to qualify for NCAA postseason
team competition. The Cardinal will then meet Cal
Tech, Long Beach State, UC-San Diego, UC-Santa
Cruz, and the Titans again on Saturday.
"Our key match-up is still Santa Cruz," said
women's coach Sherry Posthumus. "After that,
Fullerton, Long Beach and San Diego are all
equal, but not the strength of 'SC."
"Our team has very good spirit right now,"
Tulum said, referring to both the men's and
women's teams. "We have been working very
hard the last two weeks."
This last tournament of the regular season
should be an excellent warmup for the Western
Regionals, which will be hosted by UC-Santa
Cruz on March 6 and 7.

and senior wing Matt Tripp (sprained ankle).
