# Cardinal to tackle Sun Devils, Wildcats
## 
### Brian Border Staff Writer 
When the Stanford women's bas
ketball team actually loses a game, it
takes a while before the players are
allowed to forget about the defeat.
Last Saturday, the No. 9 Cardinal
suffered a 73-70 setback against
Washington on the road and, as a
result, practices this week have been
extra difficult. The workouts have
been characterized by an increase in
conditioning drills, serving as a
reminder that Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer does not accept
mediocre performances from her
squad.
"People ar e getting the message,"
VanDerveer said. "People have been a
lot more aggressive in practice."
The Cardinal seeks to get back on
track this weekend at Maples Pavilion
as it faces Arizona tonight and Ari
zona State on Sunday afternoon.
But as the Stanford squad has

already learned this season, it cannot
afford to take any Pacific 10 Confer
ence team lightly. Both Arizona
squads have pulled out some impres
sive victories this year, and Arizona
State even managed to upset the Car
dinal once last season.
"I like the competition in the Pac
-10," VanDerveer said. "There's not a
night where you can just show up.
Our team has to accept the chal
lenge."
VanDerveer also emphasized that
there is a great deal of competition
within the Cardinal squad as well,
since no player has a guaranteed
starting position.
"I'm looking for combinations of
people that [can] play both ends of the
floor and that work hard defensively,"
she said.
As a consequence, fans can expect
to see at least 10 Stanford players get
ting playing time during the contests.
"It makes everyone accountable for
the way they play all the time," Van-
Derveer said. "It gives me a lot of flex
ibility. We're not a five-person team."
Against both of this weekend's
offensive-minded opponents, Van-
Derveer will be looking out for the
Cardinal players who provide the best
defensive efforts. While Arizona looks
for freshman guard Keisha Anderson
(11.4 points per game, 4.6 assists per
game) to lead its charge, the Sun Dev
ils boast five players that average dou
ble figures in points.
Stanford will counter with its own
balanced attack led by Ail-American
Val Whiting. The senior center is
coming off yet another outstanding
performance this season as she scored
26 points and grabbed a career-high
19 rebounds in the loss to Washing
ton.
In addition, guards Molly Good
enbour and Christy Hedgpeth will
look to light it up from outside and
also dump the ball down low to for

wards Chris MacMurdo and Rachel
Hemmer.
The biggest key for Stanford, it
seems, will be whether it displays an
intense effort, free from mental
errors. Against Washington, the Car

dinal missed a handful of free throws
and committed several turnovers
down the stretch.
"We're not making the extra effort
we need to be making," VanDerveer
said. "We have a long way to go."


Al Green â€” Dally
Senior point guard Molly Goodenbour and the rest of the Cardinal team will
be increasing the intensity of their play a notch this weekend against Arizona
and Arizona State.
