# Tip allows cops to nab bike thief
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Minutes after receiving a call
from a witness who said he saw a
man stealing a $600 mountain bike,
Stanford Police captured the sus
pected thief after a brief wrestling
match yesterday morning.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, a Xerox
employee who was on campus to
service some equipment saw a
man breaking a u-lock off a stu
dent's mountain bike near the
Gilbert Biology Building at 10:15.
When the employee called the po
lice, the suspect jumped on the
bike and pedaled off to the center
of campus, Niemeyer said.
"We set up a perimeter and
tried to surround the general
area, to move to the center to flush
the guy out," Niemeyer said.
He said that Deputy Tim
Schreiner happened to be at the
corner of Santa Teresa and
Duena near Tresidder Union
when, "Lo and behold, here
comes the suspect on the stolen
bike. After he was told to halt, a
little wrestling match ensued â€”
the suspect lost. . . . Luckily we
were at the right place at the right
time."
Schreiner arrested 27-year-old
San Francisco resident Lance
Wiles, who will be booked on
counts of possession of stolen
property, grand theft bicycle and
resisting arrest. Niemeyer said
the police also recovered a large
number of tools from Wiles.
According to Niemeyer, the
suspect has a lengthy criminal
history, including burglary, theft
and drug-related offenses.
"We don't know how he got
here, whether he has a vehicle,"
Niemeyer said. "He's obviously
not talking.

"The moral of this story," he
said, "is that if someone sees a
theft and they call right away we
have a good chance of getting
some of these characters."
The alleged theft comes at a
time when the number of bike
thefts are rising. According to
Investigative Sgt. Del Bandy, the
department recorded 361 bike
thefts within the first six months
of 1992 when there were only 588
in all of 1991.
As with yesterday's incident,
the thefts are usually not commit
ted by members of the Stanford
community. "We have caught stu
dents [stealing bikes].. . but it's a
one shot deal," Bandy said. "I
don't think fellow students are
that big of a problem."
According to Bandy, people
outside campus come to Stanford
because it is a "nice big biking
community."
The place on campus where
the most bikes are stolen is Ford
Center, followed by Wilbur Hall,
Florence Moore Hall, Lagunita
Court and Toyon.
