# Stanford men's volleyball sets its sights on third victory over Bears this season

Here we go again.
For the third time in the past four
weeks the Stanford men's volleyball
team will take on California, except
this Saturday's match will be played at
the Bear's own Harmon Arena.
The Cardinal (4-1, 1-0 in Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation play) easily
dismissed Cal earlier in the season,
first in the UC-Santa Barbara tourna
ment and then in Burnham Pavilion
two weeks ago. Stanford won both
matches in straight games.
Cal, four-time defending club
national champion, is spearheaded by
senior outside hitter Scott Bishop, the
two-time club nationals MVP, who led
the team in kills last year. Other key
players include middle blocker Matt
Clark and setter Travis Turner.
Cal head coach Dave Nichols out

lined his three goals for the 1993
team: "To win club nationals, to com
pete at the same level as the NCAA
Division I teams and to beat Stan
ford." Tomorrow's game will be
Nichols' last chance to upend the Car
dinal.
For Stanford, next weekend begins
the brunt of its season. USC and Long
Beach State will come to Burnham to
kick off a schedule featuring 18 league
opponents in 19 matches over the next
two months.
Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves
is looking ahead to these more
formidable opponents. "We will play
this game as a dress rehearsal for next
weekend," he said.
Nieves' starting lineup against Cal
will likely be the same that takes the
floor against USC, and probably for
the rest of the season. The Stanford
starting six has been rotating con
stantly since the season began. Five of

'[Our goal is] ... to com
pete at the same level as
the NCAA Division I teams
and to beat Stanford.'

these positions are now set — with
Canyon Ceman at setter, David Goss
at outside hitter, Ryan Moos and Bob
Hillman at swing hitters and Joe
Burghardt at middle blocker.
John Bezmalinovic, John Hribar,
Brian Garrett and Mike Lambert are
still competing for the other middle
blocker position, and Saturday's
starter will not be determined until
after practice today.
According to Nieves, the other mid

die blocker will be chosen based on the
last week of practice, and the player's
health. "We've got five good middle
blockers. I'm just being fair to the
players [by waiting until today to
decide]."
It remains to be seen if this intra
squad competition creates bitterness
among teammates. "It depends on if
the player looks at it from the team
point of view or the individual point of
view," Nieves said. "They must think
of the team instead of themselves."
Currently, the Cardinal has only
one serious injury. Sophomore Eric
Wells has a hip-flexor pull, has not
practiced all week and will not play
this weekend. Next Monday is his tar
geted date of return.
The other injuries are less debilitat
ing. Burghardt has a bad back and
Hribar sat out of practice Wednesday
with muscle spasms. Both players will
compete tomorrow.
