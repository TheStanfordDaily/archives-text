# Sluggers look for tough clash against Fullerton's Titans
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
After cruising to consecutive
wins against St. Mary's to open
the season, the Cardinal baseball
squad should face its first real
test of the year this weekend
against Cal State-Fullerton.
Not that St. Mary's is that
bad of a squad. It's more that the
Titans could be that good.
"This is a huge series for us,"
said Stanford shortstop Todd
Laßocca. "If we can play well
now, we should be pretty confi
dent going into conference
play."
Fullerton, 46-17 last season,
came within a few bounces of
winning the College World
Series. Instead, it settled for a
No. 2 final ranking, its best since
winning the CWS in 1984.
Like the Cardinal, however,
Fullerton will be forced to
regroup after suffering losses at
several key positions.
Leading the roll call of depart
ed Titans is third baseman Phil

Nevin (22 home runs, 86 runs
batted in, .400 batting average
last year). Nevin, College Player
of the Year in 1992, was the first
player selected in the June pro
fessional draft.
Also departed via the draft are
Jason Moler (8, 62, .362) and
starting pitchers Dan Naulty
and James Popoff.
Overall, Fullerton returns
only four starters from last sea
son's squad. Centerflelder Dante
Powell, a Freshman All-Ameri
can last year, and senior speed
ster Jeremy Carr (.359, 17 stolen
bases) should provide punch for
the Titans.
Stanford, who dropped two of
three to Fullerton at home last
season, should continue to clear
up its own lineup situation this
weekend.
With the Titans planning to
start three right-handed pitch
ers, lefty third baseman Steve
Carver and switch-hitting frosh
Cale Carter should see plenty of
action for the Cardinal.
"This series will help us

answer a lot of questions," said
Stanford second baseman Jed
Hansen. "We might solidify
some of the positions that aren't
too clear yet."
One of those positions is the
No. 3 slot in the starting pitch
ing rotation. While juniors Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine
nailed down their spots in the

triumverate with solid outings
against St. Mary's, several can
didates have emerged for the last
opening. Freshmen Dan Reed
and Todd Bartels and senior
Greg Mix all have a shot at the
job.
Also, expect to see more jug
gling of the Stanford batting
order this weekend. While

catcher A.J. Hinch, first base
man Dusty Allen and left fielder
Nate Olmstead have secured the
3-4-5 spots in the lineup, the
rest of the order is still up in the
air.
"At this point, there's not
much difference between anyone
from the No. 2 to the No. 8 hit
ters," Laßocca said. "As the sea

son progresses, I'm sure things
will continue to change."
Laßocca cautioned against
reading too much into the team's
opening weekend successes.
"We got our feet wet, and we
played well," the sophomore
said. "But this is the first test,
the first top-10 opponent we
face."
