# Grapplers look to better individual seedings in final dual meets against Ducks, Bulldogs
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
With only two dual meets remaining
before the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, the Stanford wrestling team has
hit a crucial period in its season. Pac-10
individual tournament seedings will be at
stake and strategy preparation will be the
focus, as the Cardinal hosts division rival
Oregon today and top-10 opponent Fres
no State tomorrow.
Two Stanford grapplers hope to cap
ture seedings in the conference tourney
with victories over the Ducks. Junior co
captain Lance Johnson, who has a 6-1
dual meet record in the 142-pound weight
class, is one of the Cardinal hopefuls.
While nine wrestlers will compete in
each weight division in the Pac-10 Champi
onships, only the top four will receive seed
ings. While a victory by Johnson tonight
would go a long way toward earning him a
seed, he would not, be guaranteed a top-four
position by winning.
"There is little difference among the top
nine 142-pound wrestlers in the confer
ence," said Cardinal head coach Chris Hor
pel. "Their records are very similar, and
the main difference between them is who
scores enough points in the last 10 seconds
of a bout to win the match."
For 134-pound redshirt freshman
Jimmy Aguirre, the Pac-10 picture is

much simpler. A victoey would earn him a
perfect dual meet record of 8-0, and would
propel Aguirre to either the second or
third seed in the conference.
However, the freshman will confront a
greater challenge than Johnson. Corey
Sonnen will represent the Ducks in
Aguirre's weight class. In addition to
boasting a 20-5 record to lead Oregon,
Sonnen recently upset the 134-pounder of
the University of Pennsylvania, who was
ranked third in the nation.
A second or third seeding in the Pac
10's would prove more beneficial for
Aguirre than the fourth seed. If Aguirre is
not the top-ranked grappler, then his best
road to the finals would be as the second
or third contender, competing in the
bracket opposite that of the top seed.
No matter what happens, the two dual
meets will affect Stanford's entire squad
as well. Competing with Oregon and Fres
no State show how far the Cardinal has
progressed, in terms of wrestling skills and
conditioning. This weekend will also serve
as the time when grapplers develop and
perfect their new strategies for Pac-10's
and the NCAA Championships.
"There are always new techniques to
learn and incorporate, no matter how
many years you've wrestled," Horpel said.
"By this time in the year, you get a sense
of which techniques you are suited for,
and develop a strategy accordingly for

Pac-10's and NCAAs. "
The Cardinal is not overlooking the dual
meets themselves, however. Horpel expects
to prevail over the Ducks. According to the
coach, matchups appear advantageous.
Stanford features a stronger group in the
lighter weights, which should overcome
Oregon's edge in the heavier divisions.
The Cardinal will forfeit both the 177
and heavyweight classes. Stanford has no
heavyweight wrestlers, and freshman
Nathan Lovelle, who had been competing
at 177 pounds, has dropped back down to
his original 167 pounds in preparation for
the conference tournament.
Fresno State will prove much more dif
ficult, however. In addition to featuring
grapplers with winning records at nine of
the 10 weight classes, four nationally
ranked wrestlers lead the Bulldogs.
Harold Zinkin, at 134 pounds, is
ranked third and touts a 21-2 standing.
All-American 142-pounder Gerry Abas
(26-3) is ranked fourth, and 150-pounder
Surgei Mezheritsky (25-3) is 11th. Fres
no's All-American heavyweight is #lsb
ranked third in the nation.
"On paper, we're outclassed at almost
every weight," Horpel said. "We don't
have the manpower to win the dual, but
we have nothing to lose."
Both meets will take place at 7:30 p.m.
in Burnham Pavilion. As always, there will
be complimentary pizza and soft drinks.
