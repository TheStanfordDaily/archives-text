## From Trinitron to wide screen: reflections on a forehead 
### 
Back when the only hair on my chest
was lint from my Batman Jam
mies, hats were reserved for bad
hair days.
But some time since, the same Tooth
fairy who had once left me money when
a hunk of my mouth fell off sent in her
evil twin, who tore off a wad of my fore
lock and didn't even drop a dime in my
shoe.
The Follicle-fairy visited me quite
early, and now I wear hats all the time.
She made her first uninvited appearance
when I was about 17, somewhere
between Driver's Ed and the Princeton
Review.
Friends encouragingly asked me
which side of the family the bald mem
bers were on, hoping I'd say my father's.
But no such luck . . . I'm hosed on both
ends.
I felt cheated. Sure, this might have
happened eventually, but wasn't I sup
posed to have a few good years before I'd
find a sweater in my brush?
Denial helped, but didn't last. There
was no question that I was making my
way slowly from Trinitron to wide
screen.
Birthdays hit and things got worse. I
knew I was in trouble when I received my

fourth copy of the Rogaine tape from an
anonymous friend who still thinks she's
funny. Once Mom started talking about
it in restaurants, it was time to take
action. Why be passive, I thought. Nip it
now and save what you've got.
So Mom held my hand as we went to
the dermatologist. The doctor walked in
and I immediately noticed his strong
hairline. I felt a glimmer of hope and we
started talking options.
For all you men (or women) who were
wondering, but putting off worrying till
later, I'll recount what I learned:
We're screwed.
There's nothing we can do. And they'll
laugh while telling it to you. Sure there
are some treatments, but they sound

about as hokey as the Coyote's ACME
traps.
First, there's the extreme — plastic
surgery, a.k.a. "hair plugs." In this hair
brained scheme they yank a tuft off your
butt, or anywhere equally fuzzy, and sta
ple it to your head. Then the Roadrunner
will speed by, notice the hair and slow
down to get a better look. While he's con
founded by it's sudden emergence, you
can grab him.
Next up, there's good ol' Sy Sperling
and his Hair Club for Nazis. The strategy
here involves taking some hair from an
Irish Setter or some desperate homeless
person and slowly weaving it into your
own. They do this in stages so your
friends won't start swatting at your head
trying to kill whatever it is that landed
there.
Then there is everybody's favorite,
Mr. Minoxidil. You "shpritz six
shpritzes" twice a day onto a dry scalp —
preferably yours — and rub it in, guaran
teeing what little hair you have will look
like crap.
Of the choices, the damn spray looked
the most promising, so I went with it. If
you haven't viewed the übiquitous free
video, let me fill you ih.
The stuff works for about 47 percent

of those who use it, and they usually only
experience hair regrowth on the top of
the crown, not in front — where girls
who are shorter than you can see. And
don't go thinking that if it does work for
you that you're finished, because
"Rogaine is a treatment, not a cure." You
cease shpritzing and they'll jump ship —
Rogaine hairs are very devoted. And
expensive. A month's supply costs about
60 Yabbos. Hooked for life on a vanity
scam.
It comes with three nozzles: precision
spray if you've still got some; wide spray
if you've got more surface area to sow;
and finally, the demeaning roll-on ... if
you find yourself down to that you
might as well just get yourself a box of
crayons.
Now be careful, an occasional drop
might slide down the forehead and
implant itself between the eyes. So, while
it may not do diddly for your scalp, you
might still get the added bonus prize of a
fresh uni-brow.
It has been some time since my initial
panic; and I've since come to terms with
my hair, or rather, its slow departure. My
forehead has become a part of my own
self-schema.
It hasn't even been much of a problem

lately. I have lots of hats, I can still get
dates and if I ever get carded at a bar, I
can just lift the rim of my Jets cap and
then order up an Amstel Light.
I figure it's like this: hair is a road
sign for our animal nature. The more
primitive animals are the furrier ones.
Check our own bodies. We've got a
clump of curls on the spot that keeps us
closest to the primal (although I admit
tedly have no idea what to make of
armpit hair).
So if my head decides to go clean, I
take it as a sign that the one part of me
that has a shot at transcendence is
going for it. My brain is aiming beyond
my Neener and the consequences are
having my older brother's friends ask
me if I used to pick on him when he was
little.
Things like this shouldn't be a matter
of vanity or insecurity. Instead, they
should be chances to become comfort
able and happy with the goofy guy you
see in the mirror every so often. He'll be
there — zits, scars, nasal hairs and all,
whether you like it or not.
Sure I'd prefer it otherwise, but a
Wise One once said, "I am what I be."
Heck, Picard could kick Kirk's butt any
day.

there.
Then there is everybody's favorite,
Mr. Minoxidil. You "shpritz six
shpritzes" twice a day onto a dry scalp —
preferably yours — and rub it in, guaran
teeing what little hair you have will look
like crap.
Of the choices, the damn spray looked
the most promising, so I went with it. If
you haven't viewed the übiquitous free
video, let me fill you ih.
The stuff works for about 47 percent

of those who use it, and they usually only
experience hair regrowth on the top of
the crown, not in front — where girls
who are shorter than you can see. And
don't go thinking that if it does work for
you that you're finished, because
"Rogaine is a treatment, not a cure." You
cease shpritzing and they'll jump ship —
Rogaine hairs are very devoted. And
expensive. A month's supply costs about
60 Yabbos. Hooked for life on a vanity
scam.
It comes with three nozzles: precision
spray if you've still got some; wide spray
if you've got more surface area to sow;
and finally, the demeaning roll-on ... if
you find yourself down to that you
might as well just get yourself a box of
crayons.
Now be careful, an occasional drop
might slide down the forehead and
implant itself between the eyes. So, while
it may not do diddly for your scalp, you
might still get the added bonus prize of a
fresh uni-brow.
It has been some time since my initial
panic; and I've since come to terms with
my hair, or rather, its slow departure. My
forehead has become a part of my own
self-schema.
It hasn't even been much of a problem

lately. I have lots of hats, I can still get
dates and if I ever get carded at a bar, I
can just lift the rim of my Jets cap and
then order up an Amstel Light.
I figure it's like this: hair is a road
sign for our animal nature. The more
primitive animals are the furrier ones.
Check our own bodies. We've got a
clump of curls on the spot that keeps us
closest to the primal (although I admit
tedly have no idea what to make of
armpit hair).
So if my head decides to go clean, I
take it as a sign that the one part of me
that has a shot at transcendence is
going for it. My brain is aiming beyond
my Neener and the consequences are
having my older brother's friends ask
me if I used to pick on him when he was
little.
Things like this shouldn't be a matter
of vanity or insecurity. Instead, they
should be chances to become comfort
able and happy with the goofy guy you
see in the mirror every so often. He'll be
there — zits, scars, nasal hairs and all,
whether you like it or not.
Sure I'd prefer it otherwise, but a
Wise One once said, "I am what I be."
Heck, Picard could kick Kirk's butt any
day.

Back when the only hair on my chest
was lint from my Batman Jam
mies, hats were reserved for bad
hair days.
But some time since, the same Tooth
fairy who had once left me money when
a hunk of my mouth fell off sent in her
evil twin, who tore off a wad of my fore
lock and didn't even drop a dime in my
shoe.
The Follicle-fairy visited me quite
early, and now I wear hats all the time.
She made her first uninvited appearance
when I was about 17, somewhere
between Driver's Ed and the Princeton
Review.
Friends encouragingly asked me
which side of the family the bald mem
bers were on, hoping I'd say my father's.
But no such luck . . . I'm hosed on both
ends.
I felt cheated. Sure, this might have
happened eventually, but wasn't I sup
posed to have a few good years before I'd
find a sweater in my brush?
Denial helped, but didn't last. There
was no question that I was making my
way slowly from Trinitron to wide
screen.
Birthdays hit and things got worse. I
knew I was in trouble when I received my

fourth copy of the Rogaine tape from an
anonymous friend who still thinks she's
funny. Once Mom started talking about
it in restaurants, it was time to take
action. Why be passive, I thought. Nip it
now and save what you've got.
So Mom held my hand as we went to
the dermatologist. The doctor walked in
and I immediately noticed his strong
hairline. I felt a glimmer of hope and we
started talking options.
For all you men (or women) who were
wondering, but putting off worrying till
later, I'll recount what I learned:
We're screwed.
There's nothing we can do. And they'll
laugh while telling it to you. Sure there
are some treatments, but they sound

about as hokey as the Coyote's ACME
traps.
First, there's the extreme — plastic
surgery, a.k.a. "hair plugs." In this hair
brained scheme they yank a tuft off your
butt, or anywhere equally fuzzy, and sta
ple it to your head. Then the Roadrunner
will speed by, notice the hair and slow
down to get a better look. While he's con
founded by it's sudden emergence, you
can grab him.
Next up, there's good ol' Sy Sperling
and his Hair Club for Nazis. The strategy
here involves taking some hair from an
Irish Setter or some desperate homeless
person and slowly weaving it into your
own. They do this in stages so your
friends won't start swatting at your head
trying to kill whatever it is that landed
there.
