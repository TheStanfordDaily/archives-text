# From Columbia House to your nipples:
## 101 things to do with CDs 
### Josh Walker Editorial staff 
OK, it sounded good at first: eight discs for
a penny. All you had to do was buy eight more
at regular club prices over the next three
years, and they were your's. And if you
bought your first of those eight immediately,
you get two more free. What a deal!
But now that bliss of freshman year has
passed, freakin' Columbia House keeps send
ing you all the CDs you've never wanted.
