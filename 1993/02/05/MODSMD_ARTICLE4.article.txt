# Stretching dollars for growing communities

As Stanford becomes more ethnically
diverse, directors of the University's ethnic
centers say they are stretching the same
dollars and staff members to meet the
needs of a changing student body, sacrific
ing programming and quality of resources.
The ethnic centers "were always oper
ating at the margin with little budget and
staff and they are serving increasing
numbers of students," said Sharon Park
er, director of the Office of Multicultural
Development. "The emphasis, the call,
upon them increases as the budget re
mains the same."
Although the centers' fundings have

remained the same since the initial round
of budget cuts in 1989, the demand for
services has risen. This year 46 percent of
the freshmen come from minority
groups, compared to 42 percent last year.
Frances Morales, the director of El
Centro Chicano said the center has been
forced to address the issue of how to meet
rising demand since she does not foresee
a budget increase in the near future.
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center, said his center
feels the constraints of "very little growth
in an area where there is a great need be
cause the University is changing rapid
ly." Asian-Americans make up 24 percent
