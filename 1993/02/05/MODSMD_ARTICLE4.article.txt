# Stretching dollars for growing communities
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
As Stanford becomes more ethnically
diverse, directors of the University's ethnic
centers say they are stretching the same
dollars and staff members to meet the
needs of a changing student body, sacrific
ing programming and quality of resources.
The ethnic centers "were always oper
ating at the margin with little budget and
staff and they are serving increasing
numbers of students," said Sharon Park
er, director of the Office of Multicultural
Development. "The emphasis, the call,
upon them increases as the budget re
mains the same."
Although the centers' fundings have

remained the same since the initial round
of budget cuts in 1989, the demand for
services has risen. This year 46 percent of
the freshmen come from minority
groups, compared to 42 percent last year.
Frances Morales, the director of El
Centro Chicano said the center has been
forced to address the issue of how to meet
rising demand since she does not foresee
a budget increase in the near future.
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center, said his center
feels the constraints of "very little growth
in an area where there is a great need be
cause the University is changing rapid
ly." Asian-Americans make up 24 percent
of this year's freshman class.
Because prospects seem slim for a
funding increase in the near future, direc
tors said they have begun fund-raising
efforts outside of the University to aug
ment their budgets. Some said they have
begun working with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson on a long-term fund-rais
ing effort.
"We're currently working together with
the Development Office" to raise funds, said
Yuen. "But because of the last round of bud
get cuts, it's a little dicey in competing for
(outside) funding."
Although she is working with Jackson,
Morales said she does not have enough time
to devote to outside fund-raising efforts.
"That is the kind of work I would like to
devote more time to," she said.
According to the directors, much of the
allocated funding is used to run the centers
and provide resources to the ethnic commu
nities.
The hidden costs of running the centers
are a large component of the budget, said
Yuen. "The biggest issue involved is our
infrastructure needs, our basic day-to-day
operations," he said.
"The budget cutting process hasn't
allowed us to bring the resources for the stu
dents up to date as fast as we would like,"
said Barbara Smith, the acting director of
the Black Community Services Center. She
added that the BCSC still uses the Macin
tosh Plus, a computer that is no longer wide
ly produced or sold.
Supporting a staff
A large portion of each center's budget is
directed toward salaries. However, none of
the ethnic centers have achieved the level of
three full-time staff members required by
the 1989 University Committee on Minority

Issues report.
Yuen explained that the University has
followed through on a recommendation to
make the directors of the centers into full
time positions, but added that the Asian
American Activities Center has not received
the third staff member recommended by the
report.
Some of the centers have increased the
number of staff members since the budget
cuts took effect, but directors said they

have paid for those
increases through an
internal reallocation of
funds.
The BCSC has hired an
extra half-time staff mem
ber, after what Smith
called a "painful" internal
redistribution of funds.
The lack of funding is
"really affecting us in
staff," she said.
"We needed (the extra
staff) so badly we had to go
through that process," she
explained.
Similarly, El Centro
Chicano has redistributed
its money to upgrade its
office manager to an assis
tant director.
"The third [recommend
ed staff] position is way out
there. We don't know when
we'll see it," Morales said.
"Right now, we do a lot of
extra work."

She added that staff members work 10 to
14 hours a day, "taking the extra step in hopes
that our community will grow stronger.
Maybe someday we will get a third person and
we can go home at five."
Parker said employing interns and stu
dent volunteers could be one way of increas

ing the centers' staffs while remaining with
in their budget constraints. In addition, by
"wearing multiple hats and coordinating,
[the current staff members] can extend their
influence," she said.
Programming cuts
One of the areas most harmed by a lack of
funding, according to the directors, is pro
gramming. According to Jackson, the cen
ters do not have "the program support that

would have been available
without budget cuts."
Morales explained that
El Centro Chicano has had
to redirect program fund
ing to more immediate
needs.
"Before [the budget
cuts] we were in a position
to co-sponsor programs
with other communities or
students in our communi
ties, but now that money
has to go for supplies," said
Morales, adding that she
thinks the decline in the
amount of programming
has hindered community
building.
According to Smith, the
staff of the BCSC has
learned to "stretch dol
lars" when planning pro
grams. "Lack of funding
has encouraged us to look
at the way we do projects

and programming." she added.
Parker emphasized the importance of the
centers' University-wide events and pro
grams. "People tend to see the community
centers as only serving the groups in their
name," she said. "But that's not the way to
look at it because they serve the whole Uni
versity population."

there. We don't know when
we'll see it," Morales said.
"Right now, we do a lot of
extra work."

She added that staff members work 10 to
14 hours a day, "taking the extra step in hopes
that our community will grow stronger.
Maybe someday we will get a third person and
we can go home at five."
Parker said employing interns and stu
dent volunteers could be one way of increas

ing the centers' staffs while remaining with
in their budget constraints. In addition, by
"wearing multiple hats and coordinating,
[the current staff members] can extend their
influence," she said.
Programming cuts
One of the areas most harmed by a lack of
funding, according to the directors, is pro
gramming. According to Jackson, the cen
ters do not have "the program support that

would have been available
without budget cuts."
Morales explained that
El Centro Chicano has had
to redirect program fund
ing to more immediate
needs.
"Before [the budget
cuts] we were in a position
to co-sponsor programs
with other communities or
students in our communi
ties, but now that money
has to go for supplies," said
Morales, adding that she
thinks the decline in the
amount of programming
has hindered community
building.
According to Smith, the
staff of the BCSC has
learned to "stretch dol
lars" when planning pro
grams. "Lack of funding
has encouraged us to look
at the way we do projects

and programming." she added.
Parker emphasized the importance of the
centers' University-wide events and pro
grams. "People tend to see the community
centers as only serving the groups in their
name," she said. "But that's not the way to
look at it because they serve the whole Uni
versity population."

As Stanford becomes more ethnically
diverse, directors of the University's ethnic
centers say they are stretching the same
dollars and staff members to meet the
needs of a changing student body, sacrific
ing programming and quality of resources.
The ethnic centers "were always oper
ating at the margin with little budget and
staff and they are serving increasing
numbers of students," said Sharon Park
er, director of the Office of Multicultural
Development. "The emphasis, the call,
upon them increases as the budget re
mains the same."
Although the centers' fundings have

remained the same since the initial round
of budget cuts in 1989, the demand for
services has risen. This year 46 percent of
the freshmen come from minority
groups, compared to 42 percent last year.
Frances Morales, the director of El
Centro Chicano said the center has been
forced to address the issue of how to meet
rising demand since she does not foresee
a budget increase in the near future.
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center, said his center
feels the constraints of "very little growth
in an area where there is a great need be
cause the University is changing rapid
ly." Asian-Americans make up 24 percent
of this year's freshman class.
Because prospects seem slim for a
funding increase in the near future, direc
tors said they have begun fund-raising
efforts outside of the University to aug
ment their budgets. Some said they have
begun working with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson on a long-term fund-rais
ing effort.
"We're currently working together with
the Development Office" to raise funds, said
Yuen. "But because of the last round of bud
get cuts, it's a little dicey in competing for
(outside) funding."
Although she is working with Jackson,
Morales said she does not have enough time
to devote to outside fund-raising efforts.
"That is the kind of work I would like to
devote more time to," she said.
According to the directors, much of the
allocated funding is used to run the centers
and provide resources to the ethnic commu
nities.
The hidden costs of running the centers
are a large component of the budget, said
Yuen. "The biggest issue involved is our
infrastructure needs, our basic day-to-day
operations," he said.
"The budget cutting process hasn't
allowed us to bring the resources for the stu
dents up to date as fast as we would like,"
said Barbara Smith, the acting director of
the Black Community Services Center. She
added that the BCSC still uses the Macin
tosh Plus, a computer that is no longer wide
ly produced or sold.
Supporting a staff
A large portion of each center's budget is
directed toward salaries. However, none of
the ethnic centers have achieved the level of
three full-time staff members required by
the 1989 University Committee on Minority

Issues report.
Yuen explained that the University has
followed through on a recommendation to
make the directors of the centers into full
time positions, but added that the Asian
American Activities Center has not received
the third staff member recommended by the
report.
Some of the centers have increased the
number of staff members since the budget
cuts took effect, but directors said they

have paid for those
increases through an
internal reallocation of
funds.
The BCSC has hired an
extra half-time staff mem
ber, after what Smith
called a "painful" internal
redistribution of funds.
The lack of funding is
"really affecting us in
staff," she said.
"We needed (the extra
staff) so badly we had to go
through that process," she
explained.
Similarly, El Centro
Chicano has redistributed
its money to upgrade its
office manager to an assis
tant director.
"The third [recommend
ed staff] position is way out
there. We don't know when
we'll see it," Morales said.
"Right now, we do a lot of
extra work."

She added that staff members work 10 to
14 hours a day, "taking the extra step in hopes
that our community will grow stronger.
Maybe someday we will get a third person and
we can go home at five."

dent volunteers could be one way of increas
