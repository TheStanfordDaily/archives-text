# Deviant for a day

Junior Brian Bedell sits, dressed in full monk attire, in the Stanford Shopping Center yesterday after
noon. Bedell claimed to be completing a Social Psychology class assignment: 'The purpose is to see
what it's like to be deviant, and see how people react," Bedell said. So he shaved his head, rented a
robe and sat in a trancelike stupor for three hours as shoppers passed by. "People were amazingly
polite," Bedell said. "But they don't like to interact." Although he could not maintain the famed "Lotus
position," he stayed in two positions for the full three hours. "I left when my legs couldn't take it."
