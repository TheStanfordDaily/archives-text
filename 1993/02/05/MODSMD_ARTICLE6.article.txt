# Survey says:
## Alums still loyal, but embarrassed

Ninety-three percent of Stan
ford graduates would still choose
to attend the University if they
could go through their life again,
but half think the Farm has be
come too arrogant, according to a
recent survey conducted by the
Stanford Alumni Association.
Questioned on issues from ath
letics to budget cuts, the respon
dents overwhelmingly said they still
feel proud of their school. Of the
3,902 graduates who responded, 96
percent agreed that their Stanford
degree was a source of great pride.
However, recent negative sto
ries in the media have been a
source of chagrin for many alumni.
Sixty-seven percent of those polled
said they were "embarrassed by
the negative stories in the media

about Stanford." And 51 percent
agreed with the statement "Stan
ford has become too arrogant."
But even so, alumni officials
said fundamental loyalty to Stan
ford is still sound.
"There is an extremely high
level of confidence in the Universi
ty on the part of the alums," said
Bill Stone, president of the Alum
ni Association.
He added that alumni seemed
to truly appreciate "having the op
portunity to sound off," an indica
tion of their continuing interest in
the school.
About 7,500 graduates — 5 per
cent of all Stanford alumni — were
randomly selected to take part in
the 150-question survey, the first
poll of this magnitude since 1985.
