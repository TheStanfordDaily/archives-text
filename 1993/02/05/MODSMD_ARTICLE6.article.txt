# Survey says:
## Alums still loyal, but embarrassed 
### Sarah Katz 
Ninety-three percent of Stan
ford graduates would still choose
to attend the University if they
could go through their life again,
but half think the Farm has be
come too arrogant, according to a
recent survey conducted by the
Stanford Alumni Association.
Questioned on issues from ath
letics to budget cuts, the respon
dents overwhelmingly said they still
feel proud of their school. Of the
3,902 graduates who responded, 96
percent agreed that their Stanford
degree was a source of great pride.
However, recent negative sto
ries in the media have been a
source of chagrin for many alumni.
Sixty-seven percent of those polled
said they were "embarrassed by
the negative stories in the media

about Stanford." And 51 percent
agreed with the statement "Stan
ford has become too arrogant."
But even so, alumni officials
said fundamental loyalty to Stan
ford is still sound.
"There is an extremely high
level of confidence in the Universi
ty on the part of the alums," said
Bill Stone, president of the Alum
ni Association.
He added that alumni seemed
to truly appreciate "having the op
portunity to sound off," an indica
tion of their continuing interest in
the school.
About 7,500 graduates — 5 per
cent of all Stanford alumni — were
randomly selected to take part in
the 150-question survey, the first
poll of this magnitude since 1985.
On multicultural issues, nine
out of 10 respondents believed
that "diversity in the student body
enhances the Stanford education
al experience." In addition, 60 per
cent agreed that "Stanford's qual
ity of education has improved over
the last 10 years," and 69 percent
thought that "the changes Stan
ford is making in its curriculum
are needed to meet the challenges
of a changing world."
Other alumni expressed worry

in the comments section that
diversity is being achieved at the
expense of their own children.
However, three-fourths of the
respondents said Stanford should
not lower its admissions stan
dards for children of alumni. Fur
thermore, 96 percent believed
that standards should not be
changed to recruit students with
athletic talent.
Almost 90 percent of respon
dents felt that the University
should focus more on teaching
skills, with 41 percent saying that
Stanford places too much empha
sis on research. Seventy-one per
cent thought budget cuts would

hurt academic programs.
The survey also asked alumni
about their current lifestyles. Of
the 2,614 men and 1,288 women
polled, 27 percent consider them
selves conservative, 44 percent
moderate and 29 percent liberal.
Nearly 70 percent have children
and 38 percent have household
incomes of $100,000 or more.
The alumni association will use
the responses both to gain insight
into how alumni feel about impor
tant issues affecting Stanford and
to assess how well the association
is serving their needs.
The survey was mailed in three
waves, beginning with a postcard

sent to all selected alumni to alert
them that more was coming. They
then received the eight-page sur
vey, which generated a 39 percent
response. Six weeks later, they
were mailed the same survey
again, in order to bump up the
response and smooth out the
results. This third wave raised the
response to 52 percent.
"Direct mail [survey] is costly,
but it is really the best way, and the
three waves told people we were
serious," said Delia Van Heyst, the
survey organizer and director of
strategic planning for the alumni
association. She said a 52 percent
survey response was "impressive."
