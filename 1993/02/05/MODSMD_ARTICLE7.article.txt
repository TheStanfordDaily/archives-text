Construction began this week on
a new $16.6 million athletic facility
featuring a full-size basketball
practice court, offices for all athlet
ic teams and a dining room for 300.
After two delays in the project,
builders began digging in the area
that used to be the lacrosse field
between Maples Pavilion and the
tennis stadium.
The Athletics Department
hopes the new facility will be com
pleted and operating when stu
dents return to campus in Sep
tember, said Ben Asaro, manager
of special projects.
The three-story complex will re
place Encina Gym and provide a
large fitness room with weights,
stationary bikes and Stairmasters.
It will also feature a 120-seat audi
torium and a wrestling room that
can be used for general recreation.

"It will be a state of the art fa
cility for recreation use and for in
tercollegiate programs ... for all
students," said Assoc. Athletic Di
rector Tom Beckett.
The building has been named
the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter, he said.
John Arrillaga, one of the pro
ject's principle donors, played bas
ketball at Stanford in the 19505.
"He and his family has been very
helpful to the University and to
the athletic department," said
Athletic Director Ted Leland.
The facility was originally slat
ed for completion in December,
but plans to add a full basement to
the building delayed construction,
Asaro said. In the past month,
problems with obtaining permits
pushed the project back even fur
ther, he added, but the delays have
not resulted in additional costs.
According to Asaro, construction
workers will have to re-route a gas
line as well as a main sewer line as
part of the first phase of dirt moving.
Displaced by the new construc
tion, the men's lacrosse team has
been moved for the rest of the year
onto the intramural field, said

Asst. Athletic Director Shirley
Schoof. She has been working
with the intramural department
to find a new home for the group.
The Athletics Department has
tentative plans to build new
fields, Asaro said.
"No decision has been made"
about what will happen to Encina
gym after the Athletics Depart
ment moves into the new center,
said Jacqueline Wender, a facili
ties planner.

According to county ordinances,
Encina and all other buildings
made of unreinforced masonry
must be renovated or taken down
by the year 2000, said University
Architect David Neuman.
Architects completed a study
this fall on the possible uses for
Encina, researching "the rehabili
tation of the building, the seismic
strength and the conversion of
the building into other types of
space," Wender said.

A large set of considerations
will contribute to the final deci
sion, she added. Costs, feasibility,
space needs, fund raising and the
success or failure of fund-raising
will all contribute to the its fate,
Wender said.
Gifts and donations have fund
ed the new building, including a
$1.4 million gift from Nike chair
man and founder Philip H.
Knight, an alumnus of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
