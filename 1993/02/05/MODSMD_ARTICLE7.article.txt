Construction began this week on
a new $16.6 million athletic facility
featuring a full-size basketball
practice court, offices for all athlet
ic teams and a dining room for 300.
After two delays in the project,
builders began digging in the area
that used to be the lacrosse field
between Maples Pavilion and the
tennis stadium.
The Athletics Department
hopes the new facility will be com
pleted and operating when stu
dents return to campus in Sep
tember, said Ben Asaro, manager
of special projects.
The three-story complex will re
place Encina Gym and provide a
large fitness room with weights,
stationary bikes and Stairmasters.
It will also feature a 120-seat audi
torium and a wrestling room that
can be used for general recreation.

"It will be a state of the art fa
cility for recreation use and for in
tercollegiate programs ... for all
students," said Assoc. Athletic Di
rector Tom Beckett.
The building has been named
the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter, he said.
John Arrillaga, one of the pro
ject's principle donors, played bas
ketball at Stanford in the 19505.
"He and his family has been very
helpful to the University and to
the athletic department," said
Athletic Director Ted Leland.
The facility was originally slat
ed for completion in December,
but plans to add a full basement to
the building delayed construction,
Asaro said. In the past month,
problems with obtaining permits
pushed the project back even fur
ther, he added, but the delays have
not resulted in additional costs.
