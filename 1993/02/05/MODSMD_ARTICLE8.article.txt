# Environmental handbook – lots of them – hit campus
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
A new publication designed to increase
environmental awareness has made its way
under the doors of many students on cam
pus.
The pamphlet, titled "The Guide to Envi
ronmentally Sound Living at Stanford," is
designed to increase campus awareness of
issues such as water and energy conserva
tion, alternative forms of transportation,
water pollution and recycling.
Senior Shannon Snyder, author and editor
of the handbook, said she came up with the
idea for a comprehensive environmental hand
book while she was volunteering at the Envi
ronmental Health and Safety department.
"Ever since I was a freshman, I've always
had a lot of questions: Where can I get tran
sit guides? What (environmental) classes
can I take? What can you recycle?" Snyder

said. "I thought it would be great if students
had a guide like ... the women's guide to
use as a reference."
Freshman Kris Stanier said her "first
impulse was to sit down and read it. It was
visually exciting."
Although many appreciated the new re
source and its easy-to-read format, some stu
dents criticized the apparent waste of putting
two under every door, including singles.
Snyder would not explain why singles re
ceived two copies.
One junior said, "What they're trying to
do is really commendable, but I wonder how
many people will just put it on the shelf with
the rape pamphlet and the Asian-American
pamphlet and the Axe Committee pamphlet
and all the others."
But Snyder said she she feels "the bene
fits outweigh the loss of paper," pointing
out that the guide is a positive step away
from the fliers often strewn around campus

to raise awareness.
Describing the guide as a "more perma
nent . . . on-the-shelf kind of thing," Snyder
hopes students will "hold onto it for four
years." She added that the pamphlets will
be passed out to new students each year.
Although Snyder prefers to put the focus
on the cause, Urban Studies Program Di
rector Leonard Ortolano, the project advis
er, made it clear that "Shannon deserves
the lion's share of the credit."
Ortolano said he was confident that most
students "believe each of us can do some
thing" but that most people lack the re
sources to make environmentally conscious
decisions.
"The idea was to put the information out
in a form that is easy to digest," he said.
Snyder, who began working on the pro
ject in June, requested and received acade
mic credit for the booklet through the civil
engineering department.

Although the project was Snyder's brain
child, many groups contributed with fund
ing and ideas, she said. The Stanford Ener
gy Management Group and the Environ
mental Health and Safety department do
nated a majority of the funding, while Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stanford
helped with suggestions.
Despite the long months of hard work,
Snyder was disappointed to find an error in
the booklet.
"I checked and double-checked most of
the facts but I did find a mistake already."
Snyder said. "On page nine, it should read
'California' (not Stanford) used 1.0 million
acre-feet of water in September..
Still, Snyder remains hopeful about the
booklet's impact.
"A lot of people are willing to make little
changes in their lives to help the environ
ment but don't know where to start," she
said.
