MUST ENTER BY
THIS THURSDAY
The Winterfest Party Challenge
CONTEST
All you have to do is think of an idea that inspires your guests to
have a fun time without alcohol. Use any combination of these ideas
or think up a new one. A great party is in the execution as much as
in the idea.
PRIZES
The two winning groups receive prizes of their choosing, worth up
to $250 each. A TV, VCR, stereo, t-shirts, sweat shirts, an
evening or weekend getaway, an exceptional restaurant meal
(or two or three ...), gift certificates at your favorite clothing
store (or CD store, or video store), food, a deejay for a party,
any kind of house memorabilia, and more.
RULES
1. Parties must be alcohol free, theme-based, represented by
one event director, open and "all-campus", and safe.
2. Only registered students can enter.
3. Any group is eligible (friends, dorms, fraternities/sororities,
row houses).
4. Parties will be judged in two categories either new events or
annual (e.g. Rinc-a-Delt, Club UJ).
5. Prizes cannot be awarded in cash.
6. Parties must be entered before February 11th and be held by
March 6th.
7. Prior to the event, the Party Planners must have a minimum
of one meeting with a Party Pro Student Consultant.
