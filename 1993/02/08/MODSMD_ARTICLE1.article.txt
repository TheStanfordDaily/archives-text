Urging his audience to
strive for goals that benefit all
mankind, not just the indi
vidual, Black Liberation
Month keynote speaker Jesse
Jackson Jr. told a crowd of
300 Friday night not to "sit
back and wait," but to act.
"You must have dreams
consistent with eternity," he
said. "And so, Stanford, it is
not enough just to study and
say, I got a Stanford degree."
Jackson discussed eco
nomics, politics and social
values at his speech in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. His
speech echoed the theme of
the program, titled "Young,
Gifted, and Black: Taking Re
sponsibility for our Future."
The program also included
a jazz performance by Jam
Pac'd, a performance of the
song "Keep on Climbing" by
freshman Lisa Lawson and a
stepshow by the L.A. Step
pers of Los Altos High School.
"This generation has some
great challenges before it,"he
said. "We have the opportu
nity to raise our country to a
higher level of democracy."
He began his speech by
tracing the evolution of civil
rights in America, calling
slavery a "defining experi
ence" for African-Americans.
This evolution, he said,
began with the Plessy v. Fer
guson decision in 1896 that
permitted separate but equal
facilities for African-Ameri
cans and whites. The fight
for equal rights, he said, con
tinues with present-day at
tacks on affirmative action
programs.
Jackson also discussed
the state of the American
economy and encouraged
people to reinvest in the
United States. Health insurance
and adequate health care for
everyone are essential, he said.
Jackson ended his presentation
by discussing Martin Luther King
Jr. and his accomplishments.
Junior Rolanda Gaines, co
coordinator of Black Liberation
Month, said she felt Jackson's
lecture was very appropriate for
the month's theme.
"He definitely addressed the
issues we hoped he would," she
said. "It was captivating and
timely — nobody moved until his
last words."
Freshman Henry Epino said
he thought Jackson was "concil
iatory and positive."
"He reminded me a lot of his
dad," said Epino, adding that he
was surprised more students did
not attend the event.
Gaines said she hopes the
Stanford community will be
enlightened by Jackson's speech
and other events during Black
Liberation Month.
"Hopefully, the black commu
nity at Stanford will be more
proud of its history and culture,"
she said. "If everyone would take
in what he said and apply it to
their own lives, it could have a
real positive effect."
