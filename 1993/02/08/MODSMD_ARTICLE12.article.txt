Judge denies misleading Clinton
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal judge Kimba
Wood denied yesterday that while under consider
ation to be attorney general she had misled the
White House about the fact that she had hired an
illegal alien to care for her child.
"I did not mislead anyone at any point and I
have obeyed all laws," Wood said in a letter sent
yesterday to The New York Times.
Wood withdrew her name from consideration
on Friday after saying her baby sitter had been an
illegal immigrant when she was hired in 1986.
The judge stressed that she had broken no
laws because hiring undocumented workers was
not illegal at the time, and the White House
agreed.
The issue took on special significance because
Clinton earlier had nominated corporate attorney
Zoe Baird, who withdrew after it was revealed
that she had illegally employed aliens in her

household as a nanny and driver.
Administration officials said Clinton worked
on the attorney general choice yesterday. One
aide said the selection could be announced "in a
day or two."
Man storms nuclear plant
MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) — A man crashed a
car through the gates at the Three Mile Island
nuclear plant yesterday, spending four hours
inside before being arrested, police said.
Pierce Nye, 31, was found hiding under a piece
of machinery inside the turbine building, which
houses electrical generating equipment, state
police and plant officials said.
State Police spokesman Charles Tocci said Nye
told authorities he acted alone, had no explosives
and didn't tamper with anything.
Nye refused to say why he entered the plant,
said State Police Capt. Margaret Doutt.
