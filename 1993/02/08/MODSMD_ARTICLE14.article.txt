# Mediators for Bosnia convene
## U.N. Security Council prepares to take over 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
With time running out for Bosnian
Serbs and Muslims to agree on a
U.N. peace plan, international
mediators held a final series of
meetings yesterday before the
Security Council takes over the
crisis.
Mediators held little hope of
reaching a solution after talks
bogged down over their plan to
end the nearly 11-month-old war.
Meetings elsewhere increasingly
turned to the possibility of out
side military intervention.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin
met in Munich, Germany, with
Western military leaders to discuss
Washington's proposals. Aspin
refused to describe the proposals to

reporters, saying only that the
Clinton administration could act
on them as early as this week.
Previously, the United States
said it was not ready to commit
ground forces in the war-torn
region.
But NATO Secretary-General
Manfred Woerner said at the
Munich meeting the alliance
might have to use force in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, where a three-sided
ethnic conflict has killed more
than 18,000 people and created 1
million refugees.
"We must not shrink from the
legitimate use of force if we are to
remain credible," Woerner said.
U.N. envoy Cyrus Vance said
yesterday he believed the Security

Council would get involved today.
The talks were moved to New
York from Geneva last week so
the 15-nation Security Council —
especially the United States —
could pressure the factions to
compromise.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, going into a meeting with
mediators yesterday, said all sides
should "stop the war immediately."
In comments to reporters,
Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban
ridiculed such statements.
"The Serbian requests are
illogical, they're unreasonable,"
he said. "The Serbians wish to
have in their possession all the
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina
that they have captured by force."
