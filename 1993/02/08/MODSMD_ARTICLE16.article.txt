## A
						brand new flag... 
### 
Taking a break from
big things like multicultur
alism, budget cuts and stu
dent apathy, a little thing has come
up requiring attention.
A little thing like the American
flag in front of the post office.
Like the Claw, most students
don't notice the flag as they pass
through White Plaza, but two
weeks ago a sad passing made stu
dents take notice.
Two weeks ago, when one of the
greatest champions of civil rights
of this century, Thurgood Mar
shall, died, all flags across the
country were lowered to half-mast
for one week.
Suddenly, the flag over the post
office was noticeable, and it wasn't
a pretty sight.
The post office flag is old. It is
soiled, faded and shredded along
the edges. At least one corner of
the flag is completely gone.
It is a sight that would make a
Boy Scout weep (at least those

willing to admit they were Scouts).
For, as the 10th edition of the Boy
Scout Handbook says, "Clean the
flag if it becomes soiled. Mend it if
it is torn. When worn beyond
repair, destroy it in a dignified
way, preferably by burning."
Since the post office is the sole
representation of our government
on campus, the least students can
ask for is that the flag be retired
and replaced. It should not have
taken the death of a man commit
ed to defending the principles of
the stars and stripes to necessitate
a change.
The post office should buy a
new flag and destroy the current
one in a dignified fashion. Thus,
when the flag is brought down
toward earth once again, it will not
be an embarrassment to either the
post office or Stanford.
Who knows? If they order the
flag now, perhaps the postal ser
vice will have it here by the Fourth
of July.
