# Celebrates freedom

Equaling the blasphemy
of the post office's thread
bare flag have been several
recent incidents of phone harass
ment and death threats. This cam
pus, and indeed this country, is no
place for anonymous persecution.
A staffer of another campus
publication recently received a
death threat on their home
answering machine that said, in
effect, "I will hunt you down and
kill you."
While such incidents are
uncommon, they are inexcusable
and intolerable. Campus journal
ists should not be forced to watch
their backs like Salman Rushdie.
Stanford may be a land of many -
isms, but fascism and terrorism
are not among these.
Death threats are both illegal
and antithetical to Stanford's mis
sion as an educational institution.

Any disagreements people may
have over controversial subjects
should be expressed in rational
argument, not threats.
People who make threats are
merely cowards, afraid to engage
in dialogue and put their position
on the line.
Any fury people have over a par
ticular article should be channeled
into letters to the editor or face-to
face contact with the writer. Intim
idating phone calls to reporters or
sources quoted in the article are at
best unproductive and at worst
dangerous.
And if they are intended as
jokes, they are in very poor taste.
Letters to the editor, even angry
ones, are welcome. For as long as
no one is afraid to say what they
think, the "winds of freedom" will
blow over Stanford, and its hope
fully soon-to-come new flag.
