## Yes, I go to Stanford? 
### 
OUR SPEECH HAS been perverted.
A new pattern has imposed itself
on our voices, inverting our inflec
tions. Everywhere, students are ending
their statements with rising intonations.
When asked where I go to school, I find
myself answering with a question:
"I go to Stanford?"
This is a fact, and it should be a deci
sive statement, but the end floats up
toward a higher pitch. It sounds hesitant
and non-committal, as if awaiting judge
ment. It seems to say, "Sorry." "Sorry I
go to Stanford, I hope you don't have any
negative stereotypes about it, I mean it's
such a great school and people are so
smart there and I probably don't deserve
to be there 'cause I'm really not that
smart and I was just lucky to get in. I
hope that's OK, sorry?"
Ask someone what they did last sum
mer, and you'll most likely hear the same
phenomenon: "Um, I was working in
India with Mother Theresa?" The high
pitched ending says,"I know that's really
cool and selfless and I hope you did some
thing cool, too, and I really don't want to
seem arrogant or self-important, like
what I did is better than what you did,
because it's not, even if it sounds like it,
and I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Sorry." In this context, the statement
question anticipates a response. It
expects surprise or approval ("Wow, you
worked with Mother Theresa?! That's

amazing!"). The statement-question
knows, even as it utters itself, that this
reaction is forthcoming, so its tone says
in advance, "Aw, shucks, it was nothin.' "
Discussion sections are particularly vul
nerable to the statement-question. Take a
generic line from, say, an English class:
"I think the tree is a symbol."
This statement's pitch becomes
inverted (and the inversion is usually
accompanied by other signs of hesita
tion):
"I'm not sure about this, I mean
maybe this is way off-base, but, um,
maybe the tree is a symbol?"
The statement-question is the vocal
equivalent of a step backwards — quick
and nervous, like a person's retreat after
throwing a match into a gas barbecue. We
don't want to get our faces blown off,
after all. What if the person I'm talking
to didn't get in to Stanford? I don't want
to seem presumptuous. And what if
somebody disagrees? What if the tree
isn't a symbol, what if it's just a tree? The
statement-question is a kind of safeguard
because it says, simultaneously, "I think
the tree is a symbol," and, "maybe it's
not, and even if it is, I don't want to look
like a know-it-all, so I'm not going to
totally commit to this statement." It is
both a proclamation and a retraction.
Besides being just plain annoying,
statement-questions, if they continue to
infect our speech, could cause some real

confusion. If we're not sure, because of
ambiguous intonation, which of each
other's utterances are questions and
which are statements, we'll start running
in conversational circles:
"I go to Stanford?"
"You do?"
"I do?"
"Huh?"
"What?"
We will be confounded by a kind of
Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck-esque dialogue.
Like Daffy, we'll lose control of our own
statements:
Bugs: Duck season!
Daffy: Wabbit season!
Bugs: Duck season!
Daffy: Wabbit season!
Bugs: Wabbit season!
Daffy: Duck season! And I say shoot!
Poor Daffy gets fooled by Bugs' clever
reversal, just as we may be fooled by our
own tonal turnarounds if we don't act
now. The solution is close at hand. Let's
restore our questions and statements to
their rightful inflections. Just state it.
