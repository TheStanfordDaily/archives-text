# Trustees to consider tuition hike today
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
After last year's hefty 9.5 percent tuition
hike, eyes will be on the Board of Trustees
today and tomorrow, as they discuss next
year's price tag. A vote on the cost of at
tending Stanford is expected tomorrow.
"It will be discussed in several of the com
mittees," including Finance and Academic
Policy, board secretary Marlene Wine said.
The full board will then take a vote before
the meeting closes.
Last year, the University abandoned a
two-year-old pledge to limit tuition increas
es to 1 percent above inflation by announc
ing a 9.5 percent hike for undergraduates
and general graduate students.
University Budget Director Tim Warner
confirmed that an increase is under consid
eration, as it usually is at the board's Feb
ruary meeting, but he declined to comment

on what sort of hike has been proposed.
Provost Gerald Lieberman, who will pre
sent the issue to the trustees, said through
his assistant that he would not be making
any comments before the meeting.
Last year, the board also decided to raise
room and board rates by 2.5 percent. Tu
ition for the graduate schools went up as
well, from a high of 11.6 percent for the
School of Engineering to a low of 8.3 percent
at the Business School.
Three years ago, the trustees adopted a
policy of not raising the cost of attending
Stanford more than 1 percent over infla
tion. That promise would have kept last
year's hike to no more than 4.5 percent, but
University officials said budget shortfalls
forced them to abandon their pledge.
"We are hoping to see a return to the policy,"
said ASSU Senate chair Ron Brown, adding
that he would also like the board to consider
student interests and input in the decision.

The 1991-92 tuition hike was held to 5.2
percent, although the University did raise
the charge by 7.5 percent the previous year.
Robert Huff, the director of the Financial
Aids Office, said his budget is usually ad
justed to meet extra tuition demands. "It
certainly is my experience . . . that if fees go
up, student aid goes up," he said, adding
that he "continues to feel the University is
meeting its commitment" to providing aid.
Last year, an additional allocation was
granted to financial aid programs to relieve
the self-help burden at the same time the
tuition hike was announced.
Higher tuition also raises worries that
fewer high school seniors will choose Stan
ford. But Dean of Admissions James Mon
toya said that because of recent press re
ports about the cost of higher education, the
public is expecting continued increases.

ford will not come as a surprise to anyone,"
he said.
"Will it create more challenging situa
tions for some families? Certainly, but I
think that they have already been thinking
about it as a result of what they've been
reading in the newspapers."
