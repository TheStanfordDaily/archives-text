SURE workers defend their budget and use of carts

THE DAILY'S RECENT edi
torial "An UnSURE Service,"
attacks the effectiveness and
dependability of the SURE Escort organi
zation on the basis of women being
"forced" to walk to destinations due to
"absurdly long" waits. These waits are
routinely within 15 minutes of a call.
While we always attempt to escort stu
dents as quickly as possible, we do not feel
that even a wait of 30 minutes is remotely
absurd for anyone, to ensure personal
safety. SURE Escort's purpose is to pro
vide safe transportation across campus —
it is not a taxi service designed to speed
patrons from one destination to another.
The Daily implies that SURE condones
the abuse of the escort service by provid
ing transportation for "large" or "mixed
sex" groups. More often than not these
"groups" are individual callers with simi

lar destinations who have been picked up
on one cart in order to increase efficiency
and handle a larger number of calls. More
importantly, as an organization dedicated
to serving the entire community, we do
not feel it is appropriate to judge the needs
and motivations of individual passengers,
occasionally including men, who wish to
travel safely at night.
One of the major criticisms of the edito
rial staff is that the level of service provid
ed does not justify our budget. While our
fee request was $53,000, fee refunds
immediately consumed $9,000. Of the
remaining $44,000, over 80 percent is used
for staffing expenses while only 6.5 per
cent is used for cart maintenance, gas and
insurance. If, as The Daily suggests, we
were to sell the carts and eliminate all cart
expenses, we would not even be able to
hire one additional person per night this

year. We would be left both without a
"substantial, fairly-paid staff" and without
the efficiency which carts afford. Adopting
a walking-escort service would significant
ly compromise our ability to provide safe
and reliable escorts. Even a cursory glance
at our special fee request would lead any
one to the same conclusion.
At several times during SURE's histoiy,
the option of becoming an entirely volunteer
organization has been strongly considered in
order to reduce our budget. We have decided
against this move because we feel that it
would be difficult to attract enough volun
teers to operate with or without carts, and
that doing so would adversely affect escort
reliability, which is crucial to our goals.
However, in keeping with our attempt to
minimize costs, our escorts are, in fact, paid
less than campus minimum wage.
We sincerely hope that "An UnSURE

Service" does not portend a freshly
obstreperous and misinformed editorial
staff. While we are open to constructive
criticism, the editorial was clearly an
attack designed to elicit a response. None
of us have ever felt moved to perpetuate
The Daily's inane demi-dialogue, but the
editorial board's feeble attempt to under
stand and assail our organization has bla
tantly misled students. Next time do your
homework, folks.
