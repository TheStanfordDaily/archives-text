# Ice-T an expert on the freedom of expression
## 
### 
Taken together, your editorial and
editorial cartoon about Ice-T give the
distinct impression that writers for The
Daily did not want Ice-T to come speak
here because his manner of speech was
not acceptable to them.
The cartoon depicts Ice-T spewing
profanities while the editorial declares
that he is only being invited because he
is "cool," and that he would have noth
ing informative and worthwhile to say
about First Amendment rights. It sug
gests John Denver or Frank Zappa as
more valuable speakers.
Denver and Zappa speak typical white
upper or middle class English. Ice-T's
speech is the product of street life in
South Central Los Angeles. His speech is
pithy and colorful to anyone willing to
listen. Although his words sound coarse
to our academic ears, his experiences
clearly make him an expert on the cur-

rent state of free speech in America.
Unlike the picture The Daily paints of
him, he is not a pop-culture pet, some
one capable of only entertaining.
His abrupt dumping by Warner
Brothers and the firestorm of controver
sy surrounding his "Cop Killer" record
say much more than John Denver's
opinions expressed with correct gram
mar and no obscenities.
