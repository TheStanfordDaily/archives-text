# Stanford must pressure Webbs to keep workers above the poverty line
## 
### 
The Stanford administration is to be
commended for taking action at Webb
Ranch, but unless the Stanford commu
nity insists that the Webbs pay their
workers a decent wage, the workers will

continue to live and work in poverty, and
the Webbs and Stanford will continue to
profit from it.
Currently, the Webbs pay $5 to $6.50
an hour, and we have no idea how much
the Webbs make from the workers'
labor. At $5 an hour, assuming 40 hours
of work every week of the year, a worker
would gross $10,400. In 1991, the latest
year for which information is available, a
family of four was officially poor if it fell
below $13,924.
Augustin Gonzalez, who has worked
at Webb Ranch for 24 years, his wife
and five children may soon have ade
quate heat and better housing. They
will not soon be lifted out of poverty or
enjoy health benefits unless people at
Stanford demand that the Webbs pay
considerably more than $5 to $6.50 an
hour for the privilege of living on Stan
ford land.
An even better solution might be the
establishment of a worker-run coopera
tive farm, in association with the Uni
versity, so the workers would reap even
greater financial benefits from the work

they do on Stanford land.
