# Letters Policy
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes letters from
its readers. Letters will be published
at the editor's discretion and are
subject to editing. All letters must
include the author's name, phone
number and Stanford affiliation, if
any. Submissions with more than
five signatures must designate a rep
resentative.
Letters should be turned in on a
Macintosh disk in Microsoft Word
format with a paper copy of the sub
mission.
