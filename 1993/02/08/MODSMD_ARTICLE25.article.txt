## Women's basketball bounces back Stanford downs Arizona 69-52, Arizona State 85-80 
### Brian Border Staff Writer 
What a difference two days can make.
After playing far below its potential in a win
Friday night against Arizona, the Stanford
women's basketball team(l7-4, 8-2 Pacific 10
Conference) rose to the occasion yesterday
against Arizona State, beating the Sun Devils
85-80 at Maples Pavilion.
The two victories made amends for the Cardi
nal's loss to Washington last week, keeping the
squad tied for first place in the Pac-10. Also,
Stanford's outstanding performance against
Arizona State gives it momentum as it heads
into the second half of conference play.
The Sun Devils (12-6, 5-4) gave the Cardinal
a challenge right from the start, matching Stan
ford basket for basket. The teams found them
selves tied seven times in the first nine minutes
of the contest, before Arizona State went on a
16-6 run. Fueled by its physical defense and its
penetrating offensive style, the Sun Devils
pulled ahead 30-20.
The Cardinal fought back from the 10-point
deficit with the help of sophomore Anita Kaplan.
The backup center scored 10 of her career-high
25 points in the last six minutes of the period,
trimming the lead to 40-37 at the break.
"Anita really kept us in it in the first half,"
said Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. "When
she gets the ball down low, it's going to go in.
She's a radar."
The dogfight continued in the second half as
neither squad could obtain a sizeable advantage.
The national-champion Cardinal finally buried
its tenacious opponent, as it turned a 53-52
deficit into a 78-61 margin with 2 minutes, 40
seconds remaining.
Although the Sun Devils caught fire in the

closing moments and cut the lead to three at one
point, Tanda Rucker converted two free throws
in the last five seconds to ice the game for Stan
ford.
While several Cardinal players, including
Rucker and Val Whiting, played key offensive
roles for the Cardinal in the second period, it was
Kaplan's pinpoint shooting that pushed the Car
dinal over the top.
"Last year, Anita went in [during some] situ
ations and helped us," VanDerveer said. "This
year, she's won games for us."
On Friday night, the Cardinal triumphed
over Arizona, 69-52, despite a lousy shooting dis
play by most of its players. The Stanford squad
converted just 30 percent of its shots, by far its
lowest field-goal percentage of the season.
• "I don't think it was a pretty game," said Car
dinal guard Christy Hedgpeth. "Coming off a
loss, we were hoping to come out strong. At the
same time, we were happy with the win."
Most of the bright spots that were buried
within Stanford's sub-par performance could be
found in the squad's solid defensive effort. The
Cardinal held its opponent to an equally poor 33
percent shooting percentage, while inducing the
Wildcats to turn the ball over 26 times.
"You've got to credit Stanford's defense," said
Arizona coach Joan Bonvicini. "It was a defen
sive game."
Stanford proved especially effective in
stymieing Keisha Anderson, Arizona's top scor
er. The dynamic defensive duo of Angela Taylor
and Rucker held the freshman guard to just four
points on 2-for-10 shooting and forced her to
commit 10 turnovers.
Taylor, Rucker and company rattled Ander
son the entire game, forcing her out of her game
plan. At one point in the first half, Anderson
dribbled past her defender, hoping for an easy

lay up. However, her path to the basket was
immediately blocked by two other Stanford play
ers who surprised Anderson, forcing her to trav
el with the ball as she became surrounded by a
third defender.
Had it not been for the offensive consistency
exhibited by Hedgpeth and Kaplan, the Wildcats
(9-8,3-5) might have posed a more serious threat
to Stanford.
Hedgpeth contributed seven of her 11 points
late in the opening half to propel the Cardinal
from a slim two-point lead to a 12-point margin
at the break. The sharp-shooting junior has had
a hot hand lately, after an extended illness
caused her to perform at less than full strength
earlier in the season.
"I can sense that I'm starting to get back to
100 percent," she said. "I've tried to spend a lit
tle extra time shooting on my own. I feel much
better."
Down low near the basket, Kaplan was mak
ing her own mark. The 6-foot-5 sophomore led
all players with 17 points as her speedy
turnaround shots caught the defenders off
guard.
Stanford controlled the lead from the 10-
minute mark in the opening half, but did not
pull away from Arizona until late in the contest.
A Molly Goodenbour three-pointer followed by
an Anita Kaplan basket extended the lead to 18
with 6:35 remaining, finally putting the game
out of reach.
Although the Cardinal pulled out the victory,
it was by no means one of its better perfor
mances on the season.
"When you come off a loss, people put pres
sure on themselves to win a game," VanDerveer
said. "I don't think it was a relaxed game. It was
one of those games where you just grit your
teeth and get through it."

el with the ball as she became surrounded by a
third defender.
Had it not been for the offensive consistency
exhibited by Hedgpeth and Kaplan, the Wildcats
(9-8,3-5) might have posed a more serious threat
to Stanford.
Hedgpeth contributed seven of her 11 points
late in the opening half to propel the Cardinal
from a slim two-point lead to a 12-point margin
at the break. The sharp-shooting junior has had
a hot hand lately, after an extended illness
caused her to perform at less than full strength
earlier in the season.
"I can sense that I'm starting to get back to
100 percent," she said. "I've tried to spend a lit
tle extra time shooting on my own. I feel much
better."
Down low near the basket, Kaplan was mak
ing her own mark. The 6-foot-5 sophomore led
all players with 17 points as her speedy
turnaround shots caught the defenders off
guard.
Stanford controlled the lead from the 10-
minute mark in the opening half, but did not
pull away from Arizona until late in the contest.
A Molly Goodenbour three-pointer followed by
an Anita Kaplan basket extended the lead to 18
with 6:35 remaining, finally putting the game
out of reach.
Although the Cardinal pulled out the victory,
it was by no means one of its better perfor
mances on the season.
"When you come off a loss, people put pres
sure on themselves to win a game," VanDerveer
said. "I don't think it was a relaxed game. It was
one of those games where you just grit your
teeth and get through it."

Sophomore center Anita Kaplan was a scoring machine for the Car
dinal, tallying a career-high 25 points against Arizona State and a
team-leading 17 points versus Arizona.
What a difference two days can make.
After playing far below its potential in a win
Friday night against Arizona, the Stanford
women's basketball team(l7-4, 8-2 Pacific 10
Conference) rose to the occasion yesterday
against Arizona State, beating the Sun Devils
85-80 at Maples Pavilion.
The two victories made amends for the Cardi
nal's loss to Washington last week, keeping the
squad tied for first place in the Pac-10. Also,
Stanford's outstanding performance against
Arizona State gives it momentum as it heads
into the second half of conference play.
The Sun Devils (12-6, 5-4) gave the Cardinal
a challenge right from the start, matching Stan
ford basket for basket. The teams found them
selves tied seven times in the first nine minutes
of the contest, before Arizona State went on a
16-6 run. Fueled by its physical defense and its
penetrating offensive style, the Sun Devils
pulled ahead 30-20.
The Cardinal fought back from the 10-point
deficit with the help of sophomore Anita Kaplan.
The backup center scored 10 of her career-high
25 points in the last six minutes of the period,
trimming the lead to 40-37 at the break.
"Anita really kept us in it in the first half,"
said Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. "When
she gets the ball down low, it's going to go in.
She's a radar."
The dogfight continued in the second half as
neither squad could obtain a sizeable advantage.
The national-champion Cardinal finally buried
its tenacious opponent, as it turned a 53-52
deficit into a 78-61 margin with 2 minutes, 40
seconds remaining.
Although the Sun Devils caught fire in the

closing moments and cut the lead to three at one
point, Tanda Rucker converted two free throws
in the last five seconds to ice the game for Stan
ford.
While several Cardinal players, including
Rucker and Val Whiting, played key offensive
roles for the Cardinal in the second period, it was
Kaplan's pinpoint shooting that pushed the Car
dinal over the top.
"Last year, Anita went in [during some] situ
ations and helped us," VanDerveer said. "This
year, she's won games for us."
On Friday night, the Cardinal triumphed
over Arizona, 69-52, despite a lousy shooting dis
play by most of its players. The Stanford squad
converted just 30 percent of its shots, by far its
lowest field-goal percentage of the season.
• "I don't think it was a pretty game," said Car
dinal guard Christy Hedgpeth. "Coming off a
loss, we were hoping to come out strong. At the
same time, we were happy with the win."
Most of the bright spots that were buried
within Stanford's sub-par performance could be
found in the squad's solid defensive effort. The
Cardinal held its opponent to an equally poor 33
percent shooting percentage, while inducing the
Wildcats to turn the ball over 26 times.
"You've got to credit Stanford's defense," said
Arizona coach Joan Bonvicini. "It was a defen
sive game."
Stanford proved especially effective in
stymieing Keisha Anderson, Arizona's top scor
er. The dynamic defensive duo of Angela Taylor
and Rucker held the freshman guard to just four
points on 2-for-10 shooting and forced her to
commit 10 turnovers.
Taylor, Rucker and company rattled Ander
son the entire game, forcing her out of her game
plan. At one point in the first half, Anderson
dribbled past her defender, hoping for an easy

lay up. However, her path to the basket was
immediately blocked by two other Stanford play
ers who surprised Anderson, forcing her to trav
el with the ball as she became surrounded by a
third defender.
Had it not been for the offensive consistency
exhibited by Hedgpeth and Kaplan, the Wildcats
(9-8,3-5) might have posed a more serious threat
to Stanford.
Hedgpeth contributed seven of her 11 points
late in the opening half to propel the Cardinal
from a slim two-point lead to a 12-point margin
at the break. The sharp-shooting junior has had
a hot hand lately, after an extended illness
caused her to perform at less than full strength
earlier in the season.
"I can sense that I'm starting to get back to
100 percent," she said. "I've tried to spend a lit
tle extra time shooting on my own. I feel much

ing her own mark. The 6-foot-5 sophomore led
all players with 17 points as her speedy
turnaround shots caught the defenders off
guard.
Stanford controlled the lead from the 10-

A Molly Goodenbour three-pointer followed by

with 6:35 remaining, finally putting the game
out of reach.
