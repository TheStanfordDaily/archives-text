# Up and down season plagues Cardinal
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
"Stanford isn't as strong as
they've been in the past," said Ari
zona State forward Monique
Ambers, after her team's five-point
loss to the Cardinal yesterday.
"They're more beatable than
they've been," she said.
Are they?
After a schizophrenic weekend
that saw Cardinal shooters dip
below basketball's equivalent of
the Mendoza Line on Friday only
to come back with their highest
shooting percentage of the season
yesterday, the answer depends on
one's point of view.
Arizona coach Joan Bonvicini,
whose team has now played both
Stanford and former-No. 1 Vander
bilt, offered a different perspective
from that offered by Ambers.
"I'd rather play Vanderbilt,"
Bonvicini declared when asked
after Friday's game whom she
would prefer to play again.
Clearly, she intimated, Stan
ford's cold shooting Friday was a

fluke. "Their offensive execution is
good. They run their plays well.
They just couldn't put the ball in
the hole," Bonvicini said.
So, who's right? The statistics
from the season give fodder to opti
mists and doomsayers alike.
With this weekend's games,
the Cardinal completed its first
circuit of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and played its 20th and 21st
games overall, but yesterday's
game marked only the fifth time
Cardinal shooters have made
more than half of its field goal
attempts.
For the season, Stanford has
shot 44.5 percent. By contrast, last
year's national championship team
shot nearly 49 percent through its
first 21 games.
"I don't think that shooting thus
year has been our problem," Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer said
after Friday's game, notwithstand
ing that night's performance. "It's
not something I really worry
about."
Instead, VanDerveer has placed
a huge emphasis on defense, fre

quently choosing who she will start
based on player's efforts when the
Cardinal does not have the ball.
"I've been working with differ
ent combinations of people who
play good defense," she said, allud
ing to her decision to start defen
sive specialist Angela Taylor
against Arizona. Five different
players have started at the two
wing positions this season.
The emphasis has paid divi
dends. The Cardinal is currently
surrendering nearly eight fewer
points per game than it was at this
point last year. For the season,
opponents have made fewer than
39 percent of their field goal tries.
Last year's team held its opponents
under 42 percent.
Has the emphasis on defense
hurt the Cardinal offense? If so,
VanDerveer wasn't dismayed after
Friday's game.
"Our defense was better," she
said. "Maybe people didn't have the
legs that they need [to make their
shots] because they were working
hard [on defense] in practice."
But while the field goal and scor

ing numbers are inconclusive, one
ominous weakness in this year's
squad is Stanford's free-throw
shooting. At this point last year,
Stanford had made more than 74
percent of its foul shots. To date,
the Cardinal has converted fewer
than 70 percent of its attempts this
year.
More to the point, in its four
defeats this season, the Cardinal
has shot a combined 59 percent
(54-91) from the charity stripe.
VanDerveer has remained opti
mistic. She was particularly happy
yesterday with the contributions of
young players coming off the
bench.
"The play of Tanda [Rucker],
the play of Bobbie [Kelsey], the
play of Anita [Kaplan] is really crit
ical for us," she said. "And Kate
[Paye] has already done it for us."
The three sophomores and red
shirt-freshman Kelsey combined
for 42 of Stanford's 85 points
against Arizona State.
Bonvicini also witnessed the
Cardinal's depth on Friday, as
three non-starters tallied 31 of

Stanford's 69 points in that game.
The Arizona coach's conclusion:
"I think they'll be there at the
end," she said.
Or perhaps, as Ambers' team

mate Stacey Johnson suggested,
other teams have caught up with
Stanford.
This weekend's two wins did not
prove either contention definitively.
