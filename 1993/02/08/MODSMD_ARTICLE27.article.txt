# Arizona State decimates men's hoops Sun Devil Smith racks up 32 points in 109-87 mauling
## 
### David Schwartz Senior Staff Writer 
TEMPE, Ariz.— Stanford was
pricked by more than a cactus Saturday
night, and it hurt. It hurt a lot.
Arizona State unleashed a barrage
of three-pointers from all distances to
finish off the Cardinal, winning 109-87
in front of 7,522 at the University
Activity Center.
Sun Devil guard Stevin "Hedake"
Smith, the Pacific 10 Conference's
leading scorer, inflicted the pain. The
junior shot an astounding 8-for-12
from three-point range, forging the
way for his squad with a game-high 32
points.
"Hedake did a great job tonight —
he was on fire," said Arizona State
coach Bill Frieder. "He took care of
business."
Smith was not the only one. Four
other Sun Devil players scored in dou
ble figures, as the Sun Devils created
several easy shot opportunities for
themselves via screens that took Cardi
nal defenders out of several plays.
"We didn't do what we worked on in
practice," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "We wanted to watch the
picks and stop the high-post screens,
but we went out and forgot what we
were going to do."
Arizona State's high-pressure
defense caused Stanford (6-15, 1-8 Pac
-10) to commit a costly 27 turnovers,
leading to easy baskets on the other
end.
"We broke down offensively," Mont
gomery said. "We fell prey to a style of
basketball that we thought we were
prepared for."
That style allowed Arizona State
(12-5, 6-3) to exploit their quickness
and score the most points of a Sun
Devil men's basketball team in four
years.
"We jumped on them from the first
bucket and never let up," Smith said.

At the 10:34 mark of the first half,
with Arizona State leading 25-20, the
onslaught began.
Guards Wun Versher and Smith hit
back-to-back threes, sparking a 16-2
run over the next 3:45 that gave the
Sun Devils a 19-point lead which would
remain throughout.
Meanwhile, Stanford shot 51.7 per
cent from the field — only the fourth
time the team has reached the 50 per
cent mark all season — yet was effec
tively out of the contest from the
start.
Arizona State forward Dwayne
Fontana, who stands 6-foot-5, led the
Sun Devils in rebounding with 10. This
surpassed the combined totals for Jim
Morgan, Bart Lammersen and Darren
Allaway, all of whom are at least three
inches taller.
Freshman Dion Cross was the only
player keeping Stanford in the game in
the first half, as he scored 17 of a
career-high 25 points on 7-of-10 shoot
ing in the opening period.
"My shots were going down, so I
wasn't hesitant," Cross said. "I just
shot the ball."
"Dion did a good job scoring the
ball," Montgomery said. "He has the
athletic ability to get by someone and
make a play. Somebody has to do it,
and I'm pleased that Dion wants to do
it."
Guard Kenny Hicks provided help
in reserve for the Cardinal with 20
points, and Marcus Lollie had 16. But
the thorn that hurt most in the Car
dinal's side came from Brent
Williams, who only took eight shots
on the night, passing up several open
opportunities. His lackluster effort
caused Montgomery to bench him in
favor of Hicks at the beginning of the
second half.
"Brent has to increase his concen
tration level," Montgomery said. "He's
making too many mental errors. Our
fourth-year guys have to provide lead

ership. We can't afford to have people
on the floor not playing smart."
Stanford has now lost eight straight
games, matching the school's longest
losing streak since the 1981-82 season.
With the Pac-10 schedule half over,
Montgomery is still searching for
answers.
"Everything presents a different
problem for us," Montgomery said. "In
this league, either the teams are big
and strong or real athletic, and we
seem to be in-between.
We're not going anywhere for post
season, but we have to play better so we
can take some pride in ourselves."

the thorn that hurt most in the Car
dinal's side came from Brent
Williams, who only took eight shots
on the night, passing up several open
opportunities. His lackluster effort
caused Montgomery to bench him in
favor of Hicks at the beginning of the
second half.
"Brent has to increase his concen
tration level," Montgomery said. "He's
making too many mental errors. Our
fourth-year guys have to provide lead

ership. We can't afford to have people
on the floor not playing smart."
Stanford has now lost eight straight
games, matching the school's longest
losing streak since the 1981-82 season.
With the Pac-10 schedule half over,
Montgomery is still searching for
answers.
"Everything presents a different
problem for us," Montgomery said. "In
this league, either the teams are big
and strong or real athletic, and we
seem to be in-between.
We're not going anywhere for post
season, but we have to play better so we
can take some pride in ourselves."

Dion Cross was one of Stanford's few bright spots on Saturday. He contributed 25
points to the Cardinal's losing cause against the Sun Devils.
TEMPE, Ariz.— Stanford was
pricked by more than a cactus Saturday
night, and it hurt. It hurt a lot.
Arizona State unleashed a barrage
of three-pointers from all distances to
finish off the Cardinal, winning 109-87
in front of 7,522 at the University
Activity Center.
Sun Devil guard Stevin "Hedake"
Smith, the Pacific 10 Conference's
leading scorer, inflicted the pain. The
junior shot an astounding 8-for-12
from three-point range, forging the
way for his squad with a game-high 32
points.
"Hedake did a great job tonight —
he was on fire," said Arizona State
coach Bill Frieder. "He took care of
business."
Smith was not the only one. Four
other Sun Devil players scored in dou
ble figures, as the Sun Devils created
several easy shot opportunities for
themselves via screens that took Cardi
nal defenders out of several plays.
"We didn't do what we worked on in
practice," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "We wanted to watch the
picks and stop the high-post screens,
but we went out and forgot what we
were going to do."
Arizona State's high-pressure
defense caused Stanford (6-15, 1-8 Pac
-10) to commit a costly 27 turnovers,
leading to easy baskets on the other
end.
"We broke down offensively," Mont
gomery said. "We fell prey to a style of
basketball that we thought we were
prepared for."
That style allowed Arizona State
(12-5, 6-3) to exploit their quickness
and score the most points of a Sun
Devil men's basketball team in four
years.
"We jumped on them from the first
bucket and never let up," Smith said.

At the 10:34 mark of the first half,
with Arizona State leading 25-20, the
onslaught began.
Guards Wun Versher and Smith hit
back-to-back threes, sparking a 16-2
run over the next 3:45 that gave the
Sun Devils a 19-point lead which would
remain throughout.
Meanwhile, Stanford shot 51.7 per
cent from the field — only the fourth
time the team has reached the 50 per
cent mark all season — yet was effec
tively out of the contest from the
start.
Arizona State forward Dwayne
Fontana, who stands 6-foot-5, led the
Sun Devils in rebounding with 10. This
surpassed the combined totals for Jim
Morgan, Bart Lammersen and Darren
Allaway, all of whom are at least three
inches taller.
Freshman Dion Cross was the only
player keeping Stanford in the game in
the first half, as he scored 17 of a
career-high 25 points on 7-of-10 shoot
ing in the opening period.
"My shots were going down, so I
wasn't hesitant," Cross said. "I just
shot the ball."
"Dion did a good job scoring the
ball," Montgomery said. "He has the
athletic ability to get by someone and
make a play. Somebody has to do it,
and I'm pleased that Dion wants to do
it."
Guard Kenny Hicks provided help
in reserve for the Cardinal with 20
points, and Marcus Lollie had 16. But
the thorn that hurt most in the Car
dinal's side came from Brent
Williams, who only took eight shots
on the night, passing up several open
opportunities. His lackluster effort
caused Montgomery to bench him in
