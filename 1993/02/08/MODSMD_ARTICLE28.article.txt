# Swimmers outpace USC, UCLA with new pool records
## 
### Kay Hong Staff Writer 
Five pool records and many
Southern California egos fell this
weekend as the Stanford men's
swim team spanked both USC
and UCLA at deGuerre.
The Cardinal ended a three
year losing streak against USC on
Friday, defeating the Trojans
162-75 and reclaiming the "bell
trophy" awarded annually to the
winner of the Stanford-USC dual
meet.
Pool records were posted by
Cardinal freshman Joe Hudepohl
in the 200-yard freestyle (1
minute, 35.91 seconds) and Stan
ford's still-undefeated 400 med
ley relay team of Derek Weather
ford, Tyler May field, Trip Zedlitz
and Eric Maurer (3:16.75).
Other event winners included
Bill Schell in the 50 and 100 free
(20.57 and 45.31, respectively),
Hudepohl in the 500 free
(4:28.97), Zedlitz in the 200 indi
vidual medley (1:49.68), Ray
Carey in the 200 butterfly
(1:46.76), and the Cardinal 400
free relay team of Hudepohl, Dan
Kanner, Schell and Eric Diehl
(2:59.77).
Diver Jamie Edwards also con
tributed substantially with first
place finishes in both the 1-meter
(273.15) and 3-meter (327.9) div

ing competitions.
Edwards' 3-meter score, along
with Hudepohl's 200 free and
Carey's 200 fly times were
NCAA-qualifying performances.
On Saturday, Stanford hon
ored its graduating seniors as the
Cardinal frosh led the way in
defeating an outclassed Bruin
squad, 167-73.
Mike Covert won the 1,000
free and finished second to class
mate Diehl in the 200 free in a
grueling back-to-back perfor
mance. The freshman from
Miami later came back to win the
500 free (4:28.31), knocking more
than four seconds off of his previ
ous season-best time.
Hudepohl led a 1-2-3 Cardinal
sweep of the 50 free (20.35) and
set yet another pool record by
winning the 100 free (43.96).
Hudepohl's time broke the oldest
pool record at deGuerre, eclipsing
the former standard of 44.04 set
in 1980 by Olympian Chris
Cavanaugh.
Other wins were turned in by
Zedlitz in the 200 IM, Carey in
the 200 fly, Weatherford in the
200 backstroke, Kurt Grote in
the 200 breaststroke, the 400
medley relay team of Weather
ford, Grote, Carey and Schell,
and the record-setting 400 free
relay of Erik Maurer, Mayfield,
Schell and Hudepohl.

According to coach Skip Ken
ney, the 400 free relay time of
2:57.37 was the "fastest
unshaved 400-yard relay time
ever in the history of the planet."

Kenney mentioned that the
Cardinal squad has just conclud
ed its weight training program
and is now beginning to rest in
preparation for the Pacific 10

coference and NCAA champi
onships in March. The slight rest
may have given Stanford an
advantage during the USC-UCLA
weekend.

"We're at the point in the sea
son where momentum is really
the key," Kenney said. "This was
an unbelievable weekend."
