# Baseball gets feet wet versus Fullerton, finishes series 1-2
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
A young Cardinal baseball team was bap
tized into the world of big-time baseball by No.
8 Cal State-Fullerton this weekend, dropping
two of three late-inning thrillers to last year's
NCAA runners-up.
After taking the opening game 4-3 in dra
matic fashion, Stanford squandered leads in
the final two contests, falling 6-4 in 10 innings
Saturday and 7-5 yesterday.
The series began with a bang for the Cardi
nal in the opener. Down 3-2 with two outs in
the ninth, Stanford's Brian Dallimore drew a
walk. Up stepped A.J. Hinch, a catcher who
ranks as one of the best freshmen in college
baseball.
Believe the hype. On an 0-2 count, Hinch
drilled a home run into the left field stands,
giving the Cardinal a come-from-behind 4-3
win.
Matt Marenghi picked up the win for Stan
ford, while starter Willie Adams looked
impressive, allowing only four singles in six
innings of work.
On Saturday, the Cardinal staked itself to
an early four-run lead, thanks to doubles
from the bats of Nate Olmstead and Steve
Carver.
The more experienced Titans proceeded to
give Stanford a taste of its own medicine. After
tacking on three unearned runs in the third,
Fullerton tied the score at four when Dante

Powell scampered to an inside-the-park home
run.
Powell, a preseason All-American, plagued
the Cardinal all weekend with his bat. The
sophomore picked up five hits (including two
home runs) and three stolen bases in the
series.
With the score tied and two outs in the
10th, Stanford righthander Mario Iglesias hit
Fullerton designated hitter Adam Millan with
a fastball.
Up stepped first baseman D.C. Olsen, a
sophomore who had already contributed an
RBI single in the third. In a bittersweet
moment of deja vu for the Cardinal, Olsen
ended the contest with a two-run home run to
left.
Rubber-armed junior-college transfer Dan
Ricabal went the distance for the Titans,
throwing a Herculean 150 pitches in his 10
innings of work. Ricabal relied heavily on an
assortment of breaking pitches, effectively
silencing the Stanford bats with his slider late
in the game.
This wasn't surprising for Stanford coach
Mark Marquess. "The pitchers are ahead of
the hitters at this stage of the season in terms
of breaking balls," the coach said. "[The
Titans] did a good job all weekend of throwing
the right pitch at the right time."
The longball played a major role in yester
day's game as well. After a Powell home run
gave Fullerton the early lead, the Cardinal
stormed back, going ahead 5-3 in the sixth by

virtue of Todd Laßocca's first homer of the
season.
Fullerton tied it in the bottom of the
frame when right fielder Jim Betzsold con
nected for a home run off of Stanford reliev
er Greg Mix.
It was a soft single, however, which proved
to be the Cardinal's undoing yesterday. With
runners on second and third in the eighth,
Titan third baseman Jeff Ferguson laced a
Dan Reed pitch through a drawn-in Cardinal
infield, knocking in the go-ahead runs in the
process.
Todd Bartels started the game from the
mound for Stanford and pitched effectively.
"For his first start, he looked good," Mar
quess said. "He made a couple of mistakes
early on, but overall he did very well."
The road ahead is no easier for the Cardinal.
Stanford faces traditional powerhouse Fresno
State at home next weekend before beginning
conference play at Arizona Feb. 26-28.
"This is just the beginning," Marquess said.
"Fullerton has a very good team and a solid
program, but the reality of the situation is it
will get tougher with every weekend.
We're going to have to get better, because
the competition will be better."
Card Notes
Olmstead slipped while running out a routine
grounder yesterday. While he appeared to suffer a
sprained ankle, X-rays were scheduled to be taken
last night on campus .

left.
Rubber-armed junior-college transfer Dan
Ricabal went the distance for the Titans,
throwing a Herculean 150 pitches in his 10
innings of work. Ricabal relied heavily on an
assortment of breaking pitches, effectively
silencing the Stanford bats with his slider late
in the game.
This wasn't surprising for Stanford coach
Mark Marquess. "The pitchers are ahead of
the hitters at this stage of the season in terms
of breaking balls," the coach said. "[The
Titans] did a good job all weekend of throwing
the right pitch at the right time."
The longball played a major role in yester
day's game as well. After a Powell home run
gave Fullerton the early lead, the Cardinal
stormed back, going ahead 5-3 in the sixth by

virtue of Todd Laßocca's first homer of the
season.
Fullerton tied it in the bottom of the
frame when right fielder Jim Betzsold con
nected for a home run off of Stanford reliev
er Greg Mix.
It was a soft single, however, which proved
to be the Cardinal's undoing yesterday. With
runners on second and third in the eighth,
Titan third baseman Jeff Ferguson laced a
Dan Reed pitch through a drawn-in Cardinal
infield, knocking in the go-ahead runs in the
process.
Todd Bartels started the game from the
mound for Stanford and pitched effectively.
"For his first start, he looked good," Mar
quess said. "He made a couple of mistakes
early on, but overall he did very well."
The road ahead is no easier for the Cardinal.
Stanford faces traditional powerhouse Fresno
State at home next weekend before beginning
conference play at Arizona Feb. 26-28.
"This is just the beginning," Marquess said.
"Fullerton has a very good team and a solid
program, but the reality of the situation is it
will get tougher with every weekend.
We're going to have to get better, because
the competition will be better."
Card Notes
Olmstead slipped while running out a routine
grounder yesterday. While he appeared to suffer a
sprained ankle, X-rays were scheduled to be taken
last night on campus .

A young Cardinal baseball team was bap
tized into the world of big-time baseball by No.
8 Cal State-Fullerton this weekend, dropping
two of three late-inning thrillers to last year's
NCAA runners-up.
After taking the opening game 4-3 in dra
matic fashion, Stanford squandered leads in
the final two contests, falling 6-4 in 10 innings
Saturday and 7-5 yesterday.
The series began with a bang for the Cardi
nal in the opener. Down 3-2 with two outs in
the ninth, Stanford's Brian Dallimore drew a
walk. Up stepped A.J. Hinch, a catcher who
ranks as one of the best freshmen in college
baseball.
Believe the hype. On an 0-2 count, Hinch
drilled a home run into the left field stands,
giving the Cardinal a come-from-behind 4-3
win.
Matt Marenghi picked up the win for Stan
ford, while starter Willie Adams looked
impressive, allowing only four singles in six
innings of work.
On Saturday, the Cardinal staked itself to
an early four-run lead, thanks to doubles
from the bats of Nate Olmstead and Steve
Carver.
The more experienced Titans proceeded to
give Stanford a taste of its own medicine. After
tacking on three unearned runs in the third,
Fullerton tied the score at four when Dante

Powell scampered to an inside-the-park home
run.
Powell, a preseason All-American, plagued
the Cardinal all weekend with his bat. The
sophomore picked up five hits (including two
home runs) and three stolen bases in the
series.
With the score tied and two outs in the
10th, Stanford righthander Mario Iglesias hit
Fullerton designated hitter Adam Millan with
a fastball.
Up stepped first baseman D.C. Olsen, a
sophomore who had already contributed an
RBI single in the third. In a bittersweet
moment of deja vu for the Cardinal, Olsen
ended the contest with a two-run home run to
left.
Rubber-armed junior-college transfer Dan
Ricabal went the distance for the Titans,
throwing a Herculean 150 pitches in his 10
innings of work. Ricabal relied heavily on an
assortment of breaking pitches, effectively
