# Cardinal falls to Oregon, Fresno in last dual meets
## Individual showings by Johnson, Aguirre earn Pac-10 seedings 
### Sam Wu Staff Writer 
In most sports, coaches would
frown if team members concerned
themselves more with their own per
formances than with the whole
squad's. But for Stanford wrestlers,
personal pride and achievement truly
outweighed team considerations as the
Cardinal finished its regular season at
home against Oregon and Fresno
State this weekend.
Although Stanford came up short
against division rival Oregon 20-16
and fell to the Bulldogs 36-6 to finish
the season 3-6, a conference title was
not on the line. What did matter, how
ever, were individual records, which
affect personal seedings for the Pacific
10 Championships. Seniors Phil and
Dave Nowick also were looking to win
their last home matches.
In Friday night's contest with Ore
gon, 142-pound junior Lance Johnson
and 134-pound redshirt freshman
Jimmy Aguirre wrestled for Pac-10
seedings, which are granted to the top
four wrestlers in each nine-man
weight division. Both triumphed.
Johnson proved too much for the
Duck's Dustin Maddox. After an even
start, the junior exploded on Maddox,
allowing him to score only one point on
an escape. Johnson won by mcyor deci
sion — a victory by 8 to 14 points —
with a 12-1 final tally.
"Lance broke him," said coach
Chris Horpel. "He broke his spirit."
Aguirre also prevailed, but his
match remained tight throughout.
The freshman wrestled Cory Sonnen,
who boasted a 20-5 record to lead Ore-
S° n -
Sonnen recently received attention
for pinning 134-pound freshman Gary
Kolak of Penn State, who was ranked
third in the nation and was an alter
nate for the 1992 U.S. Olympic team
while still in high school.
Nonetheless, Aguirre held out to
win against Sonnen, 3-2.
Johnson's win propelled his dual
record to 7-1, ensuring him a seeding
in the Pac-10's, and Aguirre's victory
gave him a perfect 8-0 standing and a
top-two ranking. Dave Nowick also tri

umphed at 126-pounds, as did 150-
pound freshman Tod Surmon and
177-pound freshman Nathan Lovelle.
However, Phil Nowick lost his 118-
pound match 10-3, and Stanford lost
the duel on its final match at 190
pounds, in which Oregon's Scott Buz
zard defeated freshman Roger Liu.
Despite winning five individual match
es, the Cardinal couldn't overcome the
six-point lead Oregon received from
Stanford's forfeit of the heavyweight
division.
The Cardinal also forfeited both the
177-pound and heavyweight classes in
Saturday's encounter with top-10

opponent Fresno State. To make mat
ters worse, the Bulldogs featured four
nationally-ranked grapplers: 134-
pound senior Harold Zinkin, Ail-
American 142-pound sophomore
Gerry Abas, 150-pound senior Serge
Mezheritsky, and All-American heavy
weight senior Lorenzo Neal. They
were rated sixth, fourth, 11th and
third, respectively.
Horpel had admitted that winning
the second dual meet was unrealistic.
Individual performance was once
again the focus against the Bulldogs.
In a disappointing career finale,
both Nowicks lost their last home

matches. Phil lost in the third and
final period by a close decision of 4-2,
while brother Dave also came up short
16-12 in a flurry of position changes.
Dave could not overcome the quick leg
lunges of Fresno freshman Gary
Quintana, who scored four takedowns
by attacking Dave's lower body.
Aguirre hoped to close his dual
meet season at a perfect 9-0. Neither
he nor Zinkin of the Bulldogs scored
until the final period, when Zinkin
captured two points with a reversal,
shifting from the bottom position and
