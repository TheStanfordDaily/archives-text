## Senior wins Grand Slam title 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Senior Heather Willens has gathered a num
ber of impressive honors throughout her Stan
ford career. Now she can add a Collegiate Grand
Slam title to that collection.
Willens defeated freshman teammate Kim
Shasby in the final match of the Rolex Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships held Sunday in
Minneapolis, 6-4, 7-5. Willens captured her
first-ever Collegiate Grand Slam title with the
win, and became the first Stanford player to
win the Rolex Indoors since Tami Whitlinger
defeated Cardinal teammate Lisa Green in the
1989 Championships, 6-1, 6-1.
After taking the first set 6-4, Willens found
herself down 0-3 in the second set and struggling
to come back. Shasby, making her first appear
ance in a Collegiate Grand Slam, had four set
points in the second set, but could not convert on
any of them, as Willens rebounded to take seven
of the next nine games and the match.
Willens' win in the singles bracket capped off
four days of competition by some of Stanford's
top individual players. Freshman Beth Berris
and juniors Laxmi Poruri and Kristine Kurth
joined Willens and Shasby to make up the Car
dinal's five entries in the competition.
Berris and Kurth lost in the first round of
the doubles bracket to Kansas' team of Rebecca
Jensen and Mindy Weiner, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4.
Berris entered the tournament hampered by a
leg injury she suffered earlier that week, and,
according to Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan, hoped to "limp through" the weekend's
competition.
Stanford's team of Poruri and Willens, seed
ed No. 3 in their bracket, advanced to the final
match but were defeated by the N0.2-seeded
Texas team of Susan Gilchrist and Vicki Payn
ter, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-3. Gilchrist and Paynter
successfully defended their doubles champi
onship from last year, and Gilchrist captured
her third career Rolex Indoors doubles title
with the win.
In the singles bracket, Kurth dropped a first
round match to second-seeded Julie Exum from
Duke, 6-3, 6-2, while top-seeded Poruri was
shocked by unseeded Kelly Pace of Texas in the
second round, 7-5, 1-6, 7-5.
The Cardinal returns to action this weekend
hosting Pepperdine and San Diego State.
