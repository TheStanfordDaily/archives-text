### Kathryn Yang Staff Writer 
As the regular season winds down, the
Stanford women swimmers are starting to
catch fire, as they soundly defeated both
fifth-ranked SMU (132-108) and third
ranked Texas (167-133) over the weekend.
The Cardinal, ranked second in the
nation behind Florida, qualified two more
individuals for the NCAA Championships
en route to winning 10 of 15 events against
the Longhorns.
Freshman Lisa Jacob qualified with a
comfortable half-second to spare as she
came in second behind Jenny Thompson in
the 200-yard freestyle with a time of one
minute, 47.99 seconds.
Three races later, sophomore Julie Kole
achieved her qualifying time in the 200 but
terfly with another second-place finish, this
time behind co-captain Janel Jorgensen.
Kole's time of 1:59.61 is a career best for

her.
In addition, five other Cardinal swim
mers shaved valuable seconds off of their
NCAA qualifying marks in preparation for
the upcoming Pacific 10 Conference finals
and the NCAA Championships.
Olympian Lea Loveless continued to
improve her time in the 100 and 200 back
stroke by going under 54 seconds in the 100
back for the first time this year (53.95). Fel
low Olympian Thompson performed season
bests in the 50 and 200 free events, while
also winning the 100 free (22.76, 1:46.84
and 49.36, respectively).
Stanford's individual medley specialists,
Mary Ellen Blanchard and Kendra Thayer,
qualified for the 400 IM together last week
against USC. This week the tandem
improved their season bests against Texas
by finishing within three seconds of each
other, with times of 4:14.99 and 4:17.85
respectively.
Finally, co-captain and former Olympian

Janel Jorgensen bested her qualifying time
in the 200 fly (1:58.02), while winning the
100 fly as well (54.60).
Lori Heisick, who is still nursing an
injured foot, missed the 100 breaststroke
qualifying mark by 0.33 seconds with a win
ning time of 1:02.55.
"Overall I think we did a great job," said
Thayer. "We pulled together and swam the
best meet of the season. However, just
because we won against Texas doesn't
mean we can start making assumptions
about the NCAAs. We can never count
them out. They will be right at the top with
us and Florida."
Everyone agrees that the Cardinal has to
continue improving in order to top both
Texas and Florida in late March, despite
their positive performance over the week
end.
"The meet against Texas was an out
standing team effort, but our individual
races weren't winning performances at the

NCAAs," said Loveless. "I think it was a
solid meet consistency-wise because, even
though we weren't rested, we persevered
and swam just well enough to beat Texas.
But overall we've got a lot of work to do
still."
Before racing against the Longhorns, the
Cardinal faced off against SMU. Stanford
won only six of 13 events with most swim
mers limiting themselves to one event
apiece. The overall performance, however,
was enough to edge out the Mustangs.
"It was a meet where we just wanted to
go in and win without that much effort,"
Thayer said. "We basically wanted to get
out of SMU and focus on Texas."
Next week, Stanford will conclude its
regular season with a
dual meet against cross-bay rival California.
A two week training period will follow
before the squad heads to the Pac-10 cham
pionships, where it will try to bring its num
ber of individual NCAA qualifiers up to 17.
