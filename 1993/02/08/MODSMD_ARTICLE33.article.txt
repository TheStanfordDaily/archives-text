# Men's tennis comes up short at Rolex invite

Maybe it was the cold weather.
All four members of the Cardinal
men's tennis team were luke
warm at best this weekend at the
Rolex National Indoor Champi
onships in Minneapolis.
The invitation-only tourna
ment was attended by Robert
Devens and Michael Flanagan in
singles and Roman Sydorak and
Devens in doubles.
Flanagan's was the brightest
of the Cardinal performances.
After knocking out the tourna
ment's second-seeded player 6-4,
6-0 in the first round, Flanagan
eliminated Arkansas' top player,
Marcus Hilpert, 6-0, 6-2.
The quarterfinal round was not
quite as successful for Flanagan.
Chris Woodruff, Tennessee's top
talent, woke up in the third set to
defeat Flanagan 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.
"He played a lot smarter than
the other guys I played," Flana
gan said. "He hit hard off the
baseline and kept the ball in
play." Although the Stanford
junior was ahead 4-3 and serving
in the third set, Woodruff picked
up and eventually won the match.

Devens had the misfortune of
battling with the nation's top
ranked collegian, Daniel Courcol, in
the first round. Courcol's big serve
on Minneapolis' fast indoor courts
was too much for Devens. Courcol
came out on top, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (5), 6-2.
Missing the big points was the
story of the Cardinal's doubles
performance as well. Devens and
Sydorak were defeated by Col
orado's Stefen Figley and Jeff
Spiers, 6-3,6-1, in the first round.
"We were terrible in doubles!"
exclaimed Devens, "I don't know
what happened." Sydorak agreed
with his partner: "They were
pretty good and we didn't play too
well."
Virtually every time the Cardi
nal duo set up a point, they would
make a careless error and throw
the point away. "We held serve
easily, but they hung in there and
got a couple lucky balls," Sydorak
explained.
Tomorrow the full Cardinal
squad takes on San Jose State at
1:30 p.m. at home. The Spartans
are led by several solid, experi
enced players at the top of their
lineup, but the team as a whole has
not done exceptionally well this
season, according to Sydorak.
