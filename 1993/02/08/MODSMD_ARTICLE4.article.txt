# Wanted: Forks, spoons, mugs
## Petty theft up in dining halls 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
"Borrowing" a few spoons and forks from Food Ser
vice — and maybe a latte mug from the Coffee House
— may seem trivial to some students, but these inci
dents of petty theft are quickly adding up for Univer
sity eating establishments.
Petty theft — defined as stealing items worth
under $400 — is on the rise in dining halls, said
Melanie Jones-Carter, the Food Service board plan
operations manager.
Jones-Carter, who has worked in Food Service for
six years, said the stealing of "miscellaneous items"
— such as utensils, cups and trays — is still a problem
within her division, despite previous and ongoing ef
forts to control pilfering.
Jones-Carter said miscellaneous items at Wilbur
Hall are stolen so often that Food Service is forced to
purchase about 10 pieces of silverware and a dozen
cups for each student every year.
At the end of fall quarter, Food Service had to re
place 3,000 lost cups at Wilbur Food Service, 1,500 at
Lagunita and 1,300 at Florence Moore, according to
Jones-Carter.
This year, Food Service began providing all students
with insulated 16 oz. plastic mugs — free of charge —
in order to deter students from taking dining hall cups.
The plan was also implemented to reduce the amount
of broken cups.
"We'll be offering [the plastic mugs] every year to
incoming freshman from now on," she said.
The distribution of mugs "has helped [reduce
theft] in some operations," she
said, "but there is still a lot of dis
regard for the equipment."
Students "need to be aware
that the actions they take in the
University Food Service opera
tions do have an impact on what
we're able to provide for them"
Jones-Carter added.
"If our costs on small wares
and miscellaneous items were
reduced . . . we'd be able to
increase the level of service,"
Jones-Carter said.
Food Service managers also
consider the possibilities of theft
when they purchase equipment
and decorations.
For example, they may opt to
buy lower quality waffle irons due
to prevalent theft. "We don't
want to buy industrial strength
ones," she said, because they'll
"walk right out the door."
If students truly "borrowed"
items from Food Service and even
tually returned them, Jones-Carter

said, new items wouldn't have to be
purchased annually. The problem
now is that most silverware and
cups that are borrowed "end up in
trash cans and bushes."
Craig Mitchell, the Food Ser
vice a la carte operations manag
er, acknowledged pilfering as a
"fact of life in Food Service." But
Mitchell said, "it is not cost effec
tive [to combat the problem] in
the small amount of items that
you lose."
Contary to student belief,
Mitchell said petty theft does not
affect dining hall prices.
Food Service is not the only place
on campus that has to deal with
tableware theft. Edna Chavira,
manager of the Coffee House said
that during spring quarter of last
year, "basically everything we put
out... mugs, glasses" was stolen.
To curb the excessive theft,
this fall the Coffee House began
taking IDs as collateral for pitch
ers. If the pitcher is not returned,
the borrower is fined $5.
According to Chavira, taking
IDs has been successful in curbing
the theft of pitchers and glasses.
She estimated that before this

measure was taken, the Coffee
House lost up to $400 worth of
pitchers and 100 to 150 pint glass
es each week due to theft.
Chavira noted that before pre
ventative measures were taken,
the Coffee House "just took [the
stealing] as a loss."
