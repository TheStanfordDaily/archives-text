# The 						'ethic of rebelling'
## New seminars examine counterculture literature 
### Kris McNeil Staff writer 
Remember those up-until-four-in-the
morning discussions of the meaning of in
dividuality and life that occur so often in
the first year at Stanford? Wouldn't it be
nice to receive academic credit for those
late nights?
For five sophomores, those discussions
have moved to early Wednesday evenings,
becoming a "dialogue tutorial" on the im
portance of individual perspectives in
counterculture literature.
This "American Counterculture Litera
ture" dialogue is one of six new tutorials of

fered this quarter. With topics ranging from
"Gay Novels and Gay Identity" to "Foot
binding, Menarche and Work in China," the
two to four person discussion groups spon
sored by the Office of Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities offer nearly 30 sopho
mores the opportunity to take small classes
in an informal and relaxed environment.
Keith Gandal, a lecturer in Values,
Technology, Science and Society, said he
designed "American Counterculture Lit
erature" to explore "the idea of alterna
tive ethics."
"You get a dose of fthe Protestant capi-
talist tradition 1 growing up as a
child," said Gandal. "When you
arrive in junior high, there's a
new ethic of exploration and
rebelling against your parents."
Gandal said by studying the
characters in the novels, students
are able to explore the many dif
ferent and often conflicting ethics
in an individual's life.
The members of his dialogue
were selected from about 15 appli
cants. Gandal explained that each
of the five students he selected
had some kind of background

interest in topics related to coun
terculture, such as jazz or juvenile
delinquency.
Although each applied for the
class for different reasons, the
students have a common love of
the material, he said.
Matt Onek said he thought it
would be a good opportunity to
work with Gandal, while Eliza
beth Kelly just loves the idea of
small classes and individualized
attention.
The size of the dialogue gives it
an informal, relaxed atmosphere
which is rare at Stanford. Both
the students and the professor
jump into the conversation when
the idea strikes. And differences
of opinion often abound.

"Some other discussion sec
tions I've taken aren't really dis
cussions at all," said Kelly, a pos
sible Modern Thought and Litera
ture major. "A problem I've had
with most of them is that they're
usually more like a series of
monologues, each person trying
to earn brownie points with the
professor.
"But here it really is a discus
sion, and maybe that's because of
the selection process, because peo
ple are really interested in the
readings they're more prepared,"
she added.
Sue Reinhold, the program
coordinator for sophomore dia
logues and seminars, explained
the classes were designed as a way

to "get sophomores into a situa
tion where they could form a rela
tionship with a faculty member."
In Gandal's class, there are no
written assignments or tests â€”
and no notes. Students spend
their time talking and thinking,
rather than scribbling.
The pace of readings and discus
sions is also relaxed and unstruc
tured. "We don't have a strict
itinerary," Gandal said. "We have a
book list, but we don't have a syl
labus so we can go at our own pace."
The class has read and dis
cussed several books, including
Henry Miller's "Tropic of Cancer"
and William Burroughs's "Junky."
Although counterculture litera
ture tends to focus on characters

in situations very different than
those of most Stanford students,
Gandal said he feels the underly
ing questions are common to most
individuals.
"I have tried to pick books which
can't help but touch on issues
which relate to what's important in
students' lives," Gandal said.
Onek said he appreciated the
lack of pressure of the dialogue
environment. "We do about a book
a week, but it's flexible. If we feel
like discussing a book for more
than one week, then that's okay,"
he said. "The class is very directed
by what the students are interest
ed in doing and what they can do.
Other students say the class has
taught them how to be comfortable

in a small class. "I've learned a lot
about the responsibility involved in
participating in small group discus
sion," said English major Bill
Hogan. "We had to apply so people
are really committed to it and they
come to class with the reading done
and lots of ideas."
Gandal said the group discus
sions are often as educational for
him as for the students. "I don't
feel the need to run things or talk
all the time. I don't feel the need
to present the material. I have
things to say, but I'm not struc
turing the class.
"In this class everyone is able
to emerge as a personality, where
in a larger class only a few people
get to stand out." he added.
