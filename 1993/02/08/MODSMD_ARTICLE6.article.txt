# Around the world and back
## Senior takes time off to make global trip 
### Shankar Vedantam 
During the fall of 1991, Patrick Krago
decided to spend his tuition money in a dif
ferent way. He visited Thailand.
And Hong Kong. And Indonesia. And
Bali. And Singapore. And, oh yes, Bhutan,
Nepal, Tibet and India. He also stopped in
Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Eng
land on his way home.
Krago, now a senior majoring in politi
cal science, took the holiday as part of a
year-long break from Stanford.
"You are challenged to ask yourself what
you are about," he said, explaining why he
took the trip. "Why do other people think

the way they do? Why are we so different?
"[Are we] better?" he muses after a
pause.
Deciding that a year-long hiatus would
enhance his education, Krago decided to
postpone his graduation by a year and
work for a hospital in Denver. But, nine
months later he was unsure of his decision.
"I really wondered at that point if I
should have taken the year off," he said.
It was then that his girlfriend, whom
he had met at the hospital, suggested the
idea of an around-the-world trip. It didn't
take much to convince Krago.
The couple embarked on their
three month voyage with almost
no planning except their initial
destination — Hong Kong.
"We used to give the airlines
people 12 hours notice," Krago
said with a smile. "We would go to
a place and then decide how long
we wanted to stay there."
Shying away from the beaten
path helped Krago see a lot more
than the average tourist — but
also brought plenty of excitement
— and fear.
He recalls the time the couple
landed in Djakarta, Indonesia, at
11:30 p.m., without reservations
or even any idea where the near
est hotel was.
Desperate to find accommoda

tions for the night, the only per
son they could find was "this guy
holding a laminated brochure of a
hotel.
"He was the only one around.
We had no choice," Krago said.
After the couple had got into
the truck of their "benefactor" —
and found there were three other
men already in it — they
embarked on a journey that
remains clearly etched in his mind.
"The first thing was that we
took the wrong turn from the air
port," Krago said. "The hotel was
supposed to be to the left, the
truck turned right."
They then drove nearly 45
minutes on completely dark roads
— instead of the 10 minute trip it
was supposed to be — as Krago
began to feel for the pocket knife
he carried with him. Visions of
"The Killing F'ields" flitted before
his imagination.

"I kept asking myself how
many of them I could take before
they did something to us," he
recalled.
"I can't explain the relief I felt
when we finally saw the hotel,
'The Genkara Airport Hotel,'"
Krago said. "It was the only light
ed building for miles around.
"I kept saying 'We're safe,
we're there.' " The circuitous
route, Krago discovered later, was
because the usual route was
under construction.
In Bangkok, Krago committed a
Thai-style faux pas. Not knowing
about the local custom of stooping
before one's superiors, Krago visit
ed the house of his friend's boss —
and stood towering over him — to
the severe discomfort of both
Krago's friend and his boss.
Krago recommends travellers
visit Asia as soon as possible
"because rapid industrialization

will ensure that it will not be the
same in five years' time.
"I tell people that if they have
questions, if they want to know
about themselves, to do it now,"
he said. "I'm really glad now that
I took the trip. [After the trip,
Stanford] felt like a total, total
country club."
Krago says because he had to
make the trip on a shoe-string
budget of $3,800 he learned to live
by his wits.
"I paid attention to people
before I spoke; I was conscious
about how I spoke to them," he
said. "It's a matter of sensitivity,
not [political correctness]."
But despite his exhortations to
go out and see the world, Krago
does impart a bit of advice to the
Asian-bound traveler.
"Remember to ask for a room
with a Western-style toilet and a
fan," he said, smiling.

route, Krago discovered later, was
because the usual route was
under construction.
In Bangkok, Krago committed a
Thai-style faux pas. Not knowing
about the local custom of stooping
before one's superiors, Krago visit
ed the house of his friend's boss —
and stood towering over him — to
the severe discomfort of both
Krago's friend and his boss.
Krago recommends travellers
visit Asia as soon as possible
"because rapid industrialization

will ensure that it will not be the
same in five years' time.
"I tell people that if they have
questions, if they want to know
about themselves, to do it now,"
he said. "I'm really glad now that
I took the trip. [After the trip,
Stanford] felt like a total, total
country club."
Krago says because he had to
make the trip on a shoe-string
budget of $3,800 he learned to live
by his wits.
"I paid attention to people
before I spoke; I was conscious
about how I spoke to them," he
said. "It's a matter of sensitivity,
not [political correctness]."
But despite his exhortations to
go out and see the world, Krago
does impart a bit of advice to the
Asian-bound traveler.
"Remember to ask for a room
with a Western-style toilet and a
fan," he said, smiling.

Globe-hopping senior Patrick Krago visited 14 countries as part of
a year-long break from Stanford. His advice to fellow travelers?
"Remember to ask for a room with a Western-style toilet and fan."
