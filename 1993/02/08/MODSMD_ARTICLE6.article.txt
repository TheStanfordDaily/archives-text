# Around the world and back
## Senior takes time off to make global trip 
### Shankar Vedantam 
During the fall of 1991, Patrick Krago
decided to spend his tuition money in a dif
ferent way. He visited Thailand.
And Hong Kong. And Indonesia. And
Bali. And Singapore. And, oh yes, Bhutan,
Nepal, Tibet and India. He also stopped in
Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Eng
land on his way home.
Krago, now a senior majoring in politi
cal science, took the holiday as part of a
year-long break from Stanford.
"You are challenged to ask yourself what
you are about," he said, explaining why he
took the trip. "Why do other people think

the way they do? Why are we so different?
"[Are we] better?" he muses after a
pause.
Deciding that a year-long hiatus would
enhance his education, Krago decided to
postpone his graduation by a year and
work for a hospital in Denver. But, nine
months later he was unsure of his decision.
"I really wondered at that point if I
should have taken the year off," he said.
It was then that his girlfriend, whom
he had met at the hospital, suggested the
idea of an around-the-world trip. It didn't
take much to convince Krago.
