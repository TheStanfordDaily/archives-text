# Prof. plans bike helmet awareness drive
## Hopes to reduce alarming number of head injuries 
### Matthew Gregory 
Every week an unconscious student
is rushed to Stanford Hospital's trauma
center because of a bicycle accident, says
Assistant Professor of Surgery Ricardo
Martinez.
In an effort to cut down on the num
ber of head wounds students receive
while pedaling to class, Martinez is plan
ning to launch a low-cost helmet distrib
ution program.
"There's no reason the number (of
accidents) should be that high," said
Martinez.
The distribution is scheduled to begin
in May, during National Bicycle Safety
Month. Martinez is currently negotiat
ing with various bicycle helmet manu
facturers to sell helmets to community
members at a discounted price.
"We've got several helmet companies
that are interested in the project and are
willing to make their helmets available
at a lower price through the University,"
Martinez said.
In January, Martinez met with repre
sentatives from a number of campus or
ganizations — including Cowell Student
Health Center, the Office of Public Safe
ty, Transportation Programs and Stan
ford Children's Hospital — in order to
coordinate other activities for the
month-long program.
Although plans for the distribution

are still in the works, Martinez said he
hopes bicycle safety training and dorm
presentations will be included in the
final schedule. He said he also intends to
approach student organizations, includ
ing the Stanford Cycling Club, for their

participation.

Eighty-five percent of head injuries could be avoided if bikers wore helmets, ac

helmets on campus at a discounted price.
this scale before.
According to Martinez, only
eight percent of bikers on cam
pus wear helmets. "When we saw
this, we realized that people had
to be made aware of the danger,"
he said, adding that 85 percent of
head injuries could be avoided if
bikers wore helmets.
Although Martinez has not
yet received enough funds to
cover the costs of the bicycle
safety program, he expects the
program to be inexpensive, with

most expenses related to publici
ty. But he added, "We'll take
money from wherever we can get
it."
Brad Zlotnick, an emergency
medicine resident involved in the
effort, explained that the doctors
would like to eventually expand
the program "along the lines of
the alcohol awareness program on
campus — with students as role
models."
Martinez said he also hopes to
run public service announce
ments in campus publications to
raise awareness.
"As you increase awareness,
people start doing things to pro
tect themselves," he said.
