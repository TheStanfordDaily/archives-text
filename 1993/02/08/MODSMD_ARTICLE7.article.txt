# Prof. plans bike helmet awareness drive
## Hopes to reduce alarming number of head injuries 
### Matthew Gregory 
Every week an unconscious student
is rushed to Stanford Hospital's trauma
center because of a bicycle accident, says
Assistant Professor of Surgery Ricardo
Martinez.
In an effort to cut down on the num
ber of head wounds students receive
while pedaling to class, Martinez is plan
ning to launch a low-cost helmet distrib
ution program.
"There's no reason the number (of
accidents) should be that high," said
Martinez.
The distribution is scheduled to begin
in May, during National Bicycle Safety
Month. Martinez is currently negotiat
ing with various bicycle helmet manu
facturers to sell helmets to community
members at a discounted price.
"We've got several helmet companies
that are interested in the project and are
willing to make their helmets available
at a lower price through the University,"
Martinez said.
In January, Martinez met with repre
sentatives from a number of campus or
ganizations — including Cowell Student
Health Center, the Office of Public Safe
ty, Transportation Programs and Stan
ford Children's Hospital — in order to
coordinate other activities for the
month-long program.
Although plans for the distribution

are still in the works, Martinez said he
hopes bicycle safety training and dorm
presentations will be included in the
final schedule. He said he also intends to
approach student organizations, includ
ing the Stanford Cycling Club, for their

participation.
