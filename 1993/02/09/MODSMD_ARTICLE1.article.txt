# Hike in tuition, cutbacks likely, trustee predicts
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Michael Perez admits it: Stanford has budget
problems.
"I wish I had some solution but I don't," the
youngest member of the Board of Trustees said. "I
think there's going to be a tuition increase."
The 28-year-old Perez spoke frankly about the
University's budget and other issues last night at El
Centro Chicano before a group of about 15 students.
One of two Latinos on the board, Perez said there
are three sources of money available to the Universi
ty: the endowment, government funds and student
tuition. Government funds have recently been cut for
universities across the nation, he said, and the
trustees have had to use more of the endowment
funds than ever before.
In addition to the probable increase in student tu
ition rates, which is expected to be approved by the
board today, Perez said some University programs
will most likely be abandoned to help ease the budget
crunch.
"If the University is going to make cuts, it'll be the
cultural programs that are cut first," he said.
Despite the school's smaller budget, Perez said,
there has been no discussion about changing Stan
ford's need-blind admissions policy. However, he said
the decrease in funds may affect students' financial
aid packages.
Perez graduated from Stanford in 1987 with a
double major in human biology and psychology. He
then attended UCLA Law School and is now an attor
ney in San Diego.
He has served about eight months of his five-year
term as a trustee, and said he enjoys the job. "Being
on the board is important because
when I was a student at Stanford,
a lot of decisions were made that I
didn't agree with," he said.
Perez said he tries to keep
abreast of current student con
cerns by visiting campus about
twice a month, reading student
publications and talking with
other trustees.
"One reason I like to keep in
touch is so I can relate to students
and feel comfortable talking to
them," he said. "I think that it's
important for the students to
know I'm accessible."
He added that since he is so
young, the other trustees expect
him to know "what's going on"
around campus.
Perez recently ate at Madera,
Larkin and Adams houses and
spoke to various campus organiza
tions at meetings arranged by the
ASSU. He said he is always excited
about talking to student groups.
Since graduating from UCLA,
Perez has remained active in com
munity service groups in the San
Diego area. He said he tries to
encourage high school students to
apply to Stanford.
"There is a large number of
students who don't apply because
of the tuition," he said. "I tell peo

pie to apply, but there are still a
lot of places that are untouched."
Perez cited domestic partners
benefits as one of the most press
ing campus issues. "By offering
benefits to both same-sex and

opposite-sex couples, we put our
selves on the forefront of the
issues," he said.
Junior Delia Lopez, co-chair of
Derechos, a Latino pre-law soci
ety, said she believes Perez will act

as a "link" between the trustees
and students, especially Chicano-
Latino students.
"Since he's made an effort to
talk with Ithe students], we feel
like we can talk to him," she said.
