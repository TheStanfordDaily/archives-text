# Prosecutor says Reagan advisers lied
## Shultz and Regan would have testified on illegal arms activity 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Ronald Reagan's
chief of staff and secretary of state had been
prepared to testify that his administration
misstated facts about the Iran arms sales to
protect the president from impeachment, the
Iran-Contra prosecutor asserted yesterday.
Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh sug
gested in a report to Congress that Attorney
General Edwin Meese "was warning the pres
ident's advisers that to disclose the president's
knowledge" of a 1985 missile shipment to Iran
"would expose him to a charge of illegal activ
ity."
If former Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger had gone to trial, ex-White House chief
of staff Donald Regan was prepared to testify
that he, Regan, knew it was untrue when
Meese stated in a Nov. 24, 1986, White House
meeting that the president hadn't known
about the Hawk missile shipment, Walsh said
in an interim report to Congress.
Regan "was concerned about the possibility
of impeachment," Walsh contended.
Reagan, Meese and then-Secretary of State
George Shultz, currently a Distinguished Fel

low at the Hoover Institution, all knew at the
Nov. 24, 1986, meeting that Meese's state
ment regarding the president's knowledge
"was false," said Walsh's report.
And "Vice President Bush should have
known the statement was false, because he
was present for a national security briefing in
1985 at which (national security adviser
Robert) McFarlane explained" the shipment,
the report added.
Moreover, Weinberger "should have known
that Meese's statement. . . was false" because
McFarlane had told Weinberger about it, the
report concluded.
Weinberger's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said
Walsh had compiled "a work of fiction ... that is
all old stuff which is not supported by the evi
dence." Walsh is "a bitter man trying to rehabil
itate a damaged reputation," said Bennett.
A Weinberger trial "would have exposed
new evidence of the administration's efforts to
conceal the facts of the Iran arms sales from
the public and from Congress," Walsh said in
the report.
The trial was canceled when President

Bush pardoned Weinberger and five other
Iran-Contra figures on Christmas Eve. Walsh
called the pardon a "misuse of thi3 power."
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, a fre
quent critic of Walsh's investigation, called
the report "a last ditch effort to justify his
extravagant $35 million partisan crusade."
On Nov. 25, 1986, Meese told a national
television audience that Reagan hadn't known
about the Hawk shipment. Three days earlier,
Shultz had told the attorney general other
wise, according to notes dictated by Shultz.
Walsh said Shultz was prepared to testify at
trial that he was concerned "the White House
was attempting to 'rearrange the record' " by
announcing in 1986 that Reagan hadn't
known about the November 1985 arms-for
hostages deal. The president's aides feared the
missile shipment to Iran violated the Arms
Export Control Act.
Reagan spokeswoman Cathy Goldberg said
in Los Angeles that the former president was
out of town and would not have a statement.
Shultz declined to comment, said Phyllis
Whiting, his assistant at Hoover.
