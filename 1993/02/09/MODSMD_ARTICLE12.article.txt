130 die in Iranian crash
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — An Iranian airliner
with 132 people on board collided with an air force
jet after takeoff yesterday from Tehran's main
airport and exploded in a fireball as it plummeted
into a military compound. There were no sur
vivors.
The leased, Russian-piloted Tupolev airliner
was bound for the northeastern Shiite Muslim
holy city of Mashhad, and most of its 119 Iranian
passengers were pilgrims. The crew of 13 includ
ed a Russian pilot and four other Russians. No
other foreigners were on board, aviation authori
ties said.
The Russian-designed Sukhoi fighter was tak
ing part in an exercise to mark Air Force Day.
Authorities gave no information about the
crew of the fighter, but Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported that both the
pilot and co-pilot were believed killed.
The plane fell in an empty lot inside a com
pound of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, 25

miles from the center of the capital.
There were no casualties on the ground, sen
tries at the base said.
Nursing careers look healthy
NEW YORK (AP) — In this year's recruiting
season for college graduates, nurses are hot but
aerospace engineers are not.
Companies hope to hire more college graduates
this year than in 1992, but only a few fields are
expected to benefit, college placement officers say.
With many companies restructuring and elimi
nating jobs, there are fewer openings for job-seek
ers straight out of school.
Health care is one industry that is hiring, said
Dawn Oberman, a statistical services specialist at
College Placement Council Inc. in Bethlehem, Pa.
A focus on the environment has created openings
for engineers, geologists, biologists, and chemists.
But military cutbacks and hardships in the com
mercial airline industry have virtually shut down
the market for new aerospace engineers.
