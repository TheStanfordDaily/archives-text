### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A gun
man who witnesses said was
yelling for pain medicine burst into
a hospital emergency room yester
day, shot three doctors, one of
them critically, took at least two
hostages and holed up in the medi
cal center, officials said.
The gunman entered the walk
in emergency room at Los Angeles
County-University of Southern
California Medical Center at 12:40
p.m., said hospital spokesman Har
vey Kern.
He opened fire on a group of
doctors sitting at a desk near the
door, Kern said.
Patient Hope Flynn said she
heard a man demanding pain
medication seconds before the
shots rang out.
"Bang, bang, bang, bang," she
said. "He was yelling, 'I want
something for pain, can't you
understand me? Can't you see I

need help.' "
"They treated him with no
respect," an unidentified witness
told a television reporter. "Every
one is human. He was sick. I
guess they refused his medication
and he went off."
After the shooting, the attacker
took several hostages and was bar
ricaded in an isolated section of
the emergency room on the first
floor of the hospital, police said.
Negotiators were in contact
with the gunman for about two
hours after the shootings, but
there was no immediate word on
any demands, exactly how many
hostages were involved or their
conditions.
The man identified himself to
negotiators as 45 years old and "as
a disgruntled former patient. It
apparently has to do with what he
perceives to be poor medical treat
ment," said police Lt. John Dunkin.

Dunkin was not sure if the
man was unhappy about treat
ment received at County-USC or
at another hospital.
Dr. Gail Anderson, director of
emergency medicine, said the
most seriously injured doctor sus
tained gunshot wounds to the
chest and scalp. The other two,
she said, sustained less serious
injuries and their conditions were
upgraded to critical but stable.
"One was shot in the chest and
abdomen; he went to the operating
room. The other was shot in the
right shoulder and chests, he has a
collapsed lung. The other was hit
in the rignt temple and right arm,"
said hospital spokeswoman Adelai
da De La Cerda.
The hospital, which is located
about three miles northeast of
downtown Los Angeles, was cor
doned off and SWAT members
called in. .
