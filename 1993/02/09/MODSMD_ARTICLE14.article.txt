# Clinton spares Social Security, but budget struggle continues
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House abandoned consideration of a one
year freeze on Social Security benefits yes
terday after an outcry from senior citizens
and congressional Democrats. It seems
more likely now that taxes will be raised
on Social Security benefits to the well-off.
But as Clinton continued to struggle
with elements of his deficit-reduction pack
age, he declared a short-term stimulus
package nearly complete. He also moved to
extend a related program that provides
extra benefits for unemployed workers.
Saying hard times remain despite
improved economic statistics, Clinton
announced he will send Congress legisla

tion to prolong a program allowing the
jobless to draw up to 26 weeks of unem
ployment benefits beyond the 26 weeks in
the basic law.
He coupled the extension with a pro
posal to make it easier for permanently
displaced workers to take advantage of
job-retraining services.
"There are now 3 million jobs less in
this economy than there would be if we
were in a normal recovery," Clinton said.
Clinton said he's made most of the major
decisions on the economic-stimulus pack
age that he will unveil in a speech to
Congress on Feb. 17.
"We're going to go back over it one

more time to refine it,"he said. The
unemployment-compensation package is
part of that stimulus program, which
overall is expected to cost about $31 bil
lion, divided between job-producing pro
grams and business tax breaks.
The deficit reduction part of the pro
gram that Clinton will outline at the
same time was not as well along as the
stimulus part. The administration
backed away entirely from a proposal it
earlier said it was considering — a one
year freeze on cost-of-living increases for
Social Security recipients.
That proposal was denounced by senior
citizens and Democratic lawmakers. A

more likely option is raising taxes on Social
Security benefits paid to the well-off.
It and the cost-of-living freeze were
reportedly the two main items under
review in terms of Social Security changes
in a program that Clinton has said will
mean "shared sacrifice."
Retired couples with incomes above
$32,000 — and individuals with incomes
above $25,000 — now must pay income
taxes on 50 percent of their Social Securi
ty benefits.
Administration officials, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said that Clinton is
considering increasing that level to about
85 percent.

In other developments on the econom
ic package:
• White House Communications Direc
tor George Stephanopoulos fueled specu
lation that Clinton might propose
increasing corporate income taxes —
from the current top rate of 34 percent to
36 percent. The president already is
expected to raise the top rate on families
earning over $200,000 from 31 percent to
36 percent.
• Clinton was poised to announce a
series of cuts in the White House staff
today. He pledged in his campaign to reduce
the staff by 25 percent, and Stephanopou
los said he would follow through.
