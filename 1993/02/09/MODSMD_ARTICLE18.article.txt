## New loans — a boon 
### 
SIMPLICITY IS BEST, espe
cially when it comes to finan
cial aid.
As anyone who's ever applied for
aid knows, the current process is at
best unnecessarily complex, con
fusing and time-consuming. At
worst, it's insufficient, unfair and
sets students up for default, bur
dening the government and our
generation with more and more
debt.
An end to this mockery of a "sys
tem" may be in sight, however. A
Congressionally commissioned
committee of educators and civic
leaders has, after two years of
study, come up with a comprehen
sive and logical recommendation to
overhaul the financial-aid process.
In essence, the proposal suggests
that an additional $7 billion a year
be spent on financial aid; that all
undergraduates be given the same
amount of assistance — $14,000 —
but that the mix of grants, work
study, subsidized loans and unsub

sidized loans be adjusted for family
income; that the government devel
op a national-service program to let
students work off loans; and that
the existing system of private
lenders, guaranty agencies and
loan servicers be replaced by direct
loans from the Treasury.
And while a specific plan to pay
for all these changes hasn't been
explicitly laid out, there are some
built-in measures that should at
least cover part of the plan. Cutting
out the middlemen will save a pro
jected $1 billion; allowing students
to repay through service will elimi
nate the government's cost of
employing other people to do needed
work; and by having the govern
ment administer the pay-out, loan
collection is virtually ensured
through the Internal Revenue Ser
vice.
The private sector has failed to
produce a solution to the nation's
educational-finance woes. It's time
for government to step in.
