# Or are they a bust?

Everyone likes to get
something for nothing. And
the new college-loan pro
gram produced by a presidential
commission seems to promise
some college students attractive
financial-aid packages for what
amounts to nothing.
However, as attractive as the
new college-loan program may
appear, you quite simply can't get
something for nothing. The loans
and other gimmicks endorsed by
the new program will undoubtedly
cause widespread abuse, financial
loss and a worse financial-aid
scheme than is currently in place.
It's not as if the college finan
cial-aid situation is as unremit
tingly bleak as the situation of our
inner cities or health-care system.
Indeed, the Federal Government
spends twice what they spent 10
years ago on loans and grants. The
new proposal would add $7 billion

more, mostly to those who need
the money the least (the money is
not financially prioritized).
Much of this money is unrecov
erable for the government. The
rates of repayment on college
loans are notoriously low, a traves
ty which the new law fails to
address.
Therefore, the federal govern
ment would, under the new plan,
spend $27 billion every year to
ensure that middle-class students
can attend the university of their
choice. Couldn't this money be
better spent on inner-city schools?
On one hand, you have the
opportunity to allow a student to
pick and choose what college to
attend; on the other, you can help
ensure that future students have
the ability, the desire and the
preparation to get into college in
the first place.
It's a question of priorities.
