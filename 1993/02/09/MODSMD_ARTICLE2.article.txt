# Disease-focused Ph.D. program awaits approval
## 
### Neerad Lai Staff writer 
Funded with a $900,000 private grant, a new
School of Medicine Ph.D. program dealing with the
molecular mechanisms of disease is expected to be
proposed to the Faculty Senate within the next few
weeks.
If the program is approved, the first group of 10
students will enroll in the fall of 1994. Each will un
dergo a four-year course of study that will include ex
tensive training in human pathology, molecular biol
ogy, biochemistry and genetics.
The Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust will fund
the program for the next eight years. The Miami
based trust supports "the integration of training in
molecular biology and human disease," according to a
statement released last week.
Stanford is one of six institutions in the nation to
receive a grant from the trust. The awards, totaling
$11.5 million dollars, are "designed to enable Ph.D.
candidates in the basic biological sciences to become
more familiar with human disease
problems."
"There is a broad general con
cern today that the extraordinary
discoveries of modern molecular
biology are not being utilized with

sufficient speed in the study of
human disease, diagnosis and
treatment," Louis Hector, chair
man of the trust, said in the state
ment.
"We hope our general organi
zational grants will serve as mod
els for training of future medical
scientists who will help bridge
this gap."
The program will be an

interdepartmental venture
administered by Pathology
Department Chair Dr. Klaus
Bensch and Dr. Michael Lieber,
an assistant professor in the
department.
Neither Bensch nor Lieber
would expand on the comments
they made in the statement.
Lieber said he preferred to wait
until the proposal was approved

by the Faculty Senate.
After taking courses in general
and organ-specific pathology as
well as molecular pathobiology for
two years, students will have the
opportunity to choose supervisors
for their Ph.D. dissertation
research from a broad range of
departments in the Medical
School or the Department of Bio
logical Sciences.
