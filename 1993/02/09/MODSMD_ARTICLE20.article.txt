Brooks Johnson's abuse hurt Stanford as well as team

IT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT
David Frank read Tish Williams'
Brooks Johnson article with "amuse
ment and fondness." For whom was this
fondness directed? What could be more
amusing than reading about how a
grown man, in a position of authority,
verbally abused young women who were
in his charge? This question is not mere
ly rhetorical — it is a query directed at
an apparent rationalization of abusive
behavior that appears specious at best
and sadistic at worst.
The letter-writer misses the point
when he refers to Ms. Williams' article
as expressing merely an "opinion." The
article states facts — facts which have
been rumored and suppressed for too
long; facts which contain alarming reve
lations; facts which reveal a truth with
which the University and Athletic
Department now must deal.
The letter-writer seeks to exonerate
abusive behavior by pointing out certain
team and individual successes during

the 13-year tenure of coach Johnson.
Let's hope that a few individuals and
teams were able either to cope with or
overcome the excoriating verbal tirades
of a tyrannical coach and perform credi
bly for the University. However, a few
NCAA cross-country "successes" over a
period of 13 years is hardly a rousing
testimonial to great coaching ability.
Let's examine the qualities which most
would agree should be present in an effec
tive coach: he must be supportive of those
for whom he is responsible; encouraging
toward all of his athletes; stable and self
disciplined; sensitive to the needs of his
charges; well-versed in the training for his
sport and intelligent in the application of
his expertise. Based on knowledge
acquired from an intimate source — my
daughter, Wendy Neely — I would say
coach Johnson fell short on all counts.
The role a coach plays — that of men
tor, role model, motivator, trainer, pro
fessional sportsman, as well as in loco
parentis to those far from home and

family (despite the apparent disclaimer
by Mr. Frank) — is extremely important
to those who look up to him for advice
and training. In every one of these roles,
coach Johnson failed monumentally, for
my daughter and many others. This was
not just negligence — this was a
tragedy. Talent and energy were wasted,
and the chance for Stanford's distance
runners to shine on behalf of the Uni
versity was destroyed.
The final indignity in Mr. Frank's let
ter is his revelation that "being called
'shithead' may be just what one needs."
Is this because Stanford students are
constantly being told how great they are
by virtue of the fact that they are at
Stanford? This would be funny if it were
tongue-in-cheek. But if it is meant to be
taken seriously, the writer is as twisted
as the coach he attempts to defend. Ver
bally abusive language and name-calling
is the mark of a very dysfunctional
human being. Four-letter words are easy
to say — a parrot or a two-year-old can

learn to say them. A truly caring and
educated person would never stoop to
that level, and it is unthinkable that
such excretory language would be used
to motivate another human being.
Please reexamine your goals and pri
orities in life, Mr. Frank —we need no
more educated persons who think that
foul language is a great motivator, that
head-locks practiced on 19-year-old
women are great discipline tactics and
that humiliation and degradation are the
means for obtaining outstanding perfor
mances from athletes who proved able to
produce outstanding performances prior
to such methods, but who failed under a
brutal regime and regimen.
The coach and system failed. None of
the athletes who suffered and failed
need to apologize: the apology must
come from those who caused or were
aware of the pain, humiliation and suf
fering and yet did nothing to change the
system.
