# Paradigm of Western thought needs review
## 
### 
Kwame Yao Anku should be com
mended for bringing the need to deal
with the underlying motivations behind
political correctness — rather than
engaging in dogmatic debate over the
limitations of semantics — to the fore
front of public debate. As Anku pointed
out, the real issue that political correct
ness seeks to address is the challenging
of the current paradigm of Western
thought, a paradigm which consistently
excludes the non-white point of view.
However, by conceding that those of
non-white ("non-normal")
descent arc not American, Anku is
allowing himself and others to be
defined by the very Western paradigm
he criticizes. Just because, as Anku

states, Uncle Sam doesn't see a certain
population of people as American, does
not mean that Uncle Sam is right. It
also does not mean that we have to
accept that limited definition. Being
American cannot and should not be
equated with being white, just as being
and considering oneself American does
not assume equality. Yes, being non
white often means being powerless and
disenfranchised, but being non-white
can mean being American as well.
