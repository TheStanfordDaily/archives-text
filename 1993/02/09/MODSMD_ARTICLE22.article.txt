# SURE Escort Service both swift and useful
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the Feb.
3 editorial regarding the SURE Escort
Service. As a resident of the Enchanted

Broccoli Forest, one of the most remote
locations at Stanford, I rely on SURE
when I have to travel throughout cam
pus at night by myself â€” several times
a week, in fact. After giving SURE a
try, I have found it to be an invaluable,
well-organized service to anyone at
Stanford who feels uneasy about trav
eling alone at night.
The Daily calls SURE an "ineffective
service"; on the contrary, I would
argue that it is quite reliable. The cart
usually comes within 10 minutes of my
call and I have never had to wait longer
than 15 minutes nor have I had to put
myself in danger by walking alone at
night. Furthermore, the long waits
only occur on busy nights, which is an
indication that many people are taking
advantage of the service. I don't believe
that students would continue to call
SURE if they were really disappointed.
I think SURE has been underrated.

I greatly appreciate the convenience of
SURE Escort Service, especially its
long hours and daily availability. I am
also grateful to the staff for giving up
their time in the evening when they
could be studying or sleeping. SURE
meets my needs, and I find it very hard
to believe that I am the exception to
the rule.
