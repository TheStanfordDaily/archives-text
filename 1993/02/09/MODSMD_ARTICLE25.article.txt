# John Ford
## Competent, but somnolent 
### 
Boring people don't bother
me. Some people in my classes are
boring — they're normally referred
to as TAs. Some Stanford faculty are bor
ing — they're called econ professors or
Hoover fellows. None of these boring peo
ple at Stanford bother me, though, except
one — Gerhard Casper. And I'll tell you
why.
Last spring, I had the dubious distinc
tion of being the only uninvited guest at
the only speech Casper gave during his
short visit to the Farm. On that fine
spring day — you could almost hear the
birds chirping in the background — I saw
and heard Casper for the first time.
The alumni-laden audience, like so
many "Days Of Our Lives" fans, had
come to escape the harsh reality of life at
Stanford. They came to forget, if only for
an hour or two, the scandals which had
been dogging them too intensely, for too
long: dark tales of impropriety involving
a large sea-faring vessel, satin sheets and
Don Kennedy's quick remarriage.
And, oh my, did that silver-haired
wonder from the University of Chicago
deliver. We all had spring fever, love was
in the air and there was a man named
Gerhard Casper talking about making
Stanford University a better place. It was
almost romantic. But then I thought to
myself. The University of Chicago?
Aren't they a touch conservative? Aren't
they a bit too snug with Robert Bork?

Nonsense, my new friends in the audi
ence answered with their enthusiastic,
nearly delirious applause. He is great,
can't you see? He's uplifting. He's talking
about change. He's not Don Kennedy,
dammit. Applaud the man, if only for
that.
And I must admit, they were right.
This was not Don Kennedy. More impor
tantly, and much more surprisingly, this
Casper person was talking about change.
Severe change.
And he was making a point — nothing
would be taken for granted during his
presidency. He would consider the most
radical ideas, neither rejecting nor
accepting anything out of hand. He men
tioned the possible termination of the
tenure system and drastic changes in
tuition, financial aid and need-blind
admissions. He talked of making gradu
ate students pay for their education.
This man was a rebel, the Andre Agas
si of higher education, and I liked him for
it. Once again, though, I had misgivings.
Maybe radical changes aren't just the
thing for Stanford right now, I thought.
Maybe it would damage our respectabili
ty.
Respectability? My friends in the audi
ence couldn't believe I wasn't embracing
this Germanic Wonder, our Hero from
Hamburg. This guy used to be the dean of
the University of Chicago Law School,
they reminded me. How do you get more

respected than that, they asked. Papacy?
And once again, they were right. So I
joined the crowd. I felt happy. I tried to
sneak out before anyone realized I had
attended sans fancy invite. And I waited.
I waited this fall for Casper to do the
things he had promised he would. I wait
ed for him to solve that circumlocution
problem of his, and to start dressing like
the president of a major university. Noth
ing.
It's all been very boring.
True, Casper's administrative stream
lining and dedication to the library sys
tem have been positive signs. Last spring,
though, Casper gave us a look at a Stan
ford that would re-examine all the tough
issues in higher education, and would
find solutions not in convention, but in
thoughtful problem-solving.
That's what Stanford — and the rest
of this country's universities — needs,
far more than a policy of keeping our
selves off "20/20." Nobody needs that.
It's really boring.
