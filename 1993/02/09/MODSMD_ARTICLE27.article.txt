## Racism, not Ice-T, should be discussed and debated by Daily 
### 
This country was founded
on the things I talked about. Paul
Revere was running around
saying, "The redcoats is coming," so
he was basically saying, "Here come
the pigs, and a fuckup is coming
down."
That was a revolutionary thought,
and those were very honorable thoughts
in those days ... We just celebrated
July Fourth, which is really just
national Fuck the Police Day. And
"The Star-Spangled Banner" is a song
about a hell of a shootout with the
police.
You can call them troops . . . but
basically they're police from the other
side. 1 bet back during the Revolution
ary War, there were songs similar to
mine.
— Ice-T, in a Rolling Stone interview

I haven't beaten anyone this bad in a
long time.
— Loe Angeles police officer Laurence Powell
Once again, The Daily editorial board
has its heart, but not its mind, in the
right place.
In an attempt to drum up support
for such worthy events as the Stan
ford American Indian Organization
panel on Native American issues, they
foolishly denigrated Ice-T. And in the
process, they revealed their ignorance
of the issues surrounding the Ice-T
controversy.
In the Feb. 5 editorial, they asked,
"What insightful contribution can he
make to the censorship debate with
regard to his work?" Here are a few:
First, he could explain that the fear
surrounding the "Body Count" album,

centered around the fact that it was a
rock-metal album, and not a rap album,
as The Daily mistakenly asserted. As
such, the main audience for this album
was young white males, whose yuppie
parents don't want little "Blake" to hear
its anti-cop lyrics.
Second, he might tell us why Time-
Warner defended him, then later
dropped him. Money. Ice-T's albums
were profitable, but not as profitable as
Madonna's, whose work has been just as
controversial as his own.
Third, he might show us how the
media has consistently misportrayed the
song "Cop Killer." The song has a pro
logue called "Out in the Parking Lot,"
in which Ice-T explains exactly what
kind of cop he's talking about killing:
the one who's guilty of police harass
ment and brutality. But you wouldn't

know that from most of the articles
written about the song.
Police organizations and media hacks
predicted that the song would incite its
listeners to violence based on the racist
assumption that a song or a movie is all
it takes to push those "gorillas in the
mist" over the edge.
These groups also attempt to misdi
rect the public. Why are we talking
about a song when we should be talking
about the hundreds of people that police
officers brutalize every year?
Here's the central problem with
The Daily's call for intellectualism: I
don't need a Freudian, Marxist or
legalistic analysis to understand the
cause of police harassment or police
brutality.
And when a cop pulls over either me
or any of my non-white peers for driving

an expensive car in Palo Alto, it's use
less for us to provide the officer with a
Jungian perspective on his behavior.
That wouldn't have helped Rodney King
on the Los Angeles freeway. And it
damn sure wouldn't have saved Malice
Green in Detroit.
We already know what the problem
is. It's racism. Racist police officers who
abuse citizens on a daily basis. Racist
judges whose decisions consistently put
the police above the law. And racist
jurors who believe that the life of a
minority is worthless.
That's why black police organizations
didn't attack Ice-T. They know that
once they step out of uniform, they're
just a bunch of niggers at risk. Like me.
And no amount of Nietzche is going
save me from a cop with an attitude.
