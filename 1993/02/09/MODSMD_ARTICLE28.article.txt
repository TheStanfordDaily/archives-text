# Anti-intellectual Daily hypocritical in evaluation of Ice-T
## 
### 
As Daily staffers, we wholeheartedly
agree with the editorial board's position
last Friday, that Stanford has devel
oped quite an anti-intellectual streak.
But as Daily staffers, we feel The
Daily shouldn't take pot shots at other
students and their efforts to make
Stanford a more exciting and thought
provoking place, without first consider
ing The Daily's role in promoting its
own brand of anti-intellectualism.
Perusing the rest of Friday's Daily
we couldn't help but notice Kenny
Mai's column: "I don't think overly

much about myself. I think even less
about other people."
Columnists should be allowed free
range over expression and content —
that's not the issue.
But if The Daily's accusations of
anti-intellectualism are to be taken
seriously, then we should be working
with our columnists to encourage more
stimulating narratives then those about
how the semiotics of the letter "A"
make it the best grade, and the heart
warming Zen parable of the broken '77
Scout.

And out of Friday's four pages of edi
torial content, one of them was devoted
to such thought-provoking monsters as
"101 Things to Do With CDs" and
whether Chachi or Charles in Charge
makes a better lover.
Two pages were devoted to sports. Not
that sports promotes anti-intellectual
ism, but privileging play-by-play coverage
doesn't position The Daily as a leader in
promoting intellectual discussion.
Although we disagree with some of
the content of Ice-T's songs and some
of the ways he conveys his messages,

we have great respect for his willing
ness to come and debate these issues
with the public in an open forum.
We also feel Friday's remarks sug
gest the edit board hasn't paid much
more attention to him than just the
"Cop Killer" controversy — if they had
ever heard him speak, they would real
ize he's as committed to the hard work
necessary to establish a road to peace as
he is to conveying what he believes is
an accurate expression of legitimate
rage.
All the alternative names the editori

al suggested are admirable choices for
speakers on First Amendment rights,
but the alternative list ignores the fact
that having Ice-T come to campus is, in
part, a celebration of Black Liberation
Month.
And if we're going to run material
chastising everyone for not attending a
Sanford American Indian Organization
panel, then we have no business trying to
pawn Tipper Gore and John Denver off
as somehow relevant to black liberation.
