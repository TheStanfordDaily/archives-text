## Cardinal sluggers to take on University of Pacific No.12 Stanford should handle Tigers despite UOP's recent improvements 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
After playing three close road
games against a tough Cal State-
Fullerton squad, the Cardinal
baseball team returns to Sunken
Diamond today, facing the Uni
versity of the Pacific at 2 p.m.
Despite losing two of the three
weekend contests, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess remained upbeat
on his squad's performance.
"They were three good games,
very well played by both teams,"
the coach said. "Obviously, we
made some mistakes, but all in all,
I'm happy."
The Tigers (4-3 on the season)
should provide the No. 12 Cardi
nal (3-2) with a brief respite before

a home weekend series against
No. 17 Fresno State.
Last year, Stanford handled
Pacific soundly, defeating the
Tigers 6-0 in February and 12-3
later in the season. In the first
game, departed starter Jamie

'While [Pacific] hasn't
been very strong tradi
tionally, they've always
played well against us.'
— coach Mark Marquess

Sepeda and current junior Willie
Adams combined to toss the Car
dinal's first no-hitter in 11 years.
In the second matchup, Stanford
pounded out 17 hits, its second
highest total of the season.
Marquess, however, refused to
downplay today's game. "Every
game is important to us," he said.
"While (Pacific) hasn't been very
strong traditionally, they've
always played well against us."
Indeed, Pacific has already
shown signs of improvement this
season. On Feb. 2, the Tigers post
ed a 6-3 victory over California, a
College World Series participant
last season. In addition, Pacific
took two out of three from a solid
San Diego State squad at home
last weekend.
On the mound, the Tigers will
start Mike Rios, a junior-college
transfer who picked up the win for
Pacific in the Cal game. Rios, a
righthander, is a power pitcher
who has had control problems
early in the season, striking out
five men while walking seven in 11
innings of work.
Three-year veterans Eddie
Mylett and Chip Sell have provid
ed the brunt of the punch for

e thus far. The speedy out
fielders have combined for six
stolen bases and a .523 on-base
percentage on the young season.
With Rios, a righthander, on the
mound, switch-hitter Cale Carter
and lefty Steve Carver should see
action for Stanford at center field
and designated hitter, respectively.

The game will give Marquess
the opportunity to manipulate his
lineup at other positions as well.
Left fielder Nate Olmstead
sprained his ankle while running
out a grounder in Sunday's game,
and is unlikely to play today. With
three outfielders — Rod Meyer,
Rich Crowe and Brodie Van Wag

nen — vying for time in right field,
Olmstead's injury should provide
the trio with increased playing
time.
"Everyone who I've played [in
right field) has done a good job,"
Marquess said. "It's a problem,
but it's the kind of problem that I
like to have."

The coach also indicated that
he would juggle his pitching rota
tion and use as many as four
hurlers in today's game.
"It all depends upon arm weari
ness," Marquess said, indicating
that Adams and sophomore Matt
Marenghi, who both saw action on
Friday, are likely to pitch.
