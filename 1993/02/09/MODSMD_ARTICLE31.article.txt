# Columnist hails hometown hero, Cardinal football recruit
## There is more to Tim Carey than the one-line statistics found in media releases 
### 
You have probably already heard of
Tim Carey. Maybe you've heard
how he is a consensus Al) -American
quarterback out of Southern California,
or how some obscure scout or magazine
puts him among the top five prospects in
the nation at his position. Maybe you
only saw his name listed third alphabeti
cally among the Cardinal's star-studded
1993 football recruiting class, checked
that his height and weight sounded like
they belonged on a football roster and let
your eyes wander down the rest of the
page.
However, what gets lost in the clamor
over Bill Walsh's new perch atop college
football's power structure and conve
nient summaries like "Tim Carey, QB, 6-
4, 180, 2/20/75, Seal Beach, CA (Los
Alamitos)" are the stories behind the
first members of Stanford's Class of
1997. We usually know that these wun
derkind excelled throughout their prep
careers, but we don't know how they did
it, let alone what they are like as people,
not just lofty statistics.
I am privileged to be from Seal Beach
and Los Alamitos High School, and to

have watched and covered Tim Carey as
he rewrote the record books of my alma
mater, adding yet another Division I col
lege football prospect to the annals of our
program's history (Hartwell Brown, a
linebacker here at Stanford, is one of four
such prospects with whom I graduated in
1990).
I stood on the sidelines as Carey, a
junior in his first year on the varsity
squad, played mistake-free football in a
defensive battle that gave our school its
first championship in any men's sport in
its 25-year history. I called home every
game night last fall to find out not if Los
Al's top-ranked team had won, but by
how many points and how many Carey

yards and touchdown passes. I didn't so
much as gasp when the final totals read
13-0-1 and a second-consecutive champi
onship for the team and a cool 3,397
yards and 35 touchdowns for Carey, Cal
ifornia's Player of the Year and the
state's leading passer.
High school football is big time in
Orange County, and Carey single-hand
edly made it even bigger in 1991 and '92,
as his 399-of-682 passing, 5,889 yards
and 60 touchdowns became the dotted
line on which he could sign his name to a
letter of intent for any college in the
nation.
Yet before his senior season even
began, Carey knew that he didn't want to
go to "any college in the nation." He
wanted to take his respectable grade
point average, his outstanding SAT score
and his classic California surfer good
looks to Stanford, the best school in the
state. Other schools called (one even
threatened to do so at midnight of July 1,
the beginning of the summer contact
period) and Carey listened, but only to
make sure he had made the right deci
sion. His weekly talks with Scott Schuh

mann — then Stanford's offensive line
coach and now the team's recruiting
coordinator — became reassurance that
his good feelings about the Cardinal were
mutual.
"Coach Walsh was part of the reason,
but I was attracted by the school itself,"
Carey said when I spoke with him yester
day."I liked the new offense, but I also
liked the location and thought the cam
pus was really nice."
When his on-the-field success contin
ued into the first few games of last sea
son, Carey received a call from Walsh,
whom he had seen at California's Quar
terback Camp in June and before the
Disneyland Pigskin Classic in August.
Now, Walsh was offering him the schol
arship of his dreams, and he couldn't
refuse.
"When Stanford made its hard pitch in
October, it was all over," said Los Alami
tos coach John Barnes.
"I think he called all of the other
schools himself to tell them he was going
to Stanford," said Tim Carey, Sr., Tim's
father.
Carey followed up his verbal commit

ment with a visit to the campus, where he
was hosted by the Cardinal's incumbent
quarterback, Steve Stenstrom. Sten
strom, who hails from county-rival El
Toro High School, reminded Carey of the
advantage he will have against Pacific 10
Conference opponents in coming from
Southern California.
"There is better competition down
there, and I've played against better ath
letes (than recruits from other areas),
including other All-Americans," Carey
said.
Walsh visited Los Alamitos a few
weeks before Feb. 3's National Letter of
Intent Day, and the brilliant torch that is
Tim Carey's young career was effectively
passed from one coach to another.
"I was overwhelmed by his charisma
and his presence," Barnes said. "I have a
quarterback who is going to play for Bill
Walsh at Stanford, which means he must
be the first or second-best guy in the
nation. Nothing can beat that."

"Andy Eiser, DSE*, 5-9, 140, 4/5/72, Seal
Beach, CA (Los Alamitos)" admits to
being a homer. Go Griffins!

You have probably already heard of
Tim Carey. Maybe you've heard
how he is a consensus Al) -American
quarterback out of Southern California,
or how some obscure scout or magazine
puts him among the top five prospects in
the nation at his position. Maybe you
only saw his name listed third alphabeti
cally among the Cardinal's star-studded
1993 football recruiting class, checked
that his height and weight sounded like
they belonged on a football roster and let
your eyes wander down the rest of the
page.
However, what gets lost in the clamor
over Bill Walsh's new perch atop college
football's power structure and conve
nient summaries like "Tim Carey, QB, 6-
4, 180, 2/20/75, Seal Beach, CA (Los
Alamitos)" are the stories behind the
first members of Stanford's Class of
1997. We usually know that these wun
derkind excelled throughout their prep
careers, but we don't know how they did
it, let alone what they are like as people,
not just lofty statistics.
I am privileged to be from Seal Beach
and Los Alamitos High School, and to

have watched and covered Tim Carey as
he rewrote the record books of my alma
mater, adding yet another Division I col
lege football prospect to the annals of our
program's history (Hartwell Brown, a
linebacker here at Stanford, is one of four
such prospects with whom I graduated in
1990).
I stood on the sidelines as Carey, a
junior in his first year on the varsity
squad, played mistake-free football in a
defensive battle that gave our school its
first championship in any men's sport in
its 25-year history. I called home every
game night last fall to find out not if Los
Al's top-ranked team had won, but by
how many points and how many Carey

yards and touchdown passes. I didn't so
much as gasp when the final totals read
13-0-1 and a second-consecutive champi
onship for the team and a cool 3,397
yards and 35 touchdowns for Carey, Cal
ifornia's Player of the Year and the
state's leading passer.
High school football is big time in
Orange County, and Carey single-hand
edly made it even bigger in 1991 and '92,
as his 399-of-682 passing, 5,889 yards
and 60 touchdowns became the dotted
line on which he could sign his name to a
letter of intent for any college in the
nation.
Yet before his senior season even
began, Carey knew that he didn't want to
go to "any college in the nation." He
wanted to take his respectable grade
point average, his outstanding SAT score
and his classic California surfer good
looks to Stanford, the best school in the
state. Other schools called (one even
threatened to do so at midnight of July 1,
the beginning of the summer contact
period) and Carey listened, but only to
make sure he had made the right deci
sion. His weekly talks with Scott Schuh

mann — then Stanford's offensive line
coach and now the team's recruiting
coordinator — became reassurance that
his good feelings about the Cardinal were
mutual.
"Coach Walsh was part of the reason,
but I was attracted by the school itself,"
Carey said when I spoke with him yester
day."I liked the new offense, but I also
liked the location and thought the cam
pus was really nice."
When his on-the-field success contin
ued into the first few games of last sea
son, Carey received a call from Walsh,
whom he had seen at California's Quar
terback Camp in June and before the
Disneyland Pigskin Classic in August.
Now, Walsh was offering him the schol
arship of his dreams, and he couldn't
refuse.
"When Stanford made its hard pitch in
October, it was all over," said Los Alami
tos coach John Barnes.
"I think he called all of the other
schools himself to tell them he was going
to Stanford," said Tim Carey, Sr., Tim's
father.
Carey followed up his verbal commit

ment with a visit to the campus, where he
was hosted by the Cardinal's incumbent
quarterback, Steve Stenstrom. Sten
strom, who hails from county-rival El
Toro High School, reminded Carey of the
advantage he will have against Pacific 10
Conference opponents in coming from
Southern California.
"There is better competition down
there, and I've played against better ath
letes (than recruits from other areas),
including other All-Americans," Carey
said.
Walsh visited Los Alamitos a few
weeks before Feb. 3's National Letter of
Intent Day, and the brilliant torch that is
Tim Carey's young career was effectively
passed from one coach to another.
"I was overwhelmed by his charisma
and his presence," Barnes said. "I have a
quarterback who is going to play for Bill
Walsh at Stanford, which means he must
be the first or second-best guy in the
nation. Nothing can beat that."

"Andy Eiser, DSE*, 5-9, 140, 4/5/72, Seal
Beach, CA (Los Alamitos)" admits to
being a homer. Go Griffins!
