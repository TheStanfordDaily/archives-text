Outstanding performances that deserve
special recognition were turned in by two
Stanford athletes over the weekend.
Heather Willens bagged her first collegiate
Grand Slam tennis title at the Rolex Nation
al Indoor Championships, while Michael
Covert earned his first dual meet wins and
set a season record in the 1000-yard
freestyle.

Willens recovered from a 0-3 deficit and
saved four set points in the second set of the
Rolex tourney to clinch the title. She defeat
ed her teammate, redshirt freshman Kim
Shasby, by a score of 6-4, 7-5.
Willens battled her way through Indi
ana's Deborah Edelman (6-4, 6-4), North
Carolina's Cinda Gurney (5-7, 6-2, 6-4),
Drake's Vera Vitels (2-6, 6-0, 6-2) and
Duke's Julie Exum (6-4, 6-1) en route to the
All-Cardinal final.
The Stanford senior entered the tourna
ment unseeded and ranked No. 14 by the
ITA.
Her win over No. 4 seed Gurney was
impressive, and her win over Exum — who
was seeded No. 2 and enjoys a No. 2 ITA
ranking — was a major upset.
For Willens, however, the victory meant
more than a lift to her rating on paper. "I
was having a bad fall, and [this win] gets me
back on track going into team competition,"
she said. "It gives me a confidence boost."

Covert started his weekend with a season
best swim in the 1000 freestyle against USC.
His time of 9 minutes, 12.07 seconds was 14
seconds faster than the previous mark, held
by classmate Joe Hudepohl, and earned him
a second-place finish.
The Miami, Fla. native then turned up
the heat against UCLA on Saturday to gain
his first two dual meet victories. He won the
1000 free with a time of 9:24.62, and com

peted in the very next event, the 200 free.
Showing no signs of fatigue, he finished sec
ond behind teammate Eric Diehl.
He rounded out his stellar performance
with a win in the 500 free in the third-fastest
time of the season (4:28.31).
Covert's swims served notice that the
freshman is back in form following a patella
dislocation he suffered in the fall.
