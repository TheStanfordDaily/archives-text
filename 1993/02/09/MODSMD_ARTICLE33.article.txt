# Cal coach canned
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
UC-Berkeley fired men's bas
ketball head coach Lou Campan
elli last night midway through
the Pacific 10 Conference sea
son, citing dissatisfaction with
his performance this year.
Campanelli, 54, who achieved
the biggest coup of the recruiting
season last year by signing Jason
Kidd — the nation's top-rated
prep player — guided the Golden
Bears to a 10-7 overall mark this
season, with a 4-5 record in the
Pac-10.
Although loaded with talent,
the young Cal team has been
erratic, and despite high presea
son expectations is currently tied
for sixth place in the Pac-10 with
UCLA.
"We're making the change
because I wasn't happy with the
direction of the basketball pro
gram," said California Athletic
Director Bob Bockrath.
Several players on the Cal
squad were not pleased with the
team's direction under Campan
elli either.
The eighth-year coach,
whose past two recruiting class
es ranked in the top 10 nation
ally, was allegedly fired in
response to a player revolt at
Berkeley, as many threatened

to transfer unless a new coach
was named.
"I'm shocked, surprised, and
stunned," said Stanford basket
ball coach Mike Montgomery,
whose team will face Cal on Sun
day.
I'm very surprised that a
school such as Cal would make a
decision such as this in the mid
dle of the season. It doesn't seem
appropriate."
The decision came on the
heels of three straight losses by
Campanelli's squad, including a
93-81 setback to No. 8 Arizona
two days ago. Montgomery
emphasized that this decision
illustrates the "win-at-all-costs"
mentality that is pervading col
lege sports.
"They're coming off a tough
weekend at Arizona, but that's a
weekend which will be tough for
everyone," Montgomery said.
"This is not a positive statement
for college athletics."
Cal third-year assistant coach
Todd Bozeman, 29, who is in
charge of recruiting, was named
interim coach for the rest of the
season.
Campanelli will hold a press
conference today to present his
side of the story.
