## Myth debunked: Roomie's death won't give you a 4.0 
### Joel Stein Staff writer 
You were all wrong.
If your roommate commits suicide, if
he's hit by a bus, or if you just happen to
add a little too much rat poison to his
late-night pizza, you're not getting a 4.0
grade-point average.
Although it has long been rumored
that the University awards straight A's
to students whose roommates die in the
middle of a quarter, such a policy has
never existed.
"It's completely off the wall," said act
ing registrar Jack Farrell. "Each grade is
up to each individual professor. Profes
sors care enough about the integrity of
the grades that I can't imagine a profes
sor would say, 'Oh, your roommate killed
themself? Here's an A.' "
Diana Conklin, associate director of
Residential Education, said it is one of
the more ridiculous myths she has en
countered.

"It's ridiculous on the face of it. If you
give an A if your roommate dies, what do
you give a student if your roommate is
very badly injured — a B?"
The majority of students, however,
seem to believe the University does offer
compensation for the emotional trauma
of such a tragedy.
Emile Bruneau, a resident assistant at
Branner Hall, said he was not informed
about the University's policy during RA
training. "I've just heard a rumor that
it's true. I think that's the way it has to
be. If your roommate dies, you're obvi
ously traumatized by the experience and
they have to assume you'd get straight
A's. They couldn't assume that you'd get
straight B's."
Other students arrived at the same
conclusion through a combination of in
formation from other students and their
own brand of circumlocution.
"It's their liability because they put
the both of you together. And
they have to assume you would
have gotten straight A's if you
weren't grieving for your dead
roommate," said Josh Simmons, a
freshman.
Freshman Julie Markley firm
ly believed the University would
give the grieving roommate
straight A's, although with stipu
lations. "I've heard you get
straight A's if your roommate
kills themself. Not if you kill
them, though."
Many students said they
believed that, although the Uni
versity might not deliver straight
A's, they would make other
adjustments, such as giving a
"pass" to classes which were
taken pass/no credit, and "freez
ing grades wherever they were at
the time" of the tragedy.
Even some students who did
not think the University gave any
special treatment to surviving
roommates believed other highly
competitive schools — Cornell in
particular — have this policy.

They, too, were wrong.
"We would bend over back
wards to accommodate students,
to accommodate their grief and
emotional distress," said Ron
Loomis, acting registrar at Cor
nell University. "If it were to hap
pen in that situation, what would
happen to a student whose parent
had died or whose spouse had
died?"
Loomis thought the rumor
that Cornell in particular held
this policy was due to the belief
that Cornell has the highest sui
cide rate of any school in the
nation — an idea, he said, which
is entirely unsubstantiated.
"The reason for that myth is
that Cornell is located in a beauti
ful natural setting. .. . Occasion
ally someone commits suicide by
jumping off a bridge into a gorge
— but that is very rare. The sui
cide rate of students in Cornell is
below the national average for
colleges."
Archie Epps, the dean of stu
dents at Harvard, said Harvard
would never compensate for the
trauma of a dead roommate with
improved academic ratings.
"We don't. Those would be two
separate things," he said.
