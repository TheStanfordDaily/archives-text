# Absent without leave
## ASSU attendance low; 7 senators suspended 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The Council of Presidents is not the only
part of the ASSU that has been missing in
action this year.
On average, about one-third of the 40
ASSU senators have been skipping their bi
weekly meetings — including last week's
address by University President Gerhard
Casper, traditionally one of the largest
draws of the quarter.
Only 26 senators showed up for Casper's
speech last week, and for the two previous
meetings this quarter, 18 were absent.
ASSU Senate Chair Ron Brown said there
is no "very good way of enforcing attendance."
"The senate is able to operate as long as
10 representative members are present," he
said. The votes of absent senators are sim
ply reassigned to other representatives at a
given meeting.
"But the students who elect the (absent)
senators may be left out of the process,"
Brown said.
The 10 undergraduate voting senators
have generally been in attendance, with only
five total absences in the senate's first 12 ses
sions. But nine of the 10 non-voting under
graduate senators have missed at least one
meeting, and six have shirked three or more.
Attendance among graduate senators

has been similarly inconsistent. Ten of the
14 senators from the Engineering and Hu
manities and Sciences schools have missed
one or more gatherings. All but two of the 10
voting members have tallied an absence.
Poor attendance led Brown to "suspend
indefinitely" seven senators last quarter —
five of them from the Law School. These
senators are barred from participating un
less they appeal their suspension, which
none have done, Brown said.
"Attendance is important for senators to
be effective, in terms of being knowledge
able about bills," Brown said. "Senators will
be judged by the people who elect them.
There is no greater incentive than the desire
to do the job well."
Of the suspended senators, only one is an
undergraduate. Rafe Sagarin ran last spring
on the promise that he would not attend any
senate meetings. Sagarin was the fourth
highest undergraduate vote-getter and so
far has been true to his campaign pledge.
Robin Ghio, one of the suspended Law
School senators, said he did not attend meet
ings because "my heart was never really in
it. Frankly I figured there was no reason for
me to go to meetings and listen to something
horribly boring if I couldn't vote."
He added that he did not originally intend
to run for the senate but was
"solicited" by outgoing senators to
do so. He entered the election on
the day of the deadline to
announce candidacy.
Ghio surmised that such a sen
timent of apathy about the ASSU
is prevalent throughout the Law
School. "No one is terribly inter
ested in the first place," he said.
"A lot of the undergraduates in
the senate want to play govern
ment," Ghio said. "The problem
is that a lot of people in graduate
school have already been in the
real world."
Unless "you have someone
who's really fanatical," there is
simply not enough interest among
law students to expect regular

attendance in the senate, he added.
Sagarin and the other suspend
ed senators — law students
Leonard Lopez, Brian Keys, Jaime
Fernandez and Colin Hampson,
and political science graduate stu
dent Amy Zegart — could not be
reached for comment.
Only Keys has been present at
a meeting since the 23rd Senate
convened last May.
In November, the senate
passed a bill that sought to make
students more aware of its actions
by publicizing each week's agen
da, upcoming debates and phone
numbers of senators. In addition,
the voting and attendance records
of the senate will be made public
before the elections in April.
"Hopefully, these ads have led
students to get in touch with sen
ators," Brown said. "Students
have got in contact with me since
the bill was passed."
