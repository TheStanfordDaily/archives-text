## Stanford experts say Clinton erred in Kimba Wood fiasco

From talk shows to newspapers, the
Clinton administration's second failed at
tempt to appoint a female attorney general
has generated talk about possible biases and
double standards in the selection process.
After last weekend's withdrawal of feder
al judge Kimba Wood, some have wondered
whether a male have been subjected to the
same kind of questions Wood and Zoe Baird
were.
At Stanford, many professors could only
agree on one point: the Clinton administra
tion made the wrong decision in Wood's
case, in which the nominee admitted to hir
ing an illegal alien at a time when there were
no laws against doing so.
Baird, Clinton's first pick for the post,
withdrew after it was discovered she had
hired illegal aliens to care for her child after
laws against such hirings were passed.
"The Clinton administration made a se

keeping arrangements of men in the cabi
net? Not much."
Though she thought Wood's disclosure
should have come earlier, Rhode said she
felt that Wood was "being held to a standard
not employed for men."
Such double standards also worry Law
Prof. Barbara Babcock, who was considered
a possible nominee several weeks ago.
"Once the (attorney general) position be
came open to women," Babcock said, "there
was another whole set of requirements."
Until the Baird and Wood cases, nomi
nees have never been "looked at ever before
in terms of public integrity," she said.
Political Science Prof. Myra Strober
thought this was particularly true consider
ing the negative reaction to the fact that
Wood had trained to work at a Playboy club
nearly 20 years ago.
"If you count the men in the cabinet who
have gone to Playboy clubs or to raunchy
