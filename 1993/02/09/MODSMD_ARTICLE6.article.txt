# A 						double standard?
## Stanford experts say Clinton erred in Kimba Wood fiasco 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
From talk shows to newspapers, the
Clinton administration's second failed at
tempt to appoint a female attorney general
has generated talk about possible biases and
double standards in the selection process.
After last weekend's withdrawal of feder
al judge Kimba Wood, some have wondered
whether a male have been subjected to the
same kind of questions Wood and Zoe Baird
were.
At Stanford, many professors could only
agree on one point: the Clinton administra
tion made the wrong decision in Wood's
case, in which the nominee admitted to hir
ing an illegal alien at a time when there were
no laws against doing so.
Baird, Clinton's first pick for the post,
withdrew after it was discovered she had
hired illegal aliens to care for her child after
laws against such hirings were passed.
"The Clinton administration made a se
vere mistake when it did not distinguish be
tween breaking the law and not breaking
the law," said Hoover Institution Senior
Fellow John Cogan, who has worked in both
the U.S. Department of Labor and the the
Office of Management and Budget.
But on the gender question, some main
tained there is a bias against women, while
others said the Clinton administration sim
ply reacted in fear of negative public opinion.
"There is a definite double standard,

The administration sort
of panicked, it got
concerned it'd get beat up
on some talk show.'

that's clear," said Law Prof. Deborah
Rhode. "What do we know about the house
keeping arrangements of men in the cabi
net? Not much."
Though she thought Wood's disclosure
should have come earlier, Rhode said she
felt that Wood was "being held to a standard
not employed for men."
Such double standards also worry Law
Prof. Barbara Babcock, who was considered
a possible nominee several weeks ago.
"Once the (attorney general) position be
came open to women," Babcock said, "there
was another whole set of requirements."
Until the Baird and Wood cases, nomi
nees have never been "looked at ever before
in terms of public integrity," she said.
Political Science Prof. Myra Strober
thought this was particularly true consider
ing the negative reaction to the fact that
Wood had trained to work at a Playboy club
nearly 20 years ago.
"If you count the men in the cabinet who
have gone to Playboy clubs or to raunchy
frat parties or done the male
equivalent of what Kimba Woods
did, you would have a very large
number indeed," she said.
While other professors did not
rule out bias as a possibility, they
gave more weight to the Clinton
administration's fears about pub
lic opinion.
"Clinton kind of wimped out,"
said Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody, who has studied
public opinion. "Kimba Wood is in
a different situation (from
Baird's). The administration sort
of panicked. It got concerned it'd
get beat up on some talk show."
Citing John Tower's failed bid
for the secretary of defense posi
tion in 1989 because of his alcohol
problems, Brody said people were
not interested in Wood's personal
life only because she is a woman.
"With almost any major cabi
net appointment, there's great
public interest when there's some
kind of trouble, especially when
it's personal trouble," Cogan said.
"That always makes big news."
Both Brody and Cogan agreed
that public opinion was the main
factor in Wood's withdrawal. Bias
was less of an issue, they said,
because Baird's confirmation pro
cess had already put the question

of child-care arrangements on
everybody's minds.
"If Kimba Wood had been, say,
Zachary Wood, the same thing
would have happened," Cogan
said.
However, Babcock said she
"was not sure that they would
have given up on a man like they
did on Kimba Woods."
If a male nominee were in
Wood's situation, Babcock said,
the administration would've
stuck with him and just said,
"That's fine, that's great —
that'll get us by."
She said she hoped this second
failure to find a woman for the
position would not result in Clin
ton turning away from women as
viable choices.
"It would be a terrible message
sent to women, especially to
women in the legal profession .. .
if the Clinton administration
were to say 'We tried these two
and they didn't work,' " Babcock
said.
But Cogan said the two failed
appointments are actually likely
to push Clinton toward selecting
another woman.
"I think if he says 'Forget the
women for attorney general,' he's
going to hear it loud and clear
from the women's groups that
there really is a double standard,"
Cogan said. "He's still should be
very much interested in having a
woman for attorney general."

Citing John Tower's failed bid
for the secretary of defense posi
tion in 1989 because of his alcohol
problems, Brody said people were
not interested in Wood's personal
life only because she is a woman.
"With almost any major cabi
net appointment, there's great
public interest when there's some
kind of trouble, especially when
it's personal trouble," Cogan said.
"That always makes big news."
Both Brody and Cogan agreed
that public opinion was the main
factor in Wood's withdrawal. Bias
was less of an issue, they said,
because Baird's confirmation pro
cess had already put the question

of child-care arrangements on
everybody's minds.
"If Kimba Wood had been, say,
Zachary Wood, the same thing
would have happened," Cogan
said.
However, Babcock said she
"was not sure that they would
have given up on a man like they
did on Kimba Woods."
If a male nominee were in
Wood's situation, Babcock said,
the administration would've
stuck with him and just said,
"That's fine, that's great —
that'll get us by."
She said she hoped this second
failure to find a woman for the
position would not result in Clin
ton turning away from women as
viable choices.
"It would be a terrible message
sent to women, especially to
women in the legal profession .. .
if the Clinton administration
were to say 'We tried these two
and they didn't work,' " Babcock
said.
But Cogan said the two failed
appointments are actually likely
to push Clinton toward selecting
another woman.
"I think if he says 'Forget the
women for attorney general,' he's
going to hear it loud and clear
from the women's groups that
there really is a double standard,"
Cogan said. "He's still should be
very much interested in having a
woman for attorney general."
