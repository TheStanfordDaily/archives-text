# Deejay got her start in South Korea

The first time Sonya Crawford dee
jayed at a South Korean radio station,
the show's producer thought she'd be a
one-broadcast novelty the listeners
would laugh at.
Instead, that broadcast launched a ca
reer.
Crawford, a senior majoring in com
munication and political science, has en
joyed a series of jobs in Korean television
and radio networks since that first show
at age 15. Now she puts her talents to
work behind the scenes at KZSU as the
station's news director.
She credits her half Korean, half
American background for her Korean
broadcasting experience. In that coun
try, people consider it a novelty to listen
to someone who is not fully Korean at
tempt to speak the language because
they spend so much time trying to learn
English, she explained.
Because Crawford had lived in South
Korea since birth and speaks the lan
guage fluently, she was able to be more
than just a funny foreigner on the radio
trying to speak Korean.
After her first radio show, Crawford
said the producer told her "he'd be in
touch — like you ever believe that stuff."

A few months later
he kept his word
and offered her a po
sition doing a live
television show de
signed to help pre
pare the Korean
people for the Seoul
Olympics.
"I said no. I
didn't want to wake
up that early or miss
school," she said. "I
just didn't under
stand the appeal —
but my mom was ec
static."
She ended up ac
cepting the job and
did her first live
television broad
cast on her six
teenth birthday.
Crawford called her
first show a "disas-

ter," but added that she was "hooked" on
the pressure and excitement of live
broadcasting.
"There's definitely a sense of excite
ment. You're a person at an event, but not
just as an observer," she said. "You're
doing a job. There's a real sense of accom
plishment."

During the show, Crawford was sup
posed to do man-on-the-street inter
views, teaching the Korean citizens
terms concerning the Olympics, but her
first broadcast was marred by rain which
left few people on the streets.
