# Deejay got her start in South Korea

### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
The first time Sonya Crawford dee
jayed at a South Korean radio station,
the show's producer thought she'd be a
one-broadcast novelty the listeners
would laugh at.
Instead, that broadcast launched a ca
reer.
Crawford, a senior majoring in com
munication and political science, has en
joyed a series of jobs in Korean television
and radio networks since that first show
at age 15. Now she puts her talents to
work behind the scenes at KZSU as the
station's news director.
She credits her half Korean, half
American background for her Korean
broadcasting experience. In that coun
try, people consider it a novelty to listen
to someone who is not fully Korean at
tempt to speak the language because
they spend so much time trying to learn
English, she explained.
Because Crawford had lived in South
Korea since birth and speaks the lan
guage fluently, she was able to be more
than just a funny foreigner on the radio
trying to speak Korean.
After her first radio show, Crawford
said the producer told her "he'd be in
touch — like you ever believe that stuff."

A few months later
he kept his word
and offered her a po
sition doing a live
television show de
signed to help pre
pare the Korean
people for the Seoul
Olympics.
"I said no. I
didn't want to wake
up that early or miss
school," she said. "I
just didn't under
stand the appeal —
but my mom was ec
static."
She ended up ac
cepting the job and
did her first live
television broad
cast on her six
teenth birthday.
Crawford called her
first show a "disas-

ter," but added that she was "hooked" on
the pressure and excitement of live
broadcasting.
"There's definitely a sense of excite
ment. You're a person at an event, but not
just as an observer," she said. "You're
doing a job. There's a real sense of accom
plishment."

During the show, Crawford was sup
posed to do man-on-the-street inter
views, teaching the Korean citizens
terms concerning the Olympics, but her
first broadcast was marred by rain which
left few people on the streets.

Senior Sonya Crawford, who first went on the air at age 15 in
Korea is KZSU's news director.
Whatever the drawbacks, her
job gave Crawford what most 16-
year-olds only dream of — a new
wardrobe.
Her mother took her shopping
for new clothes to help her look
older, Crawford explained with a
chuckle, because the producers
thought the Korean people would
not accept advice from a high
school student.
While she was hosting the tele
vision show, Crawford was also
involved with radio, deejaying a
show called "Sunday with Sonya"
where she would translate Ameri
can music lyrics into Korean so
listeners could better understand
their favorite hits.
The work in broadcasting also
led to other job offers in modeling
and acting for the high school stu
dent.
"I even did a sketch on a come
dy show like Saturday Night Live,
but I didn't like it because I start
ed to be known as a comedian
rather than a reporter," she said.
Crawford's career in Korean
broadcasting did not end with her
migration to Stanford. She said she
has returned home to some free
lance reporting jobs and the chance
to broadcast from Barcelona dur
ing the summer Olympics.
And not all of her experience
has been in serious broadcasting.
After Barcelona, Crawford came
back to California for an intern
ship with the Fox network work
ing on a local Los Angeles televi
sion show called "Busted."
"Busted," which was created by

the same people who came up with
"Studs," was, she said, a version of
"The Newlywed Game" using best
friends in place of couples.
Crawford said her work at
KZSU has taught her what it's
like to be behind the scenes of a
broadcast. "I've come to enjoy
that because of the freedom it
gives you. You really don't get
that kind of freedom when you're
in front of the camera," she said.
But after graduation this June,
Crawford said she wants to
remain in the United States and

find a job in broadcast journalism.
However, she has not made a
choice between radio and televi
sion, nor between reporting and
working behind the scenes.
"There's a strong part of me
that wants to be behind the
scenes making some of the deci
sions. But there's part of me that
loves being on the air," she said.
"What I like about broadcast is
your personality can really shine
through. People tell me I'm much
better live than recorded. Some
thing about my voice or manner

changes when I'm live," she
added. "It's a very high-pressure
situation. And to get beyond the
pressure and come out with a fin
ished project that you enjoy and
others enjoy is nice."
But right now Crawford said
she would take any job. "As far as
anyone knows there are no posi
tions open in broadcasting until
you push for one or know some
one," she said. "In the beginning,
when you go on you have no
choice. You go in as a mailroom
woman or a gofer."
