Hey Sports Writers!
New and Old!
1 /
We're talking to YOU!
(these notices usually aren't
directed at you, so take note)
Friday at noon, there's a real real
important meeting at The Daily.
Come find out about the Sports Department
this volume, meet Amy (the new editor)
and get to know your fellow penners
(is that sports lingo for writers?)
Who knows, there may even be food.
