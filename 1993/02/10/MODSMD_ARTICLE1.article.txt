Three Hoover Institution fel
lows and two Stanford professors
were named yesterday to Califor

state at a time when defense

short-term budget woes may be a
boon in the long term, if they shift
to a new kind of production.
Lau said he thought the council
was created "basically to listen to
different ideas and different per
spectives" on California's eco

"Hopefully, there will be some
ideas that work," he added.
Friedman agreed that Califor

industries creates some unique
