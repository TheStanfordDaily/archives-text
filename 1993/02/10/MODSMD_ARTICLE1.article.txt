### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Three Hoover Institution fel
lows and two Stanford professors
were named yesterday to Califor
nia's Council of Economic Advisors.
The group, which is chaired by
Distinguished Hoover Fellow and
former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz, was created in
January by Gov. Pete Wilson to
investigate solutions for the
state's fiscal woes.
Among the 15 founding pan
elists Shultz and Wilson an
nounced yesterday are Senior
Hoover Fellows Martin Anderson,
Milton Friedman and Gary Beck
er, Stanford economist Michael
Boskin and Economics Prof.
Lawrence Lau. Friedman and
Becker have each won the Nobel
Prize in Economics.
Lau said yesterday he hopes to
help the California economy, but
admitted that "the state is in some
serious fiscal trouble."
While Lau said he needs to fur
ther study the state's economy, he
said California has some prominent
economic problems to investigate.
For example, he said, state expendi
tures are rising much faster than
receipts, creating a budget crisis.
In addition, Lau said, Califor
nia's "employment outlook is
rather bleak," partly because of
the large number of high-technol
ogy and military industries in the
state at a time when defense
spending is falling. But, he said,
those same industries creating
short-term budget woes may be a
boon in the long term, if they shift
to a new kind of production.
Lau said he thought the council
was created "basically to listen to
different ideas and different per
spectives" on California's eco
nomic issues.
"Hopefully, there will be some
ideas that work," he added.
Friedman agreed that Califor
nia's great dependence on defense
industries creates some unique
problems, but said that was not
the root of all the state's prob
lems.
"Fundamentally, the problems
of California are the same as
every state . . . spend! ingl too
much" and getting too little for it,
he said.
But all the economists inter
viewed admitted that the Golden
State's financial muddle is com
plex and will require a lot of
homework.
"I'll learn a bit more about the
economy as soon as I get
involved" in the council, said

Becker, who declined to comment
on California's fiscal problems
until after the council had met.
Friedman, too, said he needed
to learn more about the specifics
of California's economy.
"Right now, I'm as innocent as
a new-born babe," he said.
In announcing the council
appointments this morning,
Shultz said he expected the body
to meet three or four times a year
to give Wilson "unvarnished
advice" on fiscal matters. He
called the new appointees, all of
whom are volunteering their
time, "a group of idea people."
Wilson said the first issues he
would like the group to study are
the effects that restrictive nation
al credit policies and a possible

federal gas tax increase could
have on California as well as how
the state's rapid population
growth interacts with the econo
my.
In addition to the appointees
from Stanford, four professors
from other California colleges
were appointed to the board.
Business leaders — such as
BankAmerica Corp. Chairman
Dick Rosenberg — and former
U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills round out the council.
Many of the Stanford
economists have had experience
in government before. Both
Anderson and Friedman served as
advisers to Presidents Nixon and
Reagan, and Boskin served in the
Bush administration.
