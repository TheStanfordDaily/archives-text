PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
The army-backed government agreed
yesterday to allow international human
rights monitors in the violence-wracked
nation in return for concessions on the
team's power and autonomy.
The United States praised the accord
as a step toward restoring democracy.
The office of Prime Minister Marc
Bazin called the monitors' mission "only
the first step toward the normalization
and democratization of political life."
Haitians complaining of repression

and violence have fled the country by
the thousands since a September 1991
coup toppled Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the country's first democratically elect
ed president. But the United States has
refused entry to most of them, shipping
them back to Haiti.
The key question stemming from the
pact is whether the government will
cooperate with the monitors and allow
them to move freely.
Sixteen observers from the Organiza
tion of American States have been in

Haiti for months, but their movements
have been restricted by the military.
About 40 OAS monitors — 15 of
them from the United States — will
travel to Haiti within four days, said
Richard Boucher, the State Department
spokesman.
Caputo said the monitors would stay
in Haiti for at least a year, but the
Haitian announcement did not give a
period for their stay, nor did it say how
many would take part or what their
powers would be.
