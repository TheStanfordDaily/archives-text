## A 						housing dilemma 
### 
Problems in Alpha Sig
initiation rites stir up
character conflicts

AH, UNIVERSITY housing.
There are the pristine halls of
Kimball, Lantana and Cas
tano, the peace and quiet of Ster
ling Quad and the aged but whole
some character of Stern and
Wilbur.
And then there's Alpha Sig. This
Cowell Cluster rebel and unofficial
fraternity of Exotic Erotic-infamy
has never prided itself on its clean
cut character or conducivity to
studying.
But a recent Office of Student
Affairs investigation brought the
Alpha Sigma house's traditional
initiation rituals — which allegedly
involve the hazing of first-year resi
dents — into question.
However, dumping water on peo
ple, calling them "shitties" for a
week or making them stand on
tables and tell jokes should not
cause any physical or psychological
trauma — provided the partici
pants are willing.
According to Alpha Sig residents,
all students who attend the house's
priority meetings are told about the
initiation and the house's "more
social" nature. In order to gain pri
ority, they are even asked to sign a
social contract — acknowledging
their, awareness of and commit
ment to the house's spirited atmo
sphere.
Ideally and historically, all of the
residents who draw into Alpha Sig
do so on priority. They are supposed
to know what they're getting into
and want to be in the house. Given
these circumstances, the initiation
serves its purpose of being a bond
ing experience for old and new resi
dents.
Alpha Sig's rambunctious
nature — which is partially defined
by its initiation — should not be
deemed completely reprehensible.

As one former resident said, it is
one of the few alternatives to the
typically quiet and less-active
upperclass dorms.
Trying to turn Alpha Sig into
Kimball would not only be unfeasi
ble, but also detract from the vari
ety that is one of University hous
ing's greatest strengths.
This year, Alpha Sig drew
unguaranteed, which may explain
the problems arising with initia
tion. Students who either do not
want to live in the house or have
inaccurate expectations of its atmo
sphere may find themselves in an
uncomfortable situation.
While the initiation rituals are
all in good fun, they can be intimi
dating and unpleasant for unwill
ing participants. And while resi
dents assert that there is no pres
sure to participate in the initiation,
there inevitably will be some pres
sure to participate in an activity
which the majority of residents
take part in.
Also, residents acknowledge that
many of the initiation activities
involve free-flowing alcohol, which
can also create an uncomfortable
environment for some. Even if
there is no explicit pressure to
drink, an abundance of alcohol can
leave non-drinkers feeling out in
the cold.
Whatever the results of the
investigation, Alpha Sig residents
should take the opportunity to
reexamine their initiation practices
for any activities that may lead peo
ple to feel pressured or uncomfort
able.
Also, while residents have little
control over fluctuations in the
Draw, it is important that they
make very clear in priority meeting
exactly what living in the house
and participating in initiation
entails.
Insuring that all residents who
choose to live there know what to
expect may involve greater publici
ty. This may help increase Alpha
Sig's popularity in the Draw and
avoid a situation in which unwilling
unguaranteed residents are placed
there.
