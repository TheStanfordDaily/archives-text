A CHURCH WITHOUT BIBLES?
Only at a place like Stanford would
something like this happen.
For one reason or another, there are
no Bibles in Memorial Church. Why is it
that there is a Bible in every hotel room
across the nation, but nary a one can be
found in the exact place you'd expect
them to be?
Most likely because Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg and the rest of the
powers-that-be are following the two
great Stanford commandments: multi
culturalism and money.
First of all, everyone needs to feel com
fortable in Mem Chu. God (or "archaic
ri6tiori of a higher~power"T forbid"some'-'""
one might accidentally pick up an Oxford
Annotated and read it without the guid
ance of a humanist CIV section leader.
You see, we don't want anyone offend
ed. Muslims and Buddhists should feel at
home in Mem Chu. Great. They can have
all the bread and wine they want. But I
don't think it's Bibles in the pews that are
going to turn them away. There are plen
ty of other things we need to worry about.
Yep. In order to keep everything Stan
fordesque, we'd better take down those
darn crosses â€” last time I checked, that
was a Christian icon. People might be
offended.
And while we're at it, someone better
knock out all those stained-glass windows
depicting Christ and various Christian

saints. Much safer if you replace them
with depictions of nice bowls of fruit.
Or maybe there could be a spotter in
the front and someone at a control board
in the back. If the spotter sees a Muslim
walking in, they can radio back "Islam
mode," at which point the control board
person can push a button which will
change all the paintings of Christ to
Mohammed. Or if a Hindu strolls in, the
saints can be changed to cows. Or if it's
an ancestor worshipper to be dealt with,
everything can be switched to pre-provid
ed family snapshots.
Forgive me for stating the obvious, but
it's a church. And not a church that was
built for any and all kinds of beliefs, like
some kind of spiritual Price Club. It's a
church built for Christian worship. The
giant mural of Jesus on the front tips you
off.
I don't think putting Bibles in a Chris
tian church would be too rebellious. In
fact, not putting Bibles in a church, in the
name of multiculturalism, seems more
than a little ridiculous.
Which brings us to possibility number
two. The Bibles are reportedly absent
because there isn't enough money to buy
them. The renovation of Memorial
Church cost about $12.5 million dollars.
The custom-made wooden chairs in the
small, seldom-used side chapel cost about
$1500 apiece. The whole church is
equipped with an expensive new speaker

system that usually works. There proba
bly wasn't enough money left over to buy
those Bible things.
If this is the case, maybe Gregg should
talk to the Gideons. I'm sure they have
plenty left over after providing every
Motel Six in the nation with one. But
then again, their Bibles might not be
expensive enough. Or maybe they would
clash with one of the mosaics.
What Gregg, et al. needs to do is stop
worrying about not offending anybody
and saving money. We need to use a little
common sense. Water is to fountains as
Bibles are to churches. Seems to make
sense to me. If we felt really daring, we
could even get some hymnals in there.
But, then again, they're probably too
expensive. And people who can't sing
might be offended.
You wanna hear the kicker? There are
over 100 pews in the main sanctuary of
the church. And every single one of them
has an empty little holder on the back for
a Bible. Go figure.

Mike Langford could be that antichrist
guy you were all warned about. He'll be
thumping his little anti-Bible here every
Wednesday.
