Ice-T at Stanford does not represent anti-intellectualism

WITH FRIDAY'S EDITORIAL,
The Daily's new editorial staff
officially establishes itself as
uninsightful at best, elitist and closed
minded at worst. To maintain itself as
the intellectual police of this institution
is to tread on very dangerous ground,
especially with respect to the issue most
cited, Ice-T's Feb. 20 lecture. The offen
sive insinuations made in Friday's col
umn reflect an anti-intellectualism far
more dangerous than that which you
attempt to criticize.
You have wrongly dismissed and
belittled Ice-T's lecture on free speech

and civil liberties before even hearing it
for yourselves. In doing so, you have
ignored an entire perspective on the
issue at hand, leaving yourselves noth
ing but the polyester-clad politicos you
suggest I invite to campus. If you would
like to hear what Tipper Gore, Jesse
Helms or "any judge" has to say, by all
means, head up such a program. But I
guarantee that the campus would be less
interested and less willing to spark real
debate and discussion on First Amend
ment rights.
Ice-T's perspective on free speech is
not frivolous and his appearance on

campus is not wrong. It should not be
compared to Pete Huyck's White Plaza
prank or the harmless prevalence of
"Beverly Hills 90210" on this campus.
If there is, indeed, an anti-intellectual
streak among the student body, it is not
reflected in any of the examples sighted
in Friday's column. You truly embar
rass yourselves for not recognizing this
fact.
If The Daily would like to create the
"intellectual" atmosphere that it glori
fies, then invite every theorist and elect
ed official you like. Prop them up in an
auditorium to talk about every lofty

issue you deem worthy. Shut yourself off
from the world outside of academia and
disregard any and all perspectives that
do not parallel your own.
You wrote that "What we have are
some of the brightest students in the
country trying very hard not to be
nerdy," when, in fact, what you have are
the students of a very famous university
looking beyond its walls to get some real,
tangible and varying perspectives on an
issue. If that's anti-intellectualism, well
then shave my ass and call me Brenda.
