# Dialogue and debate a must to resolve issue of multicultural education
## 
### 
In a recent letter to The Daily, Dennis
Matthies emphasizes the need for dia
logue in discussing the issues of multi
cultural education. Without dialogue, he
argues, we are sunk: we close our ears to
others, we relax in the comfort of pre
ferred answers, we prevent others from
learning. Surely, he is right. Without
openness to dialogue, we can't hope to
resolve these issues.
Whereas dialogue makes it possible to
discuss the issues of multicultural edu
cation, however, Matthies argues that
debate prevents such discussion. As
opposed to dialogue, he claims, debate is
divisive, unquestioning, mean-spirited
and futile. "Debate, high or low, is an
artless way of promoting growth in feel
ing or thought. Debate only leads to
more debate." It is with these points
that I take issue. Although debate may
sometimes be divisive, unquestioning
and mean-spirited, ultimately it is neces
sary if we hope to resolve the issues of
multiculturalism at all.
Debate, we might first note, does not

always lead to more debate. Some
debates, thankfully, are dead and gone.
We no longer find ourselves arguing over
such things as love affairs amongst the
gods, phlogiston, racial superiority or the
health benefits of smoking. Debates on
these subjects have ended. They have
been won or lost. The arguments sup
porting the winners — whether from
fact, generalization or theory — were
decisively better than those supporting
the losers.
This wasn't, of course, immediately
apparent at the time. Debate often arms
itself with the basest of weapons and
employs the most deceptive of tactics.
But this is no reason to cast it overboard.
Slowly, it works. Bad arguments, though
perhaps temporarily inflated by passion,
do not persist indefinitely. They can, and
eventually must, fall to better ones.
The most fundamental point is that
issues of multicultural education (such
as those by De Souza and Glass) must be
resolved in the arena of reason, not that
of politics. Reason is the language of
debate; politics that of dialogue. While
dialogue can open channels of communi
cation, it cannot hope to resolve such
issues by itself. Dialogue can make for
conversations or for peace treaties, but it
cannot make for the resolution of argu
ments. Only debate can.

Without dialogue, intelligent debate
about the issues of multicultural educa
tion is impossible. Without debate, how
ever, these issues cannot be resolved.
