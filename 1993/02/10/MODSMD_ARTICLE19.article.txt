"There's a sucker born every minute."
— P.T. Barnum
"Never give a sucker an even break."
- W.C. Fields
Recently, my Stanford roommate sent
me some clippings of the editorial squab
ble over speakers for this year's com
mencement. I was amazed at the gen
uine lack of understanding, and even
greater yet, the lack of a sense of humor
in the whole business.
The two men above have little in com
mon, but they each hit in the dynamic at
work in the wonderful, Disneyesque,
ethics-class hypothetical that unfolded
on this esteemed periodical's pages. Hav
ing been through the whole commence
ment business, I feel I am just as much

an expert on it as say, Dopey.
We all have this vision of the fame we
deserve, and we want our graduation
speaker to reflect the grandiose super
star we think they are and we will be.
Those who are famous like Madonna and
Hunter Thompson realize that, and bend
us over and give it to us .
Clearly, a graduation speaker should
reflect something else; for instance, the
particular transitional state of our fine
alma mater. I propose that former Presi
dent Gerald Ford be the speaker; he and
new President Casper can sit up at
Hoover House during commencement
weekend and laugh about the striking
similarities in their respective promo
tions while swilling peppermint
schnapps and driving golf balls out over
the faculty ghetto.
In June, 1991, it was hot, I was
excited to start real life, and old John
Whatshisname gave a pretty darned
good speech. Until you actually gradu
ate, it is hard to fathom anything less
than Jesus Christ being your gradua
tion speaker. Life goes on, and getting
your mom to take pictures of something
other than the facade of Mem Chu can
be more important than who speaks on
Sunday.
