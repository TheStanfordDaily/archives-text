## Food, females and fun in all-women's floor experience 
### 
Living on an all-female floor is kind of
like being on the set of "Designing
Women."
Without the mint juleps.
When I drew into my dorm last year, I
didn't know about the sex-segregation
thing. At in-house draw, after the trauma
of not getting the one single on my floor, I
looked up at the poster on the wall, and
noticed a strange phenomenon.
There would be no men.
No men? I wept soft, bitter tears. I was
crushed. No big, muscular, testosterone
fueled men walking to the showers hold
ing their towels in the back to expose their
nicely-shaped bottoms.
Life was so unfair.
Not that the whole unguaranteed thing
wasn't bad enough. I mean, I was going to
have to share a room, a room that wasn't
even a nice room. A room with brown cab
inets, closets and trim. A room in a dorm
with gang showers. A dorm with bath
room stalls narrower than my hips. It was
going to be a rough year.
What was this, Mills?
I like men. They're great. They make

good housepets. They're loyal, trainable,
good to vent hormonal frustrations with,
easily housebroken and generally receive a
positive ranking in my book.
But this was an all-female floor.
What, I gasped, could be this horrible
thing, this manless floor? Thirty Thirty
women with matching menstrual cycles
sitting around in honey-mustard mud
masques, braiding each other's hair?
For just a moment, I was excited.
This was my chance to talk to women. I
always talked to my mom, but the whole
concept of female companionship had
never hit me. Women don't take you out
on dates. Women try to steal your
boyfriend. Women give you dirty looks.
Women say you look fat.
I'd never trust a woman.
I'm a woman. I wouldn't trust me.
Stab you in the back without batting an
eyelash, kiddo. Call me Medea, and don't
leave me at home with the kids. No loyal
ty. Nothing.
OK, maybe I'm not that bad.
But co-ed floors were kind of a given in
my Stanford living experience. Backrubs,

orgies, naked pillowfights all flashed
before my eyes.
I was going to be a nun.
Due to my astronomical Draw number,
I had to forfeit any hope I had of becom
ing a Cosmo woman, a high-powered exec
utive in a Coco Chanel powersuit, making
high-powered deals and getting what I
wanted by my smarts, savvy and sexual
prowess.
All my dreams, smashed to bits.
And so I came to school this year, won
dering what was in store. Would I be
scorned for shaving my legs? Would I have
to make up stories about hating my moth
er? Would I teach someone algebra to
learn about tampons in return?
I don't get cramps, OK, I just don't.
I don't know why, and I didn't want to
have to explain.
I sullenly succumbed to the realization
that there would no longer be day-to-day
sexual tension between me and my neigh
bors.
The cruelty of it all.
But I made an effort to meet the
women on my floor. For once, I could walk

to the bathroom in a long T-shirt and
underwear and get away with it. There
was no point to it, but I could.
So maybe it was nice.
I was exposed to the secret activities I'd
heard of, but never experienced. I began
to enjoy naked aerobics. I reveled in step
ping on the scale each day to see that my
weight was a perfect 102 pounds. I looked
forward to our weekly chats extolling the
virtues of virile men from Texas.
And we bonded. We held meetings. We
ate food. We wrote crude comments
about idyllic measurements on our dry
erase board. Without having to stroke
their fragile egos, let them open my
doors, let them pay for my ridiculously
expensive meals, suffer through their
extravagant gifts of jewelry and ask them
really dumb questions about how cars
work.
As we sat around in floor meetings, I
learned a new brand of female chauvinism.
Before this year, I was a puritanical librari
an-in-training. I feel I have lost that.
Frida Kahlo would be so proud.
Sitting around with our jockstraps on,

my fellow females and I discussed sporting
events, pounded beers, rubbed our bloated
stomachs and remarked on the physical
attributes of passersby. We grew goatees
and played poker until late into the night.
Well, isn't that what women do?
And we laughed, we cried, we shared
our innermost secrets and our great
grandmothers' meatloaf recipes. I picked
up great makeup tips, became comfortable
with my body and switched to "clear"
deodorant.
My father would be so proud.
And half-way through the whole thing,
I'd have to say I'm happy it all happened.
I may not have gotten in the mandatory
floor-scam, but I have come to the brutal
realization that all women are not Public
Enemy No.l. I wouldn't let one give a sig
nificant other of mine a backrub, mind
you, but all-in-all they are up there on my
list right above weekends in the Bahamas.
And they don't leave the toilet seat up.

next year to get the opposite experience. Her
column appears here Wednesdays.

learned a new brand of female chauvinism.
Before this year, I was a puritanical librari
an-in-training. I feel I have lost that.
Frida Kahlo would be so proud.
Sitting around with our jockstraps on,

my fellow females and I discussed sporting
events, pounded beers, rubbed our bloated
stomachs and remarked on the physical
attributes of passersby. We grew goatees
and played poker until late into the night.
Well, isn't that what women do?
And we laughed, we cried, we shared
our innermost secrets and our great
grandmothers' meatloaf recipes. I picked
up great makeup tips, became comfortable
with my body and switched to "clear"
deodorant.
My father would be so proud.
And half-way through the whole thing,
I'd have to say I'm happy it all happened.
I may not have gotten in the mandatory
floor-scam, but I have come to the brutal
realization that all women are not Public
Enemy No.l. I wouldn't let one give a sig
nificant other of mine a backrub, mind
you, but all-in-all they are up there on my
list right above weekends in the Bahamas.
And they don't leave the toilet seat up.

Living on an all-female floor is kind of
like being on the set of "Designing
Women."
Without the mint juleps.
When I drew into my dorm last year, I
didn't know about the sex-segregation
thing. At in-house draw, after the trauma
of not getting the one single on my floor, I
looked up at the poster on the wall, and
noticed a strange phenomenon.
There would be no men.
No men? I wept soft, bitter tears. I was
crushed. No big, muscular, testosterone
fueled men walking to the showers hold
ing their towels in the back to expose their
nicely-shaped bottoms.
Life was so unfair.
Not that the whole unguaranteed thing
wasn't bad enough. I mean, I was going to
have to share a room, a room that wasn't
even a nice room. A room with brown cab
inets, closets and trim. A room in a dorm
with gang showers. A dorm with bath
room stalls narrower than my hips. It was
going to be a rough year.
What was this, Mills?
I like men. They're great. They make

good housepets. They're loyal, trainable,
good to vent hormonal frustrations with,
easily housebroken and generally receive a
positive ranking in my book.
But this was an all-female floor.
What, I gasped, could be this horrible
thing, this manless floor? Thirty Thirty
women with matching menstrual cycles
sitting around in honey-mustard mud
masques, braiding each other's hair?
For just a moment, I was excited.
This was my chance to talk to women. I
always talked to my mom, but the whole
concept of female companionship had
never hit me. Women don't take you out
on dates. Women try to steal your
boyfriend. Women give you dirty looks.
Women say you look fat.
I'd never trust a woman.
I'm a woman. I wouldn't trust me.
Stab you in the back without batting an
eyelash, kiddo. Call me Medea, and don't
leave me at home with the kids. No loyal
ty. Nothing.
OK, maybe I'm not that bad.
But co-ed floors were kind of a given in
my Stanford living experience. Backrubs,

orgies, naked pillowfights all flashed
before my eyes.
I was going to be a nun.
Due to my astronomical Draw number,
I had to forfeit any hope I had of becom
ing a Cosmo woman, a high-powered exec
utive in a Coco Chanel powersuit, making
high-powered deals and getting what I
wanted by my smarts, savvy and sexual
prowess.
All my dreams, smashed to bits.
And so I came to school this year, won
dering what was in store. Would I be
scorned for shaving my legs? Would I have
to make up stories about hating my moth
er? Would I teach someone algebra to
learn about tampons in return?
I don't get cramps, OK, I just don't.
I don't know why, and I didn't want to
have to explain.
I sullenly succumbed to the realization
that there would no longer be day-to-day
sexual tension between me and my neigh
bors.
The cruelty of it all.
But I made an effort to meet the
women on my floor. For once, I could walk

to the bathroom in a long T-shirt and
underwear and get away with it. There
was no point to it, but I could.
So maybe it was nice.
I was exposed to the secret activities I'd
heard of, but never experienced. I began
to enjoy naked aerobics. I reveled in step
ping on the scale each day to see that my
weight was a perfect 102 pounds. I looked
forward to our weekly chats extolling the
virtues of virile men from Texas.
And we bonded. We held meetings. We
ate food. We wrote crude comments
about idyllic measurements on our dry
erase board. Without having to stroke
their fragile egos, let them open my
doors, let them pay for my ridiculously
expensive meals, suffer through their
extravagant gifts of jewelry and ask them
really dumb questions about how cars
work.
