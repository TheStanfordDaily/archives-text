## Cupid, pull back your bow and let your aphrodisiacs go 
### Troy Parkins Editorial staff 
The mythical Cupid, slinging <
his aphrodisiac arrow, enchants 1
people's imagination every Valen- <
tine's Day. Cupid may not be real,
but is the idea of an aphrodisiac <
just a myth? !
In what may come as a disap- ]
pointment to many, Human Biol- I
ogy Prof. Herant Katchadourian
said there is no evidence to indi
cate that any substance

demonstrates aphro
disiac properties in
humans.

But that doesn't mean aphro- j
disiacs don't exist. According to
Katchadourian, the word aphro
disiac, a derivative of Aphrodite,
the Greek goddess of love, has two
definitions.
Although an aphrodisiac is
commonly used to define a sub
stance that sexually stimulates a
person without their knowledge,
the word is also used to represent

substances that "turn
on" a person with
their knowledge.
According to the
professor, there are
thousands of sub
stances that turn
someone on, but none
that do so without the

person knowing.
People may use items such as
food, music, lotions and lacy
underwear to sexually excite each
other, he said.
On the other hand, people
dream about secretly giving a love
potion to that special someone,
which will induce the someone to
fall madly in love
with them.

Erotic
potions have

been around
for about 4,000

years, since ancient
Egyptian civilization.
According to Katchadourian,
there are over 500 substances
that have been identified as sexu
al stimulants, but none have been
shown to be effective in carefully
controlled scientific experiments.
There have been numerous
experiments done to determine if
aphrodisiacs are biologically pos
sible.
According to Katchadourian,
scientists have looked into how
testosterone, male sex hormone,
affects sex drive.
If a male is deficient in sex hor
mones and is given extra doses of
testosterone, then he will become
more sexually active. But scien
tists who gave a normal male
extra testosterone observed no

change in sex drive.
Katchadourian said giving a
normal male extra testosterone
was similar to adding water in a
glass that is already full. The
glass can only hold so much water
— a male is only able to have so
much sex hormone.
Researchers have also tried

similar experi
ments on women.
When women were
given testosterone,
researchers noticed

some rise in sex drive.
Katchadourian attributes this to
a woman's lack of large quantities
of testosterone.
A pheromone is another chem
ical substance people associate
with aphrodisiacs. Pheromones
refer to any of a number of chem
ical substances that are secreted
externally to produce sexual
responses in other individuals of
the same species.
Scientists discovered phero
mones in 1959, to explain chemi
cal sex attractants in insects.
Over the years, researchers have
done experiments to determine if
human pheromones act in
attracting humans to each other.
Katchadourian said that
pheromones have not been
linked to having aphrodisiac
properties in humans. He also
said it is unlikely that
pheromones would ever override
all of the other characteristics
that make people attractive to
each other.
Other than chemical sub

stances, over the years, people
have suggested preparation of
some rather interesting items.
Documented in Katchadourian's
book, "Fundamentals of Human
Sexuality," some of these offbeat
potions include bat blood mixed
with donkey's milk, dried sala
mander, ground cricket, salted
crocodile and vineyard snails.
If you cannot locate any of the
above substances, try some
hedgehog genitals, fat of camel's
hump or some menstrual fluid.
Oysters, rhinoceros horn and
bananas have also been cited.
Katchadourian said that shape
has a lot to do with what people
believed to be aphrodisiacs. A
rhinoceros horn or a banana looks
like an erect penis, therefore peo
ple dub it an aphrodisiac.
People tend to relate food
items as aphrodisiacs. But
researchers have found no evi
dence of any food acting as an
aphrodisiac, said Jerry Russel, a
professor of food chemistry at the
University of California at Davis.
"I heard some scoop on televi
sion that avocados are aphrodisi
acs. The avocado people would
love to have that repeated," Rus
sel said, speculating that it proba
bly was not avocados in the gua
camole, but the accompanying
three margaritas that produced
the effect.
According to Russel, there
have been no Earth shattering
discoveries concerning aphrodisi
ac foods and no one is working on
finding any.

Although herbs, like ginseng,
have been attributed to increasing
libido, Russel said it does no more
than relax a person.
Cindy White, a licensed
acupuncturist in Palo Alto, uses
herbs to treat some of her clients.
"People don't come in looking for
an herb they can use for an aphro
disiac," she said.
White said that some people
believe herbs are a sure thing and
will cure them, but they are just
wasting their money because
herbs work depending on the indi
vidual. So, even if a single herb
that contained aphrodisiac prop
erties did exist, it may. not work
on everybody, she said.
Some scientists say that even
placebos can function as aphro
disiacs for some people. Psycholo
gy Prof. Philip Zimbardo said that
if a person thinks the aphrodisiac
substance will work and it does, it
acts like a placebo.
A placebo is a harmless,
unmedicated preparation — usu
ally a sugar pill. The patient
believes that they are getting a
medicated pill when, in fact, they
are getting a placebo.
The placebo effect — the
patient experiencing a supposed
aphrodisiac-like effect from the
placebo — is attributed to mind
over matter, he said. *
But Zimbardo said he doubts if
real aphrodisiacs are possible,
because if they were, they would
have been marketed already.
"Nothing would sell better than
sex inducers," he said.

his aphrodisiac arrow, enchants 1
people's imagination every Valen- <
tine's Day. Cupid may not be real,
but is the idea of an aphrodisiac <
just a myth? !
In what may come as a disap- ]
pointment to many, Human Biol- I
ogy Prof. Herant Katchadourian
said there is no evidence to indi
cate that any substance

demonstrates aphro
disiac properties in
humans.

But that doesn't mean aphro- j
disiacs don't exist. According to
Katchadourian, the word aphro
disiac, a derivative of Aphrodite,
the Greek goddess of love, has two
definitions.
Although an aphrodisiac is
commonly used to define a sub
stance that sexually stimulates a
person without their knowledge,
the word is also used to represent

substances that "turn
on" a person with
their knowledge.
According to the
professor, there are
thousands of sub
stances that turn
someone on, but none
that do so without the

person knowing.
People may use items such as
food, music, lotions and lacy
underwear to sexually excite each
other, he said.
On the other hand, people
dream about secretly giving a love
potion to that special someone,
which will induce the someone to
fall madly in love
with them.

Erotic
potions have

been around
for about 4,000

years, since ancient
Egyptian civilization.
According to Katchadourian,
there are over 500 substances
that have been identified as sexu
al stimulants, but none have been
shown to be effective in carefully
controlled scientific experiments.
There have been numerous
experiments done to determine if
aphrodisiacs are biologically pos
sible.
According to Katchadourian,
scientists have looked into how
testosterone, male sex hormone,
affects sex drive.
If a male is deficient in sex hor
mones and is given extra doses of
testosterone, then he will become
more sexually active. But scien
tists who gave a normal male
extra testosterone observed no

change in sex drive.
Katchadourian said giving a
normal male extra testosterone
was similar to adding water in a
glass that is already full. The
glass can only hold so much water
— a male is only able to have so
much sex hormone.
Researchers have also tried

similar experi
ments on women.
When women were
given testosterone,
researchers noticed

some rise in sex drive.
Katchadourian attributes this to
a woman's lack of large quantities
of testosterone.
A pheromone is another chem
ical substance people associate
with aphrodisiacs. Pheromones
refer to any of a number of chem
ical substances that are secreted
externally to produce sexual
responses in other individuals of
the same species.
Scientists discovered phero
mones in 1959, to explain chemi
cal sex attractants in insects.
Over the years, researchers have
done experiments to determine if
human pheromones act in
attracting humans to each other.
Katchadourian said that
pheromones have not been
linked to having aphrodisiac
properties in humans. He also
said it is unlikely that
pheromones would ever override
all of the other characteristics
that make people attractive to
each other.
Other than chemical sub

stances, over the years, people
have suggested preparation of
some rather interesting items.
Documented in Katchadourian's
book, "Fundamentals of Human
Sexuality," some of these offbeat
potions include bat blood mixed
with donkey's milk, dried sala
mander, ground cricket, salted
crocodile and vineyard snails.
If you cannot locate any of the
above substances, try some
hedgehog genitals, fat of camel's
hump or some menstrual fluid.
Oysters, rhinoceros horn and
bananas have also been cited.
Katchadourian said that shape
has a lot to do with what people
believed to be aphrodisiacs. A
rhinoceros horn or a banana looks
like an erect penis, therefore peo
ple dub it an aphrodisiac.
People tend to relate food
items as aphrodisiacs. But
researchers have found no evi
dence of any food acting as an
aphrodisiac, said Jerry Russel, a
professor of food chemistry at the
University of California at Davis.
"I heard some scoop on televi
sion that avocados are aphrodisi
acs. The avocado people would
love to have that repeated," Rus
sel said, speculating that it proba
bly was not avocados in the gua
camole, but the accompanying
three margaritas that produced
the effect.
According to Russel, there
have been no Earth shattering
discoveries concerning aphrodisi
ac foods and no one is working on
finding any.

Although herbs, like ginseng,
have been attributed to increasing
libido, Russel said it does no more
than relax a person.
Cindy White, a licensed
acupuncturist in Palo Alto, uses
herbs to treat some of her clients.
"People don't come in looking for
an herb they can use for an aphro
disiac," she said.
White said that some people
believe herbs are a sure thing and
will cure them, but they are just
wasting their money because
herbs work depending on the indi
vidual. So, even if a single herb
that contained aphrodisiac prop
erties did exist, it may. not work
on everybody, she said.
Some scientists say that even
placebos can function as aphro
disiacs for some people. Psycholo
gy Prof. Philip Zimbardo said that
if a person thinks the aphrodisiac
substance will work and it does, it
acts like a placebo.
A placebo is a harmless,
unmedicated preparation — usu
ally a sugar pill. The patient
believes that they are getting a
medicated pill when, in fact, they
are getting a placebo.
The placebo effect — the
patient experiencing a supposed
aphrodisiac-like effect from the
placebo — is attributed to mind
over matter, he said. *
But Zimbardo said he doubts if
real aphrodisiacs are possible,
because if they were, they would
have been marketed already.
"Nothing would sell better than
sex inducers," he said.
