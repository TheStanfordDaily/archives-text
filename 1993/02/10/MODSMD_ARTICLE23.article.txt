# Valentine warning
## Some sage advice for stopping Herpes 
### Catherine Ivey 
It's four days 'til Valentine's
Day and chances are (if you're
lucky) you want to look good for
that special date with your signif
icant other.
You check your looks in the
mirror. No acne, no bags under
the eyes. You're psyched. But
wait . . . what's that on your
upper lip? A canker sore? A cold
sore? No. It's your worst night
mare — Herpes!
Herpes! How gross! You can
kiss Valentine's Day goodbye.
That's about all you should be
kissing if you plan on keeping
your herpes to yourself.
What is Herpes?
Herpes is a viral infection and
is sexually transmitted. Like
other viruses, the herpes virus
lives by invading cells and taking
them over. But unlike many
other viruses, the herpes virus
never goes away; it stays dormant
in nerve cells near the spinal col
umn.
According to Dr. John Dor
man, a staff physician at Co well
Health Center, more than 95 per
cent of the population has the
herpes virus. In most people, the
virus was introduced to the body
during childhood and caused a
sore throat, fever and some
sweating — all of which disap
peared.
But even though its initial
symptoms disappear, the herpes
virus continues to live on in the
body and recurs sporadically.
Such recurrence can be seen by
the formation of blisters, either
around the mouth or in the geni
tal region. Interestingly, when
people first get oral herpes, sores
develop only on the inside of the

mouth. But when it reappears,
however, the sores break out on
the outside of the mouth as well.
The exact causes of a recur
rence differ from person to per
son. For some people, sores never
appear. For others, herpes sores
might develop every month, pos
sibly triggered by sunlight, stress
and even menstruation.
These sores have also been
called cold sores, which has mis
led people into thinking they are
not contagious or serious. But in
truth, there is no difference
between a herpes sore and a cold
sore.
Another popular belief is that
Herpes are canker sores. They are
not. Canker sores, located inside
the mouth, are thought to be
caused by bacteria and aren't sex
ually transmitted.
Are Herpes spread by kissing?
Yep! Herpes is spread by kiss
ing and from other contact, too.
There are two types of herpes:
simplex I and simplex 11. In the
past, simplex I sores developed
only in the oral region and sim
plex II sores developed on the
genitalia.
But, due to the increased fre
quency of oral sex over the past
few decades, these two viruses
have become interchangeable and
can be transmitted to and from
either region.
What this means is that the
type of herpes that forms oral
sores can also cause painful blis
ters in the genital area. Herpes
blisters usually start out as a red
spot that is sensitive to the touch.
As it develops, the sore
becomes filled with fluid and blis
ters. Once the blister opens, it
lasts as an open ulceration for
about a week.
Though herpes is classified as
a sexually transmitted disease, it
can also be transmitted by con
tact — involving sweating and
pressing with the blisters. You
can spread it by touching another

part of your body or, more likely,
someone else's body.
Most people should be con
cerned with "catching" herpes
from someone with whom they
are sexually active. If you or your
partner has herpes blisters, doc
tors recommend abstaining from
kissing, intercourse and oral sex.
Condoms will not necessarily
fully protect either partner.
To date, there is no cure for
herpes. However, an anti-viral

treatment, known as acyclovir,
helps to get rid of the blisters
once they have occurred.
But even with acyclovir treat
ment, there is a 50 percent
chance of developing blisters
again. Acyclovir requires a pre
scription and is available at
Cowell.
