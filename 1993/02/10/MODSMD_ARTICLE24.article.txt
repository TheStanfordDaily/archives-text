# New theory the talk of language world
## Prof. uses own method called mass comparison

As early humans spread over the globe,
their steady march wore a path across the con
tinents and their speech wore a path into mod
ern times. The language remnants on this
path are signs directing man back to his ori
gins.
While the most widely accepted technique
in comparative linguistics simultaneously
examines only two or three languages for sim
ilar grammar, vocabulary and sound corre
spondences, Prof. Joseph Greenberg is using a
new, broader technique called mass compari
son to study the spread of languages in the
Americas.
Mass comparison, developed by Greenberg,
a professor emeritus of anthropology and lin
guistics, and advanced by researcher Merritt
Ruhlen, requires a wider perspective than tra
ditional methods. Rather than comparing only
a few languages, Grpenberg searches large col
lections of languages for similarities among
stable words like parts of the human body,
numbers and pronouns.
According to Greenberg, this method expos
es trends running through different families
that trace each to a common ancestor. "The
more you compare, and the more languages
you have, the more accurate your reconstruc
tion of linguistic history will be," he said.
Greenberg sparked controversy by using
mass comparison to classify the native lan
guages of North and South America into three
broad family groups: Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene,
and Amerind. The members of each group
trace their roots to one of three waves of
migrants from Asia.
One language family, Eskimo-Aleut, occurs
in the Arctic and was spread by Asian people
entering the continent 4,000 years ago. The
language is part of the larger Eurasiatic fami
ly, which includes Indo-European languages.
Na-Dene, found in Canada and the south
western United States, entered the Americas
in another migratory wave 6,000 years ago.
This family resembles Chinese, Tibetan, and
the languages of the northern Caucasus. Both
Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene are widely recog
nized, but Greenberg's proposed third group,
the Amerind family, is the most controversial.
Amerind comprises the remaining lan
guages of North and South America and
relates to the Eurasiatic family. Siberian
immigrants are believed to have carried the
Amerind parent language to the American
continent 12,000 years ago, where it diverged
into hundreds of Native American tongues.

Critics charge that Greenberg's mass com
parison, which provides evidence for the
Amerind group, is inaccurate. Some also
believe it is impossible to trace any language
back more than 6,000 years, because concrete
evidence of word remnants diminishes farther
back in time.
Greenberg said that certain stable words

remain virtually intact over long periods,
allowing researchers to trace languages back
through time. For example, Greenberg and
Ruhlen notice the respective use of 'n' and 'm'
in the stable first and second person pronouns
in many Native American tongues. They
