# New theory the talk of language world
## Prof. uses own method called mass comparison 
### Julie Sauer 
As early humans spread over the globe,
their steady march wore a path across the con
tinents and their speech wore a path into mod
ern times. The language remnants on this
path are signs directing man back to his ori
gins.
While the most widely accepted technique
in comparative linguistics simultaneously
examines only two or three languages for sim
ilar grammar, vocabulary and sound corre
spondences, Prof. Joseph Greenberg is using a
new, broader technique called mass compari
son to study the spread of languages in the
Americas.
Mass comparison, developed by Greenberg,
a professor emeritus of anthropology and lin
guistics, and advanced by researcher Merritt
Ruhlen, requires a wider perspective than tra
ditional methods. Rather than comparing only
a few languages, Grpenberg searches large col
lections of languages for similarities among
stable words like parts of the human body,
numbers and pronouns.
According to Greenberg, this method expos
es trends running through different families
that trace each to a common ancestor. "The
more you compare, and the more languages
you have, the more accurate your reconstruc
tion of linguistic history will be," he said.
Greenberg sparked controversy by using
mass comparison to classify the native lan
guages of North and South America into three
broad family groups: Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene,
and Amerind. The members of each group
trace their roots to one of three waves of
migrants from Asia.
One language family, Eskimo-Aleut, occurs
in the Arctic and was spread by Asian people
entering the continent 4,000 years ago. The
language is part of the larger Eurasiatic fami
ly, which includes Indo-European languages.
Na-Dene, found in Canada and the south
western United States, entered the Americas
in another migratory wave 6,000 years ago.
This family resembles Chinese, Tibetan, and
the languages of the northern Caucasus. Both
Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene are widely recog
nized, but Greenberg's proposed third group,
the Amerind family, is the most controversial.
Amerind comprises the remaining lan
guages of North and South America and
relates to the Eurasiatic family. Siberian
immigrants are believed to have carried the
Amerind parent language to the American
continent 12,000 years ago, where it diverged
into hundreds of Native American tongues.

Critics charge that Greenberg's mass com
parison, which provides evidence for the
Amerind group, is inaccurate. Some also
believe it is impossible to trace any language
back more than 6,000 years, because concrete
evidence of word remnants diminishes farther
back in time.
Greenberg said that certain stable words

remain virtually intact over long periods,
allowing researchers to trace languages back
through time. For example, Greenberg and
Ruhlen notice the respective use of 'n' and 'm'
in the stable first and second person pronouns
in many Native American tongues. They

believe that this observation links
the many tongues to a common
ancestor that they named
Amerind.
The researchers also cite Stan
ford geneticist Luigi Cavalli-
Sforza's independent discovery
that there are three genetic
groups of Native Americans. The
genetic groups correspond geo
graphically with the proposed lan
guage groups, including the
Amerind group.

Genetic evidence indicates that
the tribes comprising the Amerind
group diverged from a common
ancestral stock that entered the
Americas nearly 15,000 years ago.
Amerind's Native American
languages are similar to the
Eurasia tic family, which includes
English. In attempting to explain
the reluctance of conventional lin
guists to accept the Amerind fam
ily, Ruhlen said, "I think there's a
remnant of 19th century racism.
We don't really want to have some
of these 'savages' too closely relat
ed to us. I think there's still a
tinge of this."
If Native American tongues can

be classified and traced to larger
families, can these larger families
lead back to one common source, a
world language? Ruhlen advo
cates this theory and studies
world language families. His
research discovered words like
"kuan" (dog), "kano" (arm), and
"aq'wa" (water), that appear in
related forms in languages
throughout the world.
Greenberg also acknowledges
the possibility of a single ancestral
language. "Language was a single
invention," he said, "In fact, it was
probably the thing most of all
which allowed Homo sapiens to
spread."
