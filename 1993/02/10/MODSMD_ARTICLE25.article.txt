# Pensive bug ponders about planes, pheromones and periods

r\ Why does traveling in an airplane
yymake some women menstruate out of
cycle ? It happened to a friend recently.
— Altitude
A : Did your friend cross the interna
xVtional date line? If so, was her period
off by exactly one day in either direction?
Yes?
Next question, please.
Fortunately for the readers, there is a
more interesting (and, what's more, bio
logical) answer to your query. But first, I
should apologize to half of the reading
public: If you've ever menstruated (and if

you've done it once, chances are you've
done it a couple of times), much of what
follows will be as familiar and interesting
as cramps.
Nonetheless, in the interest of gender

equality, next week's column will discuss
some peculiarity of male physiology:
chewing tobacco, farting or urinating
while standing up.
As it turns out, any one of a plethora
of factors can knock one of the fairer sex
off her usual monthly cycle: stress, insuf
ficient caloric intake, excessive exercise,
travel, et al. It is these last two ("travel"
and "al.") which are most relevant to the
issue at hand.
Amenorrhea (fake Greek for "not
menstruating") frequently occurs in
women when they travel. In some cases,
even the anticipation of travel (and the
associated anxieties, like how to fit ten
pairs of shoes, twenty pairs of jeans and
all that hair stuff into one bag) can delay
a perfectly healthy woman's period.

If your friend's period started late, and
resumed normal cycling after her travel
ing was over, I would guess that the trav
el itself was responsible for the deviation.
Airplane travel has so many more anxi
eties associated with it than other sorts of
locomotion (fear
of a fiery, sudden death topping the list)
that even if your friend doesn't become
amenorrheic contemplating a long drive,
flying might have caused her to reset her
biological clock as well as her wristwatch.
If, on the other hand, her period com
menced earlier than expected, travel anx
iety probably doesn't explain the prob
lem. This brings us to the second relevant
factor mentioned previously: al., or alii
— literally, "others." As every woman
who's ever lived in a dorm can tell you,

females living in close proximity to other
females undergo changes in their cycles
that result in synchronization of their
menstrual periods.
Menstrual synchrony was first docu
mented in 1964, when a pack of
researchers without enough to do
descended on a college dormitory with a
ream of invasive questionnaires. The
dorm contained 135 girls (hey, lay off, it
was 1964) between the ages of 17 and 22,
all of whom (with one exception, appar
ently) lived in Stern-style, single-room
doubles. The researchers asked their sub
jects a battery of personal questions
regarding their friends, social practices
and menstrual periods.


The Science Bug
No significant menstrual syn
chrony was observed on the dorm
level. However, a high degree of
uniformity in the day menstrua
tion began was observed for sub
jects who were either roommates
or close friends. The key variable
seemed to be the amount of time
the subjects spent near one anoth
er.
Presumably, since women can't
just ring each other up and plan to
menstruate on the same day,
some biological factor was respon
sible for this well-documented
synchrony. Pheromones were sug
gested as a possible mechanism,
but evidence was scanty.
A pheromone is sort of a mobile
hormone: one organism exudes it

and another nearby member of
the same species experiences
physiological consequences.
Insects are known to use
pheromones for mate-finding, but
until the study I'm about to
describe was published, no one
knew for certain that pheromones
might influence human sexual
behavior.
To test the pheromone hypoth
esis, researchers rubbed auxiliary
secretions (translation: "armpit
sweat") from a single woman on
the upper lip of experimental sub
jects (yum), and observed the
effects on menstruation. This
treatment shifted the mean differ
ence in day of onset of menses
from 9.3 days (in a control group)
to 3.4 days after four months of
treatment.
Even though the subjects expe
rienced no personal contact with
the donor of the "perfume," they

still exhibited menstrual syn
chrony — a sure sign that some
element of a cycling woman's
sweat has the power to affect
other women's periods.
In a crowded environment like
the inside of an airplane, the
effects of proximity might be
accelerated. I know women who
have locked entire halls of Bran
ner into their cycle. Put one of
these dominant "alpha" females
on board a trans-Atlantic flight
(with nothing to breathe but recir
culated air) and I bet more than a
few of their traveling companions
get their monthly visit a little
early.

should apologize to half of the reading
public: If you've ever menstruated (and if

you've done it once, chances are you've
done it a couple of times), much of what
follows will be as familiar and interesting
as cramps.
Nonetheless, in the interest of gender

equality, next week's column will discuss
some peculiarity of male physiology:
chewing tobacco, farting or urinating
while standing up.
As it turns out, any one of a plethora
of factors can knock one of the fairer sex
off her usual monthly cycle: stress, insuf
ficient caloric intake, excessive exercise,
travel, et al. It is these last two ("travel"
and "al.") which are most relevant to the
issue at hand.
Amenorrhea (fake Greek for "not
menstruating") frequently occurs in
women when they travel. In some cases,
even the anticipation of travel (and the
associated anxieties, like how to fit ten
pairs of shoes, twenty pairs of jeans and
all that hair stuff into one bag) can delay
a perfectly healthy woman's period.

If your friend's period started late, and
resumed normal cycling after her travel
ing was over, I would guess that the trav
el itself was responsible for the deviation.
Airplane travel has so many more anxi
eties associated with it than other sorts of
locomotion (fear
of a fiery, sudden death topping the list)
that even if your friend doesn't become
amenorrheic contemplating a long drive,
flying might have caused her to reset her
biological clock as well as her wristwatch.
If, on the other hand, her period com
menced earlier than expected, travel anx
iety probably doesn't explain the prob
lem. This brings us to the second relevant
factor mentioned previously: al., or alii
— literally, "others." As every woman
who's ever lived in a dorm can tell you,

females living in close proximity to other
females undergo changes in their cycles
that result in synchronization of their
menstrual periods.
Menstrual synchrony was first docu
mented in 1964, when a pack of
researchers without enough to do
descended on a college dormitory with a
ream of invasive questionnaires. The
dorm contained 135 girls (hey, lay off, it
was 1964) between the ages of 17 and 22,
all of whom (with one exception, appar
ently) lived in Stern-style, single-room
doubles. The researchers asked their sub
jects a battery of personal questions
regarding their friends, social practices
and menstrual periods.


The Science Bug
No significant menstrual syn
chrony was observed on the dorm
level. However, a high degree of
uniformity in the day menstrua
tion began was observed for sub
jects who were either roommates
or close friends. The key variable
seemed to be the amount of time
the subjects spent near one anoth
er.
Presumably, since women can't
just ring each other up and plan to
menstruate on the same day,
some biological factor was respon
sible for this well-documented
synchrony. Pheromones were sug
gested as a possible mechanism,
but evidence was scanty.
A pheromone is sort of a mobile
hormone: one organism exudes it

and another nearby member of
the same species experiences
physiological consequences.
Insects are known to use
pheromones for mate-finding, but
until the study I'm about to
describe was published, no one
knew for certain that pheromones
might influence human sexual
behavior.
To test the pheromone hypoth
esis, researchers rubbed auxiliary
secretions (translation: "armpit
sweat") from a single woman on
the upper lip of experimental sub
jects (yum), and observed the
effects on menstruation. This
treatment shifted the mean differ
ence in day of onset of menses
from 9.3 days (in a control group)
to 3.4 days after four months of
treatment.
Even though the subjects expe
rienced no personal contact with
the donor of the "perfume," they

still exhibited menstrual syn
chrony — a sure sign that some
element of a cycling woman's
sweat has the power to affect
other women's periods.
In a crowded environment like
the inside of an airplane, the
effects of proximity might be
accelerated. I know women who
have locked entire halls of Bran
ner into their cycle. Put one of
these dominant "alpha" females
on board a trans-Atlantic flight
(with nothing to breathe but recir
culated air) and I bet more than a
few of their traveling companions
get their monthly visit a little
early.
