## Baseball gets past Pacific thanks to standout frosh Van Wagenen hits grand slam homer in 6-4 win 
### Brian Egan Staff Writer 
Youth continues to spring
eternal for the Cardinal baseball
squad.
Led by freshmen Dan Reed
and Brodie Van Wagenen, Stan
ford (4-2 on the season) bounced
back yesterday from a tough
weekend road series by defeating
a surprisingly competitive Uni
versity of the Pacific team, 6-4, at
Sunken Diamond.
Reed, a left-handed pitcher,
looked like a veteran in making
his first start on the mound for
the Cardinal, allowing no runs
and only three hits in five
innings of work.
"Dan's performance was the
most positive part of the day,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "He had good control and
spotted his pitches well."
Reed agreed with his coach. "I
felt good, and I was excited about
getting the start," he said. "I had
some movement on my pitches,
and kept my fastball low."
Stanford scored single runs

with help from Tiger starter
Mike Rios in the first and third to
take an early 2-0 lead. Rios,
plagued by control problems in
his first two outings, persisted in
his wild ways yesterday.
In the first, Cale Cater singled
to lead off the inning. Rios then
hit Todd Laßocca and walked Jed
Hansen to load the bases. Carter
scored on a sacrifice fly from the
bat of Dusty Allen.
Rios continued with his gen
erosity in the third. Rich Crowe
walked and stole second. A Rios
wild pitch advanced Crowe to
third. After Carter flew out to left,
Rios walked Laßocca. With
Laßocca running, Hansen singled
to deep shortstop, driving in
Crowe.
In the sixth, the Cardinal
stretched its lead to 6-0. Dusty
Allen and Brian Dallimore sin
gled, and Jason Sugarman was
plunked on the back with a pitch.
Batting with the bases loaded,
Van Wagenen sent a Bob
Rinderknecht fastball over the
left field fence, picking up the
first home run of his Stanford

career.
The game carried special sig
nificance for Van Wagenen. Not
only is the freshman battling for
the starting spot in right field,
but he was also shaken up by the
death of Stanford catcher A.J.
Hinch's father on Monday
evening.
"I kind of dedicated the game
to A.J.," said VanWagenen, who
is Hinch's road roommate. "I got
the big hit at the right time."
Pacific, who dropped to 4-4 on
the year, made the game interest
ing in the late innings. The
Tigers picked up pairs of runs in
the seventh and eighth frames
against Stanford right-handers
Matt Marenghi and Willie
Adams. Both rallies were kept
alive by Cardinal errors, and
Stanford committed a total of
five miscues in the game.
"We just went to sleep a little
bit," said VanWagenen. "We got
a little careless on defense, and
that hurt us in the end."
"If anything bothered me
about the game, it was our sloppy
defense," Marquess said. "With

the teams we have ahead on our
schedule, we can't keep on play
ing like that in the field."
Card Notes
With his eighth-inning single,
designated hitter Steve Carter
has hit safely in the last five
games.
