# Men's hoops focuses on last half of season
## 
### David Schwartz Senior Staff Writer 
At the midpoint of the Pacific 10 Conference
basketball season, Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery has re-evaluated his team's goals.
The loss of three key players to injury before
league play began — Jason Weaver, Andy Pop
pink and David Harbour — and the injuries
throughout to many others — Jim Morgan,
Darren Allaway and Todd Manley — left Mont
gomery more in search of an ambulance than a
starting lineup. As a result, the second half of
the schedule will be focused on team improve
ment rather than postseason play, which has
been the customary target for Stanford in
recent years.
"We're not going to have a great season,"
Montgomery said. "We can't look at these last
nine games and say 'if we win this amount, we'll
go to the NCAA (Tournament).' Instead, we
have to focus more on shoring up fundamentals
and making the rest of the season a positive
experience.
"We almost have to look at these next nine
games as a separate season, and try to make the
most of it."

The first chance to begin anew will come Sun
day, when Stanford (6-15, 1-8 Pac-10) plays host
to archrival California (10-7,4-5) in Maples Pavil
ion. In their last meeting, at Harmon Gym in
Berkeley one month ago, the Cardinal suffered an
83-66 defeat to the Golden Bears. In that game,
Cal forwards Lamond Murray and Alfred Grigsby
scored 24 and 19 points, respectively, while guard
Dion Cross led the Cardinal with 17 points.
The Golden Bears will also have a new begin
ning of sorts, as interim coach Todd Bozeman
will'guide Cal in his first Pac-10 game since
replacing Lou Campanelli, who was fired on
Monday. But the fact that Cal will have a new
face on its bench "WiU "flbt affect
preparation.
"I don't think they'll make any wholesale
changes," Montgomery said. "They're going to be
excited for our game, regardless. They may be
more open in their play — there was some con
cern that Lou had set things, discipline, that he
wanted to do — so they might be more freelance."
The underlying reason for Campanelli's dis
missal was player dissatisfaction with his style,
as several approached the California athletic
department and threatened to leave if Campan
elli was not removed. But the way Campanelli

was treated does not sit well with Montgomery.
"That whole issue is disturbing to me for a lot
of reasons," Montgomery said. "Lou was a pro
fessional, a person with integrity, and had a
good sense of right and wrong. This just reflects
the bottom-line mentality of W's and L's.
"It's been veiy rare for a college coach to be
dismissed in the middle of a year for wins and
losses — that's a pro thing. I don't think I've
seen that in college before. If you can't depend
on support from your administration, then
you're really out on a pole."
Will Cal's abrupt coaching change help the
squad reach the NCAA Tournament?
t-ro coaching is overrated," Montgomery
said. "Most of what your team does right or
wrong is based on a foundation. Anything that
Cal is or will be will be based on what Lou Cam
panelli has taught for the past two to three
months."
As for Stanford, the players need to start
applying the lessons they have been given.
"A lot of what we have to do is psychological,"
Montgomery said. "We took some tape of the
Arizona game to show the players some of the
things that were not getting done that they are
capable of doing."
