# Tennis looks strong against San Jose State

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's men's tennis victo
ry was a tribute to the team's
depth. Although the first singles
and first doubles players lost,
every other member of the Cardi
nal squad won in straight sets to
defeat San Jose State, 6-1.
"Our depth this year is very,
very good," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. With several
players nursing minor injuries,
Gould had the flexibility to put
some players in singles and others
in doubles, and still win the
match easily.
Under the new match format,
the three doubles matches are
played first, and only count for
one team point altogether. Each
of these is played in an eight-game
proset form, so that they take less
time.
Stanford's second doubles
team of Vimal Patel and Jim
Thomas easily defeated Ryan
Edwards and Ryan Marasigan, 8-
3, while Billy Wright and Roman
Sydorak put away Yuval Bauman
and Graham Kimura by an identi
cal score.
"The two and three (teams) did

a great job for us," Gould said.
"They all worked the points really
well."
The top doubles team, Michael
Flanagan and Chris Cocotos, did
not fare as well. They were
trounced by Brandon Coupe and
Derek Del Rosario, 2-8. Sluggish
court coverage and poor execution
prompted Gould to call it a "hor
rendous" match.
The combination of Coupe's
versatility and Flanagan's careless
errors led to a Cardinal loss at first
singles as well. After losing eight of
the first nine games, Flanagan ral
lied and almost split sets with the
tough Spartan, but fell behind 0-6
in the second set tiebreaker.
Coupe, who defeated Stanford's
NCAA Champion Alex O'Brien in
last year's dual match, gave up
three points to Flanagan before
sealing the match, 6-1, 7-6 (3).
At second singles, Cocotos
routed Edwards, 6-4, 6-4. Heavy
conditioning workouts took their
toll, as Cocotos played from the
backcourt and rarely came in to
the net.
"Chris did what he had to do to
win, but he almost put himself to

sleep in the process," Gould noted.
Patel's performance at third sin
gles, however, was outstanding.
"The difference was like night and
day," Gould said, in reference to
Patel's loss against San Diego two
weeks ago. Effective execution and
smart shot selection led the Cardi
nal junior to a 6-2, 6-3 win over Del
Rosario.
Stanford's fourth singles victory
came from freshman Jeff Salzen
stein, who has not played a team

match in almost a month. After
ironing out the kinks in the first set,
Salzenstein came out aggressively
in the second to defeat Marasigan 6-
4,6-0.
In the fifth slot, team captain
and lone senior Roman Sydorak
matched his doubles win with a 6-1,
6-4 routing of Bauman.
"Roman is playing really well,"
said assistant coach John Whitlinger.
"He almost let the guy in during the
second, but he was able to hang on."
The Cardinal's final victory
came courtesy of No. 6 Billy Wright,
who put in his second solid perfor
mance of the day to defeat Damon
Coupe, 6-3, 6-2.
