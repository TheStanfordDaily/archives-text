## 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff Writer 
Domination. The teams that faced the Stanford
varsity fencing squad this past weekend know
exactly what this term means.
The Cardinal traveled to Pasadena, where Cal
Tech hosted the last regular season fencing meet of
the year on Feb. 5 and 6. Both the men and women
returned undefeated, earning overall records of 12-
3 and 11-4.
The meet began on Friday when Stanford met
Cal State-Fullerton, giving the Titans the neces
sary number of matches to qualify for NCAA post
season competition. Both the men and women won
easily, with scores of 21-6 and 15-1, respectively.
Two non-starters, sophomores Michelle Butler and
Kelly Pun, fenced competitively for only the second
time this season.

"I was really excited," Pun said. "I lost a few
matches I should have won. It was a good experi
ence and made me more excited about the whole
sport. I was really nervous, but at the same time I
was eager to contribute to the team."
Posthumus explained that both women did
indeed contribute, as they fenced again versus
Long Beach State on Saturday.
"I probably could have left them in all day,"
Posthumus said. "They have worked so hard this
year. They have made remarkable progress."
On the men's side, Nick Bravin, Olympian and
two-time NCAA foil champion, turned in an 18-0
record as the Cardinal's No. 1 foil man, with only four
out of a possible 90 touches registered against him.
Ed Jen, the No. 3 sabre man, lost only three
bouts the entire weekend, surpassing the team's
No. 1 and No. 2 sabre men.
"I was psyched up for this competition," Jen

said. "I tried to maintain a positive attitude
throughout."
All of the individual achievement added up to
decisive victories for the Cardinal. The men beat
Fullerton a second time 24-3, Long Beach 18-9,
UC-San Diego 19-8, Cal Tech 14-13 and UC-Santa
Cruz 20-7 on Saturday. The women crushed
Fullerton and Cal Tech 16-0, Long Beach and San
Diego 13-3 and UC-Santa Cruz 11-5.
"We dominated Santa Cruz, which was a very
good surprise," Posthumus said. "This time there
was no feeling that we were ever in trouble."
The only surprise for the men was an 8-1 loss in
sabre against Cal Tech. In order to qualify for
NCAA postseason competition, the men must beat
Cal Tech at Western Regionals.
"They (Stanford's sabre team) were under too
much pressure from not having
Keith Early," explained men's
head coach Zoran Tulum, refer
ring to the loss of their No. 1 sabre
man to academic ineligibility. "We
didn't want it as badly as Cal Tech
did."
Both the men's and women's
teams are looking forward to the
NCAA Western Regional Champi
onships. The two-day tournament
will be hosted by UC-Santa Cruz
and will be held March 6 and 7.
