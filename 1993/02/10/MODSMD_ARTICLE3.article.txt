# Tuition to rise 7.5% next year
## Trustees abandon pledge to keep costs down; OK $1,460 increase 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
The annual cost of Stanford ed
ucation will increase by $1,460
next year, thanks to a Board of
Trustees decision yesterday to
hike tuition and room and board
charges by a total of 6.4 percent.
By approving a 7.5 percent tu
ition increase for undergraduates
and general graduate students,
the board for the second year in a
row abandoned a pledge to hold
down tuition costs.
The overall bill for attending
Stanford will average $24,310 for
the next school year, with tuition
at $17,775 and room and board
rising 3.5 percent to $6, 535.
"I'm not saying that is good
news — 7.5 percent is a pretty
steep increase — but last year we
worried that it would have to be
9.5 percent," University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper said.
"We will make every effort to
make sure the tuition increase is
reflected in financial aid pack
ages," he said, adding that an
extra $600,000 will be allotted to
the Financial Aids Office to defray
additional costs.
The trustees also approved rate
hikes for the graduate schools:
• 8.8 percent for the Law
School;
• 7.5 percent for the School of
Engineering;
• 5.5 percent for the School of
Medicine; and
• 5 percent for the Graduate
School of Business.
Casper said the increase was
clearly dictated by financial and
budgetary considerations.
But because the University has
saved more than expected in its
two-year $43 million deficit reduc
tion campaign, he said, the 9.5
percent tuition hike for 1992-93
did not have to be repeated.
"We worked very hard at achiev
ing savings and indeed we have,"
Casper said. "We are warily opti
mistic."
Tuition provides about half of
Stanford's operating budget,
which pays for most faculty
salaries, libraries, student ser
vices, administrative staff and fa
cilities costs.

I'm not saying that
is good news —
7.5 percent is a pretty
steep increase -- but
last year we worried
that it would have to
be 9.5 percent.'

Three years ago, the trustees
adopted a policy of not raising the
cost of attending Stanford by more
than 1 percent over inflation. That
pledge kept the 1989-90 and 1991-
92 increases to 5.2 and 5.8 per
cent, respectively.
Inflation has been running
about 3 percent, according Uni
versity Budget Director Tim
Warner. If Stanford had stuck to
its promise, costs would have in
creased by only around 4 percent.
No more ceiling
During the trustees' meetings
there was no commitment to either
large or small increases in the fu
ture, according to student repre
sentative Jason Snyder, a junior.
"Obviously, there's no more infla
tion plus 1 percent cap any longer."
Casper agreed. There are "still
too many uncertainties" in terms
of the University's budget and fed
eral support to make any promis
es, he said. "I do not think that
Stanford can make a commitment
now or in the near future to a for
mula."
"Sticker shock" could deter
students from applying to Stan
ford, warned Snyder, who said he
opposed the increase. "We want to
keep the quality and diversity of
our student body."
But the trustees did not just
"rubber stamp" the price hike,
said Snyder, who attends board
meetings, but does not have a
vote. "We did have discussions
centering around the negative ef
fects."
"It's the easiest way to lower
