# Tuition to rise 7.5% next year
## Trustees abandon pledge to keep costs down; OK $1,460 increase 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
The annual cost of Stanford ed
ucation will increase by $1,460
next year, thanks to a Board of
Trustees decision yesterday to
hike tuition and room and board
charges by a total of 6.4 percent.
By approving a 7.5 percent tu
ition increase for undergraduates
and general graduate students,
the board for the second year in a
row abandoned a pledge to hold
down tuition costs.
The overall bill for attending
Stanford will average $24,310 for
the next school year, with tuition
at $17,775 and room and board
rising 3.5 percent to $6, 535.
"I'm not saying that is good
news — 7.5 percent is a pretty
steep increase — but last year we
worried that it would have to be
9.5 percent," University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper said.
"We will make every effort to
make sure the tuition increase is
reflected in financial aid pack
ages," he said, adding that an
extra $600,000 will be allotted to
the Financial Aids Office to defray
additional costs.
The trustees also approved rate
hikes for the graduate schools:
• 8.8 percent for the Law
School;
• 7.5 percent for the School of
Engineering;
• 5.5 percent for the School of
Medicine; and
• 5 percent for the Graduate
School of Business.
Casper said the increase was
clearly dictated by financial and
budgetary considerations.
But because the University has
saved more than expected in its
two-year $43 million deficit reduc
tion campaign, he said, the 9.5
percent tuition hike for 1992-93
did not have to be repeated.
"We worked very hard at achiev
ing savings and indeed we have,"
Casper said. "We are warily opti
mistic."
Tuition provides about half of
Stanford's operating budget,
which pays for most faculty
salaries, libraries, student ser
vices, administrative staff and fa
cilities costs.

7.5 percent is a pretty
steep increase -- but

that it would have to
be 9.5 percent.'

Three years ago, the trustees
adopted a policy of not raising the
cost of attending Stanford by more
than 1 percent over inflation. That
pledge kept the 1989-90 and 1991-
92 increases to 5.2 and 5.8 per
cent, respectively.
Inflation has been running
about 3 percent, according Uni
versity Budget Director Tim
Warner. If Stanford had stuck to
its promise, costs would have in
creased by only around 4 percent.
No more ceiling
During the trustees' meetings
there was no commitment to either
large or small increases in the fu
ture, according to student repre
sentative Jason Snyder, a junior.
"Obviously, there's no more infla
tion plus 1 percent cap any longer."
Casper agreed. There are "still
too many uncertainties" in terms
of the University's budget and fed
eral support to make any promis
es, he said. "I do not think that
Stanford can make a commitment
now or in the near future to a for
mula."
"Sticker shock" could deter
students from applying to Stan
ford, warned Snyder, who said he
opposed the increase. "We want to
keep the quality and diversity of
our student body."
But the trustees did not just
"rubber stamp" the price hike,
said Snyder, who attends board
meetings, but does not have a
vote. "We did have discussions
centering around the negative ef
fects."
"It's the easiest way to lower
the budget deficit. That doesn't
mean it's the appropriate way or
the best way," he said, adding
that he tried to emphasize that
increases are not "something [the
board] should get comfortable
with."
Stanford's fees this year are
just about average compared to
those of other private colleges and
universities, according to the
annual Cambridge Associates
report. Stanford tied for the 48th
highest cost of the 111 universi
ties surveyed.
The report also found that
Stanford's average tuition increase
over the past five years was lower

than that of ail but 11 schools.
"Our main competitors ... are all
considerably more expensive than
Stanford," Casper said. "Stanford
is, comparatively speaking, a
rather good buy."
Of Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Brown and Columbia Universities,
only Princeton has announced its
increase for next year. With a 5.9
overall hike, their total cost will be
$24,650.
All five schools were more
expensive than Stanford this
year, but Princeton was closest at
$417 more than Stanford's total
cost of $22,850.
Cost remains competitive
"I think it will be somewhat
harder for those who receive more
financial aid," Casper said. But
"given the tremendous quality of

Stanford," he said
the University
remains competi
tive with other
schools.
Dean of Under
graduate Admis
sions James Mon
toya said he is not
surprised by the
hike. "I anticipate
that it will be in

line with the increase we see at
other institutions to which our
applicants are applying," he said.
"We're always concerned about
affordability," said Financial Aids
Office Director Robert Huff, but
he pointed out that yesterday's
increase was not as large as the
one a year ago. "You could look at
it as 2 percent less."
He expects the University to

once again increase his office's
resources to make up for the cost
hike, Huff said.
This year Financial Aids also
received an additional $600,000
to reduce the student self-help
level.
Casper said there will be no
change in the University's com
mitment to funding financial aid
and maintaining need-blind
admissions.
Michelle Mello, chair of the
ASSU's Financial Aid Advocacy
Office, said the price hike is "not
as bad as it could have been,"
since the University is under so
much budget pressure.
It is important that there be
financial aid to close the gap
between skyrocketing tuition and
family income, which is not rising
as fast, Mello said.

In some ways I'd
rather see a tuition
hike for everyone
than to see financial
aid cut for the
neediest students. 1

cant burden" on students, Brown
said. "I think that the last tuition
increases have been large. A
return to the (inflation plus 1 per
cent) policy would not be too
much to ask."
While Casper is not overly con
cerned that students will stop
choosing Stanford because of its
cost, he said "incremental
increases" can't continue forever.
"I do think for the long run we
clearly have to rethink rather rad
ically the cost of undergraduate
education," he said. "While main
taining the quality of undergradu
ate education, we now have to
start streamlining."

hikes for the graduate schools:
• 8.8 percent for the Law
School;
• 7.5 percent for the School of
Engineering;
• 5.5 percent for the School of
Medicine; and
• 5 percent for the Graduate
School of Business.
Casper said the increase was
clearly dictated by financial and
budgetary considerations.
But because the University has
saved more than expected in its
two-year $43 million deficit reduc
tion campaign, he said, the 9.5
percent tuition hike for 1992-93
did not have to be repeated.
"We worked very hard at achiev
ing savings and indeed we have,"
Casper said. "We are warily opti
mistic."
Tuition provides about half of
Stanford's operating budget,
which pays for most faculty
salaries, libraries, student ser
vices, administrative staff and fa
cilities costs.

I'm not saying that
is good news —
7.5 percent is a pretty
steep increase -- but
last year we worried
that it would have to
be 9.5 percent.'
— Gerhard Casper

Three years ago, the trustees
adopted a policy of not raising the
cost of attending Stanford by more
than 1 percent over inflation. That
pledge kept the 1989-90 and 1991-
92 increases to 5.2 and 5.8 per
cent, respectively.
Inflation has been running
about 3 percent, according Uni
versity Budget Director Tim
Warner. If Stanford had stuck to
its promise, costs would have in
creased by only around 4 percent.
No more ceiling
During the trustees' meetings
there was no commitment to either
large or small increases in the fu
ture, according to student repre
sentative Jason Snyder, a junior.
"Obviously, there's no more infla
tion plus 1 percent cap any longer."
Casper agreed. There are "still
too many uncertainties" in terms
of the University's budget and fed
eral support to make any promis
es, he said. "I do not think that
Stanford can make a commitment
now or in the near future to a for
mula."
"Sticker shock" could deter
students from applying to Stan
ford, warned Snyder, who said he
opposed the increase. "We want to
keep the quality and diversity of
our student body."
But the trustees did not just
"rubber stamp" the price hike,
said Snyder, who attends board
meetings, but does not have a
vote. "We did have discussions
centering around the negative ef
fects."
"It's the easiest way to lower
the budget deficit. That doesn't
mean it's the appropriate way or
the best way," he said, adding
that he tried to emphasize that
increases are not "something [the
board] should get comfortable
with."
Stanford's fees this year are
just about average compared to
those of other private colleges and
universities, according to the
annual Cambridge Associates
report. Stanford tied for the 48th
highest cost of the 111 universi
ties surveyed.
The report also found that
Stanford's average tuition increase
over the past five years was lower

than that of ail but 11 schools.
"Our main competitors ... are all
considerably more expensive than
Stanford," Casper said. "Stanford
is, comparatively speaking, a
rather good buy."
Of Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Brown and Columbia Universities,
only Princeton has announced its
increase for next year. With a 5.9
overall hike, their total cost will be
$24,650.
All five schools were more
expensive than Stanford this
year, but Princeton was closest at
$417 more than Stanford's total
cost of $22,850.
Cost remains competitive
"I think it will be somewhat
harder for those who receive more
financial aid," Casper said. But
"given the tremendous quality of

Stanford," he said
the University
remains competi
tive with other
schools.
Dean of Under
graduate Admis
sions James Mon
toya said he is not
surprised by the
hike. "I anticipate
that it will be in

line with the increase we see at
other institutions to which our
applicants are applying," he said.
"We're always concerned about
affordability," said Financial Aids
Office Director Robert Huff, but
he pointed out that yesterday's
increase was not as large as the
one a year ago. "You could look at
it as 2 percent less."
He expects the University to

once again increase his office's
resources to make up for the cost
hike, Huff said.
This year Financial Aids also
received an additional $600,000
to reduce the student self-help
level.
Casper said there will be no
change in the University's com
mitment to funding financial aid
and maintaining need-blind
admissions.
Michelle Mello, chair of the
ASSU's Financial Aid Advocacy
Office, said the price hike is "not
as bad as it could have been,"
since the University is under so
much budget pressure.
It is important that there be
financial aid to close the gap
between skyrocketing tuition and
family income, which is not rising
as fast, Mello said.

In some ways I'd
rather see a tuition
hike for everyone
than to see financial
aid cut for the
neediest students. 1

"In some ways I'd rather see a

ASSU Senate Chair Ron
Brown echoed Mello's concerns
about financial aid and need-blind

admissions. M I don't imagine a lot
of students will be pleased that
they'll be paying more next year,"
he said.
Increasing tuition is a "signifi
cant burden" on students, Brown
said. "I think that the last tuition
increases have been large. A
return to the (inflation plus 1 per
cent) policy would not be too
much to ask."
While Casper is not overly con
cerned that students will stop
choosing Stanford because of its
cost, he said "incremental
increases" can't continue forever.
"I do think for the long run we
clearly have to rethink rather rad
ically the cost of undergraduate
education," he said. "While main
taining the quality of undergradu
ate education, we now have to
start streamlining."

The annual cost of Stanford ed
ucation will increase by $1,460
next year, thanks to a Board of
Trustees decision yesterday to
hike tuition and room and board
charges by a total of 6.4 percent.
By approving a 7.5 percent tu
ition increase for undergraduates
and general graduate students,
the board for the second year in a
row abandoned a pledge to hold
down tuition costs.
The overall bill for attending
Stanford will average $24,310 for
the next school year, with tuition
at $17,775 and room and board
rising 3.5 percent to $6, 535.
"I'm not saying that is good
news — 7.5 percent is a pretty
steep increase — but last year we
worried that it would have to be
9.5 percent," University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper said.
"We will make every effort to
make sure the tuition increase is
reflected in financial aid pack
ages," he said, adding that an
extra $600,000 will be allotted to
the Financial Aids Office to defray
additional costs.
The trustees also approved rate
hikes for the graduate schools:
