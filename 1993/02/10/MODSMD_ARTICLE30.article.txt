# Sports fans take heart: all is not lost Feb. 14
## 
### 
Wfell, it's almost here. The
day that Stanford students
dread. A day when people
the world over are scoring, but peo
ple on the Farm are pitching
shutouts. Rapid depression sinks in,
as you realize that the only one-on
one you'll be playing is a game of
hoops with your roommate. Cupid's
arrow has not touched your heart,
but rather stabbed it. Oh the hor
ror, the misery, of Valentine's Day.»
But wait, don't despair. There is
something for you to do on Sunday.
And it's right on campus in Maples
Pavilion.
At 12:45 p.m., the Stanford
men's basketball team plays host to
California. In terms of hostility,
there is none finer than when these
two get together.
The cross-Bay hoops matchup is
perfect for a February 14.
One team will be wearing Cardi
nal — which is close to the red that
you see on all of those Valentine's
cards.
The other will be wearing blues,
which is what you've got since you
don't have a date.
So, your task is simple — you
want to beat the blues, and so does
the basketball team. Why not join
forces?
For the guys, pretend Cal is your
ex-girlfriend and take out your frus
trations on Lou Campanelli. Wait,
Lou's not there! Well fine, now
there's Bozeman, although "Sit
Down Todd" just doesn't have the
same ring to it. "Give 'em the Axe,"
I say. Prove you are men by heck
ling a mere Kidd.
For the ladies, it's even better, as
you can take man-hating to the hilt
with a chant of "Beat the Weenies."
And all together, think about
how nice it would have been to have
given or received a cute little Valen
tine's Day teddy bear. But since you
didn't, tear him up! Vent your anger
at Oski. Root for the Tree to stab
the Golden Bear in the back with a

branch.
Big deal if you're single on Valen
tine's Day. Being in the stands
could be a great opportunity to
change that. During the game, just
turn to someone you think is good
looking and ask, "Was that Lamond
Murray or Alfred Grigsby on that
last dunk?" Next thing you know,

you'll have something to do for that
Sunday night.
So you're in a slump, are you? So
is the basketball team. The cagers
haven't won a game in a month, and
if you're going to a basketball game
on the Day of Love, you probably
haven't had a date in a month — at
least. I think it's time for the trend
to be broken. On Sunday, each enti
ty must start a streak in the other
direction.
But the turnaround can only be
achieved if the basketball team has
the full support of the student body
— and I mean that figuratively, not
literally. At Stanford, we shouldn't
have to resort to taking off our
clothes in public like The Naked
Guy to gain attention. Mere cheer
ing will suffice, but it should be
loud. Yell for the underdog; give the
Cardinal a true home-court advan
tage.
We cannot allow Bozeman to win
this weekend. It's only his second
outing with the Cal team, and it just
wouldn't be right for him to be suc
cessful that early. He might get a fat
head.
