When you go to Stanford Ten
nis Stadium tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. to watch the women's tennis
team take on Washington State,
don't be surprised if they're not
the Cardinal you used to know.
Stanford, plagued by illness
and injuries to some of its top
players during the past week,
will sport a younger look against
the Cougars tomorrow, as Laxmi
Poruri (leg injury), Heather Wil
lens (groin pull), Kim Shasby
(knee injury) and Kristine Kurth
(bronchitis) rest up for this
weekend's matches. As a result,
freshman Beth Berris will move
up to the No. 1 spot for the Car
dinal.
"She's proved she's a quality
player," said Cardinal assistant
coach Lele Forood. "Hopefully
she'll take that with her into the
match."
Filling in at the No. 2 position

will be sophomore Amy
Chiminello, followed by junior
Emma Woodhouse at No. 3,
freshman Wendy Sacks at No. 4,
senior Mario Carruth at No. 5
and freshman Sonya Cotero at
No. 6.
Shasby will be limited to dou
bles action today, pairing with
Chiminello in the No. 1 doubles
position. Woodhouse and Berris
will play No. 2, while Sacks and
Carruth will fill the No. 3 slot.
"I'm feeling everything right
now — really excited, but really
nervous too," Berris said of her
No. 1 position. "There's going to
be a lot of pressure, but I'm not
anticipating it will get to me."
As for the "mystique" of play
ing on the Stadium's center
court, Berris hopes to take it all
in stride.
"It'll be a good experience for
me," Berris said. "I'm really look
ing forward to playing on center
court. Hopefully I'll feel at home
there."
