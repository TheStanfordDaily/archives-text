# Speaker probes emphasis on male mindset in Catholicism
## Church in 'crisis'? 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Addressing the issue of a patriarchal mindset in
the Roman Catholic Church last night at Memorial
Church, Dr. Rosemary Rader, a past Stanford gradu
ate and Benedictine nun, expressed the importance
of creating a language in religion that includes both
the experiences of men and women.
"We're experimenting in creating a language that
more adequately describes the experiences of
women" in the Catholic Church, Rader said to an au
dience of about 200.
Rader's lecture, "American Catholic Women and
the Crisis of Transition," explored the historical per
spective of the male dominated mindset, a lack of
recognition of Catholic women's experiences and the
issue of ordained women priests in the Church.
Rader demonstrated that women's language and
experiences are missing from Catholicism, citing a
line from the Apostles' Creed — a prayer that is said
during each Catholic mass — "Jesus died for us men
and our salvation."
"Research by women like myself encourages oth
ers to work to change the system defined by male
leadership, male language and male experiences,"
Rader said.
The impact of "not being addressed when one is a
member of the community does have a powerful and
negative effect," Rader said.
On one end of the gradual transition to defining a
woman's role in Catholicism are the women that be
lieve "nothing should change because in their view,
that would be tampering with the church as Christ
founded it," she said.
On the opposite end, she continued, are women
who see "no future in a patriarchal system." Caught
in the middle "are a vast range of
women who survive with the
technique that 'this too shall
pass.' "
To find a place for themselves,
some women have formed their
own worship services, claiming it
is the only way for them to be
incorporated into the Catholic
Church, Rader said. These small
er pockets of spirituality further

divide the church into having a
patriarchal and matriarchal
mindset, when the mission, she
emphasized, should be to unite
the two parts.
When asked by an audience
member during a question and
answer session for practical
advice on incorporating women
into individual parishes, Rader
replied, "Don't give up."
"What began as woman's con
cerns . . . and about their lack of
input into the decision-making
process.. . gradually led to a part
nership that cut across denomina

tional lines to achieve liberty and
freedom for all," she said.
Rader's talk was the annual
Kurt Reinhardt Lecture, original
ly started in 1985 and sponsored
by the Catholic Community at
Stanford.
"What we try to do is to bring a
topic that is of current interest to
people in the church and commu
nity," said Nancy Greenfield, one
of the Catholic campus ministers.
"Education, awareness and
intellectual input" on a variety of
subjects is the goal of the lecture,
Greenfield added.
