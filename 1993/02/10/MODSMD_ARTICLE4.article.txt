# Speaker probes emphasis on male mindset in Catholicism
## Church in 'crisis'? 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Addressing the issue of a patriarchal mindset in
the Roman Catholic Church last night at Memorial
Church, Dr. Rosemary Rader, a past Stanford gradu
ate and Benedictine nun, expressed the importance
of creating a language in religion that includes both
the experiences of men and women.
"We're experimenting in creating a language that
more adequately describes the experiences of
women" in the Catholic Church, Rader said to an au
dience of about 200.
Rader's lecture, "American Catholic Women and
the Crisis of Transition," explored the historical per
spective of the male dominated mindset, a lack of
recognition of Catholic women's experiences and the
issue of ordained women priests in the Church.
Rader demonstrated that women's language and
experiences are missing from Catholicism, citing a
line from the Apostles' Creed — a prayer that is said
during each Catholic mass — "Jesus died for us men
and our salvation."
"Research by women like myself encourages oth
ers to work to change the system defined by male
leadership, male language and male experiences,"
Rader said.
The impact of "not being addressed when one is a
member of the community does have a powerful and
negative effect," Rader said.
On one end of the gradual transition to defining a
woman's role in Catholicism are the women that be
lieve "nothing should change because in their view,
that would be tampering with the church as Christ
founded it," she said.
On the opposite end, she continued, are women
who see "no future in a patriarchal system." Caught
