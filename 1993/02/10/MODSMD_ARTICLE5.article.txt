# Art museum slow to recover from earthquake
## $12 of $21 million needed for repair and modernization raised, expected to open in '96 
### Jack Chu 
While Memorial Church and several
other campus buildings have reopened
in the past year after extensive post
earthquake reconstruction, renova
tions in Stanford's Museum of Art are
still in the early planning stages.
One of the many campus casualties
of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,
the museum remains closed due to ex
tensive structural damages, and it is
expected to remain so for at least an
other three years.
According to museum director
Thomas Seligman, there is no formal
schedule for repairs yet, but the target
date for the museum's reopening is
"around 1995-96."
Right now, Seligman said the most
damaged parts of the museum are the
brick rotundas, one of which is located
next to the Rodin Sculpture Garden.
There are also various cracks in the
walls through which sunlight from
the outside seeps in. In some cases,
the walls are actually separated from
the floors.
In addition to the repairs, there is
also a need to modernize the facilities,
such as improving the lighting and in
stalling air conditioning. Because the
museum was opened in 1894, many of
the amenities are outdated.
Seligman said the museum will
also have additional space available
for exhibitions after the renovations
are completed.

Fortunately, said Seligman, the
actual works of art suffered only
"very minor damage" and should be
easily restored to their previous con
dition.
Seligman estimates that the archi
tectural planning for the renovation
project will take one year, while the
actual construction will take two.
Seligman hopes the plans will be fi
nalized, approved by the Board of
Trustees and put into action by June.
The estimated total cost of renova
tion is $21 million. So far, the muse
um has raised $12 million through
individual contributors, Seligman
said.
Seligman had hoped the fund rais
ing would be finished by now, but, he
said with today's economic condi
tions the process has become more
difficult. However, he said the cause
has been "generously supported" by
contributors, and the fund raising
has gone well under the circum
stances.
Usually, the museum generates
contributions from individuals who
Seligman thinks might have a vested
interest in the museum's future. "Of
course, there is no true formula for
fund raising," he said.
Seligman said he is also working
with University President Gerhard
Casper on "a strategic campaign" for
further fund raising. "The presi
dent has played a significant role in
placing support for our cause," he

said, adding that the restoration of the
art museum has been labeled a "max
imum priority project" for the Univer
sity.
Currently, in areas of the museum
deemed "safe," employees are re
searching, publishing and producing
exhibitions. In addition, they are tak
ing a full inventory of over 30,000 ob

jects and putting it into a computer
database.
Tours of the museum are still being
conducted — even in damaged areas
— but only on a private basis for those
who have expressed interest in learn
ing more about the museum and help
ing the museum in the process of
restoration.
