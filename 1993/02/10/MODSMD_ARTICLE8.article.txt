Dutch pass euthanasia law
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -
The Netherlands adopted the most liber
al euthanasia guidelines in Europe yes
terday after years of keeping the widely
accepted practice in legal limbo.
Although the legislation approved by
parliament stops short of legalization, it
guarantees physicians immunity from
prosecution if they follow strict guide
lines for mercy killing.
The compromise was an attempt to
placate right-to-lifers opposed to repeal
ing the ban on euthanasia entirely, while
giving legal protection to physicians per
forming the thousands of mercy killings
believed to occur yearly.
The guidelines specify that euthana
sia can be applied only to a patient suf
fering a "perpetual, unbearable and
hopeless" condition who requests it
repeatedly and while lucid. The patient
need not be terminally ill.
