WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton ordered cuts in the White House
staff, salaries and privileges yesterday,
saying he could not ask Americans to
make economic sacrifices unless govern
ment shares the pain.
"The government must do more and
make do with less," Clinton said,
announcing a reduction of 350 full-time
and part-time workers and employees
borrowed from other agencies.
Clinton's announcement was part of
the process of preparing Americans to
dig deeper into their pockets for higher
taxes to shrink the huge federal deficit
and pay for highway and bridge con
struction and other projects. Another
warm-up step will be a televised town
meeting today in Detroit.
The president will announce his pro
gram Feb. 17 in an address to Congress.
The slimmed-down White House staff
will total 1,044, when fully effective on
Oct. 1. White House chief of staff Thomas
McLarty said the cuts would save $10 mil

lion. Sixty years ago, when Franklin D.
Roosevelt was inaugurated, the White
House had fewer than 50 staffers.
"Economic renewal will require
tough choices from every American,"
the president said. "But we have to ask
the most of those who got the most and
gave the least during the last decade â€”
those at the top of the ladder and those
who have the levers of government.
"We in government cannot ask the
American people to change if we will not
have to do the same," Clinton said.
Asked if he, personally, was giving up
any pay or privileges, Clinton said, "I
gave up 350 staff members, which is a
remarkable accomplishment." Seventy
of the 350 were temporarily detailed to
the White House from other agencies.
Today, Clinton is to announce steps
to reduce the size of the entire govern
ment. He has promised to cut 100,000
federal jobs through attrition and
require federal agencies to trim adminis
trative costs 3 percent across-the-board.

Republicans dismissed Clinton's
moves as a symbolic gesture and said
the real test will be whether the White
House budget and staff grow over time.
"The real promise the American peo
ple want President Clinton to keep is
slashing in half the federal deficit in the
next four years," said Senate Republi
can Leader Bob Dole.
Clinton said the staff cuts fulfilled his
promise for a 25 percent reduction.
However, he attained the 25 percent fig
ure by exempting 800 employees in the
budget and trade offices, and by ignor
ing hundreds of military support per
sonnel detailed to the White House. Had
he included them, he would have had to
cut many more people.
The hardest-hit staff will the Office of
National Drug Control Policy. It will be
cut from 146 people in the Bush admin
istration to 25 under Clinton. Clinton's
advisers said the office had been packed
with political appointees rather than
experts in the fight against drugs.
