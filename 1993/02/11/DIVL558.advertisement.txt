IRRICK, HERRINGTON
& SUTCLIFFE
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe's Financial Services Group is
seeking highly qualified Bachelor's degree candidates of any major for
entry level professional positions as Financial Analysts in our Los
Angeles office.
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe is the nation's premier bond
counsel firm having ranked first nationally in this practice area for
each of the last six years. Our practice involves representing issurers,
investment banks and other financial institutions in connection with
both traditional and innovative bond financings including foreign
currency offerings and derivative products.
Analysts work directly with issuers of tax-exempt securities and
other industry professionals (i.e. attorneys, investment bankers, and
other consultants) in performing analyses related to certain federal tax
laws and the structuring of municipal debt offerings. Successful
candidates will gain an understanding of broadly applicable financial
concepts including present value and cash flow analyses, asset
valuation, public debt issue structuring and the workings of national
securities markets. This is a demanding professional position in which
work habits, written and oral communication skills and analytical skills
can be expected to improve appreciably.
Candidates should possess strong quantitative and analytical
skills, outstanding writing ability, creativity and a commitment to
excellence. Prior exposure to financial concepts is preferred, but not
required if aptitude and willingness to learn are evident. The ability to
work effectively with others is essential. Compensation is competitive
with bonus eligibility based on personal performance and group
profitability. More information is available at the Career Planning and
Placement Center. Cover letters and resumes (no phone calls please)
should be sent as soon as possible to:
