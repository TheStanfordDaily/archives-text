WHAT HAPPENED IN SABRA AND SHATILA —
A LETTER TO THE EDITOR
On January 26 The Daily published an article, "Jewish supporter of Palestinians discusses
formation of her views," which was a thorough and impressive recounting of issues addressed
in a talk given by Barbara Lubin, director of the Middle East Children's Alliance.
In this article it was reported that Lubin had re-evaluated her pro-Israel position
following the 1982 "massacres by Israeli soldiers in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila."
In a January 27 letter to the Daily a student pointed out that Lebanese Phalangists actually
carried out the killings. It was asserted that because Israeli soldiers were not participating
"with their own hands," the statement was "deliberately inflammatory and patently untrue."
According to Israel's own Kahan Commission, charged with investigating the massacres,
then-Defense Minister Ariel Sharon advised Israeli military officers prior to the army's
entrance into West Beirut: "Only one element, and that is the I.D.E, shall command the
forces in the area. For the operation in the camps the Phalangists should be sent in."
During the massacre of September 16-18 Israeli soldiers provided logistical support for
the Phalangists: they sealed off the camps, denied exit to all camp residents, lit the night sky
with flares, and manned lookout posts. Israeli journalist Ammon Kapeliouk wrote: "With the
help of aerial photographs provided by Israel, together they [Israeli and Phalangist military
officers) made the arrangements for entering the camps. The Israeli general confirmed to
them that his troops would provide all the help necessary 'for cleaning out the terrorists from
the camps.'"
The Kahan Commission confirmed that by the morning of September 17 Israeli soldiers
remained at their posts, and the slaughter continued until the Phalange unit left the camps
on September 18.
We believe it is important to clarify the roles of those involved. Furthermore, it is critical
that attention not be diverted from the issues raised in Lubin's talk and in the article. Israeli
human rights violations and the de facto annexation of West Bank and Gaza Strip must not
continue unchallenged.
