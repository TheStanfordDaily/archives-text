# 6-point peace plan released
## Christopher says U.N. must halt Bosnian conflict 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Clinton administration said yes
terday U.S. troops could be sent to
enforce peace in the former
Yugoslavia if warring factions can
negotiate a settlement.
Unveiling a six-point peace plan
after three weeks of study by the
new administration, Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said,
"No great power can dismiss the
likely consequences of letting a
Balkans conflict rage."
The deepening war, its threat
to neighboring nations and the
long-seated religious and cultural
hatred now aflame in the area
pose a critical test for the new
president, who will also have to
marshal world opinion behind his

position.
"Our conscience revolts" at
unending accounts of murder and
rape, Christopher said.
He denounced Serbian "ethnic
cleansing" aimed at Muslims in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and called the
crisis "an important moment for
our post-Cold War role in Europe
and the world."
President Clinton said the
American public will support the
plan. "I think they want us to do
more, but they want us to do it in a
prudent way."
The secretary of state announ
ced the possibility of using Ameri
can troops as part of an interna
tional force to enforce peace terms
if they can be reached.

Other key provisions of the
administration plan include the
appointment of Reginald Bar
tholomew, the U.S. ambassador
to NATO, to assist international
mediators forge agreement, and a
pledge to tighten the U.N. trade
embargo against Serbia and Mon
tenegro.
Christopher said President
Clinton has ruled out providing
the Muslims with U.S. weapons or
using U.S. air power to silence Ser
bian mortar fire.
On the potential use of U.S.
troops, Christopher said they
would be sent to the Balkans only
in the event of a negotiated settle
ment and only as part of a multi
national U.N. or NATO force.
