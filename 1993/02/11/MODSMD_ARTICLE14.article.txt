ASSU Senators need to
to attend meetings and
pass attendance policy

IT'S BEEN A STRANGE YEAR
for the ASSU. There's no
Council of Presidents, its bud
gets have been slashed and it has
been trying to forge relations with
a new administration. One would
think that the ASSU Senate would
be working overtime to try and
tackle these projects and compen
sate for the lack of student-govern
ment leadership.
However, the senate has been
running on reduced power. On
average, one-third of the senators
have been absent at the biweekly
meetings, and seven senators have
been absent the entire year.
That's a disgraceful statement,
considering the senate is the sole
representation of the Stanford stu
dent body as a whole. Its elected
members should respect the
importance of their position and
participate in meetings. Other
wise, they should be replaced
through an extra election.
ASSU Senate Chair Ron Brown
said there is "no very good way of
enforcing attendance." If that is
the case, then the system should
be changed.
Of the senate's 40 members,
only the top 10 undergraduate and
graduate vote-getters (from the
spring election) can vote on ASSU
bills. Therefore, there is little
incentive for the other 20 senators
to attend.
The senate should reform itself
so that all senators can vote. Ten
undergraduates is an awfully
small number to represent 6500
students, and the same statement
applies to graduate students. It is
pretty safe to say that in between
midterms, significant others and
fraternity parties, each voting sen
ator is not talking to 650 students
about issues, much less 65.
And if the senate is not up for

reforming itself, it should pass an
enforced attendance policy. Cur
rently, the senators are merely sus
pended after four meetings, leaving
their seats permanently empty. The
new policy should state that if a
senator misses a specified number
of meetings, without being excused,
that person should be removed and
an election held for the seat.
In the current system, all stu
dents who voted for absent sena
tors are not being fairly heard. The
system ineffectively represents the
student body and sends a skewed
message of what students want.
Regardless of whether the sen
ate acts upon the above recom
mendations, the seven perpetually
absent members, who have been
suspended, should be removed. It
would take little more than a vote,
and the senate should then act
promptly and hold an election for
their seats. The seats have been
absent long enough.
Considering the University is
currently undergoing an extensive
budget-cutting process, and a 7.5
percent increase in tuition was
recently announced, the student
body should feel it has a reliable,
established body to which it can
turn. Instead, in past years, Bart
Simpson and a student pledging
never to attend meetings have been
elected. This should be taken as a
statement about students' views of
the ASSU's reliability.
The senate has been handed
quite a project this year, trying to
take over the COP's duties. It is a
formidable task, and those senators
who have tried to pick up the slack
should be commended. Conversely,
those senators who have not taken
their responsibility seriously should
be reprimanded.
No legislative body can be effec
tive with only two-thirds of its
members present. The Stanford
student body saw something dras
tically wrong with the system last
year and voted not to have a COR
With the absence of so many sena
tors now, who knows, maybe
they'll vote to disband the ASSU
Senate altogether this year.
