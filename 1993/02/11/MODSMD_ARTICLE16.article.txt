## Have you been brainwashed? 
### 
IT NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME
how many Stanford students com
plain about how they have been vic
timized by a multicultural agenda that is
trying to brainwash them. However,
these same "victims" have not taken the
time to realize that they themselves have
already been brainwashed by institution
alized socialization.
For example, I constantly find myself
having this conversation in regard to
education, race and opportunities. I'll
start off saying, "Well, I'm sure if Blacks
had more and better opportunities they
too could get ahead. And if people in the
inner cities had decent schools and lived
in safe neighborhoods, things would be
different."
"Well, Kwame, I mean I know it's
really hard for them ... I mean it's prob
ably 10 times as hard for people in the
inner cities and in poor neighborhoods to
get out, but if they just stay in school,
and stay away from drugs, they can get
out," replies the pseudo-expert on reali
ty.
STOP! Before we get in to debate
about who's "right" let's question the
credibility of our pseudo-expert. With
this in mind, I'll say, "Have you been
there? Have you talked to the kids in the
streets? Have you been to the schools
with metal detectors and no computers
and no books for the kids? Have you lived
in a neighborhood where gun shots are as

commonplace as an airplane flying over
head?"
and I always hear,
"Well . . . no, . . . but I know that the
opportunities are there. It's just harder."
So we now have arrived at the impor
tant question. If you haven't been there,
haven't lived there, haven't done any
research on your own and have never
experienced that social reality, how are
you so knowledgeable about people and
places you know nothing about?
It is these people, the pseudo-experts,
who have themselves been brainwashed
by the American socialization process.
The same people who are scared of being
force-fed a new program — one that is
trying to promote understanding and
respect for people and ideas different
from their own — have, in effect,
already been brainwashed into beliefs
and perceptions about people and places
they know nothing about. I do not want
to suggest that I am supporting multi
culturalism, instead I am more con
cerned with studying the one culture
within which all of us have been social
ized.
Where does this brainwashing come
from? Although there are several con
tributing components, I think this Amer
ican fallacy of equality is one of the pri
mary culprits. Since day-one we are

spoon-fed the idea that we live in the land
of the free, the home of the brave, and
that America is the land of opportunities
and free education to all.
If you actually believe this, it is not dif
ficult to arrive at the aforementioned
conclusion or similar conclusions such as
"those people on welfare are just lazy and
are milking the system" or "if those kids
just worked harder in school and got
higher SAT scores, they could get out of
the cycle of poverty by themselves"
So the next time you are about to jump
on a seemingly "narrow-minded conser
vative" who "just doesn't get it," or
before you begin to enlighten a "radical"
on how things really should be, take a
minute and understand that the battle
isn't one of differing "ideologies." It is,
however, a battle attacking or defending
the whitewashed American belief system,
which socializes us into seeing, believing
and understanding an American social
reality that we, in fact, know very little
about.
