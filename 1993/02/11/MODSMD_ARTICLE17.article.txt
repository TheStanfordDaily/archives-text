Athletic Director addresses alleged abuse, invites discussion

IHAVE READ WITH great dismay
the numerous letter appearing in
The Daily that contain serious crit
icisms of a former Stanford coach. I
feel compelled to express concern
about the alleged misconduct and, at
the same time, apologize to any stu
dent athlete who didn't have a
healthy, positive and fulfilling experi
ence in our program.
While the pursuit of excellence is
part in parcel of the Stanford athletic
experience, there is no excuse for any
student to be physically or psychologi

cally demeaned or abused in any setting.
The Stanford athletic experience should
be positive, joyful, challenging and
uplifting for every student. Creating a
healthy psychological environment
within the athletic experience is our
most important task. I've expressed to
our coaches my concern about the previ
ously printed allegations and all of
them, to a person, agree that while win
ning is important, the quality of experi
ence that the student athlete has is
paramount.
In addition, I would like to take this

opportunity to extend, to anyone in the
Stanford community, the invitation to
sit down and discuss with me, confi
dentially and professionally, any con
cerns they may have about our pro
gram. The associate athletic directors
and I understand that our success
depends on the quality of information
we receive. We will continue to have an
"open-door policy" toward any student
who desires to express a complaint or a
concern. It is our fervent desire that
anyone would feel comfortable express
ing their opinion to us; secure in the

knowledge that we will handle it in a
professional, diplomatic and confiden
tial manner.
I am very proud of the Stanford ath
letic program, our students, athletes and
coaches. We are committed to making
the athletic ideal a reality on this cam
pus. Our new coach, Vin Lananna, and
his staff are in concert with this philoso
phy and we are excited about the future
of track and cross country at Stanford.
Please let us know your thoughts.
