# Mike Langford on the Bible-less Memorial Church: Go (re)figure
## 
### 
Mike Langford's opinion piece is
sometimes entertaining, sometimes
strange to me. I gather that his main
point is that he wants Memorial
Church to own up to its Christian char
acter. He could check out what happens
among the several Christian groups
who worship there during an average
week. I am told that Langford is a
member of Black Church at Stanford,
which has met there. Was his identity
as a Christian compromised at services
there?
An opinion piece is different from a
factual report, but: 1) there is no unwill
ingness to have Bibles in "Mem Chu"
(Langford's gift, with others, will be
happily received in support of that); 2)
renovation of Memorial Church, though
expensive, was far less than "about
$12.5 million dollars"; 3) his suspicion of
a link between lack of Bibles and a mul
ticultural agenda would not have stood
the test of a conversation, had he taken
the trouble to contact me for one.
I'll leave it to others to decide and

communicate to him what is offensive in
his slapshots at Islam and Hinduism.
Even as a sardonic piece, his column
reminded me of a story I once heard
about a preacher: in the margin of his
sermon manuscript he inked and under
lined, "Weak point, shout here!"
He has raised some discussable
issues. I'd welcome the chance to meet
him and talk with him about them.
