# Female columnists should have a voice in The Daily as well
## 
### 
I must admit it is my fault there are
no female columnists this quarter — my
fault and the fault of hundreds of other
women on this campus who feel they
have something to say but, like me, did
not apply to be a columnist. Whatever
the reason may have been — it's the last
half of my senior year and I want to
have free time to hang out with friends;
I've got a lot of work finishing my mqjor;
I'm deciding what to do with my life; I'm
lazy — I debated applying for the job but

decided not to.
I don't know how many applications
from women, if any, The Daily
received. If none, or only a few so terri
ble they could not be chosen, there is a
problem. The previous editor addressed
this issue last quarter, when few
women applied to be columnists and
only one was chosen. Unfortunately,
women, including myself, did not take
her words to heart. The result is that
this quarter women are not regularly
represented on the editorial page of
The Daily.
Of course, the reasons why women
are not applying for the job are
important and must be addressed. It
speaks volumes about the role and
feelings of women at Stanford and in
society in general. But I am concerned
more for the moment with the con
crete fact that there is no permanent
space for a female voice on the edito
rial page.
Even if the men who are speaking
are articulate, intelligent and aware
of women's concerns, they cannot
speak from a women's perspective.
That is why I suggest that there be
space set aside, at least once a week,
for women to voice their views and
opinions. The column-inches now
filled by such enlightening articles as
"101 Things to Do With CDs" could

be used more beneficially for a
woman's column.
I do realize the implications of such
a column. With this set-up, this space
becomes specifically female space, as
opposed to the normal columnist's
space, which is male space. The men
occupy the established position on the
editorial page; the women are mere
guests. The fact that, short of firing
one of the current male columnists,
this is the only way women's voices can
be heard on a regular basis on the edi
torial page, is disheartening to say the
least.
