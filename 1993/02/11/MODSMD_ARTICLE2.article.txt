# Campus housing demand drops
## Construction of 'eco-house,' other new residences put on hold

The return of the tiger salamander has suspended
construction of the planned Knoll housing, but a lack
of student demand for on-campus housing may can
cel it altogether.
In addition, the decline in housing demand could
affect the third phase of the planned Manzanita con
struction and plans to expand graduate student
housing, according to Director of Housing and Food
Service Keith Guy.
Because there were 59 vacancies in undergraduate
residences during fall quarter, University officials
believe there is less demand for housing, Guy said.
The number of students requesting housing in the
Draw and who remain unassigned has also dropped,
he said.
Approximately 100 fewer students participated in
the 1992 spring housing lottery. Similarly, last year
only 159 people remained unassigned as opposed to
329 in 1991, Guy added.
However, the number of undergraduates living
off-campus has risen only slightly since last year. Ac
cording to Housing Center estimates, 525 students

live ofT-campus this academic year, compared to 514
last year.
The University originally planned to build both
the Knoll and the final Manzanita residences to fulfill
the pledge of four years of guaranteed housing for un
dergraduates, said Bill Georges, acting director of the
Housing Center. Now, housing officials think they
may need only 200 more beds instead of the 400
planned, he added.
The Knoll residences included plans for a 60-per
son environmentally sensitive "eco-house" and a
120-bed residence patterned after the Suites. The
planned residence in Manzanita Park would house
approximately 200, replacing the last of the trailers
on that site.
Those spaces were designed to replace residences
destroyed in the earthquake, relieve crowding in cur
rent residences and end the practice of undergradu
ates living in graduate housing, he said.
"We don't want to overbuild. That would be waste
ful," Guy said, "but we don't want to get stuck two or
three years down the line without enough beds. We
want to do some investigating to see if we've met all
