# Campus housing demand drops
## Construction of 'eco-house,' other new residences put on hold 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
The return of the tiger salamander has suspended
construction of the planned Knoll housing, but a lack
of student demand for on-campus housing may can
cel it altogether.
In addition, the decline in housing demand could
affect the third phase of the planned Manzanita con
struction and plans to expand graduate student
housing, according to Director of Housing and Food
Service Keith Guy.
Because there were 59 vacancies in undergraduate
residences during fall quarter, University officials
believe there is less demand for housing, Guy said.
The number of students requesting housing in the
Draw and who remain unassigned has also dropped,
he said.
Approximately 100 fewer students participated in
the 1992 spring housing lottery. Similarly, last year
only 159 people remained unassigned as opposed to
329 in 1991, Guy added.
However, the number of undergraduates living
off-campus has risen only slightly since last year. Ac
cording to Housing Center estimates, 525 students

live ofT-campus this academic year, compared to 514
last year.
The University originally planned to build both
the Knoll and the final Manzanita residences to fulfill
the pledge of four years of guaranteed housing for un
dergraduates, said Bill Georges, acting director of the
Housing Center. Now, housing officials think they
may need only 200 more beds instead of the 400
planned, he added.
The Knoll residences included plans for a 60-per
son environmentally sensitive "eco-house" and a
120-bed residence patterned after the Suites. The
planned residence in Manzanita Park would house
approximately 200, replacing the last of the trailers
on that site.
Those spaces were designed to replace residences
destroyed in the earthquake, relieve crowding in cur
rent residences and end the practice of undergradu
ates living in graduate housing, he said.
"We don't want to overbuild. That would be waste
ful," Guy said, "but we don't want to get stuck two or
three years down the line without enough beds. We
want to do some investigating to see if we've met all
the demand on this campus or if
this is a fluke."
Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds said a sur
vey will be conducted to deter
mine why some students choose
to live off-campus. The results
will be presented to the Board of
Trustees in June, she said.
Although a housing survey was
also conducted last year, Guy said
last year's survey was not a
"demand survey."
"What we were trying to do
with [last year's] survey was to
find out from undergraduates and
graduate students what they
wanted to see in the new houses
and in the remodeling of the older
facilities," he explained.
If this year's survey demon
strates too little demand for both
housing projects, "we will have to
look very hard to decide what and
where [new construction] should
be," said Guy.
"That's my intention — to
have one more [house]. I don't
believe we'd scrap them both,
especially since we have this plan
to remove the Manzanita trail
ers," he said.
"There's strong sentiment on
part of my staff who helped

design the original plan for Man
zanita Park that it needs to be fin
ished," Guy added.
If plans for the "eco-house" are
scrapped, Guy said environmen
tally sound planning would likely
be incorporated into any future
building project. "It's certainly
not our plan to abandon those
good ideas," he said.
If the Knoll project is dropped,
part of the money set aside for it
would probably be used to com
plete the Manzanita Park resi
dences, Guy said. The two pro
jects have a combined budget of
$28 million.
If either or both of the new
projects are cancelled, it might
raise questions about the Univer
sity's commitment to disability
access. Guy said that all new
buildings will be fully accessible,
but older buildings will not neces
sarily be retrofitted — even if no
new residences are constructed.
In addition, graduate housing
needs will also be looked at during
the survey, said Edmonds.
"The graduate housing ques
tion is a much more complicated
one because the majority of grad
uate students are off-campus.
The University needs to decide
what the limit is for graduate
housing," Guy said.
