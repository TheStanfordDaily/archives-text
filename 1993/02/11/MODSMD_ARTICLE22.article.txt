## Code red: injured varsity teams need 'a few good people' 
### 
WANTED: STANFORD students
willing to fill vacant positions on
well-known varsity sports teams.
Must be willing to work long hours, eat
low-calorie training-table foods and drive
scooters to and from class. Previous ath
letic experience preferred, but not
required.
That's right, Stanford's sports teams
need you. I'm not talking about your
standard sweep-Maples-Pavilion-floor
position, or lowly locker room towel-boy
job. I'm talking prime time, the big show
— get out there and win one for the old
alma mater. Always wanted to play power
forward? You got it. Have a hankering to
play singles for the best women's tennis
team in the nation? Get out there, ya
crazy kid!
With the women's tennis and men's
hoops rosters looking like post-Viennese
Ball casualty lists, now is your chance to
give something back to Stanford. Haven't
you ever wondered why you just can't
sign up for that "Basketball — Men's
Varsity" option in the time schedule? It

can't be harder to get than, say "Fiction
Writing," can it? At least you won't have
to sleep out for this one.
For a good introductory athletic
course, try "Women's Tennis — Dynasty
Building 1." They'll start you out slow on
teams like Fresno State and Washington,
but watch out for the Final against Flori
da — it's worth 100 percent of your
grade.
For aspiring athletes looking for a lit
tle more of a challenge, consider "Men's
Hoops 6-15 — Honors Track." Your mis
sion: join the team and win your final
nine games, qualifying for the last spot in

the NCAA Tournament at 15-15. Then,
lead the team against the likes of Ken
tucky, Duke and Michigan, crushing each
on your way to an incredible come-from
behind win in the Final against Indiana.
Pass/No Championship option is not
available.
Imagine how much excitement this
would put into Cardinal sports this year.
No more watching your roommate put up
airball after airball in the Champion for
Champions shootout at halftime. Now he
can do it in the game. Think about every
time you've argued a call playing tennis
with a girl from youi "Beginning Tennis"
class. Try that one on center court at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
"But Mike," you say, "I have three
midterms, two problem sets and a Sociol
ogy research paper due this week! Where
will / find the time to play a major inter
collegiate sport this weekend?"
Hey, no excuses. I have five midterms
this week, and you don't see me complain
ing. Besides, you might even have time to
do some of it on the bench. I hear Andy

Poppink is a whiz at molecular biology.
"But," you continue, "what if I'm no
good at athletics?" If this is your problem,
you might want to consider coaching. I
hear Berkeley's men's basketball team
needs a head coach, so get your applica
tion in soon. You could coach the Weenies
against Stanford on Sunday, where, as a
true Cardinal fan, you'll hold your players
back and allow Stanford to win.
Whoops. Guess Campanelli would
have done that anyway . . .
Regardless of background, experi
ence, or ability, there's a place for every
one on a Stanford varsity sports team.
Just imagine President Casper, one day
slaving over report after report in his
office, the next slamming dunk after
dunk home against the Golden Bears, all
to the frenzied cheers of a wild Cardinal
crowd. Or picture the Stanford dollies
trading their pom-poms for tennis rack
ets and taking five out of six matches
from Pepperdine. The possibilities are
endless.
Of course, your stay might be cut

short as Stanford's starters recover from
their respective injuries and return to the
lineup. But who knows? Make 12-of-15
from the field against Cal, and you might
take over the small forward spot from
Brent Williams. Just remember, he won't
be happy about it.
Landing a starting spot on the
women's tennis team might be tougher,
however, unless you can dominate No. 1
Laxmi Poruri and Rolex Indoor Champi
on Heather Willens while vaulting to the
top 10 in the national rankings pretty
darn quick.
Hey, it could happen.
Don't let the glitz and glamour of big
time college athletics scare you. That
glitz and glamour can be yours — just
come on down to the game and suit up.
I know I'm ready. Gimme the rock,
coach.

Mike McDonough can be found sitting
next to fellow columnist David Schwartz
this Valentine's Day, way into three-point
range and way, way out of scoring range.

this week, and you don't see me complain
ing. Besides, you might even have time to
do some of it on the bench. I hear Andy

Poppink is a whiz at molecular biology.
"But," you continue, "what if I'm no
good at athletics?" If this is your problem,
you might want to consider coaching. I
hear Berkeley's men's basketball team
needs a head coach, so get your applica
tion in soon. You could coach the Weenies
against Stanford on Sunday, where, as a
true Cardinal fan, you'll hold your players
back and allow Stanford to win.
Whoops. Guess Campanelli would
have done that anyway . . .
Regardless of background, experi
ence, or ability, there's a place for every
one on a Stanford varsity sports team.
Just imagine President Casper, one day
slaving over report after report in his
office, the next slamming dunk after
dunk home against the Golden Bears, all
to the frenzied cheers of a wild Cardinal
crowd. Or picture the Stanford dollies
trading their pom-poms for tennis rack
ets and taking five out of six matches
from Pepperdine. The possibilities are
endless.
Of course, your stay might be cut

short as Stanford's starters recover from
their respective injuries and return to the
lineup. But who knows? Make 12-of-15
from the field against Cal, and you might
take over the small forward spot from
Brent Williams. Just remember, he won't
be happy about it.
Landing a starting spot on the
women's tennis team might be tougher,
however, unless you can dominate No. 1
Laxmi Poruri and Rolex Indoor Champi
on Heather Willens while vaulting to the
top 10 in the national rankings pretty
darn quick.
Hey, it could happen.
Don't let the glitz and glamour of big
time college athletics scare you. That
glitz and glamour can be yours — just
come on down to the game and suit up.
I know I'm ready. Gimme the rock,
coach.

this Valentine's Day, way into three-point
range and way, way out of scoring range.
