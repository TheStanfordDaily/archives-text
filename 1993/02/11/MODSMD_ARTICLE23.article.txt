Women's volleyball
Coach Don Shaw has announced that four of
the nation's top volleyball recruits will attend
Stanford in the fall. They include Paula
McNamee, a 6-foot middle blocker from Wheaton,
Md.; Colleen Miniuk, a 6-foot outside hitter from
St. Charles, 111.; Eileen Murfee, a 6-foot-2 middle
blocker from Tampa, Fla.; and Nikki Otto, a 5-
foot-11 middle blocker from Baden, Pa.
Cross-country
Freshman Rob Reeder finished second at the
U.S. Cross Country National Trials in Sandy,
Ore. last Saturday. This qualifies him for the
junior World Cross Country Championships, to
be held Mar. 27 in Amorebieta, Spain.
The Allendale, N.J., native finished behind
Georgetown's Brook Kintz. Only the top two
finishers advance to the World Championships.
On the women's side, freshman Laura Hay
ward placed 12th in her competition.
"I couldn't be more pleased," Stanford coach
Vin Lananna said. "For the men, this is the top
finish ever for a Stanford junior runner in this
championship."
Rugby
After a weekend off, the Stanford men's rugby
team returns to Pacific Coast league action this
Saturday when it hosts Humboldt State.
The Cardinal was slated to play Chico State
last Saturday, but the Northern California rains
turned Chico's playing field into a bog, forcing
the game to be rescheduled for a future date.
Despite missing a chance to vent its aggres
sion on yet another victim, Stanford welcomed
the bye as a chance to recover from a rash of
injuries. "This (the week off) has been kind of
good for us, because we were pretty beaten up,"
said Stanford coach Franck Boivert. "This gives
us a chance to get healthy."
Boivert's team faces a formidable challenge
in the ruggers from Humboldt. It was last year's
tie with the Loggers that extinguished any Car
dinal playoff hopes, and Stanford wants to be
sure that doesn't happen again. "We just self
destructed last year against these guys when we
played them," Boivert said. "I remember that
feeling, and I don't want to feel it again."
This weekend the Cardinal hopes to have
once again the services of Matt Tripp, who has
been out with an ankle injury, and John Girard,
who has a deep thigh contusion. Also expected
back is scrum-half Kevin Linker, who will see
his first action of the regular season after injur
ing his knee skiing over Winter Break.
