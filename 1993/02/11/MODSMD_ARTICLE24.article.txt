# Women's tennis way too much for Cougars, 9-0
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
With three of its top players
out of the lineup, the second
ranked Stanford women's ten
nis team still managed to
cruise to a 9-0 win over Wash
ington State (4-5) at Stanford
Tennis Stadium yesterday.
Stanford (4-0, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) rolled to its
fourth-straight 9-0 win this
year with the victory.
Freshman Beth Berris, playing
in the No. 1 position for Laxmi
Poruri, posted a decisive 6-2, 6-2
win over the Cougars' Katherine
Costain, while sophomore Amy
Chiminello, filling in for Heather
Willens, won at the No. 2 spot
against Ivana Granic, 6-2, 6-3.
"Beth was very quick," said
head coach Frank Brennan, after
the match. "She's been playing
well — she seems to be getting
better every week."
Junior Emma Woodhouse won
at No. 3 against WSU's Marcia
Senn, 6-2, 6-2, while freshman
Wendy Sacks crushed Cynthia
Bergman, 6-0, 6-1. In her first
dual match singles start this year,
senior Mario Carruth defeated
Maribeth Wilmowski in impres
sive style at the No. 5 slot, 6-1, 6-
2.
"It's nice to have Mario back,"
Brennan said. "She's a quality
player, and it was certainly a very
nice showing."
Sonya Cotero, playing through
slight tendinitis of the shoulder,
wrapped up the singles sweep for
the Cardinal, posting a 6-1, 6-2
win over Nicole Archambault..
"She might be a little sore
tomorrow, but that shouldn't
affect her for this weekend,"
Brennan said.
In doubles action, Stanford's
No. 1 team of Chiminello and Kim
Shasby disposed of WSU's
Costain and Granic, 6-3, 6-0.
Berris and Woodhouse teamed up
in the No. 2 spot to down Senn
and Wilmowski, 6-2, 6-2, while

'We've had our
warm-ups, now we
get into the
heavy-duty stuff'
— Frank Brennan

Sacks and Cotero survived a tight
first set to take their No. 3 match
against Lisa Kirsch and Bergman,
7-5, 6-2.
"I'd have to say that Shasby
and Amy played a real nice dou
bles match," Brennan said.
"From the last half of the first set
into the second, they were playing
some of their best tennis."
Stanford rested No. 1 Laxmi
Poruri, No. 2 Heather Willens,
No. 3 Shasby and No. 4 Kristine
Kurth for this weekend's matches
against Pepperdine and San
Diego State. Most notable among
those sitting was Kurth, who has
a lung infection and, in Brennan's
words, is "50-50" for this week
end. However, Poruri, Willens
and Shasby are expected to play
in those matches.
"Kristine's anxious to play,"
Brennan said. "I'd like to have
her in there, but we'll have to see
how she's feeling come Friday.
She seems to think she'll be feel
ing okay."
This weekend's match against
the No. 9 Waves marks Stanford's
first real test of the young season.
"We've had our warm-ups,
now we get into the heavy-duty
stuff," Brennan said. "We really
can't hope to go 9-0 with these
guys — they're very good."
Regardless of a slew of minor
injuries suffered by the Cardinal
this past week, however, Brennan
is confident that his team is ready
for the challenge.
"I feel pretty good about this
weekend," Brennan said. "I'd
like to have Kristine, but I think
we'll rise to the occasion in any
case."
