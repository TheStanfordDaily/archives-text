# Of hawks and doves
## Hoover Fellow finds reason in war 
### David McAleer 
Despite the instability in the
world today, the establishment of
peacetime armies in the 1600s has
actually decreased the amount of
warfare, according to Hoover
Senior Fellow Bruce Bueno de
Mesquita.
"Most people think we live in a
violent world — actually war is
much less prevalent than it was 200
years ago," he said yesterday in a
speech titled "War and Reason."
Bueno de Mesquita, who is also
a political science professor at the
University of Rochester, outlined
his ideas on negotiation, acquies
cence and violence between
nations.
Centering on the question of the
best path toward peace in the post
cold-war world, Bueno de Mesquita
discussed the long-standing debate
of whether it is preferable to be a
"dove" or a "hawk."
He defined a "dove" as a nation
— or person — which "prefers to
negotiate rather than compel an
adversary to accept its will," and a
"hawk" as the opposite.
"A world with only doves,
where everyone knows there are
only doves, will be peaceful, and
likewise a world with only hawks,
where everyone knows there are
only hawks, will also be peaceful,"
he said.
So, Bueno do Mesquita said, it
is not inherently better to be either
a dove or a hawk, but depends on
the specific situation. He main
tained that policy makers should
spend less time arguing over deter
rence versus disarmament, and

pay more attention to an analysis
of specific situations and adver
saries.
Bueno de Mesquita went on to
discuss the changing world situa
tion. "I'm hopeful about the large
number of emerging democracies
in the world right now," he said,
"but I'm also cautious."
"In the long term [the new
democracies] will lessen fighting,
but in the short term, they will
increase fighting," he said.
Bueno de Mesquita also argued
against the policy of never negoti
ating with terrorists. "Not all ter
rorists are fanatic lunatics," he
said. "With those terrorists who
are, negotiation will not help. . . .
But for those who merely feel
exasperation, frustration and
hopelessness, negotiation can be
helpful."
