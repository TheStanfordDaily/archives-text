# Keefe enjoys Bay Area reunion
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Adam Keefe is putting his Stan
ford political science degree to
good use — as a wall decoration for
his Atlanta apartment.
While many of his classmates
are testing the job market or la
boring in graduate school, Keefe is
already earning more than most of
them, by doing something he
loves: playing basketball.
Stanford graduates usually
climb the corporate ladder, and
Keefe has done so in swift fashion,
claiming a five-year, $2.9 million
contract in ascending to the Na
tional Basketball Association, the
top of the basketball pyramid.
Keefe was the first-round pick
of the Atlanta Hawks in the 1992
NBA Draft, and the 10th selection
overall. Tuesday night marked
Keefe's first return to the Bay

Area since he played for Stanford,
as the Hawks visited the Golden
State Warriors at the Oakland
Coliseum. In 20 minutes of play
ing time, he tallied seven points
and four rebounds in the Hawks'

'He's had some
ups and downs. He's
still got a lot to learn,
but as long as he
keeps working hard
he's going to be a
good player in this
league.'

125-114 victory.
After averaging 25.3 points and
12.3 rebounds per game last year
as a senior for the Cardinal, Keefe


Adam Keefe
has learned that it will take time
to be the dominant force that he
was in college. He is currently
averaging 6.4 points and 4.6
rebounds as a professional.
"Things come, but they don't
really come in the flow," Keefe
said. "The biggest thing for me is
to keep working hard. Some
nights you're going to go and not
get an offensive rebound and
other nights you're going to go
and get eight. So for me it's a mat
ter of not getting discouraged."
Keefe also must contend with
contributing in a reserve role,
backing up eight-year veteran
Kevin Willis. On Tuesday, Keefe
wore his familiar No. 31 and was
clad in red. But unlike his days at
Stanford, he viewed his team's
comeback from the bench.
"I'm still trying to figure out a
role on the team, where I stand,"
Keefe said. "I'm not exactly com
fortable yet with what I'm doing.
I'm not the go-to guy. I'm defi
nitely a role player."
"Right now he's just playing a
supplemental role," said Hawks
coach Bob Weiss. "He plays very
hard when he goes in there, he'll
hit the offensive boards for us, and
he's learning to play defense. But
it's tough for him to get minutes
because he's backing up Kevin."
Those minutes will come in
due time, but more than anything
else, Keefe's rookie year in profes
sional basketball has been an edu

cation in its own right.
"He's had some ups and
downs," said Hawks forward
Dominique Wilkins. "He's still
got a lot to learn, but as long as he
keeps working hard he's going to
be a good player in this league."
"Adam's a good athlete, but in
the NBA you're talking about the
best athletes in the world," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"It's a different game, he needs
time. But he'll figure out what he
needs to do to be successful, just
like he did for us."
Warriors reserve Jud Buech
ler, who played against Keefe at
Pacific 10 Conference rival Ari
zona, added, "He was a phenome
nal college player, but he had four
years to develop his game. This is
his rookie year. It's a learning
experience for everyone your
rookie year. I think he's going to
be a fantastic player when he
grows and learns the NBA game."
On Tuesday evening, Keefe
was in the familiar surroundings
of the Coliseum, where only a
year ago he led visiting Stanford
to a 92-66 victory over California.
"Its always nice to play some
where where you're familiar with
the gym, so that was nice and that
was another plus about coming
back here and playing," Keefe said.
When he was in the game, the
6-foot-9 Keefe matched up against
6-foot-10 Chris Gatling of the
Warriors, and held his own inside.
"He's a very strong, physical
player, and has a nice touch inside,"

Gatling said of Keefe. "He's a
banger, he really pushes you out
well, and gives you a hard time get
ting position."
Aside from his efforts from the
foul line, where he went three for
six, Keefe made the most of limit
ed playing time.
"He's a good player, but he
needs to work on his free throws,"
Warriors guard Tim Hardaway
quipped. "He's doing a good job
for them. He plays hard, he hus
tles, he's playing good defense,
he's doing good things."
Yet, as far as Keefe was con
cerned, the best aspect of this road
trip was the opportunity to visit
Stanford and see old friends. The
glamour of the NBA has not affect
ed Keefe's values. On Monday
night, rather than staying in the
team hotel, Keefe slept on the floor
of a room in the Phi Delt house.
"I'm not an extravagant guy.
Actually, my back has been hurt
ing me, so I've been sleeping on
the floor anyway."
A return to campus gave Keefe
perspective on his new life, while
reminding him of the place that
allowed him to get there.
"It was nice to get back and see
everyone and just be somewhere
familiar," Keefe said. "It's funny to
see guys stressing for midterms —
it's nice to be done with that part of
it. It's nice to go somewhere where
you know where you are and you
have a lot of good memories."
The memories Stanford has of
Keefe are just as fond.

since his arrival in the National Basketball Association last year.
