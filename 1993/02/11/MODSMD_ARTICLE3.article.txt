# Keefe enjoys Bay Area reunion

### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Adam Keefe is putting his Stan
ford political science degree to
good use — as a wall decoration for
his Atlanta apartment.
While many of his classmates
are testing the job market or la
boring in graduate school, Keefe is
already earning more than most of
them, by doing something he
loves: playing basketball.
Stanford graduates usually
climb the corporate ladder, and
Keefe has done so in swift fashion,
claiming a five-year, $2.9 million
contract in ascending to the Na
tional Basketball Association, the
top of the basketball pyramid.
Keefe was the first-round pick
of the Atlanta Hawks in the 1992
NBA Draft, and the 10th selection
overall. Tuesday night marked
Keefe's first return to the Bay

Area since he played for Stanford,
as the Hawks visited the Golden
State Warriors at the Oakland
Coliseum. In 20 minutes of play
ing time, he tallied seven points
and four rebounds in the Hawks'

'He's had some
ups and downs. He's
still got a lot to learn,
but as long as he
keeps working hard
he's going to be a
good player in this
league.'
