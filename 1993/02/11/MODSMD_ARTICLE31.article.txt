## Looking for phat beats — try Nickie's 
### 
If you've wondered where all the hype sam
ples from Das EFX to A Tribe Called Quest
come from, the answer is Nickie's club on a
Thursday night...
If we wrote dope over and over for our re
maining 15 inches, we wouldn't convey the re
lentless intensity of warm Fender Rhodes,
eight-piece horn sections and tripped-out vi
braphone excursions to the

can-we-hit-it-and-quit drum
ming, laying out the history of
today's hip-hop.
Because at Nickie's you're
not just hearing the two-bar

hooks screaming "Mic Chec
ka" — you're hearing the whole songs played
out in their original artistry and original con
texts. Everyone from Willie Colon to Pharaoh
Saunders makes it in the mix, and the crowd
packs it in. Nickie's is a gateway into a deep
analog addiction of live instruments on phat
vinyl, weaving sounds never coming to a mall
near you: Rare Groove.
Rare Groove gets its name from England,
where DJs like Giles took old American soul
out of the crates, and mixed in some of the
more mellow funk and harder jazz — you
probably don't know Giles, but since this is on
our resume, we need to name drop before we
shop.
Rare Groove flows toward a Motown tip,
but scratch the sequins, and add more octane
that'll carve melodies so pulverizingly hip
notic you will step to the dance floor. You will
not want to request Erasure. Or "Rump
Shaker."
Rare Groove is an exploding scene in Lon
don, New York, Tokyo and now the West
Coast. It is devoted to the thrills of dancing, the
complexity of live instrumentation working
with the artistry of deejaying, and the roots of
be-bop — molding together a sound un
matched in sophistication. Thriving on the in-

Pat Dote
Jim Haljun

timacy of the crowd, Rare Groove achieves a
racial diversity not attracted by other club
trends.
While the ideals behind the sound may be
lofty, Nickie's is a hole — but that's a good
thing. It's a stereotyped beat dive—bring your
Clove™ cigarettes and your Sartre safely
tucked under the arm of your ribbed black

turtleneck — Unpublished

seemed to be all that. But
they'd probably let you get by
with this months issue of
"Granta." Stay away from the
- Seven Sister's cider from
Idaho — who was thinking?

Some things are better left unsolved.
The slow buzz of alcohol slows your heart
rate to the 100 or so beats per minute of the
music — it's a welcomed change from the
smart drug and amphetamine enhancers
needed to beat match alpha waves to the liquid
laser visuals and silicon precision rhythms of a
well-done rave.
Remember kids, we're trained profession
als currently seeking a URO grant for the Cas
sell's Drug to Music, Music to Drug dictionary.
Don't try these tricks at home. Especially when
your parents are around. We would like to em
phasize that you do not need controlled sub
stances to enjoy an event — just to enjoy the
people you're with.
Nickie's is located on lower Haight and
there is a two-dollar cover. Rather then go
through the complicated and decidedly un
cool process of I.D. checking, Nickie's adopts
the visual yardstick of age: if you can't see over
the bar, you can't come in, you can't ride the
Colossus at Magic Mountain.
By the way, we currently run a free shuttle
Thursday and Saturday nights for anyone who
wants to break out of "Brown Eyed Girl" over
boxes of Fetzer, so drop us a line.
