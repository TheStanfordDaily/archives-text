## Generation who? Not me, not you 
### 
Here's a selfish question: why hasn't
anybody written books about us?
We're not asking why nobody has written
books about you and me, but what about
"us" in the more general sense? Doesn't it
seem like someone with a little imagination
and Word 5.0 could make our lives — us
Schoolhouse Rock

junkies and Breakfast
Club wannabes — into
the stuff of literary leg
end?

The answer, of course, is that they've tried,
starting all the way back with S. E. Hinton.
Remember "The Outsiders" and "Rumble
Fish?" Back in those days an anthropologist
studying us through "serious" literature
would have noted that we were all troubled
Midwestern youths with no self-esteem and
no future, due to our lack of parental guid
ance. We greased our hair and struck match
es on our teeth and swaggered down dusty
boulevards just looking for trouble.
Our junior high school teachers assigned
us these novels hoping that we'd lose our
selves in epiphanies of self-realization and ac
tually finish the books. But we knew that
wasn't us. We didn't even smoke.
In the '80s, we grew up, thanks to Jay
Mclnerney's "Bright Lights, Big City." He
gave us college degrees, ambitious entry-level
jobs already starting to smell like dead-end
careers and tiny apartments on the Upper
East Side.
Our inadequacies were illuminated by our
unhealthy penchant for introspection, lead
ing to self-destructive nihilism. We lost our
selves in a smoky haze of singles bars and taxi
cabs, spending our hard-earned corporate
dollars on ever-increasing amounts of con
trolled substances. Black sunglasses were a
must.

Ted Quinn

Once again, the literary world missed the
mark. We really didn't hate ourselves all that
much and we certainly couldn't afford Peru
vian cocaine. Hell, we couldn't even afford
the black sunglasses.
Finally, the '90s caught up with us and
Douglas Coupland came to our rescue with
"Generation X" and "Shampoo Planet." Per-
haps the most valiant ef-

fort so far, Shampoo
Planet" relieves us of our
bad hair and our chemical

addictions and portrays us
instead as good-hearted youths trapped be
tween the power lunches of the Reagan years
and the flower power of our hippie parents.
Tragically, these mighty opposing forces
squeeze the youthful exuberance out of us
and leave us completely lost and exuding self
loathing like bad cologne.
These are all fine works of literature despite
their cultural tunnel vision, but it's a little de
pressing that the literary archetype for our
generation as a bunch of despairing burn
outs is now almost set in stone.
As if that wasn't enough, the news media
then picks up on these images and runs grim
segments which cut from close-ups of junkies
and skinheads to panoramas of slack-jawed
corporate slaves in cheap suits, while Peter
Jennings drones on sympathetically about
how we'll suffer for the sins of the generations
before us.
So where are the well-adjusted twen
tysomethings with cheap Japanese cars and
Gap wardrobes? That's easy. They're on "Mel
rose Place." And although most of us would
probably rather drown in angst than suffer
the saccharine insipidity of Fox television, the
literary world can learn a few things from the
Nielsen ratings.
Give us a break, or you just might lose the
"Lost Generation" permanently.
