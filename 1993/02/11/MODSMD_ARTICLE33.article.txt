# ANCIENT TRAGEDY,
## MODERN SUCCESS 
### SABRINA WONG 
If you thought you learned everything you needed to know
about Greek tragedy in CIV, think again. The Lively Arts at
Stanford and the Drama Department's production of Euripi
des' "Suppliant Women" aims to challenge conventional ideas
about ancient drama.
"The three main misconceptions about Greek tragedy are that it's

incomprehensible, long and boring," says director Rush Rehm, an as
sistant professor of drama. "This play packs more punches-per
minute than a heavy-weight fight... It's 85 minutes of fire."
While the story may be thousands of years old, the issues it rais
es are timeless. As the chorus of Argive women pleads for the bod
ies of its dead sons left in Thebes, the Athenians must decide
whether to uphold Greek law and intervene. A fight between the
radical democracy of Athens and the benign tyranny of Thebes en
sues. First performed during the Peloponnesian War, "Suppliant
Women" poses a difficult question: does a good cause justify war?
It's about "the mothers of the disappeared — women whose
children have died brutal deaths for political causes, in wars. It's a
bleak, horrid look at a world that ought to be better — in that re
spect, it's a world very like our own," Rehm says.
"Athens was a lot like the United States. When Theseus [the leader

SUPPLIANT WOMEN RAISES TIMELESS ISSUES,

of Athens] says 'I will command the army — pure swords on a pure
mission,' it sounds like Bush speaking about Somalia. It touches on the
whole idea of the U.S. as the world's policeman," says Sonya Martinez,
a graduate student who is a member of the chorus.
"Suppliant Women" also exposes the different ways men and
women think about war and peace. The women's chorus remains on
stage for the entire play. "It's really appropriate because women,
without having access to a direct political voice, affect a decision by
reminding Theseus of their common social bonds — of the domes
tic, the every day," Martinez says.
The play's connection to Democracy 2500, a nation-wide pro
ject marking the 2500 th anniversary of Athenian democracy, un
derscores the play's political element. After the two-week perfor
mance in Memorial Auditorium, "Suppliant Women" will play in
Washington D.C. for four days, and then at the J. Paul Getty Muse

um in Los Angeles for another two weeks.
Rehm, who sought outside funding for the project and received it
from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Art Partners Program, believes
that the issues raised by "Suppliant Women" have a direct correlation
to budget controversies at Stanford.
"Democracy and tragic performances developed at the same time.

The ancients saw drama as part and parcel of
what makes an intelligent society," Rehm says.
"By addressing important issues, this
production might help people understand
that drama is not marginal. The play poses

questions that are not hard to recognize, but are very difficult to
grapple with. If the arts are just entertainment, then (the adminis
tration is) right, it's a luxury."

While the translated Greek text remains close to
the original script, the set in Memorial Auditorium is
a far cry from a dusty outdoor amphitheater.
Taking his cue from the line that "the gods reverse
everything," set designer John Wilson, currently a visit

ing professor, has put the audience on the "conventional stage," al
lowing for the entire auditorium to serve as the play's stage.
"The stage seating challenges the audience's assumptions of what
theater is supposed to be — comfortable seating a safe distance from the
action," Wilson says.
Wilson has been working closely with sophomore Michael de-
Gusta to create a visual orchestration of the text, composed of over

250 images
that will be
projected
onto a 25

foot-by-25 foot screen behind the play.
"The projections should help open a window in the audience so that
the ancient Greek text can work in the 20th-century mind," Wilson says.
During dialogue, the projections will serve the conventional pur

pose of giving a location. However, during the series of
the suppliant women choruses, "the visual underscor
ing is much more emotional," Wilson says.
For examnle. when the women remark about heinp

i ui tAaiiipit, TViiv.Ji uit wwiiitl l initial i\ auuui isvui£
"barren," there are images of deserts and dry fields. When they ques
tion why they bothered giving birth to a son who would die in war, im
ages of a woman giving birth, the flute of a Greek column and a dead
body being dumped out of a chute flood the screen.
"There is a lot of metaphor. We're dealing with another language that
words don't do justice to," Wilson says.

Using advanced computer technology, Wilson and deGusta
have been able to manipulate these visual images. They can trim the
weeds around the base of the Acropolis and change the color of the
sun to give the pictures maximum impact.
"I'm not sure that many theaters have access to this kind of
technology," Wilson says. "Michael's participation is saving my
butt. Not only does he know how to use this computer but he also
has a good eye," he adds.
The interaction between Wilson and deGusta highlight a criti
cal feature of "Suppliant Women."
"The best thing about this play is the opportunity for students
to experience this level of professionalism so young," says stage
manager David Cullinan, a senior whose involvement in "Suppli

ant Women" will serve as his thesis project.
"This project is massive. Many (students) would have to wait at least
three years after graduation to get the kind of experience we're getting
now," Cullinan says. "This is as close to 'real life drama' as one can get on
a campus."
The funding from Reader's Digest is largely responsible for the
unprecedented collaboration between students and professionals.
The grant has made possible the involvement of high-profile figures
such as choreographer Ze'eva Cohen and composer Michael Keck, as
well as six equity actors from the Bay Area to the Stanford campus.
"It's been really intense. These people have had training. They
can really do things with their bodies to communicate," says senior
Clark Jackson, a member of the sons' chorus.
"I've learned a lot about creating images with my body and with
the mask." Jackson says. "When I see what [the professionals) do, I

CHALLENGES CONVENTIONS

realize what I have to learn."
"We're all working together as equals. They benefit from our
experience and we benefit from their enthusiasm The idea is
bigger than the individuals," says professional actor Mark Capri,
who plays Theseus.
Cullinan concurs: "Sometimes I step back and look at the dif
ferent elements in this project and think, wow — this has a soul."

technology," Wilson says. "Michael's participation is saving my
butt. Not only does he know how to use this computer but he also
has a good eye," he adds.
The interaction between Wilson and deGusta highlight a criti
cal feature of "Suppliant Women."
"The best thing about this play is the opportunity for students
to experience this level of professionalism so young," says stage
manager David Cullinan, a senior whose involvement in "Suppli

ant Women" will serve as his thesis project.
"This project is massive. Many (students) would have to wait at least
three years after graduation to get the kind of experience we're getting
now," Cullinan says. "This is as close to 'real life drama' as one can get on
a campus."
The funding from Reader's Digest is largely responsible for the
unprecedented collaboration between students and professionals.
The grant has made possible the involvement of high-profile figures
such as choreographer Ze'eva Cohen and composer Michael Keck, as
well as six equity actors from the Bay Area to the Stanford campus.
"It's been really intense. These people have had training. They
can really do things with their bodies to communicate," says senior
Clark Jackson, a member of the sons' chorus.
"I've learned a lot about creating images with my body and with
the mask." Jackson says. "When I see what [the professionals) do, I

CHALLENGES CONVENTIONS

realize what I have to learn."
"We're all working together as equals. They benefit from our
experience and we benefit from their enthusiasm The idea is
bigger than the individuals," says professional actor Mark Capri,
who plays Theseus.
Cullinan concurs: "Sometimes I step back and look at the dif
ferent elements in this project and think, wow — this has a soul."

Actors practice using the masks during dress rehearsal for "Suppliant Women" Saturday morning in Memorial Auditorium. The multimedia production will play
for two weeks before showing in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles.
If you thought you learned everything you needed to know
about Greek tragedy in CIV, think again. The Lively Arts at
Stanford and the Drama Department's production of Euripi
des' "Suppliant Women" aims to challenge conventional ideas
about ancient drama.
"The three main misconceptions about Greek tragedy are that it's

incomprehensible, long and boring," says director Rush Rehm, an as
sistant professor of drama. "This play packs more punches-per
minute than a heavy-weight fight... It's 85 minutes of fire."
While the story may be thousands of years old, the issues it rais
es are timeless. As the chorus of Argive women pleads for the bod
ies of its dead sons left in Thebes, the Athenians must decide
whether to uphold Greek law and intervene. A fight between the
radical democracy of Athens and the benign tyranny of Thebes en
sues. First performed during the Peloponnesian War, "Suppliant
Women" poses a difficult question: does a good cause justify war?
It's about "the mothers of the disappeared — women whose
children have died brutal deaths for political causes, in wars. It's a
bleak, horrid look at a world that ought to be better — in that re
spect, it's a world very like our own," Rehm says.
"Athens was a lot like the United States. When Theseus [the leader

SUPPLIANT WOMEN RAISES TIMELESS ISSUES,

of Athens] says 'I will command the army — pure swords on a pure
mission,' it sounds like Bush speaking about Somalia. It touches on the
whole idea of the U.S. as the world's policeman," says Sonya Martinez,
a graduate student who is a member of the chorus.
"Suppliant Women" also exposes the different ways men and
women think about war and peace. The women's chorus remains on
stage for the entire play. "It's really appropriate because women,
without having access to a direct political voice, affect a decision by
reminding Theseus of their common social bonds — of the domes
tic, the every day," Martinez says.
The play's connection to Democracy 2500, a nation-wide pro
ject marking the 2500 th anniversary of Athenian democracy, un
derscores the play's political element. After the two-week perfor
mance in Memorial Auditorium, "Suppliant Women" will play in
Washington D.C. for four days, and then at the J. Paul Getty Muse

um in Los Angeles for another two weeks.
Rehm, who sought outside funding for the project and received it
from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Art Partners Program, believes
that the issues raised by "Suppliant Women" have a direct correlation
to budget controversies at Stanford.
"Democracy and tragic performances developed at the same time.

The ancients saw drama as part and parcel of
what makes an intelligent society," Rehm says.
"By addressing important issues, this
production might help people understand
that drama is not marginal. The play poses

questions that are not hard to recognize, but are very difficult to
grapple with. If the arts are just entertainment, then (the adminis
tration is) right, it's a luxury."

While the translated Greek text remains close to
the original script, the set in Memorial Auditorium is
a far cry from a dusty outdoor amphitheater.
Taking his cue from the line that "the gods reverse
everything," set designer John Wilson, currently a visit

ing professor, has put the audience on the "conventional stage," al
lowing for the entire auditorium to serve as the play's stage.
"The stage seating challenges the audience's assumptions of what
theater is supposed to be — comfortable seating a safe distance from the
action," Wilson says.
Wilson has been working closely with sophomore Michael de-
Gusta to create a visual orchestration of the text, composed of over

250 images
that will be
projected
onto a 25

foot-by-25 foot screen behind the play.
"The projections should help open a window in the audience so that
the ancient Greek text can work in the 20th-century mind," Wilson says.
During dialogue, the projections will serve the conventional pur

pose of giving a location. However, during the series of
the suppliant women choruses, "the visual underscor
ing is much more emotional," Wilson says.
For examnle. when the women remark about heinp

i ui tAaiiipit, TViiv.Ji uit wwiiitl l initial i\ auuui isvui£
"barren," there are images of deserts and dry fields. When they ques
tion why they bothered giving birth to a son who would die in war, im
ages of a woman giving birth, the flute of a Greek column and a dead
body being dumped out of a chute flood the screen.
"There is a lot of metaphor. We're dealing with another language that
words don't do justice to," Wilson says.

Using advanced computer technology, Wilson and deGusta
have been able to manipulate these visual images. They can trim the
weeds around the base of the Acropolis and change the color of the
sun to give the pictures maximum impact.
"I'm not sure that many theaters have access to this kind of
technology," Wilson says. "Michael's participation is saving my
butt. Not only does he know how to use this computer but he also
has a good eye," he adds.
