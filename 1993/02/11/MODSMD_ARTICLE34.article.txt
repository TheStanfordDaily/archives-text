# In love

There is no better day than
Valentine's Day in the whole wide
world. Valentine's Day is the one
day all year when it's OK to express
your sensitive, caring side, and
demonstrate to that special person in your
life how much they really mean to you.
A day when someone buys you expensive
gifts and you give them expensive gifts in
return.
Or maybe you just knit them a sweater in
their favorite color, or iron their socks for
the day.
So break out of the day-to-day monotony
of Co Ho dates, food service brunches and
study sessions in the Poli Sci Building. On
this most festive of occasions, those of you

, - /
who have significant others should
take time out to express your
romantic tendencies.
Give Green a raincheck for the
day, and spend a nice, quiet
Sunday, just the two of you, enjoy
ing each other's company.
Open your wallet for the one
you love.
But Valentine's isn't just about
something as shallow as money.
Taking the time out of your busy
schedule to walk to the Dish with
that magic someone, jotting down
a poem on the back of a napkin or
decorating their door with a beau
tiful condom bouquet can be an
appreciated display of affection to
keep your relationship alive.
Valentine's is about love.
True love.
There's no such thing as too
romantic on Valentine's Day. For 24
hours — but no longer than 24 —
picnic lunches, champagne bottles,
red hearts, candy and flowers and

slow dancing are OK.
It's a time to go all out and let that closet
"Beauty and the Beast" fan in you come out.
After all, it can't hurt. At least not much.
For those who might be a little rusty with
the whole "romance" thing, here are a few
tips:
Clean yourself up... Men, rush on over
to Tresidder (if you dare), or downtown to the
Presidents barber shop and get yourself one of
those wash-and-go haircuts for under $10.
Not that the Eraserhead look isn't con
ducive to a handsome image, but nice,
healthy ends can be extremely attractive.
Women, make yourself look like you did
back in high school for the day. La Belle Skin
and Body Care in the Stanford Shopping
Center will give you a full makeover, as well
as teach you proper techniques and color
usage — a veritable investment in your
future — all for $65. (The session takes an
hour and a half).
For just a makeover, the costs for a one
hour session range from $35 to $45. Why
not wear lipstick for the one you love?
Buying clothing for yourself may be a lit
tle bit of a stretch, but try to pick a flattering
outfit from your closet, maybe even some-

thing body-conforming, for the day.
A brief trip to the laundromat couldn't
hurt either. And no sweats allowed, for either
gender.
No way.
Get them good 100t... Not that a gift is
mandatory, but a nice present tucked under
your arm as you knock on your true love's
door couldn't hurt.
Homemade cards drawn with crayons
i (ditch the computer-printed cards), creative
art projects, poems and serenades are sure
fire hits.
r Make your partner a little jar of happy
thoughts, with a slip of paper including a
special moment you've shared on each one,
for instant melt-in-your-hands appreciation.

(Examples: That night in the Poli Sci build
ing. The weekend your roommate went out
of town. The Great Janitorial Closet
Adventure, and so on.)
But if time is a more precious commodity
for you, and the Gold Card isn't maxed out,
go for purchasable items.
Dial-A-Gift in Palo Alto offers a variety of
gift baskets, all delivered to campus for only
a $5 delivery fee: a small price to pay for the
person who puts up with your morning
breath.
The penny-pincher special $25 gift
includes a heart mug filled with candies,
with an attached bouquet of six mylar bal
loons.
For $30, you can get two dozen cookies,
along with three latex balloons sent to their door.
For $40, you can get a Romance Basket
— an investment with good return — which
includes massage oils, finger paints and
whipped creams for those who'd rather
spend the day indoors.
If you are out to impress your date, the
$100 top-of-the-line basket, including a bot
tle of champagne, gourmet foods, massage

oil and balloons, can be an easy kill-two
birds-with-one-stone, picnic-at-the-Dish
accessory, taking care of the whole day's
events.
At the always-enigmatic Senshu lingerie
store in downtown Palo Alto, most items go
for around $50. The store carries men's
items, but specializes in bras, which sell for
$25 to $123. They are having a 10 percent
off sale until Feb. 14.
Jewelry wins faithful followers.
At Gleim Jewelers in the shopping center,
you can buy a sterling silver purse mirror
($25) or perfume flask ($65) to win brownie
points.
For those looking to strike it rich in the
happiness department, Gleim also offers

x
heart-shaped diamond engage
ment rings for $6,320, which is
significantly less than next year's
tuition.
Leather Odyssey in
Hayward offers a variety of black
leather riding chaps for $138 to
$300.
Get off campus for once..
. No excuse for it this time.
Budget Rent-A-Car offers stylish
automobiles for $25 a day.
Unfortunately, you have to be
over 25 years old and have a
major credit card, so adopt a grad
student to help you out.
Catch some entertainment,
for instance, the Johnny Mathis
concert at the Orpheum Theatre.
Put on those cowboy boots
and get going.
Or a movie. Wouldn't it be
nice to sit in the back row of a
movie theater and watch while
holding your snookums' hands.
Beware of the dangerous

adhesive qualities of the imitation butter
spray used on popcorn.
Going to the Stanford-Cal men's basket
ball game doesn't count. Think off campus.
Try brunch at Hobees, but go easy on the
atomic cinnamon-orange tea.
Lunch at the Hearts Cafe, and then din
ner in the City. Food is a high priority you
know, so leave FloMo's salad bar behind and
eat as if your parents were in town for the
weekend.
Try and find some privacy... The Glass
Slipper Inn has booked all of its single rooms
for the day already, but the big spender can
rent a double room for $30 plus 10 percent
sales tax, or a kitchenette for $46.
A little more upscale is Palo Alto's Holiday
Inn, with a room on the back side going for
$78 a night, one on the inside for $86.40, or a
shoot-the-wad special, usurping the Leland
Stanford suite — two rooms connecting —
for $450.
What an impression.
But whatever you do, just remember the
meaning of this joyous day, a day for lovers,
a day for the beauty of a shared relationship,
a day to be happy and a day to prove that,
yes Leland, there is dating at Stanford. ■
