# Out of love
## 
### Michael Green 
There's no worse day to be alone than
Valentine's Day. In fact, there's no
worse day, period. Valentine's Day
was designed solely to give all those
poor whipped fools who have some
one the chance to point and laugh at people
who aren't having sex.
It's a time for people to be pushed into
pretending they care. A time to say, "Well,
I'm sorry I've neglected you since April, but
here's some roses. Look, they're red." A time
for cutesy people to say those three magic
words....
"Buy me that."
No thanks. Who needs it? The quasi-car
ing. The forced affection. Say it with cash.
And worst of all, they make you feel like
you're doing something wrong by being sin-

gle. Like you're the only one.
Well the truth is, more people
seem to be without than with —
or at least they're more vocal about
it. So don't worry. If you're alone
then you're in good company.
You don't need anybody else.
Take this day and consecrate it.
Make it your own. Turn it from a
nightmare in pink into a hallowed
day of narcissism.
Spend some money on your -
self instead of on someone who's
going to dump your ass. You
deserve it more and your hand
will still be there in the morning.
Do things for yourself. Take
your mind off colored hearts and
cookies-on-a-stick by spoiling the
one you really love: You.
Get rid of that tension... If
you did have a significant other,
you'd probably make them rub you.
Well there's no need to be
dependent on some "Litde Pookie"
when you can pay for a massage.
Several local establishments offer
trained massage services —
Swedish or Shiatsu — at $40 for 30
minutes, $60 for an hour.
Most spas have saunas as well,
so you can sweat as much as you
want, without the burden of any
one else's satiation.
Why get out of bed?... Sure,
you could get up and make your-

self something special, but that involves
effort, ability and leaving bed.
Why bother getting up when you've got a
phone within arms reach? An order of Won
Ton soup, Chicken Lo Mein and vegetable
fried rice can be brought to your door for
about $14. Remember to ask for chopsticks.
Pizza also can magically appear for $6 to
$12. To make the most of it, consult the coupon
section of the Stanford directory first.
Your bed is your domain... Since
you're already glorifying your time in bed,
why not glorify the bed itself. Feather-beds
range from $60 to $120 and they're certain to
make your bed even more difficult to leave in
the morning.
If you don't feel like spending too much
on it, take advantage of The House of Foam's

return policy. Just leave the plastic wrapping
on any standard size item and return it when
you have had enough of luxurious comfort.
Again, you won't have to move until
there's a knock at the door. Most mattress
and foam outlets deliver.
Get some new duds... It's hard not to
feel better about yourself when you're in a
new outfit. Who knows? Maybe you'll cross
the path of someone who dissed you. You
might as well be dressed for it.
A new suit from Wiedeman's can run any
where from $500 to $850. Ties are usually in
the $40 to $50 range. A party dress from
Laura (Ingalls) Ashley will be tagged between
$100 to $175.
Rent empathy... Grab your Blockbuster
card and go rent some flicks. Be sure to pick

out the ones that will make you feel welcome
in a shallow world of Love-lovers.
Laugh all the way through "Love Story."
Cheer on Alex in "Fatal Attraction." Revel in
the success of marriage while you watch "War
of the Roses." Maybe even watch "90210" and
sympathize with poor, poor Brenda.
Explore yourself... Several centers in
the area offer one-on-one meditation tutori
als designed to bring you closer to true tran
quility and Union. Remember, with inner
peace, who needs Love? This is money well
spent.
An hour session in Qi Gong meditation is

$65. For $400 you can become a master of
Transcendental Meditation in under a
month. Sessions at the Zen Center in San
Francisco are free, but harder on the legs.
Appreciate what you have... Call home
dammit.
Sure you not romantically attached, but
does that mean you don't have a family? Your
Mom was your first love anyway. And Dad
got the Valentine you made in kindergarten.
So call them.
Long-distance calls to anywhere outside
California, at night and on weekends, are
about 12 to 15 cents a minute.
If you can't spend 84 cents on the woman
who breast-fed you, then you probably deserve
to be lonely and bitter on Valentine's day.
Go far, far away... Forget your troubles

through travel. Go to Reno. Ski, gam
ble, drink or just stare despondently
into the hazy flashing lights.
From now through 'til March,
Circus Circus offers rooms for one for
$24 a night. Lift tickets can be bought
at discount, and you receive a free Hot
Toddy with each one.
Regress... Let some cold chip
munks, a mouse and a mermaid
skate your sorrows away. Walt
Disney's World On Ice will be having
two shows on Valentine's Day at the
Oakland Coliseum. Good seats can
be bought up until show time.
Special rinkside seats are available if
you call in advance.
Pay for sex... Escort services on
the big day can be obtained for a
scant $300 an hour. A nice boy
known as the "Iceman" can be
brought to your own dorm room for
an hour of gyration at $145.
Don't be embarrassed when you
call. Most numbers in the phone book
will refer you to someone who will call
you right back and discuss the terms of
your transaction.
If hands-on is a bit too much for
you then there's the reliable phone.
Good phone sex usually costs $2 to
$4 for the first minute and $1 to $3
each additional. It pays to be quick
about things.
Share the misery... A good
way bring others to your level

/v *
would be to crash the Viennese Ball.
For about $45 you can acquire all the
tools necessary to make your own "back
door" to the Ford Center, while all those cou
ples float on a cushion of pheromones. You'll
need a drill ($32.50), a crowbar ($8) and
some screwdrivers ($3 to $8 each).
Once you're in, try to take your success
one step past petty MacGyver-isms. Bring a
Supersoaker ($7.50 to $32) full of red wine.
Eat some cheese and crackers. Polka.
There's no need to go sharpening your
razor blades just because you don't have your
own personal love bunny. There are plenty of
things you can do for yourself.
Besides, they'll never make it through the
summer. ■

fried rice can be brought to your door for
about $14. Remember to ask for chopsticks.
Pizza also can magically appear for $6 to
$12. To make the most of it, consult the coupon
section of the Stanford directory first.
Your bed is your domain... Since
you're already glorifying your time in bed,
why not glorify the bed itself. Feather-beds
range from $60 to $120 and they're certain to
make your bed even more difficult to leave in
the morning.
If you don't feel like spending too much
on it, take advantage of The House of Foam's

return policy. Just leave the plastic wrapping
on any standard size item and return it when
you have had enough of luxurious comfort.
Again, you won't have to move until
there's a knock at the door. Most mattress
and foam outlets deliver.
Get some new duds... It's hard not to
feel better about yourself when you're in a
new outfit. Who knows? Maybe you'll cross
the path of someone who dissed you. You
might as well be dressed for it.
A new suit from Wiedeman's can run any
where from $500 to $850. Ties are usually in
the $40 to $50 range. A party dress from
Laura (Ingalls) Ashley will be tagged between
$100 to $175.
Rent empathy... Grab your Blockbuster
card and go rent some flicks. Be sure to pick

out the ones that will make you feel welcome
in a shallow world of Love-lovers.
Laugh all the way through "Love Story."
Cheer on Alex in "Fatal Attraction." Revel in
the success of marriage while you watch "War
of the Roses." Maybe even watch "90210" and
sympathize with poor, poor Brenda.
Explore yourself... Several centers in
the area offer one-on-one meditation tutori
als designed to bring you closer to true tran
quility and Union. Remember, with inner
peace, who needs Love? This is money well
spent.
An hour session in Qi Gong meditation is

$65. For $400 you can become a master of
Transcendental Meditation in under a
month. Sessions at the Zen Center in San
Francisco are free, but harder on the legs.
Appreciate what you have... Call home
dammit.
Sure you not romantically attached, but
does that mean you don't have a family? Your
Mom was your first love anyway. And Dad
got the Valentine you made in kindergarten.
So call them.
Long-distance calls to anywhere outside
California, at night and on weekends, are
about 12 to 15 cents a minute.
If you can't spend 84 cents on the woman
who breast-fed you, then you probably deserve
to be lonely and bitter on Valentine's day.
Go far, far away... Forget your troubles

through travel. Go to Reno. Ski, gam
ble, drink or just stare despondently
into the hazy flashing lights.
From now through 'til March,
Circus Circus offers rooms for one for
$24 a night. Lift tickets can be bought
at discount, and you receive a free Hot
Toddy with each one.
Regress... Let some cold chip
munks, a mouse and a mermaid
skate your sorrows away. Walt
Disney's World On Ice will be having
two shows on Valentine's Day at the
Oakland Coliseum. Good seats can
be bought up until show time.
Special rinkside seats are available if
you call in advance.
Pay for sex... Escort services on
the big day can be obtained for a
scant $300 an hour. A nice boy
known as the "Iceman" can be
brought to your own dorm room for
an hour of gyration at $145.
Don't be embarrassed when you
call. Most numbers in the phone book
will refer you to someone who will call
you right back and discuss the terms of
your transaction.
If hands-on is a bit too much for
you then there's the reliable phone.
Good phone sex usually costs $2 to
$4 for the first minute and $1 to $3
each additional. It pays to be quick
about things.
Share the misery... A good
way bring others to your level

/v *
would be to crash the Viennese Ball.
For about $45 you can acquire all the
tools necessary to make your own "back
door" to the Ford Center, while all those cou
ples float on a cushion of pheromones. You'll
need a drill ($32.50), a crowbar ($8) and
some screwdrivers ($3 to $8 each).
Once you're in, try to take your success
one step past petty MacGyver-isms. Bring a
Supersoaker ($7.50 to $32) full of red wine.
Eat some cheese and crackers. Polka.
There's no need to go sharpening your
razor blades just because you don't have your
own personal love bunny. There are plenty of
things you can do for yourself.
Besides, they'll never make it through the
summer. ■
There's no worse day to be alone than
Valentine's Day. In fact, there's no
worse day, period. Valentine's Day
was designed solely to give all those
poor whipped fools who have some
one the chance to point and laugh at people
who aren't having sex.
It's a time for people to be pushed into
pretending they care. A time to say, "Well,
I'm sorry I've neglected you since April, but
here's some roses. Look, they're red." A time
for cutesy people to say those three magic
words....
"Buy me that."
No thanks. Who needs it? The quasi-car
ing. The forced affection. Say it with cash.
And worst of all, they make you feel like
you're doing something wrong by being sin-

gle. Like you're the only one.
Well the truth is, more people
seem to be without than with —
or at least they're more vocal about
it. So don't worry. If you're alone
then you're in good company.
You don't need anybody else.
Take this day and consecrate it.
Make it your own. Turn it from a
nightmare in pink into a hallowed
day of narcissism.
Spend some money on your -
self instead of on someone who's
going to dump your ass. You
deserve it more and your hand
will still be there in the morning.
Do things for yourself. Take
your mind off colored hearts and
cookies-on-a-stick by spoiling the
one you really love: You.
Get rid of that tension... If
you did have a significant other,
you'd probably make them rub you.
Well there's no need to be
dependent on some "Litde Pookie"
when you can pay for a massage.
Several local establishments offer
trained massage services —
Swedish or Shiatsu — at $40 for 30
minutes, $60 for an hour.
Most spas have saunas as well,
so you can sweat as much as you
want, without the burden of any
one else's satiation.
Why get out of bed?... Sure,
you could get up and make your-

self something special, but that involves
effort, ability and leaving bed.
Why bother getting up when you've got a
phone within arms reach? An order of Won
Ton soup, Chicken Lo Mein and vegetable
fried rice can be brought to your door for
about $14. Remember to ask for chopsticks.
