American remake
turns original hit
to bad Eurotrash

The Vanishing

Director George Sluizer should be forced
to commit hara-kiri for his dreadful Ameri
can reincarnation of "The Vanishing," espe
cially since he directed the tightly-crafted
1988 European version, which American crit
ics praised for its simple yet disturbing story.
Perhaps this venture into the mainstream,
with its limp dialogue, stale suspense scenes
and exuberant overacting, reflects the studio's
assumptions of what Americans want. But
the star power provided by Keifer Sutherland
and Jeff Bridges does little to relieve the ennui
of this flick.
Jeff Harriman (Sutherland) is a man
haunted by the mysterious disappearance of
his girlfriend on a lovers' getaway in the
Washington outback. But Sutherland's per
formance alternates between burbling like a
infant and staring blankly into space as
though he's had one too many all-nighters.
We feel nothing for his plight and don't be
lieve he's interested in finding his girlfriend
anyway.
Nancy Travis plays Harriman's new girl
friend, Rita, but it's hard to believe that any
one would hook up with a guy who moans,
whines and can't stop appearing on news
shows talking about his old girlfriend. Forced
to utter such intense lines as: "I fight. My fam
ily has either ended up either on Prozac or
with liver disease, so I fight," her feisty
woman-who-don't-take-no-crap role is ulti
mately flat and unengaging.
Bridges, meanwhile, stars as Barney — yes,
that's his name — and this otherwise-capable
actor reduces what was a complex perfor
mance by Bernard Donnadieu (the villain in
the 1988 version) into a flop-haired goof who
is as menacing as the purple dinosaur called
Barney seen on PBS. Donnadieu had a lika
bility, humor and intelligence that was
charming, yet unsettling as he revealed him
self to be more than the upright family man

he appeared to be.
It's clear that most of the blame lies with
screenwriter Todd Graff, who decided to
chuck the psychological insights in the origi
nal and replace them with standard '90s
thriller devices such as axes, flying two-by
fours and hands reaching menacingly
through windows. The original film wouldn't
draw the "Fatal Attraction" crowd, yet it con
vincingly portrayed a man consumed by
guilt, love and raw curiosity as his search for a
missing woman became an obsession.
Stripped of these nuances, the new version
simply limps along from scene to scene, with
no believable characters or situations. It's
hard to believe that Sluizer directed both ver
sions, because some of the most powerful vi
sual scenes in the original are nowhere to be
found. Perhaps, under studio pressure, Sluiz
er resigned himself to becoming a total sell
out.
However, the always insightful 20th Cen
tury Fox has decided to victimize the opening
weekend of unsuspecting moviegoers by re
leasing the film without media coverage,
showing that even they know what a bomb
they have on their hands.

Estevez' sculpted
butt cannot save
'Naked Gun' copy

Loaded Weapon I

Toward the end of "National Lampoon's
Loaded Weapon I," hero Emilio Estevez walks
across a pier and passes Popeye, who is then
carted off by gun-toting thugs.
Oh, I see. Random pop-culture reference

equals humor. That's funny.
If you have time, after seeing another
movie like "Scent of a Woman," to sneak in to
the auditorium where "Loaded Weapon" is
playing, by all means do it. But if you're too
honest to do that, skip it and wait until the in
evitable sequels to funnier parodies such as
"Naked Gun" or "Wayne's World" come out.
Like Mel Gibson's character in the "Lethal
Weapon" films that "Loaded Weapon" sati
rizes, Jack Colt (Estevez) lives on the edge.
The loss of his partner — a dog — haunts
him.
Wes Lugar — played by Samuel L. Jackson,
who turned in a mesmerizing performance in
"Jungle Fever" as Wesley Snipes' crackhead
brother — teams up with Colt to solve the
murder of Lugar's former partner, played in a
not-too-funny cameo by Whoopi Goldberg.
The plot involves some scheme to smuggle
drugs by turning cocaine into "Wilderness
Girls" cookies. But as in the "Lethal Weapon"
movies, the plot's not that important. The fun
here is finding all the details in the back
ground, especially in the police station and at
the scene of Goldberg's murder.
Some of the sight gags, such as Estevez with
a sculpted butt and a low-budget organ trans
plant, are laugh-out-loud funny. And the
opening gunfire orgy at a convenience store
effectively sends up the cartoonish violence of
many contemporary shoot-'em-up movies.
Watch for some hilarious cameos by James
Doohan ("Star Trek" 's Scotty) and the distin
guished F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus" '
Salieri) as the cannibalistic Dr. Harold Leach
er.
Other potentially funny roles disappoint,
though. Estevez can't match Leslie Nielsen's
perfect deadpan approach, and his brother
Charlie Sheen — the star of "Hot Shots!" —
soaks up all the energy during his two min
utes on screen.
William Shatner, as the evil General Mor

tars, also could have had fun with his villain
ous character. Instead, his comedic approach
is virtually indistinguishable from his sup
posedly serious performance as Captain Kirk
in "Star Trek." And as a parody of the obnox
ious sidekick played by Joe Pesci in the "Lethal
Weapon" series, "Saturday Night Live" alum
Jon Lovitz doesn't leave much of an impres
sion.
Many of the comic bits are retreads of
those in other films, such as the "beaver" pun
and fascination with body chalk drawings in
"Naked Gun."
"Weapon" wants to be "Wayne's World,"
"Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots!" all wrapped
into one, but doesn't quite make it While it
may not reach the comedic heights of its part
ners in parody, it does sport one treat the oth
ers don't: Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox in a
glorious reprisal of their roles in "CHiPs."

Love Field

Coming only several months after the
largest riots in American history, "Love
Field" is a syrupy and slick film that treats
our country's racial problems with the com
plexity of a Harlequin romance and grabs
your heart at the expense of your brain.
The movie begins promisingly, with
Michelle Pfeiffer as a chatty Texas housewife
in the 19605, who simply adores all things
Kennedy. Coiffed with stunning peroxide-Ji

blond hair, the ever-distracted Lurene Hallett
ecstatically unfurls the American flag at her
house, rushes to the airport to welcome the
first family and fails, only to be stricken by
news of the Kennedy assassination.
Heartbroken yet undeterred, Lurene de
cides to trek alone from Dallas to Washington
to see the presidential funeral, despite the
protestations of her husband, Ray, who is
played by a bewildered Brian Kerwin. On the
bus to D.C., Lurene encounters a black man,
Paul (Dennis Haybert) and his daughter, nei
ther of whom seem interested in talking to
her.
This engaging setup then collapses into
predictable formula with a storybook vision of
race relations that evokes the schmaltz of a
Disney film, which will leave some feeling
touched, and others offended and angry.
Nevertheless, "Love Field" will probably be
a gold mine at the box office, with critics yam
mering on with comments like "feel-good
movie of the year," "makes you want to cheer"
and other such nonsense. Some have already
clamored for an Academy Award for Pfeiffer in
this candy-cane flick.
"Love Field" epitomizes the school of non
challenging, "Kindergarten Cop" filmmaking.

Director Jonathan Kaplan ("The Accused")
keeps the pace brisk so the audience doesn't get
too bored. Fights, chases and slick cuts eliminate
the need to develop the characters or their rela
tionships with each other. Lurene and Paul, both
blessed with divine good looks and lacking any
rough edges, are easily digested by the audience.
Prejudice is a source of cute humor and ac
tion in the film, but by not treating it as the ma
lignant problem that it is, or offering any
thoughtful solutions, screenwriter Don Roos
merely exploits it for easy entertainment.
So, we get such trite homilies as: white red
necks should not be allowed to beat up up
standing, handsome black men, and yes, even
with the New Frontier, black folks were having
minor problems with things like racism and
poverty. These highly disturbing, cosmos
shaking insights should provide catharsis for
those who prefer their movies' political mes
sages safe and comfortable.
"Love Field" could have wrestled with the
nature of racism and the possibility of having a
decent human relationship in a sick, preju
diced society. If you like your films happy and
sweet, then this film will easily leave you smil
ing. But if you want a film that is unafraid to
deal in realities and hard truths, then watch
something else.

Civil War Soldier
changed man, or
charismatic fake?

Sommersby

When a Confederate soldier, long presumed
dead, returns home from the Gvil War, is he a
changed man or charming impostor? In "Som
mersby," Jack Sommersby (Richard Gere) keeps
his small town —and the audience — guessing.
Plagued by a strange case of Yankee-induced
amnesia, Sommersby raisessuspicions when he
can't remember certain key details, such as the
name of his best friend. But the town is more
shocked by Sommersb/s transformation from
irresponsible gambler to hard-working, poet
ry-reading, socially-enlightened, all-around
sensitive guy.
Even Sommersby s long-suffering wife, Lau
rel (Jodie Foster), can't believe that he's the
same man. Neither can a Nashville judge
(James Earl Jones), who is called in when al
leged war crimes come back to haunt our hero.
By the time the verdict is pronounced,

there's not a dry eye in the courtroom, never
mind the theater. This is mostly due to incisive
performances by Gere and Foster, who lends
fierce dignity to such overwrought lines as, "I
never loved him the way that I love you."
Bill Pullman is deliriously distraught as the
lovelorn Orin, whose puppyish devotion to Lau
rel turns to bitterness when her husband returns.
"I ate my own heart like a piece of spoiled meat,"
he tells her in one particularly memorable scene.
Unfortunately, screenwriters Nicholas
Meyer and Sarah Kernochan give few details of
Sommersby s diabolical former self, via con
spicuously-dropped hints of abuse, alcoholism
and general unpleasantness. In addition, the
plot unravels as its themes of deception and
self-deception become increasingly complex.
But this unraveling takes on near-hypnotic
qualities under Jon Amiel's direction. Despite
the grandeur of the war-torn towns and lush to
bacco fields that litter its mountainous land
scape, "Sommersby" finds tragic beauty in inti
mate scenes — a bathtub, a barn, a baptism.
"The Return of Martin Guerre," the French
film on which it is based, was set in 16th-cen
tury France, and loses little in its translation to
1860's Tennessee. War — any war — is a
metaphor for change, whether it be individ
ual, societal or, as in "Sommersby," both.

Civil War Soldier
changed man, or
charismatic fake?

Sommersby

When a Confederate soldier, long presumed
dead, returns home from the Gvil War, is he a
changed man or charming impostor? In "Som
mersby," Jack Sommersby (Richard Gere) keeps
his small town —and the audience — guessing.
Plagued by a strange case of Yankee-induced
amnesia, Sommersby raisessuspicions when he
can't remember certain key details, such as the
name of his best friend. But the town is more
shocked by Sommersb/s transformation from
irresponsible gambler to hard-working, poet
ry-reading, socially-enlightened, all-around
sensitive guy.
Even Sommersby s long-suffering wife, Lau
rel (Jodie Foster), can't believe that he's the
same man. Neither can a Nashville judge
(James Earl Jones), who is called in when al
leged war crimes come back to haunt our hero.
By the time the verdict is pronounced,

there's not a dry eye in the courtroom, never
mind the theater. This is mostly due to incisive
performances by Gere and Foster, who lends
fierce dignity to such overwrought lines as, "I
never loved him the way that I love you."
Bill Pullman is deliriously distraught as the
lovelorn Orin, whose puppyish devotion to Lau
rel turns to bitterness when her husband returns.
"I ate my own heart like a piece of spoiled meat,"
he tells her in one particularly memorable scene.
Unfortunately, screenwriters Nicholas
Meyer and Sarah Kernochan give few details of
Sommersby s diabolical former self, via con
spicuously-dropped hints of abuse, alcoholism
and general unpleasantness. In addition, the
plot unravels as its themes of deception and
self-deception become increasingly complex.
But this unraveling takes on near-hypnotic
qualities under Jon Amiel's direction. Despite
the grandeur of the war-torn towns and lush to
bacco fields that litter its mountainous land
scape, "Sommersby" finds tragic beauty in inti
mate scenes — a bathtub, a barn, a baptism.
"The Return of Martin Guerre," the French
film on which it is based, was set in 16th-cen

The Vanishing

Director George Sluizer should be forced
to commit hara-kiri for his dreadful Ameri
can reincarnation of "The Vanishing," espe
cially since he directed the tightly-crafted
1988 European version, which American crit
ics praised for its simple yet disturbing story.
Perhaps this venture into the mainstream,
with its limp dialogue, stale suspense scenes
and exuberant overacting, reflects the studio's
assumptions of what Americans want. But
the star power provided by Keifer Sutherland
and Jeff Bridges does little to relieve the ennui
of this flick.
Jeff Harriman (Sutherland) is a man
haunted by the mysterious disappearance of
his girlfriend on a lovers' getaway in the
Washington outback. But Sutherland's per
formance alternates between burbling like a
infant and staring blankly into space as
though he's had one too many all-nighters.
We feel nothing for his plight and don't be
lieve he's interested in finding his girlfriend
anyway.
Nancy Travis plays Harriman's new girl
friend, Rita, but it's hard to believe that any
one would hook up with a guy who moans,
whines and can't stop appearing on news
shows talking about his old girlfriend. Forced
to utter such intense lines as: "I fight. My fam
ily has either ended up either on Prozac or
with liver disease, so I fight," her feisty
woman-who-don't-take-no-crap role is ulti
mately flat and unengaging.
Bridges, meanwhile, stars as Barney — yes,
that's his name — and this otherwise-capable
actor reduces what was a complex perfor
mance by Bernard Donnadieu (the villain in
the 1988 version) into a flop-haired goof who
is as menacing as the purple dinosaur called
Barney seen on PBS. Donnadieu had a lika
bility, humor and intelligence that was
charming, yet unsettling as he revealed him
self to be more than the upright family man

he appeared to be.
It's clear that most of the blame lies with
screenwriter Todd Graff, who decided to
chuck the psychological insights in the origi
nal and replace them with standard '90s
thriller devices such as axes, flying two-by
fours and hands reaching menacingly
through windows. The original film wouldn't
draw the "Fatal Attraction" crowd, yet it con
vincingly portrayed a man consumed by
guilt, love and raw curiosity as his search for a
missing woman became an obsession.
Stripped of these nuances, the new version
simply limps along from scene to scene, with
no believable characters or situations. It's
hard to believe that Sluizer directed both ver
sions, because some of the most powerful vi
sual scenes in the original are nowhere to be
found. Perhaps, under studio pressure, Sluiz

out.

Estevez' sculpted

'Naked Gun' copy

Loaded Weapon I

Toward the end of "National Lampoon's
Loaded Weapon I," hero Emilio Estevez walks
across a pier and passes Popeye, who is then
carted off by gun-toting thugs.
Oh, I see. Random pop-culture reference

equals humor. That's funny.
If you have time, after seeing another
movie like "Scent of a Woman," to sneak in to
the auditorium where "Loaded Weapon" is
playing, by all means do it. But if you're too
honest to do that, skip it and wait until the in
evitable sequels to funnier parodies such as
"Naked Gun" or "Wayne's World" come out.
Like Mel Gibson's character in the "Lethal
Weapon" films that "Loaded Weapon" sati
rizes, Jack Colt (Estevez) lives on the edge.
The loss of his partner — a dog — haunts
him.
Wes Lugar — played by Samuel L. Jackson,
who turned in a mesmerizing performance in
"Jungle Fever" as Wesley Snipes' crackhead
brother — teams up with Colt to solve the
murder of Lugar's former partner, played in a
not-too-funny cameo by Whoopi Goldberg.
The plot involves some scheme to smuggle
drugs by turning cocaine into "Wilderness
Girls" cookies. But as in the "Lethal Weapon"
movies, the plot's not that important. The fun
here is finding all the details in the back
ground, especially in the police station and at
the scene of Goldberg's murder.
Some of the sight gags, such as Estevez with
a sculpted butt and a low-budget organ trans
plant, are laugh-out-loud funny. And the
opening gunfire orgy at a convenience store
effectively sends up the cartoonish violence of
many contemporary shoot-'em-up movies.
Watch for some hilarious cameos by James
Doohan ("Star Trek" 's Scotty) and the distin
guished F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus" '
Salieri) as the cannibalistic Dr. Harold Leach
er.
Other potentially funny roles disappoint,
though. Estevez can't match Leslie Nielsen's
perfect deadpan approach, and his brother
Charlie Sheen — the star of "Hot Shots!" —
soaks up all the energy during his two min
utes on screen.
William Shatner, as the evil General Mor

tars, also could have had fun with his villain
ous character. Instead, his comedic approach
is virtually indistinguishable from his sup
posedly serious performance as Captain Kirk
in "Star Trek." And as a parody of the obnox
ious sidekick played by Joe Pesci in the "Lethal
Weapon" series, "Saturday Night Live" alum
Jon Lovitz doesn't leave much of an impres
sion.
Many of the comic bits are retreads of
those in other films, such as the "beaver" pun
and fascination with body chalk drawings in
"Naked Gun."
"Weapon" wants to be "Wayne's World,"
"Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots!" all wrapped
into one, but doesn't quite make it While it
may not reach the comedic heights of its part

Civil War Soldier
changed man, or
charismatic fake?

Sommersby

When a Confederate soldier, long presumed
dead, returns home from the Gvil War, is he a
changed man or charming impostor? In "Som
mersby," Jack Sommersby (Richard Gere) keeps
his small town —and the audience — guessing.
Plagued by a strange case of Yankee-induced
amnesia, Sommersby raisessuspicions when he
can't remember certain key details, such as the
name of his best friend. But the town is more
shocked by Sommersb/s transformation from
irresponsible gambler to hard-working, poet
ry-reading, socially-enlightened, all-around
sensitive guy.
Even Sommersby s long-suffering wife, Lau
rel (Jodie Foster), can't believe that he's the
same man. Neither can a Nashville judge
(James Earl Jones), who is called in when al
leged war crimes come back to haunt our hero.
By the time the verdict is pronounced,

there's not a dry eye in the courtroom, never
mind the theater. This is mostly due to incisive
performances by Gere and Foster, who lends
fierce dignity to such overwrought lines as, "I
never loved him the way that I love you."
Bill Pullman is deliriously distraught as the
lovelorn Orin, whose puppyish devotion to Lau
rel turns to bitterness when her husband returns.
"I ate my own heart like a piece of spoiled meat,"
he tells her in one particularly memorable scene.
Unfortunately, screenwriters Nicholas
Meyer and Sarah Kernochan give few details of
Sommersby s diabolical former self, via con
spicuously-dropped hints of abuse, alcoholism
and general unpleasantness. In addition, the
plot unravels as its themes of deception and
self-deception become increasingly complex.
But this unraveling takes on near-hypnotic
qualities under Jon Amiel's direction. Despite
the grandeur of the war-torn towns and lush to
bacco fields that litter its mountainous land
scape, "Sommersby" finds tragic beauty in inti
mate scenes — a bathtub, a barn, a baptism.
"The Return of Martin Guerre," the French
film on which it is based, was set in 16th-cen
tury France, and loses little in its translation to
1860's Tennessee. War — any war — is a

ual, societal or, as in "Sommersby," both.

American remake
turns original hit
to bad Eurotrash

The Vanishing

Director George Sluizer should be forced
to commit hara-kiri for his dreadful Ameri
can reincarnation of "The Vanishing," espe
cially since he directed the tightly-crafted
1988 European version, which American crit
ics praised for its simple yet disturbing story.
Perhaps this venture into the mainstream,
with its limp dialogue, stale suspense scenes
and exuberant overacting, reflects the studio's
assumptions of what Americans want. But
the star power provided by Keifer Sutherland
and Jeff Bridges does little to relieve the ennui
of this flick.
Jeff Harriman (Sutherland) is a man
haunted by the mysterious disappearance of
his girlfriend on a lovers' getaway in the
Washington outback. But Sutherland's per
formance alternates between burbling like a
infant and staring blankly into space as
though he's had one too many all-nighters.
We feel nothing for his plight and don't be
lieve he's interested in finding his girlfriend
anyway.
Nancy Travis plays Harriman's new girl
friend, Rita, but it's hard to believe that any
one would hook up with a guy who moans,
whines and can't stop appearing on news
shows talking about his old girlfriend. Forced
to utter such intense lines as: "I fight. My fam
ily has either ended up either on Prozac or
with liver disease, so I fight," her feisty
woman-who-don't-take-no-crap role is ulti
mately flat and unengaging.
Bridges, meanwhile, stars as Barney — yes,
that's his name — and this otherwise-capable
actor reduces what was a complex perfor
mance by Bernard Donnadieu (the villain in
the 1988 version) into a flop-haired goof who
is as menacing as the purple dinosaur called
Barney seen on PBS. Donnadieu had a lika
bility, humor and intelligence that was
charming, yet unsettling as he revealed him
self to be more than the upright family man

he appeared to be.
It's clear that most of the blame lies with
screenwriter Todd Graff, who decided to
chuck the psychological insights in the origi
nal and replace them with standard '90s
thriller devices such as axes, flying two-by
fours and hands reaching menacingly
through windows. The original film wouldn't
draw the "Fatal Attraction" crowd, yet it con
vincingly portrayed a man consumed by
guilt, love and raw curiosity as his search for a
missing woman became an obsession.
Stripped of these nuances, the new version
simply limps along from scene to scene, with
no believable characters or situations. It's
hard to believe that Sluizer directed both ver
sions, because some of the most powerful vi
sual scenes in the original are nowhere to be
found. Perhaps, under studio pressure, Sluiz
er resigned himself to becoming a total sell
out.
However, the always insightful 20th Cen
tury Fox has decided to victimize the opening
weekend of unsuspecting moviegoers by re
leasing the film without media coverage,
showing that even they know what a bomb
they have on their hands.

Estevez' sculpted
butt cannot save
'Naked Gun' copy

Loaded Weapon I

Toward the end of "National Lampoon's
Loaded Weapon I," hero Emilio Estevez walks
across a pier and passes Popeye, who is then
carted off by gun-toting thugs.
Oh, I see. Random pop-culture reference

equals humor. That's funny.
If you have time, after seeing another
movie like "Scent of a Woman," to sneak in to
the auditorium where "Loaded Weapon" is
playing, by all means do it. But if you're too
honest to do that, skip it and wait until the in
evitable sequels to funnier parodies such as
"Naked Gun" or "Wayne's World" come out.
Like Mel Gibson's character in the "Lethal
Weapon" films that "Loaded Weapon" sati
rizes, Jack Colt (Estevez) lives on the edge.
The loss of his partner — a dog — haunts
him.
Wes Lugar — played by Samuel L. Jackson,
who turned in a mesmerizing performance in
"Jungle Fever" as Wesley Snipes' crackhead
brother — teams up with Colt to solve the
murder of Lugar's former partner, played in a
not-too-funny cameo by Whoopi Goldberg.
The plot involves some scheme to smuggle
drugs by turning cocaine into "Wilderness
Girls" cookies. But as in the "Lethal Weapon"
movies, the plot's not that important. The fun
here is finding all the details in the back
ground, especially in the police station and at
the scene of Goldberg's murder.
Some of the sight gags, such as Estevez with
a sculpted butt and a low-budget organ trans
plant, are laugh-out-loud funny. And the
opening gunfire orgy at a convenience store
effectively sends up the cartoonish violence of
many contemporary shoot-'em-up movies.
Watch for some hilarious cameos by James
Doohan ("Star Trek" 's Scotty) and the distin
guished F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus" '
Salieri) as the cannibalistic Dr. Harold Leach
er.
Other potentially funny roles disappoint,
though. Estevez can't match Leslie Nielsen's
perfect deadpan approach, and his brother
Charlie Sheen — the star of "Hot Shots!" —
soaks up all the energy during his two min
utes on screen.
William Shatner, as the evil General Mor

tars, also could have had fun with his villain
ous character. Instead, his comedic approach
is virtually indistinguishable from his sup
posedly serious performance as Captain Kirk
in "Star Trek." And as a parody of the obnox
ious sidekick played by Joe Pesci in the "Lethal
Weapon" series, "Saturday Night Live" alum
Jon Lovitz doesn't leave much of an impres
sion.
Many of the comic bits are retreads of
those in other films, such as the "beaver" pun
and fascination with body chalk drawings in
