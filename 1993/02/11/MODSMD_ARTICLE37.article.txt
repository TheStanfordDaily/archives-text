Doom and gloom
suffuse this new
magic carpet ride

Inspiral Carpets

It's all over, and Inspiral Carpets knows it.
Both the money and hype machines have left
Manchester to orbit around Seattle, and the
group's latest release, "Revenge Of The
Goldfish" strikes a pretty gloomy response.
Their jangley, swirly guitars have grown
feedback and sharp sustains. The Monkey's
keyboards have all but been mixed off the
album, except for some minor chord high
lights and one rather limited solo. The music
is still energetic, still '60's influenced, but the
tone is sour, and the lyrics have been reduced
to a self-absorbed Morriseyesque trip —
minus Morrisey's fun-loving spirit: "today i
stole the sun from the sky ... today i took
food from the hand of a starving child ...
what have i done with my life/ is this the
end."
Not that people should be criticized for

being angry, down or emotional — but
c'mon, suck it up Inspiral. If you're not
happy with your cushy Time-Warner deal,
go do something else, stop whining, it's the
'90's — it's tough all around.
Inspiral's keyboardist, Clint Boon, de
scribed "Revenge" as "very much a garage,
punk record." Yeah, right: three recording
studios, one of the world's largest labels and
producer Pascal Gabriel of EMF fame are re
ally what garage is all about.

Although, at times, there are hints of a
Damned-like keyboard lick, or a Killing Joke
vocal. But the Doors-on-more-drugs sound
of the Damned quickly becomes the
Damned-hooked-on-surftones sound of the
Inspiral Carpets. And the Killing Joke vocal
distortion over a tom-tom heavy drum pat
tern has become so hackneyed that Inspiral
Carpets would have to do more than just use
it to make their music distinctive.
The bio we got with the CD describes

"Revenge" as "passionate, and gloomy... fe
rocious and imbued.. .mournful and sweet,
accessible and oblique". This is an attempt to
cover up the lack of anything definitive, cre
ative or inventive — like Inspiral Carpets did
when the Manchester sound was just emerg
ing.
And indeed, included on the album is a
ballad, a hard rockesque track, some tracks
— some folksy, some modern rocky — they
try for the whole spectrum, but accomplish
it only with a thin sound, underdeveloped
and already overplayed.
Honestly, Inspiral Carpets is a tight band
with a lot of energy. But they're just not
going anywhere — they're the type of band
that will re-unite when someone from our
generation gets into the White House.

The Music Might
Be Good — Even If

King Missile

King Missile's music could be described
as reminiscent of They Might Be Giants.
How about a They Might Be Giants CD
played in Seattle to depressed people with
much longer attention spans.
Hey, King Missile doesn't make sense ei
ther.
In their current album "Happy Hour" —
featuring Live-105's novelty-track-of-the
month "Detachable Penis" — King Missile
offers a pseudo-teenage wrath sound, com
bined with a token grunge background of
screeching guitars, reverbed vocals and ram
bling lyrics.
The music's quality is, amazingly enough,
pretty good. Though King Missile accentu
ates the drums and guitars a little more than
