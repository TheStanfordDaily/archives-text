Doom and gloom
suffuse this new
magic carpet ride

Inspiral Carpets

It's all over, and Inspiral Carpets knows it.
Both the money and hype machines have left
Manchester to orbit around Seattle, and the
group's latest release, "Revenge Of The
Goldfish" strikes a pretty gloomy response.
Their jangley, swirly guitars have grown
feedback and sharp sustains. The Monkey's
keyboards have all but been mixed off the
album, except for some minor chord high
lights and one rather limited solo. The music
is still energetic, still '60's influenced, but the
tone is sour, and the lyrics have been reduced
to a self-absorbed Morriseyesque trip —
minus Morrisey's fun-loving spirit: "today i
stole the sun from the sky ... today i took
food from the hand of a starving child ...
what have i done with my life/ is this the
end."
Not that people should be criticized for

being angry, down or emotional — but
c'mon, suck it up Inspiral. If you're not
happy with your cushy Time-Warner deal,
go do something else, stop whining, it's the
'90's — it's tough all around.
Inspiral's keyboardist, Clint Boon, de
scribed "Revenge" as "very much a garage,
punk record." Yeah, right: three recording
studios, one of the world's largest labels and
producer Pascal Gabriel of EMF fame are re
ally what garage is all about.

Although, at times, there are hints of a
Damned-like keyboard lick, or a Killing Joke
vocal. But the Doors-on-more-drugs sound
of the Damned quickly becomes the
Damned-hooked-on-surftones sound of the
Inspiral Carpets. And the Killing Joke vocal
distortion over a tom-tom heavy drum pat
tern has become so hackneyed that Inspiral
Carpets would have to do more than just use
it to make their music distinctive.
The bio we got with the CD describes

"Revenge" as "passionate, and gloomy... fe
rocious and imbued.. .mournful and sweet,
accessible and oblique". This is an attempt to
cover up the lack of anything definitive, cre
ative or inventive — like Inspiral Carpets did
when the Manchester sound was just emerg
ing.
And indeed, included on the album is a
ballad, a hard rockesque track, some tracks
— some folksy, some modern rocky — they
try for the whole spectrum, but accomplish
it only with a thin sound, underdeveloped
and already overplayed.
Honestly, Inspiral Carpets is a tight band
with a lot of energy. But they're just not
going anywhere — they're the type of band
that will re-unite when someone from our
generation gets into the White House.

The Music Might
Be Good — Even If
Freud Dominates

King Missile

King Missile's music could be described
as reminiscent of They Might Be Giants.
How about a They Might Be Giants CD
played in Seattle to depressed people with
much longer attention spans.
Hey, King Missile doesn't make sense ei
ther.
In their current album "Happy Hour" —
featuring Live-105's novelty-track-of-the
month "Detachable Penis" — King Missile
offers a pseudo-teenage wrath sound, com
bined with a token grunge background of
screeching guitars, reverbed vocals and ram
bling lyrics.
The music's quality is, amazingly enough,
pretty good. Though King Missile accentu
ates the drums and guitars a little more than

your normal pop clone, their sound
does not churn together as that of so
many garbage-disposal-imitating
groups of late.
Several of the songs featured will
come to an alternative-rock station
near you faster than you can say "sell
out." As the first band in a long time
to bring the female anatomy into the

spotlight, Missile's "Vulva Void"
seems only a near-miss off the "Sin
gles" album, with a trendy, rock
background complemented by '70s
esque hooting vocals.
"(Why are we) Trapped" also
could snatch some serious airplay
during "alternative track" radio
shows, destroying Missile's potential
to be one of the multitude of one-hit
bands to streak through the modern
rock world.
And the lyrics are random.

Not quite as random as They
Might Be Giants, yet not as main
stream as R.E.M., King Missile pro
duces poetry of the dejected. "De
tachable Penis" typifies the kind of
warped lyrical concepts make this
album worthwhile. Lead singer John
S. Halls whiny, barely-post-pubes
cent vocals add an air of desperation
to the unpredictable lines he speaks
and occasionally sings.
Missile's songs explore what seem
to be the thoughts of psychopaths,

sharing the wonderful twistedness of
it all with the audience, presented
with a calm delivery. "Take Me
Home" gives believable insight into
the mind of an individual looking to
be tormented. The singer asks for the
listener to "Take me home/Take me
home and spit in my face... Take me
home and kick me hard/'Cause
you're the one I trust enough ... I
want you to give me what I deserve."
Yes, another troubled youth. A
pity.

Filled with morose, yet nonsensi
cal songs, "Happy Hour" leaves the
listener to ponder the deeper, Freudi
an meanings of their work, to suck
the alleged marrow, the psychologi
cal underpinnings from Missiles cre
ations.
Overall, the style varies and the
quality is better-than-average, singling
King Missile out as a solid band in an
ephemeral alternative-rock scene.
