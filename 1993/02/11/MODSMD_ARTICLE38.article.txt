Past Daily staffer
takes a close look
at film in the '80s

No Surprises, Please

The '80s have been characterized as a decade of
rampant greed and excess. These traits permeated
every part of American culture, inevitably mani
festing themselves in the movies. Stanford alum
nus and former Daily film critic Steve Vinebergs
"No Surprises, Please: Movies in the Reagan
Decade," a collection of movie reviews and critical
essays, sifts through the wasteland of '80s films,
searching for the few than are worth preserving.
Vineberg suggests that in every era, there are
films that are Zeitgeist films — they capture the

spirit of their era. For instance, the cinema of the
'70s immediately brings to mind "M*A*S*H,"
"The Godfather" and "Taxi Driver," all films that
emerged from a subversive, demythologizing
mood shared by filmmakers and moviegoers alike.
By the next decade, truly original and perceptive
films were shoved aside as the public hastened to
pre-ordained blockbusters that were morally vacu
ous and slickly rhetorical. Worse, these same films
were often heralded by critics as examples of excep
tional filmmaking and showered with awards.
Vineberg writes in the tradition of former New
Yorker critic Pauline Kael — he's just as passionate
and eloquent, but a shade less contentious. Like
Kael, he is one of the few critics to champion Brian
DePalma's "Casualties of over more univer
sally acclaimed films like "Platoon" and "Born on
the Fourth of July." And he defends DePalma
against the ever-present charge of misogyny by
saying that critics confused DePalma's mindset
with that of his characters.
But Vineberg conveniently abandons this defense

when criticizing Spike Lees "Do the Right Thing,"
calling it a "racist rabble-rouser of a movie." He feels
queasy about the destruction of Sal's pizzeria but ne
glects to discuss the murder of Radio Raheem.
Vineberg also finds it problematic that Mookie,
played by Lee, leads the attack on the restaurant
Who's confusing directors with characters now?
But Vineberg's more insightful analyses manage
to convince his audience of his opinions even when
the reader doesn't agree with them. He wittily de
constructs "Sex, Lies and Videotape," which, on the
surface, seems like an innovative film, but is actual
ly a post-AIDS morality play which blithely cham
pions monogamy and sexual honesty.
"No Surprises, Please" captures the best and
worst movie events of the '80s. More importantly,
it enables us to understand how those films inter
acted with mass culture, by grounding them firm
ly in the context of their release. Steve Vineberg is
living proof that the legacy of Pauline Kael will
survive another generation.
