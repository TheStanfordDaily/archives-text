Aladdin
As children, we gulped formula down
like there was no tomorrow. Disney's
new hit causes us to regress and
swallow 80 minutes worth of the stuff.
Robin Williams voices the irrepress
ible Genie; he's the only reason the
film is even watchable. Vet derivative
sonas and a tired boy-meets-girl plot
don t seem to be keeping people
away from this animated atrocity. Oh
well. There's always "The Simpsons"
on Thursday night. G
Alive
Several members of a Uruguayan
rugby team struggle to survive a
plane crash in the snow-covered
Andes. Based on a novel that is in
turn based on a true story, the sur
vivors are forced to cannibalize their
dead. The harrowing details are the
film's strength, but sweeping scores
and slick action sequences under
mine the gritty realism. A mostly-suc
cessful docudrama. R
Bad Lieutenant
A cokehead cop played by Harvey Kei
tel tries to redeem himself by catching
some kids who raped a nun with a cru
cifix. A relentlessly shallow film with just
one powerful scene: the degrading
sexual humiliation of two teenage girls
at the hand of the Lieutenant. Writer-di
rector Abel Ferrara should be forced to
masturbate at gunpoint to atone for this
schlock-fest. NC-17
Body of Evidence
Madonna plays a Portland gallery
owner on trial for murdering her el
derly millionaire lawyer with sex and
a little cocaine on the side. Her
lawyer (Willem Dafoe) gets entan
gled in her case and in her bed.
Tawdry S&M tableaux and an unlike

ly plot leaves "Body of Evidence" as
nothing more than a giant infomercial
for "Sex." R
■ Children of the Corn II
How crazy are these cornfield-stalk
ing kids? Not red-wine-with-fish, top
less-at-Tresidder crazy. They're kill
your-parents, demon-worship kind of
crazy. In this surprisingly superior se-
Suel, the murderous little tykes of
iatlin have been adopted by families
in the neighboring town. But we all
know thaf s a recipe for unsuspect
ing victims waiting to be killed in new
and inventive ways. The sex scene
with a severed hand is not to be
missed. R
■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's got
America abuzz? Well you won't find
out, unless you see writer-director Neil
Jordan's offbeat hit. Stephen Rea, For
est Whitaker and newcomer Jaye
Davidson are at the top of their game in
this brilliant web of love and intngue in
volving the IRA, a British soldier and an
enigmatic hairdresser. Shades of "Ver
tigo," it's a definite must-see. R
A Few Good Men
A few bad hams, namely ruthless
scene-chewers Tom Cruise and Jack
Nicholson, star in this turgid court
room drama. The plot is simple: a ma
rine cadet has been killed, and de
fense lawyer Daniel Kaffee (Cruise)
must prove that Col. Jessep (Nichol
son) ordered the attack in order to
save the defendants from the death
penalty. Writer Aaron Sorkin and di
rector Rob Reiner ("Misery") drain all
the suspense from the film, leaving
only two-and-a-half hours of shame
less overacting. Rent Stanley
Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" instead. R

■ Flirting
If you ever went to boarding school
and fell in love with fhat beautiful but
brainy girl from your sister institu
tion, then this is the film for you.
Writer-director John Duigan realisti
cally renders this tale of interracial
love and sexual awakening in rural
Australia. Actor Noah Taylor, who
returns in this sequel to the ac
claimed film "The Year My Voice
Broke," and newcomer Thandie
Newton share an incredible amount
of chemistry, which translates into a
moving romance. An excellent alter
native to "The Bodyguard." Not
Rated
■ Matinee
Part teen flick, part horror spoof and
part nuclear scare, the film manages
to turn a flimsy plot into an entertain
ing B-movie. John Goodman stars as
Woolsey, a schlock-film director/pro
ducer whose Key West world pre
miere of "MANT!" — Half Man ...
Half Ant... All Terror!!! — coincides
with the threat of global thermonu
clear war. So the always enterprising
Woolsey schemes to use the resi
dents' fears to hype his flick. Good
fun. PG-13
■ Man Bites Dog
An impoverished film crew follows a
serial-killer in mock-documentary style
as he knocks off victims and dumps
the bodies. The plot thickens as the
crew transforms from observers to ac
complices in an effort to finance the
documentary's completion. Violence
over-shadows comedic aspects, leav
ing the audience more disturbed than
entertained. Not Rated
■ A River Runs Through It
Robert Redford has sensitively

adapted writer Norman Maclean s
acclaimed novella for the big screen.
Craig Sheffer plays the pensive,
brooding Norman, and Tom Skerritt
successfully tackles the role of Nor
man's restrained father. But as in
"Thelma and Louise," Brad Pitt walks
off with the film in his turn as Nor
man's joyfully self-destructive broth
er. Philippe Housselot's cinematog
raphy bathes Montana in a warm,
golden glow that will undoubtedly
send older viewers into nostalgic
reveries. PG
Scent of a Woman
Al Pacino stars as Colonel Slade, a
blind, bitter and irascible war veteran
who tricks his prep-school student
"babysitter" (Chris O'Donnell) into
taking him to New York for one last
party before he blows his brains out.
Pacino amazes, but his blind "Rag
ing Bull" performance gets mired in a
feel-good "Dead Poets Society." The
film only succeeds as a showcase for
one of the world's greatest living ac
tors. R
Sniper
Corman protege Uuis Losa's vaunt
ed directorial skills can't rescue this
"Apocalypse Now" wannabe. Tom
Berenger plays marine sniper
Thomas Beckett, whose mission to
assassinate a Panamanian General
is complicated by the presence of
Washington flatfoot Richard Miller
(Billy Zane.) Miller is an Olympic-level
marksman who wants to advance his
career. Their personalities clash,
their teeth gnash, and we'd like to
throw them out with the trash. A
deadly bore. R
