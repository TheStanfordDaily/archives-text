# Bookstore to sell vacation home
## Pricey perk on the market for 'ambitious' $425,000 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Priced at $425,000, the Stanford
Bookstore's luxurious Twain Harte vaca
tion home has been placed on the market
in an attempt to recover funds poured
into the retreat for top employees.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, interim
president of the Bookstore's board of di
rectors, called the price tag "ambitious"
but not exorbitant.
"It may or may not sell at a reasonable
price," Weisberg said, adding that the
board has not set a deadline for unload
ing the four-bedroom, two-story house
in central California.
The vacation home — which boasts a
hot tub, redwood deck and sunken living
room — was one of the perquisites pro
vided to senior Bookstore employees that
raised eyebrows when reported in The
Daily a year ago.
Since 1986, the Bookstore had paid
$179,000 in rent for the house, spent

more than $69,000 for furnishings and
improvements — including the hot tub
and a satellite dish — and forked over an
additional $31,800 for property taxes, in
surance, utilities and cleaning.
The payments went to Colleague
Management Services, a consulting firm
privately owned and operated by the
Bookstore's top managers, Eldon Speed
and Philip Chiaramonte. The house is
owned by the firm.
In deciding how to split up the funds
from the sale, Weisberg said money paid
for the use of the house will instead be
considered equity payments, making the
Bookstore a part owner of the house. The
fair-market rental value during the time
it was used by store employees will be
subtracted from the Bookstore's share,
he said.
"Eldon Speed and Philip Chiara
monte agree entirely that a very large
fraction of the sale should go to the Book
store," Weisberg said, adding that the
managers have been "very cooperative."

Speed and Chiaramonte did not re
turn phone calls yesterday.
Since the Bookstore completed its in
ternal audit last May, the plan has been
to work out some way for Colleagues
Management Services to return the
money the Bookstore put into the house,
Weisberg said.
Other options included having Speed
and Chiaramonte pay money back with
out giving up the house, or having the
Bookstore buy it themselves, he said.
"Right now it appears to be best to sell
the house to a third party."
Last March, the board decided em
ployees would no longer be permitted to
vacation at the home. Instead, they al
lowed a commercial rental agency to sub
let the house.
"I don't think [subletting] has been
very successful," Weisberg said, blaming
the "depression in the real estate market"
for vacationers' less than enthusiastic
response. The board decided in
early January to sell the house.
The Bookstore's board is also
in the process of expanding under
a new governance structure
approved last November by its
association, a 36-member group
of faculty, staff and students. The
association, which had little con
trol over the Bookstore's opera
tions, voted to abolish itself and
add to the five-member board of
directors.
The board — now composed of
seven people — will formally
solicit applications to fill eight
more slots, according to Weisberg.
The directors hope to vote on new
members by next fall.
Weisberg also hopes to estab
lish an unofficial advisory com
mittee of students, faculty and

staff that would meet at least
once a year to express their opin
ions.
With the original structure of
the board, overseeing the store
"became an anachronism," he
said, because it developed into "a
vast retail enterprise, but the
board never grew in number or
expertise."
The association "had responsi
bility without power or authori
ty," according to Weisberg. The
major problem leading to the
furor over employee compensa
tion was "the lack of rigorous gov
ernance" by the board.
The two newest members of
the board are Robert Augsburger,
a lecturer at the Graduate School
of Business, and Albert Hastorf,
professor emeritus of psychology
and former University provost.
Weisberg said the board now
contains some "extremely experi
enced business people," who will
help "transform the Bookstore."
