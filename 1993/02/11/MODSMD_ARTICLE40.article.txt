Three days "till V-day and
you're either loving life or
hating those in love. Fortu
nately, videos come in sever
al genres: cozy-up-with-significant
other and kick-back-and-laugh-at
the-futility-of- relationships.
For lovebirds:
If the last time you were in love
was high school, but you're still op
timistic, check out John Hughes'
16 Candles or Pretty in Pink.
Particularly inviting for all those
with redhead fetishes, these Molly
Ringwald classics capture all the
sappiness that is young love, with a
good measure of humor thrown in.
Who could forget the lovable An
thony Michael Hall relentlessly
pursuing his carrot-topped fantasy,
and even displaying her underwear
to his nerdy friends in the high
school restroom? And the equally
undiscouraged "Ducky"? Fairy tale
love stories from high school times.
For something a little less realistic,
rent Walt Disney*s recent classic Beau
ty and the Beast Superb animation
and an Academy award-winning
soundtrack make this a delight for the
eyes and ears, as well as the heart.
For those with more morbid love
fantasies, check out Ghost, the
movie that saved pottery classes from
budget cuts at community colleges,
or Dying Young, with Julia Roberts
as nurse-turned-companion.
For the bitter types:
For those undergoing a painful
break-up, take solace in Kramer v.
Kramer or War of the Roses.
"War" is a divorce fiasco staring
Michael Douglas and Kathleen
Turner as husband and wife, and

Danny Devito as a witty divorce
lawyer-narrator.
Bitter to the very end, this flick fea
tures such unforgettable scenes as
Turner driving her 4 by 4 over Dou
glas' prized vintage sportscar, and
Douglas urinating on Turner's
seafood dish carefully prepared for a
dinner party. Should make any
break-up woes seem petty.
If you think you've had a hard
time getting away from that guy
with the pocket protector, check
out Sleeping with the Enemy.
Julia Roberts fashions an elaborate
faked death at sea to elude posses
sive, manipulative and neurotic
husband Patrick Bertin. Roberts
escapes from their secluded ocean
front mansion to small town U.S.A.
and meets wholesome-boy-next
door, but apparently the getaway
wasn't clean enough. A thriller.
If you're disillusioned—as well as
bitter — try Mambo Kings, a story
of two young Cubans who come to
America looking for love and happi
ness, but find only bitterness.
If you haven't quite hooked up
with that special someone yet, take
heart in sex, lies and videotape.
At least you're not as bad off as Gra
ham, played by James Spader, who
can't perform when he's with a
woman, so he videotapes them talk
ing about their sexual experiences.
Strained by an interracial rela
tionship? Try Spike Lee's Jungle
Fever. For the truly morbid, check
out The Cook, The Thief, His
Wife and Her Lover. And for the
old-timers, there's always
Casablanca and Gone with the
Wind. Don't forget the Kleenex.
