## Young Disciples 
### 
Take soul, rap, rhythm and blues, jazz, and funk,
and stick it all together with the glue of Hip-hop
and dance and what you get is Young Disciples,
the UK's latest radio and club masters.
Co-runners of a mobile deejay unit, this British
duo hooked up with the JB's, James Brown's back
up band, released their first single and shot to the
top of the English charts. As the word about the
Disciples spread, they began working with A Tribe
Called Quest, Mary J. Blige and The Dream War
riors.
Acclaimed for their message as well as their
music, the Young Disciples range from short and
powerful beats to soulful ballads behind the guest
vocals of rapper Master Ace, British rap group
Brothers Like Outlaw and singer Carleen Anderson.
Their music offers a collage of styles, beats and
colors that hopes to bring forth a celebration of
the duality of life.
