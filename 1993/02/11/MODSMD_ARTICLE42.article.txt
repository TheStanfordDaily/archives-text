For a night full of chaotic, quirky quips and
rasta-mosh fuzz-busting, twitch on down to the
Kennel Club on Feb. 12 for Ween, King Missile,
Sister Double Happiness and Monks of Doom.
Ween, touring behind the release of its third
album, "Pure Guava," is nothing short of two
wacked-out guys named Dean and Gene spouting
off homespun ditties with titles like "I Saw Gener
Cryin' in His Sleep," and "Reggaejunkiejew." Com
bined with King Missile, these two bands are
enough to make prolific pranksters They Might Be
Giants look like upstanding citizens.
The Kennel Club is located at 628 Divisidero in SF.
