# The
						last word on...
## ... cookies 
### 
Okay, it was me who ate all the frosted an
imal cookies out of the bag.
I did it, and I'm man enough to admit it. I
even licked all the sprinkles out of the bot
tom of the bag. Because really now, frosted
animal cookies are the best.
Hey, Oreos... they're cool.
E.L. Fudge ... not bad.
And Chips Ahoy... well, if you can't have

chocolate chip cookies fresh, you might as
well not have them at all.
It's animal cookies — in all their diverse
glory — that truly fulfill.
Not the wimpy ones, mind you.
None of those oat bran, no preservatives,
sweetened with fruit juice mutant things.
No, no. We're talking good oF pink and
white, covered with little colored candy

dots, lions, tigers and bears oh my.
They're festive.
They're colorful.
They're fun to play with.
They're bad for you.
They're what cookies are meant to be.
And to be quite honest, if it isn't an ani
mal cookie, then it isn't worth the effort.
