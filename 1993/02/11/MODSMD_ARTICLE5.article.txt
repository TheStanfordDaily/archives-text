# Storage removal upsets EV residents
## 
### Grace Lee Michael Slemmer Staff writers 
Faced with the possibility of having to
find new storage spaces by summer,
many Escondido Village residents are
irked. And storage is only the latest in a
string of problems that have left some
graduate students struggling for change.
The students will discuss storage, this
summer's elimination of pediatric care
at Cowell Student Health Center and
other issues tonight in an Escondido
"town hall meeting."
The possible removal of additional
storage space — such as aluminum sheds
— at Escondido was announced by Facil
ities officials two weeks ago at a meeting
of graduate resident assistants. Stu
dents may be asked to dismantle by July
all storage sheds as well as makeshift
awnings placed over their patios.
"The decision about the storage sheds
was really the last straw," said Raoul

Diaz, the husband of a graduate student.
"Certainly nobody asked our opinion
about it. It was just an autocratic deci
sion."
But according to Christine Griffith,
director of graduate residences, "There
hasn't been a firm decision on the re
moval of the sheds."
However, "there has been some dis
cussion initiated in the Facilities area
about the need to have the storage areas
examined" due to concerns over such is
sues as fire safety, aesthetics and equity
among students — some of whom have
sheds while others don't.
Because they usually occupy the same
apartment unit for more than one year
and have families, many graduate stu
dents say adequate storage is a necessity.
Storage is likely to be only one of
many issues discussed at tonight's meet
ing. Without any set agenda, the meeting
is intended to provide an open forum for
graduate students to discuss their con
cerns, said Mary Lea McAnally, one of

the meeting's key organizers.
"We want to come to a solution as to
how we can be better represented," said
McAnally, a doctoral student in the
Graduate School of Business who has
lived in Escondido for three years.
McAnally first became active *in Es
condido when Cowell announced this
summer that it would end its pediatric
services because the program was not
cost efficient.
After organizing a town meeting in
July to discuss the Cowell proposal with
other residents, she realized they
"lacked a voice." She added that Escon
dido currently has no representation in
the ASSU, while the specific graduate
schools do.
McAnally and Griffith said they hope
the meetings can be held on a regular
basis. They also would like to aid in the
formation of a permanent graduate stu
dent committee that would report to the
University on students' collective
interests.
"We haven't been able to get
through to the University,"
McAnally said. "That's the pur
pose of the meeting. Right now
there is no place for people to go
and voice their concerns in Escon
dido."

Those concerns touch issues
ranging from high rent rates and
the lack of affordable daycare to
their children's playgrounds.
"One day last November we
walked outside and all of the
swings were gone. There was no
warning. Nothing," Diaz said.
"There are lots of problems to
deal with," Diaz said. "What
we're doing is getting together to
determine a better way of dealing
with them for ourselves and for
future residents."
