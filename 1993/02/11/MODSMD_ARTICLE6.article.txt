# Stolen DRC golf cart recovered
## Cart for disabled students damaged but driveable 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Spattered with mud, but still driveable, a stolen
Disability Resource Center golf cart was found
abandoned at the Mausoleum last weekend by
Stanford Police.
DRC staff members did not know the cart was
missing until police found it in the bushes near the
Mausoleum at about 1 p.m. Sunday, according to
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"We have no clue as to who may be responsible
for the theft," which probably occurred after 6
p.m. Friday, he said.
Initially assuming the cart was an abandoned
vehicle, the police soon learned that it belonged to
the DRC and returned it to Program Coordinator
John Asheim.
There were "no indications" in the police report

that the cart had been damaged, Niemeyer said.
When the cart was found, "the switch was in the
'on' position. The cart was driveable."
But according to Aaron Bilstrom, coordinator
of the Disability Golf Cart Service, which owns and
operates the vehicle, "parts of the cart had been
damaged, including the right rear suspension."
The damage to the cart was probably not readily
visible when the police report was filed, he said.
"It looks like somebody just took it to go joyrid
ing. . . . The condition clearly indicates that some
one just wants to mess around and have a good
time at our expense," he said.
Citing damage to the brakes, the steering col
umn and exterior, Bilstrom added, "This is more
than just a good time."
"Whoever wanted to steal this cart really want-

ed it badly," he said. The stolen
cart is the only one the service
currently owns; the service bor
rows the second it operates.
This is not the first time the
DRC's golf carts have been
stolen. Niemeyer said even some
of the police department's golf
carts have disappeared for a few
days before being recovered
somewhere on campus. Golf cart
theft occurs "not that often, but
it's not a very uncommon thing,"
he said.
Having learned from thefts of
previous years, Bilstrom said the

DRC drivers had been locking
their golf cart with extra care
each night, running a cable
through the cart's rear suspen
sion and around a post outside
Meyer Library, "thinking that
this would deter any thief who
was just thinking of taking the
cart."
"But as we found out, any
body who really wants to steal
something can," he said. "It
wasn't just us forgetting to lock
it up."
The Disability Golf Cart Ser
vice offers free transportation
around campus for people who
are temporarily or permanently
disabled. Bilstrom said the carts
are used five days a week from
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
