Powell prefers early retirement
WASHINGTON (AP) - Gen. Colin Powell
said yesterday he will complete his term as chair
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff if asked by Presi
dent Clinton, but would prefer to leave a bit early.
In a day of appearances on TV interview shows,
Powell strongly disputed a New York Times
report that his desire to retire early was rein
forced by disagreements with Clinton over new
policies on homosexuals and budget cuts.
Powell, 55, is the nation's highest ranking mili
tary officer as well as the chief military adviser to the
president. He has held the job since Oct. 1,1989.
"I am not unhappy, I am not disappointed, I
am not crosswise with the administration," he
told CNN.
Powell said he had wanted to quit "a month or
so" before his term as Joint Chiefs chairman ends
on Sept. 30 "in order to get my family resettled."
He said he had made his wish known privately

before Clinton took office, and Powell's spokesman
said it was reiterated to Les Aspin, the new defense
secretary.
AIDS-like virus has many causes
BOSTON (AP) — A mysterious outbreak of
AIDS-like illness that created an uproar last sum
mer probably has many different causes and almost
certainly doesn't result from a single new virus.
Recent studies suggest that the disease is actually
a combination of similar-looking ailments that liave
been around a long time and are not contagious.
"When you look at the clinical, epidemiological
and laboratory results, one doesn't see a consis
tent pattern. That suggests perhaps this whole
syndrome is composed of patients with different
causes," said Dr. David Ho, head of the Aaron Dia
mond AIDS Research Center in New York City.
The illness came to light at July's International
Conference on AIDS, where it was the No. 1 topic.
