Another bouquet of flowers, like
those you so adore. From my

much more.
Tish, in the marathon life that is
yours,
I tried to love you, not (just) get in
your drawers.
I'd pace you, you'd pace me, inti
mate lap after lap,
I'd say, "I love you", you'd say,
k Ci»t the crap."
As me starting pistol with you on
the blocks, You'd get off, then
toss me, like old dirty socks.
And now through now through the
Daily, your column each week
Is my only connection to the
woman I seek.
I gaze at your picture, cut off at
the chest,
I savor your rhythm of sarcasm
and jest.
I dissect your words and be tween
the lines
Imagine I feature in your thoughts
and designs.
A ponytail man, a sensitive
gnome,
Would be far more agile at writing
this poem.
My words run on clums-ily, stum
ble and fall,
Like me chasing you, their rhymes
hit "the wall".
Chuck pennants, and trophies
and prizes all fine,
I'd rather be yours, so please, be
my Valentine.

I tried to love you, not (just) get in
your drawers.

I'd say, "I love you", you'd say,
k Ci»t the crap."
As me starting pistol with you on

toss me, like old dirty socks.
And now through now through the

Is my only connection to the
woman I seek.
I gaze at your picture, cut off at
the chest,
I savor your rhythm of sarcasm
and jest.
I dissect your words and be tween

Imagine I feature in your thoughts
and designs.
A ponytail man, a sensitive
gnome,
Would be far more agile at writing
this poem.
My words run on clums-ily, stum
ble and fall,
Like me chasing you, their rhymes
hit "the wall".
Chuck pennants, and trophies

I'd rather be yours, so please, be
