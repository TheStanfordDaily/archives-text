# Casper may offer 3-year undergrad option
## Plan would reduce cost of education 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Searching for ways to bring
down college costs, University
President Gerhard Casper said yes
terday that he may offer Stanford
undergraduates a "very clearly de
signed" three-year alternative to
the conventional four-year degree.
Speaking to a conference of
business leaders in San Francisco,
Casper said he is convinced that
college costs will only increase,
and called for a rethinking of every
aspect of undergraduate educa
tion — including its length.
"It is naive to assume that the
major universities can just go on
as they have done in the past with
out reexamination of their ways,"
he said, adding that if colleges do
not consider innovative solutions
they will face a "rude awakening."

The three-year option would rely
on a mix of Advanced Placement
credits and reduced distribution re
quirements to allow students to
graduate early, Casper said. The
traditional four-year course of
study would remain available.
Although he gave no timeline
for announcing a final proposal,
Casper said in an interview after
his speech that he hopes his sug
gestions will spark discussion dur
ing the next few months. He added
that he has already requested a
number of studies of the curricu
lum and students' interests.
All indications are that tuition
will continue to rise and further
squeeze families' budgets, Casper
said. "That means looking at alter
natives."

Casper first suggested reexam
ining the idea of a four-year un
dergraduate education in an inter
view with the San Francisco
Chronicle two weeks ago. With
costs approaching $100,000 at top
private schools, Casper said he has
begun to question whether it is
still cost-effective for students to
pursue a broad liberal arts educa
tion that provides little practical
training.
"If we could offer the benefits of
a college education in three years
instead of four, the cost to the stu
dent would be reduced consider
ably," Casper said at the conference
yesterday. He added that while the
liberal arts model attempts to ex
pose students to as many subjects
as possible, they end up getting "a

smattering of this and a smattering
of that which may or may not add
up to anything solid."
Casper's suggestion to recon
sider the four-year degree generat
ed a national debate within acade
mia, including an article in this
week's Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation that examined the possibili
ty of implementing the three-year
degree nationwide.
But Casper's remarks yester
day marked the first time he has
suggested a specific plan for Stan
ford. And he indicated in the inter
view after his speech that Stan
ford is his first concern, rather
than reform on the national level.
"I want to worry about Stan
ford and start there," he said.
"How much is possible elsewhere I
don't know."

have done in the
past without
reexamination of
their ways.'

Although some education
experts have embraced the three
year degree, many remain skepti
cal. Critics contend that the idea
is based on a European model
inappropriate for schools in the
United States, and does not pro
vide students with enough time to
experiment.
"Students mature so much
between the ages of 17 and 22
that they would lose a lot if we
took away a year," Dartmouth
president James Freedman told
the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion. "Students should explore a
lot of things, they should have a
sense of progression, and they
should have a sense of mastery."
Others argue that American
high schools are much weaker
than those in Europe and do not
teach the basics that would allow
students to graduate in three
years.
"The average high school gradu
ate is often not well-prepared for
college and needs four years to be
competitive with their counter
parts in other parts of the world,"
said Education Prof. Michael Kirst.
He added that the high school
system must improve if a three
year program is to be successfully

implemented. "You can't just look
at this as an issue for higher edu
cation," Kirst said.
In his address, however,
Casper rejected the idea that col
leges "must make up for the defi
ciencies" of high schools. "To this
I can only say that college is a ter
ribly costly place to provide reme
dial training," he said. "We can
not do the work of primary and
secondary schools. By attempting
to do so, colleges only become
more inefficient and less produc
tive, and may even contribute to
the neglect of primary and sec
ondary education."
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said Casper's plan would
certainly be feasible at Stanford.
An increasing number of students
arrive with the equivalent of one
year's worth of credit by combin
ing Advanced Placement credit
with community college courses,
he said.
But it may be more difficult to
implement the three-year pro
gram at public schools. A number
of education experts argue that
while private schools like Stan
ford are capable of turning out
graduates in three years, public
schools would be harder-pressed
because students there generally
arrive less prepared and take
longer to graduate.
"The question is, 'Is what's good
for Stanford good for them?' "

Kirst asked.
Casper's remarks were deliv
ered at the annual Outlook Con
ference of the Bay Area Council, a
non-profit group that examines
public policy issues such as trans
portation and housing. Its mem
bers include about 250 corpora
tions, including Pacific Gas and
Electric and Chevron.
More than 900 people attended
the conference, which featured
addresses by Gov. Pete Wilson
and Washington Post political
correspondent David Broder.
Casper said he had originally
planned to speak about technolo
gy transfer at the conference, but
changed his topic after the San
Francisco Chronicle article
appeared and sparked "so much
interest" in the issue.
Casper expects his suggestions
will lead to charges that he is too
careerist. But he said, "I do
believe in a liberal education. I do
believe in the search to know, in
the disinterested, joyously obses
sive pursuit of truth."
Questioning the four-year
degree is a device to make people
think critically about improving
the quality and affordability of
undergraduate education, Casper
said. He added that "it would be
sad" if people simply accepted the
status quo or asserted that his
views stress careerism over intel
lectualism.

More than 900 people attended
the conference, which featured
addresses by Gov. Pete Wilson
and Washington Post political
correspondent David Broder.
Casper said he had originally
planned to speak about technolo
gy transfer at the conference, but
changed his topic after the San
Francisco Chronicle article
appeared and sparked "so much
interest" in the issue.
Casper expects his suggestions
will lead to charges that he is too
careerist. But he said, "I do
believe in a liberal education. I do
believe in the search to know, in
the disinterested, joyously obses
sive pursuit of truth."
Questioning the four-year
degree is a device to make people
think critically about improving
the quality and affordability of
undergraduate education, Casper
said. He added that "it would be
sad" if people simply accepted the
status quo or asserted that his
views stress careerism over intel
lectualism.
Searching for ways to bring
down college costs, University
President Gerhard Casper said yes
terday that he may offer Stanford
undergraduates a "very clearly de
signed" three-year alternative to
the conventional four-year degree.
Speaking to a conference of
business leaders in San Francisco,
Casper said he is convinced that
college costs will only increase,
and called for a rethinking of every
aspect of undergraduate educa
tion — including its length.
"It is naive to assume that the
major universities can just go on
as they have done in the past with
out reexamination of their ways,"
he said, adding that if colleges do
not consider innovative solutions
they will face a "rude awakening."

The three-year option would rely
on a mix of Advanced Placement
credits and reduced distribution re
quirements to allow students to
graduate early, Casper said. The
traditional four-year course of
study would remain available.
Although he gave no timeline
for announcing a final proposal,
Casper said in an interview after
his speech that he hopes his sug
gestions will spark discussion dur
ing the next few months. He added
that he has already requested a
number of studies of the curricu
lum and students' interests.
All indications are that tuition
will continue to rise and further
squeeze families' budgets, Casper
said. "That means looking at alter
natives."

Casper first suggested reexam
ining the idea of a four-year un
dergraduate education in an inter
view with the San Francisco
Chronicle two weeks ago. With
costs approaching $100,000 at top
private schools, Casper said he has
begun to question whether it is
still cost-effective for students to
pursue a broad liberal arts educa
tion that provides little practical
training.
"If we could offer the benefits of
a college education in three years
instead of four, the cost to the stu
dent would be reduced consider
ably," Casper said at the conference
yesterday. He added that while the
liberal arts model attempts to ex
pose students to as many subjects
as possible, they end up getting "a

smattering of this and a smattering
of that which may or may not add
up to anything solid."
Casper's suggestion to recon
sider the four-year degree generat
ed a national debate within acade
mia, including an article in this
week's Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation that examined the possibili
ty of implementing the three-year
degree nationwide.
But Casper's remarks yester
day marked the first time he has
suggested a specific plan for Stan
ford. And he indicated in the inter
view after his speech that Stan
ford is his first concern, rather
than reform on the national level.
"I want to worry about Stan
ford and start there," he said.
"How much is possible elsewhere I
don't know."

Although some education
experts have embraced the three
year degree, many remain skepti
cal. Critics contend that the idea
is based on a European model
inappropriate for schools in the
United States, and does not pro
vide students with enough time to
experiment.
"Students mature so much
between the ages of 17 and 22
that they would lose a lot if we
took away a year," Dartmouth
president James Freedman told
the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion. "Students should explore a
lot of things, they should have a
sense of progression, and they
should have a sense of mastery."
Others argue that American
high schools are much weaker
than those in Europe and do not
teach the basics that would allow
students to graduate in three
years.
"The average high school gradu
ate is often not well-prepared for
college and needs four years to be
competitive with their counter
parts in other parts of the world,"
said Education Prof. Michael Kirst.
He added that the high school
system must improve if a three
year program is to be successfully

implemented. "You can't just look
at this as an issue for higher edu
cation," Kirst said.
In his address, however,
Casper rejected the idea that col
leges "must make up for the defi
ciencies" of high schools. "To this
I can only say that college is a ter
ribly costly place to provide reme
dial training," he said. "We can
not do the work of primary and
secondary schools. By attempting
to do so, colleges only become
more inefficient and less produc
tive, and may even contribute to
the neglect of primary and sec
ondary education."
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said Casper's plan would
certainly be feasible at Stanford.
An increasing number of students
arrive with the equivalent of one
year's worth of credit by combin
ing Advanced Placement credit
with community college courses,
he said.
But it may be more difficult to
implement the three-year pro
gram at public schools. A number
of education experts argue that
while private schools like Stan
ford are capable of turning out
graduates in three years, public
schools would be harder-pressed
because students there generally
arrive less prepared and take
longer to graduate.
"The question is, 'Is what's good
for Stanford good for them?' "

Kirst asked.
Casper's remarks were deliv
ered at the annual Outlook Con
ference of the Bay Area Council, a
non-profit group that examines
public policy issues such as trans
portation and housing. Its mem
bers include about 250 corpora
tions, including Pacific Gas and
Electric and Chevron.
