# Casper may offer 3-year undergrad option
## Plan would reduce cost of education

Searching for ways to bring
down college costs, University
President Gerhard Casper said yes
terday that he may offer Stanford
undergraduates a "very clearly de
signed" three-year alternative to
the conventional four-year degree.
Speaking to a conference of
business leaders in San Francisco,
Casper said he is convinced that
college costs will only increase,
and called for a rethinking of every
aspect of undergraduate educa
tion — including its length.
"It is naive to assume that the
major universities can just go on
as they have done in the past with
out reexamination of their ways,"
he said, adding that if colleges do
not consider innovative solutions
they will face a "rude awakening."

The three-year option would rely
on a mix of Advanced Placement
credits and reduced distribution re
quirements to allow students to
graduate early, Casper said. The
traditional four-year course of
study would remain available.
Although he gave no timeline
for announcing a final proposal,
Casper said in an interview after
his speech that he hopes his sug
gestions will spark discussion dur
ing the next few months. He added
that he has already requested a
number of studies of the curricu
lum and students' interests.
All indications are that tuition
will continue to rise and further
squeeze families' budgets, Casper
said. "That means looking at alter
natives."

Casper first suggested reexam
ining the idea of a four-year un
dergraduate education in an inter
view with the San Francisco
Chronicle two weeks ago. With
costs approaching $100,000 at top
private schools, Casper said he has
begun to question whether it is
still cost-effective for students to
pursue a broad liberal arts educa
tion that provides little practical
training.
"If we could offer the benefits of
a college education in three years
instead of four, the cost to the stu
dent would be reduced consider
ably," Casper said at the conference
yesterday. He added that while the
liberal arts model attempts to ex
pose students to as many subjects
as possible, they end up getting "a

smattering of this and a smattering
of that which may or may not add
up to anything solid."
Casper's suggestion to recon
sider the four-year degree generat
ed a national debate within acade
mia, including an article in this
week's Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation that examined the possibili
ty of implementing the three-year
degree nationwide.
But Casper's remarks yester
day marked the first time he has
suggested a specific plan for Stan
ford. And he indicated in the inter
view after his speech that Stan
ford is his first concern, rather
than reform on the national level.
"I want to worry about Stan
ford and start there," he said.
"How much is possible elsewhere I
don't know."

'It is naive to assume
that the major
universities can
just go on as they
have done in the
past without
reexamination of
their ways.'
