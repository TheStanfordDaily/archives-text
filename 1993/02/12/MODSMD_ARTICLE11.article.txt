Gunman hijacks airliner
NEW YORK (AP) — A gunman hijacked a jetlin
er with 104 people aboard yesterday and forced it
from Austria to New York, where he surrendered.
No one was injured during the 11-hour ordeal,
the first trans-Atlantic hijacking in more than 16
years. Seven Americans were among the passen
gers on the Lufthansa plane.
The hijacker had made three demands, said
police detective Dominick Misino: that the plane
go to Kennedy International Airport; that he
receive political asylum; and that the United
States intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The man hijacked the plane at gunpoint over
Austria during a flight from Frankfurt, Germany,
to two African cities. The plane was diverted to
Hanover, Germany, where it was refueled. German
officials said they allowed it to take off for New York
because the gunman threatened to kill hostages.
Clashes continue in Kabul
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Exploding
artillery crackled through the Afghan capital yes
terday as government troops pushed Shiite rebels
off a strategic hill.

At least 1,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed since the fighting started Jan. 19 between gov
ernment troops and fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islami
and its ally, the Iranian-armed Hezb-e-Wahadat.
Doctors say the exact death toll will never be
known because most families bury their dead
quickly in accordance with Muslim tradition.
Neighborhoods have been flattened, and tens of
thousands of people have fled the city.
GM reports record loss
DETROIT (AP) — General Motors Corp. made
business history yesterday by reporting a record
$23.5 billion loss for 1992, extending a streak of
stunning setbacks that have dogged the world's
biggest industrial company.
But beneath this staggering number were some
signs of financial turnaround.
One-time accounting changes for current and
future retiree health care made up $22.2 billion of
the loss, and other one-time hits drained another
$1.53 billion during the year.
When the accounting adjustments weren't
included, GM made $273 million in the final three
months of the year compared to a drastic fourth
quarter loss of $520 million.
