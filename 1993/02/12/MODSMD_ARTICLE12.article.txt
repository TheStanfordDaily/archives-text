# Third time's a charm?
## Miami-area prosecutor Janet Reno nominated 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Stick
ing to his goal of naming the
nation's first female attorney gen
eral, President Clinton nominat
ed Miami prosecutor Janet Reno
yesterday after two earlier candi
dates stumbled because they had
hired illegal aliens.
"She is a front-line crime fight
er and a caring public servant,"
Clinton said. Reno, 54, has been
the Miami-area prosecutor for 15
years, overseeing 230 lawyers who
prosecute 40,000 felonies a year.
In a reminder of Clinton's
problems in finding an acceptable
Justice nominee, Reno said with a
smile in answer to a reporter's
question, "I've never hired an ille
gal alien and I think I've paid all
my Social Security taxes."
Clinton said he was "somewhat
but not entirely" inclined to nom
inate a woman. He considered at
least four men, despite intense
pressure from women's groups,

the president said.
A six-footer, Reno stood eye-to
eye with Clinton at a Rose Garden
news conference lit by a bright,
setting sun. "I am humbled L; che
honor," she said.
Nominee Zoe Baird and top
candidate Kimba Wood were
dropped during the past three
weeks amid a furor over hiring
undocumented workers to take
care of young children or do other
household work.
Reno, 54, is single.and has no
children.
One of her best-known cases
was the prosecution of five police
officers in the beating of black
insurance agent Arthur McDuffie
in December 1979. The trial was
moved to Tampa and the five police
officers were acquitted, sparking
the "Liberty City riot" in Miami.
Clinton, who oversaw four exe
cutions in Arkansas and made cap
ital punishment a campaign issue,

noted than his nominee had won
80 capital punishment convictions.
Although Reno said she told
Clinton she was personally
opposed to capital punishment,
she promised to "advocate" for
the death penalty "when the evi
dence and the law justify."
On another emotional issue, she
said she supports abortion rights.
Choosing an attorney general
has not been easy for Clinton.
Baird withdrew after a public
outcry over her hiring of illegal
aliens and failure to pay Social
Security taxes for them.
Wood withdrew as a candidate
because she hired an illegal immi
grant for baby sitting, even
though it was not illegal to do so
at the time.
Senate confirmation of Reno
would fill the final hole in Clin
ton's Cabinet â€” and an impor
tant post as head of the Justice
Department.
