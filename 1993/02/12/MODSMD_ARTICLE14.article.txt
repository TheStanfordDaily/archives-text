University must compel
Webb Ranch to increase
workers' compensation

HOW MUCH DOES it cost to
feed, clothe and support a
family of four?
According to a 1991 estimate,
the latest available, it takes
$13,924 to keep a family of four
above the poverty line.
How much would it take for a
large university with some human
itarian concern to keep eight fami
lies of varying size above that
poverty line?
The workers' living conditions
at the ranch are deplorable. Four
Webb Ranch homes were recently
condemned. The 30-year old gas
lines to several workers' homes
were shut off in early November
after being declared "unsafe."
Some of the families had no hot
water for showers. Most of the
families were forced to do their
cooking outdoors. In addition, the
workers do not receive any medi
cal or dental benefits from the
Webbs. All in all, living conditions
are poor at best and abhorrent at
worst.
Webb Ranch, in addition to the
condemned-housing fiasco, has
also been paying its workers the
small sum of $5 to $6.50 an hour.
At $5 an hour — assuming a 40-
hour work week, 52 weeks of the
year — each worker's salary
amounts to $10,400, well below
the 1991 poverty line. At $6.50 an
hour, that same 40-hour work
week comes out to $13,520 a year,
which is closer to the line, but still
inadequate. Yet this amount must
support families consisting of as
many as seven people.
The University has done well to
pressure the Webbs to build new
homes, but there's more to be
done. While Stanford does not
have the authority to directly
raise the workers' wages, since
they are actually employees of

Webb Ranch, Webb Ranch is a ten
ant of the University, and the Uni
versity can take informal mea
sures to guide the Ranch's policy.
And while Webb Ranch does not
have a legal obligation to raise the
wages of the workers, the moral
obligation for both the University
and the Webbs is clear.
Webb Ranch should raise the
wages of their workers so as to
ensure them a decent standard of
living, and the University must
see that the Ranch takes these
steps. Webb Ranch would do well
to change their pay scale from $5
to $6.50 an hour to a more reason
able $7.16 an hour, the most com
mon University minimum wage.
At least this would raise the fami
lies above the poverty line, if not
by much. Is that too much to com
pensate the workers? While most
decidedly not boosting their
income greatly, such a pay
increase would provide a ray of
hope for the families, suggesting
that things are getting better
rather than worse.
The workers belong to United
Stanford Workers, a union that
serves as an arbiter for negotia
tions and aims for an $8 minimum
wage. Yet the Webb Ranch labor
ers are obviously not receiving
this amount. Why? If the Stanford
community becomes vocal about
this disgrace, perhaps Stanford
authorities, and hence Webb
Ranch, will be forced to confront
the situation and make repara
tions. While there is no set mini
mum wage for University and
Stanford community workers,
even Food Service hashers get at
least $7.16 an hour. And most of
them don't have a family of four
(or seven) to feed.
One can only speculate at the
profits Webb Ranch is making.
But if they can't afford to pay
their workers more, perhaps they
should rethink their operation.
This is not about legal obliga
tion, but human decency and the
fact that no business, profitable or
otherwise, should be founded on
the misery of others.
