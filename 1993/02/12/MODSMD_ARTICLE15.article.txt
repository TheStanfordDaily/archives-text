Alpha Sig 'subculture' detrimental to house community

FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO, a flyer
was posted for Alpha Sig's upcom
ing Wednesday night party — "An
Hour of Power: 60 shots of beer in 60
minutes" — and I wrote a comment on
the house chalkboard that asked, "Isn't
this a little alcohol-focused?" This was
replied to with comments such as "Suck
me" and "Whatever happened to Alpha
Sig tradition?" These comments have
prompted me to write at long last con
cerning the investigation into hazing at
Alpha Sig, for I believe Alpha Sig has a
certain "hostile" element, and nobody
that I can see seems to think that any
thing should be done about it.
I am currently a third-year Alpha Sig
resident, and I am writing, first of all, to
say that after having read the legal defi
nition of hazing and having gained a bet
ter, hopefully more mature perspective
on Alpha Sig in the last several months, I
must state that I have been hazed
myself, I have hazed others and I don't
think Alpha Sig is what it pretends to be.
I entered Alpha Sig my sophomore
year and I found that it was a very
accepting house, so long as I drank. I
could have been called a "willing partici

pant," as no one forced me to give in to
peer pressure. But I wanted to belong,
and so I did drink (including a 24 oz.
glass of stale, week-old beer with used
nitrous oxide canisters in the bottom
that I was ordered to drink during part
of initiation, without knowing what it
was at the time). Drinking and irrespon
sible drug use were encouraged there,
and no one I came into contact with
caused me to question anything I was
doing.
My problems with Alpha Sig go
beyond its initiation, however, and I
think the rest of the Stanford communi
ty needs to be made aware of much that
goes on here, even though the problems
have lessened somewhat this year. Those
who might consider drawing into Alpha
Sig should do so knowing some of the
history of the house that they're not told
during the average priority meeting in
the spring.
Over the last three years at Alpha Sig
I have watched some members of the
house vomit all over the place once per
quarter and walk through it all the next
morning. I have seen incredibly reckless
users of LSD, crack, cocaine, mushrooms

and other substances. I have seen suicide
attempts. I have seen the destruction of
house property. I have seen drunk
drivers who couldn't even walk, friends
who stopped breathing from too much
alcohol, and on and on. ...
I should emphasize that I have by no
means been an innocent observer the last
few years; in fact, I was an eager partici
pant in many of the above activities and
other Alpha Sig functions, up until
recently. It is only now that I have great
ly lessened my own alcohol consumption
that I have begun to feel ill-at-ease in
Alpha Sig and have come to believe that
too many events here are improperly
focused. For example, I have no personal
problem with people who choose to do an
"Hour of Power" for whatever reason —
I only believe that it shouldn't be an offi
cial house event paid for with house
funds, especially when the whole house
cannot participate (this is a prime exam
ple of a situation in which non-drinkers
probably feel highly uncomfortable
attending).
I also believe that the focus of Alpha
Sig initiation is currently not on build
ing community and bonding, as it claims

to be, but on trying to pull in new mem
bers to a kind of drinking and drug
"subculture"; this subculture has been
able to cover its tracks fairly well while
I've been here (or maybe the administra
tion has just chosen not to deal with
things until now), and I fear that there
is an unacceptable potential for life
threatening disaster here that has
already demonstrated itself numerous
times in the past.
I welcome responses, especially from
current and past members of Alpha Sig.
All I ask is that residents not automati
cally defend that with which they associ
ate themselves, but first truly question
their convictions. I know I defended
Alpha Sig from critics myself for almost
two years.
I care for Alpha Sig, and I think the
house has a great deal of potential as an
alternative living environment; current
ly, however, I think Alpha Sig needs to
gain a sense of responsibility to all mem
bers of its community, and I hope the
current investigation can eventually
help this happen.
