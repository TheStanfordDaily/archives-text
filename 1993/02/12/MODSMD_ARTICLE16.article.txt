# Fourth year of college important to students
## 
### 
When I was a pre-med student at
Stanford in 1936, one of the youngest in
my class, I was told by my adviser that,
although I could go to medical school
after three years, I shouldn't because I
was too goal-oriented and my social con
sciousness and mores had not caught up
with my specialized skills and academic
achievements. He said, "Smell the roses!
Take a fourth year and devote it just to
courses in the humanities." So for a year
it was lots of English, history, art and
philosophy â€” no more science!
After graduating in 1937,1 went

through medical school and residencies,
had a long career in the practice and teach
ing of medicine, ending up 50 years later
as a clinical professor of medicine at Stan
ford. Forty years of practice of internal
medicine and cardiology in Palo Alto has
given me great personal reward and satis
faction in my professional relationships
with my many patients, and also with my
colleagues, both in practice and at the
Stanford Medical School and Hospital.
Now the reason for this letter. I feel
that the broadening influence of that
year in the humanities, early on, enabled
me to balance the exigencies of my medi
cal practice and life with the lighter
touches of literature, art, drama and his
tory. It certainly made me a more
humane and understanding doctor for

my patients. Therefore, as much as I
greatly admire our new President Ger
hard Casper, and feel he will lead us to
even greater heights of excellence, I
must take issue with him about his pro
posed plan for a three-year goal-oriented
curriculum leading to a bachelor's
degree, even though it may be more eco
nomically and financially practical in
these hard times.
My plea is to retain the four-year cur
riculum to allow those students in pro
fessionally and scientifically oriented
magors to have the option to gain knowl
edge in the humanities. The reverse is
true for those students in the humani
ties. Three years is just not long enough
to turn out a complete individual. We get
old soon enough, and can learn better

when young.
"Life is short and the art long, the
occasion instant, experiment perilous,
decision difficult." This quotation is
engraved over the portals of my other
alma mater, Harvard Medical School.
Let this remind us that we should try to
make better-prepared and balanced peo
ple of the Stanford graduates of today;
that even if life is short, the art is long
and it still takes time to achieve the goal
of maturity.
Give us the traditional four years so
we can send out individuals who can
make difficult decisions in the perilous
times that lie ahead. God knows we will
need it.
