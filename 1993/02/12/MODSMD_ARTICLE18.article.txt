## Waltzing away to the bank 
### 
THE VIENNESE BALL IS a scam.
Not just a little scam, but a major,
indirect-cost-sized scam.
First, the committee rakes in money
by the truck-load; they sell 250 pairs of
student tickets at $60 a pop. Ouch. Fac
ulty tickets are $80. If you are heading
something in the Med School this may
not be a big deal, but otherwise, ouch
again.
I'll assume that around 50 faculty
tickets go out. This totals $19,000,
which is around one year's tuition or
76,000 games of Street Fighter 11.
Granted, this is a lot of money, but let's
see where it goes.
Some money goes to food. To me, this
is the most important feature of the ball
— food, and lots of it. However, you
don't even get a full dinner, just
munchies. They have to hire a band or
two (if the band's pricey, it'll call itself
an orchestra). I wonder if the commit
tee needs to bribe local fire marshals or
get insurance to cover the event, like
the bonfire does. Additionally, the ball
needs security to keep those out-of-con
trol, slightly bombed polka dancers
from maiming anyone. That's it.
Remember that some items are donat
ed, too.
It is possible that all of the costs
equal the gross profits, but that's not
the real scam. Someone hidden deep in
a secret chamber in the underground

committee bunker is enjoying a good
laugh at all the poor saps who slept out
for tickets.
Most of these people waited in line
for more than 12 hours just to hand
over 60 bucks so that they could eat
some donated food and drink (a similar
experience can be provided at various
soup kitchens in the area for free, for
mal attire not required). They could
only leave their place in line for 10 min
utes at a time, and had to check in and
out with the committee member on
duty.
For the two nights, the committee
wisely chose White Plaza (luckily, paved
in concrete, wet, in some places slug
ridden and far from all-night bath
rooms) and the outside of the post office
(just concrete, damp and with distant
bathrooms . . . slugs absent) for the
waiting areas.
Not only were these people subjected
to inane rules and uncomfortable sur
roundings, but all they got for their
troubles was a receipt. Personally, I
think that the committee just likes to
exercise its power over people and
watch them jump through hoops.
For the same $60, a couple could
have quite a nice night, or 240 trys at a
video game of their choice. Two couples
could get together, buy a Super Ninten
do .. . oops, non-intellectual digression.
What if everyone just decided the Vien

nese Ball was not really a big deal?
What if they threw a Viennese Ball and
no one came? Does Selix Formal Wear
give kickbacks? Unanswered questions
to be sure, but now to the point ....
The committee wields the same sort
of imaginary power that the University
holds over all students. Instead of get
ting to go to a fancy dance, the Univer
sity will give us a slip of paper with an
official seal that says we took all of our
DRs, completed a major and paid all of
our phone bills.
Really now, do you take your DR to
diversify yourself, or so that you can get
that slip of paper? Fundamentally, what
you pay this institution for is the educa
tion you will get or have gotten.
No one can take that away from you.
But, if you don't take all your DRs, fill
every little insipid major requirement
and be a good little student, then you'll
be driving that forklift for the rest of
your natural life, just the same as if you
had graduated with a major in commu
nications.

Kenny Mai will be laughing his way to
the bank on Saturday, as he passes all
the "believers " on their way to the ball.
