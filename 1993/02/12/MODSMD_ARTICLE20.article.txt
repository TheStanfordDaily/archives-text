SIN AND JUSTIFY
again. It's a self-cleaning oven that would
have driven indulgence salesmen out of
business a long time ago.
The time lapse between sin and justifi
cation has finally been overcome. In this
new, crazy world where lovers meet over
e-mail — and don't even expect each
other to be decent looking — anything
can be justified.
Sins which were unconscionable just
four years ago are now swept under the
rug faster than the cocaine of a high-rank
ing university administrator. Precisely.
What was once considered a lame excuse
has now become a legitimate justification.
Wasn't it was just one presidential
election ago when a candidate from a rea
sonably impressive midwestern state was
caught on a yacht with a not-altogether
attractive-looking model type? And
wasn't he summarily laughed out of both
politics and his self-aggrandizing claim to
be "just like JFK?" But this year, when a
presidential candidate from a particular
ly embarrassing Southern state was
caught with an even less attractive model
type, he was completely forgiven — and
he got to keep the JFK title.
And wasn't it just two short years ago,

when an impressively-intelligent, Jewish
judge was denied nomination to the
Supreme Court because he, like most intel
lectually curious teenagers not blood-relat
ed to Nancy Reagan, had toked the rope?
But last year, when a black, under-quali
fied federal judge who decided to woo a fel
low employee by mumbling sophisticated
phrases like "pubic hair" and "Long Dong
Silver," was nominated, he was mirthfully
appointed by white Southern senators. And
when he openly admitted to smoking mar
ijuana, no one cared — not even Nancy.
Even more impressive than the coun
try's willingness to justify these politi
cians' actions, ("Hell, in Arkansas, cheat
ing on your wife is a family tradition."
and "Anita had a great ass.") was the
wives' willingness to forgive their hus
bands. Cheating is bad, but having an
unfathomably powerful husband is
much, much better.
Seems that no matter how bizarre the
circumstance, how much of an affront to
the ego, the political cause or the vows of
fidelity, there always seems to be a "good
reason" to calm everybody down, shoo
them away from the water cooler and
send them back to work.
And even when no explanation is in

sight, America knows there must be one
out there, it's just they can't think of it
because they've been watching too much
90210, and not enough Matlock.
As things got more and more frighten
ingly unpredictable (Why shouldn't
Latvia have autonomy over Estonia any
way? Is that a man or a woman under
neath Madonna?), more and more defense
mechanisms were built into the American
consciousness. If we could accept the
excuses for what was going on as legiti
mate justification, then our inability to
comprehend could be suppressed, and
things wouldn't seem so gosh-darn scary.
Instant justification was built among the
ruins of naivete. Par example:
• Sin: Dateline NBC placed incendiary
devices under a GM truck so they could
show just how easily they explode. Justi
fication: Them trucks are pretty danger
ous, and how else do you communicate
that to people who drink Coors and put
Ross Perot bumper stickers on the back
of their 4X4s, other than pyrotechnics?
• Sin: A man in a trenchcoat walks
into the library, finds a sleeping woman
and quietly masturbates into her hair?
Justification: The protein's gotta be pret
ty good for split ends. Just remember to

put on a hat before class tomorrow morn
ing and wear a little extra perfume, girl.
• Sin: Dean Jean reads this column.
Justification: She says it's because she
reads the whole paper. And, well, because
"it's maturing." Maturing? Penis, penis,
penis, penis, penis, penis.
While stuffy intellectuals spend hours
debating why it's alright to teach Ezra
Pound and Heidegger, the rest of the
country is busy solving moral dilemmas
with a pocket calculator. Imprisoning
animals seem a bit cruel? Just call them
"wildlife conservatories" and give the
seals one of those presidential pardons
everyone seems to like so much.
There's no room to judge anymore, to
exact biblical-style revenge and call some
one out on the rug and make them write
really embarrassing letters of resignation.
To judge, to question and to admit
uncertainty are the new sins. The sooner
something, no matter how bizarre, can be
safely tucked away in the realm of expec
tation, the easier it is to feel in control.
It's the most complex defense mechanism
since Reagan tried to explain Star Wars.
Excuses are the fastest way to take
something from the realm of the unset
tling into the realm of the comfortable. In

order to stay in control, America is con
stantly bracing itself for the next step
beyond what is now shocking. Ten min
utes after Madonna put out her nudie
book, America was ready to accept hard
core porn flicks from the Material Girl.
No one can cheat on America because
they already thought they were cheated
on, and already knew the excuse.
But defense breeds apathy. And apa
thy is easier than braving the dangerous
world of increasing shock and instability.
And those who dare to dwell too long or
put their morals on the line by making
judgement calls — well, they'll never get
a job working for Dateline NBC.
