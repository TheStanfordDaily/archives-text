## Slick 'Southern Cross' fulfilling freshman promise 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
He's from Little Rock, Ark.,
and he's slick, but he doesn't play
the sax.
But he does play basketball.
Dion Cross has been displaying
some smooth moves at guard in
establishing himself as one of the
top freshmen in the Pacific 10
Conference this season.
"He's done a nice job for us,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He's not phased by
what's going on around him. He
has a good knack for scoring the
ball."
With two senior guards return
ing to the Stanford team, Cross
expected this year to be one of
observation, watching and learn
ing from the veterans on the Car
dinal squad. Instead, his abilities
have made it too hard for Mont
gomery to keep him on the bench.
"We have two seniors, so I
thought I was going to be learning
a lot and getting just a little play
ing time," Cross said. "I didn't
think I was going to get to play
this much."
Cross, who only a year ago was
the Most Valuable Player of the
Arkansas State Tournament, was
not accustomed to sitting on the
sidelines. After leading Stanford
in scoring for three straight
games in reserve, he was inserted
into the starting lineup two
games later.
Cross has not backed down
from the challenge of playing
against the best teams on Stan
ford's schedule. In his three-game
scoring outburst in January, he
scored 17, 17 and 18 points
against Notre Dame, California
and UCLA, respectively.
Against Cal, Cross got his first
taste of big-time college basket
ball when Bears' guard Jason
Kidd swatted a Cross shot
attempt a few rows deep into the
seats at Harmon Gym. Cross is
looking forward to Sunday's
rematch against Kidd in Maples
Pavilion.
"We're both quick and athletic
— he's a little stronger," Cross
said. "It (the block) makes me feel
that I want revenge. If the chance
comes again I think I'll win the
battle, but I have to worry about
the team first."
Usually, freshmen would be

intimidated to play in such venues
as UCLA's Pauley Pavilion or Ari
zona's McKale Center— but not
Cross.
"I'm excited when I can play in
those places," Cross said. "It's my
first time playing there, so I just
want to make a good showing."
He did just that last weekend.
After replacing Peter Dukes at
shooting guard against Washing
ton the previous week, Cross
turned it up a notch on the road in
Arizona, pacing the Cardinal with
15 points against the No. 8 Wild
cats, and 25 points against the
Arizona State Sun Devils.
"Some freshmen would not feel
comfortable with scoring — Dion
has no problem with that," Mont
gomery said. "He'll shoot it right
from the get-go."
"Dion has been playing phe
nomenal," Dukes said. "He starts
throwing up shots in games you
haven't seen in practice and they
all go in. He's provided us with
offense that we really need, and
he's even carried us."
The6-foot-4, 175-pound Cross,
who is currently averaging 8.6
points per game, recognizes that
he must use his speed to his
advantage in order to compensate
for being matched up with
stronger, more physical players.
"The last couple of games I've
been matched up against guys like
(UCLA's Shon) Tarver, who's 6-5,
200 lbs., and (Arizona State's)
Hedake (Smith) [who is 6-foot-2,
205 lbs.], so I've had to use my
quickness against their strength
while I make the transition to
becoming bigger and stronger."
Montgomery likes the fact that

Cross is willing to acknowledge
his shortcomings and work on
them.
"He's a kid who always wants
to get better," Montgomery said.
"Part of solving problems is rec
ognizing them. He realized that to
play against guys like Tarver, you
have to have strength. He's an
enjoyable kid to be around, he
likes people and wants to be a
good basketball player."
He already is good. The ques
tion for the future is whether
Cross can become great.
"When he goes into games he
seems to have the knack for get
ting things done," Montgomery
said. "It appears that he could be
in Madison Square Garden and it
wouldn't phase him. To him, it
would just be playing."
While Cross loves to labor on
the court, he also has high ambi
tions off of it. He does not like to
take the easy route, and that ethic
extends to his academic efforts.
After leading his Parkview High
School team to the Arkansas state
championship, Cross narrowed
down his college choices to USC
and Stanford.
"It all came down to aca
demics," Cross said. "I wanted a
challenge in school too. I like chal
lenges because they make me
work harder to play. If you have a
Stanford degree, you're guaran
teed a job and can make lots of
money, and that's what I want to
do. But you've got to party a little
bit. It keeps you from stressing
out."
If he keeps his focus, he may
end up like that other guy from
Little Rock.

Things are looking up for an ambitious Dion Cross, who has made the transition from Arkansas school
boy hero to Stanford starting guard in just one year.
