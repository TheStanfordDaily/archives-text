# Spikers face Trojans, 49ers as season begins in earnest
## 
### Rob Ross Staff Writer 
The warmup music for the Stanford
men's volleyball team this weekend
should be the theme from "2001: A Space
Odyssey."
The Cardinal may be 5-1, but for all
intents and purposes its season begins
this weekend, when lOth-ranked USC
pays a visit to Burnham Pavilion tomor
row at 6 p.m., followed by a match against
seventh-ranked Long Beach State Sunday
at 4 p.m.
'We have used [our previ
ous games] as a tune-up
for this weekend.'
— John Kosty
"We have used lour previous games] as
a tune-up for this weekend," said assis
tant coach John Kosty.
Last year the Trojans had their worst
record since 1976, finishing 11-13. But
with five returning starters, the team is
vastly improved. Six-foot-seven middle
blocker Jason Mulholland, who leads the
squad with 7.5 kills per game, is Stan
ford's primary concern.
"Mulholland is a very hot hitter and
one of our goals is to slow him down,"
Kosty said.
Another Trojan impact player, middle
blocker Chris Underwood, was third in
the nation last year with a .481 hitting
percentage. This year Underwood has 63
kills, including 39 in a match against
Hawaii, and is hitting .490.
USC has compiled a 1-2 record, with
both losses coming to the fifth-ranked
Rainbows. At the UC-Santa Barbara tour
nament last month, the Trojans defeated
Stanford in a match that did not figure
into official standings. Kosty does not find
that loss too prophetic.
"We came into the tournament after
two weeks off," he said. "Our viewpoint
was not win or lose, but to get people some
playing time. I think USC came in with a
little more practice."
Conversations about men's volleyball
at Long Beach State begin with one name
— 1992 National Collegiate Player of the
Year Brent Hilliard. Hilliard, the only col
legiate player on last summer's U.S.
Olympic Team, is again one of the top per

formers in the nation. He is averaging 6.6
kills per game from the opposite-hitter
position and became the NCAA career-kill
leader Feb. 6, breaking Brian Ivie's record
of 2,380. Leading the team in kills, blocks
and service aces, Hilliard accounts for
over half of the 49ers' offense.
"When he is on, he will take over a
game. For us to beat Long Beach, we have
to key on Hilliard," Kosty said.
The 49ers (4-5) return two other play
ers from their last year's 27-4 squad —
outside hitter Zack Small and setter Jason
Stimpflg. After these three names on the
roster, the 49ers' experience level drops
off precipitously, with senior Brad
Freisen and sophomore Karl Van Reusen
at middle blocker, and freshman Travis
Barr at outside hitter rounding out the
starting lineup.
"One of our keys is to exploit their
inexperienced middle," Kosty said.
Stanford is almost fully recovered from
the little nagging injuries that have
plagued the team so far this season. Swing
hitter Eric Wells will suit up, after miss
ing three games last weekend with a hip
flexor pull; middle blocker John Hribar
has recovered from the back spasms that
sat him out of practice a week ago; and
middle blocker Joe Burghardt's back is at
about 80%, and he is questionable for the
weekend.
Even with a generally healthy team at
its disposal, the Cardinal coaching staff
has not committed to a starting lineup.
"We're still looking for the right combina
tion to play," Kosty said.
David Goss figures to start at opposite
hitter, while Bob Hillman and Ryan
Moos should open at swing hitter. The
middle-blocker positions have been hotly
contested all year, and with Burghardt's
possible absence, any number of players
could step forward, including seniors
John Bezmalinovic and Hribar, sopho
more Brian Garrett and freshman Mike
Lambert. At the setter position, incum
bent Ail-American Canyon Ceman is the
likely choice, but the coaching staff con
tinues to emphasize an ongoing battle
between Ceman and senior Jimmy
Blackman.
"You're going to see some of the best
players in the nation this weekend,"
Kosty said. "USC tradition here has been
a dogfight to the end with capacity
crowds. We've had to turn people away for
USC and Long Beach State matches in
the past, and I think that will happen
again this year."
