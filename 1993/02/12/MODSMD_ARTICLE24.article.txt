# Women's hoops heads to Harmon
## 
### Brian Border Staff Writer 
Tonight the eighth-ranked Stanford women's basketball
team kicks off the second half of its Pacific 10 Conference sea
son with a difficult assignment: trying to conquer No. 25 Cal
ifornia on the Golden Bears' home court.
Although the Cardinal (17-4, 8-2 Pac-10) has won 10 of the
last 11 meetings with its rival from across the bay, California
(13-5, 5-4) has proven to be a feisty opponent in recent
matchups. Last year, the Bears squashed the Cardinal 74-65
at Berkeley, showing that the home court advantage at Har
mon Gymnasium can make a big difference.
"Once it (Harmon) gets packed, the fans are really on top
of you," said Stanford sophomore guard Kate Paye.
Cal also gave the Cardinal a fierce battle earlier this season
at Maples Pavilion. The Bears trailed by just six points with 11
minutes remaining before Stanford pulled away to win, 89-63.
The best way for the Cardinal to continue its domination of
Cal would be for its guards to keep feeding the ball to centers
Val Whiting and Anita Kaplan near the basket.
Whiting, an Ail-American senior, is leading Stanford in
points and rebounds, averaging 18.5 and 9.7, respectively. She
was a crucial factor in the Cardinal's last victory over Cal,
burning the Bears' defenders for 29 points.
Kaplan has been the mqjor offensive contributor of late for
the Cardinal. The 6-foot-5 sophomore accumulated 17 points
against Arizona and played an even bigger role against Arizona
State as she exploded for 25 points. Kaplan also pulled down a
total of 17 rebounds in leading Stanford to a pair of victories.
"She's been scoring and playing really well against anyone
that guards her," coach Tara VanDerveer said. "Our perime
ter players are doing a real good job of getting her the ball."
However, the Stanford squad must also focus on thwarting
a potent California offense.
In particular, Stanford will assign Paye, a part-time
starter, to shadow 6-foot-l point guard Milica Vukadinovic for
most of the game. In the Cardinal's previous contest against
California, Paye did an effective job of shutting down Vukadi
novic, holding her under her scoring average.
Still, Paye admits it will be quite a challenge to guard one
of the best players in the Pac-10 for a second time.
"Vukadinovic is a great player," she said. "[Cal] uses a lot
of screens in their offense to get her open."
The Cardinal hopes to close those openings and start the
second half of its conference season on a high note.
