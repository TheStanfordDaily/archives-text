# Heisick nears twilight of remarkable 13-year career
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Whatever happened to that 16-
year-old who won the Olympic
100-meter breastatroke title? Or
how about the 15-year-old world
champion in that same event?
Lori Heisick, still swimming
strong at age 22, knows that most
people grow out of the breast
stroke at an early age, even if she
can't remember their names. The
event employs a style that pro
duces many young superstars, but
not many consistent ones.
"It's a weird event, in that a lot
of people are just a flash in the
pan," Heisick said. "They start
really young, come out and swim
really great, but you never hear
from them again. I think the most
exciting aspect of my career is my
consistency in that event."
Heisick broke onto the interna
tional scene at the tender age of 16
by capturing a gold and a silver at
the 1987 Pan-American Games,
and has been one of the top breast
strokers in the world ever since.
In 1988 she placed third at the
US Olympic trials and missed a
trip to Seoul by 0.9 seconds. How
ever, Heisick entered Stanford as
a freshman in 1989 and rebound
ed to place second in both the 100-
and 200-yard breaststroke events
at the 1990 NCAA Champi
onships.
As a sophomore, she enjoyed

one of the greatest moments of
her career as she captured the
NCAA individual title in the 100
breast and placed third in the 200.
After a successful junior sea
son, Heisick anticipated a spot on
the 1992 Olympic squad, but her
dreams were shattered by 0.05
seconds, the difference between

Barcelona, Spain and Edina,
Minn. — her home.
"Everything last season was
going just as planned, training
wise," Heisick said. "It's unfortu
nate that it's just one race on one
day. I didn't have a very good day.
Even today I wish that the
Olympic team was picked by an

overall performance year-round
and not by one race."
Even though Heisick came
back to place third in the 200
breast at the NCAA Champi
onships, her season was tarnished
forever.
"The disappointment of not
making the team last year was a
pain I have never felt before,
because it was so emotionally
draining," Heisick said. "I have
never believed in something so
much and not have it come true.
"I was just so mad at myself, at
the world, at God — I was just
mad at everything. But that made
me grow as a person and it made
me learn a lot about myself. The
hardest part, though, is that I'll
never know what would've hap
pened if I was 0.05 seconds
faster."
Despite the disappointment of
last year, Heisick will not let her
self dwell on the past, as she con
tinues to be one of the inspira
tional and emotional bastions on
the Cardinal squad. She keeps
everyone's spirits high in her own
special way.
"Everyone always teases me
about telling stories and talking
way too much. I can't just sit in
silence. Basically, love me, love my
stories."
She is always filled with little
anecdotes that only the Stanford
team is privy to, such as the time
when the men's team dared the

women's team to swim in the buff
once a week because the men did
the same every Wednesday.
"One day last year, when [head
coachl Richard [Quick] left us
alone we decided to do it," Heisick
said. "All of us swam with the top
part off, but that was as far as we
ever went. We've also done it a
couple of times this year — no big
deal."
Heisick's favorite story, howev
er, is about her rooming experi
ence with co-captain Janel Jor
gensen at last year's Pacific 10
Conference Championships.
"I had forgotten my contact
lens case so I told Janel that I had
dumped my contacts into a glass
of water on the dresser," accord
ing to Heisick. "When I woke up
the next morning the glass was
empty and it turns out that Janel
was thirsty and had drunk my
contacts.
"It was the most ridiculous
thing I have ever seen because I
did bring a spare contact lens, but
that meant I could only see in one
eye. Janel and I were laughing
uncontrollably all the way to the
meet."
It turns out that she swam with
one contact that day and captured
both the 100 and 200 breaststroke
races as the Cardinal took the
title.
As the conference champi
onship meet looms once again,
Heisick wants to repeat her feats

of a year ago and take them one
step further.
"Winning the (NCAA) individu
al 100 breast title and the team
title this year will be ideal,"
Heisick said. "It will help lessen
the pain of last year, but the most
meaningful thing I'll feel when I
get out of the pool after my last
race is the bond between (mem
bers of) this team.
"Sometimes, you have to take
a step back and look at all the
amazing people you're with
before you realize what a special
group of people they are. Swim
ming is not an individual sport,
because there's no way that any
one of us could be where we are
right now without the help of
each other."
Heisick and her teammates will
finish out their regular season
tomorrow with a dual meet
against archrival California. They
will then have two weeks off
before the Pac-10 Championships
and another three before the
NCAA meet.
"I can't believe that the season
went so fast and I only have a few
weeks left in my 13-year career,"
Heisick said. "I'm just fortunate
to still be around and still be con
sistent."
With her cache of collegiate
accomplishments, Lori Heisick
should still be around in the minds
of Stanford fans long after she
hangs up her swimsuit.

Whatever happened to that 16-
year-old who won the Olympic
100-meter breastatroke title? Or
how about the 15-year-old world
champion in that same event?
Lori Heisick, still swimming
strong at age 22, knows that most
people grow out of the breast
stroke at an early age, even if she
can't remember their names. The
event employs a style that pro
duces many young superstars, but
not many consistent ones.
"It's a weird event, in that a lot
of people are just a flash in the
pan," Heisick said. "They start
really young, come out and swim
really great, but you never hear
from them again. I think the most
exciting aspect of my career is my
consistency in that event."
Heisick broke onto the interna
tional scene at the tender age of 16
by capturing a gold and a silver at
the 1987 Pan-American Games,
and has been one of the top breast
strokers in the world ever since.
In 1988 she placed third at the
US Olympic trials and missed a
trip to Seoul by 0.9 seconds. How
ever, Heisick entered Stanford as
a freshman in 1989 and rebound
ed to place second in both the 100-
and 200-yard breaststroke events
at the 1990 NCAA Champi
onships.
As a sophomore, she enjoyed

one of the greatest moments of
her career as she captured the
NCAA individual title in the 100
breast and placed third in the 200.
After a successful junior sea
son, Heisick anticipated a spot on
the 1992 Olympic squad, but her
dreams were shattered by 0.05
seconds, the difference between

Barcelona, Spain and Edina,
Minn. — her home.
"Everything last season was
going just as planned, training
wise," Heisick said. "It's unfortu
nate that it's just one race on one
day. I didn't have a very good day.
Even today I wish that the
Olympic team was picked by an

overall performance year-round
and not by one race."
Even though Heisick came
back to place third in the 200
breast at the NCAA Champi
onships, her season was tarnished
forever.
"The disappointment of not
making the team last year was a
pain I have never felt before,
because it was so emotionally
draining," Heisick said. "I have
never believed in something so
much and not have it come true.
"I was just so mad at myself, at
the world, at God — I was just
mad at everything. But that made
me grow as a person and it made
me learn a lot about myself. The
hardest part, though, is that I'll
never know what would've hap
pened if I was 0.05 seconds
faster."
Despite the disappointment of
last year, Heisick will not let her
self dwell on the past, as she con
tinues to be one of the inspira
tional and emotional bastions on
the Cardinal squad. She keeps
everyone's spirits high in her own
special way.
"Everyone always teases me
about telling stories and talking
way too much. I can't just sit in
silence. Basically, love me, love my
stories."
She is always filled with little
anecdotes that only the Stanford
team is privy to, such as the time
when the men's team dared the

women's team to swim in the buff
once a week because the men did
the same every Wednesday.
"One day last year, when [head
coachl Richard [Quick] left us
alone we decided to do it," Heisick
said. "All of us swam with the top
part off, but that was as far as we
ever went. We've also done it a
couple of times this year — no big
deal."
Heisick's favorite story, howev
er, is about her rooming experi
ence with co-captain Janel Jor
gensen at last year's Pacific 10
Conference Championships.
"I had forgotten my contact
lens case so I told Janel that I had
dumped my contacts into a glass
of water on the dresser," accord
ing to Heisick. "When I woke up
the next morning the glass was
empty and it turns out that Janel
was thirsty and had drunk my
contacts.
"It was the most ridiculous
thing I have ever seen because I
did bring a spare contact lens, but
that meant I could only see in one
eye. Janel and I were laughing
uncontrollably all the way to the
meet."
It turns out that she swam with
one contact that day and captured
both the 100 and 200 breaststroke
races as the Cardinal took the
title.
As the conference champi
onship meet looms once again,
Heisick wants to repeat her feats

of a year ago and take them one
step further.
"Winning the (NCAA) individu
al 100 breast title and the team
title this year will be ideal,"
Heisick said. "It will help lessen
the pain of last year, but the most
meaningful thing I'll feel when I
get out of the pool after my last
race is the bond between (mem
bers of) this team.
"Sometimes, you have to take
a step back and look at all the
amazing people you're with
before you realize what a special
group of people they are. Swim
ming is not an individual sport,
because there's no way that any
one of us could be where we are
right now without the help of
each other."
Heisick and her teammates will
finish out their regular season
tomorrow with a dual meet
against archrival California. They
will then have two weeks off
before the Pac-10 Championships
and another three before the
NCAA meet.
"I can't believe that the season
went so fast and I only have a few
weeks left in my 13-year career,"
Heisick said. "I'm just fortunate
to still be around and still be con
sistent."

accomplishments, Lori Heisick
