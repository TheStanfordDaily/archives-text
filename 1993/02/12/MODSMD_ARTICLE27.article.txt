# Cardinal sluggers square off with pitching-rich Bulldogs
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
A pitching-rich Fresno State club
comes to Sunken Diamond this weekend,
offering the No. 13 Cardinal (4-2) per
haps its biggest offensive challenge of the
year.
"Their strength is definitely their
pitching," said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "Their top two starting pitchers
are outstanding."
The No. 17 Bulldogs (4-0) have
allowed a Scrooge-like two earned runs
per game thus far. More impressively, the
Fresno State staff has averaged 11
strikeouts per game.

Leading the Bulldog charge is Steve
Soderstrom, a right-handed fireballer
who was rated the eighth-best pitching
prospect in the country by Baseball
America.
"Steve is coming off an outstanding
year," said Fresno State coach Bob Ben
nett. "He's a dominating-type pitcher."
Indeed, Soderstrom's performance
thus far backs up his coach's praises. The
junior has yet to allow a run this season,
and has struck out 19 batters in 11
innings of work.
The Bulldogs' scheduled Sunday
starter, Mike Salazar, was almost as
impressive in his season debut, holding
Loyola Marymount to two hits over six

innings.
The senior faced the Cardinal last sea
son, losing a 10-5 decision. In that game,
Marquess started a predominantly right
handed lineup against the left-handed
Salazar, and the strategy worked to per
fection. Expect to see more of the same
this weekend.
It is against the tough Bulldog staff
that the Cardinal batsmen hope to
improve their offensive production,
which has been sluggish of late.
"Offensively, I don't think we're hit
ting the ball as well as we can," Marquess
said. "Hopefully, we'll continue to
improve."
In particular, Marquess looks for

added power from first baseman Dusty
Allen, who is off to a slow start. Allen
blasted the first home run of his Stanford
career, a monstrous 450-foot shot,
against Fresno State last season.
Batting a paltry .174, Allen showed
signs of picking up the pace against the
University of the Pacific on Tuesday.
The Cardinal cleanup hitter made
solid contact in each of his four trips to
the plate, picking up a single and a sac
rifice fly.
"I know it's only a matter of time
before Dusty turns things around," Mar
quess said. "I'm not worried about him."
Freshman Cale Carter and a trio of
sophomores — Steve Carver, Todd

Laßocca and Jed Hansen — have carried
the Stanford offense in the team's first
six games.
Carter, a switch-hitter, has estab
lished himself as the Cardinal's center
fielder and leadoff hitter, batting safely in
every game this season; he also leads the
club with six walks.
Carver has found his niche at desig
nated hitter, leading Stanford in hits (10)
and batting average (.500).
Marquess moved middle infielders
Laßocca and Hansen, who have com
bined for 12 runs batted in, up to the
No. 2 and 3 spots against Pacific in
hopes of bolstering the top of the
order.
