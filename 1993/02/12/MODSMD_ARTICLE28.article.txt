## Men shuffle lineup for Rebels, Anteaters 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
By tomorrow afternoon, the
Cardinal men's tennis team
could be 5-0 and on the road to
another extremely successful
season. This afternoon, No. 2
Stanford (3-0) takes on Neva
da-Las Vegas (2-3) and tomor
row, UC-Irvine (3-1) at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal has never bat
tled the Runnin' Rebels, but
with an aggressive coach, UNLV
should put up a good fight. Larry
Easley, in his third year with the
Rebels, has a record of bringing
anonymous squads to national
prominence. From only 1984
t01987, he led an unknown Long
Beach State team to a No. 2
national ranking.
Saturday's duel with the
Anteaters should also be a good
warmup for the Stanford men,
before they head to the Nation
al Team Indoor Championships
in Louisville, Ky. next week.
The Cardinal lineup is still
questionable, especially in the

doubles formation, where
coach Dick Gould is still search
ing for a solid team to put in the
top spot.
"We haven't played a good
match at No. 1 yet," Gould said.
On Tuesday, juniors Michael
Flanagan and Chris Cocotos
paired up against San Jose
State and last week, classmate
Robert Devens and senior cap
tain Roman Sydorak took on
San Diego. Both Cardinal
tandems lost.
Court logistics will be
slightly confusing this week
end, as the women's team has
a pair of home matches as well.
A coin toss between Gould and
Frank Brennan, the women's
coach, has determined that the
men will take the back courts
today at 1:30 p.m., but start on
the front courts tomorrow at
noon.
After the doubles matches
tomorrow, the men will play
singles on the back courts so
that the women can start their
match at 1 p.m. on the front
courts.
