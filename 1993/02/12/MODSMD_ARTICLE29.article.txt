# Women look to preserve shutout streak
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
The second-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team has
had a relatively easy time in
this young season, ripping
largely outclassed teams like
Fresno State and Washington
State and handing its oppo
nents more goose eggs than
the Easter Bunny.
Now, however, the party is
over. It's time to play tennis.
Stanford (4-0, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) will meet its first
real test of the year when it
hosts No. 9 Pepperdine today
and No. 15 San Diego State
tomorrow at Stanford Tennis
Stadium. Today's match begins
at 1:30 p.m., while tomorrow's
contest starts at 1 p.m.
"These two teams will tell
us a lot about our team and
how our players play against
quality opponents," said coach
Frank Brennan. "They'll be
tough â€” they're solid teams,
top to bottom."
Stanford will get some
much-needed help from its top
competitors, some of whom sat
out of Wednesday's match
against Washington State to
rest for this weekend's match

es. Laxmi Poruri, ranked sec
ond in the nation by the Inter
collegiate Tennis Association,
will return to the lineup
against the Waves today. Her
opponent will most likely be
Nina Eriksson, ranked No. 47
by the ITA.
Also returning to the Cardi
nal starting six is senior cap
tain Heather Willens. Willens,
who captured the Rolex
National Indoor Championship
last Sunday, will most likely
play in the No. 2 spot for Stan
ford. She is currently ranked
14th in the ITA standings.
Junior Kristine Kurth is
still questionable for today's
match because of a lung infec
tion that has bothered her for
the past week. If Kurth doesn't
play, junior Emma Woodhouse
will likely take over at the No. 6
spot for the Cardinal. Fresh
men Beth Berris and Kim
Shasby should round out the
starting singles lineup.
Poruri and Willens will
return to the No. 1 doubles
position against the 18th
ranked team of Eriksson and
Merete Stockmann. Because of
Kurth's uncertain status, how
ever, the two other doubles
positions are not yet set.
