## EV residents call 'town meeting' to discuss asbestos, storage, lack of communication with administrators 
### Michael Slemmer Staff Writer 
A group of Escondido Village residents, upset about
a lack of communication with University administra
tors, voiced their concerns and brainstormed ways to
bring about change at a "town hall" meeting last night.
The meeting, which drew about 40 residents, was
called in order to discuss storage, safety and asbestos
problems.
Residents also suggested various ways to address
these concerns, such as forming a village council, cir
culating petitions, writing letters and meeting with
University administrators.
"We need to make positive suggestions and involve
everyone," said Raoul Diaz, the husband of a gradu
ate student.
"We need to work with [the University]. . . . We
need to do our best to let them know that we're angry

and want to do something about it," added Mary Lea
McAnally, a student at the Graduate School of Busi
ness who organized the meeting.
One of the problems the residents discussed was the
possible removal of storage sheds and awnings, which
is their most recent frustration with the University.
"The University said that this is being done be
cause of safety, equity and aesthetics," said McAnal
ly. "This explanation is a smokescreen. The Univer
sity made a decision and is now trying to give reasons
so that we will accept it."
Christine Griffith, the director of graduate resi
dences, told the group that storage was an "ongoing"
problem. "We want to work on the issue with lEscon
dido residents]," she said.
Residents also expressed dissatisfaction at the ne
cessity of their high rent payments. "Last year, [resi-
dents] paid $10.2 million in rent,"
said McAnally. But, little of that
money seems to be applied to
Escondido, she added.
"Thirty years ago, the money
collected in Escondido Village
stayed here," said Mike Murray, a
graduate student. "Then the Uni
versity saw that Escondido was a

profit center and decided to take it
over."
Underlying the concerns about
storage and other issues raised at
the meeting, however, was a more
general interest in establishing
effective lines of communication
between residents and with the
University.
Although a meeting for gradu
ate students with University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper is scheduled
for Tuesday afternoon at Rains,
many of the residents at yester

day's meeting said they were
uncertain how to address their con
cerns in general to the University
"We don't know who has the
power over Escondido," added
McAnally. "That's the first step
â€” we need to find out who's in
charge."
"We did not create this polar
ized situation," added Diaz. "The
University started the process.
Now we must come together as a
community to find and imple
ment solutions to our problems."
