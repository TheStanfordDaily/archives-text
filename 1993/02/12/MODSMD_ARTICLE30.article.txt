# Gymnasts seek revenge on Golden Bears
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
For any Stanford team, losing once to Cali
fornia is a painful experience. Two defeats in
one season at the hands of Cal can be down
right depressing, especially for defending
national champions.
Although the Cardinal men's gymnastics
team is officially 0-1 on the season, the squad
has competed in three meets, including two
losses to the Bears. Tonight, No. 15 Stanford
returns to action after a three-week hiatus to
face No. 12 Cal and San Jose State at Spartan
Gym at 7 p.m.
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada is not par
ticularly worried about the Cardinal's early
season losses, preferring to stick to his overall
strategy — peaking in time for the conference,
regional and NCAA championships.
"I think we will be going at about 80 per
cent in this meet," Hamada said. He is count
ing on junior co-captain Mark Booth and

junior Jason Cohen, both of whom will enter
the all-around competition, to lead the team.
Senior Jair Lynch, usually the team's high
est scorer in the all-around, will perform in, at
most, three of the six disciplines, because he is
inserting newly learned skills into his rou
tines. Despite Lynch's absence from the all
around, Hamada still aims for a team score of
275, by his estimations enough to beat Cal.
"Consistency is the major thing that I am
looking for in this meet," Hamada said. "I
think our game plan is right on target. Our dif
ficulty is much higher than that of other teams
and now, after a break from competition, we
should be able to hit all of our routines."
In addition to Booth and Cohen, Hamada
expects sophomore Jing-Wei Liang, as well as
seniors Jeff Bender and Shawn Adamek, to
boost the Cardinal's overall score.
"None of us want to lose to Berkeley, espe
cially three times in one season," Adamek
said. "We are a little more inspired now to
boost our level of competition. With close to a

full lineup and as long as we're consistent, we
shouldn't have any problem winning."
While the Cardinal remains confident
about its chances of winning tonight's meet,
the Bears also have reason to feel good about
the first half of their season. Led by senior
Marc Feingold and junior James Guay, the
Bears outscored Stanford 273.05-268.80
when the two teams met last month in the
Cardinal's first dual meet of the season.
Unlike many sports, gymnastics postsea
son berths do not depend on a team's record,
but rather on its top three scores during the
season. Starting tonight, Stanford will
approach each contest aiming for the highest
team score possible in order to qualify for the
conference championships.
"I am very confident at this point in the
season because our basic difficulty level is
very high," Hamada said. "As long as we keep
improving our consistency, I feel even more
comfortable than last year about our chances
at the championship."
