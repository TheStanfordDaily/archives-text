# Women clash Titans
## 
### Sean May Staff Writer 
Last month, in its season opener,
the No. 17 Stanford women's gym
nastics team lost big to the Cal State-
Fullerton Titans. But the Cardinal is
a better team than it was a month
ago, and .. ."We want revenge," said
sophomore Meegan Lannin.
The Cardinal will have its
chance when the Titans visit Burn
ham Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Stanford's first competition
since Jem. 29.
Stanford (3-2, 2-1 Pacific 10
Conference) is hoping for a repeat
of last year's series with Fullerton,
in which the Cardinal shook ofT an
early-season road loss to score a big
win at home.
Cardinal coach Breck Green
wood, for one, thinks the squad has
what it takes to win.
"This is the most ready we'll be
all year for a meet," he said, adding
that the two-week break has given
the team more time to focus on
tonight's showdown and beat the
fatigue that had started to set in.
"We all needed a little rest so
that we could collect our
thoughts," said sophomore Tina
Snowden.
Freshman Hillary Anderson
agreed:] "We're a lot more motivat
ed this Week."
According to assistant coach
Lisa Mitzel-Izzi, the break has also
allowed the athletes to concentrate
on developing more difficult skills
and integrate them into their rou
tines. On floor exercise especially,
some of the team members have
added new tumbling passes that
should increase their scores.
Stanford will need high marks

to stay with the Titans. Fullerton
has shaken its recent reputation as
a fast-starting, slow-finishing team
with consistent scores in the 191.0-
192.0 range this season. In com
parison, the Cardinal's best score
thus far is 189.975.
Returning to the Cardinal's
lineup will be junior Laurie West,
who has been out all season with a
foot iryury but will compete on bars
and beam tonight.
"Her bars are as good as they've
ever been because that's all she's
been doing for two months,"
Greenwood said.
Tonight's meet also marks a
homecoming of sorts, as Stanford
will compete in Burnham Pavilion,
instead of Maples, for the first time
this year.
Burnham is a favorite for the
team because the crowd is right on
top of the action — spectators sit
as close as eight feet to the balance
beam.
"Burnham is more homey,"
Snowden said. "The fans feel more
involved."
"It feels like the fans are right
behind you," Lannin added.
Both Greenwood and Mitzel-
Izzi were thrilled about the quality
of practices early this week, and
indicated that this rejuvenated
Cardinal squad will be much better
than the one that the "Red
Hot" Invitational two weeks ago.
"If we hit, we should have
191.5-192.0," Greenwood said.
"They're finally starting to
believe that they're a top team,"
Mitzel-Izzi added. However, she
stopped short of making any pre
dictions about tonight's show
down. "We can still only do the best
we can do."
