# Dead Ed's trip through the afterlife
## 
### 
No one was too surprised when my Uncle
Ed shot his willie off. Ever since Viet
nam— Ed got dishonorably discharged
from the Missoula, Mont. National Guard
Armory when he tried to frag the base comman
der with a cherry bomb taped to a can of shaving
cream— he had slept with a loaded gun under
his pillow. As near as any of us could tell, one
night Ed woke up, looked down, saw what he
thought was an intruder and shot it. An hour
later he bled to death.
But, although we'd miss the Beef-N-Cheddar
stick every Christmas, none of us were too sad
to see Ed go, especially since he didn't have
hardly anything in his will. Indeed, the only per
son having trouble coping with Ed's death was
his grandson, Cletus. And since I was stuck
babysitting little Clete while the rest of the fam
ily was off at the funeral, I got caught answering
the hard questions:
"Did Ed go to a better place?" Cletus asked
me suddenly during Family Feud's commercial
break.
"Sure," I said. "Any place is better than Mis
soula, Montana."
"No, I mean what happened after he died?
Where did he go."
I leaned back in my chair. How could I
explain death to a nine-year old? How could I
explain the afterlife to a third grader? How
could I explain fractions to that football player
in my Calc class?
I thought through all the prepared speeches
we use everyday: God works in strange ways;
my secretary accidentally erased those 15 min
utes of tape; no, it's not two numbers on a little

see-saw.
But I knew none of those excuses would
work. I had to try and tell the truth.
"Cletus," I said.
"Yeah?"
"Take the cat out of your mouth and listen
up. Ed's in heaven now."
Clete gave me a look like Dan Quayle watch
ing that "How a Bill becomes a Law" episode of
Schoolhouse Rock. I knew I had to explain
more.
So I told him how heaven was this great
place, where everyone loved everybody (except
maybe Bette Middler, but only because of her
"Divine Miss M" period). I told him about Dante
and Milton. I told him how God numbered the
hairs on our heads, and counted the sparrow's
fall, because He didn't have anything better to
do.
Clete scratched his head.
"So, how do you get into heaven?" he asked.
Since Cletus hadn't expressed this much inter
est in anything since the Judds break-up, I kept

going.
I tried to explain religion to him. I told him
how there were different groups that had dif
ferent beliefs, mostly involving how many rel
atives God has and whether you can eat pork.
I said most of these groups believe there is, in
fact, a wonderful place you go to after you die,
as long as you lead a good life and don't belong
to any of the other groups, in which case you
go to hell— which is kind of like an eternal
CIV section with an Andrew Lloyd Weber
score.
I told him that once you do get into heaven,
you get to meet God or L. Ron Hubbard,
depending on your point of view, and everyone
sits around all day watching reruns of "Bonan
za" and the 1976 NCAA Final Four.
And, finally, I think he understood.
"You mean," Clete asked, "if I'm good, and
quit shooting BB's at the dog, after I die I can go
to a country full of chocolate sundaes and skate
boards, and I'll never have a bedtime?"
"Maybe," I said.
Cletus smiled and turned back to the televi
sion.
I put my feet up and thought of Eld in his
heaven, watching "The Dukes of Hazard,"
drinking a beer, maybe bowling a few frames,
and I realized maybe there is a heaven for every
one — even idiots.
Or maybe we just go to sleep for ever and
ever.
Either way, it beats midterms. Or watching
"Geraldo."
And maybe, just maybe, you'll get to see Bob
Knight.
