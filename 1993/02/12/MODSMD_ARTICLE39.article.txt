# 'Speak-out' targets Indian conflict
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
With the intention of educating the Stanford
community about recent strife in South Asia, the ad
hoc Committee Against Communal Violence in
South Asia held a "Speak out Against Communal
Violence" rally at noon yesterday in White Plaza.
The central purpose of the rally, which featured
student and faculty speakers as well as audience par
ticipation, was to highlight the multiple causes of
the recent Hindu-Muslim conflict in India. The
speakers urged an audience of about 50 to parallel
the events in South Asia with recent controversies in
the United States such as the L.A. riots. Many of the
speakers wished to attribute less of the responsibili
ty for the incidents to religious differences.
Conflicts between the two groups, which date back
to 1855 and British imperialism, reignited when fun
damentalist Hindu groups demolished a Muslim
mosque in Ayodhya, India Dec. 6. It was the second
time the mosque had been attacked in three years.
"We must recognize that religion is a blank card
and a rhetorical form of political mobilization," said
Asst. English Prof. Suvir Kaul.

Following the scheduled speakers, both Hindu
and Muslim students then offered their perspectives
on the conflict.
Samir Singh, an assistant at the medical school,
and Hammerskold resident assistant Siddhartha
Muhheyee talked of the need for an active ideology
of tolerance and respect.
Graduate student Amit Rai spoke of the difficul
ties of aiming for a pure secularism in a country with
a 6,000-year heritage woven with religion.
Rai, who is himself a Hindu, offered a critical look
at his culture. "The Hindu fundamentalists of India
are using the Muslims as scapegoats for a wide range
of social ills from unemployment to a lack of Hindu
self-esteem," Rai said.
Kaul pointed out that for many professionals from
India, it is difficult to feel the immediacy of the con
flicts. "For many Indians who are far away from India,
there's a sort of benign professionalism that covers a
great deal of how we react to events there," Kaul said.
"The south Asian community in America in search of
an identity look backwards to nostalgic Hinduism."
The ad hoc Committee will hold a teach-in to edu
cate people about the situation Tuesday at 1 p.m. in
Tresidder Union.
