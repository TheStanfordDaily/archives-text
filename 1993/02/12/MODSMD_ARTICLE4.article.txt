# Meyer remodeling nears finish
## Renovations yield 24-hour study space, disabled access 
### Sarah Katz 
A library is no place for con
struction crews, large trucks and
noisy fire alarms. But for the past
nine months, these distractions
have been commonplace at Meyer
Library, where extensive remodel
ing has been underway to con
struct a 24-hour study space,
handicapped accessible bath
rooms and a new loan desk.
Just in time for finals, the end
of this activity may be in sight. Ac
cording to library administrative
staff, a new and improved Meyer is

scheduled to be ready for student
use by Dead Week.
Inside, students will find many
changes, including an all-night
study area, something students
have requested for several years.
"Nobody's ever had the space to
pull off something like this," said
Kathy Fehrn, office manager for
Meyer's Research and Informa
tion Technologies Support Group.
The room for the study space was
created by rearranging other li
brary services.
The room, which takes the
place of the old media center on

the southeast corner of the first
floor, will accomodate about 50 to
60 people and will be equipped
with about 12 tables. For security
reasons, the room's outside doors
will be locked during the day. At
night, the inside doors will be
closed off while the outside doors
will remain open.
In addition, the recent passage
of the Americans with Disabilities
Act requires the renovation of
Meyer's restrooms. Unisex handi
capped restrooms are currently
being added to the third and
fourth floors. Ground floor bath
rooms, which already have some
handicapped access, are also being
brought up to present codes.
Most of Meyer's remodeling
was completed in the fall. The
media center was expanded and
moved to the second floor, shar
ing the space with the language
lab and computer cluster.
The project was sparked after
the 1989 earthquake destroyed sev
eral departments in Green. Many of
Green's "technical service" employ
ees, specializing mainly in the
acquisition and cataloguing of
books, were left without workspace.
As plans were made to move them
to the fourth floor of Meyer, Fehrn
said it seemed like a natural time to
remodel the whole library.
"We were scaling back on staff
and reorganizing anyway," she
said. "All of that threw us into a
remodeling mode."
