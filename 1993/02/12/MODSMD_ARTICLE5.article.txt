# Bookstore costs from state probe near $900K
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore's legal and ac
counting costs are approaching $900,000 as
the state's investigation of the store's busi
ness practices prepares to enter its second
year, according to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg.
"We are very, very upset," said Weisberg,
interim president of the Bookstore's board
of directors. "Protracting the investigation
like this is itself inflicting terrible injuries
on the corporate assets."
But Deputy Attorney General James
Schwartz contends that the probe, launched
in February 1992 to determine whether the
store complied with state laws governing
nonprofit organizations, has uncovered new
issues.
"We are subpoenaing documents," he
said. "As in all investigations, if additional
issues come to the fore," the inquiry must
continue, said Schwartz. He originally esti
mated that it would take three months, end
ing by May 1992.
The investigation was sparked by a Daily
report last February that the Bookstore pro
vided perquisites unheard of elsewhere in
the industry to its senior employees, includ
ing use of a vacation home, a sailboat, a
motor home and several pricey automobiles.
The Daily also reported that the Book
store invested in "rather speculative" stocks

and lost $1.8 million on the stock market
during the fiscal year ending June 30,1991.
Weisberg would not name a specific fig
ure for the cost of complying with the state
investigation, but said that an original esti
mate of $300,000 has "more than doubled."
"The costs [Schwartz] is causing us to
incur are approaching half of the [$1.8 mil
lion] 1990 financial loss whose causes he is
supposed to be investigating," Weisberg said.
Of the total costs so far, the first $300,000
paid for the store's own internal review last
spring. The three-month audit involved two
law firms and an accounting firm.
Schwartz said he does not know how much
longer his probe will continue. "The investi
gation has been proceeding aggressively," he
said, "and we are investigating all of the alle
gations [raised by The Daily] and additional
issues that have come to our attention."
He said he could not comment on what
those issues are or on the Bookstore's climb
ing legal and accounting expenses.
"I don't believe there is anything new,"
Weisberg said. "I think all he is looking at is
little bits and pieces of things that were
symptoms of the governance problems. . . .
The length and cost of the investigation are
far in excess of any remedies he needs to
pursue at this point."
