# Poet inspired by jazz, history

Inspired by jazz and his stay
at an internment camp during
World War 11, Lawson Inada
treats his poetry as a process of
self-discovery as well as a gift to
share.
A pioneer in Asian-Ameri
can literature, Inada brought
his memories, his voice and his
poetry to Stanford for a two
day visit which began yester
day with a creative expression
workshop.
Inada's status as an artist
in-residence in Okada House is
especially important because he
rediscovered John Okada's out
of-print novel "No-No Boy,"
the first novel by a Japanese-
American about the World War
II internment camps.
The camps are also relevant
to his own poetry. "(They are)
something I lived through and
think about and write about,"
he said.
Inada, an English professor
at Southern Oregon State Col
lege, has just published a collec
tion of poetry titled "Legends
from Camp," which coincides
with the 50th anniversary of
the Japanese internment.
Edward Iwata, Okada's resi
dent fellow, emphasized Inada's
significance as "one of the forces,
one of the early literary scholars
and pioneers who helped
create an Asian-American

Lawson Inada, a pioneer in Asian-American literature, displays his
musical talent during a creative-expression workshop in Okada
yesterday. Inada says his poetry is inspired by his stay at an in
ternment camp during World War II and by jazz music. "Listening
to the music gave me a sense of the greater world. I learned a lot
from the jazz greats," he said.
literature movement."
Inada said his poetry is as
inspired by music as by his Asian-
American heritage. "Listening to
the music gave me a sense of the
greater world. I learned a lot from
the jazz greats," he said.
When he was in college, Inada
wanted to be a jazz musician but
his teacher encouraged him to
pursue poetry.
In the end, Inada said he chose
poetry over song lyrics because he
had been writing poetry off-and
on since childhood, while he had
only just started to study music.
But music still affects his
work — and his teaching style. "I
start off by having the students
try to write song lyrics because
that's poetry," he said. "And the
thing about song lyrics is there's
a form, so you begin to learn
form.
Inada said his teaching is often
a source of inspiration in his

work. "I get a lot out of my teach
ing. I get a lot of energy from my
students. I love teaching," he
said. "It gives you deadlines to
meet. You can't get lazy when
you're teaching."
But Inada has had some time
off from directing students —
thanks to two different fellow
ships from the National Endow
ment for the Arts. "What (a fel
lowship! can do, is buy you a little
time. You can take time off from
your job and just write."
Inada said he sees poetry as a
type of performance art. "I just
want to give it away. I get a lot of
reward from writing it because it's
a process of discovery," he said.
As a teacher, Inada offers lots
of advice to struggling poets.
"Follow your instinct and keep at
it, or maybe I should say listen to
your instincts.
"You can sit and think and
think and think but sometimes
something else takes over," he
said. "It's a freeing thing so I say
just trust it. Be ready when the
idea comes. Otherwise you lose it
like a dream."
