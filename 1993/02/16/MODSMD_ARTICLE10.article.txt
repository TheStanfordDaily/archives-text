# Clinton unveils economic agenda
## Higher taxes, fewer programs in store for American people 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton issued an economic "call to arms"
last night, asking Americans in a tele
vised address to accept a painful package
of tax increases and spending cuts as the
price for rebuilding the nation's economy.
The president lambasted the 12 years
of Republican economics and said that
the stakes are high as he readies his own
program. "Change this fundamental
will not be easy nor will it be quick," he
said. "But at stake is the control of our
economic destiny."
Clinton's economic program — to be
unveiled in a speech to a joint meeting of
Congress tomorrow night — will be a far
cry from the middle-class tax cuts that
he advocated during his campaign.
During his 11-minute preview, Clin
ton said he had hoped to improve educa
tion, reform health care and create jobs
"without asking more of you." However,
he said, "I cannot — because the deficit
has increased so much, beyond my earli
er estimates, beyond even the worst
estimates from last year."
Promising to spread the pain among
all, Clinton said 70 percent of the taxes
he would propose "fall on the shoulders
of those who make more than $100,000 a
year." An administration official said
Clinton meant that seven out of 10 of the
higher taxes would affect the wealthy —

not that they would pay 70 percent of the
additional burden.
The payoff from his plan, Clinton
promised, will be "millions of long-term,
good-paying jobs, including a program
to jump-start our economy with another
500,000 jobs in 1993 and 1994."
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
delivered a crisp response to Clinton's
address, expressing skepticism that the
administration was cutting spending far
enough before asking for more taxes.
"We've both heard lots of speeches
about 'sacrifice,' but wfe'll be working
with you to make certain that sacrifice
isn't just a presidential code word for
more taxes, more spending and more
mandates from Washington," Dole said.
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said he hoped people wouldn't
rush to judgment on Clinton's program.
"I emphasized that while it's not like
ly that any one of us will agree with every
single point in his economic program, it
has to be viewed as a whole," he said.
Clinton's plan envisions roughly
$500 billion in tax increases and spend
ing reductions on many popular pro
grams over four years to cut the deficit.
Big corporations and wealthy Ameri
cans face significant boosts in their
income tax rates.
One provision that will affect all Amer

icans is a broad-based energy tax, based on
the heat content of fuels, including elec
tricity, coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline.
Clinton has said the heat-content
approach would be more progressive than
a tax based strictly on sales.
Clinton wants Congress to approve the
$31 billion stimulus plan within three to
four weeks, and then enact the remainder
of his economic program by August, said
spokesman George Stephanopoulos.
The Clinton plan also calls for spend
ing increases to stimulate the economy:
$15 billion for an investment tax credit
to help small companies buy new
machinery, and $16 billion for job
intensive projects like highway and
bridge construction. There also will be
increased spending for child immuniza
tion programs and Head Start.
Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky.,
came away from a meeting with Clinton
saying he expected the president to pro
pose higher taxes on tobacco and alco
hol. Clinton also is prepared to seek
restrictions on Medicare payments for
doctors and hospitals.
Stephanopoulos said Clinton's plan
would contain about 150 specific spend
ing cuts. "This is going to be more
spending reductions than any package
in the past," he said. "He's serious
about cutting spending."
