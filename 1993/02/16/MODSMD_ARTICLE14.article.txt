Casper's three-year plan
a noble effort, but based
on unrealistic blueprint

$97,240 FOR A FOUR-YEAR
diploma is bad. But how much
worse is $72,930 for a three
year "bargain" bachelor's degree?
University President Gerhard
Casper has publicly stated that the
four-year collegiate academic sys
tem should be reviewed. Instead of
the current system, Casper has
espoused an optional three-year
program, which would feature
"streamlined" programs designed
to allow students to focus on par
ticular fields of study.
Although Casper's initiative in
putting forth this plan should be
applauded, codifying an optional
three-year bachelor's program
would do more harm than good to
both Stanford and other universi
ties.
First, the three-year plan would
merely formalize the path that
many students already take toward
graduation. Numerous Stanford
students currently earn their
degrees in three or three-and-a-half
years; to give them only a "three
year" diploma would be selling
their achievements short.
In addition, the division between
students taking the current "four
year track" and the proposed
"three-year track" would undoubt
edly become largely based upon
class distinctions.
The" mWe "four
year" diplomas would go to those
students wealthy enough to afford
the extra year, while the latter
track would likely contain more
scholars who are unable to pay for
the additional schooling. However,
those students who would forgo
the "remedial" first year of college
would perhaps be those who need
it most, as many of them would
come from disadvantaged high
schools.
Another troublesome aspect of

the three-year plan is that it leaves
no place in a student's life for the
extracurricular activities — com
munity service, sports, study
abroad programs, and the like —
that form the lion's share of the col
lege "experience." As any student
can attest, it is rather difficult to
engage in outside activities when
bearing the burden of 19 or 20
units, which would be the norm for
three-year students.
In addition, the three-year diplo
ma program would undoubtedly
offer significantly less flexibility
within its confines than the current
system. If a student wished to
change majors under the rigid track
program, he or she would often be
out of luck. College is supposed to
be a place of self-discovery and
inspiration. The three-year pro-
CTam permits neither.
Furthermore, since the new plan
is seen as an answer to the financial
difficulties of both parents and uni
versities, it would likely be accom
panied by a cut in the amount of
grants and loans devoted to higher
education. After all, the reasoning
will go, under the new plan, college
has been made more affordable for
everyone, hasn't it?
However, the three-year plan
does little to address the issue of the
soaring cost of a college education;
instead, it dodges the issue by
requesting that students, not the
institutions themselves, make the
sacrifices necessary to bring about
financial sensibility.
The new plan arrives in the wake
of Stanford's announcement that
next year's bill for tuition, room
and board will reach $24,310 for
undergraduates. Casper's rationale
for his program is mainly a finan
cial one; presumably, the spiraling
cost of a college education has ren
dered the fourth year of college an
unaffordable luxury.
But in today's information age,
when a student's breadth of knowl
edge is more vital than at any time
before, shouldn't educators be
attempting to find innovative ways
to teach students more, instead of
less?
