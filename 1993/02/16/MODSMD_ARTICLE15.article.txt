Daily's lack of female columnists reflects gender bias

I WAS GLAD to see Jessica Bar take
the initiative in bringing up the dis
turbing lack of female columnists at
The Daily this quarter. I actually
applied to be a columnist precisely
because I felt that, while Andrea Parkes
did a great job last quarter, even one
woman columnist was not representa
tive enough of the composition of our
student body. I mean, let's face it, it's
not as if we're vastly outnumbered in
absolute terms, but women do have very
little voice on campus. I heard that the
reason Andrea was the only woman
columnist was due to the fact that only
three women applied for the position, as
compared to 45 men — I believe there
was even a Daily editorial written about

this. So I decided to apply, to at least up
the odds of a more equal representation.
When I dropped my application off in
The Daily's office, I noticed with some
relief that the top few applications in
the pile were in fact from women, and
expected to find at least one female
columnist chosen from this pool. But I
guess this was too much to expect, even
given the supposed "P.C. paradigm of
Daily politics."
I want to emphasize that I am not
bitter over not having personally been
chosen as a columnist. Nor would I
want anyone to be chosen as a "token"
figurehead purely in order to conform to
the P.C. mindset prevalent in this cam
pus. But I am tired of women's issues

being pushed to the side and those
women who try to heighten the whole
community's awareness of them being
labeled as radical male-bashing femi
nists. Rather, to use a friend of mine's
term, we should be viewed as "equal
ists" who think our perspective is just
as valid as men's, who know that cer
tainly there are enough women whose
writing is just as strong as men's (I
mean, take a look at the gender ratios in
most fuzzy classes), and who believe
that there is a real problem when one
half of our campus is not being repre
sented in the campus' main publication.
I find this even more ironic because one
of the columns I submitted addressed
gender roles and the lack of women's

empowerment on this campus.
I also want to stress that I do not
have a problem with the columnists
that have been chosen, per se. But I do
have a challenge for them: at least once,
write about an issue that is really
important to you — the more controver
sial, the better. It's very easy to write
about "fluffy" issues — you win lots of
points for being so casually witty and
entertaining. But it takes a lot more
guts to risk disapproval by laying your
beliefs out on the line. After this is
done, I will have much more respect for
The Daily's choice of columnists, in
spite of their gender discrimination.
