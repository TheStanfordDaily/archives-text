# Stanford Stadium and quarter system behind paucity of fan support
## 
### 
The first thing that I would like to
say in this letter is thanks to the football
team and coaches of the last five years
for their hard work, smarts and inspired
play, as well as the fun, excitement and
pride they have given the Stanford com
munity.
Recent letters to The Daily have criti
cized either the Band, the dollies or the
cheerleaders as partly responsible for a
lack of fan support at Stanford.
However, I think that all of these par
ties and the fans would benefit if two
structural problems could be alleviated:
Stanford Stadium's design is unfavor
able for viewing football games and for
fan involvement, and Stanford's quarter
based academic system is out of sync
with the football season.
Stanford Stadium is, to my eye, one of
the most beautiful in the nation. I love
the graceful arches and the sight of tree
tops above the Stadium's rim. But it

puts the fans too far away from the
action. We need a stadium without a
track around the football field and with
steeper stands. We need 40,000 to
50,000 great seats and another 10,000 to
30,000 good ones.
And how can we be happy when three
or four football games have already
passed before the students return for the
fall term? For the margined fan, this is
like walking into a movie having missed
the first half-hour. It has the effect of
undercutting fan support drastically.
Some possible solutions are: first,
changing to the semester system; sec
ond, moving fall quarter so that it starts
in early September and adjusting and
adapting the other quarters as well; or,
finally, moving fall quarter so it starts in
mid-September, and begin and end our
football season two weeks later â€” end
ing when Army and Navy do.
The small crowds and relative apathy
are an embarrassment to Stanford. The
Department of Athletics and the athletes
have done a great job; they deserve bet
ter.
To improve the stadium and adjust
the schedule would both be enormous
challenges; however, Stanford has met

big challenges before. The Band, the dol
lies, the cheerleaders and the fans would
all be better off if we could succeed.
