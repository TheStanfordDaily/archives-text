# Bookstore indignation at investigation's cost unworthy of sympathy
## 
### 
The comments by Prof. Weisberg in
the Feb. 12 Daily article concerning the
investigation into the Bookstore's ques
tionable management practices were
bothersome in that they appeared to
reflect an insensitivity to the type of
casual abuse of ethical standards that
seems to have almost become institu
tional in our culture. In the article, he is
quoted as complaining about the exces
sive cost of the state investigation, com
pared to the amount of money the book
store has presumably lost in the stock
market and through possibly question
able management. Assuming the state
investigator is honestly doing his job, I
wonder why a comparison of money lost
and spent is a reason to be upset. To
draw an analogy, if one were considering

building a flood-control project built to
prevent a predictable pattern of flood
related damage, would you wait until the
damage caused by flooding exceeded the
cost of the project by, say, a factor of 10
before starting construction? We've
already seen the questionable pattern of
Bookstore management practices emerge
in a series of Daily articles. Perhaps it's
time to spend the money now rather
than lose or misspend much more, at
customer expense, over the next decade.
Prof. Weisberg would be better off inves
tigating whether the charges are true
rather than whether it's expensive to get
caught.
If, on the other hand, the state inves
tigator is being overly aggressive or abu
sive, as Prof. Weisberg contends, then I
too would be upset that our state agency
is being wasteful — but it is ironic that
two wasteful organizations have to tan
gle. Sorry, the Bookstore still has not
earned my sympathy, and I'm pleased to
know that there is now another on-cam
pus alternative (not that I buy any of the
overpriced Bookstore products in any
case).
