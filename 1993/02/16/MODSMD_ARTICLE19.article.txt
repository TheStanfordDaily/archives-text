## It's hard to find good help 
### 
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SECRET. I
don't know what multiculturalism
means. I'm not quite sure if it's a
political stance, a fashion trend or just a
good East European dinner served dur
ing Orientation. Somebody knew what it
meant, though, and his name was Greg
Ricks.
Mr. Ricks knew its meaning so well
that he received the title of "multicultur
al educator" and was given a monthly
salary to explain it to students.
I never knew Mr. Ricks. I never really
had any great desire to talk to him
(except for that urge to tell him the beret
thing just wasn't working, but that
doesn't really count).
I respected him, though. He was a
presence on campus, and could often be
seen visiting students in their dorms.
That's more than a lot of us can say for
our advisers.
But then, one day, Mr. Ricks left us to
go play "Cross The Line" on the East
Coast. That was nine months ago, That's
almost a year. The University hasn't
replaced him yet. HMMM, that's
strange.
Now, let's use our imaginations. Let's
say an administrator in Residential Edu
cation was forced to resign for using a con
trolled substance, say, cocaine. No, wait,
even better — let's say an administrator in
Residential Education was fired for video
taping unknowing residents in the nude.

That'd be a hoot, wouldn't it?
They'd be replaced pretty soon, don't
you think? When my adviser left for Italy,
for instance, it only took the University
six months to provide me with a new one.
And I thought that was slow.
Why has the University taken so long
to replace Mr. Ricks? I don't know, but
after spending close to a whole year with
out a "multicultural educator," we can
draw one of two conclusions:
• Either we never really needed a mul
ticultural educator in the first place, or
• We've gone without a key adminis
trator for almost an entire year.
Either way, the University looks a lit
tle silly.
What's more, the molasses-like p&ce of
the hiring is sending af clear message to
students: "multiculturalism isn't a big
deal with us." If I were a betting man, I'd
bet that the University doesn't want to
convey that message (and I'd win).
Sure they've formed a big committee
to find the replacement, but even the
smallest issues get a big committee devot
ed to them these days. And although they
often are, committees don't have to be
slow.
Yes, the delay is truly inexplicable.
Maybe they're asking detailed questions
about the candidates' child-care situa
tions. Who really knows?
If the University doesn't hurry up,
though, it's going to have a "COP prob

lem" on its hands. How do you justify —
especially in this time of drastic cost cut
ting — hiring an administrator we have
managed to get along without?
They'll probably do it, though. After
all, they justify having RAs in fraternity
houses. But Mr. Ricks, our former mul
ticultural educator, wasn't an RAin a
fraternity house, was he? No, he was all
over campus, connecting with students.
He answered their questions and con
cerns and seemed to have a good time
doing it.
be doing that right
now. Somebody could have been doing
that for nine months. Instead, we've been
in multicultural limbo. And nobody likes
that.
It's too late to do anything about it
now. The search committee will probably
soon announce the new "educator" with
much pomp and circumstance.
But it will be almost a year after Mr.
Ricks left. And that's just too long, even
for someone who doesn't know what mul
ticulturalism means.
