# Police say Ice-T visit is just another event
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Although police furor over Ice-T's song
"Cop Killer" has kept him from lecturing on
at least one college campus, the controver
sial singer is just another speaker to the
Stanford Police.
Ice-T's scheduled speech at Idaho State
University this month was canceled be
cause local police refused to provide securi
ty for the event, saying they didn't want to
endorse "Cop Killer."
But the idea of refusing security for Ice-
T's Saturday night speech hasn't even been
raised, said Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington.
"I wouldn't have been surprised if there
were some discussion about it (around the
station), but no one's even brought it up,"

Herrington said. "No one seems very con
cerned about Ice-T's politics."
And Roble resident assistant Nicole
Sanchez, who is organizing the speech, con
firmed that the police have been "nothing
but cooperative in this endeavor. I actually
thought (arranging security) would be a lot
more difficult than it was."
The speech, which will be given in Kres
ge Auditorium — not Cubberley, as origi
nally planned — will be called "A Conversa
tion with Ice-T," and will cover topics in
cluding his personal history and political
agenda, the validity of the criticism he re
ceives and First Amendment issues.
Although "Cop Killer" has raised the ire
of police officers nationwide since its release
in early 1992, Herrington believes it is "a
mistake" for them to confuse
their personal opinions with their
professional duty.
"(Ice-T] has as much right to
speak as I do or anyone else," Her
rington said. "He also has a right
to protection. That's how a free
society works — you protect every
one whether you disagree with
them or not. I've had to protect
Nazis and KKK members and a lot
of other people I find personally
offensive. But my personal feelings
or politics just aren't relevant.
"I don't ever want to see a time
in this country when the police
decide who gets protection and who
doesn't," Herrington continued.

"That might not make some of my
colleagues back East happy, but
that's how I feel."
And when it comes right down
to it, Herrington just doesn't feel
Ice-T or his music poses a serious
threat to the police force.
"I guess I just don't take him
that seriously," Herrington said.
"I've been in this business more
than 30 years, and I've heard peo
ple I've considered a lot more
threatening.
"I may not be so happy with
what he has to say. .. but there are
a lot of people who, for one reason
or another, don't like the police."
Not all police officers share Her
rington's outlook, however. Police
groups across the country have
called for a boycott of "Cop Killer."
While most of the furor has
come from East Coast cities, the

debate moved west this month
when the sheriffs department in
Pocatello, Idaho, refused to pro
vide security for a speech sched
uled on the Idaho State campus.
According to Kris Herup, a
senior at Idaho State who works
with the school's Student Pro
gram Board, the sheriffs office
refused to provide security
because they objected to "Cop
Killer" and because they antici
pated that the event — a speech
focusing on inner-city life and
First Amendment issues — would
incite violence.
To Herup, their refusal was
reprehensible. "I think they were
being very closed-minded; they
weren't looking at the whole pic
ture," she said.
Pocatello sheriffs office repre
sentatives could not be reached

for comment.
Objections to Ice-T's Idaho
State visit weren't limited to the
police, Herup said. The program
board received many angry calls
from community members who
wanted them to cancel the speech.
"All they knew was that he
wrote the song," she said. "Most
of them had never even heard it;
they just knew he wrote it."
Informed or not, the debate on
campus was fairly heated. "It was
pretty divided," Herup said.
"There weren't a whole lot of peo
ple who didn't care."
At Stanford, however, the
scene is considerably quieter.
Sanchez said she has only
received positive phone calls —
although she has heard rumors
that some people object — and
has "no expectation of violence."

Similar speeches have come off
without a hitch at the University
of Florida at Gainesville and Ohio
University in the past month.
Stanford police said they also
don't anticipate violence — either
by protestors or excited fans — at
the speech. Extra security will be
provided, however, due to the large
crowds the event is likely to draw.
"We're not so concerned that
people will attack him (or police
officers)," Herrington said. "But
he's an entertainer, and people
will probably want to get near
him, get his autograph."
Police will help escort Ice-T to
and from Kresge, but most of their
energy will be focused outside the
building. Officers will be stationed
at all of the auditorium's exits to
prevent people without tickets
from entering. "We're likely to

have a large crowd that wants to
get in, and we just can't accommo
date them," Herrington said.
All in all, the police are
approaching Ice-T the same way
they'd deal with any other speak
er, Herrington said. "It's pretty
standard stuff."
In fact, Herrington added, Big
Game gives the police a lot more
cause for concern than Ice-T does.
"Now if I could convince Cal and
Stanford to play all the Big Games
at Cal — I'd like that."

"I've been in this business more
than 30 years, and I've heard peo
ple I've considered a lot more
threatening.
"I may not be so happy with
what he has to say. .. but there are
a lot of people who, for one reason
or another, don't like the police."
Not all police officers share Her
rington's outlook, however. Police
groups across the country have
called for a boycott of "Cop Killer."
While most of the furor has
come from East Coast cities, the

debate moved west this month
when the sheriffs department in
Pocatello, Idaho, refused to pro
vide security for a speech sched
uled on the Idaho State campus.
According to Kris Herup, a
senior at Idaho State who works
with the school's Student Pro
gram Board, the sheriffs office
refused to provide security
because they objected to "Cop
Killer" and because they antici
pated that the event — a speech
focusing on inner-city life and
First Amendment issues — would
incite violence.
To Herup, their refusal was
reprehensible. "I think they were
being very closed-minded; they
weren't looking at the whole pic
ture," she said.
Pocatello sheriffs office repre
sentatives could not be reached

for comment.
Objections to Ice-T's Idaho
State visit weren't limited to the
police, Herup said. The program
board received many angry calls
from community members who
wanted them to cancel the speech.
"All they knew was that he
wrote the song," she said. "Most
of them had never even heard it;
they just knew he wrote it."
Informed or not, the debate on
campus was fairly heated. "It was
pretty divided," Herup said.
"There weren't a whole lot of peo
ple who didn't care."
At Stanford, however, the
scene is considerably quieter.
Sanchez said she has only
received positive phone calls —
although she has heard rumors
that some people object — and
has "no expectation of violence."

Similar speeches have come off
without a hitch at the University
of Florida at Gainesville and Ohio
University in the past month.
Stanford police said they also
don't anticipate violence — either
by protestors or excited fans — at
the speech. Extra security will be
provided, however, due to the large
crowds the event is likely to draw.
"We're not so concerned that
people will attack him (or police
officers)," Herrington said. "But
he's an entertainer, and people
will probably want to get near
him, get his autograph."
Police will help escort Ice-T to
and from Kresge, but most of their
energy will be focused outside the
building. Officers will be stationed
at all of the auditorium's exits to
prevent people without tickets
from entering. "We're likely to

have a large crowd that wants to
get in, and we just can't accommo
date them," Herrington said.
All in all, the police are
approaching Ice-T the same way
they'd deal with any other speak
er, Herrington said. "It's pretty
standard stuff."
In fact, Herrington added, Big
Game gives the police a lot more
cause for concern than Ice-T does.
"Now if I could convince Cal and
Stanford to play all the Big Games
at Cal — I'd like that."
Although police furor over Ice-T's song
"Cop Killer" has kept him from lecturing on
at least one college campus, the controver
sial singer is just another speaker to the
Stanford Police.
Ice-T's scheduled speech at Idaho State
University this month was canceled be
cause local police refused to provide securi
ty for the event, saying they didn't want to
endorse "Cop Killer."
But the idea of refusing security for Ice-
T's Saturday night speech hasn't even been
raised, said Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington.
"I wouldn't have been surprised if there
were some discussion about it (around the
station), but no one's even brought it up,"

Herrington said. "No one seems very con
cerned about Ice-T's politics."
And Roble resident assistant Nicole
Sanchez, who is organizing the speech, con
firmed that the police have been "nothing
but cooperative in this endeavor. I actually
thought (arranging security) would be a lot
more difficult than it was."
The speech, which will be given in Kres
ge Auditorium — not Cubberley, as origi
nally planned — will be called "A Conversa
tion with Ice-T," and will cover topics in
cluding his personal history and political
agenda, the validity of the criticism he re
ceives and First Amendment issues.
Although "Cop Killer" has raised the ire
of police officers nationwide since its release
in early 1992, Herrington believes it is "a
mistake" for them to confuse
their personal opinions with their
professional duty.
"(Ice-T] has as much right to
speak as I do or anyone else," Her
rington said. "He also has a right
to protection. That's how a free
society works — you protect every
one whether you disagree with
them or not. I've had to protect
Nazis and KKK members and a lot
of other people I find personally
offensive. But my personal feelings
or politics just aren't relevant.
"I don't ever want to see a time
in this country when the police
decide who gets protection and who
doesn't," Herrington continued.

"That might not make some of my
colleagues back East happy, but
that's how I feel."
And when it comes right down
to it, Herrington just doesn't feel
Ice-T or his music poses a serious
threat to the police force.
"I guess I just don't take him
that seriously," Herrington said.
"I've been in this business more
than 30 years, and I've heard peo
ple I've considered a lot more
threatening.
"I may not be so happy with
what he has to say. .. but there are
a lot of people who, for one reason
or another, don't like the police."
