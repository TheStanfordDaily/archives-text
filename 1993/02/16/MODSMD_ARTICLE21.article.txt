## California shellacks Cardinal hoops with 86-61 win 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
When Stanford and California
get together, there is never any
love lost between the two. Sunday
was no exception, as the Golden
Bears stole Cupid's arrow and
stabbed it right through Stan
ford's heart for a 86-61 slaying at
Maples Pavilion.
Cal (12-7,5-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) controlled the tempo from
the outset, and by extension, dom
inated the game. Freshman guard
Jason Kidd passed, forward Lam-

We got beat in every
phase of the game.
When that happens,
the score is going to
get ugly.
— Mike Montgomery

ond Murray scored and the Cardi
nal could only plead for mercy.
Kidd doled out the valentines in
career-high fashion in the form of
13 assists — 9 in the first half —
in a mere 20 minutes of play.
Meanwhile, Murray shot the
lights out with a 10-for-14 perfor
mance in only 18 minutes of play,
which was good for 22 points on
the day.
The Golden Bears shot a
remarkable 70.4 percent from the
field in the first half, a number that
dipped slightly to a 55.9 percentage
by game's end. No Cal starter
played more than 20 minutes.
In contrast, Stanford (6-16,1-9)
achieved a new season low in
shooting percentage with a 29.3
percent overall mark — the first
time that the Cardinal has shot
below 30 percent all year.
"We got beat in every phase of
the game," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "When that
happens, the score is going to get
ugly"
And that it did. The Cardinal
enjoyed its first and only lead at 5-
2 with 18:50 to play in the first
half. But Cal proceeded to reel off
11 straight points en route to a 18-
5 run from which Stanford was
unable to recover.
Cal employed an aggressive
defense that allowed it to have

many transition opportunities.
The Bears had another burst, this
time by a 16-6 margin, to close out
the first half with a 21 point lead.
The Bears began the second
half as if there had not been an
intermission, reeling off a 14-4
spurt over the opening six min
utes, thanks in large part to Kidd,
who showcased a variety of talents
to justify the preseason hype he
received.
On Cal's first four possessions
of the second period, Kidd scored a
layup and dished out three assists,
the last of which was most impres
sive as he threw a full-court
inbounds pass that was caught on
one bounce and viciously slammed
home by Murray. A few plays later,
Kidd stole a pass by Stanford
guard Marcus Lollie and raced
down the court for a fast break
dunk of his own before taking the
rest of the day off.
"Jason Kidd is a great player,
and when you have a great player
you let them take over," said Cal
interim coach Todd Bozeman.
"The ultimate complement for a
great player is to dominate a game
without scoring a point, and Jason
basically did that."
"We just got on a roll, and it's
like a car — you just can't stop it,"
Kidd said. "Everybody was
relaxed, and I just played my
game."
Dion Cross was the only offen
sive spark on the floor for Stan
ford, as he led the Cardinal in scor
ing for the third-straight game.
Cross shot 8-for-13 from the field,
including 3-of-5 three-pointers, to
score 20 points. Reserve guard
Kenny Hicks was the only other
Stanford player to score in double
figures with 10 points.
One play in particular was typi
cal of Stanford's fortunes on the
afternoon. With just under six
minutes remaining in the game,
Cross snared a defensive rebound
and quickly passed to Lollie, who
pushed the ball upcourt. Lollie
gave it back to Cross, who, nearing
the baseline, made a nice dish to
Brent Williams inside for a seem
ingly perfect play — only to have
Williams blow the layup.
Williams' miss was one of sever
al on the day for him personally —
he shot 2-for-9 on the afternoon —
and for the Cardinal collectively, as
Stanford's big men missed numer
ous easy shots inside throughout.
Jim Morgan, Bart Lammersen and
Darren Allaway shot a combined 1-

of-12 from short distance.
"We're playing a 94-foot game
and we're only playing 70-feet,"
Montgomery said. "We're not play
ing in the color. We have to be able

to play endline to endline, not top
of the key to top of the key. The
way Cal played and the way we
played there's no way that we can
compete in this league."
