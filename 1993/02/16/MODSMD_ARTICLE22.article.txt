# Cal guns for postseason, Stanford hopes to regroup
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Just 10 days ago, the men's
basketball teams at both Cali
fornia and Stanford were reeling
after being swept at Arizona and
Arizona State.
But, as Sunday's 86-61 romp
demonstrated, the Golden Bears
have managed to rebound from
the two tough losses while the
Cardinal is mired in a nine-game
losing streak.
With its loss, Stanford guar
anteed Mike Montgomery his
first losing season ever in 15
seasons as head coach.
California, meanwhile, fired
Lou Campanelli the day after
returning from Arizona, and 29-
year-old interim head coach
Todd Bozeman appears to have
added a spark of life to a talent
ed but erratic team.
"Our goal is the NCAA tour
nament, and with eight games
left that is the only thing we are
thinking about," Bozeman said.
"I think there's a distinct possi
bility that we can do it."
Two plays illustrated the
divergent directions each team
is taking.
Three minutes into the sec
ond half, California's superstar
freshman point guard Jason
Kidd stole the ball from Stan
ford freshman guard Dion
Cross, drove all the way down
the court and missed the layup,
only to have sophomore Lam
ond Murray grab the rebound
and dunk it home for a 57-30
lead.
Just four minutes later, Car
dinal senior guard Kenny Hicks
drove to the basket and missed a
short jumper. Sophomore for
ward Bart Lammerson emerged
with the offensive rebound, and,
rather than dunking it, he pro
ceeded to miss not one but two
uncontested one-foot shots
underneath the basket.
But £/ammesson whsn'f
only one to miss a layup against
the Golden Bears. In the second
half alone, the Cardinal missed
seven of eight layups.
"For the things we worked on
in practice, it was like we didn't

work on them at practice at all,"
Montgomery said. "Needless to
say, I'm concerned, and I wish I
had some answers.
"I think we can play better
because we are a better team
than we've shown," he added.
Montgomery has been saying
the same thing all season, as the
Cardinal has struggled to over
come injuries and poor play
among its big men.
"We have to develop an inside
game, or some semblance there
of," admitted freshman forward
Darren Allaway, the only bright
spot this season on Stanford's
front line.
"I've been watching it for two
months, and it is discouraging,"
Montgomery said. "I've tried to
get my best players on the floor
... and hopefully we will find a
combination that can win."
By contrast, California's
thorough domination of Stan
ford suggests that the changes
made by the Golden Bears —
including last week's controver
sial mid-season coaching switch
— have paid off.
"With starting over, every
body has cleared their minds
and we have decided to give it all
we can," Kidd said. "We're
putting everything together."
Bozeman — who remains
undefeated after his first two
games ever as a head coach —
said he is "proud of our guys
because of the situation they
were under" and said he hopes
they can "block out the stress"
and focus on making the NCAA
tournament.
Wins in six of their last eight
games (making them 18-9)
would probably be enough to
put them in the 64-team field.
"California conceivably could
jump back in the thick of
things," Montgomery said. "I
still think there is a distinct pos
sibility California could make a
real run at things."

goal is not quite so big, but it
could be just as tough to achieve
