# Women's basketball comes up short on Cal turf, 64-59
## Frustrated by zone defense, Stanford lets game slip away 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
For the fourth time this season, the Stan
ford women's basketball squad learned the
hard way that opponents — and their fans —
refuse to be hospitable when you're playing on
the road.
The Cardinal (17-5, 8-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) were treated rather poorly Friday night
at Harmon Gym in Berkeley, falling to the
Golden Bears, 64-59, before a record arena
crowd of 3,596. The loss drops Stanford to sec
ond place in the Pac-10, behind USC, and
gives the Cardinal its fourth road defeat of the
year.
With four minutes remaining in the con
test, the Stanford team held a five-point
advantage at 56-51 and seemed well on its way
to its third-straight conference victory. It was
all downhill from that point, however, as Cali
fornia (14-5, 6-4) fought back to take over the
lead while the Cardinal shooters turned ice
cold.
The Bears tied the game on an Ingrid Dix
son three-point play at 2 minutes, 51 seconds
and took the lead for good only 30 seconds
later on another Dixson basket.

At the other end of the court, the Stanford
offense deteriorated. The Cardinal failed on
numerous opportunities to narrow the deficit,
as its players missed free throws and other
makeable shots.
Still, Stanford had a chance to tie the score
at the end of the game, trailing by just three
points with 21 ticks remaining on the clock.
The Cardinal was unable to free any of its
players for an uncontested three-point
attempt and, as a result, Christy Hedgpeth
was forced to fire a long-range off-balance shot
which bounced off the front of the rim.
Stanford discovered early on in the contest
that Cal would not let up in intensity after los
ing to the Cardinal by 26 points four weeks
before. Stanford pulled out to leads of seven
and eight points at different points in the first
half, but it failed to extend its advantage any
further.
"Stanford played the best game they played
all year in that first game," said Bears coach
Gooch Foster. "We just decided we were going
to come out and play hard."
Cal played especially hard on defense, forc
ing 21 Cardinal turnovers and stealing the ball
12 times. Its zone defense flustered most of
the Stanford shooters for the entire game, as

the team converted only 39 percent of its
shots.
"They worked that (zonel really well," said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. "They were
very aggressive in it. We turned it (the ball)
over against it."
The Bears' pressure defense also served to
keep Stanford Ail-American Val Whiting in
check. Though Whiting scored 21 points, Cal
prevented her from taking over the game, as
she had done in the previous contest against
the Bears.
"One player cannot guard Val Whiting,"
Foster said. "The zone saved us."
Although the defeat gives the Cardinal its
second loss in four games, VanDerveer is not
worried about its chances for winning another
national championship.
"We're definitely not in sync," she said.
"But we weren't at this time last year."
Maybe all the Cardinal needs is an increase
in intensity to get things going right again.
"I hope [this lossl loosens people up and
gets them mad and gets them hungry," Van-
Derveer said.
Or maybe all it needs is to be back at Maples
Pavilion playing in front of a boisterous Stan
ford crowd.
