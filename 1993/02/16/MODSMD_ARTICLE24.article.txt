# Cardinal loses advantage down the stretch
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Like a boxer who can't deliver a knockout
blow, Stanford has been struggling to finish
off its opponents of late.
In three of its last four games — a loss at
Washington, a win at home over Arizona State
and Friday night's defeat at California — the
Cardinal has built significant leads only to
fade at the end of the game.
In Berkeley, Stanford squandered three
separate leads of five or more points, and the
opposition once again controlled the game's
final minutes.
As a result, the Cardinal found itself in
the increasingly familiar role of playing
catch-up.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer called
Christy Hedgpeth's desperation attempt at a
game-tying three-pointer "a 'Horse' shot,"
alluding to the game in which players try to
make often-creative baskets that are too diffi
cult for their opponents to duplicate.
But Hedgpeth's bomb wasn't the only

symptom of the Cardinal's late-game dysfunc
tion, just the last and most dramatic.
Cal's Milica Vukadinovic and Kim Robin
son both missed the front ends of one-and
ones in the final minute, giving Stanford three
consecutive possessions in which to cut into
the Golden Bears' three-point lead. Stanford
blew all three opportunities.
"Down the stretch, people were tight,"
VanDerveer said of her players after the game.
"They put a lot of pressure on themselves."
Some of that pressure also came from the
Cal players. The Bears' defense gave Stanford
fits, much like Arizona State's press did a
week ago Sunday.
In the final 2 minutes, 40 seconds of that
game, the Sun Devils' tenacious defense nar
rowed a 17-point deficit to only three.
However, Stanford did cling to victory
against Arizona State, something it was not
able to do the previous weekend at Washing
ton, when the Cardinal failed to vanquish the
Huskies, despite a nine-point halftime advan
tage.
Stanford's offense, trying to come from

behind, was no match for Washington's
defense in the closing moments of the game.
Trailing by three, the Cardinal had the ball,
but didn't manage to get off a shot in the final
eight seconds — in retrospect, an ominous
preview of the end of Friday's game.
At its best, the Cardinal has been the con
summate finisher. With players in great phys
ical shape, recent Stanford teams have worn
down their opponents, frequently pulling
away in the second half.
The first Cal game this year, as well as the
games against Washington State and Oregon,
followed that pattern. But such performances
haven't been the rule.
Cal coach Gooch Foster suggested that in
the first meeting between the cross-bay rivals,
"Stanford played the best game they have all
year." Playing at home, the Cardinal used a
punishing 55-point second-half attack to win
that game, going away, 89-63.
Stanford put together similar second-peri
od surges against Oregon (57 points) and
Washington State (47).
But with two losses in its last
four games, the Cardinal now
faces the possibility of losing the
Pacific 10 Conference title, as

well as a favorable seeding in the
NCAA tournament in March.
"I look at it like we're
healthy, we're playing close
games," VanDerveer said Fri
day. "We can't have a pity party
for ourselves."
Being tested in close games
should help the Cardinal — but
only if it finds a way to win them.
