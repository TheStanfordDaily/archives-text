# Volleyball crushes USC, Long Beach with aggressive play
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Like the stubble on their recently
shaven heads, the members of the Stan
ford men's volleyball team have begun
to re-establish themselves on top of the
collegiate volleyball world.
That process continued this week
end, as the Cardinal destroyed 10th
ranked USC 15-7, 15-8, 15-2 on Satur
day, then blew by seventh-ranked Long
Beach State 15-12, 11-15, 15-7, 15-4 on
Sunday.
The initial shot in the USC match
was a Canyon Ceman ace, which set the
tone for an aggressive Cardinal win and
a tentative Trojan loss. After an initial
5-5 tie, John Hribar's wall-like net play
and Ceman's pinpoint setting set the
Cardinal on a 10-2 run that ended in a
Bob Hillman game-winning kill.
USC's head volleyball coach Jim
McLaughlin started sophomore Jason
Mullholland in the second game to try
and change the course of the match.
Mullholland, the Trojan's leading spik
er, sat out the first game after missing a
week of practice due to injury. But his
presence did little tangible good as he
was quickly blocked by Hribar, and
Southern Cal lost 15-8. For the two
games he played, Mullholland hit an
anemic .130, with 9 kills in 23 attempts.
"Mullholland was injured, and it was
a bad decision to play him," McLaughlin
said. "He hasn't played in a couple of
weeks, so he is obviously rough."
The third game started with a flurry
of side outs by both teams, punctuated
by piston-like spikes by Stanford's Ryan
Moos and USC's Russell Brock, who led

the Trojans with 10 kills. After racing to
a 7-1 lead, Southern Cal doubled their
score with a Jason Perkins kill. The Car
dinal responded with two Ceman aces
and a Hribar block to triumph, 15-2.
"All I want to see is us be aggres
sive," McLaughlin said. "That's what I
asked the team. 'Why weren't you more
aggressive?' Hopefully, we'll get some
answers."
The Cardinal had plenty of individu
al highlights. Hribar had 10 blocks,
Goss had 28 kills and Moos hit .647, as
the team hit an astounding .541.
Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves
emphasized Stanford's aggressive serv
ing. "We missed a lot of serves," he said.
"But that's because we're serving
tough. I'll take 21 missed serves for 12
aces."
Against Long Beach State, the Cardi
nal continued to serve well, with 8 aces
and 15 errors. But the highlight of the
match was senior Dave Goss' all-around
play. He led the team with 42 kills and
11 digs, and was among the team lead
ers with 6 blocks and 2 aces. Overall, he
stole the spotlight from 49er Olympian
Brent Hilliard, who had 29 kills while
hitting .262.
"I have really been playing under the
shadow of Brent Hilliard my whole
career," said Goss. "I just wanted to go
out and show I could play with the guy."
"Dave's a great player," Hilliard said.
"When we play against Stanford, we
know Dave's their main guy. You don't
block him too often because he hits a
very high ball."
Long Beach State raced out to a 11-6
lead in the first game, and the Cardinal
looked confused as several diggable

balls fell untouched. But Hillman's
cross-court kills sparked a 9-1 Stanford
run that ended on a Goss spike for the
win.
"Because I'm smaller than the aver
age outside hitter, I've learned how to
hit a high, hard ball and really go for the
corners," Hillman said. "If I tried to
stick it right down every time I'd get
blocked. By trying to go for the deep
corners I get touches off the blocks, and
they got out deep."
In the second game, Stanford
couldn't hold on to a 2-0 start as Karl
Van Reusen's effective spiking staked
the 49ers to a 13-6 lead. Stanford tried
to clamor back, but fell short as Goss
spiked wide, 15-11.
The third game was highlighted by
the ambidextrous display of a Ceman
left-handed spike. The score was Stan
ford, 6-5, when Goss brought the crowd
to its feet and shifted the momentum
irreversibly on a play where he spiked,
dug, then finally blocked a Hilliard
spike to side out. Behind this type of
performance by Goss, with some Moos
aces and Bezmalinovic blocks, the Car
dinal took the third game, then cruised
through the fourth, 15-7, 15-4.
Long Beach State head coach Ray
Ratelle attributed his team's collapse in
the third and fourth games to inexperi
ence. "Three of my six players have
never been out there before," he said.
"We were real inconsistent, which is
fairly typical of a young team."
On the Stanford side of the court
there were several notable individual
performances besides Goss': Moos hit
.478, Bezmalinovic led the team with 10
blocks and Ceman had 69 assists.

age outside hitter, I've learned how to
hit a high, hard ball and really go for the
corners," Hillman said. "If I tried to
stick it right down every time I'd get
blocked. By trying to go for the deep
corners I get touches off the blocks, and
they got out deep."
In the second game, Stanford
couldn't hold on to a 2-0 start as Karl
Van Reusen's effective spiking staked
the 49ers to a 13-6 lead. Stanford tried
to clamor back, but fell short as Goss
spiked wide, 15-11.
The third game was highlighted by
the ambidextrous display of a Ceman
left-handed spike. The score was Stan
ford, 6-5, when Goss brought the crowd
to its feet and shifted the momentum
irreversibly on a play where he spiked,
dug, then finally blocked a Hilliard
spike to side out. Behind this type of
performance by Goss, with some Moos
aces and Bezmalinovic blocks, the Car
dinal took the third game, then cruised
through the fourth, 15-7, 15-4.
Long Beach State head coach Ray
Ratelle attributed his team's collapse in
the third and fourth games to inexperi
ence. "Three of my six players have
never been out there before," he said.
"We were real inconsistent, which is
fairly typical of a young team."
On the Stanford side of the court
there were several notable individual
performances besides Goss': Moos hit
.478, Bezmalinovic led the team with 10
blocks and Ceman had 69 assists.

Outside hitter Bob Hillman sealed Stanford's first game against USC with a convincing
kill, and continued his well-placed spikes against Long Beach State.
Like the stubble on their recently
shaven heads, the members of the Stan
ford men's volleyball team have begun
to re-establish themselves on top of the
collegiate volleyball world.
That process continued this week
end, as the Cardinal destroyed 10th
ranked USC 15-7, 15-8, 15-2 on Satur
day, then blew by seventh-ranked Long
Beach State 15-12, 11-15, 15-7, 15-4 on
Sunday.
The initial shot in the USC match
was a Canyon Ceman ace, which set the
tone for an aggressive Cardinal win and
a tentative Trojan loss. After an initial
5-5 tie, John Hribar's wall-like net play
and Ceman's pinpoint setting set the
Cardinal on a 10-2 run that ended in a
Bob Hillman game-winning kill.
USC's head volleyball coach Jim
McLaughlin started sophomore Jason
Mullholland in the second game to try
and change the course of the match.
Mullholland, the Trojan's leading spik
er, sat out the first game after missing a
week of practice due to injury. But his
presence did little tangible good as he
was quickly blocked by Hribar, and
Southern Cal lost 15-8. For the two
games he played, Mullholland hit an
anemic .130, with 9 kills in 23 attempts.
"Mullholland was injured, and it was
a bad decision to play him," McLaughlin
said. "He hasn't played in a couple of
weeks, so he is obviously rough."
The third game started with a flurry
of side outs by both teams, punctuated
by piston-like spikes by Stanford's Ryan
Moos and USC's Russell Brock, who led

the Trojans with 10 kills. After racing to
a 7-1 lead, Southern Cal doubled their
score with a Jason Perkins kill. The Car
dinal responded with two Ceman aces
and a Hribar block to triumph, 15-2.
"All I want to see is us be aggres
sive," McLaughlin said. "That's what I
asked the team. 'Why weren't you more
aggressive?' Hopefully, we'll get some
answers."
The Cardinal had plenty of individu
al highlights. Hribar had 10 blocks,
Goss had 28 kills and Moos hit .647, as
the team hit an astounding .541.
Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves
emphasized Stanford's aggressive serv
ing. "We missed a lot of serves," he said.
"But that's because we're serving
tough. I'll take 21 missed serves for 12
aces."
Against Long Beach State, the Cardi
nal continued to serve well, with 8 aces
and 15 errors. But the highlight of the
match was senior Dave Goss' all-around
play. He led the team with 42 kills and
11 digs, and was among the team lead
ers with 6 blocks and 2 aces. Overall, he
stole the spotlight from 49er Olympian
Brent Hilliard, who had 29 kills while
hitting .262.
"I have really been playing under the
shadow of Brent Hilliard my whole
career," said Goss. "I just wanted to go
out and show I could play with the guy."
"Dave's a great player," Hilliard said.
"When we play against Stanford, we
know Dave's their main guy. You don't
block him too often because he hits a
very high ball."
Long Beach State raced out to a 11-6
lead in the first game, and the Cardinal
looked confused as several diggable

balls fell untouched. But Hillman's
cross-court kills sparked a 9-1 Stanford
run that ended on a Goss spike for the
win.
"Because I'm smaller than the aver
age outside hitter, I've learned how to
hit a high, hard ball and really go for the
corners," Hillman said. "If I tried to
stick it right down every time I'd get
blocked. By trying to go for the deep
corners I get touches off the blocks, and
they got out deep."
