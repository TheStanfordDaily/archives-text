# Baseball sweeps past Fresno State, spoils Bulldogs' undefeated record
##

"I really couldn't tell you how good
Stanford fe," said embittered Fresno
State coach Bob Bennett. "Obviously,
they were good enough to kick our
butts."
The Cardinal, 7-2 on the year, domi
nated and demoralized the previously
undefeated Bulldogs, sweeping the three
game weekend series, 7-6, 4-1 and 12-1.
"This was definitely a big sweep for
us," said Stanford first baseman Dusty
Allen. "With the exception of our defense
the first day, we were solid all around."
In the opening game of the series, the
Cardinal fell behind 5-1 thanks to a pair
of fourth-inning errors and a handful of
singles.
Stanford, however, chipped away at
the lead. Triples by Jed Hansen and
Brodie VanWagenen brought the score to
5-4.
After Fresno State put a run on the
board in the sixth, a Todd Laßocca dou
ble and Hansen sacrifice fly tied the game
at six.
Cale Carter walked to lead off the Car
dinal ninth. Carter's presence on the
basepaths is quickly becoming common
place — the freshman has hit safely in all
nine games while compiling a .463 on
base percentage.
"Cale has contributed as much as any
body," said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "I feel like every time I turn
around, he's getting on base."
With one out and Carter on third,
Allen lofted a fly down the right field line.
Bulldog right fielder Bryan Judice made

the catch and threw a perfect one-hopper
to All-America catcher Todd Johnson.
Johnson misjudged the hop, however,
and the ball eluded him as Carter scored
the winning run.
Cardinal hurler Andrew Lorraine set
tled down after a rocky start, scattering
11 hits over nine innings. The left-han
der notched the second win of the season
and the first complete game of his Stan
ford career.
"Lorraine looks like he's going to be a
good competitive guy," said Bennett.
"He's a good guy to have behind (Willie)
Adams."
Adams, out with the flu on Saturday,
looked untouchable in the second game
of the series. The righty gave up just
three singles and a second-inning Gary
McNamara home run in going the dis
tance.
"I'm convinced he can beat anybody in
the country," Bennett said.
Bulldog starter Steve Soderstrom was
almost as impressive, allowing only one
Cardinal to reach base after the third
inning.
But by then, it was too late. With
Carter and Jed Hansen aboard in the
first inning, Allen doubled to left, picking
up his first extra-base hit of the season.
The sophomore seemed to break out of
an early-season slump this weekend.
Allen picked up five hits and drove in
seven runs against Fresno State in rais
ing his batting average 80 points to .265.
"I feel a lot better right now," said
Allen. "But it couldn't have gotten much
worse than it did."
Stanford completed the sweep yester
day with a convincing 12-1 win. Frosh

starter Dan Reed did not allow an earned
run in his seven innings, running his sea
son-long scoreless innings streak to 15.
"I felt good out there today," Reed
said. "But I was helped out a lot by the
team."
After mustering only four hits against
Soderstrom, the Cardinal laced five base
hits in the first two innings alone of yes
terday's game.
But it was Jason Sugarman's two-out,
two-run home run in the third which
began the rout.
Sugarman, starting at catcher for A.J.
Hinch, lined an 0-2 pitch well over the
fence in left-center field, staking Stan
ford a 5-1 lead.
"Sugarman's hit was the big lift for us
today," said Marquess. "But we're begin
ning to get the big hits, and that's a good
_• M
Bign.
Allen agreed. "We've been hitting in
big spots, and that's the key to winning
any game."
Stanford hosts Cal State-Los Angeles
in non-conference competition today at 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. Freshman
Todd Bartels (0-0, 5.63 ERA) will start
for the Cardinal.
