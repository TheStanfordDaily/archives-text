After weathering a slew of injuries
that put an end to its bid for a seventh
straight NCAA title, this year looked like
it might be more of the same for members
of the Stanford women's tennis team.
Now, however, they're feeling much
better.
The Cardinal rose to the occasion last
weekend, sweeping both No. 9 Pepper
dine and No. 15 San Diego State.
Before the matches, Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan said the Cardinal
couldn't expect to go 9-0 against the likes
of the Waves and the Aztecs. But the
team proved him wrong by breezing
through the competition without drop
ping a set.
Stanford opened with Pepperdine on
Friday. No. 1 Laxmi Poruri, a junior, eas
ily handled the Waves' Kirsten Smith, 6-
2, 6-4, while No. 2 Heather Willens, a
senior, defeated Nina Eriksson, 6-3, 6-1.
Redshirt-freshman Kim Shasby beat
Pepperdine's Sonya Olejar in the No. 3 slot
and junior Kris tine Kurth, who is recover
ing from a lung infection, posted a 6-2, 6-4
victory over Natasha Pospich at No. 4.
Freshman Beth Berris beat Tomoko
Tsurutani in the No. 5 spot and sopho
more Amy Chiminello rounded out the
sweep in the No. 6 position, downing the
Waves' Pam Wallenfels, 6-1, 6-0.
In doubles action, the No. 1 tandem of
Poruri and Willens handed Pepperdine's
Eriksson and Olejar a 6-1, 6-1 drubbing,
while Shasby and Chiminello won the
No. 2 match, 6-1, 6-2, against Pospich
and Smith. Stanford's Berris and junior
Emma Woodhouse scored the third dou
bles victory against Tsurutani and Wal

lenfalls at No. 3, 6-2, 7-6.
On Saturday, the Cardinal picked up
where it left off, steamrolling San Diego
State. Once again, Poruri led the Stan
ford charge. She defeated the Aztecs'
Nicole Storto, 6-3, 6-1. Willens made
short work of her opponent as well, beat
ing Susheel Gulati, 6-0, 6-4.
Shasby cruised by Tanya Lauer, 6-1,6-
3, while Kurth slammed the door on Paige
Hammond, 6-4,6-1, in the No. 4 slot.
For Kurth, returning to action after
the infection took more mental, rather
than physical, stamina.
"It's hard coming out and playing
well the whole time," she said. "You'll
slip up once, and they'll get a couple of
points, and all of a sudden you're losing."
Kurth noted, however, that her ill
ness did not affect her play that much.
"In the first match I could feel it," she
said. "But after that, I got back into it
and played well."
It was Berris who had one of the clos
est contests of the weekend, when she
had to come from behind in the second
set of the No. 5 match. She breezed
through the first set against Shawn
Egan, 6-1, but needed a three-game
spurt to nail down the second set, 7-5.
Chiminello wrapped up the singles
competition with a 6-4, 7-6, win over
Christy Propstra in the No. 6 match.
Chiminello fought off two set points in
the second set, coming back to take the
match in a 7-2 tiebreaker.
Chiminello's duel was the closest the
Cardinal has come to losing a set since
the beginning of the season. Stanford
has lost only one set all year.
The Cardinal will return to action today
at 1:30 p.m. when it hosts Nevada-Las
Vegas at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
