# Men's and women's gymnastics avenge early season losses
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
Sure, one should love thine enemies, but
a little revenge between friends never hurt
anybody.
After losing big to Cal State-Fullerton
last month, the No. 19 Stanford women's
gymnastics team (4-2 overall) beat the No.
11 Titans (3-3) Friday night in Burnham
Pavilion, 189.3 - 187.6.
The victory was even sweeter as the Car
dinal has several personal connections to
the Titan program. Sophomore transfer
Jenny Ward competed for Fullerton last
year, head coach Breck Greenwood was an
assistant coach at Fullerton for eight years
and Greenwood's wife, Karilyn, is a former
Titan gymnast.
The Cardinal was led by Hillary Ander
son's record-breaking beam performance.
The freshman set a new all-time Stanford
mark with a 9.85 on the apparatus, part of
a team-high 38.25 all-around score. After
only five meets as a Cardinal, Anderson
already holds two Stanford records. Her
9.90 on bars earlier this year tied a mark
set by teammate Jen 6 Elzie.
Anderson started slowly with subpar
marks on vault and bars, but followed her
beam performance with a season-best 9.80
on her floor exercise.
"I was very upset about vault and bars,"
Anderson said. "It was nice to end on a
good note."
The freshman's beam routine was part
of a 47.85 team performance in the event,
by far Stanford's best of the year. Although
beam was supposed to be a strong event for
the Cardinal this year, the squad had
struggled. According to Greenwood, the
Cardinal just executed better on Friday.
"We don't make many changes on beam
(during the year)," Greenwood said. "If
anything, we did less on beam this week.
We were just more confident, and it showed

up tonight."
The Cardinal followed its beam perfor
mance with yet another outstanding show
ing on floor.
Floor is traditionally a strong event for
the Cardinal, and the team showed why on
Friday, as all six Cardinal competitors
scored at least a 9.50 for a team total of
48.20. Greenwood said that four of the ath
letes did new floor routines and that the
added difficulty helped bolster the squad's
mark.
Stanford needed the high scores on
floor, as it continued to have troubles on
vault, the team's Achilles' heel all season.
Greenwood said the team's score of 45.85
was about a point-and-a-half below what he
expected.
"We vaulted so much better in practice,"
he said. He was quick to add that he was
pleasantly surprised by the vaults of sopho
mores Meegan Lannin and Ward, both of
whom had season-high marks.
"Fullerton is the school I went to last
year, and so I had something to prove,"
Ward said.
The reunion of old friends was ruined
for Fullerton when star freshman Brandi
Baldasano suffered a spiral fracture in a
bone in her wrist during her bars routine.
According to Fullerton assistant coach
Julie Garcia, losing the team's No. 2 all
arounder was a big blow both to the team's
morale and score. Because of the injury,
the Titans had only five competitors in the
last three events, so every score counted.
The Titans' injury problems didn't
damper the win for the Cardinal, however.
Greenwood said that beating a top team
like Fullerton was always satisfying.
"We were a lot more aggressive tonight,
and we need that to be successful," he said.
Next weekend, they will be in the Pacif
ic Northwest for two dual meets, against
Washington on Friday and Seattle Pacific
University on Saturday.
