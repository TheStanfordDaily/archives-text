## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
After two early-season defeats
to California, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team took its revenge
Friday night, outscoring both the
Bears and the San Jose State
Spartans 279.20 - 277.65 -
249.65, respectively, at San Jose
State.
Getting off to what coach
Sadao Hamada described as a
slow start, the Cardinal pulled
together in the second half of the
meet, displaying the strength and
poise which earned it the title of
1992 national champion.
Since Stanford scored just 10
points higher to win NCAAs last
year, "Coming up with a 279 at
this time in the season is excel
lent," Hamada said. "It was a
very exciting competition because
we were behind Cal until the last
event."
As the Stanford gymnasts
made their final rotation to the
parallel bars, the pressure was on
to defeat their arch-rivals once
and for all. "We had been trailing
Cal throughout the competition
and the guys all knew they had to
hit their routines," Hamada said.
Led by senior Jair Lynch with
9.80, sophomore Jing-Wei Liang
with 9.70 and senior Jeff Bender
with 9.65, the Cardinal came
through to secure the meet victo
ry with all six parallel bar rou
tines scoring above a 9.00 for a
total of 48.15 on the event.
Experiencing the pressure of

an intense meet situation for the
first time this season, Hamada
reflected, "They sure felt it â€” this
is how they have to perform in all
the events during the second half
of the season."
Junior Mark Booth added,
"I'm glad the team pulled togeth
er in the end. Hopefully this meet
will act as a springboard and give
us some confidence for the last
part of the season."
Propelling Stanford towards a
victory, Booth won the all-around
with 56.45 and also finished in
the top spot on the high bar, sec
ond on both the pommel horse
and the vault and third on the
floor.
Bender led the Cardinal on the
rings with a score of 9.65 followed
by Liang and junior Jason Cohen.
Other meet highlights included
senior Shawn Adamek's third
place pommel horse performance
and Cohen's first place vault
which earned a 9.30.
In order to cinch the win in
Friday's high pressure meet, the
team had to make an extra effort
to pull together in support of one
another.
"Before this meet we had been
competing separately," Adamek
said. "It was good to have every
one function as a team and it def
initely showed in our perfor
mance. Now all we have to do is
keep up the same intensity."
This weekend's meet marked
the beginning of the second half
