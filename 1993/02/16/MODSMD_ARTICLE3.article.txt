# Family-leave friendly
## Stanford generally in line with new act 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
While many businesses across the nation
are scrambling to comply with the "Family
and Medical Leave" act signed by President
Bill Clinton Feb. 5, Stanford employees can
revel in the fact that the University already
offers up to four months of disability leave
for pregnancy and childbirth and up to six
months for infant child care.
But over the next six months, before the
landmark legislation takes effect, Universi

that may contradict the new law.

need to continue health insurance coverage

during their employees' leave and give em

leave provisions the highest-paid 10 percent
of their workers as "essential employees."

Family Rights Act of 1991, which took effect
in January 1992, requires any company
with more than 50 employees to grant them
up to 16 weeks of unpaid leave within a two
year period and to provide them with the
same or a comparable job upon their return.
"We just got a copy of the federal law,"
said Tom Matteoli, director of employee re

as the state law, (to determine) which is
richer than the other."
The federal act allows eight more weeks
of leave in a two-year period than the state
law. And unlike the federal act — which
takes effect in early August — California
