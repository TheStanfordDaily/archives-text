# Family-leave friendly
## Stanford generally in line with new act 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
While many businesses across the nation
are scrambling to comply with the "Family
and Medical Leave" act signed by President
Bill Clinton Feb. 5, Stanford employees can
revel in the fact that the University already
offers up to four months of disability leave
for pregnancy and childbirth and up to six
months for infant child care.
But over the next six months, before the
landmark legislation takes effect, Universi
ty administrators will have to take a close
look at ways to modify the policy in areas
that may contradict the new law.
The act provides about 40 percent of the
nation's workforce with up to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave annually. The time off can be
used to deal with birth, adoption, personal
sickness or the serious illness of an immedi
ate family member.
Businesses with 50 or more workers will
need to continue health insurance coverage

during their employees' leave and give em
ployees their old jobs when they return. Em
ployers are allowed to exclude from the bill's
leave provisions the highest-paid 10 percent
of their workers as "essential employees."
California is one of eleven states that al
ready have family leave laws. The California
Family Rights Act of 1991, which took effect
in January 1992, requires any company
with more than 50 employees to grant them
up to 16 weeks of unpaid leave within a two
year period and to provide them with the
same or a comparable job upon their return.
"We just got a copy of the federal law,"
said Tom Matteoli, director of employee re
lations. "We're taking a look at that, as well
as the state law, (to determine) which is
richer than the other."
The federal act allows eight more weeks
of leave in a two-year period than the state
law. And unlike the federal act — which
takes effect in early August — California
does not mandate continuation of
health benefits and does not give
workers the right to take off for
their own illnesses.
Where the federal legislation is
more <J enerouß * n benefits to
workers, it will take precedence.
Matteoli said Stanford's cur
rent policy is a sound one. "It pro
vides benefits to the individual
employee as well as helping the
University to plan accordingly
when employees request sick
leave," he said.
"We want to make sure we're
providing the benefit these laws
intended. We've started that pro
cess. I don't anticipate it taking
an inordinate amount of time."
Matteoli said his office hopes
changes can be made and incorpo
rated before the beginning of
August.
Time out for a baby
The University's current policy
of combining paid sick leave and
unpaid leave already offers much
of what the federal policy man
dates. Employees build up eight
hours of paid sick leave for every
calendar month of full-time pay.
They are allowed to use the leave
whenever illness or injury pre
vents them from working or if the

illness or injury of an immediate
family member requires the
employees' absence.
Although employees can carry
over sick leave indefinitely, cur
rently they can use no more than
15 days of sick leave during a
work year.
According to the University's
administrative guide, regular
employees are assured of the use
of accumulated sick leave and dis
ability leave without pay during
periods of "verified disability"
caused by pregnancy, childbirth
and recovery. The total period of
absence with and without pay
may be as long as four months.
When the employee is preg
nant — but not disabled — a
department may also grant per
sonal leave without pay. The
guide further stipulates that a
regular employee may be granted
"up to six months' leave without
pay for the purpose of infant care
following pregnancy or adoption
of a new infant in the family."
Both decisions, however, are "at
the department's discretion."
The infant care policy applies
to both men and women. But
asked if the policy allows a father
or partner to take off work while
the mother is going through preg
nancy and childbirth, Matteoli
said, "I'm not sure if the policy is
addressing that question specifi
cally . . . but if an employee
requests personal time off, and

there are extenuating circum
stances, and there's a real reason
the father needs to be present,
that's something we need to con
sider."
Usually the employee's imme
diate supervisor makes the deci
sion. "If there are issues sur
rounding approval, disapproval or
modification and the employee
and supervisor cannot reach a
mutual agreement," Matteoli
said, "a department head may be
involved." Employees may also
seek aid from employee relations,
he said.
While a parent could technical
ly request four months of tempo
rary disability leave and six
months of infant child care for a
total 10 months of leave, Matteoli
said the department would have
to take a close look at the request
to find out what "compelling" rea
sons the employee has for such an
extended leave and how much
they are needed in their depart
ment.
Matteoli said his interpreta
tion of the federal act is that the
non-disabled pregnancy and
infant care leave "is not manda
tory"; employees are "entitled"
to request the leave. "Other
dynamics go into it,"he said,
including information from the
mother's doctor and the opera
tional needs of the employee's
work group.
Matteoli said the University

has no intention of reducing the
four months allowed for verified
disability during pregnancy.
Employees with jdisabling ill
nesses can apply for long-term
disability support. But those with
non-disabling illnesses — such as
the flu — create a "fuzzy" situa
tion, Matteoli said. He noted that
the University will have to give
some thought to whether the new
law would require Stanford to
grant unpaid leave to such
employees.
Insurance and other policies
The federal act will require
employers to keep providing
healthy care benegits during the
leavec as though the worker
were still employed. Stanford,
which offers several medical
plan choices, continues paying
its portion of health premiums
only when the employee takes a
paid leave.
"When a person goes on short
term leave of absence — on short
term disability — if they have sick
and vacation time, they can do a
'buyback': The University contin
ues to give its full contribution.
All benefits continue to accrue,"
said Agnes Miller of the Benefits
Department.
During long-term disability, the
University pays its normal
amount. However, if the employee
is on leave but off the payroll, he or
she has to pay the entire amount of

the group rate premium.
Matteoli said that if Stanford
needs to adjust its insurance prac
tices to bring them in line with
federal rules, "then that's part of
the responsibility."
The federal act outlines a host
of other requirements. It allows
employers to exclude from the
bill's leave provisions the highest
paid 10 percent of their workers
as essential employees. But
according to Matteoli, these
employees are not excluded under
Stanford's current policy, "and
we have no intention to exclude
them under any revision."
The act also allows the exemp
tion of many part-timers and
workers who have been at a com
pany less than a year. While the
University defines a regular
employee as someone who has
worked for at least six months,
Matteoli said Stanford will consid
er granting the federal leave only
to workers who have been here at
least a year.
Under the new act, employees
cannot receive unemployment
insurance while they are on leave.
Matteoli said he did not know of
any such prohibition at Stanford,
noting that "anyone can go down
and file for unemployment." If
the University received a claim,
though, the employee would have
to show a convincing cause for
unemployment compensation.
While the federal act doesn't

mandate the specific inclusion of
domestic partners, Matteoli said
the University will include them
in the leave policy. "I don't think
we would treat anyone any dif
ferently," he said. "It would be
the same thing as a married cou
ple."
Union workers also covered !
Members of the United Stan
ford Workers union, which
includes many maintenance
employees and staff members,
are covered under similar policies
in their contract with the Uni
versity. A female worker can
receive leave when she is "inca
pable of performing her job effec
tively because of disability due to
normal pregnancy, delivery or
post-childbirth recovery." The
leave extends until she can work
again but not later than the sixth
week following the date of deliv
ery.
In addition, USW workers of
both sexes can take a month of
unpaid infant care leave. More
time may be approved by the Uni
versity.
Although the USW contract
will not be renegotiated until Aug.
31, 1994, Matteoli said union
workers will be able to benefit
from the new law in the interim.
"When the normal opening period
for the contract comes up, then
we'll make those changes," he
said.
While many businesses across the nation
are scrambling to comply with the "Family
and Medical Leave" act signed by President
Bill Clinton Feb. 5, Stanford employees can

Usually the employee's imme
diate supervisor makes the deci
sion. "If there are issues sur
rounding approval, disapproval or
modification and the employee
and supervisor cannot reach a
mutual agreement," Matteoli
said, "a department head may be
involved." Employees may also
seek aid from employee relations,
he said.
While a parent could technical
ly request four months of tempo
rary disability leave and six
months of infant child care for a
total 10 months of leave, Matteoli
said the department would have
to take a close look at the request
to find out what "compelling" rea
sons the employee has for such an
extended leave and how much
they are needed in their depart
ment.
Matteoli said his interpreta
tion of the federal act is that the
non-disabled pregnancy and
infant care leave "is not manda
tory"; employees are "entitled"
to request the leave. "Other
dynamics go into it,"he said,
including information from the
mother's doctor and the opera
tional needs of the employee's
work group.
Matteoli said the University

has no intention of reducing the
four months allowed for verified
disability during pregnancy.
Employees with jdisabling ill
nesses can apply for long-term
disability support. But those with
non-disabling illnesses — such as
the flu — create a "fuzzy" situa
tion, Matteoli said. He noted that
the University will have to give
some thought to whether the new
law would require Stanford to
grant unpaid leave to such
employees.
Insurance and other policies
The federal act will require
employers to keep providing
healthy care benegits during the
leavec as though the worker
were still employed. Stanford,
which offers several medical
plan choices, continues paying
its portion of health premiums
only when the employee takes a
paid leave.
"When a person goes on short
term leave of absence — on short
term disability — if they have sick
and vacation time, they can do a
'buyback': The University contin
ues to give its full contribution.
All benefits continue to accrue,"
said Agnes Miller of the Benefits
Department.
During long-term disability, the
University pays its normal
amount. However, if the employee
is on leave but off the payroll, he or
she has to pay the entire amount of

the group rate premium.
Matteoli said that if Stanford
needs to adjust its insurance prac
tices to bring them in line with
federal rules, "then that's part of
the responsibility."
The federal act outlines a host
of other requirements. It allows
employers to exclude from the
bill's leave provisions the highest
paid 10 percent of their workers
as essential employees. But
according to Matteoli, these
employees are not excluded under
Stanford's current policy, "and
we have no intention to exclude
them under any revision."
The act also allows the exemp
tion of many part-timers and
workers who have been at a com
pany less than a year. While the
University defines a regular
employee as someone who has
worked for at least six months,
Matteoli said Stanford will consid
er granting the federal leave only
to workers who have been here at
least a year.
Under the new act, employees
cannot receive unemployment
insurance while they are on leave.
Matteoli said he did not know of
any such prohibition at Stanford,
noting that "anyone can go down
and file for unemployment." If
the University received a claim,
though, the employee would have
to show a convincing cause for
unemployment compensation.
While the federal act doesn't

mandate the specific inclusion of
domestic partners, Matteoli said
the University will include them
in the leave policy. "I don't think
we would treat anyone any dif
ferently," he said. "It would be
the same thing as a married cou
ple."
Union workers also covered !
Members of the United Stan
ford Workers union, which
includes many maintenance
employees and staff members,
are covered under similar policies
in their contract with the Uni
versity. A female worker can
receive leave when she is "inca
pable of performing her job effec
tively because of disability due to
normal pregnancy, delivery or
post-childbirth recovery." The
leave extends until she can work
again but not later than the sixth
week following the date of deliv
ery.
In addition, USW workers of
both sexes can take a month of
unpaid infant care leave. More
time may be approved by the Uni
versity.
Although the USW contract
will not be renegotiated until Aug.
31, 1994, Matteoli said union
workers will be able to benefit
from the new law in the interim.
"When the normal opening period
for the contract comes up, then
we'll make those changes," he
said.
While many businesses across the nation
are scrambling to comply with the "Family
and Medical Leave" act signed by President
Bill Clinton Feb. 5, Stanford employees can
revel in the fact that the University already
offers up to four months of disability leave
for pregnancy and childbirth and up to six
months for infant child care.
But over the next six months, before the
landmark legislation takes effect, Universi
ty administrators will have to take a close
look at ways to modify the policy in areas
that may contradict the new law.
The act provides about 40 percent of the
nation's workforce with up to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave annually. The time off can be
used to deal with birth, adoption, personal
sickness or the serious illness of an immedi
ate family member.
Businesses with 50 or more workers will
need to continue health insurance coverage

during their employees' leave and give em
ployees their old jobs when they return. Em
ployers are allowed to exclude from the bill's
leave provisions the highest-paid 10 percent
of their workers as "essential employees."
California is one of eleven states that al
ready have family leave laws. The California
Family Rights Act of 1991, which took effect
in January 1992, requires any company
with more than 50 employees to grant them
up to 16 weeks of unpaid leave within a two
year period and to provide them with the
same or a comparable job upon their return.
"We just got a copy of the federal law,"
said Tom Matteoli, director of employee re
lations. "We're taking a look at that, as well
as the state law, (to determine) which is
richer than the other."
The federal act allows eight more weeks
of leave in a two-year period than the state
law. And unlike the federal act — which
takes effect in early August — California
does not mandate continuation of
health benefits and does not give
workers the right to take off for
their own illnesses.
Where the federal legislation is
more <J enerouß * n benefits to
workers, it will take precedence.
Matteoli said Stanford's cur
rent policy is a sound one. "It pro
vides benefits to the individual
employee as well as helping the
University to plan accordingly
when employees request sick
leave," he said.
"We want to make sure we're
providing the benefit these laws
intended. We've started that pro
cess. I don't anticipate it taking
an inordinate amount of time."
Matteoli said his office hopes
changes can be made and incorpo
rated before the beginning of
August.
Time out for a baby
The University's current policy
of combining paid sick leave and
unpaid leave already offers much
of what the federal policy man
dates. Employees build up eight
hours of paid sick leave for every
calendar month of full-time pay.
They are allowed to use the leave
whenever illness or injury pre
vents them from working or if the

illness or injury of an immediate
family member requires the
employees' absence.
Although employees can carry
over sick leave indefinitely, cur
rently they can use no more than
15 days of sick leave during a
work year.
According to the University's
administrative guide, regular
employees are assured of the use
of accumulated sick leave and dis
ability leave without pay during
periods of "verified disability"
caused by pregnancy, childbirth
and recovery. The total period of
absence with and without pay
may be as long as four months.
When the employee is preg
nant — but not disabled — a
department may also grant per
sonal leave without pay. The
guide further stipulates that a
regular employee may be granted
"up to six months' leave without
pay for the purpose of infant care
following pregnancy or adoption
of a new infant in the family."
Both decisions, however, are "at
the department's discretion."
The infant care policy applies
to both men and women. But
asked if the policy allows a father
or partner to take off work while
the mother is going through preg
nancy and childbirth, Matteoli
said, "I'm not sure if the policy is
addressing that question specifi
cally . . . but if an employee
requests personal time off, and

there are extenuating circum
stances, and there's a real reason
the father needs to be present,
that's something we need to con
sider."
Usually the employee's imme
diate supervisor makes the deci
sion. "If there are issues sur
rounding approval, disapproval or
modification and the employee
and supervisor cannot reach a
mutual agreement," Matteoli
said, "a department head may be
involved." Employees may also
