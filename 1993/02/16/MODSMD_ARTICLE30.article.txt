# Men's tennis bagels competition
## Stanford drops only one set vs. UNLV, UC-Irvine 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
It was just another day at the office
for the men's tennis team. Dropping
only one set over the weekend's two
matches, the No. 2 Cardinal once again
proved its dominance in collegiate ten
nis. On Friday afternoon, Stanford
crushed UNLV, 7-0, and on Saturday,
the team blanked UC-Irvine as well.
"I don't remember ever playing two
decent teams and only dropping one
set," said head coach Dick Gould. "We
played points intelligently and didn't
overhit or underhit."
Although neither opponent was par
ticularly challenging, one impressive
aspect of the weekend was the Cardi
nal's ability to draw on the talents of
most of its members.
When senior Roman Sydorak came
down with the flu, freshman Jim
Thomas stepped into the singles lineup
on Friday and won his No. 6 match, 6-4,
6-0, over UNLV's Matt Hennessey.
Then when Thomas pulled a stomach
muscle, junior Billy Wright took over
the No. 6 spot on Saturday and notched
up a 6-2, 6-3 win against Irvine's Jerry
Miyamoto.
"I think I played an intelligent
match," Wright said. "I missed a couple
shots, but I didn't get down on myself. I
was just happy to be playing."
In the weekend's other matches,
Michael Flanagan tallied two No. 1 sin
gles wins and two No. 1 doubles victo
ries with partner Chris Cocotos.
The Rebels' Pat Boies forced Flana
gan to work for every point en route to
his 6-4, 6-3 win. "The guy didn't miss at
all," Flanagan said. "I needed to hit
winners to win. It was a really good
match for me."

His 6-4, 7-5 victory over Aaron Stolp
man on Saturday was marked by sharp
er volleys and a more aggressive style of
play " , ,
Despite their polar-opposite styles of
play, Flanagan and Cocotos easily won
their doubles matches, 8-2 and 8-4, on
Friday and Saturday, respectively.

'I don't remember ever
playing two decent teams
and only dropping one set'
— Coach Dick Gould

"I'm firing up more and [Flanagan's]
calming down, which is unusual for
both of us," Cocotos said.
Cocotos had an impressive singles
performance in the No. 2 spot, despite
dropping a set on Saturday. Friday's 6-
4, 6-4, routing of Matt Rivera was fol
lowed by an unusual, but formidable
challenge by the Anteaters' Chris
Tontz.
Tontz's two-handed forehand and
one-handed backhand were deadly
weapons throughout the first set but by
the middle of the second, the ammuni
tion was gone and Cocotos took charge,
rolling to a 3-6, 6-3, 6-0 victory.
"He was hitting all his shots (in the
first set), so I bided my time, put a cou
ple shots together and got lucky. Then
he got sloppy and frustrated and I held
my serve," Cocotos explained.
"(Tontz| played superbly, but Chris
didn't get stressed," Gould said. "It was
a good example of competing mental
toughness."
At No. 3 singles, junior Vimal Patel

notched up two more Cardinal victories:
6-1, 6-2 over UNLV's Charlie Olinger
and 6-3, 6-4 over Irvine's Fred Bach.
Classmate Robert Devens had similar
successes in the fourth slot. He routed
the Rebels' Roger Pettersson, 7-5, 6-4
and the Anteaters' Carlos Bustos, 6-2,
6-4.
Jeff Salzenstein added a 7-5, 6-2 win
over Wayne Bowyer on Friday and a 6-
3, 6-3 Saturday afternoon victory over
Luke Fitzsimmons. These matches
showcased Salzenstein's range of styles
on the court.
Salzenstein fared poorly when he
played aggressively against the defen
sive-minded Bowyer, finally beating his
opponent by staying in the backcourt.
However, on Saturday the Stanford
freshman was much more successful
when he came to the net.
Salzenstein teamed up with Devens
for back-to-back doubles successes. In
the third slot, the Cardinal pair won a
nailbiting 9-8 contest against Bowyer
and Olinger followed by a more relaxed
8-4 routing of Fitzsimmons and
Miyamota.
Finally, in No. 2 doubles action, Patel
paired up with Thomas on Friday to win
8-5. With Thomas sidelined on Satur
day, Patel teamed up with Wright to
defeat Bach and Bustos, 9-7.
"We were unsure at first but then we
got into a groove and did better," said
Wright, who had never played a match
with Patel.
Next on the team agenda is the
National Team Indoors which begin
later this week in Louisville, Ky.
Although this weekend's competition
was not of the caliber that the Cardinal
will face in Kentucky, the matches were
still "a nice little shot before going into
Indoors," according to Gould.
