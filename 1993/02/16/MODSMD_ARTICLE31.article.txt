# Women swimmers down California, 177-117

### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Winning 12 of 14 races, the No. 2 Stanford
women swimmers cruised by No. 9 California
last Saturday, 177-117.
Co-captain Janel Jorgensen achieved the
only new NCAA qualifying standard of the meet
as she clocked a 4 minute, 17.49 second time in
the 400-yard individual medley.
"That was an excellent swim," said head coach
Richard Quick. "We really liked her breaststroke
leg, because that was the one she was looking to
improve upon for her 200 IM event."
Jorgensen, who has already qualified in the
200 IM and the 100 and 200 butterfly, will not
swim the 400 IM at the NCAA Championships
because each swimmer is limited to three indi
vidual events.
"Overall, she's a great athlete and we expect
swims like that from her," Quick said. "I think,
realistically, that's an event that she could con
tend to win at the NCAA's if she wasn't swim
ming three already."
Olympian Jenny Thompson continued to
dominate in the 100 and 200 freestyle (49.86
and 1:47.48), as well as the 100 fly event (54.92).

Senior freestyle and EM specialist Katherine
Comanor also turned in a good swim by coming
within 0.06 seconds of the NCAA qualifying
mark in the 400 IM (4:19.99). In the the 200
backstroke, freshman Tammy Shannon's time
of 1:59.20 inched her closer to the NCAA-quali
fying time of 1:58.23.
"We had some swimmers make real improve
ments over the weekend, and it's only a matter
of time before they qualify," Quick said. "And of
course we still had the steady, consistently out
standing performances from Jenny Thompson,
Lea Loveless and Janel Jorgensen. Overall, it
was a good, solid meet."
Against the Golden Bears, Quick used a line
up which had several of his top swimmers com
peting in off-events, in order to practice race
strategies, and give more swimmers a chance to
qualify. However, as always, the main focus was
team unity and fast times.
"This was our last dual meet and our last
opportunity to learn from head-to-head compe
tition," Loveless said. "We started nonchalant,
but quickly figured out that we had to come
together as a team in order to make everything
work. That's what we'll have to do from now
until the NCAA's in order to win."

Jorgensen agreed. "In each meet that we're
competing in, we're getting stronger, both in
the water and as a team. Both elements are crit
ical if we want to repeat as NCAA champions,"
she said.
After ending the regular season at Berkeley
last weekend, the Cardinal swimmers now have
two weeks off before they compete at the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships, where they
will try to qualify a total of 17 swimmers for the
NCAA meet. Stanford has already qualified
eight individuals and has another three right on
the borderline.
Those swimmers who have swum just short
of the qualifying mark fall into the NCAA con
sideration category and are being tapered and
rested in order to strengthen their chances of
qualifying in the Pac-10 meet.
Although the Stanford squad made several
noted improvements against the Golden Bears,
it still has some fine-tuning to do before the
NCAA Championships.
"We still need some speed," Quick said.
"We're good in the 200 events, but not quite fast
enough in the 100 and 50 events. Speed is usu
ally the last thing to come, so I think we're in a
really good position."
