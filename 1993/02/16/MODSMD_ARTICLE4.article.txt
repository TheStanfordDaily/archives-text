In addition to the standard cake and
candles, Stanford's East Asian Studies
Theme House will be celebrating its 10th
birthday this week with drummers,
dancers and programs focusing on the po
litical and cultural heritage of East Asia.
The residents and house staff are gear
ing up for EAST Fest, an annual cultural
celebration that begins tonight at 7 p.m.
with a lecture on "Women and Develop
ment in East Asia." The festival continues

with daily lectures on topics such as the
Clinton Administration's relations with
Japan and a cultural program on Satur
day with performances of Japanese Taiko
drums and Salangaioli, an Indian classical
dance.
"The idea behind the event is that East
Asian culture is something to be studied
on a variety of levels. It can be eaten. It can
be watched. It can be listened to," ex
plained Resident Fellow Jim Ketelaar, an
assistant professor of history. "It's set up
to give the campus a mini-view of what the
house does."

Because of the house's 10-year an
niversary, theme associates said this
year's festival promises to be something
very special. "I've come to EAST Fest be
fore, and every year you want to make it
better," said theme associate Rohit
Singla. "We've made a real effort this year
to get great speakers and bring up the
quality of everything."
While EAST Fest may only last a week,
the house presents a variety of events all
year round. Theme associates arrange
speakers, demonstrations and a dorm film
series to explore various aspects of East

Asian culture.
Junior Linda Shih said she has known
she wanted to live in EAST House "ever
since I was a freshman. I visited my big sib
here and just fell in love with the place."
Many residents haven't just studied
East Asian life. They've lived it. Several
drew into EAST as a way being around re
minders of past life or travel in Asia.
"Living in EAST House helps me deal
with my homesickness for Okinawa,
Japan," said senior Shawn Ryan.
Senior Colin Johnson said he likes to
live among people with similar interests.

"It's a great way to stay in touch. I was in
Japan last year and it's great to be around
people who help keep that experience and
that memory alive," he said.
In addition, 75 to 80 percent of the
house's 62 residents are there on priority,
according to Ketelaar. Those residents
agree to help with programming, includ
ing a theme project and EAST Fest, he
said.
Approximately one third of the resi
dents enter EAST with "Priority 1,"
