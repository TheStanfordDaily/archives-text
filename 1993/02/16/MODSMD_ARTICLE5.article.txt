### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution and a historian of the former Soviet
Union, has been chosen to deliver the prestigious Jef
ferson Lecture in the Humanities for 1993.
The award, given annually by the National En
dowment for the Humanities, honors intellectual and
civic achievements as demonstrated by the life and
works of Thomas Jefferson.
Conquest said he was "honored to receive the high
est award in the humanities." He will deliver the lec
ture May 5 in Washington, D.C., and on campus a
week later. He also will receive a $10,000 prize.
He said he is currently preparing his speech, in

which he will discuss the importance of understand
ing foreign cultures.
"As Jefferson said, we can learn a lot from other
nations and other times. Getting the world into per
spective involves observing different people and cul
tures," he said.
The 76-year-old Conquest has written numerous
books on the Soviet Union. In the 1960s his research
explored the atrocities of the Stalinist era and the So
viet totalitarianism. His most recent book, "Stalin:
Breaker of Nations," was published in 1991.
Mikhail Bernstam, a senior Hoover fellow who has
been in close contact with Conquest for the past
twelve years, dubbed him "a major intellectual of the
20th century."
"I think he deserves the award
very much," said Bernstam. "He
is a remarkable, admirable col
league, a man of knowledge, cul
ture and broad understanding —
the true Renaissance man."
At present, Conquest has no
definite plans for future research.
When asked how he foresees
the future of the former Soviet
Union, Conquest responded, "I'm

a historian. I believe in the impos
sibility of prediction, and this is a
particularly difficult situation to
predict.
"I think there are two mes
sages coming out of Russia right
now. One is that things are fright
ful there. Another is that the peo
ple are exhausted, worn out with
crises and continual bullying into
being part of the [former]
regime."
Past winners of the award
include historian Barbara Tuch
man, novelists Saul Bellow and
Robert Penn Warren and psychol
ogist Erik Erikson.
