# Conference discusses racial issues
##

"We have to take very seriously
the growing anti-Semitism among
blacks and the growing racism
among Jews," Ruth Rosen, a his
tory professor from UC-Davis,
told an audience at Tresidder
Union on Friday.
Rosen was one of six speakers
who discussed political, social and
economic relations between the
two ethnic groups at a symposium
titled, "African Americans and

American Jews: Bridges, Bound
aries, Identities."
The speakers tried to trace the
history of oppression and preju
dice the two groups have faced in
order to understand current feel
ings among African-Americans
and Jews.
Stanford History Prof. Steven
Zipperstein, director of the Pro
gram in Jewish Studies, said the
symposium was organized be
cause of the "visibility of tensions
between African-Americans and
Jews in this country."

"I hope the conference helped to
explode stereotypes," he said. "It's
not impossible to take one's own
needs seriously and to take serious
ly the concerns of other people."
Zipperstein said that there are
often extraordinary divisions be
tween African-Americans and
Jews. He called their relationship
"intense, if not often an incoher
ent mutual preoccupation."
History Prof. Clayborne Car
son, another speaker, reflected on
the breadth of the relationship
between African-Americans and
Jews.
"There is an alliance of civil
rights leaders and their organiza
tions, not of groups of people," he
said.
After the symposium, Carson
said that communication between
African-Americans and Jews is
essential because when the
groups do not get along, the
nation as a whole is hurt.
"This is a necessary dialogue
because the progressive move
ments in the United States are so

dependent on the enthusiastic
participation of blacks and Jews,"
he said. "The movements are
severely damaged when [the
groupsj don't work together to
reassert their traditional roles as
spearheads."
Zipperstein said he was pleased
with the outcome of the confer
ence.
"The feeling in the room was
intellectually intense but conge
nial," he said. "It is important to
build bridges to other sectors of
society. There was more that
bound us together than kept us
apart."
He added that he plans to pro
pose a cross-disciplinary course
on relations between Jews and
African-Americans.
