## Grad student wins national racewalking championship 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
When graduate student Jonathan Matthews
went for a walk Sunday, he took more than an or
dinary weekend stroll — and won a national title,
as well as $4,000.
Matthews, who is writing his dissertation in art
education, became the national racewalkingcham
pion after easily winning a 4-hour, 50-kilometer
race in Palo Alto.
"That was fun!" Matthews, 37, said after cross
ing the finish line. "It was the easiest 50 kilometers
I've ever done."
His performance — at four hours and one
minute — was his best time ever and the fourth
best recorded for this event in the United States.
"Jonathan was only five minutes over my time
of 3:56 which is the record for this course," said
Mark Evonuik, a four-time Olympian who was
forced to drop out of the race due to cramps.
"Jonathan can definitely improve. Today's race
was pretty much solo. Later on when he has more
competition he can definitely break four hours."
The thirty-one mile race began and ended at
Faber Place just off Embarcadero Road. The rac
ers made twenty trips around a 2.5 kilometer loop.
The best racers averaged around twelve minutes a
loop or eight minutes a mile. The 50-kilometer
racewalk is the longest footrace in the Olympics,

longer than the marathon.
Matthews beat second place
finisher Herman Nelson by about
eight minutes.
With a time of 4:01:36,
Matthews qualified for the Track
and Field World Championships
this August in Stuttgart, Ger
many. He will also participate in
the Olympic Festival and World
Cup this summer.
Matthews, who began walking
competitively three years ago,
eclipsed his previous best of
4:12:36. Stephanie Akiama-
Matthews, Jonathan's wife
explained his quick rise to the
championship, saying, "Jonathan's

a great athlete. He's self-taught
and very dedicated."
"Jonathan walked an even
pace, set a goal for himself, and he
will be rewarded," said Wayne
Glusker, a race organizer, 3:35
into the competition.
Competitors and organizers
said the 50-kilometer event is
comparable in difficulty to a
marathon. The walker must
always be in contact with the
ground and the walker's leg must
be vertical when it is directly
beneath the body, giving the event
a sometimes unusual appearance.
The turnover from foot to foot
must be as fast as a sprinter's.
"A 50-kilometer race requires
all the skills of a marathoner to an
even higher degree. It's a four
hour race so it requires more
focus and endurance. And the

motion is comparable to run
ning," said Matthews.
"These walkers are athletes in
the truest sense. The distance is a
grueling one that demands the
keenest mental and physical
preparation," said race director
Ron Daniel, who competed in 50-
kilometer races throughout the
'60s and '70s.
The field that competed Sunday
consisted of several Olympians
and three Bay Area residents. The
top five finishers will go on to the
Racewalking Team World Cup
Championship in Monterrey, Mex
ico in April and the Olympic Festi
val held in July. Nelson and
Matthews will also go to the Track
and Field World Championships.
But despite the stakes, the
atmosphere of the competition
was friendly and amiable. Chil

dren and organizers crossed the
route frequently, running the risk
of collisions with the fast-walking
athletes. Family and friends vol
unteered at drink and food sta
tions.
Racewalking "is an underap
preciated sport in this country.
The stride looks funny to most
people, but it demands true ath
letic skill," said Matthews. He was
a member of the national cycling
team until he "broke his face pret
ty badly" when he crashed during
a 120-mile bike race.
Matthews, who has a history of
chronic Achilles tendon problems,
said he took up race walking
because it is a generally injury
free sport.
He said his ultimate goal is to
compete in the 1996 Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
