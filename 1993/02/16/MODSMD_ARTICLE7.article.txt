## Grad student wins national racewalking championship 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
When graduate student Jonathan Matthews
went for a walk Sunday, he took more than an or
dinary weekend stroll — and won a national title,
as well as $4,000.
Matthews, who is writing his dissertation in art
education, became the national racewalkingcham
pion after easily winning a 4-hour, 50-kilometer
race in Palo Alto.
"That was fun!" Matthews, 37, said after cross
ing the finish line. "It was the easiest 50 kilometers
I've ever done."
His performance — at four hours and one
minute — was his best time ever and the fourth
best recorded for this event in the United States.
"Jonathan was only five minutes over my time
of 3:56 which is the record for this course," said
Mark Evonuik, a four-time Olympian who was
forced to drop out of the race due to cramps.
"Jonathan can definitely improve. Today's race
was pretty much solo. Later on when he has more
competition he can definitely break four hours."
The thirty-one mile race began and ended at
Faber Place just off Embarcadero Road. The rac
ers made twenty trips around a 2.5 kilometer loop.
The best racers averaged around twelve minutes a
loop or eight minutes a mile. The 50-kilometer
racewalk is the longest footrace in the Olympics,
