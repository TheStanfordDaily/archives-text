Misery in Sarajevo
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Sarajevo's misery hit a new low
yesterday as the last operating bakery
ran out of fuel to make bread and the
capital's 380,000 residents were told to
stay indoors because of fierce shelling.
Snow was back on the streets of the
embattled city. A natural gas pipeline
was cut, and electric power was available
through only one precarious line.
City leaders refused for a fourth day
to distribute U.N. food aid to protest the
U.N.'s failure to get supplies to eastern
Bosnia, where up to 200,000 Muslims
are said to be trapped in pockets of land
surrounded by Serbs.
Mortar shells thudded into downtown
Sarajevo and shells fired by government
forces hit some Serb positions. Saraje
vo's main hospital said three people were
killed and 18 wounded yesterday.
Poles get abortion limits
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — President
Lech Walesa signed an anti-abortion law
yesterday that strictly limits the proce
dure and punishes doctors who violate
the rules with up to two years in prison.
Walesa's signature culminated nearly
three years of debate that deeply divided
the country and saw the former Solidarity

coalition split between liberals and conser
vatives in this heavily Roman Catholic
nation.
The anti-abortion bill reverses Po
land's virtual abortion-on-demand regu
lations from the Communist era.
Tyson's lawyers appeal
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A judge who
kept key witnesses from testifying and
blocked the introduction of important evi
dence allowed Mike Tyson to be wrongly
convicted of rape, his lawyer argued yes
terday in appealing for a new trial.
"We want a new trial in which all the
evidence can be presented to a jury,"
attorney Alan Dershowitz told a group of
law students after two hours of argu
ment before a three-judge appeals panel.
The Indiana Court of Appeals panel is
not expected to rule on the request for at
least two months, court officials said.
Gifford denied a jury the necessary
tools of evidence by blocking testimony
from three defense witnesses and refus
ing jurors a chance to consider whether
his accuser had consented to sex, the for
mer heavyweight boxing champion's
lawyers said.
"It is obvious if they had these tools,
they would have acquitted Mike Tyson,"
said Nathan Dershowitz, another defense
attorney and the brother of Alan.
