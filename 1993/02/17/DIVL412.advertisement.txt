BLACK LIBERATION MONTH
TISSUE TYPING DRIVE
Attention African American Students, Faculty and Staff:
The Problem:
Hundreds of African Americans are dying from leukemia, aplastic anemia
and other blood diseases.
The Reason
They are dying because they cannot find a matching bone marrow donor.
Statistically, the chances of finding a life-saving donor are significantly
greater if the donor is another African American. Sadly, the current pool of
potential African American marrow donors is less than 5%. As a result, only
20 African Americans have received matching marrow transplants since
1987. In comparison, over 1,200 Caucasian Patients have received
transplants.
The Solution
More African Americans need to register with the National Marrow Donor
Program. By doing so, we increase the chances of finding potentially life
saving matcnes for those African Americans who are now dying.
Please do your part and give a blood sample. Remember, you can make a
difference in someone's lire!
Time: 11:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.
Where: Ujamaa Large Lounge
* healthy adults between 18-55
