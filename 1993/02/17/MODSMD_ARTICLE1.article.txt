tion for economic
sacrifice, Stanford's
president also has a
gloomy message

that warns of impending catastrophe unless
people accept fundamental change.
In a style remarkably similar to that of Clin
ton's, Gerhard Casper has been laying the
groundwork for a mtyor reexamination of the
way American universities do business.
By floating "trial balloons" like last week's
proposal for a three-year alternative to the
four-year degree, he hopes to focus attention
on the long-term challenges facing higher edu

cation — and shape public opinion so that it is
responsive to radical changes.
But just as Clinton must convince a skepti
cal public of the necessity for drastic measures,
Casper must convince Stanford that the as
sumptions underlying his proposals are cor
rect.
That will be a difficult task, with many rush
ing to defend the sanctity of the four-year ex
perience, and others criticizing Casper's pro
posal as stressing careerism over intellectual
ism.
Casper alluded to the reaction he is likely to
receive in his address in San Francisco last
week, when he proposed the three-year option.
"The usual letters of vehement disagreement
will come," he said. "Have you noticed that
hardly anybody these days sends you a letter
quietly pointing out where you may have

erred? Instead the authors are 'appalled, 'dis
mayed,' or 'deeply saddened.' "
Casper's proposal builds on a long-running
debate in academic circles — one that drew na
tional attention three years ago when S. Fred
erick Starr, the president of Oberlin College,
called for a three-year degree in a New York
Times Op-Ed piece.
Casper's proposal, which he called a "first
step," is hardly revolutionary, simply institu
tionalizing and encouraging an option that al
ready exists for many students.
But it represents a clear break with Casper's
previous style of "thinking aloud" — acting as
a devil's advocate rather than suggesting con
crete solutions. Casper has made it clear that
he is thinking more immediately than many
