# A 						call for sacrifice
## Like Clinton, Casper offers a hard-to-swallow panacea

Like President Clinton, in the midst of the
politically unpopular task of preparing the na-

tion for economic
sacrifice, Stanford's
president also has a
gloomy message

that warns of impending catastrophe unless
people accept fundamental change.
In a style remarkably similar to that of Clin
ton's, Gerhard Casper has been laying the
groundwork for a mtyor reexamination of the
way American universities do business.
By floating "trial balloons" like last week's
proposal for a three-year alternative to the
four-year degree, he hopes to focus attention
on the long-term challenges facing higher edu

cation — and shape public opinion so that it is
responsive to radical changes.
But just as Clinton must convince a skepti
cal public of the necessity for drastic measures,
Casper must convince Stanford that the as
sumptions underlying his proposals are cor
rect.
That will be a difficult task, with many rush
ing to defend the sanctity of the four-year ex
perience, and others criticizing Casper's pro
posal as stressing careerism over intellectual
ism.
Casper alluded to the reaction he is likely to
receive in his address in San Francisco last
week, when he proposed the three-year option.
"The usual letters of vehement disagreement
will come," he said. "Have you noticed that
hardly anybody these days sends you a letter
quietly pointing out where you may have

erred? Instead the authors are 'appalled, 'dis
mayed,' or 'deeply saddened.' "
Casper's proposal builds on a long-running
debate in academic circles — one that drew na
tional attention three years ago when S. Fred
erick Starr, the president of Oberlin College,
called for a three-year degree in a New York
Times Op-Ed piece.
Casper's proposal, which he called a "first
step," is hardly revolutionary, simply institu
tionalizing and encouraging an option that al
ready exists for many students.
But it represents a clear break with Casper's
previous style of "thinking aloud" — acting as
a devil's advocate rather than suggesting con
crete solutions. Casper has made it clear that
he is thinking more immediately than many
had thought: This is not a
detached, academic debate but a
proposal that has a real chance of
being implemented.
While Casper has been por
trayed as a reformer advocating
change on the national level, he
said in surprisingly blunt terms
last week that finding a system
that works for Stanford is his first
goal.
"I want to worry about Stan

ford and start there," he said.
"How much is possible elsewhere
I don't know."
By limiting the range so
sharply, Casper effectively shuts
out much of the criticism that his
suggestions have received so far.
Many critics, for example, have
said the three-year option would
be unfeasible at public schools —
a critique that becomes moot if
the debate is centered on Stan
ford.
But Casper may face his
largest challenge in justifying the
assumption that his proposal
rests upon: that tuition must

inevitably rise. Two days after the
University raised tuition by 7.5
percent — about 4 percent above
the rate of inflation — Casper
argued, "These kinds of incre
mental cost pressures will always
remain very high. . . . That means
looking at alternatives."
For some students, it is diffi
cult to see why the alternative
can't simply be keeping the Uni
versity's costs down. They see the
three-year plan as a smokescreen
that fails to address the real prob
lems — a salve offered to families
that allows universities to avoid
reforming themselves.

"The three-year scheme is a
way to deflect the cost problem,"
said T.J. Perkins, a first-year stu
dent in the Graduate School of
Business. "He's suggesting that
students are dilly-dallying — that
they're wasting their time and
could [finish) in three years. I
think that's hogwash."
Sophomore David Himelfarb,
who plans to graduate in three
years to save money, agreed. The
three-year plan "is sort of the eas
iest way out of it,"he said.
"Instead of finding a way to lower
tuition, he's finding a way to get
us out of here more quickly."
