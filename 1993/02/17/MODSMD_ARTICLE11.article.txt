# Anorexia an 'existential disaster'
## 
### Sarah Katz 
Referring to anorexia nervosa as "an existential
disaster," Dr. Regina Casper, in a lecture yesterday,
attributed most of the disease's causes to social and
psychological factors.
A professor of psychiatry who has received inter
national recognition for her research on eating dis
orders, Casper gave the presentation, titled
"Anorexia Nervosa: A Woman's Disorder," as part of
a one-unit Women's Health Research Seminar.
About 50 people — mostly women — attended the
program. *
Casper said that although anorexia has severe
physical results, it is primarily a psychological dis
ease.
"Anorexia always goes hand in hand ... with a
devastatingly poor self-image" which often results
from emotional turmoil or upsetting events, said
Casper.
"Weight loss is not necessarily due to dieting,"
she said. When a woman loses weight due to depres
sion or illness, she may like this change and make a
conscious decision to continue losing weight.
And despite significant weight loss, patients often
feel well, she said. Casper stressed this "peculiar
phenomenon" as one of the most important reasons
that anorexics are able to continue their weight loss
to such dangerous extremes.
From the beginning, the person develops an

"anorexic attitude," an intense fear of eating and
becoming fat again. The anorexic then proceeds to
starve herself, often losing up to 40 percent of her
original body weight before she receives treat
ment.
An anorexic's "body image does not adjust to the
weight loss to the same degree as in normal people,"
she said. "Normal people know when they have lost
weight."
Another cause of the disorder, Casper explained,
is a need for independence and control in the
patient's life. "Anorexia nervosa is basically an exis
tential disaster. The person tries through starvation
to realize herself, to show that [she] can achieve
something all on [her] own," she said.
Denial also marks the course of the disease,
Casper said. Anorexics are often proud of their ema
ciated appearance. "They really can lose perspective
on how they look," said Casper.
As Casper concluded her speech, she emphasized
that treatment for anorexia often requires an entire
psychological change for the anorexic. She quoted a
passage from the Bible as the best recommendation
for treatment: "Let your behavior change, modelled
by your new mind."
"Some patients are very happy being so thin.
They feel in charge, in control of their lives," said
Casper. "To give that up is a painful process.... We
must give them a promise that they will do better
without the anorexia."
