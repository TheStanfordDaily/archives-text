U.N. to inspect Iraq
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - The U.N.
plans to send more weapons inspectors to
Baghdad and conduct aerial surveys of
two sites where it suspects Saddam Hus
sein's government designed nuclear mis
siles, U.N. officials said yesterday.
The decision to challenge Saddam's ban
on flights over Baghdad will test Iraqi com
pliance with U.N. Security Council terms
for ending the Persian Gulf War. If Iraq
refuses to comply, it could lead to President
Clinton's first showdown with Saddam.
Saddam's government long denied it
was trying to develop nuclear warheads,
but U.N. teams have reported finding evi
dence that the Iraqis had made substan
tial progress toward building such
weapons before the Gulf War.
Tim Trevan, a spokesman for the U.N.
Special Commission overseeing the

destruction of Iraq's major weapons sys
tems, said inspection teams will exercise
their right to fly over Baghdad "when we
have the operational need to do so."
Stress for King jurors
OXNARD, Calif. (AP) — Ten months
after the verdicts in the Rodney King beat
ing case sparked rioting in Los Angeles, sev
eral of the jurors from the state trial in Simi
Valley continue to live in fear and anger.
At least two jurors say they have devel
oped post-traumatic stress disorder, a
syndrome seen in Vietnam War veterans.
Others say they suffer depression, high
blood pressure and feelings of paranoia.
"It's been a nightmare," said one
juror. "[lt's] more of a nightmare kind of
thing where you know something is
going to happen; you feel very threat
ened."
