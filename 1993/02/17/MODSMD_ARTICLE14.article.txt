# Clinton urges tax hike for rich

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - On the eve
of addressing Congress, President Clin
ton tried to smooth the way yesterday
for an economic austerity plan that
would impose higher taxes on families
making more than $30,000 but reserve
the biggest blow for Americans earning
$100,000 or above.
Wall Street was jittery about Clin
ton's plan. The stock market tumbled
nearly 83 points on fears that higher
taxes would short-circuit an economic
revival and would not be accompanied
by deep cuts in government spending.
Clinton shrugged off the drop, say
ing, "The people in the stock market
have known in general all along what
was going to be in the program."
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
said the market was reacting to Clin
ton's speech Monday night. "Dropping
like a rock," Dole said. "Hold onto your
wallets."

The president will go before a joint
session of Congress with a nationally
televised speech at 6 p.m. tonight to
explain details of his $500 billion plan of
tax increases and spending cuts over
four years.
There will be an increase in the top
individual and corporate income tax
rates and an increase in the percentage
of Social Security benefits subject to
taxation for couples earning over
$32,000 or individuals earning more
than $25,000.
George Stephanopoulos, White
House communications director, said
that families making less than
$30,000 "are very likely to have no
increase at all in their taxes." He said
that in the $30,000-$50,000 range,
there would be a "very small tax
increase," essentially a broad-based
energy tax. Officials indicated Clinton
decided to apply a surtax to incomes of

about $250,000.
White House aides stressed Clinton's
statement that 70 percent of the revenue
from all of the higher taxes would come
from households earning $100,000 or
more. Officials said that those with
adjusted gross incomes of $140,000 and
joint filers with incomes of about
$180,000 would pay at a rate of 36 per
cent, as opposed to the current top rate
of about 31 percent.
Beyond the taxes to be announced
today, White House press secretary Dee
Dee Meyers confirmed that the adminis
tration is considering increases to pay
for universal health care.
Among the options are taxes on pre
miums collected by insurance compa
nies, new corporate taxes and increased
taxes on such items as tobacco, alcohol,
guns and pollutants. Stephanopoulos
said Clinton has not made any decisions
on the proposal.
