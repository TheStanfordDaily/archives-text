## Refunds — one for all 
### 
IT MAY SEEM trivial to ask for
a refund for your $1.36 that
goes to SURE or your $0.71
that funds the Stanford American
Indian Association, but that
request should not be tied to your
participation in the ASSU Spring
election.
The ASSU does grant a few
refunds to non-voting students —
but only if a student was overseas
or not registered as a Stanford stu
dent during the election.
However, some students may
consciously choose not to vote,
hoping to make the point that the
ASSU bureaucracy is inefficient
and unproductive.
Although it may seem logical to
claim that those who do not vote
do not have the right to ask for
refunds, it seems more sensible to
allow student refunds to check the
efficiency of the ASSU. If a large
number of students ask for

refunds, perhaps it serves as a
message to the ASSU that they are
mishandling their supervision of
student funds; if a small number
of students ask for their money
back, it acts as a vote of confidence
for the ASSU.
You don't have to vote in the
real world to receive an income
tax refund, so why should the
ASSU bribe students to vote in
order to be eligible for their fee
refunds?
For an income tax refund, you
need not cast a ballot in the school
board election, gubernatorial elec
tion or even the presidential elec
tion; you need only be a part of the
community.
Students on our campus con
tribute to our community simply
by being here, and it is irrelevant
whether or not they vote in the
ASSU elections — they deserve a
choice.
