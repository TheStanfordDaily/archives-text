TO QUOTE A cliche, the
ASSU is a lot like the weath
er â€” everyone complains
about it, but nobody does anything
to change it.
But that doesn't mean that
some people don't try to make a
quick $35 in the process.
Currently, a student must have
voted in the spring ASSU elec
tions, or have had an extenuating
excuse, in order to receive a fee
refund from the ASSU. However,.it
has been proposed that any and all
students should be allowed to con
fiscate their fees, even if they did
not bother to vote in the Stanford
elections.
Most universities don't even
offer their students the opportu
nity to receive a refund. Stanford
does, and has established an emi
nently fair restriction to their pol
icy.
After all, if a student didn't
even bother to voice his or her
opinion earlier in the year, does he

or she have the right to cry "foul"
about ASSU spending?
The current system is a form of
meritocracy. Those people who put
forth the effort to get involved
with University government and
policy-making are rewarded; those
who do not are left to reconsider
their apathy.
However, if the proposed refund
policy is enacted, not only will
those students with legitimate
.grievances and concerns be taking
money away from groups like the
Speaker's Bureau and the Concert
Network, but so too will those who
couldn't care less about these pro
grams but need $35 to go to
Tahoe.
It has often been said that a stu
dent gets out of Stanford what he
or she puts into Stanford. The cur
rent fee-refund system has been a
literal translation of this policy.
In the real world, you can't get
something for nothing. Why
should you here?
