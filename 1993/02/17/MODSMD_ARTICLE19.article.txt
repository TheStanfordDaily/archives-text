Alpha Sig's problems have ended, house president states

DESPITE MY sentiment that the
campus newspaper is an improp
er forum for our dorm to resolve
internal conflict, I feel compelled to
respond to Jay Mason's comments
regarding Alpha Sig. The reason for
this is that I have become aware of the
extent to which the Stanford communi
ty forms its opinions by the principle of
"Where there's smoke, there's fire,"
and by what is written in The Daily. I
strongly object to several aspects of
Mason's letter.
First, it is at times factually inaccu
rate — for example, all expenditures
on alcohol are scrupulously recorded,
and non-drinkers pay proportionately
lower house fees — and is more often
simply misleading. Incidents from past
years are cited as evidence of a current
problem.
The letter is deceptive and alarmist,
manipulating extreme examples which
took place while many of us lived in
freshman dorms (or were applying to
Stanford). The current residents of
Alpha Sig should not be judged for any
hazing, substance abuse or disturbing
situations which primarily occurred
two years ago or earlier.
The atmosphere of Alpha Sig is uni
versally acknowledged — by actives
and alumni — to have changed dra
matically this year. The important
issue is whether an environment exists
now which encourages harmful activi
ties. Mason's response to this question

was that it does, and that "nobody that
I can see seems to think that anything
should be done about it."
It is now clear that this opinion was
the result of bad luck, as Mason was
not yet aware that such efforts were
already being made. Having taken over
as president this quarter, it is my job to
find out who dislikes the dorm environ
ment, and why. I have been attempting
to do this, but was unable to construc
tively respond to Mason's comment on
the board regarding the "Hour of
Power" because, for whatever reasons,
he did not sign his name. I maintain,
however, that if Mason was searching
for people who might be concerned
about the perceived problems, the
incoming house president would be a
logical person to try first.
My final objection regards allega
tions of hazing this year. I was a "shit
tie" in the fall, and it was one of the
best experiences of my life. Initiation is
intended purely as a means of commu
nicating to new residents that they are
welcome in Alpha Sig's extended com
munity.
Following a week of childish, hope
fully amusing pranks perpetrated by the
shitties, the actives spend a full week
trying to make the new residents feel
accepted. The strong communal bonds
which result are the primary reason
that alumni will often travel great dis
tances to take part in Initiation again
and again. Everyone I have spoken with

who actively participated this year
enjoyed Initiation immensely.
There is no place in Initiation for
maliciousness or physical or mental
harm — they are totally contrary to
the event's purpose. The only charge of
hazing which included hurtful intent
involved an active throwing a new resi
dent into a dumpster.
I disagree with any implication that
this was caused by a pervasive dorm
atmosphere because: A) people bear the
responsibility for their own actions, and
B) no other actives were driven to act
maliciously, probably because such
actions are totally against the spirit of
Initiation. In fact, this active was
immediately reprimanded by house offi
cers for being totally out of line, and
apologized to the victim.
Other problems stemmed from the
fact that the purpose of Initiation was
not made sufficiently clear beforehand
— some new residents imagined that it
was an opportunity for past and old res
idents to abuse new residents, and
therefore did not participate.
This is clearly an unfortunate mis
conception, and I can promise that this
communication problem will not per
sist next year. The dorm is now
painfully aware that actions, such as
permitting an environment which may
have fostered this misunderstanding,
can constitute hazing, regardless of
whether they involve only voluntary
participants and are done without

harmful intent.
My view of our dorm is that it fills
an important niche on campus. The
most important aspect of Alpha Sig is
that its members attempt to be non
judgemental.
Those who do not wish to conform to
the popular Stanford lifestyle of bury
ing one's nose in a book and running
three times a week are not driven
underground.
Just as Mason says that Alpha Sig
needs to be responsible to all members
of its community, Stanford needs to do
the same: some people, myself included,
feel alienated by Stanford's dominant
culture.
I cannot possibly describe my affec
tion for Alpha Sig in a single response,
nor can the entire dorm be accurately
represented by a few letters. These
issues are all very complex and, as they
regard Alpha Sig, I hope that in the
future they will be handled within the
house rather than through The Daily; a
structure for that does exist.
If anyone in the Stanford community
has any questions or would like to
understand my perspective as a person
who would no longer be at Stanford if
Alpha Sig did not exist, please feel free
to contact me. I hope that such dis
course will replace rumors and old sto
ries about the dorm as a means of
defining our image.

and by what is written in The Daily. I
strongly object to several aspects of
Mason's letter.
First, it is at times factually inaccu
rate — for example, all expenditures
on alcohol are scrupulously recorded,
and non-drinkers pay proportionately
lower house fees — and is more often
simply misleading. Incidents from past
years are cited as evidence of a current
problem.
The letter is deceptive and alarmist,
manipulating extreme examples which
took place while many of us lived in
freshman dorms (or were applying to
Stanford). The current residents of
Alpha Sig should not be judged for any
hazing, substance abuse or disturbing
situations which primarily occurred
two years ago or earlier.
The atmosphere of Alpha Sig is uni
versally acknowledged — by actives
and alumni — to have changed dra
matically this year. The important
issue is whether an environment exists
now which encourages harmful activi
ties. Mason's response to this question

was that it does, and that "nobody that
I can see seems to think that anything
should be done about it."
It is now clear that this opinion was
the result of bad luck, as Mason was
not yet aware that such efforts were
already being made. Having taken over
as president this quarter, it is my job to
find out who dislikes the dorm environ
ment, and why. I have been attempting
to do this, but was unable to construc
tively respond to Mason's comment on
the board regarding the "Hour of
Power" because, for whatever reasons,
he did not sign his name. I maintain,
however, that if Mason was searching
for people who might be concerned
about the perceived problems, the
incoming house president would be a
logical person to try first.
My final objection regards allega
tions of hazing this year. I was a "shit
tie" in the fall, and it was one of the
best experiences of my life. Initiation is
intended purely as a means of commu
nicating to new residents that they are
welcome in Alpha Sig's extended com
munity.
Following a week of childish, hope
fully amusing pranks perpetrated by the
shitties, the actives spend a full week
trying to make the new residents feel
accepted. The strong communal bonds
which result are the primary reason
that alumni will often travel great dis
tances to take part in Initiation again
and again. Everyone I have spoken with

who actively participated this year
enjoyed Initiation immensely.
There is no place in Initiation for
maliciousness or physical or mental
harm — they are totally contrary to
the event's purpose. The only charge of
hazing which included hurtful intent
involved an active throwing a new resi
dent into a dumpster.
I disagree with any implication that
this was caused by a pervasive dorm
atmosphere because: A) people bear the
responsibility for their own actions, and
B) no other actives were driven to act
maliciously, probably because such
actions are totally against the spirit of
Initiation. In fact, this active was
immediately reprimanded by house offi
cers for being totally out of line, and
apologized to the victim.
Other problems stemmed from the
fact that the purpose of Initiation was
not made sufficiently clear beforehand
— some new residents imagined that it
was an opportunity for past and old res
idents to abuse new residents, and
therefore did not participate.
This is clearly an unfortunate mis
conception, and I can promise that this
communication problem will not per
sist next year. The dorm is now
painfully aware that actions, such as
permitting an environment which may
have fostered this misunderstanding,
can constitute hazing, regardless of
whether they involve only voluntary
participants and are done without

harmful intent.
My view of our dorm is that it fills
an important niche on campus. The
most important aspect of Alpha Sig is
that its members attempt to be non
judgemental.
Those who do not wish to conform to
the popular Stanford lifestyle of bury
ing one's nose in a book and running
three times a week are not driven
underground.
Just as Mason says that Alpha Sig
needs to be responsible to all members
of its community, Stanford needs to do
the same: some people, myself included,
feel alienated by Stanford's dominant
culture.
I cannot possibly describe my affec
tion for Alpha Sig in a single response,
nor can the entire dorm be accurately
represented by a few letters. These
issues are all very complex and, as they
regard Alpha Sig, I hope that in the
future they will be handled within the
house rather than through The Daily; a
structure for that does exist.
If anyone in the Stanford community
has any questions or would like to
understand my perspective as a person
who would no longer be at Stanford if
Alpha Sig did not exist, please feel free
to contact me. I hope that such dis
course will replace rumors and old sto
ries about the dorm as a means of
defining our image.
