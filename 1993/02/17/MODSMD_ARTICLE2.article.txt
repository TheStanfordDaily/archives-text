# New sound system set for Mar. 4, $7K cheaper than thought

Forty-one. That's how many
minutes Senate Chair Ron Brown
predicted last night's ASSU meet
ing would last. It went 43, but sen
ators were still out of Law School
room 190 in time to catch the
"Class of' 96" at eight o'clock.
The senators did hang around
long enough to hear that the new
stereo system in Memorial Audito
rium will cost $7,000 less than
originally expected, according to
graduate senator Sanford Dickert.
Dickert said engineers in
stalling the system discovered
that half of the proposed number
of speakers and four sound ampli
fiers were unnecessary.
The Dolby Surround Sound
system, which was approved by
the Senate in November, was pro
jected to cost the ASSU $97,500.
Dickert said the system will be in
stalled in time for the March 4
Flicks screening of "Apocalypse
Now."
"Get ready for a hell of an expe
rience," Dickert said.
Despite the unexpected savings,
the Senate denied Dickert's pro
posal that $2,600 of the reclaimed
money be diverted to fund the in
stallation of six speakers in Cub
berley Auditorium. The speakers,
which were "inadvertently" pur
chased as part of a ten year-old pro
ject to install a sound system in
Cubberley, are currently sitting
unused in Memorial Auditorium.
Dickert said that neither the
Department of Communication
— which initiated the Cubberley
project — nor Events and Services
have the money to install the
speakers themselves.
"It is a luxury," Dickert said.
"But as long as we have this extra
money, I figured it would be a
nice thing to do."
However, other senators felt
that any money saved should go
back to the ASSU's coffers.

"I'm delighted to hear the
Mem Aud system is coming in
under cost, and it seems that the
difference should come back to
the ASSU," graduate senator
Robert Lodenkamper said. "I see
this bill as saying, 'Yeah, if we
have $2,600 extra, we'll blow it.' "
Undergraduate Senator Cecilia
Tom agreed, adding, "We're not
running a business that should
fund everything the University
doesn't fund."
