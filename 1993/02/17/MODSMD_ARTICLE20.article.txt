# Israel criticism must be balanced, rational to improve discussion
## 
### 
A Jan. 26 Daily article quoted a
"Jewish supporter of Palestinians" as
stating that criticism of Israel is "muz
zled" in the U.S. — a self-serving

notion easily dispelled by a glance at
the TV networks and PBS, the New
York Times, campus forums, etc.,
where legitimate (and illegitimate) cri
tiques appear regutorly. Letters on the
next two days called attention to some,
but not all, of the errors and distor
tions reported in this article.
Now a group called "Stanford Middle
East Focus" has published a letter
(Feb. 11) calling the article "thorough

and impressive," and pointing to Israeli
complicity in the 1982 Sabra and Shati
la killings.
Why is it that such a group fails ever
to "focus" on long-standing Palestinian
terrorism and rejectionism, not to men
tion the massively murderous policies
of Syria, Iraq and other Arab countries
toward their own peoples?
Recently, for a Stanford Middle East
focus event, flyers were put up all over

campus saying: "Does Israel Have
Death Squads?" The visiting speaker,
when I questioned him, admitted that
by every recognized standard, Israel
does not — but that he'd agreed to the
flagrant title to draw an audience.
It would serve all our interests to
promote informed, balanced commen
tary on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
