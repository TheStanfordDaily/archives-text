## Thou shalt have no idols

I'M A STUDENT-ATHLETE wanna
be. I look around Stanford, and I see
Rhodes scholars, NCAA champions,
valedictorians and All-Americans. And
they're all the same people. And I wanna
be like them.
Maybe it's a California-bean-sprouts
tofu-morning-run kinda thing. Maybe it's
the whole Stanford I-can-get-good-grades
and-not-even-look-like-I'm-trying atti
tude. Maybe it's a compulsion for well
roundedness left over from high school.
I want to be able to ace my Math 103
midterm and then take someone in one
on-one. I want to win a coed soccer game
and then think of a question that the sec
tion leader can't answer.
I have tried to find that elusive academ
ic/athletic balance. The academic part is
no problem; I aced CS 001 and have
already taken Hum Sex and Sleep and
Dreams. Both times for a grade. And as for
athletics? Well, let's just say that as a self
proclaimed sports nerd, I am at one with
the Stanford sports community. Introduce
me to an athlete, and I'll already know all
their vital stats.
And I learn all that stuff because these
people are my heroes. They are the ones
who excel at the things I flounder at. I am
in awe of Glyn Milburn, Bev Oden, Sum
mer Sanders and others who are excep
tional in so many different fields. And per
haps the most attractive thing about them
is their humility, despite their greatness.

They were my heroes. That is, until my
boyhood ideals were smashed into so
many shards of lost hope, kinda like that
time me and Jim Cramer dropped a water
melon off my roof, only not as messy.
It was spring quarter last year and a
fraternity was throwing a big party.
Among other things, there was this ice
slide going down the middle of the house
courtyard. I boxed out well and took excel
lent position at the side of the slide. I
wanted a good view of the baseball team's
starting rotation as they took their turn
down the strip.
I soon realized that there was a large
man on the other side of the slide who was
barking at me. At about 6-foot-5 and 300
lbs., I recognized him immediately as a
member of the football team. He wanted
help as he crossed over the ice. I obligingly
lent a sturdy left arm for support and he
took a spot next to me. No thanks was
needed.
But the story doesn't end there. About
five minutes later, the big guy indicated
that someone was calling for me. I turned
around to see what he was talking about,
and as I did so received a solid elbow to the
back of the neck. It seems that this offen
sive guard was clearing out a space by his
side for an inebriated friend, who hap
pened to be a relief pitcher for the baseball
team.
When I weakly objected at the rude
treatment, the big guy said, "Don't fight

it, dude." Good thing. He must have
sensed that I was about to start throwing
blows.
I was stunned. Here was one of my
heroes treating one of his biggest fans like
some kind of jerk. I realize that you don't
have to be an athlete or even a fraternity
member to be a jerk. We have plenty of
those from all walks of life. But my heroes
aren't supposed to be jerks.
I think at that point I realized that I
had lost track of why I looked up to Stan
ford athletes. I was enamored of the stu
dent-athlete because, through hard work
and dedication, he or she had mastered
two completely different fields. Something
I couldn't do.
But if someone happens to have excep
tional abilities in a popular arena like ath
letics, does that make them better than
the gal down the hall who is an unbeliev
able tutor? Or the guy downstairs who is a
virtuoso violinist?
No. Just richer. But maybe that is bet
ter after all.
