## Apologies of a not-so-adamant female columnist 
### 
Readers, please divert your
attention to the upper right-hand
corner of the page, where you will
find a stunning black-and-white rendi
tion of your hostess.
Just in case you haven't been paying
attention since the beginning of the year,
I happen to be female.
Yes, female. I step into my skirt one leg
at a time just like the rest of you.
Not that I'm not psyched as hell to see
God and her sister writing in about there
being no women columnists and all, but
give me a break. No women columnists?
Do I not have enough lip gloss on or
something?
So, like Lisa Simpson trying to prove
her virginity, I must defend my feminini
ty. Want to see my membership card?
I can roar. I swear. Just give me a few
minutes to practice.
On my birth certificate it says I'm
female. I had pink Zips tennis shoes in
the sixth grade. I too made Ken and Bar
bie hump in her Dream Mansion when I
visited my more wealthy playmates.
But the in-the-back-seat-of-the-Bar
bie-'Vette thing was all Ken's idea.
Along with hordes of other doe-eyed
girls, I too was taken aside in fifth grade
to hear from Daisy Duck and the whole

Disney crew about the joys of menstrua
tion. Even though it was a bunch of
vicious lies, we sat through it all.
I was a Brownie for two weeks. Girl
Scouts' honor.
And although puberty visited a little
later than normal, my grandfather says I
even look female now. No more training
bras for me, no sir. So there.
I am not, however, a female like the
ones you'll find in Better Homes and Gar
dens. I don't care which kind of formica
will best match my gold-plated refrigera
tor handles. I could care less about the
perfect silky fondue.
Ann Landers can kiss my butt.
I spit off the people-mover at Disney
land. I play American Gladiators in the
hall, challenging unsuspecting dorm
mates without their contact lenses on to a
contest of Atlasphere at will. OK, I admit
it. I swear. I occasionally think a bad
thought or two.
A debutante I am not.
But I have been known to wear a fair
amount of makeup, shave my legs every
other day and gripe about split ends. Go
ahead, stereotype me as a member of the
Gem fan club.
I'll kick you in the crotch.
I was a tomboy as I kid. I broke win

dows, trespassed and threw
pomegranates at cars from my front yard.
I didn't give half an erector set whether
Blueberry Muffin smelled better than
Strawberry Shortcake.
Dolls were for losers.
I was never instilled with a respect of
the importance of a pristine petticoat, a
sparkling camisole or big, fat sausage
curls cascading down past my waist. The
whole bathroom/hygiene issue was too
much to handle.
It was all my mom could do to keep me
wearing a pair of shorts under my little
corduroy skirts, so I wouldn't offend the
kinder, gentler spectators as I performed
"death drops" from the high bar of the
jungle gym.
I was unbeatable at kiss chase.
And I hit junior high and high school
— those Utopian, halcyon days of peer
acceptance and the inhalation of paint
solvents — with full knowledge of the
existence of men, the "opposition."
Men were the scrawny geeks across
the row who asked you to the Prom dur
ing Physics, writing you a note in Tolkein
runes for your response. They were flirts,
jocks, jerks and nice young men with
more acne than was socially acceptable.
As harmless as two-toed sloths.

But as we hung out on "The Wall" dur
ing lunch, throwing Ding Dongs at
unsuspecting noon-duty aides, I never
turned, with a fiery spark in my eye, to
look snout-to-snout with my oppressors.
Their voices were cracking, for lord's
sake.
Plus, they couldn't get any action even
if their parents suddenly went out of
town for the next year, leaving the keys to
the Testarossa on the kitchen counter.
This is the competition? Spare me.
So I grew up without the whole man
equals-enemy idea. Not that I can't see
the points to it, just that I don't agree.
How am I supposed to? I got into Stan
ford. Donald Trump jets me out every
time Jane is away for the weekend.
And I don't get P.M.S.
Men are to beat at Tetris, to hypnotize
into a childlike stupor with my feminine
charms, to make fetch my slippers when I
am weary. I haven't always been able to
see the threat.
I do not, however, discount
feminist/female arguments about male
dominance. I would not advocate walking
across campus at 4 a.m. in stiletto heels
wearing nothing but a bib from Jose's
barbecue in Palo Alto.
But then, frostbite is an issue as well.

Women do have a right to expect to be
able to feel that they have the same free
doms, rights and opportunities as men.
Scratch where you want to, when you
want to, just like the "stronger" sex.
Maybe I'm just too oblivious to it all to let
myself succumb to this realization.
Madonna hasn't. I'm holding out 'til
the bitter end.
So I write what I write, hoping beyond
all else to get marriage proposals by the
tens, or perhaps just a nice, big dedication
in The Daily from my Sweet Baboo.
I have never looked at my vagina in a
mirror to check out just exactly what is
going on down south. But is my experi
ence any less valid as a woman's experi
ence?
Roar.

Tish Williams realizes that she is a
pathetic excuse for a feminist, but hopes
that trying to be a strong female will do.
