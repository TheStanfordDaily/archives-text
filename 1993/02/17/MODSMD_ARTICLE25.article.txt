## The 						Dish: Saving satellites, detecting enemy ships No longer just a landmark for joggers; mysteries of this icon uncovered 
### Julie Sauer 
On a clear night in the Stanford
foothills, a silvery orb glows in the sky. In
the dark, silent stillness, a glimmer of
starlight reflects off a massive metal
structure anchored firmly in the ground.
The steel and aluminum Dish meets the
mystery of the cosmos.
We are talking about the radio tele
scope, known as the Dish, located in the
Stanford foothills. Most people know lit
tle about the Dish; joggers know it as
something to run around, while others
see it from various locations and ask,
"What is that? What does it do?"
Built in 1960, the mysterious Dish
stands 158 feet high and weighs 150 tons.
During the 60s and 70s, the radio telescope
performed diverse functions from rescuing
satellites and probing pulsars to being a
national defense watchdog. And now, after
more than a decade of near hibernation, it
is entering an era of renewed use.
The Dish is a radio telescope that
receives radio waves from galaxies and
stars. These celestial objects contain enor
mous energy that is released as radio
waves, which enter the Earth's atmo
sphere. Radio telescopes like the Dish
receive these radio waves and use them to
learn about distant objects in the universe.
However, the Dish was originally born
not to study the sky, but to probe the
secrets of U.S. military foes. The Depart
ment of Defense initially commissioned
the Dish, during the 19505, as part of its
Cold War "Readiness Program."
As a result of the program, the govern
ment built large antenna and radar sites
to scan behind the Iron Curtain.
At Stanford, researchers were able to
bounce radio waves off the Earth's atmo
sphere. In a military setting, these
reflected waves could detect distant
objects like enemy ships.
The Cold War fueled U.S. national
interest in space technology as well as mil
itary technology. In response to the Soviet
Sputnik 1 success, America launched the
Pioneer space mission.
The Stanford Dish spoke to the Pio
neer spacecraft by sending radio signals,
allowing scientists on Earth to follow the
unmanned probe into space. The signals
helped chart information about solar
wind and interplanetary space.
After the initial frenzy of Cold War
stimulated technological research, winter
settled Upon theDish. It hibernated during
a period of reduced use from the late 1970s
to the early 1980s, as a result of reduced

National Science Foundation funding.
According to Michael Cousins, a senior
research engineer at SRI International,
the main reason the Dish has been idle is
because people did not have confidence
that anything worthwhile could be done
using the massive telescope.
Cousins and Ivan Linscott, a senior
research associate at Stanford's Center
for Radio Astronomy, said they are deter
mined to prove otherwise. However, a
few obstacles lie in their way.
The rapid growth in the Santa Clara
valley presents a specific obstacle — air
pollution. It is not the visible, dense cloud
of smog that harms the Dish, but rather
the invisible radio waves in the air.
Plans to use the Dish involve reducing
radio interference from communications

facilities and airports in the Silicon Val
ley. These foreign radio frequencies add
"noise" to the air, interfering with sig
nals from the Dish.
Linscott describes a solution that pin
points the frequencies of strong interfer
ence present in the air at specific times.
At these times, channels of high noise are
removed from the Dish's signal.
The signal from the Dish is woven from
radio frequencies like cloth is woven from
different colored threads. Removing the
interfering frequencies is like taking some
colored strands from the cloth. The fabric
can be woven again without these strands.
The Dish's radio signal can likewise be
resynthesized without interfering chan
nels. It can then be distinguished from
background "noise."

To test the effectiveness of this solu
tion, Linscott uses the Dish to receive sig
nals from pulsars. Pulsars are cores of
neutron stars left from supernova explo
sions.
These cores are made of neutrons
compacted to extremely high densities.
They rotate in a frictionless environ
ment, emitting radio pulses that cover a
wide frequency range over time.
The timing and frequencies of pulsar
radio signatures offer clues about the
pulsar environment. These radio signals
help reveal the nature of the interstellar
medium and how it disperses radio
waves.
Pulsar signals arrive from natural
objects in remote space, but the Dish can
also track man-made satellites orbiting

the earth.
In 1982 the Dish rescued a British
satellite whose transmitters were broken.
It fired a strong radio signal to silence the
satellite's transmitters so it could again
respond to commands from the ground.
Besides rescuing rebel satellites, the
Dish also tracks earth resource satellites
that measure atmospheric temperature
and pressure.
Plans for students to use the Dish for
research. A graduate student is already
working on a project to reduce radio inter
ference and other students are making
radio receivers.
In addition, plans are underway for a
1993-94 course in radio astronomy that
will use the Dish for observing the heav
ens, unveiling the mysteries of the skies.
