# Death in the final frontier
## Klingons, temperature, radiation cited as space hazards

Q: If you were in space without
a protective space suit, what
would kill you first: lack of oxygen,
the vacuum, the cold, or some
thing else (like solar radiation)'?
— Scott Moss

A : Before I answer, I feel com
xJipelled to point out that
you're forgetting one of the
biggest threats to an unprotected
human in outer space: the Klin
gons.
Forgetting about them for
the time being, let's think about
the problems besetting the hap
less individual who finds him
self floating through space with
out the comforts of his environ
mental suit.
Regardless of his excuse for
being caught in such a compro
mised position, asking what would
kill him first is kind of like asking,
"What if someone simultaneously
disemboweled you, set you on fire
and stuck your tongue into an
electrical socket?" If it wasn't one
thing, it would surely be another.
All of the potentially lethal
factors you mention — insuffi
cient oxygen, vacuum, low tem
peratures, intense radiation —
would be individually sufficient
to do in our unfortunate trav
eller. But if it came down to a
dead heat, my money would be
riding on the cold.
The shortage of oxygen,
while eventually lethal,
wouldn't act quickly enough to
be a real contender. Doctors
routinely save the lives of near
ly-drowned or almost-choked
people who have been deprived
of oxygen for several minutes.
Rather than the lack of oxy
gen per se, I'd be more concerned
about the absence of an atmo
sphere of any kind. Although
space is not a perfect vacuum,
it's pretty close: the pressure of
the rarefied gas that "fills" the
void between the stars is around
a hundred trillion times lower
than the atmospheric pressure
that our species has come to
know and love.

Despite this stark contrast
between interstellar and earth
optimal pressures, the hard vac
uum of space would still take sev
eral minutes to do a really thor
ough job of killing someone.
In a series of experiments
performed in the 19605, dogs
and monkeys were rapidly
decompressed from normal
pressure (760 Torr., or the
amount of pressure exerted
under Earth's gravity by a pillar
of liquid mercury 760 millime
ters tall) to less than 2 Torr.
Immediate symptoms of the
decompression included gross
swelling of the body, convulsions,
labored attempts at breathing and
generalized muscular twitching.
Unconsciousness ensued after
about 10 seconds.
Most of the unfortunate mam
mals employed in these enlight
ened endeavors, however, man
aged to survive the treatment.
After exposures to low pressures
that lasted as long as three min
utes, mortality rates among the
subjects were "only" about 15
percent, with negligible neurolog
ical damage among the survivors.
Assuming that it's safe to
extrapolate from these results,
it seems clear that the vacuum
is indeed a killer, but a relative
ly slow one, taking several min
utes before its victims even
being to die off.
But now we turn to the fastest
gun on the block: the cold. Here's
a thought experiment for you:
Remember that lecture demon
stration in which a physics profes
sor takes a rubber ball, dips it into
liquid nitrogen for a few seconds,
and then throws it against a wall?
Well, imagine taking a bath
in a big vat of that stuff. And
now consider the fact that outer

space is about 70° C colder than
the liquid nitrogen.
The situations aren't exactly
analogous: There's nothing really
in space (see the section on vacu
um above) to take the heat away
from your body, as there would
be if you were bathing in a liquid
just a few degrees above absolute
zero. But the human body, like all
bodies, radiates away heat energy
in the form of infrared and other
wavelengths of light — so-called
"blackbody radiation."
Blackbody radiation would
equilibrate your temperature to
the very cold background tem
perature of the void in a matter
of seconds. Although bacteria
are routinely revived from the
relatively balmy conditions of
liquid-nitrogen freezers, higher
organisms have a lot more trou
ble coping with being frozen: Ice
crysttds expand in every nook
and cranny of the body, ripping
up cells and dimming the
prospects for recovery upon
thawing.
I should mention that there
are other possible fates for an
inappropriately clad spacefarer:
For example, you could follow in
the footsteps of the Mariner 4
Mars probe and get hit by a show
er of micrometeorites. This would
kill you instantaneously, even
faster than freezing, but it's not
really as general a fate as freezing.
And then, of course, there's
the Klingons.

Picard would kick the tar out of

mised position, asking what would
kill him first is kind of like asking,
"What if someone simultaneously
disemboweled you, set you on fire
and stuck your tongue into an
electrical socket?" If it wasn't one
thing, it would surely be another.
All of the potentially lethal
factors you mention — insuffi
cient oxygen, vacuum, low tem
peratures, intense radiation —
would be individually sufficient
to do in our unfortunate trav
eller. But if it came down to a
dead heat, my money would be
riding on the cold.
The shortage of oxygen,
while eventually lethal,
wouldn't act quickly enough to
be a real contender. Doctors
routinely save the lives of near
ly-drowned or almost-choked
people who have been deprived
of oxygen for several minutes.
Rather than the lack of oxy
gen per se, I'd be more concerned
about the absence of an atmo
sphere of any kind. Although
space is not a perfect vacuum,
it's pretty close: the pressure of
the rarefied gas that "fills" the
void between the stars is around
a hundred trillion times lower
than the atmospheric pressure
that our species has come to
know and love.

Despite this stark contrast
between interstellar and earth
optimal pressures, the hard vac
uum of space would still take sev
eral minutes to do a really thor
ough job of killing someone.
In a series of experiments
performed in the 19605, dogs
and monkeys were rapidly
decompressed from normal
pressure (760 Torr., or the
amount of pressure exerted
under Earth's gravity by a pillar
of liquid mercury 760 millime
ters tall) to less than 2 Torr.
Immediate symptoms of the
decompression included gross
swelling of the body, convulsions,
labored attempts at breathing and
generalized muscular twitching.
Unconsciousness ensued after
about 10 seconds.
Most of the unfortunate mam
mals employed in these enlight
ened endeavors, however, man
aged to survive the treatment.
After exposures to low pressures
that lasted as long as three min
utes, mortality rates among the
subjects were "only" about 15
percent, with negligible neurolog
ical damage among the survivors.
Assuming that it's safe to
extrapolate from these results,
it seems clear that the vacuum
is indeed a killer, but a relative
ly slow one, taking several min
utes before its victims even
being to die off.
But now we turn to the fastest
gun on the block: the cold. Here's
a thought experiment for you:
Remember that lecture demon
stration in which a physics profes
sor takes a rubber ball, dips it into
liquid nitrogen for a few seconds,
and then throws it against a wall?
Well, imagine taking a bath
in a big vat of that stuff. And
now consider the fact that outer

space is about 70° C colder than
the liquid nitrogen.
The situations aren't exactly
analogous: There's nothing really
in space (see the section on vacu
um above) to take the heat away
from your body, as there would
be if you were bathing in a liquid
just a few degrees above absolute
zero. But the human body, like all
bodies, radiates away heat energy
in the form of infrared and other
wavelengths of light — so-called
"blackbody radiation."
Blackbody radiation would
equilibrate your temperature to
the very cold background tem
perature of the void in a matter
of seconds. Although bacteria
are routinely revived from the
relatively balmy conditions of
liquid-nitrogen freezers, higher
organisms have a lot more trou
ble coping with being frozen: Ice
crysttds expand in every nook
and cranny of the body, ripping
up cells and dimming the
prospects for recovery upon
thawing.
I should mention that there
are other possible fates for an
inappropriately clad spacefarer:
For example, you could follow in
the footsteps of the Mariner 4
Mars probe and get hit by a show
er of micrometeorites. This would
kill you instantaneously, even
faster than freezing, but it's not
really as general a fate as freezing.
And then, of course, there's
the Klingons.
