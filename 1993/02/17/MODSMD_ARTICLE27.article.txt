# Doctors suggest stretching, good shoes to prevent injuries
## Ways to stop sports injuries 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
"Injuries — hah! Nev'r had one.
Ha. Ha. Who needs stretching?"
Those "super-athletes" — people
who never stretch, keep running
and exercising while everyone else's
legs are falling off — run the same
risk as everyone else when it comes
to sports injuries, say doctors.
According to Tim Bowman, a
physical therapist at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, paying prop
er attention to conditioning and
your body's signals is necessary to
keep (or get) in good shape. As
part of this, it is important to
know the facts about injuries,
their causes, treatments and pre
vention.
Injuries
Sports-related injuries like
torn ligaments, tendonitis and
knee problems are caused primar
ily by overuse of muscles or liga
ments. Injuries can result from
over-stretching, poorly condi
tioned muscles, as is common
with many beginning exercisers,
or from overusing well-condi
tioned muscles.
Tendonitis is overuse of the
tendons. A tendon is the end of a
muscle and stretches over a joint.
When it is used too much, the
result is similar to what happens
when a rope is pulled back and
forth over a rock — friction and
tearing.
This action in tendons results
in little tears in the tendon tissue
which bleed and lead to swelling.
In addition, damaged cells leak
out fluid into the tendon sheath,
causing inflammation. "Tennis
elbow" and "swimmer's shoul
ders" are classic cases of ten
donitis.
"Pulled muscles" are actually
muscles that have developed
microscopic tears inside the tis
sue from being excessively
stretched. Often this is accompa
nied by inflammation and pain.
Commonly pulled muscles are
the calf, the hamstring and
shoulder muscles.
"Shin splints" are one of the
most common muscle injuries —
occurring in people who run fre
quently. They are the result of a
lack of support when the foot
makes contact with the ground.

The foot hits with an impact of
four to five times the runner's
body weight. To absorb this
impact, the foot pronates, or rolls
towards the arch. Hyperprona
tion occurs when the foot rolls too
much into the arch, putting the
tibia bone and surrounding shin
muscles under great stress —
resulting in shin splints.
Injuries to ligaments are also
common in very active people and
are the result of a one-time
impact injury, not overuse. Liga
ments are the body's supportive
tissues; like the plastic that holds
a six-pack together, they offer
support and stability.

However, like plastic, if they
are pulled out of shape, they can
not return to their original shape.
For this reason, torn ligaments
are often more serious than
strained muscles.
Skiing accidents and direct hits
received in football — often
resulting in torn knee ligaments
— are common examples which
require surgery to bring the con
nective tissue pieces back togeth
er.
Stress fractures are another
common injury. These are hair
like cracks that develop in bones
continually put under great
stress.
Stress fractures, although very
small, often take longer to heal
than broken bones. This is a prob
lem for the injured party who
often feels no pain and assumes
that the fractures have healed.
Treatments — hot or cold?
According to Bowman, when in
doubt about whether to apply
heat or ice to an inflamed iryury,
your safest bet is to apply ice. Ice
acts as a vasoconstrictor —
decreases the blood flow to the
area —which decreases the inter
nal bleeding and swelling.
In general, the more swelling,

the more healing needed. The
cold temperature lowers the
metabolism of the surrounding
cells so that they require a lower
blood supply, which helps mini
mize swelling.
Heat accelerates the healing
process. It vasodilates — opens
blood vessels — allowing greater
blood flow to the area of applica
tion. The increased circulation to
the area helps remove dead cells
and excess fluid associated with
inflammation, allowing the heal
ing processes to begin.
The "RICE" treatment
The "RICE" treatment, sup
ported by Bowman, includes rest,
ice, compression and elevation.
Rest. This refers to giving
muscles and tissues some time to
recover. Doing the same activity
every day (such as running) is
generally not recommended.
Cross training — alternating
between several types of work
outs — is a good way to use sever
al different muscles and prevent
exhaustion to any one muscle.
Ice. Bowman recommends
icing for at least 20 minutes, as
soon as pain starts. If a muscle
requires ice, it is probably a good
idea to give it a few days rest.
Compression. The use of an
Ace bandage, like ice, acts as a
vasoconstrictor and shuts down
blood flow to the area to minimize
swelling.
Elevation. Elevating the
injured area uses gravity to help
the body drain off some of the flu
ids resulting from inflammation.
With proper training and con
ditioning, most of these injuries
can be prevented.
Slow stretching, optimally
five to 10 minutes before and
after working out, will help pre
vent cramping and overexten
sion of muscles. Also, supportive
and absorptive shoes will help to
prevent other injuries.
Finally, Bowman recommends
a gradual and realistic plan of
exercise for beginners. Start out
slow and move towards higher
goals only after you have given
your body time to build up
endurance.
By avoiding doing "too much,
too soon" many injuries can be
prevented.

and excess fluid associated with
inflammation, allowing the heal
ing processes to begin.
The "RICE" treatment
The "RICE" treatment, sup
ported by Bowman, includes rest,
ice, compression and elevation.
Rest. This refers to giving
muscles and tissues some time to
recover. Doing the same activity
every day (such as running) is
generally not recommended.
Cross training — alternating
between several types of work
outs — is a good way to use sever
al different muscles and prevent
exhaustion to any one muscle.
Ice. Bowman recommends
icing for at least 20 minutes, as
soon as pain starts. If a muscle
requires ice, it is probably a good
idea to give it a few days rest.
Compression. The use of an
Ace bandage, like ice, acts as a
vasoconstrictor and shuts down
blood flow to the area to minimize
swelling.
Elevation. Elevating the
injured area uses gravity to help
the body drain off some of the flu
ids resulting from inflammation.
With proper training and con
ditioning, most of these injuries
can be prevented.
Slow stretching, optimally
five to 10 minutes before and
after working out, will help pre
vent cramping and overexten
sion of muscles. Also, supportive
and absorptive shoes will help to
prevent other injuries.
Finally, Bowman recommends
a gradual and realistic plan of
exercise for beginners. Start out
slow and move towards higher
goals only after you have given
your body time to build up
endurance.
By avoiding doing "too much,
too soon" many injuries can be
prevented.

"Injuries — hah! Nev'r had one.
Ha. Ha. Who needs stretching?"
Those "super-athletes" — people
who never stretch, keep running
and exercising while everyone else's
legs are falling off — run the same
risk as everyone else when it comes
to sports injuries, say doctors.
According to Tim Bowman, a
physical therapist at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, paying prop
er attention to conditioning and
your body's signals is necessary to
keep (or get) in good shape. As
part of this, it is important to
know the facts about injuries,
their causes, treatments and pre
vention.
Injuries
Sports-related injuries like
torn ligaments, tendonitis and
knee problems are caused primar
ily by overuse of muscles or liga
ments. Injuries can result from
over-stretching, poorly condi
tioned muscles, as is common
with many beginning exercisers,
or from overusing well-condi
tioned muscles.
Tendonitis is overuse of the
tendons. A tendon is the end of a
muscle and stretches over a joint.
When it is used too much, the
result is similar to what happens
when a rope is pulled back and
forth over a rock — friction and
tearing.
This action in tendons results
in little tears in the tendon tissue
which bleed and lead to swelling.
In addition, damaged cells leak
out fluid into the tendon sheath,
causing inflammation. "Tennis
elbow" and "swimmer's shoul
ders" are classic cases of ten
donitis.
"Pulled muscles" are actually
muscles that have developed
microscopic tears inside the tis
sue from being excessively
stretched. Often this is accompa
nied by inflammation and pain.
Commonly pulled muscles are
the calf, the hamstring and
shoulder muscles.
"Shin splints" are one of the
most common muscle injuries —
occurring in people who run fre
quently. They are the result of a
lack of support when the foot
makes contact with the ground.

The foot hits with an impact of
four to five times the runner's
body weight. To absorb this
impact, the foot pronates, or rolls
towards the arch. Hyperprona
tion occurs when the foot rolls too
much into the arch, putting the
tibia bone and surrounding shin
muscles under great stress —
resulting in shin splints.
Injuries to ligaments are also
common in very active people and
are the result of a one-time
impact injury, not overuse. Liga
ments are the body's supportive
tissues; like the plastic that holds
a six-pack together, they offer
support and stability.

However, like plastic, if they
are pulled out of shape, they can
not return to their original shape.
For this reason, torn ligaments
are often more serious than
strained muscles.
Skiing accidents and direct hits
received in football — often
resulting in torn knee ligaments
— are common examples which
require surgery to bring the con
nective tissue pieces back togeth
er.
Stress fractures are another
common injury. These are hair
like cracks that develop in bones
continually put under great
stress.
Stress fractures, although very
small, often take longer to heal
than broken bones. This is a prob
lem for the injured party who
often feels no pain and assumes
that the fractures have healed.
Treatments — hot or cold?
According to Bowman, when in
doubt about whether to apply
heat or ice to an inflamed iryury,
your safest bet is to apply ice. Ice
acts as a vasoconstrictor —
decreases the blood flow to the
area —which decreases the inter
nal bleeding and swelling.
In general, the more swelling,

the more healing needed. The
cold temperature lowers the
metabolism of the surrounding
cells so that they require a lower
blood supply, which helps mini
mize swelling.
Heat accelerates the healing
process. It vasodilates — opens
blood vessels — allowing greater
blood flow to the area of applica
tion. The increased circulation to
the area helps remove dead cells
and excess fluid associated with
inflammation, allowing the heal
ing processes to begin.
