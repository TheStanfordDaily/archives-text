## Hudepohl brings golden outlook to swimming 
### Kay Hong Staff writer 
Branner does not suck. And
neither does food service. Mis
guided interpretations from a
brainwashed freshman? Frosh
swimming sensation Joe Hude
pohl doesn't think so. Neither the
omnipresent perkiness of Bran
ner Hall nor the indigestible Stan
ford slop has slowed this power
house freestyler down one bit.
During his first year with the
Stanford men's swim team, Hude
pohl has proven to be an extraor
dinary asset for the Cardinal —
and a delight for the statistician
at deGuerre Pool. During the Car
dinal double-header against USC
and UCLA two weeks ago, Hude
pohl went undefeated against the
competition and broke three pool
records, including the oldest in
the pool's books.
Hudepohl began swimming
lessons with his brother and three
sisters for safety reasons, as his
parents owned a summer home
on a river near Cincinnati. "My
swim instructor asked if I wanted
to join the swim team, but I said
'No,' " Hudepohl recalled. "Then
one day I came home and said I
wanted to swim. No one knew
why."
Soon after, Hudepohl began
competing with the YMCA. After
five years he moved on to train
with the Cincinnati Marlins and
posted Junior National qualifying
times as a 13-year-old. But it
wasn't until his freshman year in
high school, after phasing out
baseball, soccer and basketball,
that Hudepohl decided to commit
to swimming.

That commitment led to a spot
on the 1992 Olympic squad. As
the only high school swimmer on
the United States men's team,
Hudepohl impressed the swim
ming world in Barcelona by earn
ing a gold medal in the 4 X 100
meter freestyle relay and a bronze
in the 4 x 200 free relay. But
Hudepohl decided that two
medals were not enough. "I won
those medals with a relay team,"
Hudepohl said. "Now I want to go
back and win an individual event.
That's something you always
dream of."
Hudepohl competed in one
individual event in Barcelona and
posted a remarkable fifth place
finish in the 200 free. His individ
ual performance, as well as his
splits on both relays, managed to
elicit groans of dismay from colle
giate swim coaches across the
country, as the 4.0 student from
St. Xavier High School had
already decided to come to Stan
ford.
"When I made that phone call
to find out his decision, I think it
was one of the most nervous times
of my life," said Cardinal coach
Skip Kenney. "I let out this huge
'yahoo' that I'm sure he could
hear clear over in Cincinnati — it
was just so exciting. It's not that
often that someone like him
comes along, especially in our
sport."
Hudepohl credits his current
teammates for inspiring him to
hop on board the Cardinal pro
gram. "I love the team," Hude
pohl said. "Academics were really
important to me and I had nar
rowed it down to five schools that
I thought had both good aca

demies and good swim programs.
When I came out here, the guys
were just great."
So far, the Cardinal swim team
seems to have suited Hudepohl's
talents just fine. "Joe was in the
difficult role of coming in here with
high expectations," Kenney said.
"Even with those kinds of expecta
tions, he's exceeded them. Our big
goal with him was to have him
swim faster than he ever has before
during [the training part of] the
season. He's already done that."
The real question in everyone's
mind seems to be: exactly how far
can this kid go? "It's difficult to say,
because I've never been with him
through a shaved season," Kenney
answered, in reference to the end of
the season when swimmers rest
and then shave their bodies. "He'll
be going into Pac-lOs unshaved —
there're maybe four or five kids in
the conference who can do that....
Coaches are already asking, 'How
many NCAA titles can he win?'
That's a tough question to tack on
to a freshman's back."
Even with all his aquatic accom
plishments, Hudepohl is still reluc
tant to define himself primarily as
a swimmer. "I still don't think of
myself like that," Hudepohl said.
"I never followed swimming as a

sport — I never had any idols as a
kid. None of my friends in high
school were swimmers. One thing
I like about Stanford is that you
don't room with other athletes. I
get to learn other stuff from other
kinds of people — I'm not just

hanging around swimming."
Hudepohl even includes food
service in his overwhelmingly
thumbs-up review of the Stanford
frosh experience. "It's not bad —
I've had worse . .Hudepohl
said, while admitting that the

abundance of Cocoa Krispies at
Branner may have slightly
skewed his vote. And as for the
ever-present campus question,
does Branner suck? Hudepohl
responds with an emphatic, "No
way. I'm having a lot of fun."

demies and good swim programs.
When I came out here, the guys
were just great."
So far, the Cardinal swim team
seems to have suited Hudepohl's
talents just fine. "Joe was in the
difficult role of coming in here with
high expectations," Kenney said.
"Even with those kinds of expecta
tions, he's exceeded them. Our big
goal with him was to have him
swim faster than he ever has before
during [the training part of] the
season. He's already done that."
The real question in everyone's
mind seems to be: exactly how far
can this kid go? "It's difficult to say,
because I've never been with him
through a shaved season," Kenney
answered, in reference to the end of
the season when swimmers rest
and then shave their bodies. "He'll
be going into Pac-lOs unshaved —
there're maybe four or five kids in
the conference who can do that....
Coaches are already asking, 'How
many NCAA titles can he win?'
That's a tough question to tack on
to a freshman's back."
Even with all his aquatic accom
plishments, Hudepohl is still reluc
tant to define himself primarily as
a swimmer. "I still don't think of
myself like that," Hudepohl said.
"I never followed swimming as a

sport — I never had any idols as a
kid. None of my friends in high
school were swimmers. One thing
I like about Stanford is that you
don't room with other athletes. I
get to learn other stuff from other
kinds of people — I'm not just

hanging around swimming."
Hudepohl even includes food
service in his overwhelmingly
thumbs-up review of the Stanford
frosh experience. "It's not bad —
I've had worse . .Hudepohl
said, while admitting that the

abundance of Cocoa Krispies at
Branner may have slightly
skewed his vote. And as for the
ever-present campus question,
does Branner suck? Hudepohl
responds with an emphatic, "No
way. I'm having a lot of fun."

Joe Hudepohl has had much to smile about in the last year. After graduating from high school in Cincin
nati, he took two medals at the Barcelona Olympics before making an immediate impact on the Stanford
men's swim team.
Branner does not suck. And
neither does food service. Mis
guided interpretations from a
brainwashed freshman? Frosh
swimming sensation Joe Hude
pohl doesn't think so. Neither the
omnipresent perkiness of Bran
ner Hall nor the indigestible Stan
ford slop has slowed this power
house freestyler down one bit.
During his first year with the
Stanford men's swim team, Hude
pohl has proven to be an extraor
dinary asset for the Cardinal —
and a delight for the statistician
at deGuerre Pool. During the Car
dinal double-header against USC
and UCLA two weeks ago, Hude
pohl went undefeated against the
competition and broke three pool
records, including the oldest in
the pool's books.
Hudepohl began swimming
lessons with his brother and three
sisters for safety reasons, as his
parents owned a summer home
on a river near Cincinnati. "My
swim instructor asked if I wanted
to join the swim team, but I said
'No,' " Hudepohl recalled. "Then
one day I came home and said I
wanted to swim. No one knew
why."
Soon after, Hudepohl began
competing with the YMCA. After
five years he moved on to train
with the Cincinnati Marlins and
posted Junior National qualifying
times as a 13-year-old. But it
wasn't until his freshman year in
high school, after phasing out
baseball, soccer and basketball,
that Hudepohl decided to commit
to swimming.

That commitment led to a spot
on the 1992 Olympic squad. As
the only high school swimmer on
the United States men's team,
Hudepohl impressed the swim
ming world in Barcelona by earn
ing a gold medal in the 4 X 100
meter freestyle relay and a bronze
in the 4 x 200 free relay. But
Hudepohl decided that two
medals were not enough. "I won
those medals with a relay team,"
Hudepohl said. "Now I want to go
back and win an individual event.
That's something you always
dream of."
Hudepohl competed in one
individual event in Barcelona and
posted a remarkable fifth place
finish in the 200 free. His individ
ual performance, as well as his
splits on both relays, managed to
elicit groans of dismay from colle
giate swim coaches across the
country, as the 4.0 student from
St. Xavier High School had
already decided to come to Stan
ford.
"When I made that phone call
to find out his decision, I think it
was one of the most nervous times
of my life," said Cardinal coach
Skip Kenney. "I let out this huge
'yahoo' that I'm sure he could
hear clear over in Cincinnati — it
was just so exciting. It's not that
often that someone like him
comes along, especially in our
sport."
Hudepohl credits his current
teammates for inspiring him to
hop on board the Cardinal pro
gram. "I love the team," Hude
pohl said. "Academics were really
important to me and I had nar
rowed it down to five schools that
