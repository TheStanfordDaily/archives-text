# Netters quell Rebels
## Cardinal continues perfect play in 9-0 rout 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's teniristeam is
riding a seven-match winning streak and
playing so well that even Agassi can't
touch them.
Suzi, that is.
However, it's likely that even Suzi
Agassi's famous brother Andre would
have had a tough time with the Cardinal
yesterday afternoon. Stanford ran all over
Nevada-Las Vegas at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, blanking the Runnin' Rebels
with a 9-0 score and bringing its set record
to an incredible 126-2 on the season.
"I'm very happy with the perfor
mance we've been getting," said Cardi
nal coach Frank Brennan. "They're
feisty â€” they beat UOP and Irvine, so
they're pretty solid."
Senior captain Heather Willens
moved up to the No. 1 spot against
UNLV, filling in for junior Laxmi
Poruri, who is resting for this weekend's
matches. Willens had no problem
against Becky Markosian, winning on
center court in straight sets, 6-0, 6-1.
Redshirt freshman Kim Shasby, playing
in the No. 2 match, also had an easy time
against Rachel Clark, winning 6-1, 6-0.
"Heather and Shasby were awe
some," Brennan said. "They were con
sistent all through the match."

In the No. 3 match, freshman Beth
Berris disposed of Shiera Stuart, 6-3, 6-
3, while sophomore Amy Chiminello
overcame a difficult first set to take her
No. 4 match, 7-5, 6-1, over Agassi.
"Amy had problems with her early on,
but I was surprised to see that she pulled
out the first set," Brennan said. "She
finished strong and took the match, and
that's what matters."
Junior Emma Woodhouse won in the
No. 5 position, defeating Janelle Barr, 6-0,
6-1, and freshman Wendy Sacks survived a
three-setter to post a 1-6,6-1,6-1 win over
the unpronounceable Liilionia Kordic.
"[Kordic] was a very decent player,"
Brennan said. "Wendy just wasn't
patient in the beginning, and the other
girl had her running up and down the
court. After the first set, she played
smarter and kept the pressure on."
Berris and junior Kristine Kurth, play
ing in the No. 1 doubles slot, topped
UNLVs team of Stuart and Barr, 6-1,6-4,
while Chiminello and Shasby blew by Clark
and Agassi in the No. 2 match, 6-0, 6-1.
Freshman Sonya Cotero and Sacks round
ed out the doubles scoring for the Cardinal,
downing Markosian and Kordic, 6-3, 6-4.
Stanford travels to the Valley of the
Sun to resume its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule this weekend, when it faces No.
8 Arizona State in Tempe on Friday and
No. 12 Arizona in Tucson on Saturday.
