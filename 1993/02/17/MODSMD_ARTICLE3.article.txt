# Out in the cold:
## 2 Mirrielees residents evicted due to asbestos 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
When senior Lorelei Ritchie
went to work last Wednesday, she
thought it would be nice to wear
her pink floral dress and white
flats. What she didn't know is that
she would be wearing them for the
next two weeks.
Ritchie and her roommate, se
nior Larisse Lee, returned to their
Mirrielees apartment last week to
find their door deadbolted. A note
on the door from Housing Facili
ties asked them to remove them
selves from their place of resi
dence because of "health and safe
ty hazards," which they later
learned was an asbestos leak in
their ceiling.

Marty Keller, manager of hous
ing projects for the University,
said the asbestos problem was
found in the Mirrielees room while
the University was filling out a fix
it form.
The asbestos, Keller said, was
loosened from the "cottage
cheese" ceiling by a plywood di
vider which Ritchie and Lee had
installed in the room earlier this
year.
Keller said that numerous
warnings — both in the housing
agreement and memos distributed
during the year — were given to
Mirrielees residents about the as
bestos in the ceiling and the dan
ger accompanying the dividers.
Ritchie and Lee, however, said
they were not informed of the
danger, and that partitions like
the one they put up are common
in Mirrielees apartments.
"The ceilings are lined with
holes where partitions have been
inserted in the past," Ritchie said.
"Of course, if we — or, surely, if
past residents — had known
about the asbestos and its poten
tial dangers, we would not have
put up that partition."
Concerned that their clothes
would be unsafe due to the flaking
of the ceiling, the University is
considering whether to return
them or throw them away.
Officials at Housing and Food
Service met at noon yesterday to
decide the fate of Ritchie and
Lee's clothing, including the pos
sibility of monetary compensation
for the two women. But a firm
decision on what will happen to

the clothes has yet to be made. "I
think it's a little bit of a gray area
because we've warned them not
to mess with the stuff," Keller
said.
The rest of the women's items
were packed in boxes and
returned to them late last week.
While the University considers
the future of their clothing,
Ritchie and Lee have had to
improvise outfits, borrowing
clothes from friends and members
of their new home, Branner Hall,
where the University has tem
porarily housed them in an
unused guest room.
Lee, who is the residence com
puter coordinator for Mirrielees,
said the move has been traumatic
in more ways than just stifling
her ability to accessorize.
"It's very disconcerting and
distracting to worry about basic
things like food and clothing
when, as students, we should be
concentrating on our studies,"
she said.
According to Keller, the Mir

rielees apartment should be
asbestos-scoured, cleaned and
repainted by late next week — a
process he estimates that will cost
the University somewhere
between $5,000 and $10,000.
After last week's incident, the
University distributed a survey to
the other Mirrielees residents to
determine if they also have flak
ing asbestos in their ceilings.
And Keller said that although
the health risk from short-term
asbestos exposure, like the type
Ritchie and Lee experienced, is
not very serious, the University
plans to eventually remove all the
asbestos from the Mirrielees ceil
ings.
Meanwhile, although
wardrobe-limited, the asbestos
fugitives said that their life in
Branner has been relatively pleas
ant.
"I love living in Branner,"
Ritchie said. "I've always wanted
to live in Branner. And here as a
senior I thought I was never going
to get that chance."
