# A 						weighty issue — what's that smell?
## 
### 
At the beginning of the
year, I determined that I was
going to become big and strong.
Not that I already wasn't. But bigger. I
was striving for noticeable change.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and I have sim
ilar-sounding last names. In fact, many of
my friends called me by his last name —
and this was before the weightlifting
began. I wanted us to be similar in appear
ance also. My goal was bulging muscles,
the babes, marrying a television newscast
er, the works: "Arnold Schwarzenegger,
David Schwartz — what's the difference?"
is what I longed to hear.
But alas, it was not to be. Though I
toiled constantly throughout the fall in
Encina Gym, giving up my lunch hour
to lift heavy objects, I made significant
strides, yet not of the sort where people
other than my parents would say "Look
at those muscles!" I did increase my
muscle mass, but did not have large
gains in the all-important "pecs"
department. Thus, I could still not justi
fy wearing a tanktop in public.
I did, however, become adjusted to
the culture of Encina itself. When you
walk in, you are immediately engulfed
by The Smell. Once you go into Encina,
a shower is mandatory whether you
work out or not. It's the kind of smell
that if you bottled it up and opened the
bottle 20 years later, it would most cer
tainly have deteriorated with age. After
all, that's where The Smell comes from.
The sweat from many years of Stanford
students expending themselves over
dumbbells and free weights lingers in
your nostrils upon entry.

The good thing about Encina is that
you know your purpose as soon as you
walk into the place. This isn't a fashion
show where you look everyone over and
perhaps do some curls. When you get to
Encina, it's time to work. However,
there are several distractions that can
be detrimental to your performance:
• Disco Man: This individual feels that
he is beyond any of those aerobics classes
taught in the Ford Center, so he con
ducts his own. Replete with long curly
hair, tie-dye shirts and skimpy shorts,
Disco Man wears a Walkman to block out
the music playing on the gym stereo in
order to dance to his own beat. The beau
ty of Disco Man is that he could do these
aerobics at home in private, but chooses
to come to Encina to display his talents
for all. If Encina was a circus, he'd be
worth the price of admission. Just make
sure that if you are on the bench press,
Disco Man is not in your sight, because
laughing could prove painful.
• The F-ck Drugs guy: A regular at
Encina, the man has the build of a prize
fighter and paces the gym. In fact, he is a
boxer, having participated in his first pro
fight a few weeks ago. Every day, he

wears a different cutoff T-Shirt expound
ing a more vivid expression of Nancy Rea
gan's "Just Say No" slogan.
• The Oakland Raiders offensive line:
This threesome arrives at about 12:15
p.m. on alternate days in order to make
everyone else seem really weak. Clad in
skin tight T-shirts that <bar«ly contain
their large frames and wide-body jeans,
they warm up with two plates on each
side of the bar, and for his max one of
them slaps on a four-pack.
Nevertheless, I have persevered, regu
larly doing battle within the man-made
torture chamber. The problem still
exists, however, in the area of external
physique. Several people, myself includ
ed, labor regularly to no end, getting
stronger but without acknowledgement
from others, especially the ladies. Mean
while, those who are naturally big can
rest on their laurels and still be bigger.
This is discrimination, pure and simple!
We're fighting it, but nature has placed
an obstacle in our path.
This quarter, I have minimized the dis
traction factor by taking the Intermediate
Weightlifting class. In this class, every
one's a former high school athlete trying
to relive their past glory. Maybe, just
maybe, I will finally be extremely huge. Ch
at least try to be. Well, maybe not.
The irony of this is, none of it has
changed the fact that I can still kick my
sister's butt in thumb wrestling.

The characters represented in David
Schwartz's column are real, not fiction
al, and those who think otherwise may
experience them at their own risk.
