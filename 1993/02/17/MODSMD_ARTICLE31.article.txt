# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
On what was a hugely successful holiday
weekend for Stanford sports that aren't
played between two baskets, two competitors
— Dave Goss of the men's volleyball team and
Hillary Anderson of the women's gymnastics
team — came up particularly big in catalyzing
their squads to victory. For these gamebreak
ing efforts, Goss and Anderson have earned
The Daily's Athletes of the Week honors.

Goss, a senior opposite hitter from Santa
Barbara, put up numbers that only Michael
Jordan lovers could truly appreciate in the
Cardinal's wins over USC and Long Beach
State. In all, Goss' dominance — 28 kills
against the Trojans on Saturday and 42
against the 49ers on Sunday — added up to
70 kills in seven games, the rough equivalent
of 40 points per game in basketball.
While his teammates untied a 5-5 game
one deadlock en route to an easy sweep of
lOth-ranked USC, Goss enjoyed his best
match of the season to date as the No. 3 Car
dinal was extended to four games by seventh
ranked Long Beach State. With all eyes on the
49ers' Brent Hilliard — the 1992 NCAA Play
er of the Year — Goss emerged from the
match as the brightest star on the court, tal
lying 13 more kills than his opponent to go
along with 11 digs, six blocks and two aces.
Perhaps Goss' brilliance Sunday could be
summarized by one play in game three. With
Stanford clinging to a narrow 6-5 advantage
in a 1-1 match, Goss used a spike-dig-block
combination to bring the Burnham Pavilion
crowd to its feet and swing momentum in
the Cardinal's favor for good.

Anderson, a freshman who hails from
West Granby, Conn., was called upon to take
over as the Cardinal's top all-arounder Fri
day, with an injured Jen 6 Elzie seeing limit
ed action. Take over is exactly what Ander
son did, as she tallied a team-high 38.25 on
the vault, uneven bars, balance beam and

floor exercise in Stanford's 189.30-187.60
pasting of Cal State-Fullerton.
With the Cardinal trailing after two rota
tions, Anderson stepped up her performance,
establishing the second school record of her
young career, a remarkable 9.85 on the beam.
A season-best 9.80 on the floor in the final
rotation then sparked a furious Cardinal rally
that put the Titans away and avenged last
month's defeat in Southern California.
