# Cardinal hoops woes: will streak continue?
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With only eight games remain
ing on the team's schedule, the
ledger for Stanford men's basket
ball does not get any easier. In the
midst of a nine-game losing streak,
the Cardinal squad will have to dig
deep within itself to break the
trend while entertaining the Los
Angeles schools this weekend.
While both UCLA and USC are
in the thick of the hunt to secure
NCAA Tournament bids, Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery is
reluctant to have his team take on
the role of spoiler.
"Our job isn't necessarily to be a
spoiler, we're just trying to be good
enough to win a basketball game,"
Montgomery said. "Winning is the
only way you can validate the effort
that you're putting in."
Validation was nowhere in sight
three days ago, when California
stomped the Cardinal by 25 points
in Maples Pavilion. After competi
tive games against the Los Angeles
schools on the road and the Wash
ington schools at home, the Arizona
roadtrip marked a significant turn
for the worse which continued last
Sunday against the Golden Bears.
"At one point we were talking

about being competitive every game
but then the roof fell in with the Ari
zona-Arizona State-Cal deal,"
Montgomery said. "Our concern is
trying to stay positive and have
some fun competing in athletics."
The loss to Cal also had an
additional unfortunate stamp, sig
nifying Montgomery's first-ever
losing season as a head coach.
"I have had a long time to get
used to the fact that it was going
to happen," Montgomery said. "It
doesn't have much bearing. I just
won't be able to say I've never
had a losing season. But much of
the satisfaction from coaching is
knowing you've done the best
with what you've got, and many
times you won't have as good of a
deck as someone else."
A chance for change will come
starting Thursday night when
Stanford (6-16, 1-9 Pacific 10
Conference) hosts UCLA (16-7, 6-
5). In the first meeting between
the two schools in Jan., the Bru
ins scored a 84-76 victory.
