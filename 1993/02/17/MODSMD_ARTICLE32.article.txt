# Cardinal hoops woes: will streak continue?
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With only eight games remain
ing on the team's schedule, the
ledger for Stanford men's basket
ball does not get any easier. In the
midst of a nine-game losing streak,
the Cardinal squad will have to dig
deep within itself to break the
trend while entertaining the Los
Angeles schools this weekend.
While both UCLA and USC are
in the thick of the hunt to secure
NCAA Tournament bids, Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery is
reluctant to have his team take on
the role of spoiler.
"Our job isn't necessarily to be a
spoiler, we're just trying to be good
enough to win a basketball game,"
Montgomery said. "Winning is the
only way you can validate the effort
that you're putting in."
Validation was nowhere in sight
three days ago, when California
stomped the Cardinal by 25 points
in Maples Pavilion. After competi
tive games against the Los Angeles
schools on the road and the Wash
ington schools at home, the Arizona
roadtrip marked a significant turn
for the worse which continued last
Sunday against the Golden Bears.
"At one point we were talking

about being competitive every game
but then the roof fell in with the Ari
zona-Arizona State-Cal deal,"
Montgomery said. "Our concern is
trying to stay positive and have
some fun competing in athletics."
The loss to Cal also had an
additional unfortunate stamp, sig
nifying Montgomery's first-ever
losing season as a head coach.
"I have had a long time to get
used to the fact that it was going
to happen," Montgomery said. "It
doesn't have much bearing. I just
won't be able to say I've never
had a losing season. But much of
the satisfaction from coaching is
knowing you've done the best
with what you've got, and many
times you won't have as good of a
deck as someone else."
A chance for change will come
starting Thursday night when
Stanford (6-16, 1-9 Pacific 10
Conference) hosts UCLA (16-7, 6-
5). In the first meeting between
the two schools in Jan., the Bru
ins scored a 84-76 victory.
Reserve Kevin Dempsey hit four
three-pointers to save UCLA as
the Cardinal gave the Bruins a
scare in Pauley Pavilion, with
Stanford freshman guard Dion
Cross scoring 18 points off the
bench. In that game, UCLA was
partly looking ahead to its
matchup with Cal, and the same
pretense will be existent Thurs
day — perhaps more so, with the
Bruins seeking to avenge their
104-82 home debacle to the Bears
Saturday at the Oakland Colise
um.
"We played them pretty tough
the last time," Montgomery said.
"His (UCLA coach Jim Harrick's)
thinking will have to be not to
overlook us. UCLA does not have
as much depth as in past years —
they'll play seven or eight guys
and not all of them can do what
the starters can, but they're still
very talented."
But with all of the talk con
cerning Harrick's future at
UCLA, the Bruins will have to
stay focused if they are to beat the
Cardinal before a sellout home
crowd.
"All the stuff going on with
Jim has to be a distraction for
them," Montgomery said. "But in
Los Angeles the expectations for
UCLA basketball are very high.
It's just the nature of the beast."
On Saturday against USC (13-
7, 6-5), Stanford will employ a

similar strategy to what was used
in the first encounter between the
two schools. The Cardinal will
again have to try to shut down the
Trojans' perimeter threats, but
this time be more mindful of the
USC inside game. At the Sports
Arena, the outside shooting of
Phil Glenn, Dwayne Hackett and
Rodney Chatman was minimized,
but Tremayne Anchrum hurt
Stanford inside with 18 points
and 17 rebounds.
"They're getting a lot more out
of their inside guys," Mont
gomery said. "(Lorenzo) Orr,
Anchrum and (Mark) Boyd have
really produced for them. We
have to figure out a way to extend
our defense while also stopping
their inside guys."
Montgomery feels that the key
for these next two home games is
for the Cardinal to get out to a
good start, thereby getting the
fans excited and producing a con
fidence-boosting homecourt
advantage.
"We had a crowd at the Cal
game that would have helped us if
we had given them a reason for
positive reinforcement," Mont
gomery said. "Here you had a
chance to get the crowd on your
side and get some enthusiasm,
and we're not giving the crowd a
chance to help us. We need to
start off well so we can get the
crowd into it."

um.
"We played them pretty tough
the last time," Montgomery said.
"His (UCLA coach Jim Harrick's)
thinking will have to be not to
overlook us. UCLA does not have
as much depth as in past years —
they'll play seven or eight guys
and not all of them can do what
the starters can, but they're still
very talented."
But with all of the talk con
cerning Harrick's future at
UCLA, the Bruins will have to
stay focused if they are to beat the
Cardinal before a sellout home
crowd.
"All the stuff going on with
Jim has to be a distraction for
them," Montgomery said. "But in
Los Angeles the expectations for
UCLA basketball are very high.
It's just the nature of the beast."
On Saturday against USC (13-
7, 6-5), Stanford will employ a

similar strategy to what was used
in the first encounter between the
two schools. The Cardinal will
again have to try to shut down the
Trojans' perimeter threats, but
this time be more mindful of the
USC inside game. At the Sports
Arena, the outside shooting of
Phil Glenn, Dwayne Hackett and
Rodney Chatman was minimized,
but Tremayne Anchrum hurt
Stanford inside with 18 points
and 17 rebounds.
"They're getting a lot more out
of their inside guys," Mont
gomery said. "(Lorenzo) Orr,
Anchrum and (Mark) Boyd have
really produced for them. We
have to figure out a way to extend
our defense while also stopping
their inside guys."
Montgomery feels that the key
for these next two home games is
for the Cardinal to get out to a
good start, thereby getting the
fans excited and producing a con
fidence-boosting homecourt
advantage.
"We had a crowd at the Cal
game that would have helped us if
we had given them a reason for
positive reinforcement," Mont
gomery said. "Here you had a
chance to get the crowd on your
side and get some enthusiasm,
and we're not giving the crowd a
chance to help us. We need to
start off well so we can get the
crowd into it."
