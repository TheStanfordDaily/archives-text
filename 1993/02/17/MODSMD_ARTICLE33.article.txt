# Ninth-inning heroics make for Madden-ing comeback
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
On a Cardinal team dominated
by big-name freshmen, it was an
unheralded senior who provided
the late inning heroics yesterday.
Shawn "Scooby" Madden,
starting in the second game of his
Stanford career, blasted a two
run home run with two outs in
the ninth inning, giving the Car
dinal a come-from-behind 6-5 win
over Cal State-Los Angeles at
Sunken Diamond.
"I was pumped up, and I've
been seeing the ball pretty well
lately," Madden said. "But I
didn't go up there looking for the
home run."
Madden, who missed all of
1991 and 1992 with shoulder
drove the first pitch he
saw in the ninth well over the
fence in left field in a Cinderella
moment that would have made
John Madden proud.
Madden's shot turned a some
what sloppy outing for the No. 10
Cardinal (8-2) into an uplifting
win.
"I'm very happy for Shawn
Madden," said Stanford coach
Mark Marquess. "He's got some
real pop in his bat, especially con
sidering that he hasn't played in a
couple of years. But we made a lot
of silly mistakes today that could
have been avoided."
One of those mistakes nearly
cost Stanford the game. After the
Golden Eagles' Carlos Rios and
Brian Esquival opened the sev
enth with back-to-back singles,
Marquess replaced freshman
starter Todd Bartels with sopho
more Matt Marenghi.
Marenghi hit the next batter,
shortstop Larry Huff, loading the
bases. Robert Berns tied the con
test at four with a sacrifice fly,

putting runners at first and third
with one out.
With the count at 0-1, Huff
broke for second. In the ensuing
rundown, Esquival scored from
third, giving CSULA a 5-4 lead.
"We had problems with execu
tion today," said Marquess, who
added that the squad has experi
enced similar problems all season.
But if the Cardinal has encoun
tered problems in the field, they
have overcome these gaffes with
solid pitching and timely hitting.
Yesterday's game was no
exception. Bartels pitched six
strong innings, giving up three
runs in the fourth thanks to two
infield singles and a bloop hit into
shallow right field.
Marenghi (2-0) picked up the
win in relief and gave up only two
hits in his three innings of work.
The sophomore, slated to be Stan
ford's closer, had not seen action
in over a week before his appear
ance yesterday.
"I haven't been pitching
because we've had great starting
pitching," Marenghi said. "I can't
complain about that."
CSULA's Todd Stevens (0-1)
turned in a stellar performance
himself, tossing a complete game
and holding Cardinal bats in
check for most of the afternoon.
However, Stanford produced
when it counted. Madden's hit
was actually the second clutch
two-out performance of the day
for the Cardinal.
With Stanford down 3-1 in the
fourth, Brian Dallimore stepped
up with two outs and runners on
second and third.
Dallimore, who has five hits in
his last 11 at-bats, lined a clean
single into right-center field, tying
the score at three.
"Brian's hit kept us in the
game," Marquess said. "In some

ways, I see that hit as the key to
the win."
But if Dallimore kept the Car
dinal alive in the fourth, it was the
little-used Madden who sealed
Stanford's fifth-straight win.
"With some more at-bats, he'll
only get better," said Marquess,
who indicated that Madden will
continue to see playing time with
starting left fielder Nate Olmstead
out with a severely sprained ankle.
Madden's appearance in the
lineup places yet another inexpe
rienced piece into the talented
Cardinal puzzle. Of yesterday's 10
starters, only two played in more
than half of Stanford's games last
season.
For Madden, however, this fact
means little:
"Everybody says we're a young
team, and inexperienced, and this,
that and the other thing. But I
think we've shown that we've got
a pretty good team here."

Todd Laßocca looks on as Jed Hansen gets a Golden Eagle runner into a pickle between first and sec
ond base. The Cardinal used a two-out, two-run homerun by senior Shawn Madden in the bottom of the
ninth inning to down Cal State-Los Angeles 6-5 at Sunken Diamond yesterday. Madden, starting in only
his second game in a Cardinal uniform, took all of the 1991 and 1992 seasons off with shoulder prob
lems, but has most likely earned himself more playing time this year by pulling off his late-game hero
ics.
