The School of Medicine will re
ceive $25 million from the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation to
improve pediatric medicine and
expand services for children, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
announced yesterday.
Casper also announced the ap
pointment of Dr. Harvey Cohen, a
hematologist and oncologist at the
University of Rochester, to chair
the department of pediatrics and
become the chief pediatrician at
the Children's Hospital.
Dean of the Medical School
David Korn said the Packard gift

allowed to school to recruit Cohen,
a renowned pediatrician and can
cer specialist.
"We had a national search — a
long and painstaking search —and
we had a couple of extraordinarily
attractive candidates. ... I think
we got an outstanding academic
pediatric leader," Korn said.
Cohen will take over May 1.
The gift money will be used
over a period of years for "a whole
range of activities [Cohen] would
like to rebuild or strengthen,"
Korn said.
"The gift will permit the devel
opment of splendid programs" at
the hospital, he said. Also, the
money will be used as an "invest
ment fund" both to recruit about
20 new leading physician
researchers in the next three to
five years and to fund new pro
grams within the department.
For example, "There's a need
to develop a larger program for
pediatric pulmonary disease," a
field which has seen many recent
research advancements in gene
therapy, according to Korn.

Other programs scheduled for
expansion include pediatric genet
ics, cardiology, oncology and
heart-lung transplants.
With the new funding, Korn
said that "there's no reason why
Stanford should not have the
finest pediatric program in the
country over time. The opportu
nity is there."
"This gift will allow [Cohen] to
live up to our and his hopes and
expectations," said Don Gibbons,
a Medical School spokesman.
Cohen has served for the last
six years as associate chairman
for research and development in
pediatrics at the University of

Rochester and has been the asso
ciate director of the cancer center
there since 1989. He received his
medical degree and a Ph.D. in
biochemistry from Duke Univer
sity.
In 1986, Lucile and David
Packard donated $40 million
toward the construction of the
Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital.
In a statement released yester
day, Casper called the new gift a
"magnanimous investment in the
future of pediatric medicine," one
he believes will "pay great divi
dends to the children of California
and the nation."
