# Casper tackles Ph.D. programs, housing
## Q&A draws 40 grad students to Rains 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
In an effort to hear first-hand
the concerns of graduate students,
University President Gerhard
Casper held a discussion at Rains
House yesterday that focused on
issues ranging from regulations
for Ph.D. programs to the new as
sociate dean for graduate policy.
While the question-and-an
swer session, attended by about
40 students, was scheduled to
deal openly with such topics as
housing, funding and graduate
student services, according to
Rains Head Graduate Resident
Assistant Hahn Cao, the discus
sion ended up being directed to is
sues of policy.
Building on his proposal for a
three-year undergraduate pro

gram, Casper said that the Uni
versity has to go beyond its first
inclination "to defend the status
quo" and accept the necessity of
change. He cited the need for de
partments to review their policy
regarding Ph.D. programs.
Casper said he believes that "on
the whole, many departments and
the University have taken a lais
sez-faire approach to the studies
and the time required to obtain a
Ph.D."
There can be many factors in
volved in obtaining a doctorate
that make administrators reluc
tant to impose regulations, Casper
acknowledged. However, he said
he does not feel it would make the
University "unduly bureaucratic"
if each department and discipline
made an effort to establish a "nor
mal" expected time to complete a
doctorate degree, as well as guide
lines for working toward the
degree.
Casper was asked if he could
step in and take action to deal
with what one student called a
"diffused system of responsibili
ty" in dealing with the housing
problems in Escondido Village.
Casper said the position of the
new associate dean of graduate
policy, filled by George Dekker,
was specifically designed to
address such concerns.
While such events as last week's
Escondido Village town meeting are
good first steps in expressing stu
dents' concerns to the administra
tion, Casper encouraged students
to meet with those within the Uni
versity — such as Dekker— who
are there to make sure that their
problems do not go unnoticed.
Regarding graduate student
financing, Casper talked about
the need to examine the relation
ship between grants, tuition and
living expenses.
While a solution cannot be
found immediately, Casper said
the high cost of maintaining some
programs will force the Universi
ty to re-evaluate its priorities in
the long run.
The University will also have
to rethink the whole issue of
financing and how to balance the
quality of life of graduate stu
dents with the payment of their
graduate programs, said Casper.
Chris Griffith, the director of
graduate student residences, said
that the meeting provided Casper
with an "opportunity to talk to a
group of graduate students to
hear about their issues and con
cerns."

Casper said the meeting
showed him the intensity behind
many of the students' concerns.
Shari Seider, a student in the
School of Education, said that
although it was "worthwhile" to
talk with Casper, she felt as if he
came in with his own program.
"He definitely had things that
he wanted to plug," said Seider.
Later in the evening, Casper
delivered the 20th State of the
University address to the Palo
Alto City Council.
In his speech, Casper praised
the long-standing good relation

ship between Stanford and Palo
Alto, mentioning projects such as
the Ravenswood-Stanford Tutor
ing Program and the Spoon
Hunger Relief Network, which
conduct outreach programs in the
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto
areas.
Casper said the city and the
University should continue work
ing together on such long-range
plans as remedying their financial
crises, improving the Stanford
Research Park, consolidating the
University's medical facilities and
extending Sand Hill Road.

"I am optimistic that we can
meet the challenges ... in this
greater era of cooperation," said
Casper.
California depends on institu
tions like Stanford, the Universi
ty of California and the California
Institute of Technology "for lead
ership based on their scientific
accomplishments," Casper said.
Casper acknowledged the fact
that in order for California to con
tinue to progress, "we are all
going to have to pay a price — but
only after talking and planning
together."
