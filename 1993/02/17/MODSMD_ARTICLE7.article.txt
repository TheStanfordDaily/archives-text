# 'BYOB' frat parties may soon become the norm

"May I see your Stanford ID, valid identi
fication, and your six-pack please ?"
While this may sound like a strange
greeting, it was, in fact, the first question
students were asked at a "Bring Your Own
Beer" party held jointly by Sigma Chi,
Sigma Nu and Sigma Alpha Epsilon late last
month.
The three fraternities asked party-goers
over 21 to supply their own alcohol in lieu of
having the fraternities dole out the drinks.
The BYOB party, held Jan. 29, evolved
out of the difficulties fraternities face in ob
taining insurance, said Heather Dunn, fra
ternal affairs adviser with the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
A group called the Fraternity Insurance

Purchasing Group, a national organization
which negotiates with insurance companies
to get reasonable premiums for college fra
ternities, developed the BYOB policy for
risk management, Dunn said.
In order to obtain low-cost insurance,
fraternities must not provide alcohol to mi
nors, purchase alcohol with chapter funds,
or have any common containers such as
kegs, party balls or cases. BYOB parties
meet all three requirements.
Dunn said fraternities at Stanford have
been under "exceptional pressure" from
Llieir national organizations, which supply
insurance to the local chapters, to follow
this policy.
SAE social director Karlis Felzenberg
said, "We weren't really all that thrilled in
the beginning, but I don't see it as being
detrimental."

Eventually, Dunn said, the national or
ganizations would like every fraternity to
use only the BYOB party method. At this
point, however, they are merely suggesting
them to local chapters.
Students who drink at a BYOB party
must be 21 years old and have purchased
their own alcohol, according to the Greek
Judicial Board.
At the door, students are carded, given a
colored wristband showing they are over 21
and asked to hand over their beer. They re
ceive a card indicating how much beer they
brought.
The card is punched throughout the
evening, marking how many beers the per
son has consumed. Fraternity members
designated as "sober monitors" pass out the
beer. Only cans are allowed due to safety
problems with bottled beer, and students

may bring a maximum of 12 cans.
The BYOB policy suggests that students
bring Coors or Coors Light. "We ask for this
just so people will remain consistent with
their beer," said Dunn. "If you bring some
other kind of beer, it's not always guaran
teed that you'll get that same one back."
Students may only take one beer at a
time, and must trade in an empty can in
order to obtain a full one, Dunn said. "This
way, we cut down on the risk of students
passing beer around to their friends."
Dunn added that the University "has not
required the fraternities to [have BYOB par
ties], as many rumors have stated. They have
merely encouraged them to go in this direc
tion.
"Our attitude is that we want healthy
