# 'Outstanding concertmaster' plays to relax
##

Most musicians find Tchai
kovsky's formidable composi
tions anything but relaxing to
play.
However, for Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra concertmaster
Andrew Lan, who plays the violin
at least 14 hours a week, even
Tchaikovsky is fun.
In addition to performing
with the orchestra, Lan plays in
numerous other musical ensem
bles including chamber music
groups and the pit orchestra for
"West Side Story."
"I ei\joy every moment of it. I
think that's why I've been able to
keep sane. Academics haven't
overwhelmed me because I've been
able to relax playing," Lan said.
As a junior majoring in Russian

Stanford Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Andrew Lan practices the violin, as he does at least 14
hours each week.
and biology, Lan said he needs that
relaxation. But being the concert
master does carry extra responsibil
ity. Beyond the normal rehearsal
schedule, Lan's duties include hold
ing special small-group rehearsals
for individual sections of the orches
tra, working out stylistic interpreta
tions and performing solos.
"He's an outstanding concert
master and leader of the (violin)
section. He takes his job very seri
ously," said Joyce Johnson-Hamil
ton, the orchestra's assistant con
ductor. "He doesn't just show up
and bask in the glory of being the
head player. He puts a lot of work
into it."
Another duty of the concert
master is promoting orchestra
morale. Albert Liu, a violinist who
has played with Lan since junior
high, said, "He's good at fostering
a sense of community in the
orchestra. He knows how to bring
not only the violins together, but
the whole orchestra together."
Orchestra members cite a
scheme Lan created to insure that
each musician playing at the Vien
nese Ball would have an interest
ing melodv to play.

"He went to a lot of work to
make sure that no one was playing
off-beats (the rhythmic 'oom pah
pahs') for hours." said Johnson-
Hamilton. "He worked out an
elaborate seating arrangement so
that everyone would get to play
different parts" of the music.
Lan said he also enjoys using
his organizational skills as a pro
gram assistant at Storey House.
"I've spent a lot of time putting
together activities and social
events," Lan explained.
"He goes above and beyond for
this house," said junior Marcus
Trevino, another Storey resident.
"He's enthusiastic, but not anally
enthusiastic — not to the point
that makes you sick."
But in the dorm and in his
music, Lan said he prefers the role
of behind-the-scenes organizer to
that of a soloist.
For example, Lan says he isn't
very interested in individual violin
competitions. "I don't consider
myself a solo player at all. I find
playing in groups a lot more fun."
To find musical inspiration,
Lan said he listens to many record
ings of a particular piece. "I take
all the aspects that I like for each
one and put them together how I
want it,"he said. "It usually ends
up pretty specific."
Although the thought some

times crosses his mind, Lan said
he does not plan to become a pro
fessional musician.
"Occasionally I'll want to drop
everything and just do music. But
the practical point of view comes
back," he said. "I'm perfectly con
tent to just do it for enjoyment."
Lan's "practical" goals include
attending medical school and uti
lizing his knowledge of Russian,
which he has studied since high
school.
A oonth-long trip, before his
freshman year, to the former Sovi
et Union ignited Lan's desire to
continue studying Russian.
"I loved it there," he said. "It
was probably the most unusual
and fun month of my life."
But his passion for the violin
began long before that trip. Lan
said he thinks he began playing the
violin at age five. As his parents'
story goes, he spontaneously picked
up two chopsticks one day and pre
tended to play the violin. Before
long, they enrolled him in lessons.
Although his parents aren't
musicians, Andrew credits their
support as an important factor in
his success.
"They helped me through the
rocky times," he said. "There were
definitely a few times when I want
ed to quit. Now I wouldn't dream
of stopping."
