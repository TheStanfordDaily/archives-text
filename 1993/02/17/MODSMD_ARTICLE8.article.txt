Most musicians find Tchai
kovsky's formidable composi
tions anything but relaxing to
play.
However, for Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra concertmaster
Andrew Lan, who plays the violin
at least 14 hours a week, even
Tchaikovsky is fun.
In addition to performing
with the orchestra, Lan plays in
numerous other musical ensem
bles including chamber music
groups and the pit orchestra for
"West Side Story."
"I ei\joy every moment of it. I
think that's why I've been able to
keep sane. Academics haven't
overwhelmed me because I've been
able to relax playing," Lan said.
