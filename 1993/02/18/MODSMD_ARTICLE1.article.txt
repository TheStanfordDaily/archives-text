Plagued by breakdowns and
overcrowding, the Tresidder com
puter cluster is drawing criticism
from frustrated students â€” but
University officials warn that
things may only get worse.
Three years ago the University
unveiled about 80 top-of-the-line
Macintosh II and Ilex computers.
Today those same Macs are over
worked and badly in need of re
placement, according to cluster
coordinator Phil Gibson.
"This cluster is aging and there
definitely needs to be a turnover
in getting new equipment soon,
but we just don't know where that
money is going to come from,"
Gibson said.
With funding cut by 15 percent
last year and another 15 percent
the year before, the Tresidder
cluster is one of the many victims
of the University's budget-reduc
tion effort.
Compounding the crippling ef
fect of these cuts, Gibson said re
pair costs almost doubled last
year. Ten Macs are now "in the
shop," he added.
Whether the now-common
place delays at the cluster are
caused by the number of comput
ers out of commission, increased
demand or a combination of the
two factors, Gibson said there are
now students waiting to use ma
chines almost all afternoon and
evening.
"Even last year it was easier to
get a computer," said junior Scott
