Plagued by breakdowns and
overcrowding, the Tresidder com
puter cluster is drawing criticism
from frustrated students — but
University officials warn that
things may only get worse.
Three years ago the University
unveiled about 80 top-of-the-line
Macintosh II and Ilex computers.
Today those same Macs are over
worked and badly in need of re
placement, according to cluster
coordinator Phil Gibson.
"This cluster is aging and there
definitely needs to be a turnover
in getting new equipment soon,
but we just don't know where that
money is going to come from,"
Gibson said.
With funding cut by 15 percent
last year and another 15 percent
the year before, the Tresidder
cluster is one of the many victims
of the University's budget-reduc
tion effort.
Compounding the crippling ef
fect of these cuts, Gibson said re
pair costs almost doubled last
year. Ten Macs are now "in the
shop," he added.
Whether the now-common
place delays at the cluster are
caused by the number of comput
ers out of commission, increased
demand or a combination of the
two factors, Gibson said there are
now students waiting to use ma
chines almost all afternoon and
evening.
"Even last year it was easier to
get a computer," said junior Scott
Francis, a computer science major
and cluster regular. "You could
just walk in here any old time and
get a computer. Now you have to
plan your day to come here at
[less busy] times."
For many students the Tresid
der cluster is the only one they
can use because dorm and other
clusters are not adequate, Francis
said. "If you want to get a com
puter in the dorm you have to do
your work late at night," he said.
Other students rely on the clus
ter because computer science class
es assign work that requires soft

ware provided only at Tresidder.
"In lower division classes, CS
students live in the cluster," said
computer science senior lecturer
James Finn. "CS 106 in its various
forms absolutely depends on it."
The cluster's problems are
beginning to get attention from
the Library and Information
Resources department, under
whose budget it operates, said Ed
McGuigan, technical director of
University libraries. It had been
overshadowed by the renovation
needs of Meyer Library, but is
now being targeted for revitaliza
tion, he said.
"We're just now realizing that
this is one of the areas in which
budget cuts were too drastic,"
McGuigan said. He added that he

has requested additional funding
for the cluster but doesn't know if
the department will be able to
provide it.
He said he is also seeking help
for the cluster from outside
sources, but the outlook is not good.
"When the cluster began, a lot of
the equipment was donated, but I
think Apple is not as generous with
its gifts as it used to be," he said.
Many of the biggest cuts have
come in personnel, Gibson said,
causing the number of consul
tants to shrink in the last two
years. A new grant will allow them
to hire an additional staff member
for this year, but a permanent
solution would require an increase
in the personnel budget.
Gibson said that if the cluster's

computers are not replaced soon,
they will break down more often
and the repair costs will continue
to increase.
"Stanford is committed to pro
viding top-notch resources . . .
and to that end, some time really
soon we need to upgrade these
Macs," he said.
Both Gibson and McGuigan
agreed that if the Tresidder clus
ter's budget doesn't increase and
computers are not replaced, it
could be squeezed out of existence
in the next two years. But that sce
nario is very unlikely, they said.
McGuigan said he is confident
that the necessary funding will be
found somehow, although he
doesn't know when or from where
it will come.
