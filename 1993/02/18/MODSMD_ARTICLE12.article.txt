U.N. stops aid in Sarajevo
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) —
Serb tanks bore down on a key western suburb
yesterday as U.N. officials halted aid opera
tions and accused Bosnia's warring factions of
using food as a political weapon.
The Serb offensive on the last defensive lines
was an apparent attempt to capture more of the
capital before peace talks resume tomorrow.
The Muslim-led government has blocked
U.N. food aid from reaching Sarajevo, accusing
the United Nations of ignoring besieged Mus
lims in eastern Bosnia. But convoys to the
region have been halted by ethnic Serbs, who
took up arms after Bosnia declared indepen
dence from Yugoslavia in February 1992.
The United Nations has condemned use of
relief shipments for political means and is
increasingly frustrated by attacks on humanitar
ian personnel.
"I really regret that I have to make this deci
sion because we have been trying to help the vic
tims, the ordinary people, and we cannot do
that," said Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Com
missioner for Refugees.
