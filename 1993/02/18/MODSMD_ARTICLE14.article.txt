## BYOB – A flat idea 
### 
The proposed fraternity
policy will be difficult to
enforce, socially stifling

There are some things
in life that you count on.
Death. Taxes. Free beer at
fraternity parties.
But if overzealous insurance
companies, national fraternal orga
nizations and the University have
their way, even something as simple
as getting a beer may become as
complex as filing for financial aid.
With liability insurance rates
going through the roof, Stanford
fraternities are under "exceptional
pressure" to not provide alcohol to
minors, buy alcohol with chapter
funds or have any common con
tainers like kegs. Instead, they are
being encouraged to host "Bring
your own beer" parties.
Under this ridiculous proposal,
partygoers are asked to bring their
own beer — no more than 12 cans
(of Coors, no less) — and check it
at the door. Beer-bringers are card
ed, given a wristband indicating
proof of age and a card indicating
how much beer they brought.
Students may only take one beer
at a time and must trade in an empty
can for a full one. The trading card is
to be diligently punched throughout
the evening as students consume
beers. This presents a problem: Who
on earth is going to pick up the
punched holes in the morning?
The other problems with this
proposal are so obvious, so myriad
that even Carrie Nation would
take her hatchet to it.
First, if people are going to
have to purchase their own alco
hol, why bother coming back to
campus? Armed with fake IDs,
Stanford students would simply
begin frequenting local watering
holes. This could revive the per
vasive drinking-and-driving prob
lems of the late '70s and early
'80s. Offering students free alco
hol on campus provides a safe
alternative — they can walk

home after having one too many.
Second, the policy will effectively
put an end to Stanford's unique "all
campus" party atmosphere. Frater
nities, not wanting to bother with
the bureaucracy of the BYOB regu
lations, may begin to host small,
closed, invite-only parties. This
would only promote the greek sys
tem's elitism, which the University
has been trying to combat for years.
Third, the logistics of the policy
are poorly designed. Even with
punch cards, bracelets and check
ins, it would be easy to subvert the
system. Bracelet-bearingpartygoers
could simply check out a beer, pass it
to an underage friend, get the can
back, and exchange it for another
full can. How is that different from
what people do now with cups?
In addition, the policy may be
conducive to fights over such
issues as not getting back the kind
of beer checked in, or riots if the
"beer bank" somehow — through
(gasp!) sloppy accounting — gets
overdrawn. Will there be an FDIC
for the beer bank? What insurance
will depositers receive?
And there will be pressure to
consume all the beer one brings,
for who wants to lug home the
remaining beers at the end of the
evening? Better to chug 'em and go
home empty-handed.
Instead of BYOB, the Office of
Student Activities should explore
the possibility of requiring partygo
ers to sign forms releasing fraterni
ties of liability. Fraternities could
require students to produce identi
fication when signing the release.
This would prevent freshmen from
signing in as 42-year-olds.
Stanford is not located close to
alternative entertainment sources
for students who don't have cars.
With the implementation of the
alcohol policy two years ago, the
campus party atmosphere has mel
lowed to the level of a Sunday
church ice cream social; a BYOB
policy would be the coup de grace of
Stanford's social scene.
Hmmmm. Maybe it's no coinci
dence that they're thinking of
extending weekend library hours.
