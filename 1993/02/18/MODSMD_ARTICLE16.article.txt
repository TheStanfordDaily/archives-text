## A 						broad re-examination 
### 
PRESIDENT CASPER HAS been
presenting several thought-pro
voking ideas to both the Stanford
community and the public-at-large that
seem to focus on re-examining the uni
versity system.
As students, we need to take a seri
ous look at some of these ideas and we
should have a forum or an opportunity
to give our own suggestions and propos
als, designed to supplement, or counter
act in some cases, new decrees rendered
from above.
For instance, Casper has suggested
establishing a three-year undergradu
ate option. This seems relatively harm
less if you have enough AP credit and
the university promises to end the
"offered every-other year" or "limited
size determined by instructor" policy
that often forces students to take a
fourth or fifth year. However I do have
a problem with the logic that Casper
uses to support this idea. He says that
college costs are too high and, in the
same breath, argues that you don't need
a four-year liberal arts education with a
little of this and a little of that.
If someone mu acuiously donated a bil
lion dollars to cut the cost of an undergrad
uate education in half, would we be having
this discussion about the practicality of a
liberal arts education? I don't think so. So is
the question about money or liberal arts?
Casper has been quoted as saying, "It is

naive to assume that the major universities
can go on as they have done in the past
without reexamination of their ways."
So, let's begin re-examining. I think we
could start by exploring the simple question
of why we are at Stanford and, for that
matter, what the purpose of the university
system is.
When you get past the "Stanford is a
place to learn, grow and dream" fairy-tale
definition and get right to it, Stanford is
an institution, a bureaucratic business
machine which is in the business of doing
research and bragging about how many
Nobel Prize winners it has, keeping
alumni happy so they'll keep donating
money, and, when it can fit it in, prepar
ing its students for a competitive job mar
ket.
Stanford can and must be something
more. Before anyone begins hastily
swinging the "Axe of economic sensibil
ity," the University should take a look
at what Stanford is currently offering
its four-year undergrads. Find out how
much an economics major knows about
the history of race relations in this
country. Feel out a bio major's knowl
edge of Aristotle's ideas about natural
slavery.
There is so much talk about how ill
prepared we are for a competitive job
when, in fact, we are ill-prepared for
understanding our own social existence
in this country. We are compartmental

ized and specialized to such a degree that
there is a minimal-to-nonexistent level of
crossover between fields of study.
If Casper thinks that major universi
ties need to reexamine their ways, why
not also re-examine how Stanford can
bring fields of study together so we can
start solving some of the social ills plagu
ing society? Why don't we start re-exam
ining Stanford's responsibility in meet
ing the needs of people in the neighboring
communities, counties and state as a
whole who are in social, economic and
educational disarray and depend on Stan
ford's influence on the very lawmakers
who decide their fate?
It is quite clear that some type of
change is necessary and inevitable. But I
think the same people who cut our stu
dent services and the quality of our Stan
ford education with last year's budget
crisis and have just raised our tuition 7.5
percent might do well to take a rest from
economizing and listen to some of our
ideas.
