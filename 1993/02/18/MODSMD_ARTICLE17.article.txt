Viennese Ball committee defends price y logistics of dance

Before emerging from our
committee bunker and leaving for
our annual all-expense-paid junket
to Austria, we thought we'd help Kenny
Mai with some facts which he forgot to
gather before writing his Feb. 12 column
about the Viennese Ball.
First of all, as for our expenses, we
would have gladly supplied you with a
copy of our budget if you had bothered to
ask. Your brief summary seemed to
assume that almost everything the ball is
donated. Indeed, we could not hold the
ball without the generous donations
from several local businesses, and more
importantly, we could never repay the
countless hours volunteered by every
committee member. But you seemed to
assume that Stanford just donated Roble
Gym to us for the evening, along with
the lighting and sound equipment.
Heck, you must also have assumed
that we acquired all of the tables, chairs,
tarps, dance flooring, space heaters, risers
and decorations from some very generous

party-supply company. Oh, but then we
must also have found a philanthropic
trucking company to deliver all of this
stuff. All of the dance lessons and activi
ties which made up Austria Week must
also have been very inexpensive. We must
concede, you were right in assuming that
we do spend a considerable amount of
money on the Stanford Symphony and
the Mark Teel Orchestra, but we believe
that these groups help make the Vien
nese Ball such a special event. As for the
money we pay for programs, refresh
ments, security, servers, ad nauseam, we
would be happy to provide the gory
details to you or anyone else.
As for your main point, our wielding
of imaginary power — we really didn't
feel that powerful while cleaning up
Roble Gym at 5:30 in the morning.
Sorry to disappoint you, but most of our
policies have purposes other than inflat
ing our egos. We issue receipts instead of
the actual tickets, not because we enjoy
having to staff tables or find other ways

to get tickets to ball-goers at a latter
date, but because in the past numerous
people have "lost" their tickets in the
four weeks prior to the ball. Frequently,
these "lost" tickets would be convenient
ly found by other individuals.
As to "making" people sleep out, we
only set a time for ticket sales; we do not
control when people get in line to purchase
them. We would prefer that people didn't
sleep out, so that we wouldn't have to pull
all-nighters in order to monitor the line.
In addition, our "inane rules" did not
stem from some sadistic desire to abuse
people, they were implemented at the
suggestion of prior ball-goers, who were
dismayed at the number of people who
attempted to buy multiple tickets, or
who allowed others to cut in front of
those who did sleep out. In addition, we
would love to have a better location to
sell tickets than White Plaza, but once
again, the University does not donate its
warm comfy buildings for free.
As to your other comments, if nobody

wanted tickets to the ball, there probably
wouldn't be one, just like if nobody read a
Daily column, that column would probably
get pulled. But maybe you'd like life better
that way — no ball, no Daily columns and
no power-hungry organizations. Just think
of all the video games you could play.
Anyway, we hope you had a wonderful
evening laughing at ball-goers and
trekking off to the bank. We heard that
automated-tellers make excellent dates
and are fantastic waltz partners.
Finally, we would like to once again
thank all of those wonderful people who
helped to make this year's ball possible.
In addition, we hope that all those who
attended had a fantastic time, for your
enjoyment provides the enthusiasm
which drives future committee volun
teers to continue the tradition of Stan
ford's Viennese Ball.
