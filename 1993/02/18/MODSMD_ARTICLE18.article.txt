# Memorial Church has lost its connection to its Christian background
## 
### 
Thank you Mike Langford for
broaching an important, and potential
ly controversial, topic. Memorial
Church no longer presents the Chris
tian tone either in the discussions and
speeches held there, or in the decor,
save for a few token crosses and the
one stained-glass portrait of Christ. As
a matter of fact, Mem Chu no longer
seems to have any religious tendencies
at all.
When I visited Stanford as a junior in
high school, I was very impressed by the
natural beauty of the campus, and espe

daily Mem Chu, one of the most beauti
ful churches I have ever seen. Thus, my
disappointment can be imagined, when
I learned upon arrival as a freshman
that Mem Chu would be closed for a
couple of years due to earthquake
repairs. And my anticipation of the
reopening seemed to be shared by the
Stanford community at large.
However, I could never have imagined
the disappointment that I felt on my first
visit there this year. At the most basic
level, a church is a place where people go
in order to worship God. Church is the
house of God. Is it any wonder that I was
taken aback when the speaker that
morning said he thought the Christian
icons in the church were hindering
believers of other faiths from attending
Mem Chu's worship services?
Now, I do realize that in our society

today, there is strong support for the ideal
of a "separation of Church and State." But
Stanford University is a private institution.
I am not, by any means, advocating chang
ing Stanford into a Christian institution.
But I am arguing that Mem Chu be
allowed to serve the function it was origi
nally founded for — to teach and expose
people to the Christian faith while provid
ing a comfortable place simply to worship
God.
A church is a place for education. If I
step into a Moslem mosque or a Jewish
temple, I expect to see and experience
the respective faiths, by witnessing the
actions of the body of believers around
me. What does Memorial Church offer
to educate those who wish to learn more
about the Christian faith when it cannot
even produce God's word, the Bible, to
inquirers? What sort of message are we

sending when we go to worship God and
never hear his name during service?
I thought multiculturalism meant
learning firsthand about other peoples'
beliefs, ways of life and cultures through
shared experiences that truly expose what
one's thought or lifestyle is like. Is Memori
al Church a true representative of what
the Christian faith and lifestyle are like? I
believe many Christians who have experi
enced the present atmosphere of Mem Chu
would have to say no. I don't think we
should force anyone to go to church who
doesn't have the inclination — I believe in
everyone's freedom to choose a religion, or
no religion, for themselves. I simply think
we should provide a better example of what
the Christian faith is like than we now pre
sent at Memorial Church.
