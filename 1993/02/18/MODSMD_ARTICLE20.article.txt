## Allaway steps into action for Stanford 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
It's not every day a Stanford
basketball player greets you
with "Top o' the morning." But
— by way of Hopkinsville, Ky. —
Darren Allaway comes straight
from the Mother Country, hail
ing from London, England.
"You all are the ones speaking
with the strange accent," All
away said. "You borrowed the
language from us. Your accent is
foreign to me."
Allaway has provided a defi
nite accent to the Cardinal,
starting at the power forward
spot. Along with fellow first-year
player Dion Cross, Allaway has
had an immediate impact on an
injury-decimated Cardinal
squad.
"I've been surprised because I
wasn't expecting to play so
much," Allaway said. "But we
weren't expecting the injuries to
Jim (Morgan) and Jason (Weaver)
either. I've tried to play as hard as
I can."
Allaway has proven to be the
lone bright spot in the dark hole
of Stanford's depleted front line.
Though a freshman, the 6-foot -
8, 225-pound Londoner has not
been afraid to play physical
inside, using his size to muscle
the opposition and snare
rebounds.
"He's our best post guy in
terms of holding a spot, catching

the ball and making a strong move
to the basket," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "He has
natural strength and can put a
body on a guy."
"He has some agility skills that
some of our other post players
don't have," said forward Brent
Williams. "He has a natural
aggressiveness that has allowed
him to be productive for us."
Allaway moved into the Stan
ford starting lineup on Dec. 29
against Ohio University, where
he stayed until severely sprain
ing his ankle three minutes into
the game on Jan. 12 against
Notre Dame. His tenure was
highlighted by an 8-point, 12-
rebound performance against
Oregon State in the Cardinal's
Pacific 10 Conference opener.
"I thought I was going to have
a 20 (points) -10 (rebounds)
game against Notre Dame," All
away said. "Injuries always seem
to come at the worst times."
"The ankle set him back,"
Montgomery said. "He had a cou
ple games where it looked like he
was ready to step up and be the
guy for us, but the ankle slowed
him down."
After sitting out for a month,
Allaway saw limited playing time
before returning to the starting
lineup against California last
Sunday.
For most of his formative
years, Allaway was far from any
thing related to basketball. Born
and raised in London, he was not
exposed to basketball until an
eighth-grade gym class.
"I played soccer before that,"
Allaway said. "I was all right,
but I wasn't club material."
But given the choice of just
"hanging around" or playing
basketball, Allaway selected the
latter, and realized that in order
to get better, he would have to go
to America.
"I decided to go to the United
States, but my mom decided we
would go a year later — after I
finished my exams," Allaway
said.
In the interim, because he
was "good enough, or maybe tall
enough," Allaway played for the
English National Team in the
summer of 1988, traveling
throughout Europe.
Before 10th grade, Allaway
crossed the Atlantic and relocat
ed to Kentucky. He was not com
pletely prepared for the new

lifestyle that awaited him.
"In England, I was always
looking at 'The Cosby Show' and
'A Different World', so I expected
the NBC prime time life," All
away said. "Initially, I was
stunned."
Yet Allaway quickly adjusted,
and now looks back with fond
ness on his years in the South.
"I learned so much about peo
ple and the southern way of
life," Allaway said. "Everyone
was so friendly. If you walk
around London saying 'hi' to
everybody, you may get arrest
ed."
In his senior year, he led Uni
versity Heights high school to its

third-straight Kentucky state
championship, averaging 13.2
points, 7.6 rebounds and four
blocks per game — numbers
which impressed the Cardinal
coaching staff and helped All
away's goal of attaining a Divi
sion I scholarship.
Allaway has now set his sights
on a new challenge — becoming
a premier big man in the Pac-10.
"I need to improve on my
knowledge of the game, the little
nuances like how to read referees
and game situations," Allaway
said. "It's just a matter of experi
ence. The ultimate goal of a big
man is to be the strongest person
on the court, and that's what I

body on a guy."
"He has some agility skills that
some of our other post players
don't have," said forward Brent
Williams. "He has a natural
aggressiveness that has allowed
him to be productive for us."
Allaway moved into the Stan
ford starting lineup on Dec. 29
against Ohio University, where
he stayed until severely sprain
ing his ankle three minutes into
the game on Jan. 12 against
Notre Dame. His tenure was
highlighted by an 8-point, 12-
rebound performance against
Oregon State in the Cardinal's
Pacific 10 Conference opener.
"I thought I was going to have
a 20 (points) -10 (rebounds)
game against Notre Dame," All
away said. "Injuries always seem
to come at the worst times."
"The ankle set him back,"
Montgomery said. "He had a cou
ple games where it looked like he
was ready to step up and be the
guy for us, but the ankle slowed
him down."
After sitting out for a month,
Allaway saw limited playing time
before returning to the starting
lineup against California last
Sunday.
For most of his formative
years, Allaway was far from any
thing related to basketball. Born
and raised in London, he was not
exposed to basketball until an
eighth-grade gym class.
"I played soccer before that,"
Allaway said. "I was all right,
but I wasn't club material."
But given the choice of just
"hanging around" or playing
basketball, Allaway selected the
latter, and realized that in order
to get better, he would have to go
to America.
"I decided to go to the United
States, but my mom decided we
would go a year later — after I
finished my exams," Allaway
said.
In the interim, because he
was "good enough, or maybe tall
enough," Allaway played for the
English National Team in the
summer of 1988, traveling
throughout Europe.
Before 10th grade, Allaway
crossed the Atlantic and relocat
ed to Kentucky. He was not com
pletely prepared for the new

lifestyle that awaited him.
"In England, I was always
looking at 'The Cosby Show' and
'A Different World', so I expected
the NBC prime time life," All
away said. "Initially, I was
stunned."
Yet Allaway quickly adjusted,
and now looks back with fond
ness on his years in the South.
"I learned so much about peo
ple and the southern way of
life," Allaway said. "Everyone
was so friendly. If you walk
around London saying 'hi' to
everybody, you may get arrest
ed."
In his senior year, he led Uni
versity Heights high school to its

third-straight Kentucky state
championship, averaging 13.2
points, 7.6 rebounds and four
blocks per game — numbers
which impressed the Cardinal
coaching staff and helped All
away's goal of attaining a Divi
sion I scholarship.
Allaway has now set his sights
on a new challenge — becoming
a premier big man in the Pac-10.
"I need to improve on my
knowledge of the game, the little
nuances like how to read referees
and game situations," Allaway
said. "It's just a matter of experi
ence. The ultimate goal of a big
man is to be the strongest person
on the court, and that's what I
