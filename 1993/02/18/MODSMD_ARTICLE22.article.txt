# Netters go indoors
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
This evening, the men's tennis
team will begin a grueling battle to
defend their national title. Not their
NCAA title, but their Team Indoor
title.
After a first round bye at the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships, the Cardinal men will duel
with Louisiana State in Louisville,
Ky. at 5 p.m. Pacific time. By defeat
ing Colorado in the first round, LSU
received the dubious honor of chal
lenging the Cardinal.
This year, the tournament brings
together 17 of the top 18 teams in the
ITA rankings. Defending champion
Stanford has won the title a record
seven times, and is the No. 2 seed
behind USC.
The indoor courts should not be
problematic for the Stanford men
who, because of heavy rain, have
been practicing inside more than
usual. In fact, the Cardinal's top
man, Michael Flanagan, is looking
forward to playing indoors.
"I'm still getting used to playing
outside; I've been doing great on

indoor courts," he said.
Judging by recent performances,
Flanagan and the rest of the unde
feated Cardinal squad should have a
big weekend back East. Dropping
only one set in the last two matches,
winning the Pacific 10 Conference
Indoors in Seattle and cranking out
impressive performances in other
tournaments, Stanford has demon
strated continuing strength despite
the graduation of several top players
last year.
Even with a few minor injuries in
the past week, the Cardinal's perfor
mance has not wavered. With several
skilled freshmen battling for starting
spots, the team's depth is perhaps its
strongest asset this year.
"I have at least nine guys that I
can play," said coach Dick Gould.
This weekend will be an uphill
battle but Gould feels that the team
has already improved significantly.
"We have a long way to go now," he
said, "but we've definitely made
progress in the last two weeks."
Should the Stanford men defeat
LSU, they will face either Kentucky
or No. 8-seeded North Carolina on
Friday evening.
