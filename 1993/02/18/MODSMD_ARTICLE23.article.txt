The Stanford rugby team's 39-
15 victory over Humboldt State
last Saturday took the Cardinal
one step closer to a berth in the
Pacific Coast playoffs, but the win
was also meaningful on another
level. In mauling the previously
undefeated Loggers, the Cardinal
established itself in the upper ech
elon of collegiate rugby on the
Pacific coast.
"We knew that they (Humboldt
State) were going to come down
here and try to outhit us hard and
beat us to the ball," said senior prop
Justin Davis. "We decided we had
to beat them at their own game."
Stanford threatened through
most of the first half, keeping
Humboldt on the defensive and
pummeling them in the scrum.
"Their front row in the scrum was
pretty inexperienced," said sopho
more hooker Jeff Freund.
Stanford fly-half Eric Fleckten
opened the scoring 20 minutes
into the half, as Cardinal scrum
half Kevin Linker fed the ball to a
slashing Fleckten, who touched it
down for the score. Stanford

pushed their scrum over the goal
line just before halftime, and
senior eight man Joe Croft
touched the ball down for the score
and a 14-0 Cardinal advantage as
the period ended.
The defensive breakdowns that
have marred several Stanford vic
tories this season appeared once
again early in the second half, as
Humboldt's inside center burst
through Stanford's tacklers to
score a breakaway try.
Stanford answered promptly
with senior flanker Vince Otoupal
pulling down the ball from the
line-out and barreling into the try
zone. Fleckten followed with his
third successful conversion kick of
the day and added a penalty kick
minutes later.
With a 24-12 lead following a
second Humboldt try, it was the
play of senior Brian Schultz that
sealed the victory for Stanford.
Seeing his first varsity action of
the year, the former wide receiver
twice took the ball on the wing and
simply blew by the opposition td
secure the win.
The Cardinal travels to Santa
Clara to challenge the Broncos this
Saturday at 1 p. m.
