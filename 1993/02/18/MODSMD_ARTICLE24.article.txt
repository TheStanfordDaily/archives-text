# Bo's gutsy comeback symbolizes true spirit of athletics
## 
### 
Bo's back. It seemed like only yester
day that Mr. Jackson knew baseball,
football, hockey, jai alai, badminton,
equestrian sports, darts and broomball.
But a different Bo Jackson will step onto
the field at the Chicago White Sox training
camp in Sarasota, Fla. this week. He's a
survivor in every sense of the word — of
crushing media attention, of a season-end
ing injury that destroyed his left hip and of
his mother's death last year.
Bo knows pain.
Pain is practically all Bo's had over the
past nine months. Most doctors assured
Jackson that his plastic-lined prosthetic
hip would not stand up to the day-to-day
rigors of professional baseball. They told

him that returning to baseball would prob
ably cause deterioration of the artificial hip
joint, and would necessitate at least one
more surgery during Jackson's career.
That is, if a bad slide into second base
doesn't drive the metal rod in his leg

through the bone.
No matter what Bo Jackson does this
or next season with the White Sox, he will
always be remembered as professional
athletics' first full-time, two-sport athlete.
Now, however, Jackson embodies the
example of a different kind of athlete —
one who spends day after day, week after
week in rehabilitation, working long hours
alone in the weight room towards an
uncertain future.
We sometimes forget that even the best
college and high school superstars never
live the dream of playing professionally.
We forget that big-time athletics are as
filled with tragedy as success, and that
nothing is ever as easy as it seems on TV.

Why, then, does a successful player like
Jackson want to return to the sport,
despite the damage that he will almost
surely do to his body? Bo replies, simply,
"This is what I want to do."
Bo is not motivated by some macho, ego
tistical will to maximize his own fame for
the history books, nor is he doing it for the
money, which is relatively little compared
to the money he has already made in his
career. Simply put, Bo loves the game. To
many, this is the true essence of athletics.
I love watching the Stanford athletes
that play for the same reason. Watch
Chris MacMurdo put in a full game of
intensity against opponents on the floor of
Maples Pavilion, and you'll know that

there's no place she'd rather be on Thursr
day night. See Mario Carruth pound ball
after ball over the net at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, and you'll understand that she's
not doing it for money. Neither of them
may ever go professional, or enjoy the
bounty of rewards that a Bo Jackson or
similar superstar may enjoy. Their only
reward after four years of sweat and hard
work might simply be the memories, and
the experience, at least for a short while,
of living their dreams.
