# Women's hoops looks for away wins
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
By the end of the season, the Cardinal
women's basketball team will have defi
nitely done its share of sightseeing.
With a busy weekend ahead, the Stan
ford squad (17-5, 8-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) travels to Los Angeles to play
UCLA tonight, and then heads to Con
necticut to play the Huskies on Saturday.
Against UCLA, the No. 10 Cardinal
hopes to rebound from a narrow defeat at
Berkeley last Friday. In that contest,
Stanford held a five-point advantage with
four minutes remaining before it self
destructed, losing to the Bears 64-59.
"No one likes losing to Cal," said Car
dinal coach Tara VanDerveer. "I thought
we played real hard. It's not something
you like to have happen, but I hope it
motivates peofie to work harder."
Stanford slipped past the Bruins, 79-
70, earlier this season at Maples Pavil
ion, but the Cardinal knows that winning
tends to become a little more difficult on
the road. In fact, Stanford has lost two
consecutive away games.
"It's tough to play on the road, espe
cially with a big crowd," said redshirt
freshman Bobbie Kelsey. "[But] if we
play like we're capable of playing,
whether we're on the road or at home,
we'll win."
VanDerveer admits that UCLA should
provide some tough competition, espe
cially if its star player, forward Natalie

Williams, has another one of her out
standing performances. The preseason
All-American leads the Pac-10 in scoring
and rebounding, averaging 22 points per
game and 14 boards per game.
"You've got to double-team her, force
her to pass the ball and keep her away
from the boards, "' said the eighth-year
coach of the Cardinal's defensive strategy.
Williams is not the only Bruin player
Stanford will be worrying about UCLA
has three other players who average in
double figures for scoring.
"They're not a one-dimensional
team," VanDerveer said. "You have to
work hard to stop their other players,
too."
However, UCLA's defense also has its
work cut out for it.
In the two teams' previous meeting,
Val Whiting, Molly Goodenbour and
Rachel Hemmer combined to score 64 of

Stanford's 79 total points. In addition,
the Cardinal squad ranks second in the
conference in scoring, with a 78 points
per game average.
A victory over the Bruins would keep
Stanford one-half game behind first
place USC (15-5, 8-3) in the Pac-10
standings as it travels to Connecticut to
play a non-conference game. According
to VanDerveer, it will be nice for the Car
dinal to have a break from the grueling
competition within the Pac-10.
"There's no pressure on our team in
terms of the conference championship,"
she said.
Nevertheless, the contest is still sig
nificant for Stanford, since it will be tele
vised nationally.
"It's real important that they televise
women's games because every [team is]
getting so much better," Kelsey said, "112
really hope that both teams play well." I
