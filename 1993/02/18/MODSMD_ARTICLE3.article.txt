# All you can eat, a la carte
## Dining halls debut the 'Dish' 
### Ajai Chari 
Hungry students can now satisfy
their appetite by dishing themselves
a heaping plateful of the "Dish."
Last week, the k la carte meal
programs at Stern Hall, Ricker Din
ing and Performance Center and
Kimball Cafe began offering a com
bination of vegetables, rice, and an
"all-you-can-eat" entree known as
the "Dish" for $3.95 or an equiva
lent number of Food Service points.
Craig Mitchell, the & la carte op
erations manager, said the Dish
was offered as part of a "general re
structuring of the menu process."
By expanding beyond the five
entries normally offered on the a
la carte plan, Mitchell said the
Dish exemplifies a "niche market
ing" strategy designed to focus on
different groups of students.
When talking to various stu
dents' groups and the student advi
sory committee for Food Service,
Mitchell said the & la carte manage
ment group received complaints

from hearty eaters, including many
athletes, who said they could not
get enough to eat for a reasonable
price. Food Service officials, he said,
then decided to offer an "all-you
can-eat" option and named it alter
the (satellite) Dish on campus.
Libby Long, manager of the
Kimball Cafe, said that the Dish
has been more popular than ex
pected. Mitchell said that some
times up to 150 portions have been
sold at a meal.
However, several Kimball resi
dents have expressed mixed reac
tions about the Dish.
"It's a rip-off like anything else
they sell because you can only put
a limited amount on each plate,"
said junior Jason Frogel.
Senior Steven Chang said that
— although he suspects the Dish
consists of leftovers — it is a good
program for people like him who
are hearty eaters and running out
of points.
Mitchell said that the Dish is
definitely not comprised of left

overs. He explained that ever since
the first week the Dish was of
fered, food has been made in ap
propriate quantities and leftovers
are no greater than for the tradi
tional entrees. If food is leftover,
he said the usual Food Service pol
icy is followed and, depending on
the quality of the food, it is either
sold at reduced price to students
the next day or donated to the
Spoon Hunger Relief Network.
Mitchell added that even light
eaters can benefit from the Dish,
since the offer sometimes includes
rice and vegetables.
Currently, the Dish is offered
several times a week during lunch
or dinner, and the entree varies
between approximately 15 differ
ent items including several kinds
of pasta, various casseroles, chow
mein and taco salads.
Future "niche marketing" pro
grams will include diet meal
plates, low fat and health con
scious dishes and meal combina
tions.
