## Can we separate sex & icepicks? 
### 
Time for the post-Valentine's Day blues.
Most of us couldn't get off our butts and
look for that one true love to spend it
with. What's wrong with us? Why are we so
afraid of relationships?
It's the movies. POst-AIDS movies, to be
exact. Since Michael Douglas swore off one
night stands with women sporting men's
names in "Fatal Attraction," the film industry

picked up and amplified our
fear of the dangers of sex in
post-AJDS America, ushering
in a new age of sexual puri
tanism. An age when illicit sex

buys a one-way ticket to Violent Death, U.S.A.
"Fatal Attraction" struck a nerve in the
American subconscious. Women used the
film to frighten their significant others into
monogamy. Talk shows titillated viewers with
real-life fatal attractions. The film was even
nominated for the Best Picture of 1987.
Not since the film noir flicks of the '40s had
sex been so deadly. Glenn Close just couldn't
get enough of Michael Douglas' good stuffbe
cause her biological clock was ticking like a
time bomb. And to ensure that we sided with
the family, the good wife vanquished the psy
chotic career woman with a bullet between
the breasts. Praise Dan Quayle and pass the
ammo.
The success of "Fatal Attraction" threw the
floodgates wide open. Between 1988 and
1991, several such 'erotic thrillers' were re
leased, including "Blue Velvet," "Angel Heart,"
"Dangerous Liaisons," and "Cape Fear." The
message was out: sex will kill you.
But in 1992, "Basic Instinct" recognized
that the national mood wasn't just fearful any
more — it was paranoiac. Not only might
your latest boy-toy kill you just as you reached

N' Gai Croal

orgasm, but she could have a lesbian girlfriend
on the side, sleep with your female psychia
trist and kill your partner. Then she'd write a
book about it.
Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram Stoker's
Dracula" linked sex with death even more in
extricably. The sexually promiscuous Lucy
gets ravished by the half-wolf, half-man incar
nation of Dracula — a la "Beauty and the

Beast"—turned into a vam
pire and subsequently de
capitated. But Mina, who re
sists the Count's hypnotic
advances, survives with both

her throat and her virginity intact.
The film also makes the AIDS connection
more explicit than ever before. Coppola fre
quently inserts random closeups of red blood
cells as transitions between scenes. Dracula at
tempts to turn Mina into a vampire by having
her drink the secretions from an open wound
on his chest — an STD that Sex Ed never
warned us about.
1993 promises us more of the same. Where
Sharon Stone required an icepick, Madonna
only needed her body to "fornicate" her lover
to death in the laughable "Body of Evidence."
Demi Moore stars in the upcoming "Indecent
Proposal," as a woman whose husband is of
fered one million dollars in exchange for one
night of her company. And Ms. Stone's pubic
hair will once again be displayed in all its nat
ural blonde glory in "Sliver," which the director
assures us will "make 'Basic Instinct' look like a
Sunday-school training film." Hip hop hooray.
Still afraid of intimacy? Now you know why.
But don't worry about it. Just throw on a big
body condom, hop in the car and catch the lat
est erotic thriller at your local cineplex. Alone.
It's much safer that way.
