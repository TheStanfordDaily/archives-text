## A 						selected guide to local theater groups 
### 
What does one want more from a
commentator/critic than opin
ions? So here they are — my
thoughts about the major theater groups on
campus and in the area. Remember, the
quality of any given show is often unrelated
to the organization's track record.
Asian American Theater Project
Inconsistent both in frequency of shows and
in quality thereof. Their

most recent produc
tion, "Performance
Anxiety," was quite

good — a definite step
in the right direction after a painfully bad
production of "The Crucible" last year.
Committee on Black Performing Arts
One show a year is all it takes for this group to
justify their existence. Great performers,
great material, great direction—great shows.
The Drama Department
By far the most frequent supplier of theater,
their shows seem to vary on a scale that
ranges from interesting to dull more than
from good to bad. Euripedes' "Suppliant
Women," which inhabits Memorial Audito
rium until Feb. 28, is the most interesting
and impressive show the Drama Depart
ment has produced recently — a must-see
for anyone with $ 15.
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
That 80-year-old monster of an organiza
tion — they put on three shows a year, as
well as occasional special projects. Gai
eties — no matter how bad it is, everyone
goes. Original Winter One Acts — consis
tently interesting, occasionally awesome
(last year's "Night Baseball.") Spring
Show ("West Side Story" this year) — al
ways good, sometimes great, always

worth going.
Savoyards
A student organization in name only, they
produce two Gilbert and Sullivan shows a
year and do them fairly well, except they al
ways seem to be performing more for them
selves than the audience.
Women's Performance Collective
These women do impressive shows each
quarter with astute mes-

sages and obviously
enjoy what they're
doing. While occasional-

ly too didactic, their
shows shouldn't be passed up nonetheless.
This weekend, the wonderful actress Bridget
Evans performs in"The Moonshot Tape" in
the Eleanor Prosser Studio.
Stanford Improvisors/Spontaneous Gener
ation
One's the Drama Department's, the other is
Ram's Head's — they both do excellent im
prov.
American Conservatory Theater
A San Francisco powerhouse of "serious
theater," most of their shows are pretty good,
even if they occasionally blow it. ACT tends
to do more "mainstream" material (relative
to the Stanford Drama Department, for ex
ample). Currently, Robert Woodruff's
avant-garde "The Duchess of Malfi" is send
ing people out the exit doors faster than you
can say "misogyny."
Theater Works
The peninsula theater group's shows rarely
disappoint. But odds are they'll never blow
you away either. Their current production,
"Theme & Variations," is a poignant piece
with some rough spots, but all-in-all a good
show.
