## STANFORD THEATRE CELEBRATES AUDREY HEPBURN'S LIFE AND WORKS WITH A FIVE-WEEK FILM FESTIVAL TO BENEFIT UNICEF

T think the Lord sent Audrey Hepburn
I down to the earth as a special consola-
X tion for all of our problems," said Stan
ford alumnus David Packard, owner of the
Stanford Theatre and an expert on classic
films. "I think it's possible. We'll have to find
out."
Indeed, you'll have the chance to find out
during the next month. Beginning tomorrow,
the Stanford Theatre is having a five-week Au
drey Hepburn Film Festival, donating all the
proceeds to UNICEF, in recognition of the
well-loved actress's humanitarian work.
Although her recent death has thrust Hep
burn's life into the public spotlight, the Stan
ford Theatre Foundation already had con
ceived of the festival three weeks before Hep
burn died. Packard presented the idea to her
in a letter, to which she responded enthusias
tically.
"So we know we have her blessings," he
said.
Why wouldn't they, considering the great
help the five-week fund-raiser will be to
UNICEF, her lifetime cause?
Hepburn has pulled the heartstrings of the
public not only as a dynamic actress, but as a
noble person. As a child, she was trapped in
Holland during the Nazi invasion of 1940. Re
fusing to join the Nazi youth group, she gave
dancing lessons in secret to raise money for
the Dutch Resistance, distributed anti-Nazi
literature and brought food to downed Allied
pilots who were hiding in local homes.
Fame and fortune in no way blunted the
sense of compassion that Hepburn's child
hood taught her. As she explained in People
magazine, she was raised with "that wonder
ful, old-fashioned idea that... others matter
more than you do, so 'don't fuss, dear; get on
with it.'"
Which is just what she did. In 1988, she
joined UNICEF full-time. As an official Good
will Ambassador, she traveled to many starv
ing, war-torn countries, returning to describe
what she had seen in order to raise money for
those in need.
In 1992 she received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom. At this year's Academy
Awards in March, she will posthumously re
ceive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.
But Audrey Hepburn played down both
her saintliness and her acting ability alike.
"She always said acting wasn't that impor
tant to her, and that her family and person
al life were more important," said Packard,
who saw her speak at the Commonwealth
Club in January of 1992. When she spoke of
herself, he said, "She had this incredible nat
uralness. There was nothing calculated
about her."
Although he denies it, perhaps Packard
can relate to Audrey Hepburn on a higher
level than most. He himself has performed
many good works for the local community,
most notably saving the vintage 1925 Stan
ford Theatre from near destruction in 1989.

With the financial support of the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, he turned the
theater into a non-profit institution for the
preservation of classic film.
Driven by the desire to provide people
with the chance to see quality 35 mm classic
films in their authentic setting, Packard him
self directed the lavish reconstruction and
has since had both hands in every aspect of
the theater's management.
Aside from the Stanford Theatre, enough
of a project to fill a lifetime, Packard also
played an integral role in conceiving of and
raising funds to build the Monterey Bay
Aquarium. Before that, he invented a com
puter software program teaching scholars
Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and he also taught
the classics as a professor at UCLA and the
University of North Carolina.
"I used to be a professor. Now I'm just an
old man enjoying movies," he said. Like Hep
burn, he plays down his good works and fo
cuses instead on the importance of classic
films.
Contrary to the popular claim, he says:
"Hollywood movies didn't all have happy
endings, but it is true that for the most part
they didn't make you feel ashamed to be a
human being. You come out of the movies,
even if you're sad, somehow feeling a little bit
uplifted, a little bit better about yourself or
your life.
"Recently, people seem to feel the way to
judge a movie is by whether it realistically
portrays human nature. There's a place for
that... but I don't think that's essentially
what movies are about. I think movies are
about helping people find something that
makes their lives more livable."
But Packard enjoys lighthearted films as
well as noble, heroic ones — and he admires
Audrey Hepburn equally in both: "When you
love a character like Audrey Hepburn in a
movie, [even if] she plays a young girl who's

a little bit naive ... you still feel that you
somehow understand her and you know that,
when confronted with the occasion, she'll be
worthy.
"You just know she's the kind of person
who would go help starving children in
Africa if she were in the position to do it."
The festival will feature 18 of Hepburn's 26
films, some more well-known than others.
The classic "Breakfast at Tiffany's," in which
Audrey Hepburn acts endearingly unpre
dictable as the madcap Holly Golightly, will
open the festival Friday night. Other favorites
include "Funny Face," "Roman Holiday" and
"My Fair Lady."
"The Nun's Story" and"The Secret Peo

pie," on the other hand, have not been shown
in the United States in years. The Stanford
Theatre commissioned a new print of "The
Secret People" from the original nitrate neg
ative in London especially for the festival.
Packard said he expects to raise $100,000,
and that it will be the theater's best attended
festival yet. In his words, "People love Audrey
Hepburn."
He urges students to attend the festival.
"Someday the films of the '30s and '40s will
be recognized as the great creations of 20th
century America,"he says."It was the golden
age of American film."
Besides, it'll provide a chance to find out
whether Audrey Hepburn really is a saint. ■
