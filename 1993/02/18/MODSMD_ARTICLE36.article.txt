# Who's afraid of Babak Ebrahimian?
## 
### 
Up behind the Knoll, in a trailer
marked A3, Babak Ebrahimian and
his ensemble, the Experimental
Theater Laboratory, are dishing out slices of
mind-twisting American pie on a Saturday
afternoon.
As an excited Ebrahimian darts around
the room shouting directions, actors and
actresses slide across the floor enacting a jin
goisms worse nightmare.
The statue of liberty continually collapses
and rises with her torch ... an American
broadcast journalist checks her lipstick as
she attempts to interview a corpse on for
eign 50i1... a neglected housewife in a neg
ligee serves her husband breakfast, sends
him out the door, tips over his chair and
copulates with the chair leg as Louis
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"
plays in the background.
In a rehearsal of "Fragments of America,"
currently running in San Francisco at the
Mission Theater through Feb. 28, director
Ebrahimian and his ensemble turn the
American Dream on its head, through a
series of visual tableaux depicting a decaying
nation of spiritually decrepit individuals.
"I will not show you the shocking parts,"
Ebrahimian says, laughing. After five pro
ductions and three years at Stanford, the 25-
year-old director has come to expect a cer
tain sensationalistic response to his shows.
"Experimental theater always tends to be
a little wacked oat compared to normal the
ater. People don't normally see it. It's always
in the margins. So when people see it, they
go, 'Huh, bunch of freaks.' They don't know
there's a lot of process that goes into it,"says
Ebrahimian, who also directed and pro
duced "Fragments of a Revolution,"
"Hamlet Machine," "The Wedding," "The
Exception and the Rule" and "City of
Refuge."
Junior Mike Nichols, who has acted in all
of in Ebrahimian's projects, emphasizes the
uniqueness of the productions, an avant
garde theater style seldom found on the
stages of Stanford, or San Francisco for that
matter.
"That makes him popular to some extent;
he does things that people would consider
unorthodox, having things like nudity and
addressing subjects that aren't necessarily
addressed on stage," he explains. Ebrahimian
"uses things like complete soundtracks, sound
motion, freezing, a lot of lights."
Of the five sold-out plays, "City of
Refuge," which was based on the letters of
the Marquis de Sade and staged in the men's
bathroom behind Memorial Church, is per
haps the most well-known.
"It became a cause cel&bre and a scandal
to some extent because the cast members
were all naked," says Prof. Carl Weber of the
drama department, the translator of Hamlet
Machine. "It had a shock effect, but in gen
eral was very successful, very well-done.
Babak has a great sense of visual element
and of theater, and he is inventive. [He]
comes up with very interesting visual
imagery."
Ebrahimian views the sensationalistic
response to the nudity in his productions as
absurd, nonplussed by what he terms the
"constipation" of the Stanford campus.
"What's wrong with nudity? Why all this
constipation?" he asks, throwing up his
hands in exasperation. "It's not intended to

be done in a shocking way. It's done for aes
thetics, never with erotic overtones. People
were at it left and right in the '60s in a much
more severe and harsh way... naked bodies
literally flicking on stage ... there is nothing
new with that."
Engendering far more curiosity and criti
cism than the nudity, however, is the ensem
ble itself. With its rigorous, unorthodox
method of actor-training, and its tightly knit
troop of actors attired in pitch-black, the
Experimental Theater Lab emanates a harsh
intensity that seems anomalous to the idyllic

Californian campus.
"It is a cross between ROTC and Zen,"
Ebrahimian describes. "At one point you
have to be like a Zen Buddhist: very well
focused and well-concentrated.
"On the other hand, you have to be in
very excellent shape, to be able to jog and do
120 pushups. I ask a lot from people.
Sometimes what I want to do with my actors
will freak some of the people and they drop
out."
Of those who did drop, Gennie Ruskus
— a senior who was with the group for one

quarter, two years ago — recalls
Ebrahimian's theater as very confrontation
al: "For myself, 1 reached a point where I
was no longer able to enjoy it; it became too
painful."
Ruskus also found her reluctance to try
nudity at odds with Ebrahimian's acting
demands: "At first, it was a kind of joke. 'Oh
Gennie, you're so constipated,' he would say,
but he did pressure me for months. He felt
it was my 'block.' "
Ruskus likens the ensemble to a kind of
cult, in which the actors were manipulated
by Ebrahimian: "One thing that's very
telling is that he chose a group of 23 people
who had had no acting experience, who
were very much of the virgin-mold. We had
no clue that we would have to become his
disciples and succumb to his vision."
The notion of a cult vision has even
given birth to a new vocabulary: "Babakish"
attitudes, "Babakian" beliefs and
"Babakites," those who follow the group.
Often painted as a theater guru of the black
turtleneck set on campus, the director
almost has become a paradigm for "artsi
ness" and all its mystique, a paradigm much
to his distaste.
"They just replace the word 'ensemble'
with 'cult,'" says Ebrahimian. "6 (a.m.) in
the quad. It's a commitment of time to art,
to theater, to being on time, to being dressed
in black. It's not a matter of looking artsy.
It's a matter of everyone looking neutral.
"Why? Because we rehearse 'til 4 in the
morning sometimes. Why? Because we
rehearse outside, inside, anywhere," he con
tinues. "From the outside, people can say it's
basically a cult, and I resent that because it's
an ensemble. Brecht had an ensemble. In
Europe the kind of theater we do would be
very normal."
Senior Kaki Bernard, who has worked
with Ebrahimian for two years, also pointed
out that, in Europe, nudity and the model of
the ensemble would not draw such attention
or sensational rumors.
"I'm really baffled," she says, shaking her
head. "If there is one thing I want to demysti
fy, it's that this is some kind of clan or cult.
We're people who work together. We like
him. We like each other. He gives us a great
deal of respect as actors."
Ebrahimian's adviser, Prof. Jean-Marie
Apostilides of the French and Italian dept,
believes that the impressions of the cult
stem from a misinterpretation of the direc
tor's personality.
"I think it is a misconception, this cult,"
says Apostilides, the author of "City of
Refuge." "Babak has a lot of charisma. He
has an energy uncommon in even this pro
fession — an absolutely passionate force. I
consider it a unique gift to work with him."
With his tousle of black hair and exclam
atory eyes, Ebrahimian possesses a kind of
dark vivacity, an aura of someone who has
experienced more than the average twen
tysomething American.
Born in Iran, the 25-year-old director
lived through the country's revolution, emi
grating first to Paris in 1980, and then to
New York in 1984, where he majored in
math and comparative literature as an
undergraduate at Cornell. He describes his
final cultural shock as that between the East
and West Coast.
"People are just sort of really, really nice
