# Who's afraid of Babak Ebrahimian?
## 
### 
Up behind the Knoll, in a trailer
marked A3, Babak Ebrahimian and
his ensemble, the Experimental
Theater Laboratory, are dishing out slices of
mind-twisting American pie on a Saturday
afternoon.
As an excited Ebrahimian darts around
the room shouting directions, actors and
actresses slide across the floor enacting a jin
goisms worse nightmare.
The statue of liberty continually collapses
and rises with her torch ... an American
broadcast journalist checks her lipstick as
she attempts to interview a corpse on for
eign 50i1... a neglected housewife in a neg
ligee serves her husband breakfast, sends
him out the door, tips over his chair and
copulates with the chair leg as Louis
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"
plays in the background.
In a rehearsal of "Fragments of America,"
currently running in San Francisco at the
Mission Theater through Feb. 28, director
Ebrahimian and his ensemble turn the
American Dream on its head, through a
series of visual tableaux depicting a decaying
nation of spiritually decrepit individuals.
"I will not show you the shocking parts,"
Ebrahimian says, laughing. After five pro
ductions and three years at Stanford, the 25-
year-old director has come to expect a cer
tain sensationalistic response to his shows.
"Experimental theater always tends to be
a little wacked oat compared to normal the
ater. People don't normally see it. It's always
in the margins. So when people see it, they
go, 'Huh, bunch of freaks.' They don't know
there's a lot of process that goes into it,"says
Ebrahimian, who also directed and pro
duced "Fragments of a Revolution,"
"Hamlet Machine," "The Wedding," "The
Exception and the Rule" and "City of
Refuge."
Junior Mike Nichols, who has acted in all
of in Ebrahimian's projects, emphasizes the
uniqueness of the productions, an avant
garde theater style seldom found on the
stages of Stanford, or San Francisco for that
matter.
"That makes him popular to some extent;
he does things that people would consider
unorthodox, having things like nudity and
addressing subjects that aren't necessarily
addressed on stage," he explains. Ebrahimian
"uses things like complete soundtracks, sound
motion, freezing, a lot of lights."
Of the five sold-out plays, "City of
Refuge," which was based on the letters of
the Marquis de Sade and staged in the men's
bathroom behind Memorial Church, is per
haps the most well-known.
"It became a cause cel&bre and a scandal
to some extent because the cast members
were all naked," says Prof. Carl Weber of the
drama department, the translator of Hamlet
Machine. "It had a shock effect, but in gen
eral was very successful, very well-done.
Babak has a great sense of visual element
and of theater, and he is inventive. [He]
comes up with very interesting visual
imagery."
Ebrahimian views the sensationalistic
response to the nudity in his productions as
absurd, nonplussed by what he terms the
"constipation" of the Stanford campus.
"What's wrong with nudity? Why all this
constipation?" he asks, throwing up his
hands in exasperation. "It's not intended to

be done in a shocking way. It's done for aes
thetics, never with erotic overtones. People
were at it left and right in the '60s in a much
more severe and harsh way... naked bodies
literally flicking on stage ... there is nothing
new with that."
Engendering far more curiosity and criti
cism than the nudity, however, is the ensem
ble itself. With its rigorous, unorthodox
method of actor-training, and its tightly knit
troop of actors attired in pitch-black, the
Experimental Theater Lab emanates a harsh
intensity that seems anomalous to the idyllic

Californian campus.
"It is a cross between ROTC and Zen,"
Ebrahimian describes. "At one point you
have to be like a Zen Buddhist: very well
focused and well-concentrated.
"On the other hand, you have to be in
very excellent shape, to be able to jog and do
120 pushups. I ask a lot from people.
Sometimes what I want to do with my actors
will freak some of the people and they drop
out."
Of those who did drop, Gennie Ruskus
— a senior who was with the group for one

quarter, two years ago — recalls
Ebrahimian's theater as very confrontation
al: "For myself, 1 reached a point where I
was no longer able to enjoy it; it became too
painful."
Ruskus also found her reluctance to try
nudity at odds with Ebrahimian's acting
demands: "At first, it was a kind of joke. 'Oh
Gennie, you're so constipated,' he would say,
but he did pressure me for months. He felt
it was my 'block.' "
Ruskus likens the ensemble to a kind of
cult, in which the actors were manipulated
by Ebrahimian: "One thing that's very
telling is that he chose a group of 23 people
who had had no acting experience, who
were very much of the virgin-mold. We had
no clue that we would have to become his
disciples and succumb to his vision."
The notion of a cult vision has even
given birth to a new vocabulary: "Babakish"
attitudes, "Babakian" beliefs and
"Babakites," those who follow the group.
Often painted as a theater guru of the black
turtleneck set on campus, the director
almost has become a paradigm for "artsi
ness" and all its mystique, a paradigm much
to his distaste.
"They just replace the word 'ensemble'
with 'cult,'" says Ebrahimian. "6 (a.m.) in
the quad. It's a commitment of time to art,
to theater, to being on time, to being dressed
in black. It's not a matter of looking artsy.
It's a matter of everyone looking neutral.
"Why? Because we rehearse 'til 4 in the
morning sometimes. Why? Because we
rehearse outside, inside, anywhere," he con
tinues. "From the outside, people can say it's
basically a cult, and I resent that because it's
an ensemble. Brecht had an ensemble. In
Europe the kind of theater we do would be
very normal."
Senior Kaki Bernard, who has worked
with Ebrahimian for two years, also pointed
out that, in Europe, nudity and the model of
the ensemble would not draw such attention
or sensational rumors.
"I'm really baffled," she says, shaking her
head. "If there is one thing I want to demysti
fy, it's that this is some kind of clan or cult.
We're people who work together. We like
him. We like each other. He gives us a great
deal of respect as actors."
Ebrahimian's adviser, Prof. Jean-Marie
Apostilides of the French and Italian dept,
believes that the impressions of the cult
stem from a misinterpretation of the direc
tor's personality.
"I think it is a misconception, this cult,"
says Apostilides, the author of "City of
Refuge." "Babak has a lot of charisma. He
has an energy uncommon in even this pro
fession — an absolutely passionate force. I
consider it a unique gift to work with him."
With his tousle of black hair and exclam
atory eyes, Ebrahimian possesses a kind of
dark vivacity, an aura of someone who has
experienced more than the average twen
tysomething American.
Born in Iran, the 25-year-old director
lived through the country's revolution, emi
grating first to Paris in 1980, and then to
New York in 1984, where he majored in
math and comparative literature as an
undergraduate at Cornell. He describes his
final cultural shock as that between the East
and West Coast.
"People are just sort of really, really nice

• . . and his enigmatic personality

out here, and that just can be really
nerve-wracking," Babak says. "Nice,
super-friendly for no reason. A mask.
Maybe it's not a mask, maybe I'm
just too cynical sometimes. I'm try
ing to shed my cynicism; after having
gone through a revolution, your
head does get a little bit messed up.
"When you are 12 years old and
you see a street literally filled with
millions of people with their fists up
in the air, and their faces red with
anger screaming, death to so-and
so, the Shah, the U.S. —that's some
thing that stays with you.
"People talk about their friends
from third-grade. 1 don't have a
friend from third-grade. In that
sense, theater is my refuge."
Within this world of refuge,
Babak finds himself drawn to the
visual dynamics of European aes
thetics, preferring the German and
French drama to the largely psycho
logical American-theater tradition.
"When I go to the theater I want
to see a spectacle, another world,
time, reality — not something I'd
ordinarily see on the street,"
Ebrahimian says. "Or if I do see it
on the street, the theater should
shed new light on it.
"Let's say a man is vomiting on
the street. If I were to see that on
stage done correctly, a man would
puke and stand up, then puke and
stand up, and do this 100 times
until I will start to think, 'Why
doesn't he stop? Maybe I will
become nauseated.' Perhaps the
spectator will actually start puking.
"So next time I walk down the
street and see someone puking, I
won't just walk by and close my
eyes. That's the power of theater."
Although Ebrahimian does not
consider himself to be an overtly
political person, his social and polit
ical beliefs run through many
strands of his work.
"Sometimes my political buttons
do get pressed, and I get upset,"
Ebrahimian says."The war with
Iraq two years ago really disturbed
me. I got psychologically disturbed."
As a statement against the war,
Ebrahimian did a performance piece
in the Coffee House in which, while
dressed in black, he carried in a
newspaper bundle, sat down beside
an image of then-President Bush
projected on a screen, and began
unwrapping bits of the bundle,
eventually revealing a peace sign:
"People who were near me began
to leave because they thought I was a
terrorist of some kind," he says,
adding that someone even called
security.
"I resent the apathy around here,"
Ebrahimian says, describing Stanford
as a cross between a monastery and a
hospital where everyone is "under
general anaesthesia.
"You have basically an entire
campus that is just going around
'zzzzzzzzz,' " he says, jerking his fin
gers up and down to mimic a con

sciousness-shock register. "BEAN
SPROUTS . . . buzz . . .
ROLLERBLADES ... buzz ... the
world ... fizz ... ACADEMICS ...
buzz, Somalia, Bosnia, apathy, apa
thy, apathy, trivial, trivial, trivial
"So what does that do? That
makes someone like me who is an
'artist' be a little bit more socially or
politically active in what I do. If I
were in an area where everyone was
more active in art and more socially
aware, chances are I would have done
something more light and fun."
Although junior Tom Ranese
admires Ebrahimian's ability to con
vey social ideals through his theater,
he questions Ebrahimian's interac
tions with people: "At first it was
very exciting doing this kind of the
ater, but I became discouraged
when 1 saw that even though he had
these ideals of art changing society,
he seemed to have a lack of under
standing for human beings contra
dicting his goals.
"He was very dogmatic. He
didn't give room for any personal
lives," continues Ranese, who acted
in the ensemble for two quarters.
Ebrahimian acknowledges that
his disdain for Stanford, coupled
with his demanding personality,

have won him no popularity con
tests among the drama community.
"I have a very strong personality,
I can be very arrogant. I made a lot
of enemies my first year at the
drama department, and that con
tributed to this 'aura' of the cult,"
says Ebrahimian, who transferred to
the French and Italian department
last year after four quarters as a
drama student.
"In any grad program there is a
two-year probation state, after which
a number of professors must in
good conscience agree to work with
the student in order for that student
to be promoted to the next level of
graduate study," says Ron Davies, the
department administrator, who
made it clear that he was not speak
ing for the drama department.
"Babak felt it was in his best
interest to transfer," he continues.
"In that sense we didn't 'kick him
out* — unless you describe it as
someone walking out a door, and
you rush to kick him from behind
just as he's leaving."
"In the final analysis, it was very
much a mismatch," Davies says.
"The kind of things he wanted to do
were incompatible with the acade
mic setting, and I don't think it's

just the Stanford academic setting."
Davies cites Ebrahimian's
requirement that actors "live, eat,
breathe and die" theater as one of
the factors in conflict with depart
mental philosophy — actors should
"have regular lives, with academics
and other extracurricular activities."
Davies also notes that Ebra
himian had no reservations about
making a theatrical scene in the
middle of an academic class, but
declines to elaborate, choosing to
say instead, Ebrahimian "has a
strange view of the appropriate."
"I had intellectual and artistic
disagreements with some of the
people," Ebrahimian recalls, "It's all
worked out for the better because
I'm still able to team up with the
people I want to work with."
"Besides Carl (Weber), who was
sympathetic to the land of theater he
was doing, [Babak] didn't seem to be
interested in other professors' ideas
always," Davies says."He really pushed
our system. But we have no axe to
grind, because [Babak has] found a
better venue where he has more free
dom and latitude to do his work."
Weber agrees: "He is a pretty
temperamental young man at times,
and I'm sure he caused some prob
lems for himself by not necessarily
brushing people the right way. I'm
not talking about myself. I never
had run-ins. But I pretty much
know people who had. But yes, it's
calmed down."
Matthew Causey, a third-year
graduate student in Drama who
also works with experimental the
ater, and who produced "Laboratory
of Hallucinations" last year, says
people exaggerate the nature of
Ebrahimian's conflicts with the
drama department:

"He's a misun
derstood youth
that's just feeling
his oats; he needs
our understanding.
Let's just create
theater and let the
personalities go.
One thing the
drama department
doesn't need with
all the budget cuts,
is to be seen as not
supportive of the
avant-garde. It is
very supportive.
"Some people
have a charisma;
For better or worse,
Babak has it,"
Causey continues,
adding that most
"are scared of peo
ple who are getting
work done."

Some say, however, a dogmatic
egoist caught up in the overwhelm
ing drama of his own beliefs lies
alongside the charisma.
"As one of my professors used to
say, a lot of people in theater make it
about themselves. People who stay
will realize sooner or later that the
art is bigger than they are," says
Lance Miller, a fourth-year graduate

'From the
outside, people
can say it's
basically a
Cult, and I
resent that
because it's an
ensemble.
Brecht had an
ensemble.'
— Babak

student in Drama.
"One of his favorite phrases is
that theater should be a mind-fuck,"
Ruskus says. "One should leave the
performance feeling shaken up and
reevaluate [his or her] ideology.
[Ebrahimian's] theater doesn't really
give you much to go on beyond the
shock."
Although some say Ebrahimian's
theater possesses little substance —
that it is too laden with theory for
the average viewer to comprehend
— Nichols insists the theater is not
one that caters to intellectuals in an
elitist fashion.
"You have a certain set of people
who come: intellectuals, professors
of literature and drama ... students
who come for the aesthetics or have
heard something sensational about
it,"he says. "1 don't think it caters to
a particular audience ... what stays
with you are the images . . .it
doesn't have to have a solid, dried
meaning, but just a picture that
stays your mind."
It is that singular, provoking
Babakian picture that has made an
impact on campus that even some
of his critics admire. If the task of
art is, as Ebrahimian says, "to hit
people's chords on an emotional, or
cerebral level ... to let them deci
pher or just feel," he has been largely
successful.
"Even though I didn't enjoy
working with him, I consider it a
favorable memory," Ranese says.
"His avant-garde is very unique at
Stanford. It can provoke and make
people socially aware. I like that. It
maybe influenced groups such as
the Women's Performance
Collective."
Ruskus adds, "The theater he is
doing is very valid; it broadens hori-

zons. ine roie
needs to be ful
filled because no
one else is doing
it." Ebrahimian
sounds dubious,
even morose as
he talks about
the state of the
ater today: "We
make art out to
be a luxury. No
one quite cares
about the arts.
They watch TV.
They watch
schlock films.
They read People
Magazine. No
one cares. The
ater is as bad as
poetry. Theater is
dead," he pro
nounces gloomily.
If that is

true, at least the controversial direc
tor has made attempts to resurrect
the place he calls his refuge in a
manner that is distinctly "Babak."
"Certainly everything he has
done has a very personal stamp to it.
It is very unique, not something you
see in many places," Weber says."He
is trying to find a voice, but eventu
ally he will be a voice." ■

"Babak felt it was in his best
interest to transfer," he continues.
"In that sense we didn't 'kick him
out* — unless you describe it as
someone walking out a door, and
you rush to kick him from behind
just as he's leaving."
"In the final analysis, it was very
much a mismatch," Davies says.
"The kind of things he wanted to do
were incompatible with the acade
mic setting, and I don't think it's

just the Stanford academic setting."
Davies cites Ebrahimian's
requirement that actors "live, eat,
breathe and die" theater as one of
the factors in conflict with depart
mental philosophy — actors should
"have regular lives, with academics
and other extracurricular activities."
Davies also notes that Ebra
himian had no reservations about
making a theatrical scene in the
middle of an academic class, but
declines to elaborate, choosing to
say instead, Ebrahimian "has a
strange view of the appropriate."
"I had intellectual and artistic
disagreements with some of the
people," Ebrahimian recalls, "It's all
worked out for the better because
I'm still able to team up with the
people I want to work with."
"Besides Carl (Weber), who was
sympathetic to the land of theater he
was doing, [Babak] didn't seem to be
interested in other professors' ideas
always," Davies says."He really pushed
our system. But we have no axe to
grind, because [Babak has] found a
better venue where he has more free
dom and latitude to do his work."
Weber agrees: "He is a pretty
temperamental young man at times,
and I'm sure he caused some prob
lems for himself by not necessarily
brushing people the right way. I'm
not talking about myself. I never
had run-ins. But I pretty much
know people who had. But yes, it's
calmed down."
Matthew Causey, a third-year
graduate student in Drama who
also works with experimental the
ater, and who produced "Laboratory
of Hallucinations" last year, says
people exaggerate the nature of
Ebrahimian's conflicts with the
drama department:

"He's a misun
derstood youth
that's just feeling
his oats; he needs
our understanding.
Let's just create
theater and let the
personalities go.
One thing the
drama department
doesn't need with
all the budget cuts,
is to be seen as not
supportive of the
avant-garde. It is
very supportive.
"Some people
have a charisma;
For better or worse,
Babak has it,"
Causey continues,
adding that most
"are scared of peo
ple who are getting
work done."

Some say, however, a dogmatic
egoist caught up in the overwhelm
ing drama of his own beliefs lies
alongside the charisma.
"As one of my professors used to
say, a lot of people in theater make it
about themselves. People who stay
will realize sooner or later that the
art is bigger than they are," says
Lance Miller, a fourth-year graduate

'From the
outside, people
can say it's
basically a
Cult, and I
resent that
because it's an
ensemble.
Brecht had an
ensemble.'
— Babak

student in Drama.
"One of his favorite phrases is
that theater should be a mind-fuck,"
Ruskus says. "One should leave the
performance feeling shaken up and
reevaluate [his or her] ideology.
[Ebrahimian's] theater doesn't really
give you much to go on beyond the
shock."
Although some say Ebrahimian's
theater possesses little substance —
that it is too laden with theory for
the average viewer to comprehend
— Nichols insists the theater is not
one that caters to intellectuals in an
elitist fashion.
"You have a certain set of people
who come: intellectuals, professors
of literature and drama ... students
who come for the aesthetics or have
heard something sensational about
it,"he says. "1 don't think it caters to
a particular audience ... what stays
with you are the images . . .it
doesn't have to have a solid, dried
meaning, but just a picture that
stays your mind."
It is that singular, provoking
Babakian picture that has made an
impact on campus that even some
of his critics admire. If the task of
art is, as Ebrahimian says, "to hit
people's chords on an emotional, or
cerebral level ... to let them deci
pher or just feel," he has been largely
successful.
"Even though I didn't enjoy
working with him, I consider it a
favorable memory," Ranese says.
"His avant-garde is very unique at
Stanford. It can provoke and make
people socially aware. I like that. It
maybe influenced groups such as
the Women's Performance
Collective."
Ruskus adds, "The theater he is
doing is very valid; it broadens hori-

zons. ine roie
needs to be ful
filled because no
one else is doing
it." Ebrahimian
sounds dubious,
even morose as
he talks about
the state of the
ater today: "We
make art out to
be a luxury. No
one quite cares
about the arts.
They watch TV.
They watch
schlock films.
They read People
Magazine. No
one cares. The
ater is as bad as
poetry. Theater is
dead," he pro
nounces gloomily.
If that is

true, at least the controversial direc
tor has made attempts to resurrect
the place he calls his refuge in a
manner that is distinctly "Babak."
"Certainly everything he has
done has a very personal stamp to it.
It is very unique, not something you
see in many places," Weber says."He
is trying to find a voice, but eventu
ally he will be a voice." ■

Up behind the Knoll, in a trailer
marked A3, Babak Ebrahimian and
his ensemble, the Experimental
Theater Laboratory, are dishing out slices of
mind-twisting American pie on a Saturday
afternoon.
As an excited Ebrahimian darts around
the room shouting directions, actors and
actresses slide across the floor enacting a jin
goisms worse nightmare.
The statue of liberty continually collapses
and rises with her torch ... an American
broadcast journalist checks her lipstick as
she attempts to interview a corpse on for
eign 50i1... a neglected housewife in a neg
ligee serves her husband breakfast, sends
him out the door, tips over his chair and
copulates with the chair leg as Louis
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"
plays in the background.
In a rehearsal of "Fragments of America,"
currently running in San Francisco at the
Mission Theater through Feb. 28, director
Ebrahimian and his ensemble turn the
American Dream on its head, through a
series of visual tableaux depicting a decaying
nation of spiritually decrepit individuals.
"I will not show you the shocking parts,"
Ebrahimian says, laughing. After five pro
ductions and three years at Stanford, the 25-
year-old director has come to expect a cer
tain sensationalistic response to his shows.
"Experimental theater always tends to be
a little wacked oat compared to normal the
ater. People don't normally see it. It's always
in the margins. So when people see it, they
go, 'Huh, bunch of freaks.' They don't know
there's a lot of process that goes into it,"says
Ebrahimian, who also directed and pro
duced "Fragments of a Revolution,"
"Hamlet Machine," "The Wedding," "The
Exception and the Rule" and "City of
Refuge."
Junior Mike Nichols, who has acted in all
of in Ebrahimian's projects, emphasizes the
uniqueness of the productions, an avant
garde theater style seldom found on the
stages of Stanford, or San Francisco for that
matter.
"That makes him popular to some extent;
he does things that people would consider
unorthodox, having things like nudity and
addressing subjects that aren't necessarily
addressed on stage," he explains. Ebrahimian
"uses things like complete soundtracks, sound
motion, freezing, a lot of lights."
Of the five sold-out plays, "City of
Refuge," which was based on the letters of
the Marquis de Sade and staged in the men's
bathroom behind Memorial Church, is per
haps the most well-known.
"It became a cause cel&bre and a scandal
to some extent because the cast members
were all naked," says Prof. Carl Weber of the
drama department, the translator of Hamlet
Machine. "It had a shock effect, but in gen
eral was very successful, very well-done.
Babak has a great sense of visual element
and of theater, and he is inventive. [He]
comes up with very interesting visual
imagery."
Ebrahimian views the sensationalistic
response to the nudity in his productions as
absurd, nonplussed by what he terms the
"constipation" of the Stanford campus.
"What's wrong with nudity? Why all this
constipation?" he asks, throwing up his
hands in exasperation. "It's not intended to

be done in a shocking way. It's done for aes
thetics, never with erotic overtones. People
were at it left and right in the '60s in a much
more severe and harsh way... naked bodies
literally flicking on stage ... there is nothing
new with that."
Engendering far more curiosity and criti
cism than the nudity, however, is the ensem
ble itself. With its rigorous, unorthodox
method of actor-training, and its tightly knit
troop of actors attired in pitch-black, the
Experimental Theater Lab emanates a harsh
intensity that seems anomalous to the idyllic

Californian campus.
"It is a cross between ROTC and Zen,"
Ebrahimian describes. "At one point you
have to be like a Zen Buddhist: very well
focused and well-concentrated.
"On the other hand, you have to be in
very excellent shape, to be able to jog and do
120 pushups. I ask a lot from people.
Sometimes what I want to do with my actors
will freak some of the people and they drop
out."
Of those who did drop, Gennie Ruskus
— a senior who was with the group for one

quarter, two years ago — recalls
Ebrahimian's theater as very confrontation
al: "For myself, 1 reached a point where I
was no longer able to enjoy it; it became too
painful."
Ruskus also found her reluctance to try
nudity at odds with Ebrahimian's acting
demands: "At first, it was a kind of joke. 'Oh
Gennie, you're so constipated,' he would say,
but he did pressure me for months. He felt
it was my 'block.' "
Ruskus likens the ensemble to a kind of
cult, in which the actors were manipulated
by Ebrahimian: "One thing that's very
telling is that he chose a group of 23 people
who had had no acting experience, who
were very much of the virgin-mold. We had
no clue that we would have to become his
disciples and succumb to his vision."
The notion of a cult vision has even
given birth to a new vocabulary: "Babakish"
attitudes, "Babakian" beliefs and
"Babakites," those who follow the group.
Often painted as a theater guru of the black
turtleneck set on campus, the director
almost has become a paradigm for "artsi
ness" and all its mystique, a paradigm much
to his distaste.
"They just replace the word 'ensemble'
with 'cult,'" says Ebrahimian. "6 (a.m.) in
the quad. It's a commitment of time to art,
to theater, to being on time, to being dressed
in black. It's not a matter of looking artsy.
It's a matter of everyone looking neutral.
"Why? Because we rehearse 'til 4 in the
morning sometimes. Why? Because we
rehearse outside, inside, anywhere," he con
tinues. "From the outside, people can say it's
basically a cult, and I resent that because it's
an ensemble. Brecht had an ensemble. In
Europe the kind of theater we do would be
very normal."
Senior Kaki Bernard, who has worked
with Ebrahimian for two years, also pointed
out that, in Europe, nudity and the model of
the ensemble would not draw such attention
or sensational rumors.
"I'm really baffled," she says, shaking her
head. "If there is one thing I want to demysti
fy, it's that this is some kind of clan or cult.
We're people who work together. We like
him. We like each other. He gives us a great
deal of respect as actors."
Ebrahimian's adviser, Prof. Jean-Marie
Apostilides of the French and Italian dept,
believes that the impressions of the cult
stem from a misinterpretation of the direc
tor's personality.
"I think it is a misconception, this cult,"
says Apostilides, the author of "City of
Refuge." "Babak has a lot of charisma. He
has an energy uncommon in even this pro
fession — an absolutely passionate force. I
consider it a unique gift to work with him."
With his tousle of black hair and exclam
atory eyes, Ebrahimian possesses a kind of
dark vivacity, an aura of someone who has
experienced more than the average twen
tysomething American.
Born in Iran, the 25-year-old director
lived through the country's revolution, emi
grating first to Paris in 1980, and then to
New York in 1984, where he majored in
math and comparative literature as an
undergraduate at Cornell. He describes his
final cultural shock as that between the East
and West Coast.
"People are just sort of really, really nice

Controversial director shakes up the Stanford drama scene with his avant-garde productions . . .

• . . and his enigmatic personality

out here, and that just can be really
nerve-wracking," Babak says. "Nice,
super-friendly for no reason. A mask.
Maybe it's not a mask, maybe I'm
just too cynical sometimes. I'm try
ing to shed my cynicism; after having
gone through a revolution, your
head does get a little bit messed up.
"When you are 12 years old and
you see a street literally filled with
millions of people with their fists up
in the air, and their faces red with
anger screaming, death to so-and
so, the Shah, the U.S. —that's some
thing that stays with you.
"People talk about their friends
from third-grade. 1 don't have a
friend from third-grade. In that
sense, theater is my refuge."
Within this world of refuge,
Babak finds himself drawn to the
visual dynamics of European aes
thetics, preferring the German and
French drama to the largely psycho
logical American-theater tradition.
"When I go to the theater I want
to see a spectacle, another world,
time, reality — not something I'd
ordinarily see on the street,"
Ebrahimian says. "Or if I do see it
on the street, the theater should
shed new light on it.
"Let's say a man is vomiting on
the street. If I were to see that on
stage done correctly, a man would
puke and stand up, then puke and
stand up, and do this 100 times
until I will start to think, 'Why
doesn't he stop? Maybe I will
become nauseated.' Perhaps the
spectator will actually start puking.
"So next time I walk down the
street and see someone puking, I
won't just walk by and close my
eyes. That's the power of theater."
Although Ebrahimian does not
consider himself to be an overtly
political person, his social and polit
ical beliefs run through many
strands of his work.
"Sometimes my political buttons
do get pressed, and I get upset,"
Ebrahimian says."The war with
Iraq two years ago really disturbed
me. I got psychologically disturbed."
As a statement against the war,
Ebrahimian did a performance piece
in the Coffee House in which, while
dressed in black, he carried in a
newspaper bundle, sat down beside
an image of then-President Bush
projected on a screen, and began
unwrapping bits of the bundle,
eventually revealing a peace sign:
"People who were near me began
to leave because they thought I was a
terrorist of some kind," he says,
adding that someone even called
security.
"I resent the apathy around here,"
Ebrahimian says, describing Stanford
as a cross between a monastery and a
hospital where everyone is "under
general anaesthesia.
"You have basically an entire
campus that is just going around
'zzzzzzzzz,' " he says, jerking his fin
gers up and down to mimic a con

sciousness-shock register. "BEAN
SPROUTS . . . buzz . . .
ROLLERBLADES ... buzz ... the
world ... fizz ... ACADEMICS ...
buzz, Somalia, Bosnia, apathy, apa
thy, apathy, trivial, trivial, trivial
"So what does that do? That
makes someone like me who is an
'artist' be a little bit more socially or
politically active in what I do. If I
were in an area where everyone was
more active in art and more socially
aware, chances are I would have done
something more light and fun."
Although junior Tom Ranese
admires Ebrahimian's ability to con
vey social ideals through his theater,
he questions Ebrahimian's interac
tions with people: "At first it was
very exciting doing this kind of the
ater, but I became discouraged
when 1 saw that even though he had
these ideals of art changing society,
he seemed to have a lack of under
standing for human beings contra
dicting his goals.
"He was very dogmatic. He
didn't give room for any personal
lives," continues Ranese, who acted
in the ensemble for two quarters.
Ebrahimian acknowledges that
his disdain for Stanford, coupled
with his demanding personality,

have won him no popularity con
tests among the drama community.
"I have a very strong personality,
I can be very arrogant. I made a lot
of enemies my first year at the
drama department, and that con
tributed to this 'aura' of the cult,"
says Ebrahimian, who transferred to
the French and Italian department
last year after four quarters as a
drama student.
"In any grad program there is a
two-year probation state, after which
a number of professors must in
good conscience agree to work with
the student in order for that student
to be promoted to the next level of
graduate study," says Ron Davies, the
department administrator, who
made it clear that he was not speak
ing for the drama department.
"Babak felt it was in his best
interest to transfer," he continues.
"In that sense we didn't 'kick him
out* — unless you describe it as
someone walking out a door, and
you rush to kick him from behind
just as he's leaving."
"In the final analysis, it was very
much a mismatch," Davies says.
"The kind of things he wanted to do
were incompatible with the acade

stem from a misinterpretation of the direc
tor's personality.
"I think it is a misconception, this cult,"
says Apostilides, the author of "City of
Refuge." "Babak has a lot of charisma. He
has an energy uncommon in even this pro
fession — an absolutely passionate force. I
consider it a unique gift to work with him."
With his tousle of black hair and exclam
atory eyes, Ebrahimian possesses a kind of
dark vivacity, an aura of someone who has
experienced more than the average twen
tysomething American.
Born in Iran, the 25-year-old director
lived through the country's revolution, emi
grating first to Paris in 1980, and then to
New York in 1984, where he majored in
math and comparative literature as an
undergraduate at Cornell. He describes his
final cultural shock as that between the East
and West Coast.
"People are just sort of really, really nice

• . . and his enigmatic personality

out here, and that just can be really
nerve-wracking," Babak says. "Nice,
super-friendly for no reason. A mask.
Maybe it's not a mask, maybe I'm
just too cynical sometimes. I'm try
ing to shed my cynicism; after having
gone through a revolution, your
head does get a little bit messed up.
"When you are 12 years old and
you see a street literally filled with
millions of people with their fists up
in the air, and their faces red with
anger screaming, death to so-and
so, the Shah, the U.S. —that's some
thing that stays with you.
"People talk about their friends
from third-grade. 1 don't have a
friend from third-grade. In that
sense, theater is my refuge."
Within this world of refuge,
Babak finds himself drawn to the
visual dynamics of European aes
thetics, preferring the German and
French drama to the largely psycho
logical American-theater tradition.
"When I go to the theater I want
to see a spectacle, another world,
time, reality — not something I'd
ordinarily see on the street,"
Ebrahimian says. "Or if I do see it
on the street, the theater should
shed new light on it.
"Let's say a man is vomiting on
the street. If I were to see that on
stage done correctly, a man would
puke and stand up, then puke and
stand up, and do this 100 times
until I will start to think, 'Why
doesn't he stop? Maybe I will
become nauseated.' Perhaps the
spectator will actually start puking.
"So next time I walk down the
street and see someone puking, I
won't just walk by and close my
eyes. That's the power of theater."
Although Ebrahimian does not
consider himself to be an overtly
political person, his social and polit
ical beliefs run through many
strands of his work.
"Sometimes my political buttons
do get pressed, and I get upset,"
Ebrahimian says."The war with
Iraq two years ago really disturbed
me. I got psychologically disturbed."
As a statement against the war,
Ebrahimian did a performance piece
in the Coffee House in which, while
dressed in black, he carried in a
newspaper bundle, sat down beside
an image of then-President Bush
projected on a screen, and began
unwrapping bits of the bundle,
eventually revealing a peace sign:
"People who were near me began
to leave because they thought I was a
terrorist of some kind," he says,
adding that someone even called
security.
"I resent the apathy around here,"
Ebrahimian says, describing Stanford
as a cross between a monastery and a
hospital where everyone is "under
general anaesthesia.
"You have basically an entire
campus that is just going around
'zzzzzzzzz,' " he says, jerking his fin
gers up and down to mimic a con

sciousness-shock register. "BEAN
SPROUTS . . . buzz . . .
ROLLERBLADES ... buzz ... the
world ... fizz ... ACADEMICS ...
buzz, Somalia, Bosnia, apathy, apa
thy, apathy, trivial, trivial, trivial
"So what does that do? That
makes someone like me who is an
'artist' be a little bit more socially or
politically active in what I do. If I
were in an area where everyone was
more active in art and more socially
aware, chances are I would have done
something more light and fun."
Although junior Tom Ranese
admires Ebrahimian's ability to con
vey social ideals through his theater,
he questions Ebrahimian's interac
tions with people: "At first it was
very exciting doing this kind of the
ater, but I became discouraged
when 1 saw that even though he had
these ideals of art changing society,
he seemed to have a lack of under
standing for human beings contra
dicting his goals.
"He was very dogmatic. He
didn't give room for any personal
lives," continues Ranese, who acted
in the ensemble for two quarters.
Ebrahimian acknowledges that
his disdain for Stanford, coupled
with his demanding personality,

have won him no popularity con
tests among the drama community.
"I have a very strong personality,
I can be very arrogant. I made a lot
of enemies my first year at the
drama department, and that con
tributed to this 'aura' of the cult,"
says Ebrahimian, who transferred to
the French and Italian department
last year after four quarters as a
drama student.
"In any grad program there is a
two-year probation state, after which
a number of professors must in
good conscience agree to work with
the student in order for that student
to be promoted to the next level of
graduate study," says Ron Davies, the
department administrator, who
made it clear that he was not speak
ing for the drama department.
"Babak felt it was in his best
interest to transfer," he continues.
"In that sense we didn't 'kick him
out* — unless you describe it as
someone walking out a door, and
you rush to kick him from behind
just as he's leaving."
"In the final analysis, it was very
much a mismatch," Davies says.
"The kind of things he wanted to do
were incompatible with the acade
mic setting, and I don't think it's

just the Stanford academic setting."
Davies cites Ebrahimian's
requirement that actors "live, eat,
breathe and die" theater as one of
the factors in conflict with depart
mental philosophy — actors should
"have regular lives, with academics
and other extracurricular activities."
Davies also notes that Ebra
himian had no reservations about
making a theatrical scene in the
middle of an academic class, but
declines to elaborate, choosing to
say instead, Ebrahimian "has a
strange view of the appropriate."
"I had intellectual and artistic
disagreements with some of the
people," Ebrahimian recalls, "It's all
worked out for the better because
I'm still able to team up with the
people I want to work with."
"Besides Carl (Weber), who was
sympathetic to the land of theater he
was doing, [Babak] didn't seem to be
interested in other professors' ideas
always," Davies says."He really pushed
our system. But we have no axe to
grind, because [Babak has] found a
better venue where he has more free
dom and latitude to do his work."
Weber agrees: "He is a pretty
temperamental young man at times,
and I'm sure he caused some prob
lems for himself by not necessarily
brushing people the right way. I'm
not talking about myself. I never
had run-ins. But I pretty much
know people who had. But yes, it's
calmed down."
Matthew Causey, a third-year
graduate student in Drama who
also works with experimental the
ater, and who produced "Laboratory
of Hallucinations" last year, says
people exaggerate the nature of
Ebrahimian's conflicts with the
drama department:

"He's a misun
derstood youth
that's just feeling
his oats; he needs
our understanding.
Let's just create
theater and let the
personalities go.
One thing the
drama department
doesn't need with
all the budget cuts,
is to be seen as not
supportive of the
avant-garde. It is
very supportive.
"Some people
have a charisma;
For better or worse,
Babak has it,"
Causey continues,
adding that most
"are scared of peo
ple who are getting
work done."

Some say, however, a dogmatic
egoist caught up in the overwhelm
ing drama of his own beliefs lies
alongside the charisma.
"As one of my professors used to
say, a lot of people in theater make it
about themselves. People who stay
will realize sooner or later that the
art is bigger than they are," says
Lance Miller, a fourth-year graduate

'From the
outside, people
can say it's
basically a
Cult, and I
resent that
because it's an
ensemble.

ensemble.'
— Babak

student in Drama.
"One of his favorite phrases is
that theater should be a mind-fuck,"
Ruskus says. "One should leave the
performance feeling shaken up and
reevaluate [his or her] ideology.
[Ebrahimian's] theater doesn't really
give you much to go on beyond the
shock."
Although some say Ebrahimian's
theater possesses little substance —
that it is too laden with theory for
the average viewer to comprehend
— Nichols insists the theater is not
one that caters to intellectuals in an
elitist fashion.
"You have a certain set of people
who come: intellectuals, professors
of literature and drama ... students
who come for the aesthetics or have
heard something sensational about
it,"he says. "1 don't think it caters to
a particular audience ... what stays
with you are the images . . .it
doesn't have to have a solid, dried
meaning, but just a picture that
stays your mind."
It is that singular, provoking
Babakian picture that has made an
impact on campus that even some
of his critics admire. If the task of
art is, as Ebrahimian says, "to hit
people's chords on an emotional, or
cerebral level ... to let them deci
pher or just feel," he has been largely
successful.
"Even though I didn't enjoy
working with him, I consider it a
favorable memory," Ranese says.
"His avant-garde is very unique at
Stanford. It can provoke and make
people socially aware. I like that. It
maybe influenced groups such as
the Women's Performance
Collective."
Ruskus adds, "The theater he is
doing is very valid; it broadens hori-

zons. ine roie
needs to be ful
filled because no
one else is doing
it." Ebrahimian
sounds dubious,
even morose as
he talks about
the state of the
ater today: "We
make art out to
be a luxury. No
one quite cares
about the arts.
They watch TV.
They watch
schlock films.
They read People
Magazine. No
one cares. The
ater is as bad as
poetry. Theater is
dead," he pro
nounces gloomily.
If that is

true, at least the controversial direc
tor has made attempts to resurrect
the place he calls his refuge in a
manner that is distinctly "Babak."
"Certainly everything he has
done has a very personal stamp to it.
It is very unique, not something you
see in many places," Weber says."He
is trying to find a voice, but eventu
ally he will be a voice." ■

Up behind the Knoll, in a trailer
marked A3, Babak Ebrahimian and
his ensemble, the Experimental
Theater Laboratory, are dishing out slices of
mind-twisting American pie on a Saturday
afternoon.
As an excited Ebrahimian darts around
the room shouting directions, actors and
actresses slide across the floor enacting a jin
goisms worse nightmare.
The statue of liberty continually collapses
and rises with her torch ... an American
broadcast journalist checks her lipstick as
she attempts to interview a corpse on for
eign 50i1... a neglected housewife in a neg
ligee serves her husband breakfast, sends
him out the door, tips over his chair and
copulates with the chair leg as Louis
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"
plays in the background.
In a rehearsal of "Fragments of America,"
currently running in San Francisco at the
Mission Theater through Feb. 28, director
Ebrahimian and his ensemble turn the
American Dream on its head, through a
series of visual tableaux depicting a decaying
nation of spiritually decrepit individuals.
"I will not show you the shocking parts,"
Ebrahimian says, laughing. After five pro
ductions and three years at Stanford, the 25-
year-old director has come to expect a cer
tain sensationalistic response to his shows.
"Experimental theater always tends to be
a little wacked oat compared to normal the
ater. People don't normally see it. It's always
in the margins. So when people see it, they
go, 'Huh, bunch of freaks.' They don't know
there's a lot of process that goes into it,"says
Ebrahimian, who also directed and pro
duced "Fragments of a Revolution,"
"Hamlet Machine," "The Wedding," "The
Exception and the Rule" and "City of
Refuge."
Junior Mike Nichols, who has acted in all
of in Ebrahimian's projects, emphasizes the
uniqueness of the productions, an avant
garde theater style seldom found on the
stages of Stanford, or San Francisco for that
matter.
"That makes him popular to some extent;
he does things that people would consider
unorthodox, having things like nudity and
addressing subjects that aren't necessarily
addressed on stage," he explains. Ebrahimian
"uses things like complete soundtracks, sound
motion, freezing, a lot of lights."
Of the five sold-out plays, "City of
Refuge," which was based on the letters of
the Marquis de Sade and staged in the men's
bathroom behind Memorial Church, is per
haps the most well-known.
"It became a cause cel&bre and a scandal
to some extent because the cast members
were all naked," says Prof. Carl Weber of the
drama department, the translator of Hamlet
Machine. "It had a shock effect, but in gen
eral was very successful, very well-done.
Babak has a great sense of visual element
and of theater, and he is inventive. [He]
comes up with very interesting visual
imagery."
Ebrahimian views the sensationalistic
response to the nudity in his productions as
absurd, nonplussed by what he terms the
"constipation" of the Stanford campus.
"What's wrong with nudity? Why all this
constipation?" he asks, throwing up his
hands in exasperation. "It's not intended to

be done in a shocking way. It's done for aes
thetics, never with erotic overtones. People
were at it left and right in the '60s in a much
more severe and harsh way... naked bodies
literally flicking on stage ... there is nothing
new with that."
Engendering far more curiosity and criti
cism than the nudity, however, is the ensem
ble itself. With its rigorous, unorthodox
method of actor-training, and its tightly knit
troop of actors attired in pitch-black, the
Experimental Theater Lab emanates a harsh
intensity that seems anomalous to the idyllic

Californian campus.
"It is a cross between ROTC and Zen,"
Ebrahimian describes. "At one point you
have to be like a Zen Buddhist: very well
focused and well-concentrated.
"On the other hand, you have to be in
very excellent shape, to be able to jog and do
120 pushups. I ask a lot from people.
Sometimes what I want to do with my actors
will freak some of the people and they drop
out."
Of those who did drop, Gennie Ruskus
— a senior who was with the group for one

quarter, two years ago — recalls
Ebrahimian's theater as very confrontation
al: "For myself, 1 reached a point where I
was no longer able to enjoy it; it became too
painful."
Ruskus also found her reluctance to try
nudity at odds with Ebrahimian's acting
demands: "At first, it was a kind of joke. 'Oh
Gennie, you're so constipated,' he would say,
but he did pressure me for months. He felt
it was my 'block.' "
Ruskus likens the ensemble to a kind of
cult, in which the actors were manipulated
by Ebrahimian: "One thing that's very
telling is that he chose a group of 23 people
who had had no acting experience, who
were very much of the virgin-mold. We had
no clue that we would have to become his
disciples and succumb to his vision."
The notion of a cult vision has even
given birth to a new vocabulary: "Babakish"
attitudes, "Babakian" beliefs and
"Babakites," those who follow the group.
Often painted as a theater guru of the black
turtleneck set on campus, the director
almost has become a paradigm for "artsi
ness" and all its mystique, a paradigm much
to his distaste.
"They just replace the word 'ensemble'
with 'cult,'" says Ebrahimian. "6 (a.m.) in
the quad. It's a commitment of time to art,
to theater, to being on time, to being dressed
in black. It's not a matter of looking artsy.
It's a matter of everyone looking neutral.
"Why? Because we rehearse 'til 4 in the
morning sometimes. Why? Because we
rehearse outside, inside, anywhere," he con
tinues. "From the outside, people can say it's
basically a cult, and I resent that because it's
an ensemble. Brecht had an ensemble. In
Europe the kind of theater we do would be
very normal."
Senior Kaki Bernard, who has worked
with Ebrahimian for two years, also pointed
out that, in Europe, nudity and the model of
the ensemble would not draw such attention
or sensational rumors.
"I'm really baffled," she says, shaking her
head. "If there is one thing I want to demysti
fy, it's that this is some kind of clan or cult.
We're people who work together. We like
him. We like each other. He gives us a great
deal of respect as actors."
Ebrahimian's adviser, Prof. Jean-Marie
Apostilides of the French and Italian dept,
believes that the impressions of the cult
stem from a misinterpretation of the direc
tor's personality.
"I think it is a misconception, this cult,"
says Apostilides, the author of "City of
Refuge." "Babak has a lot of charisma. He
has an energy uncommon in even this pro
fession — an absolutely passionate force. I
consider it a unique gift to work with him."

Within this world of refuge,
Babak finds himself drawn to the
visual dynamics of European aes

French drama to the largely psycho
logical American-theater tradition.
"When I go to the theater I want
to see a spectacle, another world,

spectator will actually start puking.
"So next time I walk down the
street and see someone puking, I
won't just walk by and close my
eyes. That's the power of theater."
Although Ebrahimian does not
consider himself to be an overtly

series of visual tableaux depicting a decaying
nation of spiritually decrepit individuals.
"I will not show you the shocking parts,"
Ebrahimian says, laughing. After five pro
ductions and three years at Stanford, the 25-
year-old director has come to expect a cer
tain sensationalistic response to his shows.
"Experimental theater always tends to be
a little wacked oat compared to normal the
ater. People don't normally see it. It's always
in the margins. So when people see it, they
go, 'Huh, bunch of freaks.' They don't know
there's a lot of process that goes into it,"says
Ebrahimian, who also directed and pro
duced "Fragments of a Revolution,"
"Hamlet Machine," "The Wedding," "The
Exception and the Rule" and "City of
Refuge."
Junior Mike Nichols, who has acted in all
of in Ebrahimian's projects, emphasizes the
uniqueness of the productions, an avant
garde theater style seldom found on the
stages of Stanford, or San Francisco for that
matter.
"That makes him popular to some extent;
he does things that people would consider
unorthodox, having things like nudity and
addressing subjects that aren't necessarily
addressed on stage," he explains. Ebrahimian
"uses things like complete soundtracks, sound
motion, freezing, a lot of lights."
Of the five sold-out plays, "City of
Refuge," which was based on the letters of
the Marquis de Sade and staged in the men's
bathroom behind Memorial Church, is per
haps the most well-known.
"It became a cause cel&bre and a scandal
to some extent because the cast members
were all naked," says Prof. Carl Weber of the
drama department, the translator of Hamlet
Machine. "It had a shock effect, but in gen
eral was very successful, very well-done.
Babak has a great sense of visual element
and of theater, and he is inventive. [He]
comes up with very interesting visual
imagery."
Ebrahimian views the sensationalistic
response to the nudity in his productions as
absurd, nonplussed by what he terms the
"constipation" of the Stanford campus.
"What's wrong with nudity? Why all this
constipation?" he asks, throwing up his
hands in exasperation. "It's not intended to

be done in a shocking way. It's done for aes
thetics, never with erotic overtones. People
were at it left and right in the '60s in a much
more severe and harsh way... naked bodies
literally flicking on stage ... there is nothing
new with that."
Engendering far more curiosity and criti
cism than the nudity, however, is the ensem
ble itself. With its rigorous, unorthodox
method of actor-training, and its tightly knit
troop of actors attired in pitch-black, the
Experimental Theater Lab emanates a harsh
intensity that seems anomalous to the idyllic

Californian campus.
"It is a cross between ROTC and Zen,"
Ebrahimian describes. "At one point you
have to be like a Zen Buddhist: very well
focused and well-concentrated.
"On the other hand, you have to be in
very excellent shape, to be able to jog and do
120 pushups. I ask a lot from people.
Sometimes what I want to do with my actors
will freak some of the people and they drop
out."
Of those who did drop, Gennie Ruskus
— a senior who was with the group for one

quarter, two years ago — recalls
Ebrahimian's theater as very confrontation
al: "For myself, 1 reached a point where I
was no longer able to enjoy it; it became too
painful."
Ruskus also found her reluctance to try
nudity at odds with Ebrahimian's acting
demands: "At first, it was a kind of joke. 'Oh
Gennie, you're so constipated,' he would say,
but he did pressure me for months. He felt
it was my 'block.' "
Ruskus likens the ensemble to a kind of
cult, in which the actors were manipulated
by Ebrahimian: "One thing that's very
telling is that he chose a group of 23 people
who had had no acting experience, who
were very much of the virgin-mold. We had
no clue that we would have to become his
disciples and succumb to his vision."
The notion of a cult vision has even
given birth to a new vocabulary: "Babakish"
attitudes, "Babakian" beliefs and
"Babakites," those who follow the group.
Often painted as a theater guru of the black
turtleneck set on campus, the director
almost has become a paradigm for "artsi
ness" and all its mystique, a paradigm much
to his distaste.
"They just replace the word 'ensemble'
with 'cult,'" says Ebrahimian. "6 (a.m.) in
the quad. It's a commitment of time to art,
to theater, to being on time, to being dressed
in black. It's not a matter of looking artsy.
It's a matter of everyone looking neutral.
"Why? Because we rehearse 'til 4 in the
morning sometimes. Why? Because we
rehearse outside, inside, anywhere," he con
tinues. "From the outside, people can say it's
basically a cult, and I resent that because it's
an ensemble. Brecht had an ensemble. In
Europe the kind of theater we do would be
very normal."
Senior Kaki Bernard, who has worked
with Ebrahimian for two years, also pointed
out that, in Europe, nudity and the model of
the ensemble would not draw such attention
or sensational rumors.
"I'm really baffled," she says, shaking her
head. "If there is one thing I want to demysti
fy, it's that this is some kind of clan or cult.
We're people who work together. We like
him. We like each other. He gives us a great
deal of respect as actors."
Ebrahimian's adviser, Prof. Jean-Marie
Apostilides of the French and Italian dept,
believes that the impressions of the cult
stem from a misinterpretation of the direc
tor's personality.
"I think it is a misconception, this cult,"
says Apostilides, the author of "City of
Refuge." "Babak has a lot of charisma. He
has an energy uncommon in even this pro
fession — an absolutely passionate force. I
consider it a unique gift to work with him."
With his tousle of black hair and exclam
atory eyes, Ebrahimian possesses a kind of
dark vivacity, an aura of someone who has
experienced more than the average twen
tysomething American.
Born in Iran, the 25-year-old director
lived through the country's revolution, emi
grating first to Paris in 1980, and then to
New York in 1984, where he majored in
math and comparative literature as an
undergraduate at Cornell. He describes his
final cultural shock as that between the East
and West Coast.
"People are just sort of really, really nice

Controversial director shakes up the Stanford drama scene with his avant-garde productions . . .

• . . and his enigmatic personality

out here, and that just can be really
nerve-wracking," Babak says. "Nice,
super-friendly for no reason. A mask.
Maybe it's not a mask, maybe I'm
just too cynical sometimes. I'm try
ing to shed my cynicism; after having
gone through a revolution, your
head does get a little bit messed up.
"When you are 12 years old and
you see a street literally filled with
millions of people with their fists up
in the air, and their faces red with
anger screaming, death to so-and
so, the Shah, the U.S. —that's some
thing that stays with you.
"People talk about their friends
from third-grade. 1 don't have a
friend from third-grade. In that
sense, theater is my refuge."
Within this world of refuge,
Babak finds himself drawn to the
visual dynamics of European aes
thetics, preferring the German and
French drama to the largely psycho
logical American-theater tradition.
"When I go to the theater I want
to see a spectacle, another world,
time, reality — not something I'd
ordinarily see on the street,"
Ebrahimian says. "Or if I do see it
on the street, the theater should
shed new light on it.
"Let's say a man is vomiting on
the street. If I were to see that on
stage done correctly, a man would
puke and stand up, then puke and
stand up, and do this 100 times
until I will start to think, 'Why
doesn't he stop? Maybe I will
become nauseated.' Perhaps the
spectator will actually start puking.
"So next time I walk down the
street and see someone puking, I
won't just walk by and close my
eyes. That's the power of theater."
Although Ebrahimian does not
consider himself to be an overtly
political person, his social and polit
ical beliefs run through many
strands of his work.
"Sometimes my political buttons
do get pressed, and I get upset,"
Ebrahimian says."The war with
Iraq two years ago really disturbed
me. I got psychologically disturbed."
As a statement against the war,
Ebrahimian did a performance piece
in the Coffee House in which, while
dressed in black, he carried in a
newspaper bundle, sat down beside
an image of then-President Bush
projected on a screen, and began
unwrapping bits of the bundle,
eventually revealing a peace sign:
"People who were near me began
to leave because they thought I was a
terrorist of some kind," he says,
adding that someone even called
security.
"I resent the apathy around here,"
Ebrahimian says, describing Stanford
as a cross between a monastery and a
hospital where everyone is "under
general anaesthesia.
"You have basically an entire
campus that is just going around
'zzzzzzzzz,' " he says, jerking his fin
gers up and down to mimic a con

sciousness-shock register. "BEAN
SPROUTS . . . buzz . . .
ROLLERBLADES ... buzz ... the
world ... fizz ... ACADEMICS ...
buzz, Somalia, Bosnia, apathy, apa
thy, apathy, trivial, trivial, trivial
"So what does that do? That
makes someone like me who is an
'artist' be a little bit more socially or
politically active in what I do. If I
were in an area where everyone was
more active in art and more socially
aware, chances are I would have done
something more light and fun."
Although junior Tom Ranese
admires Ebrahimian's ability to con
vey social ideals through his theater,
he questions Ebrahimian's interac
tions with people: "At first it was
very exciting doing this kind of the
ater, but I became discouraged
when 1 saw that even though he had
these ideals of art changing society,
he seemed to have a lack of under
standing for human beings contra
dicting his goals.
"He was very dogmatic. He
didn't give room for any personal
lives," continues Ranese, who acted
in the ensemble for two quarters.
Ebrahimian acknowledges that
his disdain for Stanford, coupled
with his demanding personality,

have won him no popularity con
tests among the drama community.
"I have a very strong personality,
I can be very arrogant. I made a lot
of enemies my first year at the
drama department, and that con
tributed to this 'aura' of the cult,"
says Ebrahimian, who transferred to
the French and Italian department
last year after four quarters as a
drama student.
"In any grad program there is a
two-year probation state, after which
a number of professors must in
good conscience agree to work with
the student in order for that student
to be promoted to the next level of
graduate study," says Ron Davies, the
department administrator, who
made it clear that he was not speak
ing for the drama department.
"Babak felt it was in his best
interest to transfer," he continues.
"In that sense we didn't 'kick him
out* — unless you describe it as
someone walking out a door, and
you rush to kick him from behind
just as he's leaving."
"In the final analysis, it was very
much a mismatch," Davies says.
"The kind of things he wanted to do
were incompatible with the acade
mic setting, and I don't think it's

just the Stanford academic setting."
Davies cites Ebrahimian's
requirement that actors "live, eat,
breathe and die" theater as one of
the factors in conflict with depart
mental philosophy — actors should
"have regular lives, with academics
and other extracurricular activities."
Davies also notes that Ebra
himian had no reservations about
making a theatrical scene in the
middle of an academic class, but
declines to elaborate, choosing to
say instead, Ebrahimian "has a
strange view of the appropriate."
"I had intellectual and artistic
disagreements with some of the
people," Ebrahimian recalls, "It's all
worked out for the better because
I'm still able to team up with the
people I want to work with."
"Besides Carl (Weber), who was
sympathetic to the land of theater he
was doing, [Babak] didn't seem to be
interested in other professors' ideas
always," Davies says."He really pushed
our system. But we have no axe to
grind, because [Babak has] found a
better venue where he has more free
dom and latitude to do his work."
Weber agrees: "He is a pretty
temperamental young man at times,
and I'm sure he caused some prob
lems for himself by not necessarily
brushing people the right way. I'm
not talking about myself. I never
had run-ins. But I pretty much
know people who had. But yes, it's
calmed down."
Matthew Causey, a third-year
graduate student in Drama who
also works with experimental the
ater, and who produced "Laboratory
of Hallucinations" last year, says
people exaggerate the nature of
Ebrahimian's conflicts with the
drama department:

"He's a misun
derstood youth
that's just feeling
his oats; he needs
our understanding.
Let's just create
theater and let the
personalities go.
One thing the
drama department
doesn't need with
all the budget cuts,
is to be seen as not
supportive of the
avant-garde. It is
very supportive.
"Some people
have a charisma;
For better or worse,
Babak has it,"
Causey continues,
adding that most
"are scared of peo
ple who are getting
work done."

Some say, however, a dogmatic
egoist caught up in the overwhelm
ing drama of his own beliefs lies
alongside the charisma.
"As one of my professors used to
say, a lot of people in theater make it
about themselves. People who stay
will realize sooner or later that the
art is bigger than they are," says
Lance Miller, a fourth-year graduate

'From the
outside, people
can say it's
basically a
Cult, and I
resent that
because it's an
ensemble.
Brecht had an
ensemble.'
— Babak

student in Drama.
"One of his favorite phrases is
that theater should be a mind-fuck,"
Ruskus says. "One should leave the
performance feeling shaken up and
reevaluate [his or her] ideology.
[Ebrahimian's] theater doesn't really
give you much to go on beyond the
shock."
Although some say Ebrahimian's
theater possesses little substance —
that it is too laden with theory for
the average viewer to comprehend
— Nichols insists the theater is not
one that caters to intellectuals in an
elitist fashion.
"You have a certain set of people
who come: intellectuals, professors
of literature and drama ... students
who come for the aesthetics or have
heard something sensational about
it,"he says. "1 don't think it caters to
a particular audience ... what stays
with you are the images . . .it
doesn't have to have a solid, dried
meaning, but just a picture that
stays your mind."
It is that singular, provoking
Babakian picture that has made an
impact on campus that even some
of his critics admire. If the task of
art is, as Ebrahimian says, "to hit
people's chords on an emotional, or
cerebral level ... to let them deci
pher or just feel," he has been largely
successful.
"Even though I didn't enjoy
working with him, I consider it a
favorable memory," Ranese says.
"His avant-garde is very unique at
Stanford. It can provoke and make
people socially aware. I like that. It
maybe influenced groups such as
the Women's Performance
Collective."
Ruskus adds, "The theater he is
doing is very valid; it broadens hori-

zons. ine roie
needs to be ful
filled because no
one else is doing
it." Ebrahimian
sounds dubious,
even morose as
he talks about
the state of the
ater today: "We
make art out to
be a luxury. No
one quite cares
about the arts.
They watch TV.
They watch
schlock films.
They read People
Magazine. No
one cares. The
ater is as bad as
poetry. Theater is
dead," he pro
nounces gloomily.
If that is

true, at least the controversial direc
tor has made attempts to resurrect
the place he calls his refuge in a
manner that is distinctly "Babak."
"Certainly everything he has
done has a very personal stamp to it.
It is very unique, not something you
see in many places," Weber says."He
is trying to find a voice, but eventu
ally he will be a voice." ■

Up behind the Knoll, in a trailer
marked A3, Babak Ebrahimian and
his ensemble, the Experimental
Theater Laboratory, are dishing out slices of
mind-twisting American pie on a Saturday
afternoon.
As an excited Ebrahimian darts around
the room shouting directions, actors and
actresses slide across the floor enacting a jin
goisms worse nightmare.
The statue of liberty continually collapses
and rises with her torch ... an American
broadcast journalist checks her lipstick as
she attempts to interview a corpse on for
eign 50i1... a neglected housewife in a neg
ligee serves her husband breakfast, sends
him out the door, tips over his chair and
copulates with the chair leg as Louis
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"
plays in the background.
In a rehearsal of "Fragments of America,"
currently running in San Francisco at the
Mission Theater through Feb. 28, director
Ebrahimian and his ensemble turn the
American Dream on its head, through a
series of visual tableaux depicting a decaying
nation of spiritually decrepit individuals.
"I will not show you the shocking parts,"

"I had intellectual and artistic
disagreements with some of the
people," Ebrahimian recalls, "It's all
worked out for the better because
I'm still able to team up with the
people I want to work with."
"Besides Carl (Weber), who was
sympathetic to the land of theater he
was doing, [Babak] didn't seem to be
interested in other professors' ideas
always," Davies says."He really pushed
our system. But we have no axe to
grind, because [Babak has] found a
better venue where he has more free
dom and latitude to do his work."
Weber agrees: "He is a pretty
temperamental young man at times,
and I'm sure he caused some prob
lems for himself by not necessarily
brushing people the right way. I'm
not talking about myself. I never
had run-ins. But I pretty much
know people who had. But yes, it's
calmed down."
Matthew Causey, a third-year
graduate student in Drama who
also works with experimental the
ater, and who produced "Laboratory
of Hallucinations" last year, says
people exaggerate the nature of
Ebrahimian's conflicts with the
drama department:

"He's a misun
derstood youth
that's just feeling
his oats; he needs
our understanding.
Let's just create
theater and let the
personalities go.
One thing the
drama department
doesn't need with
all the budget cuts,
is to be seen as not
supportive of the
avant-garde. It is
very supportive.
"Some people
have a charisma;
For better or worse,
Babak has it,"
Causey continues,
adding that most
"are scared of peo
ple who are getting
work done."

Some say, however, a dogmatic
egoist caught up in the overwhelm
ing drama of his own beliefs lies
alongside the charisma.
"As one of my professors used to
say, a lot of people in theater make it
about themselves. People who stay
will realize sooner or later that the
art is bigger than they are," says
Lance Miller, a fourth-year graduate

'From the
outside, people
can say it's
basically a
Cult, and I
resent that
because it's an
ensemble.
Brecht had an
ensemble.'

"One of his favorite phrases is
that theater should be a mind-fuck,"
Ruskus says. "One should leave the
performance feeling shaken up and
reevaluate [his or her] ideology.
[Ebrahimian's] theater doesn't really
give you much to go on beyond the
shock."
Although some say Ebrahimian's
theater possesses little substance —
that it is too laden with theory for
the average viewer to comprehend
— Nichols insists the theater is not
one that caters to intellectuals in an
elitist fashion.
"You have a certain set of people
who come: intellectuals, professors
of literature and drama ... students
who come for the aesthetics or have
heard something sensational about
it,"he says. "1 don't think it caters to
a particular audience ... what stays
with you are the images . . .it
doesn't have to have a solid, dried
meaning, but just a picture that
stays your mind."
It is that singular, provoking
Babakian picture that has made an
impact on campus that even some
of his critics admire. If the task of
art is, as Ebrahimian says, "to hit
people's chords on an emotional, or
cerebral level ... to let them deci
pher or just feel," he has been largely
successful.
"Even though I didn't enjoy
working with him, I consider it a
favorable memory," Ranese says.
"His avant-garde is very unique at
Stanford. It can provoke and make
people socially aware. I like that. It
maybe influenced groups such as
the Women's Performance
Collective."
Ruskus adds, "The theater he is
doing is very valid; it broadens hori-

zons. ine roie
needs to be ful
filled because no
one else is doing
it." Ebrahimian
sounds dubious,
even morose as
he talks about
the state of the
ater today: "We
make art out to
be a luxury. No
one quite cares
about the arts.
They watch TV.
They watch
schlock films.
They read People
Magazine. No
one cares. The
ater is as bad as
poetry. Theater is
dead," he pro
nounces gloomily.
If that is

true, at least the controversial direc
tor has made attempts to resurrect
the place he calls his refuge in a
manner that is distinctly "Babak."
"Certainly everything he has
done has a very personal stamp to it.
It is very unique, not something you
see in many places," Weber says."He
is trying to find a voice, but eventu
ally he will be a voice." ■
