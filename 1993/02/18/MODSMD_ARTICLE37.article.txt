Secretaries join
women who'll kill
just to get ahead

The Temp

In"The Temp," a beautiful seductress
embarks on a killing spree just to get a pro
motion. The filmmakers want to believe
that they've crafted a deeply psychological
thriller. But this is just another flick about
the psycho bitch from hell.
Kris Bolin (Lara Flynn Boyle) arrives as a
temporary worker at Mrs. Appleby's baked
goods company. Her boss Peter (Timothy
Hutton), can't believe his luck in finding
this gorgeous and talented woman to re
place his incompetent assistant. Kris' d6col
letage steams up the office as she produces
brilliant marketing ideas for the company.
Things take a bad turn for Peter and his
temp as she moves up in the company's
ranks and begins to compete with him for
top executive positions. When deadly acci
dents befall other contenders for these jobs,
Peter begins to suspect Kris of murder.
Director Tom Holland ("Fright Night")
tries to complicate this simplistic plot by
raising doubts about Kris' culpability. Yet
he fails because he portrays her as an evil
femmefatale. So we never believe that she's
innocent — even if she says she went to
Stanford,
Holland tries to conceal the film's im
plausibility and predictability by jazzing up
the visuals. He includes scenes that make
little sense, just to provide the requisite
thrills for the audience. But we get more
gore than suspense, in such scenes as an of
fice assistant getting his hand caught in a
shredding machine, or people spitting up
blood while eating Mrs. Appleby's cookies.
The screenwriters give Kris and Peter
pseudo-complex personalities to add a psy
chological element to the plot, like Peter's
previous treatment for paranoia. Despite
the competent performances by Hutton
and Boyle, these "insights" seem unrealistic
and contrived.
By having Kris receive a promotion only
after parading around the workplace in
low-cut blouses and nearly invisible skirts,

Holland suggests that women need to ob
jectify themselves to do well in business.
Both she and Charlene (Faye Dunaway),
the CEO of Mrs. Appleby's, are portrayed as
ruthless and cold career women that will
stop at nothing to succeed.
Like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"
"Working Girl," and "Basic Instinct," "The
Temp" imagines itself to be a cautionary
tale about the dangers of single and child
less women resorting to seduction and vio
lence to get ahead in a man's world. But in
fact, the movie is merely a pathetic story
about men's fears of having to compete
with women in corporate America.

A dumb waitress,
a dumb busboy,
and a stupid plot

Untamed Heart

It'd be nice to tell you that "Untamed
Heart" is a great film. It'd be nice to rant
and rave about the tender story of a love
between two crazy kids in Minneapolis.
It'd also be nice if we could have world
peace and 1,000 free pizzas.
"Untamed Heart" opens promisingly.
Marisa Tomei plays Caroline, unlucky in
love and endearingly stupid. She works
in Jim's Diner, where, incredibly, she
hasn't yet noticed the usually crazy
mad-fly Christian Slater, who plays
Adam.
Adam is mute, not from birth defect
or childhood trauma, but by choice. He
just "doesn't get along with people." He
spends most of the movie not speaking,
which is actually preferable to the
mindless drivel that passes for dialogue
once he gains his voice and Caroline's
love.
In a hackneyed "Gee, how do I get her
to notice me? I think I'll save her from a
horrible fate" plot device, Adam just
happens to follow Caroline home late
the night Caroline's almost raped.
How can she possibly repay him? Car
oline — gratefully — cuts Adam's hair,
then lets him touch her breast. She even
persuades him to explain the mysterious
scar on his chest. Ahh, true love. They
quickly become soulmates, though no
one around them can understand the at
traction, including the audience.
Why would a well-adjusted, extro
verted young woman fall for this inex
pressive clod?
The actors do nothing to help the
shaky plot and character development.
Though a good comedic actress, Marisa
Tomei ("My Cousin Vinny") falls flat
when the going gets dramatic. While
Adam babbles about the beauty of stars
in the night sky, she can only utter a pa
thetically sympathetic moan "Ohhhh"
that spans several octaves.
And what happened to the Christian
Slater teenagers drooled over in
"Heathers" and "Pump Up the Volume?"
He looks dirty, disheveled and generally
disgusting. He delivers what little dia
logue he's given in a flat tone of voice, as

if bored. And he doesn't even do his Jack
Nicholson impression.
Rosie Perez puts forth the only decent
effort in the movie as Caroline's equally
gabby co-worker and confidant. With
the same squeaky voice she used in
"White Men Can't Jump," Perez manages
to keep a straight face while offering
homilies such as "Life is like a bowl of
ice cream, and the flavor ain't always
vanilla."
Unfortunately, her role doesn't let her
do much more than chain-smoke and
squeal.
Well, those free pizzas haven't arrived
yet, and this film still isn't worth the
price of admission. Please don't see
"Untamed Heart." Don't even rent it. If
you save that money, it won't matter that
world peace and free pizzas may never
come to pass.

Les Depardieus
in French tale of
baroque beauty

Tousles Matins du Monde

"Every note must end by dying." The first
line of Alain Corneau's "Tous Les Matins du
Monde" establishes a solemn tone that
lingers throughout the rest of the movie.
Notes die, music dies, joy dies, people die.
Yet this melancholy mood never over
whelms the story's inherent passion and
beauty.
"Tousles Matins" tells the true story of
Monsieur de Sainte Colombe (Jean-Pierre
Marielle), a brilliant musician who refuses
to play at the Royal Court of Louis XIV,
opting instead to compose in solitude in
side a simple cabin, in perpetual mourning
for his deceased wife.
He raises his two daughters, Madeleine
and Toinette (Anne Brochet and Carole
Richert), on viol lessons and the barest
minimum of affection. But the arrival of

Marin Marais (Guillaume D£pardieu), a
brash, young musician who wishes to be
Sainte Colombe's pupil, changes every
thing.
Sainte Colombe takes him on reluc
tantly, and only on his own terms, refus
ing to help Marais perfect his superficial
virtuosity. Instead he tries to teach Marais
the spiritual meaning of music. It takes
Marais an entire lifetime to learn Sainte
Colombe's lesson. He must first experi
ence passion, regret, pain and repentance
— and make others experience them as
well.
Gerard D£pardieu's son Guillaume
makes a successful film debut, imbuing
the youthful Marais with an impetuous,
hormone-filled energy. He speaks crude
ly of his "prick" before Sainte Colombe
and his daughters, and carelessly takes
advantage of Madeleine's hunger for love.
But he later matures convincingly into
the older, more sensitive Marin who be
gins to understand the spiritual nature of
music.
The D£pardieus' skill is matched by
their co-stars'. As Sainte Colombe,
Marielle's enigmatic performance makes it
hard to decide whether Sainte Colombe's
life is a wasteland or whether he actually
lives much more deeply than most. Finally,
Anne Brochet convincingly navigates
Madeleine's transformation from a vigor
ous, sexual young girl to a sickly, suicidal
woman.
The soundtrack is the backbone of the
film, featuring the deep, melancholy tones
that Sainte Colombe perfected by adding a
seventh string to the viol. And the cine
matography reinforces the mood — many
scenes seem to be lifted straight out of a
Rembrandt still life, rich with the
chiaroscuro of a wine glass, wafers and a
viol, just barely illuminated by candle
light.
"Tous les Matins" is a soulful movie that
speaks through the language of music and
transports you to a strange, baroque world.
It's not just for music or art lovers, but
rather for anyone who can appreciate the
complexity of human emotions.
