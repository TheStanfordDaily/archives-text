'BodyMindSoul' is
a scary reminder
of the banal '80s

Debbie Gibson

Debbie Gibson. Max Headroom. Para
chute pants. Which of these 1980s relics is at
tempting a comeback?
Well, it isn't a disembodied head and it
doesn't feature a thousand zippers. But play
ing Debbie Gibson's latest album, "Body
Mind Soul" will, like the other two choices,
get you laughed at if you bring it to parties.
Gibson is aiming to reshape her image

with her latest release, attempting to trans
form herself from a bubble-gum teenybopper
with big hair to, well, a bubble-gum twen
tysomething-bopper with poorly dyed hair.
The CD box features the "teen scream" in a
variety of sultry poses, obviously intended to
depict the New Jersey product as a sexy-yet
mature crooner. But the effect, when com
bined with the album's contents, is that of a
second-rate En Vogue on helium.
In all, "Body Mind Soul" sounds as though
a producer convinced Gibson that, so long as
no money was spent on frills like, say, compe
tent songwriters, varied beats from song to
song and a sense of artistic dignity, surely a
few more cents could be wrung from the
twitching corpse that is Debbie's career.
The banality begins with "Love or Money,"
a tune featuring Gibson's half-octave vocal

prowess. Slapped on top of a beat that sounds
like an outtake from the "Ghostbusters"
theme song, America's little sweetheart chirps
lines like "A millionaire from London tried to
sweep me off my feet/A lear jet, a fancy car,
but still you've got them beat."
Holy 1987, Batman.
The album also features the required-by-law
ballad "How Can This Be?," the girl-with-an
attitude "Shock Your Mama," and a whole slew
of eminently forgettable songs undoubtedly
recorded after minutes and minutes of practice.
Spare yourselves the effort and the time.
Even if you liked the singles "Only in my
Dreams," "Foolish Beat" and "Lost in Your
Eyes," don't get "Body Mind Soul."
And if you did like the other three releases,
call The Bridge.
