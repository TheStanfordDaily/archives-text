■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret
that's got America abuzz?
Well you won't find out, unless
you see writer-director Neil
Jordan's offbeat hit. Stephen
Rea, Forest Whitaker and
newcomer Jaye Davidson are
at the top of their game in this
brilliant web of love and in
trigue involving the IRA, a
British soldier and an enig
matic hairdresser. Shades of
"Vertigo," it's a definite must
see. R
Loaded Weapon I
This spoof wants to be
"Wayne's World," "Naked
Gun," and "Hot Shots" all
wrapped up into one. It
doesn't make it, but it enter
tains along the way. Emilio
Estevez and Samuel L. Jack
son star as a pair of inept
cops struggling to solve the
murder of Jackson's partner.
PG-13
Love Field
A powerful and erotic "pre
quel" to "Jungle Fever"...
not. This syrupy and slick flick
treats America's racial prob
lems with all the complexity of
a Harlequin Romance novel.
Michelle Pfeiffer plays
Lurene, a chatterbox ob
sessed with Jackie Kennedy.
When JFK is killed, she has
tens from Dallas to Arlington
for the funeral, screwing up
the life of Sidney Poitier
wannabe Dennis Haysbert
along the way. The two ex
change kisses and cutting re
marks while staying one step
ahead of the law. PG

■ Matinee
Part teen flick, part horror spoof
and part nuclear scare, the film
manages to turn a flimsy plot
into an entertaining B-movie.
John Goodman stars as
Woolsey, a schlock-film direc
tor/producer whose Key West
world premiere of "MANT!" —
Half Man... Half Ant... All
Terror!!! — coincides with the
threat of global thermonuclear
war. So the always-enterprising
Woolsey schemes to use the
residents' fears to hype his
flick. Good fun. PG-13
■ Sommersby
Richard Gere plays Jack
Sommersby, a callous, irre
sponsible scoundrel who
leaves his Southern home
town to fight in the Civil
War. But when he returns
home, he's a socially en
lightened, sensitive man
with the soul of a poet.
Changed man — or charm
ing impostor? Gere keeps
his wife Laurel (Jodie Fos
ter), the townspeople and
the audience guessing right
up until the end. PG-13
The Vanishing
European director George
Sluizer should commit hara
kiri for his dreadful remake of
his own 1988 chiller. The
story's the same: a man's girl
friend disappears without a
trace. Three years later,
someone claims to know what
happened to her, reviving his
dormant obsession with find
ing her. R
