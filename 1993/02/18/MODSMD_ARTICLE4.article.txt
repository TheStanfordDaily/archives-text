# Activist: media distorts Asians

Stereotypes in such movies as "Come See the Par
adise" and "Sixteen Candles" present skewed pic
tures of Asian-Americans, a media activist asserted
at a presentation last night.
"Often the role of Asians in these movies is to
carry out white male fantasies," said Guy Aoki, pres
ident of the Media Action Network for Asian-Ameri
cans. "With the very recent exception of'The Lover,'
males are shown as asexual nerds or these evil crime
lords and females as the playthings of white males."
Aoki, the group's co-founder, spoke out at the
Asian-American Activities Center in a program titled
"Taking a Stand Against Harmful Media Stereotypes
of Asian-Americans."
He began by presenting a short video depicting ex
amples of cliched Asian-American characters in
movies as well as harmful images in news coverage.
"This negative stereotyping is detrimental on two
levels," Aoki said. "It is harmful in the way we

(Asians) think of ourselves, and it is harmful in the
way non-Asians perceive us."
The presentation also addressed the effects of biased
Asian-American images in news coverage. The video
gave examples of Japanese-bashing during and after
the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor bombing.
In addition, Aoki expressed concern over the por
trayal of Asians as threatening foreigners who want
to buy up the United States. This is a particular con
cern with the upcoming movie adaptation of Michael
Crichton's novel "Rising Sun," he added.
"We're concerned with the fallout and potential re
sentment towards Japanese-looking people," Aoki said.
"We're not defending Japanese businessmen; they
have a lot to own up to, but we see that this could cause
further problems with Asian-American stereotypes."
The group also believes the media has furthered
tensions between African-Americans and Korean-
Americans following the Los Angeles riots.
Laura Park, a board member for the group, said,
"There are tensions between the
groups, but they are trying to get
along. And the media just focused
and perpetuated that tension
rather than trying to shed light
on their efforts."
Media images frequently
showed African-Americans and
Hispanics as victims while giving
very little air time to the Korean-
Americans, Park said. "The Kore

ans would often be shown as face
less figures randomly shooting
after cars. When the TV stations
were approached, they'd say, 'Well,
those Koreans can't speak English
anyway,' but they didn't look hard
enough for those that could."
The Media Action Network
operates by letter-writing, orga
nized phone campaigns and other
direct contact with media sources.
"The biggest weapon we have is
embarrassment," Aoki said.
"Media are concerned mostly
with money, but they don't want
to tarnish their name."
