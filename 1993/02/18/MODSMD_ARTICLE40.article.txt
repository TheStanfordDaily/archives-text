With this week's in-depth reporting on theater,
we'd like to look at plays that have been adapt
ed for the big screen. It's no surprise that many
of these pictures are based on the works of Shakespeare.
Probably the Bard's most adapted work is "The Tem
pest," which such directors as Paul Mazursky and Derek
Jarman have attempted. The latest incarnation, Pros
pero's Books, was helmed by Peter Greenaway, who
brought us the Jacobean tragedy "The Cook, the Thief,
His Wife and Her Lover." He's created a dazzling piece of
visual overkill, using the latest in high-definition video
effects to illustrate what is in each of Prospero's Books of
Magic.
Lorraine Hansberr/s Raisin In the Sun struck gold
both on Broadway and on screen. Sidney Poitier stars in this
poignant tale of a black family struggling to share in the
American Dream by moving out of their neighborhood and
next to people who may not want them there. Keep an econ
omy-size box of Kleenex next to you when you watch it
Many critics thought that Laurence Olivier's version
of Henry V was unsurpassable. But brash wunderkind
Kenneth Branagh proved them wrong, redefining the
play from Olivier's pro-war interpretation to a stirring
portrait of the hellish nature of battle. Brilliant thesps
like Derek Jacobi and Emma Thompson helped Branagh
ride the film to Academy Award nominations for Best
Actor and Director.
Not many people could imagine bad-boy B-director
Abel Ferrara pairing up with the Bard. But that's exactly
what happened in China Girl, a modern-day retelling of
Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." Set in New York's Little
Italy and Chinatown, the film focuses on an Italian good
fella who falls for a Chinese woman. It's not as good as A 1
Pacino's Panic in Needle Park which featured Romeo
and Juliet strung out on heroin, especially since we all
know how the story will end. But Ferrara's final image of
the dead lovers lying dead in the street, index fingers touch
ing one another's, haunts us long after the tape stops.
