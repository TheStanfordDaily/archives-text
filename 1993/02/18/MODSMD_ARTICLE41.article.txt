## Dance all night 
### 
How often can you dance all night and help the
world at the same time?
This Saturday night, go crazy at EBF to the
sounds of The Golden Mantellas and The Royal
Nonesuch, and support "Together Learning" at the
same time.
It's two very danceable rock groups, one cause,
and a lot of happy people.
Tickets, which are available for a $5 donation,
include a raffle ticket for wine, books, t-shirts, gift
baskets, tickets, and crafts from Ghana.
"Together Learning" benefits rural trade edu
cation in West Africa, teaching skills like masonry
and carpentry that aren't available as majors at
Stanford, but are still very important.
The concert starts at 9 p.m., and will last for at
least three hours, so you'll have plenty of time to get
any leftover midterm aggression out.
Tickets can be purchased at the event or in
White Plaza at lunchtime.
