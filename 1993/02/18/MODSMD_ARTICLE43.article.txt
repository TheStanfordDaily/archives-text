# The 						last word on...
## ...body hair 
### 
Though we are children of the '70s, this
is the '90s and body hair is uncool. No supple
armpit hair for women, no monobrows for
men and the hairy back, well, as Nancy would
put it, just say no.
As we approach the turn of the century,
fashion dictates a smooth, streamlined, aerody
namic look. Body hair equals wind resistance,
and like a train whizzing by on superconductor

technology, hairless skin is the new trend.
Like a thundering herd of chihuahuas,
Americans will run around in a nair-frenzy.
Brooke Shields' bushy eyebrows ... gone.
Pink Floyd-esque shaved eyebrows... hip.
Women have long been subjected to a
freshly shaven standard, and now men will fol
low suit. Frolicking in the pectoral ringlets of
your personal Adonis will soon be memories

of a natural past.
Men won't even have moustaches or
beards any more; the most the '90s can do is
sideburns. And chest hair, well, Andre Agassi
doesn't make women swoon in Nike com
mercials like Marky Mark in his tidy-whities.
So long to Beauty and the Beast. Hello Prince.
Take out stock in shaving cream. Trust me.
