Considered
an essential
jazz instru
ment by
some and a horn
abused by many young
children by others, the
trombone is common
ly ignored as a classical
instrument.
Tonight at 8 p.m in
Campbell Recital Hall,
you can hear the return
of pre-classical and
baroque trombone
music in a concert by a
number of Bay-area
and Stanford musicians.

Music will include pieces by Eberlin, Vi
adana and other Austrian and Italian selections.
Tickets are $4/students, $7/other people
who just have a yen for good trombone music.
■ Still bitter?
Valentine's Day might be long gone, but
that doesn't mean your angst is. "The En
chanted Kiss," based on the short story by O.
Henry, is the tale of Sam Tansey, a shy young
man who's desperately in Jove with his land
lady's daughter, and confronts his love and
fears in a series of alcohol-induced fantasies.
Just like Stanford students, right?
The student-directed show features
music by the Stanford University Chamber
Orchestra and members of the San Francisco
Opera Chorus. Another sequence features
dancers directed by Susan Cashion, chair of
the Dance Division.
If you still believe in love gone wrong,
catch "The Enchanted Kiss" at Dinkelspiel
auditorium this Friday and Saturday at 8
p.m. Tickets are $5 for students, $10 general.
■ High School Jazz
Singing the blues from Valentine's Day
or an awful midterm grade? Sit back and
relax to some great jazz with local high
school music departments and the world
renown percussionist, Albert "Tootie"
Heath. You might not have heard of him, but
he's performed with jazz greats like Lester
Young and John Coltrane.
Collaborating with Gunn High School
Jazz Ensemble and Palo Alto High School
Jazz Ensemble, you can hear this living leg
end tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Spangenberg Au
ditorium at Gunn High School. Tickets cost
$7 for students, $10 general.
