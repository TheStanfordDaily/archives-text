# Clinton to Congress: take 'a new direction'
## Stanford profs, give high marks to energy tax 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer With AP wire reports 
President Clinton asked Americans last
night to accept one of the biggest tax in
creases in history, part of a $499 billion plan
to curb massive budget deficits and stimu
late the economy.
"We must do this together," he told a
joint session of Congress.
Urging his audience to pursue "a new di
rection," Clinton proposed increased taxes
on the wealthy and a new broad-based ener
gy tax that would raise consumers' costs for
gasoline, home heating oil and natural gas.
"He is right in saying that we have a serious
long-run problem with respect to the deficit,"
Stanford Economics Prof. John Shoven said.

"This comprehensive package is needed."
Of the plan's components, the energy tax
received the highest marks from Stanford
economists, though not all of them agreed
with the wisdom of raising taxes at all.
"Increasing taxes when we're just coming
out of a recession is not a good thing to do,"
Senior Hoover Fellow Thomas Gale Moore
contended. "It might in fact push us back into
a recession with higher unemployment."
Law Prof. Joe Bankman, a specialist in
tax law, argued the energy tax would not be
as encumbered by undesirable side effects
as most other taxes.
"It's very hard to find a tax that doesn't
discourage some activity that you want to en
courage," he explained. "But with an energy
tax, you don't mind ... because the
activity you're talking about has a neg
ative impact on the environment."
The energy tax would affect every
household with an income of more
than $30,000, Clinton said. The
administration calculated the tax
would raise $71.4 billion by 1998.
The tax would start next July at 2.5
cents a gallon for gasoline, 2.75 cents per
gallon of heating oil and 8.75 cents per
thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Those
figures would triple over three years.
The president insisted that the bur
den of his economic program would
fall most heavily on the wealthy, with
families making more than $140,000
taking the biggest hit.
In addition, Clinton said his plan
includes 150 specific cuts in govern
ment programs that would spread the
pain across a wide cross-section of the
population.
"Our task tonight is to make our
economy rise again," he exhorted the
Congress early in his hour-long

address. And, trying to set aside parti
san differences, he added, "The time
has come for the blame to end."
Administration officials let it be
known that they were bracing for a
monumental fight to get the package
through Congress.
"Everyone of these provisions has
some kind of powerful backer on Capi
tol Hill," White House Budget Direc
tor Leon Panetta said. "But all of
these pieces have to be included in a
comprehensive package."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said Clinton's Monday night
address from the Oval Office probably
helped yesterday's address play well
with the American public.
"What he said on Monday is 'I'm
asking for things which are needed
and you'll hear them on Wednesday,' "
Brody said. "In a sense, he did his own
instant analysis — in advance."
Clinton's budget would cut govern
ment spending by $253 billion over four
years. To do that, he proposed freezing
wages for federal employees this year
and holding them to 1 percent below

the rate of inflation over the next three
years for a savings of $8 billion. Clin
ton's proposal to reduce government
employment by 100,000 over four years
would save $7.9 billion more.
He also proposed new limits on pay
ments that doctors and hospitals
receive under Medicare. In all, the
administration proposed Medicare and
Medicaid savings of $38.4 billion over
the next four years as a "down pay
ment on controlling health care costs."
And the military would be asked to
shoulder an additional $76 billion in
cuts over the next four years above the
reductions already proposed by the
Bush administration.
Shoven, director of the Center for
Economic Policy Research, suggested
Clinton's economic message owed a
debt to one of the presidents oppo
nents in last year's campaign.
"Gee, Perot did win," he joked.
"Part of the appeal of Perot was that
he said we've got to become budgetari
ly responsible."
Meanwhile, in their own attempt to
recall the campaign, Republican con

gressmen wore buttons that said "It's
Spending, Stupid." During the cam
paign, Clinton frequently referred to a
sign at his headquarters reading "It's
the economy, stupid."
More criticism came from House
GOP leader Bob Michel as he delivered
the Republican response to Clinton's
address.
"The American people would do
well to remember," he said, "when you
hear a Democrat call for taxes, do not
ask for whom the tax rises — it will
rise for you."
Senior Hoover Fellow Martin Ander
son echoed the sentiment. "Taxes,
taxes, taxes. That's what he talked
about," he told KCBS radio. "Every
one's going to pay."
Along with the deficit cuts, Clinton
also offered the country a $30 billion
short-term package to stimulate
growth this year.
The package would provide an addi
tional 500,000 jobs over the next two
years and get economic growth up to a
level that would create 8 million new
jobs over the next four years.

Spending, Stupid." During the cam
paign, Clinton frequently referred to a
sign at his headquarters reading "It's
the economy, stupid."
More criticism came from House
GOP leader Bob Michel as he delivered
the Republican response to Clinton's
address.
"The American people would do
well to remember," he said, "when you
hear a Democrat call for taxes, do not
ask for whom the tax rises — it will
rise for you."
Senior Hoover Fellow Martin Ander
son echoed the sentiment. "Taxes,
taxes, taxes. That's what he talked
about," he told KCBS radio. "Every
one's going to pay."
Along with the deficit cuts, Clinton
also offered the country a $30 billion
short-term package to stimulate
growth this year.
The package would provide an addi
tional 500,000 jobs over the next two
years and get economic growth up to a
level that would create 8 million new
jobs over the next four years.
President Clinton asked Americans last
night to accept one of the biggest tax in
creases in history, part of a $499 billion plan
to curb massive budget deficits and stimu
late the economy.
"We must do this together," he told a
joint session of Congress.
Urging his audience to pursue "a new di
rection," Clinton proposed increased taxes
on the wealthy and a new broad-based ener
gy tax that would raise consumers' costs for
gasoline, home heating oil and natural gas.
"He is right in saying that we have a serious
long-run problem with respect to the deficit,"
Stanford Economics Prof. John Shoven said.

"This comprehensive package is needed."
Of the plan's components, the energy tax
received the highest marks from Stanford
economists, though not all of them agreed
with the wisdom of raising taxes at all.
"Increasing taxes when we're just coming
out of a recession is not a good thing to do,"
Senior Hoover Fellow Thomas Gale Moore
contended. "It might in fact push us back into
a recession with higher unemployment."
Law Prof. Joe Bankman, a specialist in
tax law, argued the energy tax would not be
as encumbered by undesirable side effects
as most other taxes.
"It's very hard to find a tax that doesn't
discourage some activity that you want to en
courage," he explained. "But with an energy
tax, you don't mind ... because the
activity you're talking about has a neg
ative impact on the environment."
The energy tax would affect every
household with an income of more
than $30,000, Clinton said. The
administration calculated the tax
would raise $71.4 billion by 1998.
The tax would start next July at 2.5
cents a gallon for gasoline, 2.75 cents per
gallon of heating oil and 8.75 cents per
thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Those
figures would triple over three years.
The president insisted that the bur
den of his economic program would
fall most heavily on the wealthy, with
families making more than $140,000
taking the biggest hit.
In addition, Clinton said his plan
includes 150 specific cuts in govern
ment programs that would spread the
pain across a wide cross-section of the
population.
"Our task tonight is to make our
economy rise again," he exhorted the
Congress early in his hour-long

address. And, trying to set aside parti
san differences, he added, "The time
has come for the blame to end."
Administration officials let it be
known that they were bracing for a
monumental fight to get the package
through Congress.
"Everyone of these provisions has
some kind of powerful backer on Capi
tol Hill," White House Budget Direc
tor Leon Panetta said. "But all of
these pieces have to be included in a
comprehensive package."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said Clinton's Monday night
address from the Oval Office probably
helped yesterday's address play well
with the American public.
"What he said on Monday is 'I'm
asking for things which are needed
and you'll hear them on Wednesday,' "
Brody said. "In a sense, he did his own
instant analysis — in advance."
Clinton's budget would cut govern
ment spending by $253 billion over four
years. To do that, he proposed freezing
wages for federal employees this year
and holding them to 1 percent below

the rate of inflation over the next three
years for a savings of $8 billion. Clin
ton's proposal to reduce government
employment by 100,000 over four years
would save $7.9 billion more.
He also proposed new limits on pay
ments that doctors and hospitals
receive under Medicare. In all, the
administration proposed Medicare and
Medicaid savings of $38.4 billion over
the next four years as a "down pay
ment on controlling health care costs."
And the military would be asked to
shoulder an additional $76 billion in
cuts over the next four years above the
reductions already proposed by the
Bush administration.
Shoven, director of the Center for
Economic Policy Research, suggested
Clinton's economic message owed a
debt to one of the presidents oppo
nents in last year's campaign.
"Gee, Perot did win," he joked.
"Part of the appeal of Perot was that
he said we've got to become budgetari
ly responsible."
Meanwhile, in their own attempt to
recall the campaign, Republican con

gressmen wore buttons that said "It's
Spending, Stupid." During the cam
paign, Clinton frequently referred to a
sign at his headquarters reading "It's
