# Experts discuss RU486
## Profs, praise, pillory French abortion pill

Women who take RU4B6 are being used
as "guinea pigs," Board of Trustees member
Cynthia Cannady said last night, adding
that the abortion pill allows them to pretend
nothing happened within their bodies.
But Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi and
Medical School Assoc. Prof. Linda Giudice
argued in a debate titled "The Future of
RU4B6 in America" that the pill should be
made available to women in the United
States.
The pill "distances the woman from eval
uating what she has done," Cannady told
the excited and packed Fairchild Auditori
um audience. "It helps her not think about
it." Women are cutting themselves off from
power and strength, she added, because
"killing the fetus is killing part of the
woman."
A controversy erupted when Cannady
said that there hadn't been enough testing
of RU4B6, pointing out that one woman

died from taking the pill.
Djerassi, who worked
to synthesize the first oral
contraceptive, rebutted by
saying 150,000 French
women have taken RU4B6
and "you can't test any
thing more than that."
The woman who died from
the pill, he added, was a
heavy smoker and had

been pregnant 13 times.
Giudice, an obstetrician and gynecolo
gist, said that RU4B6 is safer than a surgical
abortion because the infection rate is only
0.1 percent, whereas with surgical abor
tions 10 percent to 15 percent of patients
suffer from infections.
In part, Giudice said she is in favor of
RU4B6 because it "has many other thera
peutical possibilities" and is not just limited
to inducing menstrual cycles.
RU4B6 was originally developed to be
