# Experts discuss RU486
## Profs, praise, pillory French abortion pill 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Women who take RU4B6 are being used
as "guinea pigs," Board of Trustees member
Cynthia Cannady said last night, adding
that the abortion pill allows them to pretend
nothing happened within their bodies.
But Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi and
Medical School Assoc. Prof. Linda Giudice
argued in a debate titled "The Future of
RU4B6 in America" that the pill should be
made available to women in the United
States.
The pill "distances the woman from eval
uating what she has done," Cannady told
the excited and packed Fairchild Auditori
um audience. "It helps her not think about
it." Women are cutting themselves off from
power and strength, she added, because
"killing the fetus is killing part of the
woman."
A controversy erupted when Cannady
said that there hadn't been enough testing
of RU4B6, pointing out that one woman

died from taking the pill.
Djerassi, who worked
to synthesize the first oral
contraceptive, rebutted by
saying 150,000 French
women have taken RU4B6
and "you can't test any
thing more than that."
The woman who died from
the pill, he added, was a
heavy smoker and had

been pregnant 13 times.
Giudice, an obstetrician and gynecolo
gist, said that RU4B6 is safer than a surgical
abortion because the infection rate is only
0.1 percent, whereas with surgical abor
tions 10 percent to 15 percent of patients
suffer from infections.
In part, Giudice said she is in favor of
RU4B6 because it "has many other thera
peutical possibilities" and is not just limited
to inducing menstrual cycles.
RU4B6 was originally developed to be


Djerassi
used as a contraceptive, with the
first clinical trials conducted in
1980. Used in France and Eng
land, it is not yet available in the
United States.
Djerassi said that pharmaceu
tical companies in this country
are not interested in RU4B6
because it would not be prof
itable.
"Many people have the naive
assumption that this is big busi
ness," he said, adding that phar
maceutical companies are mainly
interested in drugs with the
potential to make more than $1
billion a year.
At most, the RU4B6 pill would
be used by the 1.5 million patients
who obtain legal abortions each
year, which Djerassi said would
be "peanuts" for pharmaceutical

companies. They are not interest
ed in "inheriting that headache,"
he added, and have therefore not
applied for permission from the
Food and Drug Administration to
market the drug.
In addition to inducing a men
strual cycle, RU4B6 can be used to
induce labor, block ovulation and
impair implantation of the fertil
ized egg to the uterine wall, Giu
dice said. Studies in rats have also
shown that it can reduce tumors
in breast cancer patients by 50
percent.
RU4B6 does have some side
effects, Giudice said. Nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain and
cramping are commonplace in
patients.
Only 4 to 5 percent of women
who take RU4B6 do not have suc
cessful abortions, Djerassi said.
He added that in one study the
pill failed in 15 cases, but none of
the children were born with birth
defects.
