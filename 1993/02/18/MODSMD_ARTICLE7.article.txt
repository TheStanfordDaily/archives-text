# Students shelter homeless
## Class combines architecture, philanthropy 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Although many Stanford
courses ask students to ponder
the meaning of life, one concen
trates on the more practical
question of what it means to
have no place to live.
As part of an assignment for
Civil Engineering Prof. Paul
Teischoltz's class "Architec
ture â€” Processes and Prac
tices," senior Lewis Kofsky and
juniors Zanthe Jory and Peter
Liang helped answer that
pressing problem by designing
and building a homeless shel
ter.
According to Teischoltz, the
4-year-old class was designed to
make students study the home
less problem. He called around
to local service organizations
and asked what kinds of shelters
they thought were lacking, and
then asked the class to help solve
those problems.
Jory, Liang and Kofsky de
signed and built an eight-foot
square plywood structure to ac
commodate one person. Wheel
chair accessible, the shelter has
plenty of space for a bed and a
desk. An inside ladder leads to an
upper deck in the 12-foot high
building, yielding even more
space. Its high ceiling and wide
windows give it a spacious, open
feeling.
But what makes the shelter
unique is an outer deck, com
plete with a solid railing, which
allows an added element of pri
vacy and personal space.
For Jory, Kofsky and Liang,

the first part of their project in
volved work far removed from a
drafting board. In order to get a
better understanding of the
needs of people without homes,
they interviewed agencies who

worked with the homeless.
Then came the task of design
ing a portable module, as well as
selecting the site on which it

would be placed.
After some initial individual
mind-grinding, they sketched out
their plans and using a computer
aided drafting program, the team
created three-dimensional plans
for the final structure.
Each of the six three-person
groups in the class gave a presen
tation of their plans for a struc
ture, including cost estimates and
specific construction designs.
A panel composed of Teis
choltz, an area contractor and five
local architects got together to
judge the proposals. About three
weeks before Christmas, while

other students were preparing for
finals, the class went to work on
building the winning design.
Teischoltz said he is quite
pleased with this year's results.
"It's a very practical design," he
said. "It's easy to move, it's com
fortable and it's a simple design
that can easily be replicated."
The shelter is designed so
three amateur carpenters could
duplicate the structure in about
eight hours. Although the design
costs about $1,200 to build, the
class used materials donated by
local contractors, he said.
"There have been great [shel
ters! in the past too, but the upper
deck on this structure is nice. It
allows a person to sit out and
enjoy being outdoors, but still
have some privacy," he said.

Teischoltz said he likes the
idea of having students follow the
process from ideas to computer
design to the actual hammer-and
nail construction.
The winning team members
say they got a lot more out of the
project than just an "A."
"The whole process was the
best educational experience," said
Liang. "We're really excited to see
our work over the whole quarter
really take shape in something
tangible. You can actually see it,
walk inside it. It's a great feeling."
The module is currently poised
outside the Terman Engineering
Building, awaiting a few final
touches. After one more coat of
paint, a little trimming and com
pletion of a tar-papered roof, the
module will be donated to Palo

Alto Urban Ministry.
Because the structure is
designed to be a prototype, it does
not meet local building codes or
zoning requirements.
"It's not a permanent struc
ture," said Teischoltz. "Basically,
building codes don't cover ply
wood shacks."
For example, there is no bath
room and no kitchen, but that was
part of the plan. The "shacks" are
meant to be clustered on a cite
with a common service center
with centralized eating, bathing
and nursing facilities.
Instead of being put to use
immediately, it will be disassem
bled in large panels, and reassem
bled at the Urban Ministry for use
as storage facility for clothing
donations.
