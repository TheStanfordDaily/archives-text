# Students shelter homeless
## Class combines architecture, philanthropy 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
Although many Stanford
courses ask students to ponder
the meaning of life, one concen
trates on the more practical
question of what it means to
have no place to live.
As part of an assignment for
Civil Engineering Prof. Paul
Teischoltz's class "Architec
ture â€” Processes and Prac
tices," senior Lewis Kofsky and
juniors Zanthe Jory and Peter
Liang helped answer that
pressing problem by designing
and building a homeless shel
ter.
According to Teischoltz, the
4-year-old class was designed to
make students study the home
less problem. He called around
to local service organizations
and asked what kinds of shelters
they thought were lacking, and
then asked the class to help solve
those problems.
Jory, Liang and Kofsky de
signed and built an eight-foot
square plywood structure to ac
commodate one person. Wheel
chair accessible, the shelter has
plenty of space for a bed and a
desk. An inside ladder leads to an
upper deck in the 12-foot high
building, yielding even more
space. Its high ceiling and wide
windows give it a spacious, open
feeling.
But what makes the shelter
unique is an outer deck, com
plete with a solid railing, which
allows an added element of pri
vacy and personal space.
For Jory, Kofsky and Liang,

the first part of their project in
volved work far removed from a
drafting board. In order to get a
better understanding of the
needs of people without homes,
they interviewed agencies who

worked with the homeless.
Then came the task of design
ing a portable module, as well as
selecting the site on which it

class. The eight-foot square plywood structure can be built in
eight hours for about $1,200.
