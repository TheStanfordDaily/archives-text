# Clinic defenders raise their voices
## Stanford students protect abortion rights at Redwood City clinic 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
The rantings and ravings in front of Red
wood City's Choice Medical Clinic are not ex
actly the intellectual debates most students
expect to be part of their Stanford experience.
"Do you believe in this?" Redwood City
resident Ross Foti shouted, as he pointed to
the photos of aborted fetuses attached to his
large wooden crucifix, complete with a "cru
cified" infant doll.
"Yes. And what about control over our
own bodies?" junior Arbie Johnson said, her
voice raised and strained. She leaned forward
over her "Defend Abortion Rights" sign to
meet Foti's glare.
"Why don't you have control over your
sex?" he shot back, shaking his head and ges
turing at Johnson and the two Stanford stu
dents accompanying her. "Sometimes I won
der if you're human. I'm going to pray for you."
Across the street, Foti's van — which
Johnson called the "deathmobile" — an
nounced the presence of his crew of pro-life
demonstrators. The vehicle is covered with
anti-abortion signs and more pictures of

aborted fetuses, topped off with a statue of
the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus.
Foti — known by demonstrators as just
"Ross" — and three other pro-life advocates
faced off with Johnson and the handful of
students who join her one afternoon a week
to participate in "defending" the clinic.
The purpose of clinic defense is to distract
anti-abortion demonstrators, prevent them
from harassing the clinic's clients and to "make
sure the other side gets heard," Johnson said.
She explained that a handful of students
decided to spend one afternoon a week at the
Choice Medical Clinic after hearing about the
clinic defenses through the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance.
However, since there are usually only a
few clients who enter the clinic each after
noon, much of the students' time is spent in
heated debate with demonstrators like Ross,
Johnson said.
A Redwood City police officer who lingered
in the wings said although an officer is usually
assigned to patrol the weekly confrontations,
the demonstrations are typically "peaceful."
However, Johnson said in the past things
have gotten out of hand and protesters have

been arrested.
As a result, demonstrators on both sides have
been told by the police that the clinic is under a
restraining order, and anyone who touches or
enters the building, or touches demonstrators
from the other side will be arrested.
The nature of the confrontations often de
pends on the number of people demonstrat
ing. Clinic defenders are usually present, and
sometimes representatives from Operation
Rescue, a national pro-life organization,
show up as well.
Sophomore Johanna Lasker, who also
participates in clinic defense, said the yelling
and arguing often reaches "ridiculous" pro
portions, and is always "exhausting" since
Ross and his cohorts are not always the most
rational debaters.
As the afternoon progresses, the two
groups launched into arguments on topics
ranging from homosexuality and pornogra
phy to prostitution. Junior Lin Yip, another
regular clinic defender, pointed out that it is
ironic that the majority of their debates are
not about abortion.

Sophomore Johanna Lasker, left, and junior Arbie Johnson, holding up signs in defense of abortion rights, confront pro-life demon
strator Ross Fotl at an abortion clinic in Redwood City.
Nevertheless, she, Johnson
and Lasker all said their visits are
rarely dull and acknowledged that
they have forged a bizarre sort of
relationship with Ross and the
other "regulars."
Even in the most heated debates,
smiles were thinly veiled behind the
shouting and pointed remarks.
Clearly, each side was amused with
the other — activists from both
sides depend on each other to keep
things from getting dull.
Although Johnson said it is
sometimes "scary" to face Ross and
his group of less-than-subdued
demonstrators, the clinic defend
ers seem to drop any fear when
they step up to the line of fire.
Often they egg the pro-life
demonstrators on, subtly mock
ing them and always challenging
their views. For example, John

son was quick to remind Ross that
he has nine children when he told
her to "control her sex."
"Why don't you control your
sex?" she asked.
"Stop playing games with me!"
he shouted, but he grinned almost
good-naturedly and Johnson
laughed. In fact, none of the con
frontations seemed malicious —
just high spirited.
There were also moments of
shared humor between the two
sides.
As a woman approached the
clinic, Ross and his co-demonstra
tors yelled, "Save your baby!
Don't murder your child!" while
Johnson, Lasker and Yip counter
shouted pro-choice expressions.
The woman walked through
the scene, head bowed in an
attempt to ignore the hubbub, and
finally turned around before she
walked through the clinic's door.
"I'm trying to get pregnant!"
she yelled back, exasperated.
Both groups fell silent,

exchanged glances and shared a
good laugh. Naturally, the merri
ment only lasted until someone
provoked the next argument —
about gun control this time — and
the sides were divided once again.
After about three hours in
front of the clinic, Johnson,
Lasker and Yip returned to the
slightly more tame world of Stan
ford for afternoon classes.
"Wiped out," hungry and a little
frustrated, Lasker said that
although the clinic defenses can
seem pointless and absurd at
times, it is important for people to
see the pro-choice side represented.

"All the people drive by and see
Ithe pro-life demonstrators] and I
think it's comforting for them to
see us there too, kind of providing
the balance," she said.
Johnson added that even
though she realizes arguing with
people like Ross is a waste of ener
gy, she "can't stand to listen to
him say the things he does and
not challenge him."
As she, Lasker and Yip gath
ered up their signs, and headed
off, Ross leaned on his crucifix
and waved a friendly goodbye.
"I don't hate you, you know,"
he said. "I'm praying for you."

sex?" he shot back, shaking his head and ges
turing at Johnson and the two Stanford stu
dents accompanying her. "Sometimes I won
der if you're human. I'm going to pray for you."
Across the street, Foti's van — which
Johnson called the "deathmobile" — an
nounced the presence of his crew of pro-life
demonstrators. The vehicle is covered with
anti-abortion signs and more pictures of

aborted fetuses, topped off with a statue of
the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus.
Foti — known by demonstrators as just
"Ross" — and three other pro-life advocates
faced off with Johnson and the handful of
students who join her one afternoon a week
to participate in "defending" the clinic.
The purpose of clinic defense is to distract
anti-abortion demonstrators, prevent them
from harassing the clinic's clients and to "make
sure the other side gets heard," Johnson said.
She explained that a handful of students
decided to spend one afternoon a week at the
Choice Medical Clinic after hearing about the
clinic defenses through the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance.
However, since there are usually only a
few clients who enter the clinic each after
noon, much of the students' time is spent in
heated debate with demonstrators like Ross,
Johnson said.
A Redwood City police officer who lingered
in the wings said although an officer is usually
assigned to patrol the weekly confrontations,
the demonstrations are typically "peaceful."
However, Johnson said in the past things
have gotten out of hand and protesters have

been arrested.
As a result, demonstrators on both sides have
been told by the police that the clinic is under a
restraining order, and anyone who touches or
enters the building, or touches demonstrators
from the other side will be arrested.
The nature of the confrontations often de
pends on the number of people demonstrat
ing. Clinic defenders are usually present, and
sometimes representatives from Operation
Rescue, a national pro-life organization,
show up as well.
Sophomore Johanna Lasker, who also
participates in clinic defense, said the yelling
and arguing often reaches "ridiculous" pro
portions, and is always "exhausting" since
Ross and his cohorts are not always the most
rational debaters.
As the afternoon progresses, the two
groups launched into arguments on topics
ranging from homosexuality and pornogra
phy to prostitution. Junior Lin Yip, another
regular clinic defender, pointed out that it is
ironic that the majority of their debates are
not about abortion.

Sophomore Johanna Lasker, left, and junior Arbie Johnson, holding up signs in defense of abortion rights, confront pro-life demon
strator Ross Fotl at an abortion clinic in Redwood City.
Nevertheless, she, Johnson
and Lasker all said their visits are
rarely dull and acknowledged that
they have forged a bizarre sort of
relationship with Ross and the
other "regulars."
Even in the most heated debates,
smiles were thinly veiled behind the
shouting and pointed remarks.
Clearly, each side was amused with
the other — activists from both
sides depend on each other to keep
things from getting dull.
Although Johnson said it is
sometimes "scary" to face Ross and
his group of less-than-subdued
demonstrators, the clinic defend
ers seem to drop any fear when
they step up to the line of fire.
Often they egg the pro-life
demonstrators on, subtly mock
ing them and always challenging
their views. For example, John

son was quick to remind Ross that
he has nine children when he told
her to "control her sex."
"Why don't you control your
sex?" she asked.
"Stop playing games with me!"
he shouted, but he grinned almost
good-naturedly and Johnson
laughed. In fact, none of the con
frontations seemed malicious —
just high spirited.
There were also moments of
shared humor between the two
sides.
As a woman approached the
clinic, Ross and his co-demonstra
tors yelled, "Save your baby!
Don't murder your child!" while
Johnson, Lasker and Yip counter
shouted pro-choice expressions.
The woman walked through
the scene, head bowed in an
attempt to ignore the hubbub, and
finally turned around before she
walked through the clinic's door.
"I'm trying to get pregnant!"
she yelled back, exasperated.
Both groups fell silent,

exchanged glances and shared a
good laugh. Naturally, the merri
ment only lasted until someone
provoked the next argument —
about gun control this time — and
the sides were divided once again.
After about three hours in
front of the clinic, Johnson,
Lasker and Yip returned to the
slightly more tame world of Stan
ford for afternoon classes.
"Wiped out," hungry and a little
frustrated, Lasker said that
although the clinic defenses can
seem pointless and absurd at
times, it is important for people to
see the pro-choice side represented.

"All the people drive by and see
Ithe pro-life demonstrators] and I
think it's comforting for them to
see us there too, kind of providing
the balance," she said.
Johnson added that even
though she realizes arguing with
people like Ross is a waste of ener
gy, she "can't stand to listen to
him say the things he does and
not challenge him."
As she, Lasker and Yip gath
ered up their signs, and headed
off, Ross leaned on his crucifix
and waved a friendly goodbye.
"I don't hate you, you know,"
he said. "I'm praying for you."

A van that junior Arbie Johnson calls the "deathmobile" announces
the presense of pro-life demonstrators outside the clinic.
The rantings and ravings in front of Red
wood City's Choice Medical Clinic are not ex
actly the intellectual debates most students
expect to be part of their Stanford experience.
"Do you believe in this?" Redwood City
resident Ross Foti shouted, as he pointed to
the photos of aborted fetuses attached to his
large wooden crucifix, complete with a "cru
cified" infant doll.
"Yes. And what about control over our
own bodies?" junior Arbie Johnson said, her
voice raised and strained. She leaned forward
over her "Defend Abortion Rights" sign to
meet Foti's glare.
"Why don't you have control over your
sex?" he shot back, shaking his head and ges
turing at Johnson and the two Stanford stu
dents accompanying her. "Sometimes I won
der if you're human. I'm going to pray for you."
