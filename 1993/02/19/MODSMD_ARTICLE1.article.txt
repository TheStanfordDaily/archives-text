# Clinic defenders raise their voices
## Stanford students protect abortion rights at Redwood City clinic 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
The rantings and ravings in front of Red
wood City's Choice Medical Clinic are not ex
actly the intellectual debates most students
expect to be part of their Stanford experience.
"Do you believe in this?" Redwood City
resident Ross Foti shouted, as he pointed to
the photos of aborted fetuses attached to his
large wooden crucifix, complete with a "cru
cified" infant doll.
"Yes. And what about control over our
own bodies?" junior Arbie Johnson said, her
voice raised and strained. She leaned forward
over her "Defend Abortion Rights" sign to
meet Foti's glare.
"Why don't you have control over your
sex?" he shot back, shaking his head and ges
turing at Johnson and the two Stanford stu
dents accompanying her. "Sometimes I won
der if you're human. I'm going to pray for you."
Across the street, Foti's van — which
Johnson called the "deathmobile" — an
nounced the presence of his crew of pro-life
demonstrators. The vehicle is covered with
anti-abortion signs and more pictures of

aborted fetuses, topped off with a statue of
the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus.
Foti — known by demonstrators as just
"Ross" — and three other pro-life advocates
faced off with Johnson and the handful of
students who join her one afternoon a week
to participate in "defending" the clinic.
The purpose of clinic defense is to distract
anti-abortion demonstrators, prevent them
from harassing the clinic's clients and to "make
sure the other side gets heard," Johnson said.
She explained that a handful of students
decided to spend one afternoon a week at the
Choice Medical Clinic after hearing about the
clinic defenses through the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance.
However, since there are usually only a
few clients who enter the clinic each after
noon, much of the students' time is spent in
heated debate with demonstrators like Ross,
Johnson said.
A Redwood City police officer who lingered
in the wings said although an officer is usually
assigned to patrol the weekly confrontations,
the demonstrations are typically "peaceful."
However, Johnson said in the past things
have gotten out of hand and protesters have

been arrested.
As a result, demonstrators on both sides have
been told by the police that the clinic is under a
restraining order, and anyone who touches or
enters the building, or touches demonstrators
from the other side will be arrested.
The nature of the confrontations often de
pends on the number of people demonstrat
ing. Clinic defenders are usually present, and
sometimes representatives from Operation
Rescue, a national pro-life organization,
show up as well.
Sophomore Johanna Lasker, who also
participates in clinic defense, said the yelling
and arguing often reaches "ridiculous" pro
portions, and is always "exhausting" since
Ross and his cohorts are not always the most
rational debaters.
As the afternoon progresses, the two
groups launched into arguments on topics
ranging from homosexuality and pornogra
phy to prostitution. Junior Lin Yip, another
regular clinic defender, pointed out that it is
ironic that the majority of their debates are
not about abortion.
