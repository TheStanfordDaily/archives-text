Hundreds drown in Haiti
PETIT GOAVE, Haiti (AP) - A
packed ferry carrying up to 1,500 people
sank in stormy seas oft Haiti, and only
285 people were known to have survived,
the Red Cross said yesterday.
Survivors told how they clung to float
ing objects, in one case a bag of charcoal,
to stay alive.
"The sea was full of people," said one
survivor, 29-year-old Madeleine Julien,
from her hospital bed in this coastal town.
"I kept bumping into drowned people."
The ferry Neptune went down late Tues
day off Petit Goave, 60 miles west of the cap
ital. But communications are so crude out
side the capital it took a group of about 60
survivors a day to first report the accident.
U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Larry Mizell

said there was no correlation between
the accident and the tens of thousands of
Haitian "boat people" who have fled their
homeland by sea since 1991.
