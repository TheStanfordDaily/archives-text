# Clinton's cuts less than expected
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's budget plan, billed as taking a
$493 billion bite out of the deficit over
the next four years, would actually cut
the deficit by just $325 billion during
that period, according to documents
released yesterday by the administration.
The new figures showed that when
the costs of Clinton's investment pro
gram were taken into account, the deficit
reduction figure is 34 percent smaller
than the half-trillion-dollar figure pro
moted by the administration Wednesday.
The discrepancy came to light yester
day when the Office of Budget and Man
agement released the full 145-page book
describing Clinton's program. A sum
mary table on page 22 of that document
showed that the $493 billion in spend
ing cuts and tax increases over four
years gets reduced by $169 billion after
taking into account areas where Clinton

proposed increasing government spend
ing or cutting taxes.
The table rounds the difference
between those two figures up to $325
billion. The book describes the smaller
figure as a "gross deficit reduction,"
while the larger figure was called simply
"total deficit reduction."
Office of Management and Budget
Director Leon Panetta defended the use
of both figures and said there was no
intent to mislead people about the plan.
Republicans pointed to the shortfall
as evidence that Clinton's figures don't
add up.
A senior administration official,
speaking on condition that his name not
be used, acknowledged yesterday that
Wednesday's figures "might have been
misleading" because they didn't specify
that the $493 billion total did not include
the costs of the stimulus program.

On Wednesday, Panetta had told
reporters that critics who attacked Clin
ton's plan would be held to the same rigid
standards of honesty the administration
had used in putting the plan together.
"No gimmicks, no caps, none of the
kind of smoke and mirrors that we've
seen in the last few years," Panetta said.
Yesterday, Panetta said that the
summary page that distinguishes a
"gross" deficit reduction from a "total"
deficit reduction was not distributed
with other budget documents on
Wednesday because it wasn't completed.
Top Democrats in Congress came to
the administration's defense. House Bud
get Committee Chairman Martin Sabo,
D-Minn., said that the important figure
was the $140 billion in deficit savings
Clinton's plan would achieve in 1997.
"That is real dollars, not smoke and
mirrors," Sabo said.
