Program Board should
advise student groups
on funding possibilities

Although the assu Pro
gram Board fulfills its duties
well, the time has come for it
to evolve beyond its current allo
cating status into a more advisory
role.
The board needs to provide more
support to new student groups,
because while the reserviors
around Stanford fill with water,
funding for student groups is dry
ing up. University budget cuts
have forced academic departments
to limit their contributions to cam
pus organizations.
The Program Board manages
two funds â€” an annual fund that
provides $106,000 to 36 well-estab
lished organizations throughout
the year, and an additional $77,000
discretionary fund that the board
doles out to new or small organiza
tions. Before issuing money, the
board conducts interviews with all
applicants to give them an opportu
nity to defend their requests after
the funding decisions are made.
Having heard hundreds of pro
posals over the years, several board
members have extensive experi
ence in evaluating budgets and pro
gram proposals.
It's time to put that expertise to
better use. The board should trans
form itself into a more active and
advisory organization that not only
assigns money but also issues
advice and gives direction to fledg
ing student groups.
As the traditional sources of
on-campus donations shrink, stu
dent organizations should be tar
geting new sources both on and off
campus. Yet 40 percent of the com
munity service organizations that
requested Program Board support
this quarter listed the ASSU as
their sole source of funds. Nearly
half of the non-service groups had
no other sources of funding besides

the ASSU or University Depart
ments.
With this dangerous trend in
mind, the board should begin
directing students to other sources
of funding on and off campus. It
should work with the University's
Office of Student Activities to com
pile a list of various funds and
foundations that might make con
tributions to student groups. This
information should be consolidated
into a binder that should be updat
ed frequently.
Some examples of unconven
tional sources that the board
should direct students to are the
Ho and Irvine Foundation funds
for multicultural development, the
Packard and Hewlett Foundations,
and the Penninsula Community
Foundation. The last organization
manages a library that lists infor
mation on about 8,700 national
and local foundations. According to
Librarian Georgia McDaniel, only
10 Stanford students a year visit
the library.
The framework for these
changes in the board are already in
place. Beginning this year, the Pro
gram Board has established "pre
interviews" with student groups in
order to look over their preliminary
proposals and point out any major
flaws or mistakes in the budget.
According to Program Board
Chair Patricia Bowlin, these meet
ings were started to "weed out
bugs" in the budgets themselves,
so that when the board conducts
the formal interview Of the budget,
they can focus attention on the
merits of the proposal.
These previews are an impor
tant first step in that they would
provide an ideal opportunity to
inform and advise budding student
groups on the many options they
have for funding.
Bowlin said she hopes to expand
and strengthen the preview
boards next quarter. Hopefully,
the board will use the opportunity
to help student groups crawl from
the shrinking pool of Stanford
into the oceans of the outside com
munity.
