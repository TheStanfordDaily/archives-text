## Slugs and three-year plans 
### 
SURE, I THINK THAT A MILLION
and one things that go on around the
world are stupid: dressing up for
interviews, chopping the tails off puppies,
the TV commercials asking me to take a
new look at plastics, but I don't want to
bother you with all of them.
Last night, I was busy working on my
computer, when it suddenly occurred to me
that maybe I should get a radiation shield.
My giant amazon glue slug sort of prompted
me. The slug's about the quality of toy you'd
expect as a birthday present from a dorm
mate, accompanied by a Safeway clown cake.
It's made out of the same stuff as those
octopi with suction cups that we had in fifth
grade, the kind that waddled down walls and
stuck to hairballs. I really started thinking
about getting a radiation shield, because the
slug and I had a little tete & tete ...
Slug: Hi, I've just become sentient. What's
up?
Me: ACK! Ooops, I guess I left you on top
of my computer for too long. Well, um,
Valentine's Day is over.
S: I didn't get any Valentines; I'm a
hermaphrodite and no one asked me.
M: You weren't alive yet and can't read.
S: Can too. Here let me prove it, hold
something up, these eye-stalks aren't just
for show.
M: How's this? [holds up The Daily's
Opinion page)
S: blah blah blah . . . idols, ethnicity, sex,
sex, sex, ... I should have stayed inani

mate.
M: How about the front page? Would that
be better?
S: Sure, whatever, [reads] What's that?
[points stalk at three-year undergraduate
plan article]
M: University President Gerhard Casper
is proposing a three-year undergraduate
plan. He thinks that it should be a recog
nized track, not just a shadowy option
offered on back-streets. But I don't get it.
How could anyone finish in three years?
S: It only takes about a week to learn how
to drive a forklift.
M: True, but what does he expect from us
anyway? Maybe it's all some sort of insidi
ous plan to shuffle us out of here faster,
while increasing tuition. What if all of those
people who get out in three years look back
at Stanford and all they see are dusty library
books, computer screens and exams? That
won't help us re-establish the University as
a pillar of higher education, just a bache
lor's-degree factory. What about social
interaction, learning to live with one anoth
er and dorm back-rub workshops?
S: Listen, spud, you've been here three
and-a-half years, and yeah, right, you're so
socially adjusted and have learned to live
with other people. Who needs all that
junk? For all I care, they can just have this
giant assembly line and pop out a graduate
every 20 minutes. Then on the brochures
they can say, "We produce a healthy, pro
ductive member of society every 20 min

utes! Never mind that he wasted the best
years of his life with his nose in a book,
and now is locked in a dead-end job until
he dies, or wins Keno." In the Oval, the
school can set up one of those billboards
with moving numbers, like McDonald's
has for "customers served" or the news
with "your share of the national debt." So
don't come crying to me about no life, try
being a glue slug. Thank God I'm a
hermaphrodite.
M: Sorry, go talk to the lichen in my laun
dry bag for advice, I have to go to Sweet
Hall.
S: Whine, whine, whine ...
(two women burst in to wish my room
mate a happy birthday)
Woman 1: What's this?
[touches slug]
S: Ow! Stop that!
Wl: (shriek)
S: (deathly gasp)
At least it didn't bore the slug. I really
need that radiation shield.

To reassure those of you who thought that
it might have been a bad bit of cheese, yes,
that was Kenny at the Viennese Ball, but if
you think he slept out or worked for those
tickets, it was bad cheese.
