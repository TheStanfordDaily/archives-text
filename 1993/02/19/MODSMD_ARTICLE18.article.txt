Free beer and fraternity parties shouldn't be synonymous

THE UNDERLYING assumptions
of The Daily editorial of Feb. 18 on
BYOB parties is representative of a
very pervasive view of fraternities that
needs to be re-evaluated. As the former
president of a Stanford fraternity, I am
all too familiar with this attitude, since I
see it every weekend.
Personally I have not made up my
mind regarding BYOB parties (and as a
senior, I do not care), though I can see
both good (reduced liability) and bad
(Coors) points. In this letter, I would
like to explore the pervasive view of fra
ternities on this campus which I men
tioned. I find it amazing how fraternities
are consistently mocked in the pages of
The Daily (which hurts me a lot, really),
but when we discuss taking FREE
BEER away from this campus, listen to
the uproar.
"Offering students free alcohol on
campus provides a safe alternative —
they can walk home after one too
many." Excuse me, but the beer at fra
ternity parties is far from free. Who said
that it was the Greek system's responsi

bility to open our homes (and wallets) to
hundreds of strangers? Where in our
charter does it say that we have to pro
vide this campus with more of a social
life than a "Sunday church ice cream
social?"
God forbid students have to "pur
chase their own alcohol!!" Better to let
the date-rapin', beer-chuggin', homo
phobic, racist, elitist, anti-intellectual
frat dicks take the risks associated with
providing all the minors on campus with
warm, foamy Meister Brau.
Secondly, seniors might remember
that just walking home after one too
many is not as easy as it sounds. Who
knows? You might meet the business
end of a Mack truck on your way home.
In such a case guess who is responsible?
The minor who took advantage of the
fraternity's hospitality, imbibed their
free beer and then got them on social
suspension, or the fraternity who sup
plied a friendly beer? Yes, the fraternity.
Aside from probation, suspension, writ
ten officer transition plans and any
other creative judicial-board sanction

that might come about, the fraternity is
also very, very, very liable in a court of
law, should mommy and daddy decide to
pursue the American dream and get rich
by suing the pants off someone. Hence,
fraternities all across the country are
experiencing rising liability insurance
rates and "exceptional pressure" not to
break the law by providing alcohol to
minors. Through your belittling of this
pressure from the University, our
national organizations and the police,
you demonstrate your ignorance of the
issues involved. I don't like the LAW any
more than anyone else, but I like jail
and/or a lawsuit even less. Such lawsuits
have resulted in the garnishing of frater
nity officers' wages for the rest of their
lives! Is free beer worth that much to
you?
"Instead of BYOB, the Office of Stu
dent Activities should explore the possi
bility of requiring partygoers to sign
forms releasing fraternities of liability."
Brilliant idea, NOT. It would hold less
water that a wet paper bag in a court of
law and a form of it has been tried

already.
While it may prevent liability con
~—r.z, ll wiii do nothing to keep Stan
ford's finest from closing down our par
ties and arresting our officers because
we are serving minors.
I am not a big fan of the supposed
elitism of the Greek system, but why
should I spend my money buying cheap
beer for total strangers who are going to
make a mess in my house, when I could
spend less money, buy better beer and
know everyone at the party? There are
few things more frustrating than seeing
someone get completely irate because I
won't give him/her beer that I paid for;
and when I tell him/her to stop throwing
toilet paper and shaving cream around
my bathroom he looks at me like I'm
crazy. "Free beer at fraternity parties"
should not be something in life that you
can count on, like death and taxes, but
rather something that you should appre
ciate and maybe even be remotely grate
ful for.
