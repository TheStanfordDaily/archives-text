# Daily's independence defended in response to Kennedy's remarks
## 
### 
Regarding your article on The
Daily's independence anniversary
(Jan. 29), I wish to make some com
ments on former University President
Don Kennedy's assertion that The
Daily is not fully independent because
it uses the Stanford name and a Uni
versity building. Kennedy's definition
of an independent newspaper is one
which owns its own real estate and
charges for its newspapers.
First, the Storke Student Publica
tions Building, where The Daily leases

space, was entirely constructed from
contributions from former Daily Edi
tor Thomas Storke, The Daily and
other student publications. The Uni
versity didn't pay a nickel; it just pro
vided land which could be leased.
In other words, it's the same situa
tion as with the businesses in the
Stanford Shopping Center and Stan
ford Industrial Park.
Unlike the Harvard Crimson, The
Daily can't buy its land, because the
Stanford's founding grant prohibits
the sale of any University land.
However, The Daily does pay for
certain building maintenance and
reimburses the University for police
and fire protection.
Second, in the 19705, the Universi
ty made it clear that it wanted to pay

for The Daily through a bulk-subscrip
tion fee so that copies could be deliv
ered to its staff without them having
to shell out coins each morning.
By the way, how does the adminis
tration pay for all those subscriptions
to the San Francisco Chronicle and
the New York Times?
Third, the University licensed the
name Stanford to The Daily, just as it
licenses its name to companies selling
athletic clothing and key rings.
Fourth, the Friends of The Stanford
Daily Foundation was incorporated in
1991 by The Daily and its alumni as an
independent corporation to support
The Daily's activities, and further
ensure its journalistic and financial
independence. We know of no other
college newspaper with such a support

ing organization as The Friends foun
dation.
