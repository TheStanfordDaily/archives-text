# Late forms force students to rush for financial aid
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Recent changes in federal fi
nancial aid programs have delayed
the mailing of California State
Grant applications by more than
two weeks, leaving students
scrambling to meet the scholar
ship's March 2 deadline.
But University financial aid of
ficials maintain that students will
have enough time to complete the
application, usually mailed in
early February. It requires,
among other things, that appli
cants' parents fill out tax forms.
Because of a delay in the arrival
of revamped federal financial aid
forms, the University's financial
aid office had been paralyzed in
mailing applications until this
week. As of yesterday, some appli
cants still had not received their
scholarship packets.
"We normally mail in the last
week of January," said Ann
McKenna, assistant director of
need assessment and quality con
trol in the Financial Aids Office.

This year, however, the office did
not receive the required tax and
information forms from the gov
ernment until the first week of
February.
McKenna attributed the delay
to the passage of the Higher Edu
cation Act over the summer,
which reformed some federal fi
nancial aid policies. "They autho
rized a new form, and that form
took a long time to develop," she
said. "There was also time needed
for input from the state."
Under the reauthorization, the
government lends financial aid
money directly to students, rather
than paying a subsidy to banks to
make the loans. In addition, the
calculation of assets used to deter
mine aid eligibility no longer takes
into account equity in home or col
lege savings accounts.
After the federal forms arrived
at Stanford, the office needed to col
late the federal documents with the
University's own financial aid ap
plication before mailing the entire
packet to waiting students.
The delays have left prospective
scholarship recipients with just over
a week to file before the Cal Grant
deadline, one of the earliest among
the country's large aid programs.
The Cal Grant is open to Cali
fornia residents. Cal Grant A, the
grant most students are eligible to
receive, has a maximum award of
$4,45*2.
McKenna could not say how
many Stanford students benefit
from the scholarship.
"We've definitely heard from

concerned students," McKenna
said, in reference to the delay. "But
I don't think there's going to be a
huge effect on whether people will
be able to get them in on time."
But prospective recipients
seem more worried, claiming the
applications can take up to six
hours to fill out.
"I've definitely been both
ered," said sophomore Heather
Jeavons, who already receives a
Cal Grant and is requesting
renewal but has not received an
application. "I was talking to my
parents the other night and freak
ing out about where it is."
Although Jeavons said her par
ents have readied their tax informa
tion, "[the application] is not some

th ing you j ust fill out and get done."
Michelle Mello, chair of the
ASSU Financial Aid Advocates,
downplayed the impact of the
delay. "It's not an emergency,"
she said. "Hopefully, people have
been planning this out, and their
parents have their taxes figured
out. If that's done, there shouldn't
be too much of a problem."
"They should have plenty of
time," she said. "It only takes
about half an hour to complete."
Junior Eric Sword, who also is
currently on a Cal Grant, said
that even with taxes done, the
scholarship material "takes a cou
ple of hours." Sword has not yet
received this year's application.
"It's going to be tight, but I

have to do it â€” I'm not going to
turn down a Cal Grant," he said.
"Sending the forms to my parents
and getting them back here will
make things inconvenient."
McKenna said she has received
the most anxious calls from
prospective freshman and other
first-time Cal Grant applicants.
"They're overwhelmed by the
number of different things they
have to do," she said.
Sophomore Diana Cruz is in
such a situation. "It doesn't look
too good," she said.
McKenna and Mello said the
Financial Aids Office and the
ASSU will be available to assist
students with any financial aid
applications next week.
