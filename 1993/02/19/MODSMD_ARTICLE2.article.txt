# Late forms force students to rush for financial aid

Recent changes in federal fi
nancial aid programs have delayed
the mailing of California State
Grant applications by more than
two weeks, leaving students
scrambling to meet the scholar

have enough time to complete the
application, usually mailed in
early February. It requires,
among other things, that appli
cants' parents fill out tax forms.

forms, the University's financial
aid office had been paralyzed in
mailing applications until this

cants still had not received their
scholarship packets.

which reformed some federal fi
nancial aid policies. "They autho

took a long time to develop," she

than paying a subsidy to banks to
make the loans. In addition, the
calculation of assets used to deter
mine aid eligibility no longer takes
into account equity in home or col
lege savings accounts.
After the federal forms arrived
at Stanford, the office needed to col

University's own financial aid ap
