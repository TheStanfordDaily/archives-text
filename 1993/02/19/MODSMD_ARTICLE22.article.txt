# Joel Stein: Perfume for Reality

IT'S THE
KIND OF THING THAT PREVENTS
people at Stanford from becoming den
tists, and supermodels from avoiding
ugly, heroin-emaciated rock stars.
Fame and infamy have been blurred so
badly in American culture that middle
age women who had sex with 16-year-old
men agree to appear on Donahue. It
forced once-great, '70s rockers, Foreigner
to perform "dinner theater" at the Circle
Star. It permits large-breasted women to
shed their clothes in the name of Babak
Ebrahimian.
Going to law school is for wimps, says
the new American doctrine. Not when
there's fame at the door. After all, who's
cooler — an Olympic medalist or a really
talented investment banker? Yes, even if
it's in ping-pong.
Reality fuses with corporate-produced
fantasy, just like it did when the talkies
first came out. Dylan is going out with
Kelly in real life? Kramer wears his hair
like that off camera? The kid who plays
Screech really is an annoying dork? Get
us a therapist and strong dose of Valium.
Things have gotten so out of control

that Disney mogul-wannabe JefT Katzen
berg told the press he thought it was high
time a cartoon character, oh, say,
Aladdin, was given a best-actor nomina
tion.
Real people have gotten in the way of
the purpose of fame — to give the rest of
the country a reason to live. And if affir
mation means a well built cartoon-Arab
with a nose patterned after the decidedly
non-Arab Tom Cruise, then so be it.
Doing something important for the
rest of society is a long road to recogni
tion that is as passe as ordering baked
Alaska. Why settle for 10 minutes on a
talk show, when, thanks to cable televi
sion, you can have your own talk show for
the whole hour.
As Time and Newsweek make their
bylines larger and larger, The Daily has
come up with an innovative way to make
their own writers famous: phase out the
article, phase in the columns. With 14
columnists this volume, The Daily might
just put an end to the arcane custom of
introducing your friends at fraternity
parties.
Because, after all, what's the point of
doing something if no one is going to
know about it? Why key grip unless
everyone is going to know you key
gripped? There must have been some

point in the past when people were
ashamed to be "best boy," but those days
are decidedly over.
Turns out the family is dead, laughed
out of existence. Apprenticing with your
dad in the smithery is no longer an option
for emulation. And if the ex-.vife and ex
kids aren't around to give you the respect
and idolatry you need and deserve, then
maybe it's best to try out for "Studs"
instead.
It's not the need for immortality that
does it, because, come to think of it, who
can remember the name of the woman
who played Janet on "Three's Compa
ny"? And who would remember Soleil
Moonfrye if it weren't for that breast
reduction she got last year? And those
who did remember, were just happy that
they didn't have to readjust their dusty
Punky Brewster dolls after all.
No, fame is useful because it is power,
in fact, it's better than power. It's the
kind of power that makes people go to
bad restaurants in New York just
because you go their a lot. It's the kind of
power that makes women dress in
embarrassing ways when you ask them
to dinner. It's the kind of power that pre
vents you from stuttering. The kind of
power for which you might seriously con
sider sending $20 in check or money

order to: P.O. Box 5212, Pueblo, CO.,
25160.
Anyone can be rich. But it takes a
unique combination of sycophancy, solip
sism and vocabulary to impress people
enough to remember your face. Enough
so that people who aren't exactly sure
who you are, feel free to make aspersions
on your moral character when you pop up
in conversation.
And everyone wants it. There are no
more Greta Garbos who want to hide
from the public. Just incarnations of
nothingness that get turned into icons.
What did Ed McMahon do to make his
name and face useful to both Johnny
Carson and Publisher's Clearinghouse?
Is Bob Villa really the best carpenter in
the country?
No. America just needs a huge pool of
names and faces keep it moving. The
Barbi Twins have become something to
aim for. For, although you might not
want to put sand in your mouth and paw
your sister's breasts, it would be nice not
to be the one looking at two sisters
putting sand in their .mouth and pawing
each others' breasts.
So when America crowds around the
television to listen to famous people
embarrass themselves as they try to find
an socially-acceptable section to grab the

little Oscar guy by, don't bother wonder
ing why anyone would subject themselves
and their children to three full hours of
this on a school night.
And don't let yourself get that pathet
ic glimmer of hope when you feel the urge
to mumble about how if you won, you
would dress better and not say "urn" so
much.
Just remember that if it weren't for
that little golden guy with good posture,
all the heroes in this country would be
inside traders and a couple of guys with
an odd knack for a root canal. And, com
pared to seeing you and your sister on a
billboard on the 405 North, it seems that
a life of quiet desperation just isn't
enough to live for anymore.

they didn't have to readjust their dusty
Punky Brewster dolls after all.
No, fame is useful because it is power,
in fact, it's better than power. It's the
kind of power that makes people go to
bad restaurants in New York just
because you go their a lot. It's the kind of
power that makes women dress in
embarrassing ways when you ask them
to dinner. It's the kind of power that pre
vents you from stuttering. The kind of
power for which you might seriously con
sider sending $20 in check or money

order to: P.O. Box 5212, Pueblo, CO.,
25160.
Anyone can be rich. But it takes a
unique combination of sycophancy, solip
sism and vocabulary to impress people
enough to remember your face. Enough
so that people who aren't exactly sure
who you are, feel free to make aspersions
on your moral character when you pop up
in conversation.
And everyone wants it. There are no
more Greta Garbos who want to hide
from the public. Just incarnations of
nothingness that get turned into icons.
What did Ed McMahon do to make his
name and face useful to both Johnny
Carson and Publisher's Clearinghouse?
Is Bob Villa really the best carpenter in
the country?
No. America just needs a huge pool of
names and faces keep it moving. The
Barbi Twins have become something to
aim for. For, although you might not
want to put sand in your mouth and paw
your sister's breasts, it would be nice not
to be the one looking at two sisters
putting sand in their .mouth and pawing
each others' breasts.
So when America crowds around the
television to listen to famous people
embarrass themselves as they try to find
an socially-acceptable section to grab the

little Oscar guy by, don't bother wonder
ing why anyone would subject themselves
and their children to three full hours of
this on a school night.
And don't let yourself get that pathet
ic glimmer of hope when you feel the urge
to mumble about how if you won, you
would dress better and not say "urn" so
much.
Just remember that if it weren't for
that little golden guy with good posture,
all the heroes in this country would be
inside traders and a couple of guys with
an odd knack for a root canal. And, com
pared to seeing you and your sister on a
billboard on the 405 North, it seems that
a life of quiet desperation just isn't
enough to live for anymore.

F
IT'S THE
KIND OF THING THAT PREVENTS
people at Stanford from becoming den
tists, and supermodels from avoiding
ugly, heroin-emaciated rock stars.
Fame and infamy have been blurred so
badly in American culture that middle
age women who had sex with 16-year-old
men agree to appear on Donahue. It
forced once-great, '70s rockers, Foreigner
to perform "dinner theater" at the Circle
Star. It permits large-breasted women to
shed their clothes in the name of Babak
Ebrahimian.
Going to law school is for wimps, says
the new American doctrine. Not when
there's fame at the door. After all, who's
cooler — an Olympic medalist or a really
talented investment banker? Yes, even if
it's in ping-pong.
Reality fuses with corporate-produced
fantasy, just like it did when the talkies
first came out. Dylan is going out with
Kelly in real life? Kramer wears his hair
like that off camera? The kid who plays
Screech really is an annoying dork? Get
us a therapist and strong dose of Valium.
Things have gotten so out of control

that Disney mogul-wannabe JefT Katzen
berg told the press he thought it was high
time a cartoon character, oh, say,
Aladdin, was given a best-actor nomina
tion.
Real people have gotten in the way of
the purpose of fame — to give the rest of
the country a reason to live. And if affir
mation means a well built cartoon-Arab
with a nose patterned after the decidedly
non-Arab Tom Cruise, then so be it.
Doing something important for the
rest of society is a long road to recogni
tion that is as passe as ordering baked
Alaska. Why settle for 10 minutes on a
talk show, when, thanks to cable televi
sion, you can have your own talk show for
the whole hour.
As Time and Newsweek make their
bylines larger and larger, The Daily has
come up with an innovative way to make
their own writers famous: phase out the
article, phase in the columns. With 14
columnists this volume, The Daily might
just put an end to the arcane custom of
introducing your friends at fraternity
parties.
Because, after all, what's the point of
doing something if no one is going to
know about it? Why key grip unless
everyone is going to know you key
gripped? There must have been some

point in the past when people were
ashamed to be "best boy," but those days
are decidedly over.
Turns out the family is dead, laughed
out of existence. Apprenticing with your
dad in the smithery is no longer an option
for emulation. And if the ex-.vife and ex
kids aren't around to give you the respect
and idolatry you need and deserve, then
maybe it's best to try out for "Studs"
instead.
It's not the need for immortality that
does it, because, come to think of it, who
can remember the name of the woman
who played Janet on "Three's Compa
ny"? And who would remember Soleil
Moonfrye if it weren't for that breast
reduction she got last year? And those
who did remember, were just happy that
they didn't have to readjust their dusty
Punky Brewster dolls after all.
No, fame is useful because it is power,
