## Cardinal falls flat, skid hits 10 games in 72-64 loss 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
At the ESPN Thursday night dance
party, the Stanford men's basketball
team missed a few songs that they should
have grooved to, again leaving them
selves out in the cold and allowing UCLA
to walk away with the girl.
After trailing by a mere 34-33 margin
at halftime, the Cardinal missed several
easy shots to begin the second half and
the Bruins, behind a 12 point offensive
outburst from center Richard Petruska,
pulled away to win 72-64 before only
3,776 at Maples Pavilion.
"It's the same observations unfortu
nately we've had way too many times,"
said Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"I just wish we could shwt the ball bet
ter. We get good looks at the basket and
the ball doesn't go down."
Stanford (6-17, 1-10 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) began the evening appearing as if it
would halt its current 10-game losing
skid. Playing with newfound intensity,
the Cardinal squad was able to vary its
offense on account of a seemingly resur
gent inside game. Stanford led by as
many as five {joints in the first 10 min
utes of the contest before (17-7, 7-
5) narrowed the gap to the point where

the teams traded baskets for the remain
der of the opening period.
Darren Allaway, still recovering from a
sprained ankle, provided muscle in the
post to counter UCLA's big front line. The
freshman forward collected a game-high
11 rebounds — seven on the offensive end
— to provide Stanford with second
chance shot opportunities. Meanwhile,
Bart Lammersen displayed a new-found
confidence at center, displacing an unpro
ductive Jim Morgan seven minutes into
the game. The sophomore reserve tallied
14 points and nine rebounds — both
career highs — in 31 minutes of play.
"We saw some things from Bart that we
haven't seen in a while," Montgomery said.
"We had a couple post guys in there at least
working hard, so that's encouraging."
The first half was a defensive struggle,
as both teams' shooting was under 50 per
cent. Unlike in recent efforts, the Cardinal
matched its opponents' aggressiveness
near the basket. With six minutes remain
ing in the first half, the teams exchanged a
series of blocks on three straight trips
downcourt, with the Bruins' Ed O'Ban
non — who led UCLA with 18 points —
garnering two and Stanford's Brent
Williams, who finished with 16, earning
the other. There were 13 combined
blocked shots between the two teams.

But the initial moments after the
intermission led to Stanford's downfall.
UCLA went on a 7-0 run to widen its lead
to eight, but while Montgomery called a
timeout to stop the Bruins' momentum,
that one spurt proved to be the difference.
"We just went out and executed our
offense," said UCLA coach Jim Harrick.
"In the first half, we were only making
one or two passes before taking a shot,
and we like to make five or six. In the sec
ond half we did that, and we got really
good shots."
Stanford was hindered additionally by
foul trouble, earning four team fouls during
UCLA's spurt. Midway through the second
half, UCLA was in the bonus, and conse
quently went to the free throw line twice as
many times as the Cardinal on the night.
"It got to a point in the second half
where we got worn down, and they got
away from us," Montgomery said. "I'd just
like to get ahead of somebody in the second
half to give our guys some confidence."
