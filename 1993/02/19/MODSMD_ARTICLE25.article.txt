# Stanford misses second half bell as frustration mounts
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
If you had left last night's game at
halftime, you might have assumed that
the Stanford men's basketball team had
awoken from its season-long slumber to
challenge one of the better teams in the
Pacific 10 Conference. If you stayed until
the end of the game, you saw them drift
gently back to sleep.
The Cardinal came into the contest
against the UCIA Bruins ready to play,
forcing eight Bruin turnovers, crashing
the offensive and defensive boards, and
shooting 71.4 percent from the free
throw line. Bart Lammersen had eight
points and five rebounds, Darren Ail
away added four more rebounds, and
Dion Cross poured in five points in his
first five minutes.
That was the first half.
In the second half, however, the
breaks started going the other way.

UCLA's Richard Petruska, who man
aged an unspectacular two points in the
first half, used his 6-foot-10, 260-pound
frame to dominate the Cardinal inside
in the second half. Petruska hit long
shots, Petruska hit short shots,
Petruska rebounded, and Petruska
swatted away three Stanford shots with
authority.
The Cardinal, on the other hand,
couldn't respond on offense. Shots that
seemed to find the hoop in the first half
were bouncing off the rim in the second.
"We just had a stretch there where the
ball didn't go down," Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "They got some
easy tip-ins there and all of a sudden
we're down two-four-six-eight-10 points.
That's your difference in the game."
Montgomery lamented the team's
cold shooting late in the game, noting
that much of the momentum the Cardi
nal developed early on died out in the
second half.

"Confidence is very much a factor,"
Montgomery said. "If the ball would just
go down for us, it would make a huge dif
ference."
Even Bart Lammersen's career-high
14 points and nine rebounds couldn't
save Stanford from its lackluster second
half performance. The Bruins used 24
second-half rebounds to tip in many sec
ond and third shot attempts and frus
trate Cardinal scoring opportunities.
"The first 11 minutes of the second
half is the way we like to play," UCLA
head coach Jim Harrick said. "With
impatience, turnovers and foul shots in
the first half we shot ourselves in the
foot."
Stanford's losing streak now stands
at 10 games, just one shy of the longest
losing streak in Cardinal men's basket
ball history, set by the 1932 and 1933
teams that went 0-11 over a two-year
span. The most losses ever recorded by a
Stanford team in a single season is 20.
