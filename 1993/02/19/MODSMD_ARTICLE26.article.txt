# Spikers to battle Matadors, Aztecs
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Last Monday, the Stanford
men's volleyball team moved
up to No. 2 in the Volleyball
Monthly NCAA Division I poll.
Tonight, the squad faces the
first stern test of its new rank
ing as it takes on No. 5 Cal
State-Northridge at 7 in Burn
ham Pavilion. The Cardinal
will then travel south to face
San Diego State Sunday night.
"Cal State-Northridge is a
men's volleyball powerhouse,"
said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "If we can beat
them, we may get a win that no
one else in our division will
get."
The Matadors (8-3, 3-2
Mountain Division of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) have exceptional bal
ance, led by three key senior
hitters — Coley Kyman, Axel
Hagarand Ken Lynch. Kyman,
a two-time All-American, leads
the team with 91 kills and a
.420 hitting percentage.
"He dominates the game
from the middle," Nieves
said. "He's as good as any
middle blocker we'll play
against, and he's an especially
good hitter."
Both Hagar and Lynch are
imposing physical presences
for Nort bridge. Hagar, a tower
ing 6-foot-8, is hitting .394
with 75 kills in the Matadors'
1 1 matches to this point.
Lynch, at 6-foot-5, plays oppo
site hitter and draws compar
isons to a current Cardinal
star.
"Lynch is a lot like Dave
(loss because he's so big and
strong, and hits the heck out of
the ball," Nieves said.
However, these Matador
stars may not be in top form for
tonight's match, according to
Northridge's head coach John
Price. Kyman is recovering
from knee surgery, while both
Hagar and Lynch have bad
backs.
"We're really hurt by
injuries right now," Price said.
"We're a lot more beatable now
than (we will be) later in the

year."
But the Matadors do have
motivation. Last week,
Northridge was upset by No. 9
Brigham Young, and Price
believes that a win over Stan
ford will make up for the loss to
BYU. To win, though, his team
must serve well.
"We have to serve tough to
get their passers out of
rhythm, in order to set up our
blocking defense," Price said.
The Cardinal (4-1, 3-0 Pacif
ic Division of the MPSF), is
fresh off of wins over top-10
opponents USC and Long
Beach State. Stanford is head
ed by All-American opposite
hitter Dave Goss, who leads the
team with 110 kills and is sec
ond on the team in hitting per
centage, with a .465 mark. For
his exploits against the Trojans
and the 49ers, Goss was named
MPSF-Molten Player of the
Week.
Swing hitters Ryan Moos
and Bob Hillman are also con
tributing significantly for
Stanford. Moos paces the
squad with a .480 hitting per
centage, while Hillman is sec
ond on the team with 69 kills.
Setter Canyon Ceman is
among team leaders with four
aces.
The middle blocker situa
tion is finally beginning to take
shape for the Cardinal as well.
With senior Joe Burghardt
seeing limited action because
of two herniated discs in his
back, classmates John Hribar
and John Bezmalinovic
stepped forward to make sig
nificant contributions last
weekend. Against the Trojans,
Hribar led the team with 10
blocks, while Bezmalinovic
contributed eight blocks
against the 49ers.
The Aztecs (6-4, 3-1 Pacific
Division), who are coming off
an upset victory at Hawaii a
week ago, are in third place in
the Pacific Division behind
Stanford and the Rainbows.
San Diego State is led by star
outside hitter John Hyden. The
Cardinal defeated the Aztecs
twice last year, both times in
straight games.
