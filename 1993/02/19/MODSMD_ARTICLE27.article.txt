# Women's hoops weathers storm, 71-54
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - On a cold
and rainy Southern California
night, the entire Stanford
women's basketball team heated
up UCLA's Pauley Pavilion,
burning the Bruins, 71-54.
The Cardinal (18-5, 9-3 Pacific
10 Conference) received contribu
tions from every one of its nine
players, handing UCLA (10-11, 5-
7) its third consecutive loss. Five
Stanford players scored in double
figures, preventing the Bruin
defense from focusing on just one
or two shooters.
"I feel really confident playing
nine people," Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "Our
depth was a real key."
It also didn't hurt that the
rapidly-declining UCLA squad
had an off night. The Bruins
converted only 35 percent of its
field goal attempts, and during
one offensive series, missed
three straight shots near the
basket before Stanford finally
pulled down the rebound. On
defense, the Bruins fared no bet
ter as the Cardinal players made
quick cuts to the hoop, attacking
them time and time again for
easy layups.
"They won't look at it as one of
their best efforts," VanDerveer
said. "They're a much better
team than their record indicates.
Their shots just weren't falling
for them."
Unlike the Cardinal's previous
game against UCLA, which
remained close until the last few
minutes, Stanford jumped on its
opponent early, thanks in part to
forward Chris MacMurdo. The
sharp-shooting senior converted
on her first five field goal
attempts en route to a 12-point
performance.
"It seemed like we were get
ting out and running a little bit,"
VanDerveer said about the open
ing moments of the contest. "A
lot had to do with Chris . . . com
ing out and going five-for-five."
Several other Cardinal play
ers added fuel to the Stanford
attack in the first half. Anita
Kaplan hit a basket to make the
score 20-13 with 10:30 remain
ing, followed by a Bobbie Kelsey
three-pointer, which extended
the Cardinal advantage to 10
points.
Stanford's potent offense
didn't slow down in the second
half, either. While Rachel Hem

mer scored many of her 15 points
with explosive inside moves,
Christy Hedgpeth, Molly Gooden
bour and Kelsey bombed three
pointers from the outside. All of
the Cardinal shooters continued
to bury their shots, keeping the
Bruins from cutting the deficit to
any fewer than seven points.
Stanford's defense looked
pretty hot as well. Led by Ail-
American Val Whiting, the Cardi
nal held UCLA star Natalie
Williams to 16 points, six fewer
than her average.
"Val did a good job on Natal
ie," VanDerveer said. "She's real
ly tough to guard."
After such a convincing win,
Stanford seems to be getting in
high gear for the playoffs. But
VanDerveer said there is still
plenty to work left before the
postseason.
"We still have a ways to go,"
she said. "Two of our top scorers
didn't have a real good night (on
offense), and we got hurt from
the (free-throw) line."
The Cardinal hopes to extend
its winning streak tomorrow
afternoon against Connecticut.
"They will be really fired up,"
VanDerveer said. "I hope that our
team can come out strong. We
hope to build some momentum
going in to the playoffs."

for them."
Unlike the Cardinal's previous
game against UCLA, which
remained close until the last few
minutes, Stanford jumped on its
opponent early, thanks in part to
forward Chris MacMurdo. The
sharp-shooting senior converted
on her first five field goal
attempts en route to a 12-point
performance.
"It seemed like we were get
ting out and running a little bit,"
VanDerveer said about the open
ing moments of the contest. "A
lot had to do with Chris . . . com
ing out and going five-for-five."
Several other Cardinal play
ers added fuel to the Stanford
attack in the first half. Anita
Kaplan hit a basket to make the
score 20-13 with 10:30 remain
ing, followed by a Bobbie Kelsey
three-pointer, which extended
the Cardinal advantage to 10
points.
Stanford's potent offense
didn't slow down in the second
half, either. While Rachel Hem

mer scored many of her 15 points
with explosive inside moves,
Christy Hedgpeth, Molly Gooden
bour and Kelsey bombed three
pointers from the outside. All of
the Cardinal shooters continued
to bury their shots, keeping the
Bruins from cutting the deficit to
any fewer than seven points.
Stanford's defense looked
pretty hot as well. Led by Ail-
American Val Whiting, the Cardi
nal held UCLA star Natalie
Williams to 16 points, six fewer
than her average.
"Val did a good job on Natal
ie," VanDerveer said. "She's real
ly tough to guard."
After such a convincing win,
Stanford seems to be getting in
high gear for the playoffs. But
VanDerveer said there is still
plenty to work left before the
postseason.
"We still have a ways to go,"
she said. "Two of our top scorers
didn't have a real good night (on
offense), and we got hurt from
the (free-throw) line."
The Cardinal hopes to extend
its winning streak tomorrow
afternoon against Connecticut.
"They will be really fired up,"
VanDerveer said. "I hope that our
team can come out strong. We
hope to build some momentum
going in to the playoffs."

in rain-soaked Southern California to gain a share of first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
LOS ANGELES - On a cold
and rainy Southern California
night, the entire Stanford
women's basketball team heated
up UCLA's Pauley Pavilion,
burning the Bruins, 71-54.
The Cardinal (18-5, 9-3 Pacific
10 Conference) received contribu
tions from every one of its nine
players, handing UCLA (10-11, 5-
7) its third consecutive loss. Five
Stanford players scored in double
figures, preventing the Bruin
defense from focusing on just one
or two shooters.
"I feel really confident playing
nine people," Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "Our
depth was a real key."
It also didn't hurt that the
rapidly-declining UCLA squad
had an off night. The Bruins
converted only 35 percent of its
field goal attempts, and during
one offensive series, missed
three straight shots near the
basket before Stanford finally
pulled down the rebound. On
defense, the Bruins fared no bet
ter as the Cardinal players made
quick cuts to the hoop, attacking
them time and time again for
easy layups.
"They won't look at it as one of
their best efforts," VanDerveer
said. "They're a much better
team than their record indicates.
Their shots just weren't falling
for them."
Unlike the Cardinal's previous

remained close until the last few
