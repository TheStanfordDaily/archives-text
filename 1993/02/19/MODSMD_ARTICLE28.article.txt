# Cardinal infield steady as LaRocca
## Strong-armed sophomore star makes decision to bypass pros pay 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
What's in an arm? For Cardinal shortstop
Todd Laßocca, a very bright future.
"Todd's got the strongest arm on the
team," said coach Mark Marquess, "and one of
the best we've ever had at Stanford."
In less than a year of varsity experience,
Laßocca, a right-hander who doubles as a
relief pitcher, has blossomed into one of the
most complete players on the Cardinal roster.
A third-round pick of the Los Angeles
Dodgers in 1991, Laßocca and his fastball
were clocked in the 85 miles-per-hour range in
high school. Yet despite a lucrative Dodger
signing offer, the sophomore opted to attend
Stanford.
"I was pretty close to going (to the
Dodgers)," Laßocca said. "But I figured if I
was good enough to get drafted then, I'll be
good enough to get drafted later."
With the end of his collegiate career still in
the distance, Laßocca is quickly living up to
his own words. Despite starting only nine
games as a freshman, Laßocca was rated the
eighth-best shortstop in the nation by Base
ball America coming into this season.
Although the 6-foot, 185-pound Laßocca is
an able and, at times, acrobatic, shortstop, it
is his ability to make the transition from the
infield to the pitching mound that makes him
one of Stanford's most valuable assets.
"I always hope to be able to come in and
pitch in big situations and get a couple of
clutch outs," Laßocca said.
Despite the vital role he now performs for
the Cardinal, Laßocca spent the better part of
last season as a utility player.
"I've always been one to set high expecta
tions for myself," Laßocca said. "I came in
here, and I wanted and expected playing time.
It hurt my development."
"It was a matter of adjustment," Marquess
said. "Todd needed to reconstruct his swing,

and he worked very long and hard at it with
(Cardinal assistant coach) David Esquer."
According to Laßocca, it was a talk with
former Cardinal star Jeffrey Hammonds that
turned his freshman season around.
"He said to me, 'You just got to believe that
you're good enough,' " Laßocca said. "I
hadn't been doing that."
However, Laßocca proved himself in his
first starting assignment, the opening game of
a crucial late-season road series with Califor
nia. Starting at shortstop, he picked up a crit
ical home run in a 9-4 Cardinal win.
Laßocca started nine of the final 11 games
of the season at short, hitting .410 in 39 at
bats, and compiling a 2.35 ERA in eight brief
stints on the mound.
•This year, tendinitis in Laßocca's throwing
arm has prevented him from pitching at all.
The injury has also caused some defensive
problems for the sophomore, as his eight
errors attest.
"When my arm was hurting, I was trying to
baby the ball over to first," he said. "I changed
my throwing style."
While his shoulder problems appear to be
over, Laßocca is facing a different type of
adjustment at the plate. A former No. 8 hitter,
he was moved to the No. 2 slot in the lineup

last weekend against Fresno State.
"I'm seeing a lot more curves and sliders at
No. 2," Laßocca said. "I need more patience
and balance. I've got some juice in my bat, but
I'm not a home-run hitter."
While his offensive numbers aren't spectac
ular — a .250 average through 10 games —
Laßocca's role as a team leader in the middle
of the field is crucial. With freshmen Cale
Carter and A.J. Hinch seeing substantial time
at center field and catcher, Laßocca is, along
with sophomore second baseman Jed Hansen,
the voice of experience up the middle.
"I'm probably one of the most vocal players
on the team," Laßocca said. "I'm kind of a
leader by nature."
"Todd's one of the most explosive athletes on
the team," said left fielder Nate Olmstead. "He's
got the same kind of explosive personality."
Despite his leadership role in the middle
infield, Laßocca expects to log a significant
number of innings at pitcher. Indeed, with his
arm nearly back to full strength, the sopho
more could be pitching as soon as next week
end at Arizona.
For Marquess, this is a welcome develop
ment. "Hopefully, we'll have him back out
there," the coach said. "Todd's arm is one of
the greatest tools of this team."

However, Laßocca proved himself in his
first starting assignment, the opening game of
a crucial late-season road series with Califor
nia. Starting at shortstop, he picked up a crit
ical home run in a 9-4 Cardinal win.
Laßocca started nine of the final 11 games
of the season at short, hitting .410 in 39 at
bats, and compiling a 2.35 ERA in eight brief
stints on the mound.
•This year, tendinitis in Laßocca's throwing
arm has prevented him from pitching at all.
The injury has also caused some defensive
problems for the sophomore, as his eight
errors attest.
"When my arm was hurting, I was trying to
baby the ball over to first," he said. "I changed
my throwing style."
While his shoulder problems appear to be
over, Laßocca is facing a different type of
adjustment at the plate. A former No. 8 hitter,
he was moved to the No. 2 slot in the lineup

last weekend against Fresno State.
"I'm seeing a lot more curves and sliders at
No. 2," Laßocca said. "I need more patience
and balance. I've got some juice in my bat, but
I'm not a home-run hitter."
While his offensive numbers aren't spectac
ular — a .250 average through 10 games —
Laßocca's role as a team leader in the middle
of the field is crucial. With freshmen Cale
Carter and A.J. Hinch seeing substantial time
at center field and catcher, Laßocca is, along
with sophomore second baseman Jed Hansen,
the voice of experience up the middle.
"I'm probably one of the most vocal players
on the team," Laßocca said. "I'm kind of a
leader by nature."
"Todd's one of the most explosive athletes on
the team," said left fielder Nate Olmstead. "He's
got the same kind of explosive personality."
Despite his leadership role in the middle
infield, Laßocca expects to log a significant
number of innings at pitcher. Indeed, with his
arm nearly back to full strength, the sopho
more could be pitching as soon as next week
end at Arizona.
For Marquess, this is a welcome develop
ment. "Hopefully, we'll have him back out
there," the coach said. "Todd's arm is one of
the greatest tools of this team."

Todd Laßocca adds some spark to the Cardinal lineup and, as a
sophomore shortstop and occasional relief pitcher, is a 'voice of
experience' for Stanford's young infield.
