# Avoiding a shortage
## University conducting parking study 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Faced with a greater demand
for parking spaces than the Uni
versity can afford, campus plan
ners began a wide-ranging study
this week to examine the parking
and transportation needs of stu
dents, faculty and staff.
With limited financial and land
resources, along with long-term
plans to construct new University
buildings, there will be a "severe
parking shortage" in the next 10
years, said Julia Fremon, manag
er of Parking and Transportation
Programs.
"And the parking we have
planned to compensate [for the
new buildingsj, we can't afford,"
she added.
"It costs $10,000 to $15,000 to
build a single parking space," with
parking structures usually holding
about 750 to 1,000 spaces, said
Judy Chan, associate director of
the Planning Office.
"To accommodate the parking
demand on campus, we would need
to build two to three more parking
structures," she said.
Planning and transportation
officials hope the study, which
consists of seven focus groups and
a wide-ranging survey, will help

them to develop innovative solu
tions to alleviate the shortage.
The study will ask commuters,
on-campus residents and individ
uals who ride buses and bicycles to
Stanford about their parking and
transportation needs.
The focus groups — each con
sisting of a different segment of
campus, including faculty, students
and people who use alternative
methods of transportation — will
meet through next week.
In addition, a survey on park
ing and transportation needs will
be distributed to about 1,200 ran
dom drivers in mid-March.
A second round of focus groups
will also be held before the study is
completed in mid-April, said Chan.
Study organizers hope to pre
sent their findings and recommen
dations to the Board of Trustees in
June. Chan said new "pilot pro
grams" resulting from the study
may be implemented as early as fall.
The effort to cut down on the use
of cars on campus also stems from
aesthetic concerns and state air
quality regulations requiring busi
nesses such as Stanford to "do their
part to reduce traffic," she said.
"We recognize that parking on
campus is essential for some," said
Chan. But the study will examine
"what slice of the population
would be willing to leave their

cars at home, and what support
mechanisms need to be in place to
achieve that."
Chan suggested "providing
motorpools, a reasonable taxi ser
vice, more shower facilities in
buildings (for bikers who don't like
to get sweaty) ... or moving some

parking spaces from the center of
campus" as possible changes.
"These are the creative solutions
we're looking for," she said.
But the solutions to the short
age depends ultimately on what
preferences and trends the study
reveals, Chan said.
