# Rare back-to-back for women gymnasts in Washington
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
Baseball players are used to perform
ing day after day. But for the Stanford's
women's gymnastics team, two meets in
the same weekend is a new experience
indeed.
The No. 21 Cardinal (4-2) heads up to
Seattle to battle the 13th-ranked Wash
ington Huskies (5-5) tonight and the Fal
cons of Seattle Pacific tomorrow night.
Although Stanford has never before
competed in consecutive meets, head
coach Breck Greenwood thinks his team
will be ready for the challenge.
"I'm kind of excited about doing back

to-back nights," he said, adding, "I don't
think it's a big deal — practice is a lot
more physically demanding."
While assistant coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi
feels the team will need to be more men
tally prepared to face the pressure of two
straight meets, sophomore Jene Elzie
doesn't think this will be a problem for
the athletes.
"We'll be pretty much on a high after
the first meet, so that should carry us
through the second," said Elzie, who
strained an Achilles tendon last week and
will compete only on the uneven bars and
possibly the balance beam.
The meets in Seattle will be a dry run
in preparation for the new national

championship format. This year, there
will be two elimination rounds to deter
mine the NCAA champion, as opposed to
only one in years past. Many schools,
including Stanford, that hope to reach
the "super six" — which compete on the
second day — have scheduled back-to
back regular-season meets to approxi
mate conditions at nationals.
This weekend is also one of the last in
which Stanford will be adding difficulty
to its routines. Sophomore Meegan Lan
nin will premiere a new vault this week
end, and many of the gymnasts are still
adding new tumbling passes on floor.
According to Mitzel-Izzi, the team
usually stops adding difficulty about six

weeks before the end of the season.
"If they're not throwing it in a meet
before the [Pacific 10 Championships],
then they won't," she said.
Junior co-captain Mollie Brown feels
the extra difficulty the Cardinal is adding
now can give the team the scores it needs
to reach the elite level.
"We're just looking for that last
bump," she said.
They will need an extra boost to get
through this weekend. Washington coach
Bob Levesque, on the strength of six
freshmen, has built his team into one of
the best in the nation, with a high score
of 192.25. Christine Niebling is the
Huskies' top gymnast, with a top all

around score of 38.90, while Stacy Con
nolly scored a 10.00 on bars earlier this
year. In comparison, Stanford's highest
score this year is 189.925.
The Falcons should also pose a chal
lenge to the Cardinal. According to
Greenwood, last year's Division II
national champions are "no slam dunk."
Senior Kathie Cradduck leads the Fal
cons, who have a top team score of 186.20
this year.
Greenwood feels that the Cardinal
will probably get better marks against
the Huskies, as scoring is traditionally
higher in Washington and judges tend to
score higher when they see two good
teams perform.
