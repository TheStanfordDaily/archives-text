# Hamada shuffles lineup in hopes of men's gym win
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Normally, a coach would feel a bit ner
vous about fielding a new lineup in a meet
against two top teams. But Stanford men's
gymnastics coach Sadao Hamada antici
pates higher scores than usual tomorrow
night, when his 15th-ranked Cardinal
hosts No. 4 BYU, No. 14 Michigan State
and San Jose State at 7:30 in Burnham
Pavilion.
Hamada's confidence stems from a shuf
fled configuration, in which three of the
team's top gymnasts — senior Jair Lynch,
junior Mark Booth and sophomore Jing-
Wei Liang — will compete in the all
around.
"With these three competing in all the
events, we should be very strong," Hamada
said. "If they hit everything, we should be
even quite a bit above our goal score." His
team's target is 283 to 285, significantly
higher than last weekend's score of 279.20.
The Cardinal will need a better perfor
mance if it expects to defeat the Cougars,
who posted the highest team score in the
nation earlier this season with 280.30
points against Arizona State.
"I think BYU is going to be really well
prepared and willing to do anything possi
ble to beat us," Hamada said.

Darren Elg, BYU's top gymnast, will
lead the Cougars. He recently notched the
nation's highest all-around score this sea
son, and also holds five apparatus records.
Hamada plans to combat the Cougars'
power with a lineup similar to the one he
expects will compete in postseason action.
The Cardinal's recent three-week hiatus pro
vided much needed recovery time from early
season injuries. The break also gave the gym
nasts a chance to develop more challenging
skills and place them in their routines.
In addition to the Cardinal's three all
around competitors, senior Jeff Bender
and junior Jason Cohen are expected to
boost the team score by competing in five
events each. Senior Shawn Adamek and
freshman Peter Hegi will round out the
lineup for Stanford.
"This meet will be exciting because
we're throwing in our full squad for the
first time this year, with everyone together
who will be there for the NCAA Finals,"
Lynch said. "It will be good to start feeling
the chemistry again." He hopes that com
peting at home will supply the team with
the spark needed to motivate it through the
second half of its season.
"Come expecting some really impressive
routines," Hamada advised. "We can show
spectators what Olympic-level gymnastics
is like."
