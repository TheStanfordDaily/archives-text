# U.S. Soccer seeks revenge against Russian Nationals
## World Cup warmup at Stanford Stadium Sunday 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Head coach Bora Milutinovic and the
U.S. National Soccer Team will be out for
revenge Sunday when they take on Russia
at Stanford Stadium at 1:30 p.m. Aided by
an early goal by Oleg Sergueev and excel
lent defensive play, Russia defeated the
U.S. team, 1-0, Feb. 13 at the Orlando Cit
rus Bowl.
The U.S. team (1-1-2) features eight Cal
ifornia natives, including Bay Area resi
dents John Doyle and Dominic Kinnear,
both from Fremont, and UCLA's Joe-Max
Moore, from Irvine.
Milutinovic has been experimenting
with his lineup in the first four games of
the 1993 season. He noted that, "Unlike
other sports, in soccer we need to see every
available player at every position in order to
determine the best lineup."
The United States has had some note
worthy injuries to key players, necessitat
ing these lineup changes. Midfielder Bruce

Murray, the U.S. National team's leader in
goals and appearances, is listed as doubtful
for Sunday's match, while midfielder Brian
Quinn, who is nursing an ankle injury, is
listed as probable.
The U.S. team will practice Saturday
from 9 to 11 a.m. at Stanford Stadium.
The Russian team will practice today at
De Anza Community College in Cuperti
no and on Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
This is the second meeting between the
two teams since the breakup of the Soviet
Union. The U.S. was 0-5-1 against the
USSR before the breakup, and had a 1-1
record against the succeeding Common
wealth of Independent States team.
