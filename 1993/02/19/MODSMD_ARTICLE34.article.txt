# 'Valley of the Sun' could test netters as ranked Sun Devils, Wildcats await
## 
### Mike McDonugh Senior staff writer 
After destroying six teams in a row at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, including the No. 9 and No. 15 teams in the
nation, the second-ranked Stanford women's tennis team
now will have to prove that it can take its show on the road.
The Cardinal (7-0, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) treks to
Tempe, Ariz., today to face No. 8 Arizona State, and will
travel to Tucson tomorrow to play No. 12 Arizona.
For the first time since the start of the dual-match sea
son, Stanford will have all six starters playing in the sin
gles rotation. No. 1 Laxmi Poruri took a rest from Tues
day's Nevada-Las Vegas match to nurse a bad elbow, but is
expected to return to action against the Arizona schools.
No. 2 Heather Willens and No. 3 Kim Shasby are also
healthy and will play this weekend.
Kristine Kurth, Stanford's No. 4 player, will likely
return to singles play this weekend after a lung infection
sidelined her in some of last week's matches. Freshman
Beth Berris and sophomore Amy Chiminello will round
out the Cardinal singles starters.
Coach Frank Brennan expects some tough competition
in the Valley of the Sun this weekend. "This is a trip that's
always a little rough for us," Brennan said. "I guess it's

better that we play ASU first and prepare more for Ari
zona."
The Sun Devils, however, will give the Cardinal all it
can handle today, led by Meredith Geiger and No. 1 Kori
Davidson.
"ASU has a very uniform lineup," Brennan said.
"Between No. 1 and No. 6, there's not too much difference
in ability."
Arizona brings one of the nation's top players, Alix
Creek, into the match on Saturday, and is sure to give
Stanford a tough match at the No. 1 spot.
"Arizona always seems to have one player that stands
out, and this year they've got a very good player in Alix
Creek," Brennan said. "It should be a good test for
Laxmi."
Stanford has not only won its last seven-straight dual
matches, but also has posted a perfect 63-0 individual match
score in those matches. Incredibly, the Cardinal has also tal
lied a whopping 126-2 record in sets this year, many of
which were won by non-starters due to frequent lineup
changes.
Next week, Stanford will travel to Madison, Wis., to
compete in the National Team Indoor Championships,
Feb. 25-28. The Cardinal's next home match will be March
4 against the University of the Pacific.
