## Fondling fortune on El Camino 
### 
Having suffered the questions that all
seniors eventually face from parents
who have already turned our bed
rooms into dens, we looked outside of our
selves, the CPPC and anything else of this
world to reveal our futures: we went seeking
the wisdom of the fortune tellers of El
Camino Real.
In the phone book, right under the Psoria
sis Treatment Center, we found the addresses
of what we were looking for: psychics. There
were three real live mystics to choose from, or
so we thought.
Maria, Katherine, Leona— ah, the names
carried such mystique.
It was a rainy afternoon when we set out.
The clouds loomed ominously overhead and
black cats darted across our paths as we made
our way down El Camino toward eternal wis
dom— or failing that, a bottomless cup of cof
fee at Denny's.
First stop, Madame Maria's.
The sign read: "Past, Present, Future —
Love, Marriage, Business." Strikingly, it did
not mention death, which is where Maria
seemed to be. The peeling sign, the broken
down lawn statuettes and the plastic slip
covered furniture seen through the gauze
curtained window all implied a certain con
nection to the netherworld.
The place was abandoned.
And sadly, though we did want "advice on
all matters," we departed Maria's dilapidated
domain. Plainly we were playing with fate.

And fate meant to win.
Fortune teller No. 2 was a large elderly
woman named Leona— her sign just said
"Spiritual Advisor" in simple, earthly mun
danity. While she claimed to be "gifted" she
was hardly a good host. As we stood dripping
in the rain, she was obviously divining that
our destinies were not worth her time.
We, however, take our destinies very serious
ly, so we took them next door to Madame Kather
ine who graciously welcomed us and offered us
seats on her brocade plastic-covered sofa.
The resemblance between her pad and
Maria's— plush red carpeting, Roccoco reclin
ers and Louis XVI-gone-wild-faux-crystal
chandeliers — was the most uncanny thing
we'd seen that day, so we got right down to
business and asked what had become of
Madame Maria.
Katherine answered that she was "no
longer," and we wanted to ask Madame

Katherine to get in touch with Maria, but we
never got the chance.
Katherine was a chatty woman of many
medium: cards, palms, crystal balls— she did
them all, or at least she said she did. She also
said that she had been in the business for 40
years and had been born with "a psychic
gift."
At $25 per reading, obtaining "the gift"
was beginning to sound like a viable career
path. And we wanted one A.S.A.P.
We asked some questions about the field.
She knew of no men in the profession; so we
made the first cut. You do not have to finish a
degree for it— and we may yet make that cut.
But in describing "the gift" she added, "You
know it when you're young."
Alas, we seniors felt old, giftless and stuck
to her couch. Lady Luck is not a member of
our collective.
We filed out, our auras limp.
So, in a final effort, we tried one more: a
concrete yet spiritual-looking place. But the
lights were out and the neon "open" sign was
unlit. In furious hopes of obtaining a cosmic
message we tapped on the window. It began to
rain again.
We went home.
All in all it was a grim afternoon. Our final
assessment: one psychic closed, one rude and
one dead. Prospects were bleak. So now it's
back to the CPPC (although "psychic reading"
and "management consulting" do have a simi
lar grasp on reality).
