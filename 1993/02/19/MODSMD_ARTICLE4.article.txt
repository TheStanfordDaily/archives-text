# Balloons, lemonade and condoms
## Gay celebration challenges stereotypical gender roles 
### Colleen Kreuger Staff writer 
You've heard of Ruby Tuesday, Blue
Monday and even "Sunday Bloody Sunday"
â€” but how about Pink Friday?
Described by organizer Natasha Iskandr
as "a day to be out and be proud," Pink Fri
day, sponsored by the Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center, features both
the Queer Carnival today in White Plaza
and tonight's Gender Chaos Ball at Elliot
Program Center.
The Queer Carnival, held from 11 a.m. to
2 p.m. today, is a celebratory event featuring
student and community gay support groups.
Event coordinator Barney Cheng
promises a festive atmosphere with "hun
dreds of pink balloons, pink lemonade (and)
hundreds of condoms," along with many in
formal presentations, including one by the
Human Rights Campaign Fund.
Cheng said he was concerned about the
possibility of rain, but should the carnival
be rained out, all the information will be
available at the Gender Chaos Ball.

Organizers hope the ball, which features
"safe sex door prizes" and a "queer fashion
show," will do more than just attract atten
tion: proceeds will be directed towards the
March on Washington on April 26. They
hope the ball will attract 400 people and
raise $1,000 for the march.
Rosa de la Vega, coordinator of Beyond
Het(erosexual), a campus lesbian group,
said that she hoped to provide "need-based
subsidies" to the 30-40 students interested
in attending the march.
"Many cannot go without the communi
ty's financial support," said de la Vega.
Tonight's Gender Chaos Ball was born
out of the "basic idea that gender is a social
construct," said Iskandr.
Although the dance has been billed as
drag ball, organizers hope it will challenge
traditional ideas about gender in dress.
While the LGBCC sponsors a dance each
quarter, the ball will focus specifically on "ex
ploring the outer symbols we use to identify
ourselves according to gender," said Iskandr.
Iskandr said that the Gender
Chaos Ball was "to some extent"
designed to "challenge the hetero
sexist slant" of last weekend's
Viennese Ball.
Pink Friday organizers were
careful, however, to schedule the
Gender Chaos Ball a week later so
that homosexual couples were
free to attend both.
Cheng stressed that, unlike
last year's event, Pink Friday is

"pro-active, not reactionary."
Last year's Queer Carnival
event was largely a protest to
speaker Darlene Bogle, a one
time lesbian who claimed she
became heterosexual with the
help of Jesus. The controversial
speaker, who espoused the idea
that homosexuality is a choice,
touched off a campus debate
between the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community and campus
religious groups.
This year's Queer Carnival is a
time to celebrate "instead of hav
ing someone to be angry at," said
Cheng.
