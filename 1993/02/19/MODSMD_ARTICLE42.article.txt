# Stanford Students for Life work for education about alternatives
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Although their group is only
a year old, members of Stan
ford Students for Life say they
are working on "positive"
forms of education about alter
natives to abortion, rather
than "negative" statements,
such as clinic demonstrations.
Sophomore Joyce Lee, a
group member, pointed out
that not all people who are
"pro-life" advocate demon
strating in front of abortion
clinics and "making women
(clients) feel harassed."
"Education is the most
important thing," Lee said. "A
lot of women who have had
abortions say they would have
made a different decision if they
were aware of all the options
available. That's terrible."
Although the group has not
taken a unified stance on clinic
demonstrations, president Maria
Alaniz, also a sophomore, said the

group will probably forego such
activities and instead raise funds
for crisis pregnancy centers.
The group is also interested
in bringing more speakers to
campus and setting up tables in
White Plaza — as they occa
sionally have done this quarter
— to increase education among
students, Alaniz said.
She said the group's prima
ry focus is to "get the other side
out" on campus rather than to
become involved in the political
and religious affiliations that
outside demonstrations often
involve.
Although different group
members may hold a variety of
political and religious views
concerning abortion, their
common tie is the desire to
educate women about options
to abortion, Alaniz said.
"Although some people (who
take a pro-life stance) choose a
more radical form of expres
sion, we are going to try to stay
away from that," she said.
