# Sophomore seminars to expand because of outside teaching gift
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The new Dialogue Tutorial and
restructured Peters Seminar pro
grams," which offer sophomores
small-group classes taught by pro
fessors, are expected to expand in
coming years despite University
wide budget reductions.
Because they are funded by an
outside source, the seminars and
tutorials will continue for at least
the next 10 years, according to
Sue Reinhold, the program's
coordinator.
Both programs got off to an
extremely successful start this
quarter, according to A 1 Camaril
lo, associate dean of Humanities
and Sciences. Most of the Peters
Seminars and Dialogue Tutorials
are filled to capacity, he said.
The seminars and tutorials are
offered through the Office of
Undergraduate Studies. Semi
nars include eight to 10 students
and are more structured than the
tutorials, which involve between
two and four sophomores.
The seminars are an out
growth of a program already in
existence. "We refocused the sem
inars which used to be for both
freshmen and sophomores," said
Camarillo.
Money for the Dialogue Tutori
als comes from the Peter and
Helen Bing teaching gift of $15
million over 10 years, according
to Camarillo. The Peters Semi
nars receive their funding from
an anonymous donor.
The teaching gift will also fund
"a variety of other programs and
awards" during the next decade,
he added. The money was donat
ed to support teaching in general.

During the upcoming quarters,
coordinators will try to expand
the range of topics included in the
seminars and tutorials.
"We've tried very hard to get
the 'techies' involved," Reinhold
said. "Unfortunately, the faculty
in the departments of engineering
and sciences are not responding
as well as we had hoped."
Despite this difficulty, semi
nars and tutorials in 19 different
areas — ranging from biology to
international relations — are
scheduled for next quarter,
according to Reinhold. This quar
ter, a total of 14 seminars and
tutorials were offered. Topics this
quarter included an in-depth
study of Mayan mythology, a
course on the physics of measure
ment and a tutorial on the inter
actions between foot-binding,
menarche and work in China.
Both programs sparked a great
deal of interest since they were
introduced in October. "We are
very excited about the prospects"
for future courses, Reinhold said.
About 160 students enrolled in
the programs this quarter, and
next quarter the number will prob
ably jump to 180, Camarillo said.
"If the level of interest contin
ues, we could anticipate half of
every sophomore class being
involved in these classes."
Although "this is a very young
program," Reinhold said, "stu
dents have responded in large
numbers." Because space in the
programs is limited, the applica
tion process is competitive.
"Our major goal at this point is
to expand the program into more
diverse areas and get more of the
faculty and students involved,"
she said.
