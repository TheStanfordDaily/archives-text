# King of the grill – dining with Nick
## 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
If Stanford were in New Jer
sey, no one would apply here. But
senior Nick Weber would be king.
Weber's newest creation,
"Nick's Diner," is an amalgam of
Stanford needs and Jersey sensi
bilities. Every Friday, from 11
p.m. until 3 a.m., Weber and his
partners, Alex Thompson and
Doug Bruha, fry up burgers and
grill sandwiches at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house for delivery
around campus.
Inspired by diner experiences
in his home state, Weber said he
first experimented with the idea
of starting his own diner in high
school — a dream he said he may
want to pursue on a larger scale
after college.
"I used to make my friends in
New Jersey egg sandwiches when
we were all drunk. They loved
them," he said.

Student workers prepare food for Nick's Diner last Friday night at the Deke House
where senior Nick Webber sells culinary feats such as hamburgers and grill sand
wiches for delivery around campus.
quarter, the diner has built a
clientele which brings in about 40
orders per night — enough to
keep Weber and company out of
the red, but not enough to make
the venture worthwhile if busi
ness doesn't improve, he said.
In order to drum up business,
Weber has been delivering menus
door-to-door while also attempt
ing other, more innovative, mar
keting techniques.
One of these techniques
involved handing the Naked Guy
— a vocal opponent of free-mar
ket values — $30 in cash and a
handmade Nick's Diner hat to
wear during his speech at Bran
ner Hall earlier this month.
Most of the business has been
built through word of mouth,
Weber said — particularly
through visitors of the Deke
house, where he cooks dinner
three nights a week.
Weber said he started the diner

to give the campus the kind of
night life he remembered from his
days in Tenafly, N.J.
"We found a need for a late
night place where we could get food
on campus because there is noth
ing like that." He said they chose
Friday nights because "we thought
it would be the most festive night."
When the weather improves,
Weber said he hopes more people
will come to the diner itself, and
eat on the tree stumps outside the
house.
But for now, junior Larry Mon
telibano, the self-proclaimed
"delivery boy," is the most conve
nient way for students to get
Nick's $3.25 burgers.
"Basically I was too lazy to go
find a regular campus job and the
opportunity presented itself and I
said, 'Sure. Why not?' "
It usually takes Weber any
where from 20 to 40 minutes to
turn an order around. And
although there is no minimum
order for delivery, Weber said
that students have to at least
make the trip worth Mon
telibano's time.

While Montelibano said Stan
ford students generally tip well,
he said that drunk freshman tip
especially well. Sometimes, how
ever, students get a little too
friendly.
"I got a joint for a tip, once,"
Montelibano said. "Actually, it
was for Nick."
A significant portion Nick's
patrons are returning customers.
Freshman Hans Kramer said he
was impressed with the quality of
the diner's food.
"The shakes are good. I had
some of someone's once," he said,
adding that he would not hesitate
to order from the diner if he was
hungry on a Friday night.
Although Weber has been
drawing an increasing portion of
the Friday late-night crowd,
Brian St. James, a manager at
Denny's restaurant in Palo Alto,
said he "hasn't noticed any
change" in business since Nick's
Diner went into operation.
However, St. James said
Denny's might look into increas
ing its local advertising if Weber's
business increased substantially.
