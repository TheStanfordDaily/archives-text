# King of the grill – dining with Nick
## 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
If Stanford were in New Jer
sey, no one would apply here. But
senior Nick Weber would be king.
Weber's newest creation,
"Nick's Diner," is an amalgam of
Stanford needs and Jersey sensi
bilities. Every Friday, from 11
p.m. until 3 a.m., Weber and his
partners, Alex Thompson and
Doug Bruha, fry up burgers and
grill sandwiches at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house for delivery
around campus.
Inspired by diner experiences
in his home state, Weber said he
first experimented with the idea
of starting his own diner in high
school — a dream he said he may
want to pursue on a larger scale
after college.
"I used to make my friends in
New Jersey egg sandwiches when
we were all drunk. They loved
them," he said.
Since opening at the end of last

Student workers prepare food for Nick's Diner last Friday night at the Deke House
where senior Nick Webber sells culinary feats such as hamburgers and grill sand
wiches for delivery around campus.
