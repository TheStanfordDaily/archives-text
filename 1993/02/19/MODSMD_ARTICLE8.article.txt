# Daily forms Friends foundation
## 
### 
In celebration of its 20th
anniversary of corporate indepen
dence, The Daily has formed the
Friends of the Stanford Daily
Foundation, a supporting organi
zation to foster the educational
mission of the newspaper.
From year to year, the Friends
foundation will sponsor projects
such as journalism seminars and
internships, and foster professional
contacts for current Daily staffers.
On April 12, the Friends and
The Daily will co-sponsor a sym
posium on the future of print
media in an electronic age. Guest
speakers will include Henry
Muller, editorial director of Time-
Life Publications and Philip
Taubman, deputy national editor
of The New York Times (both of
whom are former Daily editors),
as well as a keynote speaker to be
announced later. The event will
commemorate The Daily's 20th
anniversary of corporate indepen
dence from the University.
The Friends foundation is an
independent, non-profit corpora
tion created to provide an endow
ment fund for The Daily. Contri
butions to the Friends will not be
used for The Daily's operating
expenses but will instead be
invested to ensure the long-range
financial security of the newspa
per. A portion of the foundation's
income will fund educational

opportunities for current staff
members and the Stanford com
munity at large.
The Friends is believed to be
the first independent supporting
foundation for a college newspa
per.
"It never hurts to go a level fur
ther than what everyone else is
doing," said Daily business manag
er and Friends board member Rick
Wolfgram, who describes the foun
dation as a "safety net" for the
newspaper, which has lost advertis
ing revenues during the recession.
Daily alumni have already con
tributed $5,000 in seed money to

the foundation. Periodic fund
raising drives among Daily alum
ni and Friends, along with invest
ment income, will be the principal
sources of continued income for
the foundation.
In addition, the 101 year-old
student newspaper — which since
1973 has been an independent,
non-profit corporation — will
make a $100,000 contribution to
the Friends over a period of three
years. The Daily has already con
tributed $75,000 to the founda
tion and will make a final contri
bution of $25,000 during the
1993-94 fiscal year.
