# Ice-T warns of 'revolution' against unjust system
## Controversial rapper takes on racism, violence, First Amendment in Kresge talk 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
For rapper Ice-T, the first day
of the Los Angeles riots was one of
the happiest moments of his life.
"What you saw on April 29 in
Los Angeles was the consequence
to the system's fuck up. I am so
proud that people got out there and
made some motherfucking noise."
Ice-T, who spoke at Kresge Au
ditorium Saturday night to about
500 students, brought up every
thing from racism and the Consti
tution to violence and his sex drive.
In the program, titled "A Conver
sation with Ice-T," he spoke can
didly and humorously, and as
sured the audience that there was
no topic too personal to discuss.
While Ice-T did not advocate an
uprising or encourage a rebellion
against the system when dis
cussing the riots, he said people
should arm themselves in prepa
ration for a possible revolution.
"Do not believe that America is so

intellectual that we are beyond revo
lution ... it can happen anywhere,"
he said. "There are going to be a lot of
dead motherfuckers in the streets."
He predicted that as long as
there are no penalties for injustice
within the judicial system, there
will be no peace.
"Mark my words ... all people
want is justice. . . . There was no
justice, so the people said it's time
to issue a consequence."
One of Ice-T's first points in his
talk was that he planned to use ex
pletives freely because, he said, he
has "yet to find anyone who can
define profanity."
He said people don't even know
why they disapprove of certain
words, and that taboo words can
draw attention to a sentence.
During the program, Ice-T con
tinued to let the expletives flow
freely, as he justified his contro
versial views and defended himself
against recent public criticism.
Junior Nicole Sanchez, who orga
nized the program, said she was

pleased to have had a speaker who ex
posed students to opinions they per
haps had never been heard before.
"I thought it was a great suc
cess," she said. "I knew that not
everyone would take the same po
sition. I knew he would spark de
bate and get people thinking and
questioning their own views."
Ice-T, who moved from New
Jersey to Los Angeles after his par
ents died, spent his four years of
high school as a "gangbanger."
When he got a girl pregnant in 12th
grade, he said, he realized he need
ed to learn about responsibility.
He then spent four years in the
army where he said he learned his
"true hatred for the system" be
cause he did not appreciate the dog
eat-dog mentality of the military.
After getting out of the army,
he worked as a pimp for two years.
All along he had been creating
rhymes for the gangs — such as
"Crips don't die, they multiply" —
that slowly evolved into rapping.
Five years later he signed a record
contract with Time Warner and
has since recorded one platinum
and three gold albums.
He and some of his friends then
formed the heavy-metal group
Body Count, on whose eponymous
album the track "Cop Killer" ap
peared. The controversy sur
rounding this song, which de
scribes violence against police,
brought the rapper into the spot
light: "I'm bout to dust some cops
off... . Die, die, die, pig, die!"
After being criticized by many
police groups last year, Ice-T agreed
to remove the song from the album
to avoid further problems for Time
Warner.
"I didn't think 'Cop Killer' was
controversial because I thought
