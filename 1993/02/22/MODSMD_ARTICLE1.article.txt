# Ice-T warns of 'revolution' against unjust system
## Controversial rapper takes on racism, violence, First Amendment in Kresge talk 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
For rapper Ice-T, the first day
of the Los Angeles riots was one of
the happiest moments of his life.
"What you saw on April 29 in
Los Angeles was the consequence
to the system's fuck up. I am so
proud that people got out there and
made some motherfucking noise."
Ice-T, who spoke at Kresge Au
ditorium Saturday night to about
500 students, brought up every
thing from racism and the Consti
tution to violence and his sex drive.
In the program, titled "A Conver
sation with Ice-T," he spoke can
didly and humorously, and as
sured the audience that there was
no topic too personal to discuss.
While Ice-T did not advocate an
uprising or encourage a rebellion
against the system when dis
cussing the riots, he said people
should arm themselves in prepa
ration for a possible revolution.
"Do not believe that America is so

intellectual that we are beyond revo
lution ... it can happen anywhere,"
he said. "There are going to be a lot of
dead motherfuckers in the streets."
He predicted that as long as
there are no penalties for injustice
within the judicial system, there
will be no peace.
"Mark my words ... all people
want is justice. . . . There was no
justice, so the people said it's time
to issue a consequence."
One of Ice-T's first points in his
talk was that he planned to use ex
pletives freely because, he said, he
has "yet to find anyone who can
define profanity."
He said people don't even know
why they disapprove of certain
words, and that taboo words can
draw attention to a sentence.
During the program, Ice-T con
tinued to let the expletives flow
freely, as he justified his contro
versial views and defended himself
against recent public criticism.
Junior Nicole Sanchez, who orga
nized the program, said she was

pleased to have had a speaker who ex
posed students to opinions they per
haps had never been heard before.
"I thought it was a great suc
cess," she said. "I knew that not
everyone would take the same po
sition. I knew he would spark de
bate and get people thinking and
questioning their own views."
Ice-T, who moved from New
Jersey to Los Angeles after his par
ents died, spent his four years of
high school as a "gangbanger."
When he got a girl pregnant in 12th
grade, he said, he realized he need
ed to learn about responsibility.
He then spent four years in the
army where he said he learned his
"true hatred for the system" be
cause he did not appreciate the dog
eat-dog mentality of the military.
After getting out of the army,
he worked as a pimp for two years.
All along he had been creating
rhymes for the gangs — such as
"Crips don't die, they multiply" —
that slowly evolved into rapping.
Five years later he signed a record
contract with Time Warner and
has since recorded one platinum
and three gold albums.
He and some of his friends then
formed the heavy-metal group
Body Count, on whose eponymous
album the track "Cop Killer" ap
peared. The controversy sur
rounding this song, which de
scribes violence against police,
brought the rapper into the spot
light: "I'm bout to dust some cops
off... . Die, die, die, pig, die!"
After being criticized by many
police groups last year, Ice-T agreed
to remove the song from the album
to avoid further problems for Time
Warner.
"I didn't think 'Cop Killer' was
controversial because I thought

everyone hated the police," he
said.
And despite the violent lyrics
in "Cop Killer," Ice-T denied that
he glamorizes violence in his
songs.
"Crime is glamorous — that's
why people do it,"he said. "I try
to show violence in its rawest
sense. .. . I've died in more of my
records than any other rapper . ..
I don't glamorize it. I just show it
in its true form."
However, he added he would
not hesitate to take physical
action against a police officer
whom he saw as a threat.
"The only person that's ever
fucked me over are those mother
fucking police in this fucking sys
tem," he said. "I say fuck the ones
who are out to get me."
He added that he does not feel
responsible for how his listeners
interpret his music.
Ice-T also defended himself
against accusations of both sex
ism and racism. He said he isn't
sexist — as some people have
labelled him — but sexual.
"Love makes the world go
around," he said.
However, he called men "dogs"
and said all men initially look at a
women in a sexual way. "Men are
pretty point-blank one-natured:
Men would prefer to fuck," he
said. "Sex in its most blatant and
raw form is animal."
Ice-T also dismissed charges
that he is racist and encouraged

students to disregard any racist
attitudes they may have acquired
from their parents.
"Nobody'B evil by birth," he
said. "Racism is programmed into
people .... It's going to be hard
for this to mend, but I know we
can mend. But this generation
has to start the mending."
Ice-T added that the dialogues
between Koreans and blacks in
Los Angeles since the riots have
been extremely beneficial.
He also said that education is
the most effective way of elimi
nating racism and keeping kids
from leading crime-ridden lives.
Interestingly, Ice-T blasted the
Constitution, saying that it and its
Bill of Rights are both "twisted"
and don't exist. He called the doc
ument "void" because he said it
cannot possibly have any value if
its framers believed blacks were
slaves.
"The Constitution is a figment
of all of your imaginations," he
said. "There are no rights."
Ice-T said he sings controver
sial lyrics not because of the First
Amendment, but because it is his
God-given right.
"Fuck the First Amendment,"
he said. "I do not need a law to tell
me what I can and cannot say ....
As soon as you have a law telling
you what you can say, the same
law will tell you what you cannot
say."
While not all students in atten
dance agreed with Ice-T's views,
many were nonetheless convinced
by his defense of these views and his
willingness to accept differing
views.
"For someone whose views are

so controversial, he's always very
accepting of other points of view,"
said freshman Sam Brasch.
Senior Tony Toranto said he
was glad he listened to the three
hour speech because the rapper
"had a lot of good things to say."
"I disagree with most of his
views on most subjects," he said.
"But I understand that my views
are largely a product of my experi
ences, and his experiences are vast
ly different from mine, and as a
result I couldn't expect him to have
the same opinion."
Toranto added that he feels it is
essential to one's education to
accept challenges to one's views.
"If I didn't take take advantage of
listening to opinions different
from my own, I would never know
if I was right or if something was
missing," he said.
Although Ice-T has had to cancel
at least one recent speech sched
uled at Idaho State University
because local police refused to pro
tect him, there were no problems
with security at either the program
or at a post-program question-and
answer session at Roble Hall. Police
officers were present at both
events, but most of the security was
provided by students.
On Friday, there had been some
controversy about whether outside
press would be allowed at the
speech. Originally, Sanchez said, no
members of the outside media
would be allowed because Ice-T
wanted to speak to as many stu
dents as possible. However, after a
misunderstanding with the San
Jose Mercury News, Sanchez decid
ed to allow some outside journalists
to attend.

Ice-T said he sings controver

"Fuck the First Amendment,"
he said. "I do not need a law to tell

As soon as you have a law telling

While not all students in atten

many were nonetheless convinced
by his defense of these views and his
willingness to accept differing

"For someone whose views are

so controversial, he's always very
accepting of other points of view,"
said freshman Sam Brasch.
Senior Tony Toranto said he
was glad he listened to the three
hour speech because the rapper
"had a lot of good things to say."
"I disagree with most of his
views on most subjects," he said.
"But I understand that my views
are largely a product of my experi

Toranto added that he feels it is
essential to one's education to
accept challenges to one's views.
"If I didn't take take advantage of
listening to opinions different
from my own, I would never know
if I was right or if something was
missing," he said.
Although Ice-T has had to cancel
at least one recent speech sched
uled at Idaho State University
because local police refused to pro
tect him, there were no problems
with security at either the program
or at a post-program question-and
answer session at Roble Hall. Police
officers were present at both
events, but most of the security was
provided by students.
On Friday, there had been some
controversy about whether outside
press would be allowed at the
speech. Originally, Sanchez said, no
members of the outside media
would be allowed because Ice-T
wanted to speak to as many stu
dents as possible. However, after a
misunderstanding with the San
Jose Mercury News, Sanchez decid
ed to allow some outside journalists
to attend.
For rapper Ice-T, the first day
of the Los Angeles riots was one of
the happiest moments of his life.
"What you saw on April 29 in
Los Angeles was the consequence
to the system's fuck up. I am so
proud that people got out there and
made some motherfucking noise."
Ice-T, who spoke at Kresge Au
ditorium Saturday night to about
500 students, brought up every
thing from racism and the Consti
tution to violence and his sex drive.
In the program, titled "A Conver
sation with Ice-T," he spoke can
didly and humorously, and as
sured the audience that there was
no topic too personal to discuss.
While Ice-T did not advocate an
uprising or encourage a rebellion
against the system when dis
cussing the riots, he said people
should arm themselves in prepa
ration for a possible revolution.
"Do not believe that America is so

intellectual that we are beyond revo
lution ... it can happen anywhere,"
he said. "There are going to be a lot of
dead motherfuckers in the streets."
He predicted that as long as
there are no penalties for injustice
within the judicial system, there
will be no peace.
"Mark my words ... all people
want is justice. . . . There was no
justice, so the people said it's time
to issue a consequence."
One of Ice-T's first points in his
talk was that he planned to use ex
pletives freely because, he said, he
has "yet to find anyone who can
define profanity."
He said people don't even know
why they disapprove of certain
words, and that taboo words can
draw attention to a sentence.
During the program, Ice-T con
tinued to let the expletives flow
freely, as he justified his contro
versial views and defended himself
against recent public criticism.
Junior Nicole Sanchez, who orga
nized the program, said she was

pleased to have had a speaker who ex
posed students to opinions they per
haps had never been heard before.
"I thought it was a great suc
cess," she said. "I knew that not
everyone would take the same po
sition. I knew he would spark de
bate and get people thinking and
questioning their own views."
Ice-T, who moved from New
Jersey to Los Angeles after his par
ents died, spent his four years of
high school as a "gangbanger."
When he got a girl pregnant in 12th
grade, he said, he realized he need
ed to learn about responsibility.
He then spent four years in the
army where he said he learned his
"true hatred for the system" be
cause he did not appreciate the dog
eat-dog mentality of the military.
After getting out of the army,
he worked as a pimp for two years.
All along he had been creating
rhymes for the gangs — such as
"Crips don't die, they multiply" —
that slowly evolved into rapping.
Five years later he signed a record
contract with Time Warner and
has since recorded one platinum
and three gold albums.
He and some of his friends then
formed the heavy-metal group
Body Count, on whose eponymous
album the track "Cop Killer" ap
peared. The controversy sur
rounding this song, which de
scribes violence against police,
brought the rapper into the spot
light: "I'm bout to dust some cops
off... . Die, die, die, pig, die!"
After being criticized by many
police groups last year, Ice-T agreed
to remove the song from the album
to avoid further problems for Time
Warner.

said.
And despite the violent lyrics
in "Cop Killer," Ice-T denied that
he glamorizes violence in his
songs.
"Crime is glamorous — that's
why people do it,"he said. "I try
to show violence in its rawest
sense. .. . I've died in more of my
records than any other rapper . ..
I don't glamorize it. I just show it
in its true form."
However, he added he would
not hesitate to take physical
action against a police officer
whom he saw as a threat.
"The only person that's ever
fucked me over are those mother
fucking police in this fucking sys
tem," he said. "I say fuck the ones
who are out to get me."
He added that he does not feel
responsible for how his listeners
interpret his music.
Ice-T also defended himself
against accusations of both sex
ism and racism. He said he isn't
sexist — as some people have
labelled him — but sexual.
"Love makes the world go
around," he said.
However, he called men "dogs"
and said all men initially look at a
women in a sexual way. "Men are
pretty point-blank one-natured:
Men would prefer to fuck," he
said. "Sex in its most blatant and
raw form is animal."
Ice-T also dismissed charges
that he is racist and encouraged

students to disregard any racist
attitudes they may have acquired
from their parents.
"Nobody'B evil by birth," he
said. "Racism is programmed into
people .... It's going to be hard
for this to mend, but I know we
can mend. But this generation
has to start the mending."
Ice-T added that the dialogues

Ice-T said he sings controver
