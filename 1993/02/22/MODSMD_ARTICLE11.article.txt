U.N. convoy aids Serbs
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — A U.N. convoy held up for days by
hostile Serbs and mined roads finally
delivered food to a besieged eastern town
yesterday, but there was still no aid dis
tribution in shattered Sarajevo.
A unilateral, nationwide cease-fire
called Saturday by Bosnia's Muslim pres
ident, Alija Izetbegovic, appeared to be
holding around the capital, but already
was fraying elsewhere.
As the commander of U.N. peacekeep
ers in Bosnia headed for consultations
with Bosnian Serb leaders to try to con
solidate the truce, at least 18 people were
reported killed in fighting in northern
and eastern Bosnia.

the accident occurred in a 4,400-foot tun
nel in the Chinatown area.

stopped midway into the tunnel, said
CTA spokesman Jeff Stern.
Thirty-five people were taken to area
hospitals, most with minor injuries.
Clinton spurs "jogmania"
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's high-visibility jogs have lured a
new wave of Americans to fight middle
age spread by revisiting running.
"Now you've got a guy who's seen run
ning by 100 million people a day, in the
papers, on TV, and that has an effect on
people," said Fred Lebow, chairman of
the 27,000-member New York Road Run
ners Club and director of the New York
City Marathon.
Membership inquiries in the club have
more than doubled since November, and
marathon participation is up around the
country, Lebow said.
