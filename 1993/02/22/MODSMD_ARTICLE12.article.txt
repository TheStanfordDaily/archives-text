# Clinton makes first West Coast visit
## Pledges $500M to fund defense industry transition 
### 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - Pres
ident Clinton yesterday stepped up his
attack on critics who say his economic
plan doesn't offer enough spending cuts,
challenging them to propose their own
reductions and "not talk about doing bet
ter."
On his first trip to the West Coast as
president, Clinton spoke at a local com
munity college, after which he flew to
San Jose for a private dinner with about
30 Silicon Valley business leaders,
including Stanford Board of Trustees
President John Freidenrich.
Today, he will tour a Silicon Graphics,
a computer company in Mountain View,
then fly to Seattle to visit a Boeing air
craft plant â€” just days after the airplane
giant announced it will eliminate 23,000
jobs this year.
In his speech, the president also told
residents of the economically strapped
West Coast, where defense-related indus
tries are particularly hurt, that help was
on the way. As a down payment, he said
he was releasing $500 million in funds to

help communities nationwide convert
from defense-based industries to civilian
ones.
Speaking to the college students, Clin
ton said the funds were from a $1.7 bil
lion congressional appropriation for
"defense conversion" that he said the for
mer Bush administration had failed to
spend.
He also said he would propose a new
technology polity that calls for closer gov
ernment-industry ties with a goal of find
ing new high-paying jobs for laid-off
defense workers.
Clinton took aim at critics who say his
economic revival plan is top-heavy with
new taxes and not enough spending cuts.
He said the plan contains plenty of cuts,
including in the size of government.
"It's one thing to talk like a conserva
tive and another thing altogether to live
like one," Clinton said.
"You can't just have the sweet parts of
this program; you've got to have the
tough parts too," he said as he continued
a cross-country sales pitch for the plan he

unveiled last Wednesday.
Clinton said his new technology propos
al includes more job retraining programs
for laid-off defense workers and a shifting
of government research and development
from defense purposes to civilian causes
like environmental protection.
"Unless California is revived, the
nation cannot recover economically," the
president said.
Speaking with students in the gymna
sium of Santa Monica College, Clinton
cited his steps in cutting the White
House staff by 25 percent, government
administrative costs by 14 percent over
four years and advocating a one-year
freeze in the salaries of government offi
cials.
"Every time I go someplace, they
say cut more and tax less," Clinton
said, referring to criticism from con
servative lawmakers and many
economists that his plan designed to
reduce the federal deficit by $325 bil
lion in four years is weighed too heavi
ly in favor of taxes.
