## Editorial Refocus the theme 
### 
Not all the Governor's
Corner theme houses
live up to their names

IT'S SLIGHTLY OVER THE
halfway mark in the trial year
for focus houses in Governor's
Corner, and reactions from resi
dents have ranged from enthusi
asm and satisfaction to, "Focus?
What focus?"
While the concept of focus hous
es can bring intellectual life to the
typically more sedate upper-class
dorms, experience has shown that
their success relies heavily on each
house's staff and residents.
With the existing discrepancies
in the way focuses have (or have
not) been promoted in the Sterling
Quad houses and Murray, the new
system seems arbitrary and lack
ing of a cohesive goal or structure.
The Office of Residential Educa
tion, resident fellows, resident
assistants, focus assistants and
residents who draw in on priority
need to take the collective respon
sibility to make sure each house
reflects its respective theme in a
constructive and relevant way.
Residents of some focus houses
have complained that their dorm
has so few focus-related activities
that they can hardly tell what the
focus is. Others say activities or
material which are passed off as
part of each house's focus are
only marginally relevant to this
purpose.
With two or three Focus Assis
tants per house whose jobs are to
promote focus-oriented activity and
discussion (they are not paid, but do
get choice housing in their unguar
anteed year), there is no reason why
each house should not offer fre
quent, quality programming that is
truly relevant to its theme.
Since the focuses are determined
by the Resident Fellows and their
own academic interests, they also
should make an effort to share their
knowledge with residents. However,

just as in any other dorm, the student
staff should be self-sufficient and
should not need to be policed by RFs.
Although the staff does in large
part determine the success of a
focus house, other residents also
need to make their contributions
in order for the focus to work.
About 20 students in each house
get Draw priority by proposing and
promising to do a project that is rel
evant to the focus. However, resi
dents in all of the focus houses said
that to their knowledge few priori
ty projects have actually been done.
Since prospective residents
needed only to submit a paragraph
long proposal to obtain priority, it
is likely that students who may not
have been genuinely interested in
the focus submitted proposals any
way, to get a "leg up" in the Draw.
A lax attitude in making sure
project proposals are followed
through will only encourage stu
dents to abuse the system.
Focus-house staff members said
almost anyone who submitted a
proposal was granted the priority,
and that the selection process is
handled mostly through Residential
Education.
A more rigorous selection pro
cess for students who get in on pri
ority should be enforced and each
focus house's staff should be more
involved in this process. Doing so
would insure, as much as possible,
that students who are granted pri
ority will not only complete a
worthwhile project, but also con
tribute to the general atmosphere
and activity of the dorm.
Despite the problems in some
dorms, there are successes that
show the potential of the focus
house concept: Residents in Schiff,
the performing arts focus house,
say the staff has poured energy into
the dorm's programming, with fre
quent trips to plays or musicals and
the bi-weekly "Open Mike Night."
While the idea of the focus house
should be continued, to encourage
intellectual discussion and program
ming in dorms, the common catch
phrase applies: If you're going to do
it, do it right.
