University should lift unit limit for undergraduates

With the cost of Stanford, and educa
tion in general, rising continuously,
Casper's recent suggestions to shorten
students' time here and Stanford
Kroopfs exhortation to students to
broaden their course loads, I want to
know why I am unable to get my
money's worth out of Stanford.
I am in one of those technical mtyors
which Kroopf described, and I am trying
to broaden my course load by taking
humanities courses in which I am inter
ested. But the University has repeatedly
told me that I cannot take more than 20
units a quarter.
I am not trying to be a workaholic; I
am merely taking classes I'm interested
in, in addition to the requirements for
my mEgor. Whether I choose to take
these extra classes for the pass/ no credit
option or for a grade does not seem to

make a difference — University policy
decrees that a student cannot take more
than 20 units.
When I tried to petition to take extra
units my sophomore year, I was told
that students allowed to take more
than 20 unito once duiing their under
graduate career, and I should not bother
to come back until I was a senior, if
then. I went back this year, only to be
told that there was no way my petition
would be granted, because I was taking a
French film class for fun. It did not mat
ter that every other class was to fulfill
my major or graduate-school require
ments, the film class was not absolutely
necessary.
I could, however, take it for one unit
rather than for the four units for which
it was listed in the time schedule. When
I mentioned I would just take the class

for zero units (you can do that — get a
grade listed on your transcript and
everything; the class is just listed for
zero units . . . try to explain that to grad
uate schools and future employers), a
woman in the academic-standing office
told me this was an impossibility. One
cannot take a class for zero units at
Stanford. When I politely told her that
she was misinformed because I had done
it before, she appeared to be quite
insulted and reiterated that it was an
impossibility.
I would like to hear from the adminis
tration why. Why do I have to sneak in
the classes I want to take by taking
them for zero units? Why can't I get
credit for a class if I happen to think it is
interesting enough to put in the extra
time? If I have to take other classes that
quarter, is that any reason why I can't

also take the classes that interest me? In
short, why can't I get my money's worth
at Stanford? I understand the idea of
strongly encouraging students not to
overload. A suggested limit of 20 units is
fair enough, but this is college. I think
we should be able to make our own deci
sions about how much work we can han
dle in one quarter.
I'll put in the four years; I'm not try
ing to graduate early. But I don't have
the money to stay an extra year or two,
and darn it, I want the well-rounded
education that was promised to me in
"Approaching Stanford," as well as all of
the classes I want to take in my major. If
I'm willing to put in the work, why
won't the University let me, rather than
sticking to the magic 20?
