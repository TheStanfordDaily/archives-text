# Talk of a new football stadium excessive, a ridiculous complaint
## 
### 
This is the third time I've wanted to
write The Daily, and this time I've decided
to follow through. It seems like everyone
has a complaint to write the editor about,
and a lot of them are pretty petty, but
today I read probably the most ridiculous
complaint I've seen so far, and unfortu
nately my name was signed to it. I had to
tell several friends, "No, I didn't write
that stupid letter." The other Dan Jones
wants to build a new stadium because he's
just not close enough to the game.
I believe Americans on average, and
Stanford students especially, are pretty
spoiled, but this is going too far. Stan
ford, like America in general, is in bad
economic shape, and I wouldn't think I'd
need to state this blatantly obvious fact
if it weren't for people like the other
Dan Jones. I dropped economics as a

major, but I'm still capable of grasping
that concept. In dire economic situa
tions, it's time to either trim down on
the excesses or be willing to pay more for
them. A new stadium is an EXCESS.
I keep seeing in the news all sorts of
interest groups trying to keep their pro
grams from getting reduced or cut, yet
everyone bitches about their taxes going
up. You can't get something for nothing.
Sorry, it's been tried, and that's why
Stanford and the U.S. are in the lousy
shape they're in. I believe that certain
programs in the U.S. should not be cut,
so I have to accept a tax increase. Those
government programs are important. At
Stanford, however, tuition is going up
7.5 percent next year, and I hope not a
single dime of it goes to something as
ridiculous as a new stadium.
Ya wanna get closer? Get some binoc
ulars! If crowd involvement is the prob
lem, take some of your complaining
energy to the game and scream a little
more. Maybe people will join you.
Do that before you ask the entire Stan
ford schedule to change.

Besides, we need the track for the
Tree to run around on.
This is just one example of the petty
crap people complain about every day. I
didn't want people to think it was I com
plaining. Dan, do me a favor â€” if ya
write another letter, sign your full name.
