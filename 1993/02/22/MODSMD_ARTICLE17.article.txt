# At night, dark bicycles invisible to motorists; must use bicycle light
## 
### 
I applaud Ricardo Martinez's effort to
increase the use of bicycle helmets on
campus, and I would like to raise an addi
tional concern. I have lived on campus for
almost three years, and I am becoming
very distressed about the number of bicy
clists who ride at night without lights,
and even without reflectors. Bikes usually
do not stop for stop signs on campus.
Many drivers understand the momentum

problem and happily wave the bicyclists
ahead of them, anyway. However, at
night, when dark bikes are all-but-invisi
ble, the situation becomes exceptionally
dangerous. Here is what I fear:
One night a careful driver is going to
look but will not see an unlighted bicycle
racing toward the intersection, or cross
ing a driveway in the bike lane. The car
and the bitycle will collide and the cyclist
will be severely injured or even killed.
The next day the newspapers will lament
the tragedy and urge all cyclists to get
lights and helmets. The police depart
ment will start issuing citations for bicy
clists who ride at night without front and
rear lights, and the bicycle shop will offer
lights at 20 percent off. The bicyclists
will buy lights, and the situation will
improve greatly. However, one bicyclist
will have had to have been seriously
injured or killed to bring about the
improvement.
Please, bikers, use lights at night. I
don't want to be the one to hit you.
