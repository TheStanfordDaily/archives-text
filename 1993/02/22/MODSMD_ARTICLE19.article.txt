## Don't be a slave to a 'Book

POWERBOOK. EVEN THE name of
Apple's new line of laptop comput
ers sounds a little ominous. If I
were a regular book, I'd feel insignificant
because I wasn't a POWERbook. The
Powerßook inspires awe. It's so small.
And so powerful. Like Napoleon. And its
name has something Machiavellian about
it, something that, like power lunch,
power tie, and the briefcase it resembles,
suggests male dominance. Instead of an
apple, the Powerßook might have had a
little rainbow colored phallus for its logo.
But that's not quite fair — men and
women and all sorts of different People
are using Powerßooks. Here at Stanford,
they're using them in the library, at the
Coffee House and probably in class lec
tures to take notes.
The Powerßook's portability is its
most exciting feature and also its most
potentially frightening one. Exciting
because you can take it anywhere, fright
ening because you might not be able to go
anywhere without it. It may become a
new necessity.
It's already happened with phones,
this false freedom. There are car phones,
airplane phones and pocket phones —
phones can go anywhere these days. Iron
ically, though, what looks like a cordless
phone is really a phone with an infinitely
long cord. It seems unattached, but it
really ties its user down more securely
than the old corded phone ever did. With
a phone in the pocket, we can get ahold of

anybody at any time, anyone can get
ahold of us. All these holds: so many tech
nological tethers.
This deceptive sense of escape
reminds me of the time, when I was
younger, when the neighborhood kids
were out playing and someone lit a fire
cracker and stuck it in Kenny Jewel's
back pocket. He was so scared that all he
could think to do was run. And he just
kept looking back over his shoulder at
that fizzling little stick of dynamite, hop
ing desperately that he could somehow
outrun his pants.
With the cordless phone we can talk
anywhere, with the cordless Powerßook
we can wordprocess anywhere, like out
side in the foothills, under a tree, in
Nature. In the age of the Powerßook,
no space is fVbttT'&tf'lfeast the
potential of being a workspace — no
secluded sycamore, no cafe, no grassy
knoll — the Powerßook can work any
where.
And so, as fast as we run, we can't
escape this potential: "I could be work
ing on my Powerßook now." In the
pre-portable-computer days, we could
rest assured when we went away for,
say, a weekend skiing, that up on the
ski lift we could enjoy ourselves to the
fullest because there was no possibility
of doing anything else. Now, conceiv
ably, we could be typing away on a
Powerßook on the ski lift. Why waste
time?

Of course, that's ridiculous. Nobody
would think of toting his or her Power-
Book around in the snow, largely because
the POWERbook is, ironically, a delicate
machine. If its owner dropped it on the
slopes, she'd end up with a POWDERbook.
And all these Powerßookers in the
Coffee House make me a little nervous —
I'm always afraid one of them will spill
coffee on his beautiful, compact gadget. A
normal Noteßook could survive such a
soaking; its pages might curl a bit. But
the Powerßook would be rendered impo
tent, it would short-circuit and fizzle out,
or blow up like the firecracker in Kenny
Jewel's back pocket and become a Power
lessßook. Then it would be worthless:
"FOR SALE: Wet, Powerlessßook."
But who knows, maybe a SnowAndWa
terProofßook is on the way. Those Pow
er Engineers are sure to keep outdoing
themselves. Somebody must be at work
on the SuperPowerßook and, after that,
the SuperDuperPowerßook.
Sign up now, the Omnipotenceßook is
surely coming soon.

To gain a sympathetic perspective, Rob
Baedeker wrote his column on a Power-
Book 160. He is grumpy because his cel
lular phone is on the fritz.
