# Prof. urges use of birth control to mitigate population explosion

Asserting that environmental
problems caused by population
growth are most severe in the Unit
ed States, Prof. Paul Ehrlich advo
cated increased use of birth control
in developed countries as a partial
solution to current environmental
woes at the 1993 Stanford Health
Policy Forum on Saturday.
Betsy Hartmann, director of the
population and development pro
gram at Hampshire College, of

fered an opposing argument, say
ing that population control was not
a panacea for environmental decay.
About 200 people attended the
debate in Cubberley Auditorium
as part of the forum titled, "Popu
lation Growth and the Environ
ment: A Dangerous Trend?"
Ehrlich, a professor of popula
tion studies in the Department of
Biological Sciences, argued that
the primary solution to the envi
ronmental crisis lies in population
control.
Using a method of population

analysis that combines figures of
total population, affluence and
technology within a country,
Ehrlich calculated that "the most
serious population problems are
found in the United States." He at
tributed 55 percent of this coun
try's environmental degradation in
the last century to population
growth â€” compared to 49 percent
in other countries.
"About 70 percent of environ
mental degradation occurs in rich
countries," he added. Because
"rich" countries have such high
standards of living, each person
does much more damage to the
environment than in less devel
oped countries.
Pointing out a disproportion
ate distribution of energy use
among the world's people,
Ehrlich noted that in 1990, about
1.2 billion rich people used 7.5
kilowatts per person, while each
of the remaining four billion peo
ple from poorer nations used
about one kilowatt.
"We have seen an enormous
increase of human numbers
throughout our lifetimes," he
said. "Something must be done in
the near future in order to reverse
this trend."

Ehrlich recommended "educa
tion about birth control combined
with empowerment" to reduce
birth rates throughout the world.
In response, Hartmann argued
that environmental and popula
tion problems are not directly
related to such issues as birth
control, and that there are more
pressing issues facing humanity.
"I think that the largest prob
lems of the '90s are not environ
mental, but are social issues like
racism," she said.
Hartmann's solutions to over
population involved reversing the
consumerism of the richer
nations. "We have to realize that
people don't need to have such
high standards of living," she said.
"There are certain ways of life
that we take for granted that we
really don't need in order to be
happy," Hartmann added. "These
are the problems that are killing
our planet."
