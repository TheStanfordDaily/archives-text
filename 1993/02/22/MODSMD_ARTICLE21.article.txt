Stanford needs to focus on cutting costs more

IHAVE NO DOUBT THAT GERHARD
Casper wants to minimize college costs
and streamline the way Stanford pursues
its educational goals. Stanford operates off of
a tremendous budget, and in passing many of
these costs on to the student, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to finance a four-year
education. An optional three-year plan
through college provides a good alternative
for students who want to attend Stanford,
but cannot easily afford a full four years. But
the plan does little to solve the real problem
of increasing costs and expenditures and may
detract from students' overall enjoyment and
experience of attending Stanford.
If Stanford wants to contain its costs, the
University should get to the root of the prob
lem: why administrative and overhead expendi
tures are rising so dramatically. The teaching,
research, community activities, fine arts and
student programs available at Stanford all con
tribute significantly to making the University a

vibrant and dynamic place to work and go to
school. But Stanford should reassess where it
is putting its funding, so as not to spend money
in places where it is not used well or it is not
absolutely necessary. In this respect, Casper
has a job, much like Clinton in trying to
streamline federal spending and bureaucracy,
to cut down on excess spending in an effort to
bring overall costs down.
Keeping the status quo and not finding an
effective way to reduce spending would only
mean that a full Stanford education would
become increasingly inaccessible. More and
more students who could not easily afford a
four year education would opt to compact their
education into a three-year plan. The case
might arise that a fourth or fifth year at Stan
ford would be a luxury, rather than a standard
part of the curriculum.
In most cases, a four-year college education
is preferable to a three-year term. Students, if
they took only three years to graduate, would

have to compact all they would have to learn
into a relatively short time. Not only would
this situation be academically demanding, but
the artificially shortened period would leave lit
tle time for other aspects that define a stu
dent's college experience, such as outside activ
ities, cultivation of friendships and in-depth
study of one's academic field. A three-year pro
gram, under these circumstances, would
amount to a rushed and less satisfying version
of a four-year education.
The fact that students might have the
option to take a three-year track is effective in
that many students who might not otherwise
be able to attend Stanford because of financial
reasons, would then be able to attend. Howev
er, Casper's plan is only a response to the prob
lem, and not a solution. The real trick is to
make it so students do not have to take the
three-year option.
