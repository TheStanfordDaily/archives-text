# Three-year degree will merely help privileged
## 
### 
University President Gerhard Casper surely
knows that there already are many Stanford stu
dents who finish their degrees in three years.
These students come cruising here from top,
likely private, high schools with lots of Advanced
Placement and local college credits; some are
classified as seniors before the end of their first
year. Casper's proposal for a three-year under
graduate option — which partly relies on those
AP credits (according to the Feb. 12 Daily arti
cle) — would merely codify what these students
have been doing for years.
Meanwhile, the other Stanford students,
whose high schools might not have offered any
or enough college-level opportunities, could not
qualify for the accelerated program. These stu
dents would be on the slower — read: inferior —
track through no fault of their own. Contrary to
the tone of The Daily's Feb. 16 editorial, it does
seem the three-year degree would be more pres
tigious than the four-year degree. Still, this sec
ond group of students would remain miles ahead
of public university students, who very often
take six or seven years to get their diplomas,
despite never failing a class, thanks to past and
on-going budget cuts affecting class availability

and financial aid. Of course, Casper has empha
sized that he is not presently worrying about
public university students.
Therefore, I submit that Casper's current
proposal would probably have little effect other
than to institutionalize the quick trip of the most
privileged students at a privileged university.
