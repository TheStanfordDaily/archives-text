# New plan answers wrong questions

### 
Gerhard Casper just doesn't get it. Like his pre
decessor, he seems to waste his creative energies
trying to find a revenue solution caused by run
away costs. Until now, Stanford's spending prob
lem has been "solved" largely with double-digit
tuition increases. Casper has concluded, quite rea
sonably, that this practice cannot continue. Yet
rather than rolling up his sleeves for the messy
business of paring expenditures, he puts on the
philosopher's cap to justify a new scheme to raise
revenues, the three-year undergraduate degree.
Casper has lit upon the notion that with a few
pen strokes he can admit 25 percent more fresh
young faces to the charmed circle and raise
tuition proportionally. Of course, the caliber of
the student body will be diluted somewhat, but

Casper has no doubt concluded that Stanford's
applicant pool is strong enough to permit the
influx. The curriculum will also suffer, but per
haps Casper reasons that Stanford students are
clever enough to get by with less. In any event,
the burden of the change will be borne by the
students. From the standpoint of the adminis
tration, nothing will change except for the
rewriting of a few requirements and a welcome
opportunity to rekindle Faculty Club discussions
about the meaning of a liberal-arts education.
It is not difficult to understand why Casper is
enamored of this scheme: it postpones the reck
oning. The University can go on spending as it
does for a while longer — new buildings can
keep going up, costly programs can continue to
be added and expanded. The truly difficult choic
es, the matter of focusing and prioritizing, can be
left, perhaps, for Casper's successor. But where
will Stanford be then?
Casper states that "it is naive to assume that
the major universities can just go on as they
have without reexamination of their ways."
Stanford might begin by reexamining the
premise that tuition has to go up by 10 percent
each year. The problem is not, "How can we
enable families to swallow our spiraling costs?"
The problem is, "How can we keep our costs in
line with inflation?" The three-year degree is a
cowardly answer to the wrong question.
