# Plan is first step to addressing problems
## 
### 
I applaud President Casper's proposal for id
three-year degree plan and disagree with many
points in The Daily's editorial of Feb. 16 and
other recent editorials opposing the proposal.
The reasons for supporting Casper's proposal
are the reasons he stated, i.e., a need to reduce
the cost of education. This is a topic very near
and dear to my heart, as it has adversely
affected me, personally, over the years.
Some opposing arguments are simply ludi
crous. The Daily editorial cites that many stu
dents informally pursue a three-year plan
already. Then the editorial goes on to cite the
prestige of a four-year diploma, lack of
extracurricular activities, less flexibility and
probable cuts in aid. So, if a three-year degree
program is so disadvantageous, why do people
do it informally now? And if Casper formalizes
what already exists, what's the beef?
The final points the editorial makes are
good, i.e., the conflicting need to deliver more
education at a lower cost. Casper's proposal is
one such plan, but not the only alternative. I'm
surprised, for example, that expansion of the
already-existing Stanford Instructional Televi
sion Network (SITN) program — including
cooperation with, and expansion to, public
institutions — is not being discussed (at least
publicly). I'm pleased Casper is addressing sim
ilar issues as they relate to graduate education.
I also concur that mundane cost-cutting is
required. Such cuts should be made with care,
so that efficiency improves without sacrificing

educational goals. Bad examples of cost-cutting
can be seen in public institutions, where stu
dents must prolong their degree program
because they can't get the classes they need.
Historically, higher education has been avail
able only to those whose parents could provide
the resources. Casper's efforts are steps in the
right direction to rectify this inequity.
