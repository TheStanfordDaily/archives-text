# Graduate of program says it's not a bad thing

Yes, I'm afraid it's another foreigner sooth
ingly whispering in your disbelieving ears such
programs "aren't so bad" after all!
But first, let me at least share one of the con
cerns you expressed in your Feb. 16 editorial
"No time left for you." You are worried that hav
ing both three and four-year tracks will bring
with them some unwanted implications. Namely,
that it will represent a class division, with only
the wealthy attending the four-year courses.
That may happen, but if I were to guess, it
would be that the main danger in having two
such tracks would be more in their inevitably
being seen as an indication of how smart some
one is, rather than how rich they are. That is,
the good students can do the work in three years
while the less able do it in four.
If this were to occur, it would be unfair and
undesirable, to be sure â€” but don't tell me such
implications aren't already built into the higher
education system as it exists. I am confident that

Stanford students, or at least their parents, are
quite aware of this.
Also, who can disagree with you that "College
is supposed to be a place of self-discovery and
inspiration." However, I humbly disagree that
"The three-year program permits neither."
Like everyone in England, I got my degree in
three years, and I do believe I got my share of both.
Actually, I recall being both delighted and
rather sheepish to have what seemed like so much
time and opportunity to devote to issues I was sure
were terribly important in the big scheme, and had
nothing to do with me, personally. It turned out to
be the reverse, naturally, but the point is that
young (college age) people do their "self-discovery
and inspiration" thing, no matter what.
It's an impulse that just isn't subject to mortal
concerns like how many classes you have in a day.
Cultural expectations have a lot to do with
the whole thing, of course; if you know you've
got three years, you do things in three years.
When you know you've got four, you plan on
four, and three seems absolutely impossible. If
it is this sort of "birth right" issue that's really
bothering you, then OK, but there's no need to
disguise it by imagining that a three-year pro
gram will somehow be improperly hurling stu
dents into adulthood ("Before your time," like a
wine not aged enough), because it won't!
And anyway, birth rights have a habit of
becoming dead wrongs in a twinkle when they
become too expensive. So don't rule out anything,
as you look to your future, and your children's.
Mark you, though, I'm certainly glad I won't
have to explain to my daughter why I got to spend
four years at school, and she only gets three!
