# The 						word on the street: responses to 3-year plan

"Stanford education, to me, doesn't con
sist of going to classes and reading the
books. That I can do at home. What it con
sists of to me is meeting the people and
learning about a new environment. It took
me two years to get comfortable here. My
third year I started learning the ropes,
taking on leadership positions. My fourth
year (now), I'm very comfortable, I can
help other people learn too. If you take
awav a vear from me. vou take away a big

chunk of the education."

"I welcome the questioning, or challenging, of the four
years' (system). .. it's a good time to ask fundamental ques
tions about education, from K through 12 to graduate
schools ... .But a question I have is that of time pressure.
Time pressure would certainly mitigate against public ser
vice activities. I like the fact that Casper is asking questions
about what the ingredients of a baccalaureate degree should
be. .. . But if it's simply a matter of reducing time to reduce
cost, rich opportunities for students will be in danger."

"Financially, I would agree with it. I think
it's a great idea. I know a lot of people who
graduate a quarter early because of financial
reasons. But actually, I don't think you'd be
getting the full education you're getting
now. I know compared to the European sys
tem, our first year of college is equivalent to
their first year of high school. Deciding a
major and everything goes on then. So I have
kind of conflicting ideas on it."

"It's not a good idea. The major purpose of undergraduate
education is to get a liberal arts education as well as be pre
pared for professional schools. In the sciences it's already
hard (to be prepared in four years). ... If we were a trade
school, it might be different. ... I don't see many juniors I
think are well-prepared for grad school or life. In Biology,
it's not until senior year that students get into depth."
— Craig Heller
Professor of biology

"It's a good idea to look into different alter
natives. Obviously, it has to be done careful
ly, because it could undermine the validity or
the legitimacy of a Stanford education. But
something has to be done. People can't go to
school if they can't afford it.... I personally
did not have enough AP credit to do some
thing like [three years], but if something
like that was open to me, if it was accredited,
I probably would have been interested."

"As it stands thfere's nothing in -the talfrent system: that
stops people from doing the three-year thing now. If it were
going to take away the majority of the distribution require
ments, I'd be hesitant. .. what would that say about our
priorities?. .. It also raises the issue of pressuring people to
overwork. There may be parental pressure to overwork, peo
ple taking 20 units, left without time to participate in
extracurriculars which make our university so great. But I
do think it's possible to come up with a valid three-year plan
— speaking from an engineering standpoint, I don't think
employers care about students taking a well-rounded
courseload.... A three-year program would be do-able to
the satisfaction of potential employers. . . . The only way you
can handle the pressure of a three year program is to know
from the outset that's what you what to do. That's a lot of
pressure to put on a student, make them know what they
want to do right away."
