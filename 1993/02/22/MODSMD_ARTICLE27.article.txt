## Men's hoops ends dry spell, wins 78-62 over Trojans Ten-game losing streak broken on strength of Cross' 15 points, team's tight defensive play 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Coach Mike Montgomery willed, "Let
there be a win." And after wandering
through the Pacific 10 Conference for 10
futile games in six long weeks, on Saturday
there was a victory. And it was good.
Stanford put together its best effort of
the season, as five players scored in double
figures to send the University of Southern
California — and the Trojans' NCAA-
Tournament hopes — south by a 78-62
count in front of 2,581 at Maples Pavilion.
"I wanted to cry on the bench I was so
happy," said Montgomery of the win. "We
gave the crowd something to cheer about.
That's the first time all year that we did
that."
The cheers came early as Stanford (7-
17,2-11 Pac-10) took the lead for good, 10-
7, on a Dion Cross three-pointer from the
right wing four minutes into the contest.
Cross, along with fellow freshman Darren
Allaway, scored 14 of the Cardinal's first
19 points.
The true indicator that fate was on the
Cardinal's side came in the form of reserve
Peter Dukes. Dukes, who had yet to find
the long-range shooting touch that he dis
played throughout last season, regained
his form on Saturday, hitting his first two

three-point shots, and three-of-four for the
game to spark a devastating 17-0 first half
run that left USC (13-9, 6-7) in shock.
"As they say in the old westerns, 'It's a
bad day in Blackrock,'" said USC coach
George Ravelling. "I've been afraid of this
game ever since we left Los Angeles,
because when a team is on a long losing
streak the law of averages is bound to catch
up. Mike's kids did a good job. They didn't
give up on themselves. They came out
today and put a lot of things together that
they were missing in the past."
One of those things had been inside
play, but Stanford's big men again indicat
ed signs of improvement. Bart Lammersen
built on the progress he evidenced against
UCLA in grabbing six rebounds. Mean
while, Jim Morgan showed increased pres
ence in the post, even filling the lane nicely
to score on a fast break late in the opening
period, to give the Cardinal a 23-point lead,
its largest margin of the game. Trojan
widebodies Mark Boyd and Tremayne
Anchrum were held to combined totals of
11 points and nine rebounds.
"That's the best job anyone has done
against us all year in defending our interi
or," Ravelling said.
Allaway, who finished with 13 points
and seven rebounds, provided muscle at
both ends of the floor, forcing USC to close

up its defense and allowing the Cardinal to
get clean shots from the perimeter.
"I was incoherent," Allaway said. "I
looked up once, when I came out and saw
we were up by 20, and I thought, 'There's
no way.' But I checked my math and I was
right."
The math was all in Stanford's favor on
the afternoon. Cross again led Stanford in
scoring with 15 points for the contest. For
ward Brent Williams was 6-for-10 from the
field to finish with 13 points and eight
rebounds, and guard Marcus Lollie had 12
points and nine assists. As a team, the Car
dinal shot 55.6 percent in the first half and
46.8 percent for the game. They also con
verted 26-of-29 free throws.
"We had better performances right
down the line," Montgomery said. "This
just demonstrates that if you play good
basketball you can win."
Stanford's defense effectively took USC
out of the game from the start. The Cardi
nal guards played tight perimeter defense,
and as a result, USC was ineffective from
the three-point line. After making 14
threes against California last Thursday
night, the Trojans only managed an 8-for
-25 effort against Stanford. If not for guard

closing minutes before the intermis
sion, the Trojans would have trailed
by even more than the sizeable 46-
29 halflime gap.
In the second half, USC got no
closer than 12 points, but Stanford
then reeled off five-straight free
throws to seal a long-awaited victory.
"I'm just happy to come out, play
well find have something go right for
a change," Ijollie said.
"My goodness, eveiyone's jump
ing up and down, singing and danc
ing in the locker room," Allaway
said. "It was nice to get that weight
off our shoulders."
