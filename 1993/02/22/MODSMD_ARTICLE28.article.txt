# Victory tastes sweet for entire Cardinal squad
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Oh how sweet it is.
After more than a month of missed
shots and mounting frustration, the wait
is over. On Saturday afternoon, the Car
dinal overcame the odds, the critics and
the empty seats in Maples Pavilion to
prove that it would not give up.
This time, the shots would go down,
the passes would be made, and the
rebounds grabbed. An old face would
return to show the fans that he's still got
it. And Stanford, for the first time in 10
games, would have more points than the
other guys when the buzzer sounded.
The Cardinal's 78-62 win over USC sure
ly doesn't rank among the all-time thrilling
wins in Stanford history, but you can defi
nitely make a case for it being the most
relieving one. Just ask anyone on the team.
•"I'm just so happy for the kids, they
really deserved it. I'm quite relieved."
—Head Coach Mike Montgomery.
•"I'm just happy. It's nice to have some
things go right for us."
— Senior point guard Marcus Lollie.

•"I just felt good."
— Freshman Darren Allaway.
•"Oh man, it feels really good. I've been
anticipating this for a long time, so I'm
just going to sit back and eat it all up."
— Freshman Dion Cross.
•"It felt great to get the win. I've never
felt like that before — I was so happy."
—Senior Brent Williams.
Perhaps lost in the commotion of the
win, however, was a stellar performance by
one of the Cardinal's veterans, a seasoned
three-point bomber who broke a slump of
his own to lead Stanford to the upset victo
ry. Pouring in 13 points on 3-9 shooting (3-
6 from three-point range), and hitting all
four of his free throws, Peter Dukes
returned to prime time in classic style.
"It feels good, obviously," Dukes said,
following the game. "I got on a little roll in
the first half and just played it out."
After ranking second in the Pacific 10
Conference last year in three-point per
centage (.470) and breaking the single
season Stanford record for three-pointers
made (79), Dukes has had nothing but
problems this year. His three-point per
centage has dropped to .311, including a

.256 percentage since the beginning of the
Cardinal's Pac-10 schedule. Once consid
ered one of the most dangerous scorers in
Stanford's starting lineup, Dukes has
taken a seat on the bench to make room
for Cross, the hottest hand on the team in
recent games.
On Saturday afternoon, however, Dukes
came off the bench to light up the three-point
shot like he used to in the days of Adam
Keefe — days which seem light-years away.
"For some reason, Pete seems to have
a knack for defending USC's guys," Mont
gomery said, "and did you see the smile on
his face when he hit those threes?"
With Dukes and the rest of the outside
shooters sinking their shots, Lollie had a
much easier time running the offense.
"It helped to have everyone on," Lollie
said. "I'm happy for Pete because he real
ly shot well, and it's about time for him."
Dukes and the Cardinal had nothing
but praise for each others' play, as well as
high hopes for the rest of the season.
"Now we go into the second half of our
schedule with more confidence," Cross
said. "We're just going to take this game
to Washington and keep it up."
