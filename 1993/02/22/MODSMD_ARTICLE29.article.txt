# Defending champion Stanford loses in first round of indoor tournament
## No. 2-seeded men's tennis upset by Louisiana State, finishes ninth 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Unfortunately for the Cardinal men's tennis
team, history did not repeat itself this weekend in
Louisville, Ky. The seven-time winners of the
National Indoor Team Championships could not
pull off victory No. 8; in fact, they lost their first
match.
No. 14 Louisiana State upset the No. 2 Cardinal
in the second round, 4-3, after Stanford's first
round bye. However, the Cardinal came back to win
its consolation matches against Kentucky and Duke,
by identical scores of 5-2, for a ninth-place finish.
"We didn't play badly," said head coach Dick
Gould. "All the teams were really even in our half of
the draw. I knew we wouldn't walk over anyone."
Stanford's performance was marked by several
bright spots, despite the loss to LSU. At first singles,
Michael Flanagan proved he can play with the best
in the nation, defeating 12th-ranked David Hall of
Duke, 6-2, 2-6, 6-1, and Kentucky's Mahyar
Goodarz, 7-6, 2-6,6-3. A 6-4,6-3 loss to No. 5 Tamer
El Sawy clinched the Tigers' victory but showed that
"Michael can stay with just about anybody — at
worst," according to Gould.
Another highlight was junior Robert Devens'
string of three wins at No. 4 singles, including what
Gould called a "grueling, gutty match" against Blue
Devil Pete Ayers, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (6), 7-6 (1).
After a shaky start, No. 24-ranked Vimal Patel,
playing at third singles, avenged his loss to LSU with
two top performances against Kentucky and Duke.
The Stanford junior defeated Wildcat Jason Yeager
7-6 (2), 6-2 and Duke's Willy Quest, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4.
In the bottom half of the lineup, freshman JefT
Salzenstein managed a successful weekend despite a
pulled stomach muscle. He notched up Stanford's
second and final singles point on Thursday, defeat
ing LSU's Chad Dudley, 6-1, 7-6 (2). He followed up
with a smooth 6-2, 6-2 win over Wildcat Stephen
Mather.

Saturday's opponent, Robby Chess, took advan
tage of Salzenstein's weak serve due to the pulled
stomach muscle to win, 6-2, 6-4.
"JefFs serve is not a strength but he can't really
practice or hit hard (until the muscle heals)," Gould
said.
At No. 6 singles, captain Roman Sydorak, recov
ering from the flu, lost to LSU and Kentucky in
straight sets. Junior Billy Wright stepped in on Sat
urday and successfully handled Duke's Jordan Mur
ray, 6-2, 6-4.
Junior Chris Cocotos, at second singles, also had
a disappointing weekend, losing all three of his
matches.
He fared much better in doubles, though, as did
the rest of the team. Undefeated throughout the
tournament, Cocotos and Flanagan paired up at
first doubles, leading the squad to three team dou
bles victories.
Under the new match format, the three doubles
matches are played as eight-game presets and count
for one team point total. On Thursday, Devens and
Salzenstein played at third doubles, adding a victory
to the first doubles win, clinching the team point.
Against Kentucky, it was Patel and freshman
Jim Thomas (also suffering a pulled stomach mus
cle), at second doubles, who clinched a Cardinal vic
toiy. Their 8-6 win proved to be as exciting as Coco
tos and Flanagan'B 9-8 (8-6) victory.
Saturday, it was the first and third doubles teams
who secured the team point for the Cardinal.
Although Gould was pleased with the doubles
wins, he stressed the amount of improvement still
necessary. "We need to work on defense, making
intelligent lobs, and better shot selection, not just
blasting through opponents," he said.
The team's No. 9 finish will have adverse effects
on the Cardinal's national ranking, but Gould feels
the team's current No. 2 position is based more on
last year's success than this year's performances.
"We're not a No. 2 team right now," he said. "We
didn't deserve it."
