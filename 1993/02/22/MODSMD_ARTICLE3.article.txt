# 'Voice of conscience'
## Poet's work stresses political activism 
### Brad Winters 
After 13 years of teaching poet
ry workshops each winter quar
ter, Denise Levertov is still
putting her concern for the devel
opment of young poets and her in
tense, honest style to work in the
classroom.
Although she spends most of
the year at her Seattle home, Lev
ertov said she migrates south
each winter because she believes
there is a need for poetry in every
body's life.
While on the Farm as an Eng
lish professor, Levertov runs
workshops for undergraduates
and Stegner fellows — a group of
eight poets who have been select
ed to spend two years writing and
working together to improve their
poetry skills.
Through her poetry and es
says, Levertov is known for her
political activism, which has been
especially prevalent during the
Vietnam and Gulf Wars.
"She is a voice of conscience.
She's been involved in all the is
sues of our time — Vietnam, nu
clear disarmament," said first

year Stegner fellow Emily Warn.
"She's been very vocal about the
need to preserve our world. She's
done all that and helped shape the
American poem."
However, Levertov said she
does not make a special effort to
make her poems political in na
ture, but instead writes about im
portant aspects of her own life.
"If a person has written a poem
about a tree, you can't ask them
why," she explained. "It's just
there."
Her poetry is not only noted for
its political content but also for its
emphasis on musicality and its
contributions to the development
of less traditional and more open
forms of poetry.
"Music in poetry is very impor
tant to her," said Sheila Donahue,
a first-year Stegner fellow who is
participating in Levertov's work
shop. "She places a lot of stress on
how you read the poem aloud."
Taking special care to stress
line breaks is one of Levertov's
trademarks. "It's one thing to
read the poem on a page and see
the line break. It's another thing
to hear it and not know where
that break is," Donahue said.
Awarded a senior fellowship by
the National Endowment for the
Arts in 1990 for her contributions
to American literature, Levertov
said she sees poetry not just as
pretty words, but as a way of song
and dance which she has been
drawn to since she was a young
child because of its "music, evoca
tion of moods and sense of magic."
Levertov said she recalls being
"enchanted, stirred and captivat
ed" by words that she was too
young understand intellectually.
"The roots (of poetry) are
incantation, primal encounters
(and) the primal sounds of woe
and wonder which intensify an
awareness of our experience in
the world," Levertov explained.
English Department Vice-
Chair Albert Gelpi said Levertov
is an important asset for the
University because of her contri
butions as a poet and teacher.
"She's got such energy and
commitment and dedication that
she's a real presence in the
department," he said. "She is a
poet of not just national, but
international repute. She is a
world-renowned poet and that
reputation is based on a really
extensive and still-growing body
of poetry. I think she is one of the
most important poets in the
English-speaking world."
Levertov said she enjoys
teaching because of her stu
dents. "Both the classes I teach
here are small and I am working
with talented people," she
explained.
"I don't have to deal with peo
ple who are not serious about
poetry or who do not have tal
ent," she said. "It's nice, espe
cially when you're in the arts, to
work with people with talent."
Warn said working with Lever
tov is a special experience because
"she demands precision — intel
lectual precision, musical preci
sion, literary precision."
"She's very insightful. The
speed with which she can read a
poem and analyze it is amazing,"
said Warn.
As a poet, Levertov said she is
concerned with the internal
dynamics of both the artist and
the reader. "On the part of the
I poet I, a sufficient awareness of
the |reader| satisfies the aesthet
ic demands, and it is at this point
of satisfaction that the poem is
ready to move from the inner lis
tener to the external listener of
the world," she explained.
Raised in England, her unique
education contributed to her
childhood immersion in books,
museums and art galleries.
Because of the poor conditions of
the local schools, her parents
decided to teach her at home,
Levertov explained.
She soon began to write, pub

lishing some poems in journals
and periodicals, before her first
book, "Double Image", was
released in England in 1946.
Since that date, she has written
20 books of poetry and two collec
tions of essays.
Her first few years in the Unit
ed States, she explained, were
spent as an unknown poet and
young mother coping with a new
country and a new home.
But after her second book (the

first published in the United
States), Levertovs reputation
began to grow and she found her
self with a handful of invitations
to the world of teaching.
Although Levertov said she ini
tially approached teaching as a
poet rather than an academic, she
soon began to teach literature as
well as creative writing during
several stints as a visiting writer
at top universities including
Berkeley, M.I.T. and Tufts.

work with people with talent."
Warn said working with Lever
tov is a special experience because
"she demands precision — intel
lectual precision, musical preci
sion, literary precision."
"She's very insightful. The
speed with which she can read a
poem and analyze it is amazing,"
said Warn.
As a poet, Levertov said she is
concerned with the internal
dynamics of both the artist and
the reader. "On the part of the
I poet I, a sufficient awareness of
the |reader| satisfies the aesthet
ic demands, and it is at this point
of satisfaction that the poem is
ready to move from the inner lis
tener to the external listener of
the world," she explained.
Raised in England, her unique
education contributed to her
childhood immersion in books,
museums and art galleries.
Because of the poor conditions of
the local schools, her parents
decided to teach her at home,
Levertov explained.
She soon began to write, pub

lishing some poems in journals
and periodicals, before her first
book, "Double Image", was
released in England in 1946.
Since that date, she has written
20 books of poetry and two collec
tions of essays.
Her first few years in the Unit
ed States, she explained, were
spent as an unknown poet and
young mother coping with a new
country and a new home.
But after her second book (the

first published in the United
States), Levertovs reputation
began to grow and she found her
self with a handful of invitations
to the world of teaching.
Although Levertov said she ini
tially approached teaching as a
poet rather than an academic, she
soon began to teach literature as
well as creative writing during
several stints as a visiting writer
at top universities including
Berkeley, M.I.T. and Tufts.
After 13 years of teaching poet
ry workshops each winter quar
ter, Denise Levertov is still
putting her concern for the devel
opment of young poets and her in
tense, honest style to work in the
classroom.
Although she spends most of
the year at her Seattle home, Lev
ertov said she migrates south
each winter because she believes
there is a need for poetry in every
body's life.
While on the Farm as an Eng
lish professor, Levertov runs
workshops for undergraduates
and Stegner fellows — a group of
eight poets who have been select
ed to spend two years writing and
working together to improve their
poetry skills.
Through her poetry and es
says, Levertov is known for her
political activism, which has been
especially prevalent during the
Vietnam and Gulf Wars.
"She is a voice of conscience.
She's been involved in all the is
sues of our time — Vietnam, nu
clear disarmament," said first

year Stegner fellow Emily Warn.
"She's been very vocal about the
need to preserve our world. She's
done all that and helped shape the
American poem."
However, Levertov said she
does not make a special effort to
make her poems political in na
ture, but instead writes about im
portant aspects of her own life.
"If a person has written a poem
about a tree, you can't ask them
why," she explained. "It's just
there."
Her poetry is not only noted for
its political content but also for its
emphasis on musicality and its
contributions to the development
of less traditional and more open
forms of poetry.
"Music in poetry is very impor
tant to her," said Sheila Donahue,
a first-year Stegner fellow who is
participating in Levertov's work
shop. "She places a lot of stress on
how you read the poem aloud."
Taking special care to stress
line breaks is one of Levertov's
trademarks. "It's one thing to
read the poem on a page and see
the line break. It's another thing
to hear it and not know where
that break is," Donahue said.
Awarded a senior fellowship by
the National Endowment for the
Arts in 1990 for her contributions
to American literature, Levertov
said she sees poetry not just as
pretty words, but as a way of song
and dance which she has been
drawn to since she was a young
child because of its "music, evoca
tion of moods and sense of magic."
Levertov said she recalls being
"enchanted, stirred and captivat
ed" by words that she was too
young understand intellectually.
"The roots (of poetry) are
incantation, primal encounters
(and) the primal sounds of woe
and wonder which intensify an
awareness of our experience in
the world," Levertov explained.
English Department Vice-
Chair Albert Gelpi said Levertov
is an important asset for the
University because of her contri
butions as a poet and teacher.
"She's got such energy and
commitment and dedication that
she's a real presence in the
department," he said. "She is a
poet of not just national, but
international repute. She is a
world-renowned poet and that
reputation is based on a really
extensive and still-growing body
of poetry. I think she is one of the
most important poets in the
English-speaking world."
Levertov said she enjoys
teaching because of her stu
dents. "Both the classes I teach
here are small and I am working
with talented people," she
explained.
"I don't have to deal with peo
ple who are not serious about
poetry or who do not have tal
ent," she said. "It's nice, espe
cially when you're in the arts, to
work with people with talent."
Warn said working with Lever
tov is a special experience because
"she demands precision — intel
lectual precision, musical preci
sion, literary precision."
