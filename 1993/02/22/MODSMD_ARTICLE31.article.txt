# Women's hoops downs Huskies
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
With a national-television audience watching
its every move, the Stanford women's basketball
squad showed the entire country on Saturday that
it pays to be in good shape.
The Cardinal (19-5) ran past Connecticut on the
road 68-54 after wearing down the Huskies with a
second-half offensive outburst. Stanford embarked
on a 10-0 run early in the period, icing the game
and causing the exhausted Connecticut squad (16-
7) to give up hope.
"Our conditioning helped us a lot," said sopho
more Anita Kaplan. "Their players seemed to get
tired in the second half."
The Cardinal quickly extended a five-point lead
to a 40-31 advantage with 17 minutes, six seconds
remaining in the contest due to some outstanding
individual defensive efforts. First, center Val Whit
ing intercepted a Connecticut pass near midcourt
and dribbled in for a wide-open lay up. Moments
later, junior Christy Hedgpeth stole an overthrown
inbounds pass from underneath the Husky basket,
and cruised in for another uncontested two points.
Dissatisfied with just a single-digit lead, Stan
ford continued its relentless attack on the Con
necticut defense.
Hedgpeth, Kaplan and Chris MacMurdo scored
the next three baskets to give the Cardinal an over
whelming 46-31 advantage at the 15-minute mark.
The Huskies made things quite difficult for them
selves during this timespan, as its players only con
verted on two of their 14 shot attempts. A team
known for its skillful three-point shooting, Con
necticut's long-range bombers were shut down the
entire game by Stanford's aggressive perimeter
defense.
"We knew they were a good three-point shooting
team," Kaplan said. "We were trying to prevent
them from getting easy shots."
Not only did the Cardinal force the Husky players
out of their game plan, but it also succeeded in keep
ing the capacity crowd of 8,241 — only the second
advanced game sellout in the history of collegiate
women's basketball — from becoming a negative fac
tor.
"Our team was not phased at all by that crowd,"
said Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. "We took
the crowd out of the game in the second half."
Had the Cardinal been able to hit more of its
shots in the first half, the Huskies might have been
blown out right from the start. Several Stanford
players hustled to create open shots for themselves
only to have their attempts fall short on the front
of the rim.
"The only reason it was close in the first half was
