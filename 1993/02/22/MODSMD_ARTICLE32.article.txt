# Baseball braves elements, bucks Broncos in twin bill

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Mother Nature proved to be
tougher competition than Santa

Clara for the Cardinal baseball
squad this weekend.
No. 10 Stanford (10-2) swept a
rain-shortened series 8-2 and 10-1
from the Broncos (5-6-1), stretch

ing their winning streak to seven
games.
Friday's game at Sunken Dia
mond was postponed because of
the weather, as was yesterday's

game at Buck Shaw Stadium in
Santa Clara.
The two clubs did manage to
play both games of a doubleheader
at Stanford on Saturday — much
to Santa Clara's dismay. The Bron
cos looked absolutely helpless
against both ends of Stanford's
righty-lefty tandem of Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine.
"They're both throwing awfully
well," said coach Mark Marquess
of his top two starters. "There
might be some other guys out
there who are as good, but I
wouldn't want to trade [Adams
and Lorraine] for anyone else at
this point."
In the opener, Adams (3-0) scat
tered four singles in racking up his
second consecutive complete game.
Indeed, the only question that
remains about the junior right
hander entering Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division play next
weekend is, will he ever lose?
Adams, last week's Six-Pac Pitcher
of the Week, baffled Santa Clara
batsmen all day, striking out 10
and lowering his eamed-run aver
age to 1.45.
Stanford opened up scoring in
the third, picking up three runs on
a single hit. Sean Madden and
Todd Laßocca began the inning
with walks.
With one out, catcher A.J.
Hinch brought in both runners,
belting a Bob Pailthorpe fastball to
the wall in left field. Hinch, who
had missed the first five games of
the Cardinal winning streak for
personal reasons, started both
games of the doubleheader.
In the sixth, the Cardinal
extended its lead to four runs.
With one out, freshman Brodie
VanWagenen doubled down the
left-field line. On the next pitch,
Brian Dallimore belted another
double to left, driving in VanWage
nen. A Madden single through the
third-base hole made the score 6-2.
Madden picked up another RBI
in Game 2, and appears to have

won the interim starting position
in left field with regular Nate Olm
stead hampered by a sprained
ankle. Madden, who hit the game
winning home run in Tuesday's
contest against Cal State-Los
Angeles, has started in left for four
consecutive games.
The wind and rain picked up
during the second game of the
afternoon, shortening the contest
to seven innings.
Lorraine (3-0) seemed unfazed
by the miserable conditions,
notching his second complete
game in a row. The southpaw con
tinued his dominance of left-hand
ed batters, whiffing Bronco lefties
Mike Crisafulli and Tommy
Thompson three times in four offi
cial at-bats.
Lorraine's biggest question
mark entering the season con
cerned his control problems of the
past — he had walked 32 batters
in 45 career innings coming into
this campaign.
Thus far, the junior has
silenced those doubts. On Satur
day, Lorraine struck out a career
high nine while walking only two,
and on the season, Lorraine has
walked only seven in 28 innings of
work.
"That's not a surprise any
more," Marquess said. "Andrew
showed in the fall that he had
worked on those problems. The key
to Andrew's game is his control."
While Lorraine was coasting
through the early innings, Stan
ford provided him with nine runs in
the first three frames.
Shortstop Todd Laßocca con
nected for his second home run of
the season in the third inning, giv
ing the Cardinal a commanding 8-0
lead.
Hinch drove in a pair with a cou
ple of sacrifice flies, and first base
man Dusty Allen collected three
RBl's on a double and a single.
Weather conditions permitting,
Stanford and Santa Clara will
square off today at Buck Shaw Sta

dium at 2 p.m. to make up for yes
terday's rainout. Dan Reed, who
has allowed no earned runs in 15
innings, will start today for Stan
ford.

Catcher Jimmy Noriega and the Cardinal baseball team downed Santa Clara in a doubleheader on Saturday.
Mother Nature proved to be
tougher competition than Santa

Clara for the Cardinal baseball
squad this weekend.
No. 10 Stanford (10-2) swept a
rain-shortened series 8-2 and 10-1
from the Broncos (5-6-1), stretch

ing their winning streak to seven
games.
Friday's game at Sunken Dia
mond was postponed because of
the weather, as was yesterday's

game at Buck Shaw Stadium in
Santa Clara.
The two clubs did manage to
play both games of a doubleheader
at Stanford on Saturday — much
to Santa Clara's dismay. The Bron
cos looked absolutely helpless
against both ends of Stanford's
righty-lefty tandem of Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine.
"They're both throwing awfully
well," said coach Mark Marquess
of his top two starters. "There
might be some other guys out
there who are as good, but I
wouldn't want to trade [Adams
and Lorraine] for anyone else at
this point."
In the opener, Adams (3-0) scat
tered four singles in racking up his
second consecutive complete game.
Indeed, the only question that
remains about the junior right
hander entering Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division play next
weekend is, will he ever lose?
Adams, last week's Six-Pac Pitcher
of the Week, baffled Santa Clara
batsmen all day, striking out 10
and lowering his eamed-run aver
age to 1.45.
Stanford opened up scoring in
the third, picking up three runs on
a single hit. Sean Madden and
Todd Laßocca began the inning
with walks.
With one out, catcher A.J.
Hinch brought in both runners,
belting a Bob Pailthorpe fastball to
the wall in left field. Hinch, who
had missed the first five games of
the Cardinal winning streak for
personal reasons, started both
games of the doubleheader.
In the sixth, the Cardinal
extended its lead to four runs.
With one out, freshman Brodie
VanWagenen doubled down the
left-field line. On the next pitch,
Brian Dallimore belted another
double to left, driving in VanWage
nen. A Madden single through the
third-base hole made the score 6-2.
Madden picked up another RBI
in Game 2, and appears to have

won the interim starting position
in left field with regular Nate Olm
stead hampered by a sprained
ankle. Madden, who hit the game
winning home run in Tuesday's
contest against Cal State-Los
Angeles, has started in left for four
consecutive games.
The wind and rain picked up
during the second game of the
afternoon, shortening the contest
to seven innings.
Lorraine (3-0) seemed unfazed
by the miserable conditions,
notching his second complete
game in a row. The southpaw con
tinued his dominance of left-hand
ed batters, whiffing Bronco lefties
Mike Crisafulli and Tommy
Thompson three times in four offi
cial at-bats.
Lorraine's biggest question
mark entering the season con
cerned his control problems of the
past — he had walked 32 batters
in 45 career innings coming into
this campaign.
Thus far, the junior has
silenced those doubts. On Satur
day, Lorraine struck out a career
high nine while walking only two,
and on the season, Lorraine has
walked only seven in 28 innings of
work.
"That's not a surprise any
more," Marquess said. "Andrew
showed in the fall that he had
worked on those problems. The key
to Andrew's game is his control."
While Lorraine was coasting
through the early innings, Stan
ford provided him with nine runs in
the first three frames.
Shortstop Todd Laßocca con
nected for his second home run of
the season in the third inning, giv
ing the Cardinal a commanding 8-0
lead.
Hinch drove in a pair with a cou
ple of sacrifice flies, and first base
man Dusty Allen collected three
RBl's on a double and a single.
Weather conditions permitting,
Stanford and Santa Clara will
square off today at Buck Shaw Sta

dium at 2 p.m. to make up for yes
terday's rainout. Dan Reed, who
has allowed no earned runs in 15
innings, will start today for Stan
ford.
