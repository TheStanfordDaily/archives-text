# Women's gymnastics loses to Washington in high-scoring meet
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
Although the Stanford women's gym
nastics team came away from two meets in
Seattle this weekend with only a 1-1
record, it had its two highest scores of the
year, losing 191.70 - 190.85 to the Wash
ington Huskies Friday night, and beating'
the Seattle Pacific Falcons 190.25 - 189.10
on Saturday.
Against Pacific 10 Conference foe
Washington (6-5 overall), Stanford (5-3)
turned in its first 190-plus score of the sea
son. The Cardinal was led by freshman
Hillary Anderson, who finished second in
the all-around competition with a mark of
38.15, and by sophomores Meegan Lannin
and Katie Clancy, who each turned in
excellent three-event performances.
Head coach Breck Greenwood gave the
team's improved vaulting performance
much of the credit for the jump in Stan

ford's team score against the Huskies. The
Cardinal's score of 47.05 was easily the
squad's best mark of the year on the appa
ratus.
Clancy led the team with a 9.65, Lannin
turned in a 9.55 and sophomore Jenny
Ward scored 9.45.
Curiously, it was the balance beam that
caiiSfecJ thfe 4 trouble for the' Cardinal.
Clancy scored a meet-high 9.80, but three
gymnasts fell off the apparatus, and the
squad scored only a 47.40. Greenwood said
that the scores were deceiving.
"We looked really good on beam, but we
had some falls," he explained, adding, "If
we hit beam, we win the meet."
But Greenwood was pleased with Stan
ford's uneven bars and floor performances,
which scored 48.15 and 48.25, respectively.
Anderson led the squad with a 9.80 on
bars, followed by Lannin with a personal
best 9.75. Sophomore All-American Jen 6
Elzie, hampered by a strained Achilles ten-

don, added a 9.70 in her only event.
Stanford continued its season-long mas
tery on floor. Sophomore Tina Snowden
exploded for a meet-high and personal-best
9.85; Anderson and Lannin also had
superb performances, Anderson with a
9.75 and Lannin with a personal-best 9.70.
Although the Cardinal scored well on
bars and "floor, it was on these two rota
tions that the Huskies took the meet.
Washington scored a 48.30 on bars and a
phenomenal 48.85 on floor.
Greenwood said the traditionally high
scoring in Washington partly accounted
for the Huskies' margin of victory.
"The scoring was unbelievable," he said.
"One of their girls did a really average floor
routine and scored 9.85. If that was a 9.85,
then Tina's was a 10.40."
Greenwood added that, with different
judges, the Cardinal could beat Washing
ton. "We'll slam dunk them at Pac-lOs (to
be held at Stanford)."

Overall, the meet was a success.
"Not having Jene certainly made a big
difference," Greenwood said, adding that a
healthy Elzie could have added as much as
1.50 points to the Cardinal's score, "but the
people that came in for Jene did great. We
showed some depth, which is new for us."
Greenwood addcxl that the thought of
competing again in 24 hours didn't faze the
Cardinal.
"Right after the meet, they wanted to
compete again," he said.
They had to wait a day, but against the
Falcons, Stanfor d had outstanding team
performances in bars, beam and floor.
Anderson won the all-around competition
with a season-high total of 38.45 and won
or shared three event titles.
Greenwood was especially ecstatic
about her 9.85 performance on bars.
"That was the best bar routine in Stan
ford's history," he said. "I don't know what
the judges deducted for."

Fellow freshman Linda Chun shared
the beam title with Anderson, earning a
season-high 9.80, helping Stanford to a
47.90 team score.
Seattle Pacific took advantage of anoth
er mediocre vaulting performance by Stan
ford (46.25) to hold a slight lead through
the bars competition, but the Cardinal
turned it on in the last two events, clinch
ing the competition with a team 48.00 on
floor.
Anderson led the squad with a 9.80, and
junior Mollie Brown and Snowden each
scored 9.75 for the Cardinal. Snowden's
two-day effort earned praise from Green
wood.
"Tina... had a great weekend," he said.
"She has added difficulty recently, and she
handled it well."
The Cardinal will be back in action Fri
day night as they travel to Tucson to face
Oregon State and Arizona in a three-way
meet.

squad scored only a 47.40. Greenwood said
that the scores were deceiving.
"We looked really good on beam, but we
had some falls," he explained, adding, "If
we hit beam, we win the meet."
But Greenwood was pleased with Stan
ford's uneven bars and floor performances,
which scored 48.15 and 48.25, respectively.
Anderson led the squad with a 9.80 on
bars, followed by Lannin with a personal
best 9.75. Sophomore All-American Jen 6
Elzie, hampered by a strained Achilles ten-

don, added a 9.70 in her only event.
Stanford continued its season-long mas
tery on floor. Sophomore Tina Snowden
exploded for a meet-high and personal-best
9.85; Anderson and Lannin also had
superb performances, Anderson with a
9.75 and Lannin with a personal-best 9.70.
Although the Cardinal scored well on
bars and "floor, it was on these two rota
tions that the Huskies took the meet.
Washington scored a 48.30 on bars and a
phenomenal 48.85 on floor.
Greenwood said the traditionally high
scoring in Washington partly accounted
for the Huskies' margin of victory.
"The scoring was unbelievable," he said.
"One of their girls did a really average floor
routine and scored 9.85. If that was a 9.85,
then Tina's was a 10.40."
Greenwood added that, with different
judges, the Cardinal could beat Washing
ton. "We'll slam dunk them at Pac-lOs (to
be held at Stanford)."

Overall, the meet was a success.
"Not having Jene certainly made a big
difference," Greenwood said, adding that a
healthy Elzie could have added as much as
1.50 points to the Cardinal's score, "but the
people that came in for Jene did great. We
showed some depth, which is new for us."
Greenwood addcxl that the thought of
competing again in 24 hours didn't faze the
Cardinal.
"Right after the meet, they wanted to
compete again," he said.
They had to wait a day, but against the
Falcons, Stanfor d had outstanding team
performances in bars, beam and floor.
Anderson won the all-around competition
with a season-high total of 38.45 and won
or shared three event titles.
Greenwood was especially ecstatic
about her 9.85 performance on bars.
"That was the best bar routine in Stan
ford's history," he said. "I don't know what
the judges deducted for."

Fellow freshman Linda Chun shared
the beam title with Anderson, earning a
season-high 9.80, helping Stanford to a
47.90 team score.
Seattle Pacific took advantage of anoth
er mediocre vaulting performance by Stan
ford (46.25) to hold a slight lead through
the bars competition, but the Cardinal
turned it on in the last two events, clinch
ing the competition with a team 48.00 on
floor.
Anderson led the squad with a 9.80, and
junior Mollie Brown and Snowden each
scored 9.75 for the Cardinal. Snowden's
two-day effort earned praise from Green
wood.
"Tina... had a great weekend," he said.
"She has added difficulty recently, and she
handled it well."
The Cardinal will be back in action Fri
day night as they travel to Tucson to face
Oregon State and Arizona in a three-way
meet.
