# Men spikers defeated soundly by Northridge
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
In a bullfight of a volleyball
match on Friday, the Matadors of
Cal State-Northridge were victori
ous over the inconsistent Cardinal,
15-10,14-16, 15-11,15-7. But Stan
ford (5-2, 4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) rebounded from
their first conference loss of the sea
son to defeat San Diego State last
night, 15-8, 5-15, 15-12, 15-6.
The Matadors (9-3, 4-2 MPSF)
had a three-pronged attack con
sisting of swing hitter Axel Hagar,
middle blocker Coley Kyman and
opposite hitter Ken Lynch. These
three combined for 82 kills, hitting
.523, .500 and .347, respectively,
and producing an attack that
never fell more than two points
behind all match.
Statistically, the most notice
able Cardinal flaw was a lack of
blocking defense. The squad start
ed with seniors John Bezmalinovic
and John Hribar at middle blocker,
then substituted in Joe Burghardt,
Brian Garrett and Mike Lambert,
as the starting two failed to block
effectively. The substitutions
added more offense, as the three
subs produced 24 kills, but were
unable to provide the defense
needed to slow down the Mata
dors' high-powered trio.
"I thought our blocking defense
was very poor," said Stanford
coach Ruben Nieves. "We didn't
get the job done — I can't think of
a guy who blocked well."
All four games in the match
were marked by the consistent
play of the Matadors and streaky
play of the Cardinal. In the first
game, Northridge quickly took a
13-3 lead behind the play of Lynch
and middle blocker Peter Piexoto,
as Stanford's passing was erratic.
David Fischer substituted for Bob
Hillman and jumpstarted the Car
dinal with his passing and net play

as Stanford roared back to a 10-14
mark. Finally, Craig Hewitt stop
ped the Matador bloodshed with a
powerful kill for the win.
The second game was a tremen
dous offensive show. There was lit
tle defense in this run-and-gun dis
play, as the teams combined to hit
an incredible .512 with 82 kills.
Hagar was unstoppable for the
Matadors, while Dave Goss was
steady on the other side of the net,
hitting .333 with 32 kills on the
night. Bob Hillman atoned for ear
lier sloppy play by hitting 1.000
with 13 kills in the second match.
Northridge had battled to a 14-
12 lead when the Cardinal brought
the crowd of 800 to its feet with an
improbable Hillman dig that
speared into the net, then bounced
off Ryan Moos' hand to become a
spike that kept Stanford alive.
The third game stayed close,
until the score was knotted at
eight, when the Cardinal was
unable to answer the combined
play of Hagar and Kyman, and lost
15-11. The fourth game was more
of the same from the Stanford side
as the Cardinal fell 15-7. The only
particularly notable event was a
sprained ankle by Hillman that
will keep him out of tonight's game
against UC-San Diego.
Assessments of Stanford's fail
ings came from all sides, from
CSUN's coach John Price's state
ment that the Cardinal was "flat"
to Garrett's judgment that Stan
ford was "soft." Ceman summed
up the evening by saying, "We
played up and down, which is what
we expected them to do."
The Cardinal lineup had a new
look against San Diego State. With
Hillman injured, multi-purpose
Ceman moved to swing hitter and
Jimmy Blackman started at setter.
These changes, along with
Burghardt's replacement of Hrib
ar at middle blocker, produced a
clean victory.

Garrett's entrance helped seal
the outcome. With the Cardinal
down 12-9 in the third game, Gar
rett substituted in for Bezmali
novic and triggered the come
from-behind victory. He stayed in
for game four and performed effi

ciently, with five kills in five
attempts.
Tonight Stanford concludes their
San Diego road trip with a match
against UCSD. The Tritons bring
up the rear in the Pacific Division of
the MPSF with an 0-5 record.
