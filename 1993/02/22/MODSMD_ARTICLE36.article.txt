# No.15 men's gymnastics upsets No.4 Brigham Young
## Strong performance on parallel bars keys victory 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
It looked as if Brigham Young actually had a shot
at defeating the Stanford men's gymnastics team.
But when the Cardinal stepped up to the parallel
bars in Saturday night's home meet, it was clear how
it earned the title of nation's-best last year.
With each of the six parallel-bar competitors
earning a 9.20 or above, 15th-ranked Stanford dom
inated the event and finished the meet to defeat N0.4
BYU 281.05-279.05. The Cardinal also racked up
wins over 14th-ranked Michigan and San Jose State
in the four-way competition.
"We missed early and fell behind right away, but
eventually pulled together for the victory," said
coach Sadao Hamada. Forced to alter the line-up
after expected all-around competitor Jing-Wei Liang
suffered a pulled muscle, Hamada found that the
last-minute changes worked to the team's advan
tage.
"Jing-Wei's injury was very good in a way because
the meet became very close and put the team in a
pressure situation," he said. "Much like last week,
they really felt the togetherness of the team."
This unity was partly inspired by senior co-cap
tain Jair Lynch's motivational words and strong all
around performance. He secured a first-place finish
in the all-around as well as the top spot on both the
pommel horse and the parallel bars.
Other meet highlights included sophomore Josh
Stein's floor and pommel horse routines, which mer
ited scores of 9.70 and 9.65, and junior Mark Booth's
all-around showing, despite.shaky performances on
the pommel horse and rings.
"This kind of meet is just what we're going to
need to see down the season," Lynch said. "We've
got to just get up there, do it and score 9.7 sand
9.85."

While this strategy may seem simple, the Cardi
nal's parallel-bar performance proved the method
successful. After Booth and senior Jeff Bender both
captured scores of 9.75, Lynch's 9.80 performance
pushed Stanford's overall apparatus score to 48.20,
slightly better than last week's high of 48.15.
Right before the team rotated to the high bar —
its last event — Hamada reminded the gymnasts to
be mentally tough and not to relax psychologically,
even though they had come through on the parallel
bars.
"I was a little afraid when we came to the high
bar, but they competed well under the pressure,"
Hamada said. He added that despite the meet-win
ning performance, "the guys are still throwing new
skills — we still have room to improve on the event."
Entering the last stretch of regular-season meets,
it might be assumed that the team's routines are
close to their final form. According to Lynch, this is
not necessarily the case.
"There is so much originality and difficulty on
this team that has yet to be unleashed," he said.
"Once we start throwing even more of our hidden
skills, no one is going to be able to beat us."
