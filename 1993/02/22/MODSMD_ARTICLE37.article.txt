# Swimmers blast away Cal, six pool records
## 
### Kay Hong Staff writer 
Six pool records were set last
weekend as the Cardinal men's
swim team downed California by
a score of 183.5-116.5 at Berke
ley's Spieker Aquatic Complex.
The lopsided victory wrapped up
Stanford's first undefeated dual
meet season since 1986.
After falling victim to a 1-2 Cal
finish in the 1650-yard freestyle,
the Cardinal rebounded quickly
as freshman Joe Hudepohl led
teammates Dan Kanner, Eric

Diehl and Clay Tippins in a first
through-fourth-place sweep of
the 200 free. Hudepohl's time of 1
minute, 36.40 seconds erased the
previous pool record of 1:36.67
set in 1985 and kicked off a string
of record-setting swims.
Cardinal junior Derek Weather
ford followed Hudepohl's perfor
mance with a pool record in the 100
backstroke (48.18), breaking his
own two-year-old record by more
than a second. Weatherford also
reset the pool standard in the 200
back (1:46.29), while classmate
Tyler Mayfield posted yet another

pool record en route to victory in
the 100 breaststroke (54.93).
Sprinter Bill Schell notched
three wins for the Cardinal, fin
ishing first in the 50 free (20.56),
the 100 free (45.18) and swim
ming in the record-setting 4 x 100
free relay (Weatherford, Schell,
Erik Maurer, Hudepohl, 2:58.30).
Junior Trip Zedlitz also laid claim
to his specialty, the 200 individu
al medley (1:49.04), while class
mate Eddie Parenti smoked the
competition from an outside lane
in the 100 butterfly (49.06).
Other Cardinal first-place fin

ishes came from the diving squad
as James Edwards won the 1-
meter competition (315.60
points) and David Johns won the
3-meter competition (310.80)
Highlights for the Bears
included Martin Herrmann's pool
record in the 200 fly (1:46.46), and
freshman Kurt Eldridge's daily
double in winning both the 1650
free and 500 free. Senior Troy
Griffith, competing in his last
meet as a Bear, enjoyed his first
ever dual meet win in the 400 I.M.
Even with these successes, Cal
ifornia's dual meet record fell to
8-3 as Stanford put the wraps on
a perfect 8-0 season. "We swam
very well today, though it isn't
always evident from the competi
tion," said California coach Nort
Thornton. "We had a good meet. .
. We've had a few people out sick,
but that really wouldn't have
made any difference in the score."
Prior to the meet, Cardinal
coach Skip Kenney had his team
focus less on points and more on
"the five minutes before the race.
"We're concerned about every
one swimming their best events
to prepare for Pac-lOs," Kenney
said. "This meet was sort of a
dress rehearsal for that . . . .
We've got a streak going [at the
Pac-10 Championships] and no
one wants to be on a team that
ends that streak."
Actually, the Cardinal seems to
have more of a dynasty going and
less of a streak. The Cardinal men
have not lost the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship in 11 years.
"This year is going to be a little
different than most. . . . everyone
is going to be at full strength at
the meet, " Thornton said.
"Stanford definitely has a
chance to run away with the
championship. I think the battle
will be for second place."
