# Schedule 'fuller than ever':
## 'Herstory' celebration begins 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
This year's Women's Herstory Celebration,
which began yesterday, has been described by
Women's Center Director Rebecca Bliss as "defi
nitely the biggest 'herstory' production ever."
The annual event, which was only a week long in
previous years, has been extended by another
seven days — through March 5 — with a schedule
that is fuller than ever, according to Bliss.
The event will also see the return — after a two
year hiatus — of "Take Back the Night," a nighttime
march through campus to promote empowerment
and awareness of issues regarding sexual assault.

Organizers are hopeful that the broad range of
events offered will include each individual in the
Stanford community.
"This year's 'herstory' is not constrained to any
kind of theme," said organizer Michelle Friedland,
a senior. The celebration instead emphasizes "a di
verse range of events," she said, "just as there are
many aspects to feminism."
Bliss said the 10 to 15 core organizers worked
hard to incorporate the many different "faces and ex
periences" of Stanford women into the celebration.
"We've made an effort to really connect with dif
ferent populations on campus . . . different
women's communities on cam
pus," said Bliss.
"The hope is that whatever
experience you have at Stanford,
you'll be able to look through this
(schedule of events) and find at
least one thing that you can con
nect with," Bliss said.
The phrase chosen to adorn
the event's t-shirt, "From differ
ent paths voices coming together
to be heard," captures this sense
of diversity, said Friedland.
Although the celebration
includes one to three events each
day, a few key programs may
attract special attention:
The "Take Back The Night"
march, co-sponsored by the Women
Defending Ourselves Collective,
"may be the event that reaches the

most people," said Bliss, adding
that she hopes it will "never again
cease to be an annual event."
"Traditionally, the march sym
bolizes that the streets are not
safe for women after dark,"
Friedland said.
Organizers said they hope both
men and women will participate.
Other events featured in the
celebration include a film screen
ing of the award-winning docu
mentary "When Abortion was Ille
gal: Untold Story," presented by
Stanford alumna and filmmaker
Dorothy Fadiman, as well as a
speech by Starhawk, a feminist,
peace activist and witch, who will
discuss the integration of earth
consciousness and spirituality.
In addition to the speakers and
presentations, the event includes
opportunities, such as discussions
and workshops, for students to
become actively involved in the fem
inist celebration, organizers said.
