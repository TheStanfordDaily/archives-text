# Dream 'Cello

### Denise Levertov 
Wken lie improvised, from what
unpremeditated congeries of wisdom
dici the sounds appear, woven
like laser tracings on tke screen of air?
Music out of 'nowhere,' that granary,
that palace of Arabian serpents,
of sleek rats plush as
young seals. What do words, too,
do there, the real ones,
while we dally with their pale
understudies, or swim
through choppy floods, too husy
with breathing to summon them?
Could we live there? Is it dark?
Could the grain shoals
not light us with their gold sheen?
Invisible hive, has it no small door
we could find if we stood
quite still and listened?


Klrsten Rhodes - Dally
