Charges were reduced Friday
against the two brothers accused
of conspiring to murder Assoc.
Psychiatry Prof. Saul Wasserman
and his wife.
New evidence, including video
taped interviews in Israel with ac
quaintances of the defendants,
prompted Santa Clara County
prosecutor Tom Farris to lower the
charges against American-born Is
raelis Austin and Scott Feld. Ini
tially charged with conspiring to
murder and burglarize the Wasser
mans, the brothers now only face
the burglary charges.
Bail was lowered from $500,000
to $100,000, and the Felds will be
allowed to return home to Israel.
The investigation will continue
until a new trial convenes May
10. A pre-trial hearing is sched
uled for March 19.
Palo Alto police arrested the
Felds Nov. 19 in the parking lot
of a Safeway on Middlefield
Road after discovering ski
masks, flexible handcuffs,
knives, tape, gloves and nylons
in the trunk of their rental car.
Also discovered were drawn
maps of the interior of the
Wassermans' home, located less
than a half mile from the park
ing lot.
The Wassermans told police
after the arrest that their 22-
year-old daughter Rachel may
have sent the men.

Rachel Wasserman, who has
been under psychiatric care
since 1989 and is currently
studying at a religious school in
Israel, has previously accused
her parents of sexually abusing
her and has threatened to kill
them. She met Austin Feld while
applying to volunteer at a social
service agency he runs for trou
bled youth in Israel.

retracting some of Rachel
Wasserman's claims against her
parents.
The decision came after sever
al weeks of behind-the-scenes
