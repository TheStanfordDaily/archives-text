# 'A voice of experience'
## Former Bush aide Jack Kemp named a Hoover visiting fellow 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban
development under former President George
Bush, yesterday accepted an appointment as a
Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
Hoover Deputy Director Charles Palm said
Kemp will not be in residence at Stanford. His
appointment will last one year.
Kemp will "visit Hoover from time to time,
meet with other fellows and students, if they
are interested, and give talks," Palm said.

"Like anyone who's had significant public
policy experience, he will talk to other fellows
about how public policy is carried out in a large
government agency," Palm said.
Currently, Kemp is a member of the Her
itage Foundation, a conservative think tank in
Washington, D.C. He is widely considered a
leading candidate for the Republican Party's
presidential nomination in 1996.
"He is a man who has thought carefully
about political issues of many kinds," Palm
said. "His knowledge will be useful to our un
derstanding of public policy issues."
Hoover Assoc. Director Richard Sousa said

Kemp "will add a voice of experience on what
happened in Washington over the last 12 years."
Sousa added that Kemp will be in familiar
company at Hoover. "He has good relation
ships with a number of other fellows," he said.
Kemp was offered the position in January,
when the Bush administration left office, Palm
said. Although other Bush administration offi
cials have been contacted for possible appoint
ments at Hoover, Palm would not specify who
else may be named to fellowships.
A former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills,
Kemp was a congressman from
New York before being named to
HUD. While there, Kemp was an
advocate of "enterprise zones,"
which sought to give citizens liv
ing in inner cities increased prop
erty rights.

He was especially vocal during
the Los Angeles riots last spring,
claiming the unrest was partly
due to the failure of many tradi
tional government social pro
grams.
Sousa said he doesn't "expect a
long-term relationship between
Kemp and the institution." Palm
said Kemp's term as a Hoover fel
low may be extended "if there is
mutual interest to do so."
