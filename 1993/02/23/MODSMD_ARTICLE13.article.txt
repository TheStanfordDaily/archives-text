THE ONE THING Stanford
students don't have time for
is waiting.
However, the scene at Tresid
der's computer cluster lately has
been one of students circling the
area like hawks, looking for any
sign of an opening at a terminal.
This high-stakes game of musical
chairs has been caused by a
decreased supply of computers due
to breakdowns of aging equip
ment, much of which needs to be
replaced.
The budget for the cluster has
been reduced by 15 percent each of
the past two years as part of the
University-wide cuts, and there is
virtually no money to purchase
new equipment.
Despite the budget shortfall,
the Library and Information
Resources department, under
which the cluster's budget oper
ates, must make it one of its top

priorities to find funding for the
LaIR, whether it is from its bud
get, donations or reallocated Uni
versity funds. Money must be allo
cated now to help replace the com
puters.
This reduction at Tresidder,
coupled with the increasing
crowds at dorm computer clusters,
has created a crunch on available
computers.
If this trend continues, as the
LaIR equipment ages, students
will feel compelled to buy their
own computers so as to ensure
that one is always available, an
expensive solution to an easily
solved problem.
The University should quickly
realize that if students are willing
to suffer through painful budget
cuts which reduce the services
available to them, the least it can
do is try to mitigate the most
painful of these.
