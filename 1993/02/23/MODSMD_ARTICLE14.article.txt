AS WINTER QUARTER
begins to wind down, several
students across campus are
opening their textbooks for the
first time and saying to them
selves, "Why in the world did I buy
this book?"
And the saga only worsens when
they try to sell the book back to the
Bookstore. After approaching the
sell-back window, their hearts sink
when told they can receive only a
small fraction of what they origi
nally paid.
Other students take a different
route, posting "for sale" flyers at
the beginning of each quarter in an
attempt to recoup some of their
losses. However, this is a messy
and oftentimes unproductive pro
cess, and students who are looking
for used books often never find
them.
For this reason, a non-profit,
computerized book exchange
should be established. The ASSU
could take charge of the effort,

which would cost little money but
would reap great benefits for stu
dents. Anyone who wanted to sell
a book could enter it into a data
bank along with their name,
phone number, the class the book
is for and the amount they would
like for it. The system would be
organized both by class and by
title. Interested students could
enter either the class or book title
and quickly see who's selling it
and at what price.
The system would work best if it
were integrated onto the Forsythe
network so students could log on
from all over campus. If this is not
possible, though, computers should
be set up at the ASSU office and
various other spots during the first
few weeks of the quarter, so that
students can take maximum
advantage of the new system.
After all, how many big, glossy
CIV books can one person put on
his or her coffee table once he or
she graduates?
