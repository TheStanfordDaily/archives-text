## Ice-T: an artist for the '90s 
### 
OK, I ADMIT IT. I had no respect
for Ice-T before Saturday night.
Maybe it was the fact that he
wrote a song about killing his mother
with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat.
I'm not quite sure.
"A Conversation with Ice-T" was the
title of the talk. I laughed when I heard it.
I figured having a conversation with Ice-
T would be about as likely as having a
"snack" with Roseanne Arnold.
"Blaspheming with Ice-T," or maybe
"Exploring the Bounds of Linguistic
Decency with Ice-T," I thought, would be
a more appropriate title for the speech.
But I still had to go, if only for the child
ish thrill of hearing profanities over the
auditorium microphone.
No, I didn't go to the speech out of any
great respect for Ice-T's artwork. I didn't
even go for the inevitable discussion of
First-Amendment rights. Everyone rec
ognizes Ice-T's right to make "Cop Killer"
— everyone, that is, except those who
think you should go to prison for lighting
a red-and-white-striped cloth on fire.
No, my 500 friends and I went to hear
him because he raps about killing police
men. We went for the same reason we
went to see the Naked Guy or would flock
to see Madonna. We went because he's an
individual doing — to borrow a phrase
from Ice-T — whatever the 1- - - he wants.
But we got more than we bargained
for on Saturday night. Amidst the expect-

Ed references to George Bush's rear end,
something became clear. And it was
something I wasn't prepared for: Ice-T is
a philosopher. Sure, he's no Kant. Kant,
for instance, didn't name himself after a
local pimp. But then Kant never lived in
Compton, either.
Ice-T is a philosopher of the 19905. He
said he's been called "the Bob Dylan of
rap." And it's not because he's an unin
telligible, drugged-out, waning star,
either. It's because he's recreating the
life of the city in his music. There's a
word for it, I'm pretty sure. Oh yeah, it's
"art."
And he's an artist in the best sense of
the word. He's not disrobing himself to
the exact point of social acceptability (see
Marky Mark for details), changing his
image to fit the current market demand
and calling it "self-expression."
Instead, he's going around to colleges
and giving talks on the problems of the
cities. Of course, if I was paid $6,500 to
do so, I'd be willing to talk about the
cities, too. I'd talk about the mating
habits of dachshunds for that money, but
that's not the point.
The point is that Ice-T is one of the
few big stars — he does have some com
pany — going to such lengths to make a
political statement. And he made his
statement in an unconventional manner
for a celebrity these days. His speech was
characterized by humility, generosity (he

spoke for three hours and gave someone a
summer internship) and honesty.
Those are rare qualities; just ask
Michael Jordan, Cher or Christian Laet
tner.
For some reason, though, Ice-T isn't
getting the respect he deserves (I suspect
it has something to do with his being
named after a summertime beverage).
This newspaper, among other sources,
has criticized the ASSU of "anti-intellec
tualism" for bringing Ice-T to campus.
Maybe they're confusing "anti-intellectu
alism" with "interesting and fun." The
two aren't mutually exclusive, you know.
Ice-T spoke about what's important to
him, and he did it in a way everyone could
respect, even cops.
I'm ready to be anti-intellectual, I
guess, if it means respecting artistic
integrity, discussing social issues and
hey, why not, even enjoying myself.
Screw the midnight oil, give me "Cop
Killer."

John Ford does not, through his criticism
of Michael Jordan, Cher and Christian
Laettner, mean to imply that he dislikes
the Chicago Bulls, Sonny Bono or Duke
University. OK, maybe Duke.
