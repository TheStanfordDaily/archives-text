Student courier is solution for post office's slowness

Everybody is always harping
about how bad the post office is,
about how long it takes to get
your mail and about how you have to
camp out just to mail a package . . .
well, there's no doubt about it, the post
office sucks. However, I think that I
have the solution to at least part of the
problem.
Before I begin explaining my solu
tion, I would like to digress and discuss
some of my observations about the post
office and life during this, my first year
at Stanford. Here goes: One must
expect to bring a sleeping bag when
desiring to mail a package (driving to
the Palo Alto post office saves time).
Mail sent from a blue box in front of
the post office to an on-campus P.O.
box goes to somewhere in San Francis
co and back before it returns within

100 feet of the original mailing box. A
package sent from the library to my
box (with needed documents inside)
took five days.
The aisles with P.O. boxes are
dank and cold like graves. Yesterday, I
received my application for next year
and noticed that it cost $1.21 to send.
I have also received about four other
letters from the Financial Aids Office
at $.29 each (that's a total of $2.37 so
far this year). If 63 percent of stu
dents receive financial aid, and all
receive semi-similar mailings, then
the Financial Aids Office is spending a
total of $20,156.85 on these mailings
alone (assuming 63 percent of 13,500
students). This is just one office on
campus.
OK, the solution: I propose the cre
ation of a new student job. This posi-

tion entails the moving of campus mail
(from a new "campus mail only" box)
to student and faculty boxes. That's it.
Good things from this plan: 1) Many
offices around campus save money. For
instance, the Financial Aids Office
saves $20,156.85 and now can maybe
give me TWO dollars. 2) Less post
office staff needed for delivery purpos
es, so perhaps they might be able to
staff one of the ever-idle counters and
reduce waiting time. 3) Some kid gets a
new job that pays for itself in the first
day. 4) Campus mail might take one
day to be delivered. Finally, 5) People
will be happy and world peace will
ensue.
Assuming that my numbers even
vaguely resemble reality, this plan is
beneficial (even just for the mail
speed and line-reduction issues). Am

I too idealistic to believe that the
post office will allow a non-govern
ment worker in on its furtive work
ings and most secret niches? That the
post office will agree to something
that actually facilitates student
needs? That the Financial Aids Office
wants to save money? That a letter to
The Daily can change bureaucracy?
That administrators will listen to a
greasy-haired, pimple-faced kid who
believes that his tuition pays the bills
and that his needs should be attend
ed to especially if the answer is as
simple as adding one (or even two)
new student jobs?
I invite responses from anyone,
especially those who have the ability to
make this change.
