# Stanford parking woes require global change, destruction of bollards
## 
### 
I have a few suggestions for the peo
ple in Parking and Transportation pro
grams and in the new parking-related
focus groups.
First, change the apparent land-use
policy wherein, given an open field on
one side, a paved parking lot on the
other, with utility access in between,
Stanford will site a new building on the
parking lot.
Second, with somewhere between
6,000 and 8,000 acres in its immediate
sphere, I see plenty of space for incre
mental increases in parking at very
small cost.
For example, give me $500 to rent a
small loader so I can tear out a few
hundred bollards along Campus Drive
and I could provide thousands of park
ing spaces in areas used for game/stadi

um parking, with just a few hours of
work. These areas were used for park
ing for decades, before the 19705. This
would be parking for free, as was pro
vided by the University until the mid
-708, when some enterprising, empire
building individual convinced the
administration to create a parking
bureaucracy.
'Til then, people didn't demand
paving and lighting. Maybe too many
weenies from Cal started to work here?
Once you had to pay, of course you
wanted paving, lighting, shuttles, etc.
This was an early incarnation of the
prevalent marketing ploy of today,
"create a perception of a need, and
then fill it."
Third, change the policy wherein, at
every opportunity, central campus
roads are blocked. This forces those
who have to to drive (including Univer
sity vehicles) to often almost double
the distance driven to get from point A
to point B on campus. Remember one
of the basic formulas of the circle, that
circumference equals pi times the

diameter.
Most large campuses I have visited
(some smaller than Stanford) have
acknowledged the need for some
through routes for vehicles and have
one or two direct ways to get across
campus. They tend toward the radial
plan, rather than the circular plan of
movement. This could greatly reduce
the number of vehicle miles driven on
campus, helping cut pollution, the
amount of gas and oil consumed and
time wasted both for employees moving
to and from work and for employees
moving about campus in their work.
Though the goal of getting people
out of their cars is good in the long run,
the problem of there being too many
people in cars is global and Stanford
will not contribute to the goal, of less
ening this number by simply putting up
more stops, blocking more roads and
charging more for parking. Stanford's
policies simply change the local driver
into a frustrated, angered scofflaw.
