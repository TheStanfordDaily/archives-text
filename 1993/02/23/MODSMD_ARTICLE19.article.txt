# University must boost pay of own employees before Ranch workers
## 
### 
I agree with The Daily's Feb. 12 edi
torial stating that Webb Ranch should
give its workers a fair wage.
What the editorial omits, and would
give a greater understanding of the cause
of this issue, is stating for those who may
not know that the work force there is
primarily, if not exclusively, Latino.
I do not agree with the editorial, howev
er, that the University is in a moral posi
tion to persuade Webb Ranch to raise their
salaries, given the fact that the University
is not paying its staff of color fairly.
In the first instance, the lease with
the Webbs should be voided; in the sec
ond instance, those who have allowed
unfair salaries to be paid to staff of color
should also be voided.
