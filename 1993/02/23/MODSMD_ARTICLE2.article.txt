# Shedding light on real-world issues

It has meant simplifying structure,
shortening sentences and throwing out
beloved technical jargon.
But in crafting his monthly columns

Nobel Laureate
Gary Becker
links economic
principles with
social concerns

for Business Week
magazine, Gary
Becker, who won the
1992 Nobel Memori
al Prize in Econom
ics, has been willing
to run counter to the
basic norms of eco
nomic writing.
"The first couple

of sentences have to
contain all the power," said the Hoover
Institution senior fellow. "There's a
whole skill to doing it."
He appreciates the experience
though; for besides learning how to
write concisely, he also discovered that
"100 percent of economic ideas can be
put in a non-technical way."
This view of economics — as a sci
ence that can be applied to other fields

and to the real world, rather than as a
self-contained discipline — is the sort of
thinking that first focused attention on
Becker in the late 1950s and eventually
won him the Nobel Prize last October.
Becker's topics come from every
where, at all times. For instance, watch
ing the long lines of people waiting out
side Fish Market restaurant on El
Camino made him wonder how it is that
one restaurant, which serves similar
food at similar prices as others nearby,
should become so popular while others
remain empty.
He sought the answer, of course, in
economics. The result was an article en
titled "On Restaurant Pricing" that
looked at the demand curves for"in"
products to determine the answer to
this puzzling predicament.
Some would call such pieces a frivo
lous departure from academic econom
ics. But the Nobel Prize sitting in his
home has proven that Becker's work is
a recognized contribution to his field.
Praising Becker's ability to "shed
light on real world issues," economist
Michael Boskin called him "the most in

novative economist in the last half cen
tury." Boskin, a Stanford economist
who worked in the Bush administra
tion, was one of hundreds who nomi
nated Becker for the Nobel Prize.
Boskin separated Becker's notable
work into two categories: his theory
about "human capital" and his work
that borders on the edges on economics
and sociology.
While the concept of human capital
has been widely accepted by econo
mists, Becker's analyses of diverse soci
ological issues such as discrimination,
families, marriage and drug addiction
in economic terms have been rather
controversial.
For instance, his first book, "The
Economics of Discrimination," which
was published in 1957, looked at how
racism is influenced by market forces
and why blacks and whites of equal pro
ductivity earned different wages.
"It was the first real attempt to use
economic analysis on social issues,"
Becker said.


Garrison Tong — Daily
Hoover Fellow Gary Becker, who won the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, sits outside the Hoover Institution. Becker, who
won the prize for his theory on "human capital" and his work that blurs the borders between economics and sociology, spends winter
quarter at Stanford and the rest of the year at the University of Chicago, where he teaches economics.
But while Becker found the
overlap of fields natural, "It's
been harder for people in neigh
boring disciplines to accept," said
Kenneth Arrow, also a Nobel Lau
reate and Hoover fellow, because
some don't believe economic anal
ysis is applicable to their fields.
Even economists, such as Arrow
himself, have been critical of Beck
er's theories for relying too much
on economic factors because eco
nomics "can't explain everything."
But, Arrow added, Becker's
economic analyses are "certainly
provocative and a different way of
looking at things."
Winning the Nobel Prize has
always been a goal of his, Becker
said, because it would be the offi
cial recognition of his controver
sial work.
Of course, the $1 million prize
money was good too. But Becker
was quick to add that, after taxes,
the award was actually a little less
than $700,000.
The service during the week
long Nobel prize ceremony last
December was also a nice perk.
Becker and his family were chauf
feured everywhere by a limousine
escorted by a police car that would
clear all the traffic for them.
"For a week, we were treated like
the heads of state," Becker said.
The only problematic "Nobel
effect," Becker said, is that "peo
ple think you're an expert on
everything."

Offers came from around the
world asking for interviews and
lectures on every topic. "There
were demands from all types. I
turned down literally hundreds of
them," he said.
His secretary now has a file just
to store letters from eccentrics
and crazies. "They tell me they've
been persecuted for their ideas —
as if I could clear it all up."
The requests have been dying
down as time passes, which is for
tunate for Becker. Besides all the
speech requests he has accepted,
he also has to make time for his
appointment to a new state eco
nomic advisory board chaired by
Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George Shultz to advise Gov. Pete
Wilson.
The group met with the gover
nor for the first time last Wednes
day to speak about of the state's
problems, but Becker said he was
"not at liberty" to talk about the
details of the discussion.
He said some of the areas he
foresees the group looking into
are California's defense industry
and economic competition from
bordering states.
But before he can do much,
Becker said he will have to do
more research on California's
economy. He will also have to
spend more time in California.
Currently, Becker stays at
Hoover only during winter quarter.
The rest of the year, he teaches eco
nomics at the University of Chicago,
where he earned his doctorate in
economics and where he was taught
by fellow Nobel Laureate and
Hoover fellow Milton Friedman.
