## Booth aims for mix of strength, finesse 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Obviously, gymnastics requires an
incredible amount of strength. For junior
Mark Booth, the challenge of blending this
strength with his creative flair has kept the
sport exciting enough to stick with for more
than 10 years.
Booth's ability to mesh these two com
ponents has already helped lead the Stan
ford squad to one national championship
and will likely be on display at the NCAA
Tournament again this year.
"Gymnastics combines tremendous ath
leticism with artistic freedom," he said.
"You can use your own style and your own
type of presentation."
Cardinal coach Sadao Hamada, a 21-year
veteran of the program, described Booth as
"physically the most talented gymnast I
have ever seen. . . His body moves with nat
ural elegance. And as far as flexibility and
power, no one can come close to him."
Calling Booth a sensitive gymnast who
sometimes gets rattled by intense competi
tion, Hamada added that the Cardinal co
captain is still developing the mental tough
ness to complement his physical ability.
The sense of team camaraderie Booth
has found at Stanford has inspired him to
become more mentally focused in competi
tion.
"It was a culture shock when I came to
college because you are competing for a
team, although you still are an individual,"
he said. "It's that much extra pressure — if
I'm not going to do it for myself, I have to
do it for the team. That's basically where
the motivation is coming from."
Booth's gymnastics career began not as
a team player or even as an individual com
petitor, but instead as a spectator. When he
was five, he started tagging along to the
gym with his sister.
"I was there quite a bit so my mom just
decided to enroll me — I was kind of a
hyperactive kid and had a lot of energy any
way," he said. Relying on his natural abili
ty, he bypassed gymnastics classes and
immediately started on a club team in
Reno. By the age of eight*, Booth had
alr?sdy begun serjqys taping,
practicing as many as six hours a week.

From the outset, Booth knew gymnas
tics would dominate his life, although such
a commitment did not come without a cer
tain amount of introspection along the way.
"I've had to question myself. I think
almost any athlete has to a lot of times — is
it worth it, was it the right decision?" he
said.
Booth remembered one day playing bas
ketball with his friends when his mother
asked if he wanted to go to the gym.
"I think back now and say, 'What if I had
just stayed and played basketball?' It
wouldn't be like my life was ruined, but I
don't think it would be quite what it is
now," he said.
After deciding to stick with gymnastics,
Booth embarked on a rigorous training
schedule which prepared him for national
competition. At age 16, he became a mem
ber of the junior national team. This led to
the highlight of his early career, an all
around victory in the Pan American Games
during the summer after his senior year of
high school.
The decision to compete for the Cardinal
was a relatively easy one for Booth. After
meeting coach Hamada at a meet his junior
year, Booth's hopes for finding a college with
both top academics and a strong gymnastics
program were fulfilled.
"I fell in love with the school," he said. "I
didn't even visit it (because) I didn't have a
chance, but this was basically my first
choice."
Booth's enthusiasm propelled him
through a successful freshman year until
a broken ankle at the Western Regional
meet stopped him from competing in the
NCAA Championships. A second break in
September before his sophomore year
kept him from performing on the floor or
the vault. Now completely recovered,
Booth is one of Stanford's top-three all
around contenders.
He is striving for a top-six finish in this
year's NCAA all-around competition and
hopes he can use that momentum to build
towards the Olympics in 1996. After recent
ly making the decision to postpone dental
school in favor of training for the Olympics,
he plans to stay at Stanford after gradua
tion and continue under Hamada's instruc
tion.
