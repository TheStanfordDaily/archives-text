# Spikers beat UC-San Diego

### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Back to business as usual.
After a wrenching loss to Cal State-Northridge
on Friday, the Stanford men's volleyball team
returned to their usual dominating play last night,
blowing the UC-San Diego Tritons out of their
home waters 15-3, 15-4, 15-8.
Ironically, though, the Cardinal returned to their
winning ways with a host of new faces. The absence
of swing hitter Bob Hillman, who sprained his ankle
in Friday's match, brought All-American setter
Canyon Ceman to swing hitter and senior Jimmy
Blackman in as setter. While a setter's primary
responsibility is to set the various hitters and run
the offense, a swing hitter is most concerned with
passing the ball precisely so as to initiate the offen
sive play. According to head coach Ruben Nieves,
Ceman responded well to the change in responsibil
ities, and Blackman came off the bench to turn in a
good performance at setter.
The middle of Stanford's lineup was also shaken
up a bit. Sophomore Brian Garrett took John Bez
malinovic's spot as a starter, and he combined with
senior John Hribar to give the Cardinal an effective
quick attack. Garrett had nine kills and only one
error, hitting .615, while Hribar tied a career high
with 15 kills, hitting .429.
Garrett and Hribar also defended well, according
to Nieves. Although they only had four and three
blocks, respectively, they helped to hold UC-San
Diego to a meager .086 hitting percentage, while
Stanford was able to blast through the Triton's
defense to hit .449.
San Diego's squad, last in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation with a 0-8 league record and a 0-
14 record overall, was depleted by injuries. Only
able to suit up seven players, they had no answer for
another steady day for Cardinal opposite hitter
Dave Goss, who had 21 kills and hit .429.
The Cardinal's only apparent shortcoming was
its serving. With only three aces and 27 service
errors, the Stanford spikers fell well short of the
two-errors-for-one-ace standard Nieves set as a
standard for a productive serving match.
"Overall, the team played with intensity and
desire in both this match and the one against San
Diego State," said Nieves.
The Cardinal's next match is against Brigham
Young on Saturday in Provo, Utah. The next few days
should give Stanford time to rest their nagging
injuries — Hillman's ankle and senior Joe
Burghardt's back — for the challenge BYU should
provide. Ranked eighth in the Tachikara coaches poll,
the Cougars upset Northridge earlier in the season.
