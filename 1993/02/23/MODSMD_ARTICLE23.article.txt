# Why ask why? Men's, women's hoops should be different but equal
## 
### 
Last week, a respected Bay Area pub
lication did something that can only
be described as disrespectful.
In an apparent effort to raise reader
ship by the bootstraps of sensationalism,
the San Jose Mercury News sparked a
controversy of its own making.
In case you missed it, I am referring to
the paper's point-counterpoint on the rel
ative merits of men's and women's bas
ketball, a "study" that pitted a male
columnist fighting the yoke of chauvin
ism against a female pundit lauding
women for their mastery of the game's
fundamentals in lieu of certain physical
abilities.
To borrow the style of Denis Leary,
I've got three words for anyone who
found that bit of filler interesting: apples
and oranges. We've been down this road
before, but I'll spell it out again — men's
and women's basketball are different
games with different players, different
coaches and even different rules under
the authority of the NCAA. They cannot
be compared, reassessed or retransmitted
without the express written consent of a

rational mind — any violation of this rule
should be, in the words of Frank GifTord,
strrrrrictly prrrrohibited.
Located in an area where residents
tend to be liberal, particularly with
respect to issues of gender equality, the
Mercury News operated under the
assumption that men's and women's
hoops are equal. The sad reality for the
paper, however, is that they are not
equal, even in Stanford-Cal country,
where the women's teams often outshine
(not to mention outdraw) the men's
squads.
Let me take you back to the "dark
ages" of this basketball inequity, to April

4-5, 1992 and the NCAA Women's Final
Four in Los Angeles. I have made the
road trip with friends to watch our Cardi
nal team in action. After spending the
better portion of Friday evening in the
car, we unwind and get to bed by the rea
sonable hour of 12:30 a.m.; it's a good
thing we do, too, because the first semifi
nal (pitting Western Kentucky and
Southwest Missouri State) is slated for
9:30 a.m. Saturday, with the Stanford-
Virginia "marquee matchup" to follow at
noon.
A marquee matchup at noon?! Maybe
that played in Dodge City under
Wyatt Earp, but what in the name
of Dick Schultz is it doing in the age of
prime-time television? Ah, there's the
rub. The NCAA Executive Director and
his cronies have their hands tied by CBS'
seven-year, $1 billion television rights to
the men's tournament, and have no
choice but to listen to the network when it
dictates that "Semifinal Saturday" run
the women's games in the afternoon on
the East Coast so that the men's contests

can capture the lucrative prime-time
audience.
Stanford wins one of the most heart
stopping, nervewracking basketball
games I have ever witnessed, upsets the
No. 1 team in the nation and earns the
right to face Western Kentucky (for those
who were still eating brunch) the follow
ing afternoon in the final.
Yes, that's right, the following after
noon. The Cardinal makes the Hilltoppers
bottom out in their Sunday matinee and
takes its second NCAA crown in three sea
sons. But the women are "not-quite
ready-for-prime-time players," and they
don't even get to go live from New York on
a Saturday night. Can you imagine if they
had played the Duke-Michigan men's final
the day after the teams had defeated
Cincinnati and Indiana, respectively?
As this example brings into painstak
ingly plain light, there has to be a better
way. If the men's Final Four extends
beyond the weekend, why can't the
women's extravaganza take the Friday
before it? Imagine sitting back in 1994
and being able to watch women's semifi

nals on Friday night, not even bothering
to turn the dial before CBS' Late Night
with David Letterman comes on? Satur
day morning and afternoon would be
cleared, paving the way for the men's
semis that night. Sunday night would
belong to the women, and Monday would
still go to the men. The Final Four nights
of college hoops, celebrated in style.
The women's game is not lacking in
ability level, excitement or fan base; all it
needs at this point is exposure roughly
equivalent to the barrage of press the
men's game receives. Once this has been
achieved, the public will be educated
enough to distinguish between the two
brands of basketball and can decide for
itself which it likes best. Until then,
though, it is ludicrous and almost uneth
ical to mention men's and women's hoops
in the same story. Vive la difference!

Andy Eiser, pre-med and Daily sports
editor, arrived at Maples a minute before
halftime last Saturday and wondered
who performed the Heimlich maneuver
on the Cardinal men's team.
