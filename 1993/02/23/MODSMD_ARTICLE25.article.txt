### 
Last week was a good one for Stanford
basketball, as the men snapped a 10-game
losing streak with a 78-62 win over USC on
Saturday, and the women disposed of both
UCLA and Connecticut.
Freshman Dion Cross forged the way for
Stanford's uplifting victory over the Trojans
by tallying 15 points, four rebounds and
three assists in the contest. It was the first of

Cross' three three-pointers that put Stan
ford ahead 10-7, and the team never relin
quished its lead.
His outstanding performance on Satur
day was by no means a flash in the pan.
Cross has established himself as a scoring
force to be reckoned with in his first season.
The 6-foot-2, 175-pound guard from Little
Rock, Ark. has started the last six games for
Stanford, and has averaged an impressive
16.8 points per game during that time span.
His latest showing only reinforces the key
role he has come to play for the Stanford
squad this year. Cross is averaging 9.7 ppg on
the season, and it may not be a coincidence
that this is the highest mark attained by a
freshman since Todd Lichti's debut in '85-'B6.

Sophomore Rachel Hemmer had the
opportunity to shine in front of a national
television audience in the Connecticut game
on Saturday, and she rose to the occasion.
Scoring in double figures for the third
straight time, she contributed 12 points to
the Cardinal's 68-54 victory.
It was the 6-foot-3 forward's performance
against UCLA on Thursday, however, that
earned her the most attention. Hemmer shot
6-for-8 from the field and added three free
throws for a team-leading 15 points. She also
contributed on the defensive end of the
court, pulling down seven rebounds.
Hemmer scored the first basket in the
UCLA game and never looked back. Her

aggressive inside moves seemed to either
result in a basket or draw a foul. Midway
through the second half, she had consecutive
impressive plays, as she drove in hard for
two points on one possession and pulled out
a turnaround jumper on the next.
The native of Austin, Texas completed the
two games with 11-for-19 shooting and a 5-7
mark from the charity stripe.
