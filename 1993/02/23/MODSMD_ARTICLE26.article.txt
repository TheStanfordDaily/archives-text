# Santa Clara stops series shutout, shames Stanford in slugfest
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Santa Clara ended Stanford's seven
game winning streak with an exclama
tion point yesterday, trouncing the Car
dinal 13-2 and salvaging a win from the
schools' three-game series.
On Saturday, Stanford crushed the
Broncos in a Sunken Diamond double
header 8-2 and 10-1. Yesterday, Santa
Clara returned the favor in like fashion.
"We just got a real good whipping,"
said Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"[The Broncos] were able to put up the
big hits when they needed them."
On an afternoon every bit as gloomy
as the Cardinal's performance, Santa
Clara (6-6-1) reversed its fortunes after
being humiliated by Stanford (10-3) in
Saturday's twin bill.
The Cardinal sealed two earlier victo
ries over its local rival with early-inning
run production and excellent starting
pitching.
Yesterday, it was the Broncos' turn
to shine. Santa Clara scored early and
often, chalking up six runs in the first
two innings.
Stanford starter Dan Reed (2-1) took
the loss, giving up seven runs, all
earned, in five innings. Reed, who had a
0.00 ERA entering the game, got into
trouble in the second.
Reed retired Mike Helm and Bob
Pailthorpe on consecutive groundouts
to third baseman Brian Dallimore, and

worked the count to no balls and two
strikes on Chris Facione. Facione, how
ever, walked after fouling off several
pitches.
"Dan's a young pitcher, and he's learn
ing, M Marquess said. "You've got to come
up with a big pitch when you need it.
Today, he wasn't able to come up with it."

'We just got a real good
whipping. [The Broncos]
were able to put up the
big hits when they need
ed them.'

Indeed, Facione's walk opened the
Santa Clara floodgates. Light-hitting
Karl Thompson, who brought a .139
average into the game, tripled over the
head of Brodie VanWagenen to the wall
in right field, stretching the Bronco lead
to 2-0. Four consecutive singles by the
top of the Santa Clara lineup produced
four more runs.
The Broncos stretched their lead to
7-0 in the fifth on an RBI groundout by
Helm.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal offense was
stymied by the efforts of Santa Clara
starter Ryan Brust (2-0). While Brust

has a reputation for wildness — he holds
the Bronco career record for hit batsmen
with 30 — his control was not a factor
yesterday. The senior righthander held
the Cardinal to two runs and four hits in
eight strong innings.
"We hit a lot of balls right at their
fielders," Marquess said. "But Brust
was tough — we weren't able to do
much against him at all."
The Cardinal scraped together two
runs in the sixth, cutting the deficit to 7-
2. With Jed Hansen and Sean Carver
aboard via walks, JefTDesJardins picked
up his first hit of the year, lacing an RBI
single to right. Two batters later, Sean
Madden brought the Cardinal within
five with a single to center.
DesJardins, an infielder by trade, saw
time in right field after VanWagenen
strained a hamstring in the third inning.
VanWagenen's injury did not appear to
be serious, according to Marquess.
With the outcome of the game already
determined, Stanford center fielder Cale
Carter extended his hitting streak to 13
games with a ninth-inning single.
But with perennial rival San Jose
State coming to the Farm today, the Car
dinal will need more than a few scattered
hits to be effective. Last year, the Spar
tans defeated Stanford 7-6 at Sunken
Diamond thanks to a Kraig Constantino
grand slam in the ninth inning.
San Jose State, 5-3 and unranked,
has split its last 10 decisions with the
Cardinal.
