On the second day of his two
day whirlwind tour of Silicon Val
ley, President Clinton yesterday
toured a high-technology compa
ny in Mountain View as he pro
moted an economic agenda based
on technology and innovation.
A day after meeting with two
dozen area executives including
Stanford Board of Trustees Presi
dent John Freidenrich, Clinton
and Vice President Gore took an
early-morning tour of Silicon
Graphics, a company that grew
out of defense-related research
originally conducted at Stanford.
The firm has been touted as an ex
ample of a successful civilian con
version of a defense industry.
The company, considered by
many to be a firm of the future, of
fers its employees progressive
policies including flexible hours
and an employee sabbatical plan.
It produced the Academy Award
winning special effects for the
movie "Terminator II."
"I think the government ought
to work like you do," Clinton told a
group of workers after touring the
company's sprawling research
campus.
He used the occasion to an
nounce a national technology policy
that will bring more high-wage,
high-tech jobs to the West Coast and
pledge funds to retrain workers
moving from defense to civilian
work.
The plan will put about $550 mil
lion into the development of high
tech non-defense programs, such as
communications, computers and

environmental technology.
"Change is the way to make
money, not throw people out of
work," Clinton said. He told the
workers that the high-tech compa
nies of Silicon Valley have "made
change their friend."
Clinton said that $5 billion will
be spent over the next four years
to retrain workers and invest in
communities that have been hurt
by reduced defense spending —
many of which are in California.
"In order to revitalize our econ
omy, it is time for a dramatically
new approach that recognizes the
strength and potential of Ameri
ca's scientific and technological
resources to change and improve
the quality of our lives," he said.
Clinton and Gore also called for
increased government support for
new computer and communica
tions technology, increased fund
ing for national laboratories to
focus on civilian projects, greater
energy conservation in federal
buildings and more efficient
transportation programs.
Clinton, visibly impressed by
flashy graphics that greeted him
on computer screens throughout
the company, said he hoped his
policy would "create more compa
nies like [Silicon Graphics!."
In an attempt to forge even
stronger ties with the high-tech
valley, Clinton had dinner Sunday
night with two dozen of the area's
most prominent executives, in
cluding Freidenrich.
In an interview yesterday, Frei
denrich, a partner in the venture
capital firm Bay Partners, called
the informal, three-hour dinner at
a Los Gatos restaurant a "really
incredible experience."
"It was interesting to see the
enthusiasm in the group for the
president and his plan," he said.
"[Clinton] really has a keen inter
est in technology and in Silicon
Valley."
Labelled by many as a forum
for Clinton to garner high-profile
support for his economic plan, the
dinner provided the president a
chance to chat with local corpo
rate Goliaths such as Apple Com
puter CEO John Sculley and
Hewlett-Packard Chairman John
Young.
The recession and Clinton's
proposal for rejuvenating the
economy dominated the discus
sion, said Freidenrich. "People
were concerned with the econom
ic plans the president proposed —
will the administration be firm in
getting expenses reduced?"
At both yesterday's speech
before Silicon Graphics employ
ees and Sunday's dinner, Clinton
promised that he wouldn't pro
ceed with tax increases unless
spending cuts were also enacted.
Clinton also "spoke generally"
about his pledge to spend $550
million to aid in the transition to
civilian enterprises, said Freiden
rich.

Although Clinton's economic
plan calls for sharp cutbacks in
government spending and scaled
back defense industries, Freiden
rich predicted that Stanford's
research programs will emerge
relatively unscathed.
"There will be a shift in money,
but people will shift as well," he
said. "For example, the aerospace
industry will continue to be an
area where the government will
still be interested in research, and
we (at Stanford) are qualified to
do that."
Freidenrich also said that
Stanford stands to gain from
increased research spending in
medicine and biotechnology.
In a style typical of both Clin
ton and California, the dinner at
the "California Cafe" was decid
edly casual: Ties were optional,
Clinton and Gore wore polo shirts
and sport coats.
Freidenrich stressed that the
dinner was a welcome break from
past political gatherings, noting
that it went beyond political
rhetoric.
He praised Clinton's leader
ship style, mentioning how quick
ly the president developed a rap
port with the executives. "The
dialogue was going back and
forth.
"The president is a good listen
er," he said. "If someone made a
good point, he noted it down and
said he'd be in touch with them."
