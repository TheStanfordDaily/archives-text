find, we'll publish," he said.
He added that he expects to
complete the study and publish
the new results in four years.
Spiegel's current and previous
work will be examined in the third
segment of a five-part series nar
rated by Moyers on the connection
between the mind and the body.
Although Spiegel has been fea

said he considers the Moyers piece
the most thoroughly researched.
Even so, filming of his current
work did not interrupt the support
group sessions, which are free and
have about 20 members at any
given time. "I take the position
where, if the camera crew isn't

"These women are dealing
