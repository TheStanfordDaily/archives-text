# Stanford doctor to be featured in Bill Moyers TV special

Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel's
research into prolonging the lives
of cancer patients through support
groups will be featured tonight on a
Bill Moyers television documen
tary titled "Healing and the Mind:
Healing From Within."
The 90-minute program — half
of which is about Spiegel — inves
tigates how a positive mindset can
help patients battle disease. This
phenomenon has meant decades
of study for Spiegel — and has
probably added months to the
lives of his terminally ill patients.
In 1989 Spiegel published the re
sults of a landmark study claiming
that women afflicted with breast
cancer who participated in support
groups lived 18 months longer on
average than those who did not.
The study began in the late
1970s with research on a group of
women who attended weekly
meetings to confront their fears
about death and their illnesses.
Now, Spiegel is repeating the

study with the hope of further
substantiating the 1989 results.
Even if the new study yields a dif
ferent outcome, "whatever we
find, we'll publish," he said.
He added that he expects to
complete the study and publish
the new results in four years.
Spiegel's current and previous
work will be examined in the third
segment of a five-part series nar
rated by Moyers on the connection
between the mind and the body.
Although Spiegel has been fea
tured in other documentaries, he
said he considers the Moyers piece
the most thoroughly researched.
Even so, filming of his current
work did not interrupt the support
group sessions, which are free and
have about 20 members at any
given time. "I take the position
where, if the camera crew isn't
ready, tough," Spiegel said.
"These women are dealing
with very important issues in
their life. Those issues are more
important to them than the
camera crew," he said.
The support groups are unique
in that they are "expressive," that
is, they focus on helping people
confront their fears and death.
Spiegel added that he admires
the "no-nonsense" quality and
"directness" of the women in the
support groups, which are held at
Stanford.
Spiegel said one of the most
interesting research questions is
the interconnection between
mind and body.
Spiegel became interested in
this field when he was in resi
dence at Harvard University and
an asthmatic patient he was
treating would not respond to
medication. To help the patient,
Spiegel hypnotized her and kept
repeating, "Each breath you take
will be better and easier."
When the patient recovered
from her asthma attack and went
back to normal breathing, "I

thought, you know, this has got to
be something."
Later, while on a fellowship at
Harvard's office of community
psychiatry, he became interested
in self-help movements and tech
niques.
The program airs on KQED at
9 p.m. All five parts will be shown
Saturday at noon.
