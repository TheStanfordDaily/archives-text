# Famous leaders teach their craft in new 5-week class
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Leaders in war, peace and football will
come together to teach a course next quarter.
Stanford's Continuing Studies Program
will offer "Perspectives on Leadership" this
spring, taught by five of Stanford's best
known leaders, said Assoc. Dean of Contin
uing Studies Jeffrey Wachtel.
Lecturers in the five-week course will be
head football coach Bill Walsh, former vice
presidential candidate and Senior Hoover
Fellow James Stockdale, Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice, Prof. Emeritus and

SLAC Director Emeritus Wolfgang Panofsky
and former Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare and current Haas Centennial
Prof. John Gardner.
According to Hoover Fellow Gerald Dorf
man, the class' coordinator, the course is
being offered as an opportunity "to have
five very distinguished people talk about
their insights and experiences" as leaders.
The course will give participants the
chance to hear first-hand accounts of and
ask questions about, the lecturers' experi
ences in leadership positions.
Participants in the class will have the
unique opportunity to "get close and into

[these leaders'] psyches," Dorfman said.
Wachtel said that while these five people
are not the only "great leaders" at Stanford,
they were picked because of their recogniz
ability and variety of backgrounds.
The class, which will meet for two hours on
Wednesdays from April 7 to May 5, is one of
the many courses offered every quarter
through the Continuing Studies Program.
Wachtel said he hopes this course can be of
fered every quarter, with a different group of
lecturers.
The course is open to all members of the
local community — including students, fac
ulty and staff.

Enrollment in the class is on a first-come,
first-served basis. Wachtel said this also ap
plies to Stanford students, who have "to en
roll like any other adult in the community."
The course is separate from the standard
University curriculum, so credit from this
class only goes to those enrolled in the Con
tinuing Studies' master's in liberal arts pro
gram.
The cost to enroll in the one unit, pass/no
credit class is $120 plus a $25 registration
fee. However, there is a 20 percent discount
for students.
Participants will be required to write one
paper to receive credit.
