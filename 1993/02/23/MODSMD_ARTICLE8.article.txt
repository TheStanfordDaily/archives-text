King jury selected
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A jury,
including two blacks and a Hispanic,
was chosen yesterday to judge four
white police officers in the federal Rod
ney King beating trial after attorneys
clashed over racial motivations in select
ing jurors.
The last man seated, a young His
panic, said he knew little about the
case and had never seen the famed
videotape of the black motorist's beat
ing.
All of the other jurors said they had seen
the videotape. The panel includes a former
security guard and two ex-Marines.
The jury was composed of eight men
and four women. Six of the males and
three of the women are white.
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said
he would swear the 12 jurors and begin
the process of seeking three alternate
jurors after some pending legal hearings.
The jury that acquitted the officers on
most charges in an earlier state trial
included no blacks.

Both sides accepted the jury after a
last minute legal dispute over racial com
position of the jury.
Aid official ousted
WASHINGTON (AP) - The official
responsible for aid to the former Soviet
Union is being replaced after angering
his superiors by predicting the ouster of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
In announcing the replacement of
Richard Armitage as humanitarian aid
coordinator yesterday, State Depart
ment spokesman Joseph Snyder said the
decision was unrelated to remarks
Armitage made last week. He also said
Armitage's comments do not reflect
Clinton administration views.
Named to replace him was the cur
rent U.S. ambassador to Poland,
Thomas W. Simons, a former director of
the Office of Soviet Affairs at the State
Department.
In remarks last Tuesday Armitage pre
dicted the early ouster of Yeltsin because he
is "just about at the end of his usefulness."
