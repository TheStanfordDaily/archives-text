# U.N. to create war crimes tribunal
## Security Council puts pressure on Balkan states 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Security Council agreed yesterday to
bring the weight of an international tri
bunal to bear on war criminals who have
horrified the world with mass killings
and rapes in the Balkans.
But despite the political significance,
doubts emerged about whether the 15-
nation council's unanimous vote for a war
crimes court would deter further atroci
ties in Yugoslavia and its former republics.
"We should not kid ourselves that
war criminals are going to be deterred
by just the establishment of a tribunal,"
Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's U.N.
ambassador, told reporters.
The establishment of the court and
its rules for operation are still months
away. Still, France's ambassador, Jean-
Bernard Merimee, said war criminals
are now on notice that "they will be held
responsible for their acts."
The resolution also gives a boost to
international mediators Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, who have been pressing for
creation of the court for months and may

be able to use it to pressure the warring
parties in peace talks resuming this week
at U.N. headquarters.
Serbs, Croats and Muslims all have
been accused of crimes in the war that
began as Yugoslavia disintegrated in
1991. U.N. investigators blame Serbs
for the worst atrocities, from creation of
Nazi-like concentration camps to forced
deportation of Muslims and systematic
rape of Muslim women.
The U.S. State Department has iden
tified Serbian President Slobodan Milo
sevic, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and eight other Serb or Croat
military leaders or prison camp com
mandants as probable war criminals.
The resolution on war crimes could
lead to proceedings similar to the 1945-49
Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and the
Tokyo war crimes trials. Those trials led
to new definitions of war crimes and
crimes against humanity that were added
to the Geneva Conventions in 1949.
Madeline Albright, the American
ambassador, drew a historical parallel

by declaring after resolution's adoption,
"The Nuremberg principles have been
reaffirmed."
Among the crimes yesterday's resolu
tion cites in the Balkans are ethnic
cleansing, mass killings and the treat
ment of Muslim women, a reference to
systematic rape.
Albright said the resolution ensures
that people responsible for such "outra
geous, heinous crimes are identified and
held accountable for their actions, which so
affront the world's collective conscience."
The council decided to establish an
international criminal court for the
prosecution of people "responsible for
serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed in the ter
ritory of former Yugoslavia since 1991."
The resolution backs the court with
Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which
authorizes the use of force when inter
national security is threatened. Nations
that refuse to cooperate with investiga
tions or extradite suspects also can face
international sanctions.
