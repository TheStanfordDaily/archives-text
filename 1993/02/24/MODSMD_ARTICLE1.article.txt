David Schmid says America needs serial
killers.
Schmid isn't trying to plug movies like "Si
lence of the Lambs" or the "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre," rather, he's trying to understand
the macabre motives of real-life Hannibal
Lecters and Leatherfaces.
"We need serial killers because we need a
figure to make us feel normal," said Schmid,
a fourth-year doctoral student in the Modern
Thought and Literature program who is writ
ing his dissertation on mass murderers. "We
need a figure for us to see where normality
ends and deviance begins."
Schmid said he looks at how serial killers
are written about and understood by the gen
eral public, basing his work on secondary
sources rather than actual interviews with
the murderers.
He explained that his work is emotionally
draining because he often gets very angry
when doing research.
"I like to think that through working on
the project, I'm doing something productive
with that anger," he said. "Academic work
should have some sort of relevance outside

the university, and I hope people will
read this and understand something
about this phenomenon that they
didn't know before."
He believes that his outlook on life
has also been affected by his work.

"It's made me realize that the old cliche,
'seize the day,' is absolutely true. Despite
what you read that victims contribute to
their death, there is nothing you can do to
protect yourself from this violence," he said.
"It is like living in California and worrying
about earthquakes. There's nothing you can
do to prevent them, so you just live your
life."
He said he first became interested in serial
killers while at the University of Sussex in
England getting his masters in critical theory
and writing a thesis on two British child mur
ders of the 19605.
He explained that he is trying to determine
why the serial killer has gone from an obscure
category in criminology 20 to 30 years ago, to
what he to refers to as "America's preemi
nent deviant" today.

mass murderers' minds

English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino, one of
Schmid's advisers, said that his research is
going well. "I suspect that the dissertation
will not have any problems being published.
It is a ground breaking work in the study of
serial killers," Sorrentino said.
Schmid credited the Modern Thought and
Literature program for allowing him to pur
sue this subject.
"[lt] is the only program in the country
where I could do this project. It cuts across a
lot of disciplinary boundaries: using a bit of
literature, sociology, psychology, feminist
studies and history," Schmid said. "It allows
you to work through a particular problem or
issue by drawing from what ever disciplines
you think would be helpful."
He explained that although there is a
growing interest in serial killers, most news
accounts of such acts neglect to describe a so
cial context.
Serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, who
was convicted of killing 17 people in Milwau
kee in 1991, illustrate the importance of ana
lyzing the societal context of crime, Schmid
said.
"You could look at him and see clearly that
he is an individual that is disturbed and

should be punished. He also tells us a
lot about contemporary social atti
tudes towards homosexuals and racial
politics," he said.

Bloody thriller movies aren't the only way to observe serial killers, according to doctoral student David Schmld. The graduate student in Mod
ern Thought and Literature is writing his dissertation on the way mass murderers are written about and understood in American society.
In the case of Dahmer, a 14-
year-old Laotian boy had escaped
and was running away naked in
the street. Police stopped the boy
and returned him to Dahmer. He
convinced the police that all that
was going on was a quarrel
between two lovers. Later that
night, he murdered the boy.
"If Dahmer would have been
black instead of white, police
would have run a check on him. If
they would have done that, they
would have found he was on pro
bation for sexually molesting
another boy," said Schmid. "He
would have been arrested and
lives would have been saved."
He also said he felt that if the
boy was white, police would have
looked into the situation more
carefully and found out what
Dahmer was doing.
Schmid also explained how
Ted Bundy, executed in 1989 for
murdering several sorority
women and a 12-year-old girl in

Florida, exemplifies the mistreat
ment of women in American soci
ety.
"It is popular to look at Bundy
and say he is evil and mad. I
would prefer to say that that is
half true. We should also look and
see how someone like Bundy illu
minates what is a persuasive
streak of woman hating in soci
ety," Schmid said.
Schmid said he believes that
the reason there is so little atten
tion to the social context of serial
killings is that there is an unwill
ingness for people who read and
write about serial killers "to face
up to the possibility that serial
killing is a part of the American
way."
He believes that the reason
people are interested in serial
killers is that they tell us about
ourselves and how our society is
divided along the lines of race,
gender and class.
"When a serial killer is arrest
ed in your neighborhood, sudden
ly deep tensions are revealed in
your community," Schmid said,
citing the controversies that

engulfed Milwaukee after Dah
mer's arrest.
He also explained that serial
killers come from many walks of
life. "Generally, the popular
image of a serial killer is a white,
heterosexual male, like Ted
Bundy. Part of what I'm trying to
do is say that serial killing is more
inclusive," Schmid said.
He explained that there have
been some homosexual serial
killers as well as a few black and
Hispanic serial murderers.
"What this indicates is if you real
ly want to understand a phe
nomenon as complex as this, what
you need is an analytical frame
work that will combine various
factors," Schmid said.
"I try to come up with a frame
work that is sufficiently flexible,
and sufficiently complex to allow
the fact that there really are no
final answers to this issue," he
said. "I don't think it will ever be
possible to answer questions like:
What causes serial murders?
What kind of people commit seri
al murders? How can we stop seri
al killers?"

"I try to come up with a frame
work that is sufficiently flexible,
and sufficiently complex to allow
the fact that there really are no
final answers to this issue," he
said. "I don't think it will ever be
possible to answer questions like:
What causes serial murders?
What kind of people commit seri
al murders? How can we stop seri
al killers?"
David Schmid says America needs serial
killers.
Schmid isn't trying to plug movies like "Si
lence of the Lambs" or the "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre," rather, he's trying to understand
the macabre motives of real-life Hannibal
Lecters and Leatherfaces.
"We need serial killers because we need a
figure to make us feel normal," said Schmid,
a fourth-year doctoral student in the Modern
Thought and Literature program who is writ
ing his dissertation on mass murderers. "We
need a figure for us to see where normality
ends and deviance begins."
Schmid said he looks at how serial killers
are written about and understood by the gen
eral public, basing his work on secondary
sources rather than actual interviews with
the murderers.
He explained that his work is emotionally
draining because he often gets very angry
when doing research.
"I like to think that through working on
the project, I'm doing something productive
with that anger," he said. "Academic work
should have some sort of relevance outside

the university, and I hope people will
read this and understand something
about this phenomenon that they
didn't know before."
He believes that his outlook on life
has also been affected by his work.

"It's made me realize that the old cliche,
'seize the day,' is absolutely true. Despite
what you read that victims contribute to
their death, there is nothing you can do to
protect yourself from this violence," he said.
"It is like living in California and worrying
about earthquakes. There's nothing you can
do to prevent them, so you just live your
life."
He said he first became interested in serial
killers while at the University of Sussex in
England getting his masters in critical theory
and writing a thesis on two British child mur
ders of the 19605.
He explained that he is trying to determine
why the serial killer has gone from an obscure
category in criminology 20 to 30 years ago, to
what he to refers to as "America's preemi
nent deviant" today.

Grad student peers into
mass murderers' minds

English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino, one of
Schmid's advisers, said that his research is
going well. "I suspect that the dissertation
will not have any problems being published.
It is a ground breaking work in the study of
serial killers," Sorrentino said.
Schmid credited the Modern Thought and
Literature program for allowing him to pur
sue this subject.
"[lt] is the only program in the country
where I could do this project. It cuts across a
lot of disciplinary boundaries: using a bit of
literature, sociology, psychology, feminist
studies and history," Schmid said. "It allows
you to work through a particular problem or
issue by drawing from what ever disciplines
you think would be helpful."
He explained that although there is a
growing interest in serial killers, most news
accounts of such acts neglect to describe a so
cial context.
Serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, who
was convicted of killing 17 people in Milwau
kee in 1991, illustrate the importance of ana
lyzing the societal context of crime, Schmid
said.
"You could look at him and see clearly that
he is an individual that is disturbed and

should be punished. He also tells us a
lot about contemporary social atti
tudes towards homosexuals and racial
politics," he said.

Bloody thriller movies aren't the only way to observe serial killers, according to doctoral student David Schmld. The graduate student in Mod
ern Thought and Literature is writing his dissertation on the way mass murderers are written about and understood in American society.
In the case of Dahmer, a 14-
year-old Laotian boy had escaped
and was running away naked in
the street. Police stopped the boy
and returned him to Dahmer. He
convinced the police that all that
was going on was a quarrel
between two lovers. Later that
night, he murdered the boy.
"If Dahmer would have been
black instead of white, police
would have run a check on him. If
they would have done that, they
would have found he was on pro
bation for sexually molesting
another boy," said Schmid. "He
would have been arrested and
lives would have been saved."
He also said he felt that if the
boy was white, police would have
looked into the situation more
carefully and found out what
Dahmer was doing.
Schmid also explained how
Ted Bundy, executed in 1989 for
murdering several sorority
women and a 12-year-old girl in

Florida, exemplifies the mistreat
ment of women in American soci
ety.
"It is popular to look at Bundy
and say he is evil and mad. I
would prefer to say that that is
half true. We should also look and
see how someone like Bundy illu
minates what is a persuasive
streak of woman hating in soci
ety," Schmid said.
Schmid said he believes that
the reason there is so little atten
tion to the social context of serial
killings is that there is an unwill
ingness for people who read and
write about serial killers "to face
up to the possibility that serial
killing is a part of the American
way."
He believes that the reason
people are interested in serial
killers is that they tell us about
ourselves and how our society is
divided along the lines of race,
gender and class.
"When a serial killer is arrest
ed in your neighborhood, sudden
ly deep tensions are revealed in
your community," Schmid said,
citing the controversies that

engulfed Milwaukee after Dah
mer's arrest.
He also explained that serial
killers come from many walks of
life. "Generally, the popular
image of a serial killer is a white,
heterosexual male, like Ted
Bundy. Part of what I'm trying to
do is say that serial killing is more
inclusive," Schmid said.
He explained that there have
been some homosexual serial
killers as well as a few black and
Hispanic serial murderers.
"What this indicates is if you real
ly want to understand a phe
nomenon as complex as this, what
you need is an analytical frame
work that will combine various
factors," Schmid said.
