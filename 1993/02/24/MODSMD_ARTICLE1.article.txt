David Schmid says America needs serial
killers.
Schmid isn't trying to plug movies like "Si
lence of the Lambs" or the "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre," rather, he's trying to understand
the macabre motives of real-life Hannibal
Lecters and Leatherfaces.
"We need serial killers because we need a
figure to make us feel normal," said Schmid,
a fourth-year doctoral student in the Modern
Thought and Literature program who is writ
ing his dissertation on mass murderers. "We
need a figure for us to see where normality
ends and deviance begins."
Schmid said he looks at how serial killers
are written about and understood by the gen
eral public, basing his work on secondary
sources rather than actual interviews with
the murderers.
He explained that his work is emotionally
draining because he often gets very angry
when doing research.
"I like to think that through working on
the project, I'm doing something productive
with that anger," he said. "Academic work
should have some sort of relevance outside

the university, and I hope people will
read this and understand something
about this phenomenon that they
didn't know before."
He believes that his outlook on life
has also been affected by his work.

"It's made me realize that the old cliche,
'seize the day,' is absolutely true. Despite
what you read that victims contribute to
their death, there is nothing you can do to
protect yourself from this violence," he said.
"It is like living in California and worrying
about earthquakes. There's nothing you can
do to prevent them, so you just live your
life."
He said he first became interested in serial
killers while at the University of Sussex in
England getting his masters in critical theory
and writing a thesis on two British child mur
ders of the 19605.
He explained that he is trying to determine
why the serial killer has gone from an obscure
category in criminology 20 to 30 years ago, to
what he to refers to as "America's preemi
nent deviant" today.

Grad student peers into
mass murderers' minds

English Prof. Gilbert Sorrentino, one of
Schmid's advisers, said that his research is
going well. "I suspect that the dissertation
will not have any problems being published.
It is a ground breaking work in the study of
serial killers," Sorrentino said.
Schmid credited the Modern Thought and
Literature program for allowing him to pur
sue this subject.
"[lt] is the only program in the country
where I could do this project. It cuts across a
lot of disciplinary boundaries: using a bit of
literature, sociology, psychology, feminist
studies and history," Schmid said. "It allows
you to work through a particular problem or
issue by drawing from what ever disciplines
you think would be helpful."
He explained that although there is a
growing interest in serial killers, most news
accounts of such acts neglect to describe a so
cial context.
Serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, who
was convicted of killing 17 people in Milwau
kee in 1991, illustrate the importance of ana
lyzing the societal context of crime, Schmid
said.
"You could look at him and see clearly that
he is an individual that is disturbed and

should be punished. He also tells us a
lot about contemporary social atti
tudes towards homosexuals and racial
politics," he said.

Bloody thriller movies aren't the only way to observe serial killers, according to doctoral student David Schmld. The graduate student in Mod
ern Thought and Literature is writing his dissertation on the way mass murderers are written about and understood in American society.
