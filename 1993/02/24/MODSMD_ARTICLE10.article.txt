# Airlift aid to Bosnia threatened

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” American pilots dropping food
from high above eastern Bosnia could still
be hit by Serb missiles, and their bundles
could veer off target and smash houses or
be lost, relief experts said yesterday.
Furthermore, Serb commanders,
suspicious of Western intervention,
have warned that the airdrops could
lead to an escalation of fighting.
While many relief officials welcomed
the U.S. deliveries, experts expressed
mixed feelings about whether they
would be effective or safe.
"If they think they can do it, then for
goodness sake, let's go for it because the
situation in some of these areas is really
bad," said Sylvana Foa, a spokeswoman
for the U.N. Human Rights Commis
sioner in Geneva.
The Washington plan, intended to

reach about 100,000 isolated people, calls
for high-altitude drops, to protect U.S.
pilots from anti-aircraft or missile fire.
But packages released at 12,000 feet,
as discussed in the plan, could easily
veer more than a mile from designated
mountain targets, and about a quarter
of the supplies could be expected to fall
into the hands of Serb besiegers.
"But when you are aiming at a large
village or a small town or a spread-out
community, then I think there must be a
good chance of a fair proportion of sup
plies actually reaching the target," said
Royal Air Force Vice Marshall Tony
Mason of Britain, who helped coordinate
relief drops in Ethiopia, Somalia and Iraq.
"If we can get food or aid in any way,
I'm delighted. But 12,000 feet?" asked
Larry Hollingworth, a U.N. operations
chief in Sarajevo. "I don't know how

he's going to get pinpoint accuracy at
that height."
"Road convoys are more accurate,
carry more tonnage and are far more
cost-effective," said Hollingworth, who
is often present at Serb roadblocks.
U.S. military airdrops to Iraqi Kurds
following the 1991 Gulf War killed at
least nine people on the ground, but
conditions were different, Foa said.
"What you had was hundreds of
thousands of people crammed on a
mountainside," she said in an interview.
"What we have (in eastern Bosnia) is
a rural area. So it's much less likely
that something would fall on their
heads."
Hollingworth said the airdrops would
feed Serb suspicions that arms were
being sent to the Muslims under the
guise of humanitarian shipments.
