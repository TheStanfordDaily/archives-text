The extension of Sand
Hill Road will greatly
benefit the University

Battles over building
and extending Sand Hill
Road have been brewing
since the 1930s and are yet again
plaguing the University and the
cities of Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
These battles have been need
lessly prolonged and must come to
an end. Sand Hill Road should be
lengthened and completed, a result
which would both augment Stan
ford's income and ease University
traffic while having few negative
effects, financial or environmental.
Stanford has once again pro
posed extending and widening
Sand Hill Road, increasing it to
four lanes and connecting it to El
Camino Real in between the Stan
ford Shopping Center and San
Francisquito Creek.
In conjunction with this project,
Arboretum Road would be removed,
a new road between Nordstrom and
the Stanford Barn would be con
structed and additional auxiliary
improvements to surrounding
roads would be made. .
In all, the project will cost $9.1
million, with Stanford paying $3.5
million, Palo Alto paying $2.1 mil
lion and the Stanford Shopping
Center paying another $3.5 mil
lion.
The controversy over building
the extension revolves around the
trade-off between protecting the
environment or placing a greater
emphasis on economic develop
ment.
Yet the environmental repercus
sions of the extension are slight
and illusory; the economic benefits
are tangible and significant.
First and foremost, building the
extension will undoubtedly benefit
the University economically. The
funds used for this improvement
would not be drawn from the Gen
eral Operating Budget; instead the

$3.5 million will come from the
General Plant Improvement Fund
that is used for building sidewalks
and other infrastructure projects.
And although Stanford will be
spending $3.5 million in addition to
the $500,000 spent on the Environ
mental Impact Report, the invest
ment will bring great returns.
Stanford earns money from the
renting of stores to the Stanford
Shopping Center, as well as netting
a percentage of the sales from
stores in the mall.
When the road extension is
built, there will be more space
available in which to put stores,
translating into more rent and
sales profits for Stanford. A por
tion of this money goes toward the
University Operating Budget, from
which financial aid and staff
salaries, among other programs,
are drawn.
Therefore, investing in the Sand
Hill Road extension is a good idea,
as long as the percentage of money
going into the University Operat
ing Budget remains high.
Opponents of the project claim
that the extension will have
numerous negative environmental
effects. The principal claim is that
San Francisquito Creek and its
inhabitants will be endangered if
the road is built.
However, the creek is already
lined with concrete and is not pre
served in its natural state; the
extension will have a marginal
effect on an already-disturbed
brook. With the shopping center and
other construction, precedent has
already been set for development.
All in all, building the Sand Hill
Road extension would benefit stu
dents at the University, redirect traf
fic away from Campus Drive and
unify the separated parts of Stan
ford Shopping Center These bene
fits outweigh the comparatively
small initial cost and miniscule envi
ronmental impact of the extension.
In a time when tuition has been
hiked 7.5 percent and other costs
are also spiralling upward, Stan
ford needs to invest in its future by
building the extension. Now.
