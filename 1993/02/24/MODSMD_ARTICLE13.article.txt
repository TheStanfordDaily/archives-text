A hip commentary on life

I'M HIP. I FOLLOW the trends. I
have, at the proper times, owned
Member's Only jackets, parachute
pants and those fold-out car sun-shade
deals. So when I saw this anti-intellectu
al thing become such a hot topic, I figured
I'd better get on it before I said some
thing that was out of vogue.
First off, let me just say that I have
nothing against no-brain fun. In fact, I
think it's essential to maintain sanity. I
love broom ball, primal screams, paper
wars at Flicks and naked people. I've
even been know to bust an Ice-T lyric or
two when the moment hits.
But hold on. I'm not one to jump into
the fountain so quickly.
Some people make a career out of this
kind of look-at-me-I'm-cool-because-I'm
not-intellectual attitude. It's unique to
Stanford. Have fun. Don't ever think if
you don't have to. Do the bare minimum.
These people have constructed a Mag
inot line between classes and life. They
only really listen to something if it's pref
aced by "you'll need to know this for the
midterm." They can get straight A's and
not learn a thing. To them, college is a
place to buy a degree.
But it's not. College is a place to learn
not only about embargoes and valence
electrons, but also about yourself, about
other people and about the world. College
is a place to grow intellectually. A place to
grow up.

Then we've got the other camp. The
people that do nothing but intellectual
ize. Usually these people are depressed.
Because everyone else is a "mindless ple
beian." Or because the topic of death
keeps coming up. Or because a republi
can is in office somewhere. Or because
everyone keeps telling them they need to
"lighten up."
And they do. Sometimes life is fun,
and if it isn't we need to make it so. Peo
ple are good. Life is good. But they refuse
to acknowledge it.
All too often, people just won't think.
Not about other people, or the world
around them, or about themselves. All
they really care about is if they are get
ting good enough grades to get a high
paying job. Or if they impressed that
guy/gal enough to get him/her to call. Or
how they are going to get smashed this
weekend.
At times I see an excess of living but
not enough life.
But both the intellects and the anti
intellects are selling themselves short.
There has to be more.
The bottom line is that this isn't just
school, this is life. Sure, we should work
hard in class, but we also need to develop
ourselves. Sometimes that means a mid
night round of frisbee golf. Sometimes
that means a midnight discussion on race
relations. Sometimes that means throw
ing fruit at the Cal band. Sometimes that

means throwing questions at your pro
fessor during office hours.
Some of us need to infuse our lives
with ideas. Some of us need to infuse our
ideas with life. All of us need to synthe
size our thoughts and action. Life is pur
suing thoughtless fun. And life is having
fun pursuing thoughtfulness. Above all,
and no matter the particular pursuit, life
is a process of thinking — and then being.
There are things to be learned all
around us. Maybe what Aristotle had to
say about friendship is worth thinking
about. Maybe it's time to get some
oranges off the tree in front of the post
office. Maybe that guy down the hall has
something important to say. Think. And
then be.
We need to be more eclectic, picking up
ideas we encounter day to day. And
digesting them. Perhaps something we
think of will change us — more likely not.
But the mental exercise will help us
toward a more complete life. If accompa
nied by a game of frisbee.
