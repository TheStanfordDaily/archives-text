Mem Chu should be a place where everyone can worship

THIS LETTER responds to Mike
Langford's column and Caroline
Chen's letter on Memorial
Church. I would like to make some
observations in reference to their ques
tioning of Memorial Church's "Chris
tianity." Memorial Church was created
as a Christian church, and continues to
serve as one, but should that necessarily
limit its use?
I have no problem with someone
from a non-Christian religion using
that building as a place of worship to
achieve the faith and love for which it
was created. If a particular service is
offensive to someone, perhaps they
should try another. There are many
different groups that use the church,
ranging from the more "traditional"
services to those aimed specifically at
women, for example. All of these are
ways of bringing people together to
examine their lives.
Langford suggests purchasing Bibles
for the church. From reading his col
umn, which contains erroneous infor
mation about the funds available to

Memorial Church, I wonder if he real
izes that different denominations of
Christianity use different versions of
the Bible. I also wonder if he had a par
ticular denomination in mind, to nar
row the church into one very specific
religion. Perhaps the next time he goes
to Memorial Church to pray, meditate,
walk around to be inspired by its beau
ty or attend services, he could bring his
own Bible along.
At Memorial Church last Thursday,
I admired the three stained-glass
depictions of Christ above the altar,
only to come home and read that
Memorial Church is a place of "a few
token crosses and . . . one stained-glass
portrait of Christ." As for Memorial
Church "no longer present[ingl the
Christian tone ... in the discussions
and speeches held there," the writer
might attend one of the many specifi
cally Christian services or discussions
held there and reevaluate that com
ment. Looking for education? Try one
of many Bible study groups, or per
haps the Kurt Reinhardt Lecture held

two weeks ago. Reading the etchings in
the church walls would also be a good
start.
Finally, I can't help but think that
somehow the point is being missed.
Christianity is not a building, but a
way of life. It is not found in a Bible,
but in a soul. It is about faith, hope
and love, and not about turning people
away. At home my "church" was a
small Christian chapel, without bibles,
organ, representations of Christ or
large stained-glass windows. For the
past few years, "church" to many
Catholics on campus has been the Oak
Lounge of Tresidder Union or Kresge
Auditorium. "Church" to some is the
foothills, a beach at sunset or their
quiet bedroom.
Perhaps the answers to these ques
tions of faith lie within their question
ers and not in Memorial Church, its
staff or its sermons. If there is a prob
lem with how the Stanford community
addresses Christianity, that frustration
should not be directed at an institution
like Memorial Church that is doing

everything it can to operate in an
atmosphere that can seem hostile. (I
was recently informed by a professor,
in a lecture about Christian influences
on a novelist, that God did not exist.
He proceeded to ask rather sarcastical
ly for a show of hands from anyone
who disagreed.)
Maybe the issue is, in fact, how the
Stanford community tends to treat
religion in general. People of faith
who believe in religions other than
Christianity, or who cannot overcome
legitimate grievances with organized
religion, are no less subject to frustra
tion than Christians are when reli
gious faith is trivialized. Why has
religion become such a target at a
university that professes acceptance
of so many other differences between
people? That is a question I cannot
answer, but I suggest that the solu
tion, not the problem, lies in Memori
al Church and its diverse congrega
tions.
