# Israeli human rights abuses must be ended through U.S. influence
## 
### 
John Felstiner's letter of Feb. 17
complaining about the description by
Stanford Middle East Focus on the
1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre
(Daily, Feb. 11) was the familiar all
purpose reply to any criticism of
Israel: Why pick on Israel when Arab
nations are so much worse? This
response conveniently diverts atten
tion from the fact that Israel's contin
ued military rule over neighboring ter
ritories involves the denial of rights to
nearly two million Palestinians, the
flagrant defiance of UN resolutions

and the violation of international law.
Amnesty International, the Interna
tional Red Cross and Israeli human
rights organizations have repeatedly
condemned Israel for its documented
abuses of human rights, including
indiscriminate beatings and killings,
and torture â€” even of women and chil
dren. Despite worldwide censure, the
Israeli government has imprisoned
thousands of Palestinians without
trial, seized land and water rights
from Palestinian farmers, destroyed
homes and orchards as a form of col
lective punishment and imposed
round-the-clock curfews that keep tens
of thousands of people from earning a
livelihood or obtaining food and
medicine for their children.
The sins of Syria, Iraq and other
Arab nations are well recognized by

most Americans, but since we are not
asked to subsidize their prisons and
torture chambers, there seems little
point in echoing the accepted view of
these countries. Israel, on the other
hand, is constantly portrayed as the
Middle East's "only democracy" and
receives more than $4 billion a year in
U.S. aid. Since this aid gives our gov
ernment considerable leverage over
Israeli policy, we are obliged to protest
when that policy is unjust and threat
ens to undermine any hope of Middle
East piece.
As for Felstiner's final point, that a
visiting speaker denied the existence of
"death squads" in Israel, what better
name is there for Israeli soldiers dis
guised as Arabs who drive through Arab
towns in cars with Arab license plates
and shoot down their Palestinian victims

in cold blood? They are known in Israel
as "undercover units," and their mission
is no secret either to Palestinians or
Israelis.
