## Hating for hate's sake; an angry ultimatum 
### 
HATE IS SUCH a strong word. You
don't hate anyone, my mom used
to say. Hate is a term used for eth
nic cleansing in Eastern Europe. Hate is
reserved for bitter, spiteful, ugly people
without any happy thoughts to think.
And a bitter person, I am not.
I have never been a fan of true hate.
The kind of seething hate that gives peo
ple some incredible power like Wonder
Woman after she spins and hops into her
butt-huggers. A feeling that rips your
heart out and holds it in front of your
face, goading you into action.
I prefer rage. Break a window. Break
your fist. Break a few billion hearts along
the way. Hate for hate's sake is so unful
filling. Why not take a little time and
turn it into nice, constructive rage, small
random acts of violence to keep the world

on its toes?
Maybe I've watched "A Clockwork
Orange" a few too many times.
But I think it would be real horror
show if everybody would take a time-out
and reassess little things like hate. Do
you hate your twisted childhood? Your
roommate's friends coming to visit when
she's gone, trying to save face by making
conversation with the last person they
want to talk to, mainly, you?
Perhaps it's little kids who dawdle in
the crosswalk a bit too long. Or the way
your significant other wants to cuddle
instead of just falling into a coma like
you're supposed to.
Mind you, I do not hate.
And if you, oh senselessly mean-spirit
ed readers, choose to hate, is it at least a
hate worth the effort? None of this I

hate-the-lines-at-Old-Union, I-hate-
American-cars-with-poor-turning-radii,
I-hate-men-with-no-butts thing. It has to
be thoughtful hate.
BYO-Jonestown Kool-Aid.
If you are going to waste your energy
hating, it might as well be apocalyptic,
Armageddon, misery-causing hate. I
couldn't care less if your momma wears
combat boots.
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.
Yeah, right. As if you're gonna hate
someone because they've got some feeble
shampoo contract and silky, split-end
free hair. If she's so goddamned beauti
ful, why isn't the camera in focus? Envy?
High school prom queens are all preg
nant, heroin-addicted vegetables right
now. Pity them, don't hate them.
Her date was secretly lusting after you

all night, anyway.
If you decide to fester, make it worth
it. Hate world leaders, large groups of
people, countries, religions and mind
frames. Debilitate yourself and alienate
others, if you insist. Hate like only a
20th-century dictator could. Terrorize
people. Invent new ways to manifest and
demonstrate your hate for others. Crip
ple the world.
Make children fear with your hate.
Make strong women cry, proud men
cower. Don't hate your ex-boyfriend's
new girlfriend. Yes, she's fatter than you
are. Yes, her hairdo's not flattering. Yes,
she eats Alpo's Cycle Nine (for older
dogs). Pull yourself together.
Be frustrated, annoyed, perplexed or
repulsed with friends, enemies and snags
in your pantyhose. But we waste so many

intense words. Save hate for the big time.
The stains on your socks from walking
back from chem in the rain do not count.
Imagine screaming masses and horri
ble cruelties; the burden of intense emo
tion, crushing the wills of some and
invoking the wrath of others. What
would the world be, if not for such con
viction?
You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I
am not the only one.

Tish Williams likes to kiss babies and
visit convalescent homes when she's not
writing her international pen pals.
