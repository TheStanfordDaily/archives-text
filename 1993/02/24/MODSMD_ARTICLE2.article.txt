Four professors, honored for
their undergraduate teaching ef
forts, have been bestowed with
the 1993 Bing teaching awards.
Named as Bing Fellows were
William Durham, professor of an
thropology and director of the
Program in Human Biology; Mary
Louise Pratt, professor of Spanish
and Portuguese and comparative
literature; Eric Roberts, associate
professor of computer science;
and Robert Sapolsky, associate
professor of biological sciences.
In order to encourage improve
ments in teaching, the $5 million
Bing Fund was established in
1991 by Stanford trustee Peter
Bing and his wife Helen.
The award entails a grant of
$10,000 each year for three years.
Two-thirds of the money is desig
nated for the recipients to use to
ward projects that support teach
ing and the curriculum. The win
ners may use the remainder for
any purpose.
Though none of the professors
have made definite plans for the
money, they all plan to use it to
creatively enhance the undergrad
uate learning environment.

Pratt said. "Having a private re
serve of money like this is unusual
and exciting. . . . The idea is to give
people who've been committed to

to try something new."
Pratt, who has been on the fac
ulty for 17 years, co-organized the
Europe and the Americas Cul
tures, Ideas and Values track.
Citing her commitment "over
the years to interdisciplinary
tracks," Pratt said her work on
the CIV course helped her win the
award.
Durham, who has credited his
success as an undergraduate edu
cator to his interdisciplinary ap
proach to education and research,
also received an undergraduate
teaching award from the ASSU in
1991 and a Dean's Award for
Teaching in 1979.
