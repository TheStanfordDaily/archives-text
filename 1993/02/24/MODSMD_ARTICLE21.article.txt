## Cryptography: improved way to hide information New techniques allow greater security for bank accounts and transmission of confidential material 
### Peter Stevens Staff writer 
With the increasing use of computer
networks to send everything from bank
ing information to criminal records, peo
ple are encountering problems of how to
keep sensitive information private. But
special coding processes called "cryp

tosystems" may prove to be the future of
data security.
Cryptosystems can protect valuable
pieces of information from thieves and
eavesdroppers by encrypting information
before transmission and decoding it with
a special "key" after it has been sent.
Individual users will have different keys,
just as no two front door keys are alike.
These systems are becoming more
common, and even those who are not
computer users often encounter cryptog
raphy on a daily basis.
Virtually all bank transactions are
secured by encrypting the data represent
ing funds transfers and can only be
accessed using a key.
Encryption is a change of original data
into "cipher-text." Once changed, the
data can be sent over normal communi
cations channels, such as phone lines or
computer networks. The information is
safe from prying eyes because only some
one with the correct decrypting key can
read the message.
Once an obscure and relatively rare
technology, recent advances have given
cryptography greater eminence. In the
future, researchers say, encryption will
enable many more everyday transactions
to be entirely electronic.
The are two types of cryptography:
"secret-key" systems and "public-key"

ones.
Currently, only a secret-key cryptosys-

tem called Data Encryption
Standard (DES) is widely

used.

Another system called RSA — named
after its MIT creators: Ron Rivest, Adi
Shamir and Len Adleman — is a com
mercial implementation of the public-key
cryptosystem.
Public-key cryptography, which is
rapidly gaining support, is a new way of
thinking about encoding, decoding and
authenticating data that laid the founda
tions for the development of modern com
bined secret-key and public-key cryptosys
tems.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Martin
Hellman, who invented the idea of public
key cryptography in the 19705, says the
combination of the DES secret-key cryp
tosystem with a public-key system, such
as RSA, is widely seen as the direction of
future cryptography.
"Each of these systems have strengths
and weaknesses. The combination of the
two systems is much more useful than
either alone," he said.
The DES system does well with the
encryption and decryption of data, such
as bank information. The system is very
fast, between 100 and 10,000 times faster
than RSA, and still secure after 15 years
of attempts to break its code.
However, security is still a problem
with the system. It cannot be used for
authentication; that is, signing a message
in such a way that the signature cannot
be forged.
In order for the DES system to work,
both the sender and receiver must know
a secret key. The sender has to give the
receiver the secret key to decode the mes
sage.
The exposure of the secret key leaves it
susceptible for an eavesdropper to steal
the code and read private messages or get
into a bank account. This is a fundamen
tal difficulty with secret-key cryptogra
phy systems.
Fusing DES with public-key ciyptog
raphy answers some of these problems.
Public-key systems work on the principle
of a key for encoding that is different
from the key used for decoding.
The key is in two parts. The public
part is distributed widely — it is pub
lished so that someone wishing to send a
message can look up the encoding key for

the intended recipient.
For example, say Laurel wants to send
a message to Hardy. Laurel looks up
Hardy's public key in a directory, as you
would get a phone number from a phone
book. He uses Hardy's public key to
encode the message.

'Each of these systems
have strengths and
weaknesses. The
combination of the two
systems is much more
useful than either alone.'
— Prof. Martin Hellman

Everyone has access to the key used to
encode messages for Hardy. However,
only Hardy is able to decode the message
with the other portion of the key that he
has kept private.
Authentication, or the signing of mes
sages, is the other major problem solved
by public-key cryptosystems. Laurel uses
his private key to encode his signature.
Any recipient can use Laurel's public key
to verify that only Laurel could have been
the sender and no one "forged" his signa
ture.
The concept may seem simple, but
researchers say that a great deal of tech
nology is needed to fully develop such sys
tems.
Private key cryptosystem encoding is
performed using a series of "black box"
transpositions and substitutions
designed to make the resulting cipher
text reveal as little as possible about the
original, uncoded text.
Based on work at IBM and the Nation
al Security Agency in the 19705, DES
uses a 56-bit key to scramble plain text
into cipher-text. The same 56-bit key is
used to decode the message.
The public-key cryptosystem, on the
other hand, is based on a set of mathe

matical operations. Using RSA as an
example — a key generation function is
used to create a two part key, one public
part and one private part.
The person would publish the public
key and keep the private key secret. To
decode a message, the person would use
their private key. No one else can decode
the message except for the person with
the secret private key.
Cryptosystems are defined as secure if
breaking the code will either cost more
than the secret information is worth, or if
breaking it will take longer than the
information is valuable.
Fifteen years ago, a 56-bit DES key
was reasonably secure against hackers
simply trying all possible key combina
tions. The problem is that computers
available to code breakers increase in
power by about 40 percent each year.
In the future, a hacker will be able to
assemble enough power to mount a seri
ous attack on a DES encrypted message
at a reasonable cost. Hellman and other
cryptographers are currently working on
ways to extend the life of DES in the face
of this rapid technical change.
Hellman said the policy issues raised
by the diffusion of cryptography technol
ogy is a concern. A wide array of law
enforcement officials, business interests,
academics and cryptography experts are
all debating the merits of expanded cryp
tographic systems.
For example, law enforcement agen
cies are arguing that all generally used
cryptographic systems should be break
able. Police are concerned about their
eroding ability to understand informa
tion they acquire through searches and
wiretaps, said Hellman.
Law enforcement officials claim their
interests outweigh individual privacy
issues for cases, especially when encryp
tion is used to hide evidence of criminal
activity.
Though sympathetic to these con
cerns, Hellman feels that privacy is
important as well. "I think that, ulti
mately, the decision will be made in favor
of effective privacy, which means people
will have general access to secure cryp
tosystems."
