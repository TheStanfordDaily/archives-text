# Bug answers with full moon

"Illusions are special cases in
which reality is misperceiued. In
ordinary life, such mistakes are
rare because our perceptual sys
tems are geared to see the world
as it really is — allowing us to
bypass the continual fluctuations
of the proximal stimulus so that
we can grasp the enduring prop
erties of the distal reality out
side. "

/\ Why does the moon appear
larger when it is closer to the
horizon ? Is it an optical illusion
— is the size of the retinal image
the same as when we view it high
er in the sky, or is its image mag
nified by the atmosphere so the
image cast on the retina is actu
ally larger?

A: The so-called "moon illu
sion," described in this
week's question, has perplexed
lovers, werewolves and more
casual observers of lunar mat
ters since the days of the classi
cal Greeks.
A full moon near its zenith
looks much smaller than a swollen,
orange "harvest moon" hovering
near the horizon. But why?
The answer comes not from
optics, but from the psychology
of visual perception. When evalu
ating the size of an object, we
humans automatically compen
sate for its distance by using
depth cues implicit in the visual
field we're examining.
Usually, this is good. If it were
otherwise, the sizes of objects
would appear to change with dis
tance. We would perceive our
most prized possessions dwin
dling to specks as we left them
behind. Those annoying little
children who peer at us between
their thumb and forefinger,
screaming, "I'm crushing your
head - CRUSH, CRUSH!"
would cease being mere brats and
become genuinely terrifying.
But sometimes our innate
compensation mechanisms back
fire and produce visual illusions.
Such is the case with the chang
ing apparent size of the moon.
Most people perceive the night
sky as a flattened dome rather
than a perfect hemisphere. The
"roof' of the dome (i.e., the over
head sky) seems closer to us than
the "walls." Heavenly objects —
for whose real distance we Naked

Apes have very little useful intu
ition — are evaluated as being
near when high in the sky and far
away when low.
A school of psychological
thought called "depth-process
ing theory" makes the straight
forward assertion that if two
objects cast equally large retinal
images, the one that subcon
scious visual clues evaluate as
being farther away will be per
ceived as larger.
The image cast by Luna on
our retina remains the same size
regardless of her height in the
sky. To prove this to yourself,
hold a quarter at arm's length

Those annoying little
children who peer at
us between their
thumb and forefinger,
screaming, "I'm
crushing your head
- CRUSH, CRUSH!"
would cease being
mere brats and
become genuinely
terrifying.

and compare its size to that of
the full moon at two different
times over the course of an
evening. The quarter will cover
exactly the same portion of the
lunar disc whether the moon is
near zenith or nestled down
near the horizon.
The explanation of the moon
illusion is actually quite simple in
light of these observations: Our
visual system, operating on subtle
depth cues in the environment
under inspection, tells us that the
moon is farther away when lower
in the sky. Since the image Earth's

most conspicuous satellite casts on
the retina does not change in size,
depth-processing theory predicts
that we perceive the lower moon
as larger — as indeed we do.
To verify this explanation of
the moon illusion, a bevy of
undergraduates received their
choice of $10 or extra credit in
Psych 1 to view artificial moons
beaming down on artificial hori
zons (where, presumably, artifi
cial cows placidly munched artifi
cial grass beneath artificial trees).
Sure enough, the subjects expe
rienced the familiar moon illusion:
identically sized artificial moons
seemed larger when closer to the
horizon. Furthermore, the illu
sion's power increased as the arti
ficial cows diminished in size (i.e.,
as the horizon appeared farther
and farther away), strongly sug
gesting that distance compensa
tion was responsible for the chang
ing perceived size of the moon.
Interestingly, most of the sub
jects in a related study said when
asked that the moon appears clos
er when it is nearer the horizon.
This quixotic response indi
cates that the processing of depth
cues is mostly subconscious. The
observer judges the moon to be
more distant when low in the
sky, and therefore perceives it —
unconsciously — to be larger
when nearer the horizon.
Then, when the observer is
asked explicitly to evaluate the
moon's relative distance, the per
ception that the moon is larger
enters the conscious mind. Every
day experience tells the observer
that objects that appear larger are
usually closer, and since he
knows that Luna herself is not
changing size, he concludes that
the low moon is closer.
