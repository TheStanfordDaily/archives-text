## Students succumb to sex stress

"Jane?"
"Yes, Leland?"
"Are you feeling frisky tonight,
Jane?"
"Uhh . . . not tonight Leland,
I've got a midterm tomorrow."
You might think Jane and
Leland have problems, but when it
comes to sexual difficulties, they
are far from alone on this campus.
In fact, according to Dr. A 1
Cooper of Counseling and Psy-

chological Services, one out of three Stanford cou
ples has significant fears or problems with sex and
two out of three have "mediocre" sex lives that
could be improved greatly with a little effort.
Although sexual dysfunction can have biological
roots, Cooper said that most problems are psycho
logical. He blames the tendency to ignore or cover up
these frustrations on society.
"Young people expect sex to be great and fun . . .
they just care about getting there," he said.
When people discover they are not the great
lovers they thought, said Cooper, the resulting frus
tration and embarrassment can lead to a wide range
of sexual difficulties.
What is a sexual problem?
While problems like premature ejaculation,
anorgasmia (failure to have an orgasm) and per
formance anxiety might immediately come to
mind, other difficulties, including fear, anxiety
and pain associated with sexual activities are also
common.
Although sex problems occur with the same fre
quency in men and women, there are differences in
the problems that effect each sex.
One of the most common sexual problems for
males, especially younger men, is premature ejacula
tion. Masters and Johnson, the famous sex
researchers, estimate that between 15 and 20 per
cent of all males have difficulty controlling the tim
ing of their orgasm, ejaculating sometimes within
thirty seconds after penetration. The problem is
often a great source of embarrassment for the male,
and for his partner who may feel responsible for the
failure.
Anorgasmia, or the inability to reach orgasm
during sexual activity, is a common sex problem in
women. At one time, female orgasms weren't con
sidered important, but movies and popular trends
have now made the orgasm a symbol of male sexu
al prowess and female sexual liberty.
According to Cooper, 98 percent of women are
capable of having an orgasm, but far fewer actu
ally do. Some women lack orgasm completely or
require extra stimulation to reach it. Because
many women are unaware of their ability to have
an orgasm, feelings of failure and anxiety are
rampant.
Erection problems effect over 8 million men in
the United States. Excessive alcohol consump
tion, depression, lethargy, sleep disorders and
anxiety can lead to temporary inability to sustain
an erection.
Low sexual desire is also problem for both men
and women. Some causes of this include: poor

body image, previously disappointing attempts at
sex or an experience involving sexual abuse.
A discrepancy in sexual desire is a condition when
partners have conflicting attitudes and appetites for
sex. One partner may be an "eager beaver" while the
other isn't. This imbalance in the relationship can
lead to problems.
Anxiety and fixation on past frustrations or
disappointments with sex can lead to a cycle of
"performance anxiety," which Cooper describes as
being more in your mind than in your body.
Focusing on about "how studly" or "how weak"
your performance is can lead to premature or
retarded ejaculation, difficulty lubricating and
anorgasmia.
Treatments
Although common treatments like creams and
lotions are available for downcast lovers, Cooper
says the best treatment for these problems is better
communication between partners.
"Sexual communication in this country is
abysmal. People will feel comfortable enough with
someone to have sex with them, yet they consider it
too personal or too embarrassing to discuss what
(about sex) feels best," he said.
Rather than admitting uncertainties and fears to
their partner, Cooper says many individuals are
convinced they can solve their problems on their
own by "trying harder." He cautions against this
because each successive failure will increase the
blame and tension partners feel, resulting in less
communication.
Cooper said that trying harder is a common mis
take among people used to being in control â€” includ
ing Stanford couples. When small problems arise,
the Stanford tendency to obsess about things going
wrong kicks in, and often creates the performance
anxiety cycle.
Cooper believes that talking about sex will
decrease tension, increase comfort and alleviate
pressure.
Finally, people should consider working to
enhance their sex life, much like trying to improve
any other activity they do.
If you're willing to take lessons to improve your
game of tennis, why not take some time to improve
your game of love, too?

Dr. Cooper recommends "For Yourself or For
Each Other?" and "Male Sexuality," two books on
sexuality. He is available for counseling through
the CAPS program at Cowell. Questions about
