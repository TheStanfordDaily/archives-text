## Loveless backstrokes her way from obscurity to fame 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Watching Lea Loveless consis
tently win the 100-meter back
stroke by half a pool length this
season, no one could dare think of
this Olympian as being a dark
horse or a long shot at any meet,

international or collegiate.
However, just last year, no one
paid any attention to Loveless as
she stepped up to the starting
blocks at the Olympic Trials.
Even after placing second to
American favorite Janie WagstafT
in both the 100 and 200-meter
backstroke races, she was labeled

as an "also-going-to-swim swim
mer" at Barcelona, according to
Olympic and Stanford head coach
Richard Quick.
"I enjoyed my Olympic experi
ence primarily because I had no
expectations placed on me, except
for personal expectations," Love
less said. "No one really knew

who I was, and no one really
expected me to win. For two
whole years before the Olympics,
everyone looked to Janie as Amer
ica's best hope."
Indeed, before the backstroke
races at the Olympics, all the
major networks showed clips of
Wagstaff and Hungarian record
holder Christina Egerszegi going
Btroke-for-stroke. No one focused
on Loveless as she quietly snuck
in to claim the bronze medal in
the 100-meter back. Wagstaff fin
ished a distant fifth place behind
her.
Suddenly there was a changing
of the guard, as Loveless ousted
Wagstaff as the No. 1 American
backstroker and became the U.S.
representative in the 400-meter
medley relay. During that race,
her backstroke leg proved to be
the race of her life as she set an
American record (1 minute, 0.82
seconds) to complement the world
record set by the entire team.
"I wasn't really surprised at
my performance because I always
aim to win," Loveless said. "The
entire experience was definitely
the best thing that's happened in
my life. I swam with no regrets,
and it was immensely rewarding."
Although finally ended follow
ing the Olympics, Loveless' rela
tive anonymity extended back to
her high-school days. She was,
ironically, an underdog in the col
lege recruiting process, as Texas'
Beth Barr and Stanford's Anne
Mahoney occupied the top of
every coach's list of prospects.
"After high school I decided to
give 100 percent of myself to
swimming, because you only have
one time in your life to swim,"
Loveless said. With that mentali
ty, Loveless answered the more
persistent calls from the Universi

ty of Florida and matriculated
there instead of Stanford.
As a freshman, she took a giant
step towards realizing her poten
tial, placing second in both the
100 and 200-yard back events at
the 1990 NCAA Championships.
Despite her stellar season at
Florida, however, Loveless decid
ed to transfer before her sopho
more year.
"I started looking at different
programs primarily because the
coach there retired after my
freshman year," Loveless said.
"Also, Florida was really like an
extension of high school, instead
of a real college. It just wasn't
worth the academic sacrifice to
try out a new coach."
Since coming to Stanford, she
has won the 100-yard back while
placing second in the 200-yard
back at last year's NCAA Champi
onships. Loveless also holds the
current American record in the
100-yard back (52.79) as well as
two deGuerre pool records in her
two specialty events.
"With all her records and
medals now, hardly anyone
remembers that this was the girl
who no one expected to make the
national team," Quick said. "She
really developed as a competitor
at the highest level last year dur
ing the Olympics and the
NCAAs.
"This year she's beating down
the doors to her full potential, and
that's rare because most people
don't even scratch the surface of
their full potentials. Lea's really
getting there because she's com
mitted to it. I think this year she's
finally beginning to believe just
how good she really is."
This year at the NCAA Cham
pionships, Loveless will enter as
the favorite in the 100-yard back

for the first time. Whitney
Hedgepeth, her freshman room
mate at Florida — who has since
transferred to Texas — will be her
main competitor, as she holds the
American record in the 200-yard
back.
"I want to establish myself as
the top 200 backstroker again this
year," Loveless said. "For the 100
back, everyone will be looking at
me as the one to beat since I have
the American record. I'd like to be
that person in the 200 as well, but
maybe it's good that I'm not. Tra
ditionally, I do well as an under
dog, so maybe I have that going
for me.
"My dad always told me, 'Your
friends don't need excuses and
your enemies don't believe them,' "
Loveless said. "And that's some
thing I try to live by."
Not making excuses includes
taking both the credit and the
blame for her performances,
despite what her boyfriend
thinks.
"I'm dating Erik Maurer, who
is 6-foot-8 and on the swim team,"
Loveless explains while laughing.
"He jokingly tells me, 'Give me all
the credit for anything you've
done, I deserve it.' " However, her
two Olympic medals and one
American record speak for them
selves, as they tell the tale of her
own personal triumph.
Quick said Loveless is "an
absolute delight to have around,"
and Stanford swimming fans will
be able to enjoy the senior for
another year, as she is petitioning
to pursue a coterminal degree in
education. She has another year
of eligibility left after redshirting
her sophomore year, and the for
mer dark horse may still have
some surprises to spring on the
swimming world.
