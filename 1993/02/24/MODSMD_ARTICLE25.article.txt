# Men's basketball wins, but nobody is around to witness it
## 
### 
The dam broke, water flowed and
everyone took a bath and liked it.
The few proud faithful in Maples
Pavilion on Saturday afternoon were able
to witness a memorable event. No, it
won't go down in the annals of history as
one of the greatest basketball games ever
played, nor will people tell their grand
children about it.
They might have told their neighbors
though, with copies of the box-score to
prove their story. Nevertheless, for the
first time since early January, the Stan
ford Band was able to play "All Right
Now" following a men's basketball game.
The final score was 78-62, and the home
team had the bigger number.
Rain fell from the sky last Saturday,
but who knew that those dark cloud for
mations would be an indicator of things
to come? Yes, the drought ended for the
Cardinal hoopsters, as points poured in
from names last successfully heard from
during last season. Everyone got in the
act. Peter Dukes made threes, Brent
Williams hit open shots and nice passes
from Marcus Lollie were finally able to be

counted as assists. A team effort was at
hand at last.
Unfortunately, most people on the
Farm did not see it. It was a dark day for
USC — having its NCAA Tournament
hopes dashed by a team that had previ
ously won only one game in the confer
ence. But even darker was the silence in
Maples before the game. It was remark
able that the Cardinal was able to reverse
its 10-game slide, given the lack of sup
port received from what should have
been a home crowd.
And the main people to blame for the
bare seats were the students. Five min
utes before game time, whole rows in the

student section were empty. Not patches,
not a row, but rows. At tipoff, a front-row
seat adjacent to Psycho Fan could still be
had. It was so bad that someone could
have ordered a pizza from Domino's and
asked that the pie be delivered to the stu
dent side — and the delivery boy would
have had no problem locating the hungry
individual: "So who had the pepperoni?"
For the UCLA game last Thursday night
— normally a sellout and one of the best
games of the year — Bruin fans outnum
bered Stanford fans, and were more vocal
to boot. In simple terms, this was an
embarrassment to Stanford. In front of an
ESPN national-television audience, the
gym had about as many people in it as prob
ably were found in the Coffee House. One
UCLA official actually went up to me and
asked, "Is it always this bad?" To my dis
may, I had to nod my head affirmatively.
Upon hearing the UCLA eight-clap,
culminating in "U-C-L-A fight-fight
fight," a reply from the Cardinal side of
"eat my shorts" was nowhere to be found.
Perhaps Stanford fans were washing their
shorts that night instead of supporting

their team. I guess using Tide was more
important to these people than helping
their team turn one in the right direction.
Saturday proved to be no different, at
least initially. I was convinced that the
Dollies and Yell Leaders had a good
chance to be counted in the official atten
dance figures. Yet as Stanford began to
increase its lead on the Trojans, a few
half-hearted folk strolled in and took
seats. After halftime, frustrated fans who
supposedly had found something "better
to do" on a rainy weekend afternoon
came in spurts after checking the score
on the radio. By the end, the student sec
tion was two-thirds full.
"When we came in there weren't a lot
of people there and at the end there were,
so I guess people heard we were winning
and came on down," Williams said.
But the point is, the stands should
have been full to start the game, rather
than end it. Maples seats 7,500, but only
2,581 were present — and that figure was
generous. There's no excuse for not going
to the game, especially when your reason
is to watch another game on television.

Your team needs your support — the
two teams on the television could care
less whether you're watching or not; the
only people you're helping by sitting on
your couch in front of the tube are the
advertisers. You don't even have to buy
tickets to go to Stanford's games, for
goshsakes — every student gets in free
with an ID card! Sure, the team this year
isn't as good as last year, but they still
represent our school. The players are try
ing their best, and they should be
applauded for doing so.
Granted it's not fun to watch a losing
effort, but Stanford students, where's
your loyalty? Stanford has participated in
postseason play for the last five seasons,
and has a good chance to return next sea
son. But that doesn't mean this year's
squad should be abandoned. The home
work assignment that would have been
put off if the team was 17-7 instead of 7-
17 should still be delayed.
If nothing else, you will get to see
future stars of the game. Jason Kidd, Ed

O'Bannon and Chris Mills will
most likely be in the NBA in a few
years, and you'll have to pay to
see them then. Why not see them
now for free, and cheer on your
school in the process? After all, 20
years from now, what will you
remember more, a basketball
game or a problem set? One week
from now, Stanford will play its
final homestand of the season.
Show some spirit and go to the

gym had about as many people in it as prob
ably were found in the Coffee House. One
UCLA official actually went up to me and
asked, "Is it always this bad?" To my dis
may, I had to nod my head affirmatively.
Upon hearing the UCLA eight-clap,
culminating in "U-C-L-A fight-fight
fight," a reply from the Cardinal side of
"eat my shorts" was nowhere to be found.
Perhaps Stanford fans were washing their
shorts that night instead of supporting

their team. I guess using Tide was more
important to these people than helping
their team turn one in the right direction.
Saturday proved to be no different, at
least initially. I was convinced that the
Dollies and Yell Leaders had a good
chance to be counted in the official atten
dance figures. Yet as Stanford began to
increase its lead on the Trojans, a few
half-hearted folk strolled in and took
seats. After halftime, frustrated fans who
supposedly had found something "better
to do" on a rainy weekend afternoon
came in spurts after checking the score
on the radio. By the end, the student sec
tion was two-thirds full.
"When we came in there weren't a lot
of people there and at the end there were,
so I guess people heard we were winning
and came on down," Williams said.
But the point is, the stands should
have been full to start the game, rather
than end it. Maples seats 7,500, but only
2,581 were present — and that figure was
generous. There's no excuse for not going
to the game, especially when your reason
is to watch another game on television.

Your team needs your support — the
two teams on the television could care
less whether you're watching or not; the
only people you're helping by sitting on
your couch in front of the tube are the
advertisers. You don't even have to buy
tickets to go to Stanford's games, for
goshsakes — every student gets in free
with an ID card! Sure, the team this year
isn't as good as last year, but they still
represent our school. The players are try
ing their best, and they should be
applauded for doing so.
Granted it's not fun to watch a losing
effort, but Stanford students, where's
your loyalty? Stanford has participated in
postseason play for the last five seasons,
and has a good chance to return next sea
son. But that doesn't mean this year's
squad should be abandoned. The home
work assignment that would have been
put off if the team was 17-7 instead of 7-
17 should still be delayed.
If nothing else, you will get to see
future stars of the game. Jason Kidd, Ed

O'Bannon and Chris Mills will
most likely be in the NBA in a few
years, and you'll have to pay to
see them then. Why not see them
now for free, and cheer on your
school in the process? After all, 20
years from now, what will you
remember more, a basketball
game or a problem set? One week
from now, Stanford will play its
final homestand of the season.
Show some spirit and go to the
games. You'll have a good time. I
promise.

David Schwartz has been to every
men's basketball game this aca
demic year. Yes, it's his job to do
so, but he would have gonp
regardless, because he's a Big
Fan. Honest.
The dam broke, water flowed and
everyone took a bath and liked it.
The few proud faithful in Maples
Pavilion on Saturday afternoon were able
to witness a memorable event. No, it
won't go down in the annals of history as
one of the greatest basketball games ever
played, nor will people tell their grand
children about it.
They might have told their neighbors
though, with copies of the box-score to
prove their story. Nevertheless, for the
first time since early January, the Stan
ford Band was able to play "All Right
Now" following a men's basketball game.
The final score was 78-62, and the home
team had the bigger number.
Rain fell from the sky last Saturday,
but who knew that those dark cloud for
mations would be an indicator of things
to come? Yes, the drought ended for the
Cardinal hoopsters, as points poured in
from names last successfully heard from
during last season. Everyone got in the
act. Peter Dukes made threes, Brent
Williams hit open shots and nice passes
from Marcus Lollie were finally able to be

counted as assists. A team effort was at
hand at last.
Unfortunately, most people on the
Farm did not see it. It was a dark day for
USC — having its NCAA Tournament
hopes dashed by a team that had previ
ously won only one game in the confer
ence. But even darker was the silence in
Maples before the game. It was remark
able that the Cardinal was able to reverse
its 10-game slide, given the lack of sup
port received from what should have
been a home crowd.
And the main people to blame for the
bare seats were the students. Five min
utes before game time, whole rows in the

student section were empty. Not patches,
not a row, but rows. At tipoff, a front-row
seat adjacent to Psycho Fan could still be
had. It was so bad that someone could
have ordered a pizza from Domino's and
asked that the pie be delivered to the stu
dent side — and the delivery boy would
have had no problem locating the hungry
individual: "So who had the pepperoni?"
For the UCLA game last Thursday night
— normally a sellout and one of the best
games of the year — Bruin fans outnum
bered Stanford fans, and were more vocal
to boot. In simple terms, this was an
embarrassment to Stanford. In front of an
ESPN national-television audience, the
gym had about as many people in it as prob
ably were found in the Coffee House. One
UCLA official actually went up to me and
asked, "Is it always this bad?" To my dis
