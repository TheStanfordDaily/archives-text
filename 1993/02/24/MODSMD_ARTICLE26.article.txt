# Sailors breeze by top-ranked teams

The Stanford sailors worked
the wind and the waves to their
advantage to leave their South
ern California competition wet
and winless in two Santa Bar
bara regattas this weekend.
The lOth-ranked Cardinal
ruled the weekend and handed
fourth-ranked UC-Irvine a wal
loping 47-point defeat Saturday
along with a 23-point loss on
Sunday. USC finished third
both days.
"It was very nice to go down
south and beat all the Southern
California teams — especially
Irvine — in their home
waters," said junior skipper
Scott Sellers.
Sellers and senior crewmate
Britt Johnson turned in an
unheard-of performance this
weekend, winning all the races
in their division Saturday and
all but one race Sunday.
"We just got into a streak,"
Sellers said. "We went out Sat
urday and saw that we were
faster than Irvine's number
one and we knew from there
that we could control them the
rest of the weekend."
Saturday's victory was a run
away, as the team had good per
formances from every sailor.
Coupled with a division victory
from Sellers and Johnson,
Junior Jeremy Mclntyre and
freshman crewmate Betsy
Kennedy won their division to

leave the competition behind.
Senior skipper John Emory and
junior crewmate Katherine
Chen took third in their division
while freshman skipper Lila
LaHood and freshman crew
mate Sibyl Diver tied for third.
Coach Blake Middleton said
one of the most impressive things
about this weekend was
LaHood's performance. "Lila had
the best regatta of her college
career. It was significant for the
win and is also a great sign for
our women's team," he added.
Stanford dominated the
Santa Barbara waters again Sun
day with first-place finishes in
both divisions from Sellers' and
Emory's boats. Mclntyre and
LaHood sealed the victory with
their respective fourth-place ties.
The Cardinal had the
advantage in the windy and
wavy waters of Santa Barbara,
because the southern teams
aren't used to the Bay-like con
ditions. In the big waves, even
traditional-powerhouse Irvine
was no match.
"We are at least equally
matched with them," Mclntyre
said. "They lacked downwind
speed ... they don't have the
technique and finesse (to take
advantage of the winds]," he
added.
The weekend victories were
particularly significant because
they came against three of the
highest-ranked teams in the
country, Middleton said. Irvine is
ranked fourth, USC is 16th, and
San Diego State (with fourth and
sixth-place finishes this weekend) is
No. 17. Stanford will battle all these
teams in the Pacific Coast Champi
onships this May, for a ticket to the
National Championships.

"I think this weekend's wins
send a real statement to our oppo
nents that Stanford has sailors
that are really capable of domi
nating," Middleton said.
Johnson said this weekend's
competition was good for the
team because it helps them focus
for the Pacific Coast Champi
onships and for the regatta at
Berkeley this coming weekend.
They not only saw the southern
competitors who they will face in

the Pacific Coast Champi
onships, but also got good prac
tice in windy Berkeley-like condi
tions.
Stanford must finish in the top
five in northern competition to
qualify for the Pacific Coast
Championships, but the sailors
are more interested in continuing
to beat Cal, according to Emory.
"We've beaten them and won the
North Series all the years I've
been here," he said.
