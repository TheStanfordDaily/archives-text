# Rugby obliterates Broncos on soaked field
## 
### Brian Brennan Staff writer 
Yesterday afternoon the Santa
Clara Broncos became the latest
victims of the Stanford men's rugby
team. With the 43-8 shellacking of
the Broncos, Stanford ran its
record to 5-0, putting itself in a tie
with California for first place in the
Northern California division.
Stanford took control from the
opening kickofT and never relin
quished it. After exchanging
penalty kicks in the opening min
utes, the bruising Cardinal attack
brought the ball down to the
Bronco five-meter line, where a
scrum was awarded to Santa
Clara.
The Cardinal pack promptly
won the ball and pushed the
Broncos back over the goal line,
with junior eight-man John
Girard touching the ball down for
the try. Fly-half Eric Fleckten's
successful conversion kick gave
Stanford a 10-3 advantage.
Coming off a stinging exhibi
tion loss to the University of Vic
toria, Stanford entered the game
burning to redeem themselves.
"We just watched the Canadians
run all over the field," said Coach
Franck Boivert. "Of course they
are going to kill us if they have no
one opposing them."
Coming into the game against
Santa Clara, the Cardinal players
were focused on hitting low and
hard to go forward on the tackle.
"We just wanted to ruck over
them and get the ball clean out to
the backs," Girard said.
Rains had reduced much of the
field to mud, and the difficult con
ditions led Stanford to pound the
ball straight ahead. This strategy
paid off, as senior prop Justin

Davis left three Bronco tacklers in
his wake en route to the try zone
and a 17-3 lead.
Minutes later, senior flanker
and former Stanford linebacker
Dan Byers lowered his shoulder
into would-be tacklers and forced
the ball down over the goal line.
Of the opposition, Byers claimed,

"I eat guys like (the Broncos] for
breakfast."
The Cardinal came out in the
second half ready to add on to its
30-3 lead, and senior wing Brian
Schultz took the lead early in the
period by taking the final pitch
after a strong series of ball pro
gressions.

"The forwards played a great
game," said senior wing Matt
Tripp. "They gave us a lot of balls,
and they were there to support
us."

two key injuries that could prove

ing just returned to the starting
lineup after suffering an early
season knee injury, scrum-half
Kevin Linker, rugby's version of
the quarterback, went down

under the pressure of two tack
lers on his troubled knee. His sta

Sophomore hooker Jeff
Freund left the game early as

that have plagued him all year.
His outlook remains bright, how
ever. "Usually it just takes a little
rest to get over the spasms,"
Freund said.

Stanford is scheduled to travel
to Sacramento State this Satur
day for a final tune-up before
rugby's version of the Big Game
on March 7. However, last year's
game against Sacramento was
marred by racial epithets directed
toward several Stanford players,
and unless an apology is received,
the Cardinal may not take the
field on Saturday.
