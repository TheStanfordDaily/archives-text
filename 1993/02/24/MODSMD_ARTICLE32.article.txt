# Illegal abortion explored in film
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Shuddering at stories of back
alleys, dirty knives and despera
tion, an audience of about 75 stu
dents gathered last night at
Tresidder to view the Academy
Award-nominated film "When
Abortion was Illegal: Untold Sto
ries."
Producer and director Dorothy
Fadiman, a Stanford graduate,
was present to tell her own story
and to lead a discussion about the
film, which looks at the personal
stories of women and doctors
involved in illegal abortions in a
historical context.
Introducing the 25-minute
film, which is the first in a series
of three documentaries address
ing illegal abortion, Fadiman
described the Academy Award
nomination as "a huge statement
about how far we've come in this
culture."
Approximately 75 students lis
tened to Fadiman tell of her own
illegal abortion as a Stanford stu
dent in the early '60s.
After paying $600, Fadiman

traveled to Reno, Nevada, where
she was blindfolded, taken to a
motel and given an illegal abor
tion without anesthetic.
She ended up in the intensive
care unit of the Stanford Hospi
tal, hemorrhaging and struggling
to stay alive.
"I made this film so that people
would understand not that abor
tion is a good idea, not that abor
tion is a desired choice, but that
when a woman is unhappily preg
nant, she will do anything to ter
minate the pregnancy," Fadiman
said.
In the post-film discussion,
Fadiman spoke about the difficul
ty finding women and doctors to
speak about their involvement in
illegal abortions.
"Everybody (who appeared in
the film) had to do some soul
searching before they were willing
to speak," Fadiman said.
She added that it was particu
larly difficult to find minority
women because of the "extra stig
ma attached to non-white
women" pursuing abortions.
While Fadiman says she feels
abortion rights are relatively safe

under President Bill Clinton, she
worries about the stipulation of
parental notification added to
some states' abortion laws and
the growing violence against
abortion clinics.
"There is a gro'-' . D musion
that we don't have to worry," said
Fadiman.
While Fadiman said she does
not want to "vindicate abortion,"
she stressed that she hopes that
women feel that they have options
and that they can speak out about
their decisions.
"Most of these (illegal) abor
tions were never recorded because
the women were afraid," Fadiman
said. "Nobody talked about abor
tion in those days."
Even today, Fadiman said, the
fight to educate society goes on.
"Just tonight, a woman — a
peer of yours — told me she knew
of several women in Stanford
dorms who had tried to abort
themselves," said Fadiman.
"This is a very frightening, real
issue."
The screening was part of the
ongoing Women's Herstory Cele
bration.
