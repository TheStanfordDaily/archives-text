# Former Soviet leader: Democracy will eventually prevail in Russia
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Declaring that "the convulsions
of Stalinism are over . .. it's dead,"
Alexander Yakovlev, widely consid
ered a chief architect of the reforms
which revolutionized the former
Soviet Union, addressed an audi
ence of about 300 last night in
Kresge Auditorium.
Yakovlev, who spoke through a
translator after a few opening
words in English, explained that
many Russians have become disil
lusioned with democracy just a
year after the fall of the Soviet
Union.
"All of us ... are asking our
selves one question â€” has democ
racy really won in Russia? Of
course it is a key question. And of
course it has won," Yakovlev said.
He pointed out that there is no
longer censorship and that the
country has so many political par
ties "that some are not known to
anybody."
He insisted that democracy can
work in Russia in spite of its histo
ry of violence. "Some degree of

democracy was always present in
Russian society. . . Genes of a
democratic heritage are there."
But, with democracy still
emerging in many parts of Russia,
Yakovlev warned that it is too early
to celebrate, adding that the society
is still in transition.
Part of the current problem,
Yakovlev said, is a "complex of
national inferiority," which has
fostered the rise of vocal right-wing
revolutionaries. But he discounted
the power of these extremists,
quoting public opinion polls which
pin their support at just around 10
percent.
A free press, Yakovlev added,
exacerbates the situation. "I cease
to read the newspaper in the morn
ing ... [otherwise] you can't get any
work done, because you sit waiting
for the civil war," he joked.
As Russians lose interest in
vocal political demagogues,
Yakovlev predicted that "centrist
politicians (will) start to prevail"
within three or four years. But
right now, "all scenarios are possi
ble and likely to a certain extent,"
Yakovlev said, noting that the West

is underestimating this threat.
Calling for increased help from
Western countries, he pointed out
that America spent a lot of money
to create stable European democ
racies after World War 11. "I'm not
talking about charity, just common
sense," he said, adding that a new
Cold War would be extremely
expensive.
The speaker acknowledged for
mer Secretary of State and Distin
guished Hoover Fellow George
Shultz, who was in the audience, as
a "great architect" of the current
U.S.-Russia relationship.
Yakovlev, appointed by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, currently
directs investigations of acts of
political repression carried out by
the former communist regime. He
previously held a post in the Soviet
Politburo.
Yakovlev's speech, titled "Rus
sia and the Skeptical Democracy,"
was the fifth annual Wesson Lec
ture in International Relations
Theory and Practice. Previous
speakers have included Mikhail
Gorbachev and Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
