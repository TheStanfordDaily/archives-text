# Multicultural Educator hired
## New administrator hails from Brown 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
After nine months and more
than 120 applications, the search
committee for a new multicultur
al educator has chosen Tommy
Lee Woon, an associate dean at
Brown University, to fill the posi
tion. He will begin work in early
June.
Woon, who also serves as direc
tor of Brown's Third World Cen
ter, said he is looking "to promote
a common experience while re
specting cultural difference in a
society of many different individ
uals."
"On the one level, [multicul
turalism is] community and un
derstanding of difference," he
said. "On the other hand, it's cre
ating a new playing field, a field
that allows people to come togeth

Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, the search commit
tee's chair, said the group
"found that [Woon] had lots of
relevant and exciting experience
that led us to believe that he has
the ability to come here to Stan-
ford and make a difference in the
community."
Citing Woon's experience at
other universities and in the
national Asian-American commu
nity, Jackson said the new multi
cultural educator is "forward
looking and creative."
Woon "has a broad back
ground in student affairs so he
will be able to contribute in many
areas: planning programs in the
dorms and some staff develop
ment programs," said Asst. Dean
of Students Frances Morales, the
director of El Centro Chicano.
"He has good interpersonal
skills so he will be able to work
with faculty, staff and students
well," she added.
Since 1990, Woon has directed
the Third World Center, a multi
cultural activities center for
Asian-American, Native-Ameri
can, black and Chicano/Latino
students. He also supervises a
residential minority peer-coun
seling program and coordinates a
mandatory orientation program
on diversity and pluralism.
Before working at Brown,
Woon served as assistant dean of
student support services and
director of Asian-American and
multicultural affairs at Oberlin
College, between 1987 and 1990.
He said he feels ready to take
on the position because of these
experiences. "I feel that I've had a
lot of contact and exposure to the
different groups in our country,
that I myself am bi-cultural and
bilingual," said Woon, who is Chi
nese-American and speaks the
Toisian dialect of the Chinese
language.
"My personal experiences have
a lot of breadth and depth across
cultures. I'm an advocate of
building alliances," he said. "I've
tried to take stands with groups
whose experience is different
than mine and make their causes
my causes."
Originally from San Mateo,
Woon said he is familiar with
Stanford. However, he said he

will talk to people to get a better
sense of the spirit of the Universi
ty as well as multicultural senti
ment on campus.
"I had an image of Stanford
that had undergone a tremen
dous transformation in the last
15 years and is in the midst of try
ing to manage that transforma
tion," said Woon, who plans to
focus on gender, sexual orienta
tion and disability issues as well
as race relations.
"What I'd like to do is organize
a menu of multicultural educa
tion activities and I'd like to ask
people what their skills are and
coordinate the human resources
there so we complement one
another," he said.
In addition, Woon said he will
look at the University Committee
on Minority Issues report. "I
appreciate that Stanford tried to
implement most of the UCMI . . .
but I think that plan has to be
reevaluated," he said.
Race not a factor
According to Jackson, the
search committee did not focus
on the ethnicity or gender of the
candidates when making their
decisions.
"We had 120-odd applications
and I would be hard-pressed to
tell you what color anyone was,"
he said, adding that he did not
know many of the candidates'
ethnicities until he met them in
person.
Jim Larimore, an assistant
dean of students and the director
of the Native American Commu
nity Center, said he felt there
might be a small shock at having
a new multicultural educator,
and that part of Woon's responsi
bility in the first few months
would be to meet people and
establish relationships.
"Any person we'd bring in
would approach the position with
his own style," he said. "Tommy
is very different from Greg in
some respects and similar in oth
ers. We'll go through a period of
mutual discovery."
However, Woon said he felt it
would not be hard to assume the
position. "I think it's much easier
to step in a position that's done

well and already has credibility
than to overcome a weak perfor
mance," said Woon. "I have the
ability to build on the good will
and respect that Greg Ricks cre
ated for the position."
Searching for the best
The multicultural educator
position has been vacant since
Ricks resigned May 12 to take a
job as vice president for education
and training at City Year, a non
profit "urban peace corps" in
Boston.
Jackson said he thought the
search did not take too long.
"When you have an important
position at a place like Stanford,
you have to do a thorough search
... so that people in the commu
nity know you have been as
thoughtful as you can in choosing
the right person," he said.
He said the national scope of
the search, summer vacation for
students on the committee and
the large number of applications
all contributed to the length of
the search.
In addition, Jackson said he
understood why Woon could not
start immediately. "I wouldn't
want somebody who could just
pick up and leave another school,"
he said. "I want someone who is a
most valuable person at another
school to come be a MVP here."
Jackson said he did not feel the
lack of a multicultural educator
during the search harmed the
University because "this position
is just one of the ways this Uni
versity has tried to emphasize
multicultural." But he added that
students and residence staff have
missed the level of programming
provided by Ricks.
In addition, Larimore said the
directors of the community cen
ters "have missed having some
one to convene meetings . . . hav
ing the time and ability to get
people together across different
organizations and communities."
"Student activities and house
programs are definitely an area
where there has been a differ
ence," he added. "Some people
have stepped in to run some pro
grams, but we still have felt an
absence."

his own style," he said. "Tommy
is very different from Greg in
some respects and similar in oth
ers. We'll go through a period of
mutual discovery."
However, Woon said he felt it
would not be hard to assume the
position. "I think it's much easier
to step in a position that's done

well and already has credibility
than to overcome a weak perfor
mance," said Woon. "I have the
ability to build on the good will
and respect that Greg Ricks cre
ated for the position."
Searching for the best
The multicultural educator
position has been vacant since
Ricks resigned May 12 to take a
job as vice president for education
and training at City Year, a non
profit "urban peace corps" in
Boston.
Jackson said he thought the
search did not take too long.
"When you have an important
position at a place like Stanford,
you have to do a thorough search
... so that people in the commu
nity know you have been as
thoughtful as you can in choosing
the right person," he said.
He said the national scope of
the search, summer vacation for
students on the committee and
the large number of applications
all contributed to the length of
the search.
In addition, Jackson said he
understood why Woon could not
start immediately. "I wouldn't
want somebody who could just
pick up and leave another school,"
he said. "I want someone who is a
most valuable person at another
school to come be a MVP here."
Jackson said he did not feel the
lack of a multicultural educator
during the search harmed the
University because "this position
is just one of the ways this Uni
versity has tried to emphasize
multicultural." But he added that
students and residence staff have
missed the level of programming
provided by Ricks.
In addition, Larimore said the
directors of the community cen
ters "have missed having some
one to convene meetings . . . hav
ing the time and ability to get
people together across different
organizations and communities."
"Student activities and house
programs are definitely an area
where there has been a differ
ence," he added. "Some people
have stepped in to run some pro
grams, but we still have felt an
absence."
After nine months and more
than 120 applications, the search
committee for a new multicultur
al educator has chosen Tommy
Lee Woon, an associate dean at
Brown University, to fill the posi
tion. He will begin work in early
June.
Woon, who also serves as direc
tor of Brown's Third World Cen
ter, said he is looking "to promote
a common experience while re
specting cultural difference in a
society of many different individ
uals."
"On the one level, [multicul
turalism is] community and un
derstanding of difference," he
said. "On the other hand, it's cre
ating a new playing field, a field
that allows people to come togeth

er.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, the search commit
tee's chair, said the group
"found that [Woon] had lots of
relevant and exciting experience
that led us to believe that he has
the ability to come here to Stan-
ford and make a difference in the
community."
Citing Woon's experience at
other universities and in the
national Asian-American commu
nity, Jackson said the new multi
cultural educator is "forward
looking and creative."
Woon "has a broad back
ground in student affairs so he
will be able to contribute in many
areas: planning programs in the
dorms and some staff develop
ment programs," said Asst. Dean
of Students Frances Morales, the
director of El Centro Chicano.
"He has good interpersonal
skills so he will be able to work
with faculty, staff and students
well," she added.
Since 1990, Woon has directed
the Third World Center, a multi
cultural activities center for
Asian-American, Native-Ameri
can, black and Chicano/Latino
students. He also supervises a
residential minority peer-coun
seling program and coordinates a
mandatory orientation program
on diversity and pluralism.
Before working at Brown,
Woon served as assistant dean of
student support services and
director of Asian-American and
multicultural affairs at Oberlin
College, between 1987 and 1990.
He said he feels ready to take
on the position because of these
experiences. "I feel that I've had a
lot of contact and exposure to the
different groups in our country,
that I myself am bi-cultural and
bilingual," said Woon, who is Chi
nese-American and speaks the
Toisian dialect of the Chinese
language.
"My personal experiences have
a lot of breadth and depth across
cultures. I'm an advocate of
building alliances," he said. "I've
tried to take stands with groups
whose experience is different
than mine and make their causes
my causes."
Originally from San Mateo,
Woon said he is familiar with
Stanford. However, he said he

will talk to people to get a better
sense of the spirit of the Universi
ty as well as multicultural senti
ment on campus.
"I had an image of Stanford
that had undergone a tremen
dous transformation in the last
15 years and is in the midst of try
ing to manage that transforma
tion," said Woon, who plans to
focus on gender, sexual orienta
tion and disability issues as well
as race relations.
"What I'd like to do is organize
a menu of multicultural educa
tion activities and I'd like to ask
people what their skills are and
coordinate the human resources
there so we complement one
another," he said.
In addition, Woon said he will
look at the University Committee
on Minority Issues report. "I
appreciate that Stanford tried to
implement most of the UCMI . . .
but I think that plan has to be
reevaluated," he said.
Race not a factor
According to Jackson, the
search committee did not focus
on the ethnicity or gender of the
candidates when making their
decisions.
"We had 120-odd applications
and I would be hard-pressed to
tell you what color anyone was,"
he said, adding that he did not
know many of the candidates'
ethnicities until he met them in
person.
Jim Larimore, an assistant
dean of students and the director
of the Native American Commu
nity Center, said he felt there
might be a small shock at having
a new multicultural educator,
and that part of Woon's responsi
bility in the first few months
would be to meet people and
establish relationships.
"Any person we'd bring in
would approach the position with
his own style," he said. "Tommy
is very different from Greg in
some respects and similar in oth
ers. We'll go through a period of
mutual discovery."
However, Woon said he felt it
