# Residence computer clusters to expand
## 
### Sarah Katz 
After several years of student
complaints, all undergraduate
residences will finally have their
own computer clusters by fall
1993, and graduate students in
Escondido Village and Crothers
Hall will have improved computer
service by fall 1994, according to
Jeff Merriman, the director of res
idential computing.
With a 50 percent increase in Res
idential Computing's operating bud
get, the number of residential com
puter clusters will double at the end
of the two-year expansion program.
All clusters which are not hooked up
to the University computer network
will be connected this summer.
There are currently 36 clusters,
which house a total of 220 com

puters. But many residences — in
cluding Row houses, the Suites
and Governor's Corner — still re
main unserved. In addition, there
are no facilities in Crothers and
only one cluster serving all of Es
condido Village.
By 1994, the number of com
puters in campus residences will
be increased to 330 in 72 different
locations.
Although Residential Comput
ing has been planning to increase
the number of computers in cam
pus residences for some time,
Housing and Food Services only
approved additional funds this
year, according to Merriman.
Residential Computing's yearly
budget of $280,000 will be increased
