# Residence computer clusters to expand
## 
### Sarah Katz 
After several years of student
complaints, all undergraduate
residences will finally have their
own computer clusters by fall
1993, and graduate students in
Escondido Village and Crothers
Hall will have improved computer
service by fall 1994, according to
Jeff Merriman, the director of res
idential computing.
With a 50 percent increase in Res
idential Computing's operating bud
get, the number of residential com
puter clusters will double at the end
of the two-year expansion program.
All clusters which are not hooked up
to the University computer network
will be connected this summer.
There are currently 36 clusters,
which house a total of 220 com

puters. But many residences — in
cluding Row houses, the Suites
and Governor's Corner — still re
main unserved. In addition, there
are no facilities in Crothers and
only one cluster serving all of Es
condido Village.
By 1994, the number of com
puters in campus residences will
be increased to 330 in 72 different
locations.
Although Residential Comput
ing has been planning to increase
the number of computers in cam
pus residences for some time,
Housing and Food Services only
approved additional funds this
year, according to Merriman.
Residential Computing's yearly
budget of $280,000 will be increased
by $177,0Q0, with a total of
$422,000 over the next two years
being used to purchase computer
equipment and cluster facilities.
Merriman said some of the
increased funding will also pay the
salaries of new RCCs and extra
office staff.
Preparing for the budget cuts
before they were actually
announced, Residential Educa
tion ended up saving more money
than the cuts demanded through
departmental streamlining. Mer
riman, in an earlier interview,
said the leftover funds will be des
ignated for Residential Comput
ing.
The expansion will provide
clusters consisting of two com
puters and a printer in each of
the Row and Governor's Corner
houses. The Suites will get a
central cluster, Crothers will
receive one new cluster and
Escondido Village will end up
with a total of 30 computers in
three clusters.
In addition, the number of
resident computer coordinators
will increase by eight, to 41.
Although Residential Computing
is still determining where extra
RCCs will be needed, it is likely
that there will be "neighborhood
RCC" positions on the Row, said
Merriman, adding that this prob
lem should be solved before RCC
selections are made next week.
Merriman said students have
been asking for this expansion for
a while, through residence sur
veys, mail and telephone calls.
"Computing is so important to

academic work now ... if you've
ever talked to a student who lives
on the Row, you know" that there
is a dire need for this project, said
Merriman, adding that the aim of
this project was really "to increase
the equity of the system."
But Merriman also stressed
that the new computers will be
"low-end," consisting mainly of
Macintosh LCIIs and new LCIIIs,
rather than the more advanced
Quadras. "The real need was for
basic level computing," he
explained.
Expanding the number of com
puter clusters is actually part of a
larger, three-phase process,
which began in 1985, to make res
idences more computer-friendly.
Plans are also in the works,
through this program, to connect
network wires to all student
rooms. "We hope to have
[SU]Net wires brought into
every room within five years,"
said Merriman. But he cautioned
that Residential Computing only
has enough funds to install the
wires. Additional money will be
needed to activate them and pay
for their upkeep. And while the
exact amount has not yet been
determined, Merriman warned
that the activation will "cost a
lot."
Finally, as more students get
low-end computers of their own,
Residential Computing hopes to
gradually make the clusters a
place for higher level models.
According to a survey done
last year, "Fifty-seven percent
of all students own a computer,"
Merriman said. "At some point,
that number will get so high
that people will just need higher
level computers in the clusters."
