# New committee will search for next H&S dean
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Kicking off the search for a new dean of Human
ities and Sciences, Provost Gerald Lieberman has
appointed a committee of 10 faculty members and
two students.
Lieberman and Psychology Prof. Amos Tversky
will chair the committee, in its search for a tenured
faculty member to take over Sept. 1 as the school's
top academic officer.
"Now the main objective is getting input," said
graduate student Kevin Murdock, a committee
member. "We're really not in a decision-making
phase." He said the group, which met for the first
time Monday, will probably meet about once a
week, at least during the first part of the search.
Tversky refused to comment on the committee's
plans. Senior Jason Snyder, the second student
member, also said he could not talk about the search.
"We agreed that nothing at all would be said
about it at this point," Snyder added.
The current dean, Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas, announced last month that he will step
down Aug. 31. During his five years in the position,
he has been credited with maintaining a strong fac
ulty and weathering the recent budget crunch.
Thomas plans to devote his time to teaching and
research after ending his term in the dean's office.
Drawn from 10 different departments, faculty
members on the search committee are: Malcolm
Beasley, John Bender, Donald Brown, Peter Duus,
John Etchemendy, Terry Karl, Carolyn Springer,
Arthur Walker, Robert Waymouth and Sylvia
Yanagisako.
Recommendations for the posi
tion may be made by faculty, staff
or students. They must be sub

mitted to the provost's office by
March 12.
When he or she takes over Sept.
1, the new dean will approve three
deputy deans recommended by
faculty search committees under a
new structure created last month.
The deputy deans — each of
whom will supervise one area,

Humanities, Social Sciences or
Natural Sciences — will replace
five part-time associate deans.
Creating the new positions will
bolster the authority of the deans
and "increase their legitimacy,"
University President Gerhard
Casper said when announcing the
change Jan. 21.
