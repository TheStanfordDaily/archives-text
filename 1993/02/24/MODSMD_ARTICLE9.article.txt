10,000 protest Yeltsin
MOSCOW (AP) — Rallying behind
red flags and portraits of Lenin, more
than 10,000 supporters of Communism
marched to the Kremlin yesterday to
denounce President Boris Yeltsin and
urge the military to rise against him.
"The walls of the Kremlin are not
shaking from our cries. The people inside
are shaking!" hard-line legislator Sergei
Baburin declared to the biggest pro-
Communist demonstration in months.
Yeltsin was on vacation at his country
home outside Moscow at the time.
Two years ago, there were equally
large protests by Yeltsin supporters. But
the streets were virtually surrendered to
pro-Communists this year and last year.

The rally came on Defenders of the
Fatherland Day, formerly known as
Soviet Armed Forces Day.
Skiers safe in Colorado
ASPEN, Colo. (AP) — Five skiers who
survived four nights of subzero weather
and avalanche danger in mountain back
country turned up alive and in good con
dition yesterday.
Two of them walked into a trading
post and called authorities from a pay
phone shortly before noon. Several
hours later, a helicopter found the oth
ers in the mountain wilderness.
Dozens of rescuers had mounted an
intensive, three-day search of the rugged
back country between here and Gunni
son, 45 miles south.
