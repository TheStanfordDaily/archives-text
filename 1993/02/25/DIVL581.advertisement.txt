THE PIG GETS IT.
Actually, the poor fellow
is better known as the boar
whose snout appears on the
Wiinhard's
Ale label.
It's in your hands. Pur
chase these all-cotton,
genuine Blue Boar Brand
T-shirts and the pig will live out his
life happily digging for truffles. Avail
able in XL to fit everybody. (Clockwise
from top left; "Hip Hops", "Irish
Snout", "Green Shamrock")
The same
boar that's
become a
symbol, an
icon, a lov
able pet.
And if T
shirts aren't
purchased
soon, said boar might end
up as a plate of ribs, forc
ing us to completely redo
the ale label.
So if you have a heart and
you're the type who likes to
hang out with a Weinhard's
Ale now and then, we hope
you'll fork over the
dough and purchase
one or more of our
remarkably cool T
shirts featured in this
ad (they are the official
hanging out apparel
this season).
