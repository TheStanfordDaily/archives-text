Proposed legislation to
give donors tax breaks
will help the University

Amid the painful tax
increases and spending cuts
proposed by President Clin
ton last week is a one-line proposal
buried in the administration's
budget plans that could provide a
spoonful of much-needed medicine
for Stanford.
Included in the president's tax
plans is a measure that would rein
state a tax break for those who
donate appreciated property to
charitable organizations, including
colleges and universities.
Appreciated property, which
includes gifts such as artwork, land
and stocks, makes up nearly 40 per
cent of gifts to Stanford each year.
By allowing donors to deduct
appreciated gifts to colleges and
universities, the Clinton adminis
tration and Congress could take a
significant step toward aiding
cash-strapped educational institu
tions, without increasing govern
ment spending.
Currently, the tax law provides
no incentive for people to donate
appreciated assets to charitable
institutions. For example, let's say
a particularly well-to-do alumnus
wished to make a donation of cor
porate stocks to the University
that he bought many years ago for
$20,000. Even if the stocks are
currently worth $100,000, he
would only be able to deduct the
$20,000 purchase price from his
taxes.
But with the proposed change,
the donor would be able to deduct
the current appreciated value of
his gift â€” in this case, $100,000.
Since 1987, when the stricter
law went into effect, universities
nationwide have reported substan
tial decreases in major gifts.
Harvard's Office of Govern
ment, Community and Public
Affairs has chronicled these lost

gifts of appreciated property, not
ing losses in the millions for vari
ous universities. A university in
the Southeast lost out on a $2.5
million stock donation that was to
fund a new student-services center
because the donor would have
received almost no tax savings.
And at Stanford, officials in the
Office of Development say they
have plenty of evidence of changes
after 1987. When an 18-month
exemption for tangible property,
such as works of art, was granted
in 1991-92, the University saw an
increase in donations to the muse
um. In fact, both an $11.6 million
gift of Rodin sculptures and the
donation of the huge Anderson
print collection was finalized just
weeks before the exemption ended
in June 1992.
Last year, a measure to rein
state the exemption passed both
the Senate and the House as part
of the 1992 tax bill, but was vetoed
by President Bush.
Now, with Clinton's support,
the measure has another chance at
life. And those concerned about
the future of higher education
should fight to elevate this propos
al from a tiny afterthought in bud
get proposals to a fundamental ele
ment of both higher education and
tax reform.
Although this exemption is far
from a panacea for the budget
woes facing Stanford and other
universities nationwide, the mea
sure would pave the way for
increased donations.
For the 1992-93 fiscal year, gifts
were projected to contribute $18.5
million to Stanford's operating
budget. Increased donations will
hopefully translate into sorely
needed revenue for the University.
If the Clinton administration
and Congress are serious about
improving higher education, they
should start where the money
already exists. Enacting a tax
break for people who donate
appreciated property will cost the
government relatively little, but
universities across the country
would stand to reap great benefits.
