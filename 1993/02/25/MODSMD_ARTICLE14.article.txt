Conservative feminists are a refreshing change from left

OVER THE LAST WEEK, both
The Stanford Review and The
Daily have run columns on con
servative feminism (Feb. 22 and Feb.l7).
I applaud Stanford's thoughtful female
columnists, Lisa Koven and Tish
Williams, for enlightening this campus
on the alternative to the hard-core liber
al left's radical, destructive feminist ide
ology. These comments on conservative
feminism were very timely and truthful.
Considering both publications have
endorsed this issue, it would seem con
servative feminism is not a part of a
larger political agenda, and that our rad
ical feminist friends might be just howl
ing into the wind. An undeniable tenet
of being feminine, and being human for

that matter, conservativism might actu
ally yield higher returns in today's world
than "bucking" the system, as both
columnists imply.
It is refreshing to know Williams was
a tomboy instead of a debutante and
that she can "roar" rather than accuse.
A realistic viewpoint, although not too
common, will shine brightly here at our
ideological fantasyland. However, I
believe the masculine perspective
deserves consideration, not because I
need to "get even," but because it
enhances Koven's and Williams' argu
ments.
The basic thesis is that men do not
like women who make them feel uncom
fortable, mostly because men do not

want to compete with women in rela
tionships. Silly as it may sound, relation
ships should be built on mutual respect.
Because we all have a basic need for dig
nity in companionship, Williams is cor
rect in disagreeing with the "man
equals-enemy" theory.
Unfortunately, at Stanford, the West
Coast home of political correctness, a
man can only fear the random applica
tion of the label "sexist" when he
approaches a woman for the first time.
Contrary to "popular" belief at Stanford,
men have been stifled in espousing their
masculinity precisely due to, in Koven's
words, "the fear that they may be
accused of sexism."
In today's dating world, where one

must "sell the best product, or sit on the
shelf," it is hard to imagine how men
can be masculine, let alone act naturally
toward females, if society demeans mas
culinity as evil. Certainly, although
often argued by liberals, this country's
biggest fault is not that it is "male domi
nated" â€” that argument is a slap in the
face to all dedicated American women
who have done so much to change "tra
ditional" ways.
I extend my congratulations to Koven
and Williams for noticing an issue avoid
ed by many feminists, either because the
feminist left is too afraid or too proud to
consider men as "equals."
