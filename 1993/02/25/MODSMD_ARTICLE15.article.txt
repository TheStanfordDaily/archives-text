# Youths need to accept realities of future and must plan for sacrifice

President Casper's proposal to save
money through a three-year bachelor's
degree raises a question which few here
are prepared to face.
The main problem confronting the
entire Western world is how to square a
growing social concern (welfare, mass
education at high levels, unemployment
benefits, massive immigration) with cap
ital formation and individual achieve
ment based on born talent, family cir
cumstances, motivation and work.
The difficulty of balancing these theo
retically infinite, opposite (or rather,
perpendicular) claims is evident every
where: new restrictions on immigration
and deepening budget cuts throughout
welfarist Europe are echoed by the
widespread reservations about Clinton's
populist, redistributionist economic pro
gram.
Our students and faculty, mostly lib
eral even as they remain ambitious per

sonally, are particularly torn by this
dilemma, which is becoming more acute
before our eyes. Already the pressure on
staff and faculty, compounded by the
Kennedy-era financial follies, has
become too great even for physical
health, and I personally know of people
who have suffered visibly from the
stress.
But, such is the power of political cor
rectness, and almost no one is willing to
admit that it might be better to sacrifice
some of our generosity (very often misdi
rected, as Thomas Sowell has shown)
toward less-qualified students, and pre
serve a high-level and unpressured edu
cational atmosphere for the capable
(including less-affluent but intellectually
superior students).
As of now, with 60 percent of stu
dents being helped financially and costs
rising, no wonder our beleaguered new
president is making desperate sugges
tions leading probably nowhere.
The future of this place is on the line:
either we stop calling "right wing" (or
even "fascist") what are reasoned and
reasonable efforts to bring the social and
the individual into a healthy balance —
by sane definition a "centrist" position

— or we write a ticket for breakdown.
The Utopian dreams of young people
are all very lovely, but so were the early
Soviet ones I fell for at that age. Occa
sionally the times make us grow up
brusquely.
