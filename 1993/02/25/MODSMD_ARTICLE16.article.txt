# Sexism is prevalent at Stanford, moves must be made to eliminate it
## 
### 
I am a First-year graduate student in
the Chemical Engineering Department. I
am writing with regard to the prevalent
sexism on this campus.
When I made the decision to pursue a
Ph.D. degree at Stanford, I was looking
forward to being at an intellectually
stimulating, beautifully landscaped,
peaceful place.
The last thing I expected at Stanford
were the numerous incidences of subtle
and sometimes blunt forms of sexism. I
was told several times by male under
graduate students that instead of study

ing, I should consider getting married
and having babies.
Others have told me that women are
not exactly cut out for getting Ph. D.sin
engineering.
I am very saddened by the fact that
just because I am a woman, I have many
times been discouraged from what I set
out to do. The fact that I am of Korean
origin may have made me more vulnera
ble to attacks due to many stereotypes
people have of Asian women.
I think what we need is education and
more awareness towards sexism on cam
pus. It may be a good idea for the admin
istration to encourage students to take a
course in Women's Studies. Also, I think
it will help a lot if all new students are
required to attend one or two sessions
designed to make them more tolerant
towards members of a different sex and
race.
I believe that someday Stanford will
be a place where people of many differ
ent backgrounds come together to pur
sue the common goal of higher educa
tion and elimination of any ugly residu
als from our past, such as sexism.
