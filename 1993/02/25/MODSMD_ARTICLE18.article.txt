# Why are blacks so violent ?
## 
### 
IN THE WINTER edition of "Diversi
ty & Division," there is a story called
"The Violent Gene" which brings to
light the current polemic on the link
between genetics and violent behavior.
The article basically supports the vio
lence initiative, a federally funded pro
gram to study human genes to see if
there is some type of complex web of
genetics and environmental factors that
makes black people more violent than
others. They claim this study is needed
because blacks make up a disproportion
ate number of those in jail.
Historically, we have been forced to
discuss the causality of human behavior
in terms of "nature versus nurture." But
inevitably you will get to a point where
you can't separate the two, and will con
clude that human behavior is a combina
tion of both. Still the problem exists that
Western logic's pattern of study says that
if you can't measure something, you
can't empirically prove it. Since nature is
the only thing we can quantifiably mea
sure and prove, it has become the main
focus.
However, beyond this debate lies the
consciousness that socializes us into see
ing normal humanness as being white
and the other extreme, the genetically
defective human, as being black.
One of the proponents for the vio
lence-initiative research, Dr. Frederick
Goodwin, stressed that to begin to under

stand the chaos in the inner cities, schol
ars could observe the behavioral patterns
of apes in the wild. He said last year that
when studying the aggressive behavior of
apes, he noted that the natural way for
the apes to survive is by killing one
another.
The article then says that Goodwin
didn't intend a racist comparison
between black men and apes, but that
"his essential analysis — that urban
chaos has removed enough social rules to
push people away from society's organiz
ing principles — remains accurate."
What these fools fail to see here is that
it is society's organizing principles that 1)
put people in socioeconomic categories to
begin with and 2) socialize everyone else
to think there is something inherently
wrong with the disadvantaged.
In the article, Deborah Denno, a pro
fessor at Fordham University, is quoted
as saying "There are a lot of problems
with studying violence and genetics, but
that's not to say no link exists or that we
shouldn't study a possible link."
Such a study would use the white
genetic stock as the control group and
would search for some type of defect in
the black stock. Researchers who advo
cate this study now argue that such a
finding wouldn't mean that blacks have
a "violence gene," but rather are more
susceptible to violence due to this
defect.

Now before I go ranting and raving
about the inherent racist nature of this
mode of thinking, let's take a look at the
double standards and hypocrisy of it. I
don't remember any black physicist
designing the hydrogen bomb or any
black people lynching whites in the South
or any black Ted Bundys or Jeffrey Dah
mers. So why are blacks being viewed,
and consequently studied, as being so vio
lent? And, for that matter, how about the
number of violent sexual assaults by men
towards women, as opposed to the num
ber of women perpetrators. Is the gov
ernment spending millions of dollars on
genetic research to see why whites and
men are so violent?
Considering these numbers maybe
they should:
Homicides due to gang-related violence in
L.A. County, 1992: 800+
Deaths of Iraqi civilians during Gulf War,
1991: 100,000

Kwame Yao Anku doesn't think that any
race is inherently more violent but that as
human subjects we have been socialized
to legitimize violence as a suitable means
of solving conflicts.
