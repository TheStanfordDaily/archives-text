# Teaching program scrutinized after comment prompts anger
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Tensions ignited by an overheard re
mark have caused the School of Educa
tion to examine whether its teacher
training program fails to deal with issues
of diversity in both its admissions and
curriculum.
Faculty and administrators are dis
cussing possibly restructuring of the
Stanford Teacher Education Program,
an intensive 12-month course that offers
secondary school credentials as well as a
master's in education.
STEP is a "troubled program" that
has not kept pace as its student body has

become larger and more diverse, and has
not addressed problems of "urban educa
tion" facing today's teachers, said School
of Education Dean Nel Noddings.
The examination of the program, ac
cording to Prof. Lee Shulman, was trig
gered by an incident last week in which
STEP director Grace Grant was over
heard saying that the way to reconcile
differences between program partici
pants might be to screen applicants for
their ideologies.
Shulman, who teaches a course in the
program, said Grant was talking to him
when she made the remark, and that it
was misconstrued because it was "made
out of exasperation and in no way in

tended to become policy."
The comment was made after an "im
passioned exchange" in a class during
which a student said STEP should not
only address "how to teach, but to teach
[STEP students] how to change society,"
Shulman said.
Grant referred questions to Noddings
earlier this week and did not return
phone calls yesterday.
Untrue rumors have spread that
Grant wanted to keep "radical students
of color" out of the program, said STEP
Asst. Director Gary Lichtenstein.
While Grant has apologized in writing
and in several small and large
group meetings with STEP stu
dents, many are still concerned
with the attitudes they feel the
comment reflects.
"My concern is that something
is happening within the STEP
program that the statement came
out sounding like that," said pro
gram participant Vorakarn
Chanyavanich.
"In my opinion, the program
director shouldn't — even in
exasperation and in a private con
versation — say something like
that," he continued. "The pro
gram has professed its commit
ment to multiculturalism and
this is like a slap in the face."
Noddings said she formally

met with the students Monday to
discuss their concerns. While
Grant acknowledged responsibili
ty for the comment, Noddings
said, "the idea that [screening]
was actually going to happen was
ridiculous, and she never wanted
it to."
Shulman said students have
been concerned about issues of
urban education, and that the
program in its current form was
not addressing problems that face
teachers in lower-income commu
nities.
As a part of STEP, students
teach at local schools, and the
question was raised of "how to
teach in East Palo Alto, where
gunshots are an everyday occur
rence," Shulman said.
In response, Noddings said she
has arranged for students of color
to be a part of the admissions pro
cess and a student group to meet

with her twice a week about the
progress of STEP.
Shulman said he has realized
the program must evolve to meet
the needs of the changing student
body and suggested that multiple
programs might be ideal.
"If we are going to be honest
with ourselves, one program is
not going to do," he said. "To
have a single program that
assumes one experience for all
students is a mistake — maybe
not a mistake when it was first
created, but it is now."
STEP student Ted Uno said
although students are acting in
good faith and realize the faculty
and administration "have reis
sued [their] commitment to mul
ticulturalism," the students are
still "wary and dissatisfied."
The incident with Grant was
"indicative of problems that are a
part of a program not prepared to

handle people of color," Uno said.
Much of the problem stemmed
from STEP trying to "handle"
them and "not asking what [they]
want."
While Grant has apologized on
several occasions for the com
ment, program participant Susie
Wu said Grant has been ambigu
ous about what she actually said.
Jennifer Dearborn, also a
STEP student, expressed a slight
ly different view of the program.
While she said the experience has
been "socially broadening" for
her as a white person, recent
events have made STEP a "gener
ally unpleasant and scary place to
be."
"It's unfortunate people come
into the program not wanting to
teach kids," said Dearborn, who
added that she does not condemn
Grant. "Some people seem to be
here to perpetuate social agendas
