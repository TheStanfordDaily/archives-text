# Teaching program scrutinized after comment prompts anger

Tensions ignited by an overheard re
mark have caused the School of Educa
tion to examine whether its teacher
training program fails to deal with issues
of diversity in both its admissions and
curriculum.
Faculty and administrators are dis
cussing possibly restructuring of the
Stanford Teacher Education Program,
an intensive 12-month course that offers
secondary school credentials as well as a
master's in education.
STEP is a "troubled program" that
has not kept pace as its student body has

become larger and more diverse, and has
not addressed problems of "urban educa
tion" facing today's teachers, said School
of Education Dean Nel Noddings.
The examination of the program, ac
cording to Prof. Lee Shulman, was trig
gered by an incident last week in which
STEP director Grace Grant was over
heard saying that the way to reconcile
differences between program partici
pants might be to screen applicants for
their ideologies.
Shulman, who teaches a course in the
program, said Grant was talking to him
when she made the remark, and that it
was misconstrued because it was "made
out of exasperation and in no way in

tended to become policy."
The comment was made after an "im
passioned exchange" in a class during
which a student said STEP should not
only address "how to teach, but to teach
[STEP students] how to change society,"
Shulman said.
Grant referred questions to Noddings
earlier this week and did not return
phone calls yesterday.
Untrue rumors have spread that
Grant wanted to keep "radical students
of color" out of the program, said STEP
Asst. Director Gary Lichtenstein.
While Grant has apologized in writing
