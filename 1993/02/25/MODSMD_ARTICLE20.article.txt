Middle East Focus has blurred vision, destructive effect on community

The Stanford community has tradi
tionally taken pride in its dedication to
bridging the distances between different
peoples. Particularly in the context of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, students and faculty
members have striven to engage in a con
structive dialogue, looking for common
ground and understanding, hoping these
efforts will ultimately lead to peace.
Thus, groups like the Jewish Student
Association and the Organization of Arab
Students In Stanford have taken positive
steps toward improving relations among
their members. For example, OASIS and
JSA co-hosted a dinner last year at the
home of then-President Donald
Kennedy. The Hillel Foundation spon
sored an exhibit of drawings by Arab and
Israeli children, depicting their idea of
co-existence. And the Israeli Student
Organization has approached OASIS to
suggest that they jointly screen a movie
on the search for peace.
On the academic side, the Stanford Cen
ter on Conflict Resolution helped devise an
internationally acclaimed Israeli-Palestini
an co-habitation plan. And many students
invest much of their time researching con
fidence-building measures that might
revive the Mideast peace talks.
Because of this, it is very disturbing to
fmd that an organization has risen up to
be deliberately confrontational, hostile and
misleading about its intent. In the last
three weeks, a group that dubiously calls
itself the "Stanford Middle East Focus"
wrote a series of letters to The Daily con
taining serious factual distortions; invited
an individual known for inflammatory
accusations about Nazi conspiracies with
the founders of the Jewish state to talk
about his anti-Israeli views; hosted anoth
er anti-Israeli speaker, who misstated his
torical facts to strengthen her arguments;
and bought space in The Daily with the
singular objective of criticizing Israel. See
adjoining box.
"Stanford Middle East Focus" is an
inaccurate title for this group because
MEF's actions, and the intentions that
these evince, are not to focus on the
Middle East in an objective, detached

manner, but to attack Israel and every
thing it stands for. From my experi
ence, MEF seems to be singularly
interested in undermining Israel and
its supporters, even if in the process it
destroys relations that have taken a
long time to build.
I have never heard the Middle East
Focus "focus" on human-rights violations
by any other country or actor in the Near
East, or talk positively about the peace
overtures that the Israeli government
takes. All I've seen it do is attack the Jew
ish state. And sadly, its proclamations
lack any constructive character, since they
seem to be always blinded by extremism.
If MEF is going to exert its efforts to con
demn Israel, then at least it should be
forthcoming and switch to a more befit
ting name: The Anti-Israel Task Force.
MEF's title makes the organization seem
objective, scholarly and reputable.
One would expect that a zealous orga
nization like MEF might be tempted to
exaggerate facts or distort events to
advance its cause. This is inexcusable.
That is no way to conduct the affairs of
an organization that purports to be
objective, particularly in an academic set
ting. Prof. Joel Beinin, whose criticisms
of Israel are well known on campus,
leads MEF. Together, Beinin and MEF
make Jewish and non-Jewish supporters
of Israel feel ostracized. Every time
Beinin or MEF sponsors an activity, I get
phone calls from students who are trou
bled by virulent anti-Israel accusations,
but who worry about challenging Beinin.
Not once has Hillel or any other pro-
Israel organization at Stanford dedicat
ed its resources and energy to attack
another people. Activities are concilia
tory, affirmative steps in search of
peace or positive reflections on ways to
get there. If an academic debate is
sponsored, an effort is made to make it
intellectually stimulating and to probe
into ways to resolve the conflict. There
may be occasions when pro-Israel
groups on campus take a defensive pos
ture, and explain their positions, but
never are unrelenting attacks on anoth-

er nation or ethnic group made. As far
as I know, the same is true for OASIS,
and for the vast majority of student
organizations at Stanford. Their goal is
to be constructive and to search for
common ground.
In contrast, MEF pretends to act in
the name of "truth" as a way to attack a
country incessantly, seeking not peace

but hostility toward a nation, not fair
ness but humiliation, not rapproche
ment but segregation. Unless it sheds
this bias, it threatens to become no more
than a propaganda organ. The Stanford
community should ignore MEF, and
instead channel all of its energies to
more productive, forward-looking, posi
tive events.

It would be sad if an organization like
MEF were to alter Stanford's atmo
sphere and turn the search for common
ground into an endless exercise in recip
rocal accusations. The bridges that have
taken so long to be built must not be
brought down.

Middle East in an objective, detached

manner, but to attack Israel and every
thing it stands for. From my experi
ence, MEF seems to be singularly
interested in undermining Israel and
its supporters, even if in the process it
destroys relations that have taken a
long time to build.
I have never heard the Middle East
Focus "focus" on human-rights violations
by any other country or actor in the Near
East, or talk positively about the peace
overtures that the Israeli government
takes. All I've seen it do is attack the Jew
ish state. And sadly, its proclamations
lack any constructive character, since they
seem to be always blinded by extremism.
If MEF is going to exert its efforts to con
demn Israel, then at least it should be
forthcoming and switch to a more befit
ting name: The Anti-Israel Task Force.
MEF's title makes the organization seem
objective, scholarly and reputable.
One would expect that a zealous orga
nization like MEF might be tempted to
exaggerate facts or distort events to
advance its cause. This is inexcusable.
That is no way to conduct the affairs of
an organization that purports to be
objective, particularly in an academic set
ting. Prof. Joel Beinin, whose criticisms
of Israel are well known on campus,
leads MEF. Together, Beinin and MEF
make Jewish and non-Jewish supporters
of Israel feel ostracized. Every time
Beinin or MEF sponsors an activity, I get
phone calls from students who are trou
bled by virulent anti-Israel accusations,
but who worry about challenging Beinin.
Not once has Hillel or any other pro-
Israel organization at Stanford dedicat
ed its resources and energy to attack
another people. Activities are concilia
tory, affirmative steps in search of
peace or positive reflections on ways to
get there. If an academic debate is
sponsored, an effort is made to make it
intellectually stimulating and to probe
into ways to resolve the conflict. There
may be occasions when pro-Israel
groups on campus take a defensive pos
ture, and explain their positions, but
never are unrelenting attacks on anoth-

er nation or ethnic group made. As far
as I know, the same is true for OASIS,
and for the vast majority of student
organizations at Stanford. Their goal is
to be constructive and to search for
common ground.
In contrast, MEF pretends to act in
the name of "truth" as a way to attack a
country incessantly, seeking not peace

but hostility toward a nation, not fair
ness but humiliation, not rapproche
ment but segregation. Unless it sheds
this bias, it threatens to become no more
than a propaganda organ. The Stanford
community should ignore MEF, and
instead channel all of its energies to
more productive, forward-looking, posi
tive events.

It would be sad if an organization like
MEF were to alter Stanford's atmo
sphere and turn the search for common
ground into an endless exercise in recip
rocal accusations. The bridges that have
taken so long to be built must not be
brought down.
