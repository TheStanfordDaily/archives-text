# Letters of evidence on ‘misstated historical facts'

Disingenuous Letters
A man named Hilton Obenzinger
wrote a less-than-candid letter to The
Daily, in which he accused the Anti-
Defamation League of spying and stat
ed that the San Francisco police were
investigating the ADL. Both state
ments are plain lies.
The ADL is a not-for-profit pillar of
human freedom. It works to fight big
otry directed toward any religious, social
or ethnic minority. The ADL does moni
tor extremist groups. It was founded for
the very purpose of combating anti
semitism, racism and extremism.
Some research into Obenzinger can
explain why, as he acknowledges, the
ADL is concerned about him. An
activist in the November 29 Commit
tee, he actually charged the founders of
Israel with "tr[ying] to strike a deal
with Hitler ... to get the Nazis to
agree to the formation of a totalitarian
Jewish state in return for taking part
in the war on the German side."
(Phoenix Gazette, Oct. 13, 1986).
Disingenuous Speakers.
MEF invited Obenzinger and Bar
bara Lubin of the Middle East Chil
dren's Alliance to speak on campus.
MECA's primary goal is to create a neg
ative image of Israel. It does this by hid
ing under the aegis of children's rights,
thereby allowing it to promulgate its
anti-Israeli platform unabashedly.

Eighty to 90 percent of what MECA
writes to prospective donors is purely
dedicated to criticizing Israel. MECA
practically ignores the mistreatment of
children unless it is allegedly committed
by the Israeli government.
Using children as a vehicle to drive
one's political message is questionable.
Such a technique evokes images of Sad
dam Hussein using Western hostages as
shields against attacks by the West
immediately after his invasion of
Kuwait.
MECA's — and Lubin's — philoso
phy are a relic of the past. Lubin's talk
made no mention of Israel's recent
overtures toward peace (i.e., releasing
800 prisoners, lifting a ban on contacts
with PLO, offering a cohesive 9-month
track election and a realistic peace plan,
freezing settlements). It consisted of an
unabated criticism of Israel, including
baseless accusations that flew in the
face of history.
Disingenuous Advertisement
On Feb. 11, the anti-Israeli efforts
of MEF culminated in a truth-twisting
paid advertisement. MEF went to the
trouble of buying space in The Daily
for the sole purpose of condemning
Israel for actions that took place 10
years ago, ones which Israel did not
commit. The group artfully manipulat
ed what a Stanford law student wrote,
just slightly, yet enough to make her

statement mean something totally dif
ferent. Then it quickly mentioned a
government investigation and followed
it with a quotation by an unrelated,
non-government individual to make it
seem as though the Israeli government
itself had said something which this
group wanted it to say. All that was at
best disingenuous, and at worse fabri
cation.
But the most perturbing aspect of
the advertisement was that it blurred
the facts surrounding the Kahan Com
mission of Inquiry. The Commission,
formed by the Israeli government in
response to public outrage and grief,
found that Israel was indirectly respon
sible for not foreseeing the possibility of
an attack by the Maronite Lebanese
Christian Phalange Militia on Palestini
ans living in refugee camps in Lebanon.
The investigation revealed wrongdoing
by a number of Israeli soldiers who
failed to prevent the attack. These indi
viduals were castigated. Instead of
advertising its hatred of Israel, MEF
might want to ask itself, what other
country in the Middle East has ever
conducted an investigation of its own
government, or of its own people, and
criticized its own actions? A prerequi
site for this introspection is a democrat
ic form of government. There is only
one democracy in the Middle East.
