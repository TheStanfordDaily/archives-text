## The calm that leads the storm Chris MacMurdo has seen it all in her five years at Stanford
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Over the past few seasons, the Stan
ford women's basketball program has
prospered, garnering two NCAA cham
pionships and three Final Four appear
ances behind superior front-line play, a
dominance embodied in the aggressive
play of Chris MacMurdo.
A native of Aiken, S.C., MacMurdo
entered Stanford as a very highly touted
recruit. During her senior season at
South Aiken High School, she averaged
an impressive 26.5 points, 11 rebounds
and 3.5 assists per game while shooting
56 percent from the floor, putting her
in the spotlight as the Converse Nation
al High School Player of the Year.
MacMurdo, now in her fifth year as a
forward for the Cardinal, is one of only
a handful of women's players to take an
extra year of eligibility, as injuries
marred her true-freshman season of
1988-89. With herniated disks in her
back, MacMurdo was forced to take a
medical redshirt. Following surgery and
rehabilitation, she returned to form the
following year as an important reserve
player on the 1990 national champi
onship team.
"Initially, I came in with pretty high
expectations on how I'd do, and the
injury, it kind of gave me a reality check.
For once, I thought maybe I wouldn't be
playing ever," MacMurdo said.
"Then, even when I was back playing
I had to play behind some extremely tal
ented players in Jennifer [Azzi] and
Katie [Stedingl and Sonja [Henning],"
she continued. "But, I feel that since
that time, I've improved my skills and I
feel pretty good about the improve
ments I've made."
According to Cardinal coach Tara
VanDerveer, MacMurdo has shown
great improvement defensively and
brings a competitive fire to the team
as a co-captain with teammate Val
Whiting. "I think Chris is one of the
most determined players we have. She
really plays with a lot of intensity,"
VanDerveer said. "She really epito
mizes what Stanford athletics is all
about."
"I think Chris is a great competitor,"
Whiting said. "She leads by example;
she's not really a vocal captain. People

see how hard she plays, how determined
she is and are inspired by that."
MacMurdo admits that she lets her
actions speak louder than her words on
the basketball court.
"I feel like my duty as a captain this
year has been to be stable; I'm not a
'rah-rah' person at all, and I think my
teammates focus on my stability. I just
try to do a consistent job day in and day
out," MacMurdo said.
Sometimes, however, that consisten
cy has given rise to standout perfor
mances. Last season, MacMurdo was
named MVP of the UNLV/Desert Clas
sic, an early-season tournament in Las
Vegas that the Cardinal went on to win.
She also saved possibly her best game of
the year for last, as she grabbed a sea
son-high 11 rebounds (including a Final
Four record nine in the first half) to go
along with nine points in Stanford's 78-
62 victory over Western Kentucky in
the NCAA championship game.
This season, MacMurdo has started
in 22 of 24 games, averaging 8.5 points
and 5.4 rebounds per game. Her biggest
outburst thus far came against UC-
Santa Barbara in December, when she
scored a career-high 23 points and
pulled down six rebounds in the Cardi
nal's 85-52 win. In Stanford's 71-54
shellacking of UCLA last week, Mac-
Murdo scored 15 points and pulled
down seven rebounds while hitting her
first five shots from the field.
"She really likes taking the ball to the
basket, though she really has a nice out
side jump shot," VanDerveer said of
MacMurdo's offensive prowess. "She
works individually a lot, and she's really
unselfish with the basketball; she looks
to get the ball inside a lot. I really
believe her determination and her
intensity are her greatest assets."
As a human biology major with a 3.5
GPA, MacMurdo has garnered Pac-10
All-Academic Team honors on three dif
ferent occasions and Third Team Aca
demic Ail-American laurels last year and
plans to pursue a career in medicine. "I
am really excited about the opportuni
ties for me in medicine. I feel like I'm
turning over a new leaf in my life. I'd like
to go into orthopedics; in that way I
would be able to work with athletes and
give them the opportunity that I was
given by an orthopedic surgeon to come

back and fulfill my goals athletically."
MacMurdo feels that her time at
Stanford has been an invaluable spring
board for her future goals. "I feel it was
a really good decision for me to choose
Stanford; and even though I could have
played more somewhere else, I think the
overall package academically and athlet
ically was the best," MacMurdo said.
Her coach was even more emphatic
about MacMurdo's potential based on
her collegiate career, and provided per
haps the best perspective on the star
forward. "As good as a basketball player
as she is, she's a better person," Van-
Derveer said. "She's going make a dif
ference in people's lives, and that's
more important that any basket she'll
score for Stanford."
