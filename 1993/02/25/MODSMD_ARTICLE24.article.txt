# Jordan's near-miss conjures up conjectures on successor

FOLD UP THE SEATS. Close up the
concession stands. Turn out the
lights. Send the fans home. Tell
Shaq to take a vacation. The NBA is shut
ting down.
OK, so maybe I'm taking this Michael
Jordan thing a bit too hard. But when
NBA stars Larry Bird and Magic Johnson
decided to call it quits and start collecting
retirement pay this year, MJ was my only
remaining reason to follow pro basketball
action at all.
After Air Jordan's crash landing and
twisted ankle against the Milwaukee
Bucks Tuesday night, I knew that the
league wouldn't be able to survive the loss.
Who else would I turn on the TV to see?
•Charles Barkley: Sir Charles is brutal,
but can't deliver the kind of all-around
Magic we'd expect from a true NBA
great. If I want to see someone talk that
much trash, I'll turn on Geraldo.
•Larry Johnson: I almost got more
playing time than Larry did in the All-

Star Game. And anyone that loses to his
Grandmama on national TV should be
barred from the NBA forever.
•The Shaq: The who? His range is the
dunk — Shaquille's outside shooting
wouldn't even get him a free pizza in the
Fry's Halftime Shootout.
•James Worthy: I once had an Irish set
ter that lived to the age of 15, and when
she got really old it made me sad just to
see her shuffle around the house every
day. You get the picture.
I think watching Jordan's incredible

switch-the-ball-to-the-other-hand-in-mid
air-and-still-make-the-off-balance-shot
against the Lakers in the Finals two years
ago made a believer out of me. Michael is
more than just a player, he's more than
the franchise — he's the league.
Then the roof fell in. When the NBA
dared to suspend The Man for throwing a
couple of innocent punches against a fel
low competitor, I figured, "Hey, this isn't
all that bad, Mike'll get a couple of
rounds of golf in, polish his tee shot, no
sweat. He'll be back in no time."
Tuesday night, however, Jordan's
injury seemed to unleash a slew of the
most ominous thoughts in my mind. The
NBA would no longer be "fan-tastic," the
Bulls would slip into last place in the
standings and eventually move the fran
chise to St. Petersburg, and I would be
forced to watch Jeopardy! to get my daily
dose of fast-paced action.
Think of life without Jordan in the
spotlight. No more "Be like Mike" — try

"Be like Dominique." Detlef Schrempf
would become Nike's new spokesperson.
Every kid in America would bug his par
ents for Air Schrempfs. It just doesn't
have the same ring.
Jordan single-handedly transformed
the Chicago Bulls from a league also-ran
to back-to-back NBA Champions. Millions
of people tuned into the 1991 NBA Finals,
which offered the marquee matchup of
Magic vs. Michael. The dream matchup of
the young upstart against the seasoned
veteran. For me, it ranked as one of the
most historic sporting events I've ever
watched — the changing of the guards.
The NBA survived the 1970s and '80s
because of Bird and Magic. Why couldn't
the league recognize how valuable Jordan
is and pay for all his recovery? Get him
the best doctors around, bring in the
most expensive and sophisticated equip
ment, take X-rays, CAT scans, PET
scans, urine samples, rectal temperature
and laser surgery.

Make him a bionic leg if you need to.
Then we can watch Michael sky 50 feet in
the air before slamming down a dunk. We
could play him one-on-one against The
Bionic Man — imagine, the dream game,
the Six-Million Dollar Man vs. the Twen
ty-Million Dollar Man.
How could you do this, Mike? I was
going to lead a drive to get you into the
Hall of Fame before you retired. This is
worse than measles, this is worse than
those chicken chalupas at Wilbur. Woe be
to us all — famine, pestilence, a thousand
plagues will surely visit our . . .
What?
He's listed as probable for tonight's
game?
Never mind.
