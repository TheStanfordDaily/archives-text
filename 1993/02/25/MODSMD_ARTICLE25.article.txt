Can the Stanford men's basketball
team make it two in a row? With its first
win in over a month in hand, the Cardi
nal will try to carry that momentum to
the Pacific Northwest this weekend as it
visits the Washington schools.
Last Saturday against USC, all parts
functioned properly for the Cardinal,
resulting in a team effort that manhan
dled the Trojans, 78-62. Stanford played
well on both ends of the floor, shooting 46
percent from the field while employing a
tight perimeter defense that minimized
USC's outside-shooting proficiency.
"I was pleased to play good basket
ball," said coach Mike Montgomery.
"Surprisingly enough, we were able to
win because of that. We were able to
shoot the ball well, and that gave us a
lot of confidence."
That confidence should give the Car
dinal a boost for its upcoming contests.
On Thursday night in Seattle, Stanford
(7-17, 2-10 Pacific 10 Conference) will
take on the Washington Huskies (12-10,
6-7), precisely the team that crushed the
Cardinal team psyche last month.
In their first meeting on Jan. 30,
Stanford shot 51 percent, its second best
shooting percentage in conference play.
In addition, four players scored in double
figures, but unfortunately it was all for
naught. Washington center Rich Man
ning, who finished with a game-high 20
points, sank an eight-foot turnaround
with 25 seconds left to hand the Cardinal
a heartbreaking 69-68 defeat.
The Washington loss was perhaps the

most demoralizing for the young Cardi
nal squad, which went on to lose its
ensuing five games, before halting the
trend against USC. While Manning, who
leads the Huskies with a 17.4 points per
game average, and Mark Pope will still
cause problems for Stanford defensively,
the Cardinal now boasts a new attitude
in the post as Darren Allaway, Bart
Lammersen and Jim Morgan are show
ing improvement with each outing.
"The USC game was the first time I
can remember this year that three post
players went in and had varying degrees
of success," Montgomery said. "That
opened up opportunities for Peter
(Dukes) and Dion (Cross), because we
were able to go inside and then kick the
ball back out."
On Saturday, the Cardinal will make
the trek to Pullman to face Washington
State. The Cougars (13-9, 7-6) are cur
rently tied for fourth place in the league,
and the afternoon matchup with the
Cardinal will be crucial to their NCAA
Tournament hopes.
"People now are in real precarious posi
tions for postseason play," Montgomery
said. "We just have to take care of the bas
ketball to minimize their emotion."
Washington State's main asset is the
quickness of their guards. Both Eddie
Hill and Bennie Seltzer had solid out
ings in the Cougars' 64-59 victory over
Stanford on Jan. 28. In order for the
Cardinal to be effective, it must control
the tempo, limiting the Cougars' fast
break opportunities.
"We cannot let them get the ball in
the open court," Montgomery said.
"They are so fast, and if we let them get

out and running, the crowd will get into
it and it will be crazy up there."
But if Stanford continues the manner
it displayed last Saturday, both home
crowds might be forced into submission.
"I'd like to springboard off of that win
in terms of playing better basketball,"
Montgomery said. "I'd like to see if we
can be more competitive on a consistent
basis and post some W's. I think there
are some more wins out there for us."
