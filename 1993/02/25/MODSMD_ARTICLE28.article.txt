The Cardinal will take a break
from beating up on its opponents
at Stanford Tennis Stadium to
see if it can do the same in the
Land o' Cheese this weekend.
The second-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team is in Madi
son, Wis. today to face the best col
legiate tennis teams in the nation
at the USTA/ITA Women's
National Indoor Collegiate Team
Championship. The Cardinal is
seeded second in the competition,
which runs until Sunday.
Stanford (9-0, 4-0 Pacific 10
Conference) is seeded behind No.
1 Florida, the team that ended the
Cardinal's six-year NCAA cham
pionship streak last year. Stan
ford and Florida have played each
other in four of the last five Team
Indoors finals, with the Gators
posting wins in 1988, 1991 and
1992 and the Cardinal taking the
title in 1989 and 1990.
Stanford's No. 1 player, junior

Laxmi Poruri, will face some of
the best players in the nation in
the competition, although her
toughest challenges might be
from Florida's Lisa Raymond,
ranked No. 76 in the world, and
Mississippi's Paloma Collantes,
ranked No. 1 by the ITA.
Senior-captain Heather Wil
lens, the Cardinal's No. 2 player,
will look to rebound in Madison
after her loss last weekend to Ari
zona State's Kori Davidson. Join
ing Willens in the starting lineup
will be No. 3 Kim Shasby, No. 4
Kristine Kurth, No. 5 Beth Berris
and No. 6 Amy Chiminello.
The Cardinal is joined by five
other Pac-10 teams in the tourna
ment: No. 5 UCLA, No. 6 Califor
nia, No. 8 Arizona State, No. 11
USC and No. 12 Arizona. Stan
ford scored wins over the Wild
cats and Sun Devils last weekend
in the Valley of the Sun.
The Cardinal will meet unranked
Virginia in the first round, while
Florida will open against tourna
ment host Wisconsin.
