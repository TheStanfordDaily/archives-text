# No strings attached
## New phones tested 
### Ajai Chari 
Bert Stubbs has a small phone.
Five inches long and weighing
less than one-half pound, Stubbs'
phone is one of eight new, wireless
telephones being tested by Com
munications Services.
With no strings — or cords — at
tached, the small, hand-held tele
phone has a range of a few hundred
feet from its home antenna, mak
ing it perfect for use by workers
who have to spend lots of time away
from their desks. And if the new
wireless system works well in its
test run at the engineering depart
ment of Communication Services
at Forsythe Hall, the University
may buy more of the Pocket Tele
phones — called "PTs," for short —
eventually distributing them to up
to 20 percent of campus phone
users, mostly staff members.
The new wireless System — in
augurated Tuesday — offers several
advantages over other portable
phones, said Stubbs, an associate di
rector of Communication Services.
For example, since cellular and
cordless phones broadcast over
AM frequencies, someone with a
scanner (available in many elec
tronics stores) can easily intercept
a call. But Stanford's wireless sys
tem uses technology that prevents

scanners from intercepting calls.
And the wireless phones oper
ate in a frequency range approved
by the FCC and can be legally used
without a license, which cellular
phone users must have.
In addition, cellular phones re
quire a separate number from con
ventional desk phones, and there
is an air-time charge ranging from
22 cents per minute to one dollar
per minute. The wireless phone
system, however, can have the
same number as an office phone
and has no air-time charge.
The wireless phones allow up to
four hours of air time and 48 hours
of standby time without recharg
ing. In contrast, cellular phones
typically only allow half-an hour of
air time and eight hours of standby
time before requiring a recharge.
Three components of the Spec
tra Link 2000 Personal Communi
cation System on trial — a Master
Control Unit (MCU) that provides
power to several Remote Cell
Units (RCUs), which act like an
tennas, receiving calls and relay
ing them to up to four PTs apiece.
Stubbs said that the cost of the
wireless system would be about
$10,000 for an MCU, $1,000 per
RCU and $600 per PT. The cost of
wireless service is competitive
with line service, which can range
from the $11 per month rate for
student residences to $30 per
month for some administrative
offices, depending on the differ
ent features chosen.

Currently Communication
Services has approximately 20
RCUs and 8 PTs. However, if the
new system works well, he said up
to 40 more PTs may be added.
Although no in-depth studies
have been conducted about am
possible expansion, the wireless
technology, if successful, might
be used in the University's main

tenance and disaster planning
departments. Currently, mainte
nance workers use pagers, but
Stubbs said they create a "time
lapse" because "you don't have
the ability to reach and make call
when you need to."
Stubbs said eventually 10-20 per
cent of the Stanford community
could be using wireless phones, but

added that student use was unlikely.
William Clebsch, an associate
director of Communication Ser
vices, said that from an organiza
tional and financial standpoint,
the wireless technology could be
expanded to people such as doc
tors, librarians and store man
agers, who are often away from
their desk phones.
