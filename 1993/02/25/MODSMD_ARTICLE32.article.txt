# Bike thefts prompt an original answer

Paranoid that bike thieves
would break his U-lock, San
Francisco bicycle messenger Rick
Byrd began using aluminum and
electric tape to strengthen it.
That was four years ago, and
he has since based a company on
his simple invention. "Bad
Bones" are now available in 1,500
bike stores nationwide, Byrd said.
Along with Dan Smith, a
Stanford Police special services
manager, Byrd manned a table in
White Plaza yesterday as part of
a "Lock Smart Program" that his
company has started on the UC-
Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Harvard
University and other campuses.
A 1989 San Francisco Chroni
cle article reporting a rash of
motorcycle and bicycle thefts
spurred the invention, Byrd said.
The article described in detail
how car jacks inserted between
the parallel arms of the "U" were
being used to break U-locks.
Byrd feared a "frenzy" of bike
thefts would occur as a result of
the article. "I knew that every
body and their cousin would be
trying it,"he said.
He had just designed a bike
from scratch for cyclist Greg
LeMond, costing around $2600.
Because it was worth so much,

Byrd worried that someone
would steal it.
To make the lock more secure,
he created the prototype for what
would become Bad Bones. "Peo
ple would see me and buy the
ones I would have on my bike,"
he said, so each day he went
home and made a new pair.
Byrd ended up hand-making
100 more Bad Bones and selling
them for $15 each to friends. He
started his own company with
five other friends — four of
whom had bikes stolen — in
March of 1991 and applied for a
patent in August of that year.
He "bought a car" and went
looking for investors, Byrd said,
taking samples of the product
around the Bay Area.
"It was slow in the beginning,"
said Erik Ott, the company's mar
keting director. Most shop owners
were skeptical of the product, but
when the company showed video
footage of U-locks being broken,
people became more confident
about the new product.
Most U-lock companies
require buyers to send the bro
ken lock and a police report to
prove the bike was stolen, but
Ott said most thieves take the
locks as well as the bikes. He said
the Bay Area-based Kryptonite
lock company had only 20 claims
in a two-year period.
