## Freedom of speech sells — but for whom? 
### 
Let's face it kids, the music industry isn't
about being all zippity doodah, and it
hasn't been for a long time.
While Elvis was getting paid, Little
Richard was looking for an honest contract.
Like the surrounding society, the music in
dustry has institutionalized racism.
Time Warner's The Red Hot Chilli Pep
pers can write "Special Secret Song Inside"
with the refrain "I want to

party on your pussy baby"
and not worry about label
support. In fact, MTV has no
problem playing their videos,
LIVE 105 has no problem

with heavy airplay and police
in Idaho have no problem providing show se
curity.
Time Warner's Corrosion of Conformity
can write "Vote With A Bullet" and not worry
about their recording contract. In fact, they can
have the entire floor display at Tower Records
in Mountain View devoted to the single.
Former Time Warner recording artist Ice-
T is different. He's releasing his upcoming
album independently, because Time Warner
doesn't want the heat from more controversy.
The issue isn't whether the above material
is legitimate or worthwhile; rather it's the
subtle racism ofblasting Ice-T, while allowing
bands who play up to white suburbia to go
unchallenged into prime-time video and
mass saturation.
"Vote With A Bullet" and "Cop Killer"
point at huge problems within the United
States, even if we don't agree with their solu
tions. "Special Secret Song Inside" and "Girls
L. G. B. N. A. F. (Let's Get Butt Naked And
Fuck)" lack commentary other than imma-

Pat Dote
Jim Haljun

ture expressions of heterosexual male humor.
While newspapers such as "The San Fran
cisco Examiner" do spreads attacking misog
yny in Gangsta' Rap, they ignore the Guns &
Roses release, "Use Your Illusion" despite
these lines: "Cheap heartbreaker, broken
backed/ Nasty ballbreaker, stay out of my
bed/ Outta my head/ If it's lovin' you, I'm bet
ter off dead/ Back off, Back offbitch/ Down in

the gutter, dyin' in the ditch/
You better back off, back off,
back off bitch."
You see, it's not that much
of what's released on major
label rap isn't misogynist

It's that much of what's re
leased period is misogynist. The singling out
of rap artists such as Ice-T, because of prob
lems endemic to a whole industry, is racist.
Think about it. The Rolling Stones wrote
"Brown Sugar" without retribution — it's a
song on all the jukeboxes in America's family
restaurants. But what would be the media
outcry if Ice Cube wrote "White Sugar?"
Worse, conscious rappers, musicians,
strong women and positive role models
don't get major label recording contracts.
East Palo Alto's KS Rappers and Oakland's
Coco Quik remain unsigned while Storm
Troopers of Death have had two releases.
While the KS Rappers write about peace in
the projects, and Coco Quik approaches
women's issues, Storm Troopers of Death
ride out media racism comfortably with
"Speak English Or Die."
And the industry won't change until we as
consumers force the change, not by dropping
bucks on the hype machines, but by searching
for quality.
