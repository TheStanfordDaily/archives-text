## Reclaiming sci-fi to program VCRs 
### 
Don't panic, but today's column is
about science fiction. You already
stopped reading, didn't you? You
snorted in disgust and turned the page be
cause only socially awkward idiot-savants
with acne scars read science fiction, right?
It doesn't have to be that way, of course.
All you have to do is look at the millions of
VCRs dumbly flashing "12:00" in living
rooms across the coun-

try to know that we are
being bludgeoned mer
cilessly by our own
technology.

And if the ultimate task of fiction is to
help us understand our world and its future,
then science fiction, with its technological
sophistication and flair for speculation,
should be enjoying a golden age.
Instead, most science fiction authors are
drifting away from the mainstream into shal
low marshes of escapism, mingling insepara
bly with the motley crew of J.R.R. Tolkien
impersonators known as "fantasy" writers.
In many ways, the genre has come full
circle. Science fiction in its modern form
was born in the late 1920s when there was a
sudden epidemic of gaudy pulp magazines
with titles like "Amazing Stories." A typical
cover would feature a leggy brunette
shrieking in terror as the Martians or the
evil robots marched down the street, cal
lously incinerating Model-Ts and brown
stones.
Back in those days, realism wasn't some
thing most people sought in fiction. Be
tween the Great Depression, Nazi concen
tration camps and Hiroshima, there was
more than enough grim reality to go

around. So adolescent males hid their mag
azines under their mattresses when they
weren't staring dreamily at the ads for their
"very own jet pack," and nobody thought
much of it.
But though the War turned Cold, it
would not go away, and neither would radar
nor the computer nor the atomic bomb.
Technology had come home to stay, and sci
ence fiction struggled to

mature in order to reas
sure a population fright
ened by the alarming
pace of change.

By the '80s, though, science fiction start
ed to show its age. The mainstream audi
ence, frustrated by the genre's inhumanity
and lack of subtlety, turned back to the real
world, leaving science fiction in the hands of
writers for whom the real world was just an
uncomfortable nuisance anyway.
Fortunately, they haven't managed to
find and eliminate all of the truly thoughtful
works of speculative fiction yet. In his "cy
berpunk" novels, William Gibson paints
breathtakingly detailed landscapes of a bleak
future which he extrapolates from the
amoral technological excesses of modern
America. Margaret Atwood fired salvos at
today's radical right-wingers with deadly ac
curacy from the not-so-distant future of her
novel, "The Handmaid's Tale."
Books like these, which combine the
imaginative speculation of science fiction
with keen human sensitivity are an endan
gered species. They deserve to be rescued
from the world of elves and dragons and vir
ile tough guys with laserguns before they
disappear completely.
