# 'it is appropriate to this story that the vanishing white middle class guy takes out his rage on a Korean grocer' — joel Schumacher

T

all, languid and disarmingly
low-key as he welcomes ques
tions on a rainy day in San
Francisco, Joel Schumacher —
director of "The Lost Boys "
and "Flatliners" — says that his

latest production, "Falling Down," reflects a
pissed off, angry America.
Pissed off at just what becomes clear almost
immediately, as Michael Douglas, sporting the
crew cut and glasses of a straight-laced Mor
mon missionary, busts up a grocery store
owned by a rude and dirty-looking Korean gro
cer who refuses to give him change. Thus be
gins a day-long wake of destruction as Douglas,
representing your average working stiff, ex
plodes against the tribulations of another crap
py day in Los Angeles.
The audience at the preview chortled merri
ly in the scene where Douglas rampages
through the store with a baseball bat, scream
ing that he's "standing up for his rights as a
consumer" and that the grocer should quit
cringing on the floor and speak clear English.
After paying 50 cents for an 85-cent Coke,
Douglas leaves, saying, "It's been a pleasure fre
quenting your establishment."
Next, Douglas encounters some lowlife
Latino gangbangers (listed as Gangmember #1,
2,3 and 4 in the credits), who have nothing else
to do except prey on lone white guys sitting in
empty lots in East L.A. After some snappy one
liners about the aesthetics of gang graffiti, Dou
glas uses the punks for batting practice, and re
mains unperturbed when they hunt him down
with automatic weapons.
The rest of the film consists of similar
scenes: Douglas gets thrown into a stereotyped
headache of urban American life. Douglas dis
plays increasingly impressive amounts of fire
power. Douglas makes wry quips and looks in
creasingly like a shrunken, wizened Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
Meanwhile, Robert Duvall, clearly in need
of funds, stars as Officer Prendergast, a folksy,
desk-bound cop married to an overweight and
neurotic Tuesday Weld who isn't really a
woman but a screeching, weeping harpy who
never gets off her husband's back.
Prendergast — gentle and avuncular —
contrasts with Douglas so clangingly that his
role rings hollow and fake. His scenes with con
vivial and clean-looking ethnic police officers

seem designed to help Schumacher fend off
charges of racism — a sort of race insurance.
Displaying window dressing at its finest,
Rachel Ticotin ("Total Recall") plays Sandra, a
typical female buddy cop who supports Pren
dergast as he single-handedly uncovers Dou
glas' M.O. despite his peers' snickering. Ticotin
does little except to show that Prendergast can
get along with Latina cops, and utter lines like,
"Go get the bastard. Be careful."
More white male fantasy than cinema-ver
it6, the film plays like the nightmare of a subur
banite trapped in the inner city. But Schu
macher

says that
"Falling
Down,"
which
Warner

Bros, is marketing as a thriller, pre
sents life as it is, not as what political
correctness would like it to be.
"I make movies about imperfect
people in an imperfect world," he
says. "There's plenty of entertain-

ment out there for political correctness. 1 think
political correctness is having everyone being
represented as a lawyer in a three-piece suit like
on L.A. Law. Doing nice things for people.
There are films like that and there are plenty of
those that you can go to see."
To him, the film reflects the anger and hos
tility in modern American life. "The American
dream is that your education, your retirement
fund, your child's education and so on should
all be taken care of," he says. The idyllic visions
of material comfort displayed by Hollywood
films, which were once considered the
birthright of every American, no longer seems
within grasp for most of the middle class, and
for that reason, Schumacher says, "people are
really, really pissed.

"The news is filled with rage. People are act
ing out all over the place, and this must come
from frustration. I think this is why'Roseanne'
is the number one show in America, because
she stands for the '90s attitude, and the '90s at
titude is: 'I'm not gonna take any shit from
you.'"
Somehow, to Schumacher and screenwriter
Ebbe Roe Smith, rude, unintelligible Korean
grocers and menacing Latino gang members
reflect an American "reality" that regular guys
like Douglas' character must tolerate in urban
nightmares like Los Angeles. Says Schumacher:

"I guess
I could
have had
a Cau
cas i a n
store ow-

ner and Caucasian gang members,
but that wouldn't have been true to
L.A."
Douglas' character, he ad
mits, is someone who doesn't like
living in a multicultural society. "I'm

taking off after the white middle class Ameri
can," he says."I think he's a dinosaur. I don't
think he knows how to live in a multicultural
society — he's anger looking for a place to hit.
"There is an absurdist comedy throughout
this whole movie," Schumacher continues.
"But I didn't single out the Koreans. There are
many Korean grocers in LA. It is appropriate to
this story that the vanishing white middle class
guy takes out his rage on a Korean grocer. I
don't have my head up my ass. I know that we
live in a sick society.
"The fact that we want it not to be that way
is fine — I'm all for that, I'm an old hippy —
but I'm dealing with it the way that I see it as the
way it is. I'm trying to show that we have an
eroding culture around us and that everyone's

people in an imperfect world," he
says. "There's plenty of entertain-

There are films like that and there are plenty of
those that you can go to see."
To him, the film reflects the anger and hos
tility in modern American life. "The American
dream is that your education, your retirement
fund, your child's education and so on should
all be taken care of," he says. The idyllic visions
of material comfort displayed by Hollywood
films, which were once considered the
birthright of every American, no longer seems
within grasp for most of the middle class, and
for that reason, Schumacher says, "people are
really, really pissed.

"The news is filled with rage. People are act

A man (Michael Douglas) fed up with the American social and economic systems converses with gang members shortly before blow
ing them away in director Joel Schumacher's "Falling Down."
T

all, languid and disarmingly
low-key as he welcomes ques
tions on a rainy day in San
Francisco, Joel Schumacher —
director of "The Lost Boys "
and "Flatliners" — says that his

latest production, "Falling Down," reflects a
pissed off, angry America.
Pissed off at just what becomes clear almost
immediately, as Michael Douglas, sporting the
crew cut and glasses of a straight-laced Mor
mon missionary, busts up a grocery store
owned by a rude and dirty-looking Korean gro
cer who refuses to give him change. Thus be
gins a day-long wake of destruction as Douglas,
representing your average working stiff, ex
plodes against the tribulations of another crap
py day in Los Angeles.
The audience at the preview chortled merri
ly in the scene where Douglas rampages
through the store with a baseball bat, scream
ing that he's "standing up for his rights as a
consumer" and that the grocer should quit
cringing on the floor and speak clear English.
After paying 50 cents for an 85-cent Coke,
Douglas leaves, saying, "It's been a pleasure fre
quenting your establishment."
Next, Douglas encounters some lowlife
Latino gangbangers (listed as Gangmember #1,
2,3 and 4 in the credits), who have nothing else
to do except prey on lone white guys sitting in
empty lots in East L.A. After some snappy one
liners about the aesthetics of gang graffiti, Dou
glas uses the punks for batting practice, and re
mains unperturbed when they hunt him down
with automatic weapons.
The rest of the film consists of similar
scenes: Douglas gets thrown into a stereotyped
headache of urban American life. Douglas dis
plays increasingly impressive amounts of fire
power. Douglas makes wry quips and looks in
creasingly like a shrunken, wizened Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
Meanwhile, Robert Duvall, clearly in need
of funds, stars as Officer Prendergast, a folksy,
desk-bound cop married to an overweight and
neurotic Tuesday Weld who isn't really a
woman but a screeching, weeping harpy who
never gets off her husband's back.
Prendergast — gentle and avuncular —
contrasts with Douglas so clangingly that his
role rings hollow and fake. His scenes with con
vivial and clean-looking ethnic police officers

seem designed to help Schumacher fend off
charges of racism — a sort of race insurance.
