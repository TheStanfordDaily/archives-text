angry."
Casting minorities in glistening and heart
warming Disney epics isn't the issue, however.
"Falling Down" depicts surly ethnic types as
supposedly typifying urban America's descent
into hell and your average white guy wanting to
unleash his violence against them.
Worse, "Falling Down" attempts to apolo
gize for Douglas' behavior, transforming it into
a liberating orgy of violence. After all, Douglas
doesn't kill anyone, except for some real sickos
that deserve it. And like a true family man, he's
trying to reunite with his estranged wife (Bar
bara Hershey) and celebrate his daughter's
birthday.
Schumacher claims that "to tell a moral tale
you have to show immoral behavior. The dan
ger is that some people will cheer, but that hap
pens with movies. But that isn't the movie, that
is the culture."
But "Falling Down" is not a moral tale. Nor
does it aspire to be one. If audiences laugh
while Douglas beats up people, then either the
filmmakers screwed up or were looking for
laughs.
However, like many other artists, Schu
macher blames most of his excesses on "the au
dience," a ready-made scapegoat.
Years from now, the film will be a revealing
glimpse into the pathetic fears and fantasies of a
white middle class that imagines itself trapped
in a tormented existence of crumbling cities, be
sieged by people who conform to every vicious
stereotype of race and class found in the '90s.
Schumacher describes his work as an "in
your-face film." He's right. It stays there and
stays there, yapping incessantly with nothing
to say. â–
