# LANGSTON’S LEGACY
## African-American student artists and performers share their works, experiences 
### JEFF BROCK 
With a characteristic embracing
gesture, rapper Aki McKinzie
explains how the arts have "filled
a void" in his life.
"Life is not life unless you can express it, in
the way you speak, in the way your body
talks, your art, your drawings," says the senior
who has freestyled his way to the peak of the
African-American arts scene at Stanford.
He shares the summit with other black
artists, writers, actors, dancers and photog
raphers who spend long hours bringing their
artistic visions to fruition. From the Roble
Dance Studio to the Little Theater stage to
the pages of a literary journal, they seek self
fulfillment and recognition from the entire
Stanford community.
McKinzie, who hails from inner-city
Memphis, started rapping in junior high.
"Rapping to me was like my rite of passage,"
he says, "since there is no traditional custom
of letting you know whether you're becom
ing a man in
* a mrA I) America, unless
I M CAM\ you're Jewish
Entering the vari
ety show Stanfunk with some of his friends
led to the creation of The 7 Principles, one
of the campus' hottest music groups.
The themes of consciousness and the
uplifting of African-American communities
pervade McKinzie's raps. His conversational
WHOLE SONGS,
style, often bubbly and excited, translates
into high energy on stage.
"The stage is the most comfortable place
for me," says McKinzie, who admires such
artists as Public Enemy and KRS-One. "It's

make a phone call," says former member
Kwame Anku, a junior.
McKinzie recalls two key performances:
one for crack kids at a San Francisco daycare
center and another at a Los Angeles anti
police-brutality rally, a couple of hours after
Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke.
After some personnel changes, the band is
regrouping and preparing for a performance
blitz. McKinzie, a mechanical engineering
major, says if the group achieves professional
success, he'll "forget all that resume chasing."
Friend and fellow musician Anku fell
in love with the guitar at age 12,
through groups like Van Halen and
Def Leppard. The dreadlocked junior, who
plays bass, keyboards and programs a drum
machine, composes acoustic, mellow songs
as well as rock and funk. The ability to com
pose, he says, is both a "gift and a curse."
"I hear whole songs, whole bass lines,
whole melodies in my head," he says. "You
feel like it's some kind of force that just
opens up your head and says, 'Hey, here's a
cool song for you,' all you have to do really is
figure out on the guitar or the keyboard
where the notes are, because you already
know what it sounds like.
"It's a curse because ... you never know
when that's gonna happen," says Anku, who
composed the music for the avant-garde play
"The Death of the Last Black Man in the
Entire World" and played an original piece
at University President Gerhard Casper's
inauguration.
"A lot of black people don't listen to rock
music," says Anku, who models his vocals
somewhat after Seal and Peter Gabriel.
"They associate that with being white —
Bon Jovi. At the same time a lot of white
people who listen to rock music don't realize
it's basically a form of black music."

Many blacks, he says, think the
all-black rock group Living Colour
— one of his inspirations — "want

like you fall into this rhythm, and you're hit- to be white." But their messages, like Anku's,
ting syllable after syllable. It's a place where I deal with racism, social injustice, double stan
can talk and be me. I feed off the acknowl- dards and American hypocrisy, he says,
edgment of the people around me and their Anku, who through his music likes to sug
smiles. Once they start smilin' I just start gest "alternate ways of looking at things,"
goin' and I don't even worry about what wants to go to local high schools to play and
facilitate discussions. Currently

After an electrifying performance of the
song "Go Down Garvey" at the 1991 Go
Down Garvey Contest in Memorial
Auditorium — where the band captured sec-

exponentially, with the help of the

House Saturday night.
The 20-member African dance group
Kuumba, a cornerstone in the
African-American community, is
preparing for its most-watched performance
of the year — Club Uj — this Saturday.
Co-director Bacardi Jackson, who joined
the group as a sophomore with no dance
experience, says that now she's "kind of
hooked on dance."
"For me, dancing is not just simply danc
ing for performance, but it almost has a spir
itual aspect to it," Jackson says. "It's a release
and it's a way to come together with every
body and to share something."
Newcomer dance group Jam Pac'd has
explored jazz, R&B, hip-hop, rap and pop for
more than a year. Co-director Maggie
Chapman decided to "get up the courage" to
form the group because "there seemed to be a
lack of forums for the type of dance that we do.
The dance department at Stanford is very mod-

ern-oriented."
Chapman, who is
white, has studied
modern, ballet,
jazz, tap and
some African
dance.
The 17-
member group
hopes to col
laborate with
local high
school kids on
a version of
the group's |
most memo
rable perfor-

mance: last
year's 10-minute mul
timedia "Piece — No
Piece," which high
lighted inner-city, black
on-black violence.

Chapman, a senior, sees
the arts as a real force for
social change and a medium
that can give kids a voice.
"[Kids] can see that art doesn't

have to be random, abstract bull
shit," she says after a Roble Studio practice
filled with 12 stretching, prancing, jumping,
clapping, swinging and undulating dancers.
While African-American singers
and dancers have a strong pres
ence on campus, black actors
and actresses are still struggling for greater
recognition from the community.
Senior drama major Greg Miller has
empowered himself: He wrote a one-man
piece, "Invisible Being, Tangible Lives,"
which he'll perform next quarter. "It's my
play on redefining the image of young black
men," he says, giddily nervous about his
upcoming solo.
"My love is acting, but as an African-
American performer, generally we all write
— [because we] want good material. I don't
know any African-American actors that
haven't tried to write."
Miller, who has acted since the ninth
grade, calls his turn as Old Man River Jordan
in"The Death of the Last Black Man" his
most powerful performance. From March 5
through 7 he'll star in the campus produc-

tion of "San Antonio
Sunset," a study of
race and class in the

19305.
The
Atlanta native
says his ethnicity
gives him "a
responsibility to
tell the truth. I
feel like my use
of my talent and
the medium is
political. I feel
like I have to
deal with reality."
He says

Rodney King's
trial reflected the negative
way society views black
men, and "if I do some
thing to put some other
image in peoples' minds,
maybe the next time there's an

incident like that they can see a
human being."
Last year's discussion of
killing the Drama Department.

shows a lack of support for the arts at
Stanford, he says."I feel supported by the
Drama Department because I made it my
own. It's a pretty white department, but I
would not say discriminatory. I don't agree
with all the practices there, but those are just
my [beliefs] as an artist."
Drama major Bridgit Evans, who has
acted in productions such as "The Duchess
of Malfi" and"The Death of the Last Black
Man," spent 14 weeks last fall at the O'Neill
Theater Center in Connecticut. While the
training did improve her skills, she realized
she doesn't want to work in that type of
social environment, where she was one of
three people of color in a group of 37 stu
dents performing European plays.
"There was a real sense of voluntary igno
rance, of not dealing with other cultural or
even gender issues," she says. "It's very easy
to get swept up into 'Oh, acting is about the
art, not about the politics,' which isn't true."
She returned from Connecticut with a
sharper vision and a clearer idea of her goals
as an African-American actress.
During her just-completed one-woman
show, "The Moonshot Tape" — which she'll

perform again during Women's Herstory
Month in March — everything she learned
about being an actress at Stanford and in the
outside world "suddenly either got trashed
or reaffirmed during this rehearsal process."
By the nature of their work, Miller,
Evans and other performing artists
are quite visible on campus. But stu
dents in the creative arts — writers, artists,
photographers — often toil in relative
obscurity.
For photographer Amy Stevens, a junior
who works mainly in 35 mm black-and
white and has been published in "Critical
Bitch," the creative arts "give more room to
show different ideas instead of having a
monolithic view of what it is to be a black
American."
However, she sees much less student par
ticipation in writing and photography than
in dance and other performing arts.
"That's why 1 think Enigma ("The
Stanford Journal of Black Expression") last
spring was such as good idea, because you
got it all in one collected volume instead of a
couple people here and a couple people
there," she says."It gave a lot more people
space to express themselves, which I think is
a great idea."
Senior Tammie Edwards, co-editor of
Enigma, hopes the second issue of the poet
ry, prose, art and photography magazine will
hit campus in the middle of spring quarter.
Recent graduates Omar Wasow and Danzy
Senna founded Enigma last year because
other venues weren't exposing different tal
ents, Edwards says.
To provide much-needed continuity for
the journal's future, Edwards set up a struc
ture in which one co-editor — this year,
junior Cheo H. Coker — will remain at
Stanford at least for one more year.
With sexuality and racial identity as some
key themes, she envisions including "as
many divergent voices as possible" in future
issues. Often in the black community voices
that are "not part of the mainstream are
pushed out," she says. "It's OK to disagree,
OK to not be all alike."
Edwards, an international relations major,
wrote a Daily column last year, has a story in
Cosmopolitan's "Life After College" issue this
month — "My Internship Got Me An In" —
and will work at Time Magazine this summer.
"I'm happiest when I'm writing," she says.
Edwards, who is considering founding a
"Vanity Fair-type magazine" to serve as a role
model to other African-Americans, says one of
her favorite themes in her writing is the idea
that African-Americans must bring their edu
cation back to their respective communities.
Artist Carmen Kynard — whose
most recent work on the Club Uj
poster adorns walls across campus
— often explores African-American beauty
as a theme in her pieces.
Moving to an all-girls Catholic high
school, where she studied studio art and
art history, shaped her art. "My experi
ence was very much disrespected," says the
half-black, half-German native of Ohio. "I
wasn't Catholic, I wasn't white, I wasn't mid
dle class, I didn't come from a 'good' family."
She didn't realize until coming to Stanford
that during high school she turned her artis
tic eye primarily toward black women's fea
tures, women whose beauty she did not see

in herself due to the school's oppressive
atmosphere, she says.
"I don't feel like what I do fits in with the
art programs here at Stanford," gesticulating
like a painter creating brush strokes. "It's defi
nitely not abstract or surrealist. It just seems
like everyday for me, like pictures."
Not until this year did it occur to her that
she could make a living as an artist. "I don't
think black people are encouraged in that
type of direction," she says.
Kynard, whose work also includes last
year's Women's Herstory poster, feels that
within the black community she and other
artists are supported by the CBPA and are
well-appreciated. Realizing that was a "big
part of my Stanford experience," she says.
However, the larger community is often
intimidated by African-Americans saying
"we're going to display our art form,"
Kynard says. "There's a dialogue there that's
missing ... between different communities.
"[Stanford] is such a professional pumping
joint," she says. "People get pumped in, then
they get pumped out, and they go back out
into the world and not have to see it, not have
to look at it. I feel like the arts should do that."
Many of the artists agree that
although black arts are vibrant on
campus, more black students
need to take part.
Jackson says she thinks the percentage of
African-American students who participate
in the performing arts is greater than that of
other communities.
Faculty often drive the arts scene,
Chapman says, noting CBPA director Harry
Elam's role in increasing the amount of pro
ductions and encouraging students.
Stanford's small African-American popu
lation — 8 percent of the student body —
contributes to low participation.
"When you have a small population, not
everyone's going to be creatively inclined,"
Edwards says. A high number of African-
American students major in technical fields,
she says, partly because Stanford's reputa
tion draws those kinds of students.
McKinzie adds, "For the most part, when
we come to schools like this, if we're first
generation or we're coming from a [family]
that doesn't have as much economically, the
last thing your parents encourage you to do
is go into the arts."
Many students agree that if they'd had an
inkling during their senior year of high
school that they wanted to pursue the arts
seriously, they would have taken their
tuition money elsewhere.
"If I had grown up as a child, and if some
one had said to me, 'You're an artist, you
should do this,' I wouldn't be in a place like
Stanford," Kynard says. "It's just not very
nurturing in that sense.
"I don't feel like African-American stu
dents are encouraged to say, 'OK you have
this talent in drama, go with that.'...
Stanford's not the type of place that would
steer you away from the professional schools."
While other schools are awash with per
forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■

forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■

With a characteristic embracing
gesture, rapper Aki McKinzie
explains how the arts have "filled
a void" in his life.
"Life is not life unless you can express it, in
the way you speak, in the way your body
talks, your art, your drawings," says the senior
who has freestyled his way to the peak of the
African-American arts scene at Stanford.
He shares the summit with other black
artists, writers, actors, dancers and photog
raphers who spend long hours bringing their
artistic visions to fruition. From the Roble
Dance Studio to the Little Theater stage to
the pages of a literary journal, they seek self
fulfillment and recognition from the entire
Stanford community.
McKinzie, who hails from inner-city
Memphis, started rapping in junior high.
"Rapping to me was like my rite of passage,"
he says, "since there is no traditional custom
of letting you know whether you're becom
ing a man in
* a mrA I) America, unless
I M CAM\ you're Jewish
Entering the vari
ety show Stanfunk with some of his friends
led to the creation of The 7 Principles, one
of the campus' hottest music groups.
The themes of consciousness and the
uplifting of African-American communities
pervade McKinzie's raps. His conversational
WHOLE SONGS,
style, often bubbly and excited, translates
into high energy on stage.
"The stage is the most comfortable place
for me," says McKinzie, who admires such
artists as Public Enemy and KRS-One. "It's

make a phone call," says former member
Kwame Anku, a junior.
McKinzie recalls two key performances:
one for crack kids at a San Francisco daycare
center and another at a Los Angeles anti
police-brutality rally, a couple of hours after
Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke.
After some personnel changes, the band is
regrouping and preparing for a performance
blitz. McKinzie, a mechanical engineering
major, says if the group achieves professional
success, he'll "forget all that resume chasing."
Friend and fellow musician Anku fell
in love with the guitar at age 12,
through groups like Van Halen and
Def Leppard. The dreadlocked junior, who
plays bass, keyboards and programs a drum
machine, composes acoustic, mellow songs
as well as rock and funk. The ability to com
pose, he says, is both a "gift and a curse."
"I hear whole songs, whole bass lines,
whole melodies in my head," he says. "You
feel like it's some kind of force that just
opens up your head and says, 'Hey, here's a
cool song for you,' all you have to do really is
figure out on the guitar or the keyboard
where the notes are, because you already
know what it sounds like.
"It's a curse because ... you never know
when that's gonna happen," says Anku, who
composed the music for the avant-garde play
"The Death of the Last Black Man in the
Entire World" and played an original piece
at University President Gerhard Casper's
inauguration.
"A lot of black people don't listen to rock
music," says Anku, who models his vocals
somewhat after Seal and Peter Gabriel.
"They associate that with being white —
Bon Jovi. At the same time a lot of white
people who listen to rock music don't realize
it's basically a form of black music."

Many blacks, he says, think the

House Saturday night.
The 20-member African dance group
Kuumba, a cornerstone in the
African-American community, is
preparing for its most-watched performance
of the year — Club Uj — this Saturday.
Co-director Bacardi Jackson, who joined
the group as a sophomore with no dance
experience, says that now she's "kind of
hooked on dance."
"For me, dancing is not just simply danc
ing for performance, but it almost has a spir
itual aspect to it," Jackson says. "It's a release
and it's a way to come together with every
body and to share something."
Newcomer dance group Jam Pac'd has
explored jazz, R&B, hip-hop, rap and pop for
more than a year. Co-director Maggie
Chapman decided to "get up the courage" to
form the group because "there seemed to be a
lack of forums for the type of dance that we do.
The dance department at Stanford is very mod-

ern-oriented."
Chapman, who is
white, has studied
modern, ballet,
jazz, tap and
some African
dance.
The 17-
member group
hopes to col
laborate with
local high
school kids on
a version of
the group's |
most memo
rable perfor-

mance: last
year's 10-minute mul
timedia "Piece — No
Piece," which high
lighted inner-city, black
on-black violence.

Chapman, a senior, sees
the arts as a real force for
social change and a medium
that can give kids a voice.
"[Kids] can see that art doesn't

have to be random, abstract bull
shit," she says after a Roble Studio practice
filled with 12 stretching, prancing, jumping,
clapping, swinging and undulating dancers.
While African-American singers
and dancers have a strong pres
ence on campus, black actors
and actresses are still struggling for greater
recognition from the community.
Senior drama major Greg Miller has
empowered himself: He wrote a one-man
piece, "Invisible Being, Tangible Lives,"
which he'll perform next quarter. "It's my
play on redefining the image of young black
men," he says, giddily nervous about his
upcoming solo.
"My love is acting, but as an African-
American performer, generally we all write
— [because we] want good material. I don't
know any African-American actors that
haven't tried to write."
Miller, who has acted since the ninth
grade, calls his turn as Old Man River Jordan
in"The Death of the Last Black Man" his
most powerful performance. From March 5
through 7 he'll star in the campus produc-

tion of "San Antonio
Sunset," a study of
race and class in the

19305.
The
Atlanta native
says his ethnicity
gives him "a
responsibility to
tell the truth. I
feel like my use
of my talent and
the medium is
political. I feel
like I have to
deal with reality."
He says

Rodney King's
trial reflected the negative
way society views black
men, and "if I do some
thing to put some other
image in peoples' minds,
maybe the next time there's an

incident like that they can see a
human being."
Last year's discussion of
killing the Drama Department.

shows a lack of support for the arts at
Stanford, he says."I feel supported by the
Drama Department because I made it my
own. It's a pretty white department, but I
would not say discriminatory. I don't agree
with all the practices there, but those are just
my [beliefs] as an artist."
Drama major Bridgit Evans, who has
acted in productions such as "The Duchess
of Malfi" and"The Death of the Last Black
Man," spent 14 weeks last fall at the O'Neill
Theater Center in Connecticut. While the
training did improve her skills, she realized
she doesn't want to work in that type of
social environment, where she was one of
three people of color in a group of 37 stu
dents performing European plays.
"There was a real sense of voluntary igno
rance, of not dealing with other cultural or
even gender issues," she says. "It's very easy
to get swept up into 'Oh, acting is about the
art, not about the politics,' which isn't true."
She returned from Connecticut with a
sharper vision and a clearer idea of her goals
as an African-American actress.
During her just-completed one-woman
show, "The Moonshot Tape" — which she'll

perform again during Women's Herstory
Month in March — everything she learned
about being an actress at Stanford and in the
outside world "suddenly either got trashed
or reaffirmed during this rehearsal process."
By the nature of their work, Miller,
Evans and other performing artists
are quite visible on campus. But stu
dents in the creative arts — writers, artists,
photographers — often toil in relative
obscurity.
For photographer Amy Stevens, a junior
who works mainly in 35 mm black-and
white and has been published in "Critical
Bitch," the creative arts "give more room to
show different ideas instead of having a
monolithic view of what it is to be a black
American."
However, she sees much less student par
ticipation in writing and photography than
in dance and other performing arts.
"That's why 1 think Enigma ("The
Stanford Journal of Black Expression") last
spring was such as good idea, because you
got it all in one collected volume instead of a
couple people here and a couple people
there," she says."It gave a lot more people
space to express themselves, which I think is
a great idea."
Senior Tammie Edwards, co-editor of
Enigma, hopes the second issue of the poet
ry, prose, art and photography magazine will
hit campus in the middle of spring quarter.
Recent graduates Omar Wasow and Danzy
Senna founded Enigma last year because
other venues weren't exposing different tal
ents, Edwards says.
To provide much-needed continuity for
the journal's future, Edwards set up a struc
ture in which one co-editor — this year,
junior Cheo H. Coker — will remain at
Stanford at least for one more year.
With sexuality and racial identity as some
key themes, she envisions including "as
many divergent voices as possible" in future
issues. Often in the black community voices
that are "not part of the mainstream are
pushed out," she says. "It's OK to disagree,
OK to not be all alike."
Edwards, an international relations major,
wrote a Daily column last year, has a story in
Cosmopolitan's "Life After College" issue this
month — "My Internship Got Me An In" —
and will work at Time Magazine this summer.
"I'm happiest when I'm writing," she says.
Edwards, who is considering founding a
"Vanity Fair-type magazine" to serve as a role
model to other African-Americans, says one of
her favorite themes in her writing is the idea
that African-Americans must bring their edu
cation back to their respective communities.
Artist Carmen Kynard — whose
most recent work on the Club Uj
poster adorns walls across campus
— often explores African-American beauty
as a theme in her pieces.
Moving to an all-girls Catholic high
school, where she studied studio art and
art history, shaped her art. "My experi
ence was very much disrespected," says the
half-black, half-German native of Ohio. "I
wasn't Catholic, I wasn't white, I wasn't mid
dle class, I didn't come from a 'good' family."
She didn't realize until coming to Stanford
that during high school she turned her artis
tic eye primarily toward black women's fea
tures, women whose beauty she did not see

in herself due to the school's oppressive
atmosphere, she says.
"I don't feel like what I do fits in with the
art programs here at Stanford," gesticulating
like a painter creating brush strokes. "It's defi
nitely not abstract or surrealist. It just seems
like everyday for me, like pictures."
Not until this year did it occur to her that
she could make a living as an artist. "I don't
think black people are encouraged in that
type of direction," she says.
Kynard, whose work also includes last
year's Women's Herstory poster, feels that
within the black community she and other
artists are supported by the CBPA and are
well-appreciated. Realizing that was a "big
part of my Stanford experience," she says.
However, the larger community is often
intimidated by African-Americans saying
"we're going to display our art form,"
Kynard says. "There's a dialogue there that's
missing ... between different communities.
"[Stanford] is such a professional pumping
joint," she says. "People get pumped in, then
they get pumped out, and they go back out
into the world and not have to see it, not have
to look at it. I feel like the arts should do that."
Many of the artists agree that
although black arts are vibrant on
campus, more black students
need to take part.
Jackson says she thinks the percentage of
African-American students who participate
in the performing arts is greater than that of
other communities.
Faculty often drive the arts scene,
Chapman says, noting CBPA director Harry
Elam's role in increasing the amount of pro
ductions and encouraging students.
Stanford's small African-American popu
lation — 8 percent of the student body —
contributes to low participation.
"When you have a small population, not
everyone's going to be creatively inclined,"
Edwards says. A high number of African-
American students major in technical fields,
she says, partly because Stanford's reputa
tion draws those kinds of students.
McKinzie adds, "For the most part, when
we come to schools like this, if we're first
generation or we're coming from a [family]
that doesn't have as much economically, the
last thing your parents encourage you to do
is go into the arts."
Many students agree that if they'd had an
inkling during their senior year of high
school that they wanted to pursue the arts
seriously, they would have taken their
tuition money elsewhere.
"If I had grown up as a child, and if some
one had said to me, 'You're an artist, you
should do this,' I wouldn't be in a place like
Stanford," Kynard says. "It's just not very
nurturing in that sense.
"I don't feel like African-American stu
dents are encouraged to say, 'OK you have
this talent in drama, go with that.'...
Stanford's not the type of place that would
steer you away from the professional schools."
While other schools are awash with per
forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■

should do this,' I wouldn't be in a place like
Stanford," Kynard says. "It's just not very
nurturing in that sense.
"I don't feel like African-American stu
dents are encouraged to say, 'OK you have
this talent in drama, go with that.'...
Stanford's not the type of place that would
steer you away from the professional schools."
While other schools are awash with per
forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■

With a characteristic embracing
gesture, rapper Aki McKinzie
explains how the arts have "filled
a void" in his life.
"Life is not life unless you can express it, in
the way you speak, in the way your body
talks, your art, your drawings," says the senior
who has freestyled his way to the peak of the
African-American arts scene at Stanford.
He shares the summit with other black
artists, writers, actors, dancers and photog
raphers who spend long hours bringing their
artistic visions to fruition. From the Roble
Dance Studio to the Little Theater stage to
the pages of a literary journal, they seek self
fulfillment and recognition from the entire
Stanford community.
McKinzie, who hails from inner-city
Memphis, started rapping in junior high.
"Rapping to me was like my rite of passage,"
he says, "since there is no traditional custom
of letting you know whether you're becom
ing a man in
* a mrA I) America, unless
I M CAM\ you're Jewish
Entering the vari
ety show Stanfunk with some of his friends
led to the creation of The 7 Principles, one
of the campus' hottest music groups.
The themes of consciousness and the
uplifting of African-American communities
pervade McKinzie's raps. His conversational
WHOLE SONGS,
style, often bubbly and excited, translates
into high energy on stage.
"The stage is the most comfortable place
for me," says McKinzie, who admires such
artists as Public Enemy and KRS-One. "It's

make a phone call," says former member
Kwame Anku, a junior.
McKinzie recalls two key performances:
one for crack kids at a San Francisco daycare
center and another at a Los Angeles anti
police-brutality rally, a couple of hours after
Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke.
After some personnel changes, the band is
regrouping and preparing for a performance
blitz. McKinzie, a mechanical engineering
major, says if the group achieves professional
success, he'll "forget all that resume chasing."
Friend and fellow musician Anku fell
in love with the guitar at age 12,
through groups like Van Halen and
Def Leppard. The dreadlocked junior, who
plays bass, keyboards and programs a drum
machine, composes acoustic, mellow songs
as well as rock and funk. The ability to com
pose, he says, is both a "gift and a curse."
"I hear whole songs, whole bass lines,
whole melodies in my head," he says. "You
feel like it's some kind of force that just
opens up your head and says, 'Hey, here's a
cool song for you,' all you have to do really is
figure out on the guitar or the keyboard
where the notes are, because you already
know what it sounds like.
"It's a curse because ... you never know
when that's gonna happen," says Anku, who
composed the music for the avant-garde play
"The Death of the Last Black Man in the
Entire World" and played an original piece
at University President Gerhard Casper's
inauguration.
"A lot of black people don't listen to rock
music," says Anku, who models his vocals
somewhat after Seal and Peter Gabriel.
"They associate that with being white —
Bon Jovi. At the same time a lot of white
people who listen to rock music don't realize
it's basically a form of black music."

Many blacks, he says, think the

House Saturday night.
The 20-member African dance group
Kuumba, a cornerstone in the
African-American community, is
preparing for its most-watched performance
of the year — Club Uj — this Saturday.
Co-director Bacardi Jackson, who joined
the group as a sophomore with no dance
experience, says that now she's "kind of
hooked on dance."
"For me, dancing is not just simply danc
ing for performance, but it almost has a spir
itual aspect to it," Jackson says. "It's a release
and it's a way to come together with every
body and to share something."
Newcomer dance group Jam Pac'd has
explored jazz, R&B, hip-hop, rap and pop for
more than a year. Co-director Maggie
Chapman decided to "get up the courage" to
form the group because "there seemed to be a
lack of forums for the type of dance that we do.
The dance department at Stanford is very mod-

ern-oriented."
Chapman, who is
white, has studied
modern, ballet,
jazz, tap and
some African
dance.
The 17-
member group
hopes to col
laborate with
local high
school kids on
a version of
the group's |
most memo
rable perfor-

mance: last
year's 10-minute mul
timedia "Piece — No
Piece," which high
lighted inner-city, black
on-black violence.

Chapman, a senior, sees
the arts as a real force for
social change and a medium
that can give kids a voice.
"[Kids] can see that art doesn't

have to be random, abstract bull
shit," she says after a Roble Studio practice
filled with 12 stretching, prancing, jumping,
clapping, swinging and undulating dancers.
While African-American singers
and dancers have a strong pres
ence on campus, black actors
and actresses are still struggling for greater
recognition from the community.
Senior drama major Greg Miller has
empowered himself: He wrote a one-man
piece, "Invisible Being, Tangible Lives,"
which he'll perform next quarter. "It's my
play on redefining the image of young black
men," he says, giddily nervous about his
upcoming solo.
"My love is acting, but as an African-
American performer, generally we all write
— [because we] want good material. I don't
know any African-American actors that
haven't tried to write."
Miller, who has acted since the ninth
grade, calls his turn as Old Man River Jordan
in"The Death of the Last Black Man" his
most powerful performance. From March 5
through 7 he'll star in the campus produc-

tion of "San Antonio
Sunset," a study of
race and class in the

19305.
The
Atlanta native
says his ethnicity
gives him "a
responsibility to
tell the truth. I
feel like my use
of my talent and
the medium is
political. I feel
like I have to
deal with reality."
He says

Rodney King's
trial reflected the negative
way society views black
men, and "if I do some
thing to put some other
image in peoples' minds,
maybe the next time there's an

incident like that they can see a
human being."
Last year's discussion of
killing the Drama Department.

shows a lack of support for the arts at
Stanford, he says."I feel supported by the
Drama Department because I made it my
own. It's a pretty white department, but I
would not say discriminatory. I don't agree
with all the practices there, but those are just
my [beliefs] as an artist."
Drama major Bridgit Evans, who has
acted in productions such as "The Duchess
of Malfi" and"The Death of the Last Black
Man," spent 14 weeks last fall at the O'Neill
Theater Center in Connecticut. While the
training did improve her skills, she realized
she doesn't want to work in that type of
social environment, where she was one of
three people of color in a group of 37 stu
dents performing European plays.
"There was a real sense of voluntary igno
rance, of not dealing with other cultural or
even gender issues," she says. "It's very easy
to get swept up into 'Oh, acting is about the
art, not about the politics,' which isn't true."
She returned from Connecticut with a
sharper vision and a clearer idea of her goals
as an African-American actress.
During her just-completed one-woman
show, "The Moonshot Tape" — which she'll

perform again during Women's Herstory
Month in March — everything she learned
about being an actress at Stanford and in the
outside world "suddenly either got trashed
or reaffirmed during this rehearsal process."
By the nature of their work, Miller,
Evans and other performing artists
are quite visible on campus. But stu
dents in the creative arts — writers, artists,
photographers — often toil in relative
obscurity.
For photographer Amy Stevens, a junior
who works mainly in 35 mm black-and
white and has been published in "Critical
Bitch," the creative arts "give more room to
show different ideas instead of having a
monolithic view of what it is to be a black
American."
However, she sees much less student par
ticipation in writing and photography than
in dance and other performing arts.
"That's why 1 think Enigma ("The
Stanford Journal of Black Expression") last
spring was such as good idea, because you
got it all in one collected volume instead of a
couple people here and a couple people
there," she says."It gave a lot more people
space to express themselves, which I think is
a great idea."
Senior Tammie Edwards, co-editor of
Enigma, hopes the second issue of the poet
ry, prose, art and photography magazine will
hit campus in the middle of spring quarter.
Recent graduates Omar Wasow and Danzy
Senna founded Enigma last year because
other venues weren't exposing different tal
ents, Edwards says.
To provide much-needed continuity for
the journal's future, Edwards set up a struc
ture in which one co-editor — this year,
junior Cheo H. Coker — will remain at
Stanford at least for one more year.
With sexuality and racial identity as some
key themes, she envisions including "as
many divergent voices as possible" in future
issues. Often in the black community voices
that are "not part of the mainstream are
pushed out," she says. "It's OK to disagree,
OK to not be all alike."
Edwards, an international relations major,
wrote a Daily column last year, has a story in
Cosmopolitan's "Life After College" issue this
month — "My Internship Got Me An In" —
and will work at Time Magazine this summer.
"I'm happiest when I'm writing," she says.
Edwards, who is considering founding a
"Vanity Fair-type magazine" to serve as a role
model to other African-Americans, says one of
her favorite themes in her writing is the idea
that African-Americans must bring their edu
cation back to their respective communities.
Artist Carmen Kynard — whose
most recent work on the Club Uj
poster adorns walls across campus
— often explores African-American beauty
as a theme in her pieces.
Moving to an all-girls Catholic high
school, where she studied studio art and
art history, shaped her art. "My experi
ence was very much disrespected," says the
half-black, half-German native of Ohio. "I
wasn't Catholic, I wasn't white, I wasn't mid
dle class, I didn't come from a 'good' family."
She didn't realize until coming to Stanford
that during high school she turned her artis
tic eye primarily toward black women's fea
tures, women whose beauty she did not see

in herself due to the school's oppressive
atmosphere, she says.
"I don't feel like what I do fits in with the
art programs here at Stanford," gesticulating
like a painter creating brush strokes. "It's defi
nitely not abstract or surrealist. It just seems
like everyday for me, like pictures."
Not until this year did it occur to her that
she could make a living as an artist. "I don't
think black people are encouraged in that
type of direction," she says.
Kynard, whose work also includes last
year's Women's Herstory poster, feels that
within the black community she and other
artists are supported by the CBPA and are
well-appreciated. Realizing that was a "big
part of my Stanford experience," she says.
However, the larger community is often
intimidated by African-Americans saying
"we're going to display our art form,"
Kynard says. "There's a dialogue there that's
missing ... between different communities.
"[Stanford] is such a professional pumping
joint," she says. "People get pumped in, then
they get pumped out, and they go back out
into the world and not have to see it, not have
to look at it. I feel like the arts should do that."
Many of the artists agree that
although black arts are vibrant on
campus, more black students
need to take part.
Jackson says she thinks the percentage of
African-American students who participate
in the performing arts is greater than that of
other communities.
Faculty often drive the arts scene,
Chapman says, noting CBPA director Harry
Elam's role in increasing the amount of pro
ductions and encouraging students.
Stanford's small African-American popu
lation — 8 percent of the student body —
contributes to low participation.
"When you have a small population, not
everyone's going to be creatively inclined,"
Edwards says. A high number of African-
American students major in technical fields,
she says, partly because Stanford's reputa
tion draws those kinds of students.
McKinzie adds, "For the most part, when
we come to schools like this, if we're first
generation or we're coming from a [family]
that doesn't have as much economically, the
last thing your parents encourage you to do
is go into the arts."
Many students agree that if they'd had an
inkling during their senior year of high
school that they wanted to pursue the arts
seriously, they would have taken their
tuition money elsewhere.
"If I had grown up as a child, and if some
one had said to me, 'You're an artist, you
should do this,' I wouldn't be in a place like
Stanford," Kynard says. "It's just not very
nurturing in that sense.
"I don't feel like African-American stu
dents are encouraged to say, 'OK you have
this talent in drama, go with that.'...
Stanford's not the type of place that would
steer you away from the professional schools."
While other schools are awash with per
forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■

generation or we're coming from a [family]
that doesn't have as much economically, the
last thing your parents encourage you to do
is go into the arts."
Many students agree that if they'd had an
inkling during their senior year of high
school that they wanted to pursue the arts
seriously, they would have taken their
tuition money elsewhere.
"If I had grown up as a child, and if some
one had said to me, 'You're an artist, you
should do this,' I wouldn't be in a place like
Stanford," Kynard says. "It's just not very
nurturing in that sense.
"I don't feel like African-American stu
dents are encouraged to say, 'OK you have
this talent in drama, go with that.'...
Stanford's not the type of place that would
steer you away from the professional schools."
While other schools are awash with per
forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■

With a characteristic embracing
gesture, rapper Aki McKinzie
explains how the arts have "filled
a void" in his life.
"Life is not life unless you can express it, in
the way you speak, in the way your body
talks, your art, your drawings," says the senior
who has freestyled his way to the peak of the
African-American arts scene at Stanford.
He shares the summit with other black
artists, writers, actors, dancers and photog
raphers who spend long hours bringing their
artistic visions to fruition. From the Roble
Dance Studio to the Little Theater stage to
the pages of a literary journal, they seek self
fulfillment and recognition from the entire
Stanford community.
McKinzie, who hails from inner-city
Memphis, started rapping in junior high.
"Rapping to me was like my rite of passage,"
he says, "since there is no traditional custom
of letting you know whether you're becom
ing a man in
* a mrA I) America, unless
I M CAM\ you're Jewish
Entering the vari
ety show Stanfunk with some of his friends
led to the creation of The 7 Principles, one
of the campus' hottest music groups.
The themes of consciousness and the
uplifting of African-American communities
pervade McKinzie's raps. His conversational
WHOLE SONGS,
style, often bubbly and excited, translates
into high energy on stage.
"The stage is the most comfortable place
for me," says McKinzie, who admires such
artists as Public Enemy and KRS-One. "It's

make a phone call," says former member
Kwame Anku, a junior.
McKinzie recalls two key performances:
one for crack kids at a San Francisco daycare
center and another at a Los Angeles anti
police-brutality rally, a couple of hours after
Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke.
After some personnel changes, the band is
regrouping and preparing for a performance
blitz. McKinzie, a mechanical engineering
major, says if the group achieves professional
success, he'll "forget all that resume chasing."
Friend and fellow musician Anku fell
in love with the guitar at age 12,
through groups like Van Halen and
Def Leppard. The dreadlocked junior, who
plays bass, keyboards and programs a drum
machine, composes acoustic, mellow songs
as well as rock and funk. The ability to com
pose, he says, is both a "gift and a curse."
"I hear whole songs, whole bass lines,
whole melodies in my head," he says. "You
feel like it's some kind of force that just
opens up your head and says, 'Hey, here's a
cool song for you,' all you have to do really is
figure out on the guitar or the keyboard
where the notes are, because you already
know what it sounds like.
"It's a curse because ... you never know
when that's gonna happen," says Anku, who
composed the music for the avant-garde play
"The Death of the Last Black Man in the
Entire World" and played an original piece
at University President Gerhard Casper's
inauguration.
"A lot of black people don't listen to rock
music," says Anku, who models his vocals
somewhat after Seal and Peter Gabriel.
"They associate that with being white —
Bon Jovi. At the same time a lot of white
people who listen to rock music don't realize
it's basically a form of black music."

WHOLE BASS LINES,

Many blacks, he says, think the
all-black rock group Living Colour
— one of his inspirations — "want

like you fall into this rhythm, and you're hit- to be white." But their messages, like Anku's,
ting syllable after syllable. It's a place where I deal with racism, social injustice, double stan
can talk and be me. I feed off the acknowl- dards and American hypocrisy, he says,
edgment of the people around me and their Anku, who through his music likes to sug
smiles. Once they start smilin' I just start gest "alternate ways of looking at things,"
goin' and I don't even worry about what wants to go to local high schools to play and
facilitate discussions. Currently

After an electrifying performance of the
song "Go Down Garvey" at the 1991 Go
Down Garvey Contest in Memorial
Auditorium — where the band captured sec-

ond place — the group's popularity grew
exponentially, with the help of the
Committee on Black Performing Arts.
The committee, created in 1972, sponsors
groups and programs and encourages stu

"What I will always brag about is that the

that could be offered so many gigs they

House Saturday night.
The 20-member African dance group
Kuumba, a cornerstone in the
African-American community, is
preparing for its most-watched performance
of the year — Club Uj — this Saturday.
Co-director Bacardi Jackson, who joined
the group as a sophomore with no dance
experience, says that now she's "kind of
hooked on dance."
"For me, dancing is not just simply danc
ing for performance, but it almost has a spir
itual aspect to it," Jackson says. "It's a release
and it's a way to come together with every
body and to share something."
Newcomer dance group Jam Pac'd has
explored jazz, R&B, hip-hop, rap and pop for
more than a year. Co-director Maggie
Chapman decided to "get up the courage" to
form the group because "there seemed to be a
lack of forums for the type of dance that we do.
The dance department at Stanford is very mod-

ern-oriented."
Chapman, who is
white, has studied
modern, ballet,
jazz, tap and
some African
dance.
The 17-
member group
hopes to col
laborate with
local high
school kids on
a version of
the group's |
most memo
rable perfor-

mance: last
year's 10-minute mul
timedia "Piece — No
Piece," which high
lighted inner-city, black
on-black violence.

Chapman, a senior, sees
the arts as a real force for
social change and a medium
that can give kids a voice.
"[Kids] can see that art doesn't

have to be random, abstract bull
shit," she says after a Roble Studio practice
filled with 12 stretching, prancing, jumping,
clapping, swinging and undulating dancers.
While African-American singers
and dancers have a strong pres
ence on campus, black actors
and actresses are still struggling for greater
recognition from the community.
Senior drama major Greg Miller has
empowered himself: He wrote a one-man
piece, "Invisible Being, Tangible Lives,"
which he'll perform next quarter. "It's my
play on redefining the image of young black
men," he says, giddily nervous about his
upcoming solo.
"My love is acting, but as an African-
American performer, generally we all write
— [because we] want good material. I don't
know any African-American actors that
haven't tried to write."
Miller, who has acted since the ninth
grade, calls his turn as Old Man River Jordan
in"The Death of the Last Black Man" his
most powerful performance. From March 5
through 7 he'll star in the campus produc-

tion of "San Antonio
Sunset," a study of
race and class in the

19305.
The
Atlanta native
says his ethnicity
gives him "a
responsibility to
tell the truth. I
feel like my use
of my talent and
the medium is
political. I feel
like I have to
deal with reality."
He says

Rodney King's
trial reflected the negative
way society views black
men, and "if I do some
thing to put some other
image in peoples' minds,
maybe the next time there's an

incident like that they can see a
human being."
Last year's discussion of
killing the Drama Department.

shows a lack of support for the arts at
Stanford, he says."I feel supported by the
Drama Department because I made it my
own. It's a pretty white department, but I
would not say discriminatory. I don't agree
with all the practices there, but those are just
my [beliefs] as an artist."
Drama major Bridgit Evans, who has
acted in productions such as "The Duchess
of Malfi" and"The Death of the Last Black
Man," spent 14 weeks last fall at the O'Neill
Theater Center in Connecticut. While the
training did improve her skills, she realized
she doesn't want to work in that type of
social environment, where she was one of
three people of color in a group of 37 stu
dents performing European plays.
"There was a real sense of voluntary igno
rance, of not dealing with other cultural or
even gender issues," she says. "It's very easy
to get swept up into 'Oh, acting is about the
art, not about the politics,' which isn't true."
She returned from Connecticut with a
sharper vision and a clearer idea of her goals
as an African-American actress.
During her just-completed one-woman
show, "The Moonshot Tape" — which she'll

perform again during Women's Herstory
Month in March — everything she learned
about being an actress at Stanford and in the
outside world "suddenly either got trashed
or reaffirmed during this rehearsal process."
By the nature of their work, Miller,
Evans and other performing artists
are quite visible on campus. But stu
dents in the creative arts — writers, artists,
photographers — often toil in relative
obscurity.
For photographer Amy Stevens, a junior
who works mainly in 35 mm black-and
white and has been published in "Critical
Bitch," the creative arts "give more room to
show different ideas instead of having a
monolithic view of what it is to be a black
American."
However, she sees much less student par
ticipation in writing and photography than
in dance and other performing arts.
"That's why 1 think Enigma ("The
Stanford Journal of Black Expression") last
spring was such as good idea, because you
got it all in one collected volume instead of a
couple people here and a couple people
there," she says."It gave a lot more people
space to express themselves, which I think is
a great idea."
Senior Tammie Edwards, co-editor of
Enigma, hopes the second issue of the poet
ry, prose, art and photography magazine will
hit campus in the middle of spring quarter.
Recent graduates Omar Wasow and Danzy
Senna founded Enigma last year because
other venues weren't exposing different tal
ents, Edwards says.
To provide much-needed continuity for
the journal's future, Edwards set up a struc
ture in which one co-editor — this year,
junior Cheo H. Coker — will remain at
Stanford at least for one more year.
With sexuality and racial identity as some
key themes, she envisions including "as
many divergent voices as possible" in future
issues. Often in the black community voices
that are "not part of the mainstream are
pushed out," she says. "It's OK to disagree,
OK to not be all alike."
Edwards, an international relations major,
wrote a Daily column last year, has a story in
Cosmopolitan's "Life After College" issue this
month — "My Internship Got Me An In" —
and will work at Time Magazine this summer.
"I'm happiest when I'm writing," she says.
Edwards, who is considering founding a
"Vanity Fair-type magazine" to serve as a role
model to other African-Americans, says one of
her favorite themes in her writing is the idea
that African-Americans must bring their edu
cation back to their respective communities.
Artist Carmen Kynard — whose
most recent work on the Club Uj
poster adorns walls across campus
— often explores African-American beauty
as a theme in her pieces.
Moving to an all-girls Catholic high
school, where she studied studio art and
art history, shaped her art. "My experi
ence was very much disrespected," says the
half-black, half-German native of Ohio. "I
wasn't Catholic, I wasn't white, I wasn't mid
dle class, I didn't come from a 'good' family."
She didn't realize until coming to Stanford
that during high school she turned her artis
tic eye primarily toward black women's fea
tures, women whose beauty she did not see

in herself due to the school's oppressive
atmosphere, she says.
"I don't feel like what I do fits in with the
art programs here at Stanford," gesticulating
like a painter creating brush strokes. "It's defi
nitely not abstract or surrealist. It just seems
like everyday for me, like pictures."
Not until this year did it occur to her that
she could make a living as an artist. "I don't
think black people are encouraged in that
type of direction," she says.
Kynard, whose work also includes last
year's Women's Herstory poster, feels that
within the black community she and other
artists are supported by the CBPA and are
well-appreciated. Realizing that was a "big
part of my Stanford experience," she says.
However, the larger community is often
intimidated by African-Americans saying
"we're going to display our art form,"
Kynard says. "There's a dialogue there that's
missing ... between different communities.
"[Stanford] is such a professional pumping
joint," she says. "People get pumped in, then
they get pumped out, and they go back out
into the world and not have to see it, not have
to look at it. I feel like the arts should do that."
Many of the artists agree that
although black arts are vibrant on
campus, more black students
need to take part.
Jackson says she thinks the percentage of
African-American students who participate
in the performing arts is greater than that of
other communities.
Faculty often drive the arts scene,
Chapman says, noting CBPA director Harry
Elam's role in increasing the amount of pro
ductions and encouraging students.
Stanford's small African-American popu
lation — 8 percent of the student body —
contributes to low participation.
"When you have a small population, not
everyone's going to be creatively inclined,"
Edwards says. A high number of African-
American students major in technical fields,
she says, partly because Stanford's reputa
tion draws those kinds of students.
McKinzie adds, "For the most part, when
we come to schools like this, if we're first
generation or we're coming from a [family]
that doesn't have as much economically, the
last thing your parents encourage you to do
is go into the arts."
Many students agree that if they'd had an
inkling during their senior year of high
school that they wanted to pursue the arts
seriously, they would have taken their
tuition money elsewhere.
"If I had grown up as a child, and if some
one had said to me, 'You're an artist, you
should do this,' I wouldn't be in a place like
Stanford," Kynard says. "It's just not very
nurturing in that sense.
"I don't feel like African-American stu
dents are encouraged to say, 'OK you have
this talent in drama, go with that.'...
Stanford's not the type of place that would
steer you away from the professional schools."
While other schools are awash with per
forming and creative arts groups, here "peo
ple are constantly trying to put something
together," Edwards says. "You hear a lot from
students about their frustration."
Anku says there's no solid forum for black
arts at Stanford, no regular place where
black artists perform. "It's something that
still has a way to go," he says, "but I definite
ly see it moving in a positive direction." ■
