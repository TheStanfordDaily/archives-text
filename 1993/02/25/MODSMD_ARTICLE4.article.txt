# Sororities rush Rush
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Sorority Rush will begin March 29 this year
— one week earlier than normal — because of
religious and academic conflicts.
"If we were to hold Rush at the same time as be
fore, namely the second week of the quarter, it
would have conflicted with Passover, Good Friday
and Easter," said Debbie Watson, an Inter-Soror
ity Council representative. "Too many people ob
serve these holidays for it us to hold it then."
So, Watson said, the ISC decided to move
Rush to the first week of spring quarter.
Although starting Rush during the third week
of the quarter was considered, "this was not rea
sonable due to MCATs, GREs and midterms,"
Watson said. The decision on the first-week
Rush was "pretty much unanimous," she added.
Lillian Huang, president of the Chi Omega
sorority, said the earlier date is a good choice "since
it may encourage more people to rush who might
otherwise not be able to attend due to midterms."
"Also, having it the second week might have
pushed people away who are very active in their
religion," she added. "I think it's a really good de
cision. It will be harder on the sororities, but it
will make Rush as fair and diverse as possible."
Anne Conaway, Rush coordinator for the Delta
Delta Delta sorority, also said that the earlier
Rush "poses some difficulties the
first time around."
"With it being early, we lack
the week of lag-time to prepare,"
she said.
"Therefore, we are having to play

it by ear. A lot of the last minute
details are going to have to be left
for that Monday since a lot of
people are going to be away over
the break," she said.
Under the new schedule,
Rush will begin Tuesday, March
29, and will continue until the
following Sunday. Sorority bids
will be distributed the following
day.
