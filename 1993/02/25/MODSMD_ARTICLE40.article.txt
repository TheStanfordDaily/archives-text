Let the cliches roll
in rockers' ode to
Confederate past

The Georgia Satellites *

It's so easy to parody the world of rock 'n'
roll that it sometimes gets confusing. It's hard
to explain to your younger brother why Spinal
Tap is a joke and Guns 'N' Roses isn't. And
even harder to demonstrate how Twisted Sis
ter was kidding while Motley Crtie was dead
serious.
We're never sure if the Georgia Satellites are
kidding, because their most recent release "Let
it Rock: Best of the Georgia Satellites" employs
every '70s rock cliche in the book. A picture in
side the CD features a cartoony picture of a
young woman in boots, a denim jacket, a skirt
hiked up to her waist and an overly perky bot
tom more-than-peeking out of a pair of Con
federate-flag panties.
The mere thought of putting out a greatest
hits album in the '90s, of an '80s band playing
'70s rock, is enough to give anyone a headache.
Because more often than not, the greatest hits
compilation of a one-hit wonder proves why
they only had one hit. The Satellites' No. 2 hit
in 1987, "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" —
Bon Jovi had a stranglehold on the No. 1 spot
— is best abandoned in the '80s.
A few songs, like the mildly successful "Bat
tleship Chains" and the assortment of covers
("Don't Pass Me By" and "Let It Rock") are just
enough to make you think twice before walking
out of a frat party where they were playing.
Even "Hippy Hippy Shake" was acceptable
in the context of "Cocktail." But without
something even less palatable in the back
ground — cheap beer or Tom Cruise — not
one song on the album is able to carry itself.
Lead singer Dan Baird, the skinniest man in
rock 'n' roll, now that Axl Rose kicked his
heroin habit, possesses the playful sense of
humor that 14-year-old boys love. His recent
solo success with "I Love You Period" prove
his province in a pop/top-40 culture where no
one listens hard enough to realize his lyrics are
more stupid than clever.
Even if the band is just an extended parody
of all that is atrocious in Lynyrd Skynyrd, it still
isn't funny enough to listen to for 75 minutes.
And if they're not kidding, well, then maybe
it's time for them to realize that hard-rocking,
angst-ridden, white suburban teenagers have
finally gotten over the Civil War. They moved
to Seattle.

Susie goes pop
but doesn't sell
her soul to do it

Suzanne Vega

Suzanne Vega isn't the nice girl she used
to be.
Maybe it all started with "Tom's Album,"
a compilation of various artists doing covers
and remixes of Suzanne Vega's revolutionary
song "Tom's Diner," off of her 1987 A&M re
lease "Solitude Standing." Most of the music
on "Tom's Album" has a heavy dance beat,
generous bass and sampling overlays. It
seemed as though the socially conscious au
thor of "Luka" suddenly became a commer
cially successful hip-pop artist.
True, some of the tracks contain the same
folksy style she is so well known for (such as
"Blood Sings" and "Song of Sand"), but
many are much more hip. Yet in this switch
to more upbeat music (in tempo, not neces
sarily in subject matter) Vega never loses her
intimacy. The single "Bad Wisdom" tells the
tale of a young woman who discovers the
limitations of the world: "Mother I'm cut at
the root like a weed 'cause there's no one to
hear my small story / Just like a woman who
walks in the street I will pay for my life with
my body."
The more upbeat tracks on the album,
"Rock in this Pocket," "99.9 F°" and "Fat
Man & Dancing Girl," may be more main
stream in their sound, but also contain the
traditional intriguing lyrics for which she is
so well known, saving the album from selling
out.
Listening to Suzanne Vega is a personal
experience. She writes songs that make you
feel like you are reading her diary — without
her permission, telling vivid stories that you
can draw pictures of in your mind. Tracks
like "The Queen and the Soldier" and "Ca
lypso," off her first two albums, tell complete
tales, and are not just a repetitive chorus

strung together by "boy-meets girl/loses
girl/scratches-head" stanzas. They achieve a
real sadness of their own that's simple and
inherent rather then self-pitying, like say,
"Angie" by the Rolling Stones.
In addition, this album accomplishes
something particularly noteworthy: you
never want to skip a track. And that, in
today's hit-single music world, is praise
enough.

Long selections
make for greater
hits on live album

Genesis

Genesis doesn't lie.
At least not on the album cover of the sec
ond volume of their latest release "genesis
live: the way we walk," aptly subtitled "The
Longs." The shortest song on the album is
over six minutes; the longest, over 20.
But in this case, longer means better.
The length of each selection allows the
group to add in some incredible instrumen
tal segments that weren't included on the
original releases of songs such as "Fading
Lights." A dynamic, upbeat section in the
middle of this song poignantly contrasts
with the sadness of the theme of good-byes
and lost memories that dominates the lyrics.
Length is also an advantage in the "Old
Medley" which combines five '70s Genesis
originals which have little in common except
the decade (and the fact that all but die-hard
fans forgot them long ago), using instru
mental as transition pieces.
The combinations in the "Old Medley"
provide a roller-coaster ride for the listener as
the music moves through every range of emo
tion. They combine the infinitely mellow
"Music Box" and the intense, pressure-filled
"Dance on a Volcano" with "I Know What I
Like," Genesis' robotic-sounding tale of pref

erences — not the upbeat '80s Huey Lewis
and the News' song that shares the same title.
The live performance of the music adds
emotion and depth to relatively unpubli
cized epics such as the eminently mournful
"Driving the Last Spike" — a tale of work
men trying to survive in a system designed to
hold them down. And the recorded applause
of the audience and the concert photos on
the inside of the album cover make listeners
think they are at a Genesis concert.
Well, almost.

Hold the Geritol:
Stones' vocalist
keeps on truckin'

MickJagger

This album was supposed to suck. Mick
Jagger's last two solo outings convinced both
fans and critics that Keith Richards was the
heart and soul of the Rolling Stones. On the
Stones' last release, the overpraised "Steel
Wheels," Jagger illustrated that, while he
could still sing his ass off, his lyrical muse
was on vacation. Besides, Jagger turns 50 this
year. Can a 50-year-old produce a great rock
and-roll album?
Let's face it, the man had a lot to prove.
And on "Wandering Spirit," Jagger proves it
with a vengeance. His voice has never sound
ed better. His lyrics have regained their caus
tic sharpness. And despite the fact that the
album's crisp sound could benefit from a
dose of Keith Richards rawness, "Wandering
Spirit" sounds like a classic Stones album.
The album's eclectic nature reflects Jag
ger's confidence in the range and vitality of
his abilities. Even though some of the music
derives from certain points in the Stones' ca
reer, it never sounds derivative.
For a taste of the '70s, we're treated the the
disco-funk of "Sweet Thing." With Jagger's
inspired falsetto and a disco rhythm, the
song recalls the Stones' "Miss You" period.
Moving back in time, we get the traditional
country of "Evening Gown." It sounds like
something the Stones' friend and country-rock
legend Gram Parsons would have sung. It cer
tainly ranks with the Stones' best country tunes.
The folk-influenced "Hang on to Me
Tonight" and the gospel "Out of Focus" would
sound right at home on "Exile on Main St." An
Elizabethan-sounding ballad, "Angel in My
Heart," is a descendant of the early Stones'
"Lady Jane" and "As Tears Go By." And the
Celtic folk ballad "Handsome Molly," com
plete with Jagger's attempt to sound like an
Irish crooner, is reminiscent of the track "Fac
tory Girl" on the album "Beggar's Banquet."
But it's songs like "Wired All Night," and
"Put Me in the Trash" that prove Jagger can
still spew bile, sing sex and rock 'n' roll with
the best of them.
He occasionally goes too far, turning
James Brown's "Think" into a Led Zep
plin/cheese-metal number. But for the most
part, Jagger takes the blistering rock of clas
sic albums like "Sticky Fingers" and "Exile"
and makes it sound modern.
On "Put Me In the Trash," Jagger laments,
"Yeah you put me in the trash/ You gave me
up for lost." Finally, Jagger climbs back out of
the trash to show us that we gave up too soon.
