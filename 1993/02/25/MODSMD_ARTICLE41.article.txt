en have danced to-
I gether in flocks of
I cultures and soci
eties for centuries.
However, the formalization of theatrical
dance in relatively recent western history
not only foreshortened the male role to ro
mantic and virtuoso partnering with
women, but also fostered the notion of ef
feminacy in male dancers that has plagued
the art form to varying degrees ever since.
Redefining the image of men in dance
became a crusade for dancer/choreograph
er Ted Shawn, who introduced an earthy
masculinity and humanity in male dancing
that undercut the stiff, heroic and senti
mental styles of the past.
To commemorate the 100 th anniversary
of Shawn's birth, his vision and attainment
of dignity for men in dance and the innov
ative spirit that his revolution unleashed,
the festival premiered "Jacobs Pillow Men
Dancers: The Ted Shawn Legacy" in 1991.
Presenting 10 historical and contemporary
works, the company traces a range of dance
stylizations and movement qualities that
men in dance have contributed.
The troupe brought its talents to San
Francisco last weekend as part of its 40-per
formance tour throughout the continental
U.S. and Europe. The tour began in 1992
and will conclude in April of this year. The
Bay Area performance was a fitting testa
ment to Shawn and his artistic concepts.
Shawn formed his all-male troupe, Ted
Shawn and His Men Dancers, in the 19305,
following the dissolution of Denishawn,
the exotically eclectic dance company and
school he directed with then-wife an- fel
low modern-dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis.
Shawn and his company lived at Jacob's
Pillow, the Massachusetts farm he had
bought and transformed into his artistic
headquarters. There, he built the first the
ater in America intended specifically for
dance and, in 1942, founded the Jacob's Pil
low Dance Festival, which endures to this
day.
The great ballet choreographer George
Balanchine was known to have declared —
and staunchly believed — that "Dance is
woman."
However, nothing about the Jacob's Pil
low's Men Dancers' program lends cre
dence to this view. Indeed, their perfor
mances last Friday and Saturday at the
Herbst Theater in San Francisco offered
such impulse and artistic diversity that one
didn't miss the women at all.
The most dramatic piece rendered was
an excerpt of one of dancer/choreograph
er Jose Limon's later works, "The Unsung"
(1970), a tribute to American Indian her
itage and sacrifice. Limon's choreography
was famous for its symbolism, interpreta
tion of powerful emotions and the animal
grace Limon himself naturally exuded as a
performer. His movements revealed
themes and relationships rather than
technique, and his controlled manipula
tion of physical tensions was paradoxical
ly lyrical.
This composition for eight men sum
mons a visceral exaltation, with broad ges
tures and simple, but potent, dynamics im
parting a feeling of magnitude. That the

dance happens in silence and the men are
identically dressed in nothing but plain
trousers underscores the quiet nobility and
directness of the characters (Geronimo,
Black Hawk and Sitting Bull among them).
Dances performed in silence must have an
inherent musicality, and Limon's rhythms
here are loud and clear.
The piece begins with the men forming a
circle, an arrangement Limon revisits
throughout the dance. Not only is the circle
utilized as an effective choreographic de
vice, but it also heightens the ethnic theme
by becoming a metaphor for sacred ritual
and eternity.
Judging from audience response, the
evening's most winning offering was an
ebullient, inventive duet from Demetrius
Klein's "The Garden Alone." Danced to
"Amazing Grace," it delivers an honest, ten
der and rough-and-tumble portrait of the
friendship of two young men, whose bond

is played out as a seamless chain of inter
actions as they casually fling themselves and
each other about with energetic abandon
and spontaneity. The piece does not seem
like choreography, and that is perhaps its
essential virtue.
Shawn's own solo, "The Mevlevi
Dervish" (1929), was featured, representing
his early predilection for, and experimenta
tion with, exotic dance forms. The whirling
dance of the mevlevi dervish is a ritual for
inducing an ecstatic trance and achieving
communion with God. The body, which
must remain straight while continuously
turning in place, represents the axis of the
universe. Arms are outstretched, the right
palm turned upward to heaven and the left
palm downward to earth.
In Shawn's solo, the dancer wears a tradi
tional red and white costume and tall fez
hat, his ample skirt spreading out like an
umbrella around him while his revolutions

gain velocity. His
arms are the exclu
sive instruments of
expression, enact
ing the conflict be
tween earthly and
spiritual yearnings.
The steady tempo,
vertiginous turns
and emblematic
gesturing are
adroitly negotiated
by the company's
senior dancer.
The sombre, hyp
notic and serenely
abstract "Ocellus,"
conceived in 1972
by members of Pi
lobolus, epitomiz
ing their distinctive
handling of contin
uous contact ma
neuvers, was the
program's most
contrasting piece.
However, its mes
merizing quality
notwithstanding, it
possesses the same
structural clarity
and compelling
force that underlie
the other choreo
graphies. In slow,
steady synchrony,
four men glide over,
under and around
each other like well
oiled parts of a me
chanical assembly
— their smoothly
sustained move
ments indicating
both gravity and
weightlessness at
once.
1930s footage of
Shawn and his men
dancers performing
"Kinetic Molpai,"
arguably his most
successful work,
played at intervals
during the perfor-

mance (the molpai were the ancient art
forms that preceded the development of
drama, dance, music and poetry).
The program closed with a reconstruct
ed version of "Kinetic Molpai," in which
Shawn stressed the vigor and muscularity
of his dancers. The piece teems with ideas
and delights in a dynamic flow of motion.
Frequently chiseled in brawny poses, the
men do come across a bit like laborers of the
world in rebellion, but this is simply a
"problem" of the era.
Revivals of this piece often have been
cited as dated, but merely replacing the
canned music with the original live piano
accompaniment would go a long way to
ward reinfusing the piece with some of its
former immediacy.
After all, recorded music was unknown
to early audiences, and it is their experience
we'd like to share. ■

must remain straight while continuously
turning in place, represents the axis of the
universe. Arms are outstretched, the right
palm turned upward to heaven and the left
palm downward to earth.
In Shawn's solo, the dancer wears a tradi
tional red and white costume and tall fez
hat, his ample skirt spreading out like an
umbrella around him while his revolutions

gain velocity. His
arms are the exclu

expression, enact

spiritual yearnings.

The sombre, hyp

abstract "Ocellus,"

program's most
contrasting piece.
However, its mes
merizing quality
notwithstanding, it
possesses the same
structural clarity
and compelling
force that underlie
the other choreo
graphies. In slow,
steady synchrony,
four men glide over,
under and around
each other like well
oiled parts of a me

"Kinetic Molpai,"
arguably his most
successful work,

during the perfor-

mance (the molpai were the ancient art
forms that preceded the development of
drama, dance, music and poetry).
The program closed with a reconstruct
ed version of "Kinetic Molpai," in which
Shawn stressed the vigor and muscularity
of his dancers. The piece teems with ideas
and delights in a dynamic flow of motion.
Frequently chiseled in brawny poses, the
men do come across a bit like laborers of the
world in rebellion, but this is simply a
"problem" of the era.
Revivals of this piece often have been
cited as dated, but merely replacing the
canned music with the original live piano
accompaniment would go a long way to
ward reinfusing the piece with some of its
former immediacy.
After all, recorded music was unknown
to early audiences, and it is their experience
we'd like to share. ■

en have danced to-
I gether in flocks of
I cultures and soci
eties for centuries.
However, the formalization of theatrical
dance in relatively recent western history
not only foreshortened the male role to ro
mantic and virtuoso partnering with
women, but also fostered the notion of ef
feminacy in male dancers that has plagued
the art form to varying degrees ever since.
Redefining the image of men in dance
became a crusade for dancer/choreograph
er Ted Shawn, who introduced an earthy
masculinity and humanity in male dancing
that undercut the stiff, heroic and senti
mental styles of the past.
To commemorate the 100 th anniversary
of Shawn's birth, his vision and attainment
of dignity for men in dance and the innov
ative spirit that his revolution unleashed,
the festival premiered "Jacobs Pillow Men
Dancers: The Ted Shawn Legacy" in 1991.
Presenting 10 historical and contemporary
works, the company traces a range of dance
stylizations and movement qualities that
men in dance have contributed.
The troupe brought its talents to San
Francisco last weekend as part of its 40-per
formance tour throughout the continental
U.S. and Europe. The tour began in 1992
and will conclude in April of this year. The
Bay Area performance was a fitting testa
ment to Shawn and his artistic concepts.
Shawn formed his all-male troupe, Ted
Shawn and His Men Dancers, in the 19305,
following the dissolution of Denishawn,
the exotically eclectic dance company and
school he directed with then-wife an- fel
low modern-dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis.
Shawn and his company lived at Jacob's
Pillow, the Massachusetts farm he had
bought and transformed into his artistic
headquarters. There, he built the first the
ater in America intended specifically for
dance and, in 1942, founded the Jacob's Pil
low Dance Festival, which endures to this
day.
The great ballet choreographer George
Balanchine was known to have declared —
and staunchly believed — that "Dance is
woman."
However, nothing about the Jacob's Pil
low's Men Dancers' program lends cre
dence to this view. Indeed, their perfor
mances last Friday and Saturday at the
Herbst Theater in San Francisco offered
such impulse and artistic diversity that one
didn't miss the women at all.
The most dramatic piece rendered was
an excerpt of one of dancer/choreograph
er Jose Limon's later works, "The Unsung"
(1970), a tribute to American Indian her
itage and sacrifice. Limon's choreography
was famous for its symbolism, interpreta
tion of powerful emotions and the animal
grace Limon himself naturally exuded as a
performer. His movements revealed
themes and relationships rather than
technique, and his controlled manipula
tion of physical tensions was paradoxical
ly lyrical.
This composition for eight men sum
mons a visceral exaltation, with broad ges
tures and simple, but potent, dynamics im
parting a feeling of magnitude. That the

dance happens in silence and the men are
identically dressed in nothing but plain
trousers underscores the quiet nobility and
directness of the characters (Geronimo,
Black Hawk and Sitting Bull among them).
Dances performed in silence must have an
inherent musicality, and Limon's rhythms
here are loud and clear.
The piece begins with the men forming a
circle, an arrangement Limon revisits
throughout the dance. Not only is the circle
utilized as an effective choreographic de
vice, but it also heightens the ethnic theme
by becoming a metaphor for sacred ritual
and eternity.
Judging from audience response, the
evening's most winning offering was an
ebullient, inventive duet from Demetrius
Klein's "The Garden Alone." Danced to
"Amazing Grace," it delivers an honest, ten
der and rough-and-tumble portrait of the
friendship of two young men, whose bond

is played out as a seamless chain of inter
actions as they casually fling themselves and
each other about with energetic abandon
and spontaneity. The piece does not seem
like choreography, and that is perhaps its
essential virtue.
Shawn's own solo, "The Mevlevi
Dervish" (1929), was featured, representing
his early predilection for, and experimenta
tion with, exotic dance forms. The whirling
dance of the mevlevi dervish is a ritual for
inducing an ecstatic trance and achieving
communion with God. The body, which
must remain straight while continuously
turning in place, represents the axis of the
universe. Arms are outstretched, the right
palm turned upward to heaven and the left
palm downward to earth.
