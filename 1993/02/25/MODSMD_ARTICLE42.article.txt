■ Army of Darkness
Sam Raimi's latest addition to his hit
"Evil Dead" series is a shamelessly en
tertaining joyride. Our hero, Ash (Bruce
Campbell), finds himself trapped in me
dieval England, where he must defeat
the hordes of the undead and return to
the present. The fight sequences, spe
cial effects and cinematography are all
topmotch, rivalling any blockbuster.
Mindless fun. R
■The Cemetery Club
The hot new trend in Hollywood
movies is elderly Jewish widows
looking for love. But this screen
adaptation of Ivan Menchell's hit play
goes far beyond "Used People" 's
cheap laughs for a truly poignant
look at how people can go on after
their partner's death. The trio of
Academy Award-nominated actress
es (Ellen Burstyn, Diane l_add and
Olympia Dukakis) perform like a
longtime ensemble, matched only by
Bill Duke's sensitive direction. PG-13
■The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's got
America abuzz? Well you won't find
out, unless you see writer-director
Neil Jordan's offbeat hit. Stephen
Rea and newcomer Jaye Davidson
are at the top of their game in this
brilliant web of love and intrigue in
volving the 1.R.A., a British soldier
and an enigmatic hairdresser. Nomi
nated for six Academy Awards. R

The Temp
Lara Flyn Boyle's killer secretary
joins the pantheon of psychotic
femme fatales. She joins a baked
goods company and promptly helps
her boss ascend through the com
pany ranks. But when low-cut blous
es and skirts riding high on her
shapely legs aren't enough to se
cure her a promotion — well hell
hath no fury like a woman trapped
beneath the glass ceiling. R
■Tousles Matins du Monde
The Depardieus, p6re and fils, star
as the young and old Marin Marais, a
virtuoso viol player in the court of
Louis XIV. As a swaggering, hormon
al youth, he seeks music lessons
from the brilliant Sainte Colombo
(Jean-Pierre Marielle). But his cal
lous behavior results in tragedy and
heartbreak, two lessons he must
learn before he can transcend mere
talent. A visual and aural master
piece. Unrated
Untamed Heart
It's hard to like a film that uses the near
rape of a woman as a plot device in a ro
mantic comedy. Christian Slater sheds
his Jack Nicholson impressions for a
grungy, Mickey Rourkesque look as
the mute-by-choice Adam. Marisa
Tomei plays the waitress who loves
him, but her ditzy-kooky act grates on
the audience's nerves. PG-13
