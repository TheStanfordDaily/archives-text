Black History Month may almost be over, but that doesn't mean
you can't enjoy the wealth of black-themed films available on
video all year long.
Before Bill Cosby sold out with Leonard Part VI and Ghost Dad,
he co-starred with Sidney Poitier in a series of comedies which included
Uptown Saturday Night and Let's Do It Again. The two actors play
a pair of mischievous con men in the movies, both directed by Poitier
himself. These films will keep you in stitches as you pray that the lovable
but-lawless duo can keep one step ahead of the police and the mob.
Perhaps the most audacious film debut since Spike Lee's She's
Gotta Have It is Yale Drama grad Wendell B. Harris' Chameleon
Street. Harris, who wrote and directed the work, also plays the lead,
Douglas Street, a pathological liar who impersonates a Time maga
zine reporter, a gynecologist and a foreign-exchange student at Yale.
But Harris' insightful script uncovers the roots of Street's insanity:
the difficulty of maintaining a black identity in a white world.
Black women who hope to follow in Julie Dash's footsteps have
their work cut out for them. The first black woman to direct a nation
ally distributed motion picture, her Daughters of the Dust is a vi
sual feast. This heartfelt tale of three generations of Gullah women
struggling to preserve their heritage as they emigrate to the mainland
U.S. was Dash's labor of love, completed over 10 years' time.
Finally, one of 1992's best debuts was former Corman protegÂ£ Carl
Franklin's One False Move, starring Bill Paxton and Mo' Better
Blues' Cynda Williams. This gritty film noir masterpiece follows big city
moll Williams and her drug-dealing, gun-toting partners from the brutal
mass murder that opens the film toward an inevitable showdown with
Paxton's small-town sheriff. But Franklin switches gears and turns it into
a searing look at race and gender relations in the South. Unforgettable.
