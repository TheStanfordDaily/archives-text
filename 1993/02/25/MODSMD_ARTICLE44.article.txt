The last word 0n...

Very rarely is there a television show that real
ly catches my attention.
Back in the good old days, "Real People" was
The One. Byron, Skip, Sarah and the Messy
Marvin kid showed me the wide world of Belly
Bonking, and in first grade I was convinced that
"Real People" was the reason television was
made.

Amazing grace
Tonight, at 7:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium, Stanford's
Talisman a capella group will be hosting the Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity step team and Bay Area gospel group Joy
full Noize in "Gospel Night," an evening of musical cele
bration.
Joyfull Noize is a local professional African-American a
capella group with strong roots in spiritual music. The five
member group has packed auditoriums throughout the Bay
Area and promises to present a powerful collection of
songs.
The Alpha Phi Alpha step team has entertained audi
ences at Stanford and beyond with its fast-paced dance
style. Talisman brings its soulful collection of international
rhythms to a show that will strive for the same inspiration
that gospel has provided throughout the African-American
experience and beyond.
Tickets are $3 at the door and presales will be in White
Plaza Feb. 24 and 25 from 11 to 1 p.m.

on "Different World" were enough to grab me for
it's first season. Then Lisa Bonet got hitched to
Lenny Kravitz, left the show, and the whole thing
fell apart.
But now, I have found that excitement again.
Now, my joy of television has been renewed. Now
I have regained the true happiness that television
provides.
No, it's not Bart.

Too many 'toons
OK, this is it — if you have to go to the City one time the entire
year, you will want to go to "The Best of the International Tournee
of Animation." This huge animation film event includes over 17
of the best animated shorts in the history of the festival circuit, in
cluding six Academy Award winners and three nominees. Plus
(oh yeah), this year's festival includes a special showing of the
original pilot of "Ren and Stimpy," the twisted pet pals that are
nothing short of eye-bulging, tongue-waggingly hilarious.
The Best of the Tournee will be held at the UC Theatre in
Berkeley — (510) 843-6267— and at the Gateway in San Fran
cisco, (415) 421-3353. Call for showtimes.
Tickets are $6.50 in advance, $7 at the door, and are available
at BASS.

No, it's not Billy and Allison in that cute little
apartment complex.
And no, it's not Martin and his snot-nosed kid.
No, no, my friends, it's much greater than that.
It surpasses the bounds of drama, adventure and
excitement.
It's called "Batman: The Animated Series."
And boy is it good.
