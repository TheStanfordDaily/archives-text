# Physics expert offers complex plan for the earth's future

Caltech Prof. Murray Gell-
Mann took just under an hour to
describe the environmental, eco
nomic, political, ideological and so
cial changes needed to preserve hu
manity beyond the 21st century.
Marcus Feldman, director of
the Morrison Institute of Popula
tion Biology, jokingly introduced
Gell-Mann to about 130 people in
Herrin Auditorium yesterday af
ternoon as a man "not just inter
ested in the relatively unimpor
tant world of physics."
Although Gell-Mann won the
Nobel Prize for Physics in 1969 for

— among other things — his
model of sub-atomic particles
called quarks, he is also an active
researcher in environmental sci
ence, conservation biology, arche
ology and linguistics.
Gell-Mann admitted that tack
ling a broad topic such as the path
way to a sustainable planet was
"very ambitious, and from many
points of view silly, but it still may
be worth trying to do."
"Many of our [present] problems
are old, but the stale involved is un
precedented," he said. "Our de
structive actions in the past are
greater than many people think."
For example, he said, environmen
tal destruction has occurred for

thousands of years, but only in the
past few decades has humanity
threatened to destroy the biosphere.
"The challenge for the human
race over the next few decades is to
accomplish a set of interlinked
transitions," Gell-Mann said. He
spent the rest of his talk describ
ing these transitions in detail.
The first area, demographics, is a
subject dear to the heart of the Mor
rison Institute, which sponsored
Gell-Mann's lecture. The Insti
tute's statistics show the popula
tion skyrocketing in the next three
decades.
He said some keys to slowing
this growth are educating women,
decreasing infant mortality and

phasing out traditions encourag
ing large families.
The second transition Gell-
Mann discussed was a technologi
cal one. Greater emphasis must be
focused on developing environ
mentally gentle technologies, he
said. While some small steps have
been taken in this direction, "the
bulk of the needed transitions
have yet to occur."
"There must be economic in
centives" to develop these tech
nologies, he added. Thus, he said,
an economic transition must occur
— one that accounts for"the true
costs attached to wasting re
sources." For example, if a govern
ment official accepts a bribe to

allow a forest to be cut down, the
bribe would count as a gain to the
economy while the clear-cut forest
would not be counted as a loss.
Any economy that ignores such
losses is "not really a free market —
it's theft from our future," he said.
Gell-Mann also argued for elim
inating government subsidies for
harmful industries like tobacco,
suggesting that markets should be
encouraged to change through
market mechanisms like those in
the new Clean Air Act, and not reg
ulation and "micro- management."
A third necessary transition
concerns how wealth is distrib
