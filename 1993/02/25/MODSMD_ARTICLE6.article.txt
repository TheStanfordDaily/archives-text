# Dying oak tree to get the ax
## 
### Urmimala Sarkar 
In a task fit for Paul Bunyan, one of Stanford's largest
trees, the 300-year-old heritage oak near the Mau
soleum, will be cut down in March because it is dying.
According to grounds manager Herb Fong, the
coast live oak has diplodia, a bacterial infection that
kills its branches, and cryptocline, a disease which at
tacks individual leaves.
According to a local legend, the oak was one of Lie
land Stanford's favorite trees, and he and Jane Stan
ford reportedly considered this when they chose the lo
cation of their family mausoleum. However, Fong said,
this selection may have contributed to the tree's
demise, because the asphalt surrounding the Mau
soleum stifles its roots and the neighboring landscap
ing requires off-season irrigation that the oak is not
used to.
Throughout its lifetime, the heritage oak has re
ceived a great deal of care from Stanford horticultur
ists. Several years ago, the tree was sprayed with a
fungicide but it didn't eliminate the diplodia and
cryptocline, Fong explained.
Groundskeepers have also drilled holes in the sur

rounding asphalt and installed pipes to channel
water and food to deep roots, which did prolong its life
for a few years.
Fong said that he has "tried almost everything to
save the oak," and now, there is no other option left
besides felling the tree. In fact, cutting down the tree
is almost a year overdue, Fong said.
Still, he said getting rid of the campus landmark isn't
easy. "People are really sad to see it come down," he said.
However, Fong said, a new coast live oak tree will
be planted as soon as the old one is removed. The date
of the removal has not yet been determined.
Fong said it will take a crew of groundskeepers
using a six-foot chainsaw two to three days to cut
down the mighty oak.
Fong said the old tree may be disposed of as fire
wood, but he said he has also contacted the Alumni
office and the Office of Development to see if they
have any interest in the oak. To date, however, no
definite plans for its disposal have been made.
As part of the Founders' Day celebration, a March
7 ceremony at the Mausoleum will pay tribute to the
dead tree. The event will also offer the campus its
first look at the new coast live oak.
