Canadian Prime Minister quits
OTTAWA (AP) â€” Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, battered by
all-time low popularity ratings, called it quits yesterday after
more than eight years leading a nation dogged by economic stag
nation and cultural division.
The decision ended months of speculation about his future and
set up a succession scramble in Mulroney's Progressive Conser
vative party.
But a leadership change was not expected to significantly
change policies in the United States' largest trading partner.
Battered by a three-year recession, unable to unite the country's
bickering provinces or solve its French-English rivalries, Mulroney
bowed to the inevitable, although he insisted he could have won again.
"The time has come for me to step aside," Mulroney said. "I've
done my very best for my country and my party and I look for
ward to the enthusiasm and renewal only new leadership brings."
The 53-year-old Quebec lawyer who led the Progressive Con
servative party for 10 years said he would remain in office until it
selected a new leader.
