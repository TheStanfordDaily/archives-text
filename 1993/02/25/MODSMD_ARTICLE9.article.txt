# House passes jobless benefits bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House passed
a $5.7 billion package yesterday extending job
less benefits to the long-term unemployed, the
first big-ticket item in the economic legislation
requested by President Clinton.
The House voted 254-161 to send the bill to
the Senate. The Senate Finance Committee
approved a similar measure earlier Wednesday.
Congress wants to pass the measure by
March 6, the expiration date for the current
program that extends jobless benefits for up to
an extra 26 weeks.
Supporters said the extension was needed
because the economic recovery so far hasn't
resulted in a dramatic turnaround in the jobs
market. There are still 9 million Americans
out of work, they noted.
"This so-called economic recovery failed to
put food on the tables of these Americans,"
said Rep. Bobby Rush, D-111. "We must save
these families from poverty, homelessness,
hunger and despair."

Under the bill, out-of-work Americans who
exhaust their standard, 26-weeks worth of
help would be eligible for up to another 26
weeks of benefits.
The latest extension would continue the
program through Oct. 2, 1993, so that any
worker who begins to receive benefits before
that date would continue to get benefits until
Jan. 15, 1994.
An estimated 250,000 to 300,000 workers
will exhaust their standard benefits each
month and become eligible for the extended
program; ultimately, about 2 million people
are expected to benefit from the latest exten
sion, according to congressional figures.
States with high jobless rates — those with
at least 9 percent — could provide an addi
tional 26 weeks of benefits. All other states
could provide an additional 20 weeks.
Republicans balked at the jobless benefits
bill, arguing that Democrats don't have a way
to pay for the package — the third extension of

benefits over the past two years — and it will
just run up the deficit.
"Pay for it later is not working anymore,"
said Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky. "The American
people aren't buying it."
And Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, noted Clin
ton last week said he'd offer a straightforward
budget with "no more smoke and mirrors."
"I suppose top hats and rabbits are still in
the cards," Boehner said.
But Democrats said keeping out-of-work
Americans afloat during fragile times was crit
ical to Clinton's plans for an economic turn
about. They said the $5.7 billion would be paid
for in Clinton's overall economic plan, to be
voted on in coming weeks. Democrats wrote off
GOP complaints as tired, worn-out arguments.
"Let's not let these opponents detour us
back into legislative gridlock," said Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-lU., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee and a key spon
sor of the legislation.
