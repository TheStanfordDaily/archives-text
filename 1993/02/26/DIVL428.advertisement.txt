The Stanford School of Education has an HONORS PROGRAM

the School's philosophers of education. Most undergraduate
majors can be catered to: students from engineering biology,
and economics, as well as the more traditional educational
disciplines, have recently completed the program. Juniors and
sophomores are encouraged to apply.
