TWO YEARS LATER:
ABUSES BY KUWAITIS STILL UNINVESTIGATED
Today marks the second anniversary of the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, ending the Persian Gulf War. After the war's end on 26
February 1991, scores of Palestinians, Iraqis and others "disappeared" following their arrest by Kuwaiti security forces and/or armed civilians.
Extrajudicial executions and brutal beatings at the hands of returning civilians or former resistance fighters occurred throughout the months
which followed, largely unimpeded by the restored Kuwaiti government. Many instances of torture, arbitrary deportation, rape and other human
rights violations from this period are as of yet uninvestigated by the Kuwaiti authorities. Although the abuses have now stopped, at least 79
cases of disappearances remain unresolved, and the government is taking no apparent steps to investigate these occurrences.
We, the undersigned members of the Stanford University community, urge the Kuwaiti authorities to see that an immediate investigation
is conducted into the cases of'Awatif Qasim Muhammad Ali al-Maliki and the other 78 men and women listed in Amnesty International's
October 1992 report. This investigation should be independent and impartial, establishing the whereabouts of these people and resulting in the
bringing to justice of those found to be responsible for perpetrating the postwar abuses. Our conviction that Kuwait must establish
responsibility for these abuses is in no way to diminish the significance of atrocities committed by Iraqi forces during the occupation of Kuwait.
We firmly believe, however, that Kuwait must be judged according to internationally recognized standards and not in comparison to the brutality
of other nations.
