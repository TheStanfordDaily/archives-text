has brought a renewed sense of academic
purpose to a campus shaken by political
scandals.
Faculty members, who were bitterly di
vided by the indirect-cost controversy two
years ago and spent much of last year draw
ing up plans to slash the budget, welcome
the chance to return to academics.
"Stanford has spent a lot of time out on
a number of limbs, and it's nice to climb
back closer to the trunk — to think about
teaching and research, which is what we
should be doing," said Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner.
The low-key approach has also succeeded
in deflecting the charges of arrogance that
dogged Donald Kennedy in his last years as

president. Local news reports that once
stung Stanford are now almost unrelenting
ly positive. "Calm Again At The Farm: Stan
ford Weathers Storm of Scandal," read one
San Francisco Chronicle headline.
While some have missed the dynamism
and vigor of Kennedy's presidency, most
faculty say they are willing to exchange it in
return for relative tranquility.
"Bumptiousness can slide into hubris
rather quickly," said Psychology Prof. Al
bert Hastorf, provost under Kennedy from
1980 to 1984. "I think we were seen as an in
stitution that may have verged on what I'll
call excessive pride. It's quite refreshing to
have a somewhat calm hand at the helm."
While the limelight seemed natural
for Kennedy, the more reserved
Casper prefers to remain in the
background; he has said a number of times
that he is uncomfortable with the intense
publicity that has surrounded him. "I like
to work quietly away at problems," Casper
said. "I don't care much for headlines."

"I like to work quietly away at problems," says University President Gerhard Casper, whose busy schedule allows him to
spend little time in his office.
