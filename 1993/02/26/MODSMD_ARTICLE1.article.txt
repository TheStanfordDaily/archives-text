tone that has
largely kept Stan
ford out of the

headlines, Casper
has brought a renewed sense of academic
purpose to a campus shaken by political
scandals.
Faculty members, who were bitterly di
vided by the indirect-cost controversy two
years ago and spent much of last year draw
ing up plans to slash the budget, welcome
the chance to return to academics.
"Stanford has spent a lot of time out on
a number of limbs, and it's nice to climb
back closer to the trunk — to think about
teaching and research, which is what we
should be doing," said Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner.
The low-key approach has also succeeded
in deflecting the charges of arrogance that
dogged Donald Kennedy in his last years as

president. Local news reports that once
stung Stanford are now almost unrelenting
ly positive. "Calm Again At The Farm: Stan
ford Weathers Storm of Scandal," read one
San Francisco Chronicle headline.
While some have missed the dynamism
and vigor of Kennedy's presidency, most
faculty say they are willing to exchange it in
return for relative tranquility.
"Bumptiousness can slide into hubris
rather quickly," said Psychology Prof. Al
bert Hastorf, provost under Kennedy from
1980 to 1984. "I think we were seen as an in
stitution that may have verged on what I'll
call excessive pride. It's quite refreshing to
have a somewhat calm hand at the helm."
While the limelight seemed natural
for Kennedy, the more reserved
Casper prefers to remain in the
background; he has said a number of times
that he is uncomfortable with the intense
publicity that has surrounded him. "I like
to work quietly away at problems," Casper
said. "I don't care much for headlines."
He has been reluctant to map out a

"I like to work quietly away at problems," says University President Gerhard Casper, whose busy schedule allows him to
spend little time in his office.
grand plan for Stanford, focusing
instead on the less glamorous
task of putting his own stamp on
the administration. He stream
lined the top bureaucracy in early
September, eliminating six of 10
vice presidencies and reducing
the number of high-level meet
ings — moves well-received by a
faculty wary of a growing admin
istration.
Last month, he announced a
proposal to restructure the School
of Humanities and Sciences, Stan
ford's largest school, and appoint
ed an associate dean to supervise
graduate policy.
And in December, when Stan
ford became one of the first
schools nationwide to provide ben
efits to the homosexual partners
of its faculty and staff, the issue
was decided without a politically
charged debate. It was an
approach encouraged by Casper,
The issue over the
speech code is a
phony issue — that's
not a real issue
That is not a
matter of any great
importance.'
— Gerhard Casper
who avoided stating his own opin
ions publicly.
While many call Casper's style
refreshing, others say they still
find him difficult to pin down, less
readily accessible than Kennedy.
"His positions are like his name —
ghost-like," said junior Jason Sny
der, a student member of the
Board of Trustees' academic policy
committee.
Kennedy had established such a
public presence, through his morn
ing jogs to the Dish, frequent visits
to dormitories, and energetic advo
cacy of Stanford sports, that any
successor might suffer by compari
son.
But Casper — who has visited
several dorms, attended football
games, lectured in a CIV class, and
met with student groups — takes
offense at people who criticize him
for not maintaining a high enough
public profile.
"I have been bewildered," he
said, "because I am actually out
there, but unless one makes head
lines one doesn't seem to be per
forming any function."
Casper's speaking style reflects

his quiet, analytical nature. He
prefers clauses and caveats to what
he derisively calls "sound bites."
He searches for precise language,
revising and replacing phrases as
he speaks. And he avoids taking
explicit sides on issues, dwelling
instead on their complexities.
His cautious manner contrasts
sharply with Kennedy's, a forceful
speaker whose blunt pronounce
ments conveyed an impression of
robust single-mindedness. And it
also makes Casper less immediate
ly engaging than his predecessor.
"I think Kennedy was more fun
to listen to," said graduate student
David Bradfute, a former ASSU
senator. Kennedy, he said, had a
"real gift" for distilling issues to
their essence and making them
accessible. While he praised Casper
as a "very intelligent man" able to
grasp "complex ideas at multiple
levels," Bradfute said he would
prefer to see Casper crystallize
issues more.
Many faculty, however, view
Casper's style as a welcome
change. Kennedy's self-assurance
— and his tendency to make public
statements on issues they saw as
tangential to the University's aca
demics — eventually began to
grate.
"I'm not so happy about the
president being up-front on gener
al social issues, where I'm not sure
the University has any particular
prerogative or wisdom," Krasner
said.
And whereas Kennedy was
sometimes accused of monopoliz
ing debate in Faculty Senate meet
ings, Casper is more deferential,
carefully preparing statements in
advance and rarely entering into
discussions otherwise.
"The reason his style is refresh
ing is because it's calm, genial and
not given to statements filled with
bravado," said English Prof. Ron
Rebholz.
Casper's handling of the
domestic partners issue is
perhaps the best example of
his tendency to work quietly
behind the scenes, withholding
his own opinion while he gathers
other perspectives.
The proposal — to extend Uni
versity benefits to the unmarried
domestic partners of heterosexual
and homosexual faculty and staff
— was first considered by the Fac
ulty Senate in spring 1991, during
Kennedy's presidency.
Shelved for further considera
tion, it became one of the issues
waiting for Casper when he
assumed the presidency. He
immediately decided not to state
his own views on the issue, both
to allow others a chance to speak
their mind and to let the trustees
consider it without running the

risk of contradicting their new
presiden.
Casper also wanted to avoid a
mistake that Kennedy made two
years ago, when he infuriated
many trustees by single-handedly
approving domestic partner bene
fits for students before the board
had examined the proposal.
"I understood that the board
had been very unhappy that they
found themselves placed in that
position," Casper said. "I under
stood that as background to the
issue."
To get a feel for the range of
opinions, Casper consulted with
faculty and staff, met with repre
sentatives of lesbian and gay orga
nizations, and raised the issue at
dinner parties with alumni.
The trustees eventually
extended domestic partner bene
fits to homosexual faculty and
staff, but decided it would be too
expensive to provide benefits for
heterosexual partners. The state
ment announcing the decision
quoted Barbara Butterfield, vice
president for faculty and staff ser
vices, but not Casper.
While some felt Casper should
have been more vocal during dis
cussion of the issue, Casper
defended his handling of it.
"On any subject, if I take a very
firm line you may believe you
have no chance to persuade me;
you may think my mind is closed
on that," he said. "I wanted every
body to have a chance to say
everything they had to say, pro
and con, on these very complex —
and, to many people, very emo
tional — issues."
Bradfute, who authored a bill
in the ASSU Senate two years ago
that urged the Faculty Senate to
address the domestic partners
issue, approved of Casper's
approach.
"The important thing is what
he did, and I think he did a great
job," Bradfute said. "I'm interest
ed in what the University does; I
don't care what his personal opin
ion is, frankly."
On multicultural issues,
Casper has also moved
carefully and deliberately,
taking care not to alienate any
one.
His stance has disappointed
those who had hoped — based on
his 25-year career at the more tra
ditional University of Chicago —
that he would be conservative on
multicultural issues. In speeches
at Chicago, Casper criticized "the
moralism associated with what is
called 'PC' " and called "peer
pressure" one of the greatest dan
gers to freedom at American uni
versities.
But Casper has gradually
moved toward positions similar to

Kennedy's, rebuffing attempts to
enlist him in the drive to rescind
Stanford's controversial speech
code, calling for the creation of a
diverse faculty, and deciding that
worries about political correct
ness are unfounded.
"There is no political correct
ness that I can discern," he said.
"There are simply some issues
that are very emotional and that
lead to a high degree of sensitivity
and nervousness, and sometimes
short tempers, when discussions
take place.
"Those discussions are not
easy to have. They are not easy for
Stanford — but they are no more
difficult for Stanford than they
are for any other place."
Speculation that Casper might
wish to revise the speech code —
which prohibits "fighting words"
based on gender, race or sexual
orientation — was spurred when
he at first refused to take a posi
tion on the issue. His office was
flooded with postcards opposing
the code in October and Novem
ber, part of a campaign coordinat
ed by the conservative Stanford
Review.
But at his first appearance
before the ASSU Senate Dec. 1,
the day the senators voted on
whether to support the code,
Casper came prepared.
Quoting from thick law books,
the nationally recognized consti
tutional law scholar gave a half
hour lecture that ran through 50
years of legal history, from the
Supreme Court's 1942 ruling in
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire to
a 1992 St. Paul, Minn., case that
reignited the free speech issue.
"I might have written (Stan
ford's code) a little differently but
it is a very small and subtle
point," Casper told the ASSU. "I
don't see the point to take the ini
tiative to overturn it."
The senators, who had been
expected to rescind their support
of the code, instead voted 15-5 to
retain it.
Discussing the speech code
now, Casper is caustic in rejecting
some students' attempts to keep
the debate alive. "The issue over
the speech code is a phony issue
— that's not a real issue," he said.
"That is not a matter of any great
importance."
While Casper's positions on
multicultural issues have so far
been similar to Kennedy's, the
way he reaches those positions is
quite different. Kennedy, head of
the Food and Drug Administra
tion under President Carter, was
an outspoken liberal Democrat
who identified easily with the
social goals of the multicultural
movement.
Casper, too, says he is pro
choice, pro-affirmative action and
registered as a Democrat. But in
analyzing individual issues, he is

fiercely non-partisan, cultivating
a centrism that leads him to care
fully consider suggestions that
might be anathema to those on
the left.
"Certainly I'm much more
politically conservative than my
predecessor," he told the German
newsmagazine Die Welt in an
October interview. "I have friends
on the left as well as on the right
and in the middle. Life is more
interesting that way."
Unlike Kennedy, who was
often confronted with
vocal student groups cam
paigning aggressively for a pro
gressive agenda, Casper has faced
relatively little demand to pursue
multicultural issues.
While he has called for a reex
amination of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report,
which sets out affirmative goals,
he has not been pressed into mul
ticultural battles in the same way
Kennedy was.
Instead, Casper has been free
to devote most of his time to less
public administrative tasks, such
as examining the Medical School's
relationship with two affiliated
hospitals or puzzling over compli
cated indirect-cost recovery rules.
But a demanding pace of meet
ings, luncheons, dormitory visits
and alumni gatherings have
taken their toll on the 54-year-old
Casper, who is still in the process
'We don't need
someone to galva
nize us, and we don't
need someone to
grab headlines.'

of familiarizing himself with
Stanford and its history.
His days are scheduled from 7
a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a
week. In an interview in his
office, Casper showed the wear of
his punishing schedule. Looking
disheveled, he complained that
he hardly has time to read his
mail — although he admits that
some of the abuse is "self-inflict
ed" because he is trying to reach
out.
Last week, he gave speeches at
alumni meetings in San Jose,
Redwood City and Los Angeles;
this week, he is in on a fund-rais
ing trip to Germany, where he
will also visit Stanford in Berlin.
For winter and spring quar
ters, he has scheduled 20 faculty
luncheons and dinners, visits to
eight dormitories, guided tours of
everything from El Centro Chi

cano to the Bechtel International
Center, and even a walking tour
of the Row with fraternity and
sorority members.
"Universities have to ask what
they want in their presidents,"
Casper said. "If they want a per
son who shows up in every corner
and gives speeches in every cor
ner, that is one model. But if they
want a president who worries
about the substance of the aca
demic enterprise then they have
to reduce their demands — the
two cannot be reconciled."
Casper complained that he has
had little time to address the
issues that he considers most
important to Stanford's future —
undergraduate and graduate edu
cation. In the last month, howev
er, he has begun urging reconsid
eration of the four-year degree as
a way to make people think about
curricular and cost issues.
Predicting that universities
will be in for a "rude awakening"
unless they fundamentally
rethink the way they do business,
Casper said at a San Francisco
conference earlier this month
that he may offer Stanford
undergraduates a clearly
designed three-year alternative to
the conventional four-year
degree.
Casper first voiced the idea of a
three-year degree a little more
than a year ago, "in a highly
informal, non-public setting"
while he was provost at the Uni
versity of Chicago. Admitting
that he was a bit taken aback by
the intensity of reaction to the
proposal, Casper believes it is
because he struck a chord.
"I understand much better
than before the tremendous
financial pressures on parents,"
he said. "I am clearly ready to see
whether we cannot develop a
more specific proposal."
Casper's willingness to ask dif
ficult questions and call for
unpopular solutions was one of
the reasons the trustees chose
him to lead Stanford through one
of the most difficult transitions in
its history. While Kennedy took
over a growing and vibrant insti
tution, Casper inherits one facing
uncertainty and reluctant
retrenchment.
It is an atmosphere in which
Kennedy's dynamism would be
out of place; instead, Casper's
hard, unsentimental warning
that universities face a potential
crisis — and his frank admission
that further budget cuts remain a
distinct possibility — have
become the rule.
"We don't need someone to
galvanize us, and we don't need
someone to grab headlines," said
History Prof. Barton Bernstein.
"We need somebody who will be
reasonable, intelligent and car
ing."

Casper shares a lighter moment with former University President Donald Kennedy during a meeting last
year. While Kennedy's often preferred to make blunt public pronouncements, Casper is described as
more reticent.
