# Perry disputes conflict-of-interest report

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's choice for deputy defense
secretary was questioned yesterday
over a report that he participated in
Pentagon budget discussions while he
was still on the boards of defense com
panies.
William Perry disputed the allega
tion at his confirmation hearing, and
members of the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee indicated it was
unlikely to impede his appointment.
Several members, including Chairman
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., had warm praise
for him.
Defense Daily reported earlier in the
day that Perry, a member of the board
of United Technologies Corp., and
other private companies, participated
in budget discussions prior to taking
office.
Perry, who also is a Stanford profes

sor, said he has worked at the Defense
Department as a special government
employee without compensation but
purposely avoided the deputy defense
secretary's office.
"One has to be careful in a position
like that to avoid any conflicts of inter
est, and I think I have been scrupulous
in doing that," Perry told the commit
tee.
Perry said he has received briefin
gs on the budget issues as the Pen
tagon works on a military blueprint
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,
but he has not participated in the
decisions.
"I have had to stay away from all
decision processes and serve only as an
adviser," he said.
Perry said that if he is confirmed,
he will resign from the company
boards on which he serves and sever

all financial ties.
"The implication that there might be
any financial benefit I could gain from
this is just absurd," he said.
Republicans and Democrats on the
panel generally praised the nomina
tion of Perry, who worked in the
Defense Department during the
Carter administration and was
described by Nunn as the "father of
stealth technology."
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said
Perry's response to the trade publica
tion's report "put to rest" any questions
although the lawmaker wondered about
the regulations on a non-confirmed
designee taking part in budget discus
sions.
"The bottom line is personal charac
ter and around this table, many will
vouch for your personal character,"
Warner said.
