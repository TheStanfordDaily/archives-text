Compromise between
ASSU, University best
solution for bank woes

THE UNIVERSITY is elimi
nating its $68,000 subsidy to
the ASSU bank next year, a
move that will slice nearly 25 per
cent from the student govern
ment's operating budget.
While many groups consider the
bank an inconvenience, the bank pro
vides a valuable service to students
and should be retained. The ASSU can
preserve the bank by increasing the
revenue of its business projects and
transferring some of the bank's book
keeping operations to an actual finan
cial institution.
At present, the bank manages
accounts for business projects like
Flicks, as well as for 325 registered
student organizations.
The University requires almost all
student groups — even those that
don't receive any money from the
ASSU — to use the bank, in order to
monitor the groups' activities.
But the bank also provides stu
dents a service, in that it lends sta
bility, accountability and a strong
credit rating to often unstable orga
nizations whose memberships are
always in flux.
While the bank has probably
saved the University money and
stabilized such student groups, it is
still expensive. The ASSU expects
to spend an estimated $138,000
this year on the bank — nearly 50
percent of the ASSU's operating
budget.
Because this system is so expen
sive, the University has traditional
ly helped provide a subsidy to pay
for the staff salaries and other
expenses associated with the bank.
But those days are gone, and
Tresidder and the ASSU now find
themselves arguing over how to
handle the University's cut.
Tresidder claims that by reduc
ing the paperwork within the bank

ing system and tightening its busi
ness practices, the ASSU can gener
ate enough additional revenue from
its underdeveloped business pro
jects to support the bank on its own.
The ASSU Financial Committee,
on the other hand, says that busi
ness-project income should not be
swallowed by the bank. The commit
tee is investigating whether some
bank operations can be transferred to
an outside financial institution.
A compromise between these
two positions is possible.
Tresidder should be given a chance
next year to prove its claim that it can
help the business projects collect
lOUs and raise more income, becom
ing more efficient overall. If, at the
end of the year, the projects have
made more money than they did this
year, the net gain should be assigned
to support the bank.
However, any profits the projects
would have made, had Tresidder
not intervened, should not be used
for this purpose. In effect, if the
University helps the ASSU make
more money, that money should be
funneled into the bank.
In addition, the University should
permit the 70 percent of groups that
do not receive student-fee money to
open separate accounts at a single
outside institution.
Currently, all student-organiza
tion money is stored as one lump
sum in a single Wells Fargo account.
By allowing groups to start their
own accounts, the ASSU would
transfer responsibility for recording
balances and reporting overdrafts to
the outside bank.
However, the outside bank could
issue checkbooks which would
require the signature of an ASSU
bank official, a precaution that
would preserve oversight by the
University.
Organizations which receive stu
dent-fee money should still be
required to stay with the student
bank system.
Hopefully, these two measures
will preserve the bank without bleed
ing the business projects to death,
while providing the University with
oversight, without a subsidy.
