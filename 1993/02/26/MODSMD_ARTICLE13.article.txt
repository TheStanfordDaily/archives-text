## Vincent Ho Ice-T visit marred by lack of communication, courtesy 
### 
AS A DAILY photographer, assign
ments come and go, but opportuni
ties come along more rarely. Shoot
ing Ice-T's speech in Kresge last Satur
day was an opportunity.
Having started shooting for The
Daily only last summer, I still consider
myself a relatively new photographer,
with a little more experience than some,
a lot less than others. So, I thought this
assignment would have been snatched
up long before I could even come close to
it. Unexpectedly, it was mine for the
taking.
Soon, I realized this assignment was
loaded with pressure, as well as opportu
nity — there would be no excuses, no file
pictures, no one else to count on if I
didn't come back with a usable photo.
Therein lies one of the greatest chal
lenges in photojournalism, and in photog
raphy in general — capturing the
moment.
When I pick up my camera, I'm look
ing to document an instant, to present a
story within the time it takes the shutter
to open and close — usually between one
thirtieth and one-four-thousandth of a
second.
This is something I enjoy tremendous
ly — having to be in the right place at the
right moment, "to get the shot." Photog
raphy allows me to portray life on film, to
catch those proverbial 1,000 words and
present them to others.
In my capacity as a photojournalism
it is my job to do just that — photos in
a newspaper are an illustration to
accompany and add to a story, or stand
on their own as stories in themselves.
To prepare to shoot in Kresge, I ran
through the mental checklist I had, in
order to put myself where I needed to be,
whatever situation arose.
Finally, Ice-T came on stage, and
suddenly I was only half listening to
what he was saying as I visualized the
picture I wanted. Several rolls of film
and a few hours later, I felt frustrated

because my being nervous interfered
with the way I normally work, and I was
not confident that I took the shot I want
ed so badly, the one that my editors could
look at and say, "Let's run this one big —
it's good."
After Ice-T left the podium, I hopped
behind the curtain, to see if I could snap
off a few shots. He was in a room just off
stage, and Nicole Sanchez, who was coor
dinating the event said, "That's enough.
I'm sorry."
No problem, I thought; I had been told
earlier that Ice-T was going to be at Roble
following his speech. A shot of Ice-T
informally interacting with students
would be great, I thought, because the
image was so unlike the ones we have
seen of him in the past.
Imagine my surprise at Roble when I
was bluntly told, "Roble residents
only," and that the press was barred. I
hadn't expected this. Knowing how
important this photo could have been —
this was a story I wanted to tell — I
called my editor to see what to do next.
I was already feeling uncomfortable
because of the mounting hostility
directed towards me, simply because I
had a camera in hand.
Coincidentally, my editor arrived just
after I paged him, and we tried to plan
out a course of action. A friend who lived
in Roble gave me his colored wristband
that served as II), but it failed to get me
inside. A resident assistant came out and
rudely asked, "Why do you think we lock
the doors here? To keep people we don't
want here out."
All of a sudden, I became some bad guy
coming in and making trouble. It was as
if I were transformed into a walking cam
era. To them I was the evil unblinking
eye of the press and not a human being,
let alone a fellow student. Abruptly, my
assignment had turned sour.
I never intended to cause a distur
bance; I was just trying to complete my
assignment, to do my job, not to tick peo

pie off.
With the information I had about the
reception, I had thought I would be able
to take photographs; after all, this was
an event that was partly subsidized
with my ASSU fees, and I was sure the
student body would be interested to
know as much about Ice-T's visit as pos
sible.
However, the student who denied my
entrance gave me no explanation as to
why I could not come in, except that I was
not a Roble resident.
Whether or not the RA was just try
ing to get rid of me, I was not getting
the information I needed, and obvious
ly there was a lack of communication
between the people who were supposed
to take care of security. A University
spokesperson was quoted in last Satur
day's San Francisco Chronicle as say
ing that the organizers were inexperi
enced in dealing with the media, and
unfortunately, this seemed to be the
case.
In circumstances where a photogra
pher can shoot, it is his responsibility as
a photojournalist and a human being to
determine whether or not to depress the
shutter release; I strongly believe that
there are certain situations that should
not be documented on film, because to
do so would be inappropriate and/or an
invasion of privacy. The camera doesn't
make this choice; the person holding it
does.
Far away from Stanford, in Somalia
or Bosnia or other turbulent areas, for
example, judgments like this must be
made at a moment's notice. But here,
we're not dealing with a war zone, and
thus the question is not as complex: is
taking photos at an informal discussion
between Ice-T and Stanford students
newsworthy, and if so, is it an invasion of
privacy to do so?
The bottom line is this: this RA, and a
few other students, had managed to take
all the fun out of a job which I considered

to be a joy first and foremost. I didn't
shoot a single frame in Roble; I was too
disgusted by the complete lack of cour
tesy and communication.
I think conflict could have easily
been avoided, or at least reconciled — in
fact, in hopes of soothing the situation,
I asked a friend to pass along a note
explaining my perspective to the RA,
but I have not yet received a reply or
acknowledgment.
Frankly, I'm disappointed; Ice-T's
visit was a newsworthy event, and I
think the Stanford community has a
right to know all about it, especially
since they paid for it. In the end, I think
that from an organizational standpoint,
the way the media coverage was han
dled was poor, which prevented the true
and complete story from being docu
mented.
If I had the chance to do it over again,
I'd still take this assignment in an
instant — it was a good experience, and
I'm thankful for it. My only regret is that
it ended in frustration, which leaves me
thinking this opportunity could have
been so much more.
