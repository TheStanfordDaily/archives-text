## Add a little evil to your life 
### 
EVERY ONCE IN A while some old
fogey from Elorida will write to
Dear Abby, Ann Landers, Miss
Manners or the Kinsey Report and ask
for the reprint of some letter containing
the words, "Perform random acts of
kindness." The advice writer will go off
on how nice and Judeo-Christian it is to
do this. The next week, letters will pour
in about how some wonderful man paid
the bridge tolls for 20 cars, and how that
considerate Mrs. Anderson wrote an
anonymous note to poor, pregnant, teen
aged Linda I lines that saved her from the
abortion-clinic profit-hounds.
These random acts of kindness are
supposed to make everything rosy again.
Despite the ethnic cleansing in Eastern
Europe, growing urban strife, increased
risk of nuclear proliferation and a host of
other problems, just because the Dallas
Cowboys won the Super Bowl and the
Claw is spouting water again (did anyone
else forget what an unappealing fountain
it is?) everything is hunky-dory.
Since the businessman driving the
Lexus 10 cars ahead paid our toll, are we
expected to believe that funny Saddam
Hussein couldn't possibly be thinking of
making more mustard gas? And why on
earth would he want to make any of those
nasty nuclear weapons (especially when
he could probably just pay the Ukraini
ans for some . . .)? That businessman
probably got the money to pay for your

toll by selling Saddam pipes and manu
facturing equipment to make his "pesti
cides" (that is if you count Kurds among
pests).
All these acts of kindness do is
increase our expectations and raise our
opinion of human nature. Maybe those of
you out there who whistle "Under the
Sea" from"The Little Mermaid" while
riding your bikes don't think raising our
opinion of human nature is such a bad
thing, but I tend to prefer the Erench
Chefs song about hacking little fishies to
bits. Advice writers should prescribe the
exact opposite of "random acts of kind
ness" — "premeditated acts of evil."
This does not mean everyone should
go out and join the Shining Path terrorist
group, but instead we should perform
small acts of evil and hatred that are
meticulously orchestrated. Do not follow
the example of Wayne Lo, who, while
wearing his favorite T-shirt bearing the
slogan "sick of it all," gunned down a
bunch of people in Massachusetts. But
imagine yourself as a benign Chucky doll,
not meaning to pogo stick anyone to
death (or was that the Leprechaun?), but
just out to cause some mischief. Perhaps
a better role model is the gopher in Cad
dyshack — even though he dances like
Bill Cosby (yeck) — he causes plenty of
harmless trouble (the blowing-up of the
golf course is entirely Bill Murray's
fault).

So, the next time that oh-so-cool per
son whizzes by you on his or her bike,
hands shoved suavely in pockets, ride like
mad to catch up; then, right before a set
of bollards, cut discreetly in front, as if
you just hadn't noticed the person. If
you're good, he'll get a trip to the hospital
for his troubles. Try poking pin holes into
the tires of various bikes too.
It's easy to think of small acts of evil
that could remind everyone that maybe,
just maybe, the person sitting in the third
row, third seat is off-kilter enough to one
day freak-out and come after them with a
heavy "History of the Jewish Peoples"
text. Rather than grow shiny and happy,
we'll become paranoid and suspicious
(trust me, it's fun).
To make your acts of evil most effec
tive, avoid committing these acts against
anyone who is already embittered and
cynical. Try to pick out those people who
smile all the time and who pat you on the
back for no apparent reason. Irritate
them, maim them, annoy them, but leave
enough left over so they can appreciate
the evil in all of us.

that damn rock 'n' roll.
