P
ASSION. REAL PASSION
The kind of passion that makes people
who work at Polo nervous. The kind of
passion that left Captain Stubing no
choice but to leave Charo behind in Puer
to Vallarta. The kind of passion that made
women stand behind John Kennedy in
1960. Well, maybe that was something
else, but it was still kind of cool.
Anyway, that kind of passion is dead,
and nowadays arch-conservatives like the
Review's Lisa Koven (or is it Kaven) work
for a democratic senator in high school
just to boost their resume. And what has
usurped passion and claimed its name
has about as much relation to that word
as Starship did to Jefferson Airplane.
True passion has gone the way of the
heliocentric model and the successful
Eddie Murphy movie. Even the word pas
sion is rarely used in common parlance
(much like the word "parlance"), and
when it is, it's only in combination with
words like "play, "fruit," "fish" and
"ate." Which leads one to wonder if only

lesbians are passionate anymore. But
somehow their shoes make that hard to
believe.
Any society that can build not only
Biosphere I, but Biosphere 11, has abso
lutely no chance of ever knowing passion.
Sure, Biospherians are allowed to have
sex, but if given stupid outfits and left in
a giant bubble watched over by a crazed
millionaire, who would want to? Unless,
of course, the crazed millionaire happens
to be Hugh Hefner.
All this passion business came to a boil
Wednesday, as Catholics — the last ves
tiges of passion, mass-psychosis and idol
worship — entered their annual 40-day
passion-fast, known, oddly enough, as
Lent. (As if they could just rent out color
ful sins to WASP friends: "Honestly,
Thurston, it would be immoral for you to
even think about using a condom before
Easter.")
But, this year, Lent might just be set
ting in as a permanent way of life, a
frightening thought for not only produc
ers of those bad sugar-free candies, but
those little guys who eavesdrop in Church
closets. Because by the time July rolls
around, and David Letterman's move to

CBS puts an end to that string of late
night, virtual-passion, pseudo-detective
shows with scantily clad twentysome
things ("CrimeTime — after primetime")
— passion will no longer be an American
tradition, not even for Catholics.
With the closing of the American fron
tier and its promise of manly, papish
domination, a decent coon-skin hat
became harder and harder to come by. As
for passion, as well as good Vietnamese
food, the only place left to turn is the
inner-cities.
So when the inner cities' own Ice-T
came to Dinkelspiel on Saturday, it made
sense that everyone was frisked at the
door. Even though when Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia spoke at Dinkel
spiel, people were allowed to waltz in and
out. Assassinating a conservative Italian
justice, it turns out, is calculated protest.
Killing a misogynistic black man without
rhythm, who spells his own name wrong
— now that's a little too close to passion
for the University's taste.
No, it's not the inner-cities, but previ
ously good-natured Canada where it
seems passion has taken a long, Vietnam
esque getaway. Why, it was just Wednes

day when angry Frenchmen teamed up
with angry non-French women who, fed
up with passionless leaders, chose to toss
out Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Wait a second, Canadians give up bad
leadership for Lent, while mealy-mouth
American Catholics decide to stop saying
the word "like" so much? Next thing you
know, they'll win a World Series.
Passion has been equated with disease
in America, with fancy names like
"workaholic," "nymphomania" and
"Sajakophile." After all, there's no room
for passion in a country where invest
ment-banking jobs pay so damn much
and teaching pays so little (Hey, everyone
else is saying it .. . Mr. Sachs: "Why are
you interested in investment banking,
Peter?" Peter: "I've wanted to be an I-
Banker since I was six. I don't care one
bit about the money. I'll do it for scraps of
raw meat." Mr. Sachs: "Get the hell out
of my office, Peter.")
The search for lost passion has already
taken on a retro kind of hepness, and the
only places to look are television, Clinton
age politics and Julia Roberts' top lip.
Passion without effort — it's beautiful in
a kind of '90s, Sega-Genesis kind of way.

But maybe we're better off without
passion. Maybe it's better if those
Frenchmen stay in Canada where they
can stir up as much trouble as they want.
After all, where has passion gotten
France besides a week-long, country-wide
postal service strike.
Passionate postal workers? Canadians
plotting revolution? Seems like Lent
might not ever end after all, Virginia, so
keep those sugar-free candies on the cof
fee table and slip in another episode of "I,
Claudius." It looks like it's going to be a
long winter after all, despite what Bill
Murray says.
