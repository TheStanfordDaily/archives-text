## Home streak reaches 30 as women down Huskies 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
With excellent free-throw
shooting and dominating front
line play by Val Whiting and
Rachel Hemmer, the Cardinal
women's basketball team crushed
the visiting Washington Huskies,
86-62, before a crowd of 4,623 at
Maples Pavilion last night.
No. 10 Stanford (20-5, 10-3
Pacific 10 Conference) extended
its homecourt winning streak to
30 games, currently the fourth
longest home winning streak in
NCAA women's basketball.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
impressed with the team's open
court energy and defense. "I real
ly feel that our team played the
kind of game we want to be play
ing," VanDerveer said. "We were
playing up-tempo, we were more
aggressive defensively, and it
looked like people had their legs
back. I was concerned about that
after taking the trips (to Con
necticut and UCLA) that we
took."
The Cardinal played swarming
defense throughout the contest,
forcing 19 turnovers and holding
Husky senior guard Laura Moore
to seven points on 2-for-8 shoot
ing.
"Defensively, I thought Christy
IHedgpethJ especially did a really
good job on Laura Moore; she
burned us badly last time," Van-
Derveer said.
Two years ago, Moore's
buzzer-beating 19-foot jumper
shocked the Cardinal for its only
defeat in its last 72 home games.
"Washington is the type of
team that can give you trouble
because they're very athletic,
defensive-oriented, very aggres
sive, and this is an excellent win
for us," VanDerveer said. "This is
a tough team to play against.
They can make you look ugly."
The Huskies (13-10, 8-6) did
exactly that on Jan. 30 in Seattle,
although they got help from the
Cardinal, who made only 54 per
cent of its free-throw attempts in
a 73-70 loss.
However, on Thursday night,

Whiting and Goodenbour com
bined for a 13-for-13 mark from
the charity stripe, contributing to
a red-hot 89 percent team free
throw performance, the second
highest single-game output by a
Pac-10 team this season.
The Huskies tried to shut
down Stanford's offensive attack
with an aggressive defense, but
gambled while defending the low
post, leading to numerous layup
opportunities for the Cardinal.
The shorter Washington front
line was unable to contend with
the height and post experience of
Stanford's front-line players.
The Cardinal dominated the
boards, with sophomore forward
Rachel Hemmer contributing a
career-high 16 rebounds.
On offense, Player of the Year
candidate Val Whiting led the
Cardinal in scoring with 25
points on 10-for-17 field goal
shooting. The senior center led all
scorers with 16 points at the half.
Senior point guard Molly Good
enbour broke out of a recent scor
ing slump by tallying 19 points on
5-for-8 shooting from the field.
"The four years I've been here,
Washington has played the same
defense, and usually we try to lob
passes in from the high post,"
Whiting said.
VanDerveer added, "Once Val
got the ball, it was just her and
the basket."
Hemmer believes the team is
pointed in the right direction
after last night's win. "Last year,
I think we were successful
because we were able to relax and
just play the game, and I think
that's what we're able to do now,"
she said.
