# Ribbons and rubberware help promote AIDS events
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Red ribbons and lots of rubberware will shower the
campus as Stanford's first AIDS Awareness Week
kicks off Monday.
Designed to promote awareness and prevention of
the disease as well as activism among members of the
Stanford community, the week will feature events
ranging from a commemorative candlelight march to
a safer sex dance.
"There's a lot of ignorance about AIDS and HIV,"
said Thane Kreiner, co-founder of the Stanford AIDS
Awareness Coalition, which is coordinating the
week's events. Many people think they are not at risk
"because they're straight... or because they're with
people that are highly educated."
Kreiner added that the disease will eventually af
fect everyone one way or another.
In order to educate more people about the disease,
organizers have scheduled basic information sessions
called "AIDS 101," and lectures addressing specific po
litical, legal, medical and financial aspects of the dis
ease.
AIDS Awareness Week begins Monday evening
with a candlelight march through campus, to be fol
lowed by a speech by Cleve Jones, founder of the
NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, which honors
victims of the disease.
The week will include a presentation by the
Women's Performance Collective, a Safer Sex Dance
and casino night — with condoms as gambling chips
and the creation of a Stanford Quilt Panel which will
be displayed in White Plaza and eventually sent to the
NAMES Project.
Red ribbons will be available for a $2 donation in
White Plaza throughout the week for individuals
who want to show support for people with AIDS and
HIV. A condom-counting contest, in which students
pay $1 to guess how many condoms are in ajar, will
also be held.
But if safe sex paraphernalia and red ribbons don't
catch some people's attention, students playing dead
in the middle of White Plaza probably will; the "Die-
In" is scheduled for Thursday at
noon.
"They're not going to be able to
ignore having to swerve their
bike," said Jill McDonough, man
ager of Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
Having bodies strewn across
White Plaza will be a "very visible
way" to show that AIDS deaths

are not just a matter statistics,
but "real people that are dying
from the disease," Kreiner said.
The week will end with an
AIDS/HIV prevention conference
for Bay Area college students,
coordinated by the Health Promo
tion Program at Cowell Student
Health Center.
While many AIDS outreach
efforts are geared toward preven
tion, the week will also address
how to live with HIV and encour
age infected individuals not to

"just give up because they're
[already] infected," said Hsien-
Hsien Lei, fund-raising chair.
Lei emphasized that the spread
of AIDS "can be stopped by
behavior modification. [People]
have control over this."
Lei said the week's proceeds,
estimated at about $300-$5OO,
will be donated to two local AIDS
foundations — the AIDS Project
in Santa Clara County and the
ELLIPSE Peninsula AIDS Ser
vices in San Mateo County.
