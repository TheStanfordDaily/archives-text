# Cardinal turns up the heat
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
For the first time in a while, Stanford showed
some championship flair last night.
The Cardinal injected some much-needed inten
sity into its play, hustling to loose balls that in
recent games it might not have corralled, executing
its offense with more poise than it has of late and
hinting that a push toward the playoffs may be
underway.
"It's getting close to tournament time," said
sophomore forward Rachel Hemmer after the
game. "Everyone wants to step up their play."
Coach Tara VanDerveer added, "This is the
Stanford team I think we're used to watching. I saw
people getting up for rebounds, people playing real
ly hard and people playing together."
Controlling the glass by almost a two-to-one
margin, Stanford turned Washington misses into
fast-break opportunities, treating the Maples fans
to a faster pace of basketball than they've seen in
most games this year.
Many of the chances to run were fueled by outlet
passes from Hemmer, whose hard work on the
boards, in turn, enabled point guard Molly Gooden
bour to push the ball up the floor.
"Molly kept the tempo going," Hemmer said.
"When I get her quicker outlets, she's able to do a
lot more with the ball."
Stanford also executed its half-court offense well
last night, as VanDerveer's game plan proved the
perfect antidote for the Huskies' overplay defense.
"We ran kind of a 'clear' offense to get the ball in
to Val (Whiting)," VanDerveer explained. "The
main object was to spread out and drive on them."
She gave both Goodenbour and Christy Hedgpeth
credit for dribbling by their defenders, as well as for
their entry passes in to the post players.
Washington center Rhonda Smith blamed her
self and her teammates for not producing a com
plete defensive effort.
"Our defense is one that if you don't play it all
the way . . . you get schooled."
Looking to the future, Goodenbour warned that
the same plan of attack will not work against every
team.
"Washington State will be different, because
they play a different kind of defense," she said of
the Cardinal's opponent tomorrow. "We'll be
depending a lot more on our set shots."
A critical part of Stanford's shooting success last
night, though, was its ability to get layups and
other shots from close range.
Earning those easier shots, the Cardinal man
aged to make more than 50 percent of its field-goal
attempts — only the seventh time this season it has
reached that plateau.
