# Women's gymnastics to face 'terrible twosome' in Tucson
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
To unseat the best, you gotta beat the
best. And the No. 19 Stanford women's
gymnastics team is gonna meet the best
in Tucson this weekend.
The Cardinal (5-3 overall) heads to
the Arizona desert for a three-way
showdown tonight with the the No. 4
Oregon State Beavers and the No. 5
Arizona Wildcats. But Stanford is
unfazed by competing in such illustri
ous company.
According to sophomore Jenny Ward,
the tough opposition "shouldn't put any
more pressure on us."
Coach Breck Greenwood added, "One
meet is pretty much the same as another
to me."
In gymnastics, Vince Lombardi's

credo — "Winning isn't everything, it's
the only thing" — doesn't Count for
much. Winning is nice, but one gymnast
doesn't really compete against another.
Judges determine who the winners and
losers are, so the athlete has to focus on
her own routine.
"As much as it sounds like a real
cliche, doing the best we can do is all we
can do," Greenwood said.
Preparation is centered not on beat
ing an opponent, but on constantly
improving and peaking at the end of the
year, when winning does matter.
"Theoretically, if you win one meet a
year, you could be the national champi
ons," Greenwood said.
Despite Greenwood's laid-back
approach, if the team is to achieve its
goal of competing in the "Super Six" at
the NCAA Championships, it will have

a real cliche, doing the
best we can do is all we
can do.'

to perform at the same level as squads
like Arizona (10-3) and Oregon State
(9-3).
Stanford faced the Beavers early this
season in Maples Pavilion but wasn't up
to the challenge, losing 191.00-188.15.
The Cardinal has improved, however,
and is looking forward to comparing its
late-season form to that of the Bears and
Wildcats.

"Everyone is really excited, especially
after doing so well last week (against
Washington and Seattle Pacific)," said
sophomore Jene Elzie.
The Cardinal will be without a
healthy Elzie for a fourth straight meet.
The injured All-American is still nurs
ing a strained Achilles tendon, and
although her condition is improving,
she will only perform on the uneven
bars tonight.
But Stanford is not the only team
with injury problems.
Oregon State's world-class gymnast,
Chari Knight, is out for the rest of the
season with a knee injury. The junior
ranked fourth in the NCAA all-around
with an average score of 39.14.
In comparison, Elzie holds Stanford's
single-meet record in the all-around with
a score of 38.975.

Since Knight's injury, Oregon State's
performance has been, in Greenwood's
words, "interesting," as they have
scored as low as 189.00 and as high as
194.05.
Arizona has been every bit as good as
Oregon State this year, averaging 192.30
as a team. Kristi Gunning (39.10 season
high), Stacy Fowlkes (39.00) and Darci
Wambsgans (39.00) are the Wildcats' top
all-arounders.
Unlike Oregon State, coach Jim
Gault's Wildcats have been very consis
tent this year, scoring at least 191.00 in
every competition.
Ward said tonight's meet will serve as
a yardstick for the Cardinal squad's pro
gression.
"It will show us where we're at," she
said.
And to where they must go.
