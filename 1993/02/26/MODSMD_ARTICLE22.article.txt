# Men let one get away as Washington earns Stanford split, 56-51
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE— It's back to the Dawg
house for the Stanford men's basketball
team. After breaking a 10-game losing
string last Saturday, the Cardinal
returned to its old patterns last night,
when the Washington Huskies tossed
Stanford a bone only to snatch it away
and send the visitors retreating to their
little red house, 56-51, in front of a quiet
2,577 at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
Stanford (7-18, 2-11 Pacific 10 Con
ference) had a solid shooting night and
enjoyed a 50-48 advantage with just
over three minutes to play, but failed to
convert on its final possessions and seal
a victory. Instead, the Cardinal was
outscored 8-1 down the stretch and left
the arena tasting defeat yet again.
"We didn't get the ball in the right
people's hands at the end," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "We
should have tried to take a timeout with
1:30 left and set up a better shot. That
was an error on my part."
At that point, with Stanford trailing
by two, Bart Lammersen attempted a
difficult turnaround shot from the right
baseline. Darren Allaway was fortunate
to grab one of a mere five Stanford
offensive rebounds on the miss, and was
fouled on the putback. Allaway made
only the second of his two free throws,
which ended up being the Cardinal's
final point of the evening.
Stanford then had to resort to foul
ing. Guard Marcus Lollie tagged the
Huskies' Prentiss Perkins, a 57 percent
free-throw shooter, and Perkins was
true to his numbers, making only the
first of two. But as was the case through

out the game, the Cardinal failed to
secure the rebound. Washington's Mar
tin Keane came up with the board and,
after being fouled by Jim Morgan, made
just the second of his two at the charity
stripe, forcing Stanford to try for a
three-pointer on its final possession.
Alas, analogous to the first game
against Washington at Maples Pavilion
in January, Stanford made a costly
error when it counted. Forward Brent
Williams misread the path run by guard
Peter Dukes and passed the ball out of
bounds with 12 seconds remaining,
putting the choke chain on the Cardi
nal's hopes.
"It was a miscommunication," Mont
gomery said. "Pete broke one way and
Brent anticipated him going the other.
That's kind of the way things have gone
for us this year. The same thing hap
pened at our place. We had opportuni
ties to win but didn't get a good shot."
In the first half, Stanford had sever
al. The Cardinal hit 45.8 percent of its
shots in the opening period, and shot
44.7 percent for the game. Dukes
showed that his long-absent shooting
touch, which resurfaced in the USC
game, has perhaps returned for good.
The senior guard scored 14 points on 5-
for-8 shooting from the field in his final
outing in his hometown of Seattle. He
also saw significant time at point guard
as Marcus Lollie required rest for his
bruised shoulder.
"Obviously I had extra motivation
because this is my home and I was play
ing in front of my friends and family for
the last time," Dukes said. "It put a little
extra adrenaline in my legs. Plus, the
guy who happened to be guarding me
(Bryant Boston) was talking a little mess

and he didn't deserve to be doing that."
Washington (13-10, 7-7) led by two at
the half, and could have put the game
away following the break. Stanford
picked up two fouls in the initial 21 sec
onds of the second half. Following a pair
of successful free throws by Washington
forward Chandler Nairn and a 14-foot
baseline shot by center Rich Manning,
Montgomery became vocally upset,
prompting official Bob Garibaldi to slap
the Stanford coach with a technical foul.
The Cardinal went on to commit an addi
tional two fouls following the technical,
bringing the hack total to four team fouls
in three minutes. However, the Huskies
managed just six points before the Cardi
nal scored and began its comeback.

ference) had a solid shooting night and
enjoyed a 50-48 advantage with just
over three minutes to play, but failed to
convert on its final possessions and seal
a victory. Instead, the Cardinal was
outscored 8-1 down the stretch and left
the arena tasting defeat yet again.
"We didn't get the ball in the right
people's hands at the end," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "We
should have tried to take a timeout with
1:30 left and set up a better shot. That
was an error on my part."
At that point, with Stanford trailing
by two, Bart Lammersen attempted a
difficult turnaround shot from the right
baseline. Darren Allaway was fortunate
to grab one of a mere five Stanford
offensive rebounds on the miss, and was
fouled on the putback. Allaway made
only the second of his two free throws,
which ended up being the Cardinal's
final point of the evening.
Stanford then had to resort to foul
ing. Guard Marcus Lollie tagged the
Huskies' Prentiss Perkins, a 57 percent
free-throw shooter, and Perkins was
true to his numbers, making only the
first of two. But as was the case through

out the game, the Cardinal failed to
secure the rebound. Washington's Mar
tin Keane came up with the board and,
after being fouled by Jim Morgan, made
just the second of his two at the charity
stripe, forcing Stanford to try for a
three-pointer on its final possession.
Alas, analogous to the first game
against Washington at Maples Pavilion
in January, Stanford made a costly
error when it counted. Forward Brent
Williams misread the path run by guard
Peter Dukes and passed the ball out of
bounds with 12 seconds remaining,
putting the choke chain on the Cardi
nal's hopes.
"It was a miscommunication," Mont
gomery said. "Pete broke one way and
Brent anticipated him going the other.
That's kind of the way things have gone
for us this year. The same thing hap
pened at our place. We had opportuni
ties to win but didn't get a good shot."
In the first half, Stanford had sever
al. The Cardinal hit 45.8 percent of its
shots in the opening period, and shot
44.7 percent for the game. Dukes
showed that his long-absent shooting
touch, which resurfaced in the USC
game, has perhaps returned for good.
The senior guard scored 14 points on 5-
for-8 shooting from the field in his final
outing in his hometown of Seattle. He
also saw significant time at point guard
as Marcus Lollie required rest for his
bruised shoulder.
"Obviously I had extra motivation
because this is my home and I was play
ing in front of my friends and family for
the last time," Dukes said. "It put a little
extra adrenaline in my legs. Plus, the
guy who happened to be guarding me
(Bryant Boston) was talking a little mess

and he didn't deserve to be doing that."
Washington (13-10, 7-7) led by two at
the half, and could have put the game
away following the break. Stanford
picked up two fouls in the initial 21 sec
onds of the second half. Following a pair
of successful free throws by Washington
forward Chandler Nairn and a 14-foot
baseline shot by center Rich Manning,
Montgomery became vocally upset,
prompting official Bob Garibaldi to slap
the Stanford coach with a technical foul.
The Cardinal went on to commit an addi
tional two fouls following the technical,
bringing the hack total to four team fouls
in three minutes. However, the Huskies
managed just six points before the Cardi
nal scored and began its comeback.

In Seattle last night.
SEATTLE— It's back to the Dawg
house for the Stanford men's basketball
team. After breaking a 10-game losing
string last Saturday, the Cardinal
returned to its old patterns last night,
when the Washington Huskies tossed
Stanford a bone only to snatch it away
and send the visitors retreating to their
little red house, 56-51, in front of a quiet
2,577 at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
Stanford (7-18, 2-11 Pacific 10 Con
ference) had a solid shooting night and
enjoyed a 50-48 advantage with just
over three minutes to play, but failed to
