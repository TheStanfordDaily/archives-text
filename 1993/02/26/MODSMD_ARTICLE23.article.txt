# Underdog Hillman plays tall
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
It's a familiar sight for Stanford
men's volleyball fans: the opposing team
is making a run, keying on resident
superstar Dave Goss and holding down
his offensive production. Prospects look
dimmer still as the pass to Canyon
Ceman is off the mark, and the resultant
set is more of a prayer than a play.
Then, from the side, up jumps the short
guy with the earrings, only to be greeted
by two opposing blockers. Yet the resul
tant spike is high, off the blocker's finger
tips and goes shooting out of bounds.
Side out, Cardinal.
Rather than being remembered for
his stature or jeweliy, senior Bob Hill
man has left Stanford fans breathless for
the last four years with his ability to turn
a broken play into a Cardinal point.
"Bob's strongest skill is hitting in
adversity," said teammate and fellow
swing hitter Ryan Moos.
"It's remarkable how effective a hitter
he is against a two-man block," coach
Ruben Nieves added. "He's right up
there with anyone in the country in get
ting a kill against a two-man block."
It's even more remarkable consider
ing Hillman's size. Standing at an even
six-foot (a generous media-guide esti
mate), he is the shortest member of the
Cardinal squad and sometimes the short
est player on the floor. But he has man
aged to turn this apparent liability into
an asset.
"I've always been kind of an underdog,"
Hillman said. "I like it. You don't have
that many expectations on you. The better
you do, the more surprised people are."
Then again, Hillman is no weakling.
His bulky frame is evidence of his time
under the weights.
"He is a very hard worker in the
weight room, which has helped him
make up for a lack of size," Nieves said.
"It has helped his collegiate career
tremendously."
Being a swing hittor, Hillman's pri
mary responsibility is the pass. Without
a pinpoint pass to the setter, spikes
become predictable and defendable.

"If I don't pass well, we can't get our
offense going," he said. "We will lose if
the passing is not good."
Usually, Hillman is a very accurate
passer. But being a self-admitted
"streaky" player, Hillman goes through
inexplicable stretches in which none of his
passes go where they should. This incon
sistency puts pressure on every return.
"I am under a tremendous amount of
pressure," Hillman said. "Passing is the
bane of my existence."
Hitting is a different story. "Hitting is
the most fun thing in the game," he said.
"I feel like if I just hit it high and hard,
I'll get a kill.
"There is more abandon involved in
hitting because it's not such a pin point
thing like passing. You have a lot of lee
way just to let yourself go."
Hillman approaches serving with the
same recklessness. He started jump-serv
ing just three weeks ago, yet he is third in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
with a 0.7 aces-per-game average.
"I have two different mindsets when
it comes to serving," Hillman described.
"One is hit the hell out of it and the other
is hit to a certain spot."
Even with this aggressive attitude,
Hillman is usually pretty stoic on the
court. In one notable exception, after a
particularly objectionable call by a referee
in the Cal State-Northridge match last
week, Hillman bellowed in pain and made
an abortive attempt to rip the net down,
for which he was rewarded a yellow card.
"I'm pretty much in control on the
court,"he said. "I was really pissed at

this call, so I said to myself 'I'm going to
get a yellow card right now.' It's fun to be
theatrical every once in a while."
A flair for the dramatic is notably
absent from this Cardinal team's court
demeanor. Games are approached and
played with a professionalism modeled
after its unflamboyant head coach, a
quality that garners respect from refer
ees and opposing teams. While this atti
tude is usually beneficial, Hillman feels a
little emotion might not be a such a
hideous thing.
"I'm sure Ruben would be the first to
admit that he is not the most emotional
ly spirited guy," he said. "We definitely
don't have some who yells and screams.
While that's fine, you don't really need
someone like that, every once in a while I
bet it would really bolster our game."
Hillman's personality is hard to stereo
type. His teammates speak somewhat
ambiguously of him being "unique," and
in Moos' words, "kind of wacky."
Nieves also hits upon Hillman's
uniqueness, but struggles with further
characterization, "I think Bob lives his
life the way he wants to ... I wish I could
tell you a little more about his personali
ty, because I think he's really unique, but
I don't know how to describe it."
If anyone, the "short guy with ear
rings" might have the best perspective
on Bob Hillman's mystique:
"The fact is, I have earrings and I'm a
little bit different from everyone. It's
good to be different, but my goal is not to
be different from the volleyball team. It's
not that big a deal."

As the shortest member of the Stanford men's volleyball team, Bob Hillman looks to
himself for the inspiration to play above his newly-shaven head.
