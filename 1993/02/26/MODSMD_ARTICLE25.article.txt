The Cardinal equestrian team will host USC, UC-Davis, Fres
no State and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in a show Sunday at 9 a.m.
at the Stanford Barn. The event will take place, rain or shine, in
an enclosed arena.
With two meets left in the regular season, the Cardinal finds
itself narrowly ahead of Fresno State for the points lead in the
Western Region. Should Stanford stay ahead of the Bulldogs
through this weekend and an upcoming show at USC, the Cardi
nal will get an automatic berth in the national championships, to
take place in Ohio in May.
