# Batters open Six-Pac with No. 5 Wildcats
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Welcome to the big time, boys.
The No. 10 Cardinal baseball
squad (10-3) opens up Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
(Six-Pac) play today, travelling to
Tucson, to face Arizona in a three
game set.
The Wildcats, Six-Pac champs
last year, were ranked as high as
No. 2 in some preseason polls.
"Obviously, this is a big series
for us," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "It's important
because they're Arizona, and it's
important because it's our [Six-
Pac] opener."
Arizona, 8-5 and No. 5 in the
latest Baseball America poll, has
been a bit of a disappointment in
the early season, losing two of
three to Southern California last
weekend.
The Wildcats' problems can be
traced to debilitating injuries
affecting their pitching staff.
Thus far, Arizona moundsmen

have compiled a less-than-stellar
5.46 earned run average. Stan
ford, by comparison, has a 3.25
team mark.
Arizona's much-heralded lefty
righty pitching combination of
juniors Tim Schwietzer and Mike
Schiefelbein has been sidelined
for almost the entire season.
Schwietzer, who underwent
arthroscopic surgery in December
on his throwing shoulder, pitched
for the first time against Cal
State-Dominguez Hills Tuesday.
Schiefelbein has missed his last
three starts because of a strained
muscle in his throwing shoulder.
Both are due to return to
action against Stanford.
"They've been affected by the
injuries to their top two guys,"
Marquess said. "Arizona's pitch
ing hasn't been their strong
point."
But while Wildcat hurlers have
struggled through the team's first
13 games, the Arizona offense has
more than picked up the slack.
As a team, the Wildcats are bat
ting .357 and averaging almost 10
runs per game, impressive even
for a baseball program known for
its offensive clout. Arizona led the
Six-Pac last year with a .312 mark.
Stanford nemesis Willie
Morales continues to pace the Ari
zona attack. Morales, an Ail-
American catcher, is a career .439
hitter against the Cardinal. This
season, the junior has been on
base over 50 percent of the time,
scoring 21 runs in Arizona's 13
games.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's own pitchers are not up to
the Arizona challenge. The Cardi
nal trifecta of Willie Adams,
Andrew Lorraine and Dan Reed
has lost only once in 1993, and
Adams tossed a complete game in a
15-3 victory over Arizona last year.
But Adams' performance is one
of the few bright spots for the
Cardinal against the Wildcats in
the last two years. Last season,
Arizona took four of six games
from Stanford, including its first
series victory at Sunken Diamond
since 1983. In 1991, the Cardinal
raced to an early 10-0 lead at
Frank Sancet Field, only to lose
21-11.
