# Swimmers should leave Pac-10 behind

Lack of confidence is not a problem for the
second-ranked Stanford women's swim team.
"There will be a pretty good battle for sec
ond place this year," said Cardinal coach
Richard Quick of this weekend's Pacific 10
Championships. "UCLA, Arizona and Cal will
battle it out, and USC also has an outside
chance. But we will win the meet."
The competition, which will be hosted by
UCLA at the Belmont Plaza facilities in Long
Beach, serves as a final preparation for the
NCAA Championships. During the three-day
event, stretching from Sunday to Tuesday,
the Cardinal will try to qualify eight more
swimmers for the NCAAs in order to complete
its roster of 17 swimmers and one diver for
the NCAA meet.
"We have about eight girls who are going all
out to qualify for the NCAAs," Quick said. That
means they have cut down on distance training
and are concentrating on speed work to help
them produce NCAA qualifying standards.
"At the Pac-lOs, I want them to be aggres

sive and not leave anything in the tank once
they're finished," Quick said. "I want them to
commit themselves to real good, fast swim
ming. If they do that, then I think most of
them will qualify."
Co-captain Anne Mahoney, Tammy Shan
non, Maureen McClaren and Mary Edwards
will aim for NCAA qualifying marks in the 100
and 200-yard backstroke. Pam Minthorn will
race in the 200 butterfly while Katherine
Comanor, Laurie Gandrud and Eva Mortensen
are shooting for NCAA standards in the 400
individual medley, among many other races.
Not included in those eight are freshman
freestyler Jane Skillman and senior breast
stroker Lori Heisick, both of whom Quick con
siders already qualified since their times meet
NCAA consideration standards. If there
aren't enough swimmers with automatic
marks to fill the NCAA field, those with the
fastest consideration times will be added.
"I think they can get in with the times they
have right now," Quick said. "But I'm still
looking for them to improve during the meet."
The conditions should be perfect for fast rac
ing at the Belmont Plaza, as the complex boasts

one of the fastest pools in the nation. Addition
ally, every conference school will also be look
ing to post its final qualifying standards, and
the racing may be the fastest yet this season.
"It's going to be a really good meet because
everyone has the same goals — to swim fast
for NCAA times and to finish high in the team
standings," Quick said. "It's also a very com
petitive conference meet considering most of
the teams in our conference will finish in the
top 10 at the end of the season."
Besides focusing on qualifying standards,
Stanford, the defending champion, will return
six individual title-holders, including diver
Eileen Richetelli, who captured the 3-meter
competition last year. Pac-10 veterans Jenny
Thompson, Katherine Comanor, Lea Love
less, Lori Heisick and Janel Jorgensen will
also lead the team in this year's title run.
The 1992 Cardinal squad won 13 individu
al titles and five relay events en route to its
fourth straight championship under Quick
and sixth consecutive championship overall.
Stanford swimmers also rewrote the Pac-10
record book last year, as they posted 14 indi
vidual and relay records in 17 events.
