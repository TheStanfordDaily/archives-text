## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Two states, two meets, two
days. This is what the weekend
holds in store for the No. 12 Stan
ford men's gymnastics team as it
travels to No. 3 BYU tonight,
then hosts No. 5 UCLA tomorrow
at 7:30 p.m. in Burnham Pavil
ion.
"I'm expecting this to be the
toughest weekend of the season,"
coach Sadao Hamada said. "We're
meeting two of the top teams in
the country back-to-back."
The Cougars will be out for
revenge in tonight's meet after
narrowly losing at Stanford last
weekend by a score of 281.05-
279.05.
The Bruins will also be eager
to upset the defending national
champions.
On the upswing of its season,
UCLA recently scored 280.15
points at the UCLA Invitational.
Chainey Umphrey, who is cur
rently the No. 2 all-around com
petitor in the nation, leads the
Bruin squad.
After posting the highest score
in the nation against BYU, the
Cardinal is looking to move up in
the rankings over the next two
days. Stanford is aiming for a
team score of 283.00, which
might propel it to a top-five rank
ing.
"It is important for us to put
up big scores because we have
very few meets left to improve
our standing," senior Jeff Bender
said.
Despite the poll-watching, the
squad's performances in the gym,
particularly the team's consisten
cy, are Hamada's primary con
cerns.

"We hope to hit more routines
than last week," Hamada said.
"Hopefully we won't have more
than two misses on any event —
that really hurts us."
The Cardinal will display simi
lar lineups in both meets, accord
ing to Hamada. He will look to the
team's co-captains, senior Jair
Lynch and junior Mark Booth, to
lead the team in the all-around
competition, as well as boost team
morale.
Hamada also expects sopho
mores Josh Stein and Jing-Wei
Liang to contribute to Stanford
victories, as both gymnasts are
scheduled to compete in all six
events.
Seniors Bender and Shawn
Adamek, each participating in
four or five events, will also see
plenty of action.
While Hamada knows the two
day series will be rigorous for the
Cardinal, he hopes the team's
intensity and depth will carry it
through.
"While I am expecting this
weekend to be physically and
mentally very demanding, I am
also treating it as one of the
peaks of the season," Hamada
said.
The back-to-back meets were
scheduled to prepare the Cardinal
for the NCAA finals, which will
also be held on two consecutive
days.
"The key for this weekend is
going to be to stay healthy,"
Adamek said. "Everyone's going
to be pretty tired after two
days."
Saturday's meet marks the
last home appearance for the
team's three seniors, all of whom
have toiled four years for the Car
dinal.
