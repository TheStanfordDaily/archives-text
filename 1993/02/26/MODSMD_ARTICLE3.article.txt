# ASSU denies solar car, Daily fee requests

The Stanford Solar Car Project and
The Daily were the only student groups
denied placement on the April ballot for
special fees last night, as the ASSU Sen
ate briskly approved 30 of 32 requests.
Rick Wolfgram, The Daily's busi
ness manager, called the senate's de
cision to reject the paper's request
"one of the most cynical things I've

ever seen in my life."
Despite consistent student support
at the polls — The Daily's fee request
has been approved by a 73 percent av
erage over the last three years — the
senate overwhelmingly voted down
the request of $58,565. "Next year we
might go straight to the students and
skip the senate altogether," Wolf
gram said.
Undergraduate senator Mae Lee,
who voted against the request, said,
"It doesn't seem that it's critical that

the ASSU give them $58,000 to keep
The Daily running."
Wolfgram and former Daily Edi
tor-in-Chief June Cohen adjured the
senate to endorse the request, claim
ing that with decreased advertising
revenue, the paper needs the student
fees to merely break even this year.
The fees — which amount to about 2
cents per issue per student — are used
to pay costs such as printing, typeset
ting and distribution on campus.
"The difference between a good

Daily and a bad Daily is a big one,"
Wolfgram said, adding that a loss of
student support could conceivably
lead to smaller issues and elimination
of several regular Daily departments.
Graduate senator Robert Lo
denkamper said that any senate deci
sion on the Daily's request would not
"make a difference," since the paper
will, in all likelihood, be able to canvass
enough popular support to appear on
