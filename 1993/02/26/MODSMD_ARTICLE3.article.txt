# ASSU denies solar car, Daily fee requests

The Stanford Solar Car Project and
The Daily were the only student groups
denied placement on the April ballot for
special fees last night, as the ASSU Sen
ate briskly approved 30 of 32 requests.
Rick Wolfgram, The Daily's busi
ness manager, called the senate's de
cision to reject the paper's request
"one of the most cynical things I've

ever seen in my life."
Despite consistent student support
at the polls — The Daily's fee request
has been approved by a 73 percent av
erage over the last three years — the
senate overwhelmingly voted down
the request of $58,565. "Next year we
might go straight to the students and
skip the senate altogether," Wolf
gram said.
Undergraduate senator Mae Lee,
who voted against the request, said,
"It doesn't seem that it's critical that

the ASSU give them $58,000 to keep
The Daily running."
Wolfgram and former Daily Edi
tor-in-Chief June Cohen adjured the
senate to endorse the request, claim
ing that with decreased advertising
revenue, the paper needs the student
fees to merely break even this year.
The fees — which amount to about 2
cents per issue per student — are used
to pay costs such as printing, typeset
ting and distribution on campus.
"The difference between a good

Daily and a bad Daily is a big one,"
Wolfgram said, adding that a loss of
student support could conceivably
lead to smaller issues and elimination
of several regular Daily departments.
Graduate senator Robert Lo
denkamper said that any senate deci
sion on the Daily's request would not
"make a difference," since the paper
will, in all likelihood, be able to canvass
enough popular support to appear on
the ballot. Nevertheless, The
Daily's request was soundly
defeated.
"We were slaughtered," Wolf
gram said. "There is no way you
can tell me their ears were open
to what we were saying. They had
no intention of voting for us."
"Why wouldn't they want to
vote for what the students obvi
ously support?" he asked. "The
senate doesn't trust us, doesn't
like us, and for whatever reason
they feel it's legitimate for stu
dent government to reject the
appeals of the paper. That's
unbelievable."
But several senators argued
that The Daily's request was
unnecessary, especially in light of
the recent announcement of the
establishment of the Friends of
The Daily Foundation, a trust
fund designed to finance projects
such as technological improve
ments and staff development.
The Solar Car Project, which
was approved by the senate last
year, also went down in defeat.
"This project is a noble one, but
the bottom line is that 30 stu
dents is not a significant number
of people," said undergraduate
senator Erik Maurer.
The Project requested
$21,850 in special fees. Chris
Shaw, the organization's treasur
er, said he was confident he could
collect the required number of

signatures to override the sen
ate's decision.
According to graduate senator
Ralph Ermoian, co-chair of the
ASSU Appropriations Commit
tee, the increase in the total
amount of student fees approved
this year was less than that of
previous years.
Groups denied placement in
the student election can still
appear on the ballot if they pro
duce a petition of 1300 student
signatures endorsing the request.
Special fees are granted to those
groups which receive the
approval of more than 50 percent
of the voters.
Aside from the discussion sur
rounding The Daily, the senators
sailed through most of the rest of
the debate. Though the senate
haggled late in the meeting about
salary cuts for volunteer student
organizations, few of the budgets
submitted by the appropriations
committee were altered.
At one point in the midst of a
flurry of special fee approvals,
Ermoian cautioned the senate
about moving too hastily.
"There's an awful lot of money
being put on the ballot," he said.
"If you have questions, ask them.
This comes across like a series of
slam-dunks."
Even so, the meeting
adjourned at 10:40 p.m., more
than four hours earlier than last
year, when the special fees ses
sion lasted until 3 a.m.
Senate Chair Ron Brown said
that the senate will not reconvene
until next quarter.
