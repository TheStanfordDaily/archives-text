# Casper finds improving Stanford image a slow, difficult process
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
When he assumed Stanford's
presidency, Gerhard Casper knew
that his first tasks would be to
improve the University's tar
nished public image, restore a fair
relationship with the government
and boost confidence in a commu
nity jarred by scandal.
But with a $230 million federal
lawsuit hanging over the Univer
sity's head, he is finding those
chores difficult. While he believes
there has been some improve
ment in faculty morale and a
slight warming in relations with
the government, he concedes that
changing more fundamental atti
tudes will take some time.
"It's a slow boring of boards, a
hammering away, and that's what
I'm doing," he said.
Faculty, too, say they don't con
sider the indirect-cost controversy
behind them: it lingers in the Uni
versity's continuing budgetary cut
backs and the federal lawsuit that
threatens future financial stability.
"You'd be crazy to think this
issue is resolved," said Political

Science Prof. Stephen Krasner.
"Faculty are still wary," said
English Prof. Ron Rebholz. "I don't
think the morale of the University
is any better than it was before."
News coverage of Stanford,
however, has improved dramati
cally since Casper took over. A
friendly profile.in The New York
Times last week credited Casper
with instituting calm and steering
clear of controversy.
"What the University needed
after the period of malaise was a
sense of calm leadership," said
History Prof. Barton Bernstein.
Stanford's budget woes, howev
er, will be more difficult to con
quer than the press. The budget
shortfall is $110 million over three
years — $44 million last year, $41
million this year and an expected
deficit of $25 million next year.
Casper warns that future bud
get cuts remain a possibility. "We
will have to review all our business
practices," he said. "We will have
to reduce somewhat the variety
and multitude of things we are
doing — we cannot do everything."
While Casper said he had estab
lished a "more positive" working

relationship with Bush adminis
tration officials, that does little
good now that President Clinton is
in office.
"I have no particular idea what
the attitude of the Clinton admin
istration is," he said. "I haven't
had any interactions with them,
and indeed, some of the people
aren't even in place in the agen
cies with which we are most close
ly connected."
On its last day in office, the
Bush administration released
new indirect-cost regulations that
contained some good news for
Stanford. The final wording of the
regulations, for instance, con
tained changes suggested by
Stanford that lessened the blow of
what could have been an $11 mil
lion drop in reimbursements for
some administrative costs.
But even those new regula
tions are now up in the air. When
the Clinton administration took
office, it froze all of the last
minute regulations — including
indirect-costs — proposed by the
Bush administration.
"We still have lots of problems
out there to be solved," Casper said.
