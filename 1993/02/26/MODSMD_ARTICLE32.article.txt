## Ditch the itch and other health tips 
### Michael Green Joshua Walker Staff writers 
It's that time of the year again: the time
when sanity teeters on the edge of the aca
demic abyss, when normalcy gets pruned by
the pinking sheers of pressure, when personal
health and well-being gets nuked in the
microwave of midterms.
But never fear, the staff of Cowell Student
Health Center is here to help you.
Now, the dedicated staff at Cowell takes a
lot of crap. Heck, everyone's got a story about
how they did or didn't have mono or how they
were late for CIV section because they were
waiting for an Advil.
If the Cowell staff doesn't seem to be giving
you their full attention, it's because they are
very busy — triage nurses handle up to 90
walk-ons a day. And remember: you're the one
without an appointment.
In order to alleviate this traffic, the Cowell
staff has recently added a new resource: the
Phone Nurse. One of their staff nurses is
made available for phone advice for just about
any ailment you might have. If they can't help
you immediately, they can save you a good
amount of time by referring you to whoever
can.
So we decided to take this new service and
put it to good use. Not only can you find a new
appreciation for the improved Cowell, but you
can also get rid of those annoying ailments.
Really, really runny nose dripping with
snot:
This could be the beginning of a cold or,
worse, allergies. If the mucus is clear then
just keep a load of Kleenex handy (or at least
wear a long-sleeve shirt, but beware of crust
build-up). Drink a lot of fluids to keep it run
ning thin. If it's chunky and contains pieces of
your frontal lobe, see a doctor immediately.

Oh, and no matter what, don't look into the
tissue after you blow into it. That's just plain
yucky.
Acute case of Midterm Hand or Nintendo
Thumb:
It's simple, back off and rest your hand —
no touching, fondling and definitely no exams.
Taking an over-the-counter anti-inflammato
ry, such as Ibuprofen (i.e. "Nupe It!"), will
help get rid of the immediate pain. If there is
any loss of feeling, it might be something
unrelated, but problematic.
Your perky lil* bootie is asleep:
Get up and walk around. Or get a massage
. . . yeah, a massage.
The vision in your right eye is fuzzy:
This is potentially serious (ask Sammy
Davis, Jr.). The nurse will ask questions about
head injuries, headaches and vomiting, to try
and figure out what the problem might be.
Don't operate any heavy machinery and go to
see a physician. If your eye falls out suddenly,
put it in your pocket and get help quickly.
You've got massive zits on your back:
First, always wear a shirt. Then, a warm,
wet soak should reduce the pain and promi
nence of your Backne. Don't squeeze or pop
them, or let your friends make fun of you, as
this can lead to additional infections. Plus, it
can hurt. A good shot of Benzoil Peroxide
might help reduce their size and frequency.
And remember, no one ever really talks about
zits in the halls of their high school like people
on those annoying commercials.
Those darned itchy cuticles:
Smear on a glob of hand cream (hypo-aller
genic). Rub it in gently. Spread excess on
roommate's face.

So, your gums are bleeding:
Close your mouth. If you have chronic bad
breath and/or sores in your mouth, in addition
to the bleeding, then this could be a case of
"trench mouth." Stay away from human con
tact (at least keep far from us) and see a doc
tor. Go ahead and eat all the onions and garlic
you want. Otherwise, remember to brush
more often and floss regularly. Waxed cinna
mon flavored floss — yum.
You've sneezed blood (once):
Wipe your face off. This is a harbinger of an
awful cold and serious congestion. If it occurs
again, bring yourself and your bloody snot on
over.
Itchy and twitchy genitals:
Eeew. This could be the start of a S.T.D., so
be kind to your Neener and handle it early.
Don't be reluctant or afraid to be frank with
the nurse — they've seen it all. Additionally,
all such cases are handled confidentially,
there's no examine-and-tell here — the
description of your ailment to be given to the
doctor will be labeled "Personal" rather than
"Scratchy," so that all the people in the office
won't know about your problem.
If there is a rash, it may just be jock itch,
which isn't much to worry about; however, if
the symptoms include sores or bugs, you will
be immediately referred to a physicians. Don't
use Raid.
Hopefully these helpful health and hygiene
hints will halt the harassing of your hurtful
hassles.
And remember, Cowell's new system can
save a lot of Tetris time. It's like calling Mom
for chicken soup recipes, but with formal
training. Going to Cowell, over a hospital or
private physician, can save you muchos pesos.
So be nice, they've had a hard day too. Even
though they didn't barf up a pancreas.
