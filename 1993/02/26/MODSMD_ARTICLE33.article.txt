# A 						new tuition plan: no futility in utility
## 
### 
I was sitting by a comfy fire
last night contemplating Presi
dent Casper's three-year academ
ic plan, and reading a little philos
ophy, when I came across Mills'
theory of utility. It got me to
thinking, which is a big deal see
ing as midterms are over and I am
not required to think for another
two weeks.
If getting the most for our
money is that important, I
thought in a sudden burst of ital
ics, what would happen if every
thing on this campus was priced
to match its actual utility ? That
is, how would life change if you
really got what you paid for, or
more precisely, paid for what
you'd get?
Sure, there'd be logistical
problems: Viennese Ball tickets
would be anywhere from 50 to
five dollars per person, depending
on whether your date had the
graceful step of Fred Astaire or
Fred Flinstone.
And we'd have to let Berkeley
students into Big Game for free.
But going to the bookstore
would be much less painful - heck,
a whole quarter of CIV books
would set you back five bucks, at
a nickel a page.
On the darker side, though,
highlighters might go for seven or
eight dollars ('cause if you high
light it, that proves you've read it,
right?).
Hey, condoms would still be
free. Except maybe in a vending
machine on the fourth floor of
Green. But I am in no place to put
a price on sex. Did you hear that,
women of Stanford? I am in no
place to put a price on sex.
My pitiful undersexed whining
would also, no doubt, cost me
nothing.
But good news for Liberal Arts
majors! While engineers would be

forced to pay $50 grand a year for
their oh-so-useful degrees,
English majors could get a B.A.
for $79.95 with a Master's
thrown in for the first 50 callers. I
think it's a decent trade-off: no
one could afford both a useful
degree and a bike. I figure, if
you're gonna get to sit in front of
a computer for $40,000 a year
after college, you should have to
walk from Governor's Corner to
class every day.
No one gets a bad deal in a
Stanford priced for utility.
We could put this blasted
bring-your-own-beer brouhaha to
bed (can I have a "B" for $1,000
please?). Pay for beer? Never! I
mean, it might help you forget
about all the work you have to do,
or how much you paid for your
room key, but hey, increased util
ity?? Nuh-uh. No one finds utility
in complete incoherency and pub
lic humiliation — except maybe in
selecting vice-presidential candi
dates.
I offer this plan simply as a
public service— an option for
President Casper during this time
of economic reevaluation. 1 mean,
I'm no Tim Taylor, but if my plan
goes through, Taylor will have to
mortgage his house to pay for his
overhead projector, and I'll be
making a fortune selling bike hel
mets door-to-door in Rains.


Jind cash, coins, and gold 'cause he sure needs it!
