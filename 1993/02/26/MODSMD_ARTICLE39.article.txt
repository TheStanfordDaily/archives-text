# Netters face erratic Bears in Berkeley

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Saturday's men's tennis match at California
promises to be as exciting as the Cardinal action
last weekend at Louisville, Ky.'s National Team
Indoor Championships, according to Stanford
coach Dick Gould.
"They are a capable, if not scary team," he said.
"I'm sure it will go down to the last match."
The No. 2 Cardinal men are bouncing back after
a rough weekend in Louisville, where they played
three close matches but finished ninth.
Playing on the road again this weekend may take
its toll, even though the team is only travelling
across the Bay.
"It'll be a toss-up, especially over there," Gould
said. Over the years, the Cardinal has lost more
matches than it has won at the Bear cave, although
last year Stanford won easily, 7-2.
The Bears (2-1) are strong down the line, and
their top two players, Tommy Phanco and Brian
Eagle, are especially notable. Phanco, a senior,
defeated several Stanford players last fall en route
to winning the Rolex Indoor Qualifying tourna
ment in San Jose.
Eagle, a transfer from San Jose State, is now eli
gible to compete for Cal after sitting out a year due
to NCAA regulations. In the same Rolex tourna
ment, he defeated the Cardinal's Vimal Patel and
Robert Devens, finishing in second place behind his
teammate.
Stanford's top hitter, Michael Flanagan, did not
play in the fall tournament, as he had already qual
ified for the national tourney.
Also adding power to the Bear lineup is Anders
Rolfsen, who Gould describes as, "erratic, but very
strong . . . when he's playing well."
Freshman Casey Louie has climbed into the top
half of the Bears' singles lineup and should provide a
tough match for one of the Cardinal's middle men.
"Their team is very similar to ours," Gould said.
"They match up well with us, so it should be a close,
exciting match."
