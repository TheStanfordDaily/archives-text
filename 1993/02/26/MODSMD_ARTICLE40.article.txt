# Grapplers at Pac-10s
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
A blotch of cardinal ink
might quite possibly possess
higher mathematical and ver
bal capabilities than Beavers,
Ducks and Wildcats.
But higher SAT scores won't
help the 3-6 Stanford wrestling
team much in the Pacific 10
Championships this Sunday
and Monday at Boise State.
Rather than relying on their
intellect, the Cardinal grap
plers have been augmenting
and perfecting their ever
expanding repertoires over the
last three weeks. At this junc
ture, specialization and depen
dence on favorite tactics would
prove fatal.
"You can't have a hole," said
Stanford head coach Chris Hor
pel. "If you just shoot at one leg,
wrestlers will Find your hole in
30 seconds. They'll smell it."
And the zoo at the Pac-10
tournament will have a very
keen sense of smell indeed.
Nonetheless, two Cardinal grap
plers may make serious bids for
conference titles and garner
invitations to next month's
NCAA Championships.
Co-captain Lance Johnson, a
142-pound junior, enters the
nine-man, single elimination
tournament as one of the top
four seeds. Johnson, who com
pleted the regular season with

a 8-1 dual meet record, has
been honing his high-crotch,
single-leg shoot. (A "shoot" is
an attempt to secure a hold on
an opponent's leg.)
Likewise, 134-pound red
shirt freshman Jimmy Aguirre
has concentrated on finishing
his high-crotch, single and dou
ble leg shoots. He is best from
the outside — that is, when not
entangled with his adversary.
However, Aguirre hasn't
always been conscious of his
position on the mat. In past
outings, Aguirre has some
times taken his opponent down
only to discover that they were
out-of-bounds.
Like his co-captain, Aguirre
is a top-four seed and boasts a
8-1 dual meet record. Other
wrestlers with outside chances
of placing include 118-pound
senior Phil Nowick, 126-pound
senior Dave Nowick and 150-
pound freshman Tod Surmon.
In terms of team standings,
Horpel figures that the race for
the conference championship
will come down to Oregon State
and Arizona State, which are
both of ranked in the nation's
top 10. Although the coach
feels his squad has made con
siderable physical and psycho
logical progress since its season
finale against Fresno State, he
expects his relatively young
team to place somewhere in the
middle of the Pac.
