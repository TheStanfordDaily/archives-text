# Starhawk stresses sacredness of the living world

Focusing on her views of the earth as
a conscious, living organism, Starhawk
— a feminist, peace activist and self
proclaimed witch — spoke to an audi
ence of about 150 people last night in
Jordan Hall on her practices of the An
cient Goddess religion.
The author of four spiritual books,
Starhawk led the discussion as part of
the Women's Herstory Celebration,
emphasizing ways to honor the sacred
ness of the earth in both the current,

changing times and in the future.
"For a long time now, we have been
informed by religion that what is sacred
is outside of this world," said Starhawk.
"But there is a very different, original
conception of sacred as being right here,
embodied in the living world."
Citing what scientists today are call
ing "the Gaia hypothesis," Starhawk
explained that the world is "self-regu
lated," like a human being. However,
she continued, this view is not new but
has been around for several thousand
years, beginning with cultures that
worshipped the idea and images of fe

male goddesses.
Many societies then were "matrifocal"
— mother-focused — and structured in
such ways that "the power of bringing life
into being [was| appreciated," she said.
Meanwhile, "male power was thought of
as something that brings life," rather
than violent and domineering.
Claiming that this world view has
been suppressed for several centuries
by organized religion, Starhawk ex
plained that "the idea of Earth being
alive is coming forth again," and said
this change is leading to several key po
litical conflicts happening today.

"If our world is a living organism,
everything we do is interconnected. We
cannot have an economy if we are de
stroying our resources, and the real
reason we are in an economic slump is
that we have reached the end of our re
sources," Starhawk said.
In order to make the switch to an
earth-oriented world view, she said, one
can draw on "technology" like magic, de
fined as "the art of changing conscious
ness."
