# Starhawk stresses sacredness of the living world
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Focusing on her views of the earth as
a conscious, living organism, Starhawk
— a feminist, peace activist and self
proclaimed witch — spoke to an audi
ence of about 150 people last night in
Jordan Hall on her practices of the An
cient Goddess religion.
The author of four spiritual books,
Starhawk led the discussion as part of
the Women's Herstory Celebration,
emphasizing ways to honor the sacred
ness of the earth in both the current,

changing times and in the future.
"For a long time now, we have been
informed by religion that what is sacred
is outside of this world," said Starhawk.
"But there is a very different, original
conception of sacred as being right here,
embodied in the living world."
Citing what scientists today are call
ing "the Gaia hypothesis," Starhawk
explained that the world is "self-regu
lated," like a human being. However,
she continued, this view is not new but
has been around for several thousand
years, beginning with cultures that
worshipped the idea and images of fe

male goddesses.
Many societies then were "matrifocal"
— mother-focused — and structured in
such ways that "the power of bringing life
into being [was| appreciated," she said.
Meanwhile, "male power was thought of
as something that brings life," rather
than violent and domineering.
Claiming that this world view has
been suppressed for several centuries
by organized religion, Starhawk ex
plained that "the idea of Earth being
alive is coming forth again," and said
this change is leading to several key po
litical conflicts happening today.

"If our world is a living organism,
everything we do is interconnected. We
cannot have an economy if we are de
stroying our resources, and the real
reason we are in an economic slump is
that we have reached the end of our re
sources," Starhawk said.
In order to make the switch to an
earth-oriented world view, she said, one
can draw on "technology" like magic, de
fined as "the art of changing conscious
ness."
Defining the word "witch" to mean
"to bend and to shape," Starhawk
described witches like herself as
those who "carry on the goddess
tradition." In her religion, Hal
loween is a significant holiday. It is
seen as the birth of the new year
and a time to honor ancestors.
"If you focus energy on some
thing, things start to change. The
same is true on a larger scale — if
you want to shift the paradigm,
you need to find many ways to
enact that," Starhawk said.
Ritual is another method of
bringing about change, because it
"helps you take on values" and
gives you "a way of understanding
questions of how consciousness
changes."

She described, as an example,
the "positive rite of passage" that
girls in her religion go through
when they begin menstruation.
Starhawk said a girl and her
mother run along the beach with
their wrists tied together until the
mother is exhausted. Then the red
cord is cut and the daughter con
tinues alone until she can go no
further. The pair is then reunited
with a group of women, who tell
stories of their own first menstru
ation. Then they are joined by the
significant men in the girl's life for
a feast.
She also stressed the need to
persist despite others' resistance
to change. "Truth and time are on
our side. . . if you can be patient,
ideas that seem shocking today
will be normal in a few years." For
example, she said, "there will

come a time when gays in the mil
itary will be normal, just as differ
ent races in the military are."
Starhawk concluded the
evening with a meditation and a
song. Instructing the audience to
breathe deeply, she advised
"think about what is sacred to
you. .. imagine our whole society
built around these values, to pro
tect and take care of what each
considers sacred. Would it look
different? What would change?"
She then encouraged the most
ly female audience to join in a
chant, allowing their voices to
"join together to raise the energy
to make those changes." As the
song ended, she continued: "Draw
some of this energy in, then give a
little back to the earth by reach
ing down and touching the
ground as you open your eyes."
