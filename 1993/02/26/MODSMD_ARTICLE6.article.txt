## Clinton's plan needs more cuts 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Legislators should vote "no" to Clinton's pro
posed economic plan, said Economics Prof. John
Taylor, a former member of President Bush's Coun
cil of Economic Advisers, last night during a KZSU
broadcast.
"This particular plan could do some harm to the
economy," Taylor said. "The best part of the plan is
its focus on the deficit, and Clinton helping America
realize that long-term productivity has to go up. But
the combination of tax increases and spending cuts
doesn't have enough decrease in spending."
Taylor pointed out that even with Clinton's plan,
the budget deficit would just decrease to 3 percent of
the GNP by 1997, the level it was at in 1990. Then
spending would cause the deficit to rise again, he
said.
Clinton's plan, which would reduce the net
deficit by $473 billion by 1998, calls for $168 billion
in spending cuts and $305 billion in tax increases
over a four-year span.
While he criticized Clinton's economic strategy,
Taylor also praised Clinton for setting forth a plan
with specific details, even though he did not agree
with them. "You have to give Clinton credit for
putting a reduction plan on the table which focuses
on budget deficit," he said.
"It is significant that we now have a proposal
which we can discuss. And people in America sup
port Clinton. We want to see him succeed, but we
also want him to be wise with the dollar."
In addition, Taylor emphasized that Federal Re
serve chairman Alan Greenspan's judgment on the
plan "wouldn't be called an endorsement. ... It was
the media that described it as endorsement, which
perhaps helped the plan's credibility."
Taylor said that Greenspan, who has conserva
tive leanings, agreed with the general ideas of the
plan but not the details.
"Greenspan said the particulars were up for po
litical debate, but he himself was not in the position
to comment on it," Taylor said.
As far as plans for the $30 billion short-term eco
nomic stimulus, which he characterized as half
spending increases and half tax cuts, Taylor esti
mated that the impact would be modestly harmful,
though minimal. "While it's bad to increase spend
ing in regards to the budget deficit, no one would say
it's a big difference."
Taylor also expressed concern
over Clinton's credibility after
repeated campaign pledges not to
increase taxes on the middle
class. "On the other hand, people
are listening when the president
says the budget deficit is worse
than previously thought," he
said.
"I don't think the credibility
issue will affect the passage of
this plan, but it will play if there
are further tax increases to fund
spending."
