Clinton wants tobacco tax
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton suggested yesterday he may pro
pose higher taxes on tobacco and other
products that pose a health risk to help
pay for his national health insurance plan.
"You do have to find some way to
recover some revenues" to extend
health insurance to the 37 million
Americans who don't have it, he said.
White House officials said Hillary
Rodham Clinton's task force on health
care reform also is considering —
although without much enthusiasm — a
proposal to tax workers' health benefits
as income.
Clinton indicated his administration
would look beyond the tax increases pro

posed for his economic program to
finance his health-insurance program.
New president in S. Korea
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Kim
Young Sam was sworn in as South
Korea's first civilian president in 32
years yesterday and pledged to build a
new Korea with a cleaner government
and stronger economy.
"Misconduct and corruption are the
most terrifying enemies attacking the
foundations of our society," Kim said in
his inauguration speech. "Immediate
reform will start at the very top."
Kim also challenged North Korean
leader Kim II Sung to discuss unifying
the divided Korean peninsula.
