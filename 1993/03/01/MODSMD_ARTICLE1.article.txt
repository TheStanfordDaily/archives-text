# Local experts 'dreaming' up transit plan

### David McAleer 
In an effort to increase transportation options be
tween Stanford and Palo Alto, University and city
planners have invited a group of highly respected out
side planning experts to brainstorm ideas for land use
and urban design in the area between the two commu
nities.
The group will study and suggest changes for trans
portation and land use in the area bounded by El
Camino Reed, Alma Street, Embarcadero Road and
San Francisquito Creek.
The design brainstorming session was organized by
an ad hoc committee, known as the Dream Team,
which consists of individuals from Stanford and Palo
Alto as well as transportation agencies and other con
cerned parties. Dream Team meetings are open to the
public.
The projected cost of the meeting, scheduled for the
last weekend in March, is $22,000, which will be split
evenly between Stanford and Palo Alto. The Palo Alto
City Council approved its share of the funding last
Monday night. University funding had already been
approved.
Andy Doty, Stanford's director of community rela
tions, said he was "quite excited" about the meeting.
"I feel it has great potential to resolve a number of
issues" about local land use and transportation.
University architect David Neuman, one of the
main forces behind the Dream Team, said a major goal
is to "foster the relationship between Stanford Uni
versity and Palo Alto in stronger ways."
The Dream Team began meeting informally last
August. In early October, the group outlined its major
goals, which include improving transportation — in
cluding renovation of the Caltrain station — and facil
itating access to different areas of Palo Alto, such as
the Stanford Shopping Center and Town and Country
Village.
Neuman hopes the meeting can generate ideas to
increase access to the Caltrain station and improve
pedestrian and bicycle access across the University
Avenue-El Camino Real interchange.
"This sort of exercise can be favorable and exciting.
The follow-up needs to be that both Palo Alto and
Stanford incorporate it into their thinking and that we
. . . keep working on the ideas," Neuman said.
He stressed the importance of continuing relations
between Palo Alto and the University after the meet
ing. "What we don't want is the impossible dream.. . .
We want something we can work together on to make
it happen," Neuman said.
Jeff Tumlin, a special projects coordinator for
Transportation Programs, said he is excited about im-
