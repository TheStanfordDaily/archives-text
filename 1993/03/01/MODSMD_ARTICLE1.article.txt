# Local experts 'dreaming' up transit plan
## 
### David McAleer 
In an effort to increase transportation options be
tween Stanford and Palo Alto, University and city
planners have invited a group of highly respected out
side planning experts to brainstorm ideas for land use
and urban design in the area between the two commu
nities.
The group will study and suggest changes for trans
portation and land use in the area bounded by El
Camino Reed, Alma Street, Embarcadero Road and
San Francisquito Creek.
The design brainstorming session was organized by
an ad hoc committee, known as the Dream Team,
which consists of individuals from Stanford and Palo
Alto as well as transportation agencies and other con
cerned parties. Dream Team meetings are open to the
public.
The projected cost of the meeting, scheduled for the
last weekend in March, is $22,000, which will be split
evenly between Stanford and Palo Alto. The Palo Alto
City Council approved its share of the funding last
Monday night. University funding had already been
approved.
Andy Doty, Stanford's director of community rela
tions, said he was "quite excited" about the meeting.
"I feel it has great potential to resolve a number of
issues" about local land use and transportation.
University architect David Neuman, one of the
main forces behind the Dream Team, said a major goal
is to "foster the relationship between Stanford Uni
versity and Palo Alto in stronger ways."
The Dream Team began meeting informally last
August. In early October, the group outlined its major
goals, which include improving transportation — in
cluding renovation of the Caltrain station — and facil
itating access to different areas of Palo Alto, such as
the Stanford Shopping Center and Town and Country
Village.
Neuman hopes the meeting can generate ideas to
increase access to the Caltrain station and improve
pedestrian and bicycle access across the University
Avenue-El Camino Real interchange.
"This sort of exercise can be favorable and exciting.
The follow-up needs to be that both Palo Alto and
Stanford incorporate it into their thinking and that we
. . . keep working on the ideas," Neuman said.
He stressed the importance of continuing relations
between Palo Alto and the University after the meet
ing. "What we don't want is the impossible dream.. . .
We want something we can work together on to make
it happen," Neuman said.
Jeff Tumlin, a special projects coordinator for
Transportation Programs, said he is excited about im-
proving commuting options for
Stanford students and employees.
"A lot of people use the train
station," said Tumlin, a Dream
Team member. "Currently, the
station is run-down and danger
ous. There's no place to leave
your bike and no connection (with
Stanford) outside of commuting
hours," Tumlin said. "We could
improve the situation and cut five
to 10 minutes off our (travel]
times."
Neuman said "one of the inspi
rations" for the group was com
plaints he heard from members of
the Stanford community.
"I was really trying to repre
sent what I was hearing from my
students and faculty," he said.
"Part of the reason I suggested
this is that students have come to
me and said, 'Why can't we have
better connections to Palo Alto?' "
Federal grant money from the
1991 Intermodal Surface Trans
portation Efficiency Act also pro
vided incentive for private

groups, local governments and
educational communities to col
laborate on creating innovative
transportation programs.
Nancy Lytle, chief planning
official for Palo Alto, described
the creation of the Dream Team
as the result of common concerns
among different members of the
community.
"Basically, a whole bunch of
people had come to the conclusion
that this needs to be looked at
simultaneously," she said.
Neuman and Lytle both
stressed the importance of having
different community members
get involved. "The more people
get involved, the more chance for
all of us to come up with ideas,"
Neuman said.
The end result of the Dream
Team's work will be a brain
storming session scheduled for
the end of March, in which a
group of respected designers will
create new use plans for the areas
of Palo Alto in question. The five
participants chosen for that meet
ing are professionals in the fields
of urban design, land use plan
ning, transportation, develop
ment and architecture.
