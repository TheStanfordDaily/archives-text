Extended hours at Green
during Dead Week, finals
would help busy students

After nine weeks of
procrastination, it's finally
time to hit those books.
Students all over campus are
suddenly realizing that Dead Week
and finals are just one painfully
short week away. The time has
come to sit down with all those 20-
page research paper topics and pull
out a few good grades.
Unfortunately, Green Library
isn't the place to do it.
Closing at midnight Sunday
through Thursday, Green Library
keeps its regular hours over the
examination period, closing at an
ungodly early hour for those look
ing to do Herculean amounts of
research.
In a mad frenzy of catch-up,
Stanford students rush to Green
— the lone option after the reorga
nization of Meyer — only to be
ousted at midnight.
It would be a great help if Green
could keep its doors open two more
hours during Dead Week and finals,
closing at 2 a.m. To defray the costs
of this extended service, the library
could cut some service hours during
Spring Break in compensation.
Two extra nighttime hours, in
which students would be able to
brave the musty air of the South
Stacks and the low ceilings of the
East Stacks in search of research
materials, would give Stanford
scholars sorely needed time during
one of the busiest paper crunches of
the quarter. Since Stanford students
still have classes during Dead Week
— unlike students at most other col
leges — the University should recog
nize that the demands on them are
greater during this period.
Although Meyer will soon open
its 24-hour study space on the first
floor, Green needs to offer more
hours for those in need of refer
ence materials. Also, the Meyer

space will not be able to accommo
date the needs of all late-night
studiers during this stressful peri
od and extended hours in Green
could help alleviate the crunch.
The library would not necessarily
need to staff the loan desk during
these extended hours — loan hours
could be kept to the standard sched
ule. They could merely remain open
two more hours each night to pro
vide students access to crucial refer
ence books and topical materials.
Cutting back hours during
Spring Break would compensate
for the library staffs overtime.
However, since Green would not
have to be fully staffed during the
extended hours, any Spring Break
cuts could probably be less than
the number of hours added on.
Other college campuses across the
country offer such extended hours,
to meet the demands of their student
bodies. Cornell keeps its main library
open until 2 a.m. during finals, Notre
Dame's largest library stays open 24
hours a day and UC-San Diego pro
vides special hours for students dur
ing the exam period.
Stanford would do a service to
its students to do the same.
While a radical UC-Santa Barbara
group has planned a takeover of their
campus' main library to protest
short hours similar to Green's, the
Stanford library authorities could
avoid such drastic action with two
more hours each night.
Serious students would tremen
dously benefit from the extra
opportunities, and those students
who are perhaps less well-prepared
could salvage their academic
standing with the help of the
library administration.
It is not the University's job to
coddle those students who have
lazily put things off until the last
minute; but it would be unfair to
penalize those students who —
due to heavy course loads in the
more rigorous Winter Quarter or
participation in extracurricular
activities — need extra time to pro
vide their best effort in their pro
jects.
