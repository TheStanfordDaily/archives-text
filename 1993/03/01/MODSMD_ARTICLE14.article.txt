Info in pro-life advertisement needs clarification

THE PRESIDENT OF THE Cali
fornia Right-to-Life Committee
invited readers to "think objective
ly about abortion and its many ramifica
tions" in that group's paid advertise
ment in the Feb. 23 Daily. Unfortunate
ly, the data presented therein is mislead
ing at best.
The last page of the supplement lists
"thousands of serious physical complica
tions from abortion occurring every year
in this country." It fails to mention that
the vast mtyority of the 1.6 million abor
tions performed annually are complica
tion-free. The Center for Disease Con
trol reports that less than 0.2 percent of
first-trimester and less than 2 percent of
later abortions are associated with mqjor
complications. Over the last 20 years
there have been only 1.3 abortion-relat-

Ed deaths for every 100,000 abortions
performed. An abortion is at least five
times safer with respect to survival than
a term pregnancy.
The list of "possible effects on your
emotions" includes symptoms, such as
guilt or lowered self-esteem, which may
occur after an abortion. Psychologist
Nancy Adler from UC-San Francisco has
reviewed several-hundred articles con
cerning emotional sequelae of abortion
and, by excluding those which are not
scientifically rigorous, noted very consis
tent observations between investigators,
regardless of political, moral or religious
background. She concludes in her article
"Psychological Responses after Abor
tion," published in Science on April 6,
1990, that "severe negative reactions
after abortion are rare and can best be

understood in the framework of coping
with a normal life stress." In other
words, any of a variety of stressors, such
as midterms, could engender any of the
listed symptoms.
Most insidious of all is the putative
"Post-Abortion Syndrome." Although
the time frame of the symptoms —
ranging from hallucinations and fetal
visitations to suicidal thoughts — is not
mentioned, the term "syndrome" con
notes long-term effects. Dr. Adler has
found that the best predictor of a
woman's psychological status after an
abortion is her pre-pregnant level of
functioning.
Distress is actually higher prior to the
abortion, and within two weeks after
ward, 76 percent of women report feel
ing relief and happiness. The most com

mon negative emotion, guilt, is experi
enced by only 17 percent of women.
Therefore, the prevalence of symptoms
listed under "Post-Abortion Syndrome"
is the same in women after abortion as
in the general population.
Negative feelings after an abortion do
occur. Ambivalence about the wanted
ness of the pregnancy can engender a
feeling of loss. Internal conflicts about
the meaning of abortion and its relation
to deeply held beliefs, perceived social
stigma or lack of support may result in
depression or post-abortion anxiety. The
"Post-Abortion Syndrome," as presented
in the paid advertisement by the Califor
nia Right-to-Life Committee, is a
canard.
