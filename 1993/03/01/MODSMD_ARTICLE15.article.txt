# Green space should be a priority when more parking is constructed

### 
Give me $500 to rent a small loader
so I can haul off the short-sighted B.S.
that William Trabucco offered in his let
ter to The Daily concerning solving
Stanford's parking woes.
Trabucco implies that he would have
the University situate a new building on
an open field instead of an existing park
ing lot. The idea of Cro Mem II smack in
the middle of the Oval doesn't jibe with
my aesthetic sense — how about yours?
And what about those bollards along
Campus Drive? Sure, tear them out, but
why stop there? Let's uproot all those
oak and elm trees between here and El
Camino, each of which occupies a poten
tial parking space.
While we're at it, let's put a double-deck
expressway right over the Quad, so all the
pre-meds can fulfill their wildest fantasies
by driving their Integras straight from
their dorms to the Chem Library.

Stanford is losing the "farm atmo
sphere" which once made it unique.
With respect to student parking especial
ly, we should recognize that too many of
us drive too often. How many times have
you driven to the Coffee House? Making
cross-campus driving easier is not the
solution to local automobile pollution.
Let's revert moat of the student lots to
unpaved open space, and recover those
spots by constructing a few multi-level,
high-capacity garages in centralized loca
tions — such as between Wilbur and
Mirrielees for East Campus, and in front
of Roble for West Campus. A few spots
next to dorms could be kept for handi
capped and maintenance vehicles. And
when we do make new parking spots,
ample lighting and shuttles should not be
seen as luxuries — not unless Trabucco
would have us take the dangers of sexual
assault with a grain of road salt.
With a rational parking plan such as
Trabucco's, soon we'll all be sun-tanning
on asphalt, not grass. And then where
would Stanford be?
