# There should be more, better-marked parking for off-campus visitors

I charged two tickets by phone to last
Sunday afternoon's performance of "The
Suppliant Women."
It was a powerful play, beautifully
performed. But. . .
Although I arrived 35 minutes
early, all the metered spots behind
Memorial Auditorium were already
taken. As I cruised desperately around
the neighborhood, I passed several
large parking lots with plenty of
empty spaces — but their entrances
were fenced shut. If this was intended
to force me into a pay lot it was point
less, because there was nothing to tell
me where to find such a lot. The place
I finally parked was so far from
Memorial Auditorium that I almost
had to run to make the play on time.
Being 79 and not in top shape, I
arrived exhausted and breathless, as
well as hopping mad. When I walked

back to my car after the play, the
fences were removed.
Stanford doesn't have to sell tickets
to off-campus people. But when it choos
es to do so, it owes some medium of con
sideration to the persons whose money it
takes.
