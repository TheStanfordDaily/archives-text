It's all under the surface

Gnawing on pencils behind
closed doors, we worry ourselves in
circles.
By day we echo each other's noncha
lance as we talk about how lazy we are,
how much work we haven't done and
how we're sure that we'll never get into
whatever we hope to get into. But alone
at night, anxiety settles down to rest and
we forget the feigned easiness that we
bandy around in the daytime
And so on, in a big, bright, sunny game
of tennis, we volley back and forth this
false indifference, only to then scurry
back to our rooms and study madly,
afraid of "A-" 's. Behind all of the easy
smiles rage torrents of paranoia.
As soon as we're into Stanford, we
start worrying that we won't get into
everything else: a dorm, a sorority, a
study program, a job, med school. We
define Stanford by what's outside of it.
We revel in our accepted-ness, cheering
"We got in!", as if we'd finally reached
some inner sanctum. But as soon as we
get in, we find that this was only the out
ermost ring of a whole series of concen
tric circles. Where is the center? There is
always another circle to get in to, some
body else is always inside a place we want
to be. We always feel left out.
The silence in Green library is inter
rupted only by a sound like rats' claws
scuttling across the roof, the noise made
by students scrawling their worries onto

the wood study carrels. The carrels are
an anonymous forum where Stanford
students etch a record of their anxieties
about sex and death and sociability:
•I never see hot gals on this campus.
•Gals? Gals? No wonder you dweeb.
•Get out of the library!
•I love women's feet
•Why are all the men on this campus
scrawny losers?
•You are all sex-crazed.
•To die is the only real proof that we
have lived.
•You people shut up! I'm trying to
study!
We scratch our anxious dialogues into
the wood — alternating writing with wor
rying about the book that looms, unread,
in front of us.
And then our eyes grow heavy and we
doze off, and in our anxious sleep we
dream about the inadequacies we joked
about in waking hours and wonder if
we're really as capable as our neighbors.
All of our counterfeit, casual daytime
quips become nervous nighttime worries:
"I haven't even started the reading for
my paper that's due tomorrow." ("Am I
ever going to finish the paper? What if it's
not good?") "I think I blew it on my chem
test, but I don't even care anymore." ("I
hope to God I managed to score above the
mean. I studied so hard.") "I haven't
even thought about dating anyone."
("Will someone go out with me, please?!")

"I'm not worried." ("Am I worrying too
much?") And then we wake up and the
other busy studiers in their compart
ments compel us back to work.
The Farm is a big, prosperous breed
ing ground of anxiety. Everyone is shoot
ing sideways glances to gauge each
other's successes against his or her own,
all the while pretending not to care.
We're so laid back. We "blow things
off' lightly, whimsically — strolling
around, blowing away our worries with
wisps of careless breath. But at the end of
the day we find that we've spent all of our
air. Casual sighs become nervous gasps
as we're struck by a crisis: "What if
everybody is merely pretending to be laid
back? If that's true, I'll have to work even
harder to appear relaxed."
And then the spiral of worrying spins
downward faster, and the blown-off dusts
of anxiety drift back to settle. We can't
relax, because somewhere somebody
might be working harder, getting ahead
of us, getting into something, some
where, leaving us outside, wanting and
worrying.
