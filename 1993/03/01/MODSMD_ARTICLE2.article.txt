# Taking back the night
## 75 march for women's right to walk alone, without fear 
### Lesley Edwards Staff writer 
They came together to de
mand the right to be alone.
A group of about 75 students
participated in the "Take Back the
Night" march last night, protesting
the fear women have of being at
tacked while walking alone at night.
"For some of us, fear of rape
means we're uncomfortable
walking on campus after dark,"
said organizer Amy Turnbull, a
sophomore. "Others would never
run to the Dish after sunset."
For example, although she is
often tempted to take a walk after
dark, Senior Margaret Solomon
usually thinks better of it. Not
being able to enjoy the solitary
pleasure or convenience of a night
time walk is frustrating, she says.

"It's such an oppression to feel
boxed in and closed up all the
time," said Solomon.
Last night marked the return
of the rally after a two-year hia
tus. Holding candles and chanting
"Women unite, to take back the
night," the participants walked
from White Plaza to the Inner
Quad, where some women shared
their personal experiences with
rape and molestation. There were
moments of sadness, of anger and
even of laughter.
One woman, who spoke publicly
for the first time of her rape, told the
others, "Don't be sad for me — get
angry. Let's take back the night."
The procession continued to
Lake Lagunita where, during a
moment of silence, people were
left to contemplate the stories
they had just heard. Finally, the

march continued to the
Women's Center for a reception.
Sponsored by the Women's
Self-Defense Coalition and the
Women's Center as part of
Women's Herstory Month, the
march advocated strength, free
dom, and speaking out about rape.
Sophomore Selvi Balasubraman
ian, who is taking the self-defense
class this quarter, said that a feeling
of empowerment is the objective of
both the class and the march.
"When I'm taking this class, it
gives me a feeling of strength. We
wanted people to come here to get
that same feeling of strength."
Others emphasized the need
for women's feelings to be treated
with respect and understanding.
"Part of taking back the night is
open, honest communication in
which women's words are taken se
riously," said Turnbull.
Women also need to vocalize
their rape experiences, several
speakers insisted.
"The biggest problem we have to
deal with with rape is silence," said
one woman. "We have to speak out."
Marchers were also concerned
with persistent stereotypes about
rape. For example, women who
are attacked while alone at night
are often blamed for their assault
because they "asked for it," said
organizer Stephanie Woodall.
Participants expressed hope
that someday women will no
longer have to face the fear of
walking alone at night. The free
dom to come and go as one pleas
es is a basic right, they said.
"We want women to know that
they have a right to exist and to make
choices about where they are going
and who they are going with," gradu
ate student Sara Duckler said.
The significant number of men
present at the rally indicated that
women are not alone in fighting
for their freedom. Senior Geoff
McDonald expressed his belief that
together, women and men could
make the night safe for everyone:
"I think that men can be as much
agents of change as women can. I
think more men need to under
stand the issues and express their
support so that women don't have
to live with fear."
