TOTAL DOMINATION.
Those are the only words to
describe the Cardinal women's
basketball team's 100-56 pound
ing of Washington State at home
Saturday night.
Receiving solid play from all
12 of its players, the Stanford
squad controlled the game's
tempo from the opening tip-off,
en route to its highest offensive
production of the season.
"Whatever they [Stanford]
wanted to do, they did it. We
couldn't stop them," said Wash
ington State coach Harold
Rhodes. "For us, that's just a
good old butt-kicking."
After leading 8-7 three min
utes, 30 seconds into the con
test, the Cardinal embarked on a
ferocious 20-4 scoring run, set
ting the pace for a lopsided victo
ry. Six Stanford players scored
buckets during the offensive
spurt.

"We all know that it's time to
play hard," said Cardinal guard
Christy Hedgpeth. "We're
putting down the hammer
against the people we play."
Backup center Anita Kaplan
— who scored 12 first-period
points in just eight minutes —
added her own contributions to
the Stanford attack. The 6-foot
-5 sophomore buried three
straight shots, giving the Cardi
nal an overpowering 19-point
advantage.
A Niki Sevillian three-point
bomb with 0:04 remaining in the
half increased the Cardinal lead
to 47-25 and stirred the Maples
Pavilion crowd of 6,307 into a
frenzy which would last for the
entire second period.
"It was a great crowd," Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "I wish we could play all
our games in front of the home
crowd."
The Cardinal kept things
rolling in the second half, due in
large part to the inspired offen

sive play of its reserve players.
Guards Angela Taylor and Kate
Paye scored eight points and six
points, respectively, while red
shirt freshman Bobbie Kelsey
chipped in five points of her
own. Sevillian once again came
through at the end of the half,
converting a three-point play
that enabled Stanford to reach
the century mark with one sec
ond left to play.
All in all, the Cardinal bench
outscored the starters 54-46.
"Throughout the season, a lot
of people have improved," Van-
Derveer said. "I was happy to see
[so] many contributions from
[so] many people."
VanDerveer was also quick to
recognize that shooting was not
the only thing her squad was
doing well.
"We've had a lot of good
offensive performances," she
said. "But a lot of times, the
offense is related to good defense
and rebounding."
Indeed, 6-foot-3 center Val

Whiting demonstrated her agili
ty early in the second period
when she hustled to intercept
two Washington State passes.
Whiting also excited the crowd
when she swatted a Darci Well
sandt shot attempt in between
the two steals.
Taylor tallied three thefts,
including a perfectly-timed steal
which prevented a sure Cougar
fast-break basket.
Meanwhile, Whiting, Kelsey
and Rachel Hemmer pulled
down a combined total of 25
rebounds, allowing Stanford to
have second and third scoring
opportunities on many of its pos
sessions.
Having earned four consecu
tive victories, the defending
national champion Cardinal is
gaining quite a bit of momentum
as it gets ready for postseason
play.
"It's .. . March and we're get
ting that feeling back," Taylor said.
