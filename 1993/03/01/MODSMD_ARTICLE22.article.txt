# Century mark reached in final seconds of lopsided contest
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Even with her team ahead by 43 points,
Niki Sevillian was feeling all kinds of pressure.
Her free-throw attempt with one second to
go in Saturday night's game was the last
chance for Stanford to reach 100 points.
And 12 teammates and 6,307 screaming
fans let the junior guard know this wasn't just
another foul shot.
Wh oooooooosh.!!!!
As February drew to a close, the Cardinal
continued to build momentum for a champi
onship run in March, devouring a giant serv
ing of confidence and leaving Washington
State to pick up the tab.
Sevillian's free-throw put an exclamation
mark on the win.
"The free-throw just topped off the night,"
she said. "But if I didn't make it, I don't think
I'd have had a friend in the whole gym."
With just seconds to go and the score 97-56,
Sevillian drove the baseline for a layup, know
ing she was taking a risk by not attempting a
three-pointer.

"When I was driving toward the basket, I
was thinking everyone in the gym must hate
me," she confessed. "But when I got fouled,
their opinion changed."
For Sevillian, it was a rare moment in the
spotlight.
"I'm not used to all that excitement indi
vidually," she said.
For Stanford, Saturday night's game
marked the 30th landing on the century
plateau in the team's history. The 1989-90
national champions accounted for one-third of
those offensive feats.
"(Scoring) 100 is kind of a symbolic thing,"
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "It almost just
says, 'great game.' "
The Cardinal's previous leap into triple
digits occurred nearly a year ago when Stan
ford defeated visiting Oregon State, 103-68, on
March 7, 1992.
After Saturday night's game, forward
Rachel Hemmer credited her teammates with
staying loose. "We're relaxing a lot more," she
said. "We're staying within the flow of the
game."
She also stressed the importance of

rebounding in igniting the running game. For
the two-game homestand, Stanford dominated
the boards by a combined 101-64 margin.
"This has been a really good weekend,"
VanDerveer said of her team's sweep of its
Washington opponents. "It gives us good
momentum going to Arizona State and Ari
zona," against whom the Cardinal finishes its
road schedule next week.
"We're really playing better at this time
than we were last year," she added.
The weekend's opposition had no reason to
disagree.
"I've seen Stanford play several times this
year," Washington coach Chris Gobrecht com
mented after Thursday's game. "That is far
and-away the best they've played this year
that I've seen."
Cougar coach Harold Rhodes went even
further in his praise. "As well as they've
played the last couple of ball games," the 11th
year coach said, "I would say this is about as
good as I've ever seen Stanford play.
"The way each kid has come together —
overall, top to bottom, this is the best Stanford
team."
