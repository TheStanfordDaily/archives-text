# Stanford spikers fall prey to BYU in sluggish showing
##

A team plays how it practices.
The Stanford men spikers ended up on the
wrong side of that adage on Saturday night,
losing to Brigham Young, 7-15,15-8,15-7, 15-
9, in Provo.
"There has been very little team consisten
cy in practice, and that has translated to the
matches," said Cardinal coach Ruben Nieves.
The Stanford squad started strongly, win
ning the first game after staking themselves to
an early lead. The Cardinal (6-3, 5-2 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) hit .584,
with contributions from all six starters.
Then, in the next three games, Stanford
was unable to mount a defense as the Cougars
blitzed by. All three were similar — BYU
would take an early lead, then the Cardinal
would attempt to come back. In all three cases,
the comeback was futile.
"Just a case of too little too late," Nieves
said. "BYU raised their level of play after the
first game and we weren't able to keep up."
The Cougars (8-4, 6-4 in the MPSF)
stymied Stanford with their blocking defense.
With 12 team blocks, BYU was able to hold
the Cardinal to a paltry .248 hitting percent
age. The Cougars were able to react-block
well, that is, to wait for the set, then put two
or three blockers in the hitter's face.
BYU's serving also gave Stanford fits. With
five of their six players jump-serving, the
Cougars had eight aces and 31 service errors.
Often Ryan Moos and Bob Hillman, the Car
dinal's swing hitters, were unable to return
the serve with good passes, making the resul
tant set and spike more predictable and there
fore bkx^kable.
BYU was inspired by two substitutes.
Ethan Watts, a Cougar star who rode bench in
the first game, "went crazy on us in the next
three games," according to Nieves. Watts had
11 kills with no errors to hit .687 for the night.
To these totals he added eight blocks, the
same number as the entire Stanford team had
in the match.
Scott I>arkin also came in at swing hitter in

the second game to spur the Cougars on to vic
tory. He had nine kills with no errors to hit
.692.
As a whole, BYU hit .405, the highest hit
ting percentage of a Stanford opponent thus far
this season. This number is evidence of a Car
dinal defense that was defensively impotent.
The Stanford side of the court was filled
with players who did not play to their poten
tial. It started with the play of setter Canyon
Ceman.
"After the first game, Canyon struggled
setting," Nieves said. "He just wasn't click
ing."
At swing hitter, both Moos and Hillman hit
far below their averages, at .304 and .263,
respectively. Moos had 11 kills, which was
third-highest on the team, but no blocks.
Hillman was the Cardinal's best digger,
according to Nieves. But he had only eight
kills, well l>elow his traditional offensive out
put. Still hobbled by a sprained ankle, he was
unable to jump-serve and had to float his
serves across the net, knuckleball style.
The play of sophomore Brian Garrett was
one of Stanford's few highlights. Known for his
offensive production at the middle blocker posi
tion, Garrett lived up to expectations by hitting
.500 with 12 kills in his second start of the year.
His teammate, Joe Burghardt, was not as
successful. He had a subpar match, with seven
kills and a .375 hitting percentage.
"We expect a lot more out of Joe," Nieves
said. "Going into the game, he was leading the
country in hitting percentage."
Outside hitter Dave Goss had the most dis
appointing match for the Cardinal. He had 20
kills, but hit .098 with 15 errors in 51
attempts. His play was a big factor in Stan
ford's loss.
"I had a bad week in practice and was not
prepared for the intensity of the match," Goss
said.
Overall, Nieves thought the team played
like it practiced — with some spurts of genius
marked by significant spurts of mediocrity. "If
the first team cannot handle the second team
in the gym, we are going to have trouble with
opponents like BYU," he said.
