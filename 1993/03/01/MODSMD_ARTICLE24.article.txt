Women's swimming
After one day of a three-day competi
tion, the Cardinal women's swim team
holds a commanding 91-point lead over
the field at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Long Beach.
On the strength of a 1-2-3 sweep in the
500-yard freestyle, a 1-2 knockout in the
200 individual medley and two relay wins,
Stanford put up 413 points to UCLA's
322 and California's 303; the other six
teams stand far behind with less than 200

points apiece.
The Cardinal opened the meet by post
ing a narrow, 0.03-second victory over the
Bruins in the 200 free relay, then relied on
Jane Skillman, Katherine Comanor and
Lisa Jacob to take the top three places in
the 500 free. Janel Jorgensen and Lea
Loveless followed by grabbing the top two
places in the 200 IM, then Jenny Thomp
son fell to the Bruins' Richelle DePold in
the 50 free before Stanford rebounded
with a win in the 400 medley relay.
