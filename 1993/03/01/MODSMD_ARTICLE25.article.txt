PULLMAN, Wash.- On Saturday
in the Palouse, Washington State gave
the Stanford men's basketball team a
swift kick in the caboose. The Cougars
scored the first nine points of the game
and never trailed, booting the Cardinal
87-54 at Friel Court.
Washington State guard Bennie
Seltzer, playing in his last home game,
made his final affair a memorable one
for the 6,831 fans at Beasley Coliseum.
The senior scored a career-high 36
points — including deadly 9-for-16
shooting from three-point range, set
ting a single-game record for the most
threes made on the Cougars' home
court. With his long-range successes on
the day, he brought his career three
point total to 215, setting a Pacific 10
Conference record. Additionally, in
passing out six assists, Seltzer set a new
school career record in that category.
"I don't know if you could have sat
down with Bennie, and asked him to
come up with a script for his final home
game, whether he could have imagined
anything better," said Washington
State coach Kelvin Sampson.
"It was a very emotional game for
me, I was trying to hold back the tears,"
Seltzer said. "I was really focused this
game. I wanted to go out and leave a
good taste in the fans' mouth."
Seltzer and his team certainly left a
bad taste in the mouth of their opposi
tion. Stanford (7-19, 2-12 Pac-10) got
as close as five in the early minutes of
the game before Washington State (14-
10, 8-7) reeled off another run — this
time by an 11-0 count — beginning at
the 14 minute, 35 second mark to claw
the Cardinal into subservience. The
Cougars enjoyed a 24-point margin at
the half, and extended their advantage
even further with a 16-7 spurt to start
the second period.
If not for the Cougars' propensity
for foul trouble, the numbers would
have been even less on the Cardinal
side of the scoreboard. In the first half,
17 of Stanford's 26 points came from
free throws, with freshman forward
Darren Allaway shooting a perfect 10-
for-10.
Washington State played tight
defense throughout the contest, but
what hurt Stanford the most was its
own shooting. The Cardinal shot a hor
rendous 29.3 percent from the field,
converting only 12-of-41 shots. By com
parison, Seltzer sank as many shots as

the entire Cardinal team, going 12-for
-19 on the afternoon.
"I don't think we were ready to
play," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Washington State is an
extremely aggressive team. They got us
backed off and got up into us and we
didn't react."

Aside from Allaway, who finished
with 17 points, no other Cardinal play
er scored more than six points. The rest
of the starting lineup — guards Dion
Cross and Marcus Lollie, forward Brent


Vincent Ho — Daily file
Darren Allaway went 13-for-14 from the free throw line and contributed 17
points to a losing cause as Stanford fell to 2*12 in Pac-10 play.
