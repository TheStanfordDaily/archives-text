# Wildcats outlast Cardinal batters in pair of slugfests
## Arizona knocks out Stanford's '1-2 punch,' ravages relief staff in late-inning comebacks for 14-13, 13-8 wins 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Arizona's mighty bats proved to be too
much for Stanford this weekend at Frank
Sancet Field in Tucson, Ariz.
The Cardinal put on its best two-game
offensive exhibition of the season, scoring
21 runs and pounding out 30 hits.
They scrapped and clawed their way
back to tie both games after falling
behind by four runs on Friday and three
on Saturday.
All Cardinal efforts were in vain, how
ever, as the No. 5 Wildcats (10-5) swept a
rain-shortened series from Stanford, 14-
13 and 13-8.

'We did a real good job of
swinging the bat in both
games. But the bottom
line is, we still lost.'
— Coach Mark Marquess

"I'm very proud of the way we battled
back," Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said, "and we did a real good job of swing
ing the bat in both games.
"But the bottom line is, we still lost."
If winning and losing is the bottom
line, then the No. 10 Cardinal (10-5), who
dropped to 0-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division for the first time
in six years, needs a win badly in today's
series-ender, to salvage an exciting yet
disappointing series.
"It's been really crazy out there," said
Stanford left fielder Shawn Madden. "If
you've been able to put the bat on the
ball, you have a really good chance at get
ting on base."
The Wildcats, who came into Friday's
contest sporting a Ruthian .357 team bat
ting average, looked every bit the offen
sive giants that they were billed to be.
Entering the series, Stanford ace
Willie Adams had pitched himself to two
consecutive complete game wins. In his
first five appearances, he had held oppos
ing batsmen to an anemic .168 batting

average.
Apparently, Arizona hadn't read
Adams' statistics. The Wildcats strung
together five-straight hits in the first
inning to take a 4-0 lead. They stretched
their lead to 10-6 in the fifth after Greg
Wells doubled down the third-base line
with the bases loaded and two outs.
But as has been the case so often in
this early season, the Cardinal bounced
back after receiving a seemingly insur
mountable blow. Madden and Todd
Laßocca opened the sixth with singles.
After leadoff hitter Cale Carter walked
to load the bases, A.J. Hinch greeted new
Arizona hurler Tim Singelyn with a triple
into the spacious gap in right-center field,
bringing Stanford within one.
Since returning to the Cardinal line-up
after a two-week absence, Hinch has been
on fire. The freshman catcher has dou
bled his batting average in the last four
games to a .333 clip, driving in 10 runs in
those contests alone.
Jed Hansen scored Hinch and tied the
score at 10 with a sacrifice fly.
After the Wildcats took a 12-10 lead in
the eighth, the Cardinal mustered its
final comeback. With one out, Laßocca
and Madden again laced consecutive sin
gles to left. The Cardinal No. 8 and 9 hit
ters combined for nine hits in the game.
With the bases loaded, Arizona short
stop Tony Bouie booted a Hinch
grounder, allowing two runs to score. A
Dusty Allen sacrifice fly gave Stanford its
first lead of the game, 13-12, entering the
bottom of the ninth.
Meanwhile, Adams had settled down
after a rough start, retiring the side in
order in the sixth and getting out of a
small jam in the seventh.
Despite giving up 10 earned runs and
15 hits, the junior righthander showed
why he is considered one of the best pitch
ers in the Six-Pac. Adams pitched eight
courageous innings, effectively with
standing the early-inning Wildcat bar
rage, and was in line for the win when
closer Matt Marenghi took the mound in
the ninth.
Arizona, however, proved to be capable
of a comeback of their own. With the
bases loaded, right fielder John Tejeck
drilled a one-out double to right-center,
ending the game.

Saturday's game was a repeat perfor
mance of the first. Down 7-4 in the fifth,
the Cardinal scored four unanswered
runs with home runs from Allen and
Madden and a Hinch single.
On the mound, Stanford lefty Andrew
Lorraine was no more successful than
Adams, allowing 10 earned runs and 13
hits in less than seven innings.
Again like Adams, Lorraine kept the
Cardinal in the ballgame. The junior
departed in the seventh with the score
tied at eight and two runners on base.
Relievers Todd Bartels and Mario Igle
sias, however, were unable to close the
door. Bartels squandered a bases-loaded
triple to pinch-hitter Rich Lemons. The
Wildcats made the score 13-8 when Jason
Thompson doubled to right field off of
Iglesias.
Yesterday's game was rained out, and

is rescheduled for today at 12 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time. Frosh Dan Reed takes
the mound for the Cardinal in the series
finale.
Stanford, in the midst of a three-game
losing streak, travels to Southern Califor
nia next weekend for another tough road
series, making today's matchup all the
more vital.
Not to worry, according to Madden.
"We've actually been playing pretty well,
despite the losses," the senior said. "I
really think we're a team that is capable
of coming back in any situation."

Willie Adams struggled Friday in the Cardinal's Six-Pac debut against Arizona, giving up 10 earned runs in eight Innings. The
Wildcats staved off a Stanford rally to prevail 14-13, and went on to win 13-8 on Saturday.
Arizona's mighty bats proved to be too
much for Stanford this weekend at Frank
Sancet Field in Tucson, Ariz.
The Cardinal put on its best two-game
offensive exhibition of the season, scoring
21 runs and pounding out 30 hits.
They scrapped and clawed their way
back to tie both games after falling
behind by four runs on Friday and three
on Saturday.
All Cardinal efforts were in vain, how
ever, as the No. 5 Wildcats (10-5) swept a
rain-shortened series from Stanford, 14-
13 and 13-8.

'We did a real good job of
swinging the bat in both
games. But the bottom
line is, we still lost.'
— Coach Mark Marquess

"I'm very proud of the way we battled
back," Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said, "and we did a real good job of swing
ing the bat in both games.
"But the bottom line is, we still lost."
If winning and losing is the bottom
line, then the No. 10 Cardinal (10-5), who
dropped to 0-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division for the first time
in six years, needs a win badly in today's
series-ender, to salvage an exciting yet
disappointing series.
"It's been really crazy out there," said
Stanford left fielder Shawn Madden. "If
you've been able to put the bat on the
ball, you have a really good chance at get
ting on base."
The Wildcats, who came into Friday's
contest sporting a Ruthian .357 team bat
ting average, looked every bit the offen
sive giants that they were billed to be.
Entering the series, Stanford ace
Willie Adams had pitched himself to two
consecutive complete game wins. In his
first five appearances, he had held oppos
ing batsmen to an anemic .168 batting

average.
Apparently, Arizona hadn't read
Adams' statistics. The Wildcats strung
together five-straight hits in the first
inning to take a 4-0 lead. They stretched
their lead to 10-6 in the fifth after Greg
Wells doubled down the third-base line
with the bases loaded and two outs.
But as has been the case so often in
this early season, the Cardinal bounced
back after receiving a seemingly insur
mountable blow. Madden and Todd
Laßocca opened the sixth with singles.
After leadoff hitter Cale Carter walked
to load the bases, A.J. Hinch greeted new
Arizona hurler Tim Singelyn with a triple
into the spacious gap in right-center field,
bringing Stanford within one.
Since returning to the Cardinal line-up
after a two-week absence, Hinch has been
on fire. The freshman catcher has dou
bled his batting average in the last four
games to a .333 clip, driving in 10 runs in
those contests alone.
Jed Hansen scored Hinch and tied the
score at 10 with a sacrifice fly.
After the Wildcats took a 12-10 lead in
the eighth, the Cardinal mustered its
final comeback. With one out, Laßocca
and Madden again laced consecutive sin
gles to left. The Cardinal No. 8 and 9 hit
ters combined for nine hits in the game.
With the bases loaded, Arizona short
stop Tony Bouie booted a Hinch
grounder, allowing two runs to score. A
Dusty Allen sacrifice fly gave Stanford its
first lead of the game, 13-12, entering the
bottom of the ninth.
Meanwhile, Adams had settled down
after a rough start, retiring the side in
order in the sixth and getting out of a
small jam in the seventh.
Despite giving up 10 earned runs and
15 hits, the junior righthander showed
why he is considered one of the best pitch
ers in the Six-Pac. Adams pitched eight
courageous innings, effectively with
standing the early-inning Wildcat bar
rage, and was in line for the win when
closer Matt Marenghi took the mound in
the ninth.
Arizona, however, proved to be capable
of a comeback of their own. With the
bases loaded, right fielder John Tejeck
drilled a one-out double to right-center,
ending the game.

Saturday's game was a repeat perfor
mance of the first. Down 7-4 in the fifth,
the Cardinal scored four unanswered
runs with home runs from Allen and
Madden and a Hinch single.
On the mound, Stanford lefty Andrew
Lorraine was no more successful than
Adams, allowing 10 earned runs and 13
hits in less than seven innings.
Again like Adams, Lorraine kept the
Cardinal in the ballgame. The junior
departed in the seventh with the score
tied at eight and two runners on base.
Relievers Todd Bartels and Mario Igle
sias, however, were unable to close the
door. Bartels squandered a bases-loaded
triple to pinch-hitter Rich Lemons. The
Wildcats made the score 13-8 when Jason
Thompson doubled to right field off of
Iglesias.
Yesterday's game was rained out, and

is rescheduled for today at 12 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time. Frosh Dan Reed takes
the mound for the Cardinal in the series
finale.
Stanford, in the midst of a three-game
losing streak, travels to Southern Califor
nia next weekend for another tough road
series, making today's matchup all the
more vital.
Not to worry, according to Madden.
"We've actually been playing pretty well,
despite the losses," the senior said. "I
really think we're a team that is capable
of coming back in any situation."
