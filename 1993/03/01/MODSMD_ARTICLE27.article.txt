# Gymnasts gain weekend split

When any team flubs 17 out of
36 routines, it probably can't
expect to come out with a victory
— even if that team is the defend
ing national champion.
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team's 17 routine misses on
Friday night resulted in a narrow
defeat at the hands of Brigham
Young, 281.25-281.70. The Cardi
nal managed to recover in time for
Saturday night's meet, however,
in which they downed UCLA,
281.85-275.80.
"We just had too many misses
over the weekend," said coach
Sadao Hamada. "Still, we only
lost by half a point on Friday and
we are doing better with our hard

er routines."
In front of a crowd of over
1,700 pro-Cougar spectators, the
12th-ranked Stanford squad suc
cumbed to the pressure, unable to
pull it together for a victory.
"Most of the first night we
were a little anxious," said junior
co-captain Mark Booth. "It was
hard to get the ball rolling."
Shaky performances on the
floor, rings and high bar left the
door open for BYU victories on
the three events. The Cardinal did
build a small bit of momentum
towards the end of the meet,
resulting in a win on the parallel
bars.
In the all-around competition,
Cougar sophomore Darren Elg
secured top honors with a total of
57.60. Cardinal senior Jair Lynch

finished second with 57.15.
Meet highlights, according to
Hamada, included senior Jeff
Bender's 9.70 high bar perfor
mance followed by Lynch's 9.75
display, a Stanford season best.
On the parallel bars, both Booth
and Bender turned in characteris
tically impressive routines, yet
they were topped by Lynch's 9.90
which secured the parallel bar
title.
"BYU was a great meet for us
to compete under a lot of pressure
both from the crowd and our
selves," Lynch said. "Unfortu
nately, we didn't deal with it very
well."
On Saturday night, the Cardi
nal returned home to pull off a
comfortable victory against the
Bruins. The win cost Stanford,
however, when sophomore all
around competitor Jing-Wei
Liang injured his ankle during a
vault landing.
"When Jing-Wei got hurt, I
think it had a psychological effect
on the team," Hamada said. "It
was a major factor in tonight's
meet — the guys tend to panic
when something like this hap
pens."
Unlike Friday's sluggish start,
Stanford began the UCLA meet in
full force. On its first three events
— floor, pommel horse and rings
— the team earned season-high
scores. After Liang's injury on the
vault, the Cardinal's scores
instantly dropped. The team's
totals on its final three events
were its lowest since the mid-sea
son break.
"The team showed a lot of
character in this meet, coming
back after losing last night to
BYU," said senior Shawn
Adamek. "We came out strong in
the beginning, but I think every
one got a little tired in the end."
Bruin standout Chainey
Umphrey earned first place in
the all-around competition with
56.20, followed closely by Booth
with 56.05 and Lynch with
55.95.
Sophomore Josh Stein turned
in impressive performances on
the floor and the pommel horse,
earning 9.80s in both events.
Hamada pointed out Adamek's
9.55 parallel bar win and Lynch's
9.85 high bar routine as positive
signs.
"When our first guy gets up on
the pommel horse like Josh did
and gets a 9.80, that tells us how
good we are and how good we can
be," Hamada said.
The team hopes to capitalize on
the weekend with a new knowl
edge of its strengths and weak
nesses.
"The team is improving, our
difficulty level is improving," said
junior Jason Cohen. "We just
have to work on consistency — if
we were to peak now, we would be
in trouble."


Curtis Chen — Dally
Jlng-Wei Liang scores a 9.70 on the pommel horse before suffering
an ankle Injury on vault. The Cardinal rebounded from a loss to BYU
on Friday to outscore UCLA 281.85-275.80 In Burnham Pavilion on
Saturday.
