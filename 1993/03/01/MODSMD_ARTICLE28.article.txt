# Netters assert supremacy over Bears in 5-2 victory
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
The California Bears were
good, but not good enough. The
Stanford men's tennis team
crushed their Bay Area rivals 5-
2 Saturday afternoon in Berke
ley.
Although the Bears lost their
big gun, Matt Lucena, to gradu
ation last spring, they are well
endowed this season with a hot
shot freshman, Casey Louie,
and several upperclassmen who
were unable to play last year.
The Cardinal men had little
trouble dealing with these new
threats, though. "We beat 'em
up pretty badly in singles," said
junior Rob Devens.
Coach Dick Gould agreed. "I
don't think we've ever beaten
Cal as decisively in singles and
first doubles, especially at Cal.
[Most of] our guys slammed the
door on . .. them.
"Our three tough matches
last week at [National Indoor
Championships] helped us going
into this match," Gould conti
nued. "It gave us an edge. I was
really, really pleased."
At first singles, Michael
Flanagan quickly disposed of
tough hitter Tom Phanco, 6-2,

6-3. Devens, a new face in the
second singles spot, showed lit
tle anxiety about his new posi
tion as he held serve throughout
the match and put away Bryan
Eagle, 6-2, 6-4.
"It was one of my best match
es of the year," Devens said. "I
was a little nervous about play
ing at No. 2 because Cal's a good
team, but it worked out."
Eagle, a transfer from San
Jose State who was ineligible to
play last year, defeated Devens
earlier in the season at the Rolex
Regional tournament.
Junior Vimal Patel chalked
up yet another point for the Car
dinal by defeating Anders Rolf
sen, 6-3, 6-0, at the No. 3 spot.
"Vimal has beaten Rolfsen
before but (Saturday) he just
killed him," Gould said.
At No. 4, junior Chris Coco
tos could not hang on to his lead
over David Kvaratskhelia, who
sat out last season with a wrist
injury. Gould described the 6-4,
3-6, 2-6 loss as "a real disap
pointment because Chris was
playing a routine match; he just
let it get away from him. He
couldn't raise his game and the
other guy did."
In the fifth spot, it was the
battle of the frosh. Stanford's

Jeff Salzenstein dominated his
match against Casey Louie, win
ning, 6-3, 6-3. At No. 6, junior
Billy Wright crushed Cal's Dan
Hiddleson, 6-2, 6-1.
In doubles action, Stanford's
first doubles team also proved
their might. Flanagan and Coco
tos easily handled Phanco and
Rolfsen 6-3, 6-1.
Cal received one of their two
team points by winning at sec
ond and third doubles. With
Stanford's Jim Thomas out for
the quarter with a stomach
muscle injury, Devens and
Salzenstein moved up to second
doubles, but lost, 6-4, 3-6, 5-7.
At third doubles, senior
Roman Sydorak, still recovering
from the flu, paired up with
freshman Ricky Becker for the
first time. "They've never played
together and it showed," Gould
said. Cal players Louie and Jason
Carmel won solidly, 6-4, 6-1.
Next on the Cardinal sched
ule is a home match tomorrow
afternoon at 1:30 p.m. against
the University of the Pacific.
Although Gould feels Pacific is
"maybe not quite as good as
Cal," the match should be a good
preparation for next weekend's
Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment in La Jolla, Calif.
