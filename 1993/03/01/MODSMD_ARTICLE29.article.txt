The No. 19 Stanford women's gymnastics team
walked into Arizona's McKale Center last Friday think
ing it had a good chance to upset two of the sport's best
teams. It was wrong.
The No. 5 Arizona Wildcats proved themselves to be
strong national-championship contenders as they won
the three-way meet with a score of 193.85. The Oregon
State Beavers, ranked fourth, finished second at 190.80.
Stanford took third with a mark of 189.25.
The meet featured many excellent individual perfor
mances, as six gymnasts finished with 38.00-plus all
around scores. Unfortunately for the Cardinal, four of
those marks were turned in by Wildcats.
Arizona All-American Stacy Fowlkes won the all
around with a school-record 39.50, including a perfect
10.00 on bars. Teammate Kristi Gunning also broke the
39.00 barrier with her 39.15.
Stanford head coach Breck Greenwood was
impressed.
"Stacy Fowlkes did a real 10.00 bar routine," he said,
"and Kristi Gunning is one of the most powerful gym
nasts around."
Arizona performed so well that only five gymnasts
competed on floor (out of six allowed), and the team still

scored 48.90 out of 50.00.
The only shining star for the Cardinal was the con
tinued improvement of freshman Hillary Anderson,
who finished third in the all-around with a career-high
38.85. Even though her 9.55 vault was her lowest indi
vidual score, it keyed her performance because it was
the first time she landed her new vault in competition.
"I felt like I really got my confidence on vault," she
said. "I really felt like I was going to do it."
"I wouldn't change a thing about her meet," Green
wood added.
Anderson's all-around score was the fifth-highest in
Stanford history; only teammate Jen 6 Elzie has ever
done better. Elzie welcomed the friendly intrateam
rivalry.
"I hope she pushes me and I push her," she said.
For the fourth-straight meet, the Cardinal had to
compete without Elzie in the all-around. The sopho
more Ail-American has been limited to just one event by
a strained Achilles tendon, but that injury didn't pre
vent her from doing her best bars routine of the year in
Arizona.
According to Elzie, her 9.85 "is kind of what I've
been working for all year. I haven't been happy with
bars â€” I haven't been doing as well as I could."
