# AIDS claiming lives on campus
## At least 50 deaths recorded to date 
### Clark Moore 
When he was eight years old,
English Prof. Arturo Islas was
stricken with polio, which forced
him to spend much of his child
hood in long physical therapy
sessions.
But Islas earned straight A's
in school and realized his dream
of winning an undergraduate
scholarship to Stanford. After
receiving a bachelor's and mas
ter's in education, Islas became
one of the first Chicanos in the
United States to receive a doc
torate in English.

While working on his disser
tation, Islas successfully battled
intestinal cancer. Upon complet
ing his education, he joined the
ranks of the Stanford faculty.
But on Feb. 15, 1991, Arturo
Islas died of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome at the age
of 52 — and his name joined a
long list of members of the Stan
ford community whose lives
have been taken by AIDS.
Due in part to the social stig
mas attached to AIDS, no one
knows exactly how many mem

bers of the faculty, staff and stu
dent body have been affected.
"I have heard that over 50
people at Stanford have devel
oped AIDS at some point, and I
believe that it may be an under
estimate because [the disease] is
often under-reported," said Car
ole Pertofsky, director of the
Cowell Student Health Promo
tion Program and chair of the
University's HIV/AIDS Task
Force.
"There are definitely current
members of the Stanford com
munity who are at some stage of
the disease," Pertofsky said.

"But even today, revealing your
HIV status is a very personal and
difficult choice that people have
to make."
But Islas did not hide the
cause of his death. "Before he
died, he called me and said, 'I
want you to know before I die
that what I have is AIDS,' " said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Cecilia Burciaga. "He wouldn't
shun talking about the disease
and what a curse it was.
"Arturo was strong in fight
ing AIDS. He was in the hospital
