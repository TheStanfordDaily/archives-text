# AIDS claiming lives on campus
## At least 50 deaths recorded to date 
### Clark Moore 
When he was eight years old,
English Prof. Arturo Islas was
stricken with polio, which forced
him to spend much of his child
hood in long physical therapy
sessions.
But Islas earned straight A's
in school and realized his dream
of winning an undergraduate
scholarship to Stanford. After
receiving a bachelor's and mas
ter's in education, Islas became
one of the first Chicanos in the
United States to receive a doc
torate in English.

First in a three-part series
While working on his disser
tation, Islas successfully battled
intestinal cancer. Upon complet
ing his education, he joined the
ranks of the Stanford faculty.
But on Feb. 15, 1991, Arturo
Islas died of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome at the age
of 52 — and his name joined a
long list of members of the Stan
ford community whose lives
have been taken by AIDS.
Due in part to the social stig
mas attached to AIDS, no one
knows exactly how many mem

bers of the faculty, staff and stu
dent body have been affected.
"I have heard that over 50
people at Stanford have devel
oped AIDS at some point, and I
believe that it may be an under
estimate because [the disease] is
often under-reported," said Car
ole Pertofsky, director of the
Cowell Student Health Promo
tion Program and chair of the
University's HIV/AIDS Task
Force.
"There are definitely current
members of the Stanford com
munity who are at some stage of
the disease," Pertofsky said.

"But even today, revealing your
HIV status is a very personal and
difficult choice that people have
to make."
But Islas did not hide the
cause of his death. "Before he
died, he called me and said, 'I
want you to know before I die
that what I have is AIDS,' " said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Cecilia Burciaga. "He wouldn't
shun talking about the disease
and what a curse it was.
"Arturo was strong in fight
ing AIDS. He was in the hospital



Dan Kim — Daily
for two years and dropped down to
about 70 pounds before he died,"
she said. "Even when he was
deathly ill with pneumonia ... he
was inner-centered and outer
directed."
Far-reaching impact
In a videotaped 1988 ceremony
held to remember 26 people at
Stanford who had died of AIDS, 10
of whom remain anonymous, for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy said, "We cherish those
people. We cherish what they gave
us in their lives here... we cannot
forget these people."
Behind Kennedy hung several
panels of the Names Project quilt,
which commemorates those who
have died from AIDS. Among the
panels was one dedicated specifi
cally to those lost from the Stan
ford community.
Two English professors, a coun
selor at the Career Planning and
Placement Center, a classics pro
fessor and a doctoral student in
education are just a few of the
many students, staff, faculty and
alumni that have already died
from AIDS.
And AIDS continues to take
lives at Stanford. "So many in the
Stanford community have died
that I eventually stopped count
ing. It was just too depressing,"
said Asst. Dean of Continuing
Studies Andrew Lisac.
Most staff members know of at
least one person who has died from
AIDS. However, despite the abun
dance of AIDS pamphlets and con
doms at Stanford, many students
are unaware of the full impact of
AIDS on campus— partly because
students typically spend only four
years here.
Pertofsky said that many stu
dents remain relatively uncon
cerned about the epidemic. "The
truth is that we are all 'living with
AIDS' because the epidemic has
had such a terrible impact on our
community," she said.
However, she added that condi
tions are beginning to change due
to increased interest in classes,
counseling and outreach pro
grams.
For example, as part of a project

for an AIDS education class,
sophomore Chris Levinson is
heading an effort to sew an updat
ed quilt panel for those lost from
the Stanford community.
"It is vital that we all under
stand that the AIDS epidemic has

had and contin
ues to have a far
reaching impact
on many facets of
our community,"
she said. "We are
hoping that the
quilt panel we
sew this week will
be a fitting trib
ute to the won
derful people at

Stanford that we have lost."
The quilt will pay tribute to
people like Islas, whose work still
influences members of the Chi
cano/Latino community today.
"Arturo's contributions to the
Chicano community continue to
bear fruit," said Burciaga, who is
also a resident fellow at Casa Zap
ata. "Many Chicano alums cite
him as the only reason they stayed
at Stanford. He was their academ
ic role model."
Islas was known among stu
dents as a dynamic teacher of
American literature. His passion
for teaching was recognized in
1976 with a Dinkelspiel award for
his contribution to undergraduate
education.
In addition to teaching, Islas
wrote two novels which examined
the Chicano experience. According
to English Prof. Nancy Packer,
Islas had planned for these two
books to be part of a trilogy.
Junior Lazaro Cuevas, who
studied Islas' work in an English
class, said "The first two novels
are very powerful, especially as
they relate to the Chicano experi
ence. It's a tragedy that Islas could
not complete the final book. ... He
still had ideas to convey and stories
to resolve."
A 'high profile' on campus
"If you wanted to have lunch
with (James Patterson|, you would
have to plan for your lunch to be
interrupted a half dozen times by
students, parents and faculty who
would want to greet him," said
Judith Little, an associate director
in the Office of Development.
"He had a fairly high profile on

campus," added Little. "It was
important to James that he make a
difference in the community
where he worked."
When Patterson died of AIDS at
age 40 in March 1991, the Universi
ty lost both a popular engineering

counselor at the
Career Planning
and Placement
Center and a lead
er of the campus
African-American
community.
Clare Phillips,
associate director
of the Multicul
tural Develop
ment Office, said

that Patterson "really got things
going in the African-American com
munity at Stanford." He served as
an adviser to Omega Psi Phi, an
African-American fraternity, and
was a member of the policy board of
the Black Community Services
Center.
"James was particularly inter
ested in supporting traditional
African-American male values and
teaching black males to have
respect for themselves and oth
ers," said Michael Britt, an associ
ate director in the Office of Devel
opment. "To lose him to this
dreadful disease was tragic."
Little recalls that coping with
Patterson's early death was diffi
cult for many at Stanford. "His
death touched an inordinate
amount of people here," she
recalls. "It was a very trying and
moving experience, in great part
because we recognized the poten
tial loss to the University."
'He touched everybody'
When more than 30 students,
faculty and staff attended a memo
rial service for education doctoral
student and Freshman English
instructor Arthur Hall, they
mourned the loss of a devoted
teacher and friend.
He "really cared about you as
an individual. ... He shared so
much of himself to make you feel
better," recalled Hall's former stu
dent Chayo Ureno during the ser
vice, according to a Daily report.
AIDS ended Hall's teaching
career on Jan. 3, 1992 at age 43.
"No matter how much I may
crab in certain moods about the
low pay . . . the never-ending

stacks of papers, the annoyance
of coming across the phrase 'in
this fast-moving world of today'
for the 189 th time in the con
cluding sentence of a student
essay, there's something about
teaching that attracts me and
brings me back with renewed
enthusiasm every September,
no matter how burned out I
may have felt in June," wrote
Hall in his doctoral admissions
essay, a portion of which was
printed by Campus Report just
after his death.
Hall was a strong role model for
others facing AIDS. Catherine
O'Connor, former degree program
coordinator for the School of Edu
cation, said that Hall was "upbeat
and very positive," even as he
became sick from AIDS.
"I have a sister-in-law with
AIDS, and when I told Arthur
about her, he called to give her
advice. They would talk about
treatments, and how to cope with
the disease," said O'Connor.
"Whenever she was lonely, she
would call him and he would cheer
her up.
"He was an inspiration, and he
gave something to everyone, even
as he was dying," she said.
According to Michele Marin
covich, who worked with Hall at
the Center for Teaching and
Learning, Hall was determined to
continue teaching as long as possi
ble.
"In his last quarter here,
Arthur became visibly much sick
er and seemed weak, but he was
absolutely adamant about contin
uing his work with students,"
Marincovich recalled. "By sheer
willpower, he made it through to
the last day of class and was
admitted to the hospital the very
next day. He passed away just one
month later."
'I still hear his voice'
English Dept. Chair Ronald
Rebholz and Prof. Adrienne Rich
remember the late English Prof.
Donald Howard, a noted Chauceri
an scholar, by hosting an annual
dinner in his honor.
"Don was an astounding teach
er, a spellbinder," said Rebholz,
who was a close friend of Howard.
"He was also a splendid eccentric
as a human being."
At the time of his 1987 AlDS

related death, 59-year old Howard
was one of the world's leading
Chaucerian scholars. While at Stan
ford, he accrued many prestigious
awards for his research on medieval
history and literature; he also
taught classes for all levels of stu
dents — from introductory English
classes to graduate seminars.
A member of the Stanford fac
ulty since 1977, Howard's final
scholarly project was a literary
biography of Chaucer. "One Sun
day morning, I decided that a biog
raphy of Chaucer could be writ
ten," Howard said in a 1980 inter
view with the Campus Report,
"And I sat down and wrote the
first sentence."
Seven years later, when he had
nearly completed the biography,
Howard fainted in his San Fran
cisco apartment. "That was the
first sign that he had AIDS," said
Rebholz. "He soon became very
sick."
"Don saw the book in the
proofreading stage, but not in the
final stage, which is a pity," he
said. "That book is now consid
ered one of the finest books ever
written on Chaucer."
Days before Howard's death,
former graduate students Tom
Moser Jr. and Steve Kruger
stepped in to complete the foot-

notes for Prof. Howard's book.
In a letter read at the 1988
Stanford AIDS memorial ser
vice, Moser wrote that it was an
honor to work with "one of this
century's most profound and
sympathetic readers of Chaucer
and of all Medieval literature."
At the service, Kruger said that
Howard had a lasting impact on
his personal and academic life. "I
still hear his voice, asking me to
explain myself, challenging me to
write powerfully and persuasively
as he always did. And sometimes, I
hope, I hear something of Don's
voice in my own."

Activist and scholar
Five months after his friend
Don Howard died in 1987, Classics
Prof. John "Jack" Winkler learned
that he, too, had AIDS. Winkler
soon went public with his diagno
sis.
Winkler told The Daily in 1988
that seeing Howard die inspired
him to be open about having AIDS.
"Everyone at (Howard's) memori
al service felt so sorry that they
couldn't say 'goodbye' to him," he
said. "Everyone who wants to will
have the chance to say what they
need to me."
A professor since 1979, Win
kler also stressed the impor
tance of not seeing AIDS "as a
plague or taboo" that only
affects gay men.
Winkler told Campus Report in
1985 that being an openly gay edu
cator and writer "is part of my
public persona, the definition of
who I am." Much of Winkler's
work explored issues of sexuality
in Classical texts.
Kathy Veit, a former student of
Winkler's, says that both his schol
arship and teaching style had an
important impact on students.
"He inspired a lot of graduate stu
dents to buck the conservative
trend in the Classics department,"
she said. "He really encouraged us
to connect our work in Classics to
our own lives."
Winkler remained committed to
his writing up until he died. Lisac,
a friend and colleague of Win
kler's, said, "Jack was invigorated
by his HIV status, because it
heightened his awareness of how
precious life is. His output just
before his death was incredible —
he wrote up until the day he died."
In a 1988 interview, Winkler
told The Daily that "there's noth
ing like the thought of death to
make you sit down and do the
things you want to do."
Lisac expressed hope that fac
ulty and staff who have died
from AIDS will not be forgotten.
"The people that our communi
ty has lost to AIDS, like Jack
Winkler, have been some of the
most special people in the Uni
versity" he said. "I hope that
efforts like AIDS Awareness
Week will help us to rediscover
these individuals and their con
tributions to Stanford."

said Asst. Dean of Continuing
Studies Andrew Lisac.
Most staff members know of at
least one person who has died from
AIDS. However, despite the abun
dance of AIDS pamphlets and con
doms at Stanford, many students
are unaware of the full impact of
AIDS on campus— partly because
students typically spend only four
years here.
Pertofsky said that many stu
dents remain relatively uncon
cerned about the epidemic. "The
truth is that we are all 'living with
AIDS' because the epidemic has
had such a terrible impact on our
community," she said.
However, she added that condi
tions are beginning to change due
to increased interest in classes,
counseling and outreach pro
grams.
For example, as part of a project

for an AIDS education class,
sophomore Chris Levinson is
heading an effort to sew an updat
ed quilt panel for those lost from
the Stanford community.
"It is vital that we all under
stand that the AIDS epidemic has

had and contin
ues to have a far
reaching impact
on many facets of
our community,"
she said. "We are
hoping that the
quilt panel we
sew this week will
be a fitting trib
ute to the won
derful people at

Stanford that we have lost."
The quilt will pay tribute to
people like Islas, whose work still
influences members of the Chi
cano/Latino community today.
"Arturo's contributions to the
Chicano community continue to
bear fruit," said Burciaga, who is
also a resident fellow at Casa Zap
ata. "Many Chicano alums cite
him as the only reason they stayed
at Stanford. He was their academ
ic role model."
Islas was known among stu
dents as a dynamic teacher of
American literature. His passion
for teaching was recognized in
1976 with a Dinkelspiel award for
his contribution to undergraduate
education.
In addition to teaching, Islas
wrote two novels which examined
the Chicano experience. According
to English Prof. Nancy Packer,
Islas had planned for these two
books to be part of a trilogy.
Junior Lazaro Cuevas, who
studied Islas' work in an English
class, said "The first two novels
are very powerful, especially as
they relate to the Chicano experi
ence. It's a tragedy that Islas could
not complete the final book. ... He
still had ideas to convey and stories
to resolve."
A 'high profile' on campus
"If you wanted to have lunch
with (James Patterson|, you would
have to plan for your lunch to be
interrupted a half dozen times by
students, parents and faculty who
would want to greet him," said
Judith Little, an associate director
in the Office of Development.
"He had a fairly high profile on

campus," added Little. "It was
important to James that he make a
difference in the community
where he worked."
When Patterson died of AIDS at
age 40 in March 1991, the Universi
ty lost both a popular engineering

counselor at the
Career Planning
and Placement
Center and a lead
er of the campus
African-American
community.
Clare Phillips,
associate director
of the Multicul
tural Develop
ment Office, said

that Patterson "really got things
going in the African-American com
munity at Stanford." He served as
an adviser to Omega Psi Phi, an
African-American fraternity, and
was a member of the policy board of
the Black Community Services
Center.
"James was particularly inter
ested in supporting traditional
African-American male values and
teaching black males to have
respect for themselves and oth
ers," said Michael Britt, an associ
ate director in the Office of Devel
opment. "To lose him to this
dreadful disease was tragic."
Little recalls that coping with
Patterson's early death was diffi
cult for many at Stanford. "His
death touched an inordinate
amount of people here," she
recalls. "It was a very trying and
moving experience, in great part
because we recognized the poten
tial loss to the University."
'He touched everybody'
When more than 30 students,
faculty and staff attended a memo
rial service for education doctoral
student and Freshman English
instructor Arthur Hall, they
mourned the loss of a devoted
teacher and friend.
He "really cared about you as
an individual. ... He shared so
much of himself to make you feel
better," recalled Hall's former stu
dent Chayo Ureno during the ser
vice, according to a Daily report.
AIDS ended Hall's teaching
career on Jan. 3, 1992 at age 43.
"No matter how much I may
crab in certain moods about the
low pay . . . the never-ending

stacks of papers, the annoyance
of coming across the phrase 'in
this fast-moving world of today'
for the 189 th time in the con
cluding sentence of a student
essay, there's something about
teaching that attracts me and
brings me back with renewed
enthusiasm every September,
no matter how burned out I
may have felt in June," wrote
Hall in his doctoral admissions
essay, a portion of which was
printed by Campus Report just
after his death.
Hall was a strong role model for
others facing AIDS. Catherine
O'Connor, former degree program
coordinator for the School of Edu
cation, said that Hall was "upbeat
and very positive," even as he
became sick from AIDS.
"I have a sister-in-law with
AIDS, and when I told Arthur
about her, he called to give her
advice. They would talk about
treatments, and how to cope with
the disease," said O'Connor.
"Whenever she was lonely, she
would call him and he would cheer
her up.
"He was an inspiration, and he
gave something to everyone, even
as he was dying," she said.
According to Michele Marin
covich, who worked with Hall at
the Center for Teaching and
Learning, Hall was determined to
continue teaching as long as possi
ble.
"In his last quarter here,
Arthur became visibly much sick
er and seemed weak, but he was
absolutely adamant about contin
uing his work with students,"
Marincovich recalled. "By sheer
willpower, he made it through to
the last day of class and was
admitted to the hospital the very
next day. He passed away just one
month later."
'I still hear his voice'
English Dept. Chair Ronald
Rebholz and Prof. Adrienne Rich
remember the late English Prof.
Donald Howard, a noted Chauceri
an scholar, by hosting an annual
dinner in his honor.
"Don was an astounding teach
er, a spellbinder," said Rebholz,
who was a close friend of Howard.
"He was also a splendid eccentric
as a human being."
At the time of his 1987 AlDS

related death, 59-year old Howard
was one of the world's leading
Chaucerian scholars. While at Stan
ford, he accrued many prestigious
awards for his research on medieval
history and literature; he also
taught classes for all levels of stu
dents — from introductory English
classes to graduate seminars.
A member of the Stanford fac
ulty since 1977, Howard's final
scholarly project was a literary
biography of Chaucer. "One Sun
day morning, I decided that a biog
raphy of Chaucer could be writ
ten," Howard said in a 1980 inter
view with the Campus Report,
"And I sat down and wrote the
first sentence."
Seven years later, when he had
nearly completed the biography,
Howard fainted in his San Fran
cisco apartment. "That was the
first sign that he had AIDS," said
Rebholz. "He soon became very
sick."
"Don saw the book in the
proofreading stage, but not in the
final stage, which is a pity," he
said. "That book is now consid
ered one of the finest books ever
written on Chaucer."
Days before Howard's death,
former graduate students Tom
Moser Jr. and Steve Kruger
stepped in to complete the foot-

notes for Prof. Howard's book.
In a letter read at the 1988
Stanford AIDS memorial ser
vice, Moser wrote that it was an
honor to work with "one of this
century's most profound and
sympathetic readers of Chaucer
and of all Medieval literature."
At the service, Kruger said that
Howard had a lasting impact on
his personal and academic life. "I
still hear his voice, asking me to
explain myself, challenging me to
write powerfully and persuasively
as he always did. And sometimes, I
hope, I hear something of Don's
voice in my own."

Activist and scholar
Five months after his friend
Don Howard died in 1987, Classics
Prof. John "Jack" Winkler learned
that he, too, had AIDS. Winkler
soon went public with his diagno
sis.
Winkler told The Daily in 1988
that seeing Howard die inspired
him to be open about having AIDS.
"Everyone at (Howard's) memori
al service felt so sorry that they
couldn't say 'goodbye' to him," he
said. "Everyone who wants to will
have the chance to say what they
need to me."
A professor since 1979, Win
kler also stressed the impor
tance of not seeing AIDS "as a
plague or taboo" that only
affects gay men.
Winkler told Campus Report in
1985 that being an openly gay edu
cator and writer "is part of my
public persona, the definition of
who I am." Much of Winkler's
work explored issues of sexuality
in Classical texts.
Kathy Veit, a former student of
Winkler's, says that both his schol
arship and teaching style had an
important impact on students.
"He inspired a lot of graduate stu
dents to buck the conservative
trend in the Classics department,"
she said. "He really encouraged us
to connect our work in Classics to
our own lives."
Winkler remained committed to
his writing up until he died. Lisac,
a friend and colleague of Win
kler's, said, "Jack was invigorated
by his HIV status, because it
heightened his awareness of how
precious life is. His output just
before his death was incredible —
he wrote up until the day he died."
In a 1988 interview, Winkler
told The Daily that "there's noth
ing like the thought of death to
make you sit down and do the
things you want to do."
Lisac expressed hope that fac
ulty and staff who have died
from AIDS will not be forgotten.
"The people that our communi
ty has lost to AIDS, like Jack
Winkler, have been some of the
most special people in the Uni
versity" he said. "I hope that
efforts like AIDS Awareness
Week will help us to rediscover
these individuals and their con
tributions to Stanford."


Islas


Patterson


Howard


Winkler
When he was eight years old,
English Prof. Arturo Islas was
stricken with polio, which forced
him to spend much of his child
hood in long physical therapy
sessions.
But Islas earned straight A's
in school and realized his dream
of winning an undergraduate
scholarship to Stanford. After
receiving a bachelor's and mas
ter's in education, Islas became
one of the first Chicanos in the
United States to receive a doc
torate in English.

First in a three-part series
While working on his disser
tation, Islas successfully battled
intestinal cancer. Upon complet
ing his education, he joined the
ranks of the Stanford faculty.
But on Feb. 15, 1991, Arturo
Islas died of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome at the age
of 52 — and his name joined a
long list of members of the Stan
ford community whose lives
have been taken by AIDS.
Due in part to the social stig
mas attached to AIDS, no one
knows exactly how many mem

bers of the faculty, staff and stu
dent body have been affected.
"I have heard that over 50
people at Stanford have devel
oped AIDS at some point, and I
believe that it may be an under
estimate because [the disease] is
often under-reported," said Car
ole Pertofsky, director of the
Cowell Student Health Promo
tion Program and chair of the
University's HIV/AIDS Task
Force.
"There are definitely current
members of the Stanford com
munity who are at some stage of
the disease," Pertofsky said.

"But even today, revealing your
HIV status is a very personal and
difficult choice that people have
to make."
But Islas did not hide the
cause of his death. "Before he
died, he called me and said, 'I
want you to know before I die
that what I have is AIDS,' " said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Cecilia Burciaga. "He wouldn't
shun talking about the disease
and what a curse it was.
"Arturo was strong in fight
ing AIDS. He was in the hospital



Dan Kim — Daily
for two years and dropped down to
about 70 pounds before he died,"
she said. "Even when he was
deathly ill with pneumonia ... he
was inner-centered and outer
directed."
Far-reaching impact
In a videotaped 1988 ceremony
held to remember 26 people at
Stanford who had died of AIDS, 10
of whom remain anonymous, for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy said, "We cherish those
people. We cherish what they gave
us in their lives here... we cannot
forget these people."
Behind Kennedy hung several
panels of the Names Project quilt,
which commemorates those who
have died from AIDS. Among the
panels was one dedicated specifi
cally to those lost from the Stan
ford community.
Two English professors, a coun
selor at the Career Planning and
Placement Center, a classics pro
fessor and a doctoral student in
education are just a few of the
many students, staff, faculty and
alumni that have already died
from AIDS.
And AIDS continues to take
lives at Stanford. "So many in the
Stanford community have died
that I eventually stopped count
ing. It was just too depressing,"
said Asst. Dean of Continuing

an adviser to Omega Psi Phi, an
African-American fraternity, and
was a member of the policy board of
the Black Community Services
Center.
"James was particularly inter
ested in supporting traditional
African-American male values and
teaching black males to have
respect for themselves and oth
ers," said Michael Britt, an associ
ate director in the Office of Devel
opment. "To lose him to this
dreadful disease was tragic."
Little recalls that coping with
Patterson's early death was diffi
cult for many at Stanford. "His
death touched an inordinate
amount of people here," she
recalls. "It was a very trying and
moving experience, in great part
because we recognized the poten
tial loss to the University."
'He touched everybody'
When more than 30 students,
faculty and staff attended a memo
rial service for education doctoral
student and Freshman English
instructor Arthur Hall, they
mourned the loss of a devoted
teacher and friend.
He "really cared about you as
an individual. ... He shared so
much of himself to make you feel
better," recalled Hall's former stu
dent Chayo Ureno during the ser
vice, according to a Daily report.
AIDS ended Hall's teaching
career on Jan. 3, 1992 at age 43.
"No matter how much I may
crab in certain moods about the
low pay . . . the never-ending

stacks of papers, the annoyance
of coming across the phrase 'in
this fast-moving world of today'
for the 189 th time in the con
cluding sentence of a student
essay, there's something about
teaching that attracts me and
brings me back with renewed
enthusiasm every September,
no matter how burned out I
may have felt in June," wrote
Hall in his doctoral admissions
essay, a portion of which was
printed by Campus Report just
after his death.
Hall was a strong role model for
others facing AIDS. Catherine
O'Connor, former degree program
coordinator for the School of Edu
cation, said that Hall was "upbeat
and very positive," even as he
became sick from AIDS.
"I have a sister-in-law with
AIDS, and when I told Arthur
about her, he called to give her
advice. They would talk about
treatments, and how to cope with
the disease," said O'Connor.
"Whenever she was lonely, she
would call him and he would cheer
her up.
"He was an inspiration, and he
gave something to everyone, even
as he was dying," she said.
According to Michele Marin
covich, who worked with Hall at
the Center for Teaching and
Learning, Hall was determined to
continue teaching as long as possi
ble.
"In his last quarter here,
Arthur became visibly much sick
er and seemed weak, but he was
absolutely adamant about contin
uing his work with students,"
Marincovich recalled. "By sheer
willpower, he made it through to
the last day of class and was
admitted to the hospital the very
next day. He passed away just one
month later."
'I still hear his voice'
English Dept. Chair Ronald
Rebholz and Prof. Adrienne Rich
remember the late English Prof.
Donald Howard, a noted Chauceri
an scholar, by hosting an annual
dinner in his honor.
"Don was an astounding teach
er, a spellbinder," said Rebholz,
who was a close friend of Howard.
"He was also a splendid eccentric
as a human being."
At the time of his 1987 AlDS

related death, 59-year old Howard
was one of the world's leading
Chaucerian scholars. While at Stan
ford, he accrued many prestigious
awards for his research on medieval
history and literature; he also
taught classes for all levels of stu
dents — from introductory English
classes to graduate seminars.
A member of the Stanford fac
ulty since 1977, Howard's final
scholarly project was a literary
biography of Chaucer. "One Sun
day morning, I decided that a biog
raphy of Chaucer could be writ
ten," Howard said in a 1980 inter
view with the Campus Report,
"And I sat down and wrote the
first sentence."
Seven years later, when he had
nearly completed the biography,
Howard fainted in his San Fran
cisco apartment. "That was the
first sign that he had AIDS," said
Rebholz. "He soon became very
sick."
"Don saw the book in the
proofreading stage, but not in the
final stage, which is a pity," he
said. "That book is now consid
ered one of the finest books ever
written on Chaucer."
Days before Howard's death,
former graduate students Tom
Moser Jr. and Steve Kruger
stepped in to complete the foot-

notes for Prof. Howard's book.
In a letter read at the 1988
Stanford AIDS memorial ser
vice, Moser wrote that it was an
honor to work with "one of this
century's most profound and
sympathetic readers of Chaucer
and of all Medieval literature."
At the service, Kruger said that
Howard had a lasting impact on
his personal and academic life. "I
still hear his voice, asking me to
explain myself, challenging me to
write powerfully and persuasively
as he always did. And sometimes, I
hope, I hear something of Don's
voice in my own."

Activist and scholar
Five months after his friend
Don Howard died in 1987, Classics
Prof. John "Jack" Winkler learned
that he, too, had AIDS. Winkler
soon went public with his diagno
sis.
Winkler told The Daily in 1988
that seeing Howard die inspired
him to be open about having AIDS.
"Everyone at (Howard's) memori
al service felt so sorry that they
couldn't say 'goodbye' to him," he
said. "Everyone who wants to will
have the chance to say what they
need to me."
A professor since 1979, Win
kler also stressed the impor
tance of not seeing AIDS "as a
plague or taboo" that only
affects gay men.
Winkler told Campus Report in
1985 that being an openly gay edu
cator and writer "is part of my
public persona, the definition of
who I am." Much of Winkler's
work explored issues of sexuality
in Classical texts.
Kathy Veit, a former student of
Winkler's, says that both his schol
arship and teaching style had an
important impact on students.
"He inspired a lot of graduate stu
dents to buck the conservative
trend in the Classics department,"
she said. "He really encouraged us
to connect our work in Classics to
our own lives."
Winkler remained committed to
his writing up until he died. Lisac,
a friend and colleague of Win
kler's, said, "Jack was invigorated
by his HIV status, because it
heightened his awareness of how
precious life is. His output just
before his death was incredible —
he wrote up until the day he died."
In a 1988 interview, Winkler
told The Daily that "there's noth
ing like the thought of death to
make you sit down and do the
things you want to do."
Lisac expressed hope that fac
ulty and staff who have died
from AIDS will not be forgotten.
"The people that our communi
ty has lost to AIDS, like Jack
Winkler, have been some of the
most special people in the Uni
versity" he said. "I hope that
efforts like AIDS Awareness
Week will help us to rediscover
these individuals and their con
tributions to Stanford."


Islas


Patterson


Howard


Winkler
When he was eight years old,
English Prof. Arturo Islas was
stricken with polio, which forced
him to spend much of his child
hood in long physical therapy
sessions.
But Islas earned straight A's
in school and realized his dream
of winning an undergraduate
scholarship to Stanford. After
receiving a bachelor's and mas
ter's in education, Islas became
one of the first Chicanos in the
United States to receive a doc
torate in English.

First in a three-part series
While working on his disser
tation, Islas successfully battled
intestinal cancer. Upon complet
ing his education, he joined the
ranks of the Stanford faculty.
But on Feb. 15, 1991, Arturo
Islas died of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome at the age
of 52 — and his name joined a
long list of members of the Stan
ford community whose lives
have been taken by AIDS.
Due in part to the social stig
mas attached to AIDS, no one
knows exactly how many mem

bers of the faculty, staff and stu
dent body have been affected.
"I have heard that over 50
people at Stanford have devel
oped AIDS at some point, and I
believe that it may be an under
estimate because [the disease] is
often under-reported," said Car
ole Pertofsky, director of the
Cowell Student Health Promo
tion Program and chair of the
University's HIV/AIDS Task
Force.
"There are definitely current
members of the Stanford com
munity who are at some stage of
the disease," Pertofsky said.

"But even today, revealing your
HIV status is a very personal and
difficult choice that people have
to make."
But Islas did not hide the
cause of his death. "Before he
died, he called me and said, 'I
want you to know before I die
that what I have is AIDS,' " said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Cecilia Burciaga. "He wouldn't
shun talking about the disease
and what a curse it was.
"Arturo was strong in fight
ing AIDS. He was in the hospital



Dan Kim — Daily
for two years and dropped down to
about 70 pounds before he died,"
she said. "Even when he was
deathly ill with pneumonia ... he
was inner-centered and outer
directed."
Far-reaching impact
In a videotaped 1988 ceremony
held to remember 26 people at
Stanford who had died of AIDS, 10
of whom remain anonymous, for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy said, "We cherish those
people. We cherish what they gave
us in their lives here... we cannot
forget these people."
Behind Kennedy hung several
panels of the Names Project quilt,
which commemorates those who
have died from AIDS. Among the
panels was one dedicated specifi
cally to those lost from the Stan
ford community.
Two English professors, a coun
selor at the Career Planning and
Placement Center, a classics pro
fessor and a doctoral student in
education are just a few of the
many students, staff, faculty and
alumni that have already died
from AIDS.
And AIDS continues to take
lives at Stanford. "So many in the
Stanford community have died
that I eventually stopped count
ing. It was just too depressing,"
said Asst. Dean of Continuing
Studies Andrew Lisac.
Most staff members know of at
least one person who has died from
AIDS. However, despite the abun
dance of AIDS pamphlets and con
doms at Stanford, many students
are unaware of the full impact of
AIDS on campus— partly because
students typically spend only four
years here.
Pertofsky said that many stu
dents remain relatively uncon
cerned about the epidemic. "The
truth is that we are all 'living with
AIDS' because the epidemic has
had such a terrible impact on our
community," she said.
However, she added that condi
tions are beginning to change due
to increased interest in classes,
counseling and outreach pro
grams.
For example, as part of a project

for an AIDS education class,
sophomore Chris Levinson is
heading an effort to sew an updat
ed quilt panel for those lost from
the Stanford community.
"It is vital that we all under
stand that the AIDS epidemic has

had and contin
ues to have a far
reaching impact
on many facets of
our community,"
she said. "We are
hoping that the
quilt panel we
sew this week will
be a fitting trib
ute to the won
derful people at

Stanford that we have lost."
The quilt will pay tribute to
people like Islas, whose work still
influences members of the Chi
cano/Latino community today.
"Arturo's contributions to the
Chicano community continue to
bear fruit," said Burciaga, who is
also a resident fellow at Casa Zap
ata. "Many Chicano alums cite
him as the only reason they stayed
at Stanford. He was their academ
ic role model."
Islas was known among stu
dents as a dynamic teacher of
American literature. His passion
for teaching was recognized in
1976 with a Dinkelspiel award for
his contribution to undergraduate
education.
In addition to teaching, Islas
wrote two novels which examined
the Chicano experience. According
to English Prof. Nancy Packer,
Islas had planned for these two
books to be part of a trilogy.
Junior Lazaro Cuevas, who
studied Islas' work in an English
class, said "The first two novels
are very powerful, especially as
they relate to the Chicano experi
ence. It's a tragedy that Islas could
not complete the final book. ... He
still had ideas to convey and stories
to resolve."
A 'high profile' on campus
"If you wanted to have lunch
with (James Patterson|, you would
have to plan for your lunch to be
interrupted a half dozen times by
students, parents and faculty who
would want to greet him," said
Judith Little, an associate director
in the Office of Development.
"He had a fairly high profile on

campus," added Little. "It was
important to James that he make a
difference in the community
where he worked."
When Patterson died of AIDS at
age 40 in March 1991, the Universi
ty lost both a popular engineering

counselor at the
Career Planning
and Placement
Center and a lead
er of the campus
African-American
community.
Clare Phillips,
associate director
of the Multicul
tural Develop
ment Office, said

that Patterson "really got things
going in the African-American com
munity at Stanford." He served as
an adviser to Omega Psi Phi, an
African-American fraternity, and
was a member of the policy board of
the Black Community Services
Center.
"James was particularly inter
ested in supporting traditional
African-American male values and
teaching black males to have
respect for themselves and oth
ers," said Michael Britt, an associ
