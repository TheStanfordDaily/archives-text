# Cardinal stuns Gators to claim indoor crown
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
On May 21, 1992, Florida finally broke
the Stanford women's tennis dynasty to win
its first-ever NCAA Championship, ending
the Cardinal's six-year hold on the title.
Yesterday afternoon, it was payback
time.
The No. 2 Cardinal (12-0, 4-0 Pacific 10
Conference) handed No. 1 Florida (5-1) its
first loss in over a year, snapping a 35-match
Gator winning streak while capturing the
USTA/ITA Women's National Indoor Team
Championship in convincing fashion. Stan
ford had no problem subduing the nation's
former top team, taking five out of six sin
gles matches to clinch the team title. •
Unfortunately, things didn't start so well
for the Cardinal. No. 1 Laxmi Poruri, after win
ning every one of her previous matches in the
tournament in straight sets, fell to the Gators'
Lisa Raymond, 6-4, 6-4. Raymond is currently
ranked No. 76 in the world, and had an easy
time polishing off the ITA No. 2 Poruri.
After that, however, it was all Stanford.
No. 2 Heather Willens, coming off a
marathon match against Georgia's Stacy
Sheppard in the previous round, stopped
Florida's Andrea Farley at 4-1 into the first
set when Farley retired from the match due
to injury. Sophomore Kim Shasby also had
little trouble in her No. 3 match, steam
rolling to the upset win over ITA No. 6 Jill
Brenner, 6-1, 6-0.
Junior Kristine Kurth rebounded from
her semifinal loss to Georgia's Tina Samara
to win a three-setter in her No. 4 match
against the Gators' Erika Kuttler, 4-6, 6-0,
6-4, while No. 5 Beth Berris survived a sim

ilar scare against Florida's Kristin Osmond,
winning 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Sophomore Amy Chiminello wrapped up
the win for Stanford in the No. 6 singles
position, downing Stacy Moss by a 6-1, 6-2
score.
Stanford reached the final match with 6-0
wins against Virginia and No. 5 UCLA in the
first two rounds, then with a 5-1 win against
No. 7 Georgia in the semifinal round.
The Cardinal clinched its third team title
in six years by defeating defending national
champion Florida, which owns the other
three team titles. Stanford should ascend to
the No. 1 position in the nation — a spot the
Cardinal has not occupied since last year —
when the new women's collegiate tennis
polls are released next week.
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan also
took over the top spot on the all-time career
winning percentage list with the win, running
his career winning record to 310-33 (.904)
over 14 years as a coach. Florida's Andy Bran
di moved to the No. 2 position at 220-24 (.900)
over nine years there. Since 1989, Brennan
has led the Cardinal to an incredible 118-4
match record, with three of those losses com
ing at the hands of the Gators.
Yesterday's match will likely serve as a
preview for this year's NCAA Champi
onship, to be held May 12-20 in Gainesville,
Fla. Stanford will attempt to win back the
NCAA title it owned from 1986 to 1991, but
lost to the Gators.
Stanford will resume dual match action
this week, hosting the University of Pacific
on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. The Cardinal will
then host rival No. 6 California in the Big
Match on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. Both match
es will be held at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
