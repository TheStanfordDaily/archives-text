# Golfers head to Sacramento
## 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
Stanford's men's golf team will
be in Sacramento today and
tomorrow for the Sacramento
State Invitational, the second
tournament of this season.
Leading the team are sopho
mores Steve Burdick, Jerry
Chang and Darren Dragovich.
Two seniors and two freshmen
round out the squad, making it a
relatively young team. Coach
Wally Goodwin hopes the team
will return from this tournament
with a little more experience and
the competitive spirit they will
need to compete with the best of
the Pacific 10 Conference this
season.
The tournament will be held at
Rancho Murietta, sight of several
professional competitions. This
course has a reputation for being
very difficult, so it will be a good
warmup for Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal golfers face a field
of several Northern California,
Oregon and Arizona teams.
Though none of these have the
reputations of the perennial pow
erhouses of the Pac-10 — namely
Arizona and Arizona State — the
tournament is expected to be com

petitive.
Stanford will golf two rounds
on Monday and another on Tues
day. "Most people don't appreciate
how tough that is," said Goodwin.
"It requires (as many as) 10 hours
of intense concentration in a single
day. That can wear on a player."
Furthermore, the tournament
will be played "sight unseen" —
meaning there will be no practice
rounds. The players will have to
be particularly accurate, since
they will have no previous knowl
edge of the course or its condi
tions. "It is the perfect tourna
ment for the team right now. The
guys have got to be pretty much
on top of their directional game,"
said Goodwin.
This tournament marks the
second half of a season that began
in the fall and then paused for the
winter. The season resumed with
the International Intercollegiate
tournament in Monterrey, Mexico
Feb. 11-13. Stanford brought
home a respectable 13th place,
with Burdick and Dragovich fin
ishing ninth and 12th respectively
in individual competition.
"Considering their age, this
team has a really competitive per
sonality. They haven't played for a
while but that sense of competi

tion will definitely be there about
mid season," Goodwin asserted.
These golfers are filling the
roles of four redshirts this season:
All-Americans Notah Begay and
Casey Martin, All-Pac-10 Brad
Lanning and All-Big West transfer
William Yanagasiwa. The four
Cardinal linksters opted to sit out
a year so they could play as a unit
and have a chance at the NCAA
Championships next season.
This arrangement allows the
younger players to get some expe
rience. "This season we're more
likely to give the freshmen the nod
over the seniors," Goodwin
explained.
"The team's a little weaker
than it was last year," said Bur
dick, the only returning member
of the squad. "But it gives the
younger guys a chance to play.
And next year we'll have a really
solid team."
This fall, Burdick's play proved
to be extraordinary. Throughout
the fall half of the season, the
Sacramento native exceeded a
score of 76 only once, and that was
under 50 m.p.h. winds at the
UCLA tournament in Temecula,
Calif. "It was a tremendous perfor
mance by a sophomore," Goodwin
said of Burdick's fall season.
