# Alarm barely noticed by Club Uj partygoers
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
A fire alarm did little to phase
party-goers at Club Ujamaa Satur
day night, but it did spark ram
pant rumors about its cause â€”
from a small fire caused by candles
to sensors tripped by body heat.
The alarm was set off in Grana
da around 11:40 p.m. and resound
ed in Lagunita Hall for about ten
minutes, but did not quite result
in a massive exodus, even though
approximately 1000 people were
jammed into two of the dorm
lounges and the dining hall.
Most students continued to
ignore the alarm until the music
was turned off and resident assis
tants started herding people out.
"I heard it for a split second,
then dismissed it," "said freshman
Deena White, an Ujamaa resident,
who complained the lounges were
too noisy and crammed for people

to pay attention to the alarm.
Fire captain Bruce Hallberg
said the students' treatment of
the alarm was "foolish," explain
ing that "the only thing that
building has going for it is the
alarm system. It's not even
equipped with fire sprinklers."
The source of the alarm has
not yet been confirmed, but fire
department officials believe an
overheated blender left in a hall
was intercepted by heat sensors,
according to freshman Katherine
Chi, a Granada resident.
However, freshman John Lach
said a paper bag with sand and
candles inside was placed at the
end of the hall, where he saw it
burn in a foot-high flame.
Although it was promptly extin
guished, a cloud of smoke wafted
to the ceiling and set the alarm off.
Coterminal student Karen Ho,
an Ujamaa resident, said, "I think
it was all the body heat from Uj."
