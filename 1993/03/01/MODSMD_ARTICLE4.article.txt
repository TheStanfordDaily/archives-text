# 'Islam is not the issue':
## Teach-in examines Indian rift 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Concerned students and profes
sors held a teach-in Saturday after
noon in Terman Auditorium to
raise awareness about — and spark
action to change — the current
Hindu-Muslim conflict in India.
At the event, attended by about
100 people, speakers emphasized
that the conflict extends beyond
religious boundaries and is indica
tive of the country's deeply rooted
political instability.
"Islam is not the issue at all,"
History Prof. Mark Mancall told
the gathered crowd. "It is just the
primary focus of mobilization.
"What is going on is an attempt
at political upheaval which goes
way beyond normal political life,"

he said. It is not just an attempt to
seize power but "a change in the
cultural foundations of India."
Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta said nobody has tried to
face the tremendous economic and
political problems in India.
"The way majority rule is being
interpreted in India dictates that
what the Hindus say is what hap
pens — this is very dangerous,"
Gupta said.
According to doctoral student
Amit Rai, one of the event's coor
dinators, the program came about
because of the recent ethnic con
flict in India.
For the past two months, India
has been engulfed in religious vio
lence, which has led to the deaths of
more than 3,000 people, after Hindu
militants destroyed a 16th- century

mosque in December. The mosque,
in the northern city of Ayodhya, was
believed to be built on the birthplace
of the Hindu god Rama.
Last week, more than 45,000
Hindus across India were arrested
as they tried to travel to the capital
after a fundamentalist Hindu op
position party called for a massive
demonstration in an effort to oust
the current government. The up
rising was quelled Thursday after
100,000 police officers cordoned
off government buildings in New
Delhi.
The 900,000 Hindus living in
the United States have the second
highest economic status of any
ethnic group, said Rai.
"That's important for the Indian
government and for the funda
mentalists in that country," he
said, adding that it shows Ameri
cans can have an influence on the
conflict.
The event was divided into two
sessions, each with four speakers
and a question-and-answer ses
sion. They concentrated mainly
on growing religious issues in
India and their relationship to
people in America.
The teach-in sought to analyze
the mounting tensions in India
and find causes and solutions,
said doctoral student Saba Mah
mood, co-coordinator of the
event. "By tying religion and pol
itics together, we can understand
why people are turning to reli
gion. . . . Religion is an expression
of a larger issue."
Most of the speakers conclud
ed that the religious tensions in

India are primarily a result of
other problems, such as politics,
economics and cultural differ
ences.
In her speech, Mahmood
described the events in India as
part of a worldwide trend toward
religious fundamentalism. "India
is not alone in the rise of the reli
gious right," she said pointing to
the fundamentalist movements
in Eastern Europe and the Unit
ed States.
"Religion is not in and of itself
the problem. It is the interpreta
tion and the politics of that inter
pretation," Mahmood said. "The
phenomenon of religious up
heaval is too widespread to be
considered as insanity."
Teach-in participants were
asked to sign a petition and were
given information on writing let
ters to the Indian government.
The teach-in was funded by the
Stanford Middle East Focus, the
Coalition Against Communalism,
the Palo Alto Peace Center and a
number of individual contributors.
