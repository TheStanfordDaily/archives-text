# Poet discusses race, gender, class

"l am here as a messenger," Chicana lesbian femi
nist poet and fiction writer Gloria Anzaldua said in a
Saturday afternoon speech in Cubberley Auditori
um.
"There are certain ideas that I read, that I hear,
that I think, and I synthesize them here," Anzaldua
said. Her talk, "The New Mestiza: Reflections on the
Borderlands of Race, Gender, and Sexuality," drew
an audience of about 180.
Anzaldua discussed the challenges of identity
faced by "Chicanas, blacks, queers, women, Asians
(and) working class people," emphasizing the impor
tance of living in the "dominant culture" without for
getting one's background.
Anzaldua wrote the poetry and prose book "Bor
derlands/La Frontera," and co-edited two antholo
gies of writings by women of color, "This Bridge

Called My Back" and "Making Face, Making Soul."
The event — part of Women's Herstory Month —
was co-sponsored by Mujeres de MEChA at Stanford,
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford,
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and the Stanford
Women's Collective.
Anzaldua developed the term "New Mestiza" in
"Borderlands" as a reaction to "how . . . Chicanas
and Latinas are reconfiguring our identity.
"What do we all have in common?" she asked.
"We're mixed — racially, culturally, intellectually.
We were always in a white world — the white person
is always inside our skull."
Anzaldua drew the visual image of the New Mesti
za having many different legs, with each foot in a dif
ferent cultural group.
The New Mestiza, Anzaldua said, engages in the
"New Nationalism" or "New Tribalism" being expe-
rienced on college campuses
today.
"There is a resurgence of being
proud to be part of an ethnic com
munity, yet with the awareness
that there are other groups equal
ly disenfranchised," Anzaldua
said.
Ethnic and other minority
groups can no longer look on the
problem as "us versus them,"
Anzaldua said. "I am them and
they are me. Borders and bound
aries everywhere are constantly
being penetrated."
Anzaldua warned, however, of
the pressure toward cultural
assimilation inherent in the uni
versity system: "Professors may
not want you to deal too much
with your ethnic identity," Anzal
dua said. "Most institutions of
higher learning across the coun
try would rather you forget your
race, rather you forget you're
queer, rather you forget you're
working class, rather you forget
any element that's less than

savory."
The dominant culture robs
ethnic communities of their cre
ativity, Anzaldua said. "They
want our stuff— our energy, our
writing, our history — what's
new and vital."
Anzaldua said that it is a chal
lenge for many minority groups
to speak and act out, especially
Chicana and women, because
they are often taught from birth
to be submissive and respect oth
ers.
"Being an activist means that
looking and seeing is not enough,
listening is not enough, talking is
not enough. You have to do," she
said. "You've got to protect your
self, but you've got to be vulnera
ble and risk."
Anzaldua also recognized
that, in a world of escalating rape
and domestic violence, many
Chicana and Latina women have
a difficult time trusting both
themselves and those closest to
them.
"We have been taught not to
trust ourselves — just to look to
higher authority," said Anzaldua.
"Trust yourself . . . that you can
manage to live in the world."
