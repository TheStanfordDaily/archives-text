## FBI confirms explosion in Trade Ctr. 
### 
_ NEW YORK (AP) - The FBI con
firmed yesterday that a bomb caused
the explosion at the World Trade Cen
ter, and speculation on possible suspects
ranged from militants from the former
Yugoslavia to foreign drug dealers.
In addition, a Port Authority worker
who had been reported missing since
Friday's explosion was accounted for
when he was found safe outside the
blast area. He was unaware anyone had
been looking for him.
One other Port Authority worker
remained missing in the wake of the

explosion that killed five people and
injured more than 1,000.
Meanwhile, a shaken city beefed up
security at airports and public build
ings.
"Every airport, every public building
has now heightened security," Gov.
Mario Cuomo said. "If, God forbid, it is
terrorist-related, then it is not a terror
ist attack on New York and New Jersey
but on the whole United States."
Officials could only speculate about
who caused the blast, which rocked the
110-story twin towers with earthquake

like force. Officials said the complex
would be closed for more than a week
until it can be deemed safe.
"We don't know if this was one insane
individual... someone with a trunkload
of plastique, or a well-thought out,
sophisticated attack," Cuomo said.
"A lot of people have been laid off
recently," said James Fox, head of the
FBl's New York office. "You've got some
drug dealers upset with the U.S. govern
ment, it could be terrorists upset for
other causes. There are just so many pos
sibilities."
