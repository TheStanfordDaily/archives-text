IRA admits bombing
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) — The Irish Republican Army said
yesterday it was responsible for a London bombing that
injured 18 people, but it blamed police for causing casualties
by not taking a warning seriously.
A statement issued in Dublin by the outlawed group said
police were warned that a bomb had been planted outside a
food store on Camden High Street, near a popular weekend
market, more than 40 minutes before the explosion Saturday.
But Scotland Yard said the food store was 400 yards from
where the bomb exploded in a trash can. Police were evacu
ating shoppers away from the store toward the can when
the bomb went off.
Four people remained hospitalized with serious injuries
yesterday. Fourteen other people were treated for minor

injuries and released.
Leaflets dropped in Bosnia
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — The U.S. mili
tary launched a major relief effort in besieged eastern Bosnia,
dropping a million leaflets saying airdrops of badly needed
humanitarian aid were on the way. But Bosnian officials said
yesterday that some of the messages missed the mark.
Local officials said residents feared the bundles of food and
medicine also might not land in the intended villages.
The first mission to carry supplies apparently left Rhein-
Main Air Base in Germany late yesterday, German TV said in
a report showing footage of U.S. C-130 Hercules transport
planes taking off. An air base spokesman would neither con
firm nor deny the report.
