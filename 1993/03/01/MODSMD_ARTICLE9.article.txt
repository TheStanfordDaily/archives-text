### 
WACO, Texas (AP) â€” A fierce gun bat
tle erupted yesterday as more than 100
law officers tried to arrest the leader of a
heavily armed religious cult. At least four
federal agents were killed and cult mem
bers said one follower died.
At least 14 agents were wounded in the
45-minute shootout at the isolated com
pound of the Branch Da vidians' sect about
10 miles east of Waco. Several sect mem
bers were also reportedly wounded, offi
cials said.
The battle began when federal agents
hidden in livestock trailers stormed the
main home of the sect, witnesses said. The
agents had warrants to search the com
pound for guns and explosives and to
arrest its leader, Vernon Howell, said Les
Stanford of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobac
co and Firearms in Washington.
After a cease-fire was negotiated,
ambulances and helicopters removed
wounded agents as other law enforcement
officers remained encamped at the scene.
ATF officials said four agents were killed
and 14 were wounded.
At nightfall, the standoff continued.
"It sounded like a war zone, people
were being hit, you could hear people
screaming with the agony, the pain of it,"
said John McLemore, a KWTX-TV

reporter who witnessed the shootout.
The ATF estimates that 75 people were
in Branch Davidians' group, about a third
of them children. Howell, who claims to be
Jesus Christ, has led the nearly 60-year
old cult since the mid-1980s.
The assault came one day after the
Waco Tribune-Herald began publishing a
series on the cult, quoting former mem
bers as saying the 33-year-old Howell may
have abused children of group members
and claimed to have at least 15 wives.
Howell denied the abuse accusations.
He and his wife, Rachel, were married in
1984 when he was 24 and she was 14.
ATF spokesman Jack Killorin in Wash
ington said the assault had been planned
for several weeks, although he added, M I
think the newspaper's investigation set up
heightened tension."
The cult's fortress, called Mount
Carmel, is dominated by a tower with
lookout windows facing in all directions.
Guards reportedly patrol the 77-acre
grounds at night.
According to witnesses, federal agents
hid in livestock trailers as they drove up to
the compound. As three National Guard
helicopters approached, the 100 law officers
stormed the main home, throwing concus
sion grenades and screaming "Come out!"
