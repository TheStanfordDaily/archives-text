unfortunately this is where
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING
TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS.
Every year, a lot of people make a
1 huge mistake on their taxes.They
don't take advantage of tax deferral and
wind up sending Uncle Sam money they
could be saving for retirement.
Fortunately, that's a mistake you can
easily avoid with 1 lAA'CRKf" SRAs.
SRAs not only ease your current tax
bite, they offer a remarkably easy way
to build retirement income—especially
for the "extras" that your regular pension
and Social Security benefits may not
cover. Because your contributions are
made in before-tax dollars, you pay less
taxes now. And since all earnings on
your SRA are tax-deferred as well, the
money you don't send to Washington
works even harder for you. Down the
road, that can make a dramatic difference
in your quality of life.
What else makes SRAs so special.'
A range of allocation choices —from the
guaranteed security ol TIAA to the
diversified investment accounts of
CREF's variable annuity—all backed
by the nation's number one retirement
system.
Why write off the chance lor a more
rewarding retirement Call today and
learn more about how TIAA-CREF
SRAs can help you enjoy many
happy returns.
Benefit now from tax deferral. Call our SRA hotline 1 800-842-2733, ext. 8016.
