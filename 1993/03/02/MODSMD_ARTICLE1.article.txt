# Going home again
## Casper, on trip to Germany, stops by Stanford in Berlin

BERLIN — Who says you can't
go home again?
Taking a brief respite from his
official duties in Building 10, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
will finish a week-long tour of his
native Germany today.
The trip, which has included
meetings with German business
and political leaders as well as
Stanford students studying in
Berlin, has put Casper in an unex
pected limelight, even though he's
thousands of miles away from the
Farm. In his travels, he has been
almost revered as a novelty: a na
tive German who became presi
dent of a world-renowned univer
sity.
Casper said his foremost goal in
traveling to Germany was to meet
with leaders of the Essen-based
Krupp Foundation to continue
ongoing relations. The foundation
has funded internships for Stan
ford-in-Berlin students since
1982.
Another purpose for his visit
was to meet with representatives
of German government and in
dustries in attempt to fund a Ger
man-American professorship, he
said.

But Casper hasn't spent all his
time with officials. A handful of
Stanford interns were in Essen at
the time of Casper's visit and got a
chance to speak to their president.
And yesterday, Casper had
lunch with Stanford students
studying at the Berlin Center.
Later, the University hosted a re
ception for about 80 guests includ
ing faculty, students and promi
nent Berlin residents. Following
the reception, Casper attended a
dinner in his honor held by the
Minister of Culture and Science.
Speaking in English, Casper
talked informally with students,
exchanging ideas on cultural dif
ferences and general experiences
abroad. He seemed especially in
terested in the differences be
tween the former East and West
sections of Berlin.
He also told students that he
supports Stanford's overseas pro
grams, threatened in recent years
by budget cuts. Casper said he
feels every student should go
abroad "to encounter stereotypes
and get different perspectives on
things we often take for granted."
And while Germany has re
cently has several publicized
episodes of hostility towards for
eigners, Casper asserted that he
does not feel that the situation is
particularly dangerous.
"There are tensions every
where," he said. "They belong to
the real world experience." Draw
ing on his own experiences as an
exchange student in America a lit
tle more than a decade after World
War 11, Casper said he "experi

enced much hostility at that time."
"People associated me with the
Nazi regime, which was ridicu
lous because I was just a small
child then," he continued. "But I
must say that I grew so much
from my experiences in America
at that time. . . . Sometimes you
may have to travel to places
where you are not welcomed with
outstretched arms . . . but that is
reality. And it is in such places
that you often learn the most."
Today, he said he feels strong
ties to both American and Ger
man cultures.

Casper's travels have taken
him to many German cities
including Bonn, Essen, Frank
furt, Berlin and Hamburg. When
not acting as Stanford's leader,
Casper toured the country as a
native son. In Hamburg, he
attended a reunion of his
Abiturklasse — his high school
class — arranged specially for his
visit. He also visited with family
in both Hamburg and Postdam.
