Relief falls in wrong hands
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — The first food and medicine
dropped by U.S. planes for hungry Mus
lims reportedly fell mostly into the hands
of Serbs waging an attack yesterday on a

the rugged, inhospitable mountains
around Cerska, an area where up to 20,000
Muslims are besieged.
