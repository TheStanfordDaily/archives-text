Woon must define and
expand role of educator
by increasing visibility

LAST WEEK, THE Universi
ty completed an extensive
nine-month search and chose
Brown University Associate Dean
Tommy Lee Woon to be Stanford's
new multicultural educator.
While the search process was
undoubtedly a tough one for both
the University and Woon, their
work is only beginning. As Woon
steps into his new office this June,
he will need to establish himself as
an accessible and effective resource
for Stanford's many communities.
In a time when budget cuts and
multicultural backlash are both
frequent, the need for a multicul
tural educator has been called into
question by some. Woon faces not
only the challenge of filling the
position, but also that of justifying
its existence to those who may be
skeptical of its necessity.
The answer lies in tangible
results.
The tasks that a multicultural
educator are expected to perform —
primarily the support and training
of various student groups — do not
immediately lend themselves to a
definitive measure of effectiveness.
However, by being a visible and
active figure in all campus commu
nities, Woon can address students'
specific needs and work to provide
obvious and substantial results.
Similarly, the University must
do its part to more clearly define
the multicultural educator's spe
cific duties, so that students
understand the position's impor
tance to the University.
Incidents have occurred this
school year point to a need for a
single educator whom students
would universally recognize as the
person they could address their
concerns about issues of multicul
turalism at Stanford.
A multicultural educator could

have provided a valuable perspec
tive to the incident at the Faculty
Club in which a professor made
racist remarks directed toward an
Asian-American student employee.
Having a single person in the
University trained with issues
involving racial sensitivity may
have facilitated communication
between the student, the school
and the professor.
Similarly, concerns raised by an
overheard, allegedly racist remark
from the director of the Stanford
Teacher Education Program have
reminded the University that
graduate students are often over
looked when addressing multicul
tural issues.
While faculty, administrators
and students in the program
attempt to reconcile these and
other issues and disagreements, the
need has arisen for a person who
can offer a more detached perspec
tive, yet has insight on the Univer
sity's general multicultural goals.
However, the multicultural edu
cator's role cannot be entirely
defined by conflict resolution.
Woon also has the difficult task of
bringing the numerous and some
what segregated student commu
nities together.
While individual communities
of ethnicity, gender, sexual orienta
tion, religion and disability have
each built strong communities, the
next step is promoting more inter
action between these groups.
Woon must also continue to
extend the University's stated
commitment of making sure mul
ticulturalism spans beyond issues
concerning ethnic groups, and that
all perspectives are addressed.
While the role of a multicultural
educator may seem somewhat
vague and undefined to many,
Woon is now in the position to pro
vide a tangible answer to, "What
does a multicultural educator do,
anyway?"
He has the.opportunity to carve
his own niche in the University
community and show students
that the multicultural educator
has a vital and influential role. •
