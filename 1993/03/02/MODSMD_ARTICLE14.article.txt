Republicans aren't cool.
Not in 1993 they aren't. The mere
word "republican" has taken on a
whole new, quasi-fascist, meaning in the
past nine months or so. "Republican"
doesn't mean "Gulf War victory" any
more. Instead, it stands for an ugly past
of supply-side economics, corporate greed
and politically powerful astrologists.
And sad though it may be for some,
Republicans aren't going to be cool again
for a long, long time. After 12 years of
Republicanism, people have embraced the
"new breed" of Democrats and Bill Clinton.
They will do anything for our new
president. They voted in record numbers,
they will pay more taxes willingly and —
most impressively — they have convinced
themselves of similarities between Mr.
Clinton and John F. Kennedy. Yes, it's
going to be a long, cold winter for most
Republicans.
But Republicans at Stanford are dif
ferent. They can scofT at jokes involving
vomit and Japanese politicians. They can
stand tall and be proud. Because unlike
their counterparts all across the country,
they have something to look forward to
before the 1996 elections. His name is
Jack Kemp, and he's coming to Stanford.
Stanford's Hoover Institution just
named Kemp a Hoover Fellow. And if the
title "Distinguished Hoover Fellow"
doesn't impress you, try "next president
of the United States." It seems a quite

appropriate one for Kemp at the
moment.
If I were a College Republican — or a
Pi Phi — I'd "get psyched" about Kemp's
appointment. Of course, high-profile
politicos are not a rarity on the Stanford
campus. And they aren't reclusive,
either. It is the very rare student who
hasn't heard a George Schultz or Con
doleezza Rice speech.
But Jack Kemp isn't just another big
name conservative. He's the big-name
conservative. He's the future of the
Republican party in the United States.
And best of all, he has a heart. Yes, a
heart. The Republicans need that these
days, as House Minority Leader Bob
Michel displayed in his very uncool
response to Clinton's State of the Union
address.
We can only hope that when Kemp
comes to campus — for however short a
stay — he'll show off that heart of his. It
would be unfair to expect community jogs
around Lake Lagunita and stops at
McDonald's, but a lecture or two would
certainly be nice. If only for the College
Republicans' sake.
I'm sure he'll give them, too. It's hard
to imagine a man who played quarter
back in the National Football League
associating exclusively with Hoover Fel
lows during his stay at Stanford. No, he'll
be out and about. And before you know it
he'll be warming up for the presidential

campaign.
The whole thing smells of excitement
and opportunity. It almost — almost —
makes you want to be a Republican. Of
course, some campus liberals will not
share in the excitement over Kemp's
appointment at Stanford.
They will see him as just another big
shot republican at the house of evil that
is the Hoover Institution and have night
mares of Thomas Sowell filling a cabinet
post. But just this once we should put
aside our judgements of Hoover arid be
glad that Kemp is coming to campus.
So forget about Hoover. Some think
it's great. Some hate it. And some find it
similar to the Department of Athletics —
strangely suspicious and almost sinister,
yet always able to declare itself innocent
of any wrongdoing. No matter what you
think of it, though, you must give it cred
it for attracting the people it does.
And it has done itself proud with Jack
Kemp. Even if he is uncool.

John Ford is not making any endorse
ments for the 1996 presidential cam
paign. However, if Al Gore sets him up
with Karenna, John is willing to bend his
principles just this once.
