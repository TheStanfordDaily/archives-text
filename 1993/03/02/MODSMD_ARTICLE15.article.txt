Feminism an aspect of identity, not all-encompassing

IWAS VERY disturbed by Matt Kelso's
Feb. 25 letter. Though I haven't read
the column by Lisa Koven in the
Review, I feel Kelso is misinterpreting
Tish Williams' column to justify compla
cency with the status quo and a refusal to
give in to further changes.
While I respect Kelso's freedom to
express his viewpoint on a campus
which predominantly favors liberalism
and political correctness, he is basing his
argument on his own distorted stereo
type of the "hard-core liberal left's radi
cal, destructive feminist ideology." What
is the feminist left? In Kelso's opinion, it
seems to be the example of overreaction
by so-called radical feminists which he
uses to invalidate protests against sex
ism.
Though he calls the liberal argument
"a slap in the face to all dedicated Amer
ican women who have done so much to
change 'traditional' ways," I find it

telling that on the same day Jean Ro, a
graduate student in chemical engineer
ing, wrote The Daily to describe her
numerous experiences with sexism by
male students who discouraged her pur
suit of a Ph.D. Is Kelso implying that Ro
should just keep quiet and be grateful
that she is less oppressed than women
25 years ago?
I think everyone should understand
that the basic ideology of feminism is
that females and males have equal
value. This does not mean male-bashing.
When readers noted the absence of
female columnists in The Daily, I don't
think the intent was to belittle Williams
for not expressing explicitly feminist
viewpoints. It is great to have a woman
columnist who writes humorously about
many topics, but she is only one person.
The important thing about having
women writers is that they represent
different voices in the Stanford popula

tion. Having only male writers tends to
suggest that they represent the norm of
the student body.
I would like to emphasize that femi
nists come in all shapes and sizes. Femi
nism realizes that equality does not
mean identicalness. I cherish the
uniqueness of males, and love the fact
that part of my identity is being a
woman. But equally important parts of
my identity are that I am Korean-Ameri
can, fuzzy, Christian, left-handed and
Midwestern.
Aside from some basic biological dif
ferences, there is nothing men can do
that women can't do (and vice-versa)
that isn't a product of socialization.
Some men claim to believe in equality of
sexes but critique feminists for trying to
overcome social barriers to equality.
Feminist ideology does not include
the "man-equals-enemy" theory. I try
not to be militant because that's not

what it's all about, but sometimes it's
hard not to get angry or frustrated when
I am not seen as a real person, but as an
object or plaything. Consider how few
movies portray women as anything more
than "the girlfriend." I have a right to
be disgusted by men who don't believe
that "no" really means "no." I don't see
men as the enemy, but frankly, most
sexist behavior comes from the male
dominated system.
We women need a mainstream forum
for our ideas. I think people immediately
discount publications like Aurora, Criti
cal Bitch and G-Spot as "radical,
destructive feminism" and don't take
seriously their thought-provoking con
tents. There are many more issues
which I have left unaddressed and I
hope other women and men will voice
their opinions as well.
