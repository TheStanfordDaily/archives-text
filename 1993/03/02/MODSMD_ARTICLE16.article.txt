# Anti-abortion insert a waste of needed Hinds
## 
### 
I was dismayed at the 12-page, full
color pro-life supplement in The Daily's
Feb. 23 edition not only because it was
full of inaccuracies and errors, but worst
of all, because of the huge amount of
money which some wealthy backer has
wasted on it.
Whoever financed that supplement
spent $1,000 just to get it into The
Daily, to say nothing of the huge sums it
must have cost to produce that mega-ad.
Perhaps costly ad campaigns like that
had their place in the '80s, but no
longer; not in the depressed California
economy of the '90s.
If those pro-life groups were really as
interested in the welfare of young
women as they claim to be, they would
have put that money to better use in

more constructive ways: helping impov
erished women to buy Norplant and
other birth control methods and by
donating money to those charitable
groups that struggle on a shoestring
(and just barely survive) to help impov
erished mothers buy clothes and other
items for their babies.
The only ones who that extravagant
ad helped were the ad agencies, the pub
lic relations firms and, yes, The Daily
(which is why you probably won't print
this letter).
