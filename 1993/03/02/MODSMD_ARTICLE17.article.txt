# Stanford should repay misused federal funds
## 
### 
In these days of formulating federal
spending cuts, it should be noted that
Stanford should, and probably will, be

held accountable for past research
overhead charges made by the Univer
sity which were found by the federal
government to be totally unacceptable
as research-related expenses.
The taxpayers in this country are
being asked to pay higher taxes and they
in return should ask their leaders to
reduce spending.
Among eventual cost-cutting move*
may be the elimination of the National
Endowment for the Arts and the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, with the latter's com
mercially beneficial programs redis
tributed to other federal agencies.
Stanford and other universities which
recklessly and uncaringly overcharged
the federal government for research
overhead should be held accountable
for their actions.
Stanford University can rectify its
example of dishonesty to the people of
this country by repaying the money

acquired by wrongful means. It is too
bad that Stanford's centennial goals will
now never be reached because of its past
actions.
