# Decision tightens animal research rules
## Medical Center officials say they already comply 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A federal court decision last
week tightening regulations on
animal research should have
little effect on work at Stan
ford, Medical Center officials
say.
But some local animal rights
activists believe that the ruling
will force the University to
comply with rules they claim it
has long ignored.
If it survives a possible ap
peal, Friday's ruling by federal
Judge Charles Richey would
mandate the U.S. Department
of Agriculture to enforce more
rigorously a 1985 amendment
to the 1966 Animal Welfare
Act.
The amendment required
the department to set clear
standards for the proper exer
cise of dogs and to adopt ade
quate rules to create a physical
environment that promoted
psychological well-being of pri
mates. The Department of
Agriculture oversees animal re

search at Stanford and other
research universities.
Richey ruled that the depart
ment has failed on both counts and
also has improperly granted exemp
tions to institutions that wanted to
use cages for certain research that
were smaller than allowed.
Stanford officials say the under
ground Research Animal Facility
— which houses more than 55,000
animals, including rats, mice, pigs
and geese — already complies with
the amendment. "I feel we had a
very good program at Stanford to
begin with," said Reese Zasio, man
ager of animal care supervision in
the Department of Comparative
Medicine.
The effect on the University will
depend on what the Department of
Agriculture decides in its analysis
of the amendment, Zasio said.
But Palo Alto resident Lise
Giraud, co-director of education
for the San Rafael-based In
Defense of Animals, said the pro
visions of the bill "have never
been implemented. . . . Each
institution has the licence to treat
this whole matter as it sees fit."
The ruling could force the Uni
versity to "build something total
ly different," she said, adding that
Stanford was "among the fore
front of institutions that fought
the implementation of the 1985
regulations."
According to the most recent

rules from the Department of
Agriculture, the current mini
mum required floor space for a
three-foot-long dog is 12.25
square feet.
If the dogs are provided with
twice that amount, as some are at
Stanford, they are exempt from
the daily exercise requirement.
But Zasio said Stanford allows
them to exercise anyway by plac
ing them in an open area where
they are "allowed to move freely
during the daily cleaning of
[their] housing area."
But Giraud — who noted that
she has long objected to an under
ground facility like Stanford's
where animals never see the sun
and must breathe recycled air —
said, "Happiness consists of going
out and exercising."
"I find the cages in which the
dogs are kept totally inadequate.
It's outrageous that 'exercise'
consists of being allowed to run
around the room while the cages
are steam-cleaned."
Regulations also stipulate that
primates must be able to hear and
see others of their own or compat
ible species, unless the attending
veterinarian determines that
would endanger their health,
safety and well-being. In addition,
the act requires primates' envi
ronments be enriched with items
such as perches and mirrors.
"We try to socialize the ani
mals," Zasio said. "We provide
fruits, toys, a room where ani
mals can see and make gestures
and hear each other."
