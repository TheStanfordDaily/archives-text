## Peter Dukes it out for Cardinal hoops Three-point shooter ends collegiate career 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Throughout last season,
"Peter Dukes for three" became a
familiar sound over the public
address system at Maples Pavil
ion. This weekend, those sounds
will be heard for the last time, as
the senior guard plays his final
home games in a Stanford uni
form.
"I just want to go out and com
pete and enjoy the last few games
of my career," Dukes said. "If you
go out there and give it your best
shot, you go out with a sense of
accomplishment."
Dukes has accomplished much
in his four years at Stanford.
After redshirting his first season,
Dukes steadily improved in each

intensity, a good atti
tude and a hard work
ethic to the team.'

of the subsequent campaigns,
consequently increasing his play
ing time. Following his initial two
years as a reserve, the 1991-92
season marked a breakthrough
as Dukes moved into the starting
lineup. He did not disappoint,
becoming the Cardinal's third
leading scorer and most profi
cient outside-shooting threat.
With opposing defenses con
centrating on Ail-American Adam
Keefe, Dukes was able to take
advantage of the clear looks he
was given at the basket, hitting 47
percent of his three-point shots.
Dukes made a school-record 79
three-pointers last season follow
ing extensive off-season practice
to improve his range. Yet with
Keefe advancing to the NBA,
opponents' defensive schemes
shifted their focus this year to
stopping the Cardinal's most visi
ble shooter, and instead of being
set when prepared to shoot, Dukes
has had to take more off-balance,
out-of-rhythm shots.
"I knew last year that I was
going to feel the absence of Keefe
the most," Dukes said. "Teams
have been able to get right up into
me, forcing me to create more of
my shots which is not what I like
to do."
"Pete gets a rhythm of stepping
into shots," said coach Mike
Montgomery. "Part of the prob
lem is not having the inside guys
to set him up. People have been
covering him because of what he
did last year, so he hasn't had
time to shoot the ball."
As a result, for the mtyority of
the current season, Dukes has
struggled at the offensive end of
the floor. He is shooting a mere 33
percent from the field and just 32
percent from three-point territo
ry. After freshman guard Dion
Cross led the team in scoring for
three consecutive games, he

replaced Dukes in the starting
lineup.
"My season has been a little
disappointing, especially relative
to my performance last year,"
Dukes said. "But putting Dion in
the starting lineup was good for
our team. We're turning more
towards an offense creating shots,
and Dion is better at that."
Despite his shooting woes, the
Seattle native has managed to
keep a positive outlook on both his
performance and that of the team.
"He's worked really hard,"
Montgomery said. "He's such a
good kid and wants so badly to
succeed. He's hung in there men
tally — his attitude has been good,
and you can't do better than
that."
"Pete has brought intensity, a
good attitude and a hard work
ethic to the team," said senior
teammate Kenny Hicks. "He may
not be the fastest or jump the
highest, but he uses his heart to
get the job done for us, and that's
why I respect him."
Dukes returned to his old form
two weeks ago against USC, mak
ing the first two three-point shots
that he took, and three of four on
the afternoon. He continued that
success last Thursday night in
Washington, leading the Cardinal
with 14 points.
"It felt good," Dukes said. "It
had been a while since I'd been
able to do that. But I've always
been a streak shooter, so if I make
my first few shots I want to have
the ball again."
The senior off-guard is sad
dened about ending his playing
career, yet at the same time is
looking forward to the many excit
ing non-basketball related oppor
tunities that lie ahead. Dukes
plans to travel in Europe this
summer, and attend business
school after spending some time
in the working world.
"Basketball has been some
thing I've been committed to the
last nine years of my life," Dukes
said. "But being able to not touch
a basketball for a period of time
will give me a little freedom. This
spring break, I'm going to go
snow skiing, and I couldn't do
that in the past because of basket
ball."
Even though he is not having
the season he envisioned at the
start, the camaraderie with his
teammates, participating in the
increasing success of the Cardinal
basketball program and learning
from others will allow Dukes to
take away many fond memories
from his years at Stanford.
"My most memorable game
was in my redshirt freshman
year," Dukes said. "Marcus (Lol
lie) and I played guard the last 10
minutes of the game at UCLA,
and that was the first time ever
that Stanford had won at Pauley
Pavilion. I was so young at the
time that I didn't realize what I
was a part of. It always brings a
smile to my face."
With his purposeful play at
Stanford, he brought smiles to the
faces of many.

two weeks ago against USC, mak
ing the first two three-point shots
that he took, and three of four on
the afternoon. He continued that
success last Thursday night in
Washington, leading the Cardinal
with 14 points.
"It felt good," Dukes said. "It
had been a while since I'd been
able to do that. But I've always
been a streak shooter, so if I make
my first few shots I want to have
the ball again."
The senior off-guard is sad
dened about ending his playing
career, yet at the same time is
looking forward to the many excit
ing non-basketball related oppor
tunities that lie ahead. Dukes
plans to travel in Europe this
summer, and attend business
school after spending some time
in the working world.
"Basketball has been some
thing I've been committed to the
last nine years of my life," Dukes
said. "But being able to not touch
a basketball for a period of time
will give me a little freedom. This
spring break, I'm going to go
snow skiing, and I couldn't do
that in the past because of basket
ball."
Even though he is not having
the season he envisioned at the
start, the camaraderie with his
teammates, participating in the
increasing success of the Cardinal
basketball program and learning
from others will allow Dukes to
take away many fond memories
from his years at Stanford.
"My most memorable game
was in my redshirt freshman
year," Dukes said. "Marcus (Lol
lie) and I played guard the last 10
minutes of the game at UCLA,
and that was the first time ever
that Stanford had won at Pauley
Pavilion. I was so young at the
time that I didn't realize what I
was a part of. It always brings a
smile to my face."
With his purposeful play at
Stanford, he brought smiles to the
faces of many.
