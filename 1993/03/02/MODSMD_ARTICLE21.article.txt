# 'Cats mangle baseball, 16-2
## 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Not even Sunday's surprising thunderstorms in
Tucson, Ariz, could cool the bats of the University of
Arizona. For the third consecutive game, the Wildcats
embarked on an offensive melee, rocketing four home
runs en route to a 16-2 win.
No. 5 Arizona (11-5), who handed No. 10 Stanford
(10-6) its fourth-straight loss, showed all weekend
why its offense is widely considered to be the most
potent in collegiate baseball, battering the Cardinal
pitchers for 43 runs and 51 hits.
"They have a lot of experienced hitters, and that's
an advantage," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"But today we were just shut down completely."
The game, played on a cold, wet Frank Sancet
Field, had the early earmarks of a pitching duel. The
Wildcats started highly regarded Tim Schweitzer on
the mound. Schweitzer, a junior, was rated the
eighth-best pitching prospect in the nation by Base
ball America. However, the lefty underwent arthro
scopic surgeiy in December, and has seen only limited
action thus far.
Making his second start of the season, Schweitzer
tossed an efficient 45 pitches, giving up only a pair of
Cardinal singles in his three innings of labor.
Stanford hurler Dan Reed looked masterful in the
early going as well. Reed struck out three of the first
six batters he faced, and allowed no baserunners in
the first two innings.
But Reed's effectiveness was short-lived as the
freshman lefthander got into some trouble in the
third. Arizona second baseman Chris Gump led off
with a triple into left field, Arizona's fourth three-bag
ger of the series. Gump then scored on a Greg Wells
grounder, with Wells safe at first by virtue of Todd
Laßocca's 11th error of the season. Two batters later,
Robbie Moen gave the Wildcats a 2-0 edge with a sin
gle to left.
Arizona tacked two more runs on the board in the
fourth when juniors Willie Morales and Todd Landry
launched back-to-back home runs to left field.
The Cardinal made it 4-1 in the fifth. Brodie Van-
Wagenen ripped his team-leading seventh double of
the season down the left-field line. The freshman
advanced to third on a Shawn Madden flyout, and
scored on a two-out single to left by Laßocca. Batting
in the No. 9 slot, Laßocca went eight for 11 in the
three game set.
But the Wildcats, who had depended upon late
inning rallies in their first two victories, delivered a
resounding knockout punch in the fifth, sending 14
men to the plate in a 10-run barrage.
And yes, Arizona's experienced offense did play a
factor in the outcome of the game, even with such a
lopsided final margin. Seven of the Wildcats' fifth
inning runs came with two outs. Designated hitter
Jason Thompson knocked in four runs in the inning
with a home run and a triple.
With the game all but over, utility men Rod Meyer
and Jimmy Noriega took the mound for Stanford.
Meyer, a right-handed junior who had never pitched in
college, tossed a scoreless seventh inning, striking out
Wildcat leadoff batter John Tejeck to retire the side.
The Wildcats, consensus preseason conference
favorites, are alone atop the division standings with a
4-2 record. Arizona State and Southern California
share second place with identical 2-1 marks, while
Stanford falls three-and-a-half games back at 0-3.
