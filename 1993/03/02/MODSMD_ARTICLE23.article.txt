# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
After a weekend jam-packed with sports
action for Cardinal fans, this week's picks
for Athletes of the Week are representatives
of two traditionally strong Stanford squads
that did not disappoint.
Sophomore Kim Shasby traveled with the
women's tennis squad to Madison, Wis. to
try to reclaim the National Team Indoor title
that the Cardinal lost last year to Florida.

Stanford cruised through the first three
rounds, efficiently dismissing Virginia (6-0),
No. 5 UCLA (6-0) and No. 7 Georgia (5-1).
Shasby, playing in the No. 3 slot,
emerged victorious over each of her oppo
nents, including Virginia's Ly-Lan Schofield
(6-3, 7-5) and Georgia's Angela Lettiere (6-
3, 6-0).
It was during the tournament finals that
Shasby'B mettle was truly tested, however,
as Stanford found itself facing the Gators
in a showdown for the championship.
The redshirt freshman from North Liber
ty, lowa was matched against Jill Brenner,
the sixth-ranked collegiate player in the
nation according to the ITA. Shasby, whose
ITA ranking climbed from No. 65 to 25 over
the fall, blasted past Brenner for an emphat
ic 6-1, 6-0 upset win.
The victory served notice that Shasby is
back in form following a knee-ligament injury
that kept her off the courts last year.

On the men's side of the coin, Michael
Flanagan keyed Stanford's victory over Cali
fornia in the Big Match.
The junior from Dallas, Texas has
climbed steadily up the collegiate tennis lad
der, and has ended his ascent on top of the
Cardinal's singles list.
On Saturday afternoon, he proved himself
worthy of the position with a 6-2, 6-3 win
over Cal's Tom Phanco, then paired up with
teammate Chris Cocotos for a 6-3, 6-1 dou

bles victory over Phanco and Anders Rolfsen.
Flanagan's past accomplishments include
a Pacific 10 Conference indoor singles title
this January and a 15-9 dual-meet record at
the No. 2 singles spot last season.
He was ranked No. 10 in the preseason
ITA poll, and will be heading a Stanford
squad that hopes to repeat last year's NCAA
championship win.
