# 'Eroticizing safe sex': Measures to tackle AIDS focus on education
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Books, bananas and bubblegum-fla
vored dental dams are an unlikely trio,
but in the hands of students and staff,
they each have been instrumental in the
fight against AIDS.
Rather than one coordinated drive, the
campus effort to promote AIDS aware
ness comes from several different sources

that have taken a
wide range of ap
proaches to tackle
the problem.
For instance,
the Human Biolo
gy Program offers
classes, Cowell

Health Center has programs and work
shops and the Safer Sex Shoppe and the
Sexual Health Center promote the use of

condoms.
Besides the few classes, though, the ap
proach most of these groups have taken is
to encourage preventive measures rather
than to focus on the disease per se.
When there is talk about AIDS, "you
hear more on safer sex," said freshman
Alyssa Cobb.
However, Cobb said she finds the em
phasis on more tangible things — such as
wearing condoms — a more effective way

to fight AIDS.
This has been the primary approach
the Safer Sex Shoppe has taken. Rather
than emphasizing AIDS itself, the
Shoppe, which is located in the Women's
Center seeks to show that safe sex and
wearing condoms can be enjoyable.
The role of the Shoppe, said Manager
Jill McDonough, is to "eroticize safe sex."
The main way the Shoppe has gone
about changing people's attitudes toward

safe sex is by offering multi-colored con
doms and other exotic items to protect
wearers from diseases.
People will be more apt to engage in
safer sex with a glow-in-the-dark nubbed
condom or a flavored dental dam, McDo
nough said.
"The shop definitely fulfills a need on
campus," said freshman Amy Hsieh, who

worked at the Shoppe fall quar
ter. "It's a really low-pressure
environment."
The Shoppe also sponsors pro
grams such as Rubberware par
ties, an hour-long "hands-on"
workshop that asks participants
to BYOB — Bring Your Own
Banana — to practice putting on
condoms.
With the promise of 10 free
condoms per visit, the Sexual
Health Center housed in Coweil
Student Health Center uses a
similar approach to send a safe
sex message.
Cowell also offers educational
programs, such as Project SAVE,
in which students are trained to
lead "AIDS 101" outreach ses
sions.
"Volunteers are trained to deal
with people's preconceived ideas,
and to handle all questions, even
the more off-beat ones," said peer
counselor Molly Phelps.
The AIDS 101 sessions are the
"first step toward awareness,"
Phelps said.
Cowell also has both regular
and confidential HIV testing.
While a doctor counsels the regu
larly scheduled HIV tests, a confi
dential service offers both pre
and post-test peer counseling.
Classes are also an integral
part of the campus effort to pro
mote AIDS awareness.
"The Impact of AIDS," which

looks at the disease from both a
biological and social standpoint,
has already affected some stu
dents.
"After taking (the class), I've
thought about getting involved in
HIV testing counseling or volun
teering at the Safer Sex Shoppe."
said junior Michelle Rothoff.
The class is "set up to rely on
a large number of guest speak
ers," said Dr. Robert Siegel, who
received a fellowship in 1986 to
design the course. "It couldn't
exist without the energy and
generosity of all these people in
the field who donate their time."
