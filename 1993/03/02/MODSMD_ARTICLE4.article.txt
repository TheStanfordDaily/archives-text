Sam Pickering doesn't get to many movies.
He didn't see "Dead Poets Society" until more
than six months after it was released in 1989.
But he was the inspiration for that movie's
John Keating — a zany, inspiring teacher
played by Robin Williams, who exhorts stu
dents to "seize the day"and search for their
inner creativity.
An English professor at the University of
Connecticut at Storrs, Pickering is visiting
Stanford this week for a series of talks with fac

you're going to get on the desk, you have to
have something in your brain," said Pickering.
"I did those kinds of things to entertain my

But Pickering said his teaching style has
changed a little with age. "I can't get up on a
desk. I'd fall off. I used to climb out the win
dow, but now I teach classes on the second
floor, so I can't do that," he said.
"What that movie is about is crushing

Sam Pickering, the teacher who inspired the film "Dead Poets Soci

"I write books about what I do, and I don't do anything," he says.
