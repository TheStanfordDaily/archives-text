# 'If you're going to get on the desk, you have to have something in your brain. I did those kinds of things to entertain myself.'
## 'Dead Poets' teacher visits campus 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Sam Pickering doesn't get to many movies.
He didn't see "Dead Poets Society" until more
than six months after it was released in 1989.
But he was the inspiration for that movie's
John Keating — a zany, inspiring teacher
played by Robin Williams, who exhorts stu
dents to "seize the day"and search for their
inner creativity.
An English professor at the University of
Connecticut at Storrs, Pickering is visiting
Stanford this week for a series of talks with fac
ulty and students sponsored by Madera and
the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Although he taught Tom Schulman, who
wrote the screenplay for "Dead Poets Society,"
Pickering said he didn't expect his student to
write movies, let alone base a character on his
teaching.
"He was 15. You never think anything
about 15-year-olds, except some are short and
fat and some are tall and skinny," Pickering
laughed. "And the short and fat ones will be
come short and skinny, and the tall and skinny
ones will become tall and fat. Being successful
requires hard work and opportunity. How can
you tell at 15 who's going to be successful?"
But Pickering shows definite elements of
Keating. Laughter and literary allusions punc
tuate his speech. With every few words, he jumps
out of his chair or makes emphatic gestures.
And he also used to stand on desks. "If
you're going to get on the desk, you have to
have something in your brain," said Pickering.
"I did those kinds of things to entertain my
self."
But Pickering said his teaching style has
changed a little with age. "I can't get up on a
desk. I'd fall off. I used to climb out the win
dow, but now I teach classes on the second
floor, so I can't do that," he said.
"What that movie is about is crushing
young people's creativity," he pointed out. "I
crush the creativity of my children all the

time. I'm a tyrant, particularly on
manners."
His three children have also
affected Pickering's teaching.
"When I get in front of a class now,
I see all the kids as someone's chil
dren," he said, in a rare moment of
seriousness. "So I want to do well
for them and help them have a
nice life. You know a lot of them
aren't going to."
Pickering said he is known at
the University of Connecticut for
"crazy" actions like riding his bike
during the snowy winters and
teaching his English classes in the
agricultural school.
"The criticism of English gets
so awfully rarified, but with the
smell of manure, sometimes
you'll have a nonsensical
thought," he said. "I love to teach
nature writing because it seems
to me we have people writing
about the meaning of life who
don't know the trees in their
backyard."
Since the movie, Pickering said,
his life has become more compli
cated, although he has resisted
change.
"People start calling you and
treating you different and asking
your advice," he said. "It knocks
you out of your ordinary orbit, but
it doesn't change that you have to
take your daughter to ballet or
your son to soccer."
"I write books about what I do,

and I don't do anything," he
chuckled. "I'm just an ordinary
person who writes ordinary books
that are popular for some reason.
Now people are writing books
about my books. I feel like I'm in
'Never-Never land'. But I'm not
Peter Pan."
His popularity also led some
Connecticut Republicans to
implore him to run for the House
of Representatives. But "I only
talked to them to gather material,"
he laughed, pointing out that
almost everything he does is essay
fodder.
"Would I want to raise three
children in Washington, or raise
them in rural Connecticut where
the sheep are being born?" he
asked. "If you're 24 or 30 why not
(run for office), but if you're 48,
there are more important things
in life — like raking leaves. I do
that every year. I couldn't do that
in Washington. I'd have to hire an
alien.
Pickering is spending his time
at Stanford studying nature, as
well as speaking to students and
attending classes. While at Jasper
Ridge on Sunday, he saw his first
banana slug, examined the texture
of tree trunks and collected mate
rial for his next essay.
He said nature may be respon
sible for Stanford's casual atti
tude. "Everyone on this campus
seems so young and innocent.
Maybe it's the short sleeves," he
said, adding that he may write an
essay about his trip here called
"Early Spring."
