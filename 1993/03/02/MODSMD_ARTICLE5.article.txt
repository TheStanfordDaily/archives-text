# Clinton unveils aid program
## Would let students repay loans with service 
### 
PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) - President
Clinton pledged yesterday to revolutionize
college aid by allowing students to repay
loans through community work.
He cast his ambitious national service
plan as a 1990s GI Bill to "change America
forever and for the better."
"All across America we have problems
that demand our common attention," Clin
ton said. "National service is nothing less
than the American way to change America."
After a pilot project of 1,000 or so stu
dents this summer, paid for with $15 mil
lion in Clinton's economic stimulus pack
age, the president proposes spending $7.4
billion over the next four years, building
from 25,000 service slots in 1994 to more
than 100,000 in 1997. Funding would

then increase in the following years based
on demand and the program's perfor
mance.
One year of service would qualify stu
dents for two years of college loans. Eli
Segal, the Clinton adviser drafting the pro
gram, said the administration had yet to de
cide on a borrowing cap.
Students could borrow first and enter
service after graduating, or enter service
after high school and accrue credits for
loans. Segal said stipends likely would be
paid at or near the minimum wage, but that
no final decision had been made.
Students who chose not to enter public
service could pay back loans based on a
percentage of their income — not the
amount borrowed — which Clinton said
would encourage graduates to enter
lower-paying but critical professions
such as teaching and working in com
munity health clinics.
The program was a centerpiece of Clin
ton's campaign, and he chose the 32nd
anniversary of President Kennedy's cre
ation of the Peace Corps to formally pro
pose it as president. Congressional
approval will be required.
The event was as much symbolism as
substance. Clinton's lofty rhetoric
aside, aides say many details are still
unclear, from how much a student
would be able to borrow to how big a
stipend to pay young people while they

work ofT their loans.
Clinton's plan is designed to dramati
cally reshape federal student aid pro
grams and offer young Americans oppor
tunities — and incentive — to perform
such community service as working in
inner-city children's health and drug clin
ics, tutoring in literacy programs and
walking streets in neighborhood police
corps.
The president himself set high expec
tations for the initiative, framing the
announcement as "one I hope will be a
truly historic moment in our nation's
history." He compared it to the GI Bill's
offer of education to servicemen return
ing from World War 11, a program that
expanded the nation's middle class.
"One of the things that we have to
realize in this country is that an eco

nomic investment is not just building an
airport or a road or investing in new
technologies," Clinton said. "It's also
investing in people."
Some union leaders have expressed
concern that the program would take
jobs away from adults and give them to
community service workers at lower
pay
But Clinton, in an interview for
broadcast last night on MTV, said that
would not happen. For example, he said,
a city hiring community service workers
as police would have to show they were
not displacing "anybody from existing
jobs."
Bankers, who would be bypassed by
the program, also oppose the idea and
are to begin a lobbying campaign on
Capitol Hill on today.
