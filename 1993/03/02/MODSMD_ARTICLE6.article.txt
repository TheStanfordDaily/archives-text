# Student group plans to send textbooks to St. Petersburg

A Stanford student organization has col
lected more than a ton of textbooks that it
hopes to ship to universities in St. Peters
burg, Russia, later this month.
Senior Charles Thuss, treasurer of Stu
dents for East European Development, said
the books, which come from various Stan
ford departments and libraries, will be do
nated to two different universities â€”
Leningrad Institute of Engineering Econom
ics and St. Petersburg University of Eco
nomics and Finance.
The logistics of the shipment, however,
have not yet been worked out. In the past,
the Smithsonian Institution has shipped the
books for the group, free of charge, but is no
longer willing to do so.
Senior Tasha Brubaker, who is coordinat
ing the shipment, estimated that sending the
2,500 pounds of books by boat would cost
about $1,000.
However, another outside group might fi
nance the operation, she said. "I'm still wait
ing to hear back from one organization, the
Center for Citizens' Initiatives. . . . They

want to send books over like we do, so they
might donate cargo space" on their boat,
Brubaker added.
This year, the ASSU Community Service
Board gave the group around $700 to help
defray shipping costs, said Thuss. If the
group is unable to find free shipping, the rest
of the money will be raised from dorm con
tributions or from members' pockets.
Brubaker said she hopes the books will be
shipped by the end of March, so they will ar
rive by the end of the school year. That way,
"the professors can work with them over the
summer," she said.
A lot of the texts being shipped are related
to business and economics, Thuss said, "be
cause those are the textbooks that people
over there don't have, as a result of the intel
lectual repression" of the Soviet govern
ment.
"(There are) some from students, some
from what the library is throwing away, oth
ers from various departments including Eco
nomics ... the Business School (and) the
English Department," he said.
This is the third year that Students for
East European Development has gathered
and sent books to Eastern Europe.
