EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH FOR
STANFORD JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES!
Undergraduate Honors Program in Education
The Stanford School of Education has an HONORS PROGRAM
that enables qualified undergraduates to engage in
EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH. Each student's work builds upon
work done in the undergraduate major department. (An
average grade of B+ in the major field is required for entry).
Usually, a psychology major works with an educational
psychologist, and a philosophy major would work with one of
the School's philosophers of education. Most undergraduate
majors can be catered to: students from engineering, biology,
and economics, as well as the more traditional educational
disciplines, have recently completed the program. Juniors and
sophomores are encouraged to apply.
There is an introductory meeting on
THURSDAY, MARCH 4TH, 7-9 p.m.
in Cubberley, room 229.
Further information and application forms are available in the
Main Office, School of Education, or from Professor McDermott
in room 327 on Tuesdays, 10:00-11:00 am.
