# Man shot in hospital parking lot
## Carjacking attempted 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
A 42-year-old Berkeley man
was shot yesterday afternoon in
the Stanford Hospital parking lot,
the victim of an attempted car
jacking.
According to Palo Alto police,
Stephen White was parking his
car on Pasteur Drive, near the
hospital's front entrance, around
2 p.m. when an assailant, armed
with a semiautomatic handgun,
approached White's car and de
manded his wallet and keys.
Refusing the suspect's de
mand, White quickly put his car
in reverse and drove over the di
vided road's grassy median. As he
tried to escape, the suspect fired
three shots through the driver's
side window, said Palo Alto police
officer Jean Krahulec. One of the
bullets hit White in the upper
chest, lodging in his right bicep.
The gunman and his female ac
complice sped away moments
later.
The victim then managed to
drive his 1985 Cadillac Cimmaron
across the median on Pasteur
Drive and to the hospital's front
entrance. Medical personnel, who

were alerted after a doctor wit
nessed the shooting and called
both police and the hospital's
emergency staff on his cellular
phone, met the bleeding White in
front of the hospital, said Medical
Center spokesman Don Gibbons.

"This guy had the wherewith
al to circle back around to the
hospital with a wound in his
chest," Gibbons said.
White, a substitute teacher
who was going to visit his mother
at the hospital, was in serious but
stable condition last night with
one bullet wound in his chest. A
hospital spokeswoman did not
know if he underwent surgery.
According to Krahulec, the

incedent probably began on the
other side of the Bay when the
victim first saw the suspects' car.
White told police that he let the
suspects' car cut in front of his at
the Dumbarton Bridge toll plaza.
He didn't see the car again until
he was driving on Arboretum
Road. White then noticed the car
following him into the parking
lot.
But Gibbons said the victim

probably never realized the sus
pects were trying to steal his car.
"He thought they were panhan
dlers until a gun was pulled on
him," the spokesman said.
The man who shot White was
a tall, thin, black male between
35 and 40 years old, said police. A
black woman drove the charcoal
colored Japanese or "Mustang
like" vehicle with a plastic-cov
ered rear window in which the

suspects fled.
Krahulec said Palo Alto police
are investigating a shooting inci
dent in East Palo Alto Monday
night in which a similar suspect
used an identical type of weapon,
a .380 semiautomatic pistol.
She said the shootings were
"related, but there is no confir
mation" of a link between the
two.
Gibbons emphasized that the

victim was followed before he
reached Stanford. "[The sus
pects] weren't staking out our
parking lot," he said.
Although Stanford officers
responded to the shooting, Palo
Alto police are continuing the
investigation because the inci
dent occurred within Palo Alto
city limits. The division between
Stanford and Palo Alto runs
through the Medical Center.
