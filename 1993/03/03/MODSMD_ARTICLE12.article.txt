# Texas cult standoff continues

### 
WACO, Texas (AP) â€” An armed reli
gious cult's leader failed to surrender as
promised yesterday, and military vehicles
surrounded his compound as a standoff
dragged on for a third night.
Authorities have confirmed that four
federal agents and at least two people
inside the compound were killed in gun
battles Sunday. But a federal official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press yesterday that at
least 10 were dead inside the compound.
Officials have said about 75 people were
in the compound, but cult leader David
Koresh has claimed more.
Eighteen children and two adults have
been released since the siege began, and
yesterday evening Bryan Gilbert,
spokesman for the state Children's Protec
tive Service, said as many as 20 more chil
dren could be released soon.

Later, several buses and minivans left
the compound, but federal agents said the
activity was merely a shift change.
In a 58-minute taped statement broad
cast earlier yesterday on Texas radio sta
tions at the FBI *8 request, the cult leader
said, "I, David Koresh, agree upon the
broadcasting of this tape to come out peace
fully with all the people immediately.
"Even a man like Christ has to meet
with unbelief," said Koresh, 33, who thinks
he's Jesus. "I am really concerned about
the lives of my brethren here and also real
ly concerned even greater about the lives of
all those in this world."
Buses and other military vehicles
moved nearer within minutes of the broad
cast's start. But hours after the broadcast
ended, Koresh had not surrendered.
Negotiations with him continued into
the night, ATF spokesman Jack Killorin

said. He said agents do not have an expect
ed time frame for the negotiations.
The siege began Sunday morning as
about 100 ATF agents raided the com
pound, seeking to serve firearms violations
warrants on Koresh.
Koresh told a radio station he had been
gravely wounded Sunday.
He began letting children out late Sun
day after a station agreed to broadcast a
statement by him. He released eight more
yesterday before his radio statement. Two
women also left, the first adults to leave the
compound voluntarily.
Sunday's assault had been planned for
months but failed when the agents encoun
tered overwhelming firepower, including at
least one .50-caliber weapon. In addition to
the four dead, 16 agents were wounded; all
were out of the hospital or reported in sta
ble condition yesterday.
