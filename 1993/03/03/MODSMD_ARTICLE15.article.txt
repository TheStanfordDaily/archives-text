## A 						worthwhile break 
### 
Haas Center Alternative
Spring Breaks give both
sides beneficial rewards

ONCE MORE, A Stanford
project has attempted to
interest students in commu
nity affairs and improvement. And
once again, the program has met
with a resounding yawn from stu
dents.
Each year, the Haas Center cre
ates projects designed to benefit
Stanford students as well as outside
communities. In past years, these
Alternative Spring Breaks have led
students to places such as Arizona,
New Mexico, Los Angeles, Oakland,
the Mohave Desert, Redwoods
National Park and East Palo Alto.
This year, even more programs are
available for student participation.
However, last year, 100 students
participated in Haas-sponsored
Alternative Spring Breaks, while to
date fewer than 90 have signed up
for this year's efforts. For students
who are still unsure of their plans for
break, the projects are worthwhile
options. The formal application
deadline has passed, but Haas Cen
ter officials have said it is not too late
to join any of these programs.
Each project can tailor itself to a
student's particular interests: for
example, for those volunteers inter
ested in the great outdoors, the
"Outdoor Education" and "Environ
mental Issues" programs are ideal
choices. The former venture will give
students the opportunity to work at
the San Mateo County Schools Out
door Education Camp. The latter
will involve field work and data col
lection in either the Mohave Desert
or the Redwoods National Park.
Other areas include "multicultural
focus" projects. The "Asian-American
Community Issues" project will allow
students to work with local agencies
to create awareness of issues facing
the local Asian-American community.
The "Native American Cross-Cultur
al Exchange" will expose participants
to Native American culture while

they perform public-service activites
on reservations in New Mexico or
Arizona.
Closer to home, students will
help combat the spectre of home
lessness by volunteering at shel
ters and soup kitchens in either
the Bay Area or Los Angeles. Not
only will those students participat
ing in these projects have an
immediate (though slight) impact
on the homelessness problem, but
they will also be able to effect long
term changes through meetings
with various policymakers.
The final two programs are
"Mental Health Issues" and "Youth
in Action in East Palo Alto." The
first program will send students to
Napa State Hospital to interact with
patients. The East Palo Alto project
is designed to help community
youths and their neighborhood.
These programs represent Stan
ford's commitment both to the
community and to its goal of resist
ing the "ivory tower effect." While
the lure of a respite from Stan
ford's hectic pace is enticing, the
Alternative Spring Break Projects
offer both that respite and tangible
accomplishments that will be
remembered long after the last
stale Spring-Break beer has been
drunk.
However, this is not to say that
the Haas Center's programs are
the only public-service opportu
nites available during break. Stu
dents who will be elsewhere, but
with free time, over break can
find information on public service
opportunities all over the country
by taking a trip to the Haas Cen
ter Clearinghouse or the Student
Volunteer Network Center.
Stanford can be busy, and stu
dents have at least a passable
excuse for neglecting community
service programs during the
quarters. However, the Haas Cen
ter has made every effort to
establish programs that provide
both a welcome rest from Stan
ford affairs and are genuinely
important to other communities.
The least students should do is
take notice.
