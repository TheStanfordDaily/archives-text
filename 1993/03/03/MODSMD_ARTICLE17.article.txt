## Differences I kept inside 
### 
IT HAPPENED BACK in 'Nam. Sum
mer of '67. Me and the rest of my unit
were on highland night patrol when
someone spotted us first. A live grenade
suddenly appeared on the ground in front
of us â€” I dove and took it in the right
thigh. Saved a bunch of my buddies, but
most of my leg ended up as fertilizer.
That's usually how I explain away my
limp.
The real story is much more boring. I
was born a few weeks premature, and so I
was in the wrong position for delivery. The
umbilical cord got all tangled up, and the
oxygen deprivation caused some brain
damage. In other words, I had a minor
stroke while I was still in the womb.
Technically, it was diagnosed as cere
bral palsy. The part of my brain which
deals with motor control was partially
but irreparably damaged. The muscles on
the right side of my body would be liter
ally uncoordinated to a degree. In addi
tion, the development of the entire right
side of my body would be retarded, and
therefore a little smaller than the left.
What did that mean, really? I would
never be able pick something off a table
with my right hand if it were smaller than
a poker chip. Typing or anything else that
took any measure of dexterity were out of
the question. My right foot would most
likely be a size or two smaller than my left.
Same with the hand, arm and leg.
But growing up, I never really thought

there was anything wrong with me. Cere
bral palsy was just something with an
important-sounding name I could brag I
had. An intelligent-sounding response when
people asked me why I limped.
But that's not usually what I told peo
ple. I told the gullible ones I had a wood
en leg. I told the really gullible ones I had
a wooden leg and a real foot.
As I got older, the lies became easier.
Twisted ankle. Old football injury. Bad knee.
Bunions. But why did I lie? Why didn't I tell
people what was different about me?
Because when I tell people the truth,
they usually wish I had lied. They had
just thought it was a sprained ankle or
something. After learning the truth they
feel uncomfortable, as if they are the first
to tell me something was wrong.
I usually don't consider myself a hand
icapped person, though. Unless there's
no open parking places. The word "hand
icapped" always evokes images of
wheelchairs and telethons. At any rate, I
think of the handicapped as people who
need help from other people to get along.
I never thought of myself as that.
But I always knew that physically,
things were a little tougher for me. My
sister always used to tell me to try not
and limp so much because it embarrassed
her to walk next to me. I was never able
to get past the basic stages of playing an
instrument. I couldn't even make the
proper salute sign in Cub Scouts.

But I never wished that my disability
would go away. Not even once.
' Who I am is who I am. Limp,
unshaven face and all. My physical defect
is a part of what I was created to be. To
deny it would be to deny myself. Sure, I
can't do certain things, but so what?
There are plenty of things I can do. And
my defects are just a little more obvious
than yours.
And most of you will agree with me.
But then why do you always think I'll get
so offended if you ask about my limp?
Because you don't understand, and you
don't really know me. And that's why I
lie.
Actually, now I get kind of miffed
when people, especially people I know
pretty well, don't ask me about the limp.
By asking, they show that they desire to
know about me, even the part of me that
might be a little uncomfortable to ask
about.
I yam what I yam. I always have been.
I always will be.
