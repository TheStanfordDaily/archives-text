## Everybody genuflect: it's religion time 
### 
WON'T YOU WORSHIP ME?
After reading the accounts of the
current raid on a "violence" cult
in Texas, I have found my new calling.
I want to be a god.
Or a goddess, as the case may be. A
Jesus Christ like our friend in Waco, I'm
afraid, is not in my repertoire. I'm
female, and besides, it would be a bit
hard to grow a beard. Leg hair, yes. Griz
zly Adams beard, no.
A Dead fan I am not.
Nevertheless, I wouldn't mind hav
ing hundreds of people at my beck and
call, donating money to my cause,
armed and dangerous, naked, flower
selling, you name it, all based on my
daily whims.
My dad always told me, "You can start
a religion, but you can't join one. Because
one way you gain money, and the other
way you lose money."
Put your hands on the TV set and feel
the power of Jesus flowing through your
veins.
I personally have never understood
religion. I grew up in a sea of Christians,
my only frame of reference, but I still
didn't get it.
I come from one of those inter-reli
gious marriages that decide to scrap the
whole concept, dooming their children to
heathendom, a future in hell and a life
without the camaraderie of well-dressed
socially acceptable children in Sunday
School.
Hold me.
And so I grew up, learning my only
moral lessons through the feeble clayma
tion of "Davey and Goliath," wondering
why I never found myself in life-and
death situations calling for my snap
knowledge of the morals to biblical sto
ries, and why my motor skills weren't
messed up like Davey's.
But after a dozen years of pathetic
Sunday-morning-TV fare, I began to
realize, with the presence of the Green
Thumb guy and his big-boy tomato
tips, that I would be continually preju

diced against for my lack of religious
training.
But what juicy tomatoes I could grow!
As a kid, my church-going friends
would ask me if I was Christian, putting
my back up against the wall. How could
they always single me out as a religious
deviant? Was it the sacrificed-goat meat
in my sandwiches? My socks without the
little lace ruffles? The candy bars I ate
during Lent?
And after shrugging my shoulders in
feigned confusion, to put me to the test,
they'd ask me if I believed in God. I would
then confidently reply, "Yes." Suddenly,
as when the Pope in his bullet-proof
p ope-mobile is showered with flowers, I
was bathed in twinkies, ding-dongs and
offers to be my best friend.
But I wasn't talking about God with a
capital "G."
My god was different than God. She
probably wouldn't choose to hang out
with God, but if she saw Him on her way
to get the newspaper every morning, I'm
sure she'd wave. My god was not exactly
your Judeo-Christian Student of the
Month.
Blasphemy. I know. I can't help it.
My ideas about god were developed
through a rigorous series of ideological
warpings at the hands of my good ol*
dad.
My dad raised me to say, "God in
Her infinite wisdom." He taught me
about the Mother Goddess. When I
should've been going to Episcopalian
services, I was being read Robert
Graves, other myths and Greek
tragedies.
For the longest time, I begged to have
my name changed to Clytemnestra.
So over the years, I created a differ
ent image of god.
I said my prayers every night to my
god. I never took my god's name in vain.
I asked my god for advice from time to
time, and for a little extra strength
when I hadn't gotten asked to my junior
Prom.

And she came through like a champion.
I imagined the joys of heaven, sitting
on lawn chairs with god at poolside. OK,
so maybe her 5-foot-2, 100-pound build
would make me a little envious, but we'd
have a good time.
As we started checking out the guys in
heaven, we'd crack jokes, drink coke and
wave to those people with harps across
the way, the ones thinking good
thoughts.
Boooooring. I'd never survive in God's
heaven.
Not that I ever had anything against
religious people, I just didn't understand
the whole thing. For years I yearned to
know their secret handshakes, prayers
and ceremonies. I wondered if those
wafers tasted good. I wanted to be a part
of it all. I wanted to get to know their
God.
I wanted to love my neighbor.
But I was always held back by the
thought of my god. She would not handle
the news very well. I must admit, she has
a bad temper like me, and I didn't look
forward to a plague of locusts or intesti
nal parasites.
So I stayed pagan.
It's not my fault. I'm not alone.
Now, however, as I sit in the liberal
atmosphere of Stanford, I find a place
where I can be happy with my god. And
though I still don't show people my altar
to Athena — being non-religious, or sac
rilegious, on the Farm is elevated to an
art form.
Oddly enough, the country's main
stream has been dammed here on cam
pus.
We don't want to see crosses unless
they're hanging around punker's
necks. No Christians. Jews are OK,
Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists ... they're
all fine, if they don't worship in our
faces.
It seems the tables have turned.
But I never had a problem with the
way the tables were before. I have my god
and you have yours. As long as you

respect mine, she and I won't bother you
and the Big Guy.
I don't see the benefits of the Stanford
environment.
I don't sweat when I see my friends
lovingly post Biblical passage on their
walls. I figure they can do their thing, and
I can do mine. And I realize that I can't
make pagan jokes in front of them, but in
the same respect they don't go around
telling me I'm condemned to eternal
damnation.
Ouch.
As much as I would be an outcast in
Mem Chu on Sunday, they wouldn't be
comfortable going along with me sacrific
ing black squirrels at the Dish. It's a
mutual ignorance.
But now, I'm thinking of scrapping
the whole thing, and starting my own
religion. Imagine, my own breakfast
drink. My own fleet of limousines to
court prospective suitors in. My own
harem of virile, hairless men in their
early 20s.
I could definitely handle that.
Advertising the faith in between
eight-track-cassette plugs for Boy
George's greatest hits. The glory, the
fame.
Pinch me.
Unfortunately, god would probably
be a little ticked off with me challeng
ing her power, cursing me with five
headed children and a loss of bladder
control.
I'm going to hell. As we speak.

Tish Williams hopes that her unsuspect
ing and docile friends are not going to
hate her forever and aren't frightened
with what's in her twisted little mind.

in my sandwiches? My socks without the
little lace ruffles? The candy bars I ate
during Lent?
And after shrugging my shoulders in
feigned confusion, to put me to the test,
they'd ask me if I believed in God. I would
then confidently reply, "Yes." Suddenly,
as when the Pope in his bullet-proof
p ope-mobile is showered with flowers, I
was bathed in twinkies, ding-dongs and
offers to be my best friend.
But I wasn't talking about God with a
capital "G."
My god was different than God. She
probably wouldn't choose to hang out
with God, but if she saw Him on her way
to get the newspaper every morning, I'm
sure she'd wave. My god was not exactly
your Judeo-Christian Student of the
Month.
Blasphemy. I know. I can't help it.
My ideas about god were developed
through a rigorous series of ideological
warpings at the hands of my good ol*
dad.
My dad raised me to say, "God in
Her infinite wisdom." He taught me
about the Mother Goddess. When I
should've been going to Episcopalian
services, I was being read Robert
Graves, other myths and Greek
tragedies.
For the longest time, I begged to have
my name changed to Clytemnestra.
So over the years, I created a differ
ent image of god.
I said my prayers every night to my
god. I never took my god's name in vain.
I asked my god for advice from time to
time, and for a little extra strength
when I hadn't gotten asked to my junior
Prom.

And she came through like a champion.
I imagined the joys of heaven, sitting
on lawn chairs with god at poolside. OK,
so maybe her 5-foot-2, 100-pound build
would make me a little envious, but we'd
have a good time.
As we started checking out the guys in
heaven, we'd crack jokes, drink coke and
wave to those people with harps across
the way, the ones thinking good
thoughts.
Boooooring. I'd never survive in God's
heaven.
Not that I ever had anything against
religious people, I just didn't understand
the whole thing. For years I yearned to
know their secret handshakes, prayers
and ceremonies. I wondered if those
wafers tasted good. I wanted to be a part
of it all. I wanted to get to know their
God.
I wanted to love my neighbor.
But I was always held back by the
thought of my god. She would not handle
the news very well. I must admit, she has
a bad temper like me, and I didn't look
forward to a plague of locusts or intesti
nal parasites.
So I stayed pagan.
It's not my fault. I'm not alone.
Now, however, as I sit in the liberal
atmosphere of Stanford, I find a place
where I can be happy with my god. And
though I still don't show people my altar
to Athena — being non-religious, or sac
rilegious, on the Farm is elevated to an
art form.
Oddly enough, the country's main
stream has been dammed here on cam
pus.
We don't want to see crosses unless
they're hanging around punker's
necks. No Christians. Jews are OK,
Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists ... they're
all fine, if they don't worship in our
faces.
It seems the tables have turned.
But I never had a problem with the
way the tables were before. I have my god
and you have yours. As long as you

respect mine, she and I won't bother you
and the Big Guy.
I don't see the benefits of the Stanford
environment.
I don't sweat when I see my friends
lovingly post Biblical passage on their
walls. I figure they can do their thing, and
I can do mine. And I realize that I can't
make pagan jokes in front of them, but in
the same respect they don't go around
telling me I'm condemned to eternal
damnation.
Ouch.
As much as I would be an outcast in
Mem Chu on Sunday, they wouldn't be
comfortable going along with me sacrific
ing black squirrels at the Dish. It's a
mutual ignorance.
But now, I'm thinking of scrapping
the whole thing, and starting my own
religion. Imagine, my own breakfast
drink. My own fleet of limousines to
court prospective suitors in. My own
harem of virile, hairless men in their
early 20s.
I could definitely handle that.
Advertising the faith in between
eight-track-cassette plugs for Boy
George's greatest hits. The glory, the
fame.
Pinch me.
Unfortunately, god would probably
be a little ticked off with me challeng
ing her power, cursing me with five
headed children and a loss of bladder
control.
I'm going to hell. As we speak.

Tish Williams hopes that her unsuspect
ing and docile friends are not going to
hate her forever and aren't frightened
with what's in her twisted little mind.

WON'T YOU WORSHIP ME?
After reading the accounts of the
current raid on a "violence" cult
in Texas, I have found my new calling.
I want to be a god.
Or a goddess, as the case may be. A
Jesus Christ like our friend in Waco, I'm
afraid, is not in my repertoire. I'm
female, and besides, it would be a bit
hard to grow a beard. Leg hair, yes. Griz
zly Adams beard, no.
A Dead fan I am not.
Nevertheless, I wouldn't mind hav
ing hundreds of people at my beck and
call, donating money to my cause,
armed and dangerous, naked, flower
selling, you name it, all based on my
daily whims.
My dad always told me, "You can start
a religion, but you can't join one. Because
one way you gain money, and the other
way you lose money."
Put your hands on the TV set and feel
the power of Jesus flowing through your
veins.
I personally have never understood
religion. I grew up in a sea of Christians,
my only frame of reference, but I still
didn't get it.
I come from one of those inter-reli
gious marriages that decide to scrap the
whole concept, dooming their children to
heathendom, a future in hell and a life
without the camaraderie of well-dressed
socially acceptable children in Sunday
School.
Hold me.
And so I grew up, learning my only
moral lessons through the feeble clayma
tion of "Davey and Goliath," wondering
why I never found myself in life-and
death situations calling for my snap
knowledge of the morals to biblical sto
ries, and why my motor skills weren't
messed up like Davey's.
But after a dozen years of pathetic
Sunday-morning-TV fare, I began to
realize, with the presence of the Green
Thumb guy and his big-boy tomato
tips, that I would be continually preju

diced against for my lack of religious
training.
But what juicy tomatoes I could grow!
As a kid, my church-going friends
would ask me if I was Christian, putting
my back up against the wall. How could
they always single me out as a religious
deviant? Was it the sacrificed-goat meat
in my sandwiches? My socks without the
little lace ruffles? The candy bars I ate
during Lent?
And after shrugging my shoulders in
feigned confusion, to put me to the test,
