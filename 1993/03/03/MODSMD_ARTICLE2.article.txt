# Clinton's service plan confuses campus

Financial aid confusion: it's not just for stu
dents anymore.
Professors, public service officials and stu
dents alike are scratching their heads over
President Clinton's vague new plan to allow
students to repay their financial-aid loans
through unpaid community service.
Under a proposal announced Monday, one
year of public service could enable a student to

repay two years worth of college loans. But
Clinton has yet to specify the amount of such
loans, and what type of service would be ap
plicable.
A second option for students choosing not to
become involved in unpaid public service
would allow them to repay their loans based on
a percentage of their incomes from a public ser
vice profession. Repayment rates would be ad
justed depending on income: lower-paid work
ers would pay a lower annual percentage, giv
ing them more time to pay back the loan.

Sophomore Dave Kuhn, chairman of Stan
ford Project on National Service says the plan
is a "little unclear."
"His proposal has a lot of holes," he said. "I
think there will be a huge fight over what it
means, whether it will be put into effect, and
who it will affect."
SPONS is a recently founded 15-member
student research group which is exploring pub
lic service options with regard to financial aid.
