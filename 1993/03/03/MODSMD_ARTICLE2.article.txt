# Clinton's service plan confuses campus

Financial aid confusion: it's not just for stu
dents anymore.
Professors, public service officials and stu
dents alike are scratching their heads over
President Clinton's vague new plan to allow
students to repay their financial-aid loans
through unpaid community service.
Under a proposal announced Monday, one
year of public service could enable a student to

repay two years worth of college loans. But
Clinton has yet to specify the amount of such
loans, and what type of service would be ap
plicable.
A second option for students choosing not to
become involved in unpaid public service
would allow them to repay their loans based on
a percentage of their incomes from a public ser
vice profession. Repayment rates would be ad
justed depending on income: lower-paid work
ers would pay a lower annual percentage, giv
ing them more time to pay back the loan.

Sophomore Dave Kuhn, chairman of Stan
ford Project on National Service says the plan
is a "little unclear."
"His proposal has a lot of holes," he said. "I
think there will be a huge fight over what it
means, whether it will be put into effect, and
who it will affect."
SPONS is a recently founded 15-member
student research group which is exploring pub
lic service options with regard to financial aid.
Robert Huff, director of the
Financial Aids Office, said he
commends Clinton for his plan,
but he's "not quite sure where to
stand."
"1 applaud Clinton for his
effort, but I'm a little worried
about jumping into a program
that we don't really know any
thing about."
Clinton aides are currently
working on the program's details,
and Congressional approval will be
necessary for financing. No date
for a final proposal has been set.
Aides have said that although
the program may provide ample
loans to cover tuition at public
institutions, the full amount of a
loan at most private colleges
would not be covered.
Nevertheless, Huff said he was
in favor of giving the pilot pro
gram a chance.
This trial program, expected to
begin this summer, will involve
approximately 1,000 students

across the country, using a $15
million fund from Clinton's eco
nomic stimulus program. Partici
pants help administer immuniza
tion programs, tutor illiterate
people, teach recreational pro
grams to students in danger of
quitting school and test neighbor
hoods for lead paint. Students
will be paid minimum wage plus a
post-service bonus of $1,000
which could be applied to educa
tion or training.
Already, SPONS is readying
for such a pilot program at Stan
ford by gathering student and fac
ulty opinion on the plan and com
piling input on what the proposal
should look like from the commu
nity through the use of surveys
and interviews on campus.
"If you're going to build a pro
posal affecting young people, you
might as well get as much infor
mation from them as possible,"
Kuhn said.
The information received by
SPONS will be taken to a series of
community conferences around
the nation, culminating in a final
conference at Stanford on April 25.
