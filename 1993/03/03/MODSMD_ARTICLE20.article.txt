## Not GIS another computer program Students learn about the future applications for geographic mapping 
### Katherine Kao 
The Geographic Information Systems
computer may not be familiar to many now,
but scientists predict that soon it will be the
major computer application in all fields deal
ing with the environment.
"If you want to work in an environmental
field in the future, you had better know
GIS," says Jennifer Johnston, a senior in
Civil Engineering. Johnston is talking about
Geographic Information Systems, the
newest type of computer application that
stores and uses data to describe places on
the Earth's surface.
Ten years ago, when first developed, GIS
were categorized as digital mapping tools,
but the applications have proved to be much
more.
In GIS, the real world consists of many
sets of data which can be individually repre
sented as "layers." For example, within the
city of Palo Alto there is a "topography
layer" which describes land elevation; a
"land-use layer" that differentiates urban,
agricultural, industrial and forest areas; and
a "city streets layer" that shows major
roads.
These layers, which a GIS stores, can all
be related using geographic locations. Using
physical location as a linking pin, GIS can
bring together many different types of infor
mation and then perform analyses in ways
that were previously impossible.
There are numerous examples of GIS'
utility. The United States Fish and Wildlife

Service used a GIS to show how a hypothet
ical pipeline in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge — located on the oil-rich
North Slope — might affect the relocation of
two herds of caribou residing there.
In the city of Palo Alto, a GIS is being
used to hold 20 layers of information includ
ing zoning areas, land uses, floouplains and
property values.
"This data will be analyzed and used to
generate maps for a five-year comprehensive
plan," said Kelly Fergusson, doctoral stu
dent in Civil Engineering and a GIS consul
tant for Palo Alto.
But Palo Alto is not the only municipal
ity to make use of the program. "As of
1990, every block of every road in every
town has been 'GlS'd,' said David Maid
ment, a visiting professor from University
of Texas, Austin.
Since GIS have the ability to address
significant global, national, local, social
and scientific problems there are many
possibilities for its commercial applica
tion. GIS have the potential to become the
computer systems specialization of the
'90s, according to many. Studies predict a
32 percent annual growth rate, and the
European market alone was valued at
$322 million in 1989.
Maidment teaches the first GIS course
ever offered at Stanford, "Introduction to
Geographic Information Systems."
Maidment, who is providing his services
free of charge, taught a similar course two
years ago in Brazil. He said he considers

the course a contribution to the Stanford
community.
The popularity of class, attended by 50
students whose majors range from engineer
ing to sociology, is proof that Stanford stu
dents are responding favorably to GIS. In
the course, students will learn to perform
geographic analysis; design, build and man
age a geographic database; and create maps
and reports.
Maidment said that GIS analyses can be
useful for tasks such as modeling the
Earth's water cycle.
GIS could also contribute politically and
sociologically by helping in land redisrict
ing, the objective of which is to guarantee
minority representation in Congress, said
Prof. Len Hochberg, an associate professor
in the Sociology Department.
Hochberg is coordinator for a GIS lab at
Stanford that studies regional systems and
social processes. Next quarter he will teach a
course titled "Spatial Systems and Social
Process."
The course explores the differentiation of
social processes through regional space
within agrarian and commercial societies.
Hochberg is researching pre-famine Ireland,
examining census data and transportation
flows to establish regional boundaries for
human interactions in a watershed.
Scientists are eagerly anticipating the
future uses of GIS.
"Its inherently interdisciplinary quality
brings together the social scientist and the
natural scientist," Hochberg said.
