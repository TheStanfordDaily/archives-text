# Students building satellite, hope to launch it off Shuttle
## 
### Nick Strauss Staff writer 
Stanford is about to embark on the
final frontier. While it may not be the
Starship Enterprise, an ambitious group
of students and faculty hope to construct
and launch an Earth-orbiting satellite
within the next couple of years.
Although other universities have con
ducted experiments in space, none have
built a satellite from scratch.
The brainchild of Aeronautics Prof.
Don Jacobs, a former Boeing vice presi
dent, the project is part of an Areonau
tics/Astronautics class. Students in the
class are divided into two teams; each is
must design a space vehicle to fulfill a
common set of mission requirements.
At the end of the quarter, designers
will present the finished spacecraft
designs to a panel of industry representa
tives, including engineers from Boeing,
Lockheed and Hughes Aircraft. Just like
a real project, a winning team will be
selected based on cost and expected mis
sion performance.
Should all go well, the winning satel
lite will become more than just a dream.
"Next year we'll get the money allocat
ed, from who knows where, and go ahead
and build the thing, check it out and fly it
off the shuttle," Jacobs said.
The satellite consists of two separate
components: the payload and the bus,
which is the basic vehicle that supports the
payload. The bus will provide such services
as electricity, communications, tempera
ture control and stabilization.
Before designing their buses, the
teams had to design an experiment to put

in the payload section.
The groups chose an experiment that
is the product of another Stanford scien
tist, Dr. Steven Tyler.
Related to projects Tyler has flown
aboard several NASA deep-space probes,
the experiment will use a Global Posi
tioning System (GPS) to measure density
and other parameters of Earth's upper
atmosphere.
GPS, sometimes called Navstar, was
developed by the Air Force as an accurate
navigation system for the military. Civil
ians also use the system for navigation
and surveying.
The GPS system is a constellation of
about two dozen satellites in high
orbit, about 11,000 miles above the
Earth's surface. The proposed Stan
ford satellite will orbit about 200 miles
up in the sky.
Tyler's study deals with the upper
atmosphere. He will use signals from
four to five GPS satellites give scientists
an insight to the composition of the
upper atmosphere.
Experimenters will measure the
GPS's radio signals as it crests Earth's
horizon. The radio signals pass
through the atmosphere, which dis
torts the signal proportionate to the
density and turbulence of the air
passed through.
Comparing the distorted signal with
the expected signal will give Tyler a
powerful view of the difficult-to
observe upper atmosphere. Scientists
hope the information may improve
meteorology and other atmospheric
sciences.
After choosing the experiment, the

teams began to design satellites to
carry it. Though different in detail,
each group's spacecraft share many
common features — one of which is the
size.
NASA operates a program called Get
Away Special for universities and small
researchers to carry payloads into orbit.
The experiments are carried on one of six
small canisters mounted inside the Space
Shuttle's cargo bay.
The canisters each cost between
$25,000 and $35,000, far less than the
next cheapest method of launching a
satellite — an expendable rocket —
which costs a couple of million dollars.
NASA sets restrictions for what the
canisters can carry: payloads must
weigh under 190 pounds and fit within
a cylinder 19 inches in diameter and 31
inches tall. They also must conform to
NASA's strict safety regulations,
require no power from the shuttle and
demand minimum astronaut involve
ment.
Taking all this into mind, each team
set out to design a satellite. Both satel
lites emerged as rough cylinders, slightly
smaller than the dimensions of the NASA
requirements.
The main bodies are covered with
solar panels. In order for the satellite to
communicate with the ground and
receive signals from GPS satellites,
designers put six antennas on the satel
lite.
Inside the cylinders are batteries to
power the satellite while awaiting
launch and during periods of darkness
when the solar arrays produce no
power.

Extending from the satellites will be
one or two booms — long thin poles
that contain a large weight on the end.
The booms keep the satellite pointed in
a roughly constant direction and pre
vent spinning and tumbling.
The teams hope that the entire pro
gram, including construction, testing
and launching will cost under
$500,000.

Once in orbit, the experi
ment will take atmospheric
measurements several times
a day.
The data will be stored in
the computer's memory for
relay down to Earth.
Every time the satellite
passes over Stanford, the
computer will download, or
send, the data and receive
new operating orders. This
communication will all be
handled by the Dish.
The downloaded data would
travel directly to Tyler's office
along university computer net
works.
Jacobs also hopes to create
a space systems lab in the
basement of the Durand
Building. Jacobs said if he
can "beg, borrow, or steal" a
vacuum chamber and a vibra
tion table, then Stanford
could build its own space
craft.
Should this project suc
ceed, Jacobs hopes for a
future of Stanford in space.
With a low cost bus designed,

it is easy to develop and fly new exper
iments.
"All we do is design and build the
flying part of it and then we have a
series of alternate payloads — so we
can have one maybe every year," said
Jacobs. "There are so many people at
Stanford who have projects they would
like to do something with."

next cheapest method of launching a
satellite — an expendable rocket —
which costs a couple of million dollars.
NASA sets restrictions for what the
canisters can carry: payloads must
weigh under 190 pounds and fit within
a cylinder 19 inches in diameter and 31
inches tall. They also must conform to
NASA's strict safety regulations,
require no power from the shuttle and
demand minimum astronaut involve
ment.
Taking all this into mind, each team
set out to design a satellite. Both satel
lites emerged as rough cylinders, slightly
smaller than the dimensions of the NASA
requirements.
The main bodies are covered with
solar panels. In order for the satellite to
communicate with the ground and
receive signals from GPS satellites,
designers put six antennas on the satel
lite.
Inside the cylinders are batteries to
power the satellite while awaiting
launch and during periods of darkness
when the solar arrays produce no
power.

Extending from the satellites will be
one or two booms — long thin poles
that contain a large weight on the end.
The booms keep the satellite pointed in
a roughly constant direction and pre
vent spinning and tumbling.
The teams hope that the entire pro
gram, including construction, testing
and launching will cost under
$500,000.

Once in orbit, the experi
ment will take atmospheric
measurements several times
a day.
The data will be stored in
the computer's memory for
relay down to Earth.
Every time the satellite
passes over Stanford, the
computer will download, or
send, the data and receive
new operating orders. This
communication will all be
handled by the Dish.
The downloaded data would
travel directly to Tyler's office
along university computer net
works.
Jacobs also hopes to create
a space systems lab in the
basement of the Durand
Building. Jacobs said if he
can "beg, borrow, or steal" a
vacuum chamber and a vibra
tion table, then Stanford
could build its own space
craft.
Should this project suc
ceed, Jacobs hopes for a
future of Stanford in space.
With a low cost bus designed,

it is easy to develop and fly new exper
iments.
"All we do is design and build the
flying part of it and then we have a
series of alternate payloads — so we
can have one maybe every year," said
Jacobs. "There are so many people at
Stanford who have projects they would
like to do something with."
