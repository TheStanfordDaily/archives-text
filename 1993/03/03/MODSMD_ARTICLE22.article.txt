# Some sage info about avoiding food poisoning

"I'll have a burger with
ketchup, mustard and some E.
coli to go, please."
NOT!
Although it may be tempting
to joke about recent cases of
food poisoning, infections stem
ming from bacteria-laden meat
at Jack in the Box restaurants
have killed three and sickened
more than 500 to date, prompt
ing renewed questions about
hygiene and food-handling at
fast-food eateries.
The Jack in the Box story:
The E. coli bacteria is no
stranger to the human body.
Everyone has the bacteria in their
intestines and usually it causes no
problems.
But if too many bacteria have
been ingested, if stomach acid
has been diluted by fluids accom
panying the food or if more food
is eaten than the stomach can
produce acid for, then not all the
bacteria will be killed.
In the infamous Jack in the Box
case, a strain of bacteria known as
E. coli 0157:H7 managed to avoid
being destroyed in the stomach by
the acid the stomach normally
secretes to kill unwanted organ
isms.
The recent E. coli sicknesses
were probably caused because

there was too much bacteria on
the food for the stomach to
destroy. Once in the colon, the E.
coli strain released toxins that
caused diarrhea, nausea, vomit
ing and, in a few cases, death.
What causes food poisoning?
According to Jack in the Box
officials, the good news is that
there are no longer bacteria
problems in their burgers.
Jumbo Jacks and other burgers
will now be cooked for two min
utes and 15 seconds, a full 15
seconds longer than before in
order to insure that any bacte
ria is destroyed. They've also
raised the temperature on their
grills.
But, if this is the good news,
it begs the question about
health conditions at Jack in the
Box prior the recent outbreak.
Why weren't burgers always
cooked long enough to kill bac
teria, and how did these random
extras get on patties in the first
place?
The main reasons for most
food-borne illnesses are poor
hygiene and improper treatment
of raw foods. E. coli and other
bacteria found originally in the
intestines or feces can infect raw
meat on contact or by contact
with hands of an infected person
that haven't been washed after
going to the bathroom.
One might conclude that the

meat sold by Jack in the Box
must have come into contact
with animal feces at some stage.
This is unsanitary, not to men
tion more than a little gross.
If tainted meat was the only
problem, Jack in the Box would
not be so culpable. But inspec
tion teams have revealed that
the chain consistently failed to
cook their meat long enough or
at temperatures high enough to
kill the bacteria.
Bacteria are temperature
sensitive and can only survive
at certain temperatures.
According to the World Health
Organization, most bacteria
responsible for food-borne ill
nesses can only survive at room
temperatures. When food is
cooked thoroughly, bacteria
will die and food poisoning
symptoms will not occur.
This month's Journal of Infec
tious Disease showed a direct cor
relation between eating a "pink
hamburger" and the incidence of
sickness due to E. coli poisoning.
Many of those sick from Jack in
the Box described their burgers as
"pink on the inside".
To avoiding getting sick you
might try to resist the urge to
order rare steaks and burgers.
Also, remember that dirty restau
rants are rife with organisms you
wouldn't want to think about, let
alone eat. Other than that: bon
appetit! (ha, ha).
