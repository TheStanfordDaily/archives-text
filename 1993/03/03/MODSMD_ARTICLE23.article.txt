# Bug dies to talk rigor mortis
## Standing, singing, plaid-wearing corpses just a myth 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: Is it true that when a (human) body dies and
rigor sets in, it would actually begin to sit up on
its own ? How long does this take ? How far up does it
actually sit? 1 have a bet riding on this question, so
the answer better be yes . . .

A: Well, given the tremendous personal stake
you have invested in my answer, I searched my
soul long and hard for a way to put this delicately:
Seeya!

Corpses — "stiffs" as well as more
flexible models — do not sit, stand,
sing, tell tales, wear plaid or other
wise deny their status as deceased.
The existentially challenged, as
those no longer with us prefer to be
dubbed, have exactly one remaining
skill which they perform with an
unwavering consistency: They lie
still.
Ergo, you lose the wager, and
your counterpart owes me 10 per
cent commission, with which I could

afford half a Froz-Fruit™ bar or a single load of laun
dry. I'm doing this for love, folks.
Rigor mortis, the "stiffness of death," is the
result of a chemical change that takes place in the
muscle fibers of the dearly departed.
In life, muscle contraction is mediated by the
motion of motor molecules, called myosin, along fil
aments composed of molecules called actin.
The general picture of contraction is as follows: In
the muscle fiber, myosin hydrolyzes bound adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) to form adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) and free phosphate, assuming a high-energy
"cocked" position in the process. The cocked myosin
head then latches onto an actin filament and gives it
a good yank, simultaneously releasing ADP.
The myosin-actin link, however, remains intact until

myosin can again bind ATP. As cellular ATP is depleted
in the hours following death, muscle fibers find them
selves increasingly locked in place, and the muscles
themselves freeze up. The corpse consequently assumes
a boardlike inflexibility — hence the slang, "stiff."
In a sense, muscle rigor is like permanent (or at
least long-term) contraction. Breaking rigor — pry
ing the gun out of the hand of an unsuccessful pre
med, for example — is about as difficult as opening
a living, resisting person's clenched fist.
Nevertheless, the contraction associated with rigor
mortis would not cause a body to sit up or otherwise
move. Even though a given muscle set (e.g. the biceps)
might be contracted, the countervailing set of muscles
(e.g., the triceps) would also be contracted, and no net

motion would result.
There are ways to get a corpse to
move, of course. Throw it. Connect
leads from a standard household
electrical outlet to opposite ends of a
muscle, chanting, "It's ... ALIVE!"
It won't be, but it will still twitch a
little, at least for the first few hours
following death.
If you've got a little more time on
your hands, you could try heating the
cadaver. In a warm environment, a
dead person's muscles will contract,

resulting in what forensic medicine hacks call the
"pugilistic stance": Many fire victims are found in a
semi-crouch with their proverbial dukes up, a pose rem
iniscent of a boxer.
Given this, one could imagine an unevenly heat
ed corpse (say, lying on a cold morgue slab with a
hot electric blanket on its abdomen) bending at the
waist and rising slightly, but it wouldn't get very
far.
Besides, such a contrived example is outside the
scope of your wager. You definitely lose.
But hey, thanks for writing.
