## Morton holds on as curtain closes 
### Kay Hong Staff writer 
Since September, it's been the
last time around for Chas Mor
ton — his senior year, his last
swim season, his last dual meet
and this weekend, his final Pacif
ic 10 Conference championship
meet. Should he perform to his
potential, the Pac-lOs will give
Morton an opportunity close his
illustrious swimming career with
a bang.
Morton began swimming at
the age of seven because "the
neighbors wanted to try it." By
the age of eight, Morton had left
the summer-league circuit
behind in order to train with a
year-round program. It was only
after he had claimed almost
every national age group record
did Morton decide that swim
ming was his calling.
"I played football until I was
12, but I didn't enjoy other
sports as much as swimming,"
Morton said. "It was something
that I was good at, and I liked
making my parents angry driv
ing me to practice every day."
When it came time to choose a
collegiate program, Morton came
to Stanford, even though, "(Car
dinal coach | Skip Kenney was
probably the coach I knew the
least about," Morton said.
He hasn't regretted the move.
Since his enrollment, Morton
has grown to appreciate the
camaraderie and training ethic
found amongst his teammates.
"It's been great," Morton said.
"It's been a completely different
dimension. I swam for myself for
so long, and I really liked the
team aspect here. I had out
grown my club program by the
time I was 14, and it was cool to
come in and get my butt ham
mered in practice by guys on my

team every day."
Morton also credits Kenney's
program with his newly-acquired
knowledge of technique and
training methods. "I really didn't
know what I was doing before I
came here," said Morton. "I just
did things because they felt right
and didn't really care why.
"I've only recently begun to
understand things that I do and
why they make me go fast. That's
one of the great things about this
program. The guys are all smart
— everyone understands the
mechanics of everything."
Apparently, Morton has
learned the mechanics of his
sport well enough to dominate at
the conference level. Last year,
Morton set conference records in
both the 200 and 400 IM en
route to Pac-10 titles in both
events.
However, Morton realizes
that his successful swimming
career may be rapidly drawing to
a close. As one of three remain
ing members of his freshman
recruiting class, Morton has seen
several classmates retire and
realizes that one day he will do
the same.
"I definitely put swimming
ahead of school during the first
couple of years, but the last year
and-a-half I've been more into
studying," admitted Morton, a
public policy major. "I guess it's
dawned on me that I need to
have something else to do."
Although Morton has an eye
set on Vanderbilt Law School, he
is reluctant to eliminate swim
ming from his future plans. "I
always said I'd keep swimming
until I quit improving," Morton
said. "Swimming completely
gives you a feeling that's hard to
get in any other sport. I can't
imagine not swimming. But I
realize that I can't do it forever."
