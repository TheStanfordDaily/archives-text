# Netters cruise as Gould earns 500th victory
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Yesterday was a typical early
spring day at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium â€” blue sky, light breeze and
a scoreboard displaying a string of
Stanford singles-match wins.
However, for Cardinal coach Dick
Gould, it was not a typical day. His
team's 7-2 victory over unranked
University of the Pacific marked
his 500 th career win, a feat accom
plished by only one other current
coach playing exclusively Division I
teams, Glenn Bassett of UCLA.
In his 27th season on the Farm,
Gould has been coaching at Stanford
longer than any other current Cardi
nal coach. "I came in young and big
eyed," he said. "I thought it'd be
easy, but I found out in a hurry that
the top guys don't want to go to a
school without a tennis tradition."
Although Stanford had not
been out of the top 10 when Gould
arrived, he went through several
rough seasons, dropping to No. 33
and losing more matches than he
won before he "got a foot in the
door" and built up Stanford's own
tennis tradition.
"You come in idealistic . .. You
have to stick to your beliefs," he
said, "And when you don't get the
recruits you want, you have to
suck it up and keep going.
"You create opportunities from
the opportunities presented to
you," he said of his highly success
ful Stanford career, which includes
12 NCAA team titles.
"I didn't really think about it
(being the 500 th win)," Gould said
yesterday."I don't think any coach
thinks about that. I was just glad

because we were playing well and
competing well."
Playing without top junior
starters Michael Flanagan and
Chris Cocotos, who were both sick,
the Cardinal (9-1) still had no prob
lem winning singles, 5-1, although
Gould was nervous before the
match.
"It's the end of the quarter and
we only have a doubles tournament
left before spring break, so it is a
natural time to let down," he said.
Robert Devens, bumped up to
No. 1, extended his undefeated
streak with a 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 win over
Adi Kremer. Vimal Patel, at second
singles, also pulled out a close 6-4,
7-5 victory over Kevin Smith.
Freshman Jeff Salzenstein tri
umphed in the third slot, 6-2, 6-4,
over Joe Gonzales, and junior Billy
Wright crushed Mauricio Sovero at
No. 4, 6-1, 6-0.
The sole singles loss came at No.
5, where senior Roman Sydorak
fell to Jorge Abreu, 3-6, 1-6. Ricky
Becker, a freshman, had a 6-0, 6-3
win at sixth against Miles Webster.
Because the match was played
in the old format, each doubles
match counted for a team point
and the matches were played as
two out of three regular sets.
A lineup change resulted in
Devens and Patel pairing up in the
top doubles slot, where they won,
6-3, 6-3. "They did a pretty good
job at shot selection," Gould said.
"That's what I'm most concerned
about right now."
Wright and Sydorak were defeat
ed by Tigers Sovero and Arreu, 6-3,
6-1, but Becker and Salzenstein
crushed Smith and partner Sean
Martin, 6-2,6-2.

Dick Gould became only the second active coach to reach the 500-win
plateau yesterday. 'The most fun part of It has been the kids," he said.
