# Batters win

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Cardinal scored 10 runs in the final two
innings yesterday, defeating the University of San
Francisco, 11-4 and snapping a four-game losing
streak. With the win, Stanford improved to 11-6
overall, while the Dons slipped to 3-9.
"No doubt about it, today's win was important,"
said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "The past four
games have been rough."
The Cardinal had been outscored 56-25 in four
road losses at Santa Clara and Arizona last week, and
needed a solid performance from freshman Todd
Bartels to turn things around.
Bartels toiled for his best effort of the season,
going six innings and giving up a pair of earned runs
and five hits.
Still, Stanford was down 4-1 and in danger of losing
its fifth straight entering the seventh. With one out
and Cale Carter and Jed Hansen aboard, Dusty Allen
laced an RBI single off the glove of Don second base
man Rob Hanke, bringing the Cardinal within two.
With two outs and the score tied at four, Brian
Dallimore knocked an 0-1 pitch into the hole between
shortstop and third base, giving Stanford a 5-4 lead.
The Cardinal sealed its victory in the eighth. With
one out, A.J. Hinch fisted a double into right field for
his third hit of the game. Hinch, who got Stanford on
the board in the second with a solo home run, has hit
.429 in his last seven games.
"I feel like I've settled into a groove," said the
freshman catcher. "I've begun to relax and play my
own game. At the start of the season, I was trying to
do a lot more than I should have for the team."
Dallimore made the score 8-4 with a single to right
field and scored on a wild pitch from USF's William
Jones.
Rod Meyer closed out scoring in the frame by con
necting for the first home run — and first hit — of
his Stanford career, a two-run blast that gave Stan
ford an 11-4 lead.
Freshman Mario Iglesias shut down the Dons over
the final three innings, allowing no runs and striking
out three in earning his first career victory.
"This was our best pitching performance in the
last few games," Marquess said. "Bartels and Iglesias
pitched a little tentatively against Arizona, but both
were more effective today."
"It's nice to get back on the 'W' side again after
last weekend," Hinch said. "We have an expectation
level for ourselves that's a lot higher than anyone
else has for us."
The Cardinal will get a chance to test those high
expectations very soon, facing USC on the road next
weekend. The Trojans were picked to finish second
in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.
