I was told, by those more famil
iar with the genre of sports
travel than I, that I had truly
not experienced a Stanford road
trip until I had ventured to the
Palouse. Well I'm back, and lived
to tell about it.
No, I don't have any Cameron
Mackey horror stories to relay.
But I did come away from this past
weekend's jaunt to the Pacific
Northwest with the basketball
team knowing one thing: I've seen
Pullman, and once is enough.
Unfortunately, due to the
omnipotence of the Pacific 10 Con
ference schedulers, we visited
Washington rather than Washing
ton State first, so only one day was
spent in Seattle. Instead, we got to
spend two days in bustling
Spokane, metropolis of the Ever
green State. Lucky us.
Spokane is a throwback to the
Americana of old. As we pulled in,
it seemed as if I was walking on the
set of Back to the Future.
There were smoke shops, coffee
shops and corner stores. Many of
the same signs that had been put
up when these places first opened
were still there with the original
lettering.
The quintessential establish
ment of Spokane had to be "Thad
deus T. Thudpuckers," a cowboy
type joint where several of us ven
tured for lunch on Friday. This
was backwoods barbecue at its
best. No California cuisine here.
There was red meat, and plenty of
it. Now, Thaddeus T's claim to
fame is its renowned "Outlaw Spe
cial." It's the special because
under the wanted sign, serious
eaters are called upon. The Outlaw
costs $35, and must be ordered a
day in advance. It consists of a
staggering eight pounds —yes,
eight pounds — of food. Included
in this monstrosity are:
• Three chicken-fried steaks on
a gigantic plate, juxtaposed on
each side by heaping piles of
mashed potatoes;
• A salad that could ordinarily
feed 10 people, delivered in a bowl
12 inches wide and 7 inches deep;
• An entire cherry pie
If you can eat it, the owner gives
you a $250 reward. And T-cubed is
right: you must be some kind of
rogue if you can polish this thing ofT.
The members of our party conferred
around the table, and not even wide
receiver/forward Justin Armour
thought he could do it. This should
not be taken lightly, for when it
comes to eating, the basketball team
is hardly full of slouchers. Jason
Weaver, your calling has been found.
The weather was consistent in
Spokane — consistently cold. The
high for Friday was 27°F; the low

was negative two. But that was
OK. Our purpose was to play bas
ketball, an indoor sport. After all,
Dr. Naismith invented the game so
athletes would have something to
do in the winter months. I'd take a
musty old gym over Spokane tem
peratures any day. Well, maybe not
on any day, but at least on this one.
On Saturday morning we set
out on the bus ride every team in
the league dreads. Once we headed
south for Pullman, there was noth
ing in between. About halfway
through the busride, KFRC com
mentator Tim Liotta said it best
when he observed, "We have
achieved nowhere. This is it." In

fact, if something had gone wrong
with our bus, we would have had as
much of a chance finding help as
The Naked Guy has in finding
clothes — none whatsoever.
Upon arrival at Wazzu's Friel
Court, there were still two-and-a
half hours until game time. But at
the two-hour mark, students start
ed pouring in to fill up the student
section. Heck, the only thing for
them to watch was Liotta and me
playing H-O-R-S-E, and, to put it
mildly, I'm no Patrick Ewing.
Obviously, they had nothing bet
ter to do on a Saturday afternoon,
but then again after seeing Pullman
this was probably the best thing to
do. Yet I soon realized their purpose:
just as a team does warmups, so, in
their case, did they. They began by
heckling my shooting, a task which
is as easy as heckling Sinead O'Con
nor's haircut. By the time the Cardi
nal came out to shoot around, the
Cougar supporters were in prime
form, which they merely escalated
after tipofT, especially since their
team blew Stanford out.
As we bused into the night, I
marveled at how people could
enjoy constant cold and being so
secluded from a big city. But then
I grinned, knowing that I was not
the first, nor the last, sportswriter
to be ridiculed at Washington
State after shooting a brick from
the top of the key.

David Schwartz cannot believe thai
his beloved Cubs chose Hillary Clin
ton to throw out the first ball on open
ing day at Wrigley Field. Mike Ditka
would have been a better choice.
