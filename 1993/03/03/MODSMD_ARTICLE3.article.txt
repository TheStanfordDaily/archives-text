# Row robbers arraigned
## Italiana burglars arrested 
### Mary Anne McConnel 
Two Foothill College stu
dents arrested by Stanford
police in connection with a
break-in at Casa Italiana late
Friday night were arraigned
yesterday on charges of bur
glary and possession of
stolen property.
David Sugarman, of Palo
Alto, was released on the
condition of supervision. But
the other suspect, Mark
Davis, a Menlo Park resi
dent, remains in custody at
Santa Clara North County
Jail. A preliminary hearing
has been set for March 8.
Around midnight Friday,
the two 19-year-olds appar
ently broke in to Casa Ital
iana after a false fire alarm
was sounded, said Stanford
police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
While the residents of 562
Mayfield waited outside, the
two suspects entered several
rooms and supposedly stole a
small amount of cash, credit
cards and a 35mm camera
lens, he said.
Several of the residents
witnessed the suspicious duo
exiting a room and followed
the suspects out of the
house.
"The students figured
that something was up,"
