# 'An ideal commencement speaker'
## Sen. Feinstein to address grads 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one of
California's first two female U.S.
senators and a Stanford alumna,
has been chosen as this year's
commencement speaker, Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper has announced.
"Senator Feinstein combines
all the qualities of an ideal com
mencement speaker," Casper
said in a statement. "She is a
leader in many senses of the
word: a pioneer, a person of au
thority and influence. She pos
sesses both high intellect and
down-to-earth realism. And she
is, we can be proud to say, a Stan
ford graduate."
Feinstein, who graduated
from Stanford in 1955, was se
lected as speaker for the Univer
sity's 102 nd commencement by
Casper from a long list of candi
dates drawn up by the four se
nior class presidents.
"It was a significant list . ..
not as large as the Stanford ap
plicant pool or the freshman
class, but enough to give Casper
some choice," said Jean Fetter,
Casper's special assistant.
According to senior class
president Jason Dicks, the list
included a "broad-based" group
of people, many of whom were
minorities and women from all
different fields and political cir
cles.
Students, faculty and admin
istrators alike were enthusiastic
about Casper's choice of Fein
stein.
"We're really pleased. This is
definitely a choice that will be
well received by the senior
class," Dicks said. He added that
in informal surveys of the class,
Feinstein was a favorite for com

mencement speaker.
Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody said the senator
was an ideal choice. "She's some
one who holds high political of
fice and she should have some in
teresting things to say."
After Feinstein graduated
from Stanford, her work as an
intern specializing in criminal
justice led then-Gov. Edmund
Brown to appoint her to the Cal
ifornia Women's Board of Terms
and Parole. In 1969, she was
elected to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and even
tually became board president.
After the assassination of
then-Mayor George R. Moscone
on Nov. 27, 1978, the board
voted Feinstein mayor of San
Francisco. She was re-elected
twice.
In the 1990 race for Califor
nia governor, Feinstein, the de
mocratic nominee, narrowly lost
to then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson.
