# 'An ideal commencement speaker'
## Sen. Feinstein to address grads 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one of
California's first two female U.S.
senators and a Stanford alumna,
has been chosen as this year's
commencement speaker, Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper has announced.
"Senator Feinstein combines
all the qualities of an ideal com
mencement speaker," Casper
said in a statement. "She is a
leader in many senses of the
word: a pioneer, a person of au
thority and influence. She pos
sesses both high intellect and
down-to-earth realism. And she
is, we can be proud to say, a Stan
ford graduate."
Feinstein, who graduated
from Stanford in 1955, was se
lected as speaker for the Univer
sity's 102 nd commencement by
Casper from a long list of candi
dates drawn up by the four se
nior class presidents.
"It was a significant list . ..
not as large as the Stanford ap
plicant pool or the freshman
class, but enough to give Casper
some choice," said Jean Fetter,
Casper's special assistant.
According to senior class
president Jason Dicks, the list
included a "broad-based" group
of people, many of whom were
minorities and women from all
different fields and political cir
cles.
Students, faculty and admin
istrators alike were enthusiastic
about Casper's choice of Fein
stein.
"We're really pleased. This is
definitely a choice that will be
well received by the senior
class," Dicks said. He added that
in informal surveys of the class,
Feinstein was a favorite for com

mencement speaker.
Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody said the senator
was an ideal choice. "She's some
one who holds high political of
fice and she should have some in
teresting things to say."
After Feinstein graduated
from Stanford, her work as an
intern specializing in criminal
justice led then-Gov. Edmund
Brown to appoint her to the Cal
ifornia Women's Board of Terms
and Parole. In 1969, she was
elected to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and even
tually became board president.
After the assassination of
then-Mayor George R. Moscone
on Nov. 27, 1978, the board
voted Feinstein mayor of San
Francisco. She was re-elected
twice.
In the 1990 race for Califor
nia governor, Feinstein, the de
mocratic nominee, narrowly lost
to then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson.


Dianne Feinstein
But last November she was elected
as a California representative to
the U.S. Senate, becoming one of
the first two women ever to hold
that position. Feinstein now occu
pies a seat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Brody also noted that, as Stan
ford has had more male speakers
than female in the past, "It's good
to get a gender balance."
Recent commencement speak
ers have included modern art
authority Kirk Varnedoe in 1992,
Haas Centennial Professor of
Public Service John Gardner in
1991 and "Doonesbury" cartoon
ist Garry Trudeau in 1989.
Many say that Feinstein's posi
tion as a successful woman in pol
itics makes her a good role model
for students.
"Having a woman speaker is
important," said Britt Wahlin, a
sophomore who was active in
Anna Eshoo's campaign last fall.
"Now that the elections are over,

people think that women have
made their gain. This is a good
reminder that women have a long
way to go and to recognize some
one who's doing well."
But Deborah Castler, president
of Stanford Democrats said Fein
stein "is a role model for both men
and women," regardless of gender
or political affiliation. "She exem
plifies the heights we can attain in
public service."
Many are also pleased because
Feinstein is a well-known person
ality. Students in previous years
have complained that commence
ment speakers were not promi
nent figures.
In addition, many say Fein
stein is an especially appealing
choice because she is a Stanford
graduate. In her time here, Fein
stein, a history major, was elected
president of Roble Hall, 1953
Quad yearbook queen and 1954
vice-president of the ASSU.
"I think it's wonderfully appro
priate. Feinstein is a pioneer in
what she's done and a nice role
model for Stanford students as a
Stanford alum," Fetter said.
