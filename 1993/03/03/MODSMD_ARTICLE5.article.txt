# Stanford AIDS researchers focus on treatment

Doctors at Stanford's Center for AIDS
Research are trying to help a million sick
people — one at a time.
According to Dr. Thomas Merigan, pro
fessor of infectious diseases and director of
the center, over 1,000,000 Americans are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS. And because the virus is able to
change itself within each individual patient
to resist treatment, the Stanford research
team is working on ways to individualize

and expand treat
ments, giving doc
tors new ways to
prolong the life of
each AIDS patient.
The new treat
ments are being de-

veloped in an out-of-the-way corner of the
Medical Center, where Stanford's AIDS re
search lab is located. Funded by the Nation
al Institutes of Health, Stanford's center is
one of only 11 such centers in the country,
Merigan said.
The center — which cost about $3 mil

lion — opened five years ago, and contains
areas for both laboratory and clinical re
search, which ranges from trying to im
prove existing drugs to fighting the diseases
that accompany AIDS.
"The doctors need more tools, and we're
one of the places to supply those tools,"
Merigan said. "That's really what we can do
at the Medical Center, is sort of set the pace
on new strategies."
While doctors working at the center look
into many different aspects of the disease,
they have a common link — their research
largely involves finding ways to treat pa

tients with AIDS, instead of looking for a
cure for the disease.
"Right now, the problem in the United
States is to treat the million-plus people
that are infected . . . that's our goal," Meri
gan said.
"Therapy has really improved the lives of
people with HIV infections," he added.
"We've extended the life a few years — but
we want to extend it many years."
Dr. Terrence Blaschke, a pharmacology
professor who works with the center, said

effective treatments for AIDS are
more feasible than a total cure
because the virus locates in the
genetic codes of individual cells,
where it's hard to isolate and kill.
"Personally, I think it's highly
unlikely that we'd come up with a
cure for a virus that's sitting in
the patient's genome," he said.
Currently, Blaschke is work
ing on ways to improve AZT, one
of the leading drugs used to treat
AIDS. One problem with AZT, he
said, is that the drug has trouble
penetrating the blood-brain bar
rier to reach AIDS viruses in the
central nervous system. Those
viruses affect the nervous system
in about half of patients with

advanced cases of AIDS, causing
problems including dementia.
Blaschke is trying to find
drugs that will help AZT more
completely penetrate the nervous
system.
"It's an important area. It's
frustrating that there's a lot of
work to be done . . . but there's a
sense in the need to work on what
remains a big problem," he said.
"Making the drugs that we do
have already more useful, that's
been a lot of fun."
While Blaschke works on the
internal aspects of AIDS, Dr.
Marvin Karasek is battling the
disease's more visible symp
toms. A professor of biochem
istry in dermatology, Karasek is
investigating skin infections
that often accompany AIDS,
such as Kaposi's sarcoma — red

growths of blood vessels on the
skin.
"It's tough enough to have this
disease (AIDS), but when you
have the expression of the disease
. . . it's often very psychologically
disturbing" to patients, who can
lose interest in life, he said.
Karasek hopes that by study
ing the disease, he will be able to
find out more about how both
AIDS and its accompanying skin
conditions work, which will aid
treatment.
And the center's research
stretches far beyond these
efforts. Stanford, for example,
was involved in developing AZT,
ddl and ddC, the three main
drugs now used to treat AIDS.
Geographically, research has
stretched far beyond the Stanford
campus. One Stanford faculty

member — Dr. David Katzen
stein — is currently in Zimbabwe,
setting up a clinic to test vaccines
against the AIDS virus.
While the doctors work on
treatments for people with AIDS,
they said prevention of AIDS is
crucial to fighting the disease.
"I believe there's an impact
from education," especially in the
gay community, Blaschke said.
However, he said a recent UCLA
survey showed "the impact was
not as large as we might hope
among young, well-educated col
lege students."
"I think we've had a little
decrease" in new HIV cases due
to education, said Merigan. "On
the other hand, the virus takes
advantage of ignorance. ...
That's why we have to educate
our young people."
