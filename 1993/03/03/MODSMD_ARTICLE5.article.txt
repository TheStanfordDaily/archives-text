# Stanford AIDS researchers focus on treatment

Doctors at Stanford's Center for AIDS
Research are trying to help a million sick
people — one at a time.
According to Dr. Thomas Merigan, pro
fessor of infectious diseases and director of
the center, over 1,000,000 Americans are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS. And because the virus is able to
change itself within each individual patient
to resist treatment, the Stanford research
team is working on ways to individualize

and expand treat
ments, giving doc
tors new ways to
prolong the life of
each AIDS patient.
The new treat
ments are being de-

veloped in an out-of-the-way corner of the
Medical Center, where Stanford's AIDS re
search lab is located. Funded by the Nation
al Institutes of Health, Stanford's center is
one of only 11 such centers in the country,
Merigan said.
The center — which cost about $3 mil

lion — opened five years ago, and contains
areas for both laboratory and clinical re
search, which ranges from trying to im
prove existing drugs to fighting the diseases
that accompany AIDS.
"The doctors need more tools, and we're
one of the places to supply those tools,"
Merigan said. "That's really what we can do
at the Medical Center, is sort of set the pace
on new strategies."
While doctors working at the center look
into many different aspects of the disease,
they have a common link — their research
largely involves finding ways to treat pa

tients with AIDS, instead of looking for a
cure for the disease.
"Right now, the problem in the United
States is to treat the million-plus people
that are infected . . . that's our goal," Meri
gan said.
"Therapy has really improved the lives of
people with HIV infections," he added.
"We've extended the life a few years — but
we want to extend it many years."
