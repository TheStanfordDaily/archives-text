# Profs, urge cautious use of military force

The United States should ex
ercise its military power cau
tiously in foreign conflicts, Stan
ford's international policy ex
perts said last night to a full
house at Campbell Recital Hall.
"There's pressure to use mili
tary force where force might not
be appropriate (in foreign con
flicts)," said Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Stanford political science
Profs. David Abernethy, Stephen
Krasner, Rice, and Hoover Fel
low James Morrow comprised the
panel, which responded to ques
tions posed by both the 130-mem
ber audience and moderator
Scott Moss, a sophomore.
Public opinion is a weighty
consideration in any U.S. inter
vention into foreign affairs, panel
members said.
"The tolerance of the Ameri
can public for involvement not di
rectly related to national security
is not too high," Krasner said.
"Just look at how quickly Bush's
support evaporated after the Gulf

War."
Rice noted the tendency to
inflate goals in conflicts. "Look
at Iraq: We went in opposing the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and
we end up wanting to dismem
ber Iraq and overthrow Hus
sein."
The panel agreed on the need
to keep goals modest. "Anybody
with a reasonable amount of
sense would stay clear of the
conflict (in Bosnia)," Morrow
said. "Europe is full of these sit
uations, and when you pick your
side, you realize that there are a
lot of bad guys on both sides.
What you have is a lot of excuses
for atrocities and personal
vendettas."
Although the panel did not
suggest specific intervention
policies for the conflict in the for
mer Yugoslavia, they expressed
concern about the ramifications
and proliferation of "ethnic
cleansing." They dismissed the
idea that Serbia's stance of ethnic
suppression is comparable to that
of Nazi Germany's.
Still, the group praised U.S.
objectives in Somalia, though they
also said the U.N. must be prodded
to take the reins. Also, the experts
suggested providing Russia with
advice on the development of an
economy favorable to agrarian and
small-business interests.
But in general, Rice, a senior
foreign affairs adviser to former
President George Rush, espoused
the need for presidential control, as

opposed to U.N. control, of com
mand and withdrawal when involv
ing U.S. forces. Rice has also served
as the National Security Council's
senior director for Soviet affairs.
The group pointed out the lack
of precedence for many current
foreign policy situations. "There
are now a lot of countries faced
with internal crises, and they
don't know how to respond,"
asserted Abernethy. "As for out
side intervention, there's no legal
basis since it's outside post-WWII
foreign policy philosophy, nor do
we know if it's helpful. We're all
clueless on what to do."
