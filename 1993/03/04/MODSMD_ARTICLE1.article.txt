# Shooting 'too close to home'

### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Stanford Police say Tuesday's
attempted carjacking that ended
in the shooting of an Oakland
man was "too close to home."
The attack, which took place in
the entrance to Stanford Hospi
tal, was the first attempted car
jacking near Stanford and one of
only three in Palo Alto.
Stanford and Palo Alto usually
do not have serious crimes like
this one, said Palo Alto Police Lt.
Hart Nett, adding that the at
tempted carjacking was probably
a random, isolated incident.
Still, several students ex
pressed concern yesterday about
the violent crime that broke the
Farm's bucolic charm.
"It's frightening. It makes you
paranoid that you're not safe in
your car anymore," said freshman
Joe Perez.
Suzanne Moller, also a fresh
man, said the carjacking made her
feel uneasy. "It seems like the
threat of crime is coming closer
and closer," she said.
Jeremy Bender — director of
SURE Escort Service, which pro
vides safe rides for students on
campus at night — said he
thought the carjacking attempt
was "an unusual event"and not a
sign that campus crime was in
creasing. He did, however, say it
was a reminder that the real world
sometimes invades Stanford's
ivory tower.
"I don't think Stanford is an
isolated community, entirely,"
Bender said. "People may come on
campus whose intentions we
don't entirely agree with."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Neimeyer pointed out that car
jackings are on the rise every
where — including the Peninsula,
East Palo Alto, San Jose and San
Francisco.
Stanford's first encounter with
the newly popular crime came
around 2 p.m. Tuesday. Stephen
White was parking his car on Pas
teur Drive when an assailant de
manded his keys and wallet.
When the 42-year-old White re
sisted, the assailant shot three
bullets at the car, one of which
wounded White in the chest.
Palo Alto Police, who are
investigating the shooting, said
they have not yet apprehended
the gunman and his accomplice.
"We don't have any specific
information as to who the sus
pects are," said Nett. But "we
have a couple of witnesses that
can identify [them]."

Police said the gunman was a
tall, thin, black male between 35
and 40 years old, with a clean
shaven, pock-marked face. The
car was driven by a 30 to 35-year
old black female.
White's condition was upgrad
ed from serious to fair yesterday.
Although the shooting occurred
on the Stanford campus, it took
place in a section of the Medical
Center falls under the jurisdiction
of the Palo Alto Police. "Just a few
more feet and this could have been
ours," said Neimeyer.
