Stanford Police say Tuesday's
attempted carjacking that ended
in the shooting of an Oakland
man was "too close to home."
The attack, which took place in
the entrance to Stanford Hospi
tal, was the first attempted car
jacking near Stanford and one of
only three in Palo Alto.
Stanford and Palo Alto usually

threat of crime is coming closer

campus at night — said he

was "an unusual event"and not a
sign that campus crime was in
creasing. He did, however, say it
was a reminder that the real world
sometimes invades Stanford's
ivory tower.
"I don't think Stanford is an
isolated community, entirely,"
Bender said. "People may come on
campus whose intentions we
don't entirely agree with."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Neimeyer pointed out that car
jackings are on the rise every
where — including the Peninsula,
East Palo Alto, San Jose and San
Francisco.
Stanford's first encounter with
the newly popular crime came
around 2 p.m. Tuesday. Stephen
White was parking his car on Pas
teur Drive when an assailant de
manded his keys and wallet.
When the 42-year-old White re
sisted, the assailant shot three
bullets at the car, one of which
