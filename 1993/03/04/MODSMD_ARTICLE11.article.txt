Texas seige drags on
WACO, Texas (AP) — Federal agents
appeared to settle in yesterday for a long
wait to the end of a standoff with a heavily
armed religious cult whose leader claims
he is waiting for God to tell him what to do.
As the seige continued for a fourth day,
officials said Branch Davidian leader David
Koresh might have more than 100 follow
ers and a "massive weapons cache" inside
his fortified compound.
Negotiations continued yesterday in
this seige which has left perhaps 14 people
dead, authorities said. A day earlier, Kore
sh had promised to immediately, peaceful
ly end the deadlock after a taped statement
he made was played on radio stations.
"Koresh refused to honor his promise

and has indicated he will keep his promise
to come out when he receives further
instruction from God," said FBI Agent Jef
frey Jamar.

TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) —
Bosnian civilians, hungry despite air

At least 18 people were reported killed
in the eastern enclave of Konjevic Polje
when they tried to collect food and
medicine dropped by U.S. planes. An
unconfirmed Bosnian news report said
1,400 people were missing and feared dead
in nearby Cerska.
