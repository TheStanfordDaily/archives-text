# Democrats add to budget cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House and conservative House Democrats
reached a consensus yesterday to add
spending cuts to President Clinton's
deficit-reduction package — but only those
they believe can muster mtyority support.
One possibility some conservatives are
pursuing involves limiting annual cost-of
living increases in benefit programs, except
Social Security, to one percentage point
below the rate of inflation.
The strategy, which emerged from a
meeting between lawmakers and White
House Budget Director Leon Panetta,
could head off a possible rebellion by fiscal
ly conservative Democrats who want Clin
ton's package to cut spending by more than
he has proposed.
"We don't want to slow down the whole
package," said Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn.,
one of the conservatives who attended the

private session.
Panetta said he had invited those
Democrats to submit "real, specific propos
als that ultimately have to be doable. It
doesn't do us a lot of good to put a lot of
specifics on the table, then ultimately not
be able to get it passed."
Penny said that ideally, conservatives
would like to see additional spending cuts
totaling about $10 billion in fiscal 1994,
which begins Oct. 1, and about $60 billion
over the next four years.
In other developments yesterday affect
ing Clinton's plans:
• Senate Democrats rejected a Republi
can effort to require deeper spending cuts
to pay for an extension of jobless benefits.
The Senate defeated the proposal on a 57-
43 party-line vote.
• Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala, testifying before the House

Budget Committee, said the president's
stimulus package includes $500 million for
a summer version of the Head Start pre
school program.
• Transportation Secretary Federico
Pena said the administration wants to use
the entire 14.1-cents-per-gallon federal
gasoline tax for highway construction,
including the 2.5 cents now designated for
deficit reduction.
• Three Democratic lawmakers said
they were introducing a bill to raise the 24-
cent federal tax on cigarettes to $1 a pack
and use the money for health care.
• Liberal lawmakers introduced a bill
they said would create universal health
coverage for Americans in two years by
raising taxes, eliminating private insur
ance and having the government pay all
bills. The administration wants to keep pri
vate insurers involved.
