Direct-line telephones
mean a safer campus,
more secure students

According to Stanford
Police statistics, there has
only been one rape on campus
in the last four years — certainly no
crime wave.
However, this figure ignores the
certainly considerable number of
rapes that have occurred but gone
unreported. Also, past tranquility
does not always ensure future calm
— criminals don't make reserva
tions.
Therefore, it is prudent to plan
for the worst and hope for the
best. Establishing a network of
lighted, direct-line phones around
campus, all connected solely to the
Stanford Police, would be an effec
tive and necessary method to
ensure that rapes never do become
a severe problem around campus.
Although this issue has been
debated in the past, it is time to
focus attention on it once again,
because the measures taken so far
have been inadequate.
The University recently installed
eight pay phones in scattered loca
tions around campus. Yet several of
these phones are nearly hidden from
sight and, in any event, require dial
ing — something which takes often
vital seconds. These are seconds that
an attack-victim doesn't have.
Interspersed around campus,
new, direct-line phones could imme
diately send a signal to the Stanford
Police if their receivers were dis
turbed. In addition, a light could be
mounted atop each phone, which
would both improve a phone's visi
bility and flash if the receiver was
picked up.
Currently, students walking
across campus must traverse vast
stretches of the Farm that hold no
public phones, safe-houses or other
means for a threatened student to
summon help. At best, this is negli

gent; at worst, it is criminal. A
nighttime walk along one of these
routes is often an exercise in anxi
ety, as students know there would
be no way to summon help if they
were to be attacked. This climate of
fear has no place at Stanford. But it
will remain, as long as students feel
unsafe walking around campus at
night.
However, this vicious circle of
fear would give way to one of safety
if the phones were installed. Adding
single-line phones and thereby fos
tering a safer atmosphere would
allow more people to go out at night,
which in turn would create a safer
environment — an example of posi
tive thought leading to positive
effects.
The health and safety of its stu
dents should be the University's
primary concern. Stanford should
not take the security of its campus
as a given, especially when attempt
ed caijackings are happening on it.
Even an area that has been safe in
the past, such as Stanford, can
never be deemed permanently
crime-free.
There is absolutely no reason
why single-line phones should not
or cannot be installed. The cost,
while not miniscule, is by no means
extreme; the phones will not ruin
the decorum of the University; and
it would not be a major undertaking
to install phones in a few heavily
traversed locations, such as along
Santa Teresa Street, the corners of
the Quad, and along Mayfield
Avenue.
Or, instead of being solely linked
to the Stanford Police, perhaps the
phones could feature both a "police
switch," which would send an alarm
to police headquarters, and a con
ventional keypad from which a stu
dent could call SURE Escort Service
or any other on-campus number.
The addition of the phones would
not be a cure-all to Stanford's crime
problems, but it would directly help
ameliorate the problem itself and
have even more striking indirect
affects on student morale.
Even one rape every four years is
too many.
