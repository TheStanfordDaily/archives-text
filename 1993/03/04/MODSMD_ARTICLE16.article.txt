## Does Stanford really care? 
### 
I READ THE NEWSPAPER on Mon
day and I wanted to scream. FBI
shoot-out leaves several dead and
wounded. Seven children die in fire in
Detroit. United States threatens to leave
Somalia. FBI officially declares bomb in
World Trade center. State school budget
cuts. Unemployment. Homelessness.
Neo-Nazi resurgence. We are at a world
systemic crisis level, and what are we
doing about it?
The foundation of this country and
world is falling apart, but you wouldn't
know it at Stanford. Just a quick walk
outside in beautiful Stanford or sunny
Palo Alto, and the grass is green, the sun
is shining and all is well on the Western
frontier. Well, I'm telling you right now,
we need to start taking things a lot more
seriously because a time bomb is ticking,
and it will soon take care of all of us if we
don't get our act together.
What time bomb? The time bomb is a
social, economic, political and education
al catastrophe on the local, state and
national level and what is Stanford doing
about it? Not a god damn thing.
For instance, East Palo Alto has the
highest homicide rate per capita than any
other city in the country. There are no
high schools there and unemployment is
soaring. And just down "University
Avenue" these so-called experts and
researchers in economics, psychology,
philosophy, history and public policy
have yet to collectively get together and

do anything about it.
It is criminal to profess to be one the
top schools in the world and at the same
time not be able to understand these sys
temic problems, create solid plans of
action, and together with students start
finding some answers and cures.
I know a lot of students do care and
have been spending a lot time and energy
volunteering, tutoring, etc. But as stu
dent volunteers, we can only help heal
the wounds. Tutoring doesn't fix a school
system, it mends the wounds of its vic
tims. Why can't these Stanford experts
come to the forefront with their years of
research and start curing some of these
problems?
We have a Nobel Prize winner in
Economics right here on this campus
who is hailed as a genius with his
"P'"s and "Q" 's describing how
"everything can be explained in eco
nomic terms," and we can't figure
what's happening and what we can do
about it down the street, in the state
or in the country.
We have a world-renown professor of
psychology who has been studying and
theorizing about aggression since the
early '60s, but since then we have only
seen our neighborhoods become more
violent.
If these theories explain everything so
well, why can't they solve the problems?
And if they don't really work, why don't
we spend the millions of dollars doing

something else? Well, I have an idea of
what that something else could be.
Stanford faculty, staff and students
should hold a week-long symposium with
all of the departments — to discuss a plan
of action — in which classes would be
taught by these experts from all different
fields. In addition, research projects
would be designed by the experts, with
student input, and together the faculty
and students would be actively involved
in learning, understanding and helping
the neighboring communities.
Before we can take this step, though,
there is one question I ask Stanford:
Have you not been able to effectively
study and cure these systemic problems
because you haven't been able to find a
way, or because you really don't care?
If it is because you haven't found a
way, we have an amazing opportunity
before us to begin exploring some
options. If you don't really care, then give
us our money back and stop calling your
self a research institution.
