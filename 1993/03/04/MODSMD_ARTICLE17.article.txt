Obenzinger responds to allegations in Lubetzky's letter

I AM "a man named Hilton Obenzinger"
who Daniel Lubetzky in his Feb. 25 let
ter calls an extremist liar deserving to
be put under surveillance. Lubetzky's
tirade is in response to my saying the Anti-
Defamation Ijeague is implicated in the
current Gerard-Bullock illegal spying case
in San Francisco. I cited this case as an
example of the ways the ADL compromises
its human rights work by harassing Arab-
Americans and critics of Israel. Unfortu
nately, Lubetzky has provided the Stanford
community with yet another example of
this by resorting to personal slander.
Lubetzky should read the San Francisco
Examiner or the Jewish Bulletin of North
ern California concerning the San Francis
co District Attorney's investigation of for
mer police officer Tom Gerard, accused of
selling intelligence on Arab-American and
activist groups to the Israeli and South
African governments and passing the infor
mation to an ADL undercover agent. The
investigation is no fabrication, nor is the
fact that the American Arab Anti-Discrimi
nation Committee Ls now considering a fed
eral civil-rights suit against the ADL,
Lubetzky's "pillar of human freedom."
Lubetzky also charges me with extrem
ism on the basis of an out-of-context news
paper quote from a college lecture I gave.
While the lecture concentrated on ways to
achieve Middle-East peace, I did refer to
unsavory aspects of former Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's past — for example, how
labor Zionists such as David Ben-Gurion
condemned both Shamir and Menachem
Begin as "terrorists" and "fascists" in the
19405.
Indeed, the right-wing Zionist organiza
tion known as the Stern Gang — of which
Shamir was a member — twice proposed to
the German government an alliance on the
basis of Nazi support for a Jewish state in
Palestine, in exchange for the Zionists' aid
in the war against Britain. This historical
fact is not in dispute by most scholars.
Lubetzky's letters are written according
to handbooks published by the ADL, the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee

and other rigidly pro-Israel groups. Not
only is Lubetzky's defective "intelligence"
about me drawn from these dossiers and
blacklists, but so is his demagogic style. As
someone whose family was murdered by
the Nazis, I know what kind of distressing
emotional chord Lubetzky is trying to
strike. Such sensationalism is designed to
distract attention from a frank discussion
of Israel's human-rights violations.
However, my "extremism" only rests in
advocating U.N. resolutions regarding the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including those
which acknowledge the right of Palestini
ans to establish an independent state
alongside Israel.

Lubetzky has singled out three Jewish
critics of Israeli policies — Barbara Lubin,
Prof. Joel Beinin (on leave researching
Karaite Jews in Israel) and me — precisely
because increasing numbers of Jews are
willing to speak out against the occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza, particularly
the recent expulsion of 418 Palestinians in
violation of international law.
Lubetzky and the ADL spend time
defaming other Jews, to keep dissent on
Israeli's egregious behavior within "prop
er" pro-Israel bounds. However, many
Jews feel Israel must stop its colonization
of Arab land for peace to be achieved, and
that Israel's policies are offensive to Jewish

tradition and Palestinians.
If Lubetzky is genuinely interested in
fostering open debate on the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict, he should first call off his
smear campaign and put forward his views
on how to end the conflict.
Incidentally, "a man named Hilton
Obenzinger" is the author of several
books and a doctoral student in the
Modern Thought and Literature Pro
gram. If anyone is interested in "intelli
gence gathering," I invite them to join
me for lunch.
