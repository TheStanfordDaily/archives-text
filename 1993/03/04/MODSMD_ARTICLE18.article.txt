# Middle East Focus members defend group
## 
### 
Daniel Lubetzky's smears (Daily let
ter, Feb. 25) of Stanford Middle East
Focus, its member Hilton Obenzinger
and its speakers are perfect examples of
why it is so difficult to hear pro-Palestini
an views (very different from mere "anti-
Israel attacks," as Lubetzky says) in the
United States. Among the obstacles to
discussion are attempts by some pro-
Israel organizations to stifle debate.
Lubetzky's attack is an attempt to deflect
discussion away from Palestinian issues.
SMEF is a group of about 20 Stanford
undergraduate and graduate students,
staff and community members. It is not
just a front for the actions of Obenzinger
and Prof. Joel Beinin. This implication by
Lubetzky insults not only Obenzinger
and Beinin, but the rest of us who are
engaged in serious academic and political
activity, We established the group in the
fall of 1992 to foster an on-campus forum
for many voices, scholarly and political,
on issues in the Middle East (which
includes, for our purposes, Northwest
Africa to Bangladesh).
We have organized, in addition to

forums on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,
a panel on U.S. Middle-East policy on the
eve of the Clinton administration, a dis
cussion on violence against women in the
South Asian immigrant community in
North America, a speak-out in White
Plaza on the recent Hindu-Muslim con
flict in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh
and a teach-in about issues of religious
and political conflict in South Asia. We
are planning panel discussions, film
screenings and public speak-outs on
issues as diverse as Arab nationalism and
Islamist movements, the crisis in Soma
lia, and the development of feminist
movements in the region.
We do not have a simplistic pro-Arab
position and are critical of human rights
violations whoever the perpetrator may
be â€” and this includes U.S. involvement
in such abuses in the Middle East. We do
not "ostracize" dissenting voices; people
disagree at all of our events. Indeed, we
welcome attempts to open dialogue and
bridge sectarian and ethnic differences.
Lubetzky accuses SMEF of "unrelent
ing attacks on another nation or ethnic

group" which causes "segregation"
between communities. Because we criti
cize Israel's policies does not mean we
engage in racist attacks or anti-Semitism,
nor do we question Israel's right to exist
Our criticism of Israel does not imply
an absence of criticism for other regimes
and communities engaged in similar
practices; we support debate and discus
sion, which implies many voices. The
recent letters of attack in The Daily have
reinforced for us just how important our
voice is in this debate.
We agree with Lubetzky that "recipro
cal accusations" are a waste of time. We
do not intend to spend our time continu
ally responding to smears and personal
attacks. We want to get on with our work
of fostering forums which may educate
the Stanford community about the many
issues which concern the Middle East.
