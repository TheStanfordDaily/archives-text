## Lollie shoulders load as Cardinal days wind down 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A point guard is oftentimes called
the "floor general" because the man fill
ing the position must have a controlling
mindset that commands the respect of
his fellow soldiers. From the moment
he stepped on the Stanford campus,
senior guard Marcus Lollie has been
just that, running the show with much
success.
"The very first day I played a pickup
game with the team, because of the way
I grew up and the way they played, it
was a contrast; they thought I was
crazy," Lollie said. "In the words of
Paul Garrett, 'Marcus is militant.' "
Yet his Cardinal teammates adapted
to his ways, and their court leader guid
ed them to many victories. If there is
one thing that Lollie does not shy away
from, it's responsibility.
"I like it," Lollie said. "That's the
part of basketball I enjoy. I don't think
any player minds the responsibility of
doing whatever you can to make the
team win. I don't look at it as pressure,
I look at it as something positive."
Lollie has borne much of the burden
in guiding the Stanford basketball team
this season. Last year, Lollie had the
benefit of a variety of passing options in
running the offense, making his job as
playmaker that much easier. He led the
Pacific 10 Conference in assists with a
6.5 per-game average, thanks in large
part to Adam Keefe in the post and
players producing from the perimeter.
This year, though, assist opportuni
ties have been few, and consequently
Lollie has had to adjust the focus of his
game. Instead of looking mostly to pass,
Lollie has increased his own offensive
production to compensate for the Car
dinal's dearth in scorers. He is current
ly second on the Cardinal roster in scor
ing with a 10.4 points-per-game mark.
"He hasn't had the help he did last
year to make him better," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "He can't
pass the ball effectively. He's had to do
more things than he should."
Throughout the Cardinal's trouble
some season, Lollie has been the one

benchmark of consistency on the squad.
He has played and started in all 26 of
Stanford's games to date, and has logged
the most minutes of anyone on the ros
ter.
"He's such a tough kid mentally,"
Montgomery said. "If we had more peo
ple with his type of mental toughness,
we'd be in much better shape."
"Marcus Lollie is the most tough
minded point guard in our league," said
Washington State coach Kelvin Samp
son. "He may not be the most talented,
but the intangibles he brings far out
weigh everything."
Despite Stanford's few successes in
his final year, the Seattle native has man
aged to maintain a consistently positive
attitude, serving as a model for impres
sionable young players on the team.
"That's the way I've grown up
around the game of basketball," Lollie
said. "If your outlook on the game is
positive, then you should expect positive
things to happen. For me, this is my
first losing season, and I see parallels
with this season and life — there's a lot
of diversity, and a lot of problems you
have to face.
"But you have to get through it, and

the young guys have to learn that. Just
because things aren't going well, you
can't give up and say everything is over,
otherwise you'll succumb to the pres
sure and everything will be over.
"They have to realize that you
always have to come out focused and
ready to play, because then you get a
domino effect, in terms of your confi
dence in elevating your game."
"Marcus has taught me about lead
ership and to be cool under pressure,"
said freshman guard Dion Cross. "He
keeps his head on and comes to play,
game in and game out, and that's what
I want to do in my next three years
here."
Lollie, an economics major, plans on
pursuing a career in investment bank
ing after graduation. But more immedi
ate are his ideal plans for his final home
games this weekend.
"I'd like to go out with a win," Lollie
said. "But most of all I'd like to finish
with everybody playing hard, giving 110
percent, saying you gave it the best you
had. To me, that's the best feeling,
knowing that you played your ass off."
And for the duration of his Stanford
career, Lollie has done just that.
