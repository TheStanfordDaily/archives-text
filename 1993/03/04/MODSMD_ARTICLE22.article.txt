### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
As expected, the Stanford women's swim team
cruised to an easy defense of their Pacific 10 Con
ference title earlier this week by winning 16 of 19
events, and taking second place in the three
events they did not win.
After the final score was tallied, the Cardinal
had overwhelmed its second-place host, UCLA, by
a point margin of 1,577 to 1,323. Along the way,
Stanford also boosted its total number of NCAA
qualifiers to 16 by adding eight more during the
three-day competition.
Led by the trifecta performance of senior co
captain Janel Jorgensen, who was named the Pac
-10 Swimmer of the Meet for winning three
events, Stanford plunged into the first day of com
petition and came up with a clean sweep in the
500-yard freestyle.
Freshman Jane Skillman shocked even herself
by winning that event in front of teammates
Katherine Comanor and Lisa Jacob. For Skill
man, her time in that race also meant an auto

matic invitation to the NCAA Championships, to
take place March 18-20 in Minneapolis.
"I was surprised that I finished first because I
qualified sixth for the 500 earlier, but when I dove
into the pool for the race, everything was perfect,"
Skillman said. "It was a relief to get my qualifying
time, because it gets really tense for some of us,
when we get down towards our last chance of the
season."
The next race was all Jorgensen's, as she won
her first event of the meet, the 200 individual med
ley, in front of fellow Olympian Lea Loveless. The
major upset of the meet then followed as former
Pac-10 record holder Jenny Thompson was sur
prised by UCLA's Richelle DePold in the 50 free.
The first day of the meet ended with Stanford's
Eileen Richetelli placing second in the 1-meter
diving competition, and the Stanford relay team
blowing the rest of the conference out of the water
in the 400 medley relay. Richetelli went on to
place second in the 3-meter event as well, before
taking first in the platform competition.
On Monday, the Cardinal con
tinued its winning ways as
Kendra Thayer finished first in
the 400 IM, followed by
Mary Ellen Blanchard and Laura
Gandrud in third and fourth
place, respectively.
Jorgensen then continued to
dominate the meet, as she took
first in the 100 butterfly by a
1.05-second margin over DePold,
while Thompson rebounded from
her earlier upset to join team
mate Jacob for a 1-2 finish in the
200 free. Lori Heisick then added
to the list of Stanford NCAA
qualifiers with a second-place
performance in the 100 breast
stroke.
The highlight of the day came
during the last individual event,
as the Cardinal, with arguably
the "best backstroking core in
the nation," according to coach
Richard Quick, dominated the

100 backstroke, taking four of
the top five places.
Loveless won the event and
was followed by Anne Mahoney,
Mary Edwards and Tammy
Shannon in the third through
fifth positions. All four times
qualified for the NCAA Champi
onships. To round out the second
day, Stanford bested the field in
both the 200 medley relay and
the 800 free relay.
On the final day of competi
tion, Katherine Comanor began
the scoring deluge with a first
place finish in the 1,650 free. She
was followed by a 1-2 finish by
Loveless and Shannon in the 200
back. Thompson then got
revenge against DePold as she
took the 100 free title.
In the last two events of the
meet, Heisick finished second
behind Beata Kaszuba of Ari
zona State in the 200 breast,
while Jorgensen sealed her
nomination as Swimmer of the
Meet with a blowout win in the
200 fly over teammate Becky
Crowe.
