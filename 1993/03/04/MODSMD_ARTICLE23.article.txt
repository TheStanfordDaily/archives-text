# Women play two in Arizona
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
It's crunchtime for the Cardi
nal women's basketball team.
With just four games remain
ing in the regular season, the No.
9 Stanford squad journeys to
sunny Arizona this weekend, par
taking in what has become one its

toughest road trips of the year.
"We used to call this 'the fun
trip,' " said Cardinal coach Tara
VanDerveer. "Those days are over."
Tonight, Stanford (21-5, 11-3
Pacific 10 Conference) squares off
against a feisty Arizona State
team (16-7, 9-5) that currently
ranks third in the Pac-10 stand
ings. Although the Cardinal edged

the Sun Devils, 85-80, earlier this
season at Maples Pavilion, it was
upset by Arizona State last year
in Tempe, Ariz., 77-65.
"We have our work cut out for
us," VanDerveer said. "We have
to earn our respect."
Things won't be any easier for
Stanford when it plays the Uni
versity of Arizona (12-11, 6-8)
Saturday evening. The Cardinal
put up its worst shooting per
centage while sloppily defeating
the Wildcats last month at home
69-52.
Despite the upcoming chal
lenges, Stanford enters the Ari
zona series with a tremendous
boost of confidence after giving
two of its best performances last
weekend at Maples. The Cardinal
crushed Washington, 86-62, last
Thursday before thrashing Wash
ington State on Saturday, 100-56.
