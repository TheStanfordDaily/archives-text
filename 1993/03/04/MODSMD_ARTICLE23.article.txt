# Women play two in Arizona

### Brian Border Staff writer 
It's crunchtime for the Cardi
nal women's basketball team.
With just four games remain
ing in the regular season, the No.
9 Stanford squad journeys to
sunny Arizona this weekend, par
taking in what has become one its

toughest road trips of the year.
"We used to call this 'the fun
trip,' " said Cardinal coach Tara
VanDerveer. "Those days are over."
Tonight, Stanford (21-5, 11-3
Pacific 10 Conference) squares off
against a feisty Arizona State
team (16-7, 9-5) that currently
ranks third in the Pac-10 stand
ings. Although the Cardinal edged

the Sun Devils, 85-80, earlier this
season at Maples Pavilion, it was
upset by Arizona State last year
in Tempe, Ariz., 77-65.
"We have our work cut out for
us," VanDerveer said. "We have
to earn our respect."
Things won't be any easier for
Stanford when it plays the Uni
versity of Arizona (12-11, 6-8)
Saturday evening. The Cardinal
put up its worst shooting per
centage while sloppily defeating
the Wildcats last month at home
69-52.
Despite the upcoming chal
lenges, Stanford enters the Ari
zona series with a tremendous
boost of confidence after giving
two of its best performances last
weekend at Maples. The Cardinal
crushed Washington, 86-62, last
Thursday before thrashing Wash
ington State on Saturday, 100-56.
In both games, Stanford con
trolled the tempo from the start, as
it received solid efforts from just
about every player.
"The wins against Washington
were encouraging for us," said
point guard Molly Goodenbour. "It
was really the first time this sea
son we came out and dominated."
VanDerveer also expressed
pleasure with her squad's intense
efforts against the Huskies and the
Cougars.
"It's (crucial] to put together
back-to-back good games," the
eighth-year coach said following
Saturday's contest. "The impor
tant thing is that we build on it."
Similar to last season, the
defending-national-champion Car
dinal seems to be peaking at the
right time — just as the NCAA
Tournament approaches.
"Last year we did the same
thing," Goodenbour said. "We took

off towards the end of the season
and had a lot of high-scoring
games, so hopefully it's a good
indicator of things to come."
Even after convincing victories,
there are still things for the team
to work on when it plays this
weekend.
"If there was anything I wish
we could do better, it's coming up
with loose balls," VanDerveer said.
"It seems like there're five or six
opportunities each game that we
let slip away."
If Stanford keeps improving
and playing up to its potential, this
could turn out to be a fun week
end, after all.
