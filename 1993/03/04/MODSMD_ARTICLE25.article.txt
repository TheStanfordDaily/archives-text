# Aguirre grabs conference crown, honors at wrestling Pac-10's

The celebration began before
competition was over.
Jimmy Aguirre, a 134-pound
redshirt freshman, captured the
Pacific 10 Conference wrestling
title Monday night at Boise State.
In addition, Aguirre became only
the second Stanford grappler ever
to win the Pac-10 Outstanding

Wrestler Award, and the first since
Len Borchers in 1969. Among the
champions in each of the 10 weight
divisions, Pac-10 coaches only
bestow this honor upon the one
champion who they believed to
have performed the best.
What made Aguirre's triumph
even more memorable was that he
defeated his long-time hero in the
title match.
Second-seeded Aguirre faced

No. 1 Marco Sanchez of Arizona
State, who placed third in the
NCAA Championships last year.
Aguirre had admired Sanchez
since his freshman year in high
school, but on Monday, they
switched roles as the now-colle
giate freshman showed the senior
a thing or two about wrestling.
"He flat-out made Sanchez
look bad," said Cardinal coach
Chris Horpel.

Indeed, officials warned Sanchez
twice for stalling. The inactivity
worked until 30 seconds remained
in the match, when Aguirre scored
a two-point takedown to break a 3-
3 tie. With 10 seconds left, Sanchez
managed to score one point with an
escape, but only two seconds
remained. Aguirre started jumping
for joy.
He was not the only one who
deserved to celebrate, however.
Another Stanford grappler, 142-
pound junior co-captain Lance
Johnson, also secured an invita
tion to the NCAA Championships
with a fourth place finish, while
four more of Aguirre's teammates
placed in their respective weight
classes. In all, six of nine Cardinal
entrants placed.
While Aguirre did not exactly
contend with "powder-puff oppo
nents, Johnson and his fellow
142-pound adversaries comprised
perhaps the most competitive and
evenly-matched division at the
meet. In fact, the action was so
fierce that Oregon State's defend
ing champion Ryan Sugai, who
had been ranked fifth in the
nation, found himself eliminated
from the tournament with two
straight losses.
"If they had wrestled on a dif
ferent day, it would turn out com
pletely different," Horpel said.
However, it was Johnson who
captured fourth place on Sunday
and Monday. He advanced to the
semifinals, and was kept from the
final only by virtue of an overtime
loss to eventual champion Steven
St. John of Arizona State. St.
John scored only one takedown

during sudden death, but that
was enough to escape with a 5-3
decision.
Johnson then lost his third
place match to Tony Evans of
Boise State 10-8 in overtime, but
clearly displayed national-caliber
abilities throughout the meet.
Consequently, of 20 fourth-and
fifth-place finishers at the event,
Johnson was the first named by
Pac-10 coaches to one of the con
ference's eight wild card spots for
the NCAA Championships, to
take place March 18-20 at lowa
State.
Joining Johnson as a fourth
place finisher was 190-pound
freshman Roger Liu. Liu lost his
opening match to fourth-seeded
Les Gutches of OSU, but won in
the second round by injury
default. The victory was the
freshman's first of the season, pit
ting him against third-seeded Jeff
McCoy of Oregon in the next
round. Liu won, 6-3, scoring two
takedowns on two well-executed
leg shots.
"McCoy was injured, but Liu
wrestled well enough to win any
way," Horpel said.
Liu then rematched Gutches in
the third-place match, but lost by
virtue of a fall.
Two flu-ridden Stanford grap
plers also placed, despite their ill
nesses. Fourth-seeded freshman
Tod Surmon, at 150 pounds, cap
tured fifth by winning his first
and last of four matches, and 126-
pound senior Dave Nowick ended
his Pac-10 carrier with a sixth
place performance.
Despite losing his fifth-place

match on a controversial illegal
hold ruling, Nowick had his
moment in the tournament. In
the second round, he found him
self trailing by three points with
seven seconds remaining against
Clint Hunter of UC-Davis. Defy
ing time, Nowick secured his
opponent in a headlock, sent
Hunter to the mat for a two
point takedown and immediately
scored two more points by nearly
pinning his adversary. This four
point surge in the span of seven
seconds gave Nowick a 6-5 victo
ry.
Sahlan Martin, a 158-pound
sophomore, also placed sixth. On
his way, Martin, too, managed a
dramatic win. In his second round
match against Oregon's Clint
Messner, Martin injured his knee
seriously â€” to the extent that
Horpel wanted to throw in the
towel. But Martin told his coach
he could go on.
"From there, Martin just went
out and killed him," Horpel said.
Senior Phil Nowick at 118
pounds, 167-pound freshman
C.E. Smith and 177-pound fresh
man Nathan Lovelle also compet
ed for the Cardinal in the Pac-10
tourney.
As a team, Stanford finished a
deceptive eighth in a field of nine.
"The point spread between the
fifth through eighth-place teams
was around five points," Horpel
explained.
In any event, six place winners
out of nine entrants speaks for
itself.
"We wrestled to our capabili
ties, and then some," Horpel said.
