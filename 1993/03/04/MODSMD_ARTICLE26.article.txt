# Cardinal spikers sweep by Pacific

### Rob Ross Staff writer 
It wasn't pretty, but a win is a
win.
Despite some sloppy play, the
Cardinal men's volleyball team
wiped the Burnham Pavilion
floor with the University of the
Pacific last night, 15-7, 15-8, 15-
6.
"We played to the level of our
opponents," said setter Canyon
Ceman. "We are going to have to
step it up in the next few days to
prepare for UC-Santa Barbara."
In their first year as a varsity
squad, the Tigers are 1-7. Start
ing three freshman, coach Joe
Wortman feels his team is where
it needs to be. "It usually takes
four to five years for a team to be
competitive in this league," he
said.
Cardinal coach Ruben Nieves
concurred. "I think if a team
wins a match in their first year in
this league, they have beaten the
odds," he said.
The Tigers were led by junior
Jeff Hall, who tallied 12 kills
while hitting .207. Hall shared
the offensive load with freshman
middle blocker Brian Blint, who
hit .500 with 5 kills. As a team,
however, the Tigers were held to
a meager .218 hitting percent
age.
The No. 4 Cardinal (7-3, 6-2 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) had a rotating lineup in
which 10 players saw significant
time. The offensive burden was
well spread among these 10, with
swing hitter Bob Hillman leading
the way, tallying 12 kills. Dave

Goss had eight kills in the first
game, and freshman Mike Lam
bert took his spot for the next
two and racked up nine kills of
his own. As a team, Stanford hit
an unreal .456.
Both teams served extremely
well, as the Cardinal had 12 aces
and 18 service errors while the
Tigers had six and 11. "We got a
good practice against tough jump
serves," Nieves said.
In the first game, the Cardinal
took a quick 12-3 lead on middle
blocker Brian Garrett's dominat
ing play. Pacific made a four
point run, but a Garrett block
closed out the game. Stanford hit
.655 on the game, behind John
Hribar and Hillman's errorless
hitting performances.
The second game went by just
as quickly. Pacific took its only
lead of the match at 2-1, but
Stanford quickly made up that
deficit and more in racing to a
12-4 lead. Again, the Tigers made
a small run, only to be throttled
by two blistering Ryan Moos kills
and fell, 15-8.
In game three, Pacific waited
until the score was 9-3 to make
another unsuccessful comeback
bid. The score got as close as 9-6
before Ceman, Lambert and
Moos reestablished Stanford's
offense as the Cardinal blazed to
victory without allowing another
point.
Stanford is tied with Hawaii
atop the Pacific Division of the
MPSF. Long Beach State, San
Diego State and USC are
clumped in the middle of the divi
sion, with UC-San Diego and
Pacific lagging far behind.
