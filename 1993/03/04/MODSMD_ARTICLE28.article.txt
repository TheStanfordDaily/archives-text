"It's good to be back on top."
Coach Frank Brennan's words sum up the feeling of
the entire Stanford women's tennis team, who made
sure that the transfer of power in the collegiate tennis
world last weekend was quick and decisive.
By virtue of its victory over previously top-ranked
Florida in the National Team Indoor Championships
last weekend, the Cardinal (12-0, 4-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) will enter today's match against the University of
the Pacific as the top team in the nation.
"We don't expect to have any problems," Brennan
said of the contest. "I want to give some of our players
some rest and get some others out there who haven't
played as much this year."
Brennan will rest Kim Shasby, Amy Chiminello and
Beth Berris from singles play and insert three of Stan
ford's lower-tier players into the starting spots. Junior
Emma Woodhouse will take over in the No. 4 spot, while
freshman Wendy Sacks will fill in at the No. 5 position.
"These players deserve a lot of credit," Brennan said.
"They're good enough to beat most of the players we
faced at the Team Indoors, and it sometimes gets frus
trating for them to cheer their hearts out for the team
when they're not playing."
Junior Laxmi Poruri and senior team captain
Heather Willens will occupy the top two positions for the
Cardinal, while junior Kristine Kurth will move up to
No. 3. Woodhouse and Sacks will also take over the No.
3 doubles slot.
Match time is 1:30 p.m. at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
