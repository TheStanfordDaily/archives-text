# Sports from 'home office'

uitcherwhinin', Cardinal fans. I
I lknow Dead Week is right around
the corner. I know things are tough
for ytfu. Don't blame me if you don't feel
like thinking about sports right now. I get
paid to make you think about it.
So take a break from that pre-Dead
Week, I' ve-got-two-papers-and-300-pages
due-Friday attitude. Let's get down to busi
ness.
Stanford is one of the few colleges in the
country that combines fme academics with
a first-rate athletic program. Most students
on campus make academics a higher priori
ty than attending athletic contests.
This column is dedicated to the rest of
us.
In the true spirit of combining insightful
sports commentary with the intellectual
quality of Letterman-esque organization, I
give you:
The Top Ten Sporting Events You Should
Blow Off Homework For This Week
10. San Jose Sharks vs. Edmonton, Sunday
— The Sharks are only 35 games out of first
place, and you might witness Edmonton
score in double-digits for one of the few
times this year.
9. Stanford women's basketball at Arizona
State, Thursday — What the hey, it's not
that bad a road trip. Besides, your heckling
will easily be heard over the 500 or so fans
that will pack the Sports Activity Center.
8. The Big Game, Saturday — No, not that
newfangled American sport you're used to.
We're talking rugby. We're talking Cal.
We're talking blood.
7. Women's tennis vs. UOP, Thursday —
Only for true connoisseurs of the lopsided
victory. Watch Stanford's No. 1 netters eat
up the Tigers like Frosted Flakes. Finally,
Goliath beats the hell out of David.
6. Santa Clara women's lacrosse at Sonoma
State, Saturday — The Bronco laxwomen
meet one of their toughest tests of the year
going into the crucial second half of their
schedule. Make it a picnic. Pretend you
know how to keep score.
5. San Francisco Giants PA announcer
semifinals, Saturday — Which one of these
lucky Giants fans will get the once-in-a-life

time chance to earn $8,000 a year and tell
thousands of crowd members to "drive safe
ly"?
4. Yankees spring training, Sarasota, Fla.,
Saturday — Any bets on how many days
before Steinbrenner fires someone? I say
three.
3. Stanford men's basketball vs. No. 3 Ari-

zona, Sunday — Stanford will likely need to
win to keep from becoming the losingest
team in Stanford history. An upset here
would be Miracle at Maples 11, 111 and IV.
2. No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball vs. No. 7
UCSB, Saturday — Come watch the
Olympic-like bald-headed spikers take on
the Gauchos in what might be the most
important match of the season, or at least of
this week. Experience unbridled aggression
firsthand.
1. IM basketball finals, Sunday — You've
heard about this for weeks, now come watch
a true sporting event. See Stanford students
live out their dreams of hoops glory in Maples
Pavilion — only the winners will get the cov
eted picture in the Ford Center "Hall of
Champions." The winning squad will take on
the varsity team to see which five will start
for Stanford men's basketball next year.
C'mon, get out of your dorm and give
your depressing, work-ridden life a pick-me
up. The laxwomen will thank you.

Mike McDonough will be attending the North
American Dog-Sledding Championships held
in Slippery Rock, Pa. this weekend, where No.
1 ranked Sitka will fight to hold off a chal
lenge against second ranked Mushu, who
leads the league in conference wins this year.
