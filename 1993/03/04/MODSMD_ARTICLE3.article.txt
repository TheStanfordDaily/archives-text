# Police raid frat house in search of stolen signs
## 49 signs confiscated from Phi Delts 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Stanford Police seized dozens of
street signs in an early morning
raid on the Phi Delta Theta house
yesterday, stripping the fraterni
ty's barroom walls.
Forty-nine signs — including
markers for Caltrain stops, the
Devil Mountain Brewery and sev
eral Southern California locations
— were confiscated in the 9 a.m.
search, according to Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Neimeyer.
He said police were tipped off by a
local resident, who recognized a sign
in a photo accompanying an article in
Tuesday's Peninsula Times Tribune
about the Phi Delts' new "bring your
own beer" party rules.
Neimeyer said the case has been
submitted to the district attorney's
office. Stealing signs violates both ve
hicle and penal codes, he said, and pil
fering signs valued at more than
$400 is considered grand theft.
Phi Delt Resident Assistant
Brad Budney defended the frater
nity's wall decorations. "We're not
a house of thieves, but the signs
have been brought from all over
the country and we just happen to
be living here," he said.
"The signs have been here for
years," Budney said, adding that
"some of the signs were taken legit
imately, like from dumps."

Row Facilities officials accom
panied police on the raid, and Row
Director Diana Conklin said any
disciplinary action will be imposed
by the Office of Student Affairs.
Conklin and Neimeyer agreed
that there are probably stolen signs
in other houses on campus, and
Neimeyer said street signs have
been recovered in the past.
"We know that there are signs
all over the place," he said. "We
don't react to these until we are
called [about] them."
Budney said every inch of the
walls in the barroom was covered
with signs until the police "came to
get one sign, identified the other
signs, and then took them all."
The collection included the much
sought after "Stanford Avenue" sign,
which Neimeyer said is one of the
most popular signs in Palo Alto.
Some of the signs had been bro
ken off by bending metal poles back
and forth until they snapped,
Neimeyer said. Signs police
couldn't identify — "junky hand
made things" — were not confis
cated, he added.
Police will require proof of pur
chase before the house can get the
signs back. "We're upset about the
receipt issue," Budney said.
"They've been here for years. We
don't have receipts for them and
we're never going to see them
again."
