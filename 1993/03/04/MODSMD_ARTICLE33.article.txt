Members of the Interfraternity
Council elected junior Mike
Champney as their new president
last night.
Currently the rush chairman
of the Sigma Chi fraternity,
Champney will replace Rip
Waters, another Sigma Chi mem
ber. He defeated two opponents
for the year-long job.
Regarding the "bring-your
own-beer" policy currently facing
the IFC, Champney said he felt it
is too soon to draw conclusions
about the plan.
"I think it is a very good alter
native since liability is such a
huge issue," he added. "As one of
the fraternities who held the
party, I think there are a lot of
possibilities and changes needed."
Chris Friedberg, also a Sigma
Chi, was elected vice president of
the judiciary. Friedberg, who is
studying in Berlin this quarter,
sent in a letter to be read upon his

nomination in which he empha
sized the need to maintain a "pro-
Greek attitude."
Jim Masetti, a member of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity, was
elected to the judicial board and
Jeff Smalls, another Sigma Chi,
was chosen for the standards
committee.
Vice president of operations —
a position which controls all fra
ternity activities, including Greek
Week — will be held by Tom
Baranowski, a member of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Jeremy Dobbie, a member of the
recently resurrected Zeta Psi fra
ternity, was elected treasurer of the
IFC, and Andy Crispino, a member
of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was
elected Rush chairman.
Five students were also elected
to head committees: Mark Webber,
a KA; Matt Hungerford, a member
of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity;
John Lucero, also a Sig Ep; James
Frary, a Deke; and Josh Maisel, a
member of the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity.
