## "Crying Game" 's unlikely success 
### 
WARNING: If >o)u haven't
seen "The Crying Game,"
don't read this. It will ruin
the film for you. Trust me.
Six Oscar nominations and 30 mil
lion dollars later, critics and
cognoscenti still can't believe the suc
cess of Neil Jordan's latest film, "The
Crying Game." The lead character, IRA

volunteer Fergus
(Stephen Rea), falls in
love with a black hair
dresser named Dil

N'Gai Croal

(Jaye Davidson), who turns out to be a
male transvestite.
Though most critics loved the
unconventional gay romance at the
film's core, none believed it would
become a hit, for that very reason.
But mainstream audiences flocked
to the film, drawn by friends and
critics who refused to reveal the
film's secret. This winter's conversa
tion-opening line wasn't "What's
your sign?" It was "Have you seen
'The Crying Game?'"
But Jordan's film isn't as subversive
as he and the critics would have you
believe. Fie uses cunning edits and
stereotypes to shield straight viewers
from the reality of a gay relationship,
shown by Fergus and Dil's love
scenes. In each of them, as Dil drops
down out of the camera frame to per
form oral sex on Fergus, the camera
remains fixed on Fergus' upper torso,
so the audience can't see what's going
on. Isn't gay love grand, when you
don't have to watch?
Jordan also insulates the audience
with Dil's character development.
When we first meet Dil, he acts like
the femme fatales of the '40s' film
noir movies: coolly bantering with
Fergus in a sexually charged way. He
controls the initial relationship, de
ciding when and where they'll meet,

and how far they'll go.
But later, Dil becomes more
stereotypically feminine, cushioning
the impact of Dils gender upon the
audience. After Fergus finds out, Dil
shows up at the construction site
where he works, dressed in skimpy
pair of shorts and a bustier, to the de
light of Fergus' co-workers.

And once Fergus'
ex-girlfriend Jude
(Miranda Richard
son), shows up, Dil

becomes increasingly possessive —
he throws fits, follows Fergus every
where and cries helplessly — you
know, just like a woman.
By buying into the stereotype that
in a gay relationship one person plays
the "man" and the other the
"woman," Jordan lets the audience
continue to deceive themselves. They
don't have to believe that Oil is a man
because film doesn't force them to.
As Fergus repeats his mantra, "I liked
you better as a girl," Dil becomes
more girl-like before our eyes.
In the final scene, Dil visits Fergus
in jail, calling him "darling," while he
says, more kindly than before, "Don't
call me that." The camera pulls away,
leaving the two looking at each other
through three inches of Plexiglass —
the ultimate form of safe sex.
Jordan could have been truly sub
versive, if he'd made a film that didn't
shrink from the reality and complex
ity of gay love (i.e. "Young Soul
Rebels," "The Living End"). That
would have tested his ability to retain
the sympathies of straight audiences
while challenging their homopho
bia, and made it a more honest film.
But as it stands now, "The Crying
Game" is simply a well-crafted film
with a built-in gimmick. It's actually
a crying shame.
