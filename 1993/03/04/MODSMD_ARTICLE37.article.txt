gainst a background of watery
blue, three men casually dressed
in white shirts and black pants
slowly stretch and wriggle on the floor. As the
upbeat music increases tempo, they rise and
commence leaping, strutting and dancing in
a loose-limbed and athletic style. The move
ment comes full circle as the dancers sink to
the ground and roll in unison before the cur
tain falls.
What you are witnessing is not a strange
mating ritual; it is the ballet "Aunis," choreo
graphed by Jacques Gamier and currently
featured as a premiere in the 60th anniver
sary season of the San Francisco Ballet.
"Aunis" is just one of four ballets in the
evening's performance, the others include el
ements as diverse as traditional flowing chif
fon skirts, music from Brecht's "Threepenny

Opera" and a set design
of a gas station.
For those whose in
troduction to the ballet
consisted of a yearly
trip to see "The Nut
cracker," the idea of a
ballet may be insepara
ble from visions of the
Sugar Plum Fairy in a
starchy tutu and over
sized rodents running
across the stage.
While the most fa
mous ballets may be the
romantic creations of
the 19th century —
"Sleeping Beauty,"

for those whose
introduction to
the ballet was a
yearly trip to see
'the nutcracker,'
ballet may be
inseparable from
visions of the
sugar plum fairy

"Giselle," "Swan Lake" — the choreography
and music used in contemporary ballet draws
from this classical past as well as from jazz,
Broadway musicals, pop and electronic music.
Evenings of shorter ballets allow audi
ences to see both the variety of contemporary
work as well as revivals of older favorites.
With this approach, the company ensures
that they will please a wide variety of tastes
with any given program.
"Program III," the Balanchine Program,
provides an excellent introduction to 20th
century American choreography, and show
cases the work of ballet-legend George Bal
anchine on the 10th anniversary of his death.
The accompanying music of the ballets —

composed by Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and
Gershwin — is reason alone to make the
evening worthwhile, especially given the high
quality of the Ballet's orchestra under the di
rection of Denis de Coteau.
However, a trip to the ballet treats the eyes
as well as the ears, and Balanchine's choreog
raphy both works with and explodes beyond
the expectations of the music.
The extent to which ballet and music work
hand in hand is illustrated by Balanchine's
"Agon," set to a score commissioned from
Stravinsky by the choreographer. Against a
bare set and dressed in the simplest leotards,
the dancers work in groups of two, three and
four with larger ensemble dances at the be
ginning and end of the piece. The lack of frills
and distractions focuses the audience's atten
tion on the energetic and precise movements

of the dancers.
The Balanchine
program also
highlights one of
the staples of
modern and clas
sical ballet — the
pas de deux. This
couple dance al
lows the best
dancers of the
company to show
their individual
skills as well as the
teamwork in
volved in the
leaps and lifts.
"Tchaikovsky Pas

de Deux" spotlights the strongest moves of
the male and female dancer who whirl across
the stage in quick bursts of athletic skill.
The second pas de deux, "Duo Concer
tant," has a more restrained and romantic
mood, and a pianist and violinist accompany
the dancers on stage. The intimacy of the pas
de deux highlights the emotional and sensual
depths of ballet.
As a finale for the program, the dancers shift
gears to the upbeat piece, "Who Cares?which
features the show tunes of George Gershwin.
In a cross between ballet and Broadway, the
dancers follow pirouettes with kicks and jazz
steps. As a whole, the Balanchine evening
serves as a perfect introduction to the ballet

with its combination of contemporary and
classic moves as well as energetic music.
For fans of full-evening ballets or those
who want to see a sure-fire crowd pleaser on
a first trip to the ballet, the Tchaikovsky mas
terpiece "Swan Lake" satisfies with its elabo
rate sets, lavish costumes and ornate ensem
ble scenes.
Artistic director Helgi Tomasson choreo
graphed this version of the timeless classic.
The San Francisco Ballet's "Swan Lake" has
been critically acclaimed since its 1988 pre
miere, and the company also has the distinc
tion of having staged the first American
"Swan Lake" in 1940.
Production of works by avant-garde contem
porary choreographers balances the traditional
side of the San Francisco Ballet's repertory.
The three dances on the Contemporary
Program promise to stretch the limits and de
finitions of ballet with their eclectic choice of
music and bold combination of dance genres.
French choreographer Redha uses a musical
collage that includes songs by Peter Gabriel
and Dead Can Dance for his world premiere
ballet "La Pavane Rouge." Redha has been
noted for his emphasis on drama, reflecting
the choreographer's training as an actor.
High drama and high energy also charac
terize the style of choreographer William
Forsythe, whose "In the middle, somewhat
elevated" is set to an electro-percussive score

by Tom Willems. Forsythe's high-tech style
pushes the standard steps and rhythms of
ballet to the edge by distorting and shoving
them into new contexts. One earlier Forsythe
piece actually takes ballet out of a high-brow
setting by turning the stage into an impro
vised disco.
The Contemporary Program is rounded
off by world premiere "Seeing Stars" that
moves from the cutting edge to memories of
kindergarten by alternating hard-edged
modern music with the familiar "Twinkle,
Twinkle."
The San Francisco Ballet's versatility ap
pears in their ability to gracefully move from
tutu to techno in the course of one season's
work, and this variety is one of the reasons
that the company is successfully twirling into
its 60th season.
Whether one chooses Balanchine's
splashy showmanship, "Swan Lake" 's time
lessness or the artistic challenge of the Con
temporary Program, the Ballet delivers a
spectacular evening of music and dance — all
at a cost less than a trip to the movies. ■
