# After doing the 'write' thing, he's got his own thing
## Actor John Turturro slides into the director's chair after a stint in front of the camera

He shocked us as an angry, racist
pizza boy in "Do the Right
Thing." He charmed us as a
sensitive, soft-spoken candy
store worker in "Jungle Fever." He mystified
us as an alienated and miserable Hollywood
screenwriter in "Barton Fink." He disgusted
us as an unscrupulous, grovelling "schema

ta" in "Miller's Crossing."
John Turturro can play any role
Including that of the director.
His directorial debut, "Mac" is
the story of Turturro's father, an
Italian-American, second-genera
tion immigrant carpenter whose
work is his means of leaving his
mark in a world where old-fash
ioned values are a thing of the past.
"['Mac'] is about people who
came to this country and struggled
to do something with their lives, to
achieve some sort of meaning, to
produce something of quality that
would define who they were,"
Turturro said, in an interview.
"Everyone's come here in a clan
or a tribe and done that," he said. "I
think it's a quintessential, classic
American story told from experi
ences I knew something about.
"I did it because I had some
thing to express.... There's a lot
my dad in the film. There's a lot of
me in the film."

Turturro's intimacy with his subject *
matter is one of "Mac" s strongest aspects.
He said from the time he was a young boy, he
worked in construction with his father, "feel
ing it, smelling it" — and he strives to make
audiences do the same. "I wanted [to make it
so] you could ... feel the substance of the
film — so you couldn't 'objectivize' it," he
said. The first scene of "Mac," for example, is
a series of close-up construction shots.
The immediacy of his style is similar to,
and likely influenced by, Spike Lee, with
whom Turturro worked in "Do the Right
Thing," "Jungle Fever" and "Mo' Better .
Blues." Like Lee, Turturro includes little
exposition and very few establishing shots;
as he says, "We're here, then we're there,"
with minimal transition.
He explains that immediacy is impor
tant because, "There's no time to lose. A big
wide shot [would be] meaningless; you've
got to go right to the subject."
But he's quick to deny any direct influ
ence from Spike Lee, or from Joel and Ethan
Coen, who directed him in "Barton Fink"
and "Miller's Crossing."
"1 don't think [my style] is like Spike's
or Joel's. You may see a shot here or there,
but it's very much my own point of view."
However, he conceded that "every
body's been influenced by somebody." In his
case, directors Martin Scorsese and Vittorio
DeSica have been most influential, he said.
Turturro sees a director's job as similar
to a sculptor's. Directing is about "taking
elements of life and then sculpting it, high-

lighting it, compressing it.
"Life is more interesting than art. [Art]
should be a mirror, like Shakespeare says, to
illuminate [life]."
However, he warns against documen
tary realism: "You have to find the metaphor
in stuff.... [Art] shouldn't be a tabloid,
that's too easy."

He cites "Do
the Right Thing" as
an example of both
metaphoric and
tabloid realism. "In
'Do the Right
Thing' we did find
certain metaphors,"
for example, the
characters talking
to the camera. But

'With Spike (Lee), it's
more like jazz because
you're riff in' more. With
Joel and Ethan (Coen) it's
more like a classical piece'
— John Turturro

the film was too tabloid, he said.
"I always felt the most successful part of
['Do the Right Thing'] was up until the riot
stuff. That almost became another film for
me. It almost took away from some of the
other things we had accomplished up until
then, [even though] it was powerful."

'"Do the Right Thing' was most effec
tive when it was really funny," he said.
Although Pino [Turturro's character] was
racist, "a lot of people responded very
positively. 1 thought they were gonna kill
me. They were all very happy there was a
character saying those things. [Even some
of the] kids from

Bensonhurst,
they loved me!
"The expression
of racism in 'Do
the Right Thing'
was told from a
certain back
ground
There's other
forms of racism
where people say 'I

would never use the word 'nigger,' but then
they... tell racist jokes, and they would never
live next door to somebody That's just a
different expression of the same disease."
Turturro said he "doesn't believe in"
being politically correct. "You have to see
different sides of experience. Anything goes

when you're creating. What's important is
that [the work] is about something."
He sees the ethnicity of his characters as
only incidental to their personalities. "Every
character is from someplace," he said. "Some
times that's an issue, and sometimes it isn't. I
could play 100 Italian-Americans, and every
single one of them could be totally different."
For example, he said, the characters he
played in "Barton Fink" and "Miller's
Crossing" were both Jewish. "But [Bernie]
in ['Miller's Crossing'] would've eaten
[Barton Fink] alive. They had nothing in

common."
"In this country, unfortunately,
every group is slotted. The Jew
makes the bagel, the Italian makes
the spaghetti, the Irish drinks the
beer, the German eats the sausage
If I can do something about a
group to show a different aspect, it's
a good thing.
"Even someone who's a white
Anglo-Saxon Protestant can feel
like, 'I want to tell different stories
about my experience.' Robert
Redford touched on that in
'Ordinary People,' in a way."
He said he preferred playing Pauly
in "Jungle Fever" to Pino in "Do the
Right Thing," because Pauly repre
sented the feelings of many boys —
"not being accepted in a group, not
thinking like everyone else.

"I never was in a situation [like Pino's]
where I hated my life, or my job, or was that
frustrated as a younger boy."
Pauly, on the other hand, "was a young
boy with a real feminine side, because he's
become almost the woman in his relation
ship with the father; he's his wife. That's a
lot closer to me, the feelings I felt, more
than in 'Do the Right Thing.' "
Turturro also said he helped write and
create many of the scenes in "Jungle Fever."
He said in developing the Pauly character, "1
was able to draw on things from my own life."
Having grown up in various neighbor
hoods in New York City, Turturro said he was
almost always a minority. "Even when I
wasn't [a minority], I felt like one anyway," he
said. "Some people just always feel like one."
Because he could identify with Pauly,
Turturro was able to make the character
especially compelling. "I really felt he could
have been the main character. It could've
been about a black woman and a white
guy.... 1 knew I was onto something with
[Pauly]. The main characters [played by
Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra] were
more like symbols."
But despite his criticisms, Turturro
acknowledges that collaborating with Spike
Lee allowed him to develop his own ideas
about directing as well as acting. He said
Spike gave him great freedom to invent his
characters' roles, often allowing improvisa
tion during rehearsals — in contrast to the
Coen Brothers, who "write very specifically.
"With Spike, it's more like jazz because
