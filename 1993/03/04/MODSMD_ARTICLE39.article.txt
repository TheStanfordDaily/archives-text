Aussie first-timer
spins fairy tale of
dance & romance

Strictly Ballroom

"Strictly Ballroom" is strictly ridiculous
— which is what makes it so very good. Aus
tralian first-time director Baz Luhrmann
treats ballroom dancing like a fairy tale in
this story of professional dancer Scott Hast
ings (Paul Mercurio), the nonconformist
prince.
Under Luhrmann's masterly direction, as
we laugh at the over-the-top romance,
drama and glitz, we're sucked into caring
about Scott's dilemmas — just as we once
cared about whether Cinderella would
make it to the ball.
Scott is the son of a couple of former ball
room-dance champions intent on ensuring
that their gifted progeny win the Pan-Pacif
ic Grand Prix Ballroom Dancing Competi
tion. He's been training from the age of six
and, with his skills and charm, could easily
win.
But there's one thing in his way. Scott in
sists on dancing his way, with his own orig
inal steps, which the all-powerful Ballroom
Dance Federation prohibits. His unwilling
ness to conform sends his family, friends
and dance partner into spasms of dismay.
"Did I do something wrong?" his hysterical
mother asks. "Did I fail him as a mother?"
With just six weeks until the big compe
tition, the renegade Scott finds himself part
ner-less and fast on the road to destruction.
Enter Fran (Tara Morice), the ugly duckling
who has a dream of her own: to be his new
partner, dancing his way. Impossible, Scott
thinks; she's a novice dancer, and she's awk
ward and unattractive to boot. But he gives
her a chance, and the romance that follows
makes you want to get up and dance.
Aside from sensational dancing, cos
tumes and music, the self-mocking melo
drama of the film is its strongest point. The
ballrooom-dance world is treated with as
much gravity as if it were the Olympics, or
an LSAT exam.
The dance federation officials are slim/

immoral villains with a vested interest in
making Scott lose. Scott is a handsome hero
intent on achieving his noble goal, no mat
ter what it takes. Fran is the classic underdog
with a greasy face and glasses, pitted against
daunting competitors like the glamorous
Tina Sparkle, with whom Scott could easily
win the competition. It's as formulaic as a
"Batman" episode — but it knows that, and
laughs at itself.

Mercurio is the primo Prince Charming,
with Baryshnikov's build and eyes to make
anyone melt — not to mention amazing
dance skills. As Fran, Morice carries off the
transition from ugly duckling to swan with
out losing the sincere, humble manner that
makes her so perfect for the part.
Even if you think you've outgrown fairy
tales, go see "Strictly Ballroom." We all need
a little magic in our lives from time to time.

Miss Daisy would
drive away from
newest Uhry flick

Rich In Love

"Rich in Love" would be better titled "Poor
in Plot and Acting." Screenwriter Alfred Uhry
("Driving Miss Daisy") attempts to capture
the unpredictability of modern-day society,
but instead creates a jumbled story with no
coherence save its total lack of credibility.
The story begins when 17-year-old Lu
cille Odom (Kathryn Erbe) discovers a letter
announcing that her mother has set off to
start "a second life." Lucille quickly rewrites
the note to soften the blow to her father,
who is, as he puts it, knocked off his perch.

Lucille's quiet understanding of her
mother's need for independence leads us to
expect a female-affirming movie like "Thel
ma and Louise," right down to the southern
setting.
But the arrival of Lucille's older sister Rae
(Suzy Amis) and her husband Billy Mc-
Queen (Kyle MacLachlan) causes all
thoughts of the mother to vanish.
Suddenly, the movie turns into a portrait

of the modern American family dealing
with modern American issues: divorce and
dating, abortion, race relations, first ro
mance, change vs. tradition. Life isn't "nor
mal" anymore, and poor Lucille just can't
cope.
But do we care? Her acting is so emotion
less and inconsistent that it's hard enough to
sympathize with her, let alone keep track of
all of the movie's schizophrenic subplots.
Even less credible are Rae and Billy. She's
an unpredictable daredevil whose dubbed
singing is as phony as her attachment to
Billy. He's a well-bred Ken-doll Yankee who
plays a one-dimensional sex kitten in some
parts, and a soulful soothsayer in others.
Arid together, they're nothing but a pair of
rutting dogs in heat.
The only faintly redeeming perfor
mances are delivered by the father (Albert
Finney) and his new fling Vera (Piper Lau
rie). He mopes around the house mumbling
nonsense and eating potato-chip-and-may
onnaise sandwiches until Laurie's madcap
hairdresser rescues him from depression,
injecting a shot of color into the film with
her beehive hairdo and angel-food cakes.
But not even angel-food cake can rescue
this hopelessly aimless movie. As the cur
tains close on Lucille happily driving down
a highway towards independence to the
sound of an upbeat rock tune, you won't
share in the intended isn't-life-just-so un
predictable-and-wonderful mood. Instead

you'll be wondering whether there's any
chance you might get a refund for your
seven bucks.

Cured of writer's
block, an ex-'Fink'
turns to directing

Mac

"There's only two ways to do something.
There's my way, and there's the right way.
And they're both the same thing." So says
Mac, the proud, determined second-genera
tion Italian-American whose carpentry
work is his greatest love.
"Mac" marks the acclaimed actor John
Turturro's directorial debut; he wrote the
film in collaboration with Brandon Cole as a
tribute to his father. Turturro plays his father
Mac, alongside an impressive cast including
his old friends Michael Badalucco and Carl
Capotorto as his two brothers, and actress
Katherine Borowitz, as his wife.
In the film, Mac dreams of breaking with
his unethical boss to build his own construc
tion company with his brothers. Inspired by
his father, he struggles to make his unlikely
dream come true. It's a film about work and
family values, about simple, everyday labor
ers who make their trade an art.
Turturro's visual style is intimate and im
mediate. He films the construction scenes
with a r ealism that combines documentary
style precision with original twists such as
slow-motion and jump cuts. As manure-col
ored mortar oozes from a crane, you can
practically smell the carpenter's world. He's
clearly been influenced by his past directors
Spike Lee and the Coen brothers ("Jungle
Fever," "Barton Fink").
But he makes his film original by giving it
a tone as unique as its subject matter. Despite
its realism — or maybe because of it —
"Mac" always verges on the absurd. As Mac
tells his brothers of his dream of starting the
Vitelli Brothers Construction Company, he's
sitting on the toilet, pants down, with a ciga
rette in one hand and a drink in the other.
"Mac" is loaded with sensitive moments,
but they're all undercut by comical details.
Even in the most dramatic scenes — when
Mac violently unleashes his hatred of his for
mer boss Polowski — a pleasant Irish folk
tune plays in the background. Afterwards, a
golden sun sets on the wheat field where the
beaten boss lays, pants ripped, one cheek of
his rear end comically exposed.
He includes no underscore, no sex or vio
lence, no Hollywood zingers or shocking,
melodramatic events. Instead, he highlights
the entertaining aspects of real life — and it
works.
Turturro's manic energy is perfect for the
Mac character. His devotion and high stan
dards border on psychotic; he's always either
quietly brewing or exploding with passion.
The two brothers, Vico (Badalucco) and
Bruno (Capotorto), are equally well-cast.
And Ellen Barkin makes a comical appear
ance as Oona, an airheaded artist's model
who sends Mac's two brothers into spasms of
lust. "Mac" earned Turturro the best first
time director award at the 1992 Cannes Film
Festival — and rightly so.
