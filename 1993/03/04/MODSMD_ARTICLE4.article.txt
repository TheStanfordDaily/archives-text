# Lawsuit on lead levels leading to new policy
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
University officials are negotiating a new
policy on lead paint testing and removal in
Escondido Village in an effort to settle a
class-action suit brought against Stanford
in December.
Law school student Sarah Dennison-
Leonard, her husband Charles and the Oak
land-based Environmental Law Founda
tion brought suit against Stanford claiming
that the University is "negligently conduct
ing activities . . . that led to and are still
leading to risk of lead exposure in the Es

condido Village complex area."
James Wheaton, the law foundation's
president, said his organization is still "tak
ing the basic steps to keep (the suit) alive"
but for>now they are "working with Stan
ford in trying to find an agreeable mecha
nism" to test lead levels on surfaces in Es
condido and remedy problems where they
are detected.
Wheaton said they are giving Stanford "a
good faith chance" to produce an acceptable
policy and settle the issue without litiga
tion.
Senior University Counsel Lee Thomp
son confirmed that proposals and com

ments continue to be discussed by the Uni
versity and the foundation.
Thompson said he was hopeful a policy
could be agreed on and costly litigation
avoided. "If I didn't think (a settlement was
possible) we wouldn't be having this discus
sion," he said.
The University and the foundation will
meet in a court conference in mid-summer,
and Thompson said by then he hopes to ei
ther have a settlement or clear indications
that one is forthcoming.
"To me, the bottom line (is to) remove
the danger," Sarah Dennison-Leonard said.
"All we want is a safe and decent place to

live."
The Dennison-Leonards filed suit after a
test of their 2-year-old daughter Carlie's
hair showed traces of lead. While the
amount of lead the test showed was too
small to cause health danger, Dennison-
Leonard said she is still concerned, adding
that, in her opinion, "there is no level of ex
posure that is safe."
Dennison-Leonard said she would like to
see the University use some of the revenue
that comes from Escondido Village rents to
remove at least interior apartment surfaces
covered with lead-based paint.
"The tenants are entitled to the
benefit from the rent," she said.
Escondido Village has 1,335
apartments, each rented for
approximately $700 a month.
Thompson said implementing
any such proposal could be "a real
problem" because of the hazards

that may be created by the lead
removal process and the need to
provide alternate living quarters
while the lead abatement is done.
If the University and the Envi
ronmental Law Foundation do not
reach a settlement, the case will pro
ceed to litigation, which could be
costly if Stanford is found negligent.
The suit, in part, charges that Stan
ford is violating California's Propo
sition 65, the Safe Drinking Water
and Toxics Enforcement Act. The
act requires businesses to notify
individuals of substances on their
property that cause cancer or repro
ductive harm.
Damages under Prop. 65 can
run as high as $2,500 per viola
tion of the act per day.
Dennison-Leonard said she
considers the "financial penalties
(as) more of a lever" to get the
University to remove the danger
and provide acceptable testing
and abatement standards.
But Wheaton said he had told
Stanford that the foundation does
not feel anyone should "be allowed
to simply violate I state environmen
tal standards! and then simply come
back and comply in the future."
