That lucky ole Ray

Ray Charles

As opposed to watching Dixie Carter age
on screen during "Georgia on My Mind" or
Republican delegates suffer from an intense
burst of rhythm-deficiency while clapping
along with "Hit the Road, Jack," listening to
Ray Charles'' latest album, the deceptively ti
tled "Ray Charles," is a pleasurable experi
ence.
"Ray Charles" opens with the horrid "My
World," in which an annoyingly loud back
beat pushes Charles' voice into the back
ground. But the album quickly regains its
footing with "A Song for You" and "So Help
Me God," two songs which feature the artist's
inimitable vocal talents. The latter tune is es
pecially noteworthy; with it, Charles shows
younger artists the true meaning of "artistic
daring."
"Special" duets with Chaka Khan and
ground-breaking Claymation music videos
do not constitute "artistic daring." "Artistic
daring" is the ability to shock and pleasantly
surprise the audience. With a gospel hymnal
in the middle of an eclectic album, Charles
does just that.
The legend shifts gears from rock to soul
to gospel effortlessly — the only truly poor
song on the album is the aforementioned
"My World." "One Drop of Love" and "Let
Me Take Over" are far better rock efforts,
though neither will join "Hit the Road, Jack"
as radio standards.
But don't buy this release for Charles'
foray into rock 'n' roll. Purchase it for bal
lads like "If I Could," undoubtedly the
album's most powerful song. One of the
few performances that also does not fea
ture those damn Rayettes, "If I Could" is to
Ray Charles what "What a Wonderful
World" was to Louis Armstrong — not his
most technically proficient or complex
song, but one of his most moving and sat
isfying.
And, hopefully, songs like "If I Could"
will be around long, long after those stupid
Pepsi commercials fade from memory.

This is Acid Jazz, Vol. II

Coming back strong in the sequel. Not as
strong as the original, but stronger than, say,
"Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom."
Instinct's "This Is Acid Jazz Volume II"
does for American Acid Jazzers what "Vol
ume I" did for the style's London pioneers:
Introduce them to Tower Records-buying,
CD-using demographics.
Acid Jazz surged out of London's 1987
Acid Summer — the same summer Acid
House took off. But don't look to hear any
winding hours of FM wave modulation and
booming bass. Rather expect a mix of jazz,
hip-hop, reggae and house geared towards
dancing — but welcoming expressions of
complexity and creativity true to the chordal
structures and improvisation emphasis of
the style's jazz roots.
As collections, both albums' strengths lie
within their comprehensiveness. In "Volume
II," Instinct brought together many labels,
including San Francisco's Luv 'n Haight, and
New York City's Newßreed.

Expect a mix of jazz,
hip-hop, reggae and
house geared towards
dancing.

Both Luv 'n Haight and Newßreed have
built themselves into their respective city's
major anchors for an emerging number of
jazz, soul and funk artists pushing the differ
ent music genres' conventions into a whole
new range of technologies like sampling, and
a whole new range of sounds appealing to
club dancers, instead of lounge aficionados.
Some of the stronger cuts on the album
include 2 Tuff's "Jazz Thang" — on the slow
jam tip, but with more hypnotic vocals than
anything Shai or Paperboy could push onto
the charts at Hot 97.7 — and Heavy Shift's
"Cutting Loose," an old-school, drum-ma
chine-driven sax solo with an analog synth
bass from the crunchiest of crunch grooves.
"Volume II" has weaknesses too. This isn't
an album for people already into the scene:
much of the collaborative efforts ended up
re-releasing tracks available on their home
label with entire B-sides of remixes. And if
you have strong inclinations for certain
sounds like hip-hop, you'll have to wade
through the other cuts to get what you're in
terested in.
Also, Instinct missed a few noteworthy la
bels on the collection: New Jersey's Kaleido
scope Records, which relies on heavy vocals
and adds jazz structures to house and disco;
L.A.'s Delicious Vinyl subsidiary "Brass,"
which offers a more soulful leaning; and
Brooklyn's "Beat Bop," which is definitely on
the hip-hop tip.
Acid Jazz still has a club sound, and most

of its labels only press vinyl. But if majors
such as Blue Note, Tommy Boy and Warner
Bros, find success with recent efforts to break
the style into large scale, maybe the smaller,
pioneering labels will have a reason to risk
mass distribution.

SF-based band's
muses are drugs
death & insanity

Swell

Pseudo-punk meets the mainstream and
INXS moves into the garage in emerging
group Swell's debut album, M ... Well?"
Swell clearly wants to emphasize its oh
so-urban San Francisco roots and establish
itself as the sound of the "ugly, dangerous"
Tenderloin district, where they "live, re
hearse and record."
"There's lots of drugs, death and people
living on the edge of sanity," the band claims
in its press release. "It affects the atmosphere
in the music."
While Swell's sound is distinctively
garage-band, its music is entirely too remini
scient of the currently-hip Seattle sound to
be either revolutionary or uniquely San
Francisco.
That doesn't entirely discount Swell,
however. The group creates a powerful blend
of electric and acoustic guitars set to a delib
erate, driving beat. This sound promises

Swell a good shot at breaking into the pop
music scene — if they can make flashy
videos.
Lead singer David Freel's deep, deliberately
throaty voice recalls Pink Floyd at his deepest
and throatiest. At Freel's higher and brighter
moments, his voice is reminiscent of Michael
Hutchence's, but the slow beats behind many
of the songs, especially "Everything," make
Swell sound like INXS on downers.
Alas, originality is not one of Swell's
greatest virtues. The album's tracks sound so
much alike that the less-than-fully-attentive
listener would probably think they were lis
tening to one long, continuous song.
But at least it's a pretty good song. Despite
the album's shortcomings, Swell does have
potential — once the band develops a more
unique sound and introduces some variety
into its repertoire.
Like any new band trying to break into
the music scene, they face the challenge of
desperately needing to self-promote while
wanting to seem "too cool" doing so. In
stead, Swell just takes the blatant route: the
album opens with a band member's plea for
good reviews and recording contracts.
Apparently, even before their debut
album was cut, the band members have been
into the 'zine (underground magazine)
scene. How urbanly hip. Since their 'zine
"Swollen" 's third issue coincided with the
release of their album, they dedicated the
publication to "pure, shameless, blatant and
of course, completely self-centered, — PRO
MOTION."
Well, as long as they're going to 'fess up to
it.

But don't buy this release for Charles'
foray into rock 'n' roll. Purchase it for bal
lads like "If I Could," undoubtedly the
album's most powerful song. One of the
few performances that also does not fea
ture those damn Rayettes, "If I Could" is to
Ray Charles what "What a Wonderful
World" was to Louis Armstrong — not his
most technically proficient or complex
song, but one of his most moving and sat
isfying.
And, hopefully, songs like "If I Could"
will be around long, long after those stupid
Pepsi commercials fade from memory.

This is Acid Jazz, Vol. II

Coming back strong in the sequel. Not as
strong as the original, but stronger than, say,
"Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom."
Instinct's "This Is Acid Jazz Volume II"
does for American Acid Jazzers what "Vol
ume I" did for the style's London pioneers:
Introduce them to Tower Records-buying,
CD-using demographics.
Acid Jazz surged out of London's 1987
Acid Summer — the same summer Acid
House took off. But don't look to hear any
winding hours of FM wave modulation and
booming bass. Rather expect a mix of jazz,
hip-hop, reggae and house geared towards
dancing — but welcoming expressions of
complexity and creativity true to the chordal
structures and improvisation emphasis of
the style's jazz roots.
As collections, both albums' strengths lie
within their comprehensiveness. In "Volume
II," Instinct brought together many labels,
including San Francisco's Luv 'n Haight, and
New York City's Newßreed.

Expect a mix of jazz,
hip-hop, reggae and
house geared towards
dancing.

Both Luv 'n Haight and Newßreed have
built themselves into their respective city's
major anchors for an emerging number of
jazz, soul and funk artists pushing the differ
ent music genres' conventions into a whole
new range of technologies like sampling, and
a whole new range of sounds appealing to
club dancers, instead of lounge aficionados.
Some of the stronger cuts on the album
include 2 Tuff's "Jazz Thang" — on the slow
jam tip, but with more hypnotic vocals than
anything Shai or Paperboy could push onto
the charts at Hot 97.7 — and Heavy Shift's
"Cutting Loose," an old-school, drum-ma
chine-driven sax solo with an analog synth
bass from the crunchiest of crunch grooves.
"Volume II" has weaknesses too. This isn't
an album for people already into the scene:
much of the collaborative efforts ended up
re-releasing tracks available on their home
label with entire B-sides of remixes. And if
you have strong inclinations for certain
sounds like hip-hop, you'll have to wade
through the other cuts to get what you're in
terested in.
Also, Instinct missed a few noteworthy la
bels on the collection: New Jersey's Kaleido
scope Records, which relies on heavy vocals
and adds jazz structures to house and disco;
L.A.'s Delicious Vinyl subsidiary "Brass,"
which offers a more soulful leaning; and
Brooklyn's "Beat Bop," which is definitely on
the hip-hop tip.
Acid Jazz still has a club sound, and most

of its labels only press vinyl. But if majors
such as Blue Note, Tommy Boy and Warner
Bros, find success with recent efforts to break
the style into large scale, maybe the smaller,
pioneering labels will have a reason to risk
mass distribution.

SF-based band's
muses are drugs
death & insanity

Swell

Pseudo-punk meets the mainstream and
INXS moves into the garage in emerging
group Swell's debut album, M ... Well?"
Swell clearly wants to emphasize its oh
so-urban San Francisco roots and establish
itself as the sound of the "ugly, dangerous"
Tenderloin district, where they "live, re
hearse and record."
"There's lots of drugs, death and people
living on the edge of sanity," the band claims
in its press release. "It affects the atmosphere
in the music."
While Swell's sound is distinctively
garage-band, its music is entirely too remini
scient of the currently-hip Seattle sound to
be either revolutionary or uniquely San
Francisco.
That doesn't entirely discount Swell,
however. The group creates a powerful blend
of electric and acoustic guitars set to a delib
erate, driving beat. This sound promises

Swell a good shot at breaking into the pop
music scene — if they can make flashy
videos.
Lead singer David Freel's deep, deliberately
throaty voice recalls Pink Floyd at his deepest
and throatiest. At Freel's higher and brighter
moments, his voice is reminiscent of Michael
Hutchence's, but the slow beats behind many
of the songs, especially "Everything," make
Swell sound like INXS on downers.
Alas, originality is not one of Swell's
greatest virtues. The album's tracks sound so
much alike that the less-than-fully-attentive
listener would probably think they were lis
tening to one long, continuous song.
But at least it's a pretty good song. Despite
the album's shortcomings, Swell does have
potential — once the band develops a more
unique sound and introduces some variety
into its repertoire.
Like any new band trying to break into
the music scene, they face the challenge of
desperately needing to self-promote while
wanting to seem "too cool" doing so. In
stead, Swell just takes the blatant route: the
album opens with a band member's plea for
good reviews and recording contracts.
Apparently, even before their debut
album was cut, the band members have been
into the 'zine (underground magazine)
scene. How urbanly hip. Since their 'zine
"Swollen" 's third issue coincided with the
release of their album, they dedicated the
publication to "pure, shameless, blatant and
of course, completely self-centered, — PRO
MOTION."
Well, as long as they're going to 'fess up to
it.

Ray Charles

As opposed to watching Dixie Carter age
on screen during "Georgia on My Mind" or
Republican delegates suffer from an intense
burst of rhythm-deficiency while clapping
along with "Hit the Road, Jack," listening to
Ray Charles'' latest album, the deceptively ti
tled "Ray Charles," is a pleasurable experi
ence.
"Ray Charles" opens with the horrid "My
World," in which an annoyingly loud back
beat pushes Charles' voice into the back
ground. But the album quickly regains its
footing with "A Song for You" and "So Help
Me God," two songs which feature the artist's
inimitable vocal talents. The latter tune is es
pecially noteworthy; with it, Charles shows
younger artists the true meaning of "artistic
daring."
"Special" duets with Chaka Khan and
ground-breaking Claymation music videos
do not constitute "artistic daring." "Artistic
daring" is the ability to shock and pleasantly
surprise the audience. With a gospel hymnal
in the middle of an eclectic album, Charles
does just that.
The legend shifts gears from rock to soul
to gospel effortlessly — the only truly poor
song on the album is the aforementioned
"My World." "One Drop of Love" and "Let
Me Take Over" are far better rock efforts,
though neither will join "Hit the Road, Jack"
as radio standards.
But don't buy this release for Charles'
foray into rock 'n' roll. Purchase it for bal
lads like "If I Could," undoubtedly the
album's most powerful song. One of the
few performances that also does not fea
ture those damn Rayettes, "If I Could" is to
