■ Army of Darkness
Sam Raimi's latest addition to his
hit "Evil Dead" movies is a shame
lessly entertaining joyride. Our
hero, Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds
himself trapped in medieval Eng
land, where he must defeat the
hordes of the undead and return to
the present. The fight sequences,
special effects and cinematogra
phy are all top-notch, rivalling any
blockbuster. Mindless fun. R
■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's
got America abuzz? Well you won't
find out, unless you see writer-di
rector Neil Jordan's offbeat hit.
Stephen Rea, Forest Whitakerand
newcomer Jaye Davidson are at
the top of their game in this brilliant
web of love and intrigue involving
the IRA, a British soldier and an
enigmatic hairdresser. Shades of
"Vertigo," it's a definite must-see.

■ Falling Down
Michael Douglas plays a laid-off
defense worker who loses it while
trapped in an L.A. traffic jam. On
his way home, he leaves a trail of
trashed Korean grocery stores,
dead Latino gangbangers and ter
rified fast-food employees in his
wake. So why's it so bad? Because
the writer and director think that
terrorizing Koreans and shooting
helpless Latinos is funny. Rent
"The Terminator" instead. R
■ Sommersby
Richard Gere plays Jack Som
mersby, a callous, irresponsible
scoundrel who leaves his Southern

hometown to fight in the Civil War.
But when he returns home, he's a
socially enlightened, sensitive man
with the soul of a poet. Changed
man — or charming impostor?
Gere keeps his wife Laurel (Jodie
Foster), the townspeople and the
audience guessing right up until
the end. PG-13
■ The Temp
First there were killer one-night
stands. Then came killer nannies
and killer writers. Now Lara Flyn
Boyle's killer secretary joins
Sharon Stone, Rebecca De Mor
nay and Glenn Close's pantheon
of psychotic femme fatales. She
joins a baked-goods company and
promptly helps her boss ascend
through the company ranks. But
when low-cut blouses and skirts
riding high on her shapely legs
aren't enough to secure her a pro
motion — well hell hath no fury like
a woman trapped beneath the
glass ceiling. Sexist, misogynist
and god-awful. R
■ Tousles Matins du Monde
The Depardieus, pere and fils, star
as the young and old Marin Marais,
a virtuoso viol player in the court of
Louis XIV. As a swaggering, hor
monal youth, he seeks music
lessons from the brilliant Sainte
Colombe (Jean-Pierre Marielle.)
But his callous behavior results in
tragedy and heartbreak, two
lessons that he must learn before
he can transcend mere talent. A vi
sual and aural masterpiece. Not
