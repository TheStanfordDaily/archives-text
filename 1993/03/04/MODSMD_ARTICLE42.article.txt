Sadness swept America when Brian Mulroney an
nounced that he wouldn't run for re-election as Prime
Minister of Canada. Perhaps we can assuage our grief by
renting some films by Canadian directors.
What do Scanners, The Brood and The Dead Zone
have in common? All were directed by Canada's preeminent au
teur David Cronenberg, whose film Naked Lunch swept Cana
da's equivalent of the Oscars. But to see his best work, rent his
1988 release Dead Ringers. Jeremy Irons turned in two subtly
nuanced performances as twin gynecologists who act out their
destructive impulses both upon themselves and their helpless
patients. The film so terrified director Martin Scorsese that he
refused to meet Cronenberg. Now that's an endorsement.
Before Cronenberg, there was Norman Jewison, who direct
ed such acclaimed films as In Country and A Soldier's
Story. Go back a couple decades for his classic In The Heat
Of the Night starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. Poitier
played the indomitable Mr. Tibbs in Jewison's searing look at
race relations in the South through the prism of a murder mys
tery.
There's no one hotter in independent film than Toronto
based ciniaste Atom Egoyan, a writer-director obsessed with
the alienating effect of technology upon its users. His break
through hit Family Viewing, examined a family whose ad
diction to phone sex and VCR's rendered them dysfunctional.
He followed up on it with Speaking Parts, a story of men
and women who can't love real people, only images of them.
But Egoyan's most accessible and most chilling film was
1992's The Adjuster, whose central character, an insurance
claims agent, takes control of his clients' lives by catering to
their every desire. He meets his match in a wealthy, sex-crazed
couple that seeks to use his home as a location for their erotic
games. A strikingly original talent, Egoyan's voice will resonate
for years to come.
