Ever dance with the Vejigantes/Devil Masks by the
pale moon light?
Me neither.
But March 3-6, the Department of Drama will be pre
senting a new English translation of "Vejigantes/Devil
Masks" in the Nitery Theater. The show blends whirling
bomba dance, family drama and trenchant social criti
cism that explores racial definitions and family unity.
The show is directed by Drama graduate student
Rob Robertson who translated it from the original
Spanish, and is choreographed by Stanford Dance Di
vision director Susan Cashion.
Tickets are $9 general and $5 for student and seniors.
