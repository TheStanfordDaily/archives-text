## ...phone sex 
### 
Unless you have a speaker phone with sur
round sound and a rotating bed, phone sex prob
ably seems like an expression of loneliness. Most
likely, you thought phone sex was something to
do with a cellular while trapped in traffic with
tinted windows — especially in California, where
the police routinely give tickets to people using
inflatable love dolls to get in car-pool-only lanes.
1 mean, you wouldn't invite your best friend to
watch you have phone sex. Or maybe you would.

(And if you would, how 'bout I bring over a box of
Fetzer and a Student Directory with the Domino's
coupons still attached?) Hell, you'd probably in
vite your best friend to do a problem set, right?
And never in the history of Physics 173 has anyone
ever, ever said "We might be studying Heisen
berg's Uncertainty Principle, but I'm a sure thing."
For about 70 cents a minute, you and your best
friend can have it anyway you want it. And that's
not so bad considering Stanford is about 60 cents

a minute and you can't get any at all, no matter
how you like it.
Although phone sex remains one of the safest
forms of safer sex — unless you trip on the cord
— students can't dial 900 numbers. While 1 could
argue for our rights to get off on the First Amend
ment, I'd rather suggest an alternative: Call the
President's Office to find out how much the 7.5%
tuition increase amounts to per unit. Not only
will you get screwed, but the campus call is free.
