Remember the
last party you
went to?
No? Well, perhaps
you have a vague no
tion that you liked the
music or that the bass
player was cute, but
were just too darned
plastered to remember
which band was play
ing. Now there's a
chance to see them all.
Sponsored by the
Phi Kappa Psi frater
nity, this year's Battle
of the Bands will be
held tomorrow at 9

p.m. in Toyon Hall.
All of the local favorites are expected to
participate, including: Where's Julio,
Platypus Rex, Towhead, Uncle Wiggly,
Shagwagon, Jonestown Koolaid,
Puffer Fish, General Sherman, Mind
slam and River Bottom Groove.
They'll all be there, so you can throw bras
and undies at your favorites, or boo off the
stage the ones who suck. And there's money
on the line for the winners, so they'll all be
playing their hearts out. Come on down or
tune in to KZSU.
■ Experience the rapture
From March 3-6 the Department of
Drama will be presenting "A Festival of One
Acts." Each of play is directed by students in
the Undergraduate Directing Workshop. Di
rectors include Molly Kerr ("Here We Are"
and "Sure Thing,") Sean Davis ("San Antonio
Sunset") and N'Gai Croal ("The Stonewater
Rapture") The shows will be performed in
the Eleanor Prosser Studio, located on the
second floor of the Drama Department. Ad
mission is FREE; however, seating is limited.
■ Secret ticket sale
All ye Prince fans, make sure you're awake
before 10 a.m. this Sunday. Tickets for his lat
est concert in Berkeley go on sale at BASS
ticket outlets everywhere at this time. Be
cause Prince is playing a small venue, Rick
Chase of KM EL expects the show to sell out
quickly. Wonder if he can beat U2's record of
an hour and 30 minutes.
