Students interested in Judaism may have the
chance to live and learn together in a Jewish studies
theme house proposed to open in fall of 1994.
The house, which would bring the total number of
theme houses on campus to 11, has already received
support from faculty members, Residential Educa
tion and Hillel, a Jewish student organization, ac
cording to organizers of a meeting to be held today.
"We live in a time when everyone is into doing
their own thing culturally," said Rebecca Schwartz,
Hillel's program director. "Why shouldn't we have a
house?"
The idea for a new theme house was sparked by
the expanding Jewish studies department on cam
pus, according to graduate student Deborah Camiel,
one of the project's key organizers. "We've really be
come one of the biggest departments in the country,"
she said.
Today's meeting will lead to a "core group" of stu
dents and faculty who will draft a proposal next year
and submit it to Res Ed, Camiel said.
Res Ed has already indicated that interested stu
dents will be allowed to draw together next year so
they can begin planning the house, she added.
Res Ed Director Alice Supton called the meeting
"a very preliminary gathering to see whether stu
dents are interested" and said the theme house
might form within the next few years.
Organizers will focus on EAST House — the East
Asian Studies residence — as a model for their effort
because it is "such a great academic intellectual
example — that's what we'd like
to be, too," Camiel said.
"Primarily, our house will be
focused on academic and intellectu
al exploration. Of course, the cul
tural aspect is going to be part of
that."
She said much of the impetus
for the project came from the
Jewish Studies Department,

which "is drawing more and more
undergrads and grads."
Though the theme house is
"still in planning stage, I think it
can be a really exciting focus for
the department on campus,"
Camiel said.
Hava Megiddo, program coor
dinator for Jewish Studies, said
the theme house is not a new idea.
"Students, especially freshmen
who come here, really feel kind of
lost," Megiddo said. "It will be
nice to have such a house to make
them feel at home."
