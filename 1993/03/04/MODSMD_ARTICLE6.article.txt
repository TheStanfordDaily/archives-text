# Fountain hopping
## Dennis Nice's early-morning care keeps campus fountains flowing 
### Amanda Beacom 
At the crack of dawn, at a time
when little else on campus stirs,
Dennis Nice is busy tending to
fallen leaves and intrepid duck
lings.
But Nice isn't a biologist.
He's the caretaker of the Uni
versity fountains, rising before 6
a.m. twice a week to chlorinate
and remove debris from the cam
pus' five operating fountains.
Nice, who has been working at
Stanford for 24 years, welcomes
the four-and-a-half hours of
early morning cleaning as a "nice
break" from his normal routine.
After six years of sweeping leaves
out of dry concrete basins, Nice
says the fountains "look a lot bet
ter running than sitting there
(dry)."
Armed with a netted pole
much like those used to clean
backyard pools, Nice cruises
from his office on Bonair Siding
in an old pickup truck.
His first stop of the morning is
usually in front of the closed sec
tion of Green Library. This foun
tain is nicknamed "Old Green"
by members of the maintainance
crew who usually name the struc
tures after the nearest building.
Nice sweeps each fountain

twice a week and vacuums it
once. He also measures the
amount of chlorine in each pool,
determining if more chemicals
are necessary to kill algae and
other organisms.
Then it's off to "Back of
(Memorial) Church," a popular
backdrop for photographers of
wedding parties, especially now
that the church is open and the
fountain is running.
Making his way to the center
of campus, Nice checks in on
"Old Union." He shakes his head
at the murky quality of the water
in the campus' oldest fountain,
explaining that the lengthy peri
od of drought-induced inactivity
has taken its toll on many foun
tains.
The combined factors of heat,
dryness and aging resulted in
structural damage, including
rusted pipes beneath Old Union,
which cause poor water quality,
explains Nice.
From Old Union, Nice shifts
his attention to his favorite foun
tain, the Claw.
" It's prettier and the easiest to
take care of," he said, praising
the fountain's strong filtering
system. "I can get this one look

ing just like a (swimming) pool."
Occasionally, special campus
events warrant extra fountain
maintenance. According to
grounds supervisor Larry Atwa
ter, Big Game week and fraterni
ty rush are the two periods which
prompt the most fountain van
dalism.
Atwater remembers finding a
sheep's head perched atop the
Claw one year and various dyes
discoloring the water at other
times.
In the event of vandalism, he
said the fountains must be com
pletely drained and then refilled,
a half-day procedure costing
about $150.
In comparison, fountain hop
ping seems a harmless diversion
and Nice dismisses the Stanford
tradition as "not that big of a
problem."
Of all the fountains on Nice's

route, the pond at Terman Engi
neering Center requires the most
care, taking more than twice as
much time to clean. He visits
Terman last.
"It's the worst one," Nice said,
explaining that the willow trees
which adorn the pond's center
islands are the chief culprits.
Talk to Nice during the
spring, however, and he may sing
a new tune. With the warmer
weather comes a family of ducks
that make the pond their home
each year.
Nice said he doesn't mind
working around the birds and
admits he occasionally stops
work on their behalf to turn on a
particular faucet in which the
ducklings enjoying playing.
"After a while they get used to
you," he said.
In addition to providing a
diversion from the day-to-day
maintenance, the ducks actually
make Nice's job easier.
For the months when the
ducks make Stanford their home,
Nice said the irrigation staff fore

goes its standard practice of chlo
rination and disregards the con
sequently rampant growth of
algae in order to provide a
healthy environment for the
birds.
To Nice, the ducks' annual
visit is an important tradition.
And overall, the grounds man
considers the maintenance of the
fountains an important part of
his job. "I take pride in keeping
them looking the best that they
can," said Nice. "And they do
look pretty."
Nice's job will expand over the
next few months as several cur
rently inactive fountains are
repaired.
According to Nice, the pond
located in the middle of the Serra
Complex should be filled with
water within the next three to
four weeks.
Cracks in the rocks which line
the bottom of the pond require
repair before water may be
added.
If Nice had any say in the mat
ter, water wouldn't be the only

thing added to the Serra pond.
"I've always told them to put
lilies and goldfish in there and let
it go," he said, explaining that
with the fish, there would be no
need to clean for algae.
But "The Hoop," a favorite
among students with its distinc
tive red tubing and sunken steps,
will not be filled with water any
time soon.
Although the fountain is
"very pretty when running
right," Nice said structural flaws
in the original design mean that
it will not run again until an
extensive renovation project is
completed.
When junior Arbora Johnson
learned that some of the campus
fountains would again sport
water, she wrote her overseas
friends to relay the news to them.
"I was very excited," she said.
"The running fountains make
the campus more beautiful —
they add zest."
Dennis Nice would under
stand. "I think everybody gets a
kick out of them," he said.
