# Fountain hopping
## Dennis Nice's early-morning care keeps campus fountains flowing 
### Amanda Beacom 
At the crack of dawn, at a time
when little else on campus stirs,
Dennis Nice is busy tending to
fallen leaves and intrepid duck
lings.
But Nice isn't a biologist.
He's the caretaker of the Uni
versity fountains, rising before 6
a.m. twice a week to chlorinate
and remove debris from the cam
pus' five operating fountains.
Nice, who has been working at
Stanford for 24 years, welcomes
the four-and-a-half hours of
early morning cleaning as a "nice
break" from his normal routine.
After six years of sweeping leaves
out of dry concrete basins, Nice
says the fountains "look a lot bet
ter running than sitting there
(dry)."
Armed with a netted pole
much like those used to clean
backyard pools, Nice cruises
from his office on Bonair Siding
in an old pickup truck.
His first stop of the morning is
usually in front of the closed sec
tion of Green Library. This foun
tain is nicknamed "Old Green"
by members of the maintainance
crew who usually name the struc
tures after the nearest building.
Nice sweeps each fountain

twice a week and vacuums it
once. He also measures the
amount of chlorine in each pool,
determining if more chemicals
are necessary to kill algae and
other organisms.
Then it's off to "Back of
(Memorial) Church," a popular
backdrop for photographers of
wedding parties, especially now
that the church is open and the
fountain is running.
Making his way to the center
of campus, Nice checks in on
"Old Union." He shakes his head
at the murky quality of the water
in the campus' oldest fountain,
explaining that the lengthy peri
od of drought-induced inactivity
has taken its toll on many foun
tains.
The combined factors of heat,
dryness and aging resulted in
structural damage, including
rusted pipes beneath Old Union,
which cause poor water quality,
explains Nice.
From Old Union, Nice shifts
his attention to his favorite foun
tain, the Claw.
" It's prettier and the easiest to
take care of," he said, praising
the fountain's strong filtering
system. "I can get this one look
