# Family leave relief?
## Staff sees hope in new federal policy 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
For Stanford employees with newborns, young
children or aging parents, every new day brings the
possibility of an attack of the chicken pox or a de
bilitating stroke — and the need to take time off
work to care for loved ones.
But as shrinking staffs, demanding managers
and pressing financial woes circle in on Stanford
workers, staff hopes run high that the University
will meet their concerns when revising its family
leave policy to comply with the new federal family
leave act.
The act, signed by President Clinton Feb. 5, pro
vides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually. The
time off can be used to deal with birth, adoption,
personal sickness or the serious illness of an imme

diate family member.
While Stanford offers up to four months of dis
ability leave for pregnancy and childbirth and up to
six months unpaid leave for infant child care, other
problems such as family illness are not covered by
unpaid leave. The Office of Employee Relations is
reviewing the University's policy and plans to
modify it by August.
One staffer who has worked at Stanford for 10
years spoke cynically of University supervisors and
the current policy.
"Just having things on the books does not mean
that they happen or will be granted; it just looks
good for Stanford to have that kind of policy," she
said. "Management's attitudes can't be controlled
any more than management's prejudices can. As
long as management has the option
to say no, the policy is simply a very
nice piece of writing full of
baloney."
"Our policy leaves much to be
desired," said Sharon Parker, direc
tor of the Office of Multicultural
Development.
Parker acknowledged that the
infant care policy allows any new
parent, whether male or female, to
take an unpaid leave to care for the
new child. However, if the child
becomes ill after this period, the
parent must use his or her own sick
leave or vacation time to justify
being away from work.
"This penalizes the parent and,
in my opinion, contributes to an
unhealthy workforce because ailing
parents wait until they are abso
lutely unable to move before taking
time away from work and using
valuable personal leave," she said.
"Rare is the little child who does not
have several colds, ear aches and
other non-life-threatening illnesses
several times a year.
"Moreover, until society is trans
formed, the burden of child care
still falls predominantly to the
female parent. Therefore, women
in the workforce are penalized for
caring for their children," she said.
Often, using their own sick and
vacation time leaves employees
with no time for their own illnesses
or recreation later.
One staffer had to use all her
paid leave to take care of a home
disaster and family medical crisis.
"I was under high stress," she said.

"It was not restful. It is a pity I had
to use 'R-and-R' time for it."
Budget cuts have forced depart
ments to shrink their staffs
through attrition, making it more
difficult for workers to take leave.
While some University depart
ments permit workers "flex time"
— making up for absent time by
coming in early or on weekends —
others only allow their employees to
reduce their hours to 50, 75 or 80
percent time.
When asked if her department is
adequately staffed to cover people
who take leaves, provost's office
budget assistant Mickey Murray
laughed long and hard. "No way,"
she said. "I wish it was."
Tom Matteoli, director of
employee relations, said work is
usually assigned to other workers,
although temporary workers are
sometimes hired if an employee
takes leave unexpectedly.
For many employees, taking
unpaid leave can create a majof
financial crisis.
"Some of us who really need this
leave and live from paycheck to pay
check couldn't afford to take time
off from work," said one employee
who wished to remain anonymous.
The staffer suggested that Stan
ford offer financial aid during the
leave period — a low-interest loan
automatically deducted from the
employee's paycheck upon return.
Staffer Michael Luna, whose
partner is dying of AIDS, said in the
near future he will have to take
extended periods of time off — and
"right now we're just barely mak
ing the mortgage."
Luna, manager of facilities for
the School of Medicine, said insur
ance covers only 80 percent of his

partner's medical bills. The couple
is raising two boys, one of whom is
in college.
He said the low-interest loan
idea interested him. But, Luna said
with tears in his voice, he'd be
"more than grateful" to take
unpaid leave and maintain the
insurance benefits, "to have the
time when he needs me."
Many of the employees inter
viewed spoke of insensitive supervi
sors who act rudely, condescending
ly and refuse to believe their rea
sons for taking leave.
Luna — who has taken some
time off to care for his partner —
said his boss has been very support
ive, and Murray said she's never
had a problem with a supervisor
insensitive to her leave needs.
But one staffer said that when
her manager refused to grant her
the amount of pregnancy leave she
requested, he told her, "Well, that's
not going to keep you from having
the baby."
She said a colleague "literally fell
down sick on the job and an ambu
lance was called because the person
could not move at all. The manager
joked that 'some people will do any
thing to get out of work!' "
The staffer who had to take care
of a home disaster called her man
ager "a fair-weather friend" who
had applauded her in the past as
she won numerous work awards
but treated her after her leave as if
she were "abusing the system," she
said.
"This is what I want manage
ment to understand: Yes, some
employees abuse the system, take
long lunches, call in sick on Mon
days and Fridays, but I'm not that
sort of person."
