A Stanford Police parking
enforcement cart escaped with
only a scratch after colliding
with a Buick Regal on Campus
Drive East yesterday after
noon. The officer driving the
cart, however, wasn't as lucky.
Stanford community service
officer Ernest Brooks was
rushed to Stanford Hospital
complaining of stomach pains
after the accident.
Armando Hernandez, a Red
wood City resident who works
in Palo Alto, was lost and try
ing to find his way out of the
campus area when the accident
occurred.
Hernandez was driving his
car on Campus Drive East and
attempting to make a U-turn,
when the three-wheel parking
ticket cart — called a Cushman
— ran into his gray-colored
vehicle.
His Buick doesn't have a
mirror on the right side of the
car, so Hernandez said he
couldn't see the Cushman com
ing.
Pieces of glass scattered on
the road as the Cushman
crashed into the car's right pas
senger door and broke the car's
window.
"The Cushman surprisingly
[had] no damage," said Cali

fornia Highway Patrol officer
Scott Hall, adding that the col
lision only scraped a little
paint off the left side of the
cart.
Both vehicles were in driving
condition after the accident.
Police blocked off the Little
field Center parking lot and
restricted traffic on Campus
Drive East while surveying the
scene on the corner of Lasuen
Street.
Stanford Police responded to
the accident and rushed Brooks
to Stanford Hospital. Hall said
the safety belt Brooks was
wearing may have caused his
stomach pains.
As of 7:30 p.m. yesterday,
Brooks was still waiting to be
treated and seen for stomach
pains by Stanford Hospital doc
tors, according to a hospital
spokeswoman.
Hernandez only suffered
mild cuts on his right arm.
Accidents involving Cush
mans are rare, said Stanford
Police officer Ed Branscome.
"Our vehicles are in very few
accidents. We're very careful," he
said.
Branscome added that officers
receive special training in operating
a Cushman.
Neither driver was cited but
since the accident involved a police
car, the Highway Patrol is conduct
ing an investigation.
