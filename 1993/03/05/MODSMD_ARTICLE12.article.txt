Cleansing* stepped up
TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — U.N. and Bosnian offi
cials accused Serbs yesterday of
stepping up their "ethnic cleans
ing" campaign in eastern
Bosnia, as new allegations sur
faced of Serbs slaughtering and
raping Muslim refugees.
Serb commanders, who have
devastated Muslim enclaves in a
four-day offensive near U.S. air
drop sites, called the charges of
atrocities "wrong and malicious".
There were continued
reports of Serb atrocities in the
war-torn region around Cerska
and Koiyevic Pojje, but they

were sketchy and impossible to
confirm. Serbs have barred
access to the region after rout
ing thousands of Muslims from
their homes this week and burn
ing their villages.
The Security Council on
Wednesday night demanded a hah
to the tank-led offensive and urged
U.N. forces to be sent to the region
to protect civilians. About 10,000
Muslim refugees cowered cold and
hungry yesterday in the ruins of
Konje-vic Polje, U.N. officials said
"There is little doubt that Serb
forces, by their current offensives,
are intensifying ethnic cleansing,"
U.N. human rights envoy
Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
