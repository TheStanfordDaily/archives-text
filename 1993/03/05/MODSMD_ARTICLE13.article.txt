# Trade Center bombing' suspect arrested
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — A man described as a fol
lower of a radical Muslim cleric was arrested yes
terday in last week's World Trade Center bomb
ing when he coolly tried a third time to reclaim a
rental deposit on a van that the FBI said held the
bomb.
Mohammed Salameh, 26, appeared in federal
court in New York City last night and was
charged with aiding and abetting the bombing
and a fire that followed. The Jersey City, NJ. 112
resident was ordered held without bail. He faces
life in prison if convicted.
The van Salameh rented was the one that car
ried the bomb, and a search of his apartment
with a bomb-sniffing dog turned up bomb-mak
ing equipment including wiring and manuals on
circuitry and electromagnetic devices, the FBI
said in an affidavit filed with the court.
Papers that the suspect presented to the
rental agency several days ago were covered with
nitrates, said a government source, speaking on

condition of anonymity. Nitrates are found in
some explosives; traces of nitrates were found at
the blast site.
Friday's blast in a garage beneath the twin
towers killed five people, injured more than
1,000, left one missing and sent fear through the
nation's largest city. It carved out a crater four
stories deep.
The arrest came after detectives systematical
ly checked garage payment stubs and viewed
videotapes of entering vehicles.
The suspect rented the van from a Ryder
truck agent in Jersey City Feb. 23 and returned
less than two hours after the explosion Friday
afternoon to say it had been stolen from him in
Jersey City, said Paul Mascitelli, owner of a car
dealership that shares an office with the Ryder
agent.
The man wanted his $400 cash deposit back
but was told he would need a police report of the
theft, Mascitelli said. He said the suspect

returned Monday without the police report and
again was turned away.
On Thursday morning, the man called the
Ryder office — and spoke with an FBI agent pos
ing as a Ryder official, said Patrick GaLasso, the
truck rental agent.
The man returned to the rental office, was
given $200 back, and was arrested by eight to 10
agents as he left the office.
The suspect was affiliated with Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, a Jersey City official said, citing
reports from FBI agents to city police.
Abdel-Rahman, 54, is a blind Muslim cleric liv
ing in self-imposed exile in New Jersey after his
acquittal a decade ago in Egypt on charges that
he sanctioned the 1981 assassination of Presi
dent Anwar Sadat.
The cleric commands a following in Egypt that
analysts compare to that of the late Ayatollah
Khomeini in Iran; his message includes calls to
eradicate anyone who stands in the way of Islam.
