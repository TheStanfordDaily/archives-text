University should install
bike racks to discourage
theft, boost commuting

AS KARL MALDEN says, it
can happen to you anytime,
anywhere.
However, the type of crime that
plagues Stanford most persistently
is a different form of thievery —
bike theft. With 817 bicycles report
ed stolen on campus between Jan.
1, 1992 and Feb. 22, 1993, bike
theft is rapidly growing from a
small worry to a major problem on
the Farm.
And University transportation
officials say the statistic is due, in
large part, to the paucity of ade
quate bicycle-parking facilities on
campus. Of those bikes stolen last
year, more than 75 percent were
taken from outside student resi
dences, places where bike racks are
hard to find.
Although riders are incessantly
reminded to lock their frame and
wheel to an immovable metal
object, a lack of racks plagues the
Row, Cowell Cluster and many
older dorms.
A scarcity of parking spaces also
afflicts numerous administrative
and academic buildings. For exam
ple, the dearth of racks in the inner
Quad forces many riders to use
metal railings as hitching posts,
congesting walkwaye and hindering
wheelchair access.
When constructing new build
ings and renovating old ones, plan
ners should carefully determine the
average occupancy of structures
and install the appropriate number
of bike racks.
And the racks shouldn't consist
of flimsy, front-wheel locking struc
tures, but instead should be upside
down U-shaped racks, such as those
outside Green Library. These racks,
which can be easily bolted into the
ground, allow riders to securely
lock up their bike frames.
In addition to affecting students,

the lack of bike parking creates a
genuine concern for the great many
faculty and staff members who ride
their bicycles to work every day.
Furthermore, the deficit of
parking spots will only grow more
severe in the future. According to a
recent study of zip codes, officials
at Transportation Programs deter
mined that about 40 percent of all
Stanford employees live within
five miles of campus. If the Uni
versity plans to comply with Cali
fornia's stringent automobile-traf
fic regulations that will take effect
in the late 19905, steps must be
taken now to make bicycle com
muting a more attractive option to
these and other faculty and staff
members.
However, a draft version of the
1993-94 General Plant Improve
ments budget, which will be pre
sented to the Board of Trustees for
approval in April, shows a general
lack of attention to bicycle-parking
concerns. Of the more than $2.5
million budgeted for transportation
improvements, only $10,000 to
$20,000 will be used to improve
bike parking and safety.
While it's unrealistic to expect
increased spending in times of bud
get cuts, a re-evaluation of parking
space spending priorities should be
undertaken. A single ground-level
car parking space costs more than
$1,500, and a one-car space in a
multi-level parking structure can
run as much as $12,000. An addi
tional secure bike rack costs just a
little over $100.
Funding for the additional racks
could come from a universal bicy
cle-registration program. Current
ly, less than 10 percent of Stanford
students register their bikes and, as
a result, fewer than 5 percent of
stolen bikes are returned. A manda
tory and enforced registration pro
gram would undoubtedly increase
these numbers as well as providing
the needed funds.
Adding bike racks would help
protect Stanford students from the
most common form of crime on
campus. One hundred bike racks or
one new parking space — take
your pick.
