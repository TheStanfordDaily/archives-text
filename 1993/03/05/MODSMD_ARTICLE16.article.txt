## The 						facts of life for cultists 
### 
Remember when blair, j O ,
Natalie and Tootie stole the school
van and went to the bar in town.
After someone squealed and Mrs. Garrett
went after them, they all ended up in the
attic room living together. Maybe they
even crashed the van, I forget. Even more
so than the Dana Plato Playboy appear
ance, the . ..

Sorry about all of that. I don't know
what came over me.
SURE Escort is a silly endeavor that
amounts to a monetary black hole. All of
its members should be rounded up and
severely beaten.
(twitch)
That was sarcasm, for the two readers
who didn't get it.
With the passing of winter quarter,
the world is now securely in the grip of
1993, nearly a third of the way into the
'90s. This new decade has ushered in
such things as a new Guess jeans model,
grunge rock, a family and a bunch of
skiers with no sense of direction, and two
recent events that were neatly skirted by
the other columnists (Tish Williams
excluded, not that she isn't a columnist,
but she's a real Daily staffer and not a
rabble-rouser such as myself, oh yeah,
and she's a woman. Joel Stein also
excluded, because he usually covers just
about everything).
The bombing in New York and the

standoff between federal agents and reli
gious cultists in Waco, Texas (SIDE
NOTE: as a fun game to play while sitting
in a CIV lecture given by a guest lecturer
from beyond the grave, see how many
times you can spot the words "standoff
between federal agents and religious
cultists" in any newspaper's front page)
are really anachronisms in the '90s.
Whether the World Trade Center
bomb was planted by international ter
rorists, domestic anarchists, disgruntled
employees, a regular Joe going a bit too
far to get a better parking space or any
one else, the bombing was very un-'9os.
This is supposed to be the decade of
the New World Order. The Cpld War is
over, and George Bush toot care of
things abroad, even though domestic
issues were neglected. The world is sup
posed to be a safer place. Shared sacrifice
and community service are in. Sure, this
is the decade of death in the workplace,
but we can't restrict those Second-
Amendment rights to assault rifles and
expanding hollow-point bullets.
This wacko in Waco (credit to my
roommate's friend) is a relic of the '70s
and '80s. Televangelists, human sacrifice
cults and junk-bond schemes are so '80s,
yet this Koresh/Christ guy with many
names and more guns holds dozens of
people in his thrall. Talk about regres
sion . . . Jonestown was in the '70s for
god's (non-capital for those with personal

deities) sake. So, just what is going on?
Perhaps, these events are simply the
last gasp of the dying '80s. The govern
ment hunts down the last of the psycho
cult leaders, terrorists cry for attention
in a world increasingly unsympathetic to
their causes and Michael Jackson lip
syncs at the Super Bowl. At least no
Israeli jets are screaming across the
Lebanese border. Yet, hardly a day goes
by that an Israeli or Palestinian isn't!
shot, knifed or beaten to death in the
same protracted conflict. Sure the wars
in Afghanistan and Central America have
ended, somewhat, but bullets from the
same factories from either side of the
Bering Strait are flying elsewhere.
What we have is 10 more years of
weapons technology and 10 more years of
environmental degradation, but no
more common sense or peaceful tenden
cies than we did 10, 20 or 100 years ago.
Right now, I'm going to go into the
bathroom and start one of the showers
dripping. I bet it'll take at least until mid
night for it to get turned off.

Kenny's pet slug would like to know why
the cultists buried a bus in their under
ground stronghold.
