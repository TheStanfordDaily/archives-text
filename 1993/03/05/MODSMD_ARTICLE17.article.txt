Radical feminism focused on behavior, not individuals

Matt kelso appears to
believe that his voice has been
somehow suppressed by what he
calls "the hard-core liberal left's radical
destructive feminist ideology." With a bit
of a whimper he contends that "men
have been stifled in espousing their mas
culinity ...
First I'd like Kelso to explain what
sort of masculinity he wishes he could
espouse. Wolf whistles and comments on
breast size to passing women were, until
recently, an expression of masculinity.
Date rape was once a way to "prove"
one's masculinity. Getting a woman
drunk and then having sex with her was
once a sure token of being masculine. Oh,
and of course, the epitome of masculine
expression was once to take a baseball bat
and beat a homosexual to death. In some
places, these things are still parts of
expressing one's "masculinity."
Are these the things which Kelso
would like to espouse? Kelso says "it's
hard to imagine how men can be mascu
line, let alone act naturally towards
females, if society demeans masculinity
as evil."
If Kelso's masculinity involves club
bing his woman and dragging her to his
cave, then maybe it's just as well men
cannot act "naturally" towards women.
Certainly part of feminism is questioning
those so-called "natural" behaviors, ask-

ing how they truly affect women and
changing the "masculine" behaviors
which hurt womenT I'm not really sorry if
Kelso finds that inconvenient in his dat
ing endeavors.
However, I think Kelso has very little
to worry about; I truly doubt America
has ceased to be a fairly male-dominated
and sexist culture.
American women have indeed done
much to alleviate things, and it is hardly
a slap at them to say their fight for jus
tice is part of a long tradition of a strenu
ous, uphill and continuing battle against
sexism.
It is unfortunate, but sexism still
exists.
How many women are in Congress?
How many women have been on the
Supreme Court? How many women have
been President? Why was Hillary Clin
ton derided for not staying home and
baking cookies? How many women are
CEOs of mtyor corporations? Why must
rape victims undergo questioning which
would be ludicrous were it a case of
armed robbery? (A rape victim is asked
whether or not she dressed provocatively
and thereby was "asking for it"; imagine
a mugging victim being asked whether
or not he or she was dressed in an
expensive suit and was thus "asking to
be mugged"). Unless Kelso and I live in
different societies, this country is still

quite sexist. I cannot quite see that
being "too afraid or too proud to consid
er men as 'equals' " is really much of an
issue.
Like Kelso, I also disagree with the
"man-equals-enemy theory"; luckily the
so-called "theory" is nothing more than
pathetic propaganda put out by knee-jerk
reactionaries in order to caricature radi
cal feminism.
It is not men radical feminism oppos
es; it is violent and coercive behavior by
men, which radical feminism fights
against.
It is restrictive and demeaning soci
etal structures created by men which
feminists oppose. The disempowering
and demeaning of women is opposed in
general, whether or not it is perpetrated
by men or women. The "left" opposes
both men and women who block access
to abortion clinics.
Radical feminism's focus is toward
empowering women and exploring issues
from a woman's standpoint; men, to put
it simply, no longer occupy their tradi
tional place in the spotlight, in such a
framework.
Indeed, it would hardly be radical for
radical feminists to place "masculinity"
at the center of their analytical gaze.
Audre Lorde notes that "women of
today are still being called upon to
stretch across the gap of male ignorance,

and to educate men as to our existence
and our needs. This is an old and prima
ry tool of all oppressors to keep the
oppressed occupied with the master's
concerns."
It is unfair and unreasonable to
demand that women, ignored for cen
turies, soothe ii\jured male egos and
spend precious time and energy paying
much attention to Kelso's "masculine
viewpoint," a perspective traditionally
considered both universal and normative
already.
I would find the complaints of men
like Kelso, who believe they are being
silenced, laughable were they not
pathetic. Kelso fears being labeled a
sexist.
Perhaps rather than complaining
about his fears of being called a sexist, he
should carefully examine his own behav
iors and attitudes, and change the ones
which are sexist.
If at some point, Kelso believes an
action or belief is wrongly labeled as
"sexist," then he should clearly and
coherently explain why. He, too, can
"roar" rather than accuse, and he
should do so, instead of insecurely
whining about being stifled by some
phantom, undefined "political correct
ness."
