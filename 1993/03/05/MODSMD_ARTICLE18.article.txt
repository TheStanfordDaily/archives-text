# Stanford not guilty for federal deficit or cuts in government groups
## 
### 
Kent Trego's March 2 letter shows a
great deal of ignorance, concerning both
national economics and recent events at
Stanford.
The tax increases and decreased gov
ernment spending that are foremost in
everyone's mind at present are not the

result of Stanford's actions, as Trego's
argument would have us believe, but are
the inevitable consequences of a period
of world-wide economic recession.
The possible elimination of the
National Endowment for the Arts and
the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is not an event for
which Stanford, or other universities
involved in the indirect-cost frauds,
should be held accountable; it is an
international economic slump, rather
than money stolen from the United
States government, that could lead to

the demise of these programs.
As for "repaying the money acquired
by wrongful means," Stanford is, in
fact, taking steps to rectify the inappro
priate indirect-cost charges made over
the last decade. On May 9, 1991, for
example, the Office of the Chief of
Naval Research accepted a check for
over a million dollars from Stanford, a
repayment for items charged during
1980-81 and 1987-88; Stanford was
already making amends during the Con
gressional hearings.
I fail to see what connection this

issue has with Stanford's centennial
goals. $1,269 billion was donated to the
Centennial Campaign, and, as I under
stand it, most donors specified particu
lar uses for their money.
Memorial Church has been reopened,
three new dormitories house hundreds
of undergraduates and countless other
projects continue at this very moment.
You need only take a short walk around
campus to see that our Centennial goals
will and are being reached.
