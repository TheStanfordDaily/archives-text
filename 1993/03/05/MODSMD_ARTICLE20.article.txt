# Repetition
## Joel Stein: Perfume for Reality 
### 
Nightmarish repetition. Like when that
damn ball keeps bouncing down the
stairs right into that expensive vase Mom
always warned us about. Repetition on
top of repetition. Like when, as 11-year
olds who should have been outside mak
ing fun of fat kids, we got excited at the
prospect of watching, yet again, the
episode where that damn ball keeps
bouncing down the stairs right into that
expensive vase Mom always warned us
about.
Even on Broadway, where, not long
ago, producers were hip to nothing but
the most ridiculous, inherently irritating
pitches ("No, the whole cast will be on
rollerskates — for the whole show." "Pic
ture this: They're in Vietnam and they're
scared, so they sing."), a Bradylike-sense
of repetition is setting in.
This spring Broadyway offers: "The
Goodbye Girl" (movie), "Kiss of the Spi
der Woman" (book and movie), "Tommy"
(album, movie and concert) and "Annie

Warbucks"(second attempt at an "Annie"
sequel that will never see the stage).
Even fashion, which successfully
transformed it's lack of creativity into
something hip by calling it "retro," has
become perversely repetitive, and, yes, a
little too Bradyesque. Everyone knows
platform shoes are an insult to the aes
thetic, but at least they're a time-tested
insult to the aesthetic.
Repetition offers a kind of safety that's
hard to find anywhere else. It's an oddly
comforting feeling to know you can open
up the paper in the morning and find the
Dallas Mavericks have still only won four
games. And it's an even nicer thought to
know that every game the fans come, the
television station broadcasts and the guy
on ESPN with the huge forehead
earnestly reports the score.
Now that even the globe itself doesn't
seem stable, we've reverted to a pre-
Coloumbus kind of fear. But watching
sit-coms is an easier way to find salvation
than repeating that Hail Mary thing over
and over. Because even if it's a brand new
sit-com (say, "Blossom") you'll at least
know the plot: Mistaken identity? Misun
derstood overheard phone conversation?

Child's forgotten birthday? Girlfriend
from the past who has somehow — magi
cally and without surgical scars — turned
incredibly beautiful? Actually, that one
may have been a dream from last night.
And the night before. And the night
before that.
Repetition has become so socially
acceptable that pop groups haven't con
sidered a drummer a necessary band
member for years. As a successful rapper,
an artist of words, why waste your time
writing a whole song's worth of music?
Why not just take a really good riff of
whatever happens to be in the CD player
(like the first two seconds of "Under
Pressure") and play it over and over
again. It will make people feel good and
they won't even notice the homoerotic
undertones.
The New, the Pepsi, nay, the Crystal
Pepsi Generation, built a whole culture
around bits of the past, haphazardly rear
ranged into something not quite new.
Just saying Mr. T. makes them giggle in a
relieved, kind of, I've-been-there kind of
way. Pretending that it all might add up
to something different, they've fooled
themselves into becoming the junior high

vice-principal who puts on the cheap blue
jacket and red paisley tie on the last day
of school thinking, "Maybe this year, the
kids won't start a huge food-fight in the
cafeteria."
Modern karma is going to get you, in a
cyclical, "Groundhog Day" kind of way.
It's a kind of nice, supportive feeling, like
the little adrenalin rush you can't seem
to suppress when the band plays "All
Right Now." Nobody is going to try some
thing new, something crazy; and if they
do, they'll do it again and again until you
get used to it ("Look, Madonna's breasts!
Look, Madonna'g breasts! Look, Madon
na's breasts! ...").
The only impression anyone is going to
leave in your mind is one of those nice,
hypnotic ones. Commercials are better
when they're on a lot. And, even if you
didn't want to admit it, late last summer
you started to sort of like that "Life is a
Highway" song.
And so, years from now, after you've
given the vast mtyority of your retire
ment earnings to Blockbuster ("It would
have been cheaper if we had just bought
'When Harry Met Sally' for the $39.95."
"Shut up and pass the Pringles.") you

will be deep in stage-four REM sleep,
dreaming a different Brady nightmare.
And you will be awakened by a monster,
and he or she or it will tell you that you
will relive your life over and over for all
eternity.
When this happens, stick your tongue
down its throat as far as it will go and
laugh as hard as you possibly can, given
that your tongue is half way down a mon
ster's throat. If you are brave, you will
thank it for the happiest times and the
most painful times, and for not having
any open mouth sores.
But most likely, you'll just be happy
that this time around, you'll have a bet
ter chance of getting the jokes.
