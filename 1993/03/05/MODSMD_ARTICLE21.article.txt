## Cardinal 'oops' it up, loses lead, game to ASU, 75-71 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
You know the story.
The Stanford men's basket
ball team managed to continue
what has become a Thursday
night tradition of sorts this sea
son, and this time the beneficia
ry was Arizona State. In a close
contest, the Cardinal once again
failed to convert on its final pos
session, and fell 75-71 before a
small but vocal crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn from all of this: the
(Sun) Devil made them do it.
After Stevin Smith hit a three
pointer from the top of the key to
put Arizona State up by one with
1:01 to play, Stanford guard Mar
cus Lollie fouled Marcell Capers,
sending the 65 percent foul shoot
er to the line. Capers made only
the first of two, giving the Sun
Devils a 73-71 lead. Before the
free throws, Stanford coach Mike
Montgomeiy called a timeout to
diagram a final play set for Dion
Cross.
But Cross was guarded tight
ly on the final possession, leav
ing the ball eventually in the
hands of forward Brent
Williams. Williams, who just a
minute earlier had scored on a
slashing drive to the hoop to put
the Cardinal up 71-69, had a
clear lane on the baseline for the
potential game-winner. Yet,
instead of taking the ball strong
ly to the basket to at least draw a
foul, the junior starter tried to
finesse a fall away lay in from
the middle of the key — and paid
dearly for his decision. Wun Ver
sher swatted Williams' offering
back down the floor. The ball
eventually ended up in the
hands of Capers, who scored one
final layup before time ran out.
"We can't get a better shot
opportunity than that," Mont
gomery said of Williams' effort.
"He had enough room. I thought
he could have dunked it, but
instead he laid it out and with
the athletic guys that they have,
Versher was able to block it."
Stanford (7-20, 2-13 Pacific

10 Conference) led by as many
as 18 points in the first half,
shooting 50 percent from the
field and shutting down Arizona
State's outside shooting threats.
The Cardinal big men were able
to take advantage of the Sun
Devils' small lineup, enjoying an
uncustomary seven-rebound
margin at the intermission. Jim
Morgan pulled down a team
high eight boards on the night,
and Darren Allaway typified
Stanford's aggressiveness on the
evening by standing in to take
two Arizona State offensive
fouls.
The final two minutes of the
opening period, however, were
indicative of what was to come.
The Sun Devils (17-7, 10-5), who
until that point were an unchar
acteristic 2-of-ll from three
point range, saw those numbers
improve markedly courtesy of
freshman Ron Riley. With Smith
cold from the outside, Riley calm
ly knocked down three consecu
tive treys before the break, slicing
the Cardinal's double-digit lead in
half.
"Riley's three threes at the
end of the first half were really
crucial," said Arizona State
coach Bill Frieder. "I told our
guys in the previous huddles,
'let's get into the locker room in
single digits,' and Riley helped
us do that."
"The threes were huge,"
Montgomery said. "They were
really struggling offensively, but
at the end (of the half) we made
the mistakes of not going to the
top of their screens. They're a
streaky team, and when some
one hits one like that, we have to
get out on him the next time.
Those are the things we have to
learn."
The Cardinal managed to
maintain a 10-point advantage
until Arizona State's shooters
found their touch. Smith, who in
the first half merely talked a
good game, finally began to back
up his words, nailing down five
threes in leading his team's
comeback.


Victor Cheng — Daily
Dion Cross gets a shot off over the Sun Devils' Dwayne Fontana,
but the Cardinal can't overcome an ASU second half surge in falling
75-71 at Maples last night.
The Cardinal put together a
steady team effort, with four
players finishing in double fig
ures. Stanford was unable to
come through when it mattered
most, though, tainting the rest
of the evening's display.
"We accomplished what we
set out to do, other than winning
the game," Montgomery said.
"We had every chance to win the
game, but as has been the case
this year, it didn't happen."
Cardinal Note
Stanford may not be heading to
New Orleans, but Gordon Mermin
is. Mermin, a junior from New
port, R. 1., defeated seven other
contestants in the "Champion of
Champions" shootout contest at
halftime, earning a trip to the
Final Four.
