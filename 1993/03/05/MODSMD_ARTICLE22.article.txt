# 20th loss equals Stanford record
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior Staff Writer 
As Brent Williams' shot was
swatted away from the basket by
Arizona State's Wun Versher in
the waning seconds of last
night's contest, thousands of
Cardinal fans must have experi
enced a sickening feeling of d6ja
vu. We've been through this
before.
Only this time, the loss would
not only go into the morning
paper, but into the record books.
Stanford's 75-71 loss to the Sun
Devils tied an all-time Cardinal
losing mark of 20 losses, set in
1982, 1971 and 1970. A loss
against Arizona on Sunday
would set a school record.
For most of the first half, how
ever, a loss was the furthest
thing from the Cardinal's mind.
Williams' 18-foot jumper made it
40-22 with 1:57 remaining in the
half, and it looked for a time as if
Stanford would pull off another
USC-esque win over a talented
conference opponent.
That's when it all started
turning around.
Arizona State's Ron Riley hit
back-to-back three-pointers on
the Sun Devils' next two trips
down the floor, which cut the
Cardinal lead to 12 in a matter of
28 seconds. Finally, Riley found
the bottom of the net with two
seconds left in the half to send
ASU into the locker room down
by nine.
"At that point we just hap
pened to be tired and lost concen
tration," said Cardinal coach
Mike Montgomery. "The ball
happened to go to the wrong guy,
and, boom, they get nine points."
The Sun Devils continued to
whittle away at Stanford's lead
in the second half, thanks, in
large part, to the play of Stevin
Smith.
ASU's well-placed screens
made freshman Dion Cross bat
tle to get in Smith's face on
three-point shots.
"To just put it simply, it was

hell," Cross said. "By the time I
got to the guy, he was already
somewhere else."
On a team that lives or dies by
the three-point shot, Smith was
living it up in the second half. He
took advantage of numerous
open shots, sinking five out of
nine three-pointers in the second
half alone, including a crucial
jumper from the left wing that
put the Sun Devils up 72-71 with
1:01 remaining.
"When the threes go in, we're
a better club," said ASU head
coach Bill Frieder. "We've shot
those threes all year and that's
the way we're going to play."
Stanford still had a chance to
win the game in the closing sec
onds, however, as Marcell
Capers missed the back end of a
one-and-one to leave the score
73-71.
Lollie brought the ball back
down the floor for one last shot,
setting a play designed to go to
Dion Cross on the perimeter.
Instead, Cross was double
screened out of the play, and
Brent Williams drove down the
baseline to try and tie the game.
His three-foot layup attempt was
blocked by Versher, however,
and Capers returned the loose
ball down the court for an easy
layup and the game.
"We had every chance to win
the game," Montgomery said.
"It's like five or six games this
year where we had to make a play
to win and we didn't make that
play."
Freshmen Dion Cross and
Darren Allaway combined for 26
points in the contest, but even
that didn't console the rookie
stars, the team, or their fans. On
a night when the Cardinal felt
the frustration of losing more
than perhaps any other team in
Stanford's history, Cross
reserved his sentiments for the
veterans:
"Me and Darren (Allaway),
we're young, but we have guys
on the team that are really
hurting."
