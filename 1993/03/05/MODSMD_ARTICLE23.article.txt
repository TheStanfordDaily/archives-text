# Women overcome first-half woes, down Sun Devils 86-76
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
It may not have been pretty, but a
win is a win in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
The No. 9 Cardinal women's basket
ball team survived a lackluster first-half
performance on the road last night
against Arizona State, rallying past the
Sun Devils, 86-76.
Stanford (22-5, 12-3 Pac-10) found
itself trailing by as many as nine points
with less than seven minutes remaining
in the first half and seemed in danger of
slipping out of its coveted first-place
position in the conference standings.
The Cardinal committed an unsightly
15 turnovers in the opening period as
the tenacious defense of Arizona State
(16-8, 9-6) flustered Stanford players.
"Their defense was really intense,"
said Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We had trouble taking care of the
ball."
When Stanford held the ball long
enough to release a shot, the results
were mostly unfavorable, as its
mediocre 36 percent first-half field goal
percentage would attest.
Had it not been for inspired play
early on by Stanford center Val Whit
ing, the defending national champion
Cardinal might have been blown out on
the Arizona State Activity Center floor.
The Ail-American senior racked up 14
first-period points, converting five-of
six shot attempts from the field.
"Val's a go-to player," VanDerveer
said. "She's an All-American, and she
plays like an All-American. Night in and
night out you can count on her."
Whiting proved especially effective in
leading a Stanford comeback near the

end of the period. Her back-to-back bas
kets cut the deficit to five and gave her
Cardinal teammates a much-needed
boost of momentum during the last few
minutes.
A pair of Whiting free throws, fol
lowed by an Arizona State traveling vio
lation and a Chris MacMurdo three
point play, propelled the Cardinal to a
31-30 advantage at the break, its first
lead of the game.
Stanford opened the second half
right where it left off.
Kate Paye and Molly Goodenbour
each hit a three-point bucket, triggering
a 14-6 Cardinal run and forcing the Sun
Devils to play catch-up basketball for
the rest of the night. Coming off the
bench, Paye's 12 points and six assists
played a big part in helping Stanford to
maintain its lead.
"Kate had a great game," Van-
Derveer said. "She got open really well."
Although Arizona State hung tough
for the duration of the contest, a pivotal
event occurred when Sun Devil coach
Maura McHugh was whistled for her
second technical foul halfway through
the final period. With her squad down
by just four points at that juncture and
in possession of the ball, the incident
turned the ball over to Stanford and
dealt a blow to ASU's chances for a
comeback. The Cardinal squad convert
ed the resulting two free throws and
then made a three-point basket at the
10-minute mark to extend its advantage
to nine.
"The second one (technical foul)
might have hurt them," VanDerveer
said. "That |was] a real critical point."
Nevertheless, the ferocious Arizona
State squad battled back once again to
within four points several minutes

later. Stanford refused to yield down
the stretch, however, making free
throw after free throw to clinch the vic
tory.
"There's no doubt that our free
throw shooting won the game for us
tonight," said VanDerveer, after her
team shot 92 percent from the charity
stripe during the second half.
The Cardinal will receive another
stiff challenge when it faces Arizona
tomorrow night in Tucson, but after
last night's win, it can breathe a little
easier atop the Pac-10.
"[Arizona State] is an NCAA-bound
team," VanDerveer said. "This is a
great win for our team."

Angela Taylor has a lot to celebrate as Stanford earned its 22nd victory of the season
last night, an 86-76 triumph over Arizona State in Tempe.
It may not have been pretty, but a
win is a win in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
The No. 9 Cardinal women's basket
ball team survived a lackluster first-half
performance on the road last night
against Arizona State, rallying past the
Sun Devils, 86-76.
Stanford (22-5, 12-3 Pac-10) found
itself trailing by as many as nine points
with less than seven minutes remaining
in the first half and seemed in danger of
slipping out of its coveted first-place
position in the conference standings.
The Cardinal committed an unsightly
15 turnovers in the opening period as
the tenacious defense of Arizona State
(16-8, 9-6) flustered Stanford players.
"Their defense was really intense,"
said Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We had trouble taking care of the
ball."
When Stanford held the ball long
enough to release a shot, the results
were mostly unfavorable, as its
mediocre 36 percent first-half field goal
percentage would attest.
Had it not been for inspired play
early on by Stanford center Val Whit
ing, the defending national champion
Cardinal might have been blown out on
the Arizona State Activity Center floor.
The Ail-American senior racked up 14
first-period points, converting five-of
six shot attempts from the field.
"Val's a go-to player," VanDerveer
said. "She's an All-American, and she
plays like an All-American. Night in and
night out you can count on her."
Whiting proved especially effective in
leading a Stanford comeback near the

end of the period. Her back-to-back bas
kets cut the deficit to five and gave her
Cardinal teammates a much-needed
boost of momentum during the last few
minutes.
A pair of Whiting free throws, fol
lowed by an Arizona State traveling vio
lation and a Chris MacMurdo three
point play, propelled the Cardinal to a
31-30 advantage at the break, its first
lead of the game.
Stanford opened the second half
right where it left off.
Kate Paye and Molly Goodenbour
each hit a three-point bucket, triggering
a 14-6 Cardinal run and forcing the Sun
Devils to play catch-up basketball for
the rest of the night. Coming off the
bench, Paye's 12 points and six assists
played a big part in helping Stanford to
maintain its lead.
"Kate had a great game," Van-
Derveer said. "She got open really well."
Although Arizona State hung tough
for the duration of the contest, a pivotal
event occurred when Sun Devil coach
Maura McHugh was whistled for her
second technical foul halfway through
the final period. With her squad down
by just four points at that juncture and
in possession of the ball, the incident
turned the ball over to Stanford and
dealt a blow to ASU's chances for a
comeback. The Cardinal squad convert
ed the resulting two free throws and
then made a three-point basket at the
10-minute mark to extend its advantage
to nine.
"The second one (technical foul)
might have hurt them," VanDerveer
said. "That |was] a real critical point."
Nevertheless, the ferocious Arizona
State squad battled back once again to
within four points several minutes

later. Stanford refused to yield down
the stretch, however, making free
throw after free throw to clinch the vic
tory.
"There's no doubt that our free
throw shooting won the game for us
tonight," said VanDerveer, after her
team shot 92 percent from the charity
stripe during the second half.
The Cardinal will receive another
stiff challenge when it faces Arizona
tomorrow night in Tucson, but after
last night's win, it can breathe a little
easier atop the Pac-10.
"[Arizona State] is an NCAA-bound
team," VanDerveer said. "This is a
great win for our team."
