There are times when the Stan
ford women's tennis team thorough
ly devastates its opponents, chal
lenging them on every point of every
game of every match until every win

Stadium scoreboard reads "S."
And then there are times when
they just win.
Yesterday, Stanford overcame a
case of post-Florida weariness to
defeat the visiting University of theP
acific Tigers, 7-1. The top-ranked
Cardinal (13-0,4-0 Pacific 10 Confer

Nonetheless, junior Laxmi
Poruri kicked off the winning day
for Stanford with a 6-4, 6-2 win
over Pacific's Tracee Lee in the No.
1 match. The victory marks
Poruri's return to her winning

last weekend.
"I was real happy to have played

as well as I did against her," Poruri
said. "Every match I'm going to go
out and play my game, and hope
fully that will be good enough to
beat whoever I'm playing."
Poruri's doubles partner, senior
captain Heather Willens, had simi
lar success in her No. 2 match
against the Tigers' Marsa Kuurne,
6-2, 6-1, while No. 3 Kristine
Kurth made short work of Kim
Chang, 6-4, 6-0.
Junior Emma Woodhouse made
an appearance in the Cardinal
starting singles lineup at No. 4,
where she rolled over Pacific's
