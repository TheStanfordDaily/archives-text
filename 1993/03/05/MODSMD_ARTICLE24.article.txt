# No. 1 netters win despite 'flat' play
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
There are times when the Stan
ford women's tennis team thorough
ly devastates its opponents, chal
lenging them on every point of every
game of every match until every win
ner's box on the Stanford Tennis
Stadium scoreboard reads "S."
And then there are times when
they just win.
Yesterday, Stanford overcame a
case of post-Florida weariness to
defeat the visiting University of theP
acific Tigers, 7-1. The top-ranked
Cardinal (13-0,4-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) held Pacific to two games or

under in nine out of 18 sets, but judg
ing from the reaction of coach Frank
Brennan, you'd never know it.
"This was, in my opinion, one of
our worst matches of the year,"
Brennan said. "We were obviously
a little flat after the Indoors, and
we were flat today."
Nonetheless, junior Laxmi
Poruri kicked off the winning day
for Stanford with a 6-4, 6-2 win
over Pacific's Tracee Lee in the No.
1 match. The victory marks
Poruri's return to her winning
ways after dropping a 6-4, 6-4 deci
sion to Florida's Lisa Raymond
last weekend.
"I was real happy to have played

as well as I did against her," Poruri
said. "Every match I'm going to go
out and play my game, and hope
fully that will be good enough to
beat whoever I'm playing."
Poruri's doubles partner, senior
captain Heather Willens, had simi
lar success in her No. 2 match
against the Tigers' Marsa Kuurne,
6-2, 6-1, while No. 3 Kristine
Kurth made short work of Kim
Chang, 6-4, 6-0.
Junior Emma Woodhouse made
an appearance in the Cardinal
starting singles lineup at No. 4,
where she rolled over Pacific's
Kanani Galolo, 6-2, 6-2. Freshman
Wendy Sacks moved into the No. 5
position, downing Julie Radder, 6-
4, 6-4.
Freshman Sonya Cotero, how
ever, was not as lucky as her team
mates, losing to the Tigers' Molly
White in the No. 6 match by a 7-5,
6-4 score.
In doubles action, the No. 1
team of Willens and Poruri pol
ished off Pacific's Lee and Kuurne,

6-3,6-2, while Kurth and freshman
Beth Berris overwhelmed Galolo
and Radder in the No. 2 doubles
match, 6-1, 6-2.
Woodhouse and Sacks played in
the No. 3 doubles spot for Stan
ford, holding Chang and White to a
4-6, 7-5 tie before taking the match
by third-set default.
Brennan noted the inconsisten
cy of his team's play, but insisted
that the Cardinal will be ready to
play against California in the Big
Match Saturday.
Stanford is set to meet the No. 5
Golden Bears at 1 p.m. tomorrow
at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
