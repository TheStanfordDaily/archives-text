# Thompson toils for team after Olympic experience
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After breaking a district record in her first meet
ever as an eight-year-old, Jenny Thompson must
have known that she was something special. Ten
years later, she proved it by setting a world record in
the 100-meter freestyle and winning two Olympic
gold medals along with a silver. Still, many believe
this powerful swimmer from Dover, N.H. has much
more to accomplish.
Though the sophomore returned to Stanford this
year with Barcelona gold in the 400 free relay and the
400 individual medley relay, Thompson is already
focusing her training on the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta. Her goal is to capture first place in the 100
free and avenge her Olympic defeat at the hands of
China's Yong Zhuang.
"1992 was my first Olympics, but not my last,"
Thompson said. "I compare it to my first Olympic Tri
als in 1988, where I choked up, as a nervous 15-year
old. But I came back in the 1992 Olympic Trials with
much more confidence and set the world record in the
100 free. So I look at last year as a learning experience,
and I'll know what to improve on for Atlanta"
According to Cardinal assistant coach Ross Gerry,
Thompson gets a competitive edge not only from her
immense talent, but also from her unique mentality.
He explained that sometimes people forget about the
mental component of their swimming because every
thing appears masked by their natural ability.
"She has a real desire to win and exceed everyone's
expectations, including her own," Gerry said. "That's
probably her greatest talent." It's that bulldog atti
tude which carries her through races that no one but
she could win, he said.
Earlier this week at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Thompson displayed that intensity
during the 200-yard free relay. Stanford was behind
UCLA by one-and-a-half body lengths going into the
last leg when Thompson dove in.
"It's a very short race, because each swimmer only
swims 50 yards, and I don't think there was anyone in
the world who thought she could win, except for
Jenny herself," Gerry said. "She got an amazing split
of 22 seconds flat and won by a finger nail.
"This is all considering UCLA was shaved and
tapered while Jenny wasn't at all. It is just one illus
tration of what she can do when she puts her mind to
it."
Thompson also recognizes that competitiveness in
herself, and she admits that relays are her "most
favorite aspect of swimming."
"I love being able to anchor a relqy so I can crush
the other team at the end," Thompson said. *1 like to
think of my competitors as the enemy, and I really
want to get their throat."
That killer instinct extends to her individual

events as well.
"I was kind of mad that I lost the 50 free (at Pac
-10s) to some freshman (Richelle DePold) from UCLA.
But I'll get her at the NCAAs. She's going down,"
Thompson said half-jokingly.
Although winning individual events at the NCAA
Championships was one of her goals this year, her
main focus is the team's performance. And Thomp
son, according to teammate Lori Heisick, is one of the
best team players in an individual sport like swim
ming.
"I remember last year at the Olympic Trials when
I missed going to the finals by 0.05 seconds, and I was
just devastated," Heisick said. "Meanwhile, Jenny
was having the meet of her life after breaking the
world record and winning all of her events. When she
saw how crushed I was, she went out of her way and
brought me a card with a button that said 'smile.' "
The stoiy is indicative of the importance Thomp
son places on the team. When asked about the best
swimming experience of her life, Thompson did not
say the Olympics, or any individual title. Instead, she
cited last year's NCAA team title as the highlight of
her career.
"The meet started off really badly because I false
started the first relay, which meant we basically lost
all the points in that event," Thompson said. "I was
completely disappointed and bawling after the false
start, but my teammates were there to support me.
After that, everyone just pulled together and swam
the best races of our lives."
Thompson and the Cardinal squad will look to
repeat that performance in two weeks at the NCAA
Championships in Minneapolis. Thompson is already
preparing for the championships by carrying out her
traditional pre-meet customs.
Before every big competition, including last year's
Olympics, Thompson stops shaving her armpits for a
couple of months preceding the meet. Then, right
before the her races, she will shave them to help her go
faster.
"All the girls think that that's really gross,"
Thompson said while laughing. "But for me it's tradi
tion. We're always supposed to shave our bodies
before big meets, so I always leave my armpits
unshaved so I can do them right before the meet and
swim real fast."
She hopes that will help her improve all of her
times at the NCAAs, including her American record
in the 100-yard free. While some swimmers might
eschew such lofty goals in a post-Olympic year, high
expectations are nothing new for Thompson.
"Most people have a letdown in the year after the
Olympics, because they take training at a slower and
easier pace," Gerry said. "Not Jenny. If anything, she's
spurred on by her achievements last year and I expect
her to swim even faster at the NCAAs. I don't think the
rest of the country is ready for that... too bad."
