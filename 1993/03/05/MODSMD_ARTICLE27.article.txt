# Women's gymnastics to face Arizona State
## Home meet will be final test before Pac-10s 
### Sean May Staff writer 
It's nice to be home again.
That's the attitude of the Stanford
women's gymnastics team as it prepares
to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils
tonight at 7:30 in Burnham Pavilion.
The Cardinal (5-5) has had a couple of
tough road trips the last two weekends,
going only 1-3 in that span. Although the
team earned its two highest scores of the
year in Seattle two weeks ago, it is eager
to return to the friendly confines of Burn
ham.
"The team really likes being in Burn
ham. There's more of a home-court
advantage than Maples," coach Breck
Greenwood said.
Sophomore Jenny Ward concurred.
"You're almost at one with the crowd
when you vault," she said, referring not
only to the psychic energy emitted by the
crowd, but also to the fans' proximity, as
they are only 8 to 10 feet from the vault
ing horse.
According to junior co-captain Mollie
Brown, staying home also allows the gym
nasts to concentrate fully on the competi
tion.
"We can focus in on what we have to do
instead of our schedules," she said.
This is the Cardinal's last tuneup
before it hosts the Pacific 10 Conference

Championships next week, and the squad
has spent a lot of practice time shoring up
its weaker events, especially the vault.
Greenwood attributes much of the
Cardinal's vaulting problems to practic
ing in the Ford Center, which has extra
squishy landing areas. The team then has
difficulty adjusting to the harder mats
used during meets.
To change his squad's vaulting for
tunes, Greenwood has had the team prac
tice in the Burnham gym with meet-style,
harder padding, and the work may have
paid off.
"We had our best vaulting day of the
year," he said of a practice earlier this
week. "That's an encouraging sign."
Stanford will be further benefited by
having sophomore Jen 6 Elzie back in the
beam lineup. The 1992 All-American has
been competing only on bars due to a
strained Achilles tendon.
The Cardinal will need to hit all of its
routines if it plans to defeat the Sun Dev
ils. According to Greenwood, ASU coach
Jim Spini felt at the beginning of the year
that his squad,could win the national
championship, and the Devils have the
power to do it.
Although they have a young team, the
Sun Devils have four previous national
team members, including sophomores
Tina Brinkman and Danna Lister.
Brinkman is the defending Pac-10
champion on bars and floor, and
she and Lister have scored 10.00s
twice each this year.
The Sun Devils have been as
consistent as they have been
exceptional this season — scoring
above 190.00 as a team in eveiy
meet this year. Stanford has bro
ken that magical mark only twice.
"They're a tough team to

beat," said Stanford assistant
coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi, adding
that ASU has scored as high as
194.00 this season.
The Cardinal, whose best mark
is 190.85, is qnxious to prove to
itself that it can compete in such
impressive company.
"We're ready to rock 'n' roll,"
said sophomore co-captain Katie
Clancy.
Mitzel-Izzi expects the team to
give its best performance of the
season tonight.
"I predict we'll break 191.00
this weekend — the girls are hun
gry for it," she said.
