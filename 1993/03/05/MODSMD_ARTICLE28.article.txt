# Batters look to Six-Pac Trojans
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
A young Cardinal squad continues its
crash course in Pacific 10 Conference
Southern-Division baseball this week
end, facing No. 11 USC at Dedeaux Field
in Los Angeles.
"The Southern Cal series is a huge
one for us," said Stanford catcher A.J.
Hinch. "We need to bounce back in the
Six-Pac."
After winning 10 of 13 nonconference
contests, the No. 13 Cardinal (11-6,0-3 Six-
Pac) was introduced to Six-Pac life in rude
fashion last weekend. Arizona pounded a
seemingly untouchable Stanford pitching
staff for 43 runs in three games, sweeping
the Cardinal in Tucson, Ariz.
"We experienced some difficulties
down in Arizona on the mound," Cardi
nal coach Mark Marquess said. "But this
is a new series — Southern Cal is a dif
ferent kind of team."
While the Trojans (7-8, 2-1) lack the
offensive punch of the Wildcats, they are
by no means a bad squad. Picked as high
as third in some preseason polls, USC
has struggled a bit in the early going
because of some costly injuries to its
vaunted pitching staff.
Junior righthanders Mike Collett and
Kent Donnelly, both expected to be
among the Six-Pac's top starting pitch
ers, have struggled to recover from off
season shoulder surgeries. Donnelly has
made only one appearance this year, and
Collett has tallied an ungainly 6.14 ERA
in five appearances.
"We have some big expectations for
both Collett and Donnelly," said USC
coach Mike Gillespie. "Things haven't
happened for us in that respect, but they

will."
Senior Dan Hubbs, who defeated
Stanford twice last year as a starter, was
shifted to the bullpen before this season.
Already, the righthanded flamethrower
has established himself as one of the
most effective relievers in the conference,
picking up a league-leading five saves and
26 strikeouts in only 18 innings of work.
"Hubbs has improved in each of the
four years he's been here," said Gillespie
of the righthander, who was a walk-on as
a freshman. "No one's touched him at all
this year."
The Trojans will be facing a Cardinal
attack which has increased in intensity
over the past two weeks. Hinch and Todd
Laßocca have been leading the Stanford
charge.
Hinch has lived up to his illustrious
preseason billing. Last year's Gatorade
National High School Player of the Year,

he is hitting .333 and leads the club with
17 runs batted in.
Laßocca, who moved to the No. 9 slot
in the lineup against the Wildcats, went
8-for-l 1 last weekend. His five-hit perfor
mance in the opening game of the series
was Stanford's first in three years.
On the other side of the diamond, an
embattled Cardinal pitching staff should
have an easier time against USC. The
Trojans lack the batting prowess of the
Wildcats, with only two starters hitting
over .300 for the season.
However, those two, Casey Burrill and
Gabe Alvarez, have lit the Six-Pac on fire
thus far. Burrill, who backed up Trojan
star Bobby Hughes behind the plate last
season, leads the division with eight
home runs and a .508 average.
Alvarez, a freshman who is considered
to be one of the top prospects in the
nation, is hitting .368.
