# Each Row house to get a computer manager
## 
### Ajai Chari Staff writer 
Not only will each Row house get its
own computer cluster next year, but
residents will also have someone to
roust at 3 a.m. when their disk crashes.
To keep pace with expanding resi
dential computer facilities, two more
Residential Computer Consultants
will be hired for the Row and each
house will get a computer manager.
Currently, one RCC oversees the
seven Row houses that have comput
ers, according to Jeff Merriman, direc
tor of residential computing. But next
fall, when each house will receive two
computers and a printer, the need for
support will be greater.

Residential Computing plans to hire
three RCCs next fall, each of whom will
oversee one-third of the Row. Merri
man said these positions will be more
akin to the RCCs at graduate resi
dences, who act as technical experts,
rather than RCCs at freshman dorms,
who often teach classes.
In addition to the RCCs, every
house will select a student to be a com
puter manager, who will make sure
that the cluster is stocked and call the
RCCs if any problems arise.
Merriman said the strategy is "an
experiment and may have to be
rethought." But he believes that com
puter managers will be effective be
cause "each house is independent and
different" and it would be difficult for

one RCC to give each house special at
tention.
Janyce Prothro, director of student
management at the Row houses, said
the selection procedure for the com
puter managers would be similar to
that for other house officers, who are
elected by the current house residents.
She said computer managers will be se
lected by March 12, and students cho
sen will be exempt from the Draw.
Merriman said the three RCCs for
the Row houses will be selected during
the general RCC selection process,
which has already begun, but those
still interested can attend a makeup
meeting next Tuesday.
The selected individuals can choose
the house they want to live in, he said.

The remaining 32 houses will have
computer managers.
Next week, the locations of the com
puters in each house will be finalized.
Merriman said while about a third
of the houses that will receive comput
ers have studies or libraries where the
computers can be easily installed,
other houses may require a partition
ing of existing rooms, creation of door
ways and installation of independent
circuits, lighting and more outlets for
power plugs. He said no student rooms
would be converted to clusters.
About $300,000 has been allocated
by Housing and Food Services to ex
pand undergraduate computing facili
ties, according to Merriman, and be-
cause the "Row is the largest
unserved area," it is the group's
primary thrust.
About $150,000 will be used to
buy the equipment, $50,000 will
be used to perform facilities
upgrades and up to $40,000 may
be used to buy new furniture.
This spring, the University
will purchase enough Macintosh
LCIIIs, monitors and Hewlett-
Packard Deskwriter printers for
each of the 35 Row houses. Instal
lation should begin this summer.
