# Men's netters double up in Pacific Coast tourney
## Gould to shuffle pairs lineup in La Jolla 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Almost halfway through the men's
tennis season, coach Dick Gould is still
searching for the right player combina
tions to fill the team's three doubles
spots. Although team talent runs deep
this year, a strong doubles lineup has
eluded Gould. Hopefully, this weekend's
Pacific Coast Doubles tournament in La
Jolla, Calif, will provide some answers.
The No. 1 doubles spot seems fairly set
in the hands of juniors Chris Cocotos and
Michael Flanagan. The pair sports a solid
6-1 season record in the top spot.
Although both players rfat out Tues
day's dual match against the University
of the Pacific, Cocotos' stiff neck and
Flanagan's flu bug have subsided and
the pair will lead the Cardinal this
weekend.
The second and third doubles slots are
much more questionable. Junior Vimal
Patel paired up with freshman Jim
Thomas earlier in the season while junior

Robert Devens, undefeated in nine singles
matches, played with freshman Jeff
Salzenstein. With Thomas sidelined until
spring quarter because of a pulled stom
ach muscle and neither pair playing
exceptionally well, Gould shook up the
lineup last week.
Against Pacific, Patel and Devens
teamed up and impressed Gould. "Vimal
played intelligently and they both did a
good job with their shot selection," he
said. "We've been working really hard in
practice on shot selection."
The main drawback of this pair is that
neither player has a big serve or a big
return. "They both have good hands,"
Gould said, "but every time they serve
they're going to have a dogfight."
Tuesday's match also featured Salzen
stein paired up with classmate Ricky
Becker. The tandem crushed its Tiger
opponents, 6-2, 6-2. Salzenstein, recover
ing from a stomach-muscle injury, is
beginning to practice his serve again. This
