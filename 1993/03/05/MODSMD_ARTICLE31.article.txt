# Cardinal gymnasts go to UCSB Invite

### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Staying healthy. These are the
two key words for the No. 3 Stan
ford men's gymnastics team
tonight as it battles fellow mem
bers of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation in the UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational.
The Cardinal will try its hardest
to avoid injuries as it faces confer
ence rival Brigham Young, who
narrowly defeated Stanford last
weekend, 281.70-281.25. Califor
nia, Air Force and Arizona are also
among the teams who will chal
lenge the defending national cham
pions in tonight's competition.
"Last weekend I think we just
cracked under pressure," junior
Jason Cohen said. "Now that
we're healthy, we should come
through this weekend, that's just
all there is to it."
"We are mainly looking for
consistency in this meet," coach
Sadao Hamada said. "We've been
spending a lot of time trying to
minimize our errors and improv
ing our techniques — hopefully
this extra practice will show in
our routines."
While the Cardinal's team
scores in its past three meets
have fallen 3 to 5 points short of
the level Hamada had hoped, he
expects they are high enough to
qualify Stanford for the Western
Regionals in April.
"After last weekend, the hard

est time for us is over," Hamada
said. "We're pretty much on
cruise control now, we just have
to stay healthy — that's the key
to the NCAA title for us."
Last weekend's double-meet
schedule took its toll on the team,
however, when sophomore Jing-
Wei Liang sprained his right
ankle on the vault. While Hama
da anticipates a quick recovery,
Liang's contribution to the team
score will be missed tonight.
With the exception of Liang's
absence, tonight's lineup will be
much like last weekend's. Co-cap
tains senior Jair Lynch and
junior Mark Booth will lead Stan
ford in the all-around competi
tion, supported by senior Jeff
Bender and sophomore Josh
Stein.
Cohen, senior Shawn Adamek
and freshman Peter Hegi are also
expected to make valuable contri
butions to the Cardinal effort.
While the team will compete in
one more dual meet in two weeks,
Hamada considers tonight's con
test to be essentially the last of
the regular season. After this
weekend, the team will end all
experimentation, and will exclu
sively throw the routines they
plan on using in the NCAA
Finals.
"Now it starts to turn into a
mindgame," Cohen said. "We've
been doing enough of our new
tricks, now we just have to hit
them when we want to."
