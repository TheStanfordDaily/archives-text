# Spikers clash No. 7 Gauchos
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Two men's volleyball teams with losing streaks
meet tomorrow night at 7 p.m. One streak will be
eliminated and the other extended when the No. 7
UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos gallop into Bumham
Pavilion to duel the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal.
The two streaks on the line differ in severity.
Stanford (7-3, 6-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) is 3-2 in its last five matches and has
won three of its last four. But the Cardinal has fall
en to the last two top-10 teams it has faced, losing to
No. 3 Cal State-Northridge and No. 6 Brigham
Young.
UC-Santa Barbara (5-4, 9-8 in the MPSF) is
entrenched in a more serious losing streak. In their
last four matches, the Gauchos visited Northridge,
No. 1 Pepperdine and No. 5 Hawaii, twice, and lost
all four. UCSB coach Ken Preston attributes some
of these defeats to playing away from home.
"We just have not played very well on the road,"
he said.
The Gauchos have the personnel to turn their
streak around in dramatic fashion against the Car
dinal. They are led by one of the best outside hitters
in the country, sophomore Amaury Velasco. Velas
co, at 6-foot-4, ranks fifth in the nation with a 6.47
kills-per-game average.
UCSB has an effective offensive-defensive duo at
middle blocker. Supplying the offense is Carter
Reese, a 6-foot-5 redshirt freshman who is leading
his team with a .423 hitting percentage. Defen
sively, Jason Mount, one of the tallest players in the
country at 6-foot-10, is a blockingjuggernaut, rank
ing sixth in the MPSF and 11th in the nation with
a 1.57 block-per-game average.
At swing hitter, Hector Lopez is another talent
ed Gaucho. Lopez played for the Spanish Olympic
team that finished seventh in Barcelona.
"He's a great passer and an outstanding blocker,"
said Cardinal coach Ruben Nieves.
Even with these talented players at his disposal,
Preston has been looking to make social personnel

changes and would not comment on a starting line
up for tomorrow night.
On the other side of the net, the Cardinal gets
much of its offensive production from senior outside
hitter Dave Goss. Goss is second in the country with
a 7.36 kill-per-game average and consistently pro
duces a large part of Stanford's offense.
Swing hitter Bob Hillman is second on the
team with 3.75 kills per game and ranks 13th in
the country with 2.38 digs per game. He is also
fifth in the MPSF with .500 aces per game, while
counterpart Ryan Moos is ninth with .435 aces
per game.
Stanford has been rotating four players in the
two middle blocker positions. Seniors John Bez
malinovic and John Hribar provide the blocking
defense with 1.50 and 1.33 blocks-per-game aver
ages, respectively. Junior Joe Burghardt and
sophomore Brian Garrett have hitting percent
ages of over .500, which would place them among
the top three nationally if either had enough
attempts.
Stanford's match with UCSB tomorrow night
will help determine the Mountain Division cham
pion. The Mountain Division of the MPSF has
become a two-team battle between Stanford, the
current leader, and Hawaii, only half-a-game
behind. The Rainbows have already beaten UCSB,
but lost to San Diego State earlier in the season.
"Basically, if we lose to Santa Barbara, it puts
us even," Nieves said. "It would wash away our
win over San Diego."
Over spring break, the Rainbows come to
Maples Pavilion to play two games against the
Cardinal in a series "that may determine the win
ner of our division," according to Nieves.
The winner of the Mountain, Division plays the
winner of the Pacific Division, with the victor
receiving an automatic bid to the NCAA Men's
Volleyball Final Four. The loser then drops back
into the MPSF tournament, which consists of the
top eight MPSF teams. Although not a guarantee,
the winner of the tournament would likely receive
a Final Four bid as well.
