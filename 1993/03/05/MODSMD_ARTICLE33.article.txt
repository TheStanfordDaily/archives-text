# Fencers gun for Western Regional title

### Oscar Dominguez Staff Writer 
What is the biggest problem champions have
before big competitions? Overconfidence. Just
ask the Stanford men's and women's fencing
teams.
After dominating West Coast competition
this year, the Cardinal travels to UC-Santa
Cruz this weekend for the 1993 Western
Regional Championships.
"We're a very strong, very even team," said
women's coach Sherry Posthumus. "The biggest
thing is that the team doesn't get overconfident.
They're looking beyond (regionals to the NCAA
tournament). That's my only worry."
The men are the defending Western Region
al champions and the women hope to regain the
title they lost last season to Air Force.
"We lost the title for the first time in 11 years
last year," Posthumus said. "We want to take it
back again and keep it for another 10 years."
The regional tournament marks the end of
the 1992-93 regular season for the Cardinal
and will determine who goes on to postseason

competition. Only four teams from the region
will qualify for the NCAA tournament (men's
foil, epee, sabre and women's foil) and only two
women and eight men can qualify for individu
al competition.
"We are looking forward to winning both
men's and women's foil at Western Regionals,"
said Cardinal men's coach Zoran Tulum. "We
are very close to winning in all four weapons."
Since their final road trip to Cal Tech a
month ago, Tulum and the men have concen
trated on improving the sabre and epee squads.
"Sabre team is my biggest worry because
our biggest competitors, Cal Tech, didn't beat

us, we beat ourselves," Tulum said. "At this
point, everything is psychological."
The ep£e team, meanwhile, will be tested by
an unpredictable Air Force squad.
"Air Force always has good athletes, men
and women who are going to defend this coun
try in the future," T\ilum said. "Their ep6e is
always strong, but this year they aren't as
strong as in the past. Against common oppo
nents we did the same or better."
Neither the Cardinal men's nor women's
teams have faced the Falcons this season.
"I don't know what they look like," Posthu
mus said. "They could be an outside surprise."
Starting for the women are senior Lana
Kang — who will be making her fourth and
final trip to Regionals — sophomore Anna
Cummins and freshmen Morgan Hoch, Steph
Wien and Chloe Sladden — all making their
regional debut.
Geoff Donaker and two-time NCAA champi
on and Olympian Nick Bravin lead the men in
the foil. Jeremy Nelson heads the epee team,
while Glenn Wong and Kofi Bruce anchor the
sabre squad.
