# Diversions
## America through a Fox-tinted lense 
### 
For every "The Simpsons,"
there're ten "New Adventures of
Beans Baxter."
I learned this not too long ago,
when a CIV-class-dazed friend
and I attempted, in the middle of
lecture, to name every single
show ever to appear (and, as a
corollary, be cancelled) on the Fox
TV network.
We realized that this was a
monumental task— worthy of
gargantuan indirect-cost subsi
dies — but, as they say, CIV lec
ture is the mother of all inven
tion.
As a matter of course, "The
Simpsons" and "Married .. . with
Children" were the first two
shows named. Our thoughts hear
kened back to May, 1987, when
the latter program premiered
along with "The Tracey Ullman
Show." One featured a vulgar Illi
nois family. One witnessed the
American debut of an intelligent,
witty and talented British star.
One was immediately cancelled.
One was not.
After the initial flurry of shows
like "21 Jump Street," "Cops,"
"Babes" (much better than the
novel), "Parker Lewis Can't
Lose" and "Werewolf," sweat
began to bead on our foreheads.
"Dammit," we thought.
"There's got to be more. Bad taste
has an audience in the US of A."
So we drove onward, much like

the plucky crew in the recent TV
movie "Journey to the Center of
the Earth" who drilled miles and
miles into the earth's core until,
at last, they found a bad Fox TV
show.
And there were more. Many,
many more.
We had added "Mr. President"
(featuring George C. Scott, pray
ing to be assassinated), "The
Dirty Dozen," "Get a Life,"
"Drexell's Class" and "Down by
the Shore" before the collective
stench of these shows gave us
pause.
I recalled "Women in Prison"
by chanting, "While other girls
are breaking dates / You're mak
ing license plates."
By this time, most of the seats
immediately around us were vacant,
and those stragglers still remaining
were nervously edging away.
Social opprobrium or no, the
die was cast. We had to plunge
into the abyss. Bad TV may not be
a glamorous science, with profes
sor groupies, tenure tracks and
eminently abusable grad students,
but it's a science nonetheless.
There were a few good pro
grams, like "It's Garry Shan
dling's Show," "The Ben Stiller
Show" and "Beyond Tomorrow,"
each of which seemed to be an
apology by Fox for inflicting the
preceding show on viewers.
But still we sank further and

further in the Marianas Trench of
good taste: "Melrose Place" and
that damn "90210" show.
There was "Karen's Song,"
"Totally Hidden Video" and Sam
Kinison's last effort, "Charlie
Hoover."
Next came "Likely Suspects,"
"Top of the Heap" and"Alien
Nation."
Then there was "Woops!" and
"True Colors," which, I have it on
good authority, is the only televi
sion show in history to be named
after a Cyndi Lauper song.
And when the 14 viewers of
any particular show refused to
endure any more anguish, Fox
had a ready answer: change the
title, keep the characters, and
voila— Instaprogramming!
Thus, "Duet" begat "Open
House" (and not one viewer
noticed the difference); "Second
Chance" begat "Boys Will Be
Boys"; and "21 Jump Street"
begat "Booker" (featuring 1989's
teen scream, Richard Grieco,

since given the Honorary Ralph
Macchio "Where Are They Now?"
trophy).
All in all: a fairly sad testament
to a lot of wasted days and wasted
nights.
What's worse is that Fox had
such high hopes for each and
every one of these shows.
For example, everyone not cur
rently within an iron lung knew
that "Vinnie and Bobby" was
DOA as soon as it hit the air
waves. Yet the Fox executives
kept on saying that "Vinnie and
Bobby" was going to be a smash,
that it would beat "60 Minutes"
in the ratings, that it would cure
chronic halitosis, etc.
As a matter of course, "Vinnie
and Bobby" was watched by the
same number of people that con
verted to the metric system in the
'70s, but the'executives' loyalty
was truly touching.
The Fox network is a metaphor
for America.
It has proved that hard work
and talent are oftentimes less
important than cleavage humor
and bed-wetting jokes — just like
Paul Tsongas' attributes were
overshadowed by Hillary's seduc
tive glances.
Thus, our task was complet
ed. A little heroic. A little sad.
And definitely a more useful
thing to ponder upon than CIV
lecture.
