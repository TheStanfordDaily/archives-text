# Sexual harassment policy to be revised for a second time
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
After a two-hour discussion with the
University Cabinet yesterday, the work
group for the University's Policy on Sexual
Harassment will once again revise the docu
ment. But group members say a final draft is
in sight.
After an "interesting and long discussion
that really cut down to the nitty-gritty," the
cabinet decided to send the policy back for
another revision because "a lot of questions
and concerns were not addressed" in the
proposed draft, said work-group member
Sharon Parker.
At the meeting, University President
Gerhard Casper emphasized that the policy
should be a basis for disciplinary action as

opposed to mere guidelines, Parker said, ex
plaining that "strong language and word
ing" are very important for that reason.
For example, Parker said the cabinet felt
the policy's section on consensual relations
needed to be expanded and worded more
strongly.
The cabinet also decided that once the
work group re-drafts the policy — in about
two weeks — it will be submitted directly to
Casper, instead of presented at another cab
inet meeting, said Parker, the director of the
Office of Multicultural Development.
If Casper approves the draft, it will be
published in Campus Report for community
input. Final approval of the policy will fol
low this feedback process, but Casper reiter-
ated that the policy's absolute
deadline is still the end of the aca
demic year.
The document — originally
titled the Policy on Unacceptable
Sexual Conduct — is supposed to
update the University's existing
sexual harassment policy and

incorporate the sexual assault
policy that was written last year
into a single, overarching policy.
Parker said the two years that
the group has spent working on
the policy has "way- exceeded"
expectations. She said the delay
can be attributed to the "extreme
ly complex" nature of the issue of
sexual harassment as well as the
University's interest in making
the policy "enforceable."
Despite the delays and numer

ous drafts, Parker said the work
group has faith in Casper's dead
line and the fact that "there is an
end to this."
"We would be frustrated if
there wasn't a deadline," she said.
"I think there is a strong con
clusion that the University is
going to have a policy by the end
of the school year," said cabinet
member Paul Brest, dean of the
Law School. "I have every reason
to think that's going to happen."
