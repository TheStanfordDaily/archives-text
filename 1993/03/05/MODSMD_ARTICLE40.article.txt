# No 'three-year degree' plans
## Casper says his remarks were meant to spark debate 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that he has "no secret
plan" to implement a three-year
degree at Stanford.
Seeking to defuse speculation
about his position on the issue, he
said his comments about the pos
sibility of a three-year degree
were meant to spark discussion
about the quality of undergradu
ate education as a whole, not nec
essarily its length.
Universities, Casper said, will
face a mtyor crisis unless they re
examine their ways, and consider
ing a three-year degree is a way to
encourage discussion of the issues

facing higher education.
"I'm delighted that I've got a
lively debate started," he said.
"All I would like to say is I have
no secret plan; I have no secret
task force trying to bring about
the three-year college at Stanford.
I have no secret thoughts, even.
Maybe I have no thoughts at all,
which is the likeliest possibility."
He added, however, that he
plans to speak directly about his
ideas on the three-year degree
during his "State of the Universi
ty" address to the Academic
Council April 29.
"Until then," he said, "I hope
these issues will be discussed at
many lunches, at Tresidder
Union, in the boardroom of The
Stanford Daily and at many din-

ner parties."
Casper has attracted national
attention with his suggestion,
first made in January, that col
leges should reconsider the four
year degree.
He told a conference of busi
ness leaders in San Francisco Feb.
11 that with total costs approach
ing $100,000 at top private uni
versities, he wonders whether a
broad liberal arts education that
provides little practical training is
still cost-effective.
He proposed that as "a first
step," Stanford could offer its
undergraduates a "very clearly
designed" three-year alternative
relying on Advanced Placement
credits and reduced distribution
requirements.
