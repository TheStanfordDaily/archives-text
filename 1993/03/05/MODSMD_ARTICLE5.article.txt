# Webb Ranch pay increased, but less than union hoped

### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Webb Ranch has offered to in
crease its workers' salaries after a
series of negotiations with the
United Stanford Workers, a union
leader said yesterday.
But the wages, currently at $5
to $6.50 per hour, will not be in
creased to the $8 per hour that the
union had hoped for, according to
field representative Reuben
Serna.
He would not specify the exact
amount of the increase, saying the
ranch's offer is still under negotia
tion and the workers must still
vote on the new salaries. But

Serna said he expects the new
salaries to be finalized within a
week.
Completion of eight new trail
ers for families who live on the
ranch, however, may be delayed
more than three weeks beyond the
University's March 31 deadline.
The ranch cannot get permis
sion to install sewage lines until
the next meeting of the county
commission that supervises the
West Bay Sanitary District, ac
cording to Tom Hubbard, a mem
ber of the Webb family who helps
run the ranch. The meeting is
scheduled for April 21.
Both Hubbard and Serna said
construction is otherwise proceed

ing on schedule, and everything
but the sewage lines should be fin
ished by March 31.
Last month, the University or
dered the ranch to complete the
trailers by that date, after San
Mateo County health officials de
clared four families' homes "unfit
for human occupancy."
Three of the families are now
living with relatives, while a
fourth is living in an apartment in
Redwood City. The Webbs are
paying the full cost of the reloca
tion, Serna said.
Eight families live year-round
on the 237-acre ranch, which is lo
cated on Stanford land just off of
