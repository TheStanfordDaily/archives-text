# Webb Ranch pay increased, but less than union hoped
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Webb Ranch has offered to in
crease its workers' salaries after a
series of negotiations with the
United Stanford Workers, a union
leader said yesterday.
But the wages, currently at $5
to $6.50 per hour, will not be in
creased to the $8 per hour that the
union had hoped for, according to
field representative Reuben
Serna.
He would not specify the exact
amount of the increase, saying the
ranch's offer is still under negotia
tion and the workers must still
vote on the new salaries. But

Serna said he expects the new
salaries to be finalized within a
week.
Completion of eight new trail
ers for families who live on the
ranch, however, may be delayed
more than three weeks beyond the
University's March 31 deadline.
The ranch cannot get permis
sion to install sewage lines until
the next meeting of the county
commission that supervises the
West Bay Sanitary District, ac
cording to Tom Hubbard, a mem
ber of the Webb family who helps
run the ranch. The meeting is
scheduled for April 21.
Both Hubbard and Serna said
construction is otherwise proceed

ing on schedule, and everything
but the sewage lines should be fin
ished by March 31.
Last month, the University or
dered the ranch to complete the
trailers by that date, after San
Mateo County health officials de
clared four families' homes "unfit
for human occupancy."
Three of the families are now
living with relatives, while a
fourth is living in an apartment in
Redwood City. The Webbs are
paying the full cost of the reloca
tion, Serna said.
Eight families live year-round
on the 237-acre ranch, which is lo
cated on Stanford land just off of
Alpine Road near Interstate 280
and has been leased to the Webb
family since 1022. The number of
workers at the ranch varies with
the seasons, from 15 to 50.
Sema said that while he is dis
appointed the workers' salaries
will not be increased to $8 per
hour, which is the minimum wage
for union members who work for
Stanford, "at least we're not mak
ing any steps backward."
"They're going to live a whole
lot better than they lived three
years ago," he said. "But it does
not mean that we're satisfied with
what the wages are. We'd still like
them to get more."

At yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting, English Prof. Ron Reb
holz urged University President
Gerhard Casper to pressure the
Webbs to raise the salaries to the
University minimum wage. "This
is not a problem of law, but a
problem of decency, a problem of
moral obligation," he said.
Casper responded that the
University has "no legal leverage"
over compensation practices at
the ranch. The only leverage the
University has, he said, is a clause
on living conditions in the lease
agreement with the Webbs. "That
is the leverage we have, and that
is the leverage we have used," he
said.
It was not clear yesterday
whether the delay in completing
the trailers was acceptable to the
University. The official in charge

of insuring that the Webbs meet
the deadline — Leonie Batkin,
asset manager of the Stanford
Management Company —
declined to comment.
The families' new trailers are
actually old Manzanita Park trail
ers, obtained by the Webbs nearly
two years ago when the Universi
ty offered them free to anyone
willing to pay tjhe costs to remove
them.
Serna said they represent the
first "decent housing" the fami
lies have had. "Some of the work
ers have been there for 10 or 15
years and they've been living in
shacks," he said.
The salary increase negotiated
by the union is an adjustment of
the current contract with the
Webbs, a four-year pact sealed in
April 1990, Serna said.
