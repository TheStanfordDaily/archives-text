# 'A fact sheet?’
## Faculty Senate expresses concern over Casper's control of Campus Report 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Faculty members concerned that the administra
tion is increasing its control of Campus Report ques
tioned University President Gerhard Casper about
the newspaper's purpose and direction at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare said he was worried
about changes the University's News Service weekly
has undergone since Casper's reorganization of the
administration. Campus Report is no longer serving
the Stanford community, he said, adding that the
publication is becoming a "fact sheet, plus a way to
cast news in the most favorable light possible."
Concern with Campus Report's direction and
function goes back to 1989 and the resignation of
then-director of News Service Bob Byers, scud Zare.
Byers resigned amid controversy, claiming the
University was "muzzling honest journalism in
favor of corporate-style public relations."
At the time, there was concern that then-Vice
President of Public Affairs Bob Freelen was trying to
control University news, which went against Byers'
candid journalistic style.
Zare expressed concerns that News Service is
heading in this same direction under Casper since
"Campus Report seems to report directly to you."
Casper told the senate that he has "no ambition to
become editor in chief of Campus Report." But he ac
knowledged that the restructuring of the adminis
tration brings Campus Report "one step closer to the
president" as a way to ensure that the publication
goes in the direction he sees appropriate.
Casper believes this direction should coincide
with News Service's mission — to use Campus Re
port to enlighten the University while providing "a
long-term understanding of trust and support."
Campus Report provides a necessary medium for
"communicating diverse opinions on contemporary
issues," Casper said.
But Zare said after the meeting that Campus Re
port is "settling into the all-too-easy," and he fears
the University is avoiding giving space to issues that
deserve a lot of discussion, such as Casper's mention
of a three-year undergraduate program.
Zare's sentiments were echoed by Dean Emeritus
of Student Affairs James Lyons who wrote in the
Feb. 17 issue of Campus Report that the publication
was "beginning to read and feel like a corporate
house organ."
Lyons also criticized the publication for failing to
provide in-depth coverage of Casper's three-year
program.
Campus Report editor Pete
Rapalus declined to comment,
because he did not attend the
meeting. News Service Director
Terry Shepard could not be
reached last night.
Casper attributed some
changes in Campus Report to
budget cuts, which have caused
News Service to shift a lot of its
resources to publicizing the Uni
versity to the national media.

According to Casper, this is an
important function of News Ser
vice. He said other major univer
sities do a better job of displaying
their products — teaching, learn
ing and research — to the nation
al audience.
Another reason Campus
Report has had to change its focus
is because there have not been as
many crises to report on campus
this year, Casper said.
Other business at the first sen
ate meeting since Jan. 21 includ
ed a report — from the ad hoc
Committee on the Structures and
Functions~of the Standing Corn

mittees, STANCOM — on uniting
the Committee on Libraries and
the Committee on Academic Com
puting and Information Systems.
According to STANCOM Chair
Joseph Goodman, STANCOM
decided that the individual needs
served by both committees were
so great that combining them
would just "create another com
mittee of policy."
Although the senate kept those
committees separate, a motion
was made and carried through to
disband STANCOM, thus reduc
ing the total number of Universi
ty committees by one.
