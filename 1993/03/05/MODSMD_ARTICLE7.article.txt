# Honoring Leland, Jane and a big tree
## Casper to give Founders' Day speech, continues 40-year tradition 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
It's a fitting coincidence that Stan
ford's Founders' Day falls on the same
date as California Arbor Day this year.
This Sunday, the traditional cere
mony — which pays tribute to Leland
and Jane Stanford — will also recog
nize the dying oak tree next to their
tomb.
The 300-year-old heritage oak, re
puted to be one of Leland Stanford's
favorite trees, is infected with bacteri
al diseases that have persisted despite
several attempts at treatment. The
tree, one of Stanford's largest live
coast oaks, will be removed later this

month.
A young 15-foot oak that will re
place the old tree will be brought to the
Mausoleum for the ceremony, in keep
ing with the Arbor Day theme.
The Founders' Day celebration has
been performed for "at least 40 years"
and probably more, according to Eric
Hutchinson, professor emeritus of
chemistry and marshal of the
Founders' Day procession.
Co-hosted by the Stanford Histori
cal Society and the Stanford Alumni
Association, Founders' Day is tradi
tionally celebrated on the Sunday clos
est to Leland Stanford's March 9
birthday.
President Casper will begin this

year's activities, delivering a speech on
invectives at the 10 a.m. University
public worship service in Memorial
Church.
Historically, the morning sermon
has been directed toward the founders,
Hutchinson said. "It's typically asked
that [the speaker] talk about the
founders and what a good job they
did."
Though the speakers vary from
year to year, Historical Society Presi
dent Alfßrandin said,"lt'sanice thing
for the president of the University to
give the tribute."
Hutchinson also feels Casper may
bring a different perspective to
his speech. "He's the first presi
dent we've had who's not really
had much prior association with
the University. It should be
interesting to hear what he has
to say about our founders."
After the service, University
leaders and community members
traditionally form a procession,
led by student members of the
Stanford Student Alumni Net
work, from Memorial Church to
the Mausoleum.
Two wreaths, provided by the
senior class and the Alumni
Association, will then be placed
at the Mausoleum door. The
Mausoleum will remain open
until 1 p.m. for public visitation.
