Hey Daily staffers!
Thanks for a
great job this quarter!
Thanks for maintaining your enthusiasm right
up until the last issue! You've all been great.
Hit the books and pass your classes so you
don't get kicked out of school (We need you too
much around here).
As for next quarter,there's lots to look forward to —
broomball, The Exploratorium's Tactile Dome and a co-ed
IM softball team. We will have a full staff meeting to plan
for Spring Quarter on Friday, April 2, so mark your
calendars. Our first issue is Monday, March 29, so don't
forget to come to work on Sunday the 28th.
Have a fantastic break!
— from your EIC, who's catching up on her ZZZZs as you read this.
