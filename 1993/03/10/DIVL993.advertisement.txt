It's in your hands. Pur
chase these all'cotum,
genuine Blue Boar Brand
T-shirts and the pig will live out his
life happily digging /or truffles. Avail
able in XL u> fit everybody. (Clockwise
from top left; "Hip Hops", "Irish
Snout", "Green Shamrock")
Actually, the poor fellow
is better known as the boar
whose snout appears on the
Wsinhards
Ale label.
The same
boar that's
become a
symbol, an
icon, a lov
able pet.
And if T
shirts aren't
purchased
soon, said boar might end
up as a plate of ribs, forc
ing us to completely redo
the ale label.
So if you have a heart and
you're the type who likes to
hang out with a Weinhard s
Ale now and then, we hope
you'll fork over the
dough and purchase
one or more of our
remarkably cool T
shirts featured in this
ad (they are the official
hanging out apparel
this season).
You can get them by
either calling us, toll-free,
at 1-800-BLUE BOAR and

ordering with your credit
card, or you can simply fill

this ad
and send
it to us with
a check,

ber. It's that easy.
Check out the
shirts. Pick up
your phone or put
pen to paper.
And help save our
Blue Boar from becoming a
blue plate special. Thank you.
HOLD YOUR FIRE
I do have a heart and I'm willing to buy a
T-shirt or two or three in order to save the pig.
