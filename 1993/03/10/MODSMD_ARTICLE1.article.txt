# Clinton names two Stanford experts to top posts
## Stiglitz nominated for Council of Economic Advisers 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
In Washington, presidents may
come and go, but Stanford econo
mists are a constant.
Economics Prof, and Hoover
Senior Fellow Joseph Stiglitz was
nominated by President Clinton
to be the third member of his
Council of Economic Advisers this
week.
If confirmed by the Senate,

Stiglitz will be the second Stanford economics profes
sor in as many administrations to hold the high post.
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin was a member of
former President Bush's council, which aids the pres
ident in making decisions on economic policies and
proposals. If confirmed by the Senate, Stiglitz will
concentrate on microeconomic issues.
Stiglitz, who has taught at Stanford for six years,
is "the most prolific economist of all time," said Eco
nomics Prof. Tim Taylor, who was supposed to teach
Economics 1 with Stiglitz this quarter. Stiglitz never

actually taught, however, because he was interview
ing for the position on the council, Taylor said.
During the past two decades, Stiglitz, 50, has writ
ten hundreds of articles on various economic topics,
such as the economics of development, banks and
credit rationing as well as the labor market. He is one
of the foremost authorities on the "economics of in
formation," or what happens to the economy when
employers and lenders have insufficient or imperfect
information.
"The reason Joe is a good person for microeco
nomics is that a number of issues in microeconomics
now are problems which involve the role of informa
tion and risk in how markets work, and Joe has done
more research with that than just about anybody
else," Taylor said.
Stiglitz is currently in Washington, and could not
be reached for comment.
Kenneth Arrow, professor emeritus of economics,
called Stiglitz "one of the ablest economists in the
United States," and said the Stanford community
would miss his valuable contributions.
