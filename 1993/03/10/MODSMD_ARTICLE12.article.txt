FBI suspects terrorist group
WASHINGTON (AP) - A "well
known terrorist group" is likely respon
sible for the bombing at New York's
World Trade Center, an FBI official told
Congress yesterday.
"We're saying it's a group that knows
what they're doing, and perhaps not an
ad-hoc bunch of terrorists," said James
Fox, head of the FBl's New York office.
Fox told a House Judiciary subcom
mittee that it was investigators' "gut
feeling" that experienced terrorists were
responsible for last month's blast that
killed five, injured 1,000 and shut down
the World Trade Center for several
weeks.
"I don't have a specific group in
mind," Fox told reporters later, adding

that agents based the speculation on "30
years of this stuff."
Terrorists seize embassy
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) â€”
Nicaragua's Cardinal Miguel Obando y

hostages and end a two-day siege of the
Nicaraguan Embassy.
The men stormed the embassy Mon

arms. They hold Nicaraguan Ambas
sador Alfonso Robelo and as many as 18
others, most of them embassy workers.
There have been no reports of injuries.
The one-story embassy was surround
ed by about 40 police and eight patrol
cars.
