# King takes stand in beating trial
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Rodney King
took the witness stand yesterday for the
first time since his videotaped beating
and said he was "attacked" by police offi
cers, including one who screamed racial
insults and told him, "We're going to kill
you."
King, speaking in a soft voice, said he
never attacked the officers accused of vio
lating his civil rights.
"I was trying to stay alive," King told
the jury. He said that during the beat
ing he was coughing blood out of his
mouth.
King's testimony was his first detailed
public account of the night the black
motorist's speeding car was pursued by
police officers and he was beaten, after
finally coming to a stop.
The testimony in the federal trial of
four white policemen came two years after
the March 3, 1991, beating that led to a

state trial, acquittals and three days of
deadly rioting.
King, 27, said the officers asked at one
point how he felt. "I said I felt fme. I didn't
want them to know what they were doing
to me was really getting to me. I didn't
want them to have the satisfaction."
Under questioning by prosecutor
Barry Kowalski, King insisted he never
resisted arrest and suggested that a
woman state Highway Patrol officer who
first tracked him down for speeding could
have handcuffed him, if Los Angeles police
had not intervened.
He said he was lying face down, tiying
to cooperate when officers leaped on him
and "one of them applied pressure like he
was trying to snap my wrist in half." He
said he screamed in pain, and then heard
someone shout "Back!"
"They all backed away from me and
I'm still on the ground waiting to be

handcuffed and shortly after that I was
shocked by a Taser."
Asked what the stun-gun darts felt
like when they hit him, he said, "I got
shocked and it felt like my blood was boil
ing inside of me."
Moments later, as he was on the
ground, he said, he heard the shout:
" 'We're going to kill you nigger, run!' "
"I ran closer to the Hyundai (his car)
and I was struck across the right side of
the face again," King said, pointing to his
temple. "To this day there is a bump
right here."
Kowalski asked what King heard
while being clubbed and kicked.
"I'm not exactly sure, but I heard
while they were hitting me chants of
'killer, nigger, how do you feel killer?' "
He was asked whether he truly
remembered the officers say "nigger" or
"killer." King said he wasn't sure.
