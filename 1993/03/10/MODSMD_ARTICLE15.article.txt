## Bill's master plan 
### 
Clinton's financial-aid,
public-service plan is a
rational, solid proposal

UPON GRADUATION, Stan
ford students glide seamlessly
into positions like financial
analyst, consultant, lawyer and doc
tor. But if President Clinton has his
way, Stanford students will soon be
repaying their financial aid through
public-service work as policemen and
policewomen, teachers and case
workers for the homeless.
In his recently announced plan,
Clinton has set forth a program
under which students can repay two
years of college loans through one
year of public service in several fields.
The proposal will begin with a 1,000-
student pilot program this summer
and, hopefully, expand to include
100,000 students by 1997.
AJthough the details of this plan
are currently vague, it is a laudable
effort which deserves public support,
especially among the students which
it will most profoundly affect.
Many financial-aid and public-ser
vice experts have voiced reservations
over the plan, stating that it will
merely establish a large federal
bureaucracy and will undoubtedly be
abused by students unwilling to ful
fill their part of the bargain. Howev
er, Clinton's program is crafted along
lines that address both of these con
cerns.
First, the public service students
are to perform will be community
based, and therefore not subject to
the vagarities of a federal bureaucra
cy. To ensure this, Clinton has pro
posed that students become involved
in positions that necessitate commu
nity involvement, such as police offi
cers and teachers.
In addition to discouraging the
establishment of a monolithic federa.
behemoth, the local orientation of
the program's public-service effort
will also guarantee that legitimate
community needs are addressed. As
a matter of course, each community

knows far better than the federal
government what its respective
needs and wants are, and the public
service volunteers will respond to
these concerns, not the prerogatives
of the national government.
The second concern of many crit
ics — that the program will be poor
ly enforced and therefore will
undoubtedly be abused — is both
unnecessarily pessimistic with
regard to students' sense of commu
nity loyalty as well as ignorant of the
"garnishment" aspect of Clinton's
program. This proposal dictates that
students who choose not to partici
pate in unpaid public service can
repay their federal loans with a per
centage of their incomes.
Another advantage of the pro
gram is that it provides a great
amount of flexibility to participating
students. The community service
which a volunteer undertakes can be
completed before, after or during
their education. Instead of a year
abroad, students can therefore spend
a year involved in a community pro
ject, bettering both themselves and
their communities.
Admittedly, the program has not
been clearly defined to date, being lit
tle more than the subject of a Clinton
stump speech at this point. However,
Clinton's proposal is the most even
handed community-service plan to
be offered for quite a while, as it
addresses both financial-aid and
public-service issues while establish
ing reasonable means to ensure that
both programs are encouraged.
Currently, defaults on college
loans are at an unacceptably high
level; Clinton's program appeals to
students' patriotism and financial
common-sense in order to solve both
this problem and those of outside
communities.
In all, Clinton's plan makes col
lege more affordable for many stu
dents, gives them an opportunity to
help other communities in positions
oftentimes far different from those
they might otherwise adopt upon
graduation, and improves the locali
ties in which these students will
serve.
Who could ask for anything more?
