\Superior, 9 'inferior 9 students in the eye of the beholder

IFIND THE proposals contained in
Robert Greer Cohn's Feb. 25 letter to
The Daily concerning Stanford admis
sions unclear, at best. He suggests sacri
ficing our generosity to so-called "less
qualified students" in order to maintain
a "high-level and unpressured" educa
tional atmosphere for the capable
(including less-affluent but intellectually
superior students).
First, I would like to know who our
"less-qualified students" are. At the end
of nine quarters at Stanford, I have
found people who I despise, people whom
I am at ideological odds with and people
with whom I can argue for 40 days and
40 nights.
I have met people from numerous
points along the economic spectrum. I
have known people from idyllic family
backgrounds and people from abusive
households. I have yet to find someone
"intellectually inferior."
I'd like Mr. Cohn to find these intel

lectually inferior students to whom he
refers and introduce them to me.
I would also like to know how Mr.
Cohn plans to select his "intellectually
superior students." What criteria would
he use? Would he like to use standard
ized exam scores combined with a mea
sure of extra-curricular achievement?
Mr. Cohn's belief in a clear distinction
between the "superior" and the "inferi
or" disturbs me, both because of its arro
gant presumptions and for personal rea
sons. A close friend of mine, upon admis
sion to Stanford, would have appeared to
have been the inferior student in com
parison to me. However, based on his
performance these past two-and-a-half
years at Stanford, my friend is clearly
the superior student and will make a far
greater contribution to society than I
ever will.
Mr. Cohn says that "the future of this
place is on the line." "This place" called
Stanford is not composed of the Quad

buildings, not SLAC, not the pretty lake:
Stanford is created from a combination
of students, faculty and staff.
Destroy a building and it can be â€¢
rebuilt. Kill a student or a professor, and
you have lost someone irreplaceable. In a
time of fundamental demographic
changes, profound cultural divisions and
conflict and deep societal questioning,
the last thing Stanford needs to do is
chop off its very limbs and create a small
er, more elitist student population.
Unquestionably, our financial trou
bles are deep. But to react with knee-jerk
conservatism and rant at some vague
"political correctness" demon is of no
use.
Simply because Mr. Cohn's idealism
has floundered and grown grumpy is no
reason to thoughtlessly slash and bum
the idea of a broad-based composition of
the student body for the sake of some
vague, undetermined, supposedly superi
or students.

We must ask what the purpose of the
university actually is. The act of educa
tion goes beyond simply learning your A-
B-C's and 1-2-3's. Without contact with
students of different experiences, cul
tures and economic backgrounds, learn
ing would be a rather dry process.
There are also more profound ques
tions at stake. How shall we live within a
multicultural society; what allows us to
coexist? Where do our differences lie, and
from what do they stem?
If we are to confront these issues with
any meaningful depth, we must be
exposed to them in a setting where there
is time and space to contemplate, analyze
and discuss.
To diminish the variety within the
student community would be to hinder
this process. Would it be too "idealistic"
to avoid cutting off our head while
attempting to save our nose?
