# Temporal morality not a correct path to follow
## 
### 
In her March 1 letter to The Daily,
Marilyn Mallory listed several things
that pro-life groups would do with the
money spent on the 12-page paid adver
tisement that appeared in The Daily the
week before, "If those pro-life groups
were really as interested in the welfare
of young women as they claim to be."
Although she implies that these groups
had some other sinister motive, she is
strangely silent about what that motive
might be. I'm willing to hazard a guess
as to why the money was not spent buy
ing Norplant or helping those charitable
groups that "struggle on a shoestring."
The answer lies in the societal attitudes
that stand out in Mallory's letter.
Mallory says that "Perhaps costly ad
campaigns like that had their place in

the '80s but no longer; not in the
depressed California economy of the
'905." This statement contains two falla
cies that the ad's sponsor wanted to dis
pel: that morality is determined first by
what decade you live in, and, second, by
how much money you have.
Insight into another attitude the cam
paign hoped to challenge can be found in
Mallory's suggestions about where the
money should have been spent. If she
had looked closely at the insert, she
would have seen that this group was
involved with charitable groups that
help mothers — and also with groups
like Planned Parenthood that distribute
Norplant and other methods of birth
control. Unlike Mallory, who apparently
believes the solution to every problem
lies in an appropriate allocation of
money or the dissemination of adequate
technology, this pro-life group recog
nizes that the most fundamental solu
tion to this problem lies in a re-evalua-

tion of the values upon which we take a
stand.
Realizing that a great number of peo
ple today only scoff at these ideas, this
pro-life group felt this particular sum of
money would be best spent producing an
insert that might make a handful of peo
ple think twice about the morality of
abortion. I applaud their effort.
