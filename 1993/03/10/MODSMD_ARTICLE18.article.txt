# An invitation to Arab-Israeli peace meeting
## 
### 
Everyone who has kept abreast of the
letters written on the Arab-Israeli con
flict over the last four weeks seems to
agree on only one thing: reciprocal accu
sations are a waste of time and do not
serve the interest of those seeking
peace.

Thus, I invite members of Middle
East Focus, the Organization of Arab
Students in Stanford, the Jewish Stu
dent Association, the Israeli Student
Organization — as well as any organiza
tion or student seriously interested in
designing a program to increase under
standing among Arabs and Jews — to
attend a meeting at 7:30 p.m., Wednes
day, March 31, at the Law School, Room
180.
Only those committed to an attempt
to achieve peace both in the Middle East
and within the Stanford community
should attend. I request that those
whose priority is to advance political
agendas (from either side) refrain from
attending. This meeting should center
around potential non-confrontational
activities that can be jointly organized
by Jewish and Arab organizations to
bridge gaps and foster co-existence.
