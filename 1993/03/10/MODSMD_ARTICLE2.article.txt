# Burglary, bike theft increase

Bicycle thefts and burglaries
on the Stanford campus increased
significantly during 1992 while
vehicle theft and drug violations
decreased, according to statistics
recently released by the Stanford
Police.
The figures for violent crimes
remained at low levels, although
there was a murder on campus
over the summer — the first since
1982.
"We really haven't had a lot of
violent crimes . . . and we'd like to
keep it that way," said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
But when it comes to smaller
scale crimes, Stanford hasn't
been as fortunate.
Vehicle burglary charted one
of the largest increases of any
crime — 109 percent — from 141
reported incidents in 1991 to 295
in 1992.
Niemeyer said Stanford is a
target for vehicle burglary be
cause the "quality of stereos is
quite good. . . . There is a big mar
ket for them."
"Vehicle burglary is up all over
the region," he added. Niemeyer
said he suspects that thieves sell
the stolen car stereos and use the
money for drugs.
Stereos and other items stolen
from cars — such as coats, purses
or wallets — are rarely recovered,
said Niemeyer. In the summer
months some burglars watch for
joggers who put their belongings
in the trunks of their cars and
then break into those cars looking
for wallets, he added.
Bicycle thefts also shot up last
year, rising 15 percent from 588
to 682. The education and infor
mation programs that the Stan
ford Police Department sponsors
to prevent bike thefts "are obvi
ously not working," said Niemey
er.
"We're trying to get people to
be made aware that most bikes
are not secured properly or are
locked to themselves," he said.
