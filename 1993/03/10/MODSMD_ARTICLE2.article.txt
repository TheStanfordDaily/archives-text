# Burglary, bike theft increase
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Bicycle thefts and burglaries
on the Stanford campus increased
significantly during 1992 while
vehicle theft and drug violations
decreased, according to statistics
recently released by the Stanford
Police.
The figures for violent crimes
remained at low levels, although
there was a murder on campus
over the summer — the first since
1982.
"We really haven't had a lot of
violent crimes . . . and we'd like to
keep it that way," said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
But when it comes to smaller
scale crimes, Stanford hasn't
been as fortunate.
Vehicle burglary charted one
of the largest increases of any
crime — 109 percent — from 141
reported incidents in 1991 to 295
in 1992.
Niemeyer said Stanford is a
target for vehicle burglary be
cause the "quality of stereos is
quite good. . . . There is a big mar
ket for them."
"Vehicle burglary is up all over
the region," he added. Niemeyer
said he suspects that thieves sell
the stolen car stereos and use the
money for drugs.
Stereos and other items stolen
from cars — such as coats, purses
or wallets — are rarely recovered,
said Niemeyer. In the summer
months some burglars watch for
joggers who put their belongings
in the trunks of their cars and
then break into those cars looking
for wallets, he added.
Bicycle thefts also shot up last
year, rising 15 percent from 588
to 682. The education and infor
mation programs that the Stan
ford Police Department sponsors
to prevent bike thefts "are obvi
ously not working," said Niemey
er.
"We're trying to get people to
be made aware that most bikes
are not secured properly or are
locked to themselves," he said.
By comparison, UC-Berkeley's
bike theft rate has decreased, falling
from 585 in 1990, to 516 in 1991
and 485 in 1992.
At the end of 1991, the universi
ty's Crime Prevention Unit started a
program in which five officers ride
mountain bicycles around campus
and patrol bicycle racks. Additional
ribbon bike racks were also installed
on UC-Berkeley's campus in 1992.
The U-shaped racks made it easier for
bicyclists to lock their bikes securely.
Niemeyer said Stanford's prob
lem is partly due to a ring of bike
thieves working out of Burlingame
that strips stolen bicycles, sands off
their serial numbers and then sells
them a few hours later.
"In order to curb bicycle theft,
you have to stake out a place; it's
very labor intensive," Niemeyer
said, adding that his department
doesn't have enough resources to do
stake-outs.
A third type of pilfering also
showed an increase. Structural bur
glary — defined as breaking into a
building on campus with intent to

steal something — rose from 161
reported incidents in 1991 to 201 in
1992 — more than 24 percent.
Not all crimes have increased,
however — some have shown signif
icant decreases.
Theft of motor vehicles at Stan
ford has petered off in recent years,
from 53 reported incidents in 1991
to 35 in 1992, a 34 percent drop.
Although alcohol violations
increased slightly last year, from 76
incidents in 1991 to 84, they
remained significantly below their
1989 (235 violations) and 1990 (132
violations) levels. Drug violations,
too, have consistently decreased,
from a high of 61 in 1989 to 14 in
1990, nine in 1991 and five last year.
Elise Lenox, the director of the
alcohol and drug abuse prevention
program at Cowell Student Health
Center suggested several reasons
why substance abuse violations
have decreased.
"Without a doubt, the fraterni
ties and sororities are feeling a lot
more pressure from their national
chapter to have parties in different
ways than before," she said.
Stanford also logged its first
homicide in a decade last year. On

Sept. 9, 58-year-old University
steam fitter Vernon McMullen was
shot and killed — allegedly by his
wife, Ora — in the campus mainte
nance area on Bonair Siding.
The number of arsons went up
250 percent, from two in 1991 to
five last year, an increase Niemeyer

could not explain. The number of
aggravated assaults dropped from
six in 1991 to four in 1992.
The number of people reported
robbed last year remained at its
1991 level of two cases. No forcible
rapes or manslaughters were
reported last year.

"We're trying to get people to
be made aware that most bikes
are not secured properly or are
locked to themselves," he said.
By comparison, UC-Berkeley's
bike theft rate has decreased, falling
from 585 in 1990, to 516 in 1991
and 485 in 1992.
At the end of 1991, the universi
ty's Crime Prevention Unit started a
program in which five officers ride
mountain bicycles around campus
and patrol bicycle racks. Additional
ribbon bike racks were also installed
on UC-Berkeley's campus in 1992.
The U-shaped racks made it easier for
bicyclists to lock their bikes securely.
Niemeyer said Stanford's prob
lem is partly due to a ring of bike
thieves working out of Burlingame
that strips stolen bicycles, sands off
their serial numbers and then sells
them a few hours later.
"In order to curb bicycle theft,
you have to stake out a place; it's
very labor intensive," Niemeyer
said, adding that his department
doesn't have enough resources to do
stake-outs.
A third type of pilfering also
showed an increase. Structural bur
glary — defined as breaking into a
building on campus with intent to

steal something — rose from 161
reported incidents in 1991 to 201 in
1992 — more than 24 percent.
Not all crimes have increased,
however — some have shown signif
icant decreases.
Theft of motor vehicles at Stan
ford has petered off in recent years,
from 53 reported incidents in 1991
to 35 in 1992, a 34 percent drop.
Although alcohol violations
increased slightly last year, from 76
incidents in 1991 to 84, they
remained significantly below their
1989 (235 violations) and 1990 (132
violations) levels. Drug violations,
too, have consistently decreased,
from a high of 61 in 1989 to 14 in
1990, nine in 1991 and five last year.
Elise Lenox, the director of the
alcohol and drug abuse prevention
program at Cowell Student Health
Center suggested several reasons
why substance abuse violations
have decreased.
"Without a doubt, the fraterni
ties and sororities are feeling a lot
more pressure from their national
chapter to have parties in different
ways than before," she said.
Stanford also logged its first
homicide in a decade last year. On

Sept. 9, 58-year-old University
steam fitter Vernon McMullen was
shot and killed — allegedly by his
wife, Ora — in the campus mainte
nance area on Bonair Siding.
The number of arsons went up
250 percent, from two in 1991 to
five last year, an increase Niemeyer

could not explain. The number of
aggravated assaults dropped from
six in 1991 to four in 1992.
The number of people reported
robbed last year remained at its
1991 level of two cases. No forcible
rapes or manslaughters were
reported last year.
