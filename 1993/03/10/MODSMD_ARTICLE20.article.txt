## A 						spring-break itinerary 
### 
SO WHAT ARE YOU gonna do? A
roadtrip to Mexico to enjoy the
scenery and hospitality? Camping in
the Sierras? Or perhaps one of those
Alternative Spring Break things that will
most likely go down as one more entry on
my list of "things I wished I would have
done in college."
I remember sophomore year, when a
couple of my drawmates and I were dis
cussing possible spring-break plans. We
narrowed our decision down to four choic
es:
• A pilgrimage to Graceland to see the
grave of the king, and sing "Heartbreak
Hotel" in barbershop reggae. On the way
we were gonna take'a short detour to
check out the second-largest ball of twine
in the world. Hey, we were visionaries.
• A jaunt down to Arizona to watch
spring training. Maybe catch on with the
Indians as relief pitchers, or apply for
general manager of the Rockies.
• A trip to a Taco Bell in El Paso so we
could truly say we "made a run for the
border." Perhaps find all possible combi
nations of the 590 and 790 menus, and
run a test on how many soft tacos you can
eat before you start to taste them and
realize what you're eating.
• A journey to Salt Lake City to watch
NCAA regionals and hang with Dick
Vitale. Dress up in basketball uniforms
and see if we could sneak on the floor in
the guise of players from "Southern Mid
dle Valley State."

We ended up doing none of these, and
instead I had to settle for yet another
break of hanging around my home town
wearing a Stanford sweatshirt every
where I went. Even to the beach.
And I violated an unspoken but stand
ing rule of spring breaks. I did something
unspectacular.
And the next year was even more
unspectacular. I loaded up on mini-
Guidas, Reese's and Tropicana Twisters
with all my end-of-the-quarter surplus
points and spent the week as the only
person on campus, like the last guy on
the "M*A*S*H" set after the last episode.
I stayed nine wonderful days and eight
enticing nights in beautiful and luxuri
ous Sterling Quad, California.
Those were exciting times. My days
were filled with laundry and Crystal
Quest. My nights with sleep and Jackie
Collins. I finally got around to vacuum
ing my room and reading the owner's
manual of my stereo. Stuff that really
needed to get done.
In a similar vein, maybe one of you
could volunteer to stay and wash off that
Cal paint all over our campus? Or maybe
go over to Cal and paint up theirs?
Because there's no way that I'm spending
my last collegiate spring break doing that
stuff. I've got plans. Big plans.
First I'm going to Palm Springs to learn
how to drink. And I'm not talking little
drinking like some sorority pre-party. I'm
talking big drinking. Ernest Hemingway

drinking. I want to spend at least half the
night hugging a toilet bowl. That's fun
incarnate. Then I'll cruise the strip in a
rental domestic convertible. I'll conve
niently forget to put on sunscreen so that
everyone will ask about my new facial
color. Maybe get a hickie somewhere.
I think that people view spring break
as an opportunity to fill a D.R. in desper
ate living. But we don't need to reserve
one week out of the year to be different.
I'm a pretty unspectacular guy, so my
break will probably likewise be unspec
tacular. And that's good — it's who I am.
And I'm not saying not to have fun. I
spent one break playing marathon cro
quet, watching approximately 43 hours
of monster-car rallies and finding out
how many jelly beans I could fit in my
mouth (82 — no black ones). I want to
have fun. I want all of us to have fun.
But I want us to have fun for more
than just a week. Spring break should
just be another week of life — and life
needs to be one big spring break.

Mike Langford will keep the classic film
"Fraternity Vacation" in mind while in
Palm Springs. Wanna come ?
