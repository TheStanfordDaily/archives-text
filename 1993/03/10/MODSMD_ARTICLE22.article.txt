## Scientists hope Clinton's budget picks up the SLAC Project B cited as important for the future study of particle physics 
### Heather Rock 
For the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center, President Clin
ton's budget proposals — expect
ed to be released later this month
— could determine its future as a
world-class physics research cen
ter.
If the Department of Energy
budget includes SLAC's "B-facto
ry" project, Stanford scientists say
the center will prosper as a
research institution. The project,
which will put scientists on the
cutting edge of high-energy
physics, will try to find out why
our universe is made up of matter,
and not anti-matter. Anti-matter
is identical to matter but has the
opposite electrical charge.
Physicists at SLAC,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and Lawrence Livermore Labo
ratory want to upgrade SLAC's
existing particle collider into a
B-factory. A B-factory is an
accelerator that will produce
collisions between electrons and
their anti-particles, called
positrons.
Some of the electron
positron collisions annihilate
each other, releasing large
amounts of energy and many
subatomic particles that decay
quickly. In one-fourth of all
such collisions, a heavy sub
atomic particle known as a B
meson and its antiparticle, the
anti-B-meson, are created.
By measuring how these B par
ticles decay, physicists hope to
understand the origin of the "CP
violation," which is the opposite
of "CP symmetry."
Prior to 1964, physicists
believed that the universe had a
basic symmetry such that if you
observed a process with two parti
cles, and then observed a second
process in a mirror, replacing par
ticles with anti-particles, you
would see identical processes.
This symmetry is called CP sym
metry.
However, in 1964 an experi
ment, conducted by V. Fitch and
J. Cronin, demonstrated a viola
tion of this symmetry. This
research earned Fitch and Cronin
a Nobel Prize and opened up new
way of studying particle physics.
Now numerous physicists
looking for the origins of the uni
verse want to study the violation
of CP symmetry with the B
meson.
"The science of the B-factory is
CP violation," said B-factory pro
ject leader Jonathan Dorfan. "It

turns out that CP violation is cru
cial in the birth of the universe."
Many theorists believe uni
verses are created with equal
amounts of matter and antimat
ter. According to Dorfan, without
a difference between matter and
antimatter, both would have been
annihilated, leaving us with only
a puff of smoke.
Instead, former Soviet physi
cist Andrei Sakharov proposed
that CP violation has led to a
slight preference for matter —
resulting in a universe made up of
matter.
"There is a worldwide excite
ment in the physics community to
study CP violation," said Dorfan.
Physicists think the research
from the B-factory will be able to
explain the origin of CP violation.
The project's "detector" will
measure the rich spectrum of B
meson decays, looking for particu
lar decays which can reveal the
existence of CP violation in the sys
tem.
"We need the B-factory
because it's such a spectacular
piece of physics," Dorfan said.
Michael Riordan, assistant to
the director of SLAC, said that an
allocation of 1994 fiscal year
funds to build the B-factory
would be a great boost for SLAC,
which depends solely on govern
ment funding.
The Bush administration's
budget included $46 million to
start the project in October. "The
outgoing Bush proposal looks
good to keep the lab on the fron
tier," said Director of Research
David Leith.
By virtue of its existing
equipment, SLAC is an ideal
site to build a B-factory. By
upgrading their equipment, the
final cost to install a B-factory
and detector will cost SLAC
$193 million.
"It's a crafty way to bring an
old machine back to life with
seven to 10 years of good
physics," Riordan said. "We need
a new facility every seven to 10
years to remain vital."
Currently, the High Energy
Physics Advisory Panel has recom
mended the B-factory be given
third priority for Department of
Energy funding, after the Super
conducting Super Collider and a
new injector for the Fermi Nation
al Lab in Chicago.
Several years of favorable
reviews culminated in the April
1992 endorsement of the B-facto
ry. The panel determined that the
B-factory, along with the super

collider, will attract a significant
fraction of U.S. scientists as well
as researchers from abroad. They
predict that both projects will
employ some 250 Ph. D.sand 200
doctorate students.
According to Leith, SLAC,
along with other labs, will have a
hard time if the government
doesn't support basic research.
In October the outgoing Bush
Administration's budget included
$46 million to begin the project.
This was in addition to an operat
ing budget of $130 million for
SLAC. To build the B-factory in
four years, as planned, SLAC
needs a minimum total operating
budget of at least $150 million
each year.
Despite fears that President
Clinton will cut project funding,
Burton Richter, SLAC's direc
tor, said a January memo that
"there is much work to do but I
am very encouraged" about the
B-factory staying in Clinton's
budget.
Richter said that Stanford's
B-factory would make it the
only program in the United
States that could complement
the super collider's proton-col
liding capabilities.

because it's such a spectacular
piece of physics," Dorfan said.
Michael Riordan, assistant to
the director of SLAC, said that an
allocation of 1994 fiscal year
funds to build the B-factory
would be a great boost for SLAC,
which depends solely on govern
ment funding.
The Bush administration's
budget included $46 million to
start the project in October. "The
outgoing Bush proposal looks
good to keep the lab on the fron
tier," said Director of Research
David Leith.
By virtue of its existing
equipment, SLAC is an ideal
site to build a B-factory. By
upgrading their equipment, the
final cost to install a B-factory
and detector will cost SLAC
$193 million.
"It's a crafty way to bring an
old machine back to life with
seven to 10 years of good
physics," Riordan said. "We need
a new facility every seven to 10
years to remain vital."
Currently, the High Energy
Physics Advisory Panel has recom
mended the B-factory be given
third priority for Department of
Energy funding, after the Super
conducting Super Collider and a
new injector for the Fermi Nation
al Lab in Chicago.
Several years of favorable
reviews culminated in the April
1992 endorsement of the B-facto
ry. The panel determined that the
B-factory, along with the super

collider, will attract a significant
fraction of U.S. scientists as well
as researchers from abroad. They
predict that both projects will
employ some 250 Ph. D.sand 200
doctorate students.
According to Leith, SLAC,
along with other labs, will have a
hard time if the government
doesn't support basic research.
In October the outgoing Bush
Administration's budget included
$46 million to begin the project.
This was in addition to an operat
ing budget of $130 million for
SLAC. To build the B-factory in
four years, as planned, SLAC
needs a minimum total operating
budget of at least $150 million
each year.
Despite fears that President
Clinton will cut project funding,
Burton Richter, SLAC's direc
tor, said a January memo that
"there is much work to do but I
am very encouraged" about the
B-factory staying in Clinton's
budget.
Richter said that Stanford's
B-factory would make it the
only program in the United
States that could complement
the super collider's proton-col
liding capabilities.

For the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center, President Clin
ton's budget proposals — expect
ed to be released later this month
— could determine its future as a
world-class physics research cen
ter.
If the Department of Energy
budget includes SLAC's "B-facto
ry" project, Stanford scientists say
the center will prosper as a
research institution. The project,
which will put scientists on the
cutting edge of high-energy
physics, will try to find out why
our universe is made up of matter,
and not anti-matter. Anti-matter
is identical to matter but has the
opposite electrical charge.
Physicists at SLAC,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and Lawrence Livermore Labo
ratory want to upgrade SLAC's
existing particle collider into a
B-factory. A B-factory is an
accelerator that will produce
collisions between electrons and
their anti-particles, called
positrons.
Some of the electron
positron collisions annihilate
each other, releasing large
amounts of energy and many
subatomic particles that decay
quickly. In one-fourth of all
such collisions, a heavy sub
atomic particle known as a B
meson and its antiparticle, the
anti-B-meson, are created.
By measuring how these B par
ticles decay, physicists hope to
understand the origin of the "CP
violation," which is the opposite
of "CP symmetry."
Prior to 1964, physicists
believed that the universe had a
basic symmetry such that if you
observed a process with two parti
cles, and then observed a second
process in a mirror, replacing par
ticles with anti-particles, you
would see identical processes.
This symmetry is called CP sym
metry.
However, in 1964 an experi
ment, conducted by V. Fitch and
J. Cronin, demonstrated a viola
tion of this symmetry. This
research earned Fitch and Cronin
a Nobel Prize and opened up new
way of studying particle physics.
Now numerous physicists
looking for the origins of the uni
verse want to study the violation
of CP symmetry with the B
meson.
"The science of the B-factory is
CP violation," said B-factory pro
ject leader Jonathan Dorfan. "It

turns out that CP violation is cru
cial in the birth of the universe."
Many theorists believe uni
verses are created with equal
amounts of matter and antimat
ter. According to Dorfan, without
a difference between matter and
antimatter, both would have been
annihilated, leaving us with only
a puff of smoke.
Instead, former Soviet physi
cist Andrei Sakharov proposed
that CP violation has led to a
slight preference for matter —
resulting in a universe made up of
matter.
"There is a worldwide excite
ment in the physics community to
study CP violation," said Dorfan.
Physicists think the research
from the B-factory will be able to
explain the origin of CP violation.
The project's "detector" will
measure the rich spectrum of B
meson decays, looking for particu
lar decays which can reveal the
existence of CP violation in the sys
tem.
"We need the B-factory
because it's such a spectacular
piece of physics," Dorfan said.
