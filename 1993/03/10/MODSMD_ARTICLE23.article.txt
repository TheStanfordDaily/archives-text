# Wise bug and wisdom teeth

What are wisdom teeth for?
vx// doesn't seem like you need
them to chew, and they result in
medical problems like
impaction. Everyone has them
taken out anyway. Why hasn't
evolution gotten rid of them by
now?
— Chomping at the bit

A: Maybe they're really there to give us wisdom.
Given that many people in our culture have
them removed, it would certainly explain a lot.
Cynicism aside, the last molars on each side of our
upper and lower jaws did indeed earn their name
because of their late arrival in the mouth. Wisdom
teeth generally don't make an appearance until after
the onset of adolescence, and can lurk beneath the
gums until as late as one's 25th year.
Their eruption, so the folk etymology goes, was a
milestone in the physical — and, presumably, ethical
— maturity of an individual. Since without exception
human beings grow wiser as they age (just look at
Donald Kennedy), these teeth were named after the
character trait whose emergence they paralleled.
Nowadays wisdom teeth are just a bother: Often
their emergence disrupts the orderly arrangement of
established molars. In extreme cases the crowding
can result in an impaction — a painful condition in
which the wisdom teeth, for lack of a better place to
go, erupt into the bone.
Why do these teeth seem to be good for nothing
but removal? How did our species get into this
predicament, and why haven't we managed to get
ourselves out?
Well, I don't know. The wonderful thing is, no one
else does either. But there are lots of really interest
ing maybes.
In humans, but in no other mammals, the vocal
tract is divided into two separate chambers, which
can be controlled independently by moving the
tongue. The upper tract extends from the lips back to
the soft palate; the lower tract, perpendicular to the
upper, stretches from the palate to the vocal cords
themselves.
The right-angle bend between the two tubes gives
us a control over the grunts which emanate from our
larynx that is unequalled by any other mammal. This

control makes possible conveyance
of not only words but subtle
nuances of meaning and emotion.
The linguist Phil Lieber
man has proposed that the devel
opment of the two-tube vocal tract
(and the concomitant ability to
communicate verbally) was the
main driving force in recent
human evolution. The emergence
of such a structure required mod
ifications in the cranium and a
shrinking of the lower jaw. Conse-

quently, we have an increased tendency to choke on
our food and a propensity for impacted wisdom teeth.
Ain't progress grand?
One can also think of other reasons why the jaw
might have shrunk: It makes room for a bigger brain
without enlarging an already vast head (the job of a
childbearing female's pelvis is hard enough already).
It is conceivable that the forward force exerted by
an emerging wisdom tooth on other teeth serves a
useful function. Before the advent of modern den
tistry, loss of teeth to decay and injury would have
been commonplace, and the late emergence of the
rearmost molars would have served to shift estab
lished teeth forward to fill the inevitable gaps.
A third possibility is more subtle. Sometimes, a
change in the size of one body part results in a change
in the size of another — not for fitness reasons per se,
but just because it does. Perhaps the genetic changes
required to give us big brain cases just happen to also
give us smaller jaws; since the cognitive advantages
of the former outweigh the orthodontic disadvan
tages of the latter, our species was stuck with the risk
of painful impactions.
None of this intellectual masturbation addresses a
very good point raised in this week's queiy: Why
hasn't natural selection done something about this
situation?
Before the advent of modern dentistry, impacted
wisdom teeth went untreated. This could result in
infection and death. There is a selection pressure
against the way in which wisdom teeth behave.
So, why hasn't the selection pressure eliminated
this trait? Again, I get to cop out and say that no one
really knows. Possibly the effect of the pressure is
small compared to genetic background noise.
