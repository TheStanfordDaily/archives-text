# Budget cuts may doom big science
## 
### Ceara McNiff Staff writer 
President Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal
year 1994 may portend cuts and major changes
for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
The administration's budget, which will be
made public on April 5, will include a request for
high-energy and nuclear physics spending for
research facilities like SLAC and the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.
This year, however, Clinton's calls for
reduced government spending may deal big sci
ence programs a menacing blow. Congressional
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said in early February that White House Budget
Director Leon Panetta wanted to terminate the
$8.2 billion Superconducting Super Collider pro
gram in Texas and the $30 billion space-station
program.
Although the sources did not comment on
whether SLAC would be cut, every chop of the
budgetary ax affects Stanford's research center.
SLAC receives all of its funding — approxi
mately $150 million — from the Department of
Energy.
"If they cut us to $145 million, it'll hurt a lit

tie. If they cut us to $50 million, it'll hurt a lot,"
said Bill Kirk, former SLAC assistant to the
director.
Clinton has steadfastly denied that any deci
sions have been made about big science pro
grams like SLAC and the supercollider.
"We don't have any information about the
new budget and won't have any until April sth
when the new budget comes out," said White
House aide Tom Bruce.
But researchers at Stanford are worried that the
federal deficit and four other competing pro
jects — the supercollider, the human genome pro
ject, the space station and an Earth-observing sta
tion — will mean fewer funds for SLAC.
But Department of Energy spokesman JefT
Sherwood said that projects like the supercollid
er are not a "higher priority. They're just differ
ent priorities."
After the budget is approved, the Department of
Energy is responsible for allocating funds to projects
falling under the area of high-energy and nuclear
physics. According to Sherwood, the department
will request more than $1 billion for such programs
this year.
