# It is finals time again — relax!
## Some smart, sound advice to smash stress

AAARRRGGGGGGGGHHH
HHHH!!!!!!
Tension breaker. Had to be
done.
So here it is. Smack dab in the
middle of dead week and unless
you're the person on top of it all —
chances are your stress level is on
the rise.
We've all heard about the long
term negative effects of stress —
ulcers, nervous breakdowns, psy
chological trouble — but the short
term effects are deleterious as
well.
Headaches, insomnia,
increased susceptibility to sick
ness and yes, even diarrhea, can
all be caused by stress.
Finals week tends to be a time
of increased stress for many. Stu
dents deviate from their normal
routine, probably to study more.
But skipping meals, passing up
your usual afternoon run or stay
ing up 'til the wee hours in an
attempt to imprint 10 weeks
worth of material onto your brain
could actually impede your ability
to perform your best during this
week by increasing your stress
level.
The best approach to finals
week is not trying to eliminate the
stress that goes along IN the
week, but to manage it better.
Finals week is a notorious time
for all-nighters, but depriving your
body (and brain) of rest is simply
not good for you. Lack of sleep will
lower your ability to concentrate,
diminish your attention span and
even reduce memory recall.
Young adults require between
seven and eight hours a night. If
you have to pull an all-nighter in
order to pass that Hum Sex final,
doctors believe that in terms of
test performance, staying up all

night before your exam is prefer
able to staying up late two nights
before the test.
Exercise is also a great way to
relieve stress. The benefits of
exercising — increased energy lev
els and a sense of well-being —
make it an important activity.
The kind of exercise that makes
you sweat, like aerobics, is not
only great for keeping you in good
health, but is also believed to pro
mote the release of endorphins,
which give the body a natural
high.
Keeping with the athletic
theme, think of your final as an
athletic event. Choosing foods to
help you obtain energy during
your final is somewhat like choos-

Studies show that
people who drink
caffeine late in the
day will have
disturbed sleep
patterns at night

ing what to eat before a big game.
The key seems to be carbohy
drates, primarily because carbo
hydrates break down into sugar
slowly providing a continual
source of energy.
Proteins also eventually get
converted into glucose but take a
long time to be digested, during
which time blood, which aids in
the digestion process accumulates
in the stomach.
This is the reason behind that
bloated, lethargic feeling you get
after eating a big meal, a feeling
which may affect your concentra
tion, or worse yet, make you sleepy

— and that'll be the end of you.
"Sleepy!!" I say.
"Coffee!!" you say.
Wrong thought.
The Coffee House probably
sells more coffee during finals
week than any other week of the
quarter, because short of propping
your eyelids open with toothpicks,
caffeinated drinks are a conve
nient way to help you stay awake.
But studies show that people
who drink caffeine late in the day
will have disturbed sleep patterns
at night. So even if you think caf
feine is not affecting you, it actual
ly may be jeopardizing your ability
to sleep fitfully.
So if you want to get some sleep
before your test, you might want
to stop your coffee intake early in
the afternoon.
Stress is pretty common during
finals, but continual anxiety and
worry can lead to serious health
problems. Ulcers are what hap
pens when the stomach produces
too much acid (sometimes in
response to stress) and the acid
burns a hole in the stomach.
Some signs of an ulcer are pain
in the upper a v domen relieved by
foods or antacids. Although most
students who think they have
ulcers usually don't, prolonged
stress should definitely be reduced
to make sure ulcers don't occur.
Remember that life should not
be all work and that vacations can
be "healthy." Thank God spring
break is just around the corner,
eh?!
