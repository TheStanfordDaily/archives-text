# Campus prepares for next big one with new programs
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
A tremendous earthquake
rocks the Stanford campus. Stu
dents trickle out of buildings —
some injured, some dazed.
Their first step would be to
head for the nearest designated
assembly point. One person
would become a group leader and
assign a few of the fittest people
to become runners for relaying
information. Others would act as
a temporary first aid squad until
help arrives.
A third group is assigned to
digging up one of the 12 subter
ranean vats scattered strategical
ly all over campus. The silos,
each nine feet in diameter and
four feet deep, are filled with
food and supplies that will aid
10,000 people for 72 hours,
including pick-axes, splints,
stretchers, first aid kits, radios,
flashlights, body bags and vacu
um-packed food. There's even a
survival guide with instructions
on everything from digging
latrines to taking care of the
dead.
In the meantime, the police
station would have been convert
ed into an emergency headquar
ters from where support services
are coordinated. Runners would
come from all over campus and
deliver the status of their spots.
Ideally, this would be the
sequence of events following a
major earthquake. But it
requires that people be prepared
for the system to work — espe
cially in the face of predictions by
the United States Geological
Survey that the next major
earthquake to hit the Bay Area
may be seven to nine times more
intense than the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake, which registered
7.1 on the Richter scale and left
Stanford with $120 million in
damages.
And as the last earthquake
fades farther and farther into
Stanford's past, University offi
cials fear that the campus is not
ready to respond to such a crisis.

In an effort to prepare the
community for the next major
quake, several University offi
cials have launched an informal
drive to educate the community,
while others around campus and
in the medical center are working
to coordinate disaster plans.
The 'RA's Nightmare'
Part of the plan to ready the
campus for another Loma Prieta
includes holding training semi
nars for Resident Assistants and
Resident Fellows, as well as stu
dent affairs staff.
Coordinated by Dan Smith, the
special services manager for the
Department of Public Safety, the
first seminar for RA and RF's was
held in Stern Hall on Feb. 11.
After a video presentation and
a speech on making logical deci
sions, participants were presented
with several earthquake scenarios
entitled "The RA's Nightmare."
In a typical scenario, an earth
quake occurs at 2 a.m. Saturday
morning and there's one student
dead, several injured and many in
shock. The RA and RFs made
damage assessments and relayed
runners to an emergency head
quarters.
"After coming out of the work
shop, earthquakes seemed much
more viable to me. It was all much
more authentic .. . and I felt more
in touch with what earthquakes
would be like," said senior A.R.
Jones, who has been an RAin
Branner Hall for two years.
A lack of concern
Despite their efforts, however,
University officials have had to
struggle against a growing com
placency among campus resi
dents, and students in particular,
as the fears stirred by the Loma
Prieta earthquake recede from
memory.
Though the first staff seminar
brought together more than 100
people, the training session held
in Stern Hall only attracted some
30 RA and RFs.
It was "not the kind of

response we had hoped for," said
Keith Guy, the director of Hous
ing and Food Services.
Jones says he has had a hard
time trying to get incoming fresh
man to become more attentive to
earthquake dangers.
During his freshman year —
the year of the Loma Prieta earth
quake — students took earth
quake drills much more seriously,
he said.
During this year's Orientation,
"we had to work twice as hard to
make students pay attention" to
the presentations, he continued.
Both Guy and Griffith believe
students could be doing more to
exercise safety precautions in
their rooms, since falling objects
cause the majority of injuries
from earthquakes.
"I continue to worry that we
get away from the reality of the
last [earthquake]," said Guy. "I
think we have the capability to
rise to the occasion, but we aren't
as ready as the year after Loma
Prieta, in the sense that people
aren't prepared."
And the risk of massive dam
age during an earthquake is
always there, said Prof. Helmut
Krawinkler, co-director of the
Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center.
But Krawinkler said Stanford
is heading in the right direction in
terms of earthquake prepared
ness. "Stanford is doing more
about seismic safety than any
other California university I
know of," he said.
Medical plans
At the same time, the medical
center has been steadily estab
lishing a network that spans the
campus and Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center to support
the community in the event of a
major earthquake.
"We have two disaster plans
— one where our buildings are
affected, and one where they are
not. Accordingly, we have indi
viduals who will Ideal with)
everything from medical treat
ment to finance to responses to

the press," said Per Schenck, life
and safety coordinator for Stan
ford Hospital.
Hospital officials, knowing
how the hospital will be relied
upon to accommodate injured
patients from the local area, have
structured their emergency plans
to account for the eventuality
that its buildings may not be
usable.
Provided that the earthquake
doesn't iiyure the mcyority of the
hospital staff, Schenck said he
feels confident that the emergen
cy department will be able to
handle a substantial influx of
injured people, because the hos
pital presently takes in hundreds
of emergency cases everyday.
Referring to the hospital's
abilities to handle an earth
quake, he said, "Its all up to
mother nature. But in the last
one, the hospital did very well.
The emergency department and
the fire department did an excel
lent job."
Back-up medical supplies are
also stored in a number of places
around campus, while contracts
with vendors in the area guaran
tee that the hospital will be
unconditionally supplied with
crucial supplies, such as water,
medicine and beds.
In addition, if the Hospital
should become too damaged, an
old hospital building in Palo Alto
has been prepared for conver
sion into a temporary replace
ment.
All medical staff members are
also currently being trained for
disasters. Though training has
been going on for years, new pro
grams emphasize awareness of
the adversities an earthquake
can create.
The hospital has also imple
mented a system where special
ists, from surgeons to psychia
trists, will be rotated to serve
patients on a 24-hour basis.
And to respond more quickly to
hazardous spills and leakages, the
Environmental Health and Safety
office has formalized its own
emergency team that will respond

to hazardous spills and releases in
the event of an earthquake.
The unit would aid individuals
who have been injured in or
exposed to chemical, radiological or
biological spills and releases.
"We have come together since

the '89 earthquake," said Gary
Schell, a safety engineer. "The best
has been our ongoing training and
educating of people. We have been
getting people to recognize the dan
gers in labs and offices with haz
ardous chemicals."

ly all over campus. The silos,
each nine feet in diameter and
four feet deep, are filled with
food and supplies that will aid
10,000 people for 72 hours,
including pick-axes, splints,
stretchers, first aid kits, radios,
flashlights, body bags and vacu
um-packed food. There's even a
survival guide with instructions
on everything from digging
latrines to taking care of the
dead.
In the meantime, the police
station would have been convert
ed into an emergency headquar
ters from where support services
are coordinated. Runners would
come from all over campus and
deliver the status of their spots.
Ideally, this would be the
sequence of events following a
major earthquake. But it
requires that people be prepared
for the system to work — espe
cially in the face of predictions by
the United States Geological
Survey that the next major
earthquake to hit the Bay Area
may be seven to nine times more
intense than the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake, which registered
7.1 on the Richter scale and left
Stanford with $120 million in
damages.
And as the last earthquake
fades farther and farther into
Stanford's past, University offi
cials fear that the campus is not
ready to respond to such a crisis.

In an effort to prepare the
community for the next major
quake, several University offi
cials have launched an informal
drive to educate the community,
while others around campus and
in the medical center are working
to coordinate disaster plans.
The 'RA's Nightmare'
Part of the plan to ready the
campus for another Loma Prieta
includes holding training semi
nars for Resident Assistants and
Resident Fellows, as well as stu
dent affairs staff.
Coordinated by Dan Smith, the
special services manager for the
Department of Public Safety, the
first seminar for RA and RF's was
held in Stern Hall on Feb. 11.
After a video presentation and
a speech on making logical deci
sions, participants were presented
with several earthquake scenarios
entitled "The RA's Nightmare."
In a typical scenario, an earth
quake occurs at 2 a.m. Saturday
morning and there's one student
dead, several injured and many in
shock. The RA and RFs made
damage assessments and relayed
runners to an emergency head
quarters.
"After coming out of the work
shop, earthquakes seemed much
more viable to me. It was all much
more authentic .. . and I felt more
in touch with what earthquakes
would be like," said senior A.R.
Jones, who has been an RAin
Branner Hall for two years.
A lack of concern
Despite their efforts, however,
University officials have had to
struggle against a growing com
placency among campus resi
dents, and students in particular,
as the fears stirred by the Loma
Prieta earthquake recede from
memory.
Though the first staff seminar
brought together more than 100
people, the training session held
in Stern Hall only attracted some
30 RA and RFs.
It was "not the kind of

response we had hoped for," said
Keith Guy, the director of Hous
ing and Food Services.
Jones says he has had a hard
time trying to get incoming fresh
man to become more attentive to
earthquake dangers.
During his freshman year —
the year of the Loma Prieta earth
quake — students took earth
quake drills much more seriously,
he said.
During this year's Orientation,
"we had to work twice as hard to
make students pay attention" to
the presentations, he continued.
Both Guy and Griffith believe
students could be doing more to
exercise safety precautions in
their rooms, since falling objects
cause the majority of injuries
from earthquakes.
"I continue to worry that we
get away from the reality of the
last [earthquake]," said Guy. "I
think we have the capability to
rise to the occasion, but we aren't
as ready as the year after Loma
Prieta, in the sense that people
aren't prepared."
And the risk of massive dam
age during an earthquake is
always there, said Prof. Helmut
Krawinkler, co-director of the
Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center.
But Krawinkler said Stanford
is heading in the right direction in
terms of earthquake prepared
ness. "Stanford is doing more
about seismic safety than any
other California university I
know of," he said.
Medical plans
At the same time, the medical
center has been steadily estab
lishing a network that spans the
campus and Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center to support
the community in the event of a
major earthquake.
"We have two disaster plans
— one where our buildings are
affected, and one where they are
not. Accordingly, we have indi
viduals who will Ideal with)
everything from medical treat
ment to finance to responses to

the press," said Per Schenck, life
and safety coordinator for Stan
ford Hospital.
Hospital officials, knowing
how the hospital will be relied
upon to accommodate injured
patients from the local area, have
structured their emergency plans
to account for the eventuality
that its buildings may not be
usable.
Provided that the earthquake
doesn't iiyure the mcyority of the
hospital staff, Schenck said he
feels confident that the emergen
cy department will be able to
handle a substantial influx of
injured people, because the hos
pital presently takes in hundreds
of emergency cases everyday.
Referring to the hospital's
abilities to handle an earth
quake, he said, "Its all up to
mother nature. But in the last
one, the hospital did very well.
The emergency department and
the fire department did an excel
lent job."
Back-up medical supplies are
also stored in a number of places
around campus, while contracts
with vendors in the area guaran
tee that the hospital will be
unconditionally supplied with
crucial supplies, such as water,
medicine and beds.
In addition, if the Hospital
should become too damaged, an
old hospital building in Palo Alto
has been prepared for conver
sion into a temporary replace
ment.
All medical staff members are
also currently being trained for
disasters. Though training has
been going on for years, new pro
grams emphasize awareness of
the adversities an earthquake
can create.
The hospital has also imple
mented a system where special
ists, from surgeons to psychia
trists, will be rotated to serve
patients on a 24-hour basis.
And to respond more quickly to
hazardous spills and leakages, the
Environmental Health and Safety
office has formalized its own
emergency team that will respond

to hazardous spills and releases in
the event of an earthquake.
The unit would aid individuals
who have been injured in or
exposed to chemical, radiological or
biological spills and releases.
"We have come together since

the '89 earthquake," said Gary
Schell, a safety engineer. "The best
has been our ongoing training and
educating of people. We have been
getting people to recognize the dan
gers in labs and offices with haz
ardous chemicals."


April Pearson — Daily file
Two years ago, students conducted earthquake drills as part of
earthquake preparedness procedures. Now, four years after the
temblor, such precautions have fallen by the wayside and officials
are concerned about a lack of earthquake education on campus.
A tremendous earthquake
rocks the Stanford campus. Stu
dents trickle out of buildings —
some injured, some dazed.
Their first step would be to
head for the nearest designated
assembly point. One person
would become a group leader and
assign a few of the fittest people
to become runners for relaying
information. Others would act as
a temporary first aid squad until
help arrives.
A third group is assigned to
digging up one of the 12 subter
ranean vats scattered strategical
