## Cardinal takes half off as Wildcats prowl, 94-80 Unlucky 'blackjack' dealt 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Stanford men's basketball players no longer have
enough fingers and toes to count their losses this season.
With the Cardinal's 94-80 loss to Arizona Sunday
afternoon, the team achieved the dubious distinction of
most losses in a single Stanford season with 21.
"I don't have any thoughts on it," snapped Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery during the post-game
press conference. "I didn't think about it.... It's not a
record because with the trip to Hawaii we played 30
games."
For those who may have lost track of the 15 teams
that have beaten Stanford (7-21, 2-14 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) during the 1992-93 campaign, they are: San Jose
State, Virginia, LSU, DePaul, Chaminade, Ohio, Oregon
State, Notre Dame, California (twice), UCLA (twice),
USC, Washington State (twice), Washington (twice), Ari
zona (twice) and Arizona State (twice).
The old Cardinal mark for most losses in a season had
occurred on three previous occasions — 1970, 1971 and
1982. With the rough Oregon road trip closing out the
campaign this weekend, the 1992-93 club may very well
put the mark out of reach.
Tomorrow night's game against Oregon (9-19, 2-14)
is also the battle for last place in the Pac-10.
Ironically, the team's 21st loss came on the same day
that Cardinal faithful came out to honor departing
seniors Marcus Lollie, Peter Dukes and Kenny Hicks —
all of whom had experienced postseason play every other
year of their Stanford careers, including a National Invi
tational Tournament championship two years ago.
"There's been a lot of things that have gone wrong
this year, but I don't worry about it," Dukes said. "I have
had four other years that have been great.
"This year has been a great year, too. Not in terms of
wins and losses, but in terms of the association with the
guys on the team," he added.
Stanford performances have varied dramatically this
season, and, despite the 14-point loss, Sunday's game
was one of the team's best.
Shooting 62 percent from the floor in the first half,
the Cardinal actually went into the locker room with a
one-point lead over the third-ranked Wildcats.
"I have to give Mike and his group a tremendous
amount of credit for coming out and showing me they
have determination," said Arizona coach Lute Olson.
"They played unbelievably well in the first half and for a
number of minutes in the second half."
For Stanford's freshmen, the 21-loss season has, of
course, been a rough introduction to The Farm. But Dar
ren Allaway and Dion Cross have broken into the start
ing lineup and become msyor contributors, gaining valu
able experience for the future.
"I'm disappointed. But I can't just hang my head and
say I'm going to transfer," Allaway said. "Dion and
myself are happy here. We made the right choice to come
here. We are going to try to turn this program around."

This time, David didn't slay
Goliath, but at least he got in a few
good slings.
With an eye toward the future,
the Stanford men's basketball
team played inspired basketball
for a half before No. 3 Arizona
refocused the Cardinal's vision on
the present and pulled away for a
94-80 victory on Sunday after
noon.
Stanford (7-21, 2-14 Pacific
10 Conference), with Senior Day
as a backdrop, left a good taste in
the fans' mouths in the team's
home finale by holding its own
against the powerhouse Wildcats
(22-3, 15-1). However, the loss
etched this particular squad into
the Stanford basketball annals
as the losingest team in Cardinal
history. After suffering a 35-
point setback to Arizona a
month ago, a similar margin
never became a possibility this
time around.
The Cardinal capitalized on a
multitude of impressive individual
performances, enabling the last
place club to compete with this
year's conference champions.
Brent Williams — who finished
with 21 points — and Dion Cross
who tallied 18 — both had 14
points before intermission, while
Marcus Lollie handed out seven of

his nine assists in that span.
Williams also shut down Pac-10
Player-of-the-Year candidate
Chris Mills, limiting the Wildcat
star to only four first-half points.
"We saw what could be and
what should be in the future,
today," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "We had better
effort and concentration. Brent
played well and played good
defense, Dion made some nice
plays and Marcus ran the club
well."
Though the Cardinal had twice
as many fouls as the Wildcats, and
Arizona went to the foul line 15
more times than did Stanford in
the half, Stanford managed to stay
in the thick of things by shooting
an outstanding 62.1 percent from
the field in the opening period and
matching the Wildcats basket for
basket.
Stanford trailed by no more
than six points before the break,
and continually battled to keep the
game close. Trying to inject sweet
ness into what had been a bitter
previous two weeks, the Cardinal
capped off its first-half exploits
with Lollie hitting a shot in the
lane at the buzzer allowing Stan
ford to head into the locker room
up 45-44.
"We were ecstatic," said for
ward Darren Allaway. "I don't

Jim Morgan can't bear to watch as Arizona's Chris Mills puts up a close-range shot.
The Cardinal let a 45-44 halftime advantage slip away as the third-ranked Wildcats
earned a 14-point victory Sunday at Maples Pavilion.
