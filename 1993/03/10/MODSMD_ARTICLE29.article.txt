# Women come out armed, ready, annihilate Arizona 79-60
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball squad
delivered a first-half knockout to the Ari
zona Wildcats Saturday night, thanks to the
offensive punch provided by superstar
seniors Molly Goodenbour and Val Whiting.
With a crushing 79-60 victory at the
McKale Center in Tucson, Ariz., the Cardinal
(23-5, 13-3 Pacific 10 Conference) remained
tied with USC for first place in the Pac-10.
Goodenbour's shooting posed serious
problems for the Wildcat defense, as she
burned Arizona time and time again from
the perimeter. The senior point guard
opened the game by sinking consecutive
treys, giving the Cardinal a comfortable lead
from the outset, and went on to score 16
first-period points.
"Molly started out real well," said Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer. "That helped
her confidence and her shooting."

The All-American Whiting was unstop
pable from anywhere on the court. Her
game-high 23 points were especially signifi
cant, pushing her career scoring total to
2,001 points, breaking the previous Pac-10
career scoring record of 1,996 held by USC's
Cherie Nelson.
"It says a lot about what a great player
[Val] is, to be the conference leader in scor
ing and rebounding," VanDerveer said.
Whiting, who set the conference mark
for career rebounding earlier this season,
exhibited modesty about her recent accom
plishment.
"It (the record) feels good, but it'd feel
better if we won the Pac-10 championship
and won another national championship
this year," Whiting said after the game.
Whiting stands just 37 points away from
tying the Cardinal all-time mark in scoring
held by Jeane Ruark Hoff, who played from
1978-83, prior to Stanford's entrance into
the Pac-10.

Goodenbour helped Stanford pad its six
point advantage before halftime, as her
squad embarked on a 16-4 scoring run with
less than five minutes remaining. After
dishing out a well-placed pass to Whiting for
an easy two points, Goodenbour stormed
past her defenders on the next possession,
converting a layup while getting fouled for a
three-point play.
However, Goodenbour's biggest contri
bution came with less than three ticks
remaining on the clock. Arizona inbounded
the ball under the Stanford basket to point
guard Keisha Anderson, who was immedi
ately called for a traveling violation under
the strong pressure defense of Goodenbour.
The Cardinal point guard then finished her
extraordinary first-period performance by
swishing a jumper at the buzzer.
"It was a real heads-up play by Molly,"
VanDerveer said.
Sophomore Anita Kaplan dealt some
blows of her own to the Wildcat defense.

The 6-foot-5 center racked up 14 of her 18
points in the second half, adding more
ammunition to the Stanford attack.
"Val and Anita played together really
well," VanDerveer said. "They (Arizona)

couldn't stop the inside game."
Closing out its regular season with two
contests at home this weekend against Ore
gon and Oregon State, Stanford hopes to keep
things rolling smoothly for postseason play.
