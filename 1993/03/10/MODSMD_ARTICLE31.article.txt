### Kay Hong Staff writer 
Twelve in a row. That's how
many times the Stanford men's
swim team has successfully
defended its Pacific-10 Confer
ence title. When the waves finally
settled in Federal Way, Wash.,
last weekend, the Cardinal squad
had set five meet records, quali
fied most of its swimmers for the
upcoming NCAA Championships
and crushed its closest competi
tor, UCLA, by more than 200
points.
Other participating teams
were served early notice that this
meet was a competition for sec
ond place. A first-place finish by
the Cardinal 200-yard freestyle
relay squad and second and third
place finishes by Dan Kanner and
Mike Covert in the 1000 free
established a Stanford lead after
the meet's first two events.
Soon after, Trip Zedlitz's meet
record (1 minute, 45.50 seconds)
sparked a Cardinal attack on the
200 individual medley, as Zedlitz,
Chas Morton and Derek Weather
ford grabbed three of the top four
places in that event. Bill Schell's
strong performance in the 50 free
(19.93) and a victory by the Car

dinal 400 medley relay capped off
the first day of competition as
Stanford built up a comfortable
62-point lead.
The second day of competition
saw Stanford champions in all
events but one. Freshman Joe
Hudepohl's meet record in the
200 free (1:35.05) and Chas Mor
ton's successful defense of his 400
IM title (3:49.77) highlighted the
day's competition. Other event
winners included Tyler Mayfield
in the 100 breaststroke (54.33),
Derek Weatherford in the 100
backstroke (47.68) and the
record-setting 800 free relay
(6:24.98). Though ASU sopho
more Edvardo Piccinini swam off
with the 100 butterfly title, Car
dinal flyers Eddie Parenti (second
place) and Zedlitz (third place)
posted NCAA-qualifying times in
the event.
Third-day titles included indi
vidual wins from Weatherford in
the 200 back (1:43.78) and Kurt
Grote in the 200 breast (1:56.93).
Grote's breaststroke swim broke
the old meet record of 1:57.73 set
by ex-Cardinal John Moffet in
1985. The 400 free relay (2:54.10)
set yet another meet record as
