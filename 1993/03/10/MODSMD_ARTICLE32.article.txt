# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
It's spring. Sure, the calendar doesn't say
it, and winter-quarter finals still pose a real
threat to the Stanford student body. But as
far as the Cardinal athletic schedule is con
cerned, March Madness equals the changing
of the seasons, a time to rise to the challenge
of championship play.
Last weekend, Nick Bravin and Molly
Goodenbour, the Daily's Athletes of the

Week, took significant steps toward proving
that the fencing and basketball titles they
won in even years 1990 and 1992 can in fact
be an "odd thing" in 1993, their senior year.
Bravin, who hails from Los Angeles, post
ed a perfect 35-0 record against five oppo
nents in leading the Cardinal to the Western
Regional foil championship Sunday in Santa
Cruz, Calif. With the victory, Stanford
earned a berth in the NCAA Finals, where
Bravin and his teammates are expected to
take their third national crown in four years
later this month.
Ranked No. 1 in the NCAA, Bravin has
posted an 80-2 record on the 1992-93 cam
paign. However, his most outstanding
accomplishments may have come as a result
of time spent away from Stanford. Bravin
redshirted for the 1990-91 season in order to
train for the 1992 Olympics — a move that
paid off with a respectable 37th-place finish
in Barcelona.

Goodenbour, a point guard from Waterloo,
lowa, scored 28 points and dished out 15
assists as the Cardinal continued to perfect its
form in a sweep of Arizona State and Arizona.
Thursday in Tempe, Ariz., Goodenbour
shot a frigid l-for-9 from the field to go along
with a team-leading seven assists, but her
one make — a three-point basket at the
beginning of the second half — touched off a
14-6 Cardinal run that left the Sun Devils
behind for the remainder of the contest.

Saturday, Goodenbour hit her first three
treys — including two in the opening min
utes — to touch off an 18-point, eight-assist
performance in the Cardinal's rout of the
Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz. Her four three
pointers on the weekend left Goodenbour
with a total of 63 on the 1992-93 campaign,
just eight shy of Katy Steding's Stanford sea
son record of 71.
