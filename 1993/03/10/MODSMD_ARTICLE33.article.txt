# Goodenbour finds strength, points way for Cardinal
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Molly Goodenbour knows the
meaning of the word intensity.
Whenever she sets foot on the
basketball floor, the Cardinal
senior point guard displays a
uniquely fervent concentration.
"When she goes out on the
court, she gives it her all, in prac
tice and in games," said team
mate Angela Taylor. "She's a
very competitive player."
Indeed, ever since Goodenbour
arrived on Stanford grounds
three-and-a-half years ago, she
has impressed others with her
mental toughness, as she fought
her way up to the role of starting
point guard at the beginning of
last season. Goodenbour received
limited game time during her
freshman and sophomore years,
handling the not-so-glamorous
task of playing backup to Ail-
American guards Jennifer Azzi
and Sonja Henning.
"A lot of high school players
are afraid of situations like that,"
said Cardinal coach Tara Van-
Derveer about Goodenbour's
decision to attend Stanford,
despite the presence of the two
All-Americans. "She worked real
ly hard to get a starting position."
Upon earning that starting
spot, Goodenbour hasn't stopped
amazing fans with her inspired
performances.
The Waterloo, lowa native
averaged 12.3 points and 5.4
assists per game during last
year's campaign in leading Stan
ford to its second national cham
pionship in three years. Gooden
bour capped off an excellent post
season performance by being
named Final Four MVP.
To the delight of Stanford
faithful, Goodenbour hasn't
slowed down a bit this year, as
she continues to put up
respectable totals in the assist

and scoring categories. Quite a
difficult task, considering that
game in and game out, the oppo
sition makes a concerted effort to
shut down the preseason Ail-
American.
"This year she's not a surprise
to people," VanDerveer said.
"They're keying on her."
Nevertheless, Goodenbour

continues to burn the opposition
with her most deadly weapon —
the three-pointer. The 5-foot-6
sharpshooter has exhibited her
long-range accuracy many a time
this season with her best offen
sive production coming in a five
point loss to Tennessee. In that
contest, Goodenbour amassed a
career-high 31 points and became
one of only four NCAA players
this year to hit nine treys in one
game.
"I guess I've always had confi
dence in my shot," Goodenbour
said. "Once you make your first
couple of shots, it helps. The bas
ket keeps getting bigger. In the
Tennessee game, it was just a
matter of nothing else was work

ing, so I might as well shoot it."
Although all appears to be
going smoothly for Goodenbour
during her final year at Stanford,
the 1992-93 season didn't begin
on such a high note.
Goodenbour's father passed
away in late November, forcing
Molly to leave campus for 10 days
and miss an exhibition game

surprise to people.
They're keying on her.'

against the Belgian National
squad. After enduring such a
painful time in her life, Gooden
bour credits the support she
received from her team as one of
the primary influences on her
quick recovery.
"I had a lot of support from
out here. I never felt like, 'I'm
missing games or I'm missing
practices, they're going to be mad
or whatever.' The coaches and
everybody told me to take as
much time as I needed at home.
They were very understanding. I
think that helped me out a lot."
After such a trying emotional
ordeal, Goodenbour returned to
campus with the burden of
putting her father's death aside
and gearing up for a tough season
opener against No. 15 Texas
Tech. She responded brilliantly
to the challenge, raking in a then
career-high 23 points while guid
ing the Cardinal to an emotional
75-67 victory.
"I had spent however long I
was gone thinking about what
was going on at home, but when I
was back, I was ready to play
some basketball again," she said.
"A lot of times, I think basket

ball has been an outlet for me in a
lot of different ways. It's some
thing that's always there, and it's
constant, and you can always
come back to it. That's the way it
was this time."
VanDerveer expresses nothing
but admiration for her point
guard's gritty performance
against Texas Tech and for her
overall competitive attitude.
"I have a lot of respect for her
hard work and discipline," said
the eighth-year coach. "She's just
a tough kid. She's a fighter."
Molly's off-court behavior mir
rors her gameface in many ways.
"She has her goals set," Taylor
said. "She knows what she wants
to do to accomplish them. She
likes to go about things indepen
dently."
In fact, one of Goodenbour's
career goals is directly related to
basketball, as she hopes to con
tinue playing overseas for a few
years in a European league, upon
graduation from Stanford. Fortu
nately, Goodenbour's fast-break
ing style should help her fit right
in against foreign competition.
"She's really an international
player, the way she runs and
runs," VanDerveer said. "[The
European leagues] are very
offense-oriented. It's right up
Molly's alley."
But the future aside, Gooden
bour has spent most of her ener
gy focusing on her team's drive to
repeat as NCAA champions. With
the way Stanford has been play
ing lately, such a lofty goal is not
out of reach.
"It's getting toward the end of
the season and things are falling
into place," she said. "I think
we're in the position we want to
be in right now."
Hopefully, a month from now,
Goodenbour's intensity will have
put the Cardinal back in the win
ner's circle, a position it always
savors.
