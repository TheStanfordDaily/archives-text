# Fencers foil West foes
## 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff Writer 
The mark of a true champion is the
ability to peak at the right time, both
physically and psychologically. For the
Stanford men's and women's fencing
teams, that time came last weekend at
the NCAA Western Regional competition
at Santa Cruz, Calif.
"The team's performance was out
standing," said men's coach Zoran
Tulum. "When we entered the gym, we
took it over. It was like Roble Gym."
The Cardinal quite simply dominated
all of its competition, as both the men
and women took team titles. The women
crushed Cal State-Fullerton and Cal
State-Long Beach 15-1, UC-San Diego
and Air Force 13-3 and UC-Santa Cruz
12-4. The men had wins against UC-San
Diego and UC-Santa Cruz 20-7, Air
Force 15-12, Cal Tech 19-8 and Cal
State-Fullerton 22-5.
The women's foil team earned a berth
in the NCAA Tournament, to take place
March 27 through 29 at Wayne State
University in Detroit. The men's foil and
sabre teams also won their respective
titles, but only the foil squad is guaran
teed a trip to NCAAs.
"The sabre competition was really excit
ing," Tulum said. "Our first match was
with Cal Tech [who had defeated the Car
dinal earlier in the season] and we beat
them. We crushed everyone after that until
Air Force, who we came back to beat."

Although the sabre team won the
team title outright, the West Coast Advi
sory Commission (made up of West Coast
coaches) will recommend that Air Force
go on the strength of its schedule and
overall record. The decision will be made
next week by the National NCAA Fenc
ing Committee. Both Tulum and
women's coach Sherry Posthumus will
make a case for the team, which may be a
wild card at the tournament.
"The sabre team did a tremendous
job," Tulum said. "They had a lot of
opponents: the fencers, the officials and
the politics."
For all of the politicking endured by the
men's team, there was no doubt that the
Cardinal women were the class of the field.
Senior Lana Kang, in her last appear
ance at Regionals, earned a spot in the
NCAA tournament with a second-place
finish. She was also named Outstanding
Fencer for the third time by the coaches
and fencers of the region.
"Lana went out with flying colors,"
Posthumus said. "She is a person who
shows a lot of class on the strip."
Despite controversy on the team level,
Stanford men enjoyed success individual
ly. Led by two-time national champion
and Barcelona Olympian Nick Bravin,
who had a 35-0 tournament record in the
foil, the Cardinal placed five fencers in the
NCAA meet. Geoff Donaker will join
Bravin in the foil, while Jeremy Nelson
and Glenn Wong will compete in epee and
sabre, respectively.
