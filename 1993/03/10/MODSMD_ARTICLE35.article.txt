# Memoirs on mediocrity: a farewell
## 
### 
Just ae all good things come to an
end, thankfully so too do bad ones.
After this weekend, my journey
will be over. As a journalist, I will part
company with Stanford basketball.
Not that I don't like basketball or I
don't like the players on the team. On
the contrary, I 1 .love basketball, and
always will. And the guys on the team
are a great group and extremely fun to
be around. But it has been a struggle to
be enthused about continuously watch
ing a team lose.
Sure, I've kept my game face on and
constantly tried to stay positive. Yet
that hope could only last for so long
before reality set in.
Ever since stepping on the Stanford
campus, I longed to cover the Stanford
basketball team. I grew up, for better or
for worse, watching Pacific 10 Confer
ence hoops. I remember countless Sat
urdays spent watching Raycom tele
casts at 3 p.m. with Barry Tompkins
live from the Pit, the Dawg house,
McKale Center and Harmon Gym. This
year was my chance to see those places,
and watch the Cardinal send the home
fans away sad.
Instead, I was usually alone in my
sadness at game's end. Of course when
getting on the bus, a roster of 12 and a
coaching staff of four were not in the
best of spirits, either. But they could
freely express their frustration. My job
was to ask them to do it.
And I would not get a welcome
response when I went in the locker
room, because they knew I would be

touching on a subject that they'd just as
soon forget. They grew tired of saying
the same things, and I grew tired of
writing them.
I was cautiously optimistic about the
Cardinal squad's chances at the begin
ning of the season. Though Adam Keefe
and Paul Garrett were gone, a good core
of players was back. Add that to a cou
ple of new freshmen and I thought
Stanford was a definite NIT ballclub,
maybe even good enough to sneak into
that fourth slot for the NCAAs.
But then the injuries began to hap
pen, guiding Stanford down a slippery
slope of increasing mediocrity. The only
crunch time that the Cardinal was to
have this season occurred in players'
bones, rather than the closing minutes
of ballgames.
I knew it was going to be a long year
when, after losing to Notre Dame by six
points, coach Mike Montgomery said,
"Notre Dame is a very average basket
ball team." So, I reasoned, what does
that make Stanford?
I was soon to find out. The Cardinal
went on to lose the next nine games as

well. The period between wins spanned
39 days, five cities and two government
holidays.
Players went down one after the
other, some returning, others not. After
Marcus Lollie bruised his shoulder a
few short weeks ago, Montgomery aptly
observed, "This just fits in right with
the season. It's been an ongoing soap
opera of things going wrong."
Indeed, the season was like an
episode of General Hospital gone bad.
And I kept watching, hoping for a doc
tor to save them.
When Stanford broke the string
against USC, it was a highlight. Not
only was it nice to have Stanford with
more numbers on its side of the score
board, but it prompted Trojan coach
George Raveling to deliver a lecture at
the postgame press conference longer
than a Bill Clinton speech. After being
asked whether the reason his team lost
was that his players were too tired, Rav
eling was not at a loss for words:
"I was happy as hell living in a gro
cery store in Washington, D.C., and
then I met up with all these goddamn
intellects — the press — and they
screwed my life up. It's the same thing
now with all of this stress out and all
that bullshit. This has screwed up our
whole society. How did we become a
great nation? Working short weeks and
stressing out — that's all B.S.
"I read a thing in the paper today
that said Clinton is going on four hours
