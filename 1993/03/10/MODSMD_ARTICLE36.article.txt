# Trojans overcome Cardinal after batters eke out two one-run wins
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
One weekend after being swept by Ari
zona in its Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division opener, the Cardinal
rebounded to take two of three from USC
at Dedeaux Field in Los Angeles.
"It's good that we won the games that
we did," said Stanford second baseman
Jed Hansen. "But we had a chance for a
sweep, and we didn't — that's kind of a
downer."
After defeating the Trojans in a pair of
one-run games on Friday and Saturday,
the Cardinal fell behind 11-0 in the final
match, eventually losing by an 11-3 score.
"Even though we won the first two
games, we were still focusing on the third
one," said first baseman Dusty Allen.
"That's the one most vivid in our memo
ir''
In the final contest, the Cardinal com
mitted five errors, two in the third
inning.
Down 3-0 entering the bottom of the
frame, Stanford lefty Dan Reed gave up a
single to leadoff man Walter Dawkins.
The next batter, J.P. Roberge, bounced a
possible double-play ball to shortstop.
Two throws later, Dawkins scored and
Roberge was on second, thanks to a pair
of Cardinal errors.
The Trojans scored six runs in the
inning, taking an insurmountable 9-0
lead in the process.
"Our overall team defense has been
shabby," said coach Mark Marquess.
"Our performance thus far has been a
surprise when you consider our defense."
"On Sunday, we hit the ball well, but

didn't play very good defense," Allen said.
"But on the whole, I thought we played
some really good games."
Indeed, the Cardinal continued to
make strides both from the mound and at
the plate in the series. Starters Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine both effec
tively shut down Trojan bats — each
picked up his fourth win and third com
plete game of the season.
"We've been getting great pitching
performances from those two all season,"
Marquess said. "They don't beat them
selves out there."
Adams, who improved to 4-0, scat
tered nine hits. The right-handed junior

only got into trouble in the seventh,
when he squandered run-scoring singles
to Gabe Alvarez and Casey BurrUl.
Burrill, who led the Six-Pac with a
.508 average going into the series, was 4-
for-10 against Stanford. Alvarez, slated
as the No. 1 freshman prospect in the
nation according to Baseball America,
collected eight hits and two homeruns in
the set.
But if Alvarez was impressive, Stan
ford freshman AJ. Hinch was equally as
effective. The catcher, the No. 2 prospect
in the country, raised his average to a
sparkling .382 with a six-hit performance
this weekend.
"He's probably our best hitter right
now," Marquess said.
Lorraine, who improved to 4-1, retired
the first nine hitters he faced, and 17 of
the first 19. An Alvarez homerun in the
ninth cut the USC deficit to 4-3, but Lor
raine induced consecutive groundouts
with Mike Collett on first base to end the
game.
Earlier in the contest, Allen picked up
the big hit for the Cardinal. With Stan
ford clinging to a 2-1 lead in the eighth,
the first baseman singled in two runs off
Trojan standout reliever Dan Hubbs.
Allen's .231 average is misleading, as
the sophomore has batted in 20 runs,
tying Hinch for the team lead.
"I think that as the No. 4 hitter, my
main goal is driving in runs," Allen said.
"This weekend, I made great strides in
my swing."

Despite losing its first three Six-
Pac games for the first time in
school history, the Cardinal is
right in the thick of a bizarre divi
