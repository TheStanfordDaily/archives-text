# Women netters barely get by Bears in 5-4 squeaker
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
The Big Match lived up to its billing as a true tennis
battle, and in the end it was Stanford who came out
alive.
The No. 1 Cardinal (14-0,5-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
survived its tightest dual match of the year on Satur
day at Stanford Tennis Stadium, narrowly defeating
the No. 6 California Golden Bears by a 5-4 score. Stan
ford took four out of six singles matches against the
Bears, then hung on to win the No. 2 doubles spot and
the match.
"This was good for us," said Cardinal coach Frank
Brennan. "It was a little wake-up call for us to take
every match seriously."
After Stanford's 8-1 win over the University of the
Pacific on Thursday, Brennan noted that his troops
might have come into Saturday's match "a little casu
al," but was pleased the team rose to the challenge.
"It was good for us to get a tough match," Brennan
said. "For once we played some meaningful doubles,
and we held on at No. 2 when we needed it."
Stanford's No. 1 player, Laxmi Poruri, notched the
first win of the day for the Cardinal, downing Berkeley
freshman Pam Nelson, 6-2, 7-6. Team captain Heather
Willens followed suit in the No. 2 position, posting a 6-
2, 6-4 win over Jennifer Poulos.
That's when things started going wrong for the
Cardinal. No. 3 Kim Shasby suffered her first dual
match loss of the year against Cal's Lisa Parks, 6-3, 6-
4, while junior Kristine Kurth also came up on the
short end of her No. 4 match against Veena Prabhakar,
6-3, 6-3.
Freshman Beth Berris' 6-2, 6-2 win over Cara Abe
returned Stanford to its winning ways in the No. 5
match. No. 6 Amy Chiminello tallied Stanford's fourth
and final singles win of the day, overcoming two set
points in the first set to beat Nicole Elliott, 7-6, 6-2.
"She was playing in a zone and making a lot of win
ners," Chiminello said. "I just had to get over the hump
and start returning them."
The Cardinal struggled uncharacteristically against
the Golden Bears in the doubles matches. California's

Nelson and Keirsten Alley outlasted the No. 1 team of
Poruri and Willens in two tightly contested sets, 7-5, 7-
6. The No. 3 tandem of Shasby and Chiminello lost to
Poulos and Prabhakar by the same close 7-5, 7-6 score.
The losses marked Stanford's first dual-match doubles
losses of the season.
Berris and Kurth, however, sealed the match for
Stanford at the No. 2 doubles position, topping Elliott
and Valerie Poulos by a 6-3, 6-2 score.
"They're scrappers," Brennan said. "They play
hard, they run balls down, they hit hard and they
always play good doubles. They're a good rival, and we
like to beat them."
Chiminello knew that the match would be one of the
toughest of the year for the Cardinal. "They all came
out yelling and slapping their legs, especially knowing
we won the national [team] championships," she said.
"That kind of thing makes us work harder and focus
on what we need to do."
Brennan expects an even tougher time when Stan
ford meets the Golden Bears in Berkeley on April 7.
"That match has taken on a bit more importance
now — they're going to build for us," Brennan said.
The Cardinal will take a two-week vacation before
resuming play against UC-Santa Barbara at Stanford
Tennis Stadium on March 22.
