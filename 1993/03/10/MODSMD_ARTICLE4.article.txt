# Help wanted: provost
## Nominations due by March 25 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Members of the recently named
search committee for a new
provost say they plan to conduct
an in-house search and fill the po
sition by May.
"We're looking primarily for
someone who can complement
[University President Gerhard
Casper] and work effectively with
him," said Education Prof.
Michael Kirst, the committee's
deputy chair. "Casper's external,
so we're looking internal. He's a
law professor, so we probably

won't look in the Law School."
The search is on a "very fast
track," Kirst added. "The Presi
dent's goal is to wrap this up in
May, and there would be some
overlap between [Interim Provost
Gerald Lieberman] and the new
person."
The committee is soliciting
nominations for the position,
which must be submitted to
Casper by March 25, said Kirst.
Casper — the committee's chair
— nine faculty members, a staff
member, an undergraduate and a
graduate student make up the com
mittee, which will meet weekly.
Kirst said the committee plans to
choose a provost "who can restruc
ture the University."
With the recent down-sizing of
the University administration, he
said "there's some concern that
there's needs to be a balance
(between centralization and decen
tralization of the University)."
"The provost will have to review

the role 0f... decentralization," he
said.
Committee member Sharon
Long, a biology professor, said she
feels the ideal provost would be
"someone who is good at making
decisions, who has a sense of a fair
ness and is willing to listen to differ
ent sides of an issue, who is good at
management ... who understands
all aspects of education."
Education graduate student
Chris Golde, a committee member,
said she "would have liked to see
more students (on the committee),
but we'll do the best we can."
Lieberman took office April 16,

1992, after former Provost James
Rosse left to become president and
chief executive officer of Freedom
Newspapers, a Southern California
media chain. At the time, Lieberman
said he would serve up to 18 months.
Other members of the committee
include Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker, Business Prof. Edward
Lazaer, Civil Engineering Prof.
James Leckie, Geology Prof. Gail
Mahood, English Prof. Robert Pol
hemus, Medical School Prof. Edward
Shortliffe, Law Prof. Barton Thomp
son, Stephen Peeps, an associate vice
president in the Development Office,
and senior Beth Morgan.
