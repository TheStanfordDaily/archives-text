# Spikers sweep Gauchos
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
In a good, old-fashioned paddling, the No.
4 Stanford men's volleyball spanked the No.
7 UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos 15-8,15-8,15-
9 last Saturday night at Burnhan Pavilion.
"They were perhaps the easiest serving
team in the history of the league," said Car
dinal swing hitter Bob Hillman "Basically,
they were serving like stiffs. Me not getting
into passing trouble during a match is like
hell freezing over."
Stanford (8-3, 7-2 in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) started the match with
a surprising new look. Freshman Mike Lam
bert started at swing hitter instead of senior
Ryan Moos.
"The key man in this substitution work
ing was Ryan Moos," said Cardinal coach
Ruben Nieves. "A lot of athletes would have
made a big fuss and hung their heads, but
Ryan was the exact opposite."
According to Nieves, Lambert is the sec
ond best hitter on the team, but his passing
ability was unproven going into his first
start as a swing hitter.
"Overall I was happy with my perfor
mance," said Lambert, who had 10 kills and
only one receiving error in the match. "I was
pretty happy with my passing."
Stanford also had other surprising per
formances. Sophomore middle blocker Brian
Garrett, known for his offense, led the team
with five blocks.
"I was moving well," Garrett said. "When
you can move well in a read blocking system,
you are able to catch some balls."
Conversely, senior middle blocker John
Hribar, known for his blocking ability, led
the team with a .750 hitting percentage,
nine digs and a career-high four aces.
The two Cardinal Ail-Americans, outside
hitter Dave Goss and setter Canyon Ceman,
had typically outstanding days. Goss collect
ed 20 kills and hit .419; Ceman, with 51
assists, was repeatedly credited with dis
tributing the bail well.
"Canyon's sets were right on the money,"
Hribar said.

The Gauchos started the first game
strongly, going ahead 4-0. But a Goss kill
inspired a Cardinal run to tie the score at 5-
5. Led by Jason Mount and Hector Lopez,
UCSB kept pace with Stanford, but eventu
ally fell back and lost 15-8.
In the second game, the Cardinal kept
right on pounding through the flimsy Gau
cho defense and took a commanding 9-1
lead. Then UCSB coach Ken Preston began
a string of substitutions in which 10 players
saw action in the second game.
"You gotta find something," he said. "We
didn't fight for a game and a half with the
lineup I came into the match with."
This new lineup sparked the Gauchos to a
five point run, but spikes by Hillman, Goss
and Hribar held UCSB at bay, 15-8.
The third game was a prolonged fight
against the inevitable for UCSB. Losing for
most of the game, the Gauchos were able to
sideout, but not score points as the Cardinal
slowly extracted a 15-9 win.
The Gauchos' leaders were freshman out
side hitter Amauiy Velasco with 13 kills and
swing hitter Hector Lopez with 6 blocks. But
as a team they had only 10 digs (compared to
Stanford's 29) and eight receiving errors.
Stanford hit .454 as a team against UCSB's
leaky defense.
Over the next three weeks, the Cardinal
has matches that will heavily impact their
postseason plans. The series will begin at
Pauley Pavilion, where Stanford will con
tinue its fierce rivalry with No. 2 UCLA.
