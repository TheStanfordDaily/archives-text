# Women swimmers seek NCAA repeat
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The preliminary count for automatic NCAA
qualifiers are as follows: No.l Florida with 8,
No. 2 Stanford with 16 and No. 3 Texas with 7.
Judging from that alone, Stanford's women
swimmers have a clear advantage going into the
NCAA Championships at Minneapolis next
week, March 18 to 20.
The schools will have to wait until Thurs
day before a final tally can be made, however.
This is when official invitations for swimmers
with NCAA-consideration times will be sent
out. Stanford is hoping that senior Eva
Mortensen will receive an invitation for the
400-yard individual medley after missing the
cut by 0.01 seconds. That will give the Cardinal
a lineup of 17, the maximum number of swim
mers allowed to compete in the champi
onships.
As of today, the final estimates for Florida
and Texas are 13 and 12 swimmers respectively,

giving Stanford a comfortable margin.
However, coach Richard Quick said the num
ber of swimmers each school qualifies is of sec
ondary importance to the number of events
each swimmer will swim.
"All of our swimmers are entered in at least
two individual events, and most are swimming
the maximum of three," assistant coach Ross
Gerry said. "Florida and Texas might have sev
eral swimmers in only one event each. That
means we have the upper hand in number of
events as well."
Another advantage for the Cardinal squad
could be its strength in relay events, which are
worth more team points than individual events.
Stanford holds the American record and is also
the defending national-champion in four-out-of
five NCAA relay events.
Quick is very wary of these pre-meet esti
mates, however. "Our main competitor is, as
always, our own performances. If we perform
real well, the winning and losing should take
care of itself. I have a feeling that we have a good

chance at taking it all, but we can't ever control
what the other team will do."
Co-captains Janel Jorgensen and Anne
Mahoney are also very cautious when talking
about the advantages Stanford has on paper.
"We have to go in just as hungry as last year
and forget that we're defending champions,"
Mahoney said. "You can't let yourself become
complacent, especially after the great season we
had last year."
Stanford also hopes to qualify last year's
NCAA Diver of the Year, Eileen Richetelli, at
this weekend's qualifying rounds held at Ari
zona State. Diving coach Rick Schavone believes
that she will qualify in all three diving competi
tions: the platform, the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboards.
"Eileen's physically better than she has ever
been at this point,' Schavone said. "The only
thing we can't estimate is her meet toughness,
because she missed half the season due to
injuries. Performance-wise we don't know, but
ability-wise she's ready to win it all."
