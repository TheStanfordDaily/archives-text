# Gymnasts catch Cougars, bested by Bears

Those sneaky Golden Bears.
While the Stanford men's gym
nastics team focused on beating
conference powerhouse Brigham
Young in last weekend's UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational, Cali
fornia managed to slip in and
outscore both teams.
Cal narrowly defeated the Car
dinal 280.50-280.20, while BYU
finished a distant third out of
eight teams with 275.35.
Although Stanford fell short of
its target score of 283, it did fulfill
its other team goal of completing
the night with a total of less than
nine misses.
"We went into this competition
hoping for more consistency," said
coach Sadao Hamada. "We ended
up with only eight misses — that
tells me that if the guys are care
ful, they are able to hit their rou
tines, which is very encouraging."
While the scoring was generally
lower than in past meets, Cardinal
gymnasts managed to capture

first-place finishes in three of the
six events.
"The meet was good in that we
aimed to reduce our misses and we
only ended up with eight," said
senior co-captain Jair Lynch. "On
the other hand, we didn't pick up
the pace to beat Cal, so numbers
wise we lost — but I think in our
own minds, we did well."
Lynch secured the top spot in
the all-around competition with
57.30, raising his average all
around score of 56.43 and guaran
teeing a boost in his No. 5 nation
al ranking.
Lynch also dominated the com
petition on the vault and parallel
bars, while sophomore Josh
Stein's floor routine also merited
top honors.
Although Lynch's performance
did much to augment Stanford's
score, both Cal and BYU were also
well-represented in the all-around
competition. Cal's Marc Feingold
and BYU's Darren Elg managed
to edge out Stein, junior Mark
Booth and senior Jeff Bender,
Stanford's other three all-around

contenders.
"Our main problem was that
when we hit the sets, we didn't hit
them 100 percent," Booth said.
"That's the difference between a
9.60 and a 9.30 — the spark just
wasn't there."
Part of the reason the Cardinal
team score fell short of this week's
scoring goal, according to Hama
da, is the absence of key all
around competitor sophomore
Jing-Wei Liang. Recovering from
a sprained ankle, Liang should be
ready to return to action in time
for Stanford's next meet at San
Jose on March 20.
This will be the squad's last reg
ular season meet before the MPSF
Championships, which will take
place March 26 and 27 at UCLA.
The gymnasts plan to use the dual
meet as a final testing ground to
perform their routines exactly as
they will in the conference champi
onships and the NCAAs.
"[The MPSF meet] will have
some of the top teams in the coun
try," Lynch said. "It is a great
warmup for regionals and NCAA

finals."
Aiming for a team total of 285
in the championships, Hamada
believes this will be enough to
secure a Cardinal victory in the
meet. This goal, however, is depen
dent on the strength of Stanford's
vaulting and ring performances,
two of the team's weak areas.
To improve the squad's scores
on these two events, Hamada
plans to insert junior Chris Sey
and freshman Andrew Manson
into the lineup, both of whom
have been out of action this season
with injuries. Hamada hopes their
activation, together with the
return of Liang, will provide the
extra points needed to boost the
team score to new heights.
Despite this weekend's defeat,
the team maintains a positive out
look on the rest of the season.
"I think that we all realize,
now, that the postseason is com
ing very quickly," Lynch said. "We
are really going to bear down and
raise everything a notch by
increasing our consistency and
polishing our performances."
