# Best score not enough for gymnasts
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
Is it possible to come out of three straight
losses with your head up and a smile on your
face? Maybe not for the Buffalo Bills, but it's no
problem for the Stanford women's gymnastics
team.
Despite losing its third consecutive Pacific
-10 Conference meet on Friday 193.50-191.85
to the No. 7 Arizona State Sun Devils, the Car
dinal (5-6 overall) had by far its best nark of
the season, besting the 190.85 it scored Feb. 19
against Washington.
The showdown with the Sun Devils (8-1)
was Stanford's last tuneup before the Pacific
-10 Conference Championships, to be held Fri
day in Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.
With its performance, the 23rd-ranked Car
dinal transformed itself from a talented but
underachieving squad to a talented and emi
nently capable one with legitimate aspirations
for high conference and national rankings.
"We're exactly where we want to be," junior
Mollie Brown said.
The Cardinal is accustomed to late-season
surges. This season's weekly progressions in
performance have paralleled 1992'5, and this
year's scores have been almost a point better on
the average than last year's.
But the Pac-10 is not easily impressed.
California is the only one of the seven con
ference teams not ranked higher than the Car
dinal. No. 4 Oregon State, No. 5 UCLA, No. 6
Arizona, No. 14 Washington, and Arizona
State have all scored higher than Stanford's
1993 season best, 191.85.

With so much talent in the Pac-10, is there a
single favorite?
"UCLA," Greenwood said. "They beat Ari
zona in Arizona last week. They're peaking
right now." He added that any of four teams —
Oregon State, Arizona State, Arizona, or Stan
ford — could be second.
The Cardinal gymnasts believe that they
belong in that group, even though all three of
those teams defeated the Cardinal this year.
For them, Friday's meet served to announce
that Stanford should not be taken lightly.
"We're not ranked very high, but we haven't
peaked yet," Brown said.
Against ASU, Stanford had season-high
marks in its first three events — vault, bars,
and beam — and all-time bests in the latter
two. Über-freshman Hillary Anderson once
again led the way for the Cardinal with a meet
high 38.80 all-around score, but on Friday, her
teammates provided the kind of excellent and
consistent support that had been lacking for
much of the year.
Linda Chun took third in the all-around
with a 36.90, and sophomores Meegan Lannin,
Katie Clancy, and Jen& Elzie all kicked in solid
three-event performances.
The centerpiece of the Cardinal's meet,
according to the athletes, was the team's sea
son-high vaulting score. For the first time this
year, all six Stanford vaulters successfully
landed their vaults.
"It was everybody's best vault of the year,
even if the scores didn't show it," sophomore
Jenny Ward said.
While the Cardinal's 47.10 on the apparatus
was the best of the year, it is still far below

what Stanford's Pac-10 competitors score. Ari
zona State, for example, had a 48.45 in the
event, an unexceptional mark for the top con
ference teams.
"We didn't care about the scores," Elzie
added, "we just wanted to hit."
"If we can score 48.00 on vault, we're one of
the best teams in the country," Greenwood
added.
The beam performance needed no dis
claimers. Greenwood attributed the record
tying 48.15 to the team's increased depth in the
event.
"The depth thing is really good; we're not
used to it"he said. "Before, if you were healthy,
you were in the lineup." In contrast, sopho
more Laurie West scored a 9.60 on Friday, and
it was only an exhibition routine.
The intrateam uneven bars competition is
even stifier. Against ASU, Stanford counted no
score lower than 9.55, and the two exhibition
performers did routines of comparable quality.
"There are a bunch of us fighting to get into
the bar lineup," Brown said.
According to Greenwood, that can only help
the team.
"[Having eight competitors] has given us
more depth," he said, adding that the fifth and
sixth gymnasts have to improve or lose their
lineup slots.
Despite the loss to Arizona State, Friday's
performance was a real confidence-booster for
the team.
"We're in range," Ward said. "They're not
unbeatable."
The Cardinal will find out whether that's
true or not Friday night.
