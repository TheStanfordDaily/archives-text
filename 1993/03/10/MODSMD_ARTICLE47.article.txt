# Students to discuss Korean issues
## 
### Urmimala Sarkar 
While many students will hit the
beaches or mountains this spring
break, about 30 undergrade will be
discussing Korean-American stu
dent issues at a national conference
co-planned by a dozen Stanford stu
dents.
The Korean-American Students
Conference, a newly-formed Stan
ford student organization, is co
hosting the seventh annual Korean
American Students Conference,
KASCON VII, at the San Francisco
Airport Hyatt from March 25-28,
along with groups from UC-Berke
ley and Davis.
Approximately 1,200 students
from more than 175 North Ameri
can universities are expected to
attend, making this the largest eth
nic student conference in the
nation.
Stanford students have played a

vital role in handling the public
relations and financial planning of
the conference, according to sopho
more Lisa Lee, one of the confer
ence's three co-chairs. Twelve
Stanford students are on various
planning committees with Berkeley
and Davis students.
She expects 20-30 Stanford stu
dents to attend, but she adds that
renewed efforts are being made to
reach the University community
now that the conference is nearly
finalized.
In order to keep the registration
costs reasonable for students, the
Stanford finance committee was
charged with the large task of find
ing sponsors for the conference,
which has a budget of over
$150,000. Lee and the other stu
dents have recruited corporate
sponsors such as AT&T, Apple
Computer and Korean Airlines.
This year's theme is "A Stepping

Stone for Action: Establishing a
Korean American Agenda."
Keynote speakers include Angela
Oh, a Korean-American activist
who gained attention in the after
math of the Los Angeles riots, and
Congressman Robert T. Matsui.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson has also
been invited to speak about race
relations, but he has yet to confirm.
Lee says the the conference is
"nonpolitical", hoping to foster
activism "without a specific political
agenda."
KASCON VTI "wants to provide
a forum to address issues in a mul
ticultural society, including racial
tensions," she said.
Lee adds that although Stan
ford's KASCON formed to co-ordi
nate this national conference, the
organizers at all three host schools
hope to maintain a permanent
regional network as a forum for dis
cussing Korean-American issues.
