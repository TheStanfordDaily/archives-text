# Two Cardinal grapplers gun for NCAA glory
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Most Stanford students only need to
worry about chemistry and economics
exams next week. But for junior Lance
Johnson and freshman Jimmy Aguirre,
finals week also includes the NCAA
Wrestling Championships, which will take
place March 18-20 at lowa State.
The two Cardinal grapplers secured
berths in the tournament with their per
formances in the Pacific 10 Champi
onships. Aguirre captured the 134-pound
division crown, and also won the Out

standing Wrestler Award for the tourna
ment. Johnson received a wildcard slot by
finishing fourth in the 142-pound catego
ry. Pac-10 coaches select only eight of the
20 fourth and fiflth-place winners from
the 10 weight classes as wildcards for
NCAAs.
Thirty-two wrestlers will compete in
each weight division, with wildcards
expanding the brackets. The top eight fin
ishers from each category will be Ail-
Americans. Head coach Chris Horpel
expects Aguirre to be seeded in the top
eight, while Johnson may not be seeded.
Nonetheless, Johnson will enter as a

solid veteran, having qualified last year for
the national championships. Aguirre, how
ever, will experience his first NCAA tour
nament.
"It's a big spectacle that may be diffi
cult for newcomers," Horpel said. "At
home, we're used to having a crowd of 100
to 500 people. At Pac-lOs, there were
about a thousand. At NCAAs, there's
going to be about 13,000 to 14,000 people.
It's an event that fills two Maples Pavil
ions."
Unlike on the West Coast, Horpel
noted, wrestling is a big sport in the Mid
west, Mideast and East Coast.

The noise and intensity of fans will also
make coaching difficult.
"It can get so loud that there's no way I
can coach from the edge of the mat,"
explained Horpel.
Aguirre expressed some anxiety over
these circumstances. However, his ner
vousness in regard to the setting has not
affected his confidence in his ability.
"I'm not planning to lose," Aguirre said.
"I think [Johnson and I] have a very good
chance at placing in the top eight. It's just
one tournament. All you have to do is do
well in it. Anyone who qualifies has a
chance to win."
