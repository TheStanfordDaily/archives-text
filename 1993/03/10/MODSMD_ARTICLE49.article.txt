# Men's tennis gets double vision, falls short in La Jolla
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
The men's tennis team got
exactly what it wanted in La Jolla,
Calif, last weekend — doubles,
doubles and more doubles.
Although none of the Cardinal
men reached the finals of the
Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment, three of the four teams
reached at least the quarterfinals,
gaining much-needed time on the
court.
"It's always nice to make it to
the finals, but what a few of the
guys learned about doubles was

more important than winning the
tournament," said assistant coach
John Whitlinger.
Leading the Cardinal were sec
ond-seeded juniors Michael
Flanagan and Chris Cocotos, who
paired up to win three matches
before losing in the semifinals, 3-
6, 6-3,6-4, to a dynamic USC duo,
Wayne Black and Kent Seton.
"Overall, [Flanagan and Coco
tos] played pretty well,"
Whitlinger said. "They learned a
lot — there were things that
we've been telling them to do and
they tried them (this weekend)
and they worked."

The main doubles emphasis
over the last few weeks has been
shot selection — not always slam
ming the ball for quick winners,
but trying to play intelligently
and place the ball strategically.
The Trojan doubles teams
plagued the Cardinal, hindering
Stanford's success throughout
the tournament. Before defeating
Stanford's top doubles team,
Black and Seton knocked off
junior Billy Wright and senior
captain Roman Sydorak, 6-1, 6-1,
in the quarterfinals.
Saturday morning, Trojans
Lukas Hovorka and Adam Peter

son blanked Stanford's Robert
Devens and Vimal Patel, 6-0, 6-0,
in the third round. "They just
weren't ready to play," Whitlinger
stated. *
The only Cardinal pair not to
be eliminated by the Trojans was
Ricky Becker and Jeff Salzen
stein. The freshmen lost in the
quarterfinals to the University of
San Diego's Kevin Bradley and
Ignacio Martinez, 6-1,6-1.
Next on the Cardinal agenda
are three home matches over
spring break against Brigham
Young, Arizona State and Ari
zona.
