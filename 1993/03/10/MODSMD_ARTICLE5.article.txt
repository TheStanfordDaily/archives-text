The American Studies theme house will get im
proved disability access and added living space
when it relocates to Murray House next year, but
some current residents are concerned about leav
ing the Row.
"I know I wouldn't have lived here ... if it was
way out in Governor's Corner," said theme associ
ate Michelle Mello. "I don't agree with the deci
sion."
But incoming Resident Fellows Wanda and
Joseph Corn anticipate a successful year, despite
the out-of-the-way location. Joseph Corn, a senior

lecturer in the History Department, acknowledged
that students are worried about the move, but said
he doesn't think it will cause problems.
"I just can't believe Stanford students with their
facility on bikes and rollerblades won't get them
selves to and fro," Corn said.
Next year is the ideal time for the relocation be
cause the current RFs in both Murray and Ameri
can Studies are resigning, said Alice Supton, direc
tor of Residential Education. The house at 566
Mayfield will become a self-op, she added.
Larger RF facilities and room for 10 more resi
dents were two of the reasons Murray was chosen,
Supton said.
But most important was the
access issue: Students with dis
abilities will be able to live in the
Governor's Corner residence, she
said. While Murray has first-floor
disabled access, the current
American Studies house has no
wheelchair-accessible rooms on
the first floor.
The move to Murray is a "com
promise," according to John

Asheim, program coordinator for
the Disability Resource Center.
"Ideally, I'd like the existing
theme houses made entirely
accessible," he said, but adding
elevators is "seen as ridiculously
expensive."
Relocating the house is "a
great start," he continued. But he
said he interprets the 1991 Amer
icans with Disabilities Act as
requiring full access in the house.
"It always could be better," he
added.
Student Housing Operations
Director Rodger Whitney said
that among the theme and focus

houses, EAST, Ujamaa, Okada
and Casa Zapata currently have
first-floor access.
In addition to providing dis
abled access, the extra space in
Murray will also help accommo
date the growing American Stud
ies program, which is the third
largest interdisciplinary program
at Stanford, Corn said.
But Mello cited programs with
other nearby theme houses as a
reason she wished the house
would stay put.
"It's nice to be a part of the
Row environment," she said. "It
just won't be the same."
