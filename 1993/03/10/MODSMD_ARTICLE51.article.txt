## Casper speaks about prejudice, judgement in MemChu

Quoting extensively from the Bible and Ger
man humanist Ulrich von Hutten, University
President Gerhard Casper advocated an end to
stereotyping in a Founders' Day speech Sunday.
Celebrating Leland Stanford's birthday,
Casper delivered an address entitled "Invec
tives" at Memorial Church. It was followed by a
procession to the Mausoleum, where Casper
again addressed a crowd of about 100.
"I should like to return to the subject matter
of my inaugural address," Casper said at the
beginning of his first speech, launching into a
discussion of Hutten's life and the humanist's
death from syphilis.
He also issued an apology. "Unfortunately, it
was too late when I discovered yesterday that
Jane Stanford would not have approved of my
being in the pulpit on Founders' Day," Casper
said.
Mrs. Stanford had wanted a minister to
speak in the church for the occasion. But Casper
defended himself by pointing out that he spends

"much, if not most of my time preaching."
Starting with Stanford's motto, "The wind of
freedom blows," Casper said that "rendering
judgment is a favorite activity at universities."
Though the saying came from Hutten's
"polemic against the cardinals, bishops, abbots,
et cetera assembled at the Diet of Worms,"
Casper pointed to it as a basis for dealing with
prejudice.
People should not make unfair judgements,
he concluded. He urged the audience not to
"classify people into friends and enemies," but
"to ask instead, 'What does he have to say?'
'Where is she wrong, where might she be
right?' "
Putting the Founders' Day celebration in per
spective, Casper spoke about the effect of
Leland Jr.'s death on his parents. Quoting
Leland Sr. , he said "I was thinking since I could
do no more for my boy I might do something for
other people's boys in Leland's name."
The Founders' Day procession started at 11
a.m. , ending with the opening of the Mau
soleum and a ceremony in memory of Jane and
Leland Stanford.
