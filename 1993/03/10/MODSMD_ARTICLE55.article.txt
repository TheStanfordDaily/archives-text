# Never do today what can be put off until tomorrow?
## Break-ins, extensions, all-nighters for procrastinators 
### Lesley Edwards Staff writer 
Late at night, after all the professors have gone
home, a figure dressed in black climbs through a win
dow in the English Department. But he isn't looking
to steal a computer or an exam question.
Instead "Aaron" is trying to deliver something —
his paper. And it's two days late.
Aaron, a senior English coterminal student, is a
chronic procrastinator. And his inability to face
papers has driven him to extremes — even crime.
As a freshman, Aaron made a Sunday night foray
into the English Department office in order to turn in
a Cultures, Ideas and Values paper. The essay had
been due Friday at 5 p.m., but when he stopped by the
office late that afternoon, he noticed his professor
hadn't been in to get the papers.
Ironically, he said he later discovered that the pro
fessor, perhaps a fellow procrastinator, didn't pick
them up until the following Wednesday.
Aaron is only one of hundreds of procrastinators at
Stanford, people willing to do almost anything to
avoid working ahead — or even being caught up.
Psychologists have come up with some theories
about chronic procrastinators. Although anxiety is
the primary cause of procrastination, not all procras
tinators are alike, said Sam Edwards Jr., coordinator
of the Anxiety and Stress Management Center at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Edwards described the following types of procrasti
nators, each associated with a unique form of anxiety:
• The risk-avoidance procrastinator: This person is
usually a perfectionist who fears being evaluated by
professors. By putting off an assignment, risk
avoiders delay the inevitable criticism of their work,
which they foresee coming in professors' evaluations.
• The just-can't-say-no procrastinator: An inability
to say no to social invitations causes these people to
put off their work. They aren't hedonistic. Instead,
they say yes to every invitation because they are
socially insecure and fear they will be judged harshly
if they say no.
• The pessimistic procrastinator: This person
greatly overestimates the magnitude of a task, think
ing it will take much longer to complete than it realis
tically should. But instead of working on high-priori
ty tasks, pessimists busy themselves with low-priori
ty, easy tasks.
In all likelihood, Aaron is a perfectionistic procras
tinator. He admits that he pulled an all-nighter to
write his very first CIV paper, a one- or two-page mis
sive.
And after his escapade in the English building,
Aaron was beyond the procrastination point of no
return. His Stanford career became one long string of

all-nighters, extensions and, at the worst, incom
pletes. He just recently dropped an incomplete left
over from his sophomore year.
Aaron blames his CIV professor for allowing him to
fall into this self-defeating behavior pattern. "It was
her fault. I hold her responsible. When I'm a profes
sor, no one is going to get an extension from me," he
said.
His first professor may have been lenient, but since
then, Aaron has acquired the skills to eke an exten
sion out of even the toughest professors. Those "who
have said 'No extensions period,' I've gotten exten
sions from. On principle, I just have to," he said.
Aaron said he has no special trick for getting exten
sions, but conceded that the ever-popular, "I could
turn my paper in on time, but it wouldn't be very
good. ..line usually works just fine.
Still, one can't help but wonder why people like
Aaron would rather drag out the pain of a paper as
long as possible, instead of putting themselves out of
their misery.
Edwards said anxiety isn't the only source of pro
crastination. Depression may also rob students of
their motivation to work. Symptoms of depression
such as fatigue, an inability to concentrate, and a feel
ing that academic work is meaningless will cause a
depressed student to avoid assignments, he explained.
However, this type of procrastination is usually
transitory. Once students recover from their depres
sion, they usually get back into work mode, Edwards
said.
Overconfidence is yet another cause of procrastina
tion, according to Edwards. Some students underesti
mate the amount of time it will take them to finish an
assignment and as a result, they habitually delay their
work and end up scrambling to get things done, he
explained.
"Mark," a sophomore, may fall into this category.
Mark turns in all of his papers either at the last
minute or late, frequently pulling all-nighters to fin
ish.
"I'll usually start at about 11 the night before (a
paper is due), and depending on the type of paper, I'll
stay up pretty late to get it done," Mark said.
Coincidentally, Mark once also crawled through an
English department window — on the second floor —
to turn in a CIV paper. Mark said he hasn't figured
out exactly why he perpetually procrastinates.
"I don't know if I'm lazy, or if I fool myself into
thinking that I'll get something done," he said.
Like Mark, most chronic procrastinators don't
understand their own behavior, Edwards said. They
are masters, however, at inventing ways of avoiding
assignments.
Some of the most popular "techniques" include
reading newspapers compulsively, playing computer

Rick Hernandez — Daily
games, visiting neighbors, taking long showers and
shopping.
Others techniques are more subtle because they
actually resemble studying. Library switching —
where a student makes it to the library with books in
tow, but proceeds to switch libraries once an hour —
is a form of hidden procrastination.
Once students fall into this work (or lack-of-work)
pattern, they seem helpless to escape it.
But Edwards insists there is hope. Once a chronic
procrastinator understands why and when he or she
is procrastinating, breaking the pattern is simply a
matter of targeting and eliminating the student's pro
crastination techniques in bite-sized pieces, he said.
The first step is to stop breaking into buildings.

sor, no one is going to get an extension from me," he
said.
His first professor may have been lenient, but since
then, Aaron has acquired the skills to eke an exten
sion out of even the toughest professors. Those "who
have said 'No extensions period,' I've gotten exten
sions from. On principle, I just have to," he said.
Aaron said he has no special trick for getting exten
sions, but conceded that the ever-popular, "I could
turn my paper in on time, but it wouldn't be very
good. ..line usually works just fine.
Still, one can't help but wonder why people like
Aaron would rather drag out the pain of a paper as
long as possible, instead of putting themselves out of
their misery.
Edwards said anxiety isn't the only source of pro
crastination. Depression may also rob students of
their motivation to work. Symptoms of depression
such as fatigue, an inability to concentrate, and a feel
ing that academic work is meaningless will cause a
depressed student to avoid assignments, he explained.
However, this type of procrastination is usually
transitory. Once students recover from their depres
sion, they usually get back into work mode, Edwards
said.
Overconfidence is yet another cause of procrastina
tion, according to Edwards. Some students underesti
mate the amount of time it will take them to finish an
assignment and as a result, they habitually delay their
work and end up scrambling to get things done, he
explained.
"Mark," a sophomore, may fall into this category.
Mark turns in all of his papers either at the last
minute or late, frequently pulling all-nighters to fin
ish.
"I'll usually start at about 11 the night before (a
paper is due), and depending on the type of paper, I'll
stay up pretty late to get it done," Mark said.
Coincidentally, Mark once also crawled through an
English department window — on the second floor —
to turn in a CIV paper. Mark said he hasn't figured
out exactly why he perpetually procrastinates.
"I don't know if I'm lazy, or if I fool myself into
thinking that I'll get something done," he said.
Like Mark, most chronic procrastinators don't
understand their own behavior, Edwards said. They
are masters, however, at inventing ways of avoiding
assignments.
Some of the most popular "techniques" include
reading newspapers compulsively, playing computer

games, visiting neighbors, taking long showers and
shopping.
Others techniques are more subtle because they
actually resemble studying. Library switching —
where a student makes it to the library with books in
tow, but proceeds to switch libraries once an hour —
is a form of hidden procrastination.
Once students fall into this work (or lack-of-work)
pattern, they seem helpless to escape it.
But Edwards insists there is hope. Once a chronic
procrastinator understands why and when he or she
is procrastinating, breaking the pattern is simply a
matter of targeting and eliminating the student's pro
crastination techniques in bite-sized pieces, he said.
The first step is to stop breaking into buildings.

Late at night, after all the professors have gone
home, a figure dressed in black climbs through a win
dow in the English Department. But he isn't looking
to steal a computer or an exam question.
Instead "Aaron" is trying to deliver something —
his paper. And it's two days late.
Aaron, a senior English coterminal student, is a
chronic procrastinator. And his inability to face
papers has driven him to extremes — even crime.
As a freshman, Aaron made a Sunday night foray
into the English Department office in order to turn in
a Cultures, Ideas and Values paper. The essay had
been due Friday at 5 p.m., but when he stopped by the
office late that afternoon, he noticed his professor
hadn't been in to get the papers.
Ironically, he said he later discovered that the pro
fessor, perhaps a fellow procrastinator, didn't pick
them up until the following Wednesday.
Aaron is only one of hundreds of procrastinators at
Stanford, people willing to do almost anything to
avoid working ahead — or even being caught up.
Psychologists have come up with some theories
about chronic procrastinators. Although anxiety is
the primary cause of procrastination, not all procras
tinators are alike, said Sam Edwards Jr., coordinator
of the Anxiety and Stress Management Center at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Edwards described the following types of procrasti
nators, each associated with a unique form of anxiety:
• The risk-avoidance procrastinator: This person is
usually a perfectionist who fears being evaluated by
professors. By putting off an assignment, risk
avoiders delay the inevitable criticism of their work,
which they foresee coming in professors' evaluations.
• The just-can't-say-no procrastinator: An inability
to say no to social invitations causes these people to
put off their work. They aren't hedonistic. Instead,
they say yes to every invitation because they are
socially insecure and fear they will be judged harshly
if they say no.
• The pessimistic procrastinator: This person
greatly overestimates the magnitude of a task, think
ing it will take much longer to complete than it realis
tically should. But instead of working on high-priori
ty tasks, pessimists busy themselves with low-priori
ty, easy tasks.
In all likelihood, Aaron is a perfectionistic procras
tinator. He admits that he pulled an all-nighter to
write his very first CIV paper, a one- or two-page mis
sive.
And after his escapade in the English building,
Aaron was beyond the procrastination point of no
return. His Stanford career became one long string of

all-nighters, extensions and, at the worst, incom
pletes. He just recently dropped an incomplete left
over from his sophomore year.
Aaron blames his CIV professor for allowing him to
fall into this self-defeating behavior pattern. "It was
her fault. I hold her responsible. When I'm a profes
sor, no one is going to get an extension from me," he
said.
His first professor may have been lenient, but since
then, Aaron has acquired the skills to eke an exten
sion out of even the toughest professors. Those "who
have said 'No extensions period,' I've gotten exten
sions from. On principle, I just have to," he said.
