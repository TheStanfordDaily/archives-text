# Three days ahead is late for Stanford's early birds

"Kate" doesn't climb through windows to turn in
late papers. In fact, she never turns in any assign
ment late. She never chases professors for exten
sions. A subscriber to the "work before play" philos
ophy, she typically finishes her papers three days
early.
While procrastinators abound at Stanford, the
anti-procrastinator is rare. But the behavior of both
breeds of students stems from the same emotion â€”
anxiety.
Just as anxiety causes some people to put things
off, it motivates others, like Kate, to get papers and
other assignments done ahead of time.
"I feel it takes me a long time to write papers. I
don't like feeling anxious, so I like to get [them] done
early," said Kate, a senior human biology m^jor.
Fear of being interrupted or delayed by some
unpredictable occurrence is precisely the kind of
anxiety that motivates students who "must get
things done yesterday," said Anxiety and Stress
Management Center coordinator Sam Edwards Jr.
"People who are driven to get things done ahead
of time often worry that something could go wrong
or that their allotted time for concentration will run
out," he explained.
"Leon," a senior history major, just can't stand to
have a paper hanging over his head. "I need to get it
done so I can go on with my life," he said.
He also belongs to the ranks of the anti-procras
tinators. His idea of late is turning a paper in three
days before it's due.
"When I tell my friends that I'm working on a
paper, their typical response is, 'Oh, is it due next
quarter?' " Leon said.
Another virtue of getting a head start, according
to Kate, is avoiding the pressure to write the perfect
paper in one draft.
Leon attributes his study pattern to the influence
of his first grade teacher. "Every Monday afternoon,
she would hand us our homework for the whole
week. I would go home and think, 'I could do this all
now, and play with my friends the rest of the
week,' " Leon explained.
At Stanford, however, this logic has backfired.
Even though he gets all of his assignments done
early, none of his friends do, so there's often no one
to play with him, he said.
The peace of mind Leon enjoys, however, may be
worth the price of occasional loneliness. After writ
ing a paper, he said, "I let it sit for a few days. Then
I revise it from a C to a Band turn it in."
