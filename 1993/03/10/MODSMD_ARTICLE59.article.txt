# I wanna die like JFK: angst lives
## 
### 
Sigh. Born in the '70s, born in the sub
urbs, born a Coke-sipping, Atari
playing, Bennetton-wearing, Ton-
Sur-Ton-envying, K-Tel-listening, TV-din
ner-eating advertiser's orgasm. Sigh.
Do you remember when your parents
wouldn't let you stay out all night and smoke
cigarettes with the school-yard rebels in black
jackets and Glam-rock Pleather™ boots?

Your parents called them
punks; you called them
friends. The truth was they
didn't like you or your par
ents. But they let you ride on
the backs of their motorcy
cles 'cause you knew how to

get lithium from the chem lab. And you heard
them play the Cure and the Smiths: "Oh the
rain falls hard on this humdrum town/This
town will drag you dow-ow-own."
It was now the '80s, angst was in. Angst:
deep existential pain in the absence of any
material causality. Angst: the type of suffer
ing where you'd rather spend money to see
"The Breakfast Club" eight times than do
something about your problems.
Do you remember when the captain of the
color guard dumped you in front of all your
friends leaving you dateless a week before the
prom, and you ran to your best friend's house
and listened to that really deep Simple Minds
song together and thought they were really
speaking to you? "Don't you forget about me/
Don't/ Don't/ Don't." Didn't anyone ever tell
you, Hallmark invented Mothers' Day?
It was all hype. The '80s were done with mir
rors. It was a big joke — acid wash and "Knight
Rider" should have tipped you off. David Has
selhofFs solo project, then Don Johnson's, then
Phillip Michael Thomas' C'mon. How
could you take any of that seriously?
Few people have been blister-packed by
"Brady Bunch" demographics — there are
other childhoods than that of current 20-
year-olds. But those childhoods weren't
mentioned on Depeche Mode liner notes, or

Pat Dote
Jim Haljun

sung about on Silver Eagle Records. Because
reality doesn't sell.
Cinammony Toasty Apple Jacks sell. Seri
ously. You remember the jingle; "A is for Apple,
Jis for Jacks ..." You remember the "Love
lioat" tune. You probably could recognize the
"Sanford And Son" song, and even hum along.
But do you remember themes to the Miami
Beach, Chicago or Detroit riots? Of course not

Riots aren't sponsored by
Budweiser, simulcast on
MTV or scored by John
Williams.
And what's more, the social
structures of economics and
community relations un-

derlying these riots are never touched in the
multi-media presentation of "After-School
Specials" made on the national level of prod
uct distribution for an entire generation.
The major labels can issue "We Are The
World" and sponsor Live-Aid. But do they
ever generate activity for an issue facing the
United States, or even produce music that's
more than a 90210 response to growing up?
Problems in Africa are safe, Brenda and
Dylan are safe. And only through the eco
nomics of mass-entertainment media can
something as real and complicated as famine
and something as shallow and vapid as 60-
minute love come together on the same path,
dedicated to distraction and placation.
Instead, the '80s force fed us a steady diet
of laugh tracks and music telling us when to
be scared, surprised or sad. Think about it,
"Gilligan's Island" had two songs: 1. the title
track. 2. the few-bar rifif ending in a minor
chord when Gilligan would trip through the
palms in reruns yelling "Skipper!! Skipper!!"
— signifying the beginning of another
timed-for-commercials life-crisis.
Entrenched in the '90s, everyone Smells
Like Teen Spirit. Not only have we been sold
the image, but like laboratory rats we keep
pushing the food bar, consuming media pel
lets in record quantities. ■
