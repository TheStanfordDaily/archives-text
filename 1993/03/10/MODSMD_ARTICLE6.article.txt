# Education dean tapped for undersecretary of education
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
President Clinton nominated
School of Education Dean Mar
shall Smith yesterday as undersec
retary of education, a policy and
budget position redesigned espe
cially for Smith.
"He's going to have a real op
portunity to put theory into prac
tice" in the Department of Educa
tion, said Education Prof. Kenji

Hakuta, who worked with Smith on Clinton's transi
tion team. "He will basically run the place."
Hakuta compared the position, which ranks
under Secretary Richard Riley and Deputy Secretary
Madeleine Kunin, to that of a university provost.
While Riley, the former governor of South Caroli
na, and Kunin, the former governor of Vermont, "are
very knowledgeable about politics, they don't know
the hundreds of programs," Hakuta said. "[Smith] is
the one who is going to know what the system looks
like."

The department has a $35 million budget and 220
programs administered by 5,200 employees.
A former department insider, Smith was chief of
staff and executive assistant to the secretary of edu
cation when the department was created in 1980. He
served as assistant commissioner for policy studies
in the U.S. Office of Education prior to that.
In December, Clinton named Smith to lead a task
force on kindergarten through 12th-grade education
that prepared a report for Riley and helped him se
lect sub-cabinet officials.
"I was amazed during the transition how many
people he knows in the department and [in Wash
ington]," Hakuta said.
He described Smith as being fairly moderate in his
plans. "He's not as pro-change as a lot of radicals
would like, [butj he changes things more than some
Republicans would like."
Smith was in Washington, D.C., yesterday and
could not be reached for comment.
Former President Ronald Reagan threatened to
dismantle the Department of Education and "sue-


Smith
ceeded in preventing it from ful
filling its potential," Hakuta
said.
Now Smith will have to help
revamp the department after
what a New York Times editorial
yesterday called "12 years of
neglect," Hakuta said, adding
that morale has been low in the

agency.
One of Smith's main priorities
is turping the federal government
into "a support system for local
and state innovation," Hakuta
said.
Access for poor and immi
grant students is important to
Smith, Hakuta said: "He's very
committed to equity. He sees
education as an equalizer of
opportunity."
Smith also knows a great deal
about federal legislation and has

"opportunities for really shaping
laws" under a Democratic
administration, Hakuta said.
Dean of the School of Educa
tion since 1986, Smith is on leave
this year. If confirmed as under
secretary, he plans to resign as
dean and take a leave of absence
from the faculty. Prof. Nel Nod
dings has agreed to continue as
acting dean through Aug. 31,
1994.
"He'll certainly be missed
here," Hakuta said.
