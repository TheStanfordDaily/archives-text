# on spine Southern writer doesn't comfort
## 
### 
Thank goodness you're not from the South
— unless, of course, you are from the
South, in which case we understand. You
don't know any better.
This has been the implicit motto of dozens
of recalcitrant white Southern writers who
have struggled in the post-Faulkner era to

achieve literary accep
tance ever since America
offered up the South as a
sacrificial lamb to atone

for our nations bigotry in the 19605.
In 1985, though, a refreshing alternative to the
incessant whining of Rat Conroy emerged, in the
voice of a bold young serio-comic writer named T.
R. Pearson. And what a voice: long, rambling sen
tences with the blustery beauty of a 40-piece brass
band playing Mozart
In a recent telephone interview from his
home in Virginia, Pearson described his major
influences (Twain for his voice, Conrad for his
explorations of morality) and the sources of his
stories (The tiny town of Reidsville, North Car
olina where his parents grew up).
These questions were just a smokescreen,
though, for this was no chatty, aimless, Oprah
esque interview. This was a heat-seeking, armor
piercing stealth interview with a mission.
You see, Pearson writes poignant first-per
son narratives which neither glorify nor sepa
rate themselves from their context — rural,
poor and Southern. He encourages as to sym
pathize with these characters and become a part
of their lives, even while good-naturedly laugh
ing at their failings and lapses of intellect.
Consequently, we cruise along at a comfort
able dip until a black or a Latino character en
ters the story. Then, suddenly, the laughter trails
off and we squirm in our easy chairs.
Always true to his persona, Pearson invari
ably presents these characters as maids, thieves
or deadbcats. Moreover, the poor white-trash
characters we've come to love express opinions
about them which are almost always ugly.
Without knowing what the author s "real"
views are, we must decide whether the book

Ted Quinn

we've been enjoying for the last 200 pages is an
insightful account of bigotry in our society, or
just a racist piece of crap.
Hence the mission of the interview: to lift the
mask of his persona and expose T. R. Pearson
himself, in order to comfortably label his work.
If successful, the spoils of this journalistic as-

sault would be invaluable;
easy answers and carte
blanche to laugh freely at
his humor without suffer-

ing pangs of guilt or intellectual uncertainty.
The spectacular failure of this mission made
the Bay of Pigs look like a walk in the park
The assault began with a flank attack. Why
doesn't he separate himself more from the views
of his characters? Pearsons response was corre
spondingly oblique:
"I get blamed for a lot of the opinions of the
characters in my books. The first rule of reading
fiction, particularly first-person narration, is
that the opinions of the narrator and the author
are not necessarily the same thing."
The "necessarily" seemed to be a sign of
weakness, and so a frontal assault seemed in
order. Surely he must be tempted to subtilcly
signal his distaste for the views of his persona?
But no one could be prepared for the vigor ofhis
counterattack:
"1 always assume that the people who read
my books are smarter than 1 am, and that 1 am
assuming a persona for the purposes of the
novel Oddly enough, it's usually book re
viewers who fail to make the distinction."
Touchy.
The mission was quickly aborted, the cause
abandoned. And so we must continue to forge
our own individual relationships with boldly
honest works like Pearson's, to think about their
implications in the context of our own reactions.
Come to think of it, there are plenty ofbooks
out there which offer easy answers and com
fortable cliches, instead of Pearsons difficult
contradictions, and most of them are boring.
In retrospect, maybe that's the whole point,
huh?B
