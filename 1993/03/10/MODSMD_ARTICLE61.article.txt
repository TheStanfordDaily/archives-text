# VISITING THE ART MUSEUM
## WHAT ARTIFACTS CAN BE FOUND WHERE 
### ANGIE CHUANG 
Art museums. Long, austere halls full
of artsy-fartsies in black berets and
turtlenecks, over-analyzing obscure
paintings.
Y-a-w-n.
For too long, these institutions have been
given a bad rap.
The Bay Area offers a variety of museums,
from the large and well-known to the small and
obscure, that cater to a variety of artistic interests.
For example, while modern art buffs will
enjoy the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art's avant-garde collection, those who prefer
less-abstract art may find the de Young Muse
um's collection of historical American art more
their speed.
Also, almost all Bay Area museums are locat
ed near other places-to-go, such as the San Fran
cisco Opera (right across the street from the
Museum of Modern Art). So make it worth
your while and plan a day trip.
Here's a sampling of what the Bay Area has to
offer
IntheGty
Last year, San Francisco had three main of
ferings in terms of major art museums, span
ning the European historical, American histori
cal and modern genres.
Unfortunately, the crown jewel of San Fran
cisco museums, which boasted a prestigious col
lection of European 19th-century art, the Palace
of the Legion of Honor, closed last winter for ap
proximately two years of earthquake repairs.

However, the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, located in the Civic Center near
City Hall, has a noteworthy collection for those
with contemporary tastes.
The current feature exhibit, the "Anderson
Collection Gift of American Pop Art," is a com
prehensive look at the tongue-in-cheek nature
of pop art Exhibit highlights include self-por
traits by Andy Warhol, of Campbell s Soup and
Marilyn Monroe fame. "Set of Six Self-Por
traits" best exemplifies his trademark tech
niques of bright color-blocking and repetition.
Also on display are several of Ray Lichsteins

works, known for their psychedelic nature and
use of dots — many, many dots.
The museum's permanent collection,
housed in a series of pristine, high-ceilinged
halls, includes a variety of paintings, prints,
photographs and sculptures that represent the
wide range of American contemporary art.
For example, Jonathan Borofsky's "Chatter
ing Men," a larger-than-life sculpture of three
gray, wooden silhouettes of men with mechani
cal moving mouths that utter some sort of robot
ic, enigmatic babble. It's amusing, yet disturbing.
Stanford students should take particular
note of the painting "Adolesccnt by the Bed," by
the Farm's own Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira.
The M.H. deYoung Museum in Golden Gate
Park has an extensive collection for those with
more historical and anthropological interests.
Its American collection is a chronological tour
of art in the United States since the 17th century.
Notables include silver by Paul Revere and paint
ings by Benjamin West and Mary Cassatt.
Displayed in somewhat cozy (by museum
standards, anyway) rooms that each reflect the
mood of the pieces in them, the exhibit takes the
viewer through stages in American history,
from colonialism to today via representative art.
In the collection's final room, "20th Century
mixed media works featuring Bay Area Artists,"
viewers can encounter Robert Arneson's infamous
portrait sculpture of assassinated San Francisco
mayor George Moscone up close and personal.
DeYoung s current feature exhibition is on the

history of glass-making and Louis Comfort
Tiffany. A colorful collection ofhistorical and rare
vases makes up most of the collection, but partic
ularly impressive are the stained glass works.
The museum also has permanent collections
of English, African and indigenous American
(the peoples of native North, Central and South
America) art
S.F. specialties
Right next door to the deYoung (and covered
by the same admission price) is the largest of San
Francisco's more specialized art museums. The
Asian Art Museum has a comprehensive and di
verse collection of art from Japan to Vietnam.
Hie well-organized collection includes every
thing from religious statues to ornamental jewel
ry, and dimly lit, maze-like rooms set the mood.
In the Japan section, ornamental archway
pieces are set up for viewers to walk through.
With painted screens on the sides of the arch
way, museum-goers definitely get a feel for an
cient Japan.
Representative sculptures impressively por
tray many of the countries' religious or leg
endary figures. Chinese, Japanese and Indian
collections have especially notable statues, and
viewers can see the distinct characteristics that
differentiate each country from the other.
San Francisco has a wide sampling of smaller
ethnic museums, but among the most notable
are the African American Historical and Cultur
al Society, the Mexican Museum and the Museo
Italo Americano, all located in Fort Mason.
The Ansel Adams Center and the Cartoon
Art Museum also cater to specific interests.
Ansel Adams' famed black-and-white land
scape photographs should appeal to nature and
photography enthusiasts alike.
The Cartoon Art Museum currently is fea
turing Cyl Sylvester's work, which consists of
single-panel cartoons that present animal
rights and gay-rights issues.
This side of the Peninsula
Heading south, the San Jose Museum of
Modern Art also provides contemporary art en
thusiasts with fairly large feature exhibits as well
as 47 of the Stanford Museum's collection of
Rodin sculptures, which are on loan.
Its current feature exhibit is "King Remem
bered," a collection of about 50 photographs by
photojournalist Flip Schulk depicting Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s life in the '50s and '60s. ■
