# Selecting the right actor
## Drama community discusses race-blind, non-traditional casting at Stanford 
### Ted Quinn Photos by Mimi Kuo 
In 1992, Eddie Murphy turned a timeworn Hollywood
tradition on its head. With the exception of an occa
sional waitress or random passerby, every speaking part
in his film "Boomerang" was filled by a black actor or ac
tress.
The effect seemed almost surreal to many of the audience
members, both black and white, despite the fact that most of
these people had sat through hundreds of films with uni
formly white casts.
This asymmetry of audience reaction dramatically un
derscores just how entrenched the institutional racism in the
acting profession has become, and the voices demanding
change are becoming louder.
In 1990, when producer Cameron Mackintosh ("Les
Mis6rables") hired a white actor, Jonathan Pryce, to play a
Eurasian character in "Miss Saigon," after what many con
sidered to be a less-than-earnest search for an Asian actor,
the labor organization Actor's Equity decided to take a stand
and the ensuing debate became a litmus test for the com
munity's feelings about race issues in casting.
The Jonathan Pryce situation was especially problematic
because non-traditional casting, the practice of filling a role
with an actor different in race or gender than that suggested
by the text or its historical context, has become increasingly
popular as a way to increase opportunities for actors of
color, as well as to make an artistic statement.
Michael Ramsaur, chairman of Stanford's Drama De
partment, says that the department eschews formal policy
making regarding race issues in casting in favor of continu
ous dialogue with the community and within the depart
ment:
"Ultimately, the department believes that there needs to
be the artistic freedom by the director to cast and direct a
show in the way that the director artistically feels is appro
priate."
One of the ways in which the Drama Department
strives to increase opportunity for actors of color is
by sponsoring joint productions with both the
Committee for Black Performing Arts, a university organi
zation headed by Drama Dept. Assoc. Prof. Harry Elam, and
the student-run Asian American Theater Project.
Ramsaur also stresses that the existence of these organi
zations indirectly affects performance choices within the de
partment:
"We are doing shows that we would not otherwise have
done, and not just the shows that they do; they also influence

the shows that we do It attunes sensibilities and edu
cates us all about aspects of drama and our craft."
The department also strives for diversity within its pro
ductions through non-traditional casting. Drama graduate
student Judith Dolan says she feels that non-traditional cast
ing is an integral part of her artistic vision. When she direct
ed a collage of Tennessee Williams material, she formed a
multi-racial ensemble of actors and then collaborated with
them to choose among a body of non-canonical texts.
"It was not a question of being PC. It was a question of
'How can I present Tennessee Williams in non-traditional
ways so that people will listen to him' It's in my interest
to cast not only the best actors, but people that will force a
kind of listening anew."
The result was to have both black male actors and female
actors playing Tennessee Williams in various readings, as
well as a black woman playing an Italian mother. Later, when
she directed a Brecht adaptation of John Webster's 17th
century play "The Duchess of Malfi," set in 16th century
Italy, she once again "crossed" both gender and race in
major roles of the play.
Dolan doesn't buy the notion that such casting inevitably
subverts the text of the play:
"We can never recreate whatever the intention or attitude
of the early 17th-century Elizabethan England is.The text is
alive. The test exists now. The audience exists now. The ac
tors exist now. To present it in any kind of preservationist
way I would consider a violent act to the text as a living,
breathing performance."
Robert Kelley, the founder and artistic director of
Theatre Works, a Palo Alto-based production com
pany, says that diversity is a "major part of The
atre Works' mission":
"I think our overall goal is to have on our stage what we
see all around us in our community so that we reflect the
many different cultures in the community."
Theatre Works has experimented with almost every
model for casting, from culturally specific work to blind
casting to non-traditional casting. The results are impres
sive; Kelley cites the fact that actors of color comprised about
50 percent of the actors Theatre Works has hired over the last
two years.
Like Judith Dolan, Kelley challenges the idea that non
traditional casting should be restricted to pre-18th-century
texts, an unstated rule of thumb in many theater communi
ties:

"If there's no very strong prevailing reason
why a role needs to be an actor of a particu
lar background or culture, then that play
and role is a perfect one for non-traditional
casting."
Kelley acknowledges that such casting can
occasionally encounter problems. In a play
about a Jewish couple in New York, they cast
a black couple only to find that the language
of the play was uncomfortable for the actors.
He hastens to add, though, that "A far more
prevalent situation is one in which the non
traditional casting adds depth to the work,
rather than prevents it from resonating as
much as it might."
He also acknowledges the importance of
social realities in making casting decisions.
Hesitating to make a judgment about the
Jonathan Pryce decision from afar, he never
theless asserts unequivocally that the role
would have been filled by an Asian actor if
Theatre Works was doing the play:
"We're not on a flat surface in terms of the
world of theater as a whole. It's been slanted
the wrong way for a long time. It may be that
someday we get back to a situation where
Laurence Olivier playing Othello is perfect
ly appropriate, but if it were at Theatre-
Works someone else would be playing Oth
ello — someone who was African-Ameri
can."
To Alex D'Arbeloff, a white actress who's
done extensive work with both the Drama
Department and independent theater

groups, a lack of diversity in casting on campus
usually results because directors have precon
ceived artistic notions and are unable to adapt
those ideas to the diverse community of actors
who are out there:
"As actors and directors, we have a responsi
bility to be seeing who is there. If you look at
the plays we have, we know the plays are not a
refection of who is really [in the community of
actors].... Most of the interesting roles are for
white men."
She acknowledges that this kind of flexibili
ty in casting can sometimes be problematic,
though. In an acting group she's helping to
form this summer, the texts the group is using
have parts for both a black woman and a Lati
na woman, but at the end of the auditions there
were no black or Latina women in their ensem
ble.
"Then again," she points out, "none of the
roles are typically for black men, but we will
have black men playing them .... We cast the
10 best people and then just distributed the
roles to see how it turned out. Should we have
really searched to find a Latina woman? Was
that irresponsible? I don't know."
Actor Barney Cheng sees real problems with
casting race-specific roles non-traditionally:
"If a character doesn't have to be white, then
anybody can portray that character — whoev
er has the most talent. However, if a character is
race-specific, say an Asian character, then I
don't think a white person should play that
part."

Cheng thinks that theater organizations on campus are
especially inhospitable to Asian actors:
"I'm still very intimidated. ... I just don't know how
open-minded people are about non-traditional casting. In
'Little Shop of Horrors' are they going to cast an Asian per
son as Seymour? We have such a perception about what that
person looks like from movies and past productions."
The notion that musical and comedy theater like "Litde
Shop of Horrors" is less conducive to non-traditional cast
ing than the more serious "theater of ideas" typical of acad
emic departments is widespread. As a result, theater groups
that focus on these "lighter" works like the Ram's Head The
atrical Society tend to gain a reputation for less-diverse cast
ing. Ramsaur summed up this perception somewhat enig
matically:

'Ultimately, the department
believes that there needs to be the
artistic freedom by the director to
cast and direct a show in the way
that the director artistically feels
is appropriate.'

Michael Ramsaur

"When you're doing shows like 'Oklahoma,' the natural
inclination is to say 'Well, that's a bunch of people in Okla
homa.' "
Christine Giviskos, the executive producer of Ram's
Head, agrees that the organization has had difficulties
achieving racial diversity in their casts:
"I don't know whether it's the nature of the musical or
that the Drama Department does lots of little shows while
we do three relatively big shows, but we do tend to not have
the diversity that we would hope for."
She points out that Ram's Head convened a special com
mittee on multicultural issues last year in an attempt to ad
dress some of these problems, and the organization sent a
letter sent to all incoming freshman students of color de
scribing Big Game Gaieties and encouraging them to audi
tion.

Perceptions of Ram's Head among the acting commu
nity are dramatically illustrated by black actor Greg
Miller, who recalls an audition he attended last year
for the Ram's Head "Original Winter One Acts":
"I went to audition and basically every part was scripted
to the point that if you weren't blonde and tall you couldn't
play the part. I said 'Basically, I need not waste my time au
ditioning. I don't look like any of these guys.' That was one
of the most awful acting experiences I've ever had."
On the other hand, Miller says he feels fairly comfortable
auditioning for most shows in the Drama Department, de
spite the fact that both the department's faculty and the texts
they choose to produce are dominated by white people:
"I would say that the Drama Department shows are pret
ty much if you audition and you're good, you'll get the part.
I wouldn't feel like I couldn't get the part because I'm black
I'm not going to say that the Drama Department is a
bastion of this [racial diversity], but I could see myself play
ing Romeo."
Miller also says he questions just how "non-traditional"
these sorts of casting decisions are:
"I like to play guys who are not necessarily black, but just
come in to be funny or be the villain or be the hero, but white
people get standardized as all types and then [the commu
nity] marginalizes the black performer and says he can only
do things that are specific to his race or culture."
He also stresses the social benefits of breaking down these
sorts of casting stereotypes:
"I think that's the power of theater — that maybe if you
see me as just a funny guy and not a black guy, we may learn
that we find some of the same shit funny and that gives us
some common ground."
Almost everyone in the theater community agrees
that non-traditional casting has the potential to de
stroy needless preconceptions about people of dif
ferent cultures, and thereby promote dialogue and harmony.
Conversely, everyone seems to agree that non-traditional
casting is often ill-advised when the role being cast is specif
ic to a particular race or culture. Arguments begin when
people in the community try to define what makes a role
"culturally specific."
In its most divisive form, the debate concerns the casting
of white actors in roles that some perceive as intended for ac
tors of color.
Clark Jackson, a black actor whose background consists
primarily of shows that focus on the black community —

like the King Papers Project, "The Colored Museum" and
"The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire
World" — discussed his reactions to a scene assigned in an
acting class. White actors played Oprah Winfrey and
Michael Jackson in a reenactment of the recent television in
terview:
"I felt like the use of these two white people was cool as an
acting exercise, but the dynamics were effaced. Here's this
black man, who you attach these very certain ideas to, and a
black woman and you're looking at how they relate as two
black people and, for that matter, how they don't relate "
But Jackson is quick to point out that he supports cross
cultural casting "100 percent," wanting, however, to make
sure that people have a full awareness of the implications of
such work:
"When we look at people we say, 'They're black, they're
white, they're gay,' and we attach certain expectations of be
haviors [to them] because of our knowledge of stereotypes
and all different kinds of things. If you want to cast people in
roles, you have to be aware of how you're affecting those ex
pectations and those dynamics. If you don't cast according
to what the playwright had in mind, you have to realize
you're changing the dynamics that were intended."
Miller's has a less-equivocal reaction to this practice of
casting white actors in such roles:
"I don't see doing a play about Hispanics and not having
Hispanics play themselves. I think that's bullshit"
Although the questions are complex and the conflicts run
deep, the community is engaging in dialogue about all of
these issues with unprecedented vigor. In addition to the
heated Jonathan Pryce debate, there have been national
symposia on non-traditional casting and diversity in cast
ing. Drama Dept. Assoc. Prof. Anna Deavere Smith teaches
a course called "Beyond Stereotypes," which explores all of
these issues through reading, discussion and cross-cultural
and cross-gender acting work.
Kelley, for one, is optimistic:
"I really have rarely seen a piece where you didn't realize
that we are in transition as a community and a culture, and
that's to the good. You realize that theater is making steps
forward and that's what theater ought to do, is hold up that
mirror to society and say 'See? What do you see?' "
And if that mirror has in the past been obscured by the
stain of institutional racism in the theater community and
the confining preconceptions of mainstream audiences, it
seems clear that, in fits and starts, the hard work of polish
ing that mirror has begun. ■
