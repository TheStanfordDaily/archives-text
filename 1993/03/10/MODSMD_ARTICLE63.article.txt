Raw meat cannot
erase bitter taste
of awful Inuit flick

Shadow of the Wolf

The big-budget Canadian feature "Shad
ow of the Wolf," boasts a scene in which Lou
Diamond Philips ("La Bamba,") helps deliver
his newborn son in the desolate Arctic tun
dra.
In what should be a moment of exultation,
Philips, playing a young Inuit hunter, shouts
into the wind that he will name his son
Tiarak, but his atrocious delivery makes it
sound like "Tire Rack," which leaves the au
dience laughing its socks off at Philips' deci
sion to name his kid after a car accessory.
Agaguk (Philips) is the headstrong Inuit
hunter living in a small village headed by his
shaman father, Kroomak (Toshiro Mifune).
Because Agaguk doesn't like white guys, espe
cially slimy trappers with bad French accents,
he stabs one in the beginning of the film and
makes off with an Inuit babe who's slated to
become his father's main squeeze.
His father bestows upon him the "curse of
the white wolf," before the young couple dog
sleds off. Later, they build an igloo, bear a
child and exchange Epiphanies like these: "I
did not know I was yours." Says the terse
Agaguk: "Yes, you are." (Be warned: all the
Inuits, during the 108 minutes of the film,
carry on with these Cro-Magnon speech im
pediments.)
The rest of the film concerns Agaguk's at
tempt to deal with the white wolf, his father,
and the white lawmen who track him.
Philips' performance consists of frequent
grunts and clipped sentences such as, "The
whale, he comes," making the audience won
der whether Agaguk suffered irreparable head
trauma earlier in life. Philips' attempt to por
tray Agaguk as a wild, Crazy Horse-type is so
embarrassing that it's impossible to believe
that he's an impassioned hero of the Inuit
people.
Veteran actors Donald Sutherland and
Toshiro Mifune also star in this botched ven
ture, but don't look to them for any sort of
pain relief. Sutherland plays the lawman who
searches for Agaguk, but he acts like he acci
dentally wandered on to the set and isn't to
tally sure why he's there.
Mifune plays the shaman who's more in
terested in the white man's cigarettes and
booze than in summoning the spirits, and

he's completely unconvincing as a powerful
magician. This fact makes the ending all the
more hokey when Mifune works some sor
cery for a happy ending that leaves all the Inu
its overjoyed and the audience feeling ripped
off.
Random scenes of Inuit life pop up annoy
ingly in "Shadow of the Woir without any
preface or explanation, leading the audience
to wonder such things as, "Why were those
women chewing on that stick-thing?" and
"Why do those Inuit guys hit each other on
the shoulder while half-naked?"
The ultimate question is, of course, "Why
am I watching this film?" and it's a difficult
one to answer — it's clearly neither the story
nor the direction. Some of the scenery is
breathtaking, but this provides little suste
nance for an hour and 40 minutes. For a less
preachy, more honest and definitely more af
fordable look at Inuit life and history, you'd
probably be better off consulting the World
Book encyclopedia.

'Kids' swings with
exhilarating dance
in shadow of war

Swing Kids

Director Thomas Carter says "Swing
Kids" is "more than just a dance movie,"
and he's half right. In fact, it's no dance
movie at all, but a pseudo-historical com
ing-of-age film more influenced by "Dead
Poets Society" than "Dirty Dancing."
Long after the dancing is done, however,
swing music provides the backdrop against
which the young Germans of the title defy
the harsh discipline imposed by their gov
ernment in this true story set in 1939 Ham
burg.
Scorned by the Nazis as the music of "de
generates" (i.e. blacks and Jews), swing cul
ture is covertly embraced by rebellious Ger
man teenagers. They risk imprisonment
and worse to hear swing in underground
dance halls and on bootleg LPs smuggled
into the country under such innocuous
pseudonyms as "Gene and His Band"
(Benny Goodman).
Best friends Peter Muller and Thomas
Berger view the freedom of swing music

and dancing as both a response and alter
native to their increasingly repressed soci
ety. "No one who likes swing could be a
Nazi," they insist. So when Peter is caught
stealing a radio and forced to join the
Hitler Youth, Thomas joins up too, insist
ing that the Nazi uniform is the perfect
cover: "Hitler Youth by day, swing boys by
night."
But, as Peter and Thomas complete their
training, the boys drift further and further
apart. Brainwashed by the power and free
dom afforded the Nazis as well as by the
anti-Semitic propaganda he's force-fed,
Thomas spurns his swing roots.
"You're turning into a fucking Nazi!"
Peter tells him. "So what if I am?" Thomas
asks. It's a response that would seem
alarming in any other context. Here, it's
just another example of the seductive influ
ence of the Nazi party, evident throughout
the film.
It is this pervasive influence which the di
rector portrays most successfully. Carter's

sympathies lie not with the Nazis, but with
the thousands of regular Germans who lived
in fear in their shadow.
But his success is problematic. Is it possi
ble to make a movie about anti-Semitism
without glamorizing it? The film calls to
mind recent "gangsta" films, both in its
themes and its moral didacticism. Like his
characters, Carter often reduces complex is
sues to trite aphorisms, which undermines
his anti-Nazi message.
In less politically-charged scenes, howev
er, "Swing Kids" soars. When Nazi officers
raid an underground swing hall, the orches
tra and dancers seamlessly segue into a rous
ing polka. Staged by "Malcolm X" choreog
rapher Otis Sallid, the exhilarating dance
scenes are far too few.
As Peter, Robert Sean Leonard is a model
of idealistic intensity, both on and off the
dance floor. Christian Bale is almost sympa
thetic as Thomas, and Frank Whaley ap
proaches perfection as Arvid, the nerdy mu
sician who can't dance (or join the army)
due to a limp.
In the role of Peter's working-class moth
er, Barbara Hershey is burdened with dowdy
dresses and a perpetual worried frown. But
everyone is out-acted by Kenneth Branagh,
in an uncredited cameo as a droll yet slight
ly sinister Gestapo boss. It's a shame that the
rest of the film doesn't match Branagh's
performance.

The aged are not
innocent in this
Wharton classic

Ethan Frome

Of the popular classics of English litera
ture, Edith Wharton's novella "Ethan Frome"
remains one of the few that have not, until
now, been translated into a motion picture.
There's probably a reason for that — the
story of "Ethan Frome" suffers from an over
ly simplistic, melodramatic plot coupled
with symbolism as subtle as a sledgehammer
in the jaw. However, director John Madden
uses the book's flaws to his advantage in the
film version, where melodrama and blatan
cy are forgivable.
Set in rural New England at the turn of
the century, "Ethan Frome" 's austere, win
try backdrop reflects its story of tragic love
and unfulfilled dreams. In fact, even though
years pass as the story unfolds, it never seems
to stop snowing.
The movie opens when Reverend Smith
(Tate Donovan) arrives as the town's new
preacher. He takes an interest in a disfigured
man whom all of the townspeople seem to
ignore — Ethan Frome. Smith tries to learn
more about the mysterious pariah, and
eventually finds his answer when his land
lord tells him Ethan's history.
Liam Neeson stars as the shy, awkward
Ethan, a young man who dreams of tran
scending the small-town life he has grown
up in. After his mother's death, he marries a
distant cousin, Zeena (Joan Allen), more out
of convenience than love.
The marriage deteriorates as her
hypochondria runs rampant. Zeena's
cousin, the young and naive Mattie Silver
(Patricia Arquette), moves onto the farm to
take care of her. Much to her chagrin, Ethan
and Mattie fall in love, leading to the in
evitably tragic denouement.
Neeson, a refreshing change from the
stereotypical male heartthrob lead, strikes a
balance with Ethan's character: his vulnerabli
ty and good-heartedness elicit sympathy, but
he is not merely a victim of circumstances.
Clearly, his passivity partially causes his fate.
However, viewers will find Arquette's
Mattie harder to sympathize with because
she comes off a little too shallow and weak
willed. Arquette cannot be entirely blamed
for this, however; Wharton's original char
acter suffers from the same afflictions.
On the other hand, Allen manages to
transform Wharton's petulant, cold-hearted
Zeena into a more human character whose
actions are a plea for love and attention.
Screenwriter Richard Nelson remains
faithful to Wharton's original text. However,
he and Madden also add depth to the origi
nal story's clich£d symbols and situations.
For example, the presence of Zeena's cat
when Mattie and Ethan are sharing a tender
moment alludes to Zeena's disapproval,
without overplaying it.
Maddens advantageous use of the film
medium, backed up by strong performances by
Neeson and Allen, make the movie more en
joyable than the original book. A rarity indeed.
So go ahead, let your English teachers cringe —
ditch the book and watch the movie instead.

tempt to deal with the white wolf, his father,
and the white lawmen who track him.
Philips' performance consists of frequent
grunts and clipped sentences such as, "The
whale, he comes," making the audience won
der whether Agaguk suffered irreparable head
trauma earlier in life. Philips' attempt to por
tray Agaguk as a wild, Crazy Horse-type is so
embarrassing that it's impossible to believe
that he's an impassioned hero of the Inuit
people.
Veteran actors Donald Sutherland and
Toshiro Mifune also star in this botched ven
ture, but don't look to them for any sort of
pain relief. Sutherland plays the lawman who
searches for Agaguk, but he acts like he acci
dentally wandered on to the set and isn't to
tally sure why he's there.
Mifune plays the shaman who's more in
terested in the white man's cigarettes and
booze than in summoning the spirits, and

he's completely unconvincing as a powerful
magician. This fact makes the ending all the
more hokey when Mifune works some sor
cery for a happy ending that leaves all the Inu
its overjoyed and the audience feeling ripped
off.
Random scenes of Inuit life pop up annoy
ingly in "Shadow of the Woir without any
preface or explanation, leading the audience
to wonder such things as, "Why were those
women chewing on that stick-thing?" and
"Why do those Inuit guys hit each other on
the shoulder while half-naked?"
The ultimate question is, of course, "Why
am I watching this film?" and it's a difficult
one to answer — it's clearly neither the story
nor the direction. Some of the scenery is
breathtaking, but this provides little suste
nance for an hour and 40 minutes. For a less
preachy, more honest and definitely more af
fordable look at Inuit life and history, you'd
probably be better off consulting the World
Book encyclopedia.

'Kids' swings with
exhilarating dance
in shadow of war

Swing Kids

Director Thomas Carter says "Swing
Kids" is "more than just a dance movie,"
and he's half right. In fact, it's no dance
movie at all, but a pseudo-historical com
ing-of-age film more influenced by "Dead
Poets Society" than "Dirty Dancing."
Long after the dancing is done, however,
swing music provides the backdrop against
which the young Germans of the title defy
the harsh discipline imposed by their gov
ernment in this true story set in 1939 Ham
burg.
Scorned by the Nazis as the music of "de
generates" (i.e. blacks and Jews), swing cul
ture is covertly embraced by rebellious Ger
man teenagers. They risk imprisonment
and worse to hear swing in underground
dance halls and on bootleg LPs smuggled
into the country under such innocuous
pseudonyms as "Gene and His Band"
(Benny Goodman).
Best friends Peter Muller and Thomas
Berger view the freedom of swing music

and dancing as both a response and alter
native to their increasingly repressed soci
ety. "No one who likes swing could be a
Nazi," they insist. So when Peter is caught
stealing a radio and forced to join the
Hitler Youth, Thomas joins up too, insist
ing that the Nazi uniform is the perfect
cover: "Hitler Youth by day, swing boys by
night."
But, as Peter and Thomas complete their
training, the boys drift further and further
apart. Brainwashed by the power and free
dom afforded the Nazis as well as by the
anti-Semitic propaganda he's force-fed,
Thomas spurns his swing roots.
"You're turning into a fucking Nazi!"
Peter tells him. "So what if I am?" Thomas
asks. It's a response that would seem
alarming in any other context. Here, it's
just another example of the seductive influ
ence of the Nazi party, evident throughout
the film.
It is this pervasive influence which the di
rector portrays most successfully. Carter's

sympathies lie not with the Nazis, but with
the thousands of regular Germans who lived
in fear in their shadow.
But his success is problematic. Is it possi
ble to make a movie about anti-Semitism
without glamorizing it? The film calls to
mind recent "gangsta" films, both in its
themes and its moral didacticism. Like his
characters, Carter often reduces complex is
sues to trite aphorisms, which undermines
his anti-Nazi message.
In less politically-charged scenes, howev
er, "Swing Kids" soars. When Nazi officers
raid an underground swing hall, the orches
tra and dancers seamlessly segue into a rous
ing polka. Staged by "Malcolm X" choreog
rapher Otis Sallid, the exhilarating dance
scenes are far too few.
As Peter, Robert Sean Leonard is a model
of idealistic intensity, both on and off the
dance floor. Christian Bale is almost sympa
thetic as Thomas, and Frank Whaley ap
proaches perfection as Arvid, the nerdy mu
sician who can't dance (or join the army)
due to a limp.
In the role of Peter's working-class moth
er, Barbara Hershey is burdened with dowdy
dresses and a perpetual worried frown. But
everyone is out-acted by Kenneth Branagh,
in an uncredited cameo as a droll yet slight
ly sinister Gestapo boss. It's a shame that the
rest of the film doesn't match Branagh's
performance.

The aged are not
innocent in this
Wharton classic

Ethan Frome

Of the popular classics of English litera
ture, Edith Wharton's novella "Ethan Frome"
remains one of the few that have not, until
now, been translated into a motion picture.
There's probably a reason for that — the
story of "Ethan Frome" suffers from an over
ly simplistic, melodramatic plot coupled
with symbolism as subtle as a sledgehammer
in the jaw. However, director John Madden
uses the book's flaws to his advantage in the
film version, where melodrama and blatan
cy are forgivable.
Set in rural New England at the turn of
the century, "Ethan Frome" 's austere, win
try backdrop reflects its story of tragic love
and unfulfilled dreams. In fact, even though
years pass as the story unfolds, it never seems
to stop snowing.
The movie opens when Reverend Smith
(Tate Donovan) arrives as the town's new
preacher. He takes an interest in a disfigured
man whom all of the townspeople seem to
ignore — Ethan Frome. Smith tries to learn
more about the mysterious pariah, and
eventually finds his answer when his land
lord tells him Ethan's history.
Liam Neeson stars as the shy, awkward
Ethan, a young man who dreams of tran
scending the small-town life he has grown
up in. After his mother's death, he marries a
distant cousin, Zeena (Joan Allen), more out
of convenience than love.
The marriage deteriorates as her
hypochondria runs rampant. Zeena's
cousin, the young and naive Mattie Silver
(Patricia Arquette), moves onto the farm to
take care of her. Much to her chagrin, Ethan
and Mattie fall in love, leading to the in
evitably tragic denouement.
Neeson, a refreshing change from the
stereotypical male heartthrob lead, strikes a
balance with Ethan's character: his vulnerabli
ty and good-heartedness elicit sympathy, but
he is not merely a victim of circumstances.
Clearly, his passivity partially causes his fate.
However, viewers will find Arquette's
Mattie harder to sympathize with because
she comes off a little too shallow and weak
willed. Arquette cannot be entirely blamed
for this, however; Wharton's original char
acter suffers from the same afflictions.
On the other hand, Allen manages to
transform Wharton's petulant, cold-hearted
Zeena into a more human character whose
actions are a plea for love and attention.
Screenwriter Richard Nelson remains
faithful to Wharton's original text. However,
he and Madden also add depth to the origi
nal story's clich£d symbols and situations.
For example, the presence of Zeena's cat
when Mattie and Ethan are sharing a tender
moment alludes to Zeena's disapproval,
without overplaying it.
Maddens advantageous use of the film
medium, backed up by strong performances by
Neeson and Allen, make the movie more en
joyable than the original book. A rarity indeed.
So go ahead, let your English teachers cringe —
ditch the book and watch the movie instead.

Shadow of the Wolf

The big-budget Canadian feature "Shad
ow of the Wolf," boasts a scene in which Lou
Diamond Philips ("La Bamba,") helps deliver
his newborn son in the desolate Arctic tun
dra.
In what should be a moment of exultation,
Philips, playing a young Inuit hunter, shouts
into the wind that he will name his son
Tiarak, but his atrocious delivery makes it
sound like "Tire Rack," which leaves the au
dience laughing its socks off at Philips' deci
sion to name his kid after a car accessory.
Agaguk (Philips) is the headstrong Inuit
hunter living in a small village headed by his
shaman father, Kroomak (Toshiro Mifune).
Because Agaguk doesn't like white guys, espe
cially slimy trappers with bad French accents,
he stabs one in the beginning of the film and
makes off with an Inuit babe who's slated to
become his father's main squeeze.
His father bestows upon him the "curse of
the white wolf," before the young couple dog
sleds off. Later, they build an igloo, bear a
child and exchange Epiphanies like these: "I
did not know I was yours." Says the terse
Agaguk: "Yes, you are." (Be warned: all the
Inuits, during the 108 minutes of the film,
carry on with these Cro-Magnon speech im
pediments.)
The rest of the film concerns Agaguk's at
tempt to deal with the white wolf, his father,

The ultimate question is, of course, "Why
am I watching this film?" and it's a difficult
one to answer — it's clearly neither the story
nor the direction. Some of the scenery is
breathtaking, but this provides little suste
nance for an hour and 40 minutes. For a less
preachy, more honest and definitely more af
fordable look at Inuit life and history, you'd
probably be better off consulting the World
Book encyclopedia.

'Kids' swings with
exhilarating dance
in shadow of war

Swing Kids

Director Thomas Carter says "Swing
Kids" is "more than just a dance movie,"
and he's half right. In fact, it's no dance
movie at all, but a pseudo-historical com
ing-of-age film more influenced by "Dead
Poets Society" than "Dirty Dancing."
Long after the dancing is done, however,
swing music provides the backdrop against
which the young Germans of the title defy
the harsh discipline imposed by their gov
ernment in this true story set in 1939 Ham
burg.
Scorned by the Nazis as the music of "de
generates" (i.e. blacks and Jews), swing cul
ture is covertly embraced by rebellious Ger
man teenagers. They risk imprisonment
and worse to hear swing in underground
dance halls and on bootleg LPs smuggled
into the country under such innocuous
pseudonyms as "Gene and His Band"
(Benny Goodman).
Best friends Peter Muller and Thomas
Berger view the freedom of swing music

and dancing as both a response and alter
native to their increasingly repressed soci
ety. "No one who likes swing could be a
Nazi," they insist. So when Peter is caught
stealing a radio and forced to join the
Hitler Youth, Thomas joins up too, insist
ing that the Nazi uniform is the perfect
cover: "Hitler Youth by day, swing boys by
night."
But, as Peter and Thomas complete their
training, the boys drift further and further
apart. Brainwashed by the power and free
dom afforded the Nazis as well as by the
anti-Semitic propaganda he's force-fed,
Thomas spurns his swing roots.
"You're turning into a fucking Nazi!"
Peter tells him. "So what if I am?" Thomas
asks. It's a response that would seem
alarming in any other context. Here, it's
just another example of the seductive influ
ence of the Nazi party, evident throughout
the film.
It is this pervasive influence which the di
rector portrays most successfully. Carter's

sympathies lie not with the Nazis, but with
the thousands of regular Germans who lived
in fear in their shadow.
But his success is problematic. Is it possi
ble to make a movie about anti-Semitism
without glamorizing it? The film calls to
mind recent "gangsta" films, both in its
themes and its moral didacticism. Like his
characters, Carter often reduces complex is
sues to trite aphorisms, which undermines
his anti-Nazi message.
In less politically-charged scenes, howev
er, "Swing Kids" soars. When Nazi officers
raid an underground swing hall, the orches
tra and dancers seamlessly segue into a rous
ing polka. Staged by "Malcolm X" choreog
rapher Otis Sallid, the exhilarating dance
scenes are far too few.
As Peter, Robert Sean Leonard is a model
of idealistic intensity, both on and off the
dance floor. Christian Bale is almost sympa
thetic as Thomas, and Frank Whaley ap
proaches perfection as Arvid, the nerdy mu
sician who can't dance (or join the army)
due to a limp.
In the role of Peter's working-class moth
er, Barbara Hershey is burdened with dowdy
dresses and a perpetual worried frown. But
everyone is out-acted by Kenneth Branagh,
in an uncredited cameo as a droll yet slight
ly sinister Gestapo boss. It's a shame that the
rest of the film doesn't match Branagh's
performance.

The aged are not
innocent in this
Wharton classic

Ethan Frome

Of the popular classics of English litera
ture, Edith Wharton's novella "Ethan Frome"
remains one of the few that have not, until
now, been translated into a motion picture.
There's probably a reason for that — the
story of "Ethan Frome" suffers from an over
ly simplistic, melodramatic plot coupled
with symbolism as subtle as a sledgehammer
in the jaw. However, director John Madden
uses the book's flaws to his advantage in the
film version, where melodrama and blatan
cy are forgivable.
Set in rural New England at the turn of
the century, "Ethan Frome" 's austere, win
try backdrop reflects its story of tragic love
and unfulfilled dreams. In fact, even though
years pass as the story unfolds, it never seems
to stop snowing.
The movie opens when Reverend Smith
(Tate Donovan) arrives as the town's new
preacher. He takes an interest in a disfigured
man whom all of the townspeople seem to
ignore — Ethan Frome. Smith tries to learn
more about the mysterious pariah, and
eventually finds his answer when his land
lord tells him Ethan's history.
Liam Neeson stars as the shy, awkward
Ethan, a young man who dreams of tran
scending the small-town life he has grown
up in. After his mother's death, he marries a
distant cousin, Zeena (Joan Allen), more out
of convenience than love.
The marriage deteriorates as her
hypochondria runs rampant. Zeena's
cousin, the young and naive Mattie Silver
(Patricia Arquette), moves onto the farm to
take care of her. Much to her chagrin, Ethan
and Mattie fall in love, leading to the in
evitably tragic denouement.
Neeson, a refreshing change from the
stereotypical male heartthrob lead, strikes a
balance with Ethan's character: his vulnerabli
ty and good-heartedness elicit sympathy, but
he is not merely a victim of circumstances.
Clearly, his passivity partially causes his fate.
However, viewers will find Arquette's
Mattie harder to sympathize with because
she comes off a little too shallow and weak
willed. Arquette cannot be entirely blamed
for this, however; Wharton's original char
acter suffers from the same afflictions.
On the other hand, Allen manages to
transform Wharton's petulant, cold-hearted
Zeena into a more human character whose
actions are a plea for love and attention.
Screenwriter Richard Nelson remains
faithful to Wharton's original text. However,
he and Madden also add depth to the origi
nal story's clich£d symbols and situations.
For example, the presence of Zeena's cat
when Mattie and Ethan are sharing a tender
moment alludes to Zeena's disapproval,
without overplaying it.
Maddens advantageous use of the film
medium, backed up by strong performances by
Neeson and Allen, make the movie more en
joyable than the original book. A rarity indeed.
So go ahead, let your English teachers cringe —
ditch the book and watch the movie instead.
