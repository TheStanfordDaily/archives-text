Guitar plays loud
so listen: grunge
poetry from U.K.

Th' Faith Healers

In name alone, Th' Faith Healers come off
as pretty pretentious. By dropping the "e"
from their name, Th' Faith Healers would
like to be another band whose artiness trans
lates into songs with "deeply poetic" lyrics.
Luckily, this isn't the case. "Lido," the Th'
Faith Healers debut album, sounds more like
an ode to Sonic Youth's guitar noise than the
latest entry in coffee house poetry.
Th' Faith Healers tend to steer toward
one- or two-chord harmonies which are
subsequently built upon. The song "Don't
Jones Me" starts off simply with a guitar and
bass line while lead singer Roxanne Stephen
merely repeats the words "don't jones me
in"in a voice that lies somewhere between a
cat's meow and a whine. Then, suddenly, a
distorted guitar disturbs the monotony, ac
companied by pounding drums and crash
ing cymbals. The song returns to a more sub
dued vocal delivery by Stephen, only to later
dissolve into guitar feedback.
The energy of Tom Cullinen's aggressive
guitar playing and Joe Dilworth's thrashing
drums propel the songs forward at break
neck speeds — "Reptile Smile" threatens to
crush the listener with a full-scale guitar as
sault.
Since feedback dominates many of the
tracks, Stephen doesn't need to sing partic
ularly deep lyrics nor possess a great singing
voice. Guitar noise, after all, can hide a mul
titude of sins. The only chance to hear
Stephen's voice is on "It's Easy Being You"
which starts acoustically only to give way to
more feedback. She's no chanteuse, but her
vocals add to the album's frenetic pace.
Th' Faith Healers show that grunge rock
exists in the U.K., outside the city limits of
Seattle. The group, however, has more in
common with Sonic Youth than Nirvana's
more pop-oriented songs — a throwback to
the days when grunge wasn't a household
word nor the latest fashion trend of design
ers.
So while Th' Faith Healers fail to explore
any uncharted territory, their debut is full of
energy and the promise that guitar feedback
will continue in the future. Now, only if
they'd put that "e" back in their name.

Duran Duran

As the hit single suggests, Duran Duran has
finally made its way to the "Ordinary World."
Ironically, "Ordinary" is the most original
song on the band's eponymous ninth album.
The remainder of the album dulls listeners to
the point of pure torture — it's a masturbato
ry exercise in passive-aggressive performance.
Like the musicians themselves, "Duran
Duran" is expertly produced and slickly pack
aged. Nifty cover art, however, can't make up
for derivative sounds and such insipid lyrics as
"You peel me like an onion skin."

The album works best when it sticks to the
groovy beats that made Duran Duran a fixture
of the alternative airwaves more than a decade
ago. Unfortunately, that's not very often.
Out of 13 tracks, only two — "UMF" and
"Shelter" — have that get-up-and-dance im
petus typical of the band's early efforts, despite
the abysmal lines: "Money or reputation
doesn't mean a thing to me / Special commu
nication — it's the only thing we need."
More often, "Duran Duran" delves into
such ostensibly "now" genres as rap, funk and
techno, with near-disastrous results. Alter
nately, it reverts to '80s-esque froth as unin
tentionally funny as it is forgettable.
"Come Undone," for example, is a senti
mental, keyboard-heavy love song. "Breath
After Breath" repeats that track to a Latin beat.
The method reaches its nadir on "Femme Fa
tale," a sappy cover of the Velvet Underground
classic, here sounding strangely reminiscent of
Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis Eyes."
Too many tracks — most noticeably
"Drowning Man" and the instrumental "Shot

gun" — rely on samples and other techno-fla
vored gimmicks, which are tossed in seeming
ly at random.
It's no coincidence that the best of these ex
periments, "Too Much Information," betrays
a heavy Jesus Jones influence, both in style and
content. The lyrics, however, are strictly self
referential: "This band is perfect, just don't
scratch the surface / We covered all the angles
the survey people said."
It's an accurate summary of the album —
and of its failure. "Duran Duran" covers all the
angles, indeed, but the sum of those angles
doesn't add up to a unified whole. In attempt
ing to provide something for everyone, the
band cheats itself.

Muggs, Marl and
Monie: How many
cooked her brew?

Monie Love

London-born, wanna-be New Yorker
Monie Love stifles her English accent and
proves her versatility with her new album,
"In A Word Or 2." Everyone from DJ Quik to
Mary J. Blige to Madonna can be heard in the
myriad of styles on this album, which was
produced by Marley Marl.
Although Monie's working really hard,
her lyrical skills don't compare to more ver
satile MCs such as Snoop Doggy Dog. She
should also try to be original — Cypress
Hill's DJ Muggs would be proud of the phat
beats and bass lines Marley Marl produced
for her, since they sound just like something
Muggs would do himself.
The king of Paisley Park, Prince, pro
duced the title track and the first single,
"Born To Breed." For all of you die-hard
feminists out there, "Breed" stands for, as
Monie says, "Build Relationships where Ed
ucation and Enlightenment Dominate."
Other socially conscious songs make up a
large part of the album, in the single "There's
a Better Way," which deals with AIDS.
Out for that "Gangsta Bitch" image,
Monie fills the first side with threats of
"knockin' you upside the head 'til you're
dead." Unsurprisingly, Monie's threats seem
weak. She needs to quit trying to be "hard"
and concentrate more on songs like the
fourth track, "Mo' Monie," where she re
turns to the old-school style of her hit
"Monie In the Middle."
The second side begins with "Full Term
Love," one of those mandatory "men are
dogs" songs. This a song sets the pace for the
B-side, which is full of En Vogue-esque tracks
mixed with Monie's lyrical gymnastics.
Overall, "In A Word Or 2" is a quality
album. Here, the cliche "variety is the spice of
life," is a valid one. Monie Love covers the
spectrum, using everything from Madonna
like wails in "Sex U All," to the ragamuffin
chorus of "Born To Breed." The current trend
of using more realistic-sounding music and
loops helps out on the tracks where Monie's
rhyming skills are weakest. Although this
album does not rank as one of hip hop's best,
it's definitely not a disappointment.
All you Monie Love fans out there, this
album is one to look out for at the record
stores. If you're not a Monie freak, copy it
from somebody who is.

drums propel the songs forward at break
neck speeds — "Reptile Smile" threatens to
crush the listener with a full-scale guitar as
sault.
Since feedback dominates many of the
tracks, Stephen doesn't need to sing partic
ularly deep lyrics nor possess a great singing
voice. Guitar noise, after all, can hide a mul
titude of sins. The only chance to hear
Stephen's voice is on "It's Easy Being You"
which starts acoustically only to give way to
more feedback. She's no chanteuse, but her
vocals add to the album's frenetic pace.
Th' Faith Healers show that grunge rock
exists in the U.K., outside the city limits of
Seattle. The group, however, has more in
common with Sonic Youth than Nirvana's
more pop-oriented songs — a throwback to
the days when grunge wasn't a household
word nor the latest fashion trend of design
ers.
So while Th' Faith Healers fail to explore
any uncharted territory, their debut is full of
energy and the promise that guitar feedback
will continue in the future. Now, only if
they'd put that "e" back in their name.

Duran Duran

As the hit single suggests, Duran Duran has
finally made its way to the "Ordinary World."
Ironically, "Ordinary" is the most original
song on the band's eponymous ninth album.
The remainder of the album dulls listeners to
the point of pure torture — it's a masturbato
ry exercise in passive-aggressive performance.
Like the musicians themselves, "Duran
Duran" is expertly produced and slickly pack
aged. Nifty cover art, however, can't make up
for derivative sounds and such insipid lyrics as
"You peel me like an onion skin."

The album works best when it sticks to the
groovy beats that made Duran Duran a fixture
of the alternative airwaves more than a decade
ago. Unfortunately, that's not very often.
Out of 13 tracks, only two — "UMF" and
"Shelter" — have that get-up-and-dance im
petus typical of the band's early efforts, despite
the abysmal lines: "Money or reputation
doesn't mean a thing to me / Special commu
nication — it's the only thing we need."
More often, "Duran Duran" delves into
such ostensibly "now" genres as rap, funk and
techno, with near-disastrous results. Alter
nately, it reverts to '80s-esque froth as unin
tentionally funny as it is forgettable.
"Come Undone," for example, is a senti
mental, keyboard-heavy love song. "Breath
After Breath" repeats that track to a Latin beat.
The method reaches its nadir on "Femme Fa
tale," a sappy cover of the Velvet Underground
classic, here sounding strangely reminiscent of
Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis Eyes."
Too many tracks — most noticeably
"Drowning Man" and the instrumental "Shot

gun" — rely on samples and other techno-fla
vored gimmicks, which are tossed in seeming
ly at random.
It's no coincidence that the best of these ex
periments, "Too Much Information," betrays
a heavy Jesus Jones influence, both in style and
content. The lyrics, however, are strictly self
referential: "This band is perfect, just don't
scratch the surface / We covered all the angles
the survey people said."
It's an accurate summary of the album —
and of its failure. "Duran Duran" covers all the
angles, indeed, but the sum of those angles
doesn't add up to a unified whole. In attempt
ing to provide something for everyone, the
band cheats itself.

Muggs, Marl and
Monie: How many
cooked her brew?

Monie Love

London-born, wanna-be New Yorker
Monie Love stifles her English accent and
proves her versatility with her new album,
"In A Word Or 2." Everyone from DJ Quik to
Mary J. Blige to Madonna can be heard in the
myriad of styles on this album, which was
produced by Marley Marl.
Although Monie's working really hard,
her lyrical skills don't compare to more ver
satile MCs such as Snoop Doggy Dog. She
should also try to be original — Cypress
Hill's DJ Muggs would be proud of the phat
beats and bass lines Marley Marl produced
for her, since they sound just like something
Muggs would do himself.
The king of Paisley Park, Prince, pro
duced the title track and the first single,
"Born To Breed." For all of you die-hard
feminists out there, "Breed" stands for, as
Monie says, "Build Relationships where Ed
ucation and Enlightenment Dominate."
Other socially conscious songs make up a
large part of the album, in the single "There's
a Better Way," which deals with AIDS.
Out for that "Gangsta Bitch" image,
Monie fills the first side with threats of
"knockin' you upside the head 'til you're
dead." Unsurprisingly, Monie's threats seem
weak. She needs to quit trying to be "hard"
and concentrate more on songs like the
fourth track, "Mo' Monie," where she re
turns to the old-school style of her hit
"Monie In the Middle."
The second side begins with "Full Term
Love," one of those mandatory "men are
dogs" songs. This a song sets the pace for the
B-side, which is full of En Vogue-esque tracks
mixed with Monie's lyrical gymnastics.
Overall, "In A Word Or 2" is a quality
album. Here, the cliche "variety is the spice of
life," is a valid one. Monie Love covers the
spectrum, using everything from Madonna
like wails in "Sex U All," to the ragamuffin
chorus of "Born To Breed." The current trend
of using more realistic-sounding music and
loops helps out on the tracks where Monie's
rhyming skills are weakest. Although this
album does not rank as one of hip hop's best,
it's definitely not a disappointment.
All you Monie Love fans out there, this
album is one to look out for at the record
stores. If you're not a Monie freak, copy it
from somebody who is.

Guitar plays loud
so listen: grunge
poetry from U.K.

Th' Faith Healers

In name alone, Th' Faith Healers come off
as pretty pretentious. By dropping the "e"
from their name, Th' Faith Healers would
like to be another band whose artiness trans
lates into songs with "deeply poetic" lyrics.
Luckily, this isn't the case. "Lido," the Th'
Faith Healers debut album, sounds more like
an ode to Sonic Youth's guitar noise than the
latest entry in coffee house poetry.
Th' Faith Healers tend to steer toward
one- or two-chord harmonies which are
subsequently built upon. The song "Don't
Jones Me" starts off simply with a guitar and
bass line while lead singer Roxanne Stephen
merely repeats the words "don't jones me
in"in a voice that lies somewhere between a
cat's meow and a whine. Then, suddenly, a
distorted guitar disturbs the monotony, ac
companied by pounding drums and crash
ing cymbals. The song returns to a more sub
dued vocal delivery by Stephen, only to later
dissolve into guitar feedback.
