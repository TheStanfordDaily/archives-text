■Army of Darkness
Sam Raimi's latest addition to his
hit "Evil Dead" movies is a
shamelessly entertaining joyride.
Our hero, Ash (Bruce Campbell)
finds himself trapped in medieval
England, where he must defeat
the hordes of the undead and re
turn to the present. The fight se
quences, special effects and cin
ematography are all top-notch,
rivalling any blockbuster. Mind
less fun. R
■The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's got
America abuzz? Well you won't find
out, unless you see writer-director
Neil Jordan's offbeat hit. Stephen
Rea, Forest Whitaker and newcom
er Jaye Davidson are at the top of
their game in this brilliant web of
love and intrigue involving the IRA,
a British soldier and an enigmatic
hairdresser. Shades of "Vertigo,"
it's a definite must-see. R
Falling Down
Michael Douglas plays a laid-off
defense worker who loses it
while trapped in an L.A. traffic
jam. On his way home, he leaves
a trail of trashed Korean grocery
stores, dead Latino gang
bangers and terrified fast food
employees in his wake. So why's
it so bad? Because the writer

and director think that terrorizing
Koreans and shooting helpless
Latinos is funny. Rent "The Ter
minator" instead. R
Scent of a Woman
Al Pacino stars as Colonel Slade,
a blind, bitter war veteran who
tricks his prep-school student
"babysitter" (Chris O'Donnell)
into taking him to New York for
one last party before he blows
his brains out. Pacino amazes,
but his blind "Raging Bull" per
formance gets mired in a feel
good rehash of "Dead Poets So
ciety." The film succeeds only as
a showcase for Pacino's prodi
gious acting skills. R
■Strictly Ballroom
Strictly shameless, ridiculous
fun, courtesy of Aussie first-time
director Baz Luhrmann. Profes
sional dancer Scott (Paul Mercu
rio) wants to win the Kentucky
Derby of ballroom dance con
tests. But he's his own worst
enemy, preferring to dance his
dance steps in flagrant violation
of the Ballroom Dance Federa
tion's rules. Will he win? Will he
find true love? Can a white man
dance? We 11... go see it any
way. PG
