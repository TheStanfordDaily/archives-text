scene

Religious fanatics are back in vogue â€” witness the cur
rent standoff in Waco, Texas, and the bombing of the
World Trade Center. Your local video store may provide
some insights into their decidedly anti-social behavior.
America's premiere auteur Martin Scorsese's 1988 release,
The Last Temptation of Christ was greeted with bombings
and picket lines by those who felt his heartfelt work blas
phemed Jesus. But he struck back three years later with Cape
Fear, which starred Robert De Niro as a brutal, bible-spouting
madman seeking to punish his former lawyer by raping the
lawyer's wife and daughter. The film brilliantly and disturbing
ly parodied both thrillers and Scorsese's obsession with
Catholic themes, but many critics just didn't get it.
Actor Charles Laughton's directing debut, Night Of the
Hunter, proved to be his last. Hollywood-weaned execs and
audiences couldn't appreciate his dark, edgy and expressionis
tic tale of a deranged preacher (Robert Mitchum) who marries
a single mother, then plots to kill both her and her children
when they uncover his past. The preacher's parable of the bat
tle between Love and Hate, demonstrated with those two
words tattooed on his fists, has been imitated in films by Scors
ese, Oliver Stone and Spike Lee. A film noir classic.
Finally, legendary icon Clint Eastwood starred in 1985's
Pale Rider as the Preacher, a "Shane" clone who rides into a
mining town to save the citizenry from the forces of evil. Ad
mittedly, Eastwood's character isn't particularly psychotic. But
how many preachers do you know that shoot their enemies
down in cold blood faster than they quote scripture? Decent,
but not on a par with either Eastwood's High Plains Drifter
or The Outlaw Josey Wales.
