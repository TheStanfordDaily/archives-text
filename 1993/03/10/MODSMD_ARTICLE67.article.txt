A whiff of spring
Hauntingly wispy, cotton-candyesque vocals and
chilled, floating guitar combine for a sound that fits
all too well behind a name like The Sundays.
Touring behind the release of their second album,
"blind," the British foursome brings their smooth
sound to the Warfleld on March 19.
With their debut album, "reading, writing and
arithmetic" that went gold, "blind" promises to
live up to the reputation The Sundays have built
for themselves. Reachingtmt to bolder directions
with the addition of more complex instrumenta
tion such as acoustics and strings — including a
cover of the Stone's "Wild Horses" — "blind" re
paints The Sunday's characteristic mystical at
mosphere. The Sundays definitely reek of Spring.
What better way to bury winter and welcome a
fresh season?
Tickets for The Sundays are $16.50 and are avail
able at BASS. The doors open at 7 p.m. for the 8 p.m.
show. Call the Warfleld at 775-7722 for more infor
mation.

So who won?
The annual Phi Kappa Psi Battle of the Bands Fri
day night held victory for Towhead, who ran away
with the best overall band award. The $250 purse
went to the six-member band that plays mostly origi
nals with an eclectic mix of ska, modern rock and
funk.
Towhead has played several campus parties this
year, including two dates at the CoHo, and will
continue to play the party scene with hopes of se
curing some off-campus gigs as well. According to
the band's head man, senior Josh Loftus, Towhead
is hoping to hit the studio to record an EP this
summer.
