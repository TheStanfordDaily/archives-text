# I prefer not to have an ASSU?
## COP may return, but few are interested in senate seats 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
For the first time in ASSU history, only one slate
of candidates is on the ballot for the Council of Pres
idents.
Other ASSU elections this spring will also be
marked by a significant decline in the number of
candidates, according to a tentative list released yes
terday.
In addition, this year's Council of Presidents —
"I Prefer Not to Have a COP" — reneged on a cam
paign promise by not submitting an amendment to
permanently remove the COP from the ASSU Con
stitution.
All offices showed a decrease in the number of
candidates this year. Only 25 students are running
for the 20 undergraduate senate spots this year,
compared to 42 candidates last year. Only four of
the senate hopefuls are incumbents.
Only six graduate students are running for the 20
graduate senator seats, and no one is running from
the Schools of Law, Business and Medicine. There
were 17 graduate candidates last year.
The remaining 14 graduate seats will be filled
through write-in votes, according to election com
missioner Tom Tsao.
The lone COP contender is "A Clean Slate:
Salaries Not Included," composed of current Senate
Chair Ron Brown, undergraduate senator Ying-
Ying Goh, Delia Lopez and Jason Snyder. All four
are juniors.
Brown, Lopez and Snyder ran on
the "Independents: A New Era"
platform last year but were defeat
ed by the Prefer slate.
A Clean Slate members say that,
if elected, they will turn down the
traditional COP salary of $5,000
per student per year.
"The main reason for not taking
salaries is the budgetary problems
of the ASSU," Goh said. "Usually,
only two lof the COP members] do
the work to warrant that salary."
Goh said that without a COP
this year, the importance of the
body became apparent.
"I have personally felt that the
senate, without a COP, has lacked
initiative and a strong sense of
direction," she said. "We've missed
an essential link with the adminis
tration and lost the ability to act on
student issues in an effective way."
Also appearing on the spring bal
lot is amendment to "make fee
refunds available to all students
regardless of whether they voted in
the ASSU election," said Tsao.

Perhaps more significant than
the amendment present is the one
missing. Although the Prefer slate
ran on a promise to abolish the
COP — which could only be accom
plished by a constitutional amend
ment — they have placed no such
amendment on the ballot.
Senior Jay Jackson, a member of
the Prefer slate, said the slate
thought it would be "kind of unfair
to put an amendment for the COP"
on the ballot, in case other slates
wanted to run for the position.
Initially, Jackson said, the slate
had hoped to call a special election
winter quarter to vote on whether
to have a COP. That idea was reject
ed when the ASSU told the Prefer
slate that the price for such an elec
tion would be $6,000, Jackson said.
No students ran for the SCLC,
which interprets the Fundamental
Standard. "This Vote's 4 You" is
the only slate in the race for Senior
Class Presidents. The slate is com
posed of juniors Sarah Rafanelli,
Peter Liang, Dana Weeks and
David Raymond.
Eleven senate candidates are
affiliated with the People's Plat
form party, 12 are independents
and the others listed no affiliation.
