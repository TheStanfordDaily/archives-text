# I prefer not to have an ASSU?
## COP may return, but few are interested in senate seats 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
For the first time in ASSU history, only one slate
of candidates is on the ballot for the Council of Pres
idents.
Other ASSU elections this spring will also be
marked by a significant decline in the number of
candidates, according to a tentative list released yes
terday.
In addition, this year's Council of Presidents —
"I Prefer Not to Have a COP" — reneged on a cam
paign promise by not submitting an amendment to
permanently remove the COP from the ASSU Con
stitution.
All offices showed a decrease in the number of
candidates this year. Only 25 students are running
for the 20 undergraduate senate spots this year,
compared to 42 candidates last year. Only four of
the senate hopefuls are incumbents.
Only six graduate students are running for the 20
graduate senator seats, and no one is running from
the Schools of Law, Business and Medicine. There
were 17 graduate candidates last year.
The remaining 14 graduate seats will be filled
through write-in votes, according to election com
missioner Tom Tsao.
The lone COP contender is "A Clean Slate:
Salaries Not Included," composed of current Senate
Chair Ron Brown, undergraduate senator Ying-
Ying Goh, Delia Lopez and Jason Snyder. All four
are juniors.
