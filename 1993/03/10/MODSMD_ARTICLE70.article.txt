Goat Brothers
By Larry Colton
Doublcday, 560 pp., $23.95
So what happens to frat boys
after they graduate, anyway? Ret
ributive suffering? Or do they be
come Rolex-wearing, Lexus-dri
ving business moguls who say
things like, "Greed is good?"
Larry Colton, former Kappa
Alpha brother at UC Berkeley, an
swers this question in "Goat
Brothers," a fast and entertaining
read that chronicles the real lives
of five golden boys — all jocks in
Kappa Alpha during the 1960s —
and how they deal with back-alley
abortions, crumbling marriages,
failed business ventures and Amer
ica in the throes of counterculture
and Vietnam.
The goat brothers (the term
lovingly applied to KA pledges)
are Larry, the author, Ron, Steve,
Loren and Jim — all big men on
campus or wanna be big men on
campus. They dismiss the typical
Berkeley beatnik as a long-haired
nerd, get sloshed whenever possi
ble and check out the coeds at civil
rights demonstrations. No Jean
Paul Sartres in this bunch, to be

sure, but they represent a diverse
and interesting group.
Ron Vaughn, onetime starting
end for the Bears, is one-eighth
black yet passes for white. He
pledges into KAs knowing that
they, like many frats of the time,
have a White Clause — a vow to
keep KAs an exclusively white
male club — and keeps quiet at the
mention of racial epithets. His
philosophy is "not to make race an
issue, not to rock the boat" by
simply expunging his black her
itage, as he's done all his life.
Like a scene from Greek
tragedy, however, Vaughn's at
tempts to erase his apparent flaw
make it only more painful: his girl
friend's family severs their rela
tionship when they hear about his
background and the sight of
Negro protestors in the South
makes him feel like a coward.
These and other emotional
problems — an illegitimate child
he abandons, a disintegrating fam
ily — forever place Vaughn on a
path where he must struggle with
poverty, depression and psychosis.
Easily the most haunting figure in
the book, Vaughn is clearly a vic
tim of a racist society that subtly
punishes blacks, even though all
obvious traces of prejudice seem

removed.
Lorcn Hawley, a football and
rugby star, appears to fit perfecdy
the "Animal House" mold. Con
standy grunting about how neces
sary it is to "be a man" and to be
tough, this Aryan giant refuses to
admit pain, beds a new woman
about every other paragraph and
can't seem to comprehend rela
tionships that extend beyond sex
or partying.
Steve Radich, another football
star, spends most of his time eye
ing women on Telegraph Avenue.
When he impregnates his home
town honey, Radich marries her in
a shotgun wedding, then com
pletely abandons his wife and son
to shack up with a long succession
of sorority girls.
Most of Radich's life continues
along these lines as he slowly
transforms from a beer-guzzling
frat boy into a vegetarian frat man
who subscribes to the Whole
Earth Catalog and is into "getting
close to nature."
Larry Colton and Jim van
Hoften are, after Vaughn, the
most interesting figures in "Goat
Brothers." Colton describes in
poignant and often hilarious detail
his inadequacy as a big man on
campus and his hopes of becoming

a major ball player and All-Ameri
can family man. After several failed
marriages and miserable attempts
at baseball glory, Colton slowly
puts his life back together and
struggles with being a parent in
the '80s and overcoming his shal
lowness.
Interestingly, Jim van Hoften,
the brother who despises fraterni
ty life the most, seems the most
successful — he becomes an engi
neer, a Top Gun pilot and, finally,
an astronaut. But, like the other
"goats" in the book, his life re
volves around being — and being
recognized as — a "man."
The women in "Goat Broth
ers" — the sorority "tomatoes,"
the girlfriends and wives — are
often the most fascinating figures
in the book. Similar themes are
played out again and again: the
woman sacrificing everything for
the man's career; the woman,
lonely and faithful, staying at
home while the boys play; the
woman trying to hold onto the re
lationship despite repeated infi
delities and emotional indiffer
ence.
These ladies suffer a lot at the
hands of the goat brothers, and
Colton lets them speak, often in
the form of heartrending letters

and journals. But the book still
leaves you wondering why they
put up with so much for so long
and how they find the strength to
carry on.
Colton has dished out a book
that entertains yet rings true.
Though his prose sometimes rush
es through moments that could
have been developed further —
like Steve's experiences as a marine
in Vietnam or Ron's harrowing
days as one of the cart-pushing
homeless in Los Angeles — it's
breezy, unpretentious and clear
writing that you can finish in a few
sittings.
Colton succeeds in illuminat
ing the lives of five human beings
without forcing us to like them
and makes us realize the pervasive
ness of the still-surviving Ameri
can obsession with being "a man."
Hiding your emotional prob
lems, treating women like crap
and equating stepping on others
with success are some of the
tenets of manhood that the guys
in "Goat Brothers" seem to fol
low, with all their attendant prob
lems. It's a book that should be
required reading for us bonehead
men and a handbook for Stanford
women on the ecology of the
American male. ■
