Can Poetry Matter P Essays on Poetry and
American Culture
By Dana Gioia
Graywolf Press, 193 pp., 512
"Can poetry matter?" It's certainly a
good question. Dana Gioia's book of the
same title would be even more interesting
if he answered it.
This collection of essays on American
poetry in the 20th century has its high
points and its medium ones. Unfortu
nately, most of the high points fall in the
first 50 pages, and the rest of the essays —
though interesting in their own right —
distract the reader from the book's titular
query.
The first essay, "Can Poetry Matter?,"
discusses the transformation of poetry
from a part of literary culture to a culture
of its own.
While statistics about poetry grants and
the growing role of poetry in academia
may imply that this is a "golden age of
American poetry," Gioia claims that this is,
in fact, far from the case.
He complains that the audience for po
etry has become purely eclectic and"the

energy of American poetry that was once
directed outward is now directed inward."
In other words, poets are writing for other
poets.
In Gioia's opinion, this not only in
hibits creativity — since poets in the same
circle will unconsciously imitate each
other's styles — but also negates the value
of poetic critiques.
Those writing about poetry are the
poets themselves and a "clubby" atmos
phere arises in which they are reluctant to
criticize their peers.
He also attacks the role of the universi
ty as the only romping ground for today's
poets. It not only contributes to the "club
biness," but "poetry sutlers when literary
standards are forced to conform to institu
tional ones," Gioia writes.
Unfortunately, these issues are not ex
pounded upon in the other essays. Aside
from a short piece on the "New Formal
ism," Gioia ignores movements such as the
beat generation and female poets like
Sylvia Plath and Adrienne Rich.
The remaining essays are dedicated to
close readings of the works of various indi
vidual poets, including Robinson leffers,
Weldon Kces, Ted Kooser, Wallace
Stevens, T.S. Eliot and Robert Bly. While
all are excellent pieces, they don't add up

to a cohesive picture.
Gioia states in his preface that the essays
were written over a long period of time.
This is evident when reading the selection
back to back.

As a collection of unique observations
on American poetry and the character it re
flects, the book is effective, but it is not the
thorough evaluation of art, culture and so
ciety that the title implies. ■
