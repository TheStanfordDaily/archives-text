Into the Garden: A Wedding Anthology
Edited by Robert Hass and Stephen
Mitchell
Harper Collins Publishers, 193 pp., $20
Though editor Robert Hass explains
that "Into the Garden: A Wedding Anthol
ogy" is a reference for couples searching for
verses to enhance their wedding cere
monies, anyone can enjoy this collection of
romantic poetry, from the Bible to Blake.
While love and marriage is the book's
theme, the works of Emily Dickinson,
Walt Whitman, Boris Paternak, Aristo
phanes, Robert Burns, e.e. cummings,
Dante, Robert Frost and (of course)

Shakespeare — to name only a few —
hold universal meanings.
An Apache song, an Abanaki song, an
Aboriginal Australian song and excerpts
from die Buddha and the Kabir add some
exotic flavor, while verses from the Song
of Songs and several Psalms remind us
that love and marriage is one of the oldest
institutions.
Moods vary from Burns' airily ro
mantic "My luve's like a red, red rose"
to Dickinson's tawdry "Wild Nights."
However, cynics should be warned
that the anthology is relentlessly pro
love. Hass and co-editor Stephen
Mitchell even seem to have found the
romantic sides of such typically intense
authors as Sylvia Plath and Ralph
Waldo Emerson. ■
