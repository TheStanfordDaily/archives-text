The Colors of Heaven: Short Stories
from the Pacific Rim
Edited by Trevor Carolan
Vintage Books, 312 pp., $11
Although Trevor Carolan
compiled his smorgasbord of con
temporary Asian-Pacific literature
for political reasons, he clearly
doesn't expect the reader to draw
anything more out of "The Col
ors of Heaven" than the reading
experience itself.
In his introduction to the an
thology, Carolan explains that
he initiated the book after South
Korean writer Kim Chi-Ha —
who had been persecuted by his
country's government for his
work — expressed the impor
tance of exposing the West to
Asian literature.
The result is a motley assort
ment of short stories that hail
from various Asian and South
Pacific countries, including
Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Carolan even includes stories
from Australia and New
Zealand, asserting that these
countries "increasingly view
themselves as members of the
Asian-Pacific community."
The stories range from
somber tales of post-World War
II life to random, existential
pieces to tongue-in-cheek mus
ings.
Any reader searching for a
common vein or single higher
statement in these pieces will
surely be puzzled, if not disap
pointed.
"There are no predictable
chestnuts here," Carolan warns.
"Each work offers unvarnished
insight into the human condition
of the Asian-Pacific Rim as it ex
ists now."
Sounds exotic, doesn't it?
Well, not exactly. Whether in
tentionally or not, Cardan's

story selections depart from the
"Oriental mystique" that is
often associated with Asian film
and literature.
There are no stilted, asexual
relations between men and
women; no bizarre, cult-like rit
uals; no shy, virginal, Madame
Butterfly-esque war brides or
subservient geisha girls.
The stories are frank, unre
pressed, often unabashedly sexu
al and — for the most part — to
tally unpredictable.
Zhu Lin's "The Festival of
Graves" describes political and
sexual power plays in modern
China's communist system, re
placing the stereotypical misty
veil of Orientalism with hard
edged confrontation and sar
casm.
One character, "Butch," is
hardly what readers would ex
pect to find in Asian-Pacific liter
ature: "He followed current
fashions, growing his hair long
like a girl, wearing jeans that
hugged his backside and talking

in slang that made him sound
like a gangster."
The myth that sex is a taboo
subject in Asian literature is also
shattered in many of the stories,
some of them even centering on
erotic themes.
Taiwanese writer Li Ang's
"Curvaceous Dolls" is a bizarre,
sensual and striking story narrat
ed by a woman as she lies in bed
with her husband from night to
night.
The narrator has a fierce fixa
tion on female breasts, reflecting
her obsession with both mater
nalism and lesbianism: "If only
her husband could grow breasts
like that on his chest, with
drooping nipples for her to suck
on! In a flash she realized what
was missing from his chest — of
course, a pair of breasts to lean
on and provide her with sanctu
r>
ary.
As her fetish becomes
stronger and more consuming,
the story takes on an eerie,
dream-like quality which blurs

the distinction between fantasy
and reality.
, In many of the stories, female
characters are outspoken and
bold, even in oppressive soci
eties. Perhaps this is because al
most half of the authors repre
sented are women.
M Mr. Tang's Girls" may seem
a typical story of a daughter who
has been forced into an arranged
marriage by her strict, polyga
mous father.
But Malaysian author Shirley
Geok-Lin Lim throws a few
twists into the daughter's char
acter that make her not only
complex, but also entertaining.
While Kim Li knows better
than to openly contest her dom
ineering father's decree, she uses
her emerging womanhood to
throw her father off" center —
and it works.
"It was good she was marry
ing soon, for her stance, her
glances, her whole appearance
indicated a lewd desire. He
turned his eyes away from her

and stayed in his room all
night."
Her father laments the "in
nate evil" of women, not fore
seeing the morbid dimensions
this "evil" will soon take in the
mind and body of the angry
young woman.
Although the rich variety of
"The Colors of Heaven" offers
something for every reader, its
shortcomings stem from the na
ture of translated text. The read
er never knows whether the am
biguity or awkwardness in the
language is a product of transla
tion or the original writer.
But for the most part, the
translations read smoothly and if
anything is missing, it does not
completely deaden the overall
impact of the collection.
Ironically — or perhaps pre
dictably — the two stories from
Australia and New Zealand are
the least satisfying. They seem
to be a forced addition, rather
than a natural component of the
anthology. ■
