Kitchen
By Banana Yoshimoto
Grove Books, 150 pp., $14.95
Banana Yoshimoto, the 24-
year-old author of "Kitchen," ap
pears on the cover of her first novel.
She's a beautiful product, complete
with cutsey white dress and smile.
Unfortunately, it's not her person,
but her writing that counts.
A colossal success in Japan,
"Kitchen" is divided into a novella
of the same tide and a short story,
"Moonlight Shadow."
The latter is a well-written but

somewhat trite account of a young
woman who has lost her teenaged
lover in a car accident. She takes up
jogging to forget her grief and lit
erally runs into Urara, a kind of
spiritual guide.
Because the story itself is fairly
predictable, Yoshimoto intro
duces several eccentric characters
to keep the reader interested. One
of the more memorable of these is
her dead lover's brother, who
wears the school uniform of his
own dead lover.
But even these characters
never escape from Yoshimo
to's awkward narrative voice.
Their clumsy dialogue pre-

'Together we
peer into the
cauldron of
hell'

vents them from ever becom
ing more than just words on
the page.
In addition, the author too
often relics on heavy-handed sym
bols to illustrate her themes. For
example, she describes a bell rung
by the dead lover and a river's

"too-distant chasm," which sepa
rates the protagonist from the
ghost of her lover.
In the novella, "Kitchen,*'
Yoshimoto introduces Mikage, a
young woman who lives with a
male friend and his transsexual
parent. Mikage is obsessed with
kitchens — the author reminds us
of this every third page — and
eventually becomes a cook.
As in "Moonlight Shadow,"
Yoshimoto's prose is burdened by
awkward dialogue and symbolism.
"Together we peer into the
cauldron of hell," one character
says. "We stare into the bubbling
sea of fire and the air hitting our

faces is so hot it makes us reel."
Overwrought language such as
this leadens any visual or emotion
al imagery present in the story.
Nevertheless, "Kitchen" offers
a compelling and fiercely non-tra
ditional look at Japanese culture
through the eyes of a modern
young woman. When Yoshimoto
describes her character's actions,
rather than their thoughts, she
writes with clarity and urgency.
In addition, many of the book's
problems could be the fault of its
translator. The literal translation
may have inadvertendy stripped
much of the power from Yoshimo
to's original language. ■
