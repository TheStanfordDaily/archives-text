# IN SEARCH OF A LOST GENERATION
## What do two Baby Boomers know about OUR GENERATION? Plenty.

They've been glamorized in Gap
ads, dramatized in Christian
Slater movies and fictionalized in
books like "Generation X." But
they don't even have a name.
It's an opportunity too perfect for any self
respecting Baby Boomer to resist: the chance to
name, categorize and infuse an entire demo
graphic with meaning and purpose.
In "13th Gen" (Vintage Books, $10),
Boomers Neil Howe and Bill Strauss take
an inclusive look at the group of teens to
thirtysomethings they call the "13th gener
ation" — America's 13th generation since
the founding fathers.
"We saw a real need to take this gener
ation and put them in a context in terms of
their age, location and attitudes," Howe
said, explaining that fictional accounts of
" 13ers" give them a "short compass treat
ment" that doesn't really describe them as
a group.
In their 222-page analysis of the 13ers,
Howe and Strauss examine the hows and
whys of the evolution of a "generation
with a PR problem," especially in compari
son with their parents, the Boomers.
Using graphs, quotes, cartoons and
countless generalizations, the authors con
struct a flattering, yet pessimistic picture of
the 13th generation. While touting them as
no-nonsense go-getters who know how to
make things happen, Howe and Strauss
also explore the multitude of problems —
such as drug use and unemployment —
that face the 13ers.
"We wanted to put it all together,
contextualize it, point out generational
analogies and even be so bold as to make
predictions," Howe said.
So he and Strauss began their
research: they scoured popular
magazines for ideas, interviewed
students for quotes and even
watched the requisite 12 minutes
of MTV.
But, as they began to write, several
telling problems arose. First of all, flashy
novels about rich kids leading exciting,
destructive lives arc much easier for 13cr
audiences to digest than a sociological text
that professes to be a guide to the way they
think.
Unlike the Boomers, Howe said,
"13ers are adverse to serious nonfictional
treatment of their own generation. They
don't want to get too heavy."
Secondly, 13ers have proven resistant
to the very concept of belonging to a
defined group. While identifying with their
peers was important to the Boomers,
Howe said, "the 13ers are very practical,
means-oriented. You'd never expect them
to care about being part of a generation."
Finally, 13ers may not appreciate being
assessed by two fortysomething Boomers.
The solution: write the book in 13er
terms. Unlike "Generations," the authors'
more scholarly 1991 book, "13th Gen" was
purposely worded to be "more accessible to
more people, in a manner fitting the sub
ject," Howe said.
Well-versed in "Wayne's World" and
They Might Be Giants lyrics, Howe and
Strauss do not simply describe 13crs as
"practical" or "active." Rather, they use
pop culture references as metaphors. A typi
cal paragraph reads: "Particle Man prefers
action over talk. . . . You'll find his motto
written on his sneaker pumps: Just Do It."
According to Howe, 13ers can rest easy
that "13th Gen" is not yet another attack
on their generation. Rather, the authors arc
highly critical of their own generation, call
ing its ideology antiquated and its members

"born whiners."
"We run against the grain of our gener
ation. We're constantly making fun of it,"
said Howe, who is generous in his praise of
the younger generation.
"What I don't like about Boomers is
what I like about the 13ers — a lack of pon
derousness," he said. "The Boomers are so
concerned about what things mean, putting
everything under these layers of symbolism,
that they don't get things done."
And Howe doesn't exempt himself from
his swipes at the Boomers. Only a Boomer,
with his inflated self-importance and need to
assign everything a "meaning," would have
written this book in the first place, he said.

"That's the way [Williams] is — a bit
cynical, standoffish," Howe said. "The
whole idea of a generation turned him off.
The Boomers made them sick of the idea of
a generation."
More input came from 13crs who read
the text on-line in American University's
computer system and responded through c
mail. Howe and Strauss also interviewed
several students in person, using their
quotes to supplement the book.
Most historians define Baby
Boomers as those born
between the years 1946
and 1964. The 13ers arc
the generation born after

last year of the G.I. generation bccausc a
person born in 1925 would not likely have
seen action during World War II — a for
mative experience for the G.l.s.
Similarly, 1961 is the cusp year
dividing the Boomers from the
13crs. The difference in this case is
that people brought up in the
1970s and 80s had vastly different
childhoods from those raised in the 60s.
"People in their late 20s and early 30s
don't identify with the Boomers," Howe
said. "Not only do they not feel like
Boomers, but if you call them Boomers,
they will throw something at you."
As a teaching assistant at Yale, Howe
noticed that "there's a huge difference in
attitudes between the students who went to
college during the Carter malaise and those
who did during the Reagan years."
In 1979, the entering freshmen were
suddenly very different from their predeces
sors. "The Boomers had an inner-driven
obnoxiousness and had trouble dealing with
adults. In the 1980s, though, the freshmen
were much more adult-like. There was no
more rebellion," Howe said.
"When I started talking, pens went to
paper," he added. The perennial question
was "Is this going to be on the exam?"
But unlike other Boomers who criticize
the 13ers for their apparent lack of "deep"
thought, Howe finds their attitude refreshing.
"They don't want to waste any ener
gy," he said. "They just want to survive.
Boomers tended to learn for learning's sake.
The 13er sees that as a total waste of time.
They can't afford to do it. They have a
greater sense of realism."
Despite the 20-year gap dividing the
youngest and the oldest of the 13ers, Howe
feels they belong to one generation.
"There's a belief that in order to
belong to a generation, you have to like
your generation — that's totally wrong.
You're condemned to it as long as you
live," he said.
While Howe concedes that there arc
real differences between the groups he labels
the "Atari-wavers" and the "Nintendo
wavers," he said they are more aware of the
differences between themselves and the
Boomers than those between each other.
This is is partly bccausc both "waves"
have so many behavioral statistics in common,
including higher crime and suicide rates and
lower SAT scores.
On the hand, there arc several positive
similarities among the 13crs. "They've seen
so many crusades of older people fail,"
Howe said, that "they have a capacity to be
acute observers, and know how to solve
problems without ideology."
He also emphasized the 13ers' greater
independence as compared with earlier gen
erations. "They're able to deal with freedom
and make their own decisions," he said.
"They have a distrust of institutions and a
yearning for a certain stability."
However, these very qualities have made
the 13crs the bane of older generations.
"Our style of adolescence is something
of a national curse," wrote one Newsweek
columnist who is quoted in the book.
"Americans arc growing up faster, but they
may not be growing up better."
Although the authors vehemently
defend the 13crs, Howe fears their efforts
may be in vain. "They may never shake off
the negative view the older generations have
of them," he said.
But, given what these 13crs have
learned growing up, Howe believes "they
can do enormous things for the next gener
ation." ■

Another tool the authors used to
complete the picture of the
13th generation involved a little
help from lan Williams, a
twentysomething graduate of
the University of North Carolina.
Williams read the text of "13th Gen" as
Howe and Strauss wrote it, making sarcastic
comments about the authors' claims along
the way. His remarks arc included in the
book as a graphic element, in the very
-1990s form of e-mail on a computer screen.
"Crasher," Williams' electronic alter
ego, undercuts almost everything the
"2boomers" have to say.
"Honestly, guys, I hate to ruin your
night, but none of us thinks about this gen
eration stuff," he writes. "I don't like giving
names to generations, period. It's like trying
to read the song title on a record that's
spinning."

them — the 13th generation born in
America.
But Howe firmly believes that the 13th
generation began in 1961, ending in 1981.
It's a small difference, but it illustrates how
distinct he feels each generation is.
In "Generations," Howe and Strauss
retell the entire history of America from the
viewpoint of different generations, starting
with the Puritans and ending with the
kindergartners of today.
Each generation, they postulate, is simi
lar to other ones that grew up in the same
environment. The 13ers of today, for exam
ple, arc very much like the "Lost
Generation" of American youth in the
19205.
The authors also define each generation
chronologically, setting certain years as
"cusp years" that divided one generation
from another. For example, 1924 was the

'IF YOU CALL THEM BOOMERS, THEY WILL THROW SOMETHING AT YOU.'
