Fast Sofa
By Bruce Craven
William Morrow, 352 pp., $14.95
"Fast Sofa," the latest in the
booming canon of twentysome
diing lit, offers hopeful evidence
that the trend is swiftly approaching
its nadir. If so, this novel will surely
drive another nail into the proverbial
coffin even as it sets Holden Cau
field a-tuming in his grave.
There's nothing fast or even
moderately swift about Bruce
Craven's pseudo-morality tale of
young uglics acting out their speed
metal-induced fantasies and frustra
tions in the cheerless, acid-washed
jcans-wearing Los Angeles suburb
of Burbank.
Craven's protagonist, Rick, is ob
viously supposed to be a rebel but
comes off as nothing more than a
big whiner. A former Division 111
basketball star and sometime dope
dealer, Rick spends most of his time
speaking in italics and obsessing over
Ginger Quail, his favorite porn star.
To no one's suiprise, Rick's much
neglected girlfriend, Tamara,
dumps him in the early pages of the
book.
Tamara is an aspiring actress
who's too tall to get decent parts.

Like any out-of-work thespian, she
waits tables and dreams of playing
Kate in"The Taming of the Shrew."
To paraphrase Keats, that's all we
know of Tamara — and all we need
to know.
Not one to wait by the phone,
Tamara instandy hooks up with
Rick's best friend, Jack, who com
pares her to Mary Ann on "Gilli
gan's Island." (The TV show is ap
parendy supposed to be some sort of
running theme in die novel.) Jack
has family problems and was once
on a daring game; like Tamara, he's
not a highly evolved character.
Meanwhile, Rick's sneering
bravado goes into overdrive: "So
what if it was tough to breathe? At
least L.A. knew how to party. And
when we go down ... we'll go
down big. And not fucking whine
about it like a bunch of San Francis
co hippies. No, we'll just lift our
brews and say, Sure!"
But when someone breaks into
Rick's apartment, stealing his drug
stash and choice bits of his CD col
lection, desperation sets in. On a
classic twentysomediing whim, Rick
hits the highway to Palm Springs —
and Ginger.
Their subsequent affair is as
tawdry as it is implausible. There's
just nothing sexy about a guy who
appreciates a good ethnic joke or
drive-by shooting and thinks that

'So what if it
was tough to
breathe? At
least L.A.
knew how to
party. And
when we go
down
well go
down big.
And not
fucking
whine about
it like a
bunch of San
Francisco
hippies. No,
we'll just lift
our brews
and say,
Sure!'

"the only reason to have cops is
'cause of those real-life TV cop
shows."
But Ginger is such a blatant sym
bol of wish-fulfillment that not even
Rick is fooled. "Where'd they raise
girls like Ginger?" he asks. "Proba
bly out on some bimbo ranch.
Force-fed a steady diet of crystal
meth, cottage cheese and Scope."
Despite a few such well-placed
bon mots, Craven's rapid-fire, hit
and-miss prose misses more often
than it hits. But his disjointed narra
tive is only one of the book's many
evils.
How many evils? Let me count
the "ways." Craven's characters
seem to have learned English by
watching Rob Lowe movies. Every
other sentence contains such out
dated slang terms as "crucial,"
"heinous" and the übiquitous
"way." Even for Burbank, this is a
bit excessive.
But it's not as annoying as
Craven's funkier semantics. The
LA. traffic is not just heavy, but
"nasty with persistence." In one of
many bedroom scenes, Jack "moves
his hand to the soft parable of
[Tamara's] hip, running his finger
across the pink serration beneath the
elastic of her black skirt." No won
der the damn thing is 352 pages
long.
The book's length certainly isn't

justified by its content — indeed,
the characters are so boring and/or
unpleasant that one wonders why
Craven bothers to write about them
at all.
Rick, the most pervasive charac
ter, is also the most problematic. An
unlikely hero to begin with, Rick
forfeits any sympathy he might have
gained with his everything-sucks at
titude. It's hard to feel sorry for a
character that even the author seems
to ridicule.
But it's even harder to sympa
thize with an author who thinks he's
superior to his material. Rick is de
liberately duminified, a model of
cultural ignorance. Although we're
supposed to be in on the joke,
there's nothing more obvious than
forced stupidity.
The well-meaning publishers
madly compensate for the
novel's many shortcomings with
cheesy promotional gimmicks —
including slick cover art, bold il
lustrations, eternal font changes
and a floppy 45 by "The
Flesheaters."
The end result is a humorless
"Generation X" rip off with explicit
sex and adult language. I'm still not
quite sure what the tide means, but
it sounds cool and cool is obviously
a priority in Craven's own personal
Hell — even when it comes at the
expense of art. ■

Despite a few such well-placed
bon mots, Craven's rapid-fire, hit
and-miss prose misses more often
than it hits. But his disjointed narra
tive is only one of the book's many
evils.
How many evils? Let me count
the "ways." Craven's characters
seem to have learned English by
watching Rob Lowe movies. Every
other sentence contains such out
dated slang terms as "crucial,"
"heinous" and the übiquitous
"way." Even for Burbank, this is a
bit excessive.
But it's not as annoying as
Craven's funkier semantics. The
LA. traffic is not just heavy, but
"nasty with persistence." In one of
many bedroom scenes, Jack "moves
his hand to the soft parable of
[Tamara's] hip, running his finger
across the pink serration beneath the
elastic of her black skirt." No won
der the damn thing is 352 pages
long.
The book's length certainly isn't

justified by its content — indeed,
the characters are so boring and/or
unpleasant that one wonders why
Craven bothers to write about them
at all.
Rick, the most pervasive charac
ter, is also the most problematic. An
unlikely hero to begin with, Rick
forfeits any sympathy he might have
gained with his everything-sucks at
titude. It's hard to feel sorry for a
character that even the author seems
to ridicule.
But it's even harder to sympa
thize with an author who thinks he's
superior to his material. Rick is de
liberately duminified, a model of
cultural ignorance. Although we're
supposed to be in on the joke,
there's nothing more obvious than
forced stupidity.
The well-meaning publishers
madly compensate for the
novel's many shortcomings with
cheesy promotional gimmicks —
including slick cover art, bold il
lustrations, eternal font changes
and a floppy 45 by "The
Flesheaters."
The end result is a humorless
"Generation X" rip off with explicit
sex and adult language. I'm still not
quite sure what the tide means, but
it sounds cool and cool is obviously
a priority in Craven's own personal
Hell — even when it comes at the
expense of art. ■
Fast Sofa
By Bruce Craven
William Morrow, 352 pp., $14.95
"Fast Sofa," the latest in the
booming canon of twentysome
diing lit, offers hopeful evidence
that the trend is swiftly approaching
its nadir. If so, this novel will surely
drive another nail into the proverbial
coffin even as it sets Holden Cau
field a-tuming in his grave.
There's nothing fast or even
moderately swift about Bruce
Craven's pseudo-morality tale of
young uglics acting out their speed
metal-induced fantasies and frustra
tions in the cheerless, acid-washed
jcans-wearing Los Angeles suburb
of Burbank.
Craven's protagonist, Rick, is ob
viously supposed to be a rebel but
comes off as nothing more than a
big whiner. A former Division 111
basketball star and sometime dope
dealer, Rick spends most of his time
speaking in italics and obsessing over
Ginger Quail, his favorite porn star.
To no one's suiprise, Rick's much
neglected girlfriend, Tamara,
dumps him in the early pages of the
book.
Tamara is an aspiring actress
who's too tall to get decent parts.

Like any out-of-work thespian, she
waits tables and dreams of playing
Kate in"The Taming of the Shrew."
To paraphrase Keats, that's all we
know of Tamara — and all we need
to know.
Not one to wait by the phone,
Tamara instandy hooks up with
Rick's best friend, Jack, who com
pares her to Mary Ann on "Gilli
gan's Island." (The TV show is ap
parendy supposed to be some sort of
running theme in die novel.) Jack
has family problems and was once
on a daring game; like Tamara, he's
not a highly evolved character.
Meanwhile, Rick's sneering
bravado goes into overdrive: "So
what if it was tough to breathe? At
least L.A. knew how to party. And
when we go down ... we'll go
down big. And not fucking whine
about it like a bunch of San Francis
co hippies. No, we'll just lift our
brews and say, Sure!"
But when someone breaks into
Rick's apartment, stealing his drug
stash and choice bits of his CD col
lection, desperation sets in. On a
classic twentysomediing whim, Rick
hits the highway to Palm Springs —
and Ginger.
Their subsequent affair is as
tawdry as it is implausible. There's
just nothing sexy about a guy who
appreciates a good ethnic joke or
drive-by shooting and thinks that

'So what if it
was tough to
breathe? At
least L.A.
knew how to
party. And
when we go
down
well go
down big.
And not
fucking
whine about
it like a
bunch of San
Francisco
hippies. No,
we'll just lift
our brews
and say,
Sure!'

"the only reason to have cops is
'cause of those real-life TV cop
shows."
But Ginger is such a blatant sym
bol of wish-fulfillment that not even
Rick is fooled. "Where'd they raise
girls like Ginger?" he asks. "Proba
bly out on some bimbo ranch.
Force-fed a steady diet of crystal
meth, cottage cheese and Scope."
Despite a few such well-placed
bon mots, Craven's rapid-fire, hit
and-miss prose misses more often
than it hits. But his disjointed narra
tive is only one of the book's many
evils.
