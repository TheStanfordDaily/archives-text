Everything Looks Impressive
By Hugh Kennedy
Doubleday, 272 pp., $10
I'm glad I didn't go to Yale.
A university where the only ap
parent liberals are radical lesbians
and poor freshmen who don't have
any friends, Yale is the setting of
Hugh Kennedy's debut novel,
"Everything Looks Impressive.*'
Freshman Alex Mac Donald is a
poor boy determined to leave his
past behind and find life and love in
the midst of wealth.
But Mac Donald's problems go
far beyond finding lunch dates and
learning to adjust to his room
mate's live-in girlfriend. He's
hopelessly in love with senior Jill
Lannigan, a lesbian with a serious
commitment to political issues.
From the beginning, Kennedy
portrays lannigan as a radical who
will do anything for a cause.
a I met Jill Lannigan on the last
day she ever pimped for Yale,"
reads the opening line of the book,
as Mac Donald launches his college

career with a description of the
woman who affects it most.
Superficially, Yale looks a lot
like Stanford through Mac Do
nald's eyes, from the residential
grouping of the conservative jock,
the fourth generation Yalie and the
impoverished liberal to the orien
tation week "Camp Yale," with its
tables of extracurricular groups
looking to suck in freshmen.
But the novel seems to take
place in the past, rather than the
present. Although Kennedy grad
uated from Yale in 1987, he's al
ready out of touch with the con
cerns of college students. For ex
ample, despite several references to
sexuality and the sexual act, there's
no discussion of sexually transmit
ted diseases.
Kennedy's characters seem
more like one-dimensional stereo
types than actual college students.
The radical feminist, the intolerant
jock and the hometown honey are
all a little too close to cardboard to
evoke much emotion.
Although his unhappy past as a
day student at an exclusive board
ing school should make Mac Do
nald a naturally sympathetic charac

ter, he seems foolish when taken in
by the tricks of his more sophisti
cated friends.
For example, when his room
mates ditch him at parties, Mac-
Donald barely raises an eyebrow.
Even when Lannigan tricks him
into sleeping over so her parents
will think she's heterosexual, Mac-
Donald's anger is short-lived.
But his gullibility and constant
indecision make Mac Donald more
lively than the rest of Kennedy's
cast; indeed, he's the one character
who's not completely predictable.
In the end, despite the differ
ences between Yale and Stanford,
the similarities between them shine
through as Mac Donald faces the
deeper dilemma of who he is and
what he believes.
"The space between tolerance
and acceptance of anything can be
enormous," he reflects. "Even at
Yale."
A novel that strives for more
than entertainment, "Everything
Looks Impressive" leaves readers
wondering how "impressive" their
own ideals are and how large the
gap between tolerance and accep
tance is in their own lives. ■
