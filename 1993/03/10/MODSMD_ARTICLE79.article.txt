For centuries, people have been
drinking coffee. But it's only re
cently that they've been shelling
out $3.95 per cup for such exotic
brews as Cappuccino Royale,
Espresso con Panna, Mochaccino
and Latte Macchiato.
"Whereas people were once
just interested in having a standard
cup of coffee, now they're order
ing specialty drinks," writes Math
ew Tekulsky in "Making Your
Own Gourmet Coffee Drinks."
According to Tekulsky, even
decaf is enjoying newfound social
acceptability, thanks to consumer
demand for better-quality beans.
And, as coffee prices rise with its
popularity, coffee drinkers arc in

creasingly taking theirs the old
fashioned way — in the privacy
and comfort of their own homes.
A cookbook-cum-coffee trivia
trove, "Making Your Own
Gourmet Coffee Drinks" offers
tantalizing recipes and tips for
turning your own (or your
dorm's) kitchen into a coffee
house.
With chapter titles like "A Word
About Filters" and "Grinding Cof
fee the Right Way," the book is
chock full of advice on choosing
beans and roasts, brewing coffee
("always use fresh water") and
storing grounds (60°F is the opti
mum temperature).
Tekulsky's prose is as light and
fluffy as a good cup of latte:
"While steaming milk may seem
rather awkward at first, with just a
little bit of practice you'll really get
the hang of it, and before long you
should become an expert!"
He fearlessly probes the fla
vored-bean trend and lovingly de

lineates the subde differences be
tween chemical and Swiss decafs.
Some of his hints, while helpful,
are rather alarming:
"This drink is best consumed
immediately.'"
"Serve this drink right away,
before it has time to settle."
"This drink is refreshing and
surprisingly strong."
More than 100 drinks are lov
ingly recreated, from basic Cafe au
Lait to extra-strength Turkish
Coffee (grounds included) and a
12-serving, 11-ingredient Coffee
Grog.
Although gourmet coffee usu
ally means espresso, most of
Tekulsky's recipes call for good,
old-fashioned brewed coffee —
hot, cold or spiked.
Hot and cold espresso drinks
abound as well. Either way, you'll
need a coffee maker of some kind,
or a friend with one. You'll also
need a little patience — that per
fect froth doesn't just happen by

itself, you know.
Some of the ingredients called
for are rather exotic, not to men
tion caloric. Plan on extra trips to
Safeway for such delicacies as
heavy cream, vanilla beans, con
fectioners' sugar, cardamom seeds
and — for garnish — cinnamon
sticks.
Obviously a purist, Tekulsky
takes his coffee seriously. You won't
find any Cappuccino Choo-Choos
in diis collection. The Chocolate-
Vanilla Coffee, for example, is just
that: coffee, chocolate syrup and
vanilla extract. Half the fun of
"Making Your Own Gourmet Cof
fee Drinks" lies in christening your
creation after, say, your favorite
James Bond movie.
Although most of the recipes
make one serving, it's doubtful
diat anyone but the author could
stop at just one cup. Any beverage
that involves saucepans or preheat
ing the oven is probably not worth
the effort for a few measly ounces

of Joe.
The sheer number of recipes
guarantees something for every
palate, though not every drink will
appeal to every drinker.
My willing assistant and I got
sloshed on Chocolate Espresso
Crush, but shied away from the
Tropical Coffee Delight, made
with kiwi, coconut and papaya
nectar. Likewise the chicory-laced
New Orleans Coffee and — for
obvious reasons — the Yogurt
Coffee Shake.
The Cafe Borgia was cold by the
time we finished grating the orange
peel, but die Rum Coffee Soda
didn't seem to suffer from our sub
stitution of Sprite for Canada Dry.
For all its variety, there's noth
ing here to equal die CoHo's
Hazelnut Mocha or Chocolatc
Frosty Mint. But, for a litde more
effort and a lot less expense,
"Making Your Own Gourmet
Coffee Drinks" comes pretty
close. ■
