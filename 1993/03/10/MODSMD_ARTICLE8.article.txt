# Stanford to appeal for funding
## University to ask federal agency for more quake-repair money 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
After more than three years of stalled negoti
ations, Stanford will file appeals next month to
obtain more earthquake-repair aid than federal
officials have previously proposed.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency
— which was created to assist individual resi
dences, public schools and nonprofit institutions
damaged in natural disasters by funding 75 per
cent of their repair costs — has estimated that
Stanford's earthquake repairs will cost about
$38 million.
This is far short, though, of the $120-million
price tag University officials anticipate for the re
pairs and strengthening of the structures dam
aged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Stanford and the agency disagree over fund
ing amounts for 10 campus buildings — gener
ally the ones which incurred the most damage,
said Valerie Veronin, the acting director of facili
ties project management.
"The crux of the problem is that we cannot
agree over the necessary repairs," she said.
According to the FEMA inspector general's
report on its Region IX agency, which oversees
California, the agency thought the repair plans
first submitted by the University were too ex
pensive.
The University, however, contends that it is
proposing only the minimum amount of repairs.

During the summer of 1990, construction crews
worked to repair the archways in the Inner Quad, which
sustained damage in the Loma Prieta Earthquake of
1989. The quake registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
