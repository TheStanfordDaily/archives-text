# Stanford to appeal for funding
## University to ask federal agency for more quake-repair money 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
After more than three years of stalled negoti
ations, Stanford will file appeals next month to
obtain more earthquake-repair aid than federal
officials have previously proposed.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency
— which was created to assist individual resi
dences, public schools and nonprofit institutions
damaged in natural disasters by funding 75 per
cent of their repair costs — has estimated that
Stanford's earthquake repairs will cost about
$38 million.
This is far short, though, of the $120-million
price tag University officials anticipate for the re
pairs and strengthening of the structures dam
aged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Stanford and the agency disagree over fund
ing amounts for 10 campus buildings — gener
ally the ones which incurred the most damage,
said Valerie Veronin, the acting director of facili
ties project management.
"The crux of the problem is that we cannot
agree over the necessary repairs," she said.
According to the FEMA inspector general's
report on its Region IX agency, which oversees
California, the agency thought the repair plans
first submitted by the University were too ex
pensive.
The University, however, contends that it is
proposing only the minimum amount of repairs.

During the summer of 1990, construction crews
worked to repair the archways in the Inner Quad, which
sustained damage in the Loma Prieta Earthquake of
1989. The quake registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
"We're asking FEMA for the least
costly fix to get past the minimum coun
ty codes," said Cindy Bedont, the associ
ate director of government relations.
"It's in our interest to keep costs down —
after all, we have to pay for 25 percent of
it."
The University has hoped to avoid fil
ing appeals because the process is long
and complicated, Bedont said. However,
because an agreement is still unlikely,
the University has decided to appeal and
must file a separate appeal for each of the
10 structures.
These include Green Library, the Art
Museum, Terman Annex, Hanna House,
the Knoll, and Buildings 30, 260, 300,
310, 320 and 370.
According to Veronin, repairs have
already been made on many of other 240
damaged University buildings.
The University has already received
about $11.8 million from the agency,
which has gone mostly to emergency
work, small repairs and temporary build
ings such as the Galvez and Wilbur mod
ules.
Veronin would not say how much
more money the University hopes to get
if the appeals are successful.
The appeals process has three levels —
regional, federal and to the agency's
director. The University's appeal is at the
regional level. The agency has 90 days to
respond to the appeal, plus another 90
days if it needs more information.
But if the University must go through
all three levels of appeals, the whole pro
cess could take several years, said Jean
Barnes, an administrator for Stanford's
earthquake-recovery program.
Complying with county codes
Another problem plaguing the negoti

ations between the University and the
agency is that the Santa Clara County
Building Inspection Office refuses to let
the University open the buildings under
alternate repair plans proposed by
FEMA.
When the agency first assessed the
University's earthquake damage, it based
its damage survey reports on the studies
performed by Stanford consultants, who
said the buildings required seismic
strengthening.
Then, between March and June of
1990, the agency reinvestigated the dam
age and lowered its cost estimates.
The agency's new study said a much
smaller number of buildings required
seismic strengthening. For the other
buildings, the agency proposed a plan to
use a less expensive method of putting
epoxy grouting into the cracks in the
buildings.
However, the county building inspec
tion office said FEMA's proposal would
not pass building code requirements.
"The epoxy method is basically unac
ceptable," said Thomas Shih, manager of
the Santa Clara County Building Inspec
tion Office.
"My responsibility is to make sure
these buildings meet the minimum
requirements," he said, stating that the
epoxy-grouting method does not meet
those requirements. Simply filling in the
cracks is "just hiding the problem," he
said.
An inspection report issued by
FEMA's inspector general last month
termed such situations — in which local
building officials prevent the completion
of projects the agency has already
approved — a "hostage" situation.
The agency disagrees with both Stan
ford and the building inspector over how
to interpret the building codes.
"Stanford says one thing applies,

while FEMA says another thing applies,"
said Frank Kishton, the agency's region
al deputy chief for disaster assistance
programs.
Since FEMA has no specific polity to
deal with these situations, disputed pro
jects such as Stanford have remained at a
standstill.
In an effort to resolve the situation,
the agency has requested its general
counsel's legal opinion on the interpreta
tion of the building code, which Kishton
said he should receive "any day now."
Until the agency has the final draft
of the legal opinion, though, Kishton
said no action will be taken. He
declined to speculate on what the agen
cy will do.
Shih said FEMA has only once given
his office acceptable alternate plans for
Stanford buildings, two years ago. The
agency submitted a cheaper alternative
design plan for the Language Corner in
the Quad that the building inspection
office accepted.
Since then, Shih said he has not heard
from agency officials. Nothing can be
done, he said, because "they're not giving
me alternate plans."
Veronin said FEMA has also not pro
posed any new plans to the University.
Repairs to continue
Because it may take several years for
the appeals to be processed, University
officials said they will go ahead with
some of the construction, despite the
fact that the University may not be
reimbursed.
"We're going to go ahead with the
appeal and with construction," Veronin
said, because departments that have to
run their programs out of modules are
being hurt.
Even if the appeals fail, the Universi
ty eventually plans to repair all the

buildings.
However, because of the stalemate
in negotiations, construction on Uni
versity buildings will progress slowly,
she said. "We can't afford to repair all
our buildings at the same time," she
said.

"We can't leave the buildings the way
they are. At some point, we'll have to do
the repairs. It's not required by the coun
ty codes, but Stanford needs these build
ings," said Fouad Bendimerad, the man
ager of seismic engineering in the facili
ties office.

The Loma Prieta earthquake wreaked major havoc on the historic Green Library, forc
ing the closure of the entire west section. Because negotiations between the Universi
ty and the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the cost of repairing 10 cam
pus buildings have stalled, Stanford will file appeals next month to increase the amount
of earthquake-repair funding. Meanwhile, repairs continue at sluggish pace.
