A Song for Arbonne
By Guy Gavriel Kay
Crown Books, 528 pp., $20

Without a good gimmick to
spice up the standard medieval set
ting, a fantasy novel is hardly
worth reading. Canadian author
Guy Gavriel Kay adds a feminist
religion in a A Song for Arbonne,"
but his rather derivative recipe
makes for a less-than-tasty result.
For a 513-page tome, Kay's ef
fort is surprisingly insubstantial.
The story is fairly absorbing, a few
of the characters interesting, but
in the end it's easy to cast "Ar
bonne" aside as if it were a cheap
paperback romance.
Against the generic backdrop
of castles and sword fights, the
"sun-blessed" country of Ar
bonne thrives under the rule of its
countess. The citizens cherish
their musicians and pray to both
"the god" and"the goddess."
This is the good country.

Gorhaut is the bad country.
Just to make sure we get it, Kay
portrays its king, Ademar, address
ing his counselors with a "half
clothed woman kneeling on the
stone floor in front of him with his
sex in her mouth."
The very unpleasant Ademar
also intends to rape a married
woman, Rosala, who is inconve
niently pregnant. The other men
in Gorhaut aren't much more en
lightened. Rosala's father-in-law
plans to take her child away. And,

for good measure, we're told that
the women of Gorhaut can be
whipped to death for merely being
rude to a knight in public.
Rosala wisely leaves the coun
ty
Hiding out in the countess'
castle, Rosala encounters a famil
iar, ruggedly handsome face.
Blaise, our hero, is a product of
Gorhaut who ends up a merce
nary in Arbonne. He's a manly
man with nothing but scorn for
his whipped hosts. But not to
worry — he's got a sensitive streak
that's bound to turn him into a
feminist goddess-worshipper be
fore long.
However, none of the charac
ters are very complex. There's
poor Duke Bertran, mourning the
love who died years ago; Rosala,
who docs little but wander
around the castle; and Galbert,
Blaise's father, who for unex
plained reasons hates the goddess
with a passion.
The women in Blaise's life are
even worse. The ex-lover who
hurt him and the new one who
comforts him arc unremarkable
stereotypes. When Lisseut, the
feisty minstrel, appears, there's
hope that she'll become an ap
pealing character. But Kay drops
her quickly and she has little
more to do with the story.
The only truly moving scene in
the novel finds an old musician
singing about his love for Ar
bonne. Other vignettes have the
potential for some sort of emo
tional impact but, unfortunately,
never fulfill it.
For example, the tension be
tween Blaise and his father
could have been poignant if Gal
bert wasn't such an unre
deemable ass. Kay paints him as
an utterly evil man, without pro
viding so much as a childhood
trauma to explain his heartless
behavior.
The novel's misogynist images
would be more disturbing if the
countries weren't so blatantly
black and white. A little subtlety
would go a long way in "Ar
bonne," which finally centers on

the conflict between the two cul
tures.
An adventure on the goddess'
island, a few swordfights, an assas
sination attempt and plenty of
singing fill most of the novel as it
builds toward the inevitable clash
of good and evil.

'Arbonne'

Two motifs sound especially
disturbing notes in "Arbonne."
First, for such a liberated country,
the women don't even choose
who they marry. Despite a count
ess and a goddess, the men are def
initely in charge here — it's Blaise
who finally leads Arbonne's army
against his homeland.
Second, the novel's attitude
toward homosexuality is less than
progressive. A neighboring coun
try called Arimonda is referred to
as a "land of incestuous
catamites" and its two representa
tives arc exceedingly unsavory
characters. The first threatens to
rape Blaise before killing him,
while the other would rather kill
him first.
Although much is made of the
country's goddess worship, the
book doesn't provide more than
the barest glimpse of Arbonne's
religion, and that glimpse is
through Blaise's eyes. Kay simply
raises the gender issue to further
his plot, when he could have used
the creative possibilities of the fan
tasy genre to give the war between
the sexes a new and revealing
twist.
Other authors — such as Mari
on Zimmer Bradley, Ursula K. Le
Guin and Sherri S. Tcppcr — have
done just that in rich, satisfying
novels. Before filling up on the
rather fluffy "Arbonne," fantasy
fans would be wise to try meatier
fare. ■
