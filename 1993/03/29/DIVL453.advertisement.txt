lake a good look at IBM. A look at the
facts instead of the furor. And what you'll see
is one of the most solid, dynamic companies
the world has ever known.
Last year alone our growth in commercial
services was four times the industry average.
Our patent portfolio has grown to 30,000
patents worldwide â€”by far the industry's
largest. And our $6.5 billion research and
development budget is a full three times the
size of our nearest U.S. competitor.

companies anywhere can offer you the
excitement or the possibilities of IBM. And
that the world's biggest computer company is
still home to some of the world's biggest
opportunities.
