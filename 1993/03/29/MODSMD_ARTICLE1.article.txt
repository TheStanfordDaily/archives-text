fended its NCAA team champi
onship at the University of Indi
ana Natatorium in Indianapolis
with a total score of 520.5 points.
Michigan finished second with
396 points followed by Texas with
326 points and Arizona with 263
points. The host team, Indiana,
tied for 41st place with Penn
State.
In addition to the team trophy,
the Cardinal squad produced
three first-place relay finishes,
three individual championship ti
tles and enough national finalists
to consider the meet a smashing
success.
Stanford kicked off the meet
with an explosive 200-yard
freestyle relay victory from the
team of Bill Schell, Erik Maurer,
Tyler Mayfield, and Joe Hude
pohl. After Hudepohl entered the
water behind UCLA's Christo
pher Mann and managed to out
touch the strong Bruin sprint
squad, the snowball of Cardinal
points began to accumulate.
Junior Trip Zedlitz followed
the relay title with a strong sec
ond place in the 200 individual
