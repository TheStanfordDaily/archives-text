They came, they shaved, they
conquered.
Last weekend the Stanford
men's swim team successfully de
fended its NCAA team champi
onship at the University of Indi
ana Natatorium in Indianapolis
with a total score of 520.5 points.
Michigan finished second with
396 points followed by Texas with
326 points and Arizona with 263
points. The host team, Indiana,
tied for 41st place with Penn
State.
In addition to the team trophy,
the Cardinal squad produced
three first-place relay finishes,
three individual championship ti
tles and enough national finalists
to consider the meet a smashing
success.
Stanford kicked off the meet
with an explosive 200-yard
freestyle relay victory from the
team of Bill Schell, Erik Maurer,
Tyler Mayfield, and Joe Hude
pohl. After Hudepohl entered the
water behind UCLA's Christo
pher Mann and managed to out
touch the strong Bruin sprint
squad, the snowball of Cardinal
points began to accumulate.

medley behind Florida's Olympic silver
medalist Greg Burgess. Burgess set his first
of two American records in the event. Later,
Schell, Hudepohl and Maurer nailed three of
the top-eight spots in the 50 free. In winning
the hotly contested title, David Fox from
North Carolina State eclipsed Olympian
Matt Biondi's NCAA record of 19.15 seconds
by .01.
Though Fox warned everyone that he
was "just getting started," so were
Mayfield, Hudepohl and the sign-waving
slew of Stanford fans. Content with neither
a single relay title nor a shaky Stanford per
formance during the qualifying heats,
Mayfield and Hudepohl combined with
Zedlitz and backstroke specialist Derek
Weatherford to crush the competition in the
closing 400 medley relay. Knocking more
than five seconds off the Cardinal qualifying
time, the foursome stepped up and
destroyed a star-studded Michigan squad by
almost three seconds.
With that performance, Stanford took a
commanding step toward the team title,
establishing a 54-point lead after the first
day of competition.
Unfortunately, Stanford opened and
closed the next day of competition with dis
appointing losses in the 200 medley and 800
free relays. The Cardinal medley relay was
nipped by Arizona 1:27.01 to 1:27.06, as the
free relay fell behind midway through the
race and never managed to gain a lead over
squads from Michigan and Texas.
"Both those relays were a little disap
pointing," said Stanford head coach Skip
Kenney. "If we had gotten off the [starting]
blocks like we're capable of, we'd have won.
The 800 free is one of the hardest relays ...
[our swimmers] were tired and needed to
reach inside to find something that just
wasn't there — two teams did that better
than we did."
Kenney wasn't the only one to admit his
team was tired. "The second morning of
NCAAs is always the toughest," said
Weatherford, a member of both relays.
"We're all just a little more tired, but I know
I have a lot of speed left in me."
Weatherford made good on his threat.
Dramatic victories by Weatherford in the
100 backstroke and Tyler Mayfield in the
100 breaststroke gave the Cardinal its first
two individual titles of the meet, tucking the
team championship safely out of reach.
Mayfield's winning time of 53.07 was the
third-fastest time ever recorded in the event.
Other solid second-day swims came from
Zedlitz, who finished second and third in the
100 butterfly and 100 back, respectively,
and Stanford sophomore Dan Kanner, who
placed fourth in the 200 free. Texas
Longhorn Josh Davis fended off a second
half surge by Joe Hudepohl to grab the
national championship in the 200 free.
Hudepohl finished second in the event with
a personal-best 1:34.31.
Team co-captain J.J. Freitag also lent
strong support by placing sixth in the 100
breast, and Stanford enjoyed a 100-point
lead going into the last day of the meet.
The final day of competition was the icing
on the cake, so to speak. Stanford not only
celebrated senior Chas Morton's birthday,
but also an individual win from sophomore
Ray Carey, a third relay title and the clinch
ing of its second-consecutive national team
championship.
Carey, the consolation heat champion in
the 400 IM, lowered his qualifying time of
1 44.17 to 1:44.01 en route to claiming the
200 butterfly title by almost a full second
over Brian Gunn of Michigan. Conceding he
"was a little distracted in the morning
[swim]," Carey took a half-second lead on
the field halfway during the final and never
looked back.
Members of Stanford's "B-crew" also
added considerably to the Cardinal point total
in the 200 breast. Alter qualifying first in tri
als, sophomore Kurt Grote finished third in
finals, behind teammate Tyler Mayfield and
winner Eric Wunderlich of Michigan.

Stanford senior Erik Maurer's swan song
came in the final event of the meet, the 400
free relay. Feeding off of a slight edge estab
lished by Hudepohl and Zedlitz, Maurer
split a quick 43.08, handing anchor Derek
Weatherford a full 6-foot-8 body-length lead.
Alone in front of the field, Weatherford
cruised to a third Stanford relay title as the
Cardinal wrapped up its championship in
grand style.
Ironically enough, coach Kenney had to
all but order his squad to enjoy its 100-point
lead going into the last day of competition.
Though most programs would have consid
ered the meet a tremendous success, many
from the Stanford contingent felt that their
performance was "less than perfect."
"We're winning by over a hundred points
and we should be enjoying it," Kenney said
before the last preliminary session. "Our
expectations are so high that [yesterday's]
third [in the 800 free relay] was a disap
pointment — that's how Stanford students
are, and the national swimming champi
onships aren't any exception."
This year's team has also faced the bur
den of comparison with last year's record
setting squad and other outstanding teams
from the early '80s. "Last year was sort of a
magic year for us," Carey said. "The meet
went perfect. This year it didn't go perfect
— but it went well."
"We've always lived in the shadow of the
teams of '85, '86 and '87, so we're always
trying to do them one up," Weatherford
noted.
Though this year's meet did have some
disappointing swims, Stanford's overall per
formance was far from flawed. Points were
scored in the meet from first through 16th
place, and a large bulk of the points were
compiled by excellent performances from a
variety of Cardinal swimmers who did not
win an individual or relay title.
In fact, while Michigan's roster boasted
four of the top eight individual point scorers,
it still finished in second place, over 120
points behind the Cardinal.
"There's no one guy on this team who
has to be a superstar and carry the load,"

Kenney said. "The lead
ership has to be spread
out to more people. For
example, Trip Zedlitz
didn't win any events,
but really stood up at
this meet and showed
something special in his
swims."
"It's something we
work on every day,"
Kenney said. "It's so
much easier to swim for
your team than it is to
swim for yourself.
"Someone once asked
(Stanford alumnus)
Pablo (Morales) how he
comes out every single
morning to train. And
he said, 'I get out of bed
because I want to be
here and contribute to
this team.' That's so
important; no matter
how you feel, swim for

your team. It's a huge
part of our success."
Kenney even found his disappointed 800
free relay giggling together about their poor
performance. "The guys on the relay called
it a 'team stink,' " Kenney said.
Regardless of alleged imperfections,
squads of the past, or "team stinks," head
coach Skip Kenney received his ceremonial
dunking and the successful Stanford squad
came home with its second-consecutive
NCAA Championship title. And what of
next year? Apparently, the Cardinal is
already thinking of a "three-peat."
"You always come in freshman year
thinking it would be nice to have four (cham
pionship) rings across your fingers," Carey
admitted after his victory in the 200 fly.
After all, as Kenney said, "there's noth
ing like winning."
