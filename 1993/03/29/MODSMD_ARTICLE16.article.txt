# Yeltsin survives impeachment vote
## Russian president and parliament speaker both claim victory 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Both President Boris
Yeltsin and his chief political rival claimed
victory yesterday after surviving attempts
by the Russian Congress to remove them
from office.
But the secret ballot by the Congress of
People's Deputies left the country's politi
cal crisis unresolved after a dramatic day of
rejected compromise and huge street ral
lies.
"A communist coup has failed. The peo
ple have won," Yeltsin told thousands of
cheering supporters outside the Kremlin
after the vote.
Waving his fist, he then led the crowd in
a chant of "Russia! Russia! Russia!"
Despite the euphoria, Yeltsin is now in
the same predicament he faced before the
Congress convened Friday. He vowed to
press ahead with an April 25 referendum to

resolve his power struggle with the parlia
ment, dominated by former Communists
who want to slow his free-market reforms.
The parliament's electoral commission
announced 617 legislators cast their ballots
for Yeltsin's ouster, well short of the 689
votes, or two-thirds of the Congress, need
ed to remove him.
Only 339 lawmakers voted to replace his
rival, parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbu
latov. At least 517 votes, a simple majority
of the 1,033-member Congress, would have
been needed to replace the 50-year-old par
liament leader.
The vote followed Congress' rejection of
a compromise proposed by Yeltsin and
Khasbulatov in an effort to end a long
power struggle between the parliament
and president.
The compromise enraged the legislators

because it would have eliminated the
Congress — and their jobs — in favor of a
smaller, bicameral legislature.
After the vote was announced, the
Congress adjourned until today. Khasbula
tov thanked the legislators for their sup
port and said he was surprised by the out
come.
"During the three years that I have
filled this post ... I thought many more
deputies had reason to be dissatisfied with
me," he said.
Yeltsin earlier told a crowd of about
50,000 supporters who rallied outside the
Kremlin he would not step down, even if
the Congress voted to oust him.
"I will obey only the will of the people,"
he said as he raised a clenched fist while
standing on a platform under the domes of
St. Basil's Cathedral.
