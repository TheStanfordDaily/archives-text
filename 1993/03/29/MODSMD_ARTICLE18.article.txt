### 
Campus appears to
have forgotten about
quake preparedness

AN EARTHQUAKE IS every
Stanford student's dream —
as long as it strikes right
before finals.
However, it is now the start of
the quarter and a potential quake
would not possess even this small
silver lining. The continuous
rebuilding efforts and deserted
buildings around campus give tes
tament to the destructive and pow
erful effects of an earthquake.
But as the Loma Prieta temblor
fades further and further from
memory, students have grown
increasingly nonchalant about
both earthquakes and earthquake
preparedness. This indifference
could have tragic consequences in
the not-too-unlikely event that the
San Andreas fault continues to
wreak havoc with California.
The University has promised to
increase its efforts to make stu
dents more ready for a future
quake. It is planning to hold sever
al seminars on how staff and stu
dents should handle the aftermath
of a temblor and have already pro
duced two such meetings.
The first such seminar had a
full turnout of approximately 100
people. The second, however, was
attended by only approximately 30
resident fellows and resident assis
tants.
As opposed to the years immedi
ately following the 1989 quake, in
which campus affairs were often
times earthquake-centric, the
sparse turnout at this meeting sig
nals an alarming trend of indiffer
ence and apathy toward earth
quakes, both by residential staff
and by students.
Earthquakes are not a joke.
They are by far the most serious
natural hazard facing Stanford,
and scientists have predicted that
the next quake to hit the Stanford

area will likely be seven to nine
times as powerful as the 7.1 Loma
Prieta quake.
If such a powerful quake hit the
Stanford area — and students and
especially staff were unable to han
dle the subsequent rescue, com
munication and supply efforts —
people could die due to this igno
rance.
Although students may be
excused for not being fluent with
earthquake evacuation and relief
procedure, staff should not be
allowed such an exemption. One of
the primary jobs of RAs and RFs is
to ensure the safety and well-being
of those students in their charge.
And while they generally cannot
protect their housemates from
crime and the vulgarities of the
outside world, they can at least
reassure them that staff members
will be a calm, steadying hand in
the event of a quake, instead of
another panicked voice.
These earthquake-preparedness
meetings should not be optional.
The prerogative of student safety
must displace that of staff indiffer
ence. Every RA and RF should be
required to attend enough meet
ings to enable him or her to react
properly to an earthquake.
An earthquake seminar could
also be added to the Orientation
schedule to ensure that freshmen
at least have a glancing knowledge
of the steps to take in such an
emergency. It is curious that
although Orientation has time for
"Acapella Fest!" and Bookstore
tours every hour, on the hour, the
only earthquake-related activity is
a 10:15 p.m. program on SCBN,
conveniently timed so as to occur
after classes have already begun.
Spring has now reached the
Stanford campus, and the Universi
ty will soon be displaying its charms
for many more months. Stanford
can be a paradise, but with this par
adise come dangers. While neglect
ing these risks would be fine, if we
knew exactly when an earthquake
were due to strike, such a schedule
unfortunately does not exist.
But even if it did, nobody would
bother to read it anyway.
