University needs better reasons for not providing storage

I WOULD LIKE TO criticize the Uni
versity's policy on summer storage.
Recently, I read a reiteration of an
October 1992 memo describing the rea
sons for the University not to provide
summer storage for residents. Keith Guy,
director of housing and food service, and
Diana Conklin, associate director of Resi
dential Education, believe the six points
on the memo adequately validate the pol
icy.
These six points are but shallow
excuses that make a dismal commentary
about the Office of Residential Educa
tion's interest in the welfare of the stu
dent body. It is reprehensible to expect
students at this time of year to start

acquiring expensive summer storage
spaces.
The memo's first point described
problems complying with the fire code,
triggered when stored items sit in dorm
rooms. Would it be so difficult to comply
with the code? With students plugging
in electronic equipment — from halogen
lamps to computers — during the school
year, it would appear that safety is more
at risk when students are present than
when they are gone.
Summer conferences require the use
of dorm rooms, the memo continues. On
this point, the University projects the
image of preferring to provide lucrative
space for conferences over addressing

students' needs.
A year back, I attended the Junior
Statesman Summer School which was
housed in Otero and Rinconada. My fel
low students and I inquired why we had
to pay almost $2,000 for the session.
Our advisors responded that a great deal
of the cost was going to pay Stanford for
housing. Certainly Stanford would not
like to see this source of income go by
making a few dorms available for stor
age.
The memo's other points were just
as transparent. Residential Educa
tion's complaints regarding the use of
precious staff time for theft state
ments, summer access and the securing

of deadbolts are not acceptable. They
can easily be responded to by facilities
staff.
Their final point suggested that stor
age made staff incapable of renovating
dorms over the summer. This point is
unsubstantiated, as the storage can be
centralized in dorms not due for renova
tion.
The criticisms I have made serve to
remind the University of its priorities to
the student body. I am sure that there is
a practical method of providing the
summer storage so needed by the finan
cially strained students of Stanford.
