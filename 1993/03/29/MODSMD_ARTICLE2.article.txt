The 1993 NCAA Swimming and Diving champi
onship meet was over shortly after it started as the
Stanford women flexed their aquatic might and
out-distanced a field of 39 teams to capture their
second-consecutive national title.
The Cardinal swimmers dominated the meet,
ascending the victor's stand 13 times to claim more

than half of the 21 total NCAA titles. That mark,
which includes nine individual titles and four relay
teams, ties the NCAA record for most titles won by
one school in any given year.
After being ranked second behind Florida dur
ing the regular season, the Stanford women swim
mers set out to reclaim the No. 1 spot and did so by
nearly tripling their margin of victory from a year
