# Women bring home second NCAA victory
##

The 1993 NCAA Swimming and Diving champi
onship meet was over shortly after it started as the
Stanford women flexed their aquatic might and
out-distanced a field of 39 teams to capture their
second-consecutive national title.
The Cardinal swimmers dominated the meet,
ascending the victor's stand 13 times to claim more

than half of the 21 total NCAA titles. That mark,
which includes nine individual titles and four relay
teams, ties the NCAA record for most titles won by
one school in any given year.
After being ranked second behind Florida dur
ing the regular season, the Stanford women swim
mers set out to reclaim the No. 1 spot and did so by
nearly tripling their margin of victory from a year
ago as they whalloped the Gators, 649.5 to 421.0.
Texas (407), SMU (273) and Michigan (251) rounded
out the top-five places.
"I thought we'd win that many events (13), but I
didn't think we'd win the meet by as many points as
we did," said coach Richard Quick. "I was a little sur
prised. We came into the meet and all year long were
ranked out of first (place) ... I think we had some
thing to prove."
The Cardinal's scoring deluge began on the first
day as it won four of the six events, beginning with
the championship team of Mary Edwards, Lea
Loveless, Janel Jorgensen and jJenny Thompson in
the 200-yard freestyle (1 minute, 30.3 seconds).
They were followed by what Quick believed to be
"the biggest boost of the meet," as freshman Lisa
Jacob won her "biggest victory yet" in the 500 free
(4:45.79). Freshman Jane Skillman also had an
impressive outing as she finished third, less than two
seconds off her teammate's time.
After Florida's Nicole Haislett (1:57.15) edged out
the 2-3-4 combination of Jorgensen (1:57.69), Mary

Ellen Blanchard (1:58.84) and Loveless (1:58.98) in
the 200 individual medley, Thompson — Olympian
and perennial favorite in the sprint freestyle events
— breezed to her second-consecutive title in the 50
free by clocking a 22.16.
Loveless, Lori Heisick, Jorgensen and Jacob then
teamed up to finish the day with a victory in the 400
medley relay (3:37.27), after Stanford's only diver,
Eileen Richetelli, posted a fifth-place showing in the
1-meter springboard competition.
Despite holding an enormous 213-134 lead over
Florida after the first day, Quick was hesitant about
claiming outright victory. "I'm really pleased with
our team's performance. If we can keep the momen
tum going... we have a chance at having a very good
meet and possibly winning the meet," he said. "This
is not over by any means."
Concurring with Quick's cautious optimism,
Thompson admitted, "It's easier than I expected. I
thought the other teams weren't as mentally and
physically prepared as us."
However, if the Cardinal had any doubts about the
outcome, they were erased after the second day of the
competition as the team increased its lead over
Florida to a convincing 460.5-266.0. Of the eight sec
ond-day events, Stanford claimed five and finished
second in two before sealing up its second-consecutive
team title.
The Cardinal initiated the second day in champi
onship form as the team of Loveless, Heisick, Becky
Crowe and Thompson posted a 1:39.52 in the 200
medley relay. Then Kendra Thayer, who finished
14th in the 200 IM, bounced back to place second in
the 400 IM (4:15.68) ahead of teammates Blanchard
(11th, 4:17.96) and Katherine Comanor (16th,
4:23.44).
Senior co-captain Jorgensen took the spotlight
next as she won the 100 butterfly (53.19) for the sec
ond time in her career. Pam Minthorn (55.11) and
Crowe (55.41) placed eighth and 12th, respectively.
Florida's Haislett showed some of the force that
propelled the Gators to No. 2 in the nation, as she
edged Thompson in the 200 free (1:43.98). Jacob,
after her day-one heroics, finished a solid sixth with a
time of 1:48.46.

Michigan's Lara Hooiveld, the NCAA Swimmer of
the Year, then stole the show as she set the first
American and NCAA records of the meet with a
1:00.47 in the 100 breaststroke. Stanford's closest
finisher was Heisick, with a sixth place showing
(1:02.19).
After breaking the record, Hooiveld set higher
aspirations for next year. "I think that a woman
should be able to swim the 100 breast in under a
minute. I am going to lift a lot of weights in the off
season, and I hope I might be the woman to do it."
Meanwhile, Loveless continued to dominate the
backstroke events as she bested Florida's Janie
Wagstaff by more than a second in the 100 back
(52.98). Cardinal veterans Mary Edwards and co-cap
tain Anne Mahoney touched the wall in fifth and
eighth place, respectively.
Finishing the second day of competition, the
Cardinal continued its shutout in the relay events as
it captured its fourth of the meet. Jacob, Skillman,
Jorgensen and Thompson combined to cream Florida
by five seconds in the 800 free relay (7:07.47).
In diving, Stanford's Richetelli won the 3-meter
springboard competition on the second day and went
on to capture the platform event on the last day en
route to defending her status as NCAA Diver of the
Year. Stanford coach Rick Schavone was also named
NCAA Diving Coach of the Year for the second-con
secutive season.
Richetelli, who is still recovering from ankle prob
lems suffered earlier this season, peaked at the right
time. "My goal was to finish in the top-eight in every
thing. I didn't expect to have a meet similar to last
year's because of my injuiy; but in the end I put it all
together when it counted, and I'm glad it turned out
this way."
Overall, she added 54 points to the Stanford cause,
which placed her fifth in the individual standings and
placed the Cardinal out of Florida's reach.
"I'm enjoying this more and more as each session
passes," Quick said at the end of the second day.
"We're going to win the meet, but it is critical for this
team not to let down. We train too hard to swim only
two days of the meet. We can't give up just because
we have a big lead."

The Cardinal showed no signs of letting up on the
last day of competition as Olympians Loveless and
Thompson both posted second-fastest American
records in their respective events. Loveless swam a
personal best of 1:53.67 in the 200 back, and
Thompson followed with a 48.03 in the 100 free.
Jacob continued to swim well in the distance
events as she posted a fifth-place finish in the 1650
free (16:29.93). Teammates Comanor (12th,
16:36.38) and Skillman (16th, 16:43.36) also finished
the meet in style.
Then the Wolverines' top swimmer, Hooiveld,
dove in again to capture the 200 breast (2:12.71)
ahead of Cardinals Heisick (fourth, 2:13.45), Thayer
(fifth, 2:13.54), and Blanchard (12th, 2:16.29).
The highlight of the day, aside from winning the
overall title, belonged to Jorgensen, as she finished
her illustrious Stanford career with a 1:57.43 win in
the 200 fly. She was very emotional after the meet: "I
really wanted to go out in style — I got a bit choked
up, and the end was kind of bittersweet," she said.
Jorgensen competed in one last relay event before
the close of the meet, but the Stanford team of
Edwards, Loveless, Jorgensen and Thompson could
not complete its shutout in the relays as it fell at the
hands of Florida in the 400 free relay (3:14.97). The
Gators also set a new American and NCAA record
with that swim.
"Even though we won the title, I think Florida
really enjoyed the chance to show something off with
that last relay," Quick said. "Overall, I thought all
along that we had the better team if we swam we 11...
Florida and Texas just didn't have the quality or
depth that we have."
The only regret of the entire meet was Hooiveld
running away with the NCAA Swimmer-of-the-Year
award while not even placing in the top-10 individual
finishers. Thompson, Jorgensen and Haislett
(Florida) tied for the No. 1 position with 57 points
each, followed by Loveless, Richetelli, Wagstaff
(Florida) and Jacob.
Despite that, the Cardinal squad is pleased with its
performance this year and the returning members
are already setting their eyes on a three-peat at next
year's NCAA Championships.
