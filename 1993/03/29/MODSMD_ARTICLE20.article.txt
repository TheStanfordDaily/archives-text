# Daily article does not recognize severity of German xenophobia
## 
### 
I am writing to express outrage and
concern at the cavalier dismissal of anti
foreigner violence in Germany in the
March 2 article involving University
President Gerhard Casper's visit there.
The author, a student at Stanford's
Berlin campus, writes, "While Germany
has recently had several publicized
episodes of hostility toward foreigners,
Casper asserted that he does not feel
that the situation is particularly danger
ous."
To characterize the 17 racially moti
vated murders in the past year, the hun
dreds of anti-foreigner muggings and
firebombings, the expulsion of non-Ger
man refugees and the restriction of asy
lum rights, the rising legitimacy of the
right-wing and anti-foreigner Repub
likaner party as "several publicized
episodes of hostility toward foreigners" is
shocking and irresponsible.
Non-German residents currently live

in fear and apprehension. Many Germans
are taking this rise of xenophobia and
anti-foreigner violence extremely serious
ly and are taking action to counter it.
Over 3 million concerned people have
participated in anti-racist demonstra
tions across Germany; the newspapers
are full of discussions about the potential
dangers of extremist nationalist senti
ments and neo-Nazi movements; promi
nent rock musicians, film actors and ath
letes have organized highly publicized
events expressing solidarity with non-
German residents; and mtgor companies,
such as Mercedes, have taken out full
page newspaper ads condemning anti
foreigner violence and lauding the contri
butions of their many non-German
workers, etc.
This is all to say that xenophobic vio
lence is not being taken lightly in Ger
many and that the majority of Germans
are acutely aware of their responsibility
to "not let it happen again." If a Stanford
student studying in Berlin is unaware of
the seriousness of these events then
there is, at the very least, something very
wrong with the Berlin program.
Not knowing the complete context of
Casper's comments, it is difficult to

ascertain his stance on the matter. Given
the übiquitous anti-American sentiment
in Germany and much of Europe, it can
be, as he said, uncomfortable but not
"particularly dangerous" to be an Ameri
can abroad.
It is, however, quite dangerous and
frightening for those people in Germany
who are from Turkey, Greece, Vietnam,
Romania, etc. Their experience could be
better compared to that of African-Amer
icans living in the South during the reign
of the Ku Klux Klan than to the experi
ence of Germans living in the United
States during the post-war era.
Racism may exist everywhere — but
it feels very different to be a minority in
a place with a history of state-organized
mass murder. For most Germans, it is
not so much a question of collective guilt,
but of their collective responsibility to
counter xenophobic violence.
It would be important for students
both here and in Berlin if Casper made
sure they understood the weight of histo
ry and the gravity of the current situa
tion in Germany.
