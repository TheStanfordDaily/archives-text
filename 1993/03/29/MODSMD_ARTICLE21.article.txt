# Hoover Institution has moved beyond political battles of past times

John Ford's March 2 column, along
with grudging compliments, mentions a
"strangely suspicious" Hoover Institu
tion, the "house of evil." He might note
that its collections put Stanford in com
pany with Harvard and like institu
tions, attracting scholars from every
where.
I am not the institution's lone Demo
crat. The only poster displayed on any of
the doors of offices near mine is for Clin
ton-Gore and the occupant is alive and
well. Among recent Hoover accessions *
are the papers of the Socialist Workers
Party of the United States, graciously
offered and gratefully received.
Most current concerns of Hoover
scholars have nothing to do with ante
diluvian liberal-conservative battles.
Whatever the past, Hoover has moved
on. So should we all.
