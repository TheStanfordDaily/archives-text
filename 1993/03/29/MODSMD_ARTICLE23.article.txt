## Is seeing really believing? 
### 
APRIL FOOLS' DAY is almost
here, the one day of the year
when we actually celebrate and
encourage deception. But outside of
April 1 (and precisely because we're not
expecting it) the world dupes us with
illusion all the time. Life is full of seem
ing reality.
For example: a sliding glass door,
when spotlessly clean and approached
from a certain angle, is nearly invisible.
And as long as there is a clean sliding
glass door, there will be some poor
schmuck who'll accidentally walk into
it. You might have seen this happen:
some guy at a party (at an unfamiliar
house) is heading outside with a piece of
cake in his hand. One <
striding toward what he thinks is an
open door, the next minute — BOOM!
— cake smeared all over the glass and
the floor, he's doubled over moaning,
holding his nose.
The world deceives us. What seems
like reality is often not.
Take this same guy. He goes to sit
down in a chair and someone pulls it
out from underneath him as a joke.
There is a moment (after the chair has
been pulled away but before he's aware
of its absence) when his body fully
trusts that there is a s'olid base beneath
him. Eyes forward, his hand gropes
behind him for the arm-rest but it's too
late, he's already irreversibly committed

to sitting on a non-existent chair (a
"chair"). As soon as he realizes this, a
hopeless look in his eyes says, "Whoa
jeez, I'm falling."
This helpless, bruised-butted, bewil
dered recognition of seeming is at the
essence of our human being.
For a long time, humans thought the
sun revolved around the earth. But then
Galileo said it was really the other way
around, and everyone felt foolish.
The Roman Catholic Church felt espe
cially foolish. It didn't think Galileo was
very funny, pulling its stable view of the
universe out from under it, and making it
think "Whoajeez, we're falling."
The Church didn't say, "Ha ha. Good
one, Galileo." They threw him in jail. In
fact, the Church's ego was so bruised by
his stunt they didn't even apologize for
being such bad sports until 350 years
later. Three hundred and fifty years
after Galileo's big-chair joke, the
Church finally said, "Ha ha. Good one,
Galileo."
Galileo was being honest. He was
saying, "Hey, everyone, come look what
I found! Your entire view of the uni
verse is wrong! Go figure!"
And he was right. So often the way
we perceive the universe turns out to be
nothing but illusion. In Newsweek I
read: "John Barrow, an English
astronomer, thinks that 'the founda
tions of mathematics have serious flaws.

. . and all the sciences that rest on math
are about as solid as day-old trifle.' "
Go figure.
Just when we think things are fixed
and predictable, someone pulls the chair
out from under us or we're smacked in
the face by the cold plate-glass of reali
ty, leaving us stupefied and befuddled.
Everything that seemed to have a solid
foundation crumbles and reveals itself
as illusion.
Even when it's not April Fools' Day,
the world sometimes tries to be up-front
with its deceptiveness. In cars, for exam
ple, we're cautioned that "objects in the
mirror are closer than they appear."
Huh? Why can't they be just as far
away as they appear?
They can't, because reality is illusion:
things are never as far away, as solid, as
ordered, as easy or as anything as they
seem. The warning on car mirrors is
honest, in the same way Galileo was try
ing to be honest by saying, "Don't trust
what you see! It's an illusion!"
Life is full of illusions.
At least that's how it seems.
