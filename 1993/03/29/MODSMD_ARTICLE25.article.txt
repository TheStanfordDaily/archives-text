## Stanford's NCAA hopes cut short by Colorado, 80-67 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
MISSOULA, Mont. — Disbelief.
That was the overriding emotion
among Stanford fans and players alike
after the women's basketball team suf
fered a heart-wrenching 80-67 defeat
against Colorado in the NCAA tourna
ment on Thursday.
Just like that the 1992-93 season was
history, and Stanford's promising
dreams for a third national champi
onship in four years lay shattered.
"It's not the way I wanted to end my
career," senior point guard Molly Good
enbour said following the disappointing
loss. "We just let it slip away."
From the way Stanford (26-6) per
formed at the beginning of the contest, it
looked like the defending national cham
pion was well on its way to earning its
second post-season victory and becoming
one of the eight teams still alive in the
NCAA playoffs.
Stanford stormed to a 10-0 lead in the
opening minutes, putting NCAA new
comer Colorado (27-3) in a hole right
from the start.
"They came out on fire," Colorado
guard Shelley Sheetz said. "They hit

every shot they put up."
The Lady Buffs responded by generat
ing some heat of their own in the first
half. Fueled by Sheetz's 17 opening-peri
od points, Colorado battled back, cutting
the lead to 39-36 at the break and show
ing Stanford that they weren't about to
give up.
The game's intensity stepped up
another notch in the second half. The
Lady Buffs tied the game at 40, only to
find themselves down by six a minute
later on a pair of Goodenbour three
pointers from the top of the key.
After extending to a 54-46 advantage
at the 15-minute mark, the Cardinal
offense faltered, scoring just 13 points
the rest of the way. Colorado, known for
its tough defense, rattled the Stanford
shooters and forced them out of their
game plan.
"They really stepped up their
defense," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We took some poor shots
and didn't get the ball to Val (Whiting)
when we needed to."
Taking advantage of the Cardinal
offensive collapse, the Lady Buffs took
the lead for good at 61-60 with 5:48
remaining. Down the stretch, the Col
orado players converted 14 of 16

freethrows to ice the win.
Earning quite an impressive victory
for a team making its first appearance in
the Regional Playoffs, the Lady Buffs
caught the whole world — especially the
Stanford Cardinal — by surprise.
"People didn't give us a snowball's
chance in hell to win the game," said Col
orado coach Ceal Barry when asked
about the significance of beating Stan
ford. "Yes, it's a big win."
The contest's outcome is even more
shocking when one considers how well
the Cardinal had been playing in its pre
vious few games.
During spring vacation, Stanford
earned impressive victories in Pac-10
play over Oregon and Oregon State and
went on to trounce Georgia in its first
playoff game.
Against Oregon (3-14, 9-17 Pacific 10
Conference), the Cardinal exploded to a
15-1 advantage and never let up. Christy
Hedgpeth, Bobbie Kelsey, and Anita
Kaplan all scored in double figures to
pace Stanford.
Along with viewing a convincing win,
the Maples Pavilion crowd of 4,607 was
treated to another thrill at the end of the
