## Stanford's NCAA hopes cut short by Colorado, 80-67 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
MISSOULA, Mont. — Disbelief.
That was the overriding emotion
among Stanford fans and players alike
after the women's basketball team suf
fered a heart-wrenching 80-67 defeat
against Colorado in the NCAA tourna
ment on Thursday.
Just like that the 1992-93 season was
history, and Stanford's promising
dreams for a third national champi
onship in four years lay shattered.
"It's not the way I wanted to end my
career," senior point guard Molly Good
enbour said following the disappointing
loss. "We just let it slip away."
From the way Stanford (26-6) per
formed at the beginning of the contest, it
looked like the defending national cham
pion was well on its way to earning its
second post-season victory and becoming
one of the eight teams still alive in the
NCAA playoffs.
Stanford stormed to a 10-0 lead in the
opening minutes, putting NCAA new
comer Colorado (27-3) in a hole right
from the start.
"They came out on fire," Colorado
guard Shelley Sheetz said. "They hit

every shot they put up."
The Lady Buffs responded by generat
ing some heat of their own in the first
half. Fueled by Sheetz's 17 opening-peri
od points, Colorado battled back, cutting
the lead to 39-36 at the break and show
ing Stanford that they weren't about to
give up.
The game's intensity stepped up
another notch in the second half. The
Lady Buffs tied the game at 40, only to
find themselves down by six a minute
later on a pair of Goodenbour three
pointers from the top of the key.
After extending to a 54-46 advantage
at the 15-minute mark, the Cardinal
offense faltered, scoring just 13 points
the rest of the way. Colorado, known for
its tough defense, rattled the Stanford
shooters and forced them out of their
game plan.
"They really stepped up their
defense," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We took some poor shots
and didn't get the ball to Val (Whiting)
when we needed to."
Taking advantage of the Cardinal
offensive collapse, the Lady Buffs took
the lead for good at 61-60 with 5:48
remaining. Down the stretch, the Col
orado players converted 14 of 16

freethrows to ice the win.
Earning quite an impressive victory
for a team making its first appearance in
the Regional Playoffs, the Lady Buffs
caught the whole world — especially the
Stanford Cardinal — by surprise.
"People didn't give us a snowball's
chance in hell to win the game," said Col
orado coach Ceal Barry when asked
about the significance of beating Stan
ford. "Yes, it's a big win."
The contest's outcome is even more
shocking when one considers how well
the Cardinal had been playing in its pre
vious few games.
During spring vacation, Stanford
earned impressive victories in Pac-10
play over Oregon and Oregon State and
went on to trounce Georgia in its first
playoff game.
Against Oregon (3-14, 9-17 Pacific 10
Conference), the Cardinal exploded to a
15-1 advantage and never let up. Christy
Hedgpeth, Bobbie Kelsey, and Anita
Kaplan all scored in double figures to
pace Stanford.
Along with viewing a convincing win,
the Maples Pavilion crowd of 4,607 was
treated to another thrill at the end of the

first half. Sophomore guard Kate
Paye heaved a 50-foot shot which
banked in at the halftime buzzer,
propelling Stanford to a 34-point
halftime lead and an eventual 86
52 victory.
Stanford concluded its regular
season schedule at home two
nights later in an emotional con
test with Oregon State.
Not only was this the last regu
lar season home game for seniors
Goodenbour, Whiting, Angela
Taylor and Chris MacMurdo, but a
victory over the Beavers (9-9, 15-
12) also ensured a fifth-straight
Pac-10 title for the Cardinal.
Although Stanford trailed for
most of the first period and found
itself down 36-33 at the break, the
Cardinal bounced back in the sec
ond half. Stanford opened with a
15-4 run, taking an eight-point
lead, and never looking back.
Whiting scored 19 of her 27
points in the second half to push
the Cardinal (16-3 Pac-10) to a 84-
69 win.
The wave of momentum contin
ued as Stanford crushed Georgia

-93-60 in the second round of the
NCAA playoffs, giving the Cardi
nal its ninth and
its sixth-consecutive Regional
Semifinals appearance.
The contest was marked by out
standing performances from most
Stanford players, but the extraor
dinary offensive efforts by Whiting
and Goodenbour stole the show.
"They went to their money
players and their money players
delivered," said Georgia coach
Andy Landers.
Whiting scored 20 points to
become Stanford's all-time leading
scorer. The Ail-American center
passed Jeanne Ruark HofFs previ
ous record of 2,038 points set
between 1978 and 1983 and fin
ished her career with 2,077 big
ones.
Goodenbour's five three-point
ers and 29 points pushed her over
the 1,000 point mark for career
scoring, making her the 15th Car
dinal player to reach that mark.
While the Stanford squad held
the lead most of the way, it didn't
clinch the win over the Bulldogs
(21-13) until it embarked on a 10-
0 scoring run midway through the
second period. After Whiting made
a crowd-pleasing spin move that
led to an easy layup, Goodenbour
closed the scoring run with back

to-back fast-break layups.
By that time the Cardinal had
attained an unapproachable 26-
point lead at the 12-minute mark,
whipping the crowd into a frenzy.
"This was one of our best games
of the year," VanDerveer said.
"Every game we've played brings
out the emotion from other people.
We saw emotion from our own
players tonight."

MISSOULA, Mont. — Disbelief.
That was the overriding emotion
among Stanford fans and players alike
after the women's basketball team suf
fered a heart-wrenching 80-67 defeat
against Colorado in the NCAA tourna
ment on Thursday.
Just like that the 1992-93 season was
history, and Stanford's promising
dreams for a third national champi
onship in four years lay shattered.
"It's not the way I wanted to end my
career," senior point guard Molly Good
enbour said following the disappointing
loss. "We just let it slip away."
From the way Stanford (26-6) per
formed at the beginning of the contest, it
looked like the defending national cham
pion was well on its way to earning its
second post-season victory and becoming
one of the eight teams still alive in the
NCAA playoffs.
Stanford stormed to a 10-0 lead in the
opening minutes, putting NCAA new
comer Colorado (27-3) in a hole right
from the start.
"They came out on fire," Colorado
guard Shelley Sheetz said. "They hit

every shot they put up."
The Lady Buffs responded by generat
ing some heat of their own in the first
half. Fueled by Sheetz's 17 opening-peri
od points, Colorado battled back, cutting
the lead to 39-36 at the break and show
ing Stanford that they weren't about to
give up.
The game's intensity stepped up
another notch in the second half. The
Lady Buffs tied the game at 40, only to
find themselves down by six a minute
later on a pair of Goodenbour three
pointers from the top of the key.
After extending to a 54-46 advantage
at the 15-minute mark, the Cardinal
offense faltered, scoring just 13 points
the rest of the way. Colorado, known for
its tough defense, rattled the Stanford
shooters and forced them out of their
game plan.
"They really stepped up their
defense," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We took some poor shots
and didn't get the ball to Val (Whiting)
when we needed to."
Taking advantage of the Cardinal
offensive collapse, the Lady Buffs took
the lead for good at 61-60 with 5:48
remaining. Down the stretch, the Col
orado players converted 14 of 16

freethrows to ice the win.
Earning quite an impressive victory
for a team making its first appearance in
the Regional Playoffs, the Lady Buffs
caught the whole world — especially the
Stanford Cardinal — by surprise.
"People didn't give us a snowball's
chance in hell to win the game," said Col
orado coach Ceal Barry when asked
about the significance of beating Stan
ford. "Yes, it's a big win."
The contest's outcome is even more
shocking when one considers how well
the Cardinal had been playing in its pre
vious few games.
During spring vacation, Stanford
earned impressive victories in Pac-10
play over Oregon and Oregon State and
went on to trounce Georgia in its first
playoff game.
Against Oregon (3-14, 9-17 Pacific 10
Conference), the Cardinal exploded to a
15-1 advantage and never let up. Christy
Hedgpeth, Bobbie Kelsey, and Anita

pace Stanford.

first half. Sophomore guard Kate
Paye heaved a 50-foot shot which
banked in at the halftime buzzer,
propelling Stanford to a 34-point
halftime lead and an eventual 86

Stanford concluded its regular
season schedule at home two
nights later in an emotional con
test with Oregon State.
Not only was this the last regu
lar season home game for seniors
Goodenbour, Whiting, Angela
Taylor and Chris MacMurdo, but a
victory over the Beavers (9-9, 15-
12) also ensured a fifth-straight
Pac-10 title for the Cardinal.
Although Stanford trailed for
most of the first period and found
itself down 36-33 at the break, the
Cardinal bounced back in the sec
ond half. Stanford opened with a
15-4 run, taking an eight-point
lead, and never looking back.
Whiting scored 19 of her 27
points in the second half to push
the Cardinal (16-3 Pac-10) to a 84-
69 win.
The wave of momentum contin
ued as Stanford crushed Georgia

-93-60 in the second round of the
NCAA playoffs, giving the Cardi
nal its ninth and
its sixth-consecutive Regional
Semifinals appearance.
The contest was marked by out
standing performances from most
Stanford players, but the extraor
dinary offensive efforts by Whiting
and Goodenbour stole the show.
"They went to their money
players and their money players
delivered," said Georgia coach
Andy Landers.
Whiting scored 20 points to
become Stanford's all-time leading
scorer. The Ail-American center
passed Jeanne Ruark HofFs previ
ous record of 2,038 points set
between 1978 and 1983 and fin
ished her career with 2,077 big
ones.
Goodenbour's five three-point
ers and 29 points pushed her over
the 1,000 point mark for career
scoring, making her the 15th Car
dinal player to reach that mark.
While the Stanford squad held
the lead most of the way, it didn't
clinch the win over the Bulldogs
(21-13) until it embarked on a 10-
0 scoring run midway through the
second period. After Whiting made
a crowd-pleasing spin move that
led to an easy layup, Goodenbour
closed the scoring run with back

to-back fast-break layups.
By that time the Cardinal had
attained an unapproachable 26-
point lead at the 12-minute mark,
whipping the crowd into a frenzy.
"This was one of our best games
of the year," VanDerveer said.
"Every game we've played brings
out the emotion from other people.
We saw emotion from our own
players tonight."

MISSOULA, Mont. — Disbelief.
That was the overriding emotion
among Stanford fans and players alike
after the women's basketball team suf
fered a heart-wrenching 80-67 defeat
against Colorado in the NCAA tourna
ment on Thursday.
Just like that the 1992-93 season was
history, and Stanford's promising
dreams for a third national champi
onship in four years lay shattered.
"It's not the way I wanted to end my
career," senior point guard Molly Good
enbour said following the disappointing
loss. "We just let it slip away."
From the way Stanford (26-6) per
formed at the beginning of the contest, it
looked like the defending national cham
pion was well on its way to earning its
second post-season victory and becoming
one of the eight teams still alive in the
NCAA playoffs.
Stanford stormed to a 10-0 lead in the
opening minutes, putting NCAA new
comer Colorado (27-3) in a hole right
from the start.
"They came out on fire," Colorado
guard Shelley Sheetz said. "They hit

every shot they put up."
The Lady Buffs responded by generat
ing some heat of their own in the first
half. Fueled by Sheetz's 17 opening-peri
od points, Colorado battled back, cutting
the lead to 39-36 at the break and show
ing Stanford that they weren't about to
give up.
The game's intensity stepped up
another notch in the second half. The
Lady Buffs tied the game at 40, only to
find themselves down by six a minute
later on a pair of Goodenbour three
pointers from the top of the key.
After extending to a 54-46 advantage
at the 15-minute mark, the Cardinal
offense faltered, scoring just 13 points
the rest of the way. Colorado, known for
its tough defense, rattled the Stanford
shooters and forced them out of their
game plan.
"They really stepped up their
defense," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "We took some poor shots
and didn't get the ball to Val (Whiting)
when we needed to."
Taking advantage of the Cardinal
offensive collapse, the Lady Buffs took
the lead for good at 61-60 with 5:48
remaining. Down the stretch, the Col
orado players converted 14 of 16

freethrows to ice the win.
Earning quite an impressive victory
for a team making its first appearance in
the Regional Playoffs, the Lady Buffs
caught the whole world — especially the
Stanford Cardinal — by surprise.
"People didn't give us a snowball's
chance in hell to win the game," said Col
orado coach Ceal Barry when asked
about the significance of beating Stan
ford. "Yes, it's a big win."
The contest's outcome is even more
shocking when one considers how well
the Cardinal had been playing in its pre
vious few games.
During spring vacation, Stanford
earned impressive victories in Pac-10
play over Oregon and Oregon State and
went on to trounce Georgia in its first
playoff game.
Against Oregon (3-14, 9-17 Pacific 10
Conference), the Cardinal exploded to a
15-1 advantage and never let up. Christy
Hedgpeth, Bobbie Kelsey, and Anita
Kaplan all scored in double figures to
pace Stanford.
Along with viewing a convincing win,
the Maples Pavilion crowd of 4,607 was
treated to another thrill at the end of the

Senior Val Whiting contributed 20 points to Stanford's 93-60 win over Georgia in its first
NCAA contest Whiting became Stanford's all-time leading scorer with 2,077 points.
first half. Sophomore guard Kate
Paye heaved a 50-foot shot which
banked in at the halftime buzzer,
propelling Stanford to a 34-point
halftime lead and an eventual 86
52 victory.
Stanford concluded its regular
season schedule at home two
nights later in an emotional con
test with Oregon State.
Not only was this the last regu
lar season home game for seniors
Goodenbour, Whiting, Angela
Taylor and Chris MacMurdo, but a
victory over the Beavers (9-9, 15-
12) also ensured a fifth-straight
Pac-10 title for the Cardinal.
Although Stanford trailed for
most of the first period and found
itself down 36-33 at the break, the
Cardinal bounced back in the sec
ond half. Stanford opened with a
15-4 run, taking an eight-point
lead, and never looking back.
Whiting scored 19 of her 27
points in the second half to push
the Cardinal (16-3 Pac-10) to a 84-
69 win.
The wave of momentum contin
ued as Stanford crushed Georgia

-93-60 in the second round of the
NCAA playoffs, giving the Cardi
nal its ninth and
its sixth-consecutive Regional
Semifinals appearance.
The contest was marked by out
standing performances from most
Stanford players, but the extraor
dinary offensive efforts by Whiting
and Goodenbour stole the show.
"They went to their money
players and their money players
delivered," said Georgia coach
Andy Landers.
Whiting scored 20 points to
become Stanford's all-time leading
scorer. The Ail-American center
passed Jeanne Ruark HofFs previ
ous record of 2,038 points set
between 1978 and 1983 and fin
ished her career with 2,077 big
ones.
Goodenbour's five three-point
ers and 29 points pushed her over
the 1,000 point mark for career
scoring, making her the 15th Car
dinal player to reach that mark.
While the Stanford squad held
the lead most of the way, it didn't
clinch the win over the Bulldogs
(21-13) until it embarked on a 10-
0 scoring run midway through the
second period. After Whiting made
a crowd-pleasing spin move that
led to an easy layup, Goodenbour
closed the scoring run with back

to-back fast-break layups.
By that time the Cardinal had
attained an unapproachable 26-
point lead at the 12-minute mark,
whipping the crowd into a frenzy.
"This was one of our best games
of the year," VanDerveer said.
"Every game we've played brings
out the emotion from other people.
We saw emotion from our own
players tonight."
