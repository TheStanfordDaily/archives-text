# Frustrating loss puts gloomy cloud over season's end
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
MISSOULA, Mont. — As the Band
played the Stanford Hymn for the last
time this basketball season, it was all one
could do to figure out what had happened.
The Cardinal's loss to Colorado was a
shock — an unexpected punch to the gut
— leaving only a queasy feeling in the
stomachs of the Stanford faithful.
Somehow, a game that was tied with
just over three minutes to go wound up a
13-point defeat.
Assaulted by an overhand right (a
three-point basket), a left cross (a two
pointer) and a flurry of body blows (14
free-throws), the stunned Cardinal was
out on its feet.
Stanford's season, which had been full
of promise, was over. The Cardinal would
not repeat as national champion.
Molly Goodenbour's, Chris MacMur
do's, Angela Taylor's and Val Whiting's
careers were over. Cut off in their prime.
Having stayed within striking distance
for most of the game, Colorado made its
move and stole the game. For Stanford's
four senior captains, the defeat brought to
an abrupt end an otherwise brilliant reign
atop the world of women's basketball.

"Molly and Val and Angela and Chris
have had a great four years," coach Tara
VanDerveer said after the game. "I don't
think that there's anyone in college bas
ketball that's accomplished all they have.
I'm very proud to have coached all of
them."
To be certain, the seniors leave with a
long list of achievements, including:
• Two national championships;
• Three Final-Four appearances;
• Four Sweet-16 appearances; and
• Four Pacific- 10-Conference titles.
But reminiscing is for old people, peo
ple who can no longer achieve. Entering
the West Regional, the Cardinal still hun
gered for more.
"I don't really care about last year,"
MacMurdo said the day before her final
game. "I don't plan on looking back and
smiling probably 'til I'm 40."
It could well have been four Final
Fours. It could have been three national
championships.
After such hopes ended, a deceptively
matter-of-fact Goodenbour said, "I have a
lot of good memories of Stanford basket
ball. I'm jußt sorry-we couldn't get there
one more year."
But Goodenbour's post-game compo
sure belied the painful frustration she

undoubtedly felt.
Too many hours, days, weeks, months
spent practicing; too many shooting
drills, too many scrimmages, too many
wind-sprints; too much time, energy,
commitment. All suddenly irrelevant.
Of course, that's sports: "the thrill of
victory, the agony of defeat," as ABC's
"Wide World of Sports" has told viewers
for years. The Colorado players logged all
the hours of work, too. As did all the
teams Stanford vanquished en route to
its 1990 and 1992 championships.
After the loss, VanDerveer wanted to
make sure the seniors' success would not
be overshadowed by one defeat.
"We especially didn't play well for 20
minutes," she said. "That 20 minutes
shouldn't color a great career."
If there was a women's version of the
NBA where superstars like Whiting and
Goodenbour could have the chance to
make up for this year's frustration, the
sudden end to their college careers might
not hurt as much it does.
But with the only option a less-than
desirable one.-r- leaving the United States
for the unfamiliar and uncomfortable
lifestyle of a European league — the sting
of Colorado's victory burns all the more
viciously.
