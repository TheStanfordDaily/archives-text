# Losses close out season for men's hoops
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The fat lady had sung long
ago on the Stanford men's bas
ketball season, but it wasn't
until two weeks ago that she fin

ished her last note.
The Cardinal squad ended its
season in precisely the same
detrimental manner it displayed
all year, failing to score in the
waning minutes of close ball
games.

Oregon 84, Stanford 73
The Cardinal had high hopes
as it traveled to Eugene, Ore. on
March 11 to face the Oregon
Ducks. After two solid outings in
defeats at home against the Ari
zona schools the previous week
end, Stanford needed little incen
tive for this matchup because
ninth place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference was on the line.
In a sluggish contest, both
teams traded baskets until the
3:56 mark of the first half, when
Stanford, leading 31-29, put
together a 10-5 run over the next
two-and-a-half minutes. But fol
lowing a television timeout, what
occurred seemed like a replay of
the Arizona State game one week
earlier. In that contest, the Sun
Devils scored nine consecutive
points to narrow Stanford's lead
before the half. This time, the
Ducks gave the Cardinal a sense
of deja vu in scoring five unan
swered points to cut Stanford's
would-be halftime margin of
seven points to just two.
In the second half, the Ducks
effectively mixed up their offense
between the perimeter and the
inside to build a small lead. Ore
gon center Aaron Johnson mus
cled and fouled out Jim Morgan
en route to 16 points, forward JefT
Potter added 12 points and 7
rebounds, and forward Clyde Jor
dan tallied 13 points and 7
rebounds in reserve. Meanwhile,
Oregon guard Antione
Stoudamire used his quickness to
penetrate and draw fouls, and
backcourt-mate Orlando Williams
spotted up to make four-of-flve
three-pointers.
With Stanford trailing 75-70
with just over two minutes
remaining, Cardinal forward
Brent Williams grabbed a defen
sive rebound and went coast-to
coast for a leaning lefthanded
layup, drawing a foul on Johnnie
Reece in the process. But
Williams' completion of the three
point play was to be the last Stan
ford score on the night. On the
Cardinal's next possession, guard
Marcus Lollie drove to the basket
— only to miss a wide-open layup
— and Williams turned the ball
over the following time down the
floor, as Oregon went on to score

the last nine points of the game.
"I feel sick about it," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery fol
lowing the game. "It's the same
things that have cost us all year.
We got handled at the post, we
don't make key plays at the key
points of the basketball game and
we don't manage the end of the
half like we should."
With the victory, the Ducks (3-
14, 10-19 Pac-10) gave the fans at
McArthur Court a rare chance to
celebrate.
"It's just great to get out of the
cellar," Potter said. "Maybe we're
not the biggest laughingstock in
the league anymore."
Williams led Stanford with 19
points, and Lollie and guard Dion
Cross each had 15.

On March 13, the Cardinal
bused north to the season finale
in Corvallis against Oregon State,
yet again was unable to sustain a
tangible offensive effort down the
stretch, allowing the opposition to
walk home a winner.
The Cardinal aimed to shut
down the Beavers' inside game,
and was successful in doing so in
the opening period, as Oregon
State center Scott Haskin scored
only four first-half points. But an
unexpected burst from the
perimeter gave the Beavers a lift.
Oregon State, which was previ
ously shooting only 31.7 percent
from three-point range, shot 47.6
percent from long range against
the Cardinal, hitting on 10-of-21
attempts.
Oregon State led 36-31 at the
break, and opened the second half
with an 16-9 run. The Cardinal
then countered with a nine-point
stretch of its own. Haskin,
though, began to cause the Cardi
nal problems, fouling out Jim
Morgan at the 13:15 mark, and
drawing Bart Lammersen into
four fouls, forcing Montgomery to
turn to a small lineup.
Guard Dion Cross led the Car
dinal on its comeback, scoring 15
of his game-high 22 points in the
second half. But after forward
Darren Allaway scored on a put
back with 3:24 left, to pull Stan
