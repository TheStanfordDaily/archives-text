## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Despite extra-long practice
sessions, members of the No.
5 men's tennis team showed
little fatigue as they breezed
through last week's dual
matches against Brigham
Young, Arizona State and Ari
zona to improve their season
record to 12-1.
On Wednesday the Cardi
nal sailed by BYU, 7-2, drop
ping only the first singles and
first doubles matches. Cougar
Mark Quinney was the team's
only double winner as he
inched by Stanford's No. 7-
ranked Michael Flanagan 2-6,
6-4, 6-2. He then paired up
with Herman Vandecasteele
to clinch BYU's second point
with a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 win over
Flanagan and Chris Cocotos.
Junior Robert Devens, who
remains undefeated in singles
play, dueled with Vandecas
teele at second singles before
pulling out a close 4-6, 6-4, 7-
6 victory.
"This was one of my hard
est matches this year," he
said. "It was long and I was
going in tired." After two
weeks of rest, the Cardinal
men had just begun their
week of five-hour-a-day work
outs when they faced BYU.
At third singles, junior
Vimal Patel blew away Micah
Rideout 6-2, 6-0, while Coco
tos crushed Jason Hardin 6-2,
6-3 in the fourth slot.
Freshman Jeff Salzenstein
had little trouble at fifth sin
gles, defeating Colin
McMullin 6-3, 6-3. Junior
Billy Wright rounded out the
team's win with a long 6-1, 4-
6, 6-1 duel against Brian
Hardin.
The Cardinal's second and
third doubles teams took only
two sets apiece to defeat the
Cougars. Patel and Devens
beat Rideout and Brian
Hardin 6-3, 7-6 while Salzen

stein and classmate Jim
Thomas squeezed by Jason
Hardin and McMullin 6-1, 7-
5.
After a day of rest, the
Stanford men mustered up
their strength and blew out
ASU 6-0 with the same lineup
they had used against BYU.
The 5-8 Sun Devils forfeited
doubles play after all six Car
dinal men won their singles
matches.
"We played really well,"
Cocotos said. "This was the
first good test for us, besides
[the Pacific-10 Individual
Indoors]."
At first singles, Flanagan
took three sets to defeat No.
25 Bruce Haddad 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
Devens improved his singles
record to 11-0 with an easy 6-
4, 6-1 win over Eric Brunner
while Patel sailed by Peter
Jeschke 7-5, 6-2. Cocotos
clinched the team's victory
with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Chris
Gambino. Salzenstein fin
ished off Paul Reber 6-3, 6-1
while Wright, 7-0 in singles,
crushed Tyson Bond 6-0, 6-2.
Saturday's match against
Arizona was postponed until
yesterday because of rain, but
that did not slow the Stanford
men. They ended the day with
an 8-1 victory over the Wild
cats.
Arizona, who almost upset
No. 2 UCLA recently, was
expected to pose a formidable
challenge to Stanford. "They
seemed burnt out to me,"
Cocotos said. "I think they
can play better."
Yesterday, Flanagan
squeaked by Randy Baldemor
7-6, 7-6. Devens had little
trouble, cruising by Matt Holt
6-1, 6-3. Patel completed the
dominance of the top half of
the lineup with a 1-6, 6-1, 6-0
win over Greg Prudhomme.
Cocotos suffered the Cardi
nal's only loss when Brandon
