### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Despite extra-long practice
sessions, members of the No.

On Wednesday the Cardi
nal sailed by BYU, 7-2, drop

pulling out a close 4-6, 6-4, 7-
6 victory.
"This was one of my hard
est matches this year," he
said. "It was long and I was
going in tired." After two
weeks of rest, the Cardinal
men had just begun their
week of five-hour-a-day work
outs when they faced BYU.
At third singles, junior
Vimal Patel blew away Micah
Rideout 6-2, 6-0, while Coco
tos crushed Jason Hardin 6-2,

Cougars. Patel and Devens
beat Rideout and Brian
Hardin 6-3, 7-6 while Salzen

stein and classmate Jim
Thomas squeezed by Jason
Hardin and McMullin 6-1, 7-
5.
After a day of rest, the
Stanford men mustered up
their strength and blew out
ASU 6-0 with the same lineup
they had used against BYU.
The 5-8 Sun Devils forfeited
doubles play after all six Car
dinal men won their singles
matches.
"We played really well,"
Cocotos said. "This was the
first good test for us, besides
[the Pacific-10 Individual
Indoors]."
At first singles, Flanagan
took three sets to defeat No.
25 Bruce Haddad 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
Devens improved his singles
record to 11-0 with an easy 6-

that did not slow the Stanford
men. They ended the day with
an 8-1 victory over the Wild
cats.
Arizona, who almost upset
No. 2 UCLA recently, was
expected to pose a formidable
challenge to Stanford. "They
seemed burnt out to me,"
Cocotos said. "I think they
can play better."
Yesterday, Flanagan
squeaked by Randy Baldemor
7-6, 7-6. Devens had little
trouble, cruising by Matt Holt

Patel breezed by Rey and Holt

A strong doubles perfor
mance will be the key to Cardi
nal success in the tougher
matches to come. "We're cer
tainly not good enough to beat a

good team in singles so we've
got to keep scrapin' and scrapin'
and hopefully we'll win a match
in the doubles," Devens
explained. "These were good
matches to win but the real test
is coming this weekend. Then
we'll see where we really are in
the season."
This weekend the Cardinal
travels to Los Angeles to take
on the top two teams in the
nation, USC and UCLA.
