# Batters destroy Cornhuskers, fall to Arizona State
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The clouds which hung over
Sunken Diamond late yesterday
afternoon aptly summarized the
Cardinal baseball squad's out
look heading into the second half
of 1993.
"We didn't do a good job this
weekend at all," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess. "We've
definitely got to turn it around
quickly."
Stanford (14-11 overall, 2-7
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) dropped a pair of cru
cial division contests to Arizona
State yesterday, 3-1 and 6-5. The
Cardinal limped to a 1-4 record
over break, and was swept by the
Sun Devils for the first time in
four years.
"We have to get a little bit
more consistent, especially with
the bats," Marquess said.
The Stanford batsmen began
the break with a blast, scoring a
season-high 14 runs in a 14-3
shellacking of the University of
Nebraska (8-4).
Junior ace Willie Adams
tossed six scoreless innings
against the Cornhuskers in pick
ing up his fifth win of the season.
The Cardinal, burdened with
fielding problems most of the sea
son, committed no errors and
took advantage of six Nebraska
errors to tally five unearned
runs.
Jed Hansen led the Cardinal
attack, rocketing home runs in
the third and fourth innings and
driving in six on the afternoon.
The sophomore second base
man's multi-longball perfor
mance was Stanford's first since
Mark Skeels hit two against
UCLA last season.
Cale Carter, moved out of the
leadoff position in the lineup for
the first time all season, respond
ed with a pair of base hits. Brodie
VanWagenen also contributed
two hits to the cause.
Also encouraging was the
return of Stanford left fielder
Nate Olmstead. Olmstead, who

missed 15 games after spraining
his ankle against Cal State-
Fullerton Feb. 7, started at desig
nated hitter and singled and
drove in a run.
Olmstead struggled to find his
form against the Sun Devils, but
Marquess was unconcerned.
"Nate's going to take a little
while to get back into things,"
Marquess said. "But it is nice to
have him back out there."
Less encouraging was the Car
dinal's play against Sacramento
State. Stanford failed to put
together the big innings against
the Hornets that it had produced
against Nebraska, stranding 10
runners in an 11-3 defeat.
The Cardinal opened scoring
against CSUS (18-8) in the first
with doubles from Hansen and
cleanup hitter Dusty Allen.
However, Stanford errors in
the fifth and sixth led to four
unearned runs, as the Hornets
took an 8-2 lead into the seventh.
Hornet starter Roland DeLa-
Maza, who had settled down after
the first inning, left the game
with the bases loaded in the sev
enth and the heart of the Cardi
nal lineup coming to the plate.
But Stanford could only man
age an Allen RBI walk, and
mounted no threats after that.
The Arizona State series, how
ever, meant more than either of
the Cardinal's first two games.
Stanford and ASU came into the
weekend tied with Arizona for
last place in the Six-Pac.
The Cardinal, which opened
Six-Pac competition last season
with a home-series win against
the Sun Devils, managed no such
success this year.
Arizona State's mighty offense
came out in full force Friday. The
Sun Devils, who amassed 44
home runs and a .334 average in
their first 35 contests, handed
Adams his first loss of the season.
Adams, who had only allowed
two home runs all year, gave up
another pair on Friday, including
a two-run shot off the bat of
Jacob Cruz which gave ASU an
insurmountable 6-0 lead.

Sun Devil starter Marc Barce
lo went the distance, despite
allowing 11 Stanford hits. Barce
lo improved to 7-2 on the season.
Saturday's game was rained
out, and the two schools faced off
in a doubleheader yesterday.
Stanford opened scoring in the
fourth when Hansen singled
home catcher A.J. Hinch.
But Cardinal lefty Andrew
Lorraine, the victim of poor field
ing against Sacramento State,
fell prey to similar problems yes
terday.
The Sun Devils tied the game
in the fifth when designated hit
ter Todd Cady scored on a passed
ball. In the eighth, Lorraine gave
up a one-out triple to Bill Dunn,

but retired the dangerous Brian
Lootens on a groundout.
Two pitches later, Paul LoDu
ca lofted what appeared to be an
inning-ending fly ball to shallow
right field. However, the ball
dropped, Dunn scored and Ari
zona State won.
Lorraine tallied his fourth
complete game of the year, allow
ing only seven hits and striking
out a career-best nine men.
In the second game, the Sun
Devils jumped to a 6-2 lead after
four innings.
But Stanford made a game of
it in the fifth. With Hinch and
Hansen aboard, Allen laced his
second home run of the season, a
three-run blast which brought

the Cardinal within one.
Allen has emerged from his
early-season slump with an excla
mation point. The first baseman
is in the midst of a nine-game hit
ting streak, and leads the team
with 27 RBl's.
Greg Mix, who stepped in for
starting pitcher Dan Reed in the
sixth, put together his finest per
formance of the season. The
senior racked up three and two
thirds innings of scoreless relief,
allowing only a pair of base hits.
But Arizona State reliever
Noah Peery proved just as tough.
Peery pitched out of jams in both
the sixth and seventh, and
retired the Cardinal bats in order
over the final two frames.

Marquess, ejected for arguing
balls and strikes with home-plate
umpire Bob Eustes in the ninth
inning, would not pin the defeat
on questionable calls.
"That didn't beat us," said the
coach. "We couldn't hit the ball
when it counted."
Arizona State improved to 26-
10 overall and 6-5 in the Six-Pac,
while Stanford anchored its hold
on sixth place in the division.
The Cardinal travels to Reno

Nevada-Reno at 1:30 p.m.

Al Green â€” Daily file
Freshman Cale Carter contributed two base hits in Stanford's 14-3 win over Nebraska. The Cardinal's next opponents were not as easy to
handle, as Sacramento dealt Stanford an 11-3 loss and Arizona State swept all three games of the weekend series.
