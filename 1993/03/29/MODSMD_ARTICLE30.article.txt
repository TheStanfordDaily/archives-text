# Crew teams outdistance competition
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's crews
started the spring season with good perfor
mances in regattas at Redwood Shores the
past two weekends, defeating UC-Santa
Clara, UC-Santa Barbara and UC-Davis.
The women's crew, sending the entire
team to both regattas, came away with first
places in all races against Santa Clara on
March 20. The varsity four placed first with a
time of 7 minutes, 38 seconds for the 2,000
meter course, with Stanford's other two
boats finishing 19 and 42 seconds behind,
good enough for second and fourth place.
Santa Clara finished third with a time of
7:58.
"This was pretty much the expected out
come," said coach Wendy Davis. "We hadn't
rowed all week during finals, but we prac
ticed hard right before the race."
In the novice division, Stanford's two
eights finished first and second with times of
7:23 and 7:45. The Banana Slugs finished
third with a time of 7:54.
Against Santa Barbara on March 27, the
Cardinal achieved similar success. The
women's varsity eight boat finished first with
a time of 6:38, with the Gauchos coming in
second at 7:44 and the Aggies finishing third
at 7:45.
The junior-varsity eight also defeated
Santa Barbara and Davis with a time of 7:50,
who both finished three seconds behind Stan
ford.

The first and second novice boats were
close for the first 1,500 meters of their race
but were caught off-guard when the coxswain
from Santa Barbara started swearing at
them, according to Davis.
"We were neck and neck until 500 meters
to go, and then we just lost it," Davis said. "I
guess we'll have to send some of the women
to go see some hatchet movies to get them
used to such language."
The long layoff over winter quarter did not
seem to affect the Stanford women. Davis
said the varsity practices were good for the
first half of spring break, but then the desire
for a vacation set in. However, she said the
crew should be more prepared for the San
Diego Crew Classic this Saturday and Sun
day.
"It's going to be a tough field, but we
should do well," Davis said. "Cornell is sup
posed to be there, and they are No. 2 in the
country. We'll also go up against Radcliffe,
Northeastern, Syracuse and UC-Davis.
"Hopefully we'll be able to catch some of
the eastern schools by surprise, because of all
the snow they have had the last few weeks,"
Davis said.
If Kate Steger can recover from a back
injury from winter, the women's crew should
challenge for top rankings on the Pacific
Coast. Steger has been participating in half
the workouts, but Davis hopes to get that up
to 90 or 95 percent.
"We'll have a tough road without Kate if
we want to challenge Washington or Califor
nia," Davis said.

"We won't out-muscle them, but maybe
we can outsmart them."
The Cardinal men's crew team opened its
racing season in impressive fashion, winning
four of its five races against UC-Santa Bar
bara on the 2,006 meter Redwood Shores
Lagoon course on March 21.
The varsity eight completed the race with
a time of 6:08.22, beating the Gauchos by one
boat length.
The junior-varsity eight tallied a three
length win with a time of 6:10.75, and the
freshman eight was also victorious (6:32.70).
The varsity four-man crew with coxswain
beat the Gauchos by 10 seconds (7:28.35),
while the freshman four with coxswain fell to
Santa Barbara's 8:16.41.
"This time of year, with finals and every
thing, can make it shaky," said men's coach
Wieslaw Kujda. "But we're coming off the
best winter we've had since I've been here,
and we can definitely challenge the faster
teams."
The men's crew also handled UC-Santa
Clara at Redwood Shores on March 27, win
ning all three races. The varsity eight pushed
past Santa Clara with a time of 6:05 to win by
15 seconds.
The two junior-varsity eights finished first
and third with times of 6:17 and 6:40. Santa
Clara wedged in between the two Cardinal
boats at 6:32.
The Cardinal freshman eight defeated
Santa Clara by 25 seconds with a time of
6:30, and Stanford's second freshman boat
came in third at 7:01.

"We'll have a tough road without Kate if
we want to challenge Washington or Califor
nia," Davis said.

"We won't out-muscle them, but maybe
we can outsmart them."
The Cardinal men's crew team opened its
racing season in impressive fashion, winning
four of its five races against UC-Santa Bar

The varsity four-man crew with coxswain
beat the Gauchos by 10 seconds (7:28.35),
while the freshman four with coxswain fell to

"This time of year, with finals and every
thing, can make it shaky," said men's coach
Wieslaw Kujda. "But we're coming off the
best winter we've had since I've been here,
and we can definitely challenge the faster
teams."
The men's crew also handled UC-Santa
Clara at Redwood Shores on March 27, win
ning all three races. The varsity eight pushed
past Santa Clara with a time of 6:05 to win by
