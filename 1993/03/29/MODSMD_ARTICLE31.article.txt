Two weeks after a promis
ing fourth-place finish at the
San Jose State Invitational in
Monterey, the Stanford
women's golf team wrapped up
an impressive second-place fin
ish at the March 23-25 Hawaii
Intercollegiate Invitational.
The tournament featured
17 highly ranked teams includ
ing No. 2 Texas, No. 3 Georgia
and No. 4 Oklahoma State.
While ranked No. 18 coming
into the contest, the Cardinal
finished tied for second with
Texas and Oklahoma State,
posting a cumulative score of
919. The Georgia Lady Bull
dogs won the tournament with
a cumulative score of 914.
The Cardinal sent five rep
resentatives, including senior
captain Martha Richards,
junior Melinda Daniels, sopho
more Jamille Jose and fresh
men Vicky Strada and Julie
Bowen.

The Cardinal finished sec
ond thanks to balanced sup
port from each player and a
tournament-low second-round
score of 295. Richards (79-71-
79) and Jose (76-72-81) fin
ished tied for eighth in a field
of 82 players, each shooting a
cumulative 229. Renee Hiken
from Illinois won the individu
al tournament, shooting an
impressive 218.
Before the tournament,
Daniels (77-83-73) was opti
mistic about the Cardinal's
chances. "It should be a good,
tough field, with UCLA, USC,
Hawaii and Arizona," Daniels
said. Daniels finished 22nd in
the tournament, shooting 233
overall and 73 in the difficult
third round.
Strada (76-75-83) finished
27th and was also impressed
with the Cardinal's finish given
the strength of the competition.
"The teams that won were
ranked fairly high," Strada
said. "We did really well by beating
a lot of good teams while finishing,
second."
Competing in her first colle
giate tournament, freshman
Julie Bowen (85-77-85) finished
52nd overall with a 295, but con
tributed a 77 in Stanford's tour
nament-low second round. Coach
Tim Baldwin noted, "I thought
she played excellent, especially
the second day; her 77 really
helped the team."
Baldwin was very optimistic
about the team's potential top-10
national ranking.
"Tying (second- ranked)
Texas and (fourth ranked) Okla
homa State should move us into

ninth or 10th overall," Baldwin
said.
Next for the Cardinal is the
Lady Sun Devil Invitational at
Arizona State, which will take
place April 5 in Tempe. Ariz. The
Cardinal will send the same field
of golfers. Both Baldwin and the
players are looking forward to the
upcoming competition. "Eigh
teen of the top teams in the coun
try will be at the Lady Sun Devil
Invite," Baldwin said.
Baldwin was pleased with the
team's overall development since
the fall season. "We had a ho
hum fall and a very good first
tournament of spring," Baldwin
said. "We finished fourth at Fort
Ord (the San Jose State Invita
tional) two weeks ago, and with
this second-place finish we're def
initely pointed in the right direc
tion."
