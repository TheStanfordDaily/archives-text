# Women's gymnastics can't deliver in Pac-10 championship
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
The announcer at the Pacific
-10 Conference women's gymnas
tics championships called the
Pac-10 "the most competitive
conference in the country."
Stanford found that out the hard
way.
At the March 12 meet in
Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal
finished last out of the seven
teams, posting its worst score —
189.00 — since Jan. 22.
UCLA won the meet with a
score of 194.55. Following
behind the Bruins were Oregon
State (193.70), Arizona (193.2),
Arizona State (192.90), Wash
ington (190.80) and California
(189.4).

we were a little disap
pointed, and we let it
take us down.'

Despite Stanford's woes, the
record crowd was treated to
some spectacular gymnastics.
Four gymnasts scored above
39.00, led by UCLA's Kareema
Marrow, who won the all-around
competition with a score of
39.35.
ASU's Tina Brinkman fin
ished second with a score of
39.25, Arizona's Kristi Gunning
was third with 38.20 and OSU's
Amy Durham scored 39.05. Pac
-10 Gymnast of the Year Stacy
Fowlkes of Arizona was fifth
with 38.85.
Stanford's top all-arounder
was freshman Hillary Anderson,
who finished in a tie for ninth
with a mark of 38.40.
The most electric individual
performance of the night
belonged to UCLA's Megan
Fenton, who scored a perfect 10
on the uneven bars to win the

Pac-10 championship in that
event.
Brinkman recorded 9.95s on
vault and floor to win confer
ence titles, sharing the first
with Gunning. Arizona's Jenna
Karadbil scored a 9.80 on the
balance beam, sharing the title
with UCLA's Carol Ulrich.
Despite multiple injuries,
sophomore Jenfe Elzie was
responsible for two of Stanford's
three top performances. She was
fifth on bars, and she and Ander
son tied for third on balance
beam with scores of 9.75.
Coming into the meet, Elzie
was recovering from a strained
right Achilles tendon that had
kept her out of all-around com
petition for over a month, and on
her first event at the Pac-lOs —
vault — she hyperextended her
left knee. Even with two bad
legs, she stuck her dismount on
uneven bars and had an excellent
performance on beam.
"I just said, 'Well, I have to do
it,' " Elzie said after the meet, ice
wrapped around her knee.
"This (the hyperextension)
doesn't matter, just go out and
do it."
Despite her gutsy showing at
the Pac-lOs, head coach Breck
Greenwood was not confident
about Elzie's chances to heal
fully before the NCAA Regional
competition on April 3.
"It'll be a real challenge to get
her ready," he said.
Elzie's courage was one of the
few bright spots in a Cardinal
performance that got out of the
blocks slow and then decelerated.
Stanford began the meet on
floor, usually the team's
strongest event; the last time the
Cardinal scored below 48.00 was
Jan. 16.
Until the Pac-10 champi
onships, that is. The first two
gymnasts received subpar scores,
and the squad's morale took a
nosedive. Four more desultory
routines, and the Cardinal had a
47.10, easily its worst mark of
the season.
At first, it appeared the judges
were scoring unusually tightly

on the event, but Oregon State
went to floor in the next rotation
and promptly earned a 48.35.
"We had some subtle mistakes
on the first couple routines,"
Greenwood said. "It was us, not
the judges."
"After the first event, we were
a little disappointed, and we let it
take us down," junior co-captain
Mollie Brown added.

'After the first two
events, we knew we
didn't have a chance
to finish near the
top, so we just
relaxed.'
— Breck Greenwood

From floor, the Cardinal next
had to vault, which, to say the
least, has been a problematic
event for the team all year.
Although the team had its third
highest vault score of the season,
46.55, it did not compare to the
other schools' scores, and it did
nothing to buoy Stanford's spir
its.
The Cardinal finished with
respectable scores on bars and
beam, but it was too little, too
late.
"After the first two events, we
knew we didn't have a chance to
finish near the top, so we just
relaxed," Greenwood said.
Despite the down perfor
mance, the Cardinal athletes
tried to remain optimistic.
"We know what we did
tonight wasn't us, it's not what
we're capable of," Brown said.
"If Regionals were next week,
I'd be pretty nervous," Green
wood said, adding that the three
week break will allow Stanford to
bounce back.
"We still think we're one of
the top teams in the country,"
Brown said.
