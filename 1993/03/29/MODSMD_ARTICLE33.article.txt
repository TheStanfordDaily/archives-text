# Cardinal tennis dual match snapped up by Gators
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
They may have spent spring break in Florida, but for
the Stanford women's tennis team, the party ended
early.
The No. 1 Cardinal (16-1, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
rang up two non-conference victories over the vacation
against UC-Santa Barbara, 8-1, and No. 15 Tennessee, 6-
0, but saw its undefeated season come to an end against
No. 2 Florida, losing 5-1 in Gainesville.
"They're tough, and they played really well down
there," said junior Laxmi Poruri. "If we're off even a lit
tle, they're going to get us, and their crowd was unbeliev
able — they were in our face all match."
Things did not bode well for the Cardinal Wednesday
when senior captain Heather Willens, Stanford's No. 2
player, was sidelined with a pinched nerve, forcing the
team to make do without one of its key components.
Even Willens, however, could not have stopped the
Gator onslaught. No. 1 Poruri squared off against her
nemesis Lisa Raymond for the first time since Raymond
defeated Poruri in straight sets at the National Team
Indoors Feb. 28. Raymond handed Poruri more of the
same in the dual match, posting a 3-6,6-0,6-3 victory.
"I feel like I'm definitely capable of beating her, and I
know I'm improving," Poruri said. "I think she's going to
respect me more when NCAAs come around."
Redshirt freshman Kim Shasby, playing in the No. 2
spot for the injured Willens, fell to Florida's Andrea Far
ley 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, while junior Kristine Kurth dropped
her No. 3 match to Jill Brenner, 6-2,6-1.
Freshman Beth Berris provided the Cardinal with its
only win of the day, defeating Erika Ruttler by a 6-2,7-5
score in the No. 4 matchup. Any hopes of a Stanford vic
tory were quickly silenced, however, as Florida's Kristin
Osmond downed Amy Chiminello at No. 5,6-4,7-6 (7-5),
and Lori Ann Freedman shut the door on No. 6 Emma
Woodhouse, 6-4, 6-4.

Poruri noted that while the undefeated season may be
over for the Cardinal, the loss to the Gators shouldn't
dampen hopes for a run at the NCAA Championship.
"I don't think it will," Poruri said. "It just makes us
hungry and makes us want to beat them when we get
them in NCAAs."
The vacation was not all bad for Stanford, however, as
the team chalked up victories against UCSB and Ten
nessee. On March 22, the Cardinal hosted Santa Barbara
at Stanford Tennis Stadium, and sent the Gauchos pack
ing with an 8-1 win. No. 1 Poruri rolled over Laura Rut
ledge in Poruri'B first 6-0,6-0 win of the year, while Wil
lens wrapped up Lynn Coakley in the No. 2 match, 6-4,
6-2. No. 3 Kurth played for Shasby, who sat out to nurse
a tender foot injury that hampered her earlier in the
week. Kurth beat UCSB's Jean Okada by a 6^4,6-4 score.
No. 4 Berris took her match against Kathy Peterson
by a 6-3, 6-3 score, while Chiminello sewed up the No. 5
match against Kelly Spencer, 6-1, 6-2. Woodhouse
rounded out the singles sweep for Stanford with a 6-1,6-
1 win over Courtney Strauss.
In doubles action, the No. 1 tandem of Poruri and Wil
lens defeated UCSB's Okada and Peterson, 6-0, 6-4.
No. 2 Berris and Kurth slowed down Spencer and Amelia
White, 7-6, 6-4, but the No. 3 team of Woodhouse and
Sacks wasn't so lucky, falling to Santa Barbara's Rut
ledge and Coakley, 6-3,5-7,7-5.
Stanford also notched its 16th win of the year with a
convincing 6-0 victory over Tennessee.
The Cardinal returns to conference play this Friday at
Stanford Tennis Stadium, when it hosts the No. 6 USC
Trojans, followed by a dual match with No. 10 UCLA on
Saturday. Poruri emphasizes that teams like USC and
UCLA will give Stanford all it can handle.
"We're not overlooking anybody from now on,"
Poruri said. "We're anxious to work really hard against
these teams, especially with the Pac-lOs coming up.
. The USC match stalls at 1:30 p.m. on Friday, while
the UCLA match begins at 1 p.m. Saturday.

defeated Poruri in straight sets at the National Team
Indoors Feb. 28. Raymond handed Poruri more of the
same in the dual match, posting a 3-6,6-0,6-3 victory.
"I feel like I'm definitely capable of beating her, and I
know I'm improving," Poruri said. "I think she's going to
respect me more when NCAAs come around."
Redshirt freshman Kim Shasby, playing in the No. 2
spot for the injured Willens, fell to Florida's Andrea Far
ley 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, while junior Kristine Kurth dropped
her No. 3 match to Jill Brenner, 6-2,6-1.
Freshman Beth Berris provided the Cardinal with its
only win of the day, defeating Erika Ruttler by a 6-2,7-5
score in the No. 4 matchup. Any hopes of a Stanford vic
tory were quickly silenced, however, as Florida's Kristin
Osmond downed Amy Chiminello at No. 5,6-4,7-6 (7-5),
and Lori Ann Freedman shut the door on No. 6 Emma
Woodhouse, 6-4, 6-4.

Poruri noted that while the undefeated season may be
over for the Cardinal, the loss to the Gators shouldn't
dampen hopes for a run at the NCAA Championship.
"I don't think it will," Poruri said. "It just makes us
hungry and makes us want to beat them when we get
them in NCAAs."
The vacation was not all bad for Stanford, however, as
the team chalked up victories against UCSB and Ten
nessee. On March 22, the Cardinal hosted Santa Barbara
at Stanford Tennis Stadium, and sent the Gauchos pack
ing with an 8-1 win. No. 1 Poruri rolled over Laura Rut
ledge in Poruri'B first 6-0,6-0 win of the year, while Wil
lens wrapped up Lynn Coakley in the No. 2 match, 6-4,
6-2. No. 3 Kurth played for Shasby, who sat out to nurse
a tender foot injury that hampered her earlier in the
week. Kurth beat UCSB's Jean Okada by a 6^4,6-4 score.
No. 4 Berris took her match against Kathy Peterson
by a 6-3, 6-3 score, while Chiminello sewed up the No. 5
match against Kelly Spencer, 6-1, 6-2. Woodhouse
rounded out the singles sweep for Stanford with a 6-1,6-
1 win over Courtney Strauss.
In doubles action, the No. 1 tandem of Poruri and Wil
lens defeated UCSB's Okada and Peterson, 6-0, 6-4.
No. 2 Berris and Kurth slowed down Spencer and Amelia
White, 7-6, 6-4, but the No. 3 team of Woodhouse and
Sacks wasn't so lucky, falling to Santa Barbara's Rut
ledge and Coakley, 6-3,5-7,7-5.
Stanford also notched its 16th win of the year with a
convincing 6-0 victory over Tennessee.
The Cardinal returns to conference play this Friday at
Stanford Tennis Stadium, when it hosts the No. 6 USC
Trojans, followed by a dual match with No. 10 UCLA on
Saturday. Poruri emphasizes that teams like USC and
UCLA will give Stanford all it can handle.
"We're not overlooking anybody from now on,"
Poruri said. "We're anxious to work really hard against
these teams, especially with the Pac-lOs coming up.
. The USC match stalls at 1:30 p.m. on Friday, while
the UCLA match begins at 1 p.m. Saturday.
