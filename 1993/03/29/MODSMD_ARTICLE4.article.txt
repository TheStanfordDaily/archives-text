# X-ray-like images without the radiation
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Shining a light on someone's body usually
doesn't tell you what's inside.
But Stanford researchers have found a
way to do just that, and their technique may
eventually be able to produce accurate im
ages of the body more safely and cheaply
than other methods.

Pediatrics Profs. David Benaron and
David Stevenson have produced internal im
ages of humans and animals using laser light
comparable to that used in a compact disc
player. Their first pictures, taken years ago,
of a rat's organs were recently published in
Science magazine.
"This project has been more successful
than anything we ever imagined," Benaron
said. "Sometimes when you ask new and

novel questions, you're rewarded by the
amazing."
Benaron and Stevenson, the first re
searchers to produce such images using this
technique, have developed a portable imag
ing device that can identify medical condi
tions that were once detected only through
blood testing or other complicated diagnostic
procedures.
"It'B a new way that's inexpen
sive and not harmful," Benaron
said.
Benaron said the device could
potentially be used to detect tumors,
heart attacks and strokes, and to
measure oxygen or substances in
the blood, such as cholesterol or
sugar. The technology, unlike con
ventional X-rays, would allow doc
tors to continuously monitor
patients without fear of excessive
radiation.
The light imaging can also scan
for tumors years before they'd be
detected normally. "Breast tumors
are usually five to 10 years old by the
time they're felt. With this, we can
start scanning people when they're
20 years old rather than waiting
until they're 40 to do a mammo
gram," Benaron said.
"It's a big step from the lab to the
real world, but I think within five to
seven years, it will be a really useful
imaging device."
Another added benefit is the cost.
Traditional CT and MRI scanning
machines can run millions of dol
lars, but Benaron projects a final
price of $200,000 for the light-imag
ing equipment. He also estimates
that the cost can be reduced by one
fourth within a couple of years.
Benaron emphasized the safety
of the procedure compared to tradi
tional X-rays. "Fundamentally, it's
the same principle as sending elec
tromagnetic (X-ray) waves through
the body. But X-rays are so high
energy, nothing stops them but
metal. They knock eft protein com
ponents and parts of DNA... [caus
ing] cancer."
The laser light has a very low
power and should not cause any
damage, he said.

However, "This new light imag
ing is more complicated," Benaron
said. "You need a computer to per
ceive and break down the data....
With X-rays all you need is a piece of
film."
The light-imaging techniques
developed by the Stanford doctors
and other researchers are based on
the knowledge that light does travel
through the body, but is scattered in
various directions.
"Think of the soft red glow you
get when you shine a flashlight
behind your hand," Benaron said.
"Many photons go through, but
they bounce around a lot. A photon
may travel anywhere from a foot to
six inches going through the width
of your hand."
The researchers use extremely
sensitive computer equipment to

measure the amount of light scatter
ing. Using very precise timing —
down to 20 trillionths of a second —
the scientists determined how far
each photon travels and the density
of the material through which it
moves.
Benaron said researchers are
working to overcome certain limita
tions, however. "We have to make
sure we don't use too much light, to
the point of discomfort or burn."
Another question the doctors are
tackling involves the technique's
resolution. "The body has certain
parts that absorb a tremendous
amount of light, such as blood clots
and the center of the brain. We
think the ultimate resolution will be
comparable to that of CT scans, but
not many times better," said
Benaron.
