Shining a light on someone's body usually
doesn't tell you what's inside.
But Stanford researchers have found a
way to do just that, and their technique may
eventually be able to produce accurate im
ages of the body more safely and cheaply
than other methods.

Pediatrics Profs. David Benaron and
David Stevenson have produced internal im
ages of humans and animals using laser light
comparable to that used in a compact disc
player. Their first pictures, taken years ago,
of a rat's organs were recently published in
Science magazine.
"This project has been more successful
than anything we ever imagined," Benaron
said. "Sometimes when you ask new and

novel questions, you're rewarded by the
amazing."
Benaron and Stevenson, the first re
searchers to produce such images using this
technique, have developed a portable imag
ing device that can identify medical condi
tions that were once detected only through
blood testing or other complicated diagnostic
