# Cheating suspected on CIV, geophysics finals
## Some students must retake exam Saturday 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Allegations of cheating during
two final exams last quarter have
prompted professors and adminis
trators to launch an investigation
and withhold grades.
Students in Geophysics 04,
"Natural Hazards and Man," will
have to retake their final exam
this weekend, while instructors of
Philosophy 58, a Cultures, Ideas
and Values course, are awaiting
further student response before
taking action.
In both cases, students in
formed instructors that one or
more of the students who were

permitted to take the exams early
had allegedly shared information
with classmates prior to the regu
larly scheduled exam.
"I haven't had a problem like
this reported to my office in the 10
years I've been here," said Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. "If
the reports are accurate, students
were behaving in a way that was
grossly unfair to honest students.
We hope to correct that."
Cole said the Judicial Affairs
Office will conduct the investiga
tions by requesting students who
have information about the al
leged incidents to report it to their
professors or to her office.
Cole and the professors mailed

out letters to all students in both
classes last week, informing them
of the alleged cheating and the
subsequent procedures regarding
their exams. In the letters, they
also requested students to disclose
any information that might assist
in the investigations.
In the meantime, Cole held a
press conference with local news
papers, because she and the in
structors "recognize that [they]
could not communicate (the inci
dents) to 360 students and keep it
a private matter."
In the geophysics class, 13 of
173 students took the exam early;
in the CIV course, 17 of 187 did.
Cole said instructors were
informed about the cheating
through written statements,
phone messages and verbal com
plaints from students.
Instructors in the geophysics
class were told by some students
that actual photocopies of the
exam had been passed around to
numerous other students. The
department responded immedi
ately and scheduled another exam
for Saturday. The results of the
original exam have been voided.
"My (primary) consideration
was to insure the integrity of the
examination, and once it was vio
lated, I wanted to make sure fair
grades were given to the class,"
said Mark Zoback, chairman of
the geophysics department.
But Zoback said he and the
department felt the decision to
promptly readminister the exam
was the best way to impose "the
least disruption to students." Pro
longing a search for any culprits
will make readministering a test

difficult, since students will forget
much of the material and seniors
will be graduating, he said.
Students in the class say they
are upset at having to take the
exam again, and feel unjustly
punished.
"I think it's too bad that all of
us have to retake it and suffer
because of the dishonesty of a few
people," said senior Tom Flemma.
Junior Carla Sanchez-Palacios
said she is angry because she does
not have the time to study for a
retest.
The geophysics department
plans to hand over the search for
the students who cheated to Judi
cial Affairs.
Zoback also said that a new
department policy will be outlined
to prevent any cheating in the
future, possibly by creating differ
ent versions of exams to be
administered before the test date,
or barring early exams entirely.
Instructors in Philosophy CIV
have temporarily decided to take
an inactive stance, opting to wait
for responses from students that
may help them find who allegedly
cheated.
In the meantime, the students'
grades will not be marked as final
until it is decided whether the

exam will have to be retaken.
"I would feel bad about (taking
the exam over), but I would also
feel bad if they curved it with the
high grades (of those who cheat
ed). It's a no-win situation," said
freshman Travis Conley, who is in
the class.
John Perry, the principal lec
turer for the Philosophy CIV,
declined to comment, but in a let
ter addressed to all of his students
he said he realized "that the
uncertainty of this situation may
complicate the lives of some [stu
dents] for the next few weeks."
"If we can quickly determine
which students had an unfair
advantage on the final, we will be
able to avoid a second final exam
and report the grades of the hon
est students based on the original
final exam," Perry said.
In her letter to students, Cole
wrote, "I realize that those of you
with knowledge about the possi
ble misconduct of your peers are
in an unhappy situation. By
choosing to enroll at a school with
an Honor Code, however, you
accepted both the benefits and the
obligations that come with it."
Under the Honor Code, stu
dents collectively accept responsi
bility for their honesty on exams

and other class assignments, and
faculty members are not expected
to take extraordinary measures to
detect student dishonesty.
Cole explained in her letter
that all honest students suffer
from the dishonesty of others
because they are put at an "aca
demic disadvantage when others
cheat" and "if the dishonest stu
dents are not held accountable for
their actions, all honest students
and faculty suffer from a campus
environment that appears to con
done dishonesty."
She also said that students will
suffer in the future when instruc
tors refuse to accept legitimate
requests to take exams early
because they are afraid to trust
the integrity of their students.
The violators must be found to
curb future problems, Cole
added.
In recent years, most Honor
Code violations have resulted in a
one-quarter suspension from the
University and nullification of
credit in the course. Students may
also receive a formal reprimand
and a probation period. Repeat
offenses are result in a three
quarter suspension and a grade of
"No Credit." Further violations
can lead to expulsion.
