# Cheating suspected on CIV, geophysics finals
## Some students must retake exam Saturday

Allegations of cheating during
two final exams last quarter have
prompted professors and adminis

Office will conduct the investiga

have information about the al
leged incidents to report it to their
professors or to her office.

out letters to all students in both
classes last week, informing them
of the alleged cheating and the

their exams. In the letters, they

in the investigations.
In the meantime, Cole held a
press conference with local news
papers, because she and the in
structors "recognize that [they]
could not communicate (the inci

a private matter."
In the geophysics class, 13 of
173 students took the exam early;
