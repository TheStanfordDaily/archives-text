# Harassment suit brought against Stanford, doctor
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
A Medical Center administrative assistant has
filed a lawsuit accusing Ophthalmology Prof.
Richard Sogg of sexual harassment and claiming that
the University did not take appropriate steps to pre
vent it.
The lawsuit, filed last month in Santa Clara Coun
ty Superior Court, alleges that Sogg harassed 31-
year-old Mizpah Brown by grabbing her buttocks,
pulling on her bra strap, touching parts of her body
and making offensive sexual remarks.
Sogg could not be reached for comment, but his
lawyer said he denies the accusations.
University Counsel Priscilla Wheeler, the lawyer
representing both Sogg and Stanford, said she thinks
Brown's case is weak. "At this point, we don't feel the
lawsuit has merit," she said.

The only undisputed allegation is the claim that
the doctor touched Brown's bottom, Wheeler said,
explaining that the incident was a misunderstand
ing. "They were in a crowded office. He accidentally
touched her bottom — and it was a touch, not a
pinch," she said. "It was unintentional, but [Brown]
took it otherwise."
Wheeler said the recent publicity about the Med
ical Center's sexual harassment problems has
heightened awareness about the issue, creating "the
sort of climate that makes complaints come for
ward."
"That's fine," she said, but added that such an at
mosphere may have led to the misunderstanding.
However, Brown's lawyer, Keith Shandalow, said
that for his client, "it was not just a touching."
Rather, it was the "most obvious, most blatant" ha-
rassment to date and was the inci
dent precipitating the lawsuit, he
said.
According to the suit, Brown is
seeking monetary compensation for
emotional distress and mental
anguish, along with punitive dam
ages against Sogg and against the
University for negligently failing to
discipline the doctor for his conduct.
Brown's lawyer is optimistic
about their chances for success,
saying that they may be able to
present evidence that Sogg has sex
ually harassed other women in the
past. He said there should be at
least one other similar complaint
on file at the University.
However, Wheeler said the Uni
versity is unaware of any previous
charges of sexual harassment
against Sogg.
Shandalow, though, said he
intends to prove just that — that
the University did know of, or
should have known of, Sogg's

alleged record of sexual harass
ment and that it took no effective
action to curb his alleged misbe
havior.
While Brown is currently asking
only for financial compensation,
Shandalow said they are reserving
the right to seek injunctive relief. If
successful, he said, such action
could force the University to
administer a "more effective" sexu
al harassment education program
and forbid Sogg from coming with
in a certain distance of Brown.
Shandalow said he will also cite
the very visible sexual harassment
problems at the Medical Center as
evidence that the University has
not been dealing with the problem
effectively.
In addition, Shandalow said he
also plans to demonstrate that the
University did not respond appro
priately to Brown's specific com
plaint. He said administrators did
not fully address the problem of
sexual harassment, nor did they
grant Brown the transfer she
requested.
Wheeler, however, contends
that the University did "every

thing a responsible employer
could." The University investigat
ed immediately and took concrete
action by asking Sogg to write
Brown a letter of apology and by
relocating his office, she said.
In the letter, Sogg apologized
for causing Brown any discomfort
by accidentally touching her but
tocks.
But to Brown, Shandalow said,
the letter does not mean much
because it does not contain any
admission of guilt or fault.
Brown is also unsatisfied with
the University's response because
she was not given a job transfer,
he said. She still holds the same
job in the Ophthalmology Depart
ment.
According to Wheeler, though,
transfers cannot be automatically
granted in such cases because
there are not always enough job
openings within the University.
What the University did do,
she said, was arrange for someone
in the Medical Center to work
with Brown to find another job.
Wheeler said Brown did not fol
low up on the process.
