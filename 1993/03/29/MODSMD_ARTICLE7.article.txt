# Families organize
## EV residents set up elected council 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
After months of dissatisfaction
with inadequate communication
with University officials, student
families in Escondido Village are
working to establish a formal
elected body in order to partici
pate more effectively in decision
making processes affecting the
community.
So far, they have set up an ad
hoc "family council" that has al
ready prompted changes in Uni
versity plans and policies regard
ing graduate residential issues
such as storage.
The group aims to "provide a li
aison between residents and the
University," said Mary Lea
McAnally, one of the graduate
students who set up the council as
a result of a February student
town hall meeting that she and
other students organized.
Director of Graduate Resi
dences Chris Griffith had also
been encouraging the formation
of such a council in a column she
wrote in the Escondido newslet
ter prior to the meeting. The
group's formation was formally
announced to the residents at a sec
ond meeting held in mid-March.
According to Griffith, the council
is important because "students
were feeling isolated" from the
administration and the decisions
that affected life in Escondido. It
"gives people an opportunity to
express problems in a framework of
being part of the solution," she said.
She is hoping to establish similar
groups for couples without children
and for single students in Escondido
during spring quarter.
Education graduate student
Benson Honig, the acting chair of
the council, said the 10-member
group hopes to adopt a detailed pro
cedure for electing representatives

from each neighborhood in Escon
dido by the end of spring quarter.
Since its formation, the council
has been able to affect University
policy on student-owned storage
sheds in Escondido.
In February, the University had
considered requiring all residents
who had storage sheds outside their
apartments to remove them by
July. But as a result of feedback
from the group, Griffith said "a
decision was made to not do any
thing about the sheds, and in the
meantime to look at the issue of
storage."
Council members were also
involved in a plan to allocate the
newly furnished apartment units in
the University's 10-year capital
improvement plan.
The University plans to reno
vate all of the units in Escondido
over the next 10 years. Initially, the

University had considered allocat
ing the units based on a lottery sys
tem. According to McAnally, the
council expressed a strong interest
in a priority for current residents.
Griffith said units will be allocat
ed to current residents in each
neighborhood, but it will be up to
the residents in the neighborhoods
to choose between assigning the
units according to seniority or
through a lottery.
Honig said he hopes having elect
ed representatives will make the
group more able to affect decision
making.
"We get more interest when
there are more problems in the vil
lage," he said, adding that having an
elected body would provide an
established institution that could
serve as "another check and balance
in the University's (decision-mak
ing) process."
