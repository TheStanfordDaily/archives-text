# Survey says:
## Students support Asian-American studies program 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
Student organizers of a cam
pus-wide survey revealing sig
nificant interest in Asian-
American studies are hoping
the study results will generate
discussion about the establish
ment of an Asian-American
studies program.
Conducted by the student
run Independent Survey Project
on Asian-American Studies, the
study polled 1,062 students â€”
roughly one-sixth of the entire
undergraduate population. Of

the students surveyed, 65 per
cent responded favorably to the
proposal of an Asian-American
studies program, while another
20 percent indicated strong sup
port.
While both students and fac
ulty say they recognize that the
survey reveals the need to fur
ther incorporate Asian-Ameri
can studies into the curriculum,
an actual program seems to be a
distant goal, pending more dis
cussion between faculty, ad
ministrators and students.
