# Survey says:
## Students support Asian-American studies program 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
Student organizers of a cam
pus-wide survey revealing sig
nificant interest in Asian-
American studies are hoping
the study results will generate
discussion about the establish
ment of an Asian-American
studies program.
Conducted by the student
run Independent Survey Project
on Asian-American Studies, the
study polled 1,062 students —
roughly one-sixth of the entire
undergraduate population. Of

the students surveyed, 65 per
cent responded favorably to the
proposal of an Asian-American
studies program, while another
20 percent indicated strong sup
port.
While both students and fac
ulty say they recognize that the
survey reveals the need to fur
ther incorporate Asian-Ameri
can studies into the curriculum,
an actual program seems to be a
distant goal, pending more dis
cussion between faculty, ad
ministrators and students.
"From my perspective, I think
when you get an indication of
interest like this from students,
students and faculty should get
together and explore," said Dean
of Students Michael Jackson. "I
think we already have the begin
nings of an Asian-American stud
ies program."
Stanford currently offers two
Asian-American studies courses,
one in the History Department
and the other in the Comparative
Literature Program.
Asst. History Prof. Gordon
Chang, who teaches one of the
classes, said the survey may be
the key to making real progress
on the issue, which has been
stalled numerous times before.
"There has been a lot of effort
to establish Asian-American
studies in the past," Chang said.
"But for many years the adminis
tration has not been very recep
tive — voicing intellectual reser
vation, budgetary opposition. I'm
heartened by the survey, which I
think will initiate discussion."
However, Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences A 1
Camarillo said the need for more

Asian-American studies courses
has already been acknowledged
and discussed, and the University
is already in the process of trying
to address the issue.
"There is already a recogni
tion that there needs to be more
courses on Asian-American
studies at Stanford," Camarillo
said.
Still, some students say more
classes are not enough. Senior
Elisa Cheng, the survey's coordi
nator, said she believes the incor
poration of a complete Asian-
American Studies program is
crucial if "Stanford is serious
about its commitment to diversi
ty and to the needs of its stu
dents."
Cheng recently founded the
Asian-American Coalition for
Transformation, which will hold
meetings with various Asian-
American campus groups to dis
cuss the survey results.
Members of the Asian-Ameri
can student community echoed
the survey results, saying that
widespread awareness and sup
port must be elicited to bring
Stanford up to par with other
universities that have far more
extensive Asian-American stud
ies programs.
"The survey is very encourag
ing, but not a surprise," said

senior Ken Tan, issues chair of
the Asian American Student
Association. "Instituting Asian-
American studies has always
been one of AASA's foremost
goals and something that we've
worked toward these past few
years."
"Simply taking general public
policy classes in place of classes
dealing specifically with Asian -
American issues isn't enough,"
said freshman Laura Kim, a
member of the survey project.
Kim said she had considered
transferring to UC-Berkeley or
UCLA because of the "limited
options" of Stanford's curricu
lum, but has decided to stay
because of the "revived interest"
and increased discussion the sur
vey has generated.
Both University of California
campuses currently offer either
undergraduate or graduate pro
grams in Asian-American stud
ies, with diverse class offerings
such as "Stereotypes of Asian-
Americans in the Media," and
"Health Care Issues Concerning
Chinatown's Elderly."
Camarillo pointed out that the
relatively large number of faculty
on those campuses facilitate the
institution of such programs. "It
takes faculty interest, and com
mitment," he said.
