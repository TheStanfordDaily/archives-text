# Internal, external issues discussed by public-affairs group
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Zero — that's how many new
policies the University's recently
formed Public Affairs Council will
propose.
However, members of the
council will do a lot of talking — to
each other — in order to keep
abreast of the latest developments
within the University.
As a result of University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's cost-cut
ting administrative reorganiza

tion — which eliminated the posi
tion of Vice President of Public Af
fairs — University administrators
found a need to maintain a central
information-gathering resource.
The Public Affairs Council fills
this vacancy. Organized by Assis
tant to the President Jean Fetter,
the Council convenes top adminis
trators to keep them accurately
informed of University affairs.
The council was established to
make sure that no public afTairs
related issue "falls between the
cracks," Fetter said.
However, it does nothing more
than discuss; members emphasize
that the group is not a policy-mak
ing body. Fetter said the council
meets just "to discuss internal and
external issues."
After the administrative reorga
nization, people within the Depart
ment of Public Affairs did not have
one specific person to report to and
ended up communicating to either
to Casper or herself, Fetter said.
But even when the position of
Vice President for Public Affairs
was filled, the University's admin
istration was still very decentral
ized in keeping officials informed
about issues, said Assistant Direc
tor of Public Affairs Sandi Risser,
who staffs the council.
The group, which falls under

the President's Office, is responsi
ble for keeping its members
informed about public-affairs
issues, anticipating future issues,
coordinating University responses
and serving as a sounding board for
problems of common interest that
are raised by individual members.
It "is not going to produce a
report or do anything specific other
than just keep each other
informed," Fetter said.
The council has no set agenda
since topics to be discussed are sub
mitted by members, according to
Fetter. Tlie council's first meeting
dealt with the upcoming World Cup
soccer matches. Future topics for
discussion include campus health
and safety issues, parking and traf
fic issues, earthquake emergency
planning and future alumni
reunion and homecoming activities.
There are no students on the
council because nothing it does
directly has an impact on students,
Risser added. There is no need to

have student input since it is not a
policy-making group.
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son serves on the council repre
senting the student community.
Jackson praised the purpose of
the council, saying it provides a
"new opportunity for people to
come together and work through
issues by looking at them from dif
ferent angles."
So far, Risser said that the
Council meetings are going well.
"They are very energetic and inter
esting and there is plenty to talk
about."
Comprised of senior administra
tors from all over campus, the com
mittee meets every other week to
coordinate information about
issues that affect the University.
Council members include the
director of government relations,
the News Service director, the vice
president for development, the vice
president and dean of the Medical
School and the athletics director.
