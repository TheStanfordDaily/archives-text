Not just copies anymore
The Stanford Publication Services Copy Center has a new
name and a new face. But the differences aren't just cosmetic.
A new DocuTech™ Production Publisher from Xerox has
transformed traditional copy services. Now text, graphics,
and even photographs can be scanned, merged digitally, then
turned into professionally bound and finished publications.
Document Express offers all of the advantages of a quick
print shop - right on campus. Create a 25-page report, add
graphics, insert tabs, print it on recycled paper - the options
are nearly endless, the prices competitive, the turnaround fast.
But not all of our news is in black and white. We also have
a new Xerox color copier that's turning out crisp color
copies. Create an eye-catching poster or add a 4-color
cover to the catalog you created on the DocuTech. Finally,
we promise a renewed emphasis on quality and service,
with every-day standards like free pick-up and delivery.
The only thing that's stayed the same is our location! Stop by or call for details. Tresidder Union 723-3132
