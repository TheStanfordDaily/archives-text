New Summer Quarter Course
Quantitative Analysis of
Public Policy Decisions
Wednesday & Friday, 10:00 -11:30 AM
ABOUT THE COURSE
Many of the most important problems faced today by individuals and communities
are issues of public policy. These include problems associated with environmental quality,
health care, natural resources, technology development, transportation and
communication infrastructure, and the like. The purpose of this course is to provide
students with experience applying quantitative analytical methods to these problems. The
course will be decision-oriented, emphasizing the use of quantitative analysis to
understand these problems and provide the basis for choosing a suitable course of action.
Working in groups of three or four, students will work on a single public policy
problem for the entire quarter. The problem may be one they identify themselves, or one
suggested by the instructors. The end product of each group's work will be a presentation
and paper containing recommendations for addressing the problem, and describing the
approach used to reach this recommendation. The project work will be complemented by
lectures and discussions on the analytical process, illustrated in large part with examples
drawn from the instructors' experience. All types of public policy problems are "fair
game". However, the instructors have particular experience in environmental, energy and
technology issues.
The key prerequisite for the course is adequate training in relevant quantitative
analytical methods. These methods include decision analysis, economic analysis, dynamic
systems and optimization. Students should have taken at least three of the four pertinent
EES courses (231, 212 A, 201 A and 241), or have equivalent preparation. Students with
other backgrounds may be admitted after consultation with the instructors.
