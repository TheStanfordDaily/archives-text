Cease-fire holds
TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — More than 2,300 Muslim
refugees took advantage of a
oease-fire and a rare relief convoy
yesterday to flee the cold, hunger
and encircling Serb forces at the
eastern Bosnian enclave of Sre
brenica.
The refugees — women, chil
dren and old men — were packed
so tightly into the 19 U.N. trucks
that they had to stand on their
luggage. But they waved with
relief as they reached safety in
the Bosnian government-held
city ofTuzla.
The cease-fire has been the
most successful so far of the
nearly yearlong Bosnian war. It
went into effect at noon Sunday,
and U.N. officials reported no
mqjor violations.
U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-
Ghali asked the Security Coun
cil yesterday to approve the
peace plan and urge Bosnian

Serbs to sign it.
More base closures?
WASHINGTON (AP) - An
independent panel, overturning a
decision by Defense Secretary Lea
Aspin, has added two California
military bases to the list of those
being considered for closure.
The 7-0 vote yesterday to add
McClellan Air Force Base near
Sacramento and the Army lan
guage school at the Presidio of
Monterey shows "the commis
sion is truly independent," said
its chairman, Jim Courter.
"We are not anybody's rubber
stamp," he said.
The Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission
also voted unanimously to con
sider the Naval Air Station in
Agana, Guam, and the Great
Lakes Naval Training Center
near Chicago, for closure. The
Navy had recommended that
both be kept open.
