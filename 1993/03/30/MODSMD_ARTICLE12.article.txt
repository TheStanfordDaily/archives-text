# Yeltsin's powers undercut by Congress
## Lawmakers amend referendum, rescind presidential appointment decree 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Lawmakers undercut
President Boris Yeltsin's power again yester
day and authorized an April referendum to let
voters pass judgment on Russia's painful eco
nomic reforms.
Closing out a raucous, four-day emergency
session, parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov
proclaimed they had blocked a presidential coup.
Legislators also created a commission to investi
gate the defiant speech Yeltsin made to support
ers Sunday, calling it an "open call for revolt."
Yeltsin's aides scoffed at the moves by the
Congress of People's Deputies. They said Yeltsin
still might call his own plebiscite, raising the
prospect of two competing nationwide ballots on
April 25.
In their latest slap at his powers, legislators
voted 535-213 to rescind the president's 1991
decree appointing personal "representatives" in
regions across Russia. Yeltsin relies on the 66
officials to promote his reforms.
The effect of the decision was hard to gauge.
In most cases, his representatives hold other
positions in local governments, which they
would retain despite yesterday's vote.
In their most potent resolution, the lawmak
ers scheduled a binding referendum for April 25
to put four questions to the voters.

Two will ask whether Russia should hold
early elections for president and for parliament.
A third will ask whether voters have confidence
in the president.
Voters also will be asked whether they
approve of the free-market reforms Yeltsin
began in 1992 — a question that presidential
aides denounced as being designed to elicit a
"no" vote.
Most Russians saw their living standards fall
sharply last year because of skyrocketing prices.
Although opinion polls say many people support
Yeltsin personally, they are angzy about the
economy.
The Congress adopted amendments requir
ing each question to be approved by at least 50
percent of all eligible voters, instead of just those
casting ballots.
Although his ratings are high in the polls,
Yeltsin would be hard pressed to attract enough
people to the voting booth. In his 1991 election
victory, Yeltsin won support from less than 43
percent of eligible voters —■ although he got
more 60 percent of all votes cast.
"The president must now prepare for the ref
erendum carefully," said Leonid Gurevich, a pro-
Yeltsin lawmaker. "It will be very difficult for
him to win the support of more than half, espe

daily in the spring" during planting season.
Hard-liners hope to force Yeltsin out of office
with the confidence question, even though law
makers admit it has no legal force. Yeltsin
declared at a rally Sunday that he would resign if
rejected by the voters.
"The president has promised us he will resign
if he doesn't get the people's confidence," said a
hard-line leader, Sergei Baburin. "(Let's hope)
he's an honest person."
With the failure of hard-liners to vote Yeltsin
from office Sunday, the Congress session seemed
to leave the president and lawmakers in a bitter
draw and intensified the power struggle that has
paralyzed government for nearly a year.
The president's legal options were limited,
and some pro-Yeltsin lawmakers said his best
route was simply to ignore decisions by the
Congress.
"The Congress has turned into an infernal
machine for destroying civic peace and political
stability," presidential spokesman Vyacheslav
Kostikov said.
Khasbulatov, Yeltsin's main political rival,
closed the session by accusing the president of
mounting "a fairly simple attempt to commit a
coup d'etat," alluding to Yeltsin's declaration of
"special powers" on March 20.
