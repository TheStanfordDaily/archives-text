# Oscar night delivers few surprises; 'Unforgiven' wins Best Picture
## 
### N'Gai Croal Editorial staff 
The "Year of the Woman couldn't stop
Clint Eastwood from storming to victory.
As expected, the Hollywood veteran's
brooding revisionist western, "Unforgiv
en," claimed both Best Picture and Best
Director honors last night in the 65th
annual Acadamy Aeaeds.
"Unforgiven'' became only the third
western in Academy Award history to win
Best Picture. Previous winners include the
1931 film "Cimarron" and 1990's "Dances
With Wolves."
The acting awards, for the most part,
didn't provide any surprises. As most
media mavens predicted, Emma Thomp
son won Best Actress for her role as the
freethinking Margaret Schlegel in
"Howard's End."

Eight-time Oscar nominee A 1 Pacino,
who'd never won, despite his brilliant per
formances in such films as "The Godfa
ther Part II" and "Sea of Love," finally
overcame his jinx. He won Best Actor for
his performance as a blind and bitter
retired colonel in "Scent of a Woman."
Also no surprise was Gene Hackman's
win as Best Supporting Actor for "Unfor
given," in which he played a sadistic small
town sheriff. It was his second Oscar; he
won Best Actor in 1971 for the action
thriller, "The French Connection."
But virtually no one predicted that
newcomer Marisa Tomei would take home
the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for
her role as Joe Pesci's kooky girlfriend in
"My Cousin Vinny." Tomei won over such
noted talents as Judy Davis of "Husbands
and Wives" and Miranda Richardson of
"Damage."

Though "Unforgiven" didn't sweep the
nug'or awards, as did past Best Picture win
ners "Dances With Wolves" and"The
Silence of the Lambs," its four awards,
including Best Film Editing, were the most
won by any of the films in competition.
"Pacino's throat was dry, and mine was
really dry," said Eastwood as he accepted
his directing trophy to a standing ovation.
Despite a career that spans more than
three decades, Eastwood had never been
previously nominated.
"You broke my streak," joked Pacino,
referring to his six previous nominations
without a win.
In the middle of a rambling speech that
threatened to rival Jonathan Demme's of
last year, Pacino said, "Indulge me for a
minute, because I'm not used to this." He
also received a standing ovation, befitting
his status as one of Hollywood's most

respected actors.
"Howard's End," a British tragicomedy
of manners that shared a leading nine
nominations with "Unforgiven," won
awards for both Art Direction and Best
Adapted Screenplay for Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala's script, based on E.M. Forster's
classic novel.
Writer-director Neil Jordan's dark
horse hit, "The Crying Game," did not go
unrecognized, winning the award for Best
Original Screenplay.
Disney's "Aladdin," which was the top
grossing film of 1992, swept the music
awards. Alan Menken won the award for
Best Original Score, while he and his new
songwriting partner, Tim Rice, won the
Best Song award for "A Whole New
World."
Robert Redford's "A River Runs
Through It" won the Oscar for Best Cine

matography, awarded to Philippe Rous
selot. "The Last of the Mohicans" won
Best Sound, and the black comedy, "Death
Becomes Her," won Best Visual Effects.
But the big winner in the technical cat
egories was Francis Ford Coppola's latest
apocalypse, "Bram Stoker's Dracula,"
which won awards for Eiko Ishioka's stun
ning costumes, as well as awards for make
up and sound-effects editing.
The big question in the minds of Holly
wood cognoscenti: what would Best Sup
porting Actor nominee Jaye Davidson
("The Crying Game") wear to the awards?
Tux or gown? Davidson — like "Saturday
Night lave" 's Pat — chose androgyny,
wearing a long black coat over tight-fitting
pants and boots, his hair up in a bun.
