## To honor the code 
### 
The Honor Code has to
be followed by everyone
in order to be effective

6 ( m HE HONOR CODE IS an
undertaking of the stu-
JL dents, individually and
collectively: 1) that they will not give
or receive aid in examinations; that
they will not give or receive unper
mitted aid in classwork, in the prepa
ration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be used by the
instructor as the basis of grading 2)
that they will do their share and take
an active part in seeing to it that oth
ers as well as themselves uphold the
spirit and letter of the Honor Code."
So begins the Stanford Honor
Code, which each student must sign
before taking an examination. How
ever, recent allegations of cheating
on two winter-quarter final exams
indicate that some students' signa
tures are not worthy of their fellow
students' trust.
Students in both Geophysics 4,
"Natural Hazards of Man," and Phi
losophy CIV have complained that
certain individuals received informa
tion about the final exam from stu
dents who took the test early. The
Office of Judicial Affairs is currently
investigating the matter and is wait
ing for more students with informa
tion to come forward.
Such violations of the Honor
Code, even by one or two students,
are unacceptable. Such behavior
reflects poorly upon the Stanford
student body as a whole.
Students who take exams early
and give out information about the
test may think they're helping a few
individuals. But they are turning
their backs on their friends, dorm
mates and classmates by skewing
test results and endangering the
privileges of all Stanford students.
Stanford students must prove,
not only through their signatures
but through their actions, that they
are worthy of the privilege of an
honor code. The faculty and

administration trust students
enough to give unproctored
exams, a rare luxury at colleges.
Students may take exams any
where they wish, and are not sub
ject to searches prior to entering
an exam.
However, trust is not an uncondi
tional situation; it must be earned
and maintained. If the violations
continue, Stanford will be forced to
change its exam procedures, and stu
dents will go from being "innocent
until proven guilty" to suffering
from "guilt by association."
Many privileges given to students
could be in jeopardy if violations of
the Honor Code continue. For exam
ple, in order to accommodate stu
dents with conflicting exams and
travel schedules, professors allow
certain students to take exams early.
Abuse of this favor could lead to a
decrease in instructor flexibility and
stricter rules regarding early test
taking. Faculty respect for students
may decrease.
The bottom line is that those who
violated the Honor Code have put
the unique academic atmosphere at
Stanford at risk, and it is their duty
to remedy the situation.
As the Honor Code states, stu
dents who violated the code or have
information about those who did
should "do their share" and come
forward with any information they
have. Hundreds of innocent students
have already been inconvenienced
because the finals for both classes
will not count and final grades are
being temporarily withheld.
It is one thing to betray fellow stu
dents once, but to continue the
betrayal is a constant slap in the face.
Students with any information
regarding the alleged Honor Code
infractions should not hesitate to aid
in the investigation.
The Honor Code is not something
to be taken lightly. It must be agreed
to and followed by every member of
the Stanford community in order for
it to work.. If the faculty are holding
up their end of the bargain, then the
student body as a whole must not
neglect their responsibility to come
through on its promise.
