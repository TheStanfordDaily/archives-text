## The 						price ya' pay for sinning 
### 
Sinners, ye shall pay our
taxes. It's a winning slogan, I can
tell. It's uncontroversial and prof
it-rendering, unlike other government
programs. Best of all, it's specific.
Example: Smokers, ye whose person
al hygiene offends us so, shall pay for
our health care.
Example: Lottery players, with your
ignorance of good cost-benefit analysis,
shall pay for better education.
Sin tax, nothin' better. Uncle Sam
gets all the money, none of the guilt.
Just like Weight Watchers.
Who feels sorry for the smoker who
pays taxes on each pack of cigarettes he
buys? No one. Probably not even the
smoker himself. After all, can 200 mil
lion non-smoking Americans be wrong?
Sin Tax. It's regressive taxation of
the best kind. The lrind of regressive tax
that those pesky bleeding-heart types
won't make a big ruckus about. They'll
probably even promote it. Sure its
regressive with respect to income, but
it's also regressive with respect to
morals. And that's the great part.
We might get a little queasy loading
extra taxes on someone who lives in the
projects, but if they are morally impov
erished — if they make unpopular per
sonal choices — well, then pile it on.
Alas, our college-educated politicians
have been so slow in recognizing the
possibilities. Why, for instance, aren't

the producers of Murphy Brown paying
Anti-Family taxes for their morally irre
sponsible programming?
And why, pray tell, isn't NBC paying
a Violence-Glorification tax on their
profits from certain shows? "Homicide:
Life on the Street" and "Law and
Order" are shown back to back, for
God's sake (that's on Wednesday
nights, you little rascals). Sure, they
have little things called "rights" to
make such shows, but shouldn't they
have to pay to exercise those rights?
The profit potential is amazing.
Those without marriage certification
could be forced to pay a "Prom night"
tax on condoms and other forms of birth
control.
All of us, save Pollyanna, should ante
up for our sinning. We could get rid of
this deficit thing in no time. Heck, with
all the sinning that goes on, we could
have welfare recipients living in posh
mansions in Beverly Hills. We could
have superconductors in every state, not
just Texas. We could reopen those mili
tary bases which were victims of the
Pentagon hit list. It's gonna be a bright,
bright, bright, sunshiny day.
Back to reality.
I realize it might be unfeasible to
proceed with this program. Homosexu
als would learn ways around paying
their Alternative-Lifestyle tax. Other
problems would ensue.

But as long as we have to live with
sin taxes, I would offer one serious pro
posal. How about legalizing gambling
on sporting events? Those of us with
that nasty — oh so nasty — urge to
wager on sports could satiate ourselves,
and put money away in state coffers at
the same time.
Allowing this kind of activity might
be scary for some. But we promise, we'll
be good. Sure, we might gain a few gam
bling addicts, but we don't outlaw food
on account of Oprah Winfrey and John
Madden, do we?
And to those who still fear this state
endorsed sinning, I say: more sinning
for us equals more money for you. Plus,
I think illegal sports gambling goes on
already. Just ask that secretary who
had an unexplained interest in Western
Kentucky's fate in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Give me $50 on Michigan. I'll pay the
tax.

John Ford spent his Spring Break in
Las Vegas trying to win enough cash to
be able to go see the Fab Five in action in
New Orleans. Unfortunately, though,
he's now on the run from a loan shark
named Vinny.
