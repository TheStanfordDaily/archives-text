Names of those found guilty of misconduct should be published

THE LATEST CHEATING scandal
at Stanford casts a shadow over
the reputation of all current stu
dents in ways far more direct than most
imagine.
So long as secrecy surrounds the out
come of campus disciplinary hearings,
the University can not officially clear
those innocent of any wrongdoing.
At the moment, that may be of great
est concern to those enrolled in the
courses where the cheating allegedly

happened. But long-term the effect is far
wider, for Honor Code cases happen
almost every year in a variety of gradu
ate and undergraduate courses.
Without a public record of those
found guilty, alumni can not "prove"
their innocence if questions of miscon
duct arise decades later â€” as they do,
with increasing frequency.
The solution is simple: when a stu
dent is found guilty of misconduct, pub
lish the charge, a summary of the find

ings, the penalty and a response from
the student (including a continued claim
of innocence) in both The Daily and
Campus Report.
This would have immediate educa
tional value for the community. It would
reduce hearsay, gossip and unwarranted
smearing of the innocent.
Once made public, a disciplinary
record would not necessarily have to be
made part of a student's official tran
script. But it would provide a means of

clearing those not found guilty when
allegations arise years later.
The present provisions for privacy in
the campus judicial charter won't
change until a clear mtuority of students
understand their good name is at stake.
It would add little or nothing to the
$100,000 cost many now pay for the
prestige of a Stanford degree.

Co Ho incident opens students 9 eyes to discrimination at Stanford

Many people feel that
Stanford is overly sensitive
and that discrimination could
never happen in our "politically cor
rect" community. A recent incident at
the Coffee House made us painfully
aware that such is not the case.
In addition to the usual nighttime
crowd at the Coffee House, there were
popular musicians performing, which

meant an even larger than usual
crowd. In spite of the fact that there
were many people lined up all along
the bar, the management singled out a
woman in a wheelchair, calling her an
"obstruction" and telling her to move.
She insisted she was not an
"obstruction," but a person and
agreed to move as long as the other
people against the bar were made to
move as well. After all, she was no

more in the way than the others. If
she was an obstruction, so was every
one else in the path. Apparently the
Coffee House management disagreed.
Faced with the choice of leaving or
sitting in a space where she could nei
ther see the stage nor be with her
friends, this woman left. She is not a
Stanford student and had come to
campus specifically for the perfor
mance, but felt so harassed that she

was essentially forced to leave before
the group even took the stage.
We are embarrassed that such bla
tant discrimination could happen on
our campus.
