# A 						muddled bequest
## Stanford, Christian Science Church to negotiate over $98 million 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Federal agents aren't the only ones trying to end a long
stand-off with a religious group these days; Stanford lawyers
are still attempting to settle a year-long legal fight with the
Christian Science Church over a $98 million bequest.
In a significant breakthrough, University lawyers last week
opened discussions for the first time with attorneys represent
ing the church in an effort to resolve the protracted court battle.
The money in question comes from the trusts of sisters
Eloise Mabury Knapp and Bella Mabury. The sisters' wills
leave a total of more than $98 million to the Boston-based
First Church of Christ, Scientist, on the condition that the
church publish and distribute "The Destiny of the Mother
Church" — a biography of church founder Mary Baker Eddy
written by Bliss Knapp, Eloise Mabury's husband.
If, however, the church fails to fully distribute the book,
the trusts state that the money is to be split between Stan
ford and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
In December 1991, the estate trustees asked a Los Ange

les Superior Court judge to give the money to the church. In
February 1992, however, lawyers for Stanford and the mu
seum sought to block the distribution of the money, claiming
that the church had not properly published and circulated
the biography. Since that time, the two sides have been
wrangling in court over the estates.
The beginning of negotiations, which were announced in
a joint statement released Friday, provide a chance for the
two sides to settle without a trial. Still, any agreement the
parties reach will have to be approved by the court.
Senior University counsel Carol Swenson yesterday said
that she did not know how long negotiations would last.
The biography has generated controversy in the church
because some Christian Scientists see the book as equating
Eddy with Jesus.
Attorneys for Stanford and the museum argue that the bi
ography is not labelled as "authorized literature" by the
church. In addition, they point to a study published last year
by the London Independent newspaper stating only about 30

The biography has generated controversy in the church

Attorneys for Stanford and the museum argue that the bi
ography is not labelled as "authorized literature" by the
church. In addition, they point to a study published last year
by the London Independent newspaper stating only about 30
percent of 150 Christian Sci
ence reading rooms surveyed
carried the biography.
The church, however, claims
that about 97 percent of its
reading rooms carry the book.
In addition, they say that
although the book does not
carry an "authorized literature"
label, it is indeed authorized by
the church.
Attempts to settle the dis
pute through the courts have
been long and filled with

delays. For example, Judge
Harmon Scoville, who had been
overseeing discovery in the
cases since last fall, resigned in
January citing ill health, Swen
son said.
Scoville's retirement means
that much of the pre-trial work
has to be redone, Swenson said,
but the courts have yet to
appoint a new discovery referee
to continue Scoville's work.
Discovery is the process in
which each side in a legal battle
gets evidence from the other
side.
The parties' next court date
is scheduled for April 29 in Los
Angeles.
