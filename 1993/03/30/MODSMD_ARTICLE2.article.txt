Federal agents aren't the only ones trying to end a long
stand-off with a religious group these days; Stanford lawyers
are still attempting to settle a year-long legal fight with the
Christian Science Church over a $98 million bequest.
In a significant breakthrough, University lawyers last week
opened discussions for the first time with attorneys represent
ing the church in an effort to resolve the protracted court battle.
The money in question comes from the trusts of sisters
Eloise Mabury Knapp and Bella Mabury. The sisters' wills
leave a total of more than $98 million to the Boston-based
First Church of Christ, Scientist, on the condition that the
church publish and distribute "The Destiny of the Mother

written by Bliss Knapp, Eloise Mabury's husband.
If, however, the church fails to fully distribute the book,
the trusts state that the money is to be split between Stan

February 1992, however, lawyers for Stanford and the mu

that the church had not properly published and circulated
the biography. Since that time, the two sides have been
wrangling in court over the estates.
The beginning of negotiations, which were announced in
a joint statement released Friday, provide a chance for the
two sides to settle without a trial. Still, any agreement the
parties reach will have to be approved by the court.
Senior University counsel Carol Swenson yesterday said
that she did not know how long negotiations would last.
The biography has generated controversy in the church
because some Christian Scientists see the book as equating
Eddy with Jesus.
Attorneys for Stanford and the museum argue that the bi
ography is not labelled as "authorized literature" by the
church. In addition, they point to a study published last year
by the London Independent newspaper stating only about 30
