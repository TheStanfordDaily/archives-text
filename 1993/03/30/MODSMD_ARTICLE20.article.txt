## Val Whiting closes book on brilliant Stanford career 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
The tears behind the towel wrote a
cruel ending to an otherwise magnificent
and joyous era.
More than 2,000 points and 1,100
rebounds after she first donned a Stanford
Cardinal uniform, all-everything Val
Whiting hid her face from the final sec
onds of her college basketball career.
Colorado fired free-throw after free
throw like gunshots at the senior's chest,
and the disappointment consumed her ...
But this is not a sad story.
The clouds of pain created by not win
ning the NCAA title this year will eventu
ally pass — revealing the energy and bril
liance of Whiting's contributions to Stan
ford basketball.
During Whiting's four years, the 6-
foot-3 center and her teammates won two
national championships and reached the
NCAA Final Four in three consecutive
seasons. Much of the success resulted
from what Whiting gave of herself and
from the way her teammates fed off her
effort.
"There were games," Whiting's team
mate and classmate Molly Goodenbour
recalls, "when there'd be a definite change
in the look on her face, the way she called
for the ball. You knew she was going to
take over the game."
Goodenbour adds that Whiting's exam
ple inspired others to excel. "She's a great
player because of her ability to make other
players better just by her presence on the
floor."
Whiting had an impact on the team as
soon as she arrived at Stanford. During
the previous season, the Cardinal was
already very good, led by then-juniors Jen
nifer Azzi and Katy Steding. But ham
pered by a lack of rebounding, that team
fell one victory short of the national semi
finals, losing to Louisiana Tech in the
Midwest Regional final.
The next year, the freshman from

Wilmington, Del., didn't start a game, but
Whiting did provide a remedy for Stan
ford's weakness. Despite coming off the
bench, Whiting led the team in rebound
ing, and the Cardinal rolled to a record of
32-1 and the school's first national cham
pionship in women's basketball.

"She came in and gave us a dimension
that our team really needed — physical,
aggressive play," coach Tar a VanDerveer
said, reflecting on Whiting's immediate
impact. "Her rebounding was the thing
she contributed most to the team."
For her season-long performance,
which included 12.4 points and 1.8
blocked shots per game, as well as the sec
ond-highest field goal percentage in the
Pacific 10 Conference, Whiting was
named national Freshman of the Year by
Women's Basketball News Service. She
also garnered Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors.
Of course, the rebounds Whiting cor
ralled her freshman year were just a small
sample of what was to come. The senior
finished her career with 2,077 points and
1,134 boards, both the most in either
Stanford or Pac-10 history.
"It's luck, really," Whiting says humbly

when asked about her rebound
ing prowess. "Defensively, it's
basically boxing out; but offen
sively, it's being in the right
place, fighting for position."
The superstar's genuine mod
esty pervades all conversations
about her accomplishments. Typ
ical of her refusal to boast, she
seizes the opportunity to give
credit to one of her teammates.
"The best offensive rebounder
on our team is Rachel (Hemmer).
I don't know how she does it all
the time," Whiting marvels.
"Offensive rebounds — I'm just
happy when I get one. And then
it's, 'Yeah, I got an offensive
rebound.' "
VanDerveer notes that "Val
invests a lot in playing basketball";
the two championship banners that
hang in Maples Pavilion are the
most noteworthy dividends.
VanDerveer also holds that
the rewards of Whiting's invest
ment in basketball can be seen in
her steady improvement
throughout her career. As good
as she was upon arrival, Whiting
expanded her talents, constantly
adding to the number of ways in
which she could help Stanford
win.
"She really improved her scor
ing and shooting," VanDerveer
says. "She moved further and
further from the basket and con
tinued to score .... Her condi
tioning, her defense — she really
improved those, too."
With the improvements, Whit
ing and teammates won a second
national championship in the
center's junior year. Whiting was
named Pac-10 Player of the Year
for her success. Her 18.5 points
and 9.1 rebounds per game also
earned her Kodak First-Team
Ail-American honors.
Asked about VanDerveer's
influence on her, Whiting stress
es her coach's ability both to psy
che her up and calm her down.
"Tara's a great motivator,"

Whiting says. "She has a good
way of saying something to make
a player mad, and that's how I get
motivated. She'll say, 'You're not
doing this today,' and I'll say to
myself, 'I'm not doing that
wrong. I'll show her.'
"Also," Whiting continues,
"she's very complimentary
about you, and she makes you
want to work harder." Whiting
says she especially appreciates
the times VanDerveer has come
up to her and said, "You're
doing fine; don't worry about
the pressure on you or the
expectations."
As the tears at the end of the
loss to Colorado suggested, Whit
ing puts plenty of pressure on
herself. Before the team left for
the West Regional game, Whiting
refused to evaluate the still
incomplete season.
"We'll see how it ends before I
let you know (how things have
gone)," she said. With the season
ending defeat, the answer is
understood to be negative.
As for the future, Whiting
wants to be a doctor, perhaps a
pediatrician or a sports physician.
Last summer, she interned in the
neurology department at Stan
ford Hospital and was able to
watch brain surgery and to inter
act with epilepsy patients.
Whiting, whose capacity for
caring must be limitless if the
heart she displays on the basket
ball court is any measure, enjoyed
the experience and hopes to
intern again at the hospital this
summer.
Then, in order to make some
money to pay for medical school
— and to be able to keep playing
basketball — Whiting is consider
ing playing professionally in
Europe for a few years.
"Basketball will stand out,"
she says of her Stanford experi
ence. But Whiting is thinking
seriously of the next chapter in
her life.
"If I get into a good medical
school and I'm doing well there,
I'll be happy with that, too," she
said. "Stanford will have pre
pared me well."

"She came in and gave us a dimension
that our team really needed — physical,
aggressive play," coach Tar a VanDerveer
said, reflecting on Whiting's immediate
impact. "Her rebounding was the thing
she contributed most to the team."
For her season-long performance,
which included 12.4 points and 1.8
blocked shots per game, as well as the sec
ond-highest field goal percentage in the
Pacific 10 Conference, Whiting was
named national Freshman of the Year by
Women's Basketball News Service. She
also garnered Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors.
Of course, the rebounds Whiting cor
ralled her freshman year were just a small
sample of what was to come. The senior
finished her career with 2,077 points and
1,134 boards, both the most in either
Stanford or Pac-10 history.
"It's luck, really," Whiting says humbly

when asked about her rebound
ing prowess. "Defensively, it's
basically boxing out; but offen
sively, it's being in the right
place, fighting for position."
The superstar's genuine mod
esty pervades all conversations
about her accomplishments. Typ
ical of her refusal to boast, she
seizes the opportunity to give
credit to one of her teammates.
"The best offensive rebounder
on our team is Rachel (Hemmer).
I don't know how she does it all
the time," Whiting marvels.
"Offensive rebounds — I'm just
happy when I get one. And then
it's, 'Yeah, I got an offensive
rebound.' "
VanDerveer notes that "Val
invests a lot in playing basketball";
the two championship banners that
hang in Maples Pavilion are the
most noteworthy dividends.
VanDerveer also holds that
the rewards of Whiting's invest
ment in basketball can be seen in
her steady improvement
throughout her career. As good
as she was upon arrival, Whiting
expanded her talents, constantly
adding to the number of ways in
which she could help Stanford
win.
"She really improved her scor
ing and shooting," VanDerveer
says. "She moved further and
further from the basket and con
tinued to score .... Her condi
tioning, her defense — she really
improved those, too."
With the improvements, Whit
ing and teammates won a second
national championship in the
center's junior year. Whiting was
named Pac-10 Player of the Year
for her success. Her 18.5 points
and 9.1 rebounds per game also
earned her Kodak First-Team
Ail-American honors.
Asked about VanDerveer's
influence on her, Whiting stress
es her coach's ability both to psy
che her up and calm her down.
"Tara's a great motivator,"

Whiting says. "She has a good
way of saying something to make
a player mad, and that's how I get
motivated. She'll say, 'You're not
doing this today,' and I'll say to
myself, 'I'm not doing that
wrong. I'll show her.'
"Also," Whiting continues,
"she's very complimentary
about you, and she makes you
want to work harder." Whiting
says she especially appreciates
the times VanDerveer has come
up to her and said, "You're
doing fine; don't worry about
the pressure on you or the
expectations."
As the tears at the end of the
loss to Colorado suggested, Whit
ing puts plenty of pressure on
herself. Before the team left for
the West Regional game, Whiting
refused to evaluate the still
incomplete season.
"We'll see how it ends before I
let you know (how things have
gone)," she said. With the season
ending defeat, the answer is
understood to be negative.
As for the future, Whiting
wants to be a doctor, perhaps a
pediatrician or a sports physician.
Last summer, she interned in the
neurology department at Stan
ford Hospital and was able to
watch brain surgery and to inter
act with epilepsy patients.
Whiting, whose capacity for
caring must be limitless if the
heart she displays on the basket
ball court is any measure, enjoyed
the experience and hopes to
intern again at the hospital this
summer.
Then, in order to make some
money to pay for medical school
— and to be able to keep playing
basketball — Whiting is consider
ing playing professionally in
Europe for a few years.
"Basketball will stand out,"
she says of her Stanford experi
ence. But Whiting is thinking
seriously of the next chapter in
her life.
"If I get into a good medical
school and I'm doing well there,
I'll be happy with that, too," she
said. "Stanford will have pre
pared me well."
The tears behind the towel wrote a
cruel ending to an otherwise magnificent
and joyous era.
More than 2,000 points and 1,100
rebounds after she first donned a Stanford
Cardinal uniform, all-everything Val
Whiting hid her face from the final sec
onds of her college basketball career.
Colorado fired free-throw after free
throw like gunshots at the senior's chest,
and the disappointment consumed her ...
But this is not a sad story.
The clouds of pain created by not win
ning the NCAA title this year will eventu
ally pass — revealing the energy and bril
liance of Whiting's contributions to Stan
ford basketball.
During Whiting's four years, the 6-
foot-3 center and her teammates won two
national championships and reached the
NCAA Final Four in three consecutive
seasons. Much of the success resulted
from what Whiting gave of herself and
from the way her teammates fed off her
effort.
"There were games," Whiting's team
mate and classmate Molly Goodenbour
recalls, "when there'd be a definite change
in the look on her face, the way she called
for the ball. You knew she was going to
take over the game."
Goodenbour adds that Whiting's exam
ple inspired others to excel. "She's a great
player because of her ability to make other
players better just by her presence on the
floor."
Whiting had an impact on the team as
soon as she arrived at Stanford. During
the previous season, the Cardinal was
already very good, led by then-juniors Jen
nifer Azzi and Katy Steding. But ham
pered by a lack of rebounding, that team
fell one victory short of the national semi
finals, losing to Louisiana Tech in the
Midwest Regional final.
The next year, the freshman from

Wilmington, Del., didn't start a game, but
Whiting did provide a remedy for Stan
ford's weakness. Despite coming off the
bench, Whiting led the team in rebound
ing, and the Cardinal rolled to a record of
32-1 and the school's first national cham
pionship in women's basketball.
