## Val Whiting closes book on brilliant Stanford career 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
The tears behind the towel wrote a
cruel ending to an otherwise magnificent
and joyous era.
More than 2,000 points and 1,100
rebounds after she first donned a Stanford
Cardinal uniform, all-everything Val
Whiting hid her face from the final sec
onds of her college basketball career.
Colorado fired free-throw after free
throw like gunshots at the senior's chest,
and the disappointment consumed her ...
But this is not a sad story.
The clouds of pain created by not win
ning the NCAA title this year will eventu
ally pass — revealing the energy and bril
liance of Whiting's contributions to Stan
ford basketball.
During Whiting's four years, the 6-
foot-3 center and her teammates won two
national championships and reached the
NCAA Final Four in three consecutive
seasons. Much of the success resulted
from what Whiting gave of herself and
from the way her teammates fed off her
effort.
"There were games," Whiting's team
mate and classmate Molly Goodenbour
recalls, "when there'd be a definite change
in the look on her face, the way she called
for the ball. You knew she was going to
take over the game."
Goodenbour adds that Whiting's exam
ple inspired others to excel. "She's a great
player because of her ability to make other
players better just by her presence on the
floor."
Whiting had an impact on the team as
soon as she arrived at Stanford. During
the previous season, the Cardinal was
already very good, led by then-juniors Jen
nifer Azzi and Katy Steding. But ham
pered by a lack of rebounding, that team
fell one victory short of the national semi
finals, losing to Louisiana Tech in the
Midwest Regional final.
The next year, the freshman from

Wilmington, Del., didn't start a game, but
Whiting did provide a remedy for Stan
ford's weakness. Despite coming off the
bench, Whiting led the team in rebound
ing, and the Cardinal rolled to a record of
32-1 and the school's first national cham
pionship in women's basketball.

the game. 1

"She came in and gave us a dimension
that our team really needed — physical,
aggressive play," coach Tar a VanDerveer
said, reflecting on Whiting's immediate
impact. "Her rebounding was the thing
she contributed most to the team."
For her season-long performance,
which included 12.4 points and 1.8
blocked shots per game, as well as the sec
ond-highest field goal percentage in the
Pacific 10 Conference, Whiting was
named national Freshman of the Year by
Women's Basketball News Service. She
also garnered Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors.
Of course, the rebounds Whiting cor
ralled her freshman year were just a small
sample of what was to come. The senior
finished her career with 2,077 points and
1,134 boards, both the most in either
Stanford or Pac-10 history.
"It's luck, really," Whiting says humbly
