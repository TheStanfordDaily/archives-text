# Stanford wrestlers struggle at NCAAs
## Johnson, Aguirre fall short of expectations 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
"You have to be good and
lucky," said Stanford's fresh
man wrestler Jimmy Aguirre
after his performance at the
NCAA wrestling champi
onships.
Before the meet, which was
held March 18 through 20 at
lowa State, 134-pound Aguirre
and his 142-pound junior co-cap
tain Lance Johnson had already
proven they were good. Aguirre
had captured the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship Feb. 28
through March 1, and had also
won the Outstanding Wrestler
Award for the tournament. Like
wise at the Pac-10 tourney,

1 wasn't at 100
percent, and so I
didn't wrestle 100
percent. It was
disappointing.'
â€” Jimmy Aquirre

Johnson fought his way to a
fourth-place finish and secured a
wildcard bid to return to the
NCAA Tournament for a second
time.
However, the national cham
pionships proved to be an
unlucky time and place for the
two Cardinal grapplers.
As a wildcard entry, Johnson
needed to win one wildcard
match before entering the stan
dard 32-man bracket for each
weight division. The Stanford co
captain drew Chad Carleson of
Minnesota, and jumped to a 2-0
first period lead with a take
down.
Carleson managed to escape,
and entered the second period
down by one point as he elected
the bottom position on the mat.
By escaping from the bottom
position, Carleson evened the
match at two apiece. Then,
according to Cardinal head coach
Chris Horpel, throughout the
remainder of the second period,
Carleson attempted to score a
point by making it appear as if
Johnson were stalling.
In the third and final period,
Johnson chose the bottom posi
tion and regained the lead by
escaping. Finding himself down
3-2, Carleson resumed his
attempt to get a stall warning
called on Johnson. With 20 sec
onds remaining, Carleson sue

cessfully convinced the referee to
give Johnson a warning for
stalling, which tied the match at
3-3. However, amidst his excite
ment, Johnson did not notice he
was warned, and proceeded to
grab his adversary's leg without
finishing the maneuver with a
takedown for a score. Believing
that he still had a one point lead,
he wrestled defensively.
Meanwhile, Horpel tried to
warn Johnson the score was
even, and he should attempt a
takedown. But the crowd was too
loud. Time ran out, and a sur
prised Johnson found himself in
overtime, where Carleson
jumped on his still-unbelieving
opponent and scored a takedown
for a 5-3 victory.
Johnson could have continued
competing in the consolation
bracket if Carleson had advanced
to the quarterfinals, but Carleson
didn't make it.
Aguirre's troubles began even
before the official weigh-ins. The
No. 10 seed suffered from the flu,
and was upset in the opening
round by unseeded John McCum
ber of Lehigh. In the last five sec
onds of the first period, McCum
ber broke a 0-0 tie by taking
Aguirre to the mat for a nearfall.
"He was already fighting the
flu, and he made mistakes after
he fell behind," Horpel said of
Aguirre. "He just didn't have any
'umpf left."
Aguirre would fall 14-0.
However, McCumber did
advance to the quarterfinals,
qualifying Aguirre for competi
tion in the consolation bracket.
And despite a fever and regurgi
tating after his first match, the
freshman triumphed in his sec
ond round encounter with Joe
Block of Drake, winning 5-3.
"His opponent didn't know he
was sick," Horpel said, "so I just
told Jimmy to fake [being well]."
Aguirre could not keep up his
act, however. He lost his third
round match 11-3 to Erik Saun
ders of Seton Hall. Nevertheless,
Aguirre still finished in the top
13 in his weight division.
"I don't like excuses," Aguirre
said. "I wasn't at 100 percent,
and so I didn't wrestle 100 per
cent. It was disappointing. I can
definitely be All-American."
He will have three more
chances to become just that in
subsequent years, and Johnson
will also have one more year to
assert himself. Aguirre con
curred that their difficult experi
ence this year may turn out for
the better by motivating them.
"I want to get out and wrestle
right now," Aguirre said. "I
have something to prove."
