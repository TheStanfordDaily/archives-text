# Ruggers beat Spartans, Wildcats

*"The Grand Combat."
That's the phrase Stanford
men's rugby coach Franck
Boivert uses to describe the
challenge his players face every
time they take the field.
"Rugby is about 15 players
taking the field and giving
everything they have," said
Boivert. "You must have
courage and trust your team
mates, because it really is a com
bat."
The Cardinal opens its post
season "combat" this weekend
when it travels to the Santa Bar
bara Invitational. The defending
tournament champion, Stanford
is favored to repeat this year,
despite challenges from south
ern California powers Long
Beach State and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. Archrival Califor
nia, who accounted for the only
Cardinal regular-season loss,
will not be traveling to Santa
Barbara.
The Stanford team concluded
its regular season two weeks ago
with victories over San Jose
State and Chico State. The play
ers set aside their studies on
March 13 to challenge the Spar
tans. The Cardinal was looking
for its seventh win, which would
solidify a playoff berth.

What was supposed to be an
easy game for Stanford was
instead tied 3-3 at the half. The
Spartans played an inspired
half, .biJttipg. find. Ufctojag
(A ruck to <?lear opposing
players away from the ball fol
lowing a tackle, to gain posses
sion of the ball.)
The halftime respite was just
what the Stanford team needed,
though, and it came out with
renewed vigor. The Cardinal
managed to shake off its slug
gishness and pull away for a 38-
10 win.
"We only practiced once this
week," said senior-captain
Trevor Brown. "I think our
minds were on the books rather
than in the game."
Chico State traveled to Stan
ford the following day for a Sun
day afternoon game. With a
playoff berth already secured,
the Cardinal was playing for
pride and to earn its eighth vic
tory of the season.
"Today we're just playing to
have a good time," said junior
center Emile Bruneau. "But
having a good time means win
ning, too."
Another slow start by Stan
ford kept Chico State in the
game. Chico's talented back line
found gaps in the Stanford
defense, exploiting a tackling
problem that has plagued the

Cardinal all season. But after
fighting to a 10-10 halftime
score, the Cardinal turned the
game JKVWAi jjv »
... Chico ran up 24 points, the
second-highest total allowed by
the Stanford defense all season,
but the Cardinal offense ran the
ball hard inside in the second
half to prevail, 36-24.
With an 8-1 season behind
them, the Cardinal players are
ready to focus on the week
ahead. "We want to use Santa
Barbara as a tuneup for the
playoffs," said senior lock Ben
Wright. "There will be some
strong teams, so it will be a good
time to gauge our strengths and
weaknesses."
Coach Boivert said this year's
team is one of the best in recent
memory, but its weaknesses are
still readily apparent: "We waste
too many opportunities; we turn
the ball over way too much.
We've got to eliminate the men
tal errors if we are going to
accomplish our goals."
Boivert says his goal is for
the team to play its best in each
game, but the possibility of a
trip to the Final Four of colle
giate rugby is an attractive
prize as well. The West Coast
representative will be deter
mined at the Pacific Coast play
offs, April 16 through 18 in Cor
valis, Ore.
