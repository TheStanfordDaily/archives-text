# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
This week's Athletes of the Week have a
lot in common. They both log in hour after
hour of practice in the water every day, and
they both recently saw their efforts reward
ed with national championship titles.
For Derek Weatherford, last weekend's
men's swimming NCAA Championships pre
sented an opportunity to establish himself as

one of the premier collegiate backstrokers in
the country.
In 1992, the honor of an individual
national title eluded him, as he finished fifth
in the 100 and 200 backstroke and the 200
individual medley. This year, however, he
rose to the occasion, winning the 100 back
stroke on the second day of competition.
In addition, he joined teammates Tyler
Mayfleld, Joe Hudepohl and Trip Zedlitz to
seize the 400 medley relay title by a margin
of nearly three seconds.
The junior from Ft. Myers, Fla. capped off
the meet with a joint victory in the final
event, the 400 free relay.

Senior swim team captain Janel Jor
gensen also had her sights set high going
into the NCAA Championships, held March
18-20. As a freshman, she captured three
individual NCAA events: the 100 butterfly,
200 fly, and 200 IM. Over the next two years
she placed either second and third in these
events, and earned three relay titles.
In her final NCAA appearance, Jorgensen
teamed up with Mary Edwards, Lea Loveless
and Jenny Thompson to win the 200
freestyle relay with a time of 1:30.30. She
was also a member of the championship 400
medley relay and 800 free relay teams.
Her biggest performances, however, came in
the individual arena. The Ridgefield, Conn.,
native won the 100 fly and 200 fly for the sec

ond time in her career, with times of 53.19 and
1:57.43. Overall, she joined teammate Jenny
Thompson and Florida's Nicole Haislett for the
gold in the meet with a total of 57 points,
of time spent away from Stanford. Bravin
redshirted for the 1990-91 season in order to
train for the 1992 Olympics — a move that
paid off with a respectable 37th-place finish
in Barcelona.
