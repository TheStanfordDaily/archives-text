# Batters lose tight contest to Nevada Wolf Pack, 6-5
## Stanford gives up 5-3 lead going into the 9th, falls to 14-12 overall despite strong performances by Bartels, Carver 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Cardinal stretched its losing streak
to five yesterday, dropping a 6-5 heart
breaker to Nevada-Reno in Reno, Nev.
"We're playing hard, but we're making
enough mistakes to lose," said coach Mark
Marquess.
Yesterday's game epitomized the
coach's words. Stanford fielded a
revamped lineup, ran the bags aggressively
and received a fine pitching performance
from starter Todd Bartels — all to no avail.
The game was the Cardinal's to win
from the start. In the second, Stanford
jumped out to a 2-0 lead. Steve Carver
opened the inning with an infield single
to shortstop. Carver, who had been
struggling through a short midseason

slump, picked up three hits on the after
noon.
With Carver running, designated hitter
Nate Olmstead drilled a single through the
hole on the right side of the infield. Brodie
VanWagenen sent a sacrifice fly to left
field, scoring Carver. Rod Meyer, subbing
in center field for Cale Carter, followed
with an infield single of his own, moving
Olmstead to second.
Brian Dallimore made it 2-0, lacing a
single up the middle with two outs, scoring
Olmstead. Dallimore replaced Carter in
the leadoff spot in the lineup, and picked
up two hits.
In the sixth, Stanford stretched its
lead to 4-0. Meyer singled with two outs.
DesJardins then took advantage of the
high-altitude conditions at Peccole Field,
lofting a deep fly over the left-center
field fence 375 feet from home plate. The
shot was DesJardins' second career
home run.
Meanwhile, Bartels was pitching his
best game of the season. The freshman
escaped from a bases-loaded, no-out situa
tion in the second. He induced Jeff Range
to ground a run-scoring double-play ball to
shortstop Jed Hansen, and whiffed Mike
Schoeder.
"This was Todd's best outing by far,"
Marquess said. "He changed speeds very
well and worked out of a couple of jams."
The Cardinal padded its lead further in
ethe eighth. With the score 4-1, Van Wag

nen walked to lead off the inning. Meyer
reached on a fielder's choice, as did Des-
Jardins by virtue of a fielding error by
Wolf-Pack shortstop Mark Lewis.
A Meyer-DesJardins double steal put
them both in scoring position. Dallimore
followed with a grounder to short, with
Meyer beating Lewis' throw to the plate.
But Bartels ran into some difficulties in
the bottom of the eighth, giving up three
singles and a run. In came reliever Mario
Iglesias. The freshman gave up a run-scor
ing sacrifice fly to Chris Singleton, but
ended the Nevada threat by causing Eric
Moreno to fly out to left field.
With Iglesias remaining on the mound,
the Cardinal took a 5-3 lead into the ninth.
After retiring the first Wolf Pack batter,
Iglesias glanced an inside fastball off of the
shirt sleeve of second baseman Drew
Bonifigli.
"That pitch was Iglesias's mistake
pitch," Marquess said. "But it's gonna hap
pen.
Range singled, leaving Iglesias to face
Kevin Lake with runners on first and sec
ond and one out. Lake, who had entered
the game as a pitcher in the seventh, had
already singled in his first plate appear
ance.
Lake deposited Iglesias's first offering
over the wall in center field, giving Nevada
the shocking 6-5 win.
The Cardinal, which dropped to 14-12
on the season, does not see action again
until Friday, when it faces California in
Berkeley. In winning their 13th game in 14
tries, Nevada improved to 17-5-1.
