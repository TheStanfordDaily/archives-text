# No. 2 volleyball cruises by opponents
## Stanford defeats No. 1 UCLA, No. 6 Hawaii, No. 13 Ohio State, UC-Irvine 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Over the past three weeks the Stanford
men's volleyball team has been laying
waste to the rest of the collegiate volley
ball world with five straight wins over No.
1 UCLA, UC-Irvine, No. 13 Ohio State
and No. 6 Hawaii.
The victories stretched the team's win
ning streak to seven games, and placed the
second-ranked Cardinal (13-3,11-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) three
games ahead of second-place Long Beach
State in the Mountain division of the
MPSF. The winner of the Mountain divi
sion plays the winner of the Pacific divi
sion for a coveted automatic berth to the
NCAA men's volleyball Final Four on May
7 at UCLA.
"At this point in the season we could
not have asked to be in a better position,"
said Stanford coach Ruben Nieves.
On March 12 the Cardinal traveled to
Pauley Pavilion to take on a UCLA team
with only one loss. Behind Ail-American
Dave Goss' 41 kills and 15 digs Stanford
was able to rally from a 0-2 game deficit to
declaw the Bruins, 5-15, 11-15, 15-13,15-
6, 15-13.
The following day Stanford was
brought back down to earth as inconsis
tent play almost led to an Anteater victo
ry. UC-Irvine (2-12) won the first game
15-6, holding Stanford to a .156 team hit
ting percentage. Despite a sorely subpar
effort by Goss, who had eight kills and 11
errors to hit a season low negative .100,
the Cardinal was able to stuff the
Anteaters in the next three games, 15-11,
17-15, 15-9. Freshman Mike Lambert led
the team with 17 kills and middle blocker
Joe Burghardt had 9 kills with no errors
to hit .750.
After a week layoff for exams, Stanford
had three practices to get back in shape to
face the 19-6 Buckeyes. The Big-Ten lead
er, Ohio State is one of the highest-ranked
teams west of the Mississippi, but was
unceremoniously spiked out of Maples 15-
4, 15-10, 15-7. The brunt of the Cardinal
attack in its last non-conference match of
the season came from swing hitter Ryan
Moos, who collected 14 kills.
Then, on March 24 and 25 Stanford

faced the University of Hawaii twice in an
all-important series that clearly defined
the Cardinal as the Mountain Division
leader. The first match lasted three hours
and eight minutes.
"It was a long, grueling side-out
match," Nieves said. "Points were really
hard to come by and there were lots of
momentum swings."
The Rainbows came out strong, taking
a commanding 14-7 early lead. But,
sparked by Lambert's off-the-bench per
formance at swing hitter, Stanford clam
ored back into the game. The Cardinal
scored nine unanswered points and eeked
out a 16-14 victory.
This first game set a laborious tone for
the match. Both teams scored in double
figures as the Cardinal gasped out a four
game victory, 16-14, 15-17, 15-13, 15-12.
Gross tallied 39 kills in 74 attempts, his
highest attempt total of the year.
"He seems to have these nights regu
larly where he just gets stronger as the
night goes on," Nieves said of Goss' per
formance. "At the end of the match when
some players were getting tired, Goss was
every bit as strong as he was in the begin
ning."
The highlight of the match was the play
of Cardinal setter Canyon Ceman.
"Canyon kept getting us side out after
side out," Nieves said. "He did a great job
with some good passing, but not great
passing."
In doing so, Ceman set a Stanford sin
gle game assist record with 115, topping
his old mark by one.
The following day's rematch was a bat
tle of two fatigued teams in which Stan
ford's depth prevailed. The Cardinal start
ed two middle blockers who saw little play
ing time the night before and these two,
John Bezmalinovic and Joe Burghardt,
spurred Stanford to a three game victory,
15-12, 15-8, 17-15. Both hit above .700
and they combined for 17 kills and 14
blocks.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 2 in the
country behind UCLA, continues to
exploit its depth advantage this season.
"We have 10 stand-out players," Nieves
said, "and I just think the best thing to do
is to put the players on the court who have
done the job in that week of practice."
