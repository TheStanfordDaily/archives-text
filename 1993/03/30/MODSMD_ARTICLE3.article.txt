## Books leaving Green in preparation for construction project 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Starting in April, close to a mil
lion books and government docu
ments will be shuffled within and
from Green Library to make room
for a $20 million construction pro
ject in the west wing.
Hit hard by the 1989 Loma Pri
eta Earthquake, Green's west
wing, which was built in 1918 and
faces the east side of the Quad, will
be "brought toward current build
ing codes" in the repair, according
to manager of Libraries Building
Projects Philip Leighton. The
structure's aging clay tile walls
desperately need to be fixed, he
said.
The wing's seven floors hold
part of the general collection as
well as government documents
and rare books.
Chief of Access Services Joan
Krasner said that neither the
move nor the subsequent con
struction, which should last 30
months, will disturb student
study areas. The books will be
moved in the first few weeks of the
quarter "when use of the library is
less than at the middle or the end,"
Krasner added.
In the project's first phase,
most books located in the west

stack's general collection, on the
sixth and seventh floors, will be
transferred to the Stanford Auxil
iary Library. More frequently
used collections will remain some
where on central campus, Krasner
said.
Then in June, the Jonsson Li
brary of Government Documents'
250,000 holdings will also be
transferred out of the west wing to
Green's south stack. Books cur
rently in south stack will be moved
to other parts of the library, Kras
ner said.
According to Leighton, the
timetable of the work on the west
wing is still up in the air.
"[lt] almost certainly will not
start in June because once the de
cision is made as to what approach
will be taken, the design will have
to be redone to meet current
[building] codes," Leighton added.
Leighton, who expects to have
"a sense of clear direction" for the
project within two months, said
that construction could com
mence during fall quarter at the
earliest.
The possibility of the federal
government partially funding the
repairs is one of the reasons for the
delay. "We're cautiously hopeful

that a large fraction of the cost
will come from [the Federal

cy]," Leighton said. "That's
part of the reason this project is
up in the air."
Leighton said that he hadn't
heard of FEMA money going to
any other earthquake repair
projects at Stanford. He added
that the University will proba
bly start construction even if
federal help remains unclear.
