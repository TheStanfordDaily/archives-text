Still no suspects in carjacking
Police still have no suspects in an attempted
carjacking that ended with the shooting of a a 42-
year-old Oakland man outside Stanford Hospital.
Palo Alto Police issued bulletins regarding the
March 2 shooting to Bay Area law enforcement
agencies, but there have been no suspects, no
arrests and no new bits of information about the
case, said Sgt. Brad Zook.
Almost a month ago, the victim was threatened
by a black male who demanded he relinquish his
car keys and wallet. When Stephen White refused
and started to drive away, the assailant shot him
in the chest with a semiautomatic handgun.
The gunman and his female accomplice fled
after the incident.
A sketch of the male assailant as well as a
description of the vehicle driven has been com
piled, but this information has not led police to
the culprits.

"We've had a reasonable amount of leads,"
Zook said. "The case is not dead by any means."

Prof. Abel goes to Washington
Communication Prof. Elie Abel has been
appointed the new director of Stanford in Wash
ington, replacing Political Science Prof. David
Danelski this autumn.
An experienced reporter, broadcaster and
author of several books on U.S. foreign policy and
the news media, Abel first came to Stanford in
1979.
"He knows D.C. well, and he is very oriented
toward undergraduates, which is important since
this is an undergraduate program. I have every
hope that he will do a good job," Danelski said.
Danelski, who has been the head of the pro
gram since its founding, is retiring in June.
