# No mandatory retake of geophysics exam

The Geophysics Department said yester
day that a plan to make all Geophysics 4
students retake their final exam because
some allegedly cheated would be unfair,
and instead announced two other options
for students.
Students can now choose to take their
mid-term exam grade as their final grade,
accept a "pass" for the class or retake the
final on Saturday if they want a higher let
ter grade, said department chairman Mark
Zoback.
Zoback said that upon reconsideration
the department realized that providing op
tions was the best thing to do for the major
ity of the students in the class.
"It is clear that many students did not
cheat and making everybody retake the
final would be very inflexible on our part,"
he said.
Grades have been withheld for the class,

"Natural Hazards and Man," and letters
were sent out last week informing the 173
students that they would have to retake the
final this weekend.
But after discussions with students and
administrators, Zoback said he realized it
would not be fair to force all students to
take the final again.
Students came forward last quarter to
tell instructors that one or more of the 1$
class members who took the exam early
shared information about material before
the regularly scheduled final.
Freshman Keith Eischeid said he is
pleased with the change, adding that he
was upset to hear he would have to retake
the final after he faithfully signed the
honor code. Giving students options is a
good compromise, Eischeid added.
The decision to present the students
with choices was made collectively by
