# No mandatory retake of geophysics exam
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
The Geophysics Department said yester
day that a plan to make all Geophysics 4
students retake their final exam because
some allegedly cheated would be unfair,
and instead announced two other options
for students.
Students can now choose to take their
mid-term exam grade as their final grade,
accept a "pass" for the class or retake the
final on Saturday if they want a higher let
ter grade, said department chairman Mark
Zoback.
Zoback said that upon reconsideration
the department realized that providing op
tions was the best thing to do for the major
ity of the students in the class.
"It is clear that many students did not
cheat and making everybody retake the
final would be very inflexible on our part,"
he said.
Grades have been withheld for the class,

"Natural Hazards and Man," and letters
were sent out last week informing the 173
students that they would have to retake the
final this weekend.
But after discussions with students and
administrators, Zoback said he realized it
would not be fair to force all students to
take the final again.
Students came forward last quarter to
tell instructors that one or more of the 1$
class members who took the exam early
shared information about material before
the regularly scheduled final.
Freshman Keith Eischeid said he is
pleased with the change, adding that he
was upset to hear he would have to retake
the final after he faithfully signed the
honor code. Giving students options is a
good compromise, Eischeid added.
The decision to present the students
with choices was made collectively by
Zoback, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole

The decision to present the students
with choices was made collectively by
Zoback, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
and Geology Prof. Gail Mahood,
chair of the Committee of Academ
ic Appraisal and Achievement.
After hearing complaints from
a number of students and talking
with officials involved, they real
ized that the original decision was
"too stiff," according to Zoback.
Zoback said that the depart
ment is "not at all forgetting that
Ithe cheating! happened."
He added that they are still try
ing to find out who is responsible
for the infraction "and then deal
with them through the system."

Junior Todd Rainwater, who
talked with Zoback, said he
favored the department's decision
to give people a grade while it is
investigating the allegations.
Since many students are gradu
ating and looking for jobs, Rainwa
ter said he believes it is better for
everyone to have a grade now —
even those accused of cheating —
rather than everyone having an
asterisk on their transcript.
It was clear the majority of stu
dents did not cheat, Zoback added.
However, since it is still uncertain
who cheated, and to what extent,
there was "no fair basis to give
grades based on the final."
According to Cole, dealing with
the academic aspect of this event

— assigning grades with an unfair
exam — is only one part of dealing
with problem.
Judicial Affairs will proceed
with the other aspect of the allega
tions— trying to identify "those
who gave and received unpermit
ted aid," Cole said.
Zoback said that all Geophysics
4 students need to see Prof. Robert
Kovach this week to decide which
option they will choose.
Students in the Cultures, Ideas
and Values class Philosophy 5B
have also had their final grades
withheld as charges of cheating on
the final are investigated. Howev
er, future action is pending any
forthcoming information about
who may have cheated.
