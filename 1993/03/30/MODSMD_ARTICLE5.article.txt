# 'Unofficial' punishment
## Alpha Sig house placed on social probation after investigation of hazing allegations 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
An unofficial list of sanctions — includ
ing social probation this quarter — has
been levied against the Alpha Sigma house
in connection with allegations of hazing
last fall, house president Stewart Richard
son disclosed yesterday.
Richardson said the set of punitive mea
sures was agreed upon by Alpha Sig officers
and Assoc. Director of Residential Educa
tion Diana Conklin, who headed the inves

The proposed sanctions have not yet
been formally handed down by the Office of
Residential Education. Residences on so
cial probation are often banned from host

the house.
Under the decision, the house could be
required to participate in community ser
vice, conduct an educational workshop on
the dangers of alcohol abuse, offer more ex
tensive training for house officers and hold
house meetings regularly, Richardson said.
The final punishment will likely incorpo
rate some or all of these requirements.
In addition, he said the house would be
asked to draft a statement that makes "the
social nature of the house clear to new res

idents" and "quantifies the uniqueness of
the house."
"None of this has been set in stone," he
said. "But that was [Conklin's] expectation
of what the punishment would be."
Conklin did not return messages left at
her office yesterday.
Alpha Sig is an unofficial, self-operative,
co-ed fraternity located in Co well Cluster.
In January, the Office of Student Activities
completed an investigation into allegations
that incoming residents were hazed by
housemates in October.
Sources told The Daily that the investi
gation included an examination of charges
that new members of the fraternity were
called "shitties" and were questioned by re
turning residents about their alcohol con
sumption.
In February, Alpha Sig resident Jay
Mason wrote in a letter to The Daily that
the fraternity's initiation goals were "not
on building community and bonding, as it
claims to be, but on trying to pull in new
members to a kind of drinking and drug
'subculture.' "
Richardson said one condition of the
proposed sanctions is that future initia
tions be conducted so that "the effects are
