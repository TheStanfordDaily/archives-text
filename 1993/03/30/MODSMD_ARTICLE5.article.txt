# 'Unofficial' punishment
## Alpha Sig house placed on social probation after investigation of hazing allegations 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
An unofficial list of sanctions — includ
ing social probation this quarter — has
been levied against the Alpha Sigma house
in connection with allegations of hazing
last fall, house president Stewart Richard
son disclosed yesterday.
Richardson said the set of punitive mea
sures was agreed upon by Alpha Sig officers
and Assoc. Director of Residential Educa
tion Diana Conklin, who headed the inves
tigation of the charges.
The proposed sanctions have not yet
been formally handed down by the Office of
Residential Education. Residences on so
cial probation are often banned from host
ing parties open to students not living in
the house.
Under the decision, the house could be
required to participate in community ser
vice, conduct an educational workshop on
the dangers of alcohol abuse, offer more ex
tensive training for house officers and hold
house meetings regularly, Richardson said.
The final punishment will likely incorpo
rate some or all of these requirements.
In addition, he said the house would be
asked to draft a statement that makes "the
social nature of the house clear to new res

idents" and "quantifies the uniqueness of
the house."
"None of this has been set in stone," he
said. "But that was [Conklin's] expectation
of what the punishment would be."
Conklin did not return messages left at
her office yesterday.
Alpha Sig is an unofficial, self-operative,
co-ed fraternity located in Co well Cluster.
In January, the Office of Student Activities
completed an investigation into allegations
that incoming residents were hazed by
housemates in October.
Sources told The Daily that the investi
gation included an examination of charges
that new members of the fraternity were
called "shitties" and were questioned by re
turning residents about their alcohol con
sumption.
In February, Alpha Sig resident Jay
Mason wrote in a letter to The Daily that
the fraternity's initiation goals were "not
on building community and bonding, as it
claims to be, but on trying to pull in new
members to a kind of drinking and drug
'subculture.' "

Richardson said one condition of the
proposed sanctions is that future initia
tions be conducted so that "the effects are
the same as the goals."
"The goal of initiation is to
make new people feel welcome and
to build community," he said. "We
will make it very clear that new
residents do not have to participate
in initiation, and any encourage
ment to do so will only be because
others enjoyed it."
Mason said last night that —
though he was not completely
aware of all of the proposed mea
sures against the house — he felt
"pretty good about what they're

doing. I think the administration is
addressing what they should be
addressing."
Richardson said issues of alco
hol and drug use in the house out
side of initiation were also dis
cussed with Res Ed officials.
Despite objecting to some of the
investigation's initial conclusions,
Richardson expressed general sat
isfaction with the measures hand
ed down by Res Ed.
"I personally tend to question
the justifications for the punish
ment, but I do think some produc
tive things will come out of this
list," he said. "If this is the final
decision, I'm happy with it.
He added that the "underlying

social nature" of Alpha Sig would
not be subverted by the sanctions.
"Personally, I think the character
of Alpha Sig as a very social, non
judgmental house won't change
— this just ensures that people
don't feel alienated by living
there."
Alpha Sig residents were noti
fied of the tentative ruling last
night at a house meeting, but few
were willing to offer opinions on
the measures.
"It's not my place to judge
whether it's fair or not," said
