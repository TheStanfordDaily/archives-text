# Stables bring animal aura to the Farm
## Stanford Equestrian Center provides a home to chickens, dogs—and horses 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
During the noontime calm,
only an occasional human wan
ders through the Stanford
Equestrian Center. But the sta
bles are hardly quiet and peace
ful.
The breathing and snorting
of restless horses in their stalls
remind the passerby that even
when people are absent, the sta
bles teem with life.
One horse neighs and kicks
his stall door, as others join him
in response. The resident pi
geons, fat and noisy, flutter
about in search of spilled grain.
Outside, dogs, chickens and
rabbits share the stableyard
with the horses in their pad
docks.
It gives new meaning to the
age-old Stanford nickname,
"The Farm."
Sure enough, the Red Barn,
tucked away on west campus
between Sterling Quad and the
Stanford Golf Course displays
its historic roots with a life-size
statue of Leland Stanford's
prized steed, Electioneer.
But nowadays, the equestri
an center is more a mini-com
munity of humans and animals
than a historic landmark. The

central site for riding lessons,
the Stanford Equestrian Team
and boarding for local horse
owners, more activity abounds
in this hidden corner of campus
than most students realize.
In the afternoons, Stanford
students arrive, backpacks in
one arm, riding boots in the
other, to take riding lessons of
fered for a fee through the Ath
letics Department. For many,
these lessons are a welcome
break from the daily grind of
academics, and the barn is a re
freshing contrast to classrooms
and libraries.
"Here, I'm much more re
laxed," says Manuela Ferro, a
fourth-year Ph.D. student.
"It's a complete stress release."
Having taken lessons last
year, Ferro is an advanced be
ginning riding student who has
just reached a milestone — at
the end of last quarter, she
jumped some low fences on
horseback for the first time.
"You have to really concen
trate on what you're doing in
order not to fall off," Ferro
says, explaining that riding
forces her to temporarily forget
about her studies. "You have to
get your mind off everything

Local resident Elizabeth Ball rides Picarro yesterday afternoon at
the Stanford Equestrian Center. Like each horse in the barn, Pi
carro has his own unique personality that challenges and enter
tains riders.
