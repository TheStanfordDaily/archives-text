# Stables bring animal aura to the Farm
## Stanford Equestrian Center provides a home to chickens, dogs—and horses

Local resident Elizabeth Ball rides Picarro yesterday afternoon at
the Stanford Equestrian Center. Like each horse in the barn, Pi
carro has his own unique personality that challenges and enter
tains riders.
else."
The driving force behind the
riding program is instructor
Cheryl Maloney, a familiar face
and personality to the stable
community.
Working 13-hour days, six
days a week, Maloney is a classic
type-A personality who never
seems to stop — except to smoke
a cigarette between lessons.
Students describe her teach
ing style as personable, yet chal
lenging. She grounds her stu
dents in a solid foundation of the
basics, emphasizing proper bal
ance through a variety of drills,
before introducing them to more
advanced skills, such as jump
ing.
Standing in the middle of the
riding arena, or perched on the
fence, Maloney is highly atten
tive to, and sometimes stern
with, her students. "Balance
your weight in your lower legs;
keep contact with the horse's
mouth through the reins," she
calls out to the students circling
the arena.
But overall, the lessons are
marked by humor and light con
versation between Maloney and
her students. "You look as if
you're riding a motorcycle!" she
good-naturedly says to a student,
describing her arm positioning.
"It's not all you, he's being an
idiot today," she later yells, con
soling another student who is
riding a misbehaving horse.
Maloney, who started teach
ing this school year, says she

thinks the job suits her well
because she "eryoys the horses
(and) enjoys the students."
Assisted by working students
— Stanford students who work
morning or afternoon shifts at
the stables in exchange for riding
lessons — Maloney is responsible
not only for teaching both Stan
ford students and local commu
nity members, but also for the
feeding, grooming, health and
exercise of the approximately 20
horses that the Stanford pro
gram owns.
Later each afternoon, eques
trian team members show up for
practice. Freshman Robin Lesley
explains that the club sport is
separated into two divisions. The
more advanced team members
use the five to 10 horses owned
by the team and compete in
jumping and flatwork (riding
without jumping), while others
use the lesson program's horses
and compete only in flatwork.
Lesley, who competes only in
flatwork but is taking jumping
lessons, says the team competes
against California schools such
as UC-Davis, USC and Fresno
State in two or three shows each
quarter to accumulate points.
High-scoring teams advance to
regional and national competi
tion. This year, Stanford and
rival Fresno State are vying for
the number-one spot in their
region.
Shows are difficult to practice
for because competitors are ran
domly assigned to horses to ride
by drawing out of a hat, Lesley
explains. "You end up riding
horses you've never ridden
before," she said, making riding
more difficult because each horse

has a distinct personality and
responds differently to riders.
Ultimately, it is the horses
themselves and their personali
ties that keep riding students,
instructors and team members
dedicated to the sport.
Riding requires more that just
the physical skills, they say.
Understanding each horse's
characteristics and idiosyn
crasies is crucial. Compatible
personalities between rider and
horse are important to a success
ful learning process, Maloney
points out.
And students know well the
unique personalities of the
equine members of the stable
community:
"Scout," a dead ringer for
Tonto's spotted steed in"The
Lone Ranger," is energetic, but
slightly neurotic. "Charlie," is a
sturdy, smooth-going favorite
among beginning riders. And few
who ride "Jackie," who looks like
an overgrown sheepdog, can for
get her cranky, spoiled-brat
antics.
The riders talk about the
horses as if they were discussing
humans: "Jake is in a weird
mood today. He's being a spaz,";
"Jessie was so cheerful today,
she couldn't wait to get out and
have a lesson."
Clearly, the students are not
just participating in a sport —
they form relationships with the
horses as well.
Ferro describes perhaps the
greatest incentive to get involved
with the sport. "Sometimes, it's
just so much easier to deal with
horses for a change, instead of
grad students and professors,"
she says, laughing.

lenging. She grounds her stu
dents in a solid foundation of the
basics, emphasizing proper bal
ance through a variety of drills,
before introducing them to more
advanced skills, such as jump
ing.
Standing in the middle of the
riding arena, or perched on the
fence, Maloney is highly atten
tive to, and sometimes stern
with, her students. "Balance
your weight in your lower legs;
keep contact with the horse's
mouth through the reins," she
calls out to the students circling
the arena.
But overall, the lessons are
marked by humor and light con
versation between Maloney and
her students. "You look as if
you're riding a motorcycle!" she
good-naturedly says to a student,
describing her arm positioning.
"It's not all you, he's being an
idiot today," she later yells, con
soling another student who is
riding a misbehaving horse.
Maloney, who started teach
ing this school year, says she

thinks the job suits her well
because she "eryoys the horses
(and) enjoys the students."
Assisted by working students
— Stanford students who work
morning or afternoon shifts at
the stables in exchange for riding
lessons — Maloney is responsible
not only for teaching both Stan
ford students and local commu
nity members, but also for the
feeding, grooming, health and
exercise of the approximately 20
horses that the Stanford pro
gram owns.
Later each afternoon, eques
trian team members show up for
practice. Freshman Robin Lesley
explains that the club sport is
separated into two divisions. The
more advanced team members
use the five to 10 horses owned
by the team and compete in
jumping and flatwork (riding
without jumping), while others
use the lesson program's horses
and compete only in flatwork.
Lesley, who competes only in
flatwork but is taking jumping
lessons, says the team competes
against California schools such
as UC-Davis, USC and Fresno
State in two or three shows each
quarter to accumulate points.
High-scoring teams advance to
regional and national competi
tion. This year, Stanford and
rival Fresno State are vying for
the number-one spot in their
region.
Shows are difficult to practice
for because competitors are ran
domly assigned to horses to ride
by drawing out of a hat, Lesley
explains. "You end up riding
horses you've never ridden
before," she said, making riding
more difficult because each horse

has a distinct personality and
responds differently to riders.
Ultimately, it is the horses
themselves and their personali
ties that keep riding students,
instructors and team members
dedicated to the sport.
Riding requires more that just
the physical skills, they say.
Understanding each horse's
characteristics and idiosyn
crasies is crucial. Compatible
personalities between rider and
horse are important to a success
ful learning process, Maloney
points out.
And students know well the
unique personalities of the
equine members of the stable
community:
"Scout," a dead ringer for
Tonto's spotted steed in"The
Lone Ranger," is energetic, but
slightly neurotic. "Charlie," is a
sturdy, smooth-going favorite
among beginning riders. And few
who ride "Jackie," who looks like
an overgrown sheepdog, can for
get her cranky, spoiled-brat
antics.
The riders talk about the
horses as if they were discussing
humans: "Jake is in a weird
mood today. He's being a spaz,";
"Jessie was so cheerful today,
she couldn't wait to get out and
have a lesson."
Clearly, the students are not
just participating in a sport —
they form relationships with the
horses as well.
Ferro describes perhaps the
greatest incentive to get involved
with the sport. "Sometimes, it's
just so much easier to deal with
horses for a change, instead of
grad students and professors,"
she says, laughing.
During the noontime calm,
only an occasional human wan
ders through the Stanford
Equestrian Center. But the sta
bles are hardly quiet and peace
ful.
The breathing and snorting
of restless horses in their stalls
remind the passerby that even
when people are absent, the sta
bles teem with life.
One horse neighs and kicks
his stall door, as others join him
in response. The resident pi
geons, fat and noisy, flutter
about in search of spilled grain.
Outside, dogs, chickens and
rabbits share the stableyard
with the horses in their pad
docks.
It gives new meaning to the
age-old Stanford nickname,
"The Farm."
Sure enough, the Red Barn,
tucked away on west campus
between Sterling Quad and the
Stanford Golf Course displays
its historic roots with a life-size
statue of Leland Stanford's
prized steed, Electioneer.
But nowadays, the equestri
an center is more a mini-com
munity of humans and animals
than a historic landmark. The

central site for riding lessons,
the Stanford Equestrian Team
and boarding for local horse
owners, more activity abounds
in this hidden corner of campus
than most students realize.
In the afternoons, Stanford
students arrive, backpacks in
one arm, riding boots in the
other, to take riding lessons of
fered for a fee through the Ath
letics Department. For many,
these lessons are a welcome
break from the daily grind of
academics, and the barn is a re
freshing contrast to classrooms
and libraries.
"Here, I'm much more re
laxed," says Manuela Ferro, a
fourth-year Ph.D. student.
"It's a complete stress release."
Having taken lessons last
year, Ferro is an advanced be
ginning riding student who has
just reached a milestone — at
the end of last quarter, she
jumped some low fences on
horseback for the first time.
"You have to really concen
trate on what you're doing in
order not to fall off," Ferro
says, explaining that riding
forces her to temporarily forget
about her studies. "You have to
get your mind off everything

The driving force behind the
riding program is instructor
Cheryl Maloney, a familiar face
and personality to the stable
community.
Working 13-hour days, six
days a week, Maloney is a classic
type-A personality who never
seems to stop — except to smoke
a cigarette between lessons.
