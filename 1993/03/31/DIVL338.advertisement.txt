Federal Credit Union I
If you received a bank or dealership new car loan within
the last two years and you don't like the interest rate
you're paying, we might be able to help you.
Whether you are looking to buy a New Vehicle or have
recently bought one, Stanford Federal Credit Union can
save you some money. Our current interest rates on New
Vehicle Loans are the lowest in our Credit Union's
history.
If you have a 1992 or 1993 car, van, or truck, and have
fewer than 24,000 miles on your odometer, we'll
refinance your vehicle as if it were new (on approved
credit and inspection of the vehicle).
April 1993 Interest Rates for New Vehicle Loans:
8.00% Fixed or 7.50% Variable, 36 months
8.25% Fixed or 7.75% Variable, 37 to 60 months
Borrowers who select the automatic transfer method to
repay their loans receive an additional 1/2% off these
rates.
