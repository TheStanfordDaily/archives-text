# Three-peat cheat?
## 'Mystery student' takes molecular biology final early, Honor Code violations suspected; early exam practice may be reconsidered

A false name. A fictitious student identifica
tion number. A third case of cheating.
This additional incident of potential Honor
Code violations — which occurred in the Molec
ular Biology 119 exam— will most likely lead to
a re-examination of the practice of giving early
final exams, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said yesterday.

According to Biology Prof. Robert Schimke,
eight of the 110 students in his molecular biolo
gy class took the final on the evening of Monday,
March 15 instead of its regularly scheduled time
Friday, March 19.
After the Monday night final it was discov
ered that one of the names was not on the class
list. It was later realized that the person also
gave a false student identification number, ac
cording to Schimke.
Schimke said the teaching assistant saw one

student "wandering the halls a couple of times,"
making officials wonder if copies of the test were
made.
At the regularly scheduled final, Schimke
spoke about possible improprieties and asked
any students with knowledge to come forward.
However, no one indicated they had any infor
mation about receiving copies of the exam.
Since it is not known who took the exam early
