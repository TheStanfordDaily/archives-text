# Three-peat cheat?
## 'Mystery student' takes molecular biology final early, Honor Code violations suspected; early exam practice may be reconsidered 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
A false name. A fictitious student identifica
tion number. A third case of cheating.
This additional incident of potential Honor
Code violations — which occurred in the Molec
ular Biology 119 exam— will most likely lead to
a re-examination of the practice of giving early
final exams, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said yesterday.

According to Biology Prof. Robert Schimke,
eight of the 110 students in his molecular biolo
gy class took the final on the evening of Monday,
March 15 instead of its regularly scheduled time
Friday, March 19.
After the Monday night final it was discov
ered that one of the names was not on the class
list. It was later realized that the person also
gave a false student identification number, ac
cording to Schimke.
Schimke said the teaching assistant saw one

student "wandering the halls a couple of times,"
making officials wonder if copies of the test were
made.
At the regularly scheduled final, Schimke
spoke about possible improprieties and asked
any students with knowledge to come forward.
However, no one indicated they had any infor
mation about receiving copies of the exam.
Since it is not known who took the exam early
or to what extent they could have
cheated, Schimke said he decided
to give the original final.
This is the third alleged inci
dent of cheating on final exams
last quarter. Investigations are
currently attempting to identify
students who took early exams
and allegedly passed out copies of
the test in Geophysics 4 and the
Cultures, Ideas and Values class
Philosophy 58.
These three cases have prompt
ed Cole to look into the Universi
ty's practice of giving early finals.
Cole said that a group com
prised of members of the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement and the Student
Conduct Legislative Council as
well as other University officials
will have to be conVtened to look
into the practice.
"We need to do something
regarding early exams to discour
age their abuse. Up until now the
faculty has trusted students, and
accommodates early requests.
Now we may be too accommodat
ing and students are taking advan
tage of the practice," Cole said.
While taking such steps as
requiring "different but equal"
early exams would put a burden
on the faculty, it may be what is
needed to curb abuse of this stu
dent-faculty privilege, Cole said.
Schimke said that it would be
very difficult to create two differ
ent but equally difficult exams
since many of his finals use long
problem-solving questions that
take up to two weeks to prepare.
According to Cole, other possi
ble changes may include having
the SCLC draft an addition to the
Honor Code regarding early
exams or asking the C-AAA to cre
ate guidelines that deal with how
faculty should respond after it has
been determined that cheating
occurred.

Current guidelines are
"prospective — they deal with how
to avoid cheating," Cole said.
There are no policies that guide
instructors in how to deal with
grades of an entire class after an
alleged cheating incident, she
added.
This fact has become obvious as
instructors in the Geophysics and
Philosophy Departments have
dealt with the situation different
ly. Instructors in the geophysics
class gave students three options
to receive their final grade, while
final grades are still being with
held in the philosophy class pend
ing forthcoming information.
No steps were taken to with
hold final grades in the molecular
biology class because there was "a
normal distribution of grades and
nothing unusual to indicate any
thing suspicious," Schimke said.
The department has waited to
investigate the incident because
the TA who administered the
early exam has been out of town.
Upon the TA's return, Schimke
said that finding the identity of
the alleged cheater will come down
to "an issue of mugshots."
Cole said that her office will
wait to receive more information
from the TA or other students in
the class before it continues with
the investigation.
While no information support
ing the allegations has arisen,
Schimke says he has no reason to
think that this situation was any
thing other than an instance of
cheating.
"Why else would someone
spend an evening during finals
week taking a final?" he added.
While Schimke said he hopes to
figure out what happened, it is
not something he is going to dwell
on.
"We anticipate our students
are here to learn and not to cheat,
and it is only to their disadvantage
to do this," Schimke said. "Here it
is time to start acting like adults
and not children and the Honor
Code is a part of this."
