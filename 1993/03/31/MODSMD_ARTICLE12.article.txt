Two Israeli officers killed
HADERA, Israel (AP) — Gunmen shot
to death two Israeli traffic police sitting in
a squad car yesterday, and the government
struck back by barring the West Bank's 1
million Palestinians from entering Israel.
Police blamed militant Arabs for the
pre-dawn slayings.
The assassinations at an intersection
near this town in Israel's heartland esca
lated a wave of Arab attacks that has
claimed 13 Israeli lives in March. Twenty
six Palestinians also have been killed this
month.
"We are indeed going through a difficult
period of escalating Palestinian terror
ism," said Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Rabin announced he had ordered the
army reinforced in the occupied territories.
Palestinians said the tough measure of
sealing the occupied territories and bar
ring 120,000 Palestinians from their jobs

in Israel would damage peace prospects.
Medicine may halt cancer
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Scientists have
developed the first medicines intended to
stop malignancy by disarming a rogue
cancer gene, an approach that could help
control many forms of tumors.
The new treatment is intended to
block a cancer-causing gene — a so-called
oncogene — that appears to play a role in
cancer of the breast and pancreas.
Although the ultimate cause of cancer
is often a mystery, scientists have
learned in recent years that mutations in
several genes are critical steps on the
path to malignancy. When these normal
genes go bad, cells lose control over their
growth, and cancer results.
The latest approach is intended to
short-circuit this process by attacking an
oncogene known as a neu.
