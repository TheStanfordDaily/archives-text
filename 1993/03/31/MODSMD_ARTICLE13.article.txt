# House and Senate agree to cut deficit
## Fundamental element of Clinton's economic plan OK'd 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House and
Senate negotiators agreed late last
night to a compromise five-year plan
for cutting the deficit by just under
$500 billion, a measure that would
lay the foundation for enactment of
President Clinton's economic pro
gram.
Congressional sources said the
agreement would be announced today
and would be followed quickly by
House and Senate votes.
Few details of the compromise were
immediately available. The plans were
similar to begin with since both were
based on Clinton's proposals: tax
increases on the rich, defense cuts and
other savings, along with increased
spending on certain domestic pro
grams, including highways and federal
research.
Democrats hoped to pass the legisla
tion in the House as early as today, and
the Senate the next day. It would be the

earliest a deficit-reduction plan was
approved since the budget law was
enacted in 1974.
In reaching a compromise, the Sen
ate agreed to lower its total tax increase
by roughly $22 billion to about $273
billion over five years. The House,
meantime, backed away from the tough
limits it sought on cost-of-living
increases for federal workers and
retirees, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
Like the House-passed version, the
compromise package would also hold
spending on defense and most domestic
programs over the next five years to no
more than the $548 billion the govern
ment will spend this year. Excluded
from this freeze would be benefit pro
grams like Social Security and Medi
care.
The outline of the savings package
was included in a $1.5 trillion budget
for fiscal 1994, which starts on Oct. 1.

The measure, which does not require
the president's signature, sets goals for
tax and spending bills lawmakers will
consider later this year.
The agreement came as Democrats
erased an embarrassing setback the
Senate had dealt to Clinton's jobs bill,
another important piece of the presi
dent's recovery economic program. The
$16.3 billion measure would provide
money for mass transit, summer job
and other employment-heavy pro
grams.
In a 52-48 vote, the Senate reversed
itself and killed a Republican amend
ment trimming $104 million from the
bill. Lawmakers had given the GOP
provision preliminary approval on a 48-
44 vote the night before.
The tally showed that the chamber's
majority Democrats will probably be
able to keep enough of their 57 mem
bers together to muscle the jobs mea
sure through the Senate largely intact.
