## Safety on ten speeds 
### 
Police officers should try
decreasing campus theft
by patrolling on bicycles

IT'S SPRING. TIME FOR every
one to get out and get some sun
— even Stanford's cops.
In light of last year's significant
increase in bicycle thefts and bur
glaries, the Department of Public
Safety should follow the lead of
other area schools and consider the
implementation of a police bicycle
patrol.
Last year, bicycle thefts on cam
pus shot up 15 percent, from 588 in
1991 to 682, and vehicle burglaries
rose 109 percent, from 141 inci
dents in 1991 to 295 in 1992.
To stem the rising tide of bicycle
thefts as well as those all-too-com
mon accidents, the police should
consider the possibility of having
one or two officers patrol the cam
pus on bikes.
Bicycle-riding officers would
enable the department to better
patrol the nearly one square mile of
campus that is closed to cars. Silent
and almost indistinguishable to
criminals, the officers would have a
greater chance of catching bicycle
and car thiefs in the act. In addi
tion, these officers would have both
an increased ability to keep watch
on the inner campus and a greater
visibility in the community.
Bicycle patrol officers would also
be able to respond to campus emer
gencies within the University's
vehicle-exclusion zone faster than
the traditional vehicle-driving offi
cer.
According to an officer at San
Francisco State University's cam
pus police department, bicycle
patrols are "ideal on campus."
At UC-Berkeley, which has five
officers patrolling on bicycles, bike
thefts have seen a marked decrease
in the last two years. After institut
ing a bike patrol program in 1990,
thefts declined from 585 that year
to 516 in 1991 and 485 in 1992.

While officers at Berkeley are
quick to point out the bike-patrol
program is not the sole reason
behind the drop in thefts, they say
the presence of uniformed officers
patrolling bicycle parking areas
and car parking lots has had a sig
nificant effect in bringing down
crime.
Other local schools, such as San
Jose State and UC-Davis, also have
bike patrol programs. At Davis, for
example, two officers are full-time
bicycle patrolmen. Not only do they
keep a watchful eye for thefts, but
the officers also enforce bicycle laws
and educate riders on safety and
theft issues.
Officers on bicycles could also be
a valuable tool for improving the
Stanford Police's relationship with
students. These officers are easily
approachable and a few regular
bike-riding officers, like those in
Davis, could cultivate relationships
with students across campus.
Admittedly the Stanford Police
— funded jointly by the University
and Santa Clara County — are fac
ing the pinch of budget cuts like
other academic departments and
governmental agencies.
Though such a program would
be difficult to implement during the
evening and night hours, when only
two or three officers are out on
patrol, the department should con
sider the possibility of having an
officer ride during the day.
If the department cannot spare
an officer, it should at least have
one of the Cushman-riding commu
nity service officers hop on a bike.
In fact, bikes a move a lot faster
than those antiquated three-wheel
ers.
The cost of mountain bikes and
accessories could be defrayed with
donations from local bicycle shops.
A number of local departments that
have bike patrols have received
their bikes as gifts from area mer
chants.
Though cops on bikes aren't a
panacea for Stanford's rapidly ris
ing crime rate, any solution that
could reduce thefts and improve the
department's public relations
deserves to be tried.
