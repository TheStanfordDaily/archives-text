						techie gone fuzzy, post B.S. 
### 
LOOK AT THAT MUGSHOT over to
the right. Look at that uncharacter
istically capless combed hair and
shaven face. Look at that slightly tilted
head and crooked smile.
It's the look of a Bachelor of the Sci
ences.
Yessiree, I'm done. Finished. Well,
with the exception of that one darn
incomplete. (I swear I'm working on it,
Prof. Sag). That means accomplishment.
That means responsibility. That means
no more techie classes for the rest of my
life.
But as for that fuzzy stuff, I'm just
getting started.
Yep. I am now officially a grad student
— a co-term in communications. I feel
this compulsion to go out and buy a bike
helmet and those little straps which keep
your pants from getting caught in the
chain. I wanna get a briefcase and move
to Escondido Village. I'm gonna start sit
ting at that elevated table at the CoHo
and stare at people patronizingly. And I
love it.
I'm going to achieve mastery over the
arts. Before long, I'll be able to put a
bunch of letters after my name. I'll have
more degrees than a thermometer.
But why? Why am I delaying reality
one more year? A degree in symbolic sys
tems will get me a plenty good job, espe
cially in Silicon Valley. Why go after this
co-term in a completely unrelated field?

Let's just say that I came to my sens
es. And none too soon.
I was starting to pay too much atten
tion to the hype. I had mindlessly adopt
ed as my own the Stanford version of suc
cess. Get a degree in a marketable skill
and get a high-paying and powerful job.
You'll be successful. Really.
The people that spout this stuff are
the ones who see college as the last
chance to enjoy yourself before heading
into a professional life of boredom. But if
I hear one more person tell me that col
lege will be "the best years of your life," I
think I'm going to take a sharp object and
end theirs.
Because that's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard. If college will be the
best years of my life, then what do I have
to look forward to? If the high point of my
entire earthly existence is dorm musicals,
waiting in lines to pay people money, Full
Moon on the Quad and checking my P.O.
box three times a day, then I think I'm
gonna go join up with that Koresh guy.
He seems to lead a pretty exciting life.
But we Stanford students have plenty
to look forward to. You can work for a
consulting firm (don't ask — I don't
know what they are either, but we're all
supposed to pretend we like them). If you
work about 80 hours a week, maybe
you'll get a promotion so you can work
even longer hours.
As long as we mindlessly pursue what

other people tell us is the right thing to
do, we will be unhappy. What do you
want to do? Go to law school? Go on a
mission? Act? Get married? Do it.
It doesn't matter how Stanfordish or
un-Stanfordish your dreams are, they're
all you've got. Don't let other people pick
them out for you. We are adults now, and
while we're not able to take an exam on our
own, we still might have the mental where
withal to decide what it is we like to do.
It took me a while, but I finally real
ized I should pursue what I enjoy. Don't)
get me wrong, I really liked my major.
I'm glad I did it. It was intellectually fas
cinating. It's a handy subject to fall back
on, and all that stuff. But it's not my
dream to sit in front of a computer for the
next 40 years of my life. My dream is to
get paid to go to a baseball game and
write about it.
I'm not there yet, and it won't be easy.
But dreams are worth a little work. Even
an extra year of school.
Mike Langford, Master of the Arts. I
like the sound of that.

Mike Lang ford is a co-term in journal
ism. He hopes against hope to someday to
be writing about Stanford in the men's
Final Four.
