Stanford's legal actions favor faculty accused of harassment

I HAVE A QUESTION. The Daily
(March 29) reported that a Medical
Center administrative assistant is
suing Stanford for inadequately
responding to an alleged incident of
sexual harassment. The same woman
is also suing a member of the Stanford
faculty. This is not the first time such
an accusation has surfaced at the Med
ical Center; some claim that an atmo
sphere of sexism and harassment per
vades the work environment in some
departments.
This brings me to my question. Why
is University Counsel Priscilla Wheel

er representing both Stanford and the
doctor accused of harassment? Stan
ford clearly has a legitimate interest in
defending itself against legal action,
and should be given the opportunity to
argue that it responded appropriately
to the situation.
But why is the University, which
claims to make an effort to articulate
a new and more effective policy con
demning sexual harassment, using its
resources (to which my fellow stu
dents and I contribute with our ever
increasing tuition payments) to take
a position that clearly undermines

the legitimacy of harassment com
plaints?
I would not argue that Stanford
should represent Mizpah Brown in her
suit against Professor Richard Sogg,
but defending Sogg sends a clear mes
sage to Stanford employees that the
University will not stand behind them
if they speak out about abuse at the
hands (so to speak) of powerful faculty
members. Rather, it will throw its
formidable resources and credibility
behind a defense of the accused
harasser.
I do not have sufficient information

to take a position on the legitimacy of
Brown's accusation myself, but I ques
tion Stanford's decision to take a pub
lic position that Brown's lawsuit
against Sogg has no merit. As long as
the University acts on the presump
tion that harassment accusations by
(usually less powerful, female) employ
ees are simply overreactions to the
"unintentional," it promotes an atmo
sphere where the important and very
real problem of sexual harassment
goes unaddressed.
