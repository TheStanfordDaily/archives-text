## To rush, or not to rush ? Life in the big top 
### 
I'M WEARING NAIL POLISH right
now. But I will not be spending my
evening in a circus tent.
In Cafe Montmarte with a handsome
foreigner, perhaps. In a sleeping bag
under the stars at the Dish, maybe. Even
possibly in the middle of Flo Mo field
chanting "radishes."
But I won't make an appearance at
Sorority Rush.
I have lots of friends in the Greek sys
tem. Some I met before their induction
into the Pantheon, some after. I like their
personalities. I like them. I even like their
nice orthodontia.
I like feta cheese, too. I swear.
However, as rush rolled around fresh
man year, I failed to make the jump from
self-doubting and perky to bold and beau
tiful, to join the upper crust of Stanford's
oh-so-cut-throat social scene.
It wasn't because of some bag-your
face, I-don't-want-to-be classified-by-my
stellar-wardrobe moral conviction.
I had a shoe repertoire to put Imelda
Marcos to shame.

I just wasn't ready to delve into the
whole supercharged world of high
fashion, personality marketing and
color coordination again. Two quarters
out of L.A., there was no turning back
for me.
The end of the innocence.
All of high school was spent matching
socks with shirts, shorts with hair thin
gies, nail polish with lipstick, and
boyfriends with days of the week. Shal
low? Survival. You say tomato, I say toe
may-tow.
I love L.A. Who doesn't?
All my best hair days spent repowder
ing my face in honors English classes.
Ten a.m. nutrition breaks, choking in
Aqua Net, trying to muscle my way
towards the mirror in the locker room to
check if my bangs were still full. Making
sure my hot pink bra straps were peeking
out of my cut-off tank tops.
Eat your heart out, Gidget.
Then came Stanford. If guys can see
you walking in your Disco Barbie under
oos every morning, going to wash the

drool off your face, what's the use?
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
And so, as I saw the fliers go up for
Rush, I had to choose. I went to the panel
discussions between the depledged and
the super-psyched. I tossed and turned at
night. I organized potential outfits. I
flipped coins.
Dilemmas, dilemmas.
Would I be buying friends? Paying for
a social life? Giving up my individuality
forever, in exchange for forest-green
sweatshirts with quilted letters?
Running around campus with my
friends, dressed like the characters on
"Jem."
Heather Chandler suddenly possessed
my birdlike frame, and I succumbed.
Would I be paying relatively small
amounts of cash for dates with men with
relatively big pectoral muscles? Giving up
anonymity (after being brutally left out
of the Frosh book) forever, in exchange
for popularity, the sacred nectar of the
gods?
Sounds good, i,no?

Fraternity men vs. life in Synergy. Fly
with the eagles, or eat grilled tofu off
chipped, mismatched plates for the rest
of my college career. Tough choices.
I was about to throw it all away. About
to damn myself to a life without pre-par
ties. Never would I go to a formal at Stan
ford. Never ride on a bus in a revealing
formal with three-inch heels.
Never would I see the inside of the Phi
Delt house.
I agonized.
It isn't like I didn't enjoy the sorority
thing. It had been my life at one time. I
like to meet lots of people. I like to social
ize at parties. I like to put on obviously
tight shirts and form-fitting jeans.
Wanna make something of it?
However much I tried to fake it, I
couldn't make myself hate the Greek sys
tem. The people in fraternities and soror
ities aren't exclusively elitist snobs, they
can even be, gasp, cool.
I've gone soft.
I perhaps might even kinda sorta say
that the whole stereotypical "they're fine

one-on-one but are annoying as a group"
is just an easy way to write the whole
thing off.
But the stereotypes are easy to play
on. Quick jokes. J Crew comments. I'm
guilty. But deep down, I have no malice,
no pure contempt for Pi Phis.
Deep down in my pitiful little heart,
two-sizes-too-small, I do not vomit at the
thought of sororities. I admit it.
In all my years posing as an airhead, I
possessed my own intricate little wicked
thoughts. I was still a 4.0 student, despite
the makeup. So I can't buy the whole
"ditz" thing here. They got in.
I decided to keep Athens out of my
travel plans, but those who went Greek
aren't inherently evil people who crush
puppies" heads under their Joan and
David shoes. I promise.
It is such a cold day in hell today.
