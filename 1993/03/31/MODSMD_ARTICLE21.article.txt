## Scientists find organic compounds on space dust Discovery adds insight into origins of life on Earth and may fuel speculation of life existing outside our solar system 
### Troy Parkins Editorial staff 
In a discovery that may
explain how life began on Earth,
scientists at Stanford and Wash
ington University have recorded
the first measurements of organ
ic molecules on interplanetary
dust particles.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
and Washington University
Prof. Robert Walker reported
finding organic molecules on
space dust at a recent planetary
science conference in Houston.
Some scientists speculate that
these dust particles fell to Earth
and may have "seeded" Earth
with life.
The organic molecules that
the scientists found are classified
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocar
bons (PAHs). These PAHs are
large molecules consisting of
numerous benzene rings fused
together. Benzene, which con
tains six carbon atoms, is a rela
tively simple organic molecule
found on Earth.
"(The PAHs) resemble stuff
you would find on charbroiled
steak that you burned on the
grill," Zare said.
They also found large
molecules such as coronene,
which has twenty-four carbon
atoms. These large hydrocarbons
contain one or more six-member
carbon rings fused with one or
more common sides between
them.
According to Zare, people are
excited about the prospect that
dust particles may have dumped
organic molecules on Earth,
essentially jump-starting life.
However, he warned that it is

"absolutely premature" to con
clude that the dust actually
started life on the planet.
The organic molecules trav
eled on little particles called
interplanetary dust less than
0.00039 of an inch wide or about
one-tenth the diameter of a
human hair. The dust is übiqui
tous in space but there is much
debate over where the dust origi
nates, according to Zare.
Some scientists believe the
dust comes from comets, others
think asteroids or even other
planets. A fraction of the dust is
interstellar, which means that it
comes from out of our solar sys
tem.
Simon Clemett, a graduate
student who works with Zare,
said that these dust particles
make up between 0.1 percent and
1 percent of the universe's mass.
He also said that the particles
have been raining down on Earth
for over four billion years, and
substantial amounts of organic
matter could have been deposited
here.
Although scientists are not
sure how life started, they have
numerous theories — including
one called the "organic soup
theory." This theory states that
life evolved out of a primordial
brew of all types of organic
molecules.
With Zare and Walker's dis
covery, supporters of this theory
can now say space dust delivered
a substantial amount of the com
plex organic materials to Earth.
According to Clemett, it is not
that farfetched to say there is life
on other planets. Life on other
planets may be evolving similarly
to the way it did on Earth.

If dust particles containing
organic molecules are raining
down on other planets, the
organic molecules may "jump
start" life there as well, he said.
Clemett said that scientists,
using infrared spectroscopy,
have proven that the particles in
large interstellar dust clouds are

similar to the ones raining down
on Earth.
Zare said that an important
part of the experiment was deter
mining whether the dust parti
cles were from Earth or if they
were really extraterrestrial.
The dust particles were col
lected in the stratosphere by
high-flying U-2 planes. Scientists
then took the samples to the
McDonnell Center for Space Sci
ences at Washington University
in St. Louis.
The Washington team
removed the samples from the
dust collectors and crushed them
between two quartz plates. The
samples were then run through
various tests, including infrared
spectroscopy, to determine if the
particles were extraterrestrial.
One of the tests measured the
ratio of the abundance of differ
ent isotopes of the same element.
Isotopes are different forms of an
element — usually differing by
the numbers of neutrons.
This test allowed researchers
to conclude that they had parti
cles that came from space, rather
than Earth. Once this was estab
lished, the samples were sent to
Stanford.
At Stanford, the samples were
placed in a vacuum chamber and
irradiated with a pulsed infrared
laser to evaporate the organic

molecules on the dust particles.
A second pulsed laser ionized
the organic molecules that con
tain certain aromatic rings. The
resulting ions were sorted by
mass and identified.
The precise techniques the sci
entists used for this research
enabled them to spot the organic
molecules. "I'm excited that one
has the analytical tools to be able
to find these results," Zare said.
According to Walker, the
results they found really are no
surprise, since scientists always
thought there might be carbon
on dust particles. But due to less
accurate measuring techniques
of the past, no one was able to
find organic material on
extraterrestrial particles.
Clemett pointed out that in
the past, the main stumbling
block was problems with contam
ination. He said that it was only
in the last three to four years
that scientists, using a vacuum
and lasers, were able to measure
a sample free of contamination.
For science fiction fans, Zare
and Walker's experiment may
seem too familiar to Michael
Crichton's book "The Androme
da Strain."
The book described an experi
ment where a satellite collected
samples from the outer atmo
sphere. The satellite brought

back a deadly strain of bacteria
— the Andromeda strain — that
killed people and mutated wildly.
According to Clemett, a sce
nario like this is virtually impos
sible because it is hard for any
virus or bacterium to form on
such a small particle. He added
that the organic molecules found
on the particles were not pro
duced by life forms.
Zare agreed that people
should not pay attention to
Andromeda strain comparisons,
but he does want Congress to pay
more attention to his research.
Zare said that support for
this research is minimal.
"NASA's first concern is to
shoot rockets into space; their
second concern is to put people
into space. Their last concern is
to find out more about science
and the Earth." He expects that
the experiment will cause a stir
in the scientific community, but
he does not know how it will
affect funding.
Zare said that the experiments
will continue. He said it's impor
tant to look for other classes of
molecules, classify the particles
and find out how the molecules
compare to minerals.
"This is like archeology," he
said. "You're digging something
up, and you don't know if you're
getting garbage or a jewel."

entists used for this research
enabled them to spot the organic
molecules. "I'm excited that one
has the analytical tools to be able
to find these results," Zare said.
According to Walker, the
results they found really are no
surprise, since scientists always
thought there might be carbon
on dust particles. But due to less
accurate measuring techniques
of the past, no one was able to
find organic material on
extraterrestrial particles.
Clemett pointed out that in
the past, the main stumbling
block was problems with contam
ination. He said that it was only
in the last three to four years
that scientists, using a vacuum
and lasers, were able to measure
a sample free of contamination.
For science fiction fans, Zare
and Walker's experiment may
seem too familiar to Michael
Crichton's book "The Androme
da Strain."
The book described an experi
ment where a satellite collected
samples from the outer atmo
sphere. The satellite brought

back a deadly strain of bacteria
— the Andromeda strain — that
killed people and mutated wildly.
According to Clemett, a sce
nario like this is virtually impos
sible because it is hard for any
virus or bacterium to form on
such a small particle. He added
that the organic molecules found
on the particles were not pro
duced by life forms.
Zare agreed that people
should not pay attention to
Andromeda strain comparisons,
but he does want Congress to pay
more attention to his research.
Zare said that support for
this research is minimal.
"NASA's first concern is to
shoot rockets into space; their
second concern is to put people
into space. Their last concern is
to find out more about science
and the Earth." He expects that
the experiment will cause a stir
in the scientific community, but
he does not know how it will
affect funding.
Zare said that the experiments
will continue. He said it's impor
tant to look for other classes of
molecules, classify the particles
and find out how the molecules
compare to minerals.
"This is like archeology," he
said. "You're digging something
up, and you don't know if you're
getting garbage or a jewel."

In a discovery that may
explain how life began on Earth,
scientists at Stanford and Wash
ington University have recorded
the first measurements of organ
ic molecules on interplanetary
dust particles.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
and Washington University
Prof. Robert Walker reported
finding organic molecules on
space dust at a recent planetary
science conference in Houston.
Some scientists speculate that
these dust particles fell to Earth
and may have "seeded" Earth
with life.
The organic molecules that
the scientists found are classified
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocar
bons (PAHs). These PAHs are
large molecules consisting of
numerous benzene rings fused
together. Benzene, which con
tains six carbon atoms, is a rela
tively simple organic molecule
found on Earth.
"(The PAHs) resemble stuff
you would find on charbroiled
steak that you burned on the
grill," Zare said.
They also found large
molecules such as coronene,
which has twenty-four carbon
atoms. These large hydrocarbons
contain one or more six-member
carbon rings fused with one or
more common sides between
them.
According to Zare, people are
excited about the prospect that
dust particles may have dumped
organic molecules on Earth,
essentially jump-starting life.
However, he warned that it is

"absolutely premature" to con
clude that the dust actually
started life on the planet.
The organic molecules trav
eled on little particles called
interplanetary dust less than
0.00039 of an inch wide or about
one-tenth the diameter of a
human hair. The dust is übiqui
tous in space but there is much
debate over where the dust origi
nates, according to Zare.
Some scientists believe the
dust comes from comets, others
think asteroids or even other
planets. A fraction of the dust is
interstellar, which means that it
comes from out of our solar sys
tem.
Simon Clemett, a graduate
student who works with Zare,
said that these dust particles
make up between 0.1 percent and
1 percent of the universe's mass.
He also said that the particles
have been raining down on Earth
for over four billion years, and
substantial amounts of organic
matter could have been deposited
here.
Although scientists are not
sure how life started, they have
numerous theories — including
one called the "organic soup
theory." This theory states that
life evolved out of a primordial
brew of all types of organic
molecules.
With Zare and Walker's dis
covery, supporters of this theory
can now say space dust delivered
a substantial amount of the com
plex organic materials to Earth.
According to Clemett, it is not
that farfetched to say there is life
on other planets. Life on other
planets may be evolving similarly
to the way it did on Earth.

If dust particles containing
organic molecules are raining
down on other planets, the
organic molecules may "jump
start" life there as well, he said.
Clemett said that scientists,
using infrared spectroscopy,
have proven that the particles in
large interstellar dust clouds are

similar to the ones raining down
on Earth.
Zare said that an important
part of the experiment was deter
mining whether the dust parti
cles were from Earth or if they
were really extraterrestrial.
The dust particles were col
lected in the stratosphere by
high-flying U-2 planes. Scientists
then took the samples to the
McDonnell Center for Space Sci
ences at Washington University
in St. Louis.
The Washington team
removed the samples from the
dust collectors and crushed them
between two quartz plates. The
samples were then run through
various tests, including infrared
spectroscopy, to determine if the
particles were extraterrestrial.
One of the tests measured the
ratio of the abundance of differ
ent isotopes of the same element.
Isotopes are different forms of an
element — usually differing by
the numbers of neutrons.
This test allowed researchers
to conclude that they had parti
cles that came from space, rather
than Earth. Once this was estab
lished, the samples were sent to
Stanford.
At Stanford, the samples were
placed in a vacuum chamber and
irradiated with a pulsed infrared
laser to evaporate the organic

molecules on the dust particles.
A second pulsed laser ionized
the organic molecules that con
tain certain aromatic rings. The
resulting ions were sorted by
mass and identified.
The precise techniques the sci
entists used for this research
enabled them to spot the organic
molecules. "I'm excited that one
has the analytical tools to be able
to find these results," Zare said.
According to Walker, the
results they found really are no
surprise, since scientists always
thought there might be carbon
on dust particles. But due to less
accurate measuring techniques
