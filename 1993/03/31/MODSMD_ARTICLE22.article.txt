# Students spend spring break learning about environment
## Hey Thoreau, it's nature time

While others spent spring break on tropical
beaches or just on the couch, 12 Stanford stu
dents spent their spring break in school — envi
ronmental school — crawling through thick
piles of redwood needles and cones, hugging
trees and playing in the

mud.
They became part of San
Mateo Outdoor Education,
where the redwood forest and
the coast are the classrooms.

native Spring Break trips

"Seashore" Marcoux, Grace
"Grasslands" Kong, Julie
"Jaguar" Kikuchi and nine
others worked with natural
ists at San Mateo County's
outdoor education program
in Jones Gulch near La

The week aims to spread
interest in environmental
education. All the students

'What a fun week! I got
to run around in the
woods and smell like
smoke. I got to share my
knowledge about shelter
building and wilderness
survival with little kids,
and I even got to take a
shower a few times.'

were interested in environmental issues and
spending time outdoors.
"It's totally worth it to spend spring break
here," said trip leader Jessie Levine, a sopho
more majoring in Human Biology.
In addition to being students of the environ
ment, the Stanford students became teachers of
fifth graders from San Mateo County. Among
other things, they lead camp songs and co
taught lessons on the trails.
Every week, 120 to 180 fifth-grade students
from public schools in San Mateo County hike
on trails with 13 naturalists to explore nature
using the five senses.
"What a fun week! I got to run around in the
woods and smell like smoke," said Jeff Beoresch,
a sophomore majoring in Values, Technology,
Science and Society. "I got to share my knowl
edge about shelter building and wilderness sur-

vival with little kids, and I even got to take a
shower a few times."
This is the fourth time in the past five years
that Stanford students have spent their spring
break among the redwoods. The relationship
began when the Human Biology Department
was matched with the program through a

county's adopt-a-school pro
gram.
"We wanted to enhance
our program by involving
Stanford students," said out
door education Director Lisa
Glass, "so we set up a week
long internship through the
Haas Center for Public Ser
vice."
Initially, applications
from Human Biology majors
received preference, but this
year participants came from
a wide variety of majors,
including in Earth Systems,
Political Science, Psycholo
gy, VTSS and Anthropology.
Some students have even
been hired by the program,
according to Glass.
Students from all disci

plines learn skills that relate
to their studies, according to Site Director Steve
Van Zandt. "For those going into teaching, out
door ed(ucation) is essential. It's a whole
approach to teaching that should be in every
teacher's repertoire," he said.
"I always thought teaching had to be the
most selfless thing in the world," said freshman
Taylor Antrim. "But after this week, I realize
teachers can get something out of it too."
The week's activities culminated on Thurs
day night, when each cabin presented a skit to
the whole school. The Stanford students per
formed a skit that summarized what they
observed during the week.
"The week really came into focus when we
were practicing our skit," said Michelle Mello, a
senior majoring in political science. "We real
ized all the really terrific things that go on at
outdoor ed."
