# To sneeze or not to sneeze
## Bug explains tactile stimulus and photic sneezing

"Speak roughly to your little boy,
And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
Because he knows it teases."

Q: Why do I always sneeze when 1 pluck my eye
brows ?
— Marie Marie
A: Believe it or not, your question is the subject
of a controversy which even now rages
through the halls of academic medicine.
Sneezing in association with tactile stimulus
near the eye, as well as the related affliction of
photic sneezing (sneezing upon sudden exposure
to bright light), has been discussed in medical lit
erature for over three decades, but its cause is still
a mystery.
Since photic sneezing is the better documented
of the two phenomena, I will prattle on about it
for a while and then elucidate the connection
between said prattling and your question.
Photic sneezing was first described in 1964 by
a neurologist who noted that some patients
sneezed uncontrollably during routine ophthal
mologic exams involving those annoying pen-sized
flashlights which doctors receive by the gross
from drug companies.
Over the course of the next dozen years,
researchers discovered that photic sneezing is
genetic, passed down in a dominant fashion —
which means that only one of your parents has to
have the trait to pass it down to you (as opposed to
a recessive trait, whose transmission requires
that both parents be affected or at least carriers of
the trait gene).
In 1978, in an atypically whimsical article in
the journal "Birth Defects," researchers dubbed
photic sneezing the "ACHOO syndrome"; the
obviously contrived acronym stands for "Autoso

mal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic
Outburst."
The originators of this wacky nomenclature
emphasized the benign nature of the syndrome: It
is not associated with known sneeze complications
such as conductive hearing loss, mediastinal hem
orrhage (that's "nosebleed," to you), and — I
hadn't known about this one — vaginal tears.
Bless you, ma'am.
Swedish researchers, a full quarter of whose
ethnic cohorts possess the photic sneezing trait,
have suggested that the ACHOO syndrome might
confer a selective advantage in some climes: In an
arctic population, where one is frequently exposed
to extremes of cold and agents of respiratory
infection, it would be beneficial to be "a gut sneez
er, ja, you betcha."
Although otherwise productive medical
researchers have exhaustively described the
demographic and genetic properties of photic
sneezing, the mechanism by which bright light
evokes this non sequitur response is less clear.
A study performed late in the last decade on
sufferers of ACHOO syndrome reported that
sneezing generally lags 2.5 to 15 seconds behind
exposure to bright light. This long latency period
suggests that the connection between stimulus
and response involves several stages.
One possibility is that lacrimation (secretion
from the tear ducts) and squinting following sud
den exposure to light may stimulate the nasal
