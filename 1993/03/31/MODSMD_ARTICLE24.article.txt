# Arms control expert pays visit to Hoover
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
The United States' top arms control officer
said yesterday he does not think the current
political turmoil in Russia will have a signifi
cant effect on arms control agreements
between the two countries.
While, in theory, it should always be "better
to deal with a democracy," U.S. Air Force Maj.
Gen. Robert Parker, speaking at the Hoover
Institution, pointed out that Russian military
staff who coordinate mutual weapons inspec
tions have remained the same throughout the
Soviet Union's recent political transition.
Even during the short-lived coup that
attempted to remove former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, the military continued
the mutual verification of arms control agree
ments, perhaps using this "as a venue to say,
'We'd like to meet (our) international obliga
tions,' " Parker said.
But as the global political climate becomes
more open and peaceful, the On Site Inspec
tion Agency, directed by Parker and charged
with verifying arms control agreements made

by the United States, is "the only agency with
in [the defense sector] that is growing," he
said.
Parker visited Hoover yesterday to give a
talk on the agency's role and discuss the bene
fits and pitfalls of verifying arms control
agreements.
"Our charter is very simple," Parker
explained to the dozen or so people in the audi
ence. The 5-year-old agency monitors other
countries' compliance with "any arms control
agreement that the United States enters
into," he said.
The agency's responsibilities include elimi
nating intermediate-range nuclear forces,
observing underground nuclear tests, reduc
ing conventional armed forces in Europe, and
destroying chemical weapons as prescribed by
bilateral agreements with Russia and a multi
lateral agreement cosigned by 138 countries.
According to Parker, the United States has
had a longstanding poli<y to "exercise every
right that is given under the treaty." In the
case of the Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe treaty, this means monitoring the
destruction of each of the approximately

19,000 weapons that are slated for destruction.
Parker emphasized that his team is "very
intrusive," citing the agency's motto: "Trust
â€” but verify."
He says the arms control agreements with
mutual inspection are beneficial precisely
because they, "for the first time, allowed
intrusive inspections."
From a personal point of view, Parker feels
the inspections have indeed opened the coun
tries up to one another. He cites the warm
welcome received by the American teams
wherever they went in Russia.
On the American front, Parker cited the
example of a Russian inspection team that
was "adopted" by the people of Marshal,
Texas.
Besides the current agreements, the agency
also expects to conduct operations under the
Open Skies agreement, which allows countries
to fly in each other's airspace to monitor arms
build up and deployment.
Parker characterized the agreement as "a
poor man's national technical means," saying
it will likely be used by member countries to
monitor their neighbors' arms concentrations.
