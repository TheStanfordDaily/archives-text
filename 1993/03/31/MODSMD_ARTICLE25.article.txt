# Cardinal gone, but Final Fours go on
## 
### 
I may not have Schwartz's side
burns, but here goes my
roundball roundup, a post
mortem on Cardinal hoops and
predictions for those eight schools
lucky enough to advance to the
April portion of March Madness:
To put it bluntly, the 1992-93
men's and women's basketball
seasons will not rank among the
greatest in Stanford history. In
fact, they will hardly rank in the
middle of the pack, especially the
recent Mike Montgomery-Tara

VanDerveer pack. In fact, I hate
to bring it up, but the bottom
feeding Dallas Mavericks have
won three games since March 15,
exactly one more than our two
Cardinal squads have played in
that span.
But the purpose here is not to
belittle the efforts of our men and
women in red, merely to put their
efforts in perspective. After all,
Stanford fans have feasted too
long on the spoils of the largest,
most successful sports program
in the nation, placing a Haver
shamian load of great expecta
tions on their athletes and feeling
jilted when they bring home any
thing less than a championship
ring of some kind. The chasm
between excitement and letdown
narrows significantly when antic
ipation and rose-colored outlooks
are subtracted from the equation.
For example, predictions for
the Cardinal men's team placed it
anywhere from fourth to eighth
place in a weak, topsy-turvy Pac
-10 field. For Stanford — which
wound up 2-16 and dead last in
the conference — the absence of
Adam Keefe was expected, while
losing the services of Paul Garrett
(early graduation), Jason Weaver,
David Harbour and Andy Pop
pink (injuries) for the entire sea
son was certainly not.
Freshmen Darren Allaway and
Dion Cross gave the program
hope for the future, but the Car
dinal ultimately suffered from a
lack of depth and inside muscle,
two ingredients needed to com
pete in any Division I league.
While his 7-23 overall record
remains the most vivid memory
of a season of frustration, Mont
gomery should be commended for
maintaining a M.A.S.H.-like
morale among the wounded and
for scheming to hold as many of
his team's opponents close for as

long as possible. Many of Stan
ford's losses were only blowouts
in the last five minutes, when 35
minutes of hard work finally
overtaxed the undermanned
squad.
As for the women's team, well,
you walk a fine line in saying that
a Cardinal squad that finishes 26-
6, wins its fifth-consecutive Pac
-10 title with a 15-3 conference
record and advances to the Sweet
16 of the NCAA Tournament is a
disappointment.
While the first-ever No. 1
ranking for the defending nation
al-champion Cardinal — with all
but two members of its 1991-92
squad returning — in the presea
son polls appeared reasonable
enough, a pair of early-season
losses to a Tennessee team that
had lost a couple of big guns
should have alerted Stanford fans
to the fact that there were a cou
ple of leaks in the well-oiled
machine.
However, I for one thought
that the Cardinal's No. 1 seeding
in the West Regional was war
ranted, if only so that rematches
with USC and Texas Tech could
be avoided until the regional
final. What was not warranted,
however, was having to play Col
orado, a team ranked ahead of
Stanford for much of the season,
in the regional semifinal round.
Either the Cardinal and the Buf
faloes should have been seeded
one-two, or one of the teams
should have been sent out of the
region. Luckily, when the
women's field finally expands to
64 teams next season, regional
ties will be broken under certain
circumstances.
But next season won't erase
the year that was, or the remark
able accomplishments of seniors
Val Whiting, Molly Goodenbour,
Chris MacMurdo and Angela Tay
lor, whose careers were cut short
but whose two NCAA rings can
never be taken away. Thanks
for the memories.
Finally, I must take care of the
nasty pieces of business that are
the Cardinal-less Final Fours. In
the women's semifinals in
Atlanta on Saturday, I like Ohio
State in an all-Big Ten matchup
with lowa. Katie Smith should
knock down a few three-pointers
in the early going, Vivian Stringer
will call timeout and try to con
vince her charges that they are
still in Carver-Hawkeye Arena
(where they won the Mideast
Regional behind a decidedly
unfair homecourt advantage), but
the Buckeye attack will be relent
less.
In the marquee matchup, I like
Vanderbilt in a close contest with
Texas Tech. Yes, Sheryl Swoopes is
an outstanding individual talent
