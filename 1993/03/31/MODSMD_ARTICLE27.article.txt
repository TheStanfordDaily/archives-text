# Gymnasts win last dual meet, MPSF title
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Winning and bonding. That is
what Spring Break was all about
for the Stanford men's gymnastics
team, which trounced both San
Jose State and California in its last
regular-season meet, then went on
to capture the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation championship
last weekend.
The Cardinal posted a season
high team score of 282.45 in the
San Jose meet, only to break the
mark the following weekend with
284.60, more than four points
ahead of its nearest competitor.
"The Sam Jose meet turned out
pretty much as I expected," said
coach Sadao Hamada. "Some of the
guys were still throwing new rou
tines and in that situation, it was
basically whoever hit their routines
ended up with huge scores."
Senior Jair Lynch placed first in
the all-around competition with
57.60 and also secured first place on
the pommel horse, parallel bars and
high bar. Junior Mark Booth cap
tured a second place in the all
around with 56.85 and placed in the
top three on four individual events.
The team used the San Jose
meet primarily as a warmup for the
MPSF Championships, in which
teams from the Pacific-10 Confer
ence, the Western Athletic Confer
ence and the Big West Conference
took part.
"Our consistency was a lot bet
ter in the championships," Hamada
said. "We only missed nine routines
in all and our score was about right
on our target."
Once again, Lynch topped the
all-around list with a score of 58.10
on the first night of the competi
tion. The following day, he went on
to win an individual title on the
vault with 9.50, and both the high
bar and the pommel horse with
scores of 9.80. Lynch's perfor
mance earned him the title of 1993
MPSF Gymnast of the Year.
"The team really fired up and
rose to the occasion in this meet,"
Lynch said. "We didn't worry
about anyone else — we just con
centrated on our scores which is
what we really need to do in these
big competitions."
Stanford was further boosted by

Booth's 57.35 third-place finish
and senior Jeff Bender's score of
56.45, good enough for fifth place.
Junior Jason Cohen and sopho
more Jing Wei-Liang also made
valuable contributions the Cardi
nal effort, both advancing to the
individual finals in two or more
events.
Not only did his gymnasts earn
titles based on their performances
over the weekend, but Hamada was
also recognized for his achievement
as the 1993 MPSF Coach of the
Year.
While mention of the honor does
bring a smile to his face, Hamada is
still focusing his attention on the
rest of the season. He remains con
fident of the team's level of difficul
ty, overall talent and skill level, yet
knows that other teams are anx
ious to down the defending nation
al champions.
"I feel like this is a very impor
tant time of year," Hamada said.
"From this point on, all of our ener
gy has to be directed towards our
performance at NCAAs."
"In these two meets, we really
started to get into the groove,"
Booth said. "Now we're not just
individuals competing, but we're
much more team-oriented."
Cohen commented on the
intense level of competition as the
"bonding factor" which has
brought the team together.
"Since we are all sharing the
same intense experience, we are all
a lot more supportive of each
other," he said. "That fuels our
drive to both work out and compete
harder."
The team's next challenge will
come this weekend at the NCAA
Regionals held in Norman, Okla. A
top-three finish in that meet
secures a spot in the NCAA Finals.
In the remaining three weeks of the
season, polishing routines will be
one of key goals for the Cardinal.
"At this point, there's not
much more we can do to prepare
other than correcting the small
problems," Lynch said.
Based on its performances over
the last two weeks, the Cardinal's
NCAA prospects are looking bright.
After three more weeks of polishing
and perfecting, the national cham
pions feel they will be ready when
called upon to defend their title.
