# Golfers get soaked in shortened match
## 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team
returned to campus earlier than
expected over Spring Break, due
to storm conditions that forced a
premature end to the Pacific
Coast Championship at Santa
Barbara's Sandpiper Golf Club.
Arizona State won the tourna
ment with a team score of 570,
followed by Pepperdine at 583,
UC-Santa Barbara at 584 and
Fresno State at 589. Stanford fin
ished in the pack with a team
score of 611.
Joe Acosta of Fresno State was
the individual champion with a
two-round total of 139. Stanford's
top-two finishers were sophomore
Jerry Chang, who tallied a 147,
and classmate Steve Burdick, who
shot a 148.
Although the Cardinal finished
far behind the winning schools,
coach Wally Goodwin considered
his team's performance to be

'We were disappoint
ed because we're a
last-day team.'

"close to where I Figured we would
be at this point in the season."
The Santa Barbara weather
held out through Wednesday, the
first day, allowing for two rounds
of golf. But it also made for an 11-
hour stretch containing 36 holes
of golf. "It was simply brutal,"
Goodwin explained.
The rain began Wednesday
night and didn't let up. The tour
nament ended abruptly with only
two of three rounds played.
"We were disappointed because
we're a last-day team," said fresh
man Brian Ligotti. "We tend to
shoot well then and we didn't get a
chance to improve our score."

the rain-shortened Pacific Coast Championships last week.
