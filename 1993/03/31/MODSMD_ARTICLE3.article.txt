# Women's sports to receive boost
## Varsity sports, scholarships added 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Addressing the issue of Stan
ford's compliance with a federal
anti-discrimination statute, Ath
letic Director Ted Leland yester
day announced the creation of
three new varsity sports and 29
more full athletic scholarships for
women within the next four years.
Called the Women's Sports En
hancement Program, the changes,
which will cost nearly $1 million
per year, will bring the University
into abidance with Title IX of the
1972 Education Amendments.
Synchronized swimming,
lacrosse and water polo will sup
plement the 14 existing women's
varsity sports, bringing the total

to 17, while the men will continue
to field 15 varsity sports.
When asked about the new
equilibrium between the varsity
team totals, men's water polo
coach Dante Dettamanti said, "It
doesn't bother me as much as
schools which cut men's sports in
order to promote women's sports.
"That's why Stanford is
unique. Instead of cutting men's
programs to make it equal to the
women's program, we're adding
women's programs to make them
equal to the men's," he said.
Stanford female athlete partic
ipation will jump from 265 in
1992-93 to a projected 325 in
1996-97, while the men will re
main at 405. Right now women
comprise 40 percent of Cardinal
varsity athletic participation, and
the goal of Leland's program is to
increase that figure to 45 percent
by 1996-97.
A objective of Title EX is to
ensure that the male-to-female
ratio in the student body is accu
rately reflected in the ratio of male
to-female athletes.
Stanford's student body
approaches a 50/50 split, and
according to Assoc. Athletic Direc
tor Cheryl Levick, this is the mark
for which the athletic program will
eventually strive.
In the area of scholarships, the
women presently receive 73 full
scholarships, as opposed to the
men's 164. Title EX guidelines also
mandate that athletic scholarships
be distributed in accordance with
the ratio of male-to-female athletes.
Stanford will move closer to this
goal by 1996-97, as the women are
projected to receive 102 scholar
ships to the men's 143.
The decline in men's scholar
ships will be due to an NCAA man
date, not the new women's
enhancement program.
"There will be female teams with
scholarships whereas the 'equiva
lent' male team will not have schol
arships," Levick said. "That's just
what we have to live with, because
of the NCAA mandates."
According to Leland, Stanford
will become a model for other
schools with this new program,
which also entails additional ser
vices for women athletes in aca
demic advising, sports medicine,

sports information and clerical
support.
"We're doing this because it's
fair," Leland said. "It's the right
thing to do because these types of
opportunities should be available
on the same basis for women as
they are for men.
"We are not being subjected to
lawsuits or litigation right now. We
are not being pushed into this in a
direct sense. We are being pushed
into this because we feel an educa
tional obligation. Stanford intends
to take a leadership role in this area
and set a national model."
After protests of inequality
between the men's and women's
athletics programs last year, the
Department of Athletics created
the Title IX committee, headed by
Sharon Parker, the director for
multicultural development.
According to Levick, the com
mittee found inconsistencies and
deficiencies in the women's athletic
program in the areas of financial
assistance, accommodation of
interest and ability, tutors, medical
and training facilities, locker rooms
and publicity.
"The Women's Sports Enhance
ment Program will implement cor
rections for those deficiencies and
bring the programs to complete
parity," Levick said.
The program is a part of a com
prehensive five-year plan for the
Athletics Department that will
address the issues of new facilities,
finances and academic programs in
athletics.
The plan will be finalized in
June and be ready for public scruti
ny by fall. However, Leland empha
sized the importance of the

Women's Sports Enhancement
Program yesterday by choosing to
single it out right now — so the
department can "begin implement
ing it earlier than if we waited for
the rest of the plan to develop."
Since the program will receive
no financial assistance from the
University, all the funds will be
generated through the Athletics
Department, Leland said.
"Our first alternative (to not
receiving University funding) is a
very simple one, one that causes
our development office to cringe,"
Leland said.
"And that is to raise the money.
Honestly, I think we have a great
program to raise money for this
project."
The crux of this ambitious fund
raising project is Campaign 2000, a
program designed to raise $34 mil
lion over the next three years. This
will supplement the $5 million to
$6 million the Athletics Depart
ment raises annually.
"I believe that the best way to
make this work is to be aggressive
and tell people that we are setting a
national model for women's athlet
ics," Leland said.
"I think people will support us.
We already have a $1.5 million
donation (from Stanford Trustee
Peter Bing and his wife, Helen) for
the Women's Enhancement Pro
gram."
The funds will be broken down
in the following manner: $15 mil
lion for 29 new scholarships in the
women's athletic program, $5 mil
lion for program endowment which
will offset salaries and travel
expenses, and $14 million to reno
vate Stanford Stadium.

Another source of revenue will
be generated by football, which
Leland regards as a "tremendous
financial impetus for our pro
gram."
Leland also insists that women's
athletics will generate income to
help finance itself.
Overall, men's tennis coach Dick
Gould said he believed the new pro
gram would be "phenomenal."

"We have a very aggressive, far
sighted, pro-active administration
that generates a tremendous
amount of enthusiasm for athlet
ics," Gould said. "I think this new
plan is a move in the right direction."
In addition to the women's pro
gram, Leland also plans to make
Stanford a model in need-based
financial aid for athletes in the
future, starting with an NCAA

convention addressing that issue
in 1995.
"We also feel that someone
nationally has to come out from a
prestigious university with a presti
gious sports program like ours and
say that need-based financial aid is
really the future of college athlet
ics," Leland said. "We want to take a
leadership role in trying to make
that possible as well."
