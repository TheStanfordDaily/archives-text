# Webb Ranch, union agree on pay raise
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
After nine months of negotia
tions with Webb Ranch, workers
have settled on a 6 percent salary
increase for the 1993-94 contract
year and 5 percent for 1994-95, a
union leader said yesterday.
"We went back and forth, over a
dozen meetings or more trying to
get them to move on issues," said
United Stanford Workers field rep
resentative Ruben Serna. While ac
knowledging that any increase
marks an important step forward
for the workers, Serna said, "It's
still not where we'd like it to be."
Ranch workers currently earn
between $5 to $6.50 per hour.
Under the agreement, they will re
ceive from $5.57 to $7.23 by 1994.
In contrast, the minimum starting
wage for students seeking campus
employment is $7.16.
The new wages will take effect
tomorrow, the beginning of the
contract year.
Serna said the ranch originally
offered only a 1 percent increase for
the 1994-95 contract year, but
gradually raised the amount
throughout the negotiations.

However, Serna said the ranch
proposed freezing wages for work
ers who make extra money work
ing in other parts of campus, which
the union refused. He said the two
sides then called in a mediator, who
after two months of discussion sug
gested a 4 percent increase in 1992-
93, 5 percent in 1993-94 and re
opening talks in 1994.
According to Serna, neither side
was satisfied with that recommen
dation; the Webbs said they
couldn't offer those wages right
away due to the expenses they in
curred from renovating eight new
trailers for families who live on the
ranch, and the union was wary of
waging another pay increase fight
in 1994, Serna said.
He said that after the Webbs of
fered a 3 percent increase for 1993-
94 and 4 percent for 1994-95, the
union struck a tentative bargain in
which the workers would forego a
1992-93 pay increase if the rates
were higher the next two years â€” 6
percent and 5 percent.
"We had a meeting with the
workers at Webb, and told them we
had a tentative agreement," Serna
