# Ayn Rand Society plans anti-Earth Day events

Flyers with messages like
"Man over Owl," "Environmen
talism Kills," and "Please DO
NOT Recycle" might seem ridicu
lous to most Stanford students,
but the Ayn Rand Society was se
rious when it recently posted ap
proximately 400 leaflets with
such messages.
The group intends to "stir up a
bit of controversy" as Earth Day
approaches, explained Jon Marek,
a founder of the group.
"We're opposed to Earth Day
because the movement of envi
ronmentalism undermines the
progress of science and technolo
gy and the rational development
of people," Marek said. Stanford
will host Bay Area Earth Day
events on April 17.
According to Marek, Rand's
philosophy says that values
should be only measured with re
spect to human beings. "A job is
more important than some owl
because a job is a value to a human
being while an owl is not," Marek
explained.
In response to Stanford's
Earth Day activities, the group
will have a table in White Plaza on
April 14 to spark some "free de
bate" on the innate goodness of
environmentalism.
That evening, the group will
sponsor two lectures in Cubberley
Auditorium. Dr. George Reisman,

an economics professor at Pepper
dine University, and Dr. Richard
Sanford, a government research
geologist, will both lecture on the
fallacy of environmentalism.
Noting that this is the biggest
event the group has organized so
far, Marek hopes to see about 400
people come.
According to Marek, "there are
countless instances . . . where en
vironmentalism actually kills peo
ple and takes away from the qual
ity of life."
"For instance [consider]
malaria: the ban on DDT effec
tively kills millions of people each
year because the DDT, which kills
the mosquitos that cause malaria,
can't be sprayed," he said.
Marek explained that the
"Please DO NOT Recycle" flyer
was meant to challenge the notion
that recycling is necessarily good.
"We're not opposed to recy
cling in general, but if you look at
what a lot of recycling does, it ac
tually costs money and time and
human effort and doesn't provide
benefits," he said.
"If we lived on the moon and
there were only 30 trees, then it
would make sense, but we don't. .
. . We live on a giant planet with
tons of trees. Recycling costs more
human effort and ability" than
it's worth, Marek added.
