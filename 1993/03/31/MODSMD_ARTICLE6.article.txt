## Lane Library to charge outsiders $500 fee 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Staff reductions coupled with increased usage
have prompted Lane Medical Library to consider
replacing its free, open-access policy with a $500
annual access and borrowing fee for patrons not
affiliated with Stanford.
According to Jennifer Stringer, head of circu
lation for the library, "unrecorded circulation"

— materials not checked out but used in the li
brary — totaled 284,125 items in 1987. In 1992,
there were 405,111 items in unrecorded circula
tion. This increase in traffic has "caused an
undue burden" on circulation staff, Stringer
said.
Valerie Su, deputy director of Lane, was not
sure when the new policy would be implemented.
"It's going to happen, we just don't know when."
The decision will ultimately be made by the dean

of the Medical School, she said.
This change "has been discussed for a very
long time," Su said. "A lot of our friends in the
community, other libraries, hospitals and corpo
rations, have been hearing this forever."
There is currently a $500 annual fee for pa
trons who want borrowing privileges, but no fee
for people using collections inside the library.
The change in policy would require library users
to pay $500 for access and borrow
ing privileges.
"$5OO is just too much," said
Burlingame doctor Naheed Mangi.
Mangi is studying to take the
United States Medical Federal
Licensing Board examination and
uses the library's special exam
review section.
"There are no other libraries for
us ... and I don't see any reason to
have to go to [UC-San Franciscol,"
she said.
The UCSF medical library has a
larger collection than Lane and
gives all students, staff and Califor
nia-licensed health professionals
free cards to check out library
materials. Members of the public
have free access to the library, but
no borrowing privileges.
Mangi is starting a letter-writing
campaign that includes a letter to
President Clinton about this situa
tion. "I have a problem with any
hospital that will close their doors
for medical professionals," she said.
In 1991, Lane went through
"repositioning," which reduced

library staff. Stringer said one full
time position in the circulation
department was eliminated.
"The more people, the messier
the shelves get, the more time you
have to spend putting things in
order," said Stringer, adding that
it is difficult to keep up with the
increase of in-library use of mate
rials.
The $500 fee would probably be
used to fund staff help for reshelv
ing, she said, and would definitely
not be a revenue-generating policy
for the library.
By levying the fee, "we're trying
to protect the resources here for
Stanford students, faculty and
staff," said Su.
"We're trying to be fair. We
have a wonderful resource here
and there should be a fair and equi
table way to distribute it," said Su.
"People not affiliated can make
choices, it's not that if they need
information, they can't get it, they
could go to their own library first,
but they don't. They think of Stan
ford first," said Su.
"We're glad to have the reputa
tion, but if they went to their
library first and only came to Lane
as a last resort, then there would
be less of an impact."
