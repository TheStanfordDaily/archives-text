## Haas center moves into new quarters 
### Urmimala Sarkar 
With the opening of a new
$3.3 million building, student
service groups and staff mem
bers at the Haas Center for
Public Service will no longer be
working in cramped offices
with inadequate facilities.
Occupants are moving from
their old headquarters at Owen
House into the newly con
structed building this week.
Approximately four times
the size of the former location,
the new facility will house 30
student community-service or
ganizations, as well as provide
conference rooms for group
meetings, said Asst. Director of
the center Diane Coward.

The additional space pro
vides office space for previously
unhoused student groups, such
as Upward Bound and Students
for Environmental Action at
Stanford. In addition, it enables
more student groups, such as
Volunteers in Asia, Alpha Phi
Omega and Students Offering
Alternative Realities, to be
come affiliated with the Haas
Center, according to Volunteer
Coordinator Linda Cheu.
Asst. Director Megan
Swezey said she expects the
new facility to foster greater in
teraction between organiza
tions. For example, all of the tu
toring programs will be

grouped together to "allow stu
dent leaders to work together in
a common place" with the aid of
shared information and
resources, she said.
While staff members say the
moving has been an added com
plication, no one is complaining.
"Nothing works, but we're in
good humor," said Betty Walker,
assistant to the director,
describing co-workers as "over
joyed and ecstatic" about the
new offices.
"We're still in boxes," said
Coward, but she said she is opti
mistic they will complete their
moving by the end of the week.
According to Cheu, the addi
tional space was sorely needed.
In the old facility, she said, as
many as 10 organizations shared
one phone line and two desks —
in an office "about the size of a
dorm room" — whereas the new
facility accommodates more
organizations more comfortably.
Sophomore Kara Imm, who

works with the You Can Make A
Difference conference, said the
move is "new and exciting, and it
shows a real commitment to pub
lic service."

Swezey emphasized the Uni
versity's "commitment to ser
vice" that the new facility
reflects. She added that "no
other university has a facility of

this type."
The new Haas Center will
have its official opening on April
23, with a dedication ceremony
and tours of the new building.
