To see original documents signed by
America's founding fathers, one must
travel thousands of miles to our na
tion's capital. But to view the hand
written notes of Russian forefathers
Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin, a walk
across campus will suffice.
Nearly two years of cooperation be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
Russian State Archives Service have

produced the historical exhibit, "Mak
ing Things Work: Russian-American
Economic Relations from 1900-1930,"
which opened at Hoover March 23.
Hoover archivist Anne Van Camp
hopes that the exhibit not only inter
ests but teaches its viewers. "The ex
hibit shows the cooperative relation
ship between two countries," she said.
"There's a strong historical lesson to be
learned from that relationship."
Van Camp said that the exhibit ex

poses many parallels that apply to pre
sent-day business, private enterprise
and government affairs, especially
when the American government is
again wrangling over ways to aid the
former Soviet Union.

the exhibit began in May 1991.
The completion of this exhibit
marks the first major step in a larg
er program of cooperation between
Hoover and the Russian State
Archives Service.
"We were looking for a way to
begin a collaborative relationship,"
Van Camp said. "A joint effort (like
the exhibit) helps tell both sides of
the story."

Within the next five years, the
institution hopes to microfilm
around 25 million documents from
the archives of the former Soviet
Communist Party.
"The Soviet Union is a pro
foundly secret society," said John
Dunlop, a Hoover fellow who serves
on the six-member editorial board
responsible for selecting what doc
uments to transfer to microfilm.
"This is the great untold story of
the 20th century. Twentieth-centu
iy history will most likely be rein
terpreted by what we fmd. Given all
the obstacles, the project is running

relatively smoothly."
Fully financed by Hoover, the
exhibit displays many Russian doc
uments, including the handwritten
responses of Trotsky, Stalin and
Lenin to the efforts of the Ameri
can Relief Administration, a project
to provide extensive humanitarian
aid to Russia during the early
1920s that was initiated by former
President Herbert Hoover.
The public can view the collec
tion in the Herbert Hoover Memo

from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. until May 7.
Admission is free.
