## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Almost six months after its
grand reopening, Memorial
Church will be closed again be
cause of extensive problems with
its ventilation system that may
present a health risk to some vis
itors.
According to Dean of Chapel
Robert Gregg, the church may
have to be closed for as much as
** eight months while a construc
tion crew expands the current
ventilation system. He said the
necessary repairs will cost close
to $500,000.
Without the additional vents,
the environment in the church
will remain "stuffy," leaving
guests in some parts of the build
ing without enough oxygen, he
explained.
"Although the stale air may
not affect a healthy student, we
need to be concerned about any
visitor with lung or heart prob
lems, including such common ail
ments as asthma and allergies,"
Gregg said.
He said the problems should
have been discovered during the
renovation of the building but
were inadvertently overlooked
because of the immensity of the
structural damage stemming
from the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake.
According to Ann Rossi, asso
ciate area director for the Office
of Development, it will be diffi
cult to raise more funds to pay for
the construction of additional
vents after the long fund-raising
campaign that raised the more
than $10 million necessary for
earthquake repairs to the church.
Some students expressed dis
appointment at the closing of the
church.
"I was so glad to see the inside
of Memorial Church before I
graduated. I wanted to take my
parents when they came for my
graduation," said Ben Wu, a se
nior. "Now they may never get to
see it."
The closing of the church will
affect many couples who planned
to be married there during the
next eight months. Gregg said
the church staff would do their
best to re-schedule the weddings
at a later date.
