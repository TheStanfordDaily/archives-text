# Cheating violations reach 'epidemic' proportions
## Students from five classes must sign affidavit today 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Having discovered an "epidemic" of
alleged cheating while investigating re
cent Honor Code violations, University
officials announced yesterday that stu
dents in five winter-quarter classes will
have to sign an additional Honor Code
affidavit before 4 p.m. today in order to
avoid retaking their final exams.
Final grades for Economics 01: "Ele
mentary Economics," Calculus 42, Po
litical Science 10: "American National
Government," History 02, the Cultures,
Ideas and Values track, and Physics 131:
"Quantum Mechanics" may be rescind
ed if students in these classes do not
come forward and reconfirm their ad
herence to the Honor Code.
Students who took one of the five
courses must sign this "addendum to
the Honor Code" by 4 p.m.today in the
Student Records Office, in room 11 of
Old Union, to ensure that their final
grades will stand. Those who do not
make the 4 p.m.deadline will have their
grades voided unless they make arrange
ments with their professors to retake
their final exams by next Monday.
"I realize this does not allow the stu

dents much time, but we want to deal
with the situation as soon as possible to
avoid further inconvenience to all par
ties involved," Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole said.
"We're all very dismayed and over
whelmed by what may be the worst epi
demic of cheating in Stanford history,"
she added.
Cole said the publicity about possible
cheating in Molecular Biology 1 i9, Geo
physics 4 and Philosophy 5B prompted
"a rash of calls from students to profes
sors and the Judicial Affairs Office alert
ing [them] of other classes in which
Honor Code violations had occurred."
Given the "epidemic proportion and
gravity" of the situation, Cole said she
called an emergency meeting yesterday
after 4 p.m.with University President
Gerhard Casper, the professors of the
courses involved and the respective de
partment chairs.
It was determined that the "only fair
resolution" was to have students sign an
additional statement that specifically
states that they did not share informa
tion about the final exam with any other
students, regardless of whether they
took it early, Cole said.
Casper said he was "profoundly dis-

ing, and that the problem calls for signif
icant changes in academic policies and
the Honor Code itself.
The decision to have students sign a
second statement was merely an "inter
im remedy" to "a scourge of dishonesty
and an apparent decline of intellectual
values at Stanford," Casper said.
"Although I am not satisfied with this
resolution, it is the only way we can deal
with the immediate concern of insuring
fair grading in those five classes. There
is a larger issue at hand," Casper said.
"In coming months, I and other Univer
sity officials will be aggressively reevalu
ating the Honor Code and exam poli
cies."
