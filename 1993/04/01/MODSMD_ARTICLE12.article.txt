# Delta Gamma sorority accused of dirty Rush tactics in Branner
## 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
Sometimes sorority women go too far.
Late last night, two members of the Delta
Gamma sorority performed a "Mexican hat dance"
skit in a first-floor hallway at Branner.
The performance, which occurred after the
tents in Wilbur field had been closed for nearly
three hours, appeared to violate the Intersorority
Council's "Rush Rules and Regulations." Accord
ing to the "Rules," during Rush, sororities are not
allowed to recruit potential members except at offi
cially sanctioned events in the Wilbur tents.
The violation could result in punishments as se
vere as tent-closing for the remainder of the week.
"That's ridiculous. This whole thing is ridicu
lous," DG President Sarah Truitt said. "They were
just doing a Mexican hat dance. It had absolutely
nothing to do with rush."
Members of other sororities, however, found the
events in Branner a bit more insidious.
"If we can't perform our Winter Wonderland
routine, there's no way they can do what they did,"
complained Kappa Alpha Theta member Illeana
Perez.
Six members of the ISC judicial board, which
normally includes one member of each sorority,
will meet this afternoon to determine the fate of the
DGs. The DG board member will not be allowed at
the meeting.

ISC Rush Chair Aimee Misenzahl said the skit
performance was the most alarming rush incident
since 1991 when pranksters set off sprinklers in
one of the tents.
"This is not something we take lightly," Misen
zahl said. "Especially since the hat skit is a tradi
tional Delta Gamma recruiting technique."
The Mexican Hat Dance was first performed at
Emory University in 1898, as a victory celebration
after the Spanish-American war. Its now mythical
success has made it a recruiting favorite in chap
ters all across the country, said National DG chair
Ten Weigel.
"It is not a 'skit' in the way you people are talk
ing," Weigel said. "It's more like a celebration."
This afternoon's board meeting is likely to re
sult in a reworking of the rush rules, Misenzahl
said.
"The rules as they stand are too loose. I mean, if
the girls clap at the end it is a skit, and if they don't
it's not? Is mime a skit? These are the questions we
must start to deal with."
Misenzahl also intimated that the hat dance in
and of itself — even if performed in a tent under
proper regulations — may be a violation.
"Is something like the hat dance something we
want people to think of when they think of sorori
ties? I mean, we have a lot of Mexican, Latino,
Chicano and Hispanic women coming to the
tents."
