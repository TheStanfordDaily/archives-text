Come hear Uncle John's Band.
Giving rebirth to a former
Stanford tradition, the Grateful
spring* if\jmvers{{y" oltiCTalB, po
lice and representatives of the
band reach agreement on a new
plan for keeping the show safe.
The group is tentatively sched
uled to play at Frost Amphithe
ater May 21.
The members of the Dead have
expressed concern about the
amount of planned security, and
are still engaged in negotiations
with the University. According to
a spokesman for the band, both
the uncertain outcome of those
negotiations and the unpre
dictability of lead singer Jerry
Garcia's health mean the perfor
mance is not yet set in stone.

The University wants to make
certain there will be no problems
like those that ended the Dead's
annual festivals on campus in
1989.
The last time the group played
here, the police made 36 arrests
for various offenses, including
drug use.
"This year, we are going to
crack down," said Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "There will be
more than 75 police officers on
hand.
"Any people found in posses
sion of drugs will be prosecuted,"
he added. "This time we're seri
ous."
"Security is one thing," said
the Dead's spokesman. "But it
sounds to us like the Stanford Po
lice are going to shut us down be
fore we ever get started."
