### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Stanford students, get your
long johns ready.
The Overseas Studies Pro
gram yesterday announced the
creation of its newest foreign
campus in Toronto. According to
Russell Berman, director of over
seas studies, the program will
host its first class in winter quar
ter of the 1993-94 school year
and will be run in conjunction
with the University of Toronto.
Starting with the 1994-95
school year, the program will be
held in both autumn and winter
quarters, Berman added.
University President Gerhard
Casper — who met last month
with University of Toronto Pres
ident Robert Mackenzie to final
ize plans for Stanford in Toronto
— called the program "an excit
ing adventure in multicultural
ism.
"This will let students expand
their views beyond Palo Alto, be
yond America," Casper said.
"This will let students encounter
stereotypes and get different per
spectives on things we often take
for granted."
History Prof. Michael Fox, di
rector of the Center for Canadian
Studies, agreed.

"Many people just think of
hockey or Alan Thicke when they
think of Canada, but there's
much more than that. Canada is
teeming with vibrancy." Fox said.
"Studying Canadian culture also
gives a unique perspective on the
American experience."
Fox said students will live in
an apartment building in Toron
to, and take classes from both
University of Toronto professors
and visiting Stanford faculty.
Among classes scheduled for the
program's first quarter are
courses on Canadian health care
and education, aboriginal/settler
conflict in Canada and a seminar
on the Canadian dairy industry
in which Fox said "students will
get to make and eat their own
cheeses."
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and
Regina, Saskatchewan, were also
considered as sites for Stanford's
Canadian campus, but Fox said
Toronto was chosen because "it
is a city filled with love and won
der — really the center of Cana
da's fascinating culture. It's the
birthplace of Bryan Adams and
Peter Jennings, you know."
Students will be able to take
field trips to Niagara Falls and
Ellesmere Island, which lies
above the Arctic Circle, to see the
aurora borealis.
