Modest Russian aid plan
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton is preparing a modest aid package
for Boris Yeltsin that will send several
hundred American helpers rather than
huge amounts of money to Russia, admin
istration officials said yesterday.
The Americans are charged with help
ing modernize farms and factories, creat
ing an effective transportation system,
creating small businesses and remaking
state industries into private businesses.
Money will go to "people from our food
industry, retired American farmers,
retired American business executives, peo
ple who have expertise" who would go and
work in Russia for six months to two years,
said an official.
The officials said that three-quarters of
the programs would bypass the central

government and be targeted outside
Moscow, down to the far corners of Russia.
Sudan asks for help
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - For the
first time, Sudan's government appealed
yesterday for outside intervention to
stop fighting among rebel groups in
southern Sudan.

Army announced a unilateral cease-fire
last month, and the government recip
rocated.
The government "calls upon interna
tional communities in general and African
leaders to exert necessary pressure on ...
rebel factions to stop the raging combat
immediately and begin serious prepara
tion for the forthcoming peace talks," said
a government spokesman.
