# U.N. to enforce Bosnia flight ban
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Security Council increased international
pressure on Bosnia's Serbs yesterday by
authorizing NATO warplanes to shoot
down aircraft that violate a ban on flights
over Bosnia.
But the council bowed to the
demands of Russia, a longtime Serb
ally, and ruled out the pre-emptive
bombing of Serb airfields as part of the
long-delayed enforcement measure,
diplomats said.
The resolution, which is a symbolic
victory for Bosnia's Muslims, was sup
ported by 14 of the 15 nations on the
council. China abstained.
With the resolution, the international
community hopes to pressure Bosnian
Serbs to sign a peace agreement already
approved by Bosnia's Croats and the
Muslim government.
In another development, the United

States apparently persuaded its allies on
the council not to endorse or approve the
peace plan, apparently because Washing
ton wants to retain some flexibility
should the plan fall through.
Enforcement of the no-flight ban,
enacted in October to protect Bosnia's
Muslims, has little military significance
because almost all the attacks on the
Muslims have been by ground troops, not
Serb warplanes.
But symbolically, it has been promot
ed by Muslim states and other countries
as a display of international support for
Bosnian Muslims and outrage against
Bosnian Serbs.
Lord Owen, one of the authors of the
peace plan, said before the resolution was
passed: "I don't think (the ban does) a lot
but I think it's important to go ahead and
do it and I think it makes it clear that you
can't flout Security Council resolutions."

The outgunned Bosnian government
and Muslim states are lobbying for the
more militarily significant step of lifting
the international arms embargo against
Bosnia.
So far, the no-fly zone has been violat
ed 465 times, mostly by non-military
flights, U.N. officials say. But recently,
small planes attacked Muslim villages in
eastern Bosnia and then fled toward
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
Earlier, Russia was a holdout, delaying
adoption of the resolution three times last
week for fear that President Boris Yeltsin
would be hurt politically by endorsing
new punitive measures against Serbia.
Because of the concession to Moscow,
NATO warplanes will be allowed only to
shoot down Serb planes already in the air
over Bosnia, and will not be allowed to
bomb airfields to prevent Serb aircraft
from taking off, diplomats said.
