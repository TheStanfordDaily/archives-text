# A temporary reprieve
## Cost cut cancelled, but schools remain wary

University officials are relieved the gov
ernment last week rejected a proposal to re
duce indirect-cost funding by $1.2 billion,
but they still remain concerned about how
the Clinton administration will change fed
erally funded research at universities like
Stanford.
The proposal would have meant major
cutbacks for many research universities
that are already in the midst of budget cuts.
It could have cost Stanford up to $25 mil
lion, according to Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten.
The fact that government officials have
changed their minds "suggests they now
have a much broader understanding of the
issue," Van Etten said.
However, he maintained it was still "too
early to tell" if the Clinton administration
is heading in a direction that will be posi

costs, since many key appointments have
yet to be made.
President Clinton first mentioned the

proposed cut — which would save $1.2 bil
lion over the next several years by adopting
an upper limit on indirect costs — in his
February economic address.
According to Van Etten, the new cap on
indirect costs — basically overhead costs
that cannot be charged to a specific re
search project, such as building deprecia
tion — could have been as low as 44 per
cent, a large reduction from Stanford's cur
rent cap of 60.3 percent.
Fortunately for Stanford and other re
search universities, the proposal was re
scinded. While cuts still need to be made
from the funding given to universities for
research, they will not necessarily be com
ing out of indirect-cost funding, Van Etten
said.
"We've been informed that it was a mis
take," said Cornelius Pings, president of
the Association of American Universities, a
Washington, D.C., organization that has
been working to bring the concerns of uni
versities to the government's attention.
Part of the reason for rescinding the
