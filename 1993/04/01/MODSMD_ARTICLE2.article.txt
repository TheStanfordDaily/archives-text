# A 						temporary reprieve
## Cost cut cancelled, but schools remain wary 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
University officials are relieved the gov
ernment last week rejected a proposal to re
duce indirect-cost funding by $1.2 billion,
but they still remain concerned about how
the Clinton administration will change fed
erally funded research at universities like
Stanford.
The proposal would have meant major
cutbacks for many research universities
that are already in the midst of budget cuts.
It could have cost Stanford up to $25 mil
lion, according to Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten.
The fact that government officials have
changed their minds "suggests they now
have a much broader understanding of the
issue," Van Etten said.
However, he maintained it was still "too
early to tell" if the Clinton administration
is heading in a direction that will be posi
tive for universities in terms of indirect
costs, since many key appointments have
yet to be made.
President Clinton first mentioned the

proposed cut — which would save $1.2 bil
lion over the next several years by adopting
an upper limit on indirect costs — in his
February economic address.
According to Van Etten, the new cap on
indirect costs — basically overhead costs
that cannot be charged to a specific re
search project, such as building deprecia
tion — could have been as low as 44 per
cent, a large reduction from Stanford's cur
rent cap of 60.3 percent.
Fortunately for Stanford and other re
search universities, the proposal was re
scinded. While cuts still need to be made
from the funding given to universities for
research, they will not necessarily be com
ing out of indirect-cost funding, Van Etten
said.
"We've been informed that it was a mis
take," said Cornelius Pings, president of
the Association of American Universities, a
Washington, D.C., organization that has
been working to bring the concerns of uni
versities to the government's attention.
Part of the reason for rescinding the
proposal, Pings said, was that
universities nationwide lobbied
the government, arguing that
the cuts would cause consider
able damage to their research
programs.
Despite their apparent suc
cess, universities still remain
concerned about the future of
indirect cost funding.
"The administration did not
impose cuts, and that is a posi
tive change. But it doesn't mean
they won't engage in other forms
of cuts to expand the cap on
administrative costs," said Mil
ton Goldberg, the president of
the Council on Government
Relations, an association of
research universities that watch
es federal regulations.
Administrative costs is one
area within indirect costs that
has been more specifically exam
ined for reduction.
Also, while this specific pro
posal was defeated, the idea of
putting more limits of indirect
cost spending has not disap
peared, said Jeff Carr, the direc
tor of government relations at
Vanderbilt University.
"There are amendments that
have not yet been adopted," Carr

said. For example, he said, this
year one senator proposed a cap
of 50 percent on all indirect
costs.
Also, Carr said Vanderbilt is
concerned about upcoming con
gressional appropriation discus
sions because they always dis
cuss indirect costs.
Due to the uncertainty of
future current regulations, Van
derbilt is still maintaining a par
tial hiring freeze they enacted
when they first learned of the
proposed cuts, which would have
cost them $5 million a year.
"The administration thinks
that simply by enacting an arbi
trary cap, they can save money.
But they're wrong, because the
university has to pick up the
costs," which hurts research,
Carr said.
Goldberg said the government
is also ignoring the fact that rais
ing the number of regulations
generates more the administra
tive costs which are funded by
indirect costs. "The administra
tion needs to look at the fact that
it is creating the problem," he
said.
Pings said that there are
"early signs that there's not
going to be much change" from
the Bush administration's posi
tion on indirect costs, which had
been tough on universities
because of scandals over the last

few years concerning inappropri
ate indirect cost charges. Stan
ford, for instance, was accused of
charging the government for a
yacht and for antiques in the
University president's house.
"This is a busy time for any
new administration," said Peter
Smith, the director of public
affairs for the Association of
American Universities. "[lndi
rect costs] are just in the queue
somewhere."
The administration still has to
look at the hundreds of regula
tions that were formulated in the
last few weeks of the Bush
administration; those regula
tions were temporarily frozen
when Clinton took office.
Reviewing those will take
some time, Smith said, adding
that the government may be
waiting to publish them all
together rather than let them
come out piecemeal.
In the meantime, though, the
government has been "quite
open and accessible" on indirect
cost issues, he said.
And while the extent of indi
rect-cost funding is uncertain,
Van Etten said the University is
encouraged by the administra
tion's support of direct funding
for university research. "We
need direct funding first, and
then indirect costs follow," he
said.
