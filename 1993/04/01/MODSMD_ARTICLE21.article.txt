## Ayn irksome protest 
### 
Anti-Earth Day activity
destructive and ignores
environmental realities

THEY'VE GOT TO BE jok
ing. The Stanford chapter of
the Ayn Rand Society, that
is.
The local branch of this organi
zation is planning to hold a
counter-demonstration to Earth
Day, decrying the predominant
atmosphere of environmental con
cern. Though its promoters state
that their mission is merely to
raise debate on the issue of envi
ronmental precautions, concerns
and prerogatives, the short-sight
edness and ignorance sure to be
spread by this event will undoubt
edly have a destructive effect.
Although the upcoming protest
sounds as ludicrous as a drive to
imprison Mother Theresa, it is real
and somewhat disturbing. Misin
formation is one of the greatest
obstacles any group or organiza
tion must overcome, and the Ayn
Rand Society will undoubtedly
play the demagogue's hand in its
Earth Day diatribes.
The Ayn Rand Society follows
its namesake's belief that values
should only be measured and
determined by their impact on the
material well-being of humans. As
such, it reflexively opposes regula
tions that protect animal habitats
as opposed to jobs, as in the Ore
gon spotted-owl situation. In this
and other cases, protecting these
jobs is merely a governmental sub
sidy for an industry that would
wither if left to the free-market
policies that the Society endorses.
In this and other situations, the
Society's anti-environmental posi
tions are both wasteful and belie
their broader economic stances.
An observer of the Ayn Rand
Society gets the impression it is
engaging in this bizarre ballet of
boobishness as an attention-getting

device. Flyers like "Environmental
ism Kills" and "Please DO NOT
Recycle" seize viewers' attention,
even if their arguments have no
substance beyond a superficial
level. But urging people not to recy
cle, even if it is occasionally eco
nomically unsound, is malicious.
"Waste today, pay tomorrow,"
should be the slogan of the Soci
ety's efforts.
As Sam Rayburn once said, it
takes a carpenter to build a barn,
but any old jackass can kick it
down.
Many of the anti-environmental
arguments made by the group are
easily rebuttable. Their stance
that recycling is a waste of effort,
as it merely renews substances
that are in vast supply anyway,
ignores the fact that although
many raw materials are indeed
abundant, we are depleting these
resources at a rate that will even
tually lead to their disappearance.
However, the Ayn Rand Soci
ety's actions may indeed raise a
few matters worthy of discussion.
For instance, a balance must
always be struck between environ
mental demands and economic
concerns. In addition, the univer
sal acceptance of many "sacred
cows" should also be a matter of
debate. But RECYCLING? Or the
value of frugality over wasteful
ness? The only means through
which the group will be able to
make a case for their stances on
these issues is through manipula
tion or ignorance of basic facts.
If the Society is as eager to hold
a consciousness-raising event as it
appears to be, it should attempt to
raise debate over a topic that does
not pit greed and ignorance against
intelligence and worthy sacrifice.
Stanford students are smart
enough to know that despite what
they might hear from the Foun
tainheads, environmental concern
and regulations are prudent.
Meanwhile, the Ayn Rand Soci
ety has only a few more weeks in
which to organize its anti-Mother's
Day protest.
