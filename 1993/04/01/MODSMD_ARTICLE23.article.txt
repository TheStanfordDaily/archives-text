## Why have a speech code? 
### 
Sticks and stones will break
my bones but names will never hurt
me.
This is one of the most ridiculous
and destructive things we hear as kids.
But, after a whole life of being social
ized by a racist, sexist and homophobic
cultural model — which states that you
have the right to freedom of speech and
names don't hurt — you come to Stan
ford and find out that "words do hurt."
Instead of having an orientation pro
gram, class, seminar or workshop explor
ing how specific language functions to
support the dominant logic of thought,
we get a Speech Code.
This code says some things are just
wrong, and if you say them you might get
expelled.
This is a typical band-aid solution to
the problem. It's like having a desegrega
tion decision without supplementing it
with a program that teaches why segre
gation is wrong and why it existed in the
first place.
I resent the Speech Code's method of
dealing with the problem, not because I
feel I have been robbed of my First-
Amendment privileges, but because now
we can't ever have any meaningful and
candid discussions about any "volatile"
issues.
I don't know about you, but I would
much rather hear someone come out and
say, "Well, I don't think Ivy League

schools should lower their standards for
niggers" than have them believe in this
statement but instead say, "Well, I'm not
sure quotas helping African-Americans
are constitutional."
You tell me which of the conversa
tions resulting from each of these state
ments would really enlighten this per
son's views on his or her own internal
racism.
I think Res Ed should sponsor a
series of "talk-outs." They should give
students an opportunity to say what
they feel candidly and openly, and then
give specific groups an opportunity to
clear up misconceptions and stereo
types.
Most importantly, we should explore
how these ideas have originated in histo
ry and how they function to maintain a
homeostasis in our current cultural
model.
For example, in the P.C. climate, we
would have a symposium on "Racial
Issues in a White-Dominated Society."
Here, the oppressed whine about victim
hood while not-so-liberal whites can't say
anything because straight white males
are seen as the root causes of everyone
else's misery.
What I am suggesting is a more inclu
sive approach. I think we should focus on
racial role allocations and the complexi
ties facing all groups. This isn't saying
that whites are victims too, but it is say

ing we are all part of this mess, and all
need to be part of the solution.
Race is a social construction, and it is
culturally instituted categories that regu
late our behavior and not inherent racism
that needs to be unlearned.
Now I understand Res Ed wants to
have the Rainbow Coalition smiling and
holding hands, and something like a
"talk-out" — which would require brutal
honesty — could be ugly at first. Howev
er, with careful planning and qualified
facilitators, more good than bad would
come out of it.
I truly believe this is what learning is
all about. We shouldn't create an atmo
sphere of fear in which people are simply
written off as racist, sexist or homopho
bic because they subscribe to the domi
nant ideology.
We should encourage people to speak
their minds in a challenging but con
structive environment, in dorms, class
rooms, rallies, discussions, wherever. It
is only at the times when we are chal
lenged — and our beliefs and knowledge
are tested — that we grow and learn.

Kwame Yao Anku encourages feedback
from his friends at Res Ed about a "talk
out" series this quarter.
