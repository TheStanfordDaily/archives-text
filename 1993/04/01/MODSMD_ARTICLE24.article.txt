Basketball team inspires spirit of competition in fans

NOW I KNOW what it's like.
Thanks to the Stanford women's
basketball team I now know what
it means to love basketball they way my
father loves basketball. I now know
what my father feels when he watches
basketball.
He feels empowered, a word that was
just jargon until I felt it watching the
Stanford women.
Growing up with a sportswriter
father, I've always been a basketball fan.
Not being athletic, and being a girl, my
father never spent much time explaining
the game to me.
But I always liked watching and
picked up what I needed to know over
the years. First we watched the Bulls.
Then, with the advent of ESPN and
other cable sports channels, I was
introduced to March Madness in a big
way.
I remember clearly the moment at
which, at the age of 16 or 17, after a
marathon six hours of NCAA tourna
ment-watching, I recognized defense
patterns for the first time and spent
30 minutes yelling, "Zone!" and "Man
to-man!" (OK, so I'm not a sophisticat-

Ed fan. I've always been more interest
ed in the personalities that players
exhibit on the floor and the offensive
moves.)
I learned to love the spectacle of the
game, the feats and the style. It was a
fun sport, faster-paced than baseball and
more complicated and individualized (to
my eyes) than football.
I lived in Atlanta for two years after
college, the height of my Atlanta Hawks
fanaticism coinciding with the
Hawks/Celtics series of 1988. I learned
everything about competition. I learned
what it meant to want it. God I wanted
it. And I loved 'Nique, Doc, Spud and
Fat Cliff Livingston (whose daily eating
feats were chronicled in local newspa
pers) even more when they lost the
series (something I learned about grow
ing up in Chicago).
But only this year, watching the
incredible Val Whiting, Rachel Hemmer,
Chris MacMurdo, Kate Paye, Christy
Hedgpeth (I saw her once on campus,
even!), Anita Kaplan, Angela Taylor,
Bobbie Kelsey, lowan Molly Goodenbour
(who always makes me wonder if she
adjusted from the six-player lowa-rules

basketball I watched while in college in
Grinnell, Iowa) and the rest, do I under
stand what being a basketball fan is
truly about.
It's about heroes who aren't just
heroes because they do something great,
but also because they share something
with you.
In other words, they make me glad
I'm a woman.
It's about power. It's about living life.
It's truly the most joyous celebration
I've ever seen. It is what can be done,
what women are capable of doing.
I've never been a spectator at an
event which showcases women's power
and confidence and skill this way. Where
women were taken this seriously and
their power and skills enjoyed with so
much enthusiasm.
Basketball has always seemed to me
to be an exclusively male arena. I'd
never seen a "serious" game of women's
basketball before I arrived at Stanford.
I'd never seen this kind of confidence,
joy and ability in women players. Never
seen this kind of teamwork, involve
ment, personality. It's more than the
winning (though that's always nice).

Now I get it: what makes my father,
an incredibly reserved, almost silent
man, explode with joy when watching
basketball. It gets inside you to watch
them play.
You feel like you're part of it some
how. Empowerment.
Watching the team play makes me
feel good with that depth of feeling
which I know means when this season is
over and I've left Stanford (along with
seniors Val, Molly, Chris and Angela) I
will not only miss it, I'll long for it. It's a
good kind of longing, though, longing
that never lets you forget how good it
was, how good you had it for a while.
So this Stanford woman and Stanford
women's basketball fan wants to say
thanks to the team (in one of those
sports-fan pieces which can just make
wild claims about the beauty of the sport
and superhuman value of the players
without explaining these statements —
I've' always wanted to write one).
Thanks for deepening my apprecia
tion of the sport, and teaching me a late
lesson in empowerment I will never for
get.
