# Stanford must protect itself from prospective hooligans and rioters
## 
### 
Next year Stanford will proudly host
the 1994 World Cup, the most popular
sporting event in the world.
During the first round of the compe
tition, the teams of four countries will
compete against one another here at
Stanford.
Along with these four teams, their
fans will travel to Stanford from their
home countries.
Unfortunately, the fans of some

teams, such as England, are known for
their rowdy, destructive behavior,
including violence against person and
property, generally loutish behavior and
all-around trouble-making.
The presence of these primitive
types, known as hooligans, could cause
serious damage of many sorts here at
Stanford, and would necessitate an
extreme degree of security measures to
prevent any lasting damage.
The University administration
should immediately take any and all
actions within its power to ensure the
four teams sent here are not those
associated with violent fan behavior.
Stanford should act now to prevent

hordes of barbarians from descending
upon us.
