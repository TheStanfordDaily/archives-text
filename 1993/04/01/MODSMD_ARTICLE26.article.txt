# Gas-centric sororities defy water-based laws of medieval groupings
## 
### 
I have one thing to say: Helium!
In medieval agrarian societies, an
entire village might arise near a source
of water. At the center of a small farm
ing community one would expect to find

a well â€” supplying water for humans
and animals to drink, for bathing and
for smithing.
Here on our campus, a small village
of tents has arisen on Wilbur field. It's
called "Sorority Rush." And do you
know what is at the center of this small
village? A well? Have they gathered
about a source of water? NO! At the cen
ter of this small village is a helium trac
tor, dispensing gas. Gas, which is essen
tial for filling up small, colored balloons,
for promoting high-pitched giggling and
for setting make-up.
This is truly amazing.
