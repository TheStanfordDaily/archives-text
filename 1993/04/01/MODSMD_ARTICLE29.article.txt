## Fencers can't shift gears in Motor City Lose close matches early, finish ninth at NCAA meet 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff writer 
The most disappointing defeats are not the ones
lost by a large margin, but those lost by only a small
one. Last week, the Stanford fencing team learned
this lesson the hard way at the NCAA Champi
onships in Detroit.
Both the men's and women's foil teams lost key
matches by touch differences, which meant a ninth
place overall finish for the squads, instead of a top
three showing.
"Men's foil was my biggest frustration," men's
coach Zoran Tulum said. "There were two round
robin brackets and we were in the bracket with the
best teams."
Adversity is nothing new to the Cardinal squad,
whose sabre team won the Western Regionals last
month, but lost out on an automatic bid to the NCAA
team tournament because of West-Coast fencing pol
itics.
"There were a lot of things we couldn't do any
thing about," said sabre team-captain Glenn Wong,
who placed 10th in the country in his final NCAA
appearance. "For me, the biggest disappointment
was not having my sabre team there."
Despite the difficulties, the squad had its best
showing ever at the NCAA tourney, with an eighth
place finish by the women and a fifth-place finish by
the men. Overall, the team's point total placed it
ninth, while four of its members earned Ail-Ameri
can status.
"Five touches were the difference between ninth
and third place," Tulum said. "Sometimes even one
touch makes a big difference."
The Cardinal came out and upset two perennial
powers in collegiate fencing, Penn State's men and
Notre Dame's women.
"We beat Notre Dame, a powerhouse, and we were
really surprised," said Tulum about the women's
tournament performance. "We lost against Penn and
Yale on touch differences and placed eighth overall.
The odds of losing like that are a million to one. We
fenced very well, but didn't have that little bit of
luck."
That little bit of luck kept the women from earn
ing another victory.
"We earned top-eight by beating Notre Dame,
then lost to Penn State," said Morgan Hoch, who
earned 19th place in the women's foil. "We tied Penn
and Yale 8-8 and went down on touches. That was
disappointing because I thought we were a better

team than both of them."
The men had similar problems with a low seeding
and a heartbreaking loss to Yale.
"We beat Penn State in the first round," Tulum
explained. "We crushed Illinois, then we tied Yale in
everything but touches received. We were so hot and
Nick (Bravin) led our team like a champion. If any of
my fencers had scored only one more touch we would
have been in the finals."
After the loss, the men entered the consolation
round and finished at the top.
"In the past, the team felt that we couldn't win
and that carried over to me," said Bravin, who led the
foil team with his third NCAA individual title. "In
the past they had a pessimistic attitude, but this year
we felt we could beat anyone. We walked to fifth place
after [the Yale loss]. We had a little bit of a lapse."
Bravin earned first-team Ail-American honors for
the third time in his last performance for the Cardi
nal.
"It was different than in the past because every
one expected me to win," Bravin said. "It was more of

a relief than anything [to win]."
Other individual achievements included an 11th
place finish by senior Lana Kang, also competing for
the last time for Stanford. Teammate Hoch finished
19th overall, while Geoff Donaker earned a 10th
place in men's foil. Donaker and Kang also earned
All-American honorable mention honors.
One outstanding accomplishment was the perfor
mance of Wong, who came from Tulum's physical
education classes with no prior fencing experience to
captain the sabre team and earn All-American hon
orable mention.
"My performance says a lot about the coaching,"
Wong said. "I owe Zoran a lot."
Indeed, the work of Tulum and women's coach
Sherry Posthumus has done much to bring
respectability to the Stanford fencing program. With
out the benefit of scholarships or even a University
budget, the Cardinal has broken into the top 10
among fencing schools in the country, a tribute to the
hard work and dedication of both the coaches and
their pupils.
