A student who plummeted from the sev
enth floor of an Escondido Village highrise
Sunday remains at Stanford Hospital with
internal injuries and multiple leg frac
tures, said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Police have not yet determined whether
the student — who is being kept on a psy
chiatric hold at the hospital for observation
— fell or jumped from the Hoskins apart
ment building.
"A couple of people had reported that
while studying, a person or body came fly
ing by their windows," Niemeyer said. "It

sounds funny, but it's not."
Stanford Police received a call Sunday
evening about "suspicious circumstances"
around the building. When police reached
Hoskins, Niemeyer said, they found a stu
dent lying at the foot of the building in the
mulch and dirt area.
According to Hoskins resident Jyoti
Rahi, the man struck the railing of an
apartment on the sixth floor before landing
in gravel on the east side of the building.
When paramedics arrived on the scene,
Niemeyer said the injured student was con
scious and able to talk. Police would not re
lease the student's name.
