### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
A student who plummeted from the sev
enth floor of an Escondido Village highrise
Sunday remains at Stanford Hospital with
internal injuries and multiple leg frac
tures, said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Police have not yet determined whether
the student — who is being kept on a psy
chiatric hold at the hospital for observation
— fell or jumped from the Hoskins apart
ment building.
"A couple of people had reported that
while studying, a person or body came fly
ing by their windows," Niemeyer said. "It

sounds funny, but it's not."
Stanford Police received a call Sunday
evening about "suspicious circumstances"
around the building. When police reached
Hoskins, Niemeyer said, they found a stu
dent lying at the foot of the building in the
mulch and dirt area.
According to Hoskins resident Jyoti
Rahi, the man struck the railing of an
apartment on the sixth floor before landing
in gravel on the east side of the building.
When paramedics arrived on the scene,
Niemeyer said the injured student was con
scious and able to talk. Police would not re
lease the student's name.

Police would not release the
student's name.
Rahi said the man did not
live in Hoskins but could have
easily gotten to the balcony on
the seventh floor from a stair
well.
No suicide note was found,
Niemeyer said, and Stanford
Police are still investigating the
case to determine the circum

stances surrounding the fall or
jump.
Niemeyer recalled several
previous incidents where stu
dents attempted to jump or did
jump from buildings on cam
pus. Police and counselors have
successfully "talked down" two
potential jumpers, another sur
vived the attempted suicide and
one died.
In the late 19605, one person
jumped off of the top of Hoover
Tower and died.
Grating was installed at the
top of the tower after the inci
dent, Niemeyer said.
