# NIT final:
## Minnesota tops Bulldogs 62-61 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Madison Square Garden was
half-full and most basketball fans were half-interested.
That didn't matter to Georgetown and Minnesota
on Wednesday night as the two teams played a cham
pionship-caliber game that went down to the buzzer
in the NIT final. The Gophers came away with a 62-
61 victory.
The win brought a sense of redemption to the
Golden Gophers (22-10), a team that felt snubbed
when it was passed over for an NCAA berth three last
month.
"We used this tourney to send a message to the
people that we are a good team, that we were over
looked by the NCAAs and we felt that the NIT was a
perfect place to showcase our abilities," said tourna
ment most valuable player Voshon Lenard.
That doesn't mean Minnesota was playing solely to
impress the folks in the NCAAs. Quite the contrary,
the Gophers went through the NIT treating it with
respect and made the best of the situation they found
themselves in.
By Wednesday night, coach Clem Haskins said his
team was happy with the way things worked out.
"This more than makes up for it. To me it's a mis
sion accomplished. It's been a great experience for us
and we're going to use it as a springboard for next
year."
Arriel McDonald led the Gophers (22-10) with 20
points, 14 in the second half. Lenard auded 17 points
on 6-for-9 shooting. Harrington led Georgetown (20-
13) with 17 points and Joey Brown had 14.
Freshman forward Duane Spencer was ejected
with 15:15 left for punching Minnesota center Chad
Kolander in the neck. The incident spurred a 19-6 run
that ended with Minnesota ahead 62-51 with 4:27 left
on McDonald's 8-foot jumper. Those, however, would
be the Gophers' last points.
Georgetown stepped up its defensive intensity and
forced Minnesota into several turnovers and poor
shots. Harrington's free throw with 1:41 left cut the
score to 62-61, and when Randy Carter missed two
free throws for Minnesota with 24.3 seconds left,
Georgetown rebounded and set up for a last shot.
Sophomore Kevin Millen missed a 15-foot jumper
from the wing with three seconds left, but Minnesota
batted the ball out of bounds with the clock reading 0.4.
Georgetown tried lobbing the ball inbounds to
Harrington underneath the basket.
"We were trying to curl Othella around to the bas
ket, but they knew the only place we could go was
inside for a tip," Thompson said.
"We wanted to make sure they got no lobs," said
Lenard, a sophomore shooting guard who peaked in
the NIT, finishing with 17 points against the Hoyas.
"We wanted to clog up the middle, and that's what we
did."
