# Preseason baseball tragedy brings out game's humanity
## 
### 
This spring, millions of fans will
flock to stadiums across the coun
try to watch their Yankees, Twins,
White Sox or Marlins take the field in the
annual ritual of baseball's Opening Day.
Families will come, as they have for years
on end, to participate in the playing of
America's pastime, and perhaps for a
time, they will be able to forget the wor
ries of the bustling world at the home of
grass, hot dogs and the umpire's growl.
But for two families, there will be no
such escape to the baseball diamond. One
awful night in Florida robbed them of hus
bands and fathers, and robbed baseball's
spring training of its innocence and bloom.
The deaths of Cleveland Indians pitchers
Steve Olin and Tim Crews marked the
first fatalities in the major leagues since
Aug. 2, 1979, and the shock wave quickly
spread across the nation. For the first time
in over 13 years, the nation's cheering
gave way to a stunned silence.
I remember that August day some
years ago when Thurman Munson, one of
my favorite players on my favorite team,
died in a plane crash on the way home to
his family in Ohio. At eight years old,

baseball was a larger-than-life spectacle
of batting averages, pennant races and
immortal heroes to me, and Thurman's
death was a brutal lesson in the reality
behind the hero. Baseball would never be
the same to me again.
Fortunately, America was spared that
sense of loss for more than a decade, and
baseball once again became the home for
heroes. Reg-gie. Steve Garvey. Nolan
Ryan. Mattingly. Clemens. Canseco and
McGwire. Rickey Henderson. Bonds.
True, America gets older and more cyn
ical with every passing day, but for some
reason baseball is different. As in Field of
Dreams, when they throw out the first
pitch of spring, people will come, some

times without knowing exactly why. We
scrutinize our team's statistics to predict
its winning chances, we take bets on how
long the contract holdouts will last, we
prognosticate on who will be traded where
and we definitely, absolutely argue each
and every bad call the umpire makes.
In some ways, baseball is a national
therapy, a brief respite from corrupt
politicians, gridlock traffic, 9-to-5 low
paying jobs and the bleakness of the
evening news. For a few hours on a Sat
urday or Sunday afternoon, it all comes
down to us vs. them, the crack of the bat,
the smell of the dust and grass, and pop
corn vendors making their way up and
down the rows. We leave our problems on
the other side of the stadium walls — in
short, death belongs in the streets of the
inner city, not in the sports pages.
Olin and Crews' deaths reminded us
that behind the fanfare, the spectacular
highlight film, the multimillion-dollar
contract, and the media hype are real peo
ple with real lives. To them, the game is
their job, but it certainly isn't their life.
More importantly, they are heroes to the
families they come home to every night.
It seems ironic that Olin and Crews

were on an outing with their families
when their fatal accident occurred —
they and the family of Bob Ojeda opted
not to join the team at Disney World, but
instead to drive out to Lake Nellie for a
barbeque, horseback riding and some
fishing. These days with the family, and
not the nine-inning contests at Cleve
land's Municipal Stadium, were surely
the happiest times in the lives of Tim
Crews and Steve Olin.
At the endless press conferences held
following Olin and Crews' deaths, it was
difficult to understand the depth of their
families' grief. Cleveland lost two of its
most promising young pitchers, men who
were sure to have a large impact on the
club's winning chances in 1993, but this
meant nothing compared to the personal
tragedy felt by the family, friends and
teammates of the killed ballplayers. Patti
Olin will never sleep in the same bed with
her husband again. Tim Crews' children
are now without a father. That is enough
to stop the roar of the ballpark crowd for
a moment, and to bring our attention to
the humanity behind the game.
In the midst of Final-Four Fever, the
upcoming basketball and hockey playoffs

and the much-heralded start of baseball
season, we should not forget the people
behind the hype. Unlike most of us, these
players are forced to do their jobs under
the watchful eyes of millions of fans,
reporters and TV commentators, and
often we assume they are simply what we
see on TV or read in the paper. Tim
Crews and Steve Olin were up-and-com
ing pitchers for the Cleveland Indians,
but they were also more. The tears of
friends, family, the Indians' management
and their fans are a testament to that.
Today, Municipal Stadium is quiet.
Until Opening Day on Monday, the seats
will be empty and the scoreboard remains
dark. The pitcher's mound stands alone on
a patch of neatly manicured grass, awaiting
the first pitch of the 1993 season. Before
that pitch is delivered, however, there will
be one more time when the stands, the
dugouts and loudspeakers will fall silent.
Perhaps then we will understand how our
hero is first a husband, a father and a
friend, and how that husband, father and
friend can be a hero.
