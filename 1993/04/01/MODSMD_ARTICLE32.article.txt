# Sailors find success coast to coast
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
One coast was not enough for the Cardinal
sailors, as they worked the winds on both the
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans last week.
The team divided to turn in strong perfor
mances in Bodega Bay, Calif, in the North Series 6
and 7 regattas, while also competing well in Nor
folk, Va. at the Old Dominion University Team
Racing Invitational.
The team also put in a good effort in the Trux
ton-Umsted Regatta and the St. Mary's Women's
Intersectional Regatta, both in Maryland, when
they began their sailing week on the East Coast the
weekend of March 21.
Most impressive was the team's win in the
North Series 6 last Saturday, when Stanford's sec
ond team beat Berkeley's best in Bodega Bay.
While Stanford's best sailors were in the East,
skipper Gretchen Uznis with crewmate Jeremy
Hinman and skipper Rolf Kaiser with crewmate
Polly Brown took the helm and led Stanford to an
upset win in their division.
Skipper Leo Sommaripa with crewmate Liz
Clabaugh and skipper Cinnamon Hampikian with
crewmate Andrew Forster sailed for a third place
in their division to seal the Saturday win.
"No one expected us to do well, but we went over
there and kicked some Cal butt," Kaiser said. "It
must have been really humiliating for their top
sailors to get beaten by a bunch of freshmen and
sophomores." •
Meanwhile, on the East Coast, the top sailors
for the 12th-ranked Cardinal squared off against
seven of the nation's top-20 teams at the ODU
Team Racing Intersectional and came away with a

respectable fifth-place finish.
Tufts, Navy, St. Mary's of Maryland and College
of Charleston, ranked Nos. 2, 8, 5 and 6, respec
tively, took the top-four spots.
Stanford's boats were manned by skipper
Charles Meade and crewmate Mary Kussmaul,
skipper Scott Sellers and crewmate Britt Johnson,
and skipper John Emory with Sibyl Diver and
Katherine Chen alternating as crewmates.
On March 20-21, the Cardinal turned in a sev
enth-place finish in the Truxton-Umsted Regatta.
Navy, Tufts and Hawaii took the top-three spots in
what was by far the most competitive regatta of the
year, according to Stanford sailing coach Blake
Middleton.
Sellers with Johnson and Emory with Chen took
11th and ninth in their divisions, respectively,
while junior Jeremy Mclntyre and senior Rusty
Lhamon sailed single-handed boats to finish fifth
and 10th respectively.
While the team turned in a solid performance,
the Cardinal's chances were hurt because its best
single-handed sailor, Charles Meade, could not
attend the regatta. Meade would likely have won
his division and might have pushed the team up to
a fourth-place finish, according to team-captain
Emory.
Though themselves important, these Atlantic-
Coast regattas were more valuable to the team
because they allowed the Cardinal to compete
against the best sailors in the country.
"It was good for us overall because we got nine
days of practice with sustained intensity, and it
was good to focus and hone our skills," Emory
said.
"But by the end of the week we were making
mistakes we don't normally make."
