# Taylor educates, edits, economizes
## 
### Nick Kuritzky 
Tim Taylor said graduate school
in economics was "the worst two
years" of his life — so he dropped out.
But four years ago, Taylor came
back to school part time — as a
teacher.
Now he lives a double life as the
popular lecturer for Economics 1
and as the editor of the Journal of
Economic Perspectives.
Though most students usually
see the energetic and popular Tay
lor behind a podium, most of his
time is actually spent as a journalist,
serving as managing editor of the
journal. The publication serves as a
forum for perspectives on a wide
range of economic issues.
Editing articles submitted by
experts explaining their research
and theories, Taylor said his job at
the quarterly journal gives him a
chance to come into contact with
experts in different fields of eco
nomics.
"It's really interesting and fun to
have that kind of interaction with
people, getting them to explain their
argument to me," he said. "I like the
variety of it and plunging into one
thing after another."
Taylor muses about becoming a
full-time journalist, writing busi
ness articles or an economics col
umn for a magazine. Currently, he
writes editorials and opinion
columns for the San Jose Mercury
News about once a week.

But for now, his job leaves him
with enough spare time that he can
serve as "acting assistant lecturer or
something" at Stanford and teach
economics. He remains something
of a legend around campus for both
his early morning jokes and his dif
ficult quizzes during the past four
years of teaching Eicon. 1 for fun.
"Things get pretty hectic," said
Taylor about dual positions as lec
turer and editor. "Towards the end
of the quarter I feel burnt out," he
admitted.
"Teaching is something I do in
my spare time. It is not taking me
anywhere in my career," Taylor
said. "If students didn't like my
teaching, I would quit immediately."
But students definitely like his
teaching style. Taylor consistently
cuases the 500-seat Kresge Audito
rium to overflow for 9 a.m. classes,
and over the past four years, more
than 93 percent of his students have
rated him as "excellent."
Freshman Jerry Chen said Tay
lor is "engaging, someone who
makes exciting what is potentially a
very dull subject."
Taylor makes a point of keeping
his students' attention by storing
jokes and funny quotes on his com
puter. "There is a little bit of show
business" in teaching, he explained.
"You could be a good caring, con
cerned person, but in a really big
class, it is hard to make this clear. If
you are outgoing and make it fun,
students are willing to meet you

half way."
Taylor's antics include handing
out buttons at the end of each quar
ter. He got the idea after the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake, when
many people began wearing para
phernalia reading "I survived Loma
Prieta." So Taylor gave his students

buttons which said, "I survived Tim
Taylor's class."
Each year he puts a different slo
gan on the buttons. Last quarter's
buttons read "Taylor talked. Stiglitz
walked (to Washington)." They
refer to the fact that Economics
Prof, and Hoover Institution Senior
Fellow Jay Stiglitz, who was sup

posed to co-teach the class with Tay
lor, was named to President Clin
ton's Council of Economic Advisors
and was unable to give a single lec
ture.
Taylor's class is not intended just
for economics majors. It is designed
to be open to any student. His goal is
for every student leaving his class to
be able to "read the Wall Street
Journal or Business Week."
But, Taylor warns that eco
nomics is not necessarily the major
of choice for future MBA's. "A lot of
people want to take economics
because they want to be business
men one day,"he said. "I think that
is generally a mistake. You should
take a few courses and make sure
you have got a base in other things.
"The difference between a busi
nessman and an economist is the
difference between a chauffeur and
a mechanic," he laughed. "Business
people drive things. Economists
look under the hood."
Taylor said he steers his stu
dents through introductory eco
nomics while staying clear of polit
ical extremes. He says his teaching
is not slanted towards either the
political right or the left. In class,
he tries to give the mainstream
view.
But in between the economic
problems and forecasts comes Ta)f
lor's jokes: "Economists are the
crystal ball gazers of our society;
they have predicted nine of the last
four recessions."
