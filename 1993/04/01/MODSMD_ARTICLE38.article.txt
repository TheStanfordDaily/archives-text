# How misconduct cases are handled
## 
### 
When a case of student mis
conduct — involving the Fun
damental Standard, Honor
Code or Policy on Campus Dis
ruption — is reported to Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole,
she determines whether there is
enough evidence to accuse the
student or drop the case.
An accused student is con
fronted with the charge and
then has two options.
The student can choose to
accept the charge, thus keeping
the case within the Dean of Stu
dents' office. The dean then
looks at whether there were
extenuating circumstances and
recommends a penalty to Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper.
If the student chooses to
deny the charge, the case is
given to an off-campus attorney

who comes to a conclusion based
on the evidence of whether the
University has met its burden of
proof — beyond a reasonable
doubt — that the student violat
ed a campus policy.
The attorney then submits a
non-binding recommendation to
the Stanford Judicial Council,
comprised of 11 student and fac
ulty members. The council then
evaluates the facts to determine
whether there was a policy vio
lation. This body, if it deter
mines guilt, also looks into
extenuating circumstances and
past history before recommend
ing penalties to Casper.
All of the processes are confi
dential, and nothing but a year
ly summary of cases — which
does not include any student
names — is released.
