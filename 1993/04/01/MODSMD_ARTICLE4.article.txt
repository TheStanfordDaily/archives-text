# Cheating cases prompt re-examination of Honor Code
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
While many administrators and facul
ty members as well as some students say
they support the Honor Code — which
bars professors from proctoring exams
and provides only vague guidelines for
student conduct — recent reports of
cheating have called into question just
how effective the code may be.
Stanford's Honor Code has come under
scrutiny as allegations surfaced regarding
possible cheating in three of last quarter's
finals. According to Cole, students came
forward in Geophysics 4 and Philosophy
5B — a CIV course — claiming that one or
more students who took the finals early

gave out information before the regularly
scheduled final.
In the third case, a student using a false
name and fake student identification
number took the Molecular Biology 119
final early.
Despite these problems, several profes
sors said they feel the Honor Code serves
an important and necessary purpose on
campus.
'Two-sided responsibility*
Values, Technology, Science and Soci
ety Prof. Robert McGinn said he feels the
code "is a valuable asset to the Stanford
education" that creates a "two-sided re
sponsibility" for both the students and
the faculty.

"The faculty have obligations not to
create too overly tempting situations,"
where students might cheat, he said,
while at the same time presuming student
honesty. Students, meanwhile, are oblig
ated not to cheat.
"People who cheat on a CIV final would
have to be not very civilized," McGinn
added.
Biology Prof. Robert Schimke, who at
tended Stanford as an undergraduate,
echoed McGinn's feelings.
"I appreciated the Honor Code then
and now — it is better for learning and in
teraction. We (the professors] are not here
to proctor," he said.
"It is unfortunate and discouraging to
both students and faculty when cheating

happens, as they are doing a disservice to
both themselves and the entire Universi
ty," Schimke added.
But students bound by the code gave a
more mixed review.
Sophomore Adam McGinty said he
thought the absence or presence of a code
had questionable effect on cheating.
"I don't fully understand the process
but I know that you don't have to be a
legal genius to understand what cheating
is," McGinty said. "I think students do
what is right or wrong due to their char
acter and how they were raised."
For example, McGinty said he saw two
students "blatantly" cheating in an In
dustrial Engineering 133 final last year.
He didn't turn in the individuals because

he "knew one of the students and the kind
of person he was and it would just turn
into my word against his."
Freshman Gaby Di Muro said she be
lieves that the Honor Code is less effective
than it might be because it is not stressed
enough at Stanford. She contrasted the
University's policy to the University of
Virginia's, which emphasizes its honor
code on tours it gives to prospective stu
dents.
Virginia, which punishes honor code vi
olators with expulsion, devotes a great
deal of time to student education and feed
back regarding its 151-year-old honor code
— including having an honor educator in
every dorm.
And senior Howie Sesso said he
feels that — while the code's inten
tions are good — the vagueness of
the policy is detrimental to what it is
trying to accomplish.
"Since the Honor Code is open to
interpretation, some people take it
seriously and some don't," he said.
Effective code, faulty process
Cole said she felt the fact that
Stanford's Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code are "vague and
overbroad" in defining misconduct
is beneficial in that this "challenge
students to define acts for them
selves."
Cole pointed to students' report
ing of Honor Code violations in two
of three alleged incidents during last
quarter's finals as evidence that the
code, adopted in 1921, is effective.

In the past two years, there have
been nearly 40 Honor Code viola
tions. While Cole said that the num
ber of student conduct cases han
dled so far this year is pretty typical,
she admitted that many cases are
handled within departments with
out being reported to her — or
reported at all.
An increase in reported cheating
has led her to believe students are
either violating student conduct
policies frequently more or are
being less tolerant of those who do.
But while Cole said she felt the
code is effective, she said she
believes the process by which stu
dents accused of violations are
found guilty or innocent needs to be
re-evaluated to give it more "visibil
ity."
Cole said the process is "too
paternalistic" because it is conduct
ed within the administration. Most
cases end up being dealt with in the
Dean of Students office, although
students have the right to go to the
Stanford Judicial Council — a body

comprised of 11 student and faculty
members who evaluate the facts.
It would be more appropriate if
students and faculty had additional
involvement in the process, Cole
said, since she believes the parties
on both sides would be held more
accountable and learn more.
But senior Matt Hall, who once
served on the council, said he does
not believe the system to determine
guilt should be changed. "The SJC
is a committee that makes unbiased
decisions based on the facts it
receives," he said. "It is good that
the process is not publicized."
Cole said the University would
benefit from looking at the ways
other universities make more use of
students and faculty to increase
awareness of student misconduct.
Other schools
One university that also uses a
student-faculty council is UCLA,
which has a student conduct com
mittee composed of two faculty
members, one staff member and

two students. Students appear
before this committee only if they
choose to challenge charges brought
against them by the dean.
UCLA, which proctors its tests,
has no honor code but rather a
statement of "Policies that Apply to
Campus Activities, Organizations
and Students" that explicitly lists
forbidden conduct on its campus,
according to Assistant Dean Mike
Wilding.
Yale University, which also
doesn't have a honor code, requires
every student to know its all-encom
passing Undergraduate Regula
tions. Punishments for violating
these regulations range from a
totally confidential internal repri
mand to probation and, in rare
cases, expulsion.
In the end, Cole said, possible
consequences of the recent allega
tions of cheating may lead to a
review of the practice of giving early
exams. But she also expressed hope
that students and faculty will learn
from these publicized events.
