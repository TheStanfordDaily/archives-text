# Cheating cases prompt re-examination of Honor Code
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
While many administrators and facul
ty members as well as some students say
they support the Honor Code — which
bars professors from proctoring exams
and provides only vague guidelines for
student conduct — recent reports of
cheating have called into question just
how effective the code may be.
Stanford's Honor Code has come under
scrutiny as allegations surfaced regarding
possible cheating in three of last quarter's
finals. According to Cole, students came
forward in Geophysics 4 and Philosophy
5B — a CIV course — claiming that one or
more students who took the finals early

gave out information before the regularly
scheduled final.
In the third case, a student using a false
name and fake student identification
number took the Molecular Biology 119
final early.
Despite these problems, several profes
sors said they feel the Honor Code serves
an important and necessary purpose on
campus.
'Two-sided responsibility*
Values, Technology, Science and Soci
ety Prof. Robert McGinn said he feels the
code "is a valuable asset to the Stanford
education" that creates a "two-sided re
sponsibility" for both the students and
the faculty.

"The faculty have obligations not to
create too overly tempting situations,"
where students might cheat, he said,
while at the same time presuming student
honesty. Students, meanwhile, are oblig
ated not to cheat.
"People who cheat on a CIV final would
have to be not very civilized," McGinn
added.
Biology Prof. Robert Schimke, who at
tended Stanford as an undergraduate,
echoed McGinn's feelings.
"I appreciated the Honor Code then
and now — it is better for learning and in
teraction. We (the professors] are not here
to proctor," he said.
"It is unfortunate and discouraging to
both students and faculty when cheating

happens, as they are doing a disservice to
both themselves and the entire Universi
ty," Schimke added.
But students bound by the code gave a
more mixed review.
Sophomore Adam McGinty said he
thought the absence or presence of a code
had questionable effect on cheating.
"I don't fully understand the process
but I know that you don't have to be a
legal genius to understand what cheating
is," McGinty said. "I think students do
what is right or wrong due to their char
acter and how they were raised."
For example, McGinty said he saw two
students "blatantly" cheating in an In
dustrial Engineering 133 final last year.
He didn't turn in the individuals because

he "knew one of the students and the kind
of person he was and it would just turn
into my word against his."
Freshman Gaby Di Muro said she be
lieves that the Honor Code is less effective
than it might be because it is not stressed
enough at Stanford. She contrasted the
University's policy to the University of
Virginia's, which emphasizes its honor
code on tours it gives to prospective stu
dents.
Virginia, which punishes honor code vi
olators with expulsion, devotes a great
deal of time to student education and feed
back regarding its 151-year-old honor code
— including having an honor educator in
