Monday night, the Academy celebrated
"Women and the Movies." The ver
dict: poor.
If the women in attendance considered
Liza Minnelli's atrocious lip-synching of a
banal Kander & Ebb song a tribute, I've got a
pair of Guess jeans and a push-up bra for

them to squeeze into. Still, the
Oscars merely symbolized
Hollywood's poor track
record of finding roles for
women, before and behind
the camera.

Rather, 1991 was the banner year for
women in film. Barbra Streisand, Martha
Coolidge and Agniezska Holland each directed
a film. Jodie Foster played a driven FBI trainee
in the subtly feminist hit "The Silence of the
Lambs," then turned around and successfully
directed her own film, "Little Man Tate."
But "Thelma and Louise" proved itself the
Zeitgeist film of '91. Scripted by newcomer
Callie Khouri, the film attacked patriarchy
both verbally and physically under Ridley
Scott's powerful direction.
These achievements didn't go unnoticed
by the Academy. Last year's Best Actress race
included Foster, Geena Davis and Susan
Sarandon, making it — unlike this year's no
brainer — too close to call. Khouri won Best
Original Screenplay, and "Silence" swept the
major awards, including Best Picture.
The backlash came soon afterwards. Be
fore Patricia Ireland could shout misogyny,
Rebecca De Mornay tried to kill her female
employer "The Hand That Rocks the Cra
dle." Before Queer Nation could act up, an
omnisexual icepick-wielding Sharon Stone
showed us the true meaning of the term
"money shot," raising her per-picture fee
from the low six figures to a high seven in the
process.
Next, single white females turned psy
chotic and tried to eliminate one another.

Studio executives soon followed suit — in
"Glengarry Glen Ross," "Reservoir Dogs"
and "Hoffa," women couldn't be found with
a magnifying glass. Now, men verbally
abused The Invisible Bitch.

of her time cost just $3,000. Prostitutes
quickly lost their luster after Ken Russell's
"Whore," so regular women joined sex work
ers on the auction block, raising their prices
commensurately.
James Caan's character in "Honeymoon
in Vegas" shelled out 65 grand for a weekend
with Sarah Jessica Parker. Uma Thurman's
character cost just $40,000 in "Mad Dog and
Glory," presumably due to the recession. But
in the upcoming "Indecent Proposal" Demi
Moore plays a real-estate agent who stands
up to the recession and takes a billionaire for
a cool million — for one night of wild sex.
These problems won't be solved with
more women directors. "The Prince of Tides"
facilely portrayed psychoanalysis, and "Ram
bling Rose" stereotyped women as seeking
only love, not sex. Nor will they be solved by
more women writers. A woman wrote "The
Hand That Rocks the Cradle," while a man
wrote "Passion Fish."
Executives don't hold the answer either.
The most powerful woman in Hollywood,
Paramount studio chief Sherry Lansing,
OKed "Indecent Proposal," directed by that
feminist icon of "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Fatal At
traction" fame, Adrian Lyne.
The most immediate solution lies outside
the film industry— vote with your dollar. If I
skipped "Body of Evidence," why can't you? ■
