### 
Phantom of the Opera": it's
a phenomenon, but so is spray
I cheese. True, the spectacle is
stunning, which is good, because the show
sure isn't. Boasting a 15 minute score by
Andrew Lloyd Webber, a book more on
the scale of a three-frame comic strip and

lyrics regularly
bested by a moth
er's kindergarten
class.
The book, or
story, of a musical is

considered to be the most crucial element
of a musical. "Phantom" ranks somewhere
near abysmal, perhaps a bit worse. Nothing
happens.
The Phantom steals Christine. The
Phantom brings her back. The Phantom
steals Christine. The Phantom disappears.
End of show. $65 bucks down the toilet. Go
rent Terminator 2 — the special effects are
better and it only sets you back the cost of
eight phone calls home, not 260.
It probably didn't help that the creators
started with a second-rate pulp novel. Un
fortunately, the few changes they made
weren't for the better. At least the book
ends with the overt death of the Phantom,
assuring us that we won't have to suffer
through a sequel.
Lyricist Charles Hart's contribution
should be congratulated. He somehow
manages to emphasize the worst parts of
Lloyd Webber's pathetic score. His utter
lack of complexity and creativity is truly
unparalleled. When a character in the pro
duction is sad, he oh-so-passionately sings
out "I'm sad."
Take for example the puny melody
called "Wishing You Were Somehow Here
Again" (note the redundant title) —
"Wishing you were somehow here again/
wishing you were somehow near/ some-

Michael DeGusta

times it seems, if I just dream/ somehow
you will be here." Four lines which might
as well be "I miss you, I miss you, I really
miss you, I really really miss you."
For this, Hart garnered a Tony nomina
tion? Luckily Hart lost to Stephen Sond
heim whose "Into the Woods" makes

"Phantom"'s lyrics look
like a children's nursery
rhyme, without the
moral.
Finally, we have the big

gun, composer Andrew
Lloyd Webber. For "Phantom" he com
posed approximately 15 to 20 minutes
worth of music. But if you only show up for
the second act, or have to leave after the
first, don't worry. Either way you'll still get
to hear the score two or three times
through.
Not only do we hear the same music
over and over again, but it's reapplied ran
domly throughout the show. Lloyd Webber
clearly doesn't believe in motifs — themat
ic musical building blocks — or any other
technique that makes the score an integrat
ed part of the show as opposed to just back
ground music.
So why is "Phantom" uncommonly
popular? After running for six years, how
did it report 101.5 percent attendance on
Broadway last week? (If only the New York
Fire Marshall read Variety ...) The answer
— director Harold Prince, who masterfully
recognizes this cheesy trash as what it is and
makes the best of it.
His best solution is the production itself.
Don't ask me why, but in the middle of the
second act, the stage bursts into flames.
Perhaps Prince did it just to prove how
much money the producers were wasting
on this garbage. I regret wasting my money
on it too. Well, that's not entirely true —
it's a great show to hate. ■
