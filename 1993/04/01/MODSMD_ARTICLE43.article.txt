A word of caution: eat a huge dinner be
fore going to Suttirat Anne Larlarb's
"Works from Thailand Exhibition."
Or else resist the temptation of huge
steaming crabs, lush mangoes and numerous
delectable foods staring at you from the canvas.
It's only paint, you know.
Not that Larlarb's work is meant to be a mi
rage of realism. The panoply of surreal desserts
... the elephants which seem to move in a cen
trifugal blur of gray ... are more like an ab
stract oasis of exploding color.
"It's very much a mesh," says Larlarb, who
was awarded a Golden Grant in the Humanities
and Creative Arts through the Office of Under
graduate Research Opportunities last spring,
allowing her to explore Thailand through her
paintings. "There's definitely the perspective of
my Thai background, but in addition to that,
there's the influence of having grown up in
America," added Larlarb, who also was award
ed the Mendelowitz scholarship, an academic
painting award, last year.
Although Larlarb, a senior, returned regularly
to Thailand every other summer until she was
nine, she says it wasn't until her visit his past sum
mer that she was able to "really look from both
eyes, at the air, the architecture, everything.
"I really discovered things about myself and
my family," Larlarb says, adding with a laugh,
"I know that sounds so cliche."
The visual element of Larlarb's final "mesh,"
however, is anything but trite, conveying a
striking web of disparate images gleaned from
Larlarb's personal eye: the exquisite lettering of
a Thai monk against a pale-green chalk board,
the lotus-shaped ear of an elephant from a
training camp, a slice of mango bright enough
to suggest the taste of sunshine.
"She has a very individual way of laying down
the paint," says senior Nick Weber, an artist
who has worked in the same studio as Larlarb
for two years and is this year's Mendelowitz
scholarship recipient. "There's a musicality of
the strokes — they may be quick, thin, slow in
certain places, creating a kind of rhythm. You
can tell that's she's influenced by Van Gogh, an
artist whom she admires."
In addition to the musicality of Larlarb's work,
there is an intensity of lushness, an infusion of

color that is influenced as much by the scenery of
Thailand as by the vivid paintings of Van Gogh.
"In Thailand when you go around the city every
thing is really colorful. Not in a blatant way... like
there's a red building or there's a blue building Not
that way at all, but more like how busy it is, how
crowded it is, how many different people are
around, what they're doing, what they're wearing"
Larlarb's exhibit of black-and-white drawings
alongside paintings infused by powerful yellows,
reds and blues reflects the skyline of Bangkok,

the stark juxtaposi
tion of dark, gray
apartment buildings
with mirrored,
hand-painted tem
ples that usher bril
liance right into the
sky with their prima
ry-colored roofs.
"You have this in
credible shrine of
color right in the
middle of this black
city," Larlarb de
scribes, adding that
the curved, lotus
form of the roofs has
been an underlying
shape in her paint
ings.

"It's in the architecture, the roofs. The way
they reach into the sky like that," she says, trac
ing the lotus-shape in the air. "If you look close,
you can see it in the lines of the elephant, in the
form of a crab. It all goes back to the lotus. I
think it's a very beautiful shape. There's a jaun
ty choppiness to it."
"There seems to be a certain vocabulary of
symbols in her work," Weber says. "She ex
plores certain themes in depth, repeats without
being repetitive. You can even see the strokes of
her shapes in the Thai writing. The writing is an
integral part, relating formally to the painting

as opposed to being superfluous."
One can find the integral beauty of the jaun
ty lotus-shape in the words "Jay and Anne eat
Crab" written in Thai beneath Larlarb's paint
ing of a sumptuous dinner.
"It sounds like the words on this pencil box,"
sap Larlarb, pulling-out a tin box covered by a
cartoon cat and the words, "BIG SMILE.WHY?
DONT CRY CAT," a testament to the absurdi
ties of commercial Asian translation.
"What does that mean? If you're there it makes

sense," Larlarb says."I
would be drawing in my
room in Thailand and
my grandma would
walk in and say, 'Happy
day,' in Thai and it
would make perfect
sense in a certain con
text. But an American
would probably think,
'What's up with that
person? How ran
dom.' "
"I love this pencil
case," continues Lar
larb, explaining her
affinity for its "kitschi
ness" as well as its hid
den cultural connec
tion. "It's like, 'Oh, Jay

and Anne eat Crab, but where are they?' I'm kind
of making fun of it and also bringing it in as a per
vasive part of commercial culture there."
In addition to receiving the Mendelowitz schol
arship, Larlarb has awarded two material grants,
which, she says, have allowed her to experiment
with other paints. "You can see the difference," she
says, pulling out two cans of yellow paint, one with
a slight greenish tinge, and the other more pure, a
brighter cadmium—the yellow of the mangoes in
her painting of a Thai meal.
"In Thailand there isn't the distinction between
breakfast food, lunch food and dinner food; it's all

the same food," says Larlarb as she stands before a
painting. "Here I have a crab, a mango steen and
a mango dish. There's no cereal and bacon."
Whether painted steaming on a plate, or mag
nified to a beautiful abstraction, mango steens
abound in Larlarb's work, and she is effusive in
her description of the unusual Thai fruit.
"It's a really gorgeous fruit," she gushes. "The
leaves have that lotus shape and are very plump
and juicy, so a lot of times people think that's
the fruit. You open it up — it's a purply black
color the size of a pool ball — and cut it in half.
The inside is the format of an orange, but it has
the color and consistency of banana.
" It's not just the mango steen itself that's im
portant to me," Larlarb emphasizes. "But what
it says in a larger sense about Thailand," a
country that is like the fruit, ripe with paradox
and anomaly, a society "vivacious, unsure of it
self and yet fast and progressive."
Diverse facets of Thailand society are reflect
ed in the different backgrounds of Larlarb's
parents: one, very "comfortable, westernized
Bangkok," and the other, "archetypal, rural,
lik«* house-on-stilts-with-rice-paddies.
"The premise of my grant was that I would go
back to Thailand, visit with both sides of my
family and really try to understand the differ
ences, but also the main Thai-ness' that under
scores both [sides] through painting," she says.
"I didn't know what I would come out with.
And as you can see, most of this stuff doesn't
look like my family," she adds, laughing, sur
rounded by mango steens, crabs and elephants.
One can find the "Thai-ness" in even simple
things like food, however, explains Larlarb:
"In Asian countries in general, food is such a
big deal. This is true in the wealthier parts of
Bangkok and also in the countryside where
sleeping and eating are so much a part of daily
life. Food is very important to my family, it's
more than just a social event. You plan every
thing around when you're going to eat."
Considering Larlarb's family comes from the
country that invented Pad Thai and iced coffee,
it's no wonder. ■

"Works from Thailand Exhibition " will be
shown in the basement of the Cummings Art
Building tomorrow from 8 to 11 p.m.
