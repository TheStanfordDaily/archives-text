# SAMPLE
## 
### Janar Stewart 
Imagine minimalist rock guitar riffs, mel
low jazz piano runs and precise drum
ming, woven with a reggae beat.
That's sound of the The Samples, an up
and-coming Colorado band.
Drummer Jeep MacNichol describes
their music as "a mixture of folk, reggae,
rock, ska — a lot of different elements.
Even hip-hop."
But judging solely by "No Room," their
third album, The Samples could be a reincar
nation of The Police, albeit with keyboards.
Or rather — keeping in mind cuts such as
"Suburbia" and "14th and Euclid" off their
album "No Room," and all of Sting's solo
albums — their style exemplifies how The
Police might have sounded if they had
remained together.
But shoving aside the temptation to
compare — exacerbated by several cuts
("Won't Be Back Again," "Another
Disaster," "Pain," "Summertime"),
MacNichol's Stewart Copland-esque
drumming style and Kelly's Sting-like
vocals — The Samples' music leaves ample
space for departing from that stereotype.
In fact, their folksy first release, "The
Samples," along with occasional bursts of
country in cuts like "Seany Boy" and "As
Soon as the Rain Comes," prove that the
band strays enough from the rock-reggae
sound made famous by The Police to be
considered unique.
MacNichol says, "We got our sound

because the four of us listen to completely
different stuff."
According to MacNichol, keyboardist A 1
Laughlin prefers ska and reggae, lead
singer and guitarist Sean Kelly likes
melodies and bassist Andy Sheldon gets
into classical, while he listens to every
thing from Pantera to Bobby Brown.
When the foursome creates the music
"we'll all sort of assert our influences,"
MacNichol explains. It's obvious from listen
ing to "No Room" that four talented musi
cians comprise The Samples. Acoustic gui
tars in "Giants" and "Suburbia" scream clas
sical training, and piano accompaniments
peppered throughout the album hint of jazz.
Also, each musician can play more than just
one instrument — Kelly is proficient in slide
guitar and 12-string as well as lead guitar, and
Sheldon plays bass, guitar and trumpet
Stylistic variety coupled with intense
solos promise that The Samples' concert
this Saturday will be an invigorating,
innovative experience. When playing live,
The Samples stretch four- and five-minute
songs to eight or 10 minutes; everyone
"just kind of like jams," much like jazz
musicians, MacNichol says.
Lyrically, The Samples' songs almost
always speak of sun, rain, animals or
some part of the environment, even
when addressing other subjects.
Before "No Room," critics labeled The
Samples as an eco-band; some felt their
first two albums ("The Samples,"
"Underwater People") were lyrically heavy
on the environmental tip.
So with their third release, the group
made a conscious effort to tone down the
preaching. "We tried to make the lyrics
really nebulous instead of telling people to
do something or not," MacNichol says,
laughing at the thought of people imagin
ing the band members sporting
Birkenstocks and refusing to eat meat.
"We're not all vegetarian or anything,"
he says. "I'm on my way to McDonald's
right now — Taco Bell, actually."
MacNichol suggests the cut "African Ivory"
— about the practice of sawing off the
rhino's horn to save the beast from poachers
— on the band's first album may have misled
the press. He recalls Kelly's simple motive for
writing the song: "[Kelly] saw something on
'National Geographic' that pissed him off."
Beyond nature-oriented lyrics, a collage
inside the cover of "No Room," laden with
clippings that proclaim "2 surviving hors
es in critical condition," "pollution" and
"Whale watcher cruises this way," only
perpetuates their earth-muffin image.
Plus, every part of the CD-package

except for the CD itself was made from
100 percent recycled material.
Greenies? Maybe not. Concerned with
the environment? Undoubtedly.
Yet The Samples have written great songs
that have nothing to do with animal rights
or the ozone layer. "Seany Boy" on "No
Room" caustically pokes fun at people who
attempt to scare a dropout back into school.
Written shortly after Kelly dropped out of
high school, the song is "one of the first tunes
he ever wrote," according to MacNichol.
As to a motive behind the origin of autobi
ographical tune, MacNichol offers, "I guess
his brother gave him a bunch of shit — how
he was never going to amount to anything."
Since their formation in 1987, The
Samples have had several successes.
Not only have they sold more than
100,000 records, but Tuesday night, they
appeared on "The Tonight Show."

The band's humble beginnings originat
ed with a friendship between Kelly and
Sheldon. They then moved from Vermont
to Boulder, Colo. — where they found
MacNichol and Laughlin — to start a band.
"Our keyboardist met [Kelly and Sheldon]
at a party," MacNichol says."I ended up
answering an ad on a bulletin bor rd."

Very into self-promotion, the group
would play gigs and bring self-recordings
to pass out to fans.
Instead of pursuing a series of steps to
stardom — climbing the charts, embark
ing on a hectic touring schedule, appear
ing on MTV's "Unplugged" — The
Samples chose to focus on catering to their
fans, according to MacNichol.
"We don't consciously have a vision" in terms
of filling arenas and then stadiums, MacNichol
says. That kind of goal-setting "puts too much
pressure onus. As long as things are moving
and growing, we're psyched."
If success happens to them "with a
record label pouring money into" them
and controlling their careers much "like
the Spin Doctors," then they don't want it,
he continues.
In fact, The Samples parted ways with
their first label, Artista, for a similar rea
son. When the group brought prerecorded
material to the label, representatives of
Artista asked them to make some changes
to their songs to increase marketability,
according to MacNichol.
Since the band had been playing the songs
live and the songs went over well with audi
ences, he continues, The Samples felt no
need for fudging with their finished product.
The band and the label divorced amica
bly soon after. But he stresses that the
departure wasn't due to bad blood, rather
"we weren't the right band for them and
they weren't the right label for us."
Fortunately, The Samples found just what
they needed with W.A.R. records, a smaller
label based in New York; "No one in W.A.R.
has even heard any of the songs we've been
recording for the past two weeks."
MacNichol says that alone shows "the dif
ference in the way W.A.R. handles things."
Now out in California, The Samples cur
rendy are recording a new album for release
in mid-to-late summer. "The Samples" —
still on the Artista label — also will be out
in June, a result of earlier negotiations.
But don't rush to buy this album unless
you're prepared for a hypnotizingly mel
low experience while listening. Folk and
reggae dominate the sound, which should

clue you into what tempo to expect.
Do, however, check out the show. It's
definitely worth sampling. ■

The Samples will appear in Frost Amphitheater
tomorrow at 6 p.m. Tickets are $8/students, $6/stu
dents through group sales, $12/ general admission.
Tickets are a. ailable at Trcsidder Ticket Office.
