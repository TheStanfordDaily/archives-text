Can cooking ever
sublimate love?
Maybe in Mexico

Like Water For Chocolate

In Mexico, hot chocolate is prepared with
water, not milk. The cocoa is thrown in when
the water reaches the boiling point. When a
person is highly agitated, or sexually
aroused, they are said to be "Like Water For
Chocolate" — the title of a delectable ban
quet of love, magic and food served up by
Mexican director Alfonso Arau.
Set in 1910 Mexico, the English-subtitled
film follows Tita (Lumi Cavazos), the
youngest daughter of a ranching family
headed by her harsh mother, Elena (Regina
Torne). Family tradition requires the
youngest daughter to stay at home — un
married — and tend to her mother's every
whim until the matriarch dies.
Trapped by this custom, Tita learns the
art and magic of the kitchen from the fami
ly's Indian cook, Nacha. When Nacha dies,
Tita takes over her role. Believing food
should be made with love, she treats every
meal with care and tenderness.
When Tita falls in love with her neighbor,
the dashing Pedro ("Cinema Paradiso" 's
Marco Leonardi), her mother forbids their
marriage, offering Pedro the hand of her
oldest daughter Rosaura (Yareli Arizmendi)
instead. He accepts, wanting to remain close
to his true love.
Characteristic of the literary genre "mag
ical realism," perfected by authors such as
Gabriel Garcia Mdrquez and Isabel Allende,
Tita transmits her emotions into the food
she prepares.
In an enchanting and magical scene, Tita
— consumed by desire for Pedro — creates
"quail in rose-petal sauce," which ignites
fiery passion within each of the family mem
bers gathered around the dinner table.
The meal so excites sister Gertrudis
(Claudette Maille) that she runs to the out
door shower to cool off. But the smell of rose
petals she exudes attracts a revolutionary,
who sweeps the naked woman off her feet,
onto his horse and into the sunset.
Director Arau wisely treats such magical
sequences with a pragmatic eye, letting the

magic speak for itself without the use of
elaborate special effects. Here, the actors
themselves are the effects.
The amazing Cavazos brings both grace
and elegance to her role as Tita. She exudes
sensuality as well as a fierce determination to
break her family's oppressive tradition.
As Tita's mother, Torne creates a frighten
ing and haunting matriarch. And Mario Ivan
Martinez, as the kindly family doctor who
yearns for Tita, strikes the right balance be
tween idealistic desires and realistic atti
tudes.
Choppy in places, the movie should have
been 20 minutes longer. But Arau's wife
Laura Esquivel — adapting her own best
selling novel — sprinkles the script with
more than enough clever exchanges and
heartfelt emotion.
Get to the Guild Theater on El Camino as
soon as possible to see "Like Water For
Chocolate," even if you have to run naked
from the shower. The delicious taste of this
rich, multilayered film will linger long after
the lights go up.

Single white trash
seeks hit, maims
'91 French classic

Point of No Return

Two years ago, art houses brought us "La
Femme Nikita," directed by France's Luc
Besson ("The Big Blue"). His stylish and
moody mix of American kinetic violence
and Gallic restraint packed in US audiences
to the tune of 5 million dollars.
To accommodate an audience too illiter
ate for subtides, Warner Bros, graciously
provides us with a big-budget remake,
"Point of No Return." And aside from the
performances, the direction, the screenplay,
the score and the cinematography, it's a
much better film than the original.
Bridget Fonda stars as Maggie, an impul
sively violent wild child sentenced to death
for shooting a cop in a botched drug heist.
The government sees potential in her, so
they fake her death and train her to become the
perfect assassin. But once Maggie graduates
from the program and finds happiness with a
man, shooting innocent people in the head
loses its appeal.
Some critics have called Fonda's perfor
mance "career-making;" perhaps she wants
a career in B-movies. Anne Parillaud played
Nikita as a ferally sexy gamine that matured
into a woman; Fonda plays Maggie as an
Amy Fisher clone with a bigger gun and
more victims.
At age 29, Fonda's both too old and too
immature for the role. Her performance is
too studied, too cerebral — it's completely
wrong for a character who's entirely ground
ed in her body. And her frequent outbursts
of rage or tears bear the hammy hallmarks of
a beginning-actor's class.
The other actors don't phone in their per
formances much better. Gabriel Byrne, who
plays Maggie's Machiavellian mentor, Bob,
can't muster the deep-seated self-assurance
of French actor Tcheky Karyo. As Maggie's
ditzy boyfriend J.P., Dermot Mulroney's
comically inept performance undermines
the pathos of their doomed relationship.

Only Harvey Keitel's ("Bad Lieutenant")
nerdily violent clean-up assassin even ap
proaches the original.
John Badham ("Bird On A Wire"), a hack
director who never met a close-up he didn't
like, takes a budget six times the original and
makes it look like a Movie of the Week.
Where "Nikita" slowly increased the violent
nature of the assignments, Maggie's first job
forces her to witness the explosion from a
bomb she planted. No master of subtlety, he.
And the film's most daring set piece —
our heroine trying to kill her target with a
high-powered rifle from her bathroom win
dow, as her boyfriend talks to her through
the door — gets comically botched in the re
make. Why? Because his touching attempt to
uncover her past has been rewritten as a
marriage proposal. We expect Mel Gibson
and Goldie Hawn to pop up at any time.
The few critics who derided "La Femme
Nikita" as a simple-minded French attempt
to make an American film should be
strapped to a chair with their eyes held open
and forced to watch "Point of No Return."
After a few minutes of its derivative images,
accompanied by Hans Zimmer's banal
muzak score, they won't be able to sit
through another Hollywood flick. At least
not without vomiting.

Got a bad script?
Three untalented
actors won't help

Married To It

Director Arthur Hiller's latest effort,
"Married to it," might not seem so painfully
absurd if the brutal honesty and dark humor
of Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives" had
not proven so satisfying. And even if one
doesn't compare Hiller's film to Allen's ode
to matrimony, unimaginative performances
and a poorly developed script hinder his take
on the subject.
In a nutshell, "Married to it" tells the
story of three very different couples living in
or about New York City. Beau Bridges and
Stockard Channing are John and Iris, mid

die-aged hippies with kids, who get along fa
mously but don't quite remember what it
means to be in love.
Mary Stuart Masterson and Robert Sean
Leonard play Nina and Chuck, young Mid
western-bred professionals whose lives turn
topsy-turvy after Chuck, a stockbroker, is
wrongfully indicted for securities fraud.
Needless to say, the ordeal brings out their
uglier sides.
And then there's Cybil Shepherd and Ron
Silver as Claire and Leo, newlywed CEOs
who can't cope with the crises of Leo's 13-
year old daughter from another marriage.
Screenwriter Jane Kovalcik would like us
to believe that these couples, who share
nothing in common, become the best of
friends while planning a school function
over the course of three weeks. Sure, it
sounds reasonable, but after 20 minutes the
premise all but careens into a sturdy wall of
implausibility.
Hiller dumps his couples' problems on
the audience in rapid succession, suggesting
that their befriending one another precipi
tates an infectious chain reaction of
"drama," that is resolved in a blaze of "Zippi
ty doo da" happiness — not because "plenty
of sunshine" is headed in any of the charac
ters' direction, but because the flick's only
100 minutes long.
In each case, Hiller feels it appropriate to
show his characters at their worst and best —
it doesn't really matter how they get from
point A to point B, as long as they get there.
Hence Iris and John fall out of love in "scene
one," Leo and Claire break up in "scene two,"
Nina and Chuck loathe one another by
"scene three" and everyone's madly in love
again by the end of "scene four."
But by far the greatest disappointment of
"Married to it" is its cast, whose perfor
mances range from pass£ to laughable.
While the sincerity of Channing, Bridges
and Silver's acting makes it easy to blame the
film's poor character development, clearly
Shepherd, Masterson and Leonard aren't
playing with a full deck.
Hiller's predictably solid direction and the
script's comic ensemble scenes, spaced apart
just enough to keep things moving, save "Mar
ried to it"from being a complete disaster. But
don't put any money on it. You'll be less for
giving than a film critic who saw it for free.
