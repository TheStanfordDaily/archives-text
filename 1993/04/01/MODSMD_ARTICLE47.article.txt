The glamour boys'
sloppiness rears
its ugly head

Living Colour

Once in a long while a band does some
thing really revolutionary. Here it is: Living
Colour's new album "Stain." What musical
genius could inspire such confident words?
Actually, none. It's the CD case — a deep
red plastic that gives the cover photograph
of a bald woman wearing an Inquisition
torture piece an even more disturbing qual
ity.
But what about the rest of the album?
What about its inner personality? The album
is schizophrenic — half of the tracks are
solid and very musically mature, and the rest
lose themselves in an avalanche of chromat
ic sound.
Most noticeably, this album hits much
harder than past works by Living Colour.
Gone forever are the clean-cut days of
"Vivid"; this entire set is more akin to the
thrash-influenced title track of "Time's Up."
Being hard and fast doesn't mean you have to
get sloppy, but some of the tracks on "Stain"
do just that.
"Mind Your Own Business," "Postman"
and "This Little Pig" assault the ear with
their monochromatic pulsations of repeti
tive drum slamming and wandering guitar.
But don't think you'll be abused like this at
all times.
Au contraire, "Stain" redeems itself in
other ways. First, it grows on you; second,
there's a lot of musical experimentation in
this work. It's not as productive as "Time's
Up," but at least it's different, showing
both jazz and dance/industrial influences.
Many of the songs change and meld differ
ent styles — a risk that doesn't always
work. But when it does, it creates a unique
sound.
Two tracks succeed with this approach:
"Nothingness," a jazzy piece with a heavy
rhythm in the background, makes the origi
nal song sound like a remix. And "Bi," de
spite its kitschy treatment of sexual prefer
ence, is the album's best track, moving
smoothly from the clean funk of "Glamour
Boys," into a harder style, and then on to a

danceable, hip-hop groove.
The best tracks on the album harken back
to their earlier days, taking the sounds from
"Time's Up" (like "Ology," and "Type") a
step further. Had they abandoned some of
this album on the cutting-room floor,
"Stain" could have surpassed their previous
efforts. If you don't mind buying half an
album, then hit the nearest record store and
listen up. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and
buy one of their past discs.

If Sinead howled,
she'd sound like
this novice group

Belly

Tanya Donelly, former member of
Throwing Muses and the Breeders, now
fronts Belly, her new band. In "Star," the
band's debut effort, Donelly finally gets her
chance to shine.
"Star" encompasses a range of musical
sounds, no doubt reflecting the different in
fluences on the band. At times, Donelly's
voice sounds like that of her stepsister
Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses. And, in a
more unusual case (with the song "Low Red

Moon"), Donelly's voice eerily resembles
that of Sinead O'Connor. When she sings the
chorus, it sounds like O'Connor had made a
guest vocal, howling in the way that only she
can (well, not any more).
In fact, it's the diversity of Donelly's vo
cals, along with her storytelling, that add to
the intriguing quality of the album.
The songs are little stories which are
seemingly innocent, but a closer listening
shows evidence of darker forces at work. In
"Dusted," Donelly's girlish voice sings,
"Baby's playing dead in cellar, gave her water
just got paler."
Not all the songs are this grim. Mostly,
they're like a kind of fractured fairy tale. But
the music that accompanies each song is so
catchy that it obscures the strange nature of
the lyrics. A rock guitar cloud that betrays
the song's bleakness sweeps up Donelly's
dark lyrics in "Dusted."
"Someone to Die For" sounds like a lulla
by musically, yet Donelly questions how far
someone would go to protect a sister from
death. "Would you lay your body down on
the tracks for her?" she sings sweetly.
"Feed the Tree" uses a catchy guitar riff
that propels the song forward while Donelly
sings about being an old man and a squirrel.
She tells her man to "take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me and be there when
I feed the tree," and what feeding the tree
means is anybody's guess.
Musically, the album relies heavily on gui
tars that swirl about, creating many musical
hooks in the songs, helping to draw the lis

tener in.
Other influences can be found on the
album. "Untogether" recalls the blues guitar
sound of Mazzy Star which permeates the
song.
So while Belly fails to establish a clear cut
sound of its own, it manages to entertain the
listener with a mix of different catchy tunes.
For Donelly, the album proves that, al
though she might have played second fiddle
twice before, she doesn't have to anymore.

Hip-hop barnyard
animals don't fall
for Bush's 'tricks'

The Goats

They should have called themselves "The
Mutts."
On their self-titled debut, the Goats take
styles and trends from every breed of rap,
past and present, and somehow manage to
come up with a sound all their own. Hard
hitting street beats and live funk-filled tracks
collide with the political awareness of subur
bia. The fallout leaves an album worth
checking out.
Their music hovers somewhere among
Parliament's P-funk, Fishbone's metal-funk,
the Beastie Boys' punk-rap and hard-hitting
hip-hop. You can also hear the definite
trademark of Ruffhouse's Joe "The Butcher"
Nicolo (Cypress Hill, Kriss Kross), who co
produced the album with Goats' founder
Oatie Kato.
However, the Goats' unique ability to cre
ate this hybrid sound with a live six-piece
band makes them stand out, as do their
highly political lyrics, which challenge the
type of patriotism championed by former
President George Bush in his past two cam
paigns.
The three come from backgrounds as var
ied as their music. Italian-Irish rapper Oatie
Kato has lived everywhere from the projects
of Atlanta and Philly to the suburbs of
Boston. African-American members Madd
and Swayzack grew up in and around the
projects of North Philly and Easton, Penn.
As a result, they can all relate tales of street
life, using their college experiences to turn
the resulting cynicism into politics. "Tricks
of the Shade" exemplifies this: "Bush pulls
on the strings says that trickle is the thing/
But it ain't trickled down and 'round my
pockets it don't cling/ ... And ya get just
enough from the great Welfare cup/ To keep
from busting heads and making (Uncle)
Scam buckle up/ Just enough greenbacks to
quiet revolutions/ The government patches
leaks and ignores the solutions."
The Goats have five tracks that serious
hip-hop fans can bob their heads to: "Typi
cal American," "Whatcha Got is Whatcha
Gettin'," "Cumin' in Ya Ear," "Hip Hopola"
and "Tricks of the Shade."
Though the rhyming is on, you get the
feeling that you've heard the music some
where else. You have. The Goats fail to do
anything musically that has not been done
before. Still, those who dig hip-hop and its
roots should check it out.

lose themselves in an avalanche of chromat
ic sound.
Most noticeably, this album hits much
harder than past works by Living Colour.
Gone forever are the clean-cut days of
"Vivid"; this entire set is more akin to the
thrash-influenced title track of "Time's Up."
Being hard and fast doesn't mean you have to
get sloppy, but some of the tracks on "Stain"
do just that.
"Mind Your Own Business," "Postman"
and "This Little Pig" assault the ear with
their monochromatic pulsations of repeti
tive drum slamming and wandering guitar.
But don't think you'll be abused like this at
all times.
Au contraire, "Stain" redeems itself in
other ways. First, it grows on you; second,
there's a lot of musical experimentation in
this work. It's not as productive as "Time's
Up," but at least it's different, showing
both jazz and dance/industrial influences.
Many of the songs change and meld differ
ent styles — a risk that doesn't always
work. But when it does, it creates a unique
sound.
Two tracks succeed with this approach:
"Nothingness," a jazzy piece with a heavy
rhythm in the background, makes the origi
nal song sound like a remix. And "Bi," de
spite its kitschy treatment of sexual prefer
ence, is the album's best track, moving
smoothly from the clean funk of "Glamour
Boys," into a harder style, and then on to a

danceable, hip-hop groove.
The best tracks on the album harken back
to their earlier days, taking the sounds from
"Time's Up" (like "Ology," and "Type") a
step further. Had they abandoned some of
this album on the cutting-room floor,
"Stain" could have surpassed their previous
efforts. If you don't mind buying half an
album, then hit the nearest record store and
listen up. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and
buy one of their past discs.

If Sinead howled,
she'd sound like
this novice group

Belly

Tanya Donelly, former member of
Throwing Muses and the Breeders, now
fronts Belly, her new band. In "Star," the
band's debut effort, Donelly finally gets her
chance to shine.
"Star" encompasses a range of musical
sounds, no doubt reflecting the different in
fluences on the band. At times, Donelly's
voice sounds like that of her stepsister
Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses. And, in a
more unusual case (with the song "Low Red

Moon"), Donelly's voice eerily resembles
that of Sinead O'Connor. When she sings the
chorus, it sounds like O'Connor had made a
guest vocal, howling in the way that only she
can (well, not any more).
In fact, it's the diversity of Donelly's vo
cals, along with her storytelling, that add to
the intriguing quality of the album.
The songs are little stories which are
seemingly innocent, but a closer listening
shows evidence of darker forces at work. In
"Dusted," Donelly's girlish voice sings,
"Baby's playing dead in cellar, gave her water
just got paler."
Not all the songs are this grim. Mostly,
they're like a kind of fractured fairy tale. But
the music that accompanies each song is so
catchy that it obscures the strange nature of
the lyrics. A rock guitar cloud that betrays
the song's bleakness sweeps up Donelly's
dark lyrics in "Dusted."
"Someone to Die For" sounds like a lulla
by musically, yet Donelly questions how far
someone would go to protect a sister from
death. "Would you lay your body down on
the tracks for her?" she sings sweetly.
"Feed the Tree" uses a catchy guitar riff
that propels the song forward while Donelly
sings about being an old man and a squirrel.
She tells her man to "take your hat off boy
when you're talking to me and be there when
I feed the tree," and what feeding the tree
means is anybody's guess.
Musically, the album relies heavily on gui
tars that swirl about, creating many musical
hooks in the songs, helping to draw the lis

tener in.
Other influences can be found on the
album. "Untogether" recalls the blues guitar
sound of Mazzy Star which permeates the
song.
So while Belly fails to establish a clear cut
sound of its own, it manages to entertain the
listener with a mix of different catchy tunes.
For Donelly, the album proves that, al
though she might have played second fiddle
twice before, she doesn't have to anymore.

Hip-hop barnyard
animals don't fall
for Bush's 'tricks'

The Goats

They should have called themselves "The
Mutts."
On their self-titled debut, the Goats take
styles and trends from every breed of rap,
past and present, and somehow manage to
come up with a sound all their own. Hard
hitting street beats and live funk-filled tracks
collide with the political awareness of subur
bia. The fallout leaves an album worth
checking out.
Their music hovers somewhere among
Parliament's P-funk, Fishbone's metal-funk,
the Beastie Boys' punk-rap and hard-hitting
hip-hop. You can also hear the definite
trademark of Ruffhouse's Joe "The Butcher"
Nicolo (Cypress Hill, Kriss Kross), who co
produced the album with Goats' founder
Oatie Kato.
However, the Goats' unique ability to cre
ate this hybrid sound with a live six-piece
band makes them stand out, as do their
highly political lyrics, which challenge the
type of patriotism championed by former
President George Bush in his past two cam
paigns.
The three come from backgrounds as var
ied as their music. Italian-Irish rapper Oatie
Kato has lived everywhere from the projects
of Atlanta and Philly to the suburbs of
Boston. African-American members Madd
and Swayzack grew up in and around the
projects of North Philly and Easton, Penn.
As a result, they can all relate tales of street
life, using their college experiences to turn
the resulting cynicism into politics. "Tricks
of the Shade" exemplifies this: "Bush pulls
on the strings says that trickle is the thing/
But it ain't trickled down and 'round my
pockets it don't cling/ ... And ya get just
enough from the great Welfare cup/ To keep
from busting heads and making (Uncle)
Scam buckle up/ Just enough greenbacks to
quiet revolutions/ The government patches
leaks and ignores the solutions."
The Goats have five tracks that serious
hip-hop fans can bob their heads to: "Typi
cal American," "Whatcha Got is Whatcha
Gettin'," "Cumin' in Ya Ear," "Hip Hopola"
and "Tricks of the Shade."
Though the rhyming is on, you get the
feeling that you've heard the music some
where else. You have. The Goats fail to do
anything musically that has not been done
before. Still, those who dig hip-hop and its
roots should check it out.

The glamour boys'
sloppiness rears
its ugly head

Living Colour

Once in a long while a band does some
thing really revolutionary. Here it is: Living
Colour's new album "Stain." What musical
genius could inspire such confident words?
Actually, none. It's the CD case — a deep
red plastic that gives the cover photograph
of a bald woman wearing an Inquisition
torture piece an even more disturbing qual
ity.
But what about the rest of the album?
What about its inner personality? The album
is schizophrenic — half of the tracks are
solid and very musically mature, and the rest
lose themselves in an avalanche of chromat
ic sound.
