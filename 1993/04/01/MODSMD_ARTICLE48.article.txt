J Street sits this small deli cafe. You
would never know it from the out
side, but behind this unlikely store-

front rests a beautiful botanical gar
den patio.
In the garden, multiple levels and
interwoven plants create a feeling of
privacy while also maintaining a cozy
atmosphere.
The garden area seats 145, however
only six seats are indoors, so watch
the weather. If you have been looking
for a quiet and tranquil outdoor spot
to study or chat over coffee, search no
more.
The Paradise Garden Cafe offers all
the standards of a California cafe:
croissants, mochas, lattes, cappucci
nos, etc. For the hearty appetite, the
friendly owner and hostess, Maggie
Mirochnik, offers a variety of club
sandwiches and salads.

Keep this in mind for the next sunny
day. The tables are larger than tradi
tional cafe tables, leaving extra room
for books. The cafe is within easy bik-

dinin'

ing distance of campus, just behind
Escondido Village.
