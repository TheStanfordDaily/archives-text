far and away, The Edge is the
most convenient nightclub
around. Located at 260 California
Avenue, The Edge is just a bike ride
away. Combine the bike ride with the
Edge's hugely successful $2 Tuesdays
and you can start off your week with a
hall-of-famer of cheap dates.
Unlike most clubs in the area, The

dancin'

Edge stays open past 2 a.m. and allows
in everyone from ages 18 and up.
They do, however, have a dress code
that includes no baseball hats, no tank
tops, and no sandals. So be prepared,
because the Edge management has
hired the largest human beings in the

nearest four counties to work the
doors — the types of humans that
could have made us perennial fa
vorites at The Blockbuster Bowl.
Besides being accessible, The Edge
is also one of the more diverse venues
in the area offering live concerts with
nationally touring acts, such as the
upcoming Inspiral Carpets show and
modern rock dancing with some of
the Bay Area's best known DJs (like
Mark Hamilton from Live 105 and
local deejay Bernard Cabignon).
In addition to modern rock, The
Edge has a history of fine reggae con
certs such as the upcoming King Yel
lowman show, and features a
disco/funk room every Friday night.
Prices at the Edge are a few dollars
less than what you would expect to

pay in San Francisco or San Jose for
similar attractions. As far as amenities
go, the Edge has two full bars with fre
quent drink specials, a restaurant and
one of the best light displays of any
club, period.
