for the best in big hair, fake tans and labial skirts,
the 42nd Street Bar and Grill, located off of
University Avenue on Bryant, is the place to go.
Late '80s music pervades the room, with groups like
the B-525, Tone-Loc and LL. Cool J. giving the twen
ty-something crowd an excuse to use the small dance
floor available weekend nights.
Wood panelling, ceiling fans, an overhanging
second floor make the ambience more attractive
than the people. There's even a fireplace in the
r

front to
discuss
Kant with
your new

drinkin'

Aqua Netted friends. The Mai-Tais are particular
ly yummy, potent and big — much like many of
the patrons.
Rudy's, not but four blocks away on Universi
ty Avenue, right after that bridge thing, offers a
completely different bar experience. Small, dark,
relatively empty, Rudy's offers a quieter experience
for unmarried couples and intimate friends. It's
the kind of place where you might run into your
philosophy T.A.
Henry's, located a little farther down Universi
ty, between Waverly and Cowper, bumps hardest
during the day, with a mostly thirtyish crowd; the
suits from Palo Alto stop in for lunch and the '90s
equivalent of a Martini.
At night, however, the place de-yuppifies and
becomes the closest thing to a blue-collar bar you
can find in Palo Alto. On any weeknight, you can
overhear people overtly flirt by talking about how
hard up they are.
Yeah, but at least the lighting is different from
your dorm room.
