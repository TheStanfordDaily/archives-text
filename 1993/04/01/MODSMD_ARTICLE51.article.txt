# Gettin'frank with The Judy Bats
## 
### Janar Stewart 
Lead singer ofThe Judyßats Jeff
Heiskel mocks musicians who
do everything a rock star is
supposed to do — wear
leather, tattoo themselves, grow their
hair long— right down to getting "stu
pid, anorexic girlfriends."
Immediately approachable, Heiskel
openly explains how The Judyßats
have matured since producer Kevin
Maloney banned "guitar punch-ins,"
forcing them to play all at once when
recording music.
Heiskel admits, prior to that experi
ence, he didn't realize just how many
way artists can cheat when recording,
creating a sound they can't reproduce
in concert.
He says he's glad members of The
Judyßats no longer record the music sep
arately nor do any of "that kind of crap,
whorish crap," proudly pointing out that
"a lot of people say [the group] sounds as
good or better" live than on CD.
Vocally intensive, with melodies
and harmonies a significant part of the
sound, their music requires the singers
to have talent.
"If you can't sing well, why would
you sing?" Heiskel asks.
Concerts focus more on playing
good music than stage antics, he relays:
"I'm not a dancer."
But that doesn't mean Heiskel re
mains restrained when performing. He
has been known to grab his crotch on
stage, all in good fun of course.
"When I grab my crotch, it's comi
cal," Heiskel laughs. "I would never
grab my crotch and think it would be
construed as sexy."
So far, the group has played seven
dates in the South and will appear at
Slim's on Wednesday. Their label cur
rently has The Judyßats on a vigorous
two-month tour. Heiskel jokes about
resorting to drugs to continue func
tioning. He often tells his mom, "Sui
cide is always an option."
When asked to describe the music,

Heiskel pauses, fumbling for an accu
rate answer:
"It's hard to be objective. I don't
know how to describe it." Suddenly,
a comeback hits him. "That's your
job," he fingers playfully.
"A lot of people want to say some
thing about R.E.M. when they hear us,"
Heiskel offers, claiming he never heard
of the group before people made that
comparison.
"When I was a kid, all I really heard
was the radio. My mom had a bunch of
records from musicals."
Heiskel used to infuriate his friends
by constantly confusing R.E.M. with
The Smiths, telling them things like
how much he loves that "falling sky
song" by The Smiths.
On "Pain Makes You Beautiful,"
The Judyßats' latest release, it's
difficult to make the R.E.M.-
Judyßats connection, except for the
fact that both bands are alternative
bands from the South.
All of the songs off "Pain" have a
light, airy sound — mostly due to
Heiskel's soothing tenor vocals and the
lilting harmonies that accompany
them.
Even in "My Dead Friend," a cut off
"Pain" that likens the grief felt after the
death of a friend to the buzz of a chain
saw, the music sounds more mellow
and dreamy than morose.
Also, you'd have to take a micro
scope to The Judyßats lyrics in order to
find political messages, or any concrete
messages at all:
"We really don't have any type of
agenda. We just go down in the base
ment and record."
Heiskel, also the lyricist for the
band, lists Joni Mitchell and Bootsy
Collins among his influences.
"I'm a Joni Mitchell fanatic," he ex
claims. "I had no idea that people could
put such prose to music."
"La Dulcinea," a song that refers the

novel, "Don Quixote," illustrates just
what an effect Mitchell's writing style
had on Heiskel.
"You don't have to go to the Eddie
Money school of lyrics, 'Take me home
tonight.. .'"he sings.
Heiskel writes his lyrics separately
from the band, then adj usts them to the
music later: "I really like the collabora
tion."

Also responsible for much of the
melody work, Heiskel says when think
ing of melodies, he just starts "yapping
around." The band picks up on his
tune and works it out.
"We've been playing together for
six years," he says. Heiskel and gui
tarists Ed Winters and Johnny Sughrue
met while students at die University of
Tennessee.

Writing and singing for The
)udyßats is Heiskel's first
musical venture. Although
the band has met with critical acclaim
and commercial success, status from
newly acquired fame causes some
problems.
"If all of us had gotten jobs making
$150,000 a year, it wouldn't be the
same. Just the fact that you could be on
television changes the way people treat
you and deal with you," he says.
Reaction to such treatment surfaces
in Heiskel's songs, most of which deal
on some level with the insincerity
brought about by the importance soci
ety places on superficial qualities like
physical beauty.
"Ugly on the Outside" charms the
listener with upbeat, romantic music
and beautiful harmonies singing
"You're pure light pure delight pure
delight," disguising the difficulty the
singer has being seen with his unattrac
tive lover. More disturbing lines say,
"Some fright/you're ugly on the out
side/I guess we won't be holding
hands/like Hallmark lovers in the
sands."
Complicated relationships based on
schizophrenic emotions comprise the
content of all but two cuts off "Pain."
Maybe this subject matter has
something to do with Heiskel's self-de
scribed "wacky" parents.
"I think my dad is living in a bread
truck," Heiskel reveals. His father ha
bitually drives aimlessly around the
earth destined for God-knows-where
for anywhere from one to four months.
Out of the blue, he'll call Heiskel from
Ecuador, or suddenly appear at gigs to
say "hi," Heiskel says.
"The thing I worry about is if he re
ally wigs out. He's not living with me,"
he laughs. ■

The Judyßats will appear Wednesday,
April7,9p.m. atSlim's, 33311thStreet, SF.

Lead singer ofThe Judyßats Jeff
Heiskel mocks musicians who
do everything a rock star is
supposed to do — wear
leather, tattoo themselves, grow their
hair long— right down to getting "stu
pid, anorexic girlfriends."
Immediately approachable, Heiskel
openly explains how The Judyßats
have matured since producer Kevin
Maloney banned "guitar punch-ins,"
forcing them to play all at once when
recording music.
Heiskel admits, prior to that experi
ence, he didn't realize just how many
way artists can cheat when recording,
creating a sound they can't reproduce
in concert.
He says he's glad members of The
Judyßats no longer record the music sep
arately nor do any of "that kind of crap,
whorish crap," proudly pointing out that
"a lot of people say [the group] sounds as
good or better" live than on CD.
Vocally intensive, with melodies
and harmonies a significant part of the
sound, their music requires the singers
to have talent.
"If you can't sing well, why would
you sing?" Heiskel asks.
Concerts focus more on playing
good music than stage antics, he relays:
"I'm not a dancer."
But that doesn't mean Heiskel re
mains restrained when performing. He
has been known to grab his crotch on
stage, all in good fun of course.
"When I grab my crotch, it's comi
cal," Heiskel laughs. "I would never
grab my crotch and think it would be
construed as sexy."
So far, the group has played seven
dates in the South and will appear at
Slim's on Wednesday. Their label cur
rently has The Judyßats on a vigorous
two-month tour. Heiskel jokes about
resorting to drugs to continue func
tioning. He often tells his mom, "Sui
cide is always an option."
When asked to describe the music,

Heiskel pauses, fumbling for an accu
rate answer:
"It's hard to be objective. I don't
know how to describe it." Suddenly,
a comeback hits him. "That's your
job," he fingers playfully.
"A lot of people want to say some
thing about R.E.M. when they hear us,"
Heiskel offers, claiming he never heard
of the group before people made that
comparison.
"When I was a kid, all I really heard
was the radio. My mom had a bunch of
records from musicals."
Heiskel used to infuriate his friends
by constantly confusing R.E.M. with
The Smiths, telling them things like
how much he loves that "falling sky
song" by The Smiths.
On "Pain Makes You Beautiful,"
The Judyßats' latest release, it's
difficult to make the R.E.M.-
Judyßats connection, except for the
fact that both bands are alternative
bands from the South.
All of the songs off "Pain" have a
light, airy sound — mostly due to
Heiskel's soothing tenor vocals and the
lilting harmonies that accompany
them.
Even in "My Dead Friend," a cut off
"Pain" that likens the grief felt after the
death of a friend to the buzz of a chain
saw, the music sounds more mellow
and dreamy than morose.
Also, you'd have to take a micro
scope to The Judyßats lyrics in order to
find political messages, or any concrete
messages at all:
"We really don't have any type of
agenda. We just go down in the base
ment and record."
Heiskel, also the lyricist for the
band, lists Joni Mitchell and Bootsy
Collins among his influences.
"I'm a Joni Mitchell fanatic," he ex
claims. "I had no idea that people could
put such prose to music."
"La Dulcinea," a song that refers the

novel, "Don Quixote," illustrates just
what an effect Mitchell's writing style
had on Heiskel.
"You don't have to go to the Eddie
Money school of lyrics, 'Take me home
tonight.. .'"he sings.
Heiskel writes his lyrics separately
from the band, then adj usts them to the
music later: "I really like the collabora
tion."

Also responsible for much of the
melody work, Heiskel says when think
ing of melodies, he just starts "yapping
around." The band picks up on his
tune and works it out.
"We've been playing together for
six years," he says. Heiskel and gui
tarists Ed Winters and Johnny Sughrue
met while students at die University of
Tennessee.

Writing and singing for The
)udyßats is Heiskel's first
musical venture. Although
the band has met with critical acclaim
and commercial success, status from
newly acquired fame causes some
problems.
"If all of us had gotten jobs making
$150,000 a year, it wouldn't be the
same. Just the fact that you could be on
television changes the way people treat
you and deal with you," he says.
Reaction to such treatment surfaces
in Heiskel's songs, most of which deal
on some level with the insincerity
brought about by the importance soci
ety places on superficial qualities like
physical beauty.
"Ugly on the Outside" charms the
listener with upbeat, romantic music
and beautiful harmonies singing
"You're pure light pure delight pure
delight," disguising the difficulty the
singer has being seen with his unattrac
tive lover. More disturbing lines say,
"Some fright/you're ugly on the out
side/I guess we won't be holding
hands/like Hallmark lovers in the
sands."
Complicated relationships based on
schizophrenic emotions comprise the
content of all but two cuts off "Pain."
Maybe this subject matter has
something to do with Heiskel's self-de
scribed "wacky" parents.
"I think my dad is living in a bread
truck," Heiskel reveals. His father ha
bitually drives aimlessly around the
earth destined for God-knows-where
for anywhere from one to four months.
