■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's got
America abuzz? Well you won't find
out, unless you see writer-director
Neil Jordan's offbeat hit. Stephen
Rea, Forest Whitaker and newcom
er Jaye Davidson are at the top of
their game in this brilliant web of
love and intrigue involving the IRA,
a British soldier and an enigmatic
hairdresser. Shades of "Vertigo,"
it's a definite must-see. R
■ Ethan Frome
Last year's hot dead author was
E.M. Forster; this year, it's Edith
Wharton. John Madden's adapta
tion turns a blatantly melodramatic
plot into a sensitive work of art.
Actor Liam Neeson ("Husbands
and Wives") brilliantly imparts
Ethan's vulnerability and good
heartedness without resorting to
the standard silences of most male
leads. And the film's tragic ending
will chill you like the New England
winter of the story's setting. R
Falling Down
Michael Douglas plays a laid-off
defense worker who loses it while
trapped in an L.A. traffic jam. On
his way home, he leaves a trail of
trashed Korean grocery stores,
dead Latino gangbangers and ter
rified fast-food employees in his
wake. So why's it so bad? Because
the writer and director think terror
izing Koreans and shooting help
less Latinos is funny. Rent "The
Terminator" instead. R
Mad Dog and Glory
It could have been a contender;
Produced by Martin Scorsese, writ
ten by Richard Price ("Sea of

Love,") and directed by John Mc-
Naughton ("Henry: Portrait of a Ser
ial Killer"). But the high-concept
plot of a gangster (Bill Murray) giv
ing a Sad Lieutenant (Robert
DeNiro) the company of a female
bartender (Uma Thurman) for a
week doesn't have enough charac
ter development to make it work.
Still, it boasts the most brutally hon
est sex scene since Almodovar's
"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down." R
■ Sommersby
Richard Gere plays Jack Som
mersby, a callous, irresponsible
scoundrel who leaves his Southern
hometown to fight in the Civil War.
But when he returns home, he's a
socially enlightened, sensitive man
with the soul of a poet. Changed
man — or charming impostor?
Gere keeps his wife Laurel (Jodie
Foster), the townspeople and the
audience guessing right up until
the end. PG-13
Swing Kids
Forget Achtung, it's "Swing Heil,
Baby," courtesy of the folks at Dis
ney. In case anyone's forgotten how
despicable the Nazis were, here's
another war crime: they wouldn't let
the German youth dance to the
swinging sounds of Duke Ellington
and Benny Goodman. Oh, and they
killed 6 million Jews as well. This at
titude characterizes Disney's shal
low, entertainment-oriented ap
proach to the material. Too preachy
to entertain, too naive to inform.
What's next: "Hip-hop: The Kunta
Kinte Story"? PG-13
