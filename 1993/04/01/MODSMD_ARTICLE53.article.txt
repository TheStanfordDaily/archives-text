Before 1492 andThelma and Louise, Ridley Scott
directed Blade Runner, a visionary imagining of
21st century Los Angeles. Harrison Ford stars as a
L.A.'s best blade runner, trained to detect and destroy syn
thetic human beings known as replicants. Scott wowed
critics with his cynical view of the future, overrun by
Japanese, Latinos and other others. Scott's director's cut,
now available on video, eliminates Ford's pathetic attempt
at noir narration. The story's got a few holes, but the im
ages are unforgettable.
Woody Allen and Soon-Yi's Agamemnon-Elektra com
plex can't obscure the brilliance of his latest film, Hus
bands and Wives. An edgy, pessimistic look at mar
riage, Allen debunks the notion that love deepens with
time by exploring the dissatisfactions that build up in
long-term relationships. Judy Davis stands out as a Har
vard-educatcd New York neurotic who drives her husband
and her lover away with her unbearable demands.
Imagine Psycho, Peeping Tom and Dressed To
Kill combined into a single film. That's what we get in
Brian DePalma's latest, Raising Cain, a thrillomedy
about a psychotic child psychologist, played by John Lith
gow. DePalma pulls out all the tricks from his considerable
bag of thriller techniques to paralyze the audience with ei
ther fear or laughter. His parody of the Train Steps se
quence in The Untouchables alone makes this a worth
while rental.
Perhaps the week's best rent is independent-filmmaker
Allison Anders' Gas Food Lodging. Brooke Adams,
Fairuza Balk (winner of the Independent Spirit Best Ac
tress Award) and lone Skye ("Say Anything") star as a sin
gle mother and her daughters, struggling with finance, ro
mance and each other. A touching story and an excellent
primer on the meaty roles that Hollywood films don't pro
vide for actresses.
