# Out of this world

### 
Digable Planets, one of the hip-hop galaxy's skyrock
eting phenomena, comes to the Bay Area this weekend
to indoctrinate listeners into a socially conscious, intel
ligent musical world.
Masterminded by Butterfly, along with the talents of
Ladybug and Doodle Bug, the group's influence has
been serious, its "Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time
and Space)" album debuting on Billboard's pop charts
at No. 15.
Digable Planets will be featured at Slim's in San Fran
cisco on April 3, as well as One Step Beyond in Santa
Clara on April 4.
