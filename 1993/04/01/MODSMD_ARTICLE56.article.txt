Bruce Lee was my hero.
Ever since he kicked Chuck Norris' ass in
"Return of the Dragon," I became a believer.
From "Fists of Fury" to "Game of Death," he
provided hours of legal highs.
After he died, I stopped going to Asian ac
tion movies. Lesser talents like Seagal and
Van Damme replaced Bruce Lee on the
movie screen, but not in my heart.

But last weekend, I saw a film that made me
fall in love with the chop-socky genre all over
again. Now I've got a new hero. A Hong Kong
director named John Woo. In his '89 film,
"The Killer," an assassin accidentally blinds a
beautiful singer during a hit. To pay for her
cornea transplant, he accepts one last job.
True, it's not "Citizen Kane." But it boasts
the best action sequences ever filmed —

merging the styles of Peckinpah, Leone and
Scorsese into a carefully choreographed bal
let of death. Five minutes into the film, I
wished I was watching it on a VCR so that 1
could rewind the tape.
So don't look for me on campus this week
end. I'll be in The City checking out his latest
flick, "Hard Boiled." You should too.
