# Students discuss Arab-Israeli tensions
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Joint social events, a role rever
sal exercise and a series of meet
ings were among the ideas sug
gested by a diverse group that
gathered last night to explore
ways to reduce tensions between
Arab and Jewish communities on
campus.
A group of 11 graduate stu
dents and community members
met in response to a letter pub
lished in The Daily last quarter
that called for cooperative efforts
to mitigate conflicts between the
Arab and Jewish student groups.
The letter was written by law stu
dent Daniel Lubetzky, who orga
nized last night's discussion.
"For three to four weeks, there
were a series of events followed by
a number of letters in The Daily
that caused tension for many peo
ple involved in the Arab-Israeli
conflict. When it was my time to
respond, I thought we should put
that behind, and instead be more
forward-looking," Lubetzky said.
In order to create a "positive dia
logue," he asked Richard Burke, the
associate director of the Stanford
Center for Conflict and Negotiation
