# Students discuss Arab-Israeli tensions
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Joint social events, a role rever
sal exercise and a series of meet
ings were among the ideas sug
gested by a diverse group that
gathered last night to explore
ways to reduce tensions between
Arab and Jewish communities on
campus.
A group of 11 graduate stu
dents and community members
met in response to a letter pub
lished in The Daily last quarter
that called for cooperative efforts
to mitigate conflicts between the
Arab and Jewish student groups.
The letter was written by law stu
dent Daniel Lubetzky, who orga
nized last night's discussion.
"For three to four weeks, there
were a series of events followed by
a number of letters in The Daily
that caused tension for many peo
ple involved in the Arab-Israeli
conflict. When it was my time to
respond, I thought we should put
that behind, and instead be more
forward-looking," Lubetzky said.
In order to create a "positive dia
logue," he asked Richard Burke, the
associate director of the Stanford
Center for Conflict and Negotiation

and a Law School lecturer, to mod
erate the discussion.
"We're meeting to see whether
the opposite sides of this conflict
can come together to co-sponsor
some educational measures on
campus," Burke announced at the
beginning at the discussion. "It
should be entirely forward-look
ing, not about who is right or
wrong."
In keeping with this future-ori
ented view, Burke stressed that
there should be no discussion of
the events on or off campus that
had led up to the meeting.

The group began by discussing
their interests in the situation.
"I would like to hear the other
side's view, and to see whether
there are any solutions to the
large conflict, not just the on
campus conflict," said Zohar
Yakhini, an Israeli graduate stu
dent.
Others were also there to
learn. Simone Shaheen, a law stu
dent of Palestinian descent,
expressed interest in hearing
from people who were from the
Middle East themselves.
Almost all the group members
spoke of the need for better edu
cation about the conflict. "We
need education, and education
that doesn't necessarily have an
agenda," said graduate student

Morry Katz.
By the end of the meeting, sev
eral suggestions had been offered
for programs that would further
the group's goals. Ideas included
meetings facilitated by respected
members of the community, a
series of films presenting differ
ent viewpoints and presentations
by authors of books on the Middle
East.
Lubetzky also stressed the
need for a social event, such as a
dinner where members of the
groups could get to know each
other better while enjoying
foods from around the Middle
East.
"Once we realize we all do eat
food, we can be more tolerant of
each other," Lubetzky said.
