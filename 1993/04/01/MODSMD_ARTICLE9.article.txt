# Budget woes return
## Inaccurate library estimates result in nearly $2.4 million in budget shortfall 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University's indirect-cost budget
analyses inadvertently underestimated
the effects of a change of presidential ad
ministrations on library acquisitions,
and officials now predict a University
budget shortfall of $2.4 million.
"The start of the Clinton Administra
tion has caused us to significantly in
crease our books on a variety of subjects,
including job creation and health care,
and we simply forgot to tell the budget
people," said University archivist Mar
garet Kimball.
Because of a process known as "inde
pendent budgetary compounding," the
omission, which originally involved only
a few hundred thousand dollars, will
cause the University to significantly re
think next year's budget, according to
Provost Gerald Lieberman.
Independent budgetary compounding
is a result of the University's insistence
on complying to a strict mathematical
formula for budgetary inputs, rather
than what "most people" would call "ac
counting," according to Lieberman.
To "recontextualize" the budget dy
namic and reassure irate alumni, Lieber
man said he would appoint a "four-star

commission" to syn
thesize the decision
making process with
occasional input from
the Faculty Senate,
student leaders and
government officials.
Kimball sought to
reassure what she
called "the library
community" that the
mistake would have

no immediate impact on library services,
acquisitions or hours.
The revelation of a new indirect-cost
accounting snafu could come as an em
barrassment to University officials. Of
late, Stanford has enjoyed a relative lull
in the bad publicity that previously
soaked the school's reputation and forced
former University President Donald
Kennedy's resignation.
"It doesn't surprise me," former Of
fice of Naval Research regulator Paul
Biddle said when informed of the new
revelation. "It doesn't surprise me at all."
It was the rough-and-tumble Biddle who
first blew the whistle on Stanford's over
billing of the federal government.
