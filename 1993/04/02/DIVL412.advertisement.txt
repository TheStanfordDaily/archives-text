LSAT
PREPARATION FOR JUNE 14 EXAM STARTS APRIL 10
The Program's course to prepare students for the
June LSAT starts Saturday, April 10 and meets mostly
Tuesday evenings (with at least one weekend class) through
June 8. All auricular preparation, instruction, and feedback are
offered by a former Stanford faculty member who is a Stanford J.D.
and a practicing attorney who has prepared members of the Stanford
community since 1978 for the LSAT. The median score for the Program's
Stanford-related students taking the October LSAT was 170. Enrollment will be
limited to ten students, and the fee is $550.
The June test has been historically easiest since the 1991 format revision.
In each of the last two years, students needed four to six more questions
right on the October LSAT to get same score that students achieved
on the June test.
