### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
As part of an effort to improve
efficiency and cut costs, Stanford
Hospital announced yesterday
plans to eliminate 100 staff jobs.
But because of attrition from
retirements and resignations,
only about 10 employees will be
laid off involuntarily, said Felix
Barthelemy, director of human
resources for the hospital.
The staff reductions resulted
from a $16 million cut in the hos
pital's 1994 operating budget.
Part of a multi-year budget
cutting program, the reduction in
the hospital's $415 million annu
al budget draws from recommen
dations made by 15 internal task
forces, explained Malinda
Mitchell, the hospital's vice presi
dent and chief operating officer,
in a statement released yester
day.
Other recommendations gen
erated by the task forces range
from standardizing medication
and cross-training employees, to
maintaining shorter hospital
stays, said Lori Gunderson, the
acting director of nursing.
According to Mitchell, im
provements in efficiency will not
sacrifice quality of care. "We
asked the people responsible for
care how they could do things bet
ter and more efficiently," she
said, referring to the task forces,
which consisted of staff, nurses,
doctors and management work
ing in specific areas, such as neu
rosciences or cardiovascular med
icine.
"By involving a variety of peo
ple throughout the hospital, we
are able to become more efficient
while maintaining service," she
added.
