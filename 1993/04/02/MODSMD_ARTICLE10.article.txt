## Senate OKs Clinton's taxes, budget cuts 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate gave
final approval to the core of President Clinton's
economic program yesterday, as Democrats
hurried a mammoth budget-cutting blueprint
through Congress in record time.
The five-year, $496 billion outline for tax
boosts on the rich and Pentagon reductions
cleared the Senate on a virtual party-line 55-45
vote. On Wednesday, representatives also
divided by party had approved the House-Sen
ate compromise on a 240-184 roll call.
The Senate fight over a companion $16.3 bil
lion jobs bill, entering its second week, showed
signs of nearing resolution. But Republicans

released a letter showing that all 43 of them
would use Senate procedures to block approval
of the bill indefinitely, suggesting the measure
might have to be trimmed to meet GOP
demands.
After Democrats discussed the standoff pri
vately for nearly two hours, leaders vowed to
plow ahead and if necessary work into their
Easter recess, which starts tomorrow. They
said there would be no compromise.
"We're going to stay here until we get this
done," said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
The jobs measure would increase public

works spending and other employment-creat
ing programs. Republicans say most of the
measure is a wasteful spending splurge by
Democrats. The House approved the bill last
month.
As Clinton and Senate Democrats worked
hard on the jobs measure, they expended far
less energy on the deficit-reduction outline,
which passed in a remarkable display of Demo
cratic speed, unity and resolve.
The deficit-reduction measure assumes
unpopular steps like higher taxes on energy
users and on higher-income Social Security
recipients. Almost all of it remained intact.
