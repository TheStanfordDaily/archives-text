Defense rests in Rodney King trial
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Defense attorneys stunned a federal
court yesterday by abruptly resting their case in the Rodney King
beating trial.
At first, the move seemed to signal a quick end to the trial. But a dis
pute over the government's planned rebuttal halted proceedings late in
the day and sent defense lawyers scurrying to prepare papers seeking
intercession by an appeals court.
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies set off the furor by giving pros
ecutors permission to play for jurors a recording of portions of officer
Theodore Briseno's testimony against his co-defendants in their ear
lier state trial.
The testimony includes Briseno's accusation that a co-defen
dant was "out of control" during King's beating and struck the
motorist in the head.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Army Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said yesterday approximately 4,000 U.S.

ell said U.S. troops currently number about 10,000; he expects the
force to be reduced to about 4,000 by summer.
