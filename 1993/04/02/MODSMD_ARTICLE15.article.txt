## Editorial An athletic balance 
### 
At most schools,
women's athletic programs
receive short shrift in both
funding and administrative sup
port. However, recent actions by
Stanford administration and the
Department of Athletics demon
strate that Stanford is not just
another university.
Earlier this week, the Athletics
Department announced the cre
ation of three new varsity sports
and 29 additional athletic schol
arships for women within the
next four years. This is an
attempt to satisfy the Title IX
mandates of the 1972 Education
Amendments.
This enhancement comes on the
heels of the findings of the Athlet
ics Department's Title IX Com
mittee, a group which found
inconsistencies in the funding and
support of men's and women's
teams at Stanford. However,

instead of burying, dismissing or
ignoring the committee's findings,
the Athletics Department has cho
sen to act quickly to address these
iniquities.
Instead of attempting to dance
around the Title IX regulations, as
many universities have done when
pressured by lawsuits or legisla
tion, the Athletics Department has
instead chosen to directly attack
the discrepancy between the Uni
versity's support of men's and
women's sports.
There is only one troublesome
aspect of this bold step â€” the net
tlesome question of funding. The
funds for the Women's Sports
Enhancement Program will not
come from the University, but
instead from Athletics Depart
ment fund-raising. However, the
merits of this step should ensure a
successful resolution for the pro
gram.
