# A 						fee-ble surcharge

### 
CURRENTLY, THE LANE
Medical Library is debating
whether to institute a $500
annual access and borrowing fee
for users not associated with Stan
ford. While there is no doubt that
all departments of the University
are reeling from the recent budget
cuts, the establishment of such a
fee is a Draconian manner in
which to recoup these losses.
Like it or not, universities are
public resources, both for intellec
tual leadership and for more basic
needs. To deprive the community
around Stanford of the many trea
sures which Stanford possesses
would be a horrible means to dis
tance the University from the
cities around us.
While the installment of this fee
may not definitely lead to this
effect, it would effectively declare
that Stanford is not a part of the
Bay Area community. The fee's
exorbitant level would almost com
plete eliminate non-medical

researchers from the Library,
instead forcing them to travel to
UC-San Francisco's free medical
library.
If the library cannot receive
additional funding from the Uni
versity to alleviate their current
fiscal difficulties, a per-use charge
would be a more benign means to
raise funds. By collecting a small
fee from each non-campus user
each time he or she utilizes the
library, Lane could ensure that
only the heaviest users would be
forced to pay the lion's share of the
library's upkeep costs.
Admittedly, outsiders utilize the
library and should also be required
to foot at least part of the bill for its
upkeep. But $500 is a prohibitive
price to pay to make use of the insti
tution. Although the needs of stu
dents and staff must be the first
priority of Stanford, the University
must never forget that it is part of a
community, and that this involves
responsibilities as well as benefits.
