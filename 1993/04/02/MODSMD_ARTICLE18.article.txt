## Helpful hints on cheating 
### 
CHEATING?!? No joke, kids. It hap
pened in high school and it happens
here, daily. Anyone who doesn't
beiieve that needs serious electroshock
treatment. It just so happens that occa
sionally a set of cheaters is so utterly
incompetent as to be caught.
Students routinely ignore the Honor
Code. We ignore it, I ignore it, because
I don't see who it hurts to have some
one copy a problem set the night before
it is due.
The goal at Stanford is for the stu
dents to learn, so what's the difference
between a classmate or a pushover TA
doing a problem for a student. (As an
aside, TA's come in 3 varieties: here
let-me-do-that-pesky-problem-for-you-
wh ile-y ou-learn-nothing-but-1-am-a
push-over; you-are-an-intellectual-pim
ple-and-I-will-now-proceed-to-badger-
you-until-you-are-so-frustrated-that-
you-leave-and-I-can-do-my-crossword;
and I-will-guide-you-to-the-solution.)
Hear ye, hear ye, I'll now announce
the solution to this problem (next week
how to get rid of those pesky corns and
warts). The professors need to give bet
ter tests.
The purpose of an exam is to ensure
that students know the necessary infor
mation — in sufficient depth, and with
the ability to synthesize the information.
If the exam is simply a "please-barf
up-the-textbook-and-one-lung" test, then

both the cheater and the honest student
will probably forget the same informa
tion at the same rate after the class has
ended. There simply must be a better
method for making students learn vol
umes of boring information.
True, in an essay test, if the questions
are known to some students beforehand,
then those students have an advantage.
Yet, if the questions are designed to be a
surprise, the merit of the questions must
be scrutinized.
Picture Dietricht, who walks into his
English 287A/Fem Stud 56/Poli Sci
140/ History 230 C final and sees a ques
tion about something he didn't read,
because his roommate's iguana puked on
his reader. Panic, doom, death, immola
tion. Who is the better for this? Kitty Jo,
sitting next to Dietricht, is better for
this, since her roommate doesn't own an
iguana.
In no way am I blaming the professors
for the cheating problems, but they can
provide the solution. If the exams test a
student's understanding of the material,
then if a student can provide satisfactory
answers, who cares if cheating occurred
or not? If the student can prove through
the examination that the required infor
mation has been learned, then cheating
should not be an issue.
True, in some courses the volume of
objective, factual information is so great
that an exam cannot test it all. Thus, the

professor opts for a representative sam
ple of the information. Here, a passing-on
of test questions will give some an unfair
advantage — a time advantage. This pro
duces a tricky problem, the solution to
which is either a limitation on early
exams or the need for two exam versions.
Now, to grades. Of course a student
who cheats effectively will get a better
grade than a student who simply studies.
My Utopian solution is to have professors
not grade on a curve, comparing one stu
dent to another, but rather to grade on
an absolute scale. If the students get
above a certain score on the exam that
demonstrates sufficient mastery of the
subject, give him an A.
In the end, I realize this is an oversim
plification of a very complex problem, but
I also realize students wijl not stop copy
ing problem sets and lab reports, or to
some degree passing on test questions no
matter what they sign. Perhaps part of
the solution lies in a modification of the
exam questions so that, cheating or no,
the test is still fair.

On the list of things Kenny Mai never
wants to do, getting shot by a Tazer and
meeting a member of the Shining Path
are pretty near the top.
