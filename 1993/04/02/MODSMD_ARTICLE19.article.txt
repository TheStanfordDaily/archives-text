Stanford needs an Asian-American Studies Program

WE THE OFFICERS of the Asian-
American Students' Association
applaud the results of the cam
pus-wide survey reported in the March
29 issue of The Daily, which revealed that
a significant portion of the Stanford stu
dent body favors the establishment of a
degree-granting Asian-American Studies
Program at Stanford. In light of the posi
tive and indubitable results of the survey,
the lack of commitment on the part of
University administration is now espe
cially disturbing. It is crucial that stu
dents not let the initiative die.
According to the published report by
the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Asian-
Americans are percentage-wise the most
rapidly growing minority group in this
country. The importance of their contri
butions to this country can no longer be
ignored. Yet, the role of Asian-Americans
has noticeably been left out of American
history books, let alone the entire cur
riculum of the American education sys
tem. How many students, even those at
Stanford, are aware that Leland Stanford
built his fortune and this university by
exploiting the hundreds of Chinese labor

ers who built his railroad? How many
Americans recognize the fact that the
most decorated regiment in American
military history, the 442 nd of World War
11, was composed almost entirely of
Japanese-Americans, fighting for free
dom abroad while their families were
imprisoned in relocation camps in the
United States?
Instead, the mainstream perception of
Asian-Americans is often not one of hard
working, loyal fellow-Americans, but of
foreigners invading American turf. The
American media's skewed portrayal of
Asian-Americans only furthers these
unfavorable images, thus contributing to
this blaring deficiency in American edu
cation. It seems those who control educa
tion and broadcasting in this country are
comfortable in breeding their own igno
rance.
Opponents to the establishment of
individual ethnic-studies programs have
argued that if the issue is simply address
ing the contribution of each ethnic group,
then why not instead simply focus
change on making the American educa
tional system more holistic, so all ethnic

groups get their share of representation
in the curriculum? This idea, though
noble indeed, is also shortsighted. An
accurate presentation of the Asian-Amer
ican heritage can never be incorporated
into the American education curriculum
unless in-depth scholarly efforts in
Asian-American studies are undertaken.
Such scholarly work can never be real
ized without the establishment of full
fledged, degree-granting programs in
Asian-American studies.
And yet, there is so much more to
Asian-American studies than just teach
ing the contributions of Asian-Ameri
cans. There is so much Asian-Americans
can learn about themselves, and others
can learn about the Asian-American situ
ation in this country. This includes the
dangers of the "model-minority" myth,
the sociological effects of negative media
portrayals and the situations of urban
Asian-communities, whose residents
hover on the edge of poverty.
Already, the UC-Berkeley and UCLA
campuses have established undergradu
ate and/or graduate programs in Asian-
American studies. Undergraduates at

UC-Berkeley can major in Asian-Ameri
can studies and take a wide variety of
courses from distinguished experts in the
field.
Stanford does not offer anything close
to this.
How can Stanford maintain its claim
as the most prestigious university on the
West Coast if it cannot offer the same
educational opportunities as two other
leading institutions? This is especially
disturbing when you consider that Asian-
Americans comprise nearly 25 percent of
the Stanford student body. Yet, only two
faculty members teach courses dealing
with Asian-American studies.
The survey has revealed the shortcom
ings of an administration that has been
slow to recognize the changing social
dynamics of American society and act on
the wishes of Stanford students. It is
time for more initiative and commitment
to establishing a complete Asian-Ameri
can Studies department at Stanford.
