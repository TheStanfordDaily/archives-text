didn't negotiate. He took it on the cheek.
Both of them. So when self-titled Messi
ah David Koresh suddenly held five meet
ings with the high-priced Texas attorney
his mother hired for him, something told
me the prophets had gotten soft.
It's a softness which is slowly creeping
into our culture, making Kenny G perco
late to No. 2 on the Billboard charts. It's
just the kind of edge the Japanese were
looking for.
Society has gotten so soft it has taken
a man — nay, a mayor — like Clint East
wood, and made him as soft as a Denny's
egg and then loaded him down with
Oscars. This kinder, gentler thing is
going to be worse on us than it was on the
Kurds.
All kinds of people, not just arms
hording maniacs, are getting soft.
Charles Schultz — who is still alive —
turned his back on over 50 years of tough,
hardhitting cynicism punctuated by
everyone's favorite monoxodil-needy 10-

year old boy.
On Monday, Charlie Brown hit his
first career home run — a game-winning
home run. And, as children around the
world felt a Little-Engine-that-Could
excitement, one had to wonder if Mr.
Schultz had made some sort of Faustian
promise to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Even college basketball coaches —
long an icon of pioneer ruggedness —
have put on a smiley face for the '90s.
Bobby Cremins, former coach of Georgia
Tech, felt guilty and became coach of
Georgia Tech again, even turning down a
$100,000 pay hike from the University of
South Carolina in the process.
"I felt I had broken my promise and
had deserted them," said the softy. "This
is the most embarrassing moment of my
life." The most embarrassing moment of
his life? This from a man who seriously
considered taking a job with the South
Carolina Gamecocks, where the cheer
leaders wear — and eagerly display for
television cameras — panties that say, on
the backside, "Go Cocks"? Soft. Soft.
Soft. Or maybe not.
It's enough to make you sick. When I
grew up, if you didn't understand the

words to "Come On Eileen," you dealt
with it. Now, MTV prints, in kindly
Romper Room fashion, the words to that
"Informer" song by Snow — as if they
were that good. Hey, a white rapper
everyone can like? Almost enough to
make you pray for the next Marky Mark
album. Licky boom boom down.
Everyone's suddenly backing down,
and no one seems to mind. Jerry Garcia
dropped 50 pounds and said he's getting
off drugs. Dead Heads, instead of feeling
deserted, sat back and hoped Jerry would
avoid foods high in fatty acids. And just
yesterday, the Recording Industry of
America agreed to kowtow to the envi
ronmentalists and abolish the dreaded
"longbox" packaging, as of yesterday.
What would Ayn Rand say?
Even women, who have been battling
softness since they first noticed their
breasts, have gone back to their soft,
gatherer ways. Cosmo editor Helen
Gurley Brown, waiting in an Atlanta
airport during a recent booksigning
tour, was rejected from the Delta club
because she was not a member. So she
broke down and cried until they gave
her a conference room where she could

exercise and take a nap.
Is crying really the Cosmo way to
handle a tough situation?
Wouldn't it have been more appro
priate to: A) Pout your lips seduc
tively, B) Compliment the bell cap
tain on his uniform, C) Expose a
diaphragm holder while fumbling
through your purse, looking for alleged
card or D) Try cradling his testicles to
improve technique.
Being nice has superceded being inter
esting. Alter all, why hurt someone's feel
ings, when, if you simply bore them to
death, they'll go away anyway? Even
though this somehow hasn't worked for
Ross Perot.
After having agreed to remove the
WASPy "H." in front of his name, top
newspaper editors from around the coun
try, in a demonstration of unheard of
flaccidity, flew in to meet with Perot
Wednesday — so he could commence the
charade of announcing he's won't be run
ning in 1996. Of course no one cares, but
wouldn't it be just too rude to tell him?
If people don't snap out of it, geese
aren't going to able to tell the difference

between here and Canada. It's time to
throw a few punches, produce a scathing
sit-com about incest in the Gore family,
do something to re-establish our once
powerful libidos. And theirs.
Be mean to your roommate. Ask your
dentist for one of those red, tablet,
plaque-finding things, call it "candy" and
give it to her after lunch. Make her Teddy
Ruxpin say things like "I slept with your
boyfriend. His penis was smaller than
mine." Wear her underwear during your
period.
It's time to wake up and smell your
self. Then put on some of that Musk
cologne you put away in junior high.
You're worth it, babe.
