## Batters hope to better Bears Three-game 'Big Series' gives young Cardinal a chance to rebound 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Coach Mark Marquess doesn't
want to talk postseason goals with the
Cardinal, nearing the midway point of
the season.
"We don't have to worry about a
goal," Marquess said. "We just have
to put it together and win a game."
Mired in a five-game losing streak,
the Cardinal (14-12 overall, 2-7 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Division)
travels to Evans Diamond in Berkeley
today to begin a three-game series
with California.
Without a doubt, the Golden
Bears are the surprise of the Six-Pac
thus far. Slated to finish last by
almost all preseason prognostica
tors, Cal (19-15, 6-5) is only a game
behind division-leader USC, tied for
second place with Arizona State and
UCLA.
Gone from the Bears' 1992 College
World Series squad are co-Six-Pac
Players of the Year Troy Penix and
Jon Zuber and All-American Matt
Luke. In their place has emerged a
scrappy crew of unheralded players
who are slowly rising to respectability
in the conference.
Cal does not hit particularly well —
it is last in the Six-Pac with a .247
team batting average. Nor is pitching

its strong point. The Bears are fifth in
the division with a 5.16 earned-run
average.
Instead, the Bears have depended
on solid defense and team speed in
their rise to success. Cal has stolen 74
bases in 34 contests, while commit
ting only 45 errors. Stanford, on the
other hand, has swiped only 33 bags
and committed 53 miscues in its 26
games.
Most importantly, the Bears have
won the close ones. California is 14-4
in games decided by two runs or less.
This figure looms largest for the Car
dinal, which has lost its last three
decisions by a total of five runs.
"We have to get a little bit more
consistent if we want to win these
types of games," Marquess said after
Stanford's 6-5 loss to Nevada on Mon
day.

Despite the Cardinal's recent los
ing streak, several hopeful signs have
emerged since Spring Break that sug
gest a turnaround lies in the team's
near future.
Foremost is the increased produc
tion of first baseman Dusty Allen.
Allen, a freshman Ail-American a
year ago, had struggled to find his
stroke for much of the Cardinal's pre
conference schedule. Lately, howev
er, the sophomore has turned things
around, raising his average to .275
with a six-hit performance against
Arizona State last weekend. Allen
leads Stanford with 26 runs batted
in.
"Dusty did a good job driving the
ball all weekend," Marquess said.
"It's definitely an encouraging sign."
Also encouraging is the return of
switch-hitting outfielder Nate Olm
stead. Olmstead, who missed 15
games with a sprained ankle, should
provide the Cardinal with some badly
needed power from the middle of the
lineup.
On the mound, solid outings from
both Greg Mix and Todd Bartels have
also given the team some hope. Mix, a
seldom-used senior righthander,
turned in the best performance of his
career on Sunday, tossing three and
two-thirds scoreless innings of relief
against the Sun Devils.
Bartels, a freshman who has start
ed the bulk of Stanford's non-confer
ence games, allowed only two earned
runs in almost eight innings of work
on Monday.
Stanford can also look to last sea
son for some hope. In a reversal of
roles, it was an unranked Cal squad
that came to Sunken Diamond on the
last weekend of March, wedged in the
basement of the Six-Pac with a 2-8
mark. The Bears promptly swept the
division-leading Cardinal, riding that
sweep to an improbable NCAA berth
and the championship of the East
Regional.
Such parallels, however, do not
hold a lot of weight with Marquess.
"We've got to go out and win some
games before we can worry about any
thing else," he said.
