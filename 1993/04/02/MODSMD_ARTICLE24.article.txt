# Lions, Waves offer a 'spiking' contrast
## No. 2 Cardinal faces best, worst of MPSF 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volley
ball team heads south this
weekend to take on the worst
and the best of the Mountain
Division of the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation. Although
the tendency is to look forward
to Saturday's showdown with
Pepperdine, history warns the
Cardinal not to overlook Friday
night's match against Loyola
Marymount.
"There is no doubt that they
are one of the weaker teams in
the league," said Cardinal
coach Ruben Nieves of the
Lions. "But the last time we
were down there [two years
ago] they beat us in a five-game
match that was probably the
most important match in us
not qualifying for postseason
play ... we have not played
particularly well the last two
times we were down there."
Although in little danger of
not making postseason play
this year, the No. 2 Cardinal
(13-3, 11-2 MPSF) looks to
extend its current seven-game
winning steak against the
Lions (3-10 in MPSF play) in
Gersten Pavilion.
LMU will look to leading-hit
ter Jason McEntee — 10th in
the country with a 5.63 kills
per-game average — and
Wayne Seligson — eighth in the
nation with 2.64 digs per game
— to slow the Cardinal's march
to Firestone Fieldhouse and
the defending NCAA-champion
Waves.
Pepperdine (14-3, 11-3
MPSF) was king of the hill and
owned the nation's No. 1 rank
ing earlier this season after
knocking off UCLA in five
games.
However, the Waves crashed
against streaking San Diego
State a few weeks ago and fell
to third in the country.
The Waves opened the 1993
season by defeating Stanford in
the UC-Santa Barbara tourna
ment in a match that did not
count toward league standings.
Last year they were the Cardi
nal's nemesis, winning two
out-of-three matches, including
a three-game wipeout in the
NCAA championship match

that ended the Cardinal season
on a bitter note.
Pepperdine lost Alon Grin
berg from its championship
team of a year ago, but has
returned the other five starters
as well as lOth-year coach Mav
Dunphy, perhaps their most
valuable asset.
"Some people consider him
the best volleyball coach in the
world," Nieves said. "He
coached our Olympic team in
'88 to a gold medal."
On the court, Tom Sorenson
carries much of the Waves' hit
ting load. Last year's Final
Four MVP, Sorenson fills the
same role for Pepperdine that
Dave Goss does for Stanford.
Sorenson is third in the coun
try with 424 kills (as opposed to
362 for Goss) and second in the
nation with a 7.19 kills-per
game average (as opposed to
6.70 for Goss).
The loss of Grinberg, a swing
hitter who was one of the best
passers in the country, has
resulted in some personnel
shuffling for Pepperdine.
Dunphy moved middle
blocker Duane Cameron to
swing hitter, producing a
slightly bigger, stronger hit
ting team which passes less
consistently.
Another difference between
the Waves of this year and last
year may be found in their
serving. Without Grinberg, an
outstanding jump-server, Pep
perdine has resorted more
often to the float serve.
"It seems like they have
changed their serving strate
gy," Nieves said. "Even Tom
Sorenson, who has a great
jump serve, seems to be relying
more on his float serve this
year."
The Cardinal's current win
streak has been a true team
effort. The middle blocking
quartet of John Bezmalinovic,
Joe Burghardt, Brian Garrett
and John Hribar has a .494 hit
ting percentage, while the
swing hitting trio of Ryan
Moos, Mike Lambert and Bob
Hillman is averaging 9.5 kills
per game, combined.
Setter Canyon Ceman has
added 822 assists to boost his
Stanford career record to
3,614.
