Women's basketball
Stanford center Val Whiting became one
of 10 members of the 1993 Kodak All-Ameri
ca Team, as announced yesterday in Atlanta
at the site of the NCAA Women's Final Four.
Whiting, who is already in Atlanta as one of
five Naismith Award finalists, joined Texas
Tech senior forward Sheryl Swoopes as this
season's only repeat team members, bringing
the all-time total to 27.
Whiting, who last month garnered Pacific
10 Conference Player-of-the-Year honors for
the second consecutive year, now becomes
the fifth-straight Cardinal to earn both hon
ors, following in the footsteps of guards Sonja
Henning (1991) and Jennifer Azzi (1989-90).

Other members of the Kodak team include
California senior guard Milica Vukadinovic,
Mercer senior center Andrea Congreaves,
lowa senior forward Toni Foster, Auburn

Surprisingly, USC's Lisa Leslie, a junior

Williams — both Naismith finalists — did not
make the All-America squad.
