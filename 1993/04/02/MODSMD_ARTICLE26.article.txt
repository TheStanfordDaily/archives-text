# Gymnasts to take next step in title defense
## 
### Sarah Nagae StafF writer 
The final hurdle. That is what
tomorrow's NCAA Western
Regional meet represents for the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
on the road to the NCAA Champi
onships and a possible defense of
its national title.
Fresh from its recent victory at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Championships, the Cardinal
plans to build on its momentum as
the six highest-scoring squads in
the West do battle in Norman,
Okla. The first, second and third
place teams from the Western and
Eastern regions will each advance
to the Finals in Albuquerque, N.M.
two weeks later.
The Cardinal must first concen
trate on this weekend, however.
Nebraska, a traditional power
house, leads the list of opponents
looking to knock Stanford out of
the running early. UCLA, Brigham
Young, California and Oklahoma
will also pose challenges for the
Cardinal.
"This will be one of the toughest
meets of the year," said senior co
captain Jair Lynch. "I think the
competition is going to be really
tight."
Coach Sadao Hamada will be
counting on Lynch, a seasoned
NCAA competitor, to lead the
squad this weekend. Lynch will
perform in all six events along with
junior co-captain Mark Booth and
senior Jeff Bender. Sophomore
Jing Wei-Liang, who has been
recovering from an ankle injury,
will return to action in five events.
"I would like to be 90 percent
this weekend," Hamada said. "We
are aiming for a few less misses
than last meet, but I don't want to

be 100 percent quite yet."
While a first-place finish this
weekend would please both Hama
da and the gymnasts, placing with
in the top three is the team's real
goal.
"We're not really concerned
about anything but qualifying for
the NCAAs right now," said junior
Jason Cohen. "It would be good,
but it is not imperative that we
win."
Based on years of experience in
coaching at such meets, Hamada
knows the competition will be
"pressure-packed." However, he
believes the team's intense train
ing and confidence in its abilities
will enable it to overcome the
added stress factors which accom
pany important competitions.
"At this meet, what you've done
in the earlier part of the season
doesn't mean anything," he said.
"If you screw up, you're out, so we
have to be totally prepared."
Team members who have trav
eled to the NCAA Championships
in past years emphasize the impor
tance of staying self-focused.
"We have to take this meet very
seriously because many of the
other teams think this is a chance
to beat us," Lynch said. "We
shouldn't be concentrating on
Nebraska, but mainly on our
selves."
In comparing this year's team to
that of a year ago, the gymnasts
express confidence in their chances
at a repeat national title, the road
to which leads through this week
end's regional meet.
"From this point on it's just us
â€” that's all we can control," Cohen
said. "If we can manage to block all
those other things out and concen
trate on our performances, that
should be enough."
