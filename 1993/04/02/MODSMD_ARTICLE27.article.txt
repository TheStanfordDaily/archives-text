# Women's season starts again at gymnastics West Regional
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
One thing is certain — the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team will
end its season in Corvallis, Ore.
The question is whether the squad
will finish at the NCAA Western
Regionals tomorrow night or advance
to the NCAA Championships, also
held in Corvallis, April 15 through
17.
Five regional competitions are
held around the country, with seven
teams in each regional.
The winner of each region
advances automatically to the NCAA
Championships, along with the seven
highest-scoring non-winners from
around the nation.
The format this year is different
from that of past years, when NCAA
qualifiers were determined by a sys
tem that took into account both a
team's score in regionals and its per
formance during the regular season.
This year, however, teams get
"new life" at regionals, because only
the 12 teams from around the nation
that score best on April 3 will make it
to the championship meet. Regular
season scores will not count at all.
The "new life" format definitely

helps the unranked Cardinal, whose
regular-season performance fell
somewhat short of its lofty expecta
tions.
The Cardinal is seeded sixth in the
Western Regional, behind host school
and fourth-ranked Oregon State, No.
5 UCLA, No. 16 Washington, No. 17
Cal State-Fullerton and No. 18 Boise
State. Stanford is seeded ahead of
unranked UC-Santa Barbara.
A single outstanding performance,
however, could throw the Cardinal
well into the elite group that makes it
to nationals.
Last year, four teams from the
West, including Stanford, reached the
national championships, and coach
Breck Greenwood thinks that even
though the West is a weaker region
this year, three or four teams should
survive this weekend's first cut.
According to Greenwood, UCLA
and OSU are virtual locks to get to
the round of 12, and he is confident
that Stanford can win the wide-open
battle for third.
"We think we're the third-best
team," he said. "We always go in
ranked sixth (in the region), and we
always finish up third or fourth."
Greenwood added that the Cardi
nal used its spring-break practices to

get over the team's last-place show
ing in the Pacific 10 Championships
on March 12.
"We've really had a good, hard
training time since Pac-lOs," he said.
"The girls had a great mental and
physical effort during spring break."
Sophomore Meegan Lannin
agreed. "Physically, we're ready;
emotionally, we're getting up," she
said.
The team will be further helped by
the return to health of sophomore
Jene Elzie. The 1992 All-American
hyperextended her left knee at the
Pac-10 meet, but she will be back on
vault, bars and beam for regionals.
The Stanford gymnasts, admitted
ly too tense for the Pac-lOs, are going
to Corvallis tomorrow with a new
attitude, succinctly summarized by
sophomore co-captain Katie Clancy.
"We are going to be young, have fun
and go to nationals," Clancy said.
The Cardinal will likely need to
score somewhere around 192.00 in
order to reach the national champi
onships, according to Greenwood.
Stanford scored 191.25 to make it to
nationals last year, and its high score
this season is 191.85.
"If we score 192.00 and don't make it,
then we can't be upset," Greenwood said.
