# Netters go south, face UCLA, USC

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Judgment Day has arrived
for the Cardinal men's tennis
team. Today and tomorrow,
Stanford's players will find out
if they can indeed compete
with the best when they take
on No. 1 UCLA and No. 2
USC, respectively, in Los
Angeles. The squad's perfor
mances against the Southern
California powerhouses will be
better predictors of Cardinal
success this season than all of
its previous conditioning, tour
naments and dual matches put
together.
Junior Rob Devens noted
that despite the team's
impressive record (12-2), "the
real test is coming this week
end. We're going to see where
we really are in the season."
Although returning to cam
pus with a 14-2 record would
be nice, it is not coach Dick
Gould's top priority. "This is
just a step along the way," he
said. "We're hoping to play
tough and competitive but
within our capabilities. If we
do that, we'll have good match
es, but if we don't, they'll blow
us out."
Five returning Stanford
starters have clear memories
of last year's nightmarish
blowout at UCLA (which
ended the Cardinal's perfect
season record), so the likeli
hood of another blowout would
seem slim.
The Bruins, who lost many
starters to graduation last
year, came close to being upset

last month by unranked Ari
zona before squeaking by with
a 5-4 win. In fact, between the
inexperience of the UCLA
squad and Stanford's hunger
for revenge, today's match
may hand the Bruins their
first loss of the season.
The Trojans, known for
their extremely talented dou
bles teams, will be at a slight
disadvantage with several
players injured. Yet with six
returning starters, the Trojans
should still be strong oppo
nents.
Gould feels that the Cardi
nal's doubles style is geared
toward teams like USC. "We
concentrate on working the
points . . . using lobs and being
patient [rather than trying to]
beat the other guys to the net,"
he said. "Using the right tacti
cal choices allows you to com
pensate for your weaknesses
and capitalize on your
strengths."
One final Cardinal asset is
its continuing good health.
Although the squad incurred a
few minor injuries during the
first half of the season, the
Stanford men are healthy and
in good shape after a hellish
week of conditioning over
spring break. The blessing of
one rainy day in that span gave
the team a brief respite.
"The guys are mostly leg
tired but they survived it
well," Gould said. "From now
on health is a key factor. It will
be a primary concern for the
next six weeks as we continue
to prepare (for postseason
play)."
