# Cardinal back on track in Sacramento
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After dismal finishes in the Pacific 10
Conference last year, the Stanford men's
and women's track and field teams will try
to rebound this year, beginning with the
Panther Invitational in Sacramento this
Saturday.
The Invite will be their second meet of
the year, and coach Vin Lananna has his
sights set on getting a good portion of his
athletes qualified for next month's Pac-10
championship meet in Berkeley.
Presently, Stanford has qualified eight
men and eight women for the Pac-lOs, but
Lananna is hoping to field a team of 18 to
20 women and 16 to 18 men when the
championships roll around.
On the men's side, Lananna will be rely
ing on the strength of Cardinal throwers
Pat Stowell, who finished fifth in last year's
discus event, and Matt Karsevar, who
placed 12th. Senior John Fowler, who won
the discus at last week's Stanford Track
and Field Invitational, is also a leading con
tender for a Pac-10 berth.

Travis Clark, last week's runaway victor
in the high jump, will join pole vaulter
Jamie Marek, rounding out a strong Stan
ford team on the field.
In the racing events, Gary Stolz, the No.
2 finisher at this year's NCAA cross-coun
try championships, has opted to redshirt
this season due to a sore Achilles tendon. In
his place, veterans Dave Scudamore and
Mike Reilly will set the pace, as the Cardi
nal continues to boast a strong distance
squad.
Lananna is also in the process of devel
oping a core of short sprinters, but for now
the bright spot is freshman Rene Rodriguez
in the 400 and 200-meter dashes.
For the women, throwers Jen
McCormick, Sue Demars, Debbie Temple
ton and Jessica Alderman will lead the way
in the shotput, discus and javelin events.
On the track, the Cardinal will try to
compensate for the loss of Olympians
Chryste Gaines and Jackie Edwards, both
of whom graduated last year. Gaines and
Edwards accounted for more than half of
Stanford's points at the Pac-10 Champi
onships in 1992.

"We do have our work cut out for us,"
Lananna said.
However, his best bet for this year will be
senior captain Rhonda Oliver, who posted
impressive marks in her 100, 200 and 400-
meter races last season. The trio of Louise
Watson, winner of the NCAA District-8
Regional cross country title earlier this
year, Melissa Freeberg and Dena Dey will
solidify the distance events. Sophomore
Christy Boyd is also expected to place well
in the 100 and 400-meter hurdles.
"We're looking for some very good indi
vidual performances at the meet, and we'll
lay the foundation with bright spots and
talented performers," Lananna said. "That
way, we'll put ourselves in position to
develop a very strong team down the line
once we get a few good freshman classes to
complement the accomplished upperclass
men."
After the Panther Invitational, the Car
dinal heads home to host an all-comers
meet next Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
All competitors can walk-on and race, while
the Cardinal squad continues to reach for
its Pac-10 qualifying marks.
