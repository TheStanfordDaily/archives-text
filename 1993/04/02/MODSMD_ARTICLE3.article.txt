# Return of the F?
## Faculty Senate survey asks if grading policies are too lenient 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Noting dropped classes on tran
scripts, limiting pass/no credit
courses and bringing back the F
grade are among the options listed
in a Faculty Senate survey distrib
uted to faculty this week.
All faculty members are being
asked if they favor adopting
stricter grading policies in re
sponse to complaints that the ex
isting rules are too lenient, accord
ing to Gail Mahood, the chair of
the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal.
"I can't predict what the re
sults will be," said Mahood, an as
sociate geology professor. It is pos
sible that there are "just a few
loud, complaining voices," she
said.
She added that the committee
will not necessarily follow popular
sentiment. Even if, for example,
"60 percent of professors and fac
ulty say 'We want to reinstate the
F, " the committee may decide not
to propose the change.
Any revisions in the grading
policy must be approved by the en
tire senate before taking effect.
Mahood said there is no timetable
for presenting the results of the

survey â€” which faculty must turn
in by April 12.
"Certainly there would be no
recommendation that would hap
pen before next fall," she said.
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright,
a committee member, said he per
sonally believes the current policy
is fine. But he said that among
some faculty members there is "a
feeling that some of the students
are exploiting the system."
The three-page survey asks if
the University should reinstate
the F and record the median grade
for large classes next to the stu
dent's grade.
It also asks for faculty opinion
on the possibility of imposing lim
its on the percentage of classes a
student can take for a passing or
satisfactory grade and requiring
that distribution requirements be
taken for a grade.
Other questions deal with mak
ing transcripts more reflective of
academic history by leaving "no
credits" on transcripts, recording
dropped classes with a "W" for
withdrawn and indicating when a
class was retaken for a better
grade.
Even before the results are in,
