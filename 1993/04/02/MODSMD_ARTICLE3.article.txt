# Return of the F?
## Faculty Senate survey asks if grading policies are too lenient 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Noting dropped classes on tran
scripts, limiting pass/no credit
courses and bringing back the F
grade are among the options listed
in a Faculty Senate survey distrib
uted to faculty this week.
All faculty members are being
asked if they favor adopting
stricter grading policies in re
sponse to complaints that the ex
isting rules are too lenient, accord
ing to Gail Mahood, the chair of
the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal.
"I can't predict what the re
sults will be," said Mahood, an as
sociate geology professor. It is pos
sible that there are "just a few
loud, complaining voices," she
said.
She added that the committee
will not necessarily follow popular
sentiment. Even if, for example,
"60 percent of professors and fac
ulty say 'We want to reinstate the
F, " the committee may decide not
to propose the change.
Any revisions in the grading
policy must be approved by the en
tire senate before taking effect.
Mahood said there is no timetable
for presenting the results of the

survey — which faculty must turn
in by April 12.
"Certainly there would be no
recommendation that would hap
pen before next fall," she said.
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright,
a committee member, said he per
sonally believes the current policy
is fine. But he said that among
some faculty members there is "a
feeling that some of the students
are exploiting the system."
The three-page survey asks if
the University should reinstate
the F and record the median grade
for large classes next to the stu
dent's grade.
It also asks for faculty opinion
on the possibility of imposing lim
its on the percentage of classes a
student can take for a passing or
satisfactory grade and requiring
that distribution requirements be
taken for a grade.
Other questions deal with mak
ing transcripts more reflective of
academic history by leaving "no
credits" on transcripts, recording
dropped classes with a "W" for
withdrawn and indicating when a
class was retaken for a better
grade.
Even before the results are in,
the survey is already controver
sial. Education and Psychology
Prof. John Krumboltz said he was
upset by the wording of the sur
vey and the assumptions behind
it.
"All the options that were pro
posed were policies that were in
effect two decades ago," he said.
"It is either keep the status quo
or go back to the way things were
in the 19705."
The grading policy changed in
the early 1970s to turn the tran
script into more of a record of
achievement rather than a record
of all the courses a student
attempted. The F and D grades
were eliminated and the drop
deadline was extended, among
other changes.
"The (survey) questions . . .
begin with a headline that pre
supposes the answer," Krumboltz
said. He added that the questions
are also "worded in a prejudicial
way."
One section has a headline that
associates the pass/no credit
option with grade inflation and a
preamble that presumes that a
high proportion of A grades is a
bad thing, Krumboltz said. The
question then asks, "Do you agree
that the preponderance of A
grades makes the indication and
reward of truly excellent student
performances difficult?"
"If anybody answers 'no' to
that question it will be a big sur
prise," he said. "The structure
leads to saying 'yes'."

Mahood, however, defended
the questionnaire, explaining
that the committee "made a tacti
cal decision early on" to look at
specific things that are repeatedly
brought up at senate meetings or
in conversations.
"We don't have people stand
ing up in the Faculty Senate and
saying 'Get rid of the D.' The
main complaints were in the
other direction," she said.
However, she did admit that
"the alternatives given are
toward a grading policy that is
less liberal than the one we have
now."
The senate voted on Nov. 12 to
ask for the review of the grading
policy. Biological Sciences Prof.
Robert Simoni made the motion
for the re-evaluation, saying "we
approach a point when the tran
script is not only a record of
accomplishment but has a little
bit of deception."
Krumboltz, however, dis
agreed. "If F grades are reinstat
ed, it will discourage people from
taking risks to learn new things,"
he said. "You are teaching people
under the threat of eternal
damnation. An F grade on your
transcript follows you for the rest
of your life."
Although grade inflation is a
problem, Wright said "radical
restructuring of grades is a cure
worse than the disease." But he
added he might favor some limi
tations on the faculty-elected sat
isfactory grade, which is current
ly used in 16 percent of all classes.
The new survey is not the first
attempt to gauge faculty opinion
in recent years. In a 1988 survey
by the committee — to which less

than a quarter of all faculty mem
bers responded — 59 percent
favored the return of the F, 19
percent favored the present range
of grades and 10 percent would
have liked to eliminate the D.

Students will be consulted
before any recommendations are
made, Mahood said. The commit
tee has three student members,
and Mahood said she also hopes
to talk with student groups.
