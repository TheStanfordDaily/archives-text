# Crew faces motley challenge in San Diego
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's and women's crew
teams head down to San Diego this week
end for what appears to be an early-season
confrontation with some of the nation's
powerhouses.
Harvard and Pennsylvania, perennial
top finishers, lead a list of impressive
teams the Stanford men's crew faces at
Mission Bay in the San Diego Crew Classic.
Stanford also looks to challenge Yale, Syra
cuse, Wisconsin and Washington, four
other quality crews. California, Long Beach
State and Florida Institute of Technology
round out the field.
"This will be a good indication of what
the power of the East Coast will be like this
year," said men's coach Wieslaw Kujda.
"We take each race step by step, but we will
be trying to be as fast as we can for this

part of the season."
Kujda believes his team must keep this
regatta in perspective.
Top finishes this early in the season can,
but do not always, equate to a successful
season.
"For most of the eastern schools, this is
their first race," Kujda said. "Although it is
just the beginning of the season, good fin
ishes for us could set the atmosphere for
the season."
The Cardinal women also face stiff com
petition as they row against Radcliffe, Cor
nell, Northeastern, Syracuse and UC-Davis
in their first heat on Saturday. The top
three teams will advance, placing Stanford
in a tough battle for third in Sunday's final
with Northeastern and Syracuse. Long
standing powers Cornell and Radcliffe look
to have a good hold on first and second
place.
Washington, Cal, Wisconsin and Yale are

the other crews Stanford may have to face
if the Cardinal advances to the finals.
"We don't want to mess up the whole
season by concentrating too much on this
one race," said women's coach Wendy
Davis. "We're seeing the best crews in the
nation, but if we put too much stock into
this race, it can foul us up for the season."
The 2,000-meter course is a difficult one
for low qualifiers, according to Davis. The
outer lanes of the six-lane course are affect
ed much more by the wind than lanes one
or two, giving the top qualifiers an even
greater advantage.
The junior varsity women's crew team
faces the same field as the varsity squad.
However, the freshman crew is in a field of
18 boats in the qualifying heats, with only
the top two advancing to the finals. The
freshmen figure to face tough competition
from Washington, Washington State and
Orange Coast College.
