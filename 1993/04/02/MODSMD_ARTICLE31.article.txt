# Women's tennis hopes to bounce Bruins, trounce Trojans at home
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
With less than half the season to go, Stan
ford's women's netters seem poised to recap
ture the NCAA title they owned for most of
the 1980s. That is, if the injuries don't get
them first.
The No. 1 Cardinal (17-1, 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference) will enter this weekend's excit
ing series with No. 6 USC and No. 13 UCLA
without redshirt freshman Kim Shasby,
Stanford's No. 3 singles player. Shasby
missed the team's match against No. 15 Ten
nessee last week with a strained muscle in
her foot, and will not play in this weekend's
matches.
"The injuiy to Kim Shasby is problem No.
1 for us right now," said Stanford coach
Frank Brennan. "Problem No. 2 is Kim
Shasby's injury, and problem No. 3 is Kim
Shasby's injury too."
The loss of Shasby in the starting lineup
will mean that sophomore Emma Wood
house will start in the No. 6 position for the
Cardinal against the Trojans today and the
Bruins tomorrow. Woodhouse has played at
No. 6 since Stanford's loss to No. 2 Florida
last week, and Brennan expects her to rise to
the occasion.
"One of the things we're blessed with on
this team is depth," Brennan said. "Emma
played at No. 6 at Florida, so she's ready for
anything tomorrow."
Brennan is quick to mention that despite
their performance in recent years, the Tro
jans are once again a team with its eyes set on
the national championship.
"They're back — they're a real good team
this year," Brennan said. "They and Cal are
just going to give us fits. I'm glad we get

them here before we have to play them in
LA."
After today's contest with USC, the Car
dinal will face the Bruins in the second part
of this weekend's Pac-10 twin bill. Despite
UCLA's No. 13 ranking, the Bruins are only
5-8 overall this year, including a dismal 1-4 in
the Pac-10. In addition, UCLA will likely
have a difficult time of it Saturday, missing
No. 1 Keri Phebus and No. 2 Cami Foley,
who remain home in Los Angeles with the
flu.
"They're just an underachieving team
this year, but at any time they can step up
and bite you," Brennan said. "We play them
three times this year, and it's always hard to
beat a team three times — they figure you
out after a while and find a way to get you."
Brennan hopes to use last week's loss to
Florida as a rallying point for his squad in its
final three weeks of competition. He also
notes that avoiding injuries will be the key to
the Cardinal's success at next month's
NCAA Championships in Tallahassee.
"After Florida, the team wasn't really
down," Brennan said. "They showed a lot of
feistiness and determination, and they're
anxious to go back down there and shut that
crowd up in the NCAAs."
"We're going to have a tough three weeks
coming up," he said. "Cal is hell on wheels —
they're going to be pumped up for us, and all
seven matches we play are against top-10
teams. I just hope for the best, hope we stay
healthy and get a little bit of luck, and that's
what we'll need to get the championship this
year."
Today's match against USC starts at 1:30
p.m. at Stanford Tennis Stadium, while Sat
urday's match against UCLA begins at 1
p.m. Admission for both matches is free.
