Warning: working out can be hazardous to
your health.
No, I'm not talking about your average, every
day heart attacks, sprained ankles or shin splints.
I mean full-blown, all-out, life-threatening dan
ger. Bullet holes through the head. Slit throats.
An occasional stake through the heart.
Those of you who have stepped foot in Ford
Center lately may know what I mean.
What was once a minor revolution has
become a full-blown war, and Ford is one of the
war zones. Women (and men) in spandex and
lycra are taking up arms against anyone who
gives the least hint of holding them back in their
search for physical perfection.
I have to admit, I am not totally innocent. I'm
there almost everyday; I, too, keep a close eye on
the waiting lists and snarl possessively at any
suspicious characters who look like they might
try to go in out of turn. I haven't killed anyone
yet. Still, it's getting a little out of hand.
The first time I wandered into Ford, all dewy
eyed and naive, I thought I could just show up,
hop on a Stairmaster and be out of there in
under an hour. Fat chance. The sight of hordes
of people waiting for a pitiful number of
machines (one of which is invariably broken)
was a shock to my innocent eyes.
Now I know. I know to bring CIV reading to
do while I'm waiting. I know to allow at least a
two-hour time block for a 30-minute workout. I
know not to even think about asking if I could go
ahead of someone in line. But still...
Once, I was minding my own business, inno
cently waiting my turn to ride a stationary bike
(usually a safe bet for shorter lines). Someone
got off, and I stood up to see who was next on the
list. The name said "Jeff," so I assumed a man
would be getting on the bike. When I saw a

woman getting on instead, I asked the guy sit
ting next to me, "Are you Jeff? 'Cause if you are,
you're next."
Big mistake. I had naively assumed that this
woman would realize she had gone out of turn
and relinquish the machine. Instead, she
attacked me, shouting it was her turn, she
wouldn't "cheat," and I should mind my own
business.
I thought that Jeff might back me up, but I
was wrong. He was apparently as frightened of
this woman as I was, and simply shrugged his
shoulders.
When the woman eventually left, I walked
over to get on the bike. Then from across the
room, she comes running toward me, waving
her arms and shouting, "No, no! I'm not done,
it's not your turn yet!"
I wasn't just embarrassed, I was downright
scared— there was, in my mind at least, a real
possibility my life was going to end then and
there. Apparently, she had paused the bike, so
she could sign up to use the Stairmaster after
she was done.
Far be it from me to judge, but it all seems
more than a little ridiculous. I just can't believe
how nasty people get over the use of these

machines. Ironically enough, the people who are
the most upset over the whole situation are the
ones who have the least need for these extra few
minutes of exertion.
I have to think something is wrong with our
ideas about health and fitness when these
already rail-thin people are fighting each other
over who gets to use a machine that allows one
to walk up stairs for hours— without getting
anywhere.
I'm no better— I ride my bike over to Ford so
I can ride a stationary bike for miles inside. No
one questions the logic behind exercise
machines, but if you think about it, they're silly.
Why in the world would anyone want to ride a
bike, usually a mode of transportation, that
doesn't move? Or climb up stairs that lead to
nowhere? Rowing and cross-country ski
machines go to a whole new level of surrealism
— rowing on land and skiing indoors, in the
summer even. And still getting nowhere.
This leads me to wonder, what did people do
before these machines existed? Was everyone
overweight? People haven't always consciously
exercised. Why do we have to "work out" when
previous generations did not? Exactly how
sedentary are we? Maybe I've been reading too
much Rousseau— all this stuff about "natural
man" is getting to me.
I keep getting these urges to abandon the
dorm and Food Service, run to the woods and be
a hunter-gatherer. Berries and bark are fat-free,
right?
I could live in a cave, drink from streams and
hang out. No more papers, no more classes, no
more worries— except for the occasional wild
boar that might wander by.
It couldn't be any more dangerous than work
ing out at Ford.
