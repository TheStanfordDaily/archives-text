# A 						tour de force of critics in flaky show-biz fiasco
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
A few weeks ago, the San
Francisco Chronicle ran a full
page ad for the new Michael
Douglas movie, "Falling Down."
Flanking the picture of Douglas
(taken from the front, thankful
ly) were the gushy words of 10
critics who collectively managed
to call the film "explosive,"
"gripping," "stunning,"
"provocative," "heart-pound
ing," and of course, "taut."
Above Douglas were the words of
the übiquitous Pat Collins of
WWOR-TV, who allowed that
"Falling Down" is the "first real
movie of the '905."
Could it be that Collins didn't
see a "real" movie this decade,
until February?
Of course not. Collins lives in
the world of reviewing, which
has no connection to reality any
way.
This leads to the questions:
who are these critics, these pro
fessional brown-nosers who live
off the plunder of movie studios,
record labels and publishers —
who direct the winds of taste,
who pollute our media with mis
erably effusive prose, who reduce
the American cultural conscious
ness to the level of bite-sized
blurbs?
Who are these people who are
allowed to put 32 movies on their
year-end top-10 lists?
And most importantly, how
did they fool us all into wasting a
night at Flicks watching "Single
White Female"?
The Oscars bring out the
stars, they say, and the critics,
too. Every type — from film to
food to fashion — gets column
space the day after the Awards
are handed out.
Unfortunately, the lot of
them could not come up with

more than five words to describe
the Best Picture, "Unforgiven."
The Associated Press, in its
recap of Oscar night, called
"Unforgiven" a "brooding West
ern"; and The New York Times,
ever-comprehensive, described
the movie as a "brooding, somber
revisionist western." (The San
Jose Mercury News chose the
more off-beat, but clumsy
description, "dark-tinged.")
Movie critics are nothing, if
not unoriginal.
Two prime examples of review
ing ineptitude are Rolling Stone's
Peter Travers and Time's
Richard Corliss. Their only prob
lem is that they never do what a
critic's job title suggests they
should: criticize.
Travers, for example, has
raved about 21 of the 26 movies
he's reviewed this year, a robust
81 percent. That means — for
those scoring at home — it is
umpteen times more likely for
Mr. Freeloader to like a movie
than it was for the Stanford
men's basketball team to make a
free throw.
Time's Corliss is like the guy
who does the "recommended
reading" in CIV — and lets
everyone know about it.
In a review of Shawn Colvin's
album "Fat City," Corliss, in the
short span of four paragraphs,
drops the names of Annie
Lennox, Bonnie Raitt, Mary
Chapin-Carpenter, Anita O'Day,
Carolyn Hester and Joni
Mitchell.
He also demonstrates two of
the most annoying habits of
modern critics: turning proper
names into adjectives (Colvin is
"irresistibly Beatlesesque" and
"swells into Faustian rage") and
writing in French ("Colvin has
paid beaucoup dues").
Mon Dieu.
Someone save us.
