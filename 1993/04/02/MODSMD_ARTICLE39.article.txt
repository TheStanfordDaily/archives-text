# Latvian minister talks of ethnic strife, democracy
## 
### June Mølgaard Staff writer 
Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Georges Andrejevs emphasized the need for
Russian troops to withdraw from his country
in a speech yesterday at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Andrejevs, who will meet with Secretary of
State Warren Christopher next week, also
defended Latvia's widely criticized ethnic
policies that call for the repatriation of non-
Latvians.
Defining one of Latvia's greatest prob
lems as the continued presence of approxi
mately 20,000 active Russian troops on Lat
vian soil, he said, "The United States is the
only real power which can influence Russia's

attitude towards these small independent
states."
While no agreement for a withdrawal has
been reached yet, he said even an agree
ment wouldn't guarantee that it would be
fulfilled. "Because of the (large neighboring
Russian) military presence, we are very vul
nerable," Andrejevs said.
"We welcome western efforts to encourage
democracy in Russia," he said.
Concerning the Latvian government's
efforts to repatriate non-Latvians, Andrejevs
suggested that U.S. criticism of Latvia's eth
nic policies strengthens factions opposed to
the country's democracy.
He contended that the United States' con
cern about human-rights violations is unwar
ranted. He said Latvia was just asking Russia

to accept these people as its citizens.
"This is a unique situation," Andrejevs
insisted. "We have adopted a constitutional
law which concerns the rights of non-citizens.
We have no desire to repatriate by force."
Andrejevs said future citizenship wouldn't
be determined by ethnicity, but by each indi
vidual's citizenship status. But he added that
minorities in Latvia couldn't be allowed to
exceed a certain percentage — "not more
than half," he said.
Many non-Latvians are in Latvia illegal
ly, and are draining the country's resources,
he said, adding that many are hard-liners
trying to thwart the democratic process.
"Hardliners haven't given up hope on reim
posing communist rule in Latvia,"
Andrejevs said.
