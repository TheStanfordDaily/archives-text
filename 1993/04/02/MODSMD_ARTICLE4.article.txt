# Robinson, Lantana and Casta√±o each gain a focus

### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
In a spurt of "focus frenzy," Residential
Education is creating three new focus
houses for the 1993-94 academic year.
The upper-class dormitories to be con
verted into focus houses include Robinson,
which will change from the gender studies
house to the "environmental issues"
house; Lantana will focus on community
service; and Castano will concentrate on
world affairs.
Res Ed Director Alice Supton attributes
the increase in focus houses to a recogni
tion of the knowledge and resources resi
dent fellows provide to students through
out-of-class interaction.

"The focus houses enable resident fel
lows to use their interest and expertise and
organize a portion of the house's program,"
Supton said. "I envision all upper-class
houses with resident fellows will eventual
ly have some sort of focus."
By assigning each house a focus, Res Ed
hopes "to give the houses more character,
more definition and more vitality," she
said.
Lantana will encourage students to per
form a variety of community service activi
ties.
"I think community service means
bringing the talents and abilities we have
and sharing it with the others of communi
ty," said Communication Prof. Jeremy
Cohen, who is an RF at Lantana. "We

should use [students' talents] to tie the
campus with the outside world."
Cohen and his wife Catherine Jordan,
who has worked with the Haas Center for
Public Service for five years, plan to create
a major project that students will complete
over the course of the year.
Possible ideas for the project include
adopting a school and working with the
children there, aiding the poor in local shel
ters or providing support services to the
general public.
Castano, the future world-affairs dorm,
hopes to attract students who have done
coursework or are majoring in internation
al relations as well as those who have lived
abroad.
History Prof. Norman Naimark, the RF

at Castano, hopes to make the house a
venue for issues such as human rights vio
lations, questions of American interven
tion and the democratization of formerly
communist countries closer to campus.
"One of the things Stanford wants to do
is become a world university, and part of
that is becoming conscious of [world af
fairs]," Naimark said.
The new environmental focus at Robin
son was formed after a number of student
organizations, such as Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford, expressed
interest in an environmentally focused
dorm.
