# Grade inflation explained
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Twenty percent of grades
given by Stanford professors
were once lower than a B, but
radical grading policy changes
have helped shrink that num
ber to just 8 percent today.
The "grade inflation" came
at the heels of revisions during
the early 1970s that moved
from recording all attempted
courses to recording only suc
cessfully completed courses,
according to a report released
by the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement.
The report, distributed to
faculty members with a survey
reviewing the current grading
system, looks at more than 20
years of grades from the
schools of Humanities and Sci
ences, Earth Science, Educa
tion and Engineering.
The results: A's make up 35
percent of all grades, B's com
prise 28 percent and only 8 per
cent of students earn C's and D's.
Professors have never given
a large number of below average
grades, however — even when
F's were an option they were

held to 1 percent, and the num
ber of D's has shrunk from just
3 percent to today's 1 percent.
' The real difference is with
the number of C's. Totaling 16
percent before the policy
changes, they now make up
only 7 percent of all grades.
In addition, since the F was
dropped, the number of "satis
factories" — mandatory
pass/no credit grades — has
also changed, increasing from
about 5 percent to 13 percent,
according to the report.
The summary also said that
only about 4 percent of all
grades given are "no credit."
However, there is still some
faculty concern about student
abuse of this grading option.
"The issue most cited is the
paradoxical incentive for stu
dents to fail a course rather
than have a low passing grade
recorded on their transcript,"
the report said.
The report attributes about
one-third of all no credits to
students who try to "maximize
units and/or manipulate their
grades by taking a heavy load
and then dropping a course in
which they are doing poorly."
