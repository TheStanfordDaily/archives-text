# 'The drug war is a total failure'
## Hoover scholars advocate changes in U.S. drug policy 
### Michael McCarroll Staff writer 
A resolution signed by Hoover Institution Fel
lows Milton Friedman and Joseph McNamara
that calls for sweeping changes in national drug
policy gained important support yesterday as Dis
tinguished Hoover Fellow George Shultz formal
ly added his name to the growing list of national
figures calling for an end to the 20-year old drug
war.
The authors of the resolution are not calling for
the legalization of drugs, but rather for the appoint
ment of an "objective commission" to recommend
new approaches to the drug problem "in order to re
duce the harm our current policies are causing."
"The drug war is a total failure," said McNamara,
who has researched drug policy extensively. "It is an
irrational policy, doomed to increase racial hostility
and violent crime, and completely ineffectual in
fighting drug abuse."
The recently proposed resolution cites the enor
mous financial cost, the loss of civil liberties, huge
untaxed revenues and a "cycle of hostility" spawned
by current efforts as reasons to reconsider a policy
that has gone largely unquestioned for more than 20
years.
It also notes that drug-war hysteria has stymied
programs that provide sterile needles to curtail the

spread of AIDS and has blocked
the use of drugs for valuable med
ical research.
The resolution came out of a
February 26 conference held at
the Hoover Institution by an eclec
tic group of public leaders includ
ing Friedman, a conservative
economist and Nobel laureate, for
mer San Jose police chief McNa
mara, Orange County Superior
Court Judge James Gray, as well
as members of the clergy, psychia-

trists and educators from around the country.
Since the meeting, the resolution has also been
signed by Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, Hewlett-
Packard founder David Packard and Shultz, among
others.
The term "drug war" was first used in 1972 by
Richard Nixon. Since then, Presidents Reagan and
Bush have committed $22.6 billion and $42.5 billion,
respectively, on what McNamara calls "bipartisan
madness" and a "futile effort."
Along with changing the government's policy,
McNamara said he wants to change the role that po
lice officers play in enforcing existing drug laws. Mc-
Namara said there is a near unanimous consensus
