# Printer foils Daily for April Fools'
## 
### 
The joke's on us.
Due to a printer's error, the tra
ditionally fictitious April Fools'
cover page of yesterday's Daily
was switched with the true front
page, which was supposed to ap
pear on page 3. Apparently, the
fake one appeared so realistic,
even the printer was confused.

Thus, the disclaimer that ap
peared on page 2 referred to sto
ries that actually ran on page 3, in
stead of page 1. Please disregard
the stories on page 3 as false. All
stories on page 1, to the best of our
knowledge, are true.
In addition, the cover of Inter
mission, which proclaimed,

"Grateful Dead Return," was also
ajoke.
While this may have confused
— albeit more than we intended —
a few of our readers, no one was
more surprised than we at The
Daily.
Apologies to the Dead Heads.
Happy April Fools'.
