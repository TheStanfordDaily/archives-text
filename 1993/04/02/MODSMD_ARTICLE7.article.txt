# Italian socialist speaks his mind
## Gino Giugni sees change as key to Italy's future 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Italy's scandal-ridden politi
cal system will have to undergo a
sea of change if it is to survive,
Italian Socialist leader Gino
Giugni said in a discussion at
Casa Italiana last night.
Giugni, a senator who two
weeks ago was named president
of Italy's Socialist Party, said the
kickbacks and corruption that
have rocked Italian politics are
creating deep public resentment
against the ruling political par
ties. "Therefore, the will to sur
vive for the parties means to
have deep changes or death," he
said.
The senator was in the Bay
Area for a UC-Berkeley confer
ence on Italian politics. He was
one of five Italian political schol
ars who took part in the discus
sion "Italy after the Collapse of
Communism."
The Socialists were the third
most popular political party in
last year's election, before the
scandal broke. But, Giugni said
his party has been hit hardest by
the Tangentopoli — roughly
translated, "Kickback City" —

cians.
"Operation Clean Hands," the
judicial investigation of the gov
ernment, has implicated about
1,000 politicians and business
men, including 10 percent of
Italy's parliament members.
While Giugni said fears that
the political unrest would lead
to a military coup were
unfounded, he said major
changes in the way Italy is gov
erned are imminent.
A bicameral committee is cur
rently working on constitutional
reform, he said, and a referen
dum on changing the electoral
system for the Italian senate is
two weeks away. If the senate
changes its electoral system,
Giugni said the Chamber of
Deputies — the other legislative
house — will very likely change to
the same system.

One result of Tangentopoli is
the weakening of current political
parties, along with the formation
of new parties, including more
locally and ethnically based par
ties, Giugni said.
Giugni said the crisis stemmed
partially from Italy's electoral
system, in which the winning
party seldom, if ever, has a msgor
ity, and overtly divided parties
are in fact closely tied in a cooper
ative ruling class. To change this,
he called for a "deep change in
the electoral system" to a new
system "where you have winners
and losers" in elections and rota
tion in office.
He said that such scandals are
not new to Italian politics, but
have recently come into view
after the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
"The Cold War had covered
many shortcomings of European
democracies (and) also American
democracy," he said. "Now every
thing has come to float following
the collapse of the wall."
