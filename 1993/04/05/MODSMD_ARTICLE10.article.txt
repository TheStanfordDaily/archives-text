Waco cult agrees to end standoff
WACO, Texas (AP) â€” Cult leader David
Koresh and his followers will end an armed
standoff with federal authorities sometime
after the group celebrates Passover, two attor
neys said after meeting with Koresh yesterday.
Shortly after the meeting, a man who wasn't
identified left the heavily fortified compound,
the first person to do so in nearly two weeks.
"They're ready for this to be over, but they
have a very important agenda with Passover
and their holiday," attorney Dick DeGuerin
said after meeting with Koresh for six hours
yesterday.
But DeGuerin and attorney Jack Zimmer
mann hedged on exactly when the standoff
would end, saying the Branch Davidian cult's
celebration of Passover doesn't coincide with
the Jewish observance, which begins tonight.
"If you grew up knowing what Passover was
in the Jewish faith, there is a totally different
emphasis in their faith," said Zimmermann,
who accompanied DeGuerin to the meeting.
"Right now, they believe there is a higher law
that they must follow . . . Were we not on the
eve of Passover, they'd be out by now."
