VANCOUVER, British Columbia
(AP) — President Clinton cemented
a "new democratic partnership" with
Boris Yeltsin yesterday, extending
$1.6 billion in aid and pledging a
review of Cold War restrictions that
inhibit trade and other ties between
the United States and Russia.
The aid plan includes $690 million
in direct grants, $700 million in grain
and other food credits and $230 mil
lion in other assistance.
Yeltsin pronounced himself "fully
satisfied" with the results of the
weekend summit that stressed eco
nomics rather than the thorny arms
control issues of the past.
The two men seemed to get along
well, striding side-by-side into the
summit-ending news conference and
shaking hands cordially afterwards.
"We're both people's presidents,"
said Clinton. "We have a lot in com
mon in that regard."
The president said he and congres
sional leaders had already agreed to
make a thorough review of Cold War
restrictions that apply to Russia

"even though it is now a democratic
state" and lift as many as possible.
Clinton lavishly praised Yeltsin
and said it was the "high duty of all
the world's democracies" to assist
Russian reforms "in their new hour
of challenge."
He said the $1.6 billion in U.S. aid
would provide "immediate and tangi
ble results for the Russian people,"
and benefit Americans as well. The
package includes direct grants and
credits for the purchase of food and
other goods.
"We will expand exchanges
between American farmers, business
people, students and others with
expertise working directly with the
Russian people," he said.
Clinton said there would be a spe
cial effort to invest in Russia's oil and
gas industries, an effort overseen by
Vice President A 1 Gore.
The summit gave Yeltsin a sizable
package of U.S. aid — though far less
than Russia needs — before an April
25 referendum that will determine if
Yeltsin's power and program have

the support of the Russian people.
Clinton emphasized that the U.S.
aid package — $1.6 billion in grants
and credits — was only a first step.
"We will not stand on the sidelines,"
he said.
Administration officials said the
the package uses funds that have
already been appropriated by
Congress, but had been bottled up.
"In effect, all of these programs could
begin tomorrow," an administration
official said.
The package was swollen by $700
million for grain sales to Moscow
under extraordinarily easy terms, a
boon both for Russian families and
the American farmers who will send
their crops to Moscow.
Yeltsin said flatly that Clinton had
agreed to end legislation that denies
favorable trade terms to Russia as
long as Moscow places restrictions on
emigration.
But Clinton indicated discussions
weren't that far along. He said he
and congressional leaders had recent
ly agreed to compile a list of "every

one of the Cold War and other legis
lation restrictions that are still being
applied to Russia, even though it is
now a democratic state." He said
they would "make as many changes
as possible."
Clinton said Yeltsin had assured
him there were no longer any individ
uals in Russia who were being
blocked from leaving.
Sharing a podium that bore the
Stars and Stripes and the Russian
tricolor, the two men seemed eager to
leave the Cold War behind. Clinton
issued a remarkable public statement
of regret that an American subma
rine had collided with a Russian sub
in the Barents Sea several days earli
er. Yeltsin said he was "now finaliz
ing" a schedule for removal of the
last Russian troops from Cuba.
Clinton said that for 45 years the
two countries "pursued a deadly con
frontation in nuclear arms. Now we
can pursue a safe and steady coopera
tion."
Said Yeltsin, "We are struggling
against Communism."
