The increasing number
of theme houses seems
to defeat their purpose

IF SOMETHING doesn't work,
make more of it. Such "logic,"
once reserved for the federal
government, American car makers
and creators of prime-time sit
coms, has recently surfaced on
campus in the Office of Residential
Education.
Res Ed's recent announcement
to add several new "focus houses"
for next year ignores the fact that
many — if not a majority — of the
current focus houses are apathy
ridden shadows of what they were
designed to be.
But instead of focusing their
efforts on improving the houses
that have already been established,
Res Ed officials have seemingly
declared experiments such as Pot
ter (American Society from the
1960s to the 19905), Murray ("mod
ern culture and thought") and
Adams (Human Biology) successes.
Next year will see the advent of
the public-service focus house
(Lantana), the world-affairs focus
house (Castano) and the environ
mental house (Robinson, formerly
the gender-studies focus house).
This move comes despite the
complaints of some residents of
the current houses, who have said
their dorms have so few focus
related activities that the focus is
hardly discernible. Others say
activities or material which is
passed off as part of the house
focus is only marginally relevant to
this purpose.
Such problems need to be ironed
out before new houses are added.
Res Ed needs to figure out how to
get students who draw in on prior
ity to execute programs. Perhaps
they should even require the pro
gramming staff and resident fel
lows to submit syllabi of planned
activities and reports of completed
activity. Mid-year evaluations and

surveys of residents should be per
formed and submitted to Res Ed,
not just to the internal house staff.
But even if the current prob
lems can be remedied, the question
needs to be asked: how many
upper-class students want to live
in a focus house?
Former Res Ed Director Alice
Supton has said she envisions "all
upper-class houses with resident
fellows will eventually have some
sort of focus." But like parents
who can't seem to accept that their
children are growing up and get
ting lives of their own, Res Ed offi
cials ignore the fact that many
upper-class students are too busy
or are simply not interested in liv
ing in a focus house.
Intensive commitment to
extracurriculars such as sports,
student government, public ser
vice, student publications and
community centers — which is
encouraged at every turn during
freshman year — may preclude
many upperclassmen from being
free to devote themselves to a
focus house. Thus, "involved stu
dents" actually become detriments
to a focus house. Other students
simply get their fill of program
ming after freshman year and
want to be left alone.
Seemingly oblivious to these
facts, Res Ed is pushing ahead with
plans to convert two large dorms,
Lantana and Castano, into focus
houses. Perhaps ignorant of the idea
of a "test market," Res Ed would be
wise to start small and found the
programs in a couple Row houses
like Grove-Mayfield or 584 May
field. A tightly-knit residence of 40
to 50 people would probably do a
better job of initiating programs and
activities. If the foci are successful,
they could be re-located to larger
dorms as interest grows.
Res Ed must not be discouraged
from enacting new programs; how
ever, these programs must be able
to survive the marketplace of stu
dent interest and activity. In the
real world, proposals sink or swim
based on consumer response.
Perhaps Res Ed should hire
some managerial consultants.
