Freshman English seems to be a waste of time for most students

lAM IN THE midst of a frustrated
rage. I have just been exposed to my
first day of Freshman English, and
basically all I see is a dysfunctional sys
tem. I was assigned a class in Septem
ber, and that was the first problem.
There was something like three choices
they gave us to choose from, sometime
last summer, and when I arrived stupe
fied at this intimidating campus, some
one handed me a paper with my spring
quarter Freshman English assignment
on it, and said, "Hold onto this, you'll
need it in 23 weeks." Little did I know
how much more complex it would be
than a simple sheet of paper which I
quickly lost in the influx of exciting,
brightly colored handouts given during
Orientation.
But the first problem I had was
easily resolved. At the end of last
quarter I walked into the Freshman
English office and told the truth:"I
lost it. Can you tell me what I've
got?" And fearing a storm of rage and
wrath, I was mildly pleased at the
pleasant help I got. No problems. So
having my assignment, I went to the
bookstore to check out the books.
There on the shelf I saw books for
two classes that looked cool, classes
I'd want to take, one on maybe fairy
tales, it seems, and the other with
two books I've been looking forward
to reading anyway. Of course, neither
of these was my class, and I looked at

the daunting reader for my section
and sighed mournfully.
But then a light went off in my head
and I thought, "Wow, this is a cool
school. There shouldn't be any problem
getting one of those other classes. I'll
just go to them and try to get in." Little
did I know the minor bureaucratic hell
that awaited me.
Second problem: Freshman English
3C-17 doesn't exist. Yes, the book
store is carrying some pretty cool
books for a non-existent class. Well,
maybe I'm being a bit forward, but
the time schedule doesn't list the
time, location, or existence of such a
class. Luckily, the other really nifty
looking one, 3C-12, exists and fits
beautifully into my schedule, so I
made sure to attend the first class. To
be safe I attended my first designated
class (3C-19); after all, maybe I would
like it and all would be OK. I examined
the syllabus and decided I'd rather be
in one of the other two. So later that
day I ended up in e4l along with about
10 other people who, like me, were
vagrants, wanderers, unwanted. Only
one of us was able to get in, and of
course that wasn't me.
The next step was approaching the
Freshman English office, which had
suddenly turned hostile now that class
es had begun. "No I don't know about
3C-17. No I won't look it up. I'm busy
sitting here at my desk mindlessly dis

missing valid questions like yours! No,
you shouldn't appeal to the head dude,
he probably won't get back to you, so
why don't you just get out of here."
Nice and friendly.
Real helpful and polite and bureau
cratic and unsympathetic.
Let me say now that I've never
agreed with the existence of Freshman
English. Maybe there are some people
who would benefit from it, but they
should know who they are, or maybe
other teachers should recommend it for
them. Says one friend of mine, "It's like
cookie-cutter writing, very rigid." Says
another, "It was my worst class so far
at Stanford, and the one I got least out
of." And another, "Pointless drivel." Oh
gosh, am I excited!
You see, I plan on taking numerous
English classes here, and I might even,
if I'm lucky, end up as a writer. Bhut i
alllredie no howe to spelle, and I is well
with syntax. I got high grades on both
AP English tests (composition and liter
ature), but although I already passed
out of one quarter of English, I still
have to take this unfeelingly and arbi
trarily assigned class. What makes it
worse is there are really cool sections of
it I can't get in because of all of this
bureaucracy.
This then is my proposed solution:
Make English a requirement, but let
there be a placement test to get out of
Freshman English, so we can reap the

benefits of the rest of the wonderful
English Department here, instead of
being resentful and bitter for the rest of
our years here, and avoiding it like the
plague it now seems. Also, if that is
unreasonable (which I think it's actual
ly far more than reasonable) at least let
us choose our sections. You say some
would gather more attention because
they seem more interesting, easy, what
ever? Make them all amazing! Make me
want to take them all — and sad that I
can't! Make all the texts (whether
books, films, poems, etc.) and writing
pertinent and interesting. A class
doesn't have to consist mainly of busy
work (or even any busy work) for stu
dents to benefit from it.
Perhaps that's the real problem. Per
haps it transcends simply the Fresh
man English Department. There exists
here at Stanford an antiquated teach
ing idealism that seems to conflict with
the school's new-found progressive atti
tudes.
Maybe I'm new here and all and
don't have 30 years of teaching under
my belt, and shouldn't make such unin
formed judgments, but I'm writing
about what I see, how I feel — and I
feel mistreated and poorly represented.
This letter is not meant as an attack
on my current Freshman English
teacher, simply on the system.
