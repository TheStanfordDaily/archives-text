# Removal of Ayn Rand Society flyers proves to be a pointless gesture
## 
### 
The way to fight ideas with which one
does not agree is to clearly and forcefully
promulgate one's own ideas. Michael
Cohen's statements, as they are reported
in the March 31 issue of The Daily, seem

to indicate he would agree; there, he
defended the rights of the members of the
Ayn Rand Society to express disagree
ment with environmentalism, though he
himself is an environmentalist.
Sadly, it appears there are Stanford
students who disagree.
On the afternoon of March 28,1 post
ed approximately 75 of the Ayn Rand
Society's anti-environmentalist flyers on
various bulletin boards around the
Quad.

By the afternoon of March 29, most of
these were either gone or defaced; as of
today, over a week later, I believe not a
single one of those flyers is up anywhere
in the Quad. Nearby flyers were undis
turbed.
I can only conclude that these flyers
were taken down on purpose.
What could anyone hope to accom
plish by behaving in such a fashion?
If environmentalism, with which the
vandals presumably agree, is supported

by fact, these flyers are not a threat.
Environmentalists have the support of
the Stanford administration, of the
national and local media, of the national
and local governments; any fallacious
criticisms of environmentalism can be
almost instantly countered.
If, on the other hand, environmental
ism is not supported by fact, why would
anyone want to go on believing it?
