## The 						Stanford underworld

4 £ HEY, BUDDY, you gonna
these?" The man spoke
J. cautiously. He crouched down
next to me in the "Philosophy" section,
gesturing to the stack of books at my side.
He wore a black turtleneck. He looked
around the Bookstore suspiciously. No
one was watching. I looked around, too.
"Huh?" I said.
"I can get you these same books. Never
used. Thirty-five bucks. What are you
doing after this? When can you meet me?"
"I was going to ..." I started, con
fused, before he cut me off.
"Corner of the quad. Eleven o'clock."
I showed up. It was 11, and the man in
the dark shirt with the cheep books
wasn't there. Had he set me up? I looked
around suspiciously. 11:01. He came run
ning. He was carrying a bag. "I bet the
books are in there," I thought. I'd never
done this before, but I had a pretty good
idea of how these kind of things worked.
"Let me see the books first," I said.
"I swear I've never used them," he
repeated anxiously. "I bought them for
the class and then decided not to take it."
"I don't wanna get stuck with any bad
books, man." I had gotten mixed up with
some bad philosophy a few years before,
and this time I was wary.
He was smiling nervously. "I've heard
it's a good class," he pleaded. He glanced
around furtively. "Oh, my name's
'Slim,' " he said. He made quote marks

with his fingers when he said "Slim."
I nodded to show I understood. I
looked at the covers. They were colorful
and shiny and I liked them, even though
I knew to be careful — neat covers could
sometimes be misleading. I flipped
through the books — no highlighting,
one creased page, fine print, some good
pictures. I had him right where I wanted
him. "I'll give you 30," I said.
He answered hastily,"Yeah, yeah,
that's cool."
I made out a check. He snatched it
away before I could write my Stanford ID
number at the top, and disappeared into
the crowd. I slipped the books into may
bag, and walked away coolyv -- n. r
I looked at my watch and remembered
I had some "business" to take care of at
the Financial Aids Office. When I got
there, the guy at the window looked at
my ID. He seemed to be expecting me.
"Step inside," he said. I entered and
checked the place out. I'd never been
inside that room, but I had a pretty good
idea of what these kind of places looked
like. There were all sorts of files in file
cabinets. I had a hunch they were proba
bly "financial aid" files. I was right. A
woman approached me with a folder in
her hand. She looked around and saw
that no one was watching. "Baedeker .. .
Robert?" she said under her breath.
"Who wants to know?" I looked
around the room, aloof.

"We've had a new shipment of Perkins
loan repayments,"
I nodded confidently. "Do you want to
cancel your Stafford loan get a Perkins
loan instead?" she asked.
"Huh?" I played naive. "What's the
difference?"
"Better interest rate, longer grace
period." She was trying to impress me,
but she was nervous. I could tell.
"And if I am interested?"
"We cancel one loan, you fill out a cou
ple new forms. Bingo. New loan."
"Sounds too easy."
Someone walked by. We hushed up
and played it casual. She lit a cigarette.
"Yeah, I might be able to work something
out," I said. "Give me a little time. Let me
talk to my mom." She wrote her phone
number on a slip of paper and slid it into
my hand. I lit a cigarette and turned
toward the door, another deal all but
wrapped up.
Outside, the sunny world went by —
oblivious to the clandestine shadows that
stirred beneath its surface. I smiled smug
ly to myself. I looked around to see that no
one was watching, and headed off to class.
