### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
After six months of reading resumes and in
terviewing candidates, the search committee
for a new director of the Black Community
Services Center has chosen Ohio educator Ju
dith James to fill the position.
"The key things are she has terrific experi
ence — she has a great sense of purpose with
respect to how important education is to
young people," Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, a member of the committee, said
about James. "She's a real people person and a
real student person."
Currently James is executive director of the
Teaching Leadership Consortium, a non-prof
it project of the Ohio Board of Regents that
works to increase the number of minority
teachers in the state.
In the past, she has served as assistant dean
of the College of Education at the University of
Cincinnati, where she was responsible for the
student services center as well as administer
ing scholarships for and working with minori
ty students. She has also worked for the Uni
versity of California system as a student af
fairs officer and campus ombudsperson.
James, who will begin work in July, is re

quickly the feelings of the com
munity. I wouldn't say she had
a real agenda.'

rector who has served as acting director of the
center and associate dean of students since the
resignation of former Assoc. Dean Keith
Archuleta. Archuleta was arrested June 2 for
secretly videotaping women changing their
clothes during photography sessions in his
apartment.
Jackson said the process to select the new
director of the BCSC was "lengthy, but very
worthwhile."
"It's very fortunate that we were able to at
tract a candidate of Judith James' caliber,"
said Jackson, pointing out that James has
"strong links in the black community nation
wide."
Search committee member Nanci Howe, as
sistant director of Tresidder Union, said

James "has a lot of broad, diverse experience
working in different institutions, both in edu
cation and for the state. . . . I'm looking for
ward to working with her as a colleague."
Several committee members said James'
strengths stemmed from her communication
skills.
"More than anything, what impressed me
was her listening ability," said Howe. "I'm al
ways apprehensive when someone comes in
and thinks they have all the answers, but she
came in ready to listen and see what the com
munity needs."
Michael Pickrum, a graduate student on the
committee, said, "One of her strengths was she
was very frank about the fact that she needed
to come here and look at the community.
"She came across in a very professional
manner. She seemed to have a pretty good in
sight into the committee and its needs," he
said. "She seemed to pick up really quickly the
feelings of the community. I wouldn't say she
had a real agenda."
Senior Nicole Johnson, another member of
the committee, said James "exhibited the qual
ities and experiences we were looking for in a
director," including the ability to work with ad-
