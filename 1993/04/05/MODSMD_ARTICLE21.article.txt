Down University Avenue, past the palm trees, after
you pass the expensive stores and lush homes
with their white picket fences, there is a bridge.
Across this bridge is a different world.
Here, yards are lined with chain link fences with dogs
behind them. The windows of these homes are decorat
ed not with elegant draperies, but with iron bars. This is
East Palo Alto, the murder capital of the United States.
Residential streets here are lined with unregistered
cars, many of which are stolen. On many streets, police
officers point out known crack houses. "People come
from all over to buy drugs here," said East Palo Alto
Police Officer John Norden.
With the drugs come guns. On a typical night, the
police get three or more reports of shots being fired.
There have been about 40 shootings this year.
Police officers always wear bulletproof vests, as do
the Menlo Park Fire Department which works in the
area. Officers have confiscated a wade variety of guns,
from semi-automatic handguns to fully automatic
machine guns. However. Norden sees hope in the fact
that there seems to be a reduction in the amount of fully
automatic firearms confiscated.
Officers frequently have to draw their weapons in the
line of duty, yet they rarely fire rounds. According to
Officer Rati Sarro, "People will push you right to the
edge to see how far you will go."
Several officers say that the crime problems here could
be solved if only the city had money to hire more police.
Each night, there are four officers on duty covering the
22 square miles that comprise East Palo Alto Officers
are forced to ride one person to a car in order to have
more care out on patrol. "We are always playing catch up,
so it's hard to get on top of things," Norden said
Recently, city officials announced that the San Mateo
County Sheriff s Office and the California Highway
Patrol will be lending units to East Palo Alto. These
additional law enforcement officers will work in con
junction with the East Palo Alto Police Department.
This added help is especially needed at this time of year,
as crime rates usually soar during the summer.
So far, there have been three homicides in East Palo
Alto this year. At the same time last year there had
already been 12. One can only hope that the highly com
petent police officers along with the city's residents can
help East Palo Alto lose its dubious distinction as the
country's most dangerous community

Photographer Burt Herman spent more than 50 hours
on patrol unth East Palo Alio police officers.

For most people. East Pale Abe is associates with
drugs and violence. But for some children it is
home.
One wonders what is it like to grov up in £ neighbor
hood that was known last year as the nation s ' murder
capital." Yet after spending several afternoons visiting t
classroom at nearby James Flood Elementary school
it's easy to notice that the children wlk> sxt.«r>c
school are just like any other
Flood Elementary. located in Menic Pert serves the
communities of East Palo Alto and Eas: Menlc Part
Located west of the Bayshore Freewaj the schco. is rel
atively free of the violence found or. the ?ther side of
"the highway," the neighborhoods that these children
call home.
Except for the fact that these stu dents art pre
dominantly black and ChicanoLat n: it is difficult
to tell that many of these children live in Las: Pa-:
Alto. To the casual observer, the schoo, lives of these
children are similar to the lives of stu aents from
more affluent neighborhoods. Skiiis such as reading,
writing, speaking and math are practice" daily. In
addition, "life skills'" — such as cooperation and
teamwork— are specifically emphasized r. the cur
riculum.
The pictures on the Tight illustrate a typistl school
da}' in one of Flood Elementary s classes. This class,
taught by Car la Saxton. is £ "combination" "iass com
posed of first- and second-grade students Because of
her bilingual skills, Ms. Saxton. as her students refer to
her, teaches a disproportionately high percentage of
Chicano lißtino students in an otherwise predominantly
black student population
Since some students' parents have ";.:rr.;:ed English
knowledge. Ms. Saxton translates everything that is
sent home. For mam - of these students, their lack of
English exposure is ameliorated with the help of tutors
from the Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring Program The
program matches Stanford students wrt- elemental?
school children from East Palo Alto ani East Menlo
Park. These tutors spend a few hours a week playing
with students while reinforcing the language skills
taught in class.
Four students in Saxton s class are currently tutored
by Stanford volunteers. "If 1 ccmid, ] would get every
one of my students a tutor. The? the tutors are gres:
and the kids reaDv eniov it.' she said
