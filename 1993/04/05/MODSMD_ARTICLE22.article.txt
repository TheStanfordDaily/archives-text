## Sluggers split series with Bears, take two of three 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Geoff Blum, California's soph
omore shortstop, proclaimed in
Friday's Daily Californian, "We
want to score as many runs as we
can and embarrass [Stanfordl as
much as possible."
Add Geoff Blum's name to the
growing list of Cal athletes who
should have acted before they
spoke. The Cardinal ended its
five-game losing streak in fine
fashion, nearly sweeping the sec
ond-place Bears in a three-game
weekend series. Stanford (16-13
overall, 4-8 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division) took
the opening games, 4-0 and 9-3,
while the Bears (20-17, 7-7) eeked
out a 3-2 extra-inning win yester
day.
Cardinal ace Willie Adams
faced Mike Cather in Friday's
contest. Adams, coming off a diffi
cult outing against Arizona State
last weekend, got into some early
trouble on Friday. After Andy
Tarpley fouled out to lead off the
second inning, Adams gave up
consecutive infield singles, and an
error by second baseman Jeff Des-
Jardins loaded the bases.
But Adams retired the next
two Bears easily, inducing Reed
Aljian to pop to DesJardins and
Tim O'Brien to ground out to
shortstop.
Stanford opened scoring in the
third. With one out, DesJardins
singled to right field on an 0-2
count. Cale Carter followed with a
bouncer to the right side that
O'Brien was unable to handle,
advancing DesJardins to third
base. A.J. Hinch made the score 1-
0 Cardinal with an RBI ground
out.
Stanford extended its lead in
the fifth, again taking advantage
of a Golden Bear error. With two
outs and runners on first and sec
ond, Dusty Allen bounced an
inning-ending grounder to Tarp
ley at third. Tarpley botched the
play, however, enabling Allen to
reach safely. Hot-hitting Steve

Carver lined the next pitch down
the left-field line at Evans Dia
mond, driving in two runs.
A Hansen double and an Allen
single in the eighth gave Stanford
a 4-0 edge.
Cal never even came close to
scoring after the second. No Bear
runner advanced beyond second
base in the final seven innings, as
Adams (6-1) cruised to his first
career shutout. The junior
allowed only five hits in racking
up his fourth complete game.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
relied on offensive heroics from
right fielder Brodie VanWagenen
to break open a tight game in the
late innings, winning 9-3.
Stanford starter Andrew Lor
raine (5-3) notched his fifth com
plete game of the season, a mam
moth 140-pitch effort in which
Lorraine gave up 10 hits, but
recorded a career-high 11 strike
outs as well.
After Stanford jumped to an
early 3-1 lead, Cal threatened in
the sixth. Mark Palfalvi tied the
contest with his fifth home run of
the season. Then, with two run
ners on base, the Bears, who lead
the Six-Pac in stolen bases,
attempted a double steal.
Hinch, who threw out four run
ners in the series, ruined the dou
ble steal, and Lorraine whiffed
Scott Mainini to end the inning.
With DesJardins aboard via a
single in the sixth, VanWagenen
stroked a full-count offering from
Matt Toomey (0-3) over the wall
in left-center field.
Todd Bartels replaced fellow
freshman Dan Reed as the Cardi
nal's No. 3 starter in yesterday's
contest.
He lasted eight solid innings,
allowing only a pair of runs. The
freshman worked out of tough
jams in both the sixth and sev
enth, leaving men on both second
and third in each of those frames.
"Bartels was changing speeds
well, and his stuff was still good,"
coach Mark Marquess said in
explaining his decision to stay
with the frosh in the later

innings. "He gave us a chance to
win today, but we just couldn't
get enough runs for him."
The score remained tied at two
into extra innings. In the 10th,
Stanford reliever Greg Mix fell
into immediate trouble. Cal
cleanup hitter Nate Brown drilled

a ground-rule double over the
center field wall to lead off the
inning. One error and one hit
batsman later, Mix was facing a
bases-loaded, nobody-out situa
tion.
The senior righthander, who,
like Bartels, was coming off the

most impressive outing of his
career, retired third baseman
Andy Tarpley on a weak popout to
Allen. Blum, the next batter,
struck out on a fouled-off bunt
attempt with two strikes.
Aljian ruined Mix's effort with
a single to right on a 1-0 pitch.

"Mix did a pretty good job,"
Marquess said. "He challenged
them up there. We had chances to
score today that we couldn't take
advantage of."
Stanford's next opponent, con
ference-leading USC, comes to town
Thursday for a three-game set.
