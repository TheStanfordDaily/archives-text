# Men's tennis loses to Bruins, Trojans
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
If the Bruins and the Trojans
had not given the Cardinal men's
tennis team a terrific fight, this
weekend's series in Los Angeles
would have been disappointing.
Unfortunately for No. 5 Stan
ford, the dominating duo of colle
giate tennis upheld their top
ranking decisively.
Friday afternoon, No. 1 UCLA
let only one match slip as they
ran away with a 5-1 win over
Stanford. Similarly, No. 2 USC
gave up only one match in their 6-
1 routing of the Cardinal on Sat
urday.
"We played pretty well, but at
this point they're better than we
are," said coach Dick Gould.
Top hitter Michael Flanagan
had similar sentiments. "It
wasn't as disheartening as last
year," he said, "but we blew a few
opportunities."

Vimal Patel, who pulled out
the Cardinal's lone win on Fri
day, and Chris Cocotos, who did
the same on Saturday, provided a
few bright spots for Stanford.
Patel, at No. 3, struggled through
three sets with Jason Sher before
defeating him 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
Meanwhile, Flanagan and
Robert Devens, in the top two
slots, were defeated by Canadian
Davis Cuppers Sebastian Le√ülanc
and Robert Janecek 6-2, 6-3 and
7-6, 6-1, respectively.
Bruin David Sanguinetti need
ed three sets to defeat Cocotos 2-
6, 6-3, 6-3 and Fritz Bissell took
three to defeat freshman Jeff
Salzenstein 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. At No. 6
singles, Matt Quinlan hustled
past Billy Wright 6-2, 6-4.
UCLA is now the only unde
feated team in the nation's Top
-20, but Gould believes the Bruins
are beatable.
"By the end of the year we will be able
to compete with UCLA," he said. "If
USC has a full lineup, we will need to
take advantage of every single opportu
nity."
Apparently, the Cardinal did not take
advantage of a number of those oppor
tunities this weekend. Playing singles
without Brian MacPhie and David
Eckerot, whom Gould refers to as USC's
"stud horses," the Trojans still managed
to roll past the Cardinal in straight sets.

Although Cocotos beat Kent Seton 6-
4, 6-4, the rest of his teammates did not
fare so well. Flanagan lost to Zimbab
wean Davis Cupper Wayne Black 7-5, 6-
1, while Devens fell to Jon Leach 6-3, 6-
3. Patel lost to Swede Andres Lanyi 6-1,
6-2.
In the fifth and sixth spots, Trojan
freshman Adam Peterson breezed past
Salzenstein 6-2, 6-1 and Lukas Hovorka
pulled out a 6-3, 7-6 win over Wright.
In the only completed doubles match,
Devens and Patel lost a close three-set
ter to Lanyi and Eckerot 6-4, 1-6, 7-5.
Although other doubles matches were
not completed, Gould was pleased with
what he saw.

"USC had their full lineup in doubles
and we played competitively," he said.
"Our [doubles performance] was just a
guess until now."
Despite the losses, Gould is opti
mistic. "I think we will continue to
improve at a greater rate than [UCLA
and USC]," he said. "If we stay focused
and stay together, well, a lot can happen
in two weeks. During the next four
matches (before UCLA and USC come
up to Stanford) we need to sharpen up
and remedy a few things.
"We'll see how far we can close the
gap between now and then. .. Playing at
home with a strong, supportive crowd
could be the equalizer."
