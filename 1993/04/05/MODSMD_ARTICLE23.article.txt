# Men's tennis loses to Bruins, Trojans
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
If the Bruins and the Trojans
had not given the Cardinal men's
tennis team a terrific fight, this
weekend's series in Los Angeles
would have been disappointing.
Unfortunately for No. 5 Stan
ford, the dominating duo of colle
giate tennis upheld their top
ranking decisively.
Friday afternoon, No. 1 UCLA
let only one match slip as they
ran away with a 5-1 win over
Stanford. Similarly, No. 2 USC
gave up only one match in their 6-
1 routing of the Cardinal on Sat
urday.
"We played pretty well, but at
this point they're better than we
are," said coach Dick Gould.
Top hitter Michael Flanagan
had similar sentiments. "It
wasn't as disheartening as last
year," he said, "but we blew a few
opportunities."

Vimal Patel, who pulled out
the Cardinal's lone win on Fri
day, and Chris Cocotos, who did
the same on Saturday, provided a
few bright spots for Stanford.
Patel, at No. 3, struggled through
three sets with Jason Sher before
defeating him 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
Meanwhile, Flanagan and
Robert Devens, in the top two
slots, were defeated by Canadian
Davis Cuppers Sebastian Le√ülanc
and Robert Janecek 6-2, 6-3 and
7-6, 6-1, respectively.
Bruin David Sanguinetti need
ed three sets to defeat Cocotos 2-
6, 6-3, 6-3 and Fritz Bissell took
three to defeat freshman Jeff
Salzenstein 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. At No. 6
singles, Matt Quinlan hustled
past Billy Wright 6-2, 6-4.
UCLA is now the only unde
feated team in the nation's Top
-20, but Gould believes the Bruins
are beatable.
