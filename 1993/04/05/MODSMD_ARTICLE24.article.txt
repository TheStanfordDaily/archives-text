world-record holder in that event. Summer

Stanford spiker Kristin Klein have joined the
ranks of the U.S. National women's volleyball
team, which will eventually become the Olympic
team for the 1996 games in Atlanta. Oden's older
sister Kim, a Stanford graduate as well, retired
recently from competition, after captaining the
U.S. National team for several years.
