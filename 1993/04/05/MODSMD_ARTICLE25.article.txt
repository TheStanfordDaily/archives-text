# Third best in region close but no cigar for gymnasts

Sophomore Jene Elzie called it"The
most exciting meet since I've been at Stan
ford."
Although the Stanford women's gym
nastics team didn't meet its preseason goal
of reaching the NCAA Championships, it
had what it considered a very successful
meet at the NCAA Western Regional com
petition in Corvallis, Ore. Saturday night.
The unranked Cardinal finished third in
the region with a season-best score of
191.875.
Despite a pre-meet prediction by head
coach Breck Greenwood that the third
place finisher in the West would receive one
of the 12 spots in the NCAA Champi
onships, it was not to be, as only Pacific-10
Conference champion and fifth-ranked
UCLA along with host school and No. 4
Oregon State advanced, with scores of
194.10 and 193.775, respectively.
Stanford's performance did allow it to
leapfrog over No. 18 Boise State (190.825),
No. 17 Cal State-Fullerton (190.425), No.

16 Washington (189.80), and UC-Santa
Barbara (187.25). Stanford's mark this
year was actually .655 better than last
year's, when it was one of four schools from
the West which qualified.
No scores were available, but Green
wood said the 12 NCAA qualifiers are (in
no order) Georgia, Utah, Florida, Alabama,
Louisiana State, UCLA, OSU, Auburn,
Michigan, Arizona, Arizona State, and
Penn State. He guessed Stanford placed
about 15th nationally.
While the Stanford team will not be
going back to Corvallis in two weeks for the
championships, freshman Hillary Ander
son and Elzie will make the trip as individ
uals. They took home Stanford's first-ever
regional event championship, tying OSU's
Renee Runyon with scores of 9.85 on bars.
In a nice bit of irony, Runyon's personal
coach is Robert Shawler, an assistant coach
for Stanford.
At the regionals, Stanford started out
inauspiciously enough, with a 47.40 on beam,
an "average, but not great" performance,
