# Third best in region close but no cigar for gymnasts
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
Sophomore Jene Elzie called it"The
most exciting meet since I've been at Stan
ford."
Although the Stanford women's gym
nastics team didn't meet its preseason goal
of reaching the NCAA Championships, it
had what it considered a very successful
meet at the NCAA Western Regional com
petition in Corvallis, Ore. Saturday night.
The unranked Cardinal finished third in
the region with a season-best score of
191.875.
Despite a pre-meet prediction by head
coach Breck Greenwood that the third
place finisher in the West would receive one
of the 12 spots in the NCAA Champi
onships, it was not to be, as only Pacific-10
Conference champion and fifth-ranked
UCLA along with host school and No. 4
Oregon State advanced, with scores of
194.10 and 193.775, respectively.
Stanford's performance did allow it to
leapfrog over No. 18 Boise State (190.825),
No. 17 Cal State-Fullerton (190.425), No.

16 Washington (189.80), and UC-Santa
Barbara (187.25). Stanford's mark this
year was actually .655 better than last
year's, when it was one of four schools from
the West which qualified.
No scores were available, but Green
wood said the 12 NCAA qualifiers are (in
no order) Georgia, Utah, Florida, Alabama,
Louisiana State, UCLA, OSU, Auburn,
Michigan, Arizona, Arizona State, and
Penn State. He guessed Stanford placed
about 15th nationally.
While the Stanford team will not be
going back to Corvallis in two weeks for the
championships, freshman Hillary Ander
son and Elzie will make the trip as individ
uals. They took home Stanford's first-ever
regional event championship, tying OSU's
Renee Runyon with scores of 9.85 on bars.
In a nice bit of irony, Runyon's personal
coach is Robert Shawler, an assistant coach
for Stanford.
At the regionals, Stanford started out
inauspiciously enough, with a 47.40 on beam,
an "average, but not great" performance,
according to Greenwood. Elzie scored a
9.70 to finish eighth in the region and
freshman Linda Chun was 17th with a
9.575.
The Cardinal began to turn it on
when it rotated to floor, the team's best
event all year — until it scored a dismal
47.10 in the Pac-10 meet. In Corvallis,
the squad reverted to its previous excel
lence, placing three gymnasts in the top
-15 in the region. Anderson was fifth with
a 9.75, sophomore Tina Snowden shook
off a late-season slump for a 9.70 (ninth),
and Meegan Lannin was 13th with
9.675.
But the biggest surprise of the night
for the Cardinal was its vault showing.
Stanford shattered the all-time school
record and beat its previous best this

year by almost a full point with a 48.00.
Anderson and sophomore Katie Clancy
led the way with personal-bests, Clancy
with a 9.75, Anderson a 9.625. Elzie
added a 9.70.
"We were sky-high," Greenwood said.
"After vault, we had to be careful we
didn't celebrate too much."
There was no need to worry, because
the Cardinal closed tljp ipeet with an
excellent bars showing. In addition to the
sterling routines of Elzie and Anderson,
Clancy scored a 9.70 to finish 12th in the
region.
"Katie had just a great meet," Green
wood said, adding that some of her best
performances in 1992 also came at the
end of the year. "We call her 'post-season
Clancy.' "
"He calls me that," Clancy rejoined.
Overall, the team had mixed reactions
to the meet. Clancy best exemplified the
emotional dichotomy: "We definitely had

our best meet of the season .... We were
so thrilled," she said, immediately
adding she was "obviously disappointed"
in not making the nationals.
Greenwood agreed. "We redeemed
ourselves from Pac-lOs. . .(but) we wish
we could have gone two weeks farther,"
he said.
Most of the optimism was directed to
building a stronger team next year. The
Cardinal will lose no gymnasts to gradu
ation, and it will gain Virginia high
schooler Katie Jennings — "maybe the
top recruit in the country," according to
Greenwood.
Stanford will also feel the sting of not
quite making it this year. "That gives us
a lot of incentive for next year," Elzie
said.
Greenwood summed up his attitude
for the whole team. "Obviously, we would
much rather qualify (this year), but this
will be a real hungry team next fall."
