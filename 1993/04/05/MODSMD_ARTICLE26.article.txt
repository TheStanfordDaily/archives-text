# Men's gymnastics second in Western Regional, earns NCAA berth
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Advancement to the NCAA Finals came at an
excruciatingly high price this weekend for the Stanford
men's gymnastics team.
While the Cardinal returned from the NCAA West
ern Regionals in Norman, Okla. with a second-place
finish, key competitor Mark Booth suffered an ankle
iryury that will most likely keep him out for the
remainder of the season.
A fall in the first tumbling pass of his floor routine
ended the competition for Booth and left him with a
possibly torn Achilles tendon. After the loss of the
junior co-captain at the beginning of the meet, the
Stanford squad was forced to make last-minute substi
tutions for the all-around gymnast.
"Booth's injury was a very big loss to the team,"
said coach Sadao Hamada. "We could have panicked,
but we managed to stay focused."
Nebraska finished the six-team meet ahead of the
Cardinal 285.375-282.80. Oklahoma, narrowly bested
by Stanford, ended up in third with 282.775. All three
of these teams will advance to the NCAA Finals in
Albequerque, N.M. in two weeks.
"We really didn't have a great meet," said senior co
captain Jair Lynch. "All we had to do was qualify
though, and that's exactly what we did. "
Despite some slight reshuffling in the lineup, the
Stanford gymnasts still turned out a number of strong
individual performances. Lynch had a characteristical
ly forceful meet highlighted by a high-bar score of
9.825 and 9.75s on both the parallel bars and the floor.
Stanford put together a strong ring team led by
sophomore Jing-Wei Liang with 9.75, junior Jason
Cohen with 9.65 and freshman Peter Hegi with 9.60.
Senior Jeff Bender stood out on the rings with a 9.70

routine.
Once again, the parallel bars proved the Cardinal's
strongest event with Bender, Liang and senior Shawn
Adamek joining Lynch with scores above 9.50. At the
other end of the scale, Stanford's vaulting performance
still has quite a bit of room for improvement with
Cohen's 9.10 the team's highest score in the event.
"Overall, we had more misses than Nebraska,"
Hamada said. "We didn't make too many big mistakes,
but because we were just off here and there, we didn't
come up with the big scores."
Nebraska finished the meet with only six misses
compared to the Cardinal's total of 14 fiubs. Hamada is
gearing up for a second shot at the Cornhuskers in the
NCAA Finals.
"Our main challenge should be Nebraska," he said.
"They are just very consistent — they don't miss, and
we have been missing a lot."
Stanford will try to defend its national title against
not only Nebraska, but also Oklahoma and the top
three Eastern Region qualifiers Ohio State, Minnesota
and Illinois. Despite this weekend's somewhat disap*
pointing finish, the team maintains the optimistic out
look on a repeat championship it has held from the out
set of the season.
"Even with Mark out, the team pulled together this
weekend," Lynch said. "I think we can still do it — no
problem. We realize that we can step it up a level and
still win."
In mapping out his overall plan for the season,
Hamada left his options open in the event of an injury
such as Booth's.
"This is something I have been planning for,"he
said. "It is a huge loss, but I think the team has enough
depth that we will be able to fill in."
"We're going to try to correct all the little things in
the next two weeks," Lynch said.
