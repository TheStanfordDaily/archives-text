# Volleyball smokes LMU, Pepperdine
## Spikers win in straight games 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team left the Lions lame, then
washed out the Waves on last week
end's two-game road trip, driving
its current win streak to a season
high nine games.
"We played great," said middle
blocker John Hribar, capturing the
entire team's enthusiasm over its
weekend play.
"It's the best we've played all
year," concurred swing hitter Ryan
Moos.
The team started slowly against
Loyola Marymount on Friday, but
was able to come from behind to
win the first game 15-9. Playing
consistent side-out volleyball, the
Cardinal won the next two games in
workmanlike fashion, 15-5, 15-11,
over one of the worst teams in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion.
"Our siding out is what won the
match," said assistant coach John
Kosty.
Of Stanford's two starting swing
hitters, Moos and Bob Hillman,
Hill man received 100 serves and
Moos only five. But the Lions' strat
egy backfired as Hillman passed
extremely well, leading the Cardi
nal to victory.
Stanford's enthusiasm over a
great weekend of volleyball came
not from the victory over the Lions
(3-11 in the MPSF), but from a ver
itable shellacking of Pepperdine,
ranked No. 3 nationally with a 15-4
record.
"If we play with the same inten
sity and execution as we did last
night, we can win it all," said setter
Canyon Ceman of their victory over
last year's national champions.
In front of 2,400 fans, the sec

ond-ranked Cardinal (15-3, 13-2
MPSF) won in straight games, 15-
13, 15-2, 15-13, thereby snapping
the Waves' 13-match homecourt
winning streak.
Stanford had some standout
players, but the victory was a true
team effort, according to coach
Kosty. The numbers reinforce this
assessment, as the Cardinal hit
.556 as a team, 200 points above
Pepperdine, and an incredible .850
in game two. In this game Stanford
had no errors in 20 attempts.
Besides this flawless play, the
other highlight of game two was
Moos' serving.
"Ryan created eight to nine
points off of his jump serve," Kosty
said.
"It was the best I've served in my
entire career," Moos said. "I was
hitting it as hard as I could, and it
was going in. It looked like a pin ball
machine on the other side."
"He was pounding the ball," said
senior opposite hitter Dave Goss.
"They were passing back on their
heels."
Again receiving a large propor
tion of Pepperdine's serves, Hill
man was able to add 12 kills to
another good passing effort. Hill
man had five errors in 24 attempts
to hit .292, about 100 points below
his season average.
Another middle blocking duo
came forward for Stanford versus
Pepperdine. Junior Joe Burghardt,
who has been bothered by back
problems all year but continues to
lead the nation with a .586 hitting
percentage, had another productive
night with 10 kills and five blocks.
Most surprising, though, was
the play of middle blocker John
Hribar. Hribar set expectations
high on Friday night by hitting .789
and fulfilled them in full on Satur

day by hitting .722 with 13 kills.
For the weekend, Hribar had an
amazing zero errors.
"I can blame it on my setting,"
Hribar said jokingly.
"I was extremely happy with my
setting," Ceman said. "I felt like I
knew what the blockers were
thinking."
Ceman was second on the team
with four blocks, rare for most set
ters but a typical performance for
him. As a team, the Cardinal had 12
blocks while the Waves had only six.
Another highlight for Stanford
was the superb play of All-Ameri
can Goss. He led all players with 31
kills, and had only two errors to hit

.659. Goss also had 10 digs, the
highest output of the night.
Goss' play looked all the better
when compared with his opposite
number for Pepperdine, Tom
Sorenson. Sorenson, who leads the
country with 7.19 kills per game,
was below his average with 20 kills
in 45 attempts. He had seven hit
ting errors, more than any player
on the other side of the net, and hit
a mere .289.
"We were able to slow Sorenson
down," Kosty said. "That was the
key to the match."
"I see him on the other side of the
net, and I just want to tell him that
he's no better than I am," Goss said.
