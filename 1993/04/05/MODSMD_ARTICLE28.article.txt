Swoopes, a championship for
her team. Texas Tech's won
drous year is complete.
Swoopes showed why she was
the national Player of the Year,
scoring 47 points to cap a
record-breaking run through
the NCAA Tournament and
lead Texas Tech to the women's
title with an 84-82 victory Sun

It was the most points in an
NCAA championship game by a
man or woman and the second
most in any NCAA game by a
woman. The 6-foot senior also
set a championship game record
for points in one half (23) and
tournament marks for total

(28-4).
Swoopes obliterated the old
record of 28 points in a
women's title game by Dena
Head of Tennessee and Dawn
Staley of Virginia in the 1991
finals. The record in the men's
finals was 44 by UCLA's Bill
Walton against Memphis State
in 1973.
Tech's standout also fell just
short of the all-time women's
NCAA mark of 50 points by
Drake's Lorri Bauman against
Maryland in the West Regional
finals in 1982.
The old mark for points in an
entire tournament was 134 by
Tennessee's Bridgette Gordon
in 1989 and Auburn's Carolyn
Jones held the old free throw
record of 41, set in 1990.

points for Tech. Freshman
Katie Smith led Ohio State with
28 and Nikki Key ton scored 19.
