# Vice provost for student affairs to get assistant
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
It's a tough job, but now there
will be two people to do it.
Mary Edmonds, Stanford's
relatively new vice provost for
student affairs, said that super
vising 17 different areas of the
University is difficult, especially
since she came to Stanford just
this year. So Edmonds plans to
choose an associate vice provost
to help out with the academic
side of her job.
Areas reporting directly to
Edmonds include the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions, the
Financial Aids Office, Residen
tial Education, the Dean of Stu
dents' Office and Cowell Student
Health Center.
When Housing and Food Ser
vices was added to the list in Sep
tember, Edmonds said it "be
came even more imperative that
I get some help."
The new associate vice
provost will concentrate on pro
viding academic support, she
said. The Registrar's Office, the
Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter, the Center for Teaching and

Learning and the Career Place
ment and Planning Center will
be among those supervised by
the new administrator.
"I'm looking for a person who
has very good academic creden
tials but also has student affairs
experience," she said, adding
that the move was partially mo
tivated by University President
Gerhard Casper's call for an in
tensified focus on academics.
Just now settling into her per
manent office in Tresidder
Union after the third move in
less than a year, Edmonds said
she is now ready to concentrate
on the bigger picture.
She said a new assistant will
free her up "to do the things I
haven't had time to do," such as
taking a closer look at long-term
planning.
Still, Edmonds worries that
with the budget cuts of the past
few years, people will be critical
of money spent for a new student
affairs administrator.
"It's probably the only major
unit that doesn't have at least
one associate vice provost," she
