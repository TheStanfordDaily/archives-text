# Netters blank USC, UCLA at home despite lineup change

### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
They're back. With an excla
mation point.
Still smarting from its 5-1
loss to No. 2 Florida two weeks
ago in Tallahassee, Fla., the
Stanford women's tennis team

might have had something to
prove this weekend against con
ference rivals No. 5 USC and
No. 13 UCLA. The Cardinal (19-
1, 4-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
South) sent the message to a
packed Stanford Tennis Stadi
um loud and clear, blanking the
Women of Troy (14-4, 4-3 in the

Pac-10 South) on Friday, 7-0,
and the Bruins (5-10, 1-6 in
Pac-10 South) the following
day, 8-0.
"It was a great weekend,"
said Stanford coach Frank
Brennan. "It couldn't have gone
much better."
The Cardinal rolled to both

wins without the help of red
shirt freshman Kim Shasby,
who is nursing a strained mus
cle in her foot. Shasby, ranked
No. 9 in the country, plays No. 3
singles and doubles for Stan
ford.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal
had little problem handling

USC, as No. 1 Laxmi Poruri
took the first nine games and
rolled over Petra Schmitt in the
center-court match, 6-0, 6-4.
Senior captain Heather Wil
lens made short work of the
Trojan's Suzie Italiano in the
No. 2 match, 6-4, 6-3, while
junior Kristine Kurth moved
into the No. 3 spot for Shasby
and downed USC's Maggie
Simkova 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 in a
marathon match that lasted
nearly three hours.
Freshman Beth Berris, play
ing at the No. 4 spot, was the
comeback kid of the day,
rebounding from one set down,
then down a second-set break,
then down 4-0 in the third to
defeat Melissa Hernando, 3-6,
6-4, 6-4.
Berris ran her individual
match win streak to 18-0 and is
the only undefeated Stanford
player in singles play.
Sophomore Amy Chiminello
wrapped up her No. 5 match
against Courtney Rose, 6-2, 6-4,
while junior Emma Woodhouse
sealed the singles sweep over
USC with a 7-5, 6-3 win over
Carla Quaresma in the No. 6
spot.
Only one doubles match was
played before the Cardinal
notched the dual-match victory,
in which the No. 1 team of
Poruri and Willens handled
Schmitt and Italiano by a score
of 6-3, 6-3.
Brennan was particularly
happy to watch his team return
to its winning ways after the
Florida loss.
"I'm very pleased," Brennan
said. "This was one of our bet
ter performances of the year,
and it came without Shasby,
who may miss several more
matches because of her foot
before the year is through. But,
overall, I feel pretty good after
this one. We have to keep it up."
The next day, Stanford hand
ed the Bruins their sixth Pac-10

South loss, while giving Shasby
much-needed rest.
UCLA struggled all day
against the Cardinal, due to the
loss of its No. 1 and No. 2 play
ers, Keri Phebus and Cammie
Foley, to the flu earlier in the
week.
Phebus is ranked No. 11 in
the nation, the highest ranking
of any true-freshman in the
country. Phebus and Foley
remained home in Los Angeles,
while Stanford routed the
short-handed Bruins.
No. 1 Poruri opened up the
blitz with a 6-1, 6-2 win over
Paige Yaroshuk of UCLA, while
Willens blew by No. 2 Jenny
Hilt, 6-1, 6-1.
No. 3 Kurth survived a three
setter against Jane Chi, win
ning 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, while No. 4
Berris rebounded from her
match on Friday to dispose of
UCLA's Meredith Chiles 6-1, 6-
2, in a match that took just over
an hour.
No. 5 Chiminello won over
Lee Ann Rostovsky, 6-2, 6-1,
while Emma Woodhouse made
it six in a row for the Cardinal
with her 6-1, 6-3 decision over
Anicia Mendez.
In doubles, No. 1 Poruri and
Willens polished off Yaroshuk
and Hilt by a 6-1, 6-2 score,
while Woodhouse and freshman
Wendy Sacks teamed up in the
No. 2 spot to defeat Chiles and
Rostovsky, 7-6, 6-2, to wrap up
the dual-match win for Stan
ford.
Stanford will likely face one
of its toughest tests of the year
when the team travels to Berke
ley on Wednesday to face the
No. 6 Golden Bears at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal posted a nar
row 5-4 win over the Bears at
Stanford Tennis Stadium on
March 6, and California will be
thinking revenge in the rematch
of the Big Match. Stanford will
return home to face Arizona on
Friday at 1:30 p.m.
