# Track and field looks strong in Panther Invitational meet
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Fueled by strong individual perfor
mances, the Stanford men's and women's
track and field teams crushe3 their oppo
nents last weekend at the Panther Invita
tional held in Sacramento.
The most impressive showing on the
men's side was a 1-2-3
finish by veterans Pat Stowell, John Fowler
and Matt Karsevar in the discus. Fowler also
later teamed up with Stanford's Ramon Alar
con to take second and third, respectively, in
the hammer throw.
"I think the throwers are the anchor of
the men's team," said Fowler. Even with the
loss of Pacific 10 Conference champion ham
mer thrower David Popejoy, who is redshirt
ing this year due to back problems, the Car
dinal has its sights set on a strong showing at
this year's Pac-10 finals, according to Fowler.
Othet outstanding performers at the
meet included distance-runner Eric Spayde,
who clocked a 3 minute, 57.65 second 1500-
meter race to run away with the victory.
Freshman Rene Rodriguez took first place
in the 400 (47.86) while sophomore Tovi
Abello jumped to a 14.85 win in the 110 hur
dles.
On the field, senior Jason Robinson
jumped a personal best 24 feet, three-quar
ters inches to place second in the long jump.
For the women, the competition was
laden with meet records and Pac-10 qualify
ing times as they "dominated the meet,"
according to freshman sprint specialist Mon
ica Hoggatt, who placed first in the 400 race
(57.56).
Sophomore Christy Boyd, returning from
a successful freshman year which saw her
qualify for the Pac-10s in the 400 hurdles,
won the 100 hurdles last Saturday in a meet

record of 14.20. That time also qualified her
for this year's Pac-10 Championships in that
event.
Boyd then teamed with Rhonda Oliver,
Jackie Bridgeman and Hoggatt to claim first
place in the 4 by 100 relay, before running
the first leg of the Cardinal's victorious 4 by
400 relay squad, which included Hoggatt,
Oliver and Maijorie Hsu.
In the distance events, Dena Day posted
meet records in both the 800 (2:12.20) and
1500 (4:35.50) races. Her time in the 1500
also qualified her for the Pac-10s. Teammate
Melissa Freeberg followed her with a third
place showing in the 1500 (4:37.20).
In the 3000, freshmen Laura Hayward
and Ann Sheehy finished in third and fourth
place, respectively, to round out the track
events.
On the field, Stanford's perennial
favorites in the throwing events, Jen
McCormick and Debbie Templeton, recorded
strong throws in the javelin to sweep the top
two places in that event. Senior Kathy
Unruh won the high jump by clearing the bar
at 5-feet-8 inches, while Dana Weeks bested
the field with a 38-feet-10 inches attempt in
the triple jump.
"The women looked really strong today,"
said coach Vin Lananna. "We finished sev
enth in the Pac-10 last year, but I think we
can improve on that with the team we've got
this year.
"On the men's side we're looking for
steady progress. From a team perspective
we're not as strong, but we'll have a very
good team in the future. This team is very
young, but the potential is there."
Next week, the Cardinal will race at Stan
ford Stadium in the annual all-comers Stan
ford Peninsula Track Meet. Competition
begins at noon, and all walk-ons are invited
to race.
