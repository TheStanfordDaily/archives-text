Last weekend, the Stanford
cycling team turned in a strong
performance, hosting the Stanford
University Collegiate Race Week
end. Several squads from all over
California, including long-time
rivals UC-Santa Barbara, UC-
Davis and California competed in
the races.
The three-event competition
began on Saturday with the Pat
terson Pass Road Race. Adam
Laurent of Santa Barbara won
the grueling 69-mile men's A-divi
sion race, followed by Cal stand
out Tim Larkin. Top Cardinal fin
ishers included Eddie Lim (11th)
and Andy Tucker (15th). In the
men's B-division, Cardinal
cyclists Larry Tsai and Bill Lloyd
finished fourth and sixth, respec
tively, while Stanford's John
Schlesinger rode to a victory in
the men's C-division.
In the shorter 23-mile D-divi
sion competition, Cardinal Michael
Cummer cruised to a victory fol
lowed by second-place John Burke
of Davis and Stanford's Alex
Accetta, who finished the race in
fourth place.
In the women's bracket, Bettina
Romer and Melissa Ruyle produced
Cardinal victories in the A and B
divisions, respectively. Romer, a
returning Stanford Nationals team

member, beat Cal's Katherine
Peterson, Aggie Stephanie Stilwa
gen and teammate Nicole Calakos
to win the 46-mile race.
The team standings for the
road-race competition closed with
Davis in first place with 221 points,
followed by Stanford with 196
points and Cal with 142 points.
On Sunday morning, the Cardi
nal women cyclists arose bright
and early to continue their quest
for an undefeated season in the
team time-trials competition. Fin
ishing more than 20 seconds
ahead of the second-place Aggies,
the Stanford women's A-squad
turned in a time of 18 minutes,
32.81 seconds on the 7.1-mile
Canada Road course.
In the men's competition,
Stanford's A-squad finished third
(16:26.07) to strong teams from
Cal (16:07.16) and Santa Barbara
(15:30.80). In the B-division, the
Cardinal squad of Ted Compton,
Jim Hwang, Rod Batycky and
Manny Rodriquez blazed to a
solid first-place finish with a time
of 16:26.32. Final team scores
placed Stanford in front with 412
points, followed closely by Santa
Barbara with 392 points and
Davis with 371 points.
The Stanford Criterium, a tech
nical course including multiple
turns, concluded the weekend's
events.
Bettina Romer closed out a per

fect weekend by finishing first on
the3s-lap, 21-mile women's A-divi
sion course. Teammates Nicole
Calakos and A-division newcomer
Martina Lauchengco. finished
fourth and fifth, respectively, for
the Cardinal. Anne Adams also
scored well for Stanford in the
shorter B-division race, finishing
second to Davis' Alura Emery.
Top Cardinal finishers in the
men's bracket included Takeshi
Doi (second, C-division), Jim
Hwang (seventh, B-division), and
Richard Washington (fifth, D-divi
sion).
The time-trials victory marked
Stanford's seventh team win thus
far in the season. "We're one win
away from going into the [Western
collegiate cycling] conference
championships with a perfect
score," Stanford coach Art Walker
said.
Though three race weekends
remain in the season, Walker has
his team focused on the conference
meet since the top-six teams from
the combined regular season and
conference competition advance to
the collegiate cycling national
championships to be hosted by
MIT at the beginning of May.
"Nationals will be a high visibil
ity meet for bike racing," Walker
said. "Cycling isn't exactly big as
far as collegiate sports go, so I
think [this year's Nationals] will be
a really go.»d thing for the sport."
