# Blyth fund lets students play the market
## Students invest, manage $75,000 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
For many, "bears" and "bulls"
may conjure up images of Chicago
sports teams or National Geo
graphic specials, but for a handful
of Stanford students who are
managing an investment portfolio
worth about $70,000, these two
animals mean money.
Twice a week, a group of about
10 undergraduates meets to dis
cuss investment strategies for the
portfolio, created from a $75,000
donation to the University by
Charles Blyth in 1978.
Wearing anything from cutoffs
to a suit and tie, members exam
ine stocks, bonds and options for
companies such as Paramount
Pictures and Chrysler Corpora
tion, making decisions on what to
buy and sell and which invest
ments to watch carefully.
Because of recent economic
downturns and the devastation of
the October 1987 stock market
crash, the worth of the portfolio
stands at slightly less than the
original donation, according to
fund president Michael Rashes, a
junior. He said that the lower net
worth is partly a product of the
changing membership of the
group.
"If we did have long term goals,
we'd probably do better. But it's
hard to attract people if you buy a
stock and say you're going to hold
on to it for 10 years. That's not
terribly exciting," said Rashes,
pointing out that members want
the chance to make their own
investments rather than maintain
the same portfolio as the year
before.
"This is above all an education
al experience for all of us,"
explained Rashes. "We're going to
make mistakes. We've made them
in the past."
For example, Rashes said the
group pulled out of the market
after the crash in 1987 and missed
the entire bull period following it,
depriving the fund of needed rev
enue.
The group is made up of
between seven and 11 voting
members who are chosen each
spring through an application

process run by fund advisor
Heather Dunn, the Office of Stu
dent Activities' program coordi
nator.
According to Dunn, members
are selected from all majors and
years. In addition to the voting
members, any student is welcome
to attend meetings and advise the
group on investments, she added.
Fifty percent of the fund's
earnings are returned back to the
account; 25 percent are donated
to the University and 25 percent
are used to fund the group's
expenses including guest speak
ers, newspaper subscriptions and
other investment tools.
Some of the best suggestions
for investments come from the
novices' common sense rather
than sophisticated strategies,
explained Dunn, adding that the
idea for an investment in the Ann
Taylor company came from the
girlfriend of a member.

"Sometimes those who know
less about the market can con
tribute more," she said. "The real
purpose is to learn and students
come in with varied experience."
"Blyth wanted to provide an
educational opportunity for stu
dents who were interested in
finance and investment," said
Dunn, adding that he created an
identical fund at Occidental Col
lege.
A national financial leader,
Blyth was the founder of the Cali
fornia investment firm Blyth &
Co.
The Stanford group works
together, with each member
researching and proposing possi
ble investments that the group
discusses and votes on.
When the group makes an
investment based on a member's
proposal, that member is expected
to continue watching it.
"Some stocks have such little

information that you have to
trust someone. We've started to
shy away from that," said fund
secretary Jimmy Lind, a fresh
man. "People aren't eager to show
up when the company they pro
posed isn't doing well because
they'll get bashed on."
He added that currently it is
hard for the group to predict the
market because of uncertainties
surrounding President Clinton's
economic policies. "Once people
are a little more certain about
what Clinton might do, the mar
ket will stabilize," he said.
Dunn also pointed out that
"people tend to lose interest as the
stock market goes down and when
you're losing money," but she
added that may be the most
important time to attend meet
ings because the group is dealing
with real money.
"If they lose it there won't be a
Blyth Fund," she said.
