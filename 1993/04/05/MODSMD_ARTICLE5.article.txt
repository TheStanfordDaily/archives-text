# Res Ed director Supton resigns
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Director of Residential Edu
cation Alice Supton announced
Friday that she has decided to
leave her post at the end of this
school year, explaining that her
family situation could not allow
her to make the full-time com
mitment she feels the position
requires.
Supton, who has been work
ing part time for the last two
years, said both she and Vice
Provost for Student Resources
Mary Edmonds "felt very
strongly that Residential Edu
cation needs a full-time direc
tor."
"I never stopped feeling that
Residential Education needed a
full-time director, even when I
started working part time,"
said Supton, who has held the
position for 15 years.
She said she stayed in her
role to see the program through
the recent challenges of budget
cuts and administrative reorga
nization.
Supton said she started
working part time to accommo
date her move to Berkeley and
the demands of raising her
young son.
To compensate for the
change, Supton and Assoc. Di
rectors of Res Ed Ann Porteus,
Diana Conklin and Elizabeth
Hiyama formed what Supton de
scribed as a "cooperative, femi
nist leadership" in an electronic
mail message sent to all Resi-

dent Fellows
and Res Ed
staff members
Friday.
But now, "it
is time to turn
a new page,
with a new
president, a
new vice pro-

vost for stu-

dent affairs

and new resident fellows," Sup
ton said.
A national search for a new
Res Ed director headed by Ed
monds will begin soon, Supton
said. People from inside and out
side the University will be en
couraged to apply, she added.
Porteus said while Supton
will be "very hard to replace,"
the "health" of Res Ed should re
main intact through the transi
tion.
Supton said that, although
she would like to feel that she
has "left an imprint on Resi
dential Education," her depar
ture should not have a negative
impact on the program because
its values — making students
feel as if they are part of a resi
dence community, as well as en
couraging recognition of indi
vidual backgrounds, ideas and
values — are "woven into Stan
ford and independent of indi
viduals."
Porteus and resident fellows
praised Supton's work in paving
the way for Res Ed in its current


Supton
form.
"Alice (Supton) not only
directs Residential Education,
she is Res Ed," Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk RF Andrew Lisac said. "She
basically conceptualized every
thing to do with Residential

Education for the past 15
years."
Toyon RF Margaret Fox said
she felt losing such a "fantastic
director" was a "severe blow to
Residential Education," but
added that she understands the
demands of raising a small
child and respects Supton's
decision.
Lisac said he hopes the lead
ership transition will prompt

people to "rethink what Resi
dential Education is about,"
pointing out that there has been
disagreement over that issue
among the administration.
Porteus also mentioned the
"debate about Residential Edu
cation," saying that while the
office will "move on" after Sup
ton's replacement takes over,
the long-term goals of Res Ed
are more in the hands of top

administrators.
Supton said she is looking
forward to spending time with
her son and "consolidating" her
family life. "I don't know what
my life is going to be like when I
leave," she said, but added that
she intends to maintain connec
tions with her Stanford col
leagues and students.
"I am so indebted to co-work
ers and resident fellows and so

privileged to work with these
people," Supton said. "I have
also learned so much from stu
dents."
In order to facilitate the
search process, Supton said she
announced her decision as early
as possible.
Sending out the official
announcement "made it very
real to me," Supton said. "It still
hasn't completely hit me yet."
