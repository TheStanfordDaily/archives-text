# A 						yellow brick road?
## $22K workshop brainstorms $200 million interchange idea

We can all dream, but can we
afford to?
Stanford and Palo Alto paid
$22,000 for a three-day communi
ty workshop last weekend to
dream up innovative ways to im
prove access between the two com
munities by revamping the area
around the University Avenue-El
Camino Real interchange.
And the proposal that came out
of that workshop has a high price
tag, perhaps up to $200 million.
So today, said Andrew Doty,
Stanford's director of community

relations, the proposal is still more
a dream than reality. "I think that
this whole plan is still a vision of
what might be ... no one has
thought of specific costs and
sources," he said.
The changes in the area bound
ed by El Camino Real, Alma
Street, Embarcadero Road and
San Francisquito Creek have been
pushed for by an ad hoc committee
composed of Stanford and Palo
Alto officials dubbed the "Dream
Team." Much of the land consid
ered for improvement is leased to
Palo Alto by Stanford.
"We looked at how close we
do something about that."
So the Dream Team brought
four outside experts in architec
ture and urban design to conduct
a workshop. With input from sev
eral dozen prominent community
members, the panel suggested
some exciting — and expensive —
ideas.
A key aspect of the proposal
would lower the CalTrain tracks
below ground level to make room
for a civic plaza surrounded by
University Avenue, which would
hp re-routed to surround the oval
shaped area.
"It creates a great new space
for the city, and brings the front
door of downtown much closer to
Stanford," Carter said.
The cost of the plaza could be a
problem, however. Though there
are no official numbers yet, esti
mates range as high as $200 mil
lion for the whole project, accord
ing to Carter. Just lowering the
railroad tracks could cost as much
as $20 million.
Stanford and Palo Alto would
likely split most of the costs of
any construction. Other parties
who would benefit — such as the
Holiday Inn hotel on El Camino

— might contribute as well. Some
federal funds could also be
involved, Carter said.
Despite the expense, Universi
ty architect David Neuman,
another Dream Team member,
thinks the project can happen.
"This doesn't have to occur at
once. It can, and probably will, be
done in phases," he noted.
According to Neuman, the
next step is to look at how feasible
the proposal is, particularly the
recession of the CalTrain line.
Stanford representatives met
with city planning officials on Fri
day to discuss bringing in outside
consultants to study the design.
Neuman, who calls himself an
optimist, predicted that if every
thing goes well, area residents
could see some "significant
improvements" within five to 10
years. A number of perimeter
changes, such as the expansion of
a Red Cross facility on Mitchell
Lane, could happen sooner, he
said.
Other aspects of the proposal
include making the CalTrain sta
tion more attractive by improving
accessibility to downtown Palo
Alto and installing bicycle lock
ers. The Marguerite shuttle ser
vice, which connects parts of the
campus to Palo Alto, would also
be improved, according to Neu
man.
