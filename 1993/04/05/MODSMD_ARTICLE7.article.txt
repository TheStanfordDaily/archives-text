# The 						quarter's just begun, but the
## RATRACE is over 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Many Stanford students see the Farm as a safe
haven from the rat race.
But this weekend about 100 students decided to
leave the peace and quiet of campus and jump into a
rat race with both feet.
The RATRACE, that is — Research Across Time
Requiring Astounding Commitment and Endurance
— a clever little acronym for a giant, day-long scav
enger hunt that led sleep-deprived students and facul
ty across hundreds of miles of the southern Bay Area.
This year the competition involved more than a
dozen teams, including one comprised of Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson and other faculty members.
The race sent students scurrying everywhere from
Santa Cruz to San Jose to San Juan Bautista.
The annual event, called "The Game," maintains a
mysteriously low profile. Each year's players are
largely recruited by race veterans, and announce
ments for planning meetings are scrambled in code.
Codes and puzzles, indeed, are the leitmotif of the
game. The rats' clues or "cheddars" are hidden by var
ious ciphers that must be unscrambled before they re
veal the hiding spot of the next cheddar, which can be
miles away.
In true Stanford spirit, the keys to unlocking the
codes required knowledge of a wide variety of sub
jects. Some cheddars this year were written in Latin,
Hindi, Japanese, Morse code and semaphore. The
subjects covered included organic chemistry, physics,
calculus, music and Dennis the Menace trivia.
To prepare themselves for this
battery of puzzles, the teams of
rats (each of which had a different
name, such as "Ferrats" or the
"Rat Pack") carried a huge num
ber of reference books, tools, food
and drinks as well as changes of
clothing. Many even brought along
portable computers. Tape decks
were also needed — one of the
cheddars was recorded. Rats often
pack all their materiel in vans
rented just for the occasion.
Another essential for the partic

ipants is a water gun. The direc
tors of the game set "Rat Traps"
for players, hiding in areas where
clues were located and springing
out to squirt the groups. If one of
the "Rat Gods" squirted a player
before the players hit the god, the
entire team was forced to solve
additional clues that wasted valu
able time.
Despite the air of secrecy, it was
always apparent that something
was up when participants descend
ed on a clue site. Sun worshippers
basking by the Monterey coast
were given a surprise when dozens
of players came clambering up
cliffs, searching for a clue hidden
in a rock crevice.

Even more unusual was the
sight of about 40 college-aged men
and women searching the nearby
Dennis the Menace playground for
a plaque of the little rascal. And
anyone passing by Lexington
Dam, inland from Santa Cruz, at
5:00 a.m. would have seen sleep
deprived rats climbing under
bridges, searching for their fix of
cheddar.
When tired and hungry play
ers found and solved about 20
cheddars, they arrived at a home
on a quiet street where the orga
nizers waited, and their race was
over.
This year's winners, the Fer
rats, took about 16 hours to com

plete the course, shaving about an
hour off their winning time in last
year's race, according to team
member Jason Johnson, who said
winning the second time out was
almost as much fun as winning the
first race.
But not every team played to
win. The "Reading Rats" — a team
including Jackson, Stanford pro
fessors Robert Byer, Russell Fer
nald, Patricia Jones and Connie
Chang-Hasnain as well as Caltech
professor Eric Gustafson — said
they weren't worried about win
ning.
"We're just worried about hav
ing a good time and finishing,"
Jackson said.
