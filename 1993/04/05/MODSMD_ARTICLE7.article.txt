						quarter's just begun, but the
## RATRACE is over

Many Stanford students see the Farm as a safe
haven from the rat race.
But this weekend about 100 students decided to
leave the peace and quiet of campus and jump into a
rat race with both feet.
The RATRACE, that is — Research Across Time
Requiring Astounding Commitment and Endurance
— a clever little acronym for a giant, day-long scav
enger hunt that led sleep-deprived students and facul
ty across hundreds of miles of the southern Bay Area.
This year the competition involved more than a
dozen teams, including one comprised of Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson and other faculty members.
The race sent students scurrying everywhere from
Santa Cruz to San Jose to San Juan Bautista.
The annual event, called "The Game," maintains a
mysteriously low profile. Each year's players are
largely recruited by race veterans, and announce
ments for planning meetings are scrambled in code.
Codes and puzzles, indeed, are the leitmotif of the
game. The rats' clues or "cheddars" are hidden by var
ious ciphers that must be unscrambled before they re
veal the hiding spot of the next cheddar, which can be
miles away.
In true Stanford spirit, the keys to unlocking the
codes required knowledge of a wide variety of sub
jects. Some cheddars this year were written in Latin,
Hindi, Japanese, Morse code and semaphore. The
subjects covered included organic chemistry, physics,
calculus, music and Dennis the Menace trivia.
