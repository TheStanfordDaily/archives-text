## Some say student input hampered; ASSU Senate struggles to fill Council of Presidents' empty shoes

With the victory of the"I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate in last spring's election,
student voters delivered a resounding criti
cism of business as usual in the ASSU.
However, the enthusiasm that accom
panied the Prefer slate's idea to dissolve of
the Council of Presidents was tempered by
foreboding visions of a student government
without direction, an ASSU Senate with
out leadership, and an electorate without a
voice.

One year later, some administrators and
senators believe those visions have come
true.
"The most powerful potential role of the
COP is its representation of students in re
lations with the University administra
tion," said Senate Chair Ron Brown, who is
the de facto leader of the ASSU this year.
"This is where the lack of the COP was
seen most," he said. "Student input in the
University's direction was lacking."
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
agreed. "Over the years, the COP has been
good at articulating issues important to
students, and advocating for students," he
said. "In some respects, that's been lost."
Despite the chasm created between stu
dents and the administration as a result of

the lack of the COP, many said general stu
dent life carries on seemingly undisturbed.
"Speaking from a student's point of
view, I haven't been able to tell much of a
difference," said Jay Jackson, one of the
members of the Prefer slate.
"I saw no problems without a COP,"
added graduate senator Sanford Dickert.
"There was a need for student input but I
felt that it was met by the senate."
Such mixed reviews about the student
government's performance this year make
the outlook for the ASSU as muddled and
uncertain as it was one year ago, when life
without the COP began.
The communication gap
In order to close the gap created between

the ASSU and the administration without
a COP, the senate formed the University
Relations committee and expanded several
administrative jobs.
"The University Relations committee
was supposed to replace the COP," Brown
said. "But it did not take as active a role in
communicating with the University....
We didn't get as much respect from the
University as the COP would have."
"The University Relations committee
did not work as well as I had hoped," ad
mitted graduate senator Derek Miyahara,
who created and chaired the committee.
Problems with coordination and commit
ment plagued its success throughout the
year, Miyahara said.
Since the administration was not used

to working with the senate, there was a con
siderable period of adjustment for both
University officials and senate leaders.
Miyahara said that "we spent much of the
first quarter just trying to establish rela
tionships."
"If there was a big or small issue," Dean
of Students Michael Jackson said, "the
COP was a good place to start. We could al
ways consult with them and find out the
concerns of the students."
ASSU Financial Manager Christine
Vargas added that "administrators really
miss the COP because they have a hard
time knowing who to come and talk to."
The absence of a highly visible Universi-
ty liaison may have had more harm
ful effects than most students
think. "(President! Casper has
pretty much had his way," said
undergraduate senator Mork Mur
dock. "We've been handcuffed."
Administrators who work with
the ASSU share the sense that stu
dents' concerns are not being pre
sented. Nanci Howe, the associate
director of Tresidder Union, point
ed to the sluggishness of the senate
in filling the ASSU Nominations
Committee, which places students
on University committees. "Not
having students on University com
mittees has impacts," she said.
"Student voices are heard less
well."
With the added administrative
burdens placed on the senate, the
missing familiarity between stu
dents and administration, and the
lack of a driving political agenda,
the ASSU — minus the four indi
viduals who customarily guide it —
simply could not be everywhere it
needed to be.
"Many things going on in the
University are happening behind
closed doors," Brown said. Without
"someone whose job is to poke
around behind those doors" the
student body was left in the cold.
Overwhelmed by work
In the absence of a COP, some
felt the ASSU spread itself too thin.
The senate, whose traditional role
is to respond to COP initiatives,
was forced to assume the adminis
trative, creative and financial duties
the COP previously performed.
"One of the results of the COP's
absence was that some of the duties
were passed on to other positions,"
Brown said. "There was a realloca
tion of time."
The onus of this burden fell
most heavily on a small group of
senate leaders: Brown, Vargas,
Miyahara, Administrative Manager
Nikka Rimmer and Budget and
Finance Committee Chair Brian
Flachs, among others.
Those individuals, essentially
thrown into the tangled web of stu
dent-administrative relations, were
frequently overwhelmed by the
weight of their new tasks. Miya
hara, for example, sat on 17 differ
ent ASSU and University commit
tees.
"There are a lot more commit
tees that I sit on this year, which
are not necessarily tied to finance,"
Vargas said. "It takes time away

from the things I have to do."
"The load on the senate chair
and the financial manager
increased," Michael Jackson said.
"There's a lot of administrative
business to take care of." That kind
of daily work, he added, was for
merly handled by the members of
the COP.
Those close to the ASSU differ in
their perception of the effect that
the COP's absence has had on the
execution of everyday operations.
"The senate was bogged down by
day-to-day financial issues, funding
cycles, things the COP could help
direct," said Mork Murdock.
Howe said that "there have been
problems, especially in the financial
arena." She said the ASSU's budget
problems this year — the ASSU has
run up a $38,000 deficit and may
lose $90,000 in funding from the
University — were not addressed by
the senate leadership until several
months into the current fiscal year.
But Brown, among others,
believes the senate adequately han
dled the supervision of ASSU
administrative projects. "The way I
saw the year was that the basic
functions of the senate were largely
unaffected by the lack of the COP.
In the areas of two of the main
duties of the ASSU — business and
service projects, and funding to stu
dent groups — we were basically
unaffected."
Jackson, an administrator with
a close relationship to the ASSU,
praised the efforts of the senate this
year. "Folks there have acted very
responsibly," he said. "In terms of
the stewardship of resources, they
have acted with the utmost integri
ty and energy."
Even so, many found it increas
ingly clear that the creative energy
and political imagination the COP
usually provides was conspicuously
missed this year. "I think the COP
is a brainstormer of ideas — it is a
group of people thinking about stu
dent issues daily," Vargas said.
"There was not a lot of 'initiating*
in the senate this year."
The business of business
One project that has suffered
from a lack of student leadership
was the ASSU's proposed takeover
of the University's summer storage
operation. Now, just two months
away from the end of the school
year, the ASSU has failed to deliver
a final storage proposal. "We are
trying to develop options with sum
mer storage, and they can be done,
but we're up against the wall,"
Miyahara said.
"Senate members have had to
take up the resoonsibilitv of setting

up a system for summer storage,
where in the past all that could be
handled by the COP, because they
could devote more time to it," Mork
Murdock said.
Kevin Murdock agreed. "We
could have dealt with summer stor
age more effectively with the COP
. .. that's a COP-type issue."
However, in response to the
charge that the issue would have
been solved by a COP, Dickert said,
"whether a COP would benefit the
workings of a student senate is a
question. The leadership doesn't
have to come from a COP."
Flachs also downplayed the
importance of a COP on special pro
jects like storage. "We did have new
programs this year," he said,
including the Memorial Auditorium
sound system. "Last year I thought
the COP was a detriment to senate
initiated projects."
The storage quagmire reflects
the political limitations of the sen
ate according to Miyahara. "The
senate is not a good body for that
type of thing," he said.
"It is good for people coming to it
with things they want to get done,
and asking for approval. The senate
is a body intended to decide, not
design."
The basic structure of the ASSU
encourages more active participa
tion by COP members than sena
tors. The senate meets only once
every two weeks, while the COP
worked nearly every day in years
past; senators are not paid, while
last year's COP earned a $16,000
salary.
Further, the COP carries the

authority of a popular mandate,
something the senate chair and
administrative staff lack. "Neither
Christine Vargas nor I was elected
by the student body. We don't have
a mandate," Brown said. "My job is
to be accountable to the senate.
There is no body accountable to the
students but the COP."
No body, that is, except the sen
ate. But whether the senate has
sufficiently picked up the COP's
slack in representing students is
questionable.
Mork Murdock contends that
the senate has worked more effi
ciently this year, and attributes
that success to the fact that "people
in the senate have been more seri
ous." But Brown admitted that "a
lot of things were much looser with
out the COP."
"In talking to members of the
senate at the beginning of the year,
I was told that a lot of senators had
become lackadaisical," said Ted Lai,
another member of the Prefer slate.
In response to poor attendance
among some members of the sen
ate, Brown suspended seven sena
tors earlier this year.
"I think that making the senate
more aware was the intention of the
Prefer slate, but that intention has
gone unfulfilled," Brown said. "The
senate has not necessarily engaged
the University in representing stu
dent needs."
Deafening silence
"I would not say there has been
as consistent an effort as last year,"
Flachs said, summing up the

'ASSU's performance without the
COP. "On the other hand, I would
not say we were completely devas
tated."
Despite the chaos that surround
ed Prefer's election, the senate's
term has been relatively unevent
ful. "It seemed to be a year without
a lot of student issues," said Assoc.
Tresidder Director Paul Szczesiul.
"Whether that has to do with the
COP I don't know."
"If something very controversial
had come up there might have been
a problem," said Tresidder's ASSU
supervisor Linda Whitcomb. "For
tunately nothing like that hap
pened."
But the ASSU's low-profile
image this year may have to do with
much more than the absence of a
COP. It may point to larger cur
rents of student apathy and skepti
cism about the body's ability to
truly benefit the student popula
tion.
Expecting a shakeup of "busi
ness as usual," students may hard
ly have noticed a tremor. And
though senate leaders and admin
istrators lament the loss of the
COP, their remorse may reflect an
affinity for the most familiar, not
necessarily the most effective sys
tem.
"The model we've been using is
fairly traditional and has been in
existence for decades," Michael
Jackson said. "It may be an out
moded system."

ingly clear that the creative energy
and political imagination the COP
usually provides was conspicuously
missed this year. "I think the COP
is a brainstormer of ideas — it is a
group of people thinking about stu
dent issues daily," Vargas said.
"There was not a lot of 'initiating*
in the senate this year."
The business of business
One project that has suffered
from a lack of student leadership
was the ASSU's proposed takeover
of the University's summer storage
operation. Now, just two months
away from the end of the school
year, the ASSU has failed to deliver
a final storage proposal. "We are
trying to develop options with sum
mer storage, and they can be done,
but we're up against the wall,"
Miyahara said.
"Senate members have had to
take up the resoonsibilitv of setting

up a system for summer storage,
where in the past all that could be
handled by the COP, because they
could devote more time to it," Mork
Murdock said.
Kevin Murdock agreed. "We
could have dealt with summer stor
age more effectively with the COP
. .. that's a COP-type issue."
However, in response to the
charge that the issue would have
been solved by a COP, Dickert said,
"whether a COP would benefit the
workings of a student senate is a
question. The leadership doesn't
have to come from a COP."
Flachs also downplayed the
importance of a COP on special pro
jects like storage. "We did have new
programs this year," he said,
including the Memorial Auditorium
sound system. "Last year I thought
the COP was a detriment to senate
initiated projects."
The storage quagmire reflects
the political limitations of the sen
ate according to Miyahara. "The
senate is not a good body for that
type of thing," he said.
"It is good for people coming to it
with things they want to get done,
and asking for approval. The senate
is a body intended to decide, not
design."
The basic structure of the ASSU
encourages more active participa
tion by COP members than sena
tors. The senate meets only once
every two weeks, while the COP
worked nearly every day in years
past; senators are not paid, while
last year's COP earned a $16,000
salary.
Further, the COP carries the

authority of a popular mandate,
something the senate chair and
administrative staff lack. "Neither
Christine Vargas nor I was elected
by the student body. We don't have
a mandate," Brown said. "My job is
to be accountable to the senate.
There is no body accountable to the
students but the COP."
No body, that is, except the sen
ate. But whether the senate has
sufficiently picked up the COP's
slack in representing students is
questionable.
Mork Murdock contends that
the senate has worked more effi
ciently this year, and attributes
that success to the fact that "people
in the senate have been more seri
ous." But Brown admitted that "a
lot of things were much looser with
out the COP."
"In talking to members of the
senate at the beginning of the year,
I was told that a lot of senators had
become lackadaisical," said Ted Lai,
another member of the Prefer slate.
In response to poor attendance
among some members of the sen
ate, Brown suspended seven sena

"I think that making the senate
more aware was the intention of the
Prefer slate, but that intention has
gone unfulfilled," Brown said. "The

Deafening silence

Flachs said, summing up the

'ASSU's performance without the

not say we were completely devas
tated."
Despite the chaos that surround
ed Prefer's election, the senate's
term has been relatively unevent
ful. "It seemed to be a year without
a lot of student issues," said Assoc.
Tresidder Director Paul Szczesiul.
"Whether that has to do with the
COP I don't know."
"If something very controversial
had come up there might have been
a problem," said Tresidder's ASSU

But the ASSU's low-profile

much more than the absence of a

this year?

"I Prefer Not to Have A COP" members Ted Lai and Blake llstrup maintain a campaign promise to do
nothing.
Editor's note: This is the first article in a
two-part series.
With the victory of the"I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate in last spring's election,
student voters delivered a resounding criti
cism of business as usual in the ASSU.
However, the enthusiasm that accom
panied the Prefer slate's idea to dissolve of
the Council of Presidents was tempered by
foreboding visions of a student government
without direction, an ASSU Senate with
out leadership, and an electorate without a
voice.

One year later, some administrators and
senators believe those visions have come
true.
"The most powerful potential role of the
COP is its representation of students in re
lations with the University administra
tion," said Senate Chair Ron Brown, who is
the de facto leader of the ASSU this year.
"This is where the lack of the COP was
seen most," he said. "Student input in the
University's direction was lacking."
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
agreed. "Over the years, the COP has been
good at articulating issues important to
students, and advocating for students," he
said. "In some respects, that's been lost."
Despite the chasm created between stu
dents and the administration as a result of

the lack of the COP, many said general stu
dent life carries on seemingly undisturbed.
"Speaking from a student's point of
view, I haven't been able to tell much of a
difference," said Jay Jackson, one of the
members of the Prefer slate.
"I saw no problems without a COP,"
added graduate senator Sanford Dickert.
"There was a need for student input but I
felt that it was met by the senate."
Such mixed reviews about the student
government's performance this year make
the outlook for the ASSU as muddled and
uncertain as it was one year ago, when life
without the COP began.
The communication gap
In order to close the gap created between

the ASSU and the administration without
a COP, the senate formed the University
Relations committee and expanded several
administrative jobs.
"The University Relations committee
was supposed to replace the COP," Brown
said. "But it did not take as active a role in
communicating with the University....
We didn't get as much respect from the
University as the COP would have."
"The University Relations committee
did not work as well as I had hoped," ad
mitted graduate senator Derek Miyahara,
who created and chaired the committee.
Problems with coordination and commit
ment plagued its success throughout the
year, Miyahara said.
Since the administration was not used

to working with the senate, there was a con
siderable period of adjustment for both
University officials and senate leaders.
Miyahara said that "we spent much of the
first quarter just trying to establish rela
tionships."
"If there was a big or small issue," Dean
of Students Michael Jackson said, "the
COP was a good place to start. We could al
ways consult with them and find out the
concerns of the students."
ASSU Financial Manager Christine
Vargas added that "administrators really
miss the COP because they have a hard
time knowing who to come and talk to."
The absence of a highly visible Universi-
ty liaison may have had more harm
ful effects than most students
think. "(President! Casper has
pretty much had his way," said
undergraduate senator Mork Mur
dock. "We've been handcuffed."
Administrators who work with
the ASSU share the sense that stu
dents' concerns are not being pre
sented. Nanci Howe, the associate
director of Tresidder Union, point
ed to the sluggishness of the senate
in filling the ASSU Nominations
Committee, which places students
on University committees. "Not
having students on University com
mittees has impacts," she said.
"Student voices are heard less
well."
With the added administrative
burdens placed on the senate, the
missing familiarity between stu
dents and administration, and the
lack of a driving political agenda,
the ASSU — minus the four indi
viduals who customarily guide it —
simply could not be everywhere it
needed to be.
"Many things going on in the
University are happening behind
closed doors," Brown said. Without
"someone whose job is to poke
around behind those doors" the
student body was left in the cold.
Overwhelmed by work
In the absence of a COP, some
felt the ASSU spread itself too thin.
The senate, whose traditional role
is to respond to COP initiatives,
was forced to assume the adminis
trative, creative and financial duties
the COP previously performed.
"One of the results of the COP's
absence was that some of the duties
were passed on to other positions,"
Brown said. "There was a realloca
tion of time."
The onus of this burden fell
most heavily on a small group of
senate leaders: Brown, Vargas,
Miyahara, Administrative Manager
Nikka Rimmer and Budget and
Finance Committee Chair Brian
Flachs, among others.
Those individuals, essentially
thrown into the tangled web of stu
dent-administrative relations, were
frequently overwhelmed by the
weight of their new tasks. Miya
hara, for example, sat on 17 differ
ent ASSU and University commit
tees.
"There are a lot more commit
tees that I sit on this year, which
are not necessarily tied to finance,"
Vargas said. "It takes time away

from the things I have to do."
"The load on the senate chair
and the financial manager
increased," Michael Jackson said.
"There's a lot of administrative
business to take care of." That kind
of daily work, he added, was for
merly handled by the members of
the COP.
Those close to the ASSU differ in
their perception of the effect that
the COP's absence has had on the
execution of everyday operations.
"The senate was bogged down by
day-to-day financial issues, funding
cycles, things the COP could help
direct," said Mork Murdock.
Howe said that "there have been
problems, especially in the financial
arena." She said the ASSU's budget
problems this year — the ASSU has
run up a $38,000 deficit and may
lose $90,000 in funding from the
University — were not addressed by
the senate leadership until several
months into the current fiscal year.
But Brown, among others,
believes the senate adequately han
dled the supervision of ASSU
administrative projects. "The way I
saw the year was that the basic
functions of the senate were largely
unaffected by the lack of the COP.
In the areas of two of the main
duties of the ASSU — business and
service projects, and funding to stu
dent groups — we were basically
unaffected."
Jackson, an administrator with
a close relationship to the ASSU,
praised the efforts of the senate this
year. "Folks there have acted very
responsibly," he said. "In terms of
the stewardship of resources, they
have acted with the utmost integri
ty and energy."
Even so, many found it increas
ingly clear that the creative energy
and political imagination the COP
usually provides was conspicuously
missed this year. "I think the COP
is a brainstormer of ideas — it is a
group of people thinking about stu
dent issues daily," Vargas said.
"There was not a lot of 'initiating*
in the senate this year."

was the ASSU's proposed takeover
of the University's summer storage
operation. Now, just two months

mer storage, and they can be done,

up a system for summer storage,
where in the past all that could be

the outlook for the ASSU as muddled and
uncertain as it was one year ago, when life
without the COP began.
The communication gap
In order to close the gap created between

the ASSU and the administration without
a COP, the senate formed the University
Relations committee and expanded several
administrative jobs.
"The University Relations committee
was supposed to replace the COP," Brown
said. "But it did not take as active a role in
communicating with the University....
We didn't get as much respect from the
University as the COP would have."
"The University Relations committee
did not work as well as I had hoped," ad
mitted graduate senator Derek Miyahara,
who created and chaired the committee.
Problems with coordination and commit
ment plagued its success throughout the
year, Miyahara said.
Since the administration was not used

to working with the senate, there was a con
siderable period of adjustment for both
University officials and senate leaders.
Miyahara said that "we spent much of the
first quarter just trying to establish rela
tionships."
"If there was a big or small issue," Dean
of Students Michael Jackson said, "the
COP was a good place to start. We could al
ways consult with them and find out the
concerns of the students."
ASSU Financial Manager Christine
Vargas added that "administrators really
miss the COP because they have a hard
time knowing who to come and talk to."
The absence of a highly visible Universi-
ty liaison may have had more harm
ful effects than most students
think. "(President! Casper has
pretty much had his way," said
undergraduate senator Mork Mur
dock. "We've been handcuffed."
Administrators who work with
the ASSU share the sense that stu
dents' concerns are not being pre
sented. Nanci Howe, the associate
director of Tresidder Union, point
ed to the sluggishness of the senate
in filling the ASSU Nominations
Committee, which places students
on University committees. "Not
having students on University com
mittees has impacts," she said.
"Student voices are heard less
well."
With the added administrative
burdens placed on the senate, the
missing familiarity between stu
dents and administration, and the
lack of a driving political agenda,
the ASSU — minus the four indi
viduals who customarily guide it —
simply could not be everywhere it
needed to be.
"Many things going on in the
University are happening behind
closed doors," Brown said. Without
"someone whose job is to poke
around behind those doors" the
student body was left in the cold.
Overwhelmed by work
In the absence of a COP, some
felt the ASSU spread itself too thin.
The senate, whose traditional role
is to respond to COP initiatives,
was forced to assume the adminis
trative, creative and financial duties
the COP previously performed.
"One of the results of the COP's
absence was that some of the duties
were passed on to other positions,"
Brown said. "There was a realloca
tion of time."
The onus of this burden fell
most heavily on a small group of
senate leaders: Brown, Vargas,
Miyahara, Administrative Manager
Nikka Rimmer and Budget and
Finance Committee Chair Brian
Flachs, among others.
Those individuals, essentially
thrown into the tangled web of stu
dent-administrative relations, were
frequently overwhelmed by the
weight of their new tasks. Miya
hara, for example, sat on 17 differ
ent ASSU and University commit
tees.
"There are a lot more commit
tees that I sit on this year, which
are not necessarily tied to finance,"
Vargas said. "It takes time away

from the things I have to do."
"The load on the senate chair
and the financial manager
increased," Michael Jackson said.
"There's a lot of administrative
business to take care of." That kind
of daily work, he added, was for
merly handled by the members of
the COP.
Those close to the ASSU differ in
their perception of the effect that
the COP's absence has had on the
execution of everyday operations.
"The senate was bogged down by
day-to-day financial issues, funding
cycles, things the COP could help
direct," said Mork Murdock.
Howe said that "there have been
problems, especially in the financial
arena." She said the ASSU's budget
problems this year — the ASSU has
run up a $38,000 deficit and may
lose $90,000 in funding from the
University — were not addressed by
the senate leadership until several
months into the current fiscal year.
But Brown, among others,
believes the senate adequately han
dled the supervision of ASSU
administrative projects. "The way I
saw the year was that the basic
functions of the senate were largely
unaffected by the lack of the COP.
In the areas of two of the main
duties of the ASSU — business and
service projects, and funding to stu
dent groups — we were basically
unaffected."
Jackson, an administrator with
a close relationship to the ASSU,
praised the efforts of the senate this
year. "Folks there have acted very
responsibly," he said. "In terms of
the stewardship of resources, they
have acted with the utmost integri
ty and energy."
Even so, many found it increas
ingly clear that the creative energy
and political imagination the COP
usually provides was conspicuously
missed this year. "I think the COP
is a brainstormer of ideas — it is a
group of people thinking about stu
dent issues daily," Vargas said.
"There was not a lot of 'initiating*
in the senate this year."
The business of business
One project that has suffered
from a lack of student leadership
was the ASSU's proposed takeover
of the University's summer storage
operation. Now, just two months
away from the end of the school
year, the ASSU has failed to deliver
a final storage proposal. "We are
trying to develop options with sum
mer storage, and they can be done,
but we're up against the wall,"
Miyahara said.
"Senate members have had to
take up the resoonsibilitv of setting

up a system for summer storage,
where in the past all that could be
handled by the COP, because they
could devote more time to it," Mork
Murdock said.
Kevin Murdock agreed. "We
could have dealt with summer stor
age more effectively with the COP
. .. that's a COP-type issue."
However, in response to the
charge that the issue would have
been solved by a COP, Dickert said,
"whether a COP would benefit the
workings of a student senate is a
question. The leadership doesn't
have to come from a COP."
Flachs also downplayed the
importance of a COP on special pro
jects like storage. "We did have new
programs this year," he said,
including the Memorial Auditorium
sound system. "Last year I thought
the COP was a detriment to senate
initiated projects."
The storage quagmire reflects
the political limitations of the sen
ate according to Miyahara. "The
senate is not a good body for that
type of thing," he said.
"It is good for people coming to it
with things they want to get done,
and asking for approval. The senate
is a body intended to decide, not
design."
The basic structure of the ASSU
encourages more active participa
tion by COP members than sena
tors. The senate meets only once
every two weeks, while the COP
worked nearly every day in years
past; senators are not paid, while
last year's COP earned a $16,000
salary.
Further, the COP carries the

authority of a popular mandate,
something the senate chair and
administrative staff lack. "Neither
Christine Vargas nor I was elected
by the student body. We don't have
a mandate," Brown said. "My job is
to be accountable to the senate.
There is no body accountable to the
students but the COP."
No body, that is, except the sen
ate. But whether the senate has
sufficiently picked up the COP's
slack in representing students is
questionable.
Mork Murdock contends that
the senate has worked more effi
ciently this year, and attributes
that success to the fact that "people
in the senate have been more seri
ous." But Brown admitted that "a
lot of things were much looser with
out the COP."
"In talking to members of the
senate at the beginning of the year,
I was told that a lot of senators had
become lackadaisical," said Ted Lai,
another member of the Prefer slate.
In response to poor attendance
among some members of the sen
ate, Brown suspended seven sena
tors earlier this year.
"I think that making the senate
more aware was the intention of the
Prefer slate, but that intention has
gone unfulfilled," Brown said. "The
senate has not necessarily engaged
the University in representing stu
dent needs."
Deafening silence
"I would not say there has been
as consistent an effort as last year,"
Flachs said, summing up the

'ASSU's performance without the
COP. "On the other hand, I would
not say we were completely devas
tated."
Despite the chaos that surround
ed Prefer's election, the senate's
term has been relatively unevent
ful. "It seemed to be a year without
a lot of student issues," said Assoc.
Tresidder Director Paul Szczesiul.
"Whether that has to do with the
COP I don't know."
"If something very controversial
had come up there might have been
a problem," said Tresidder's ASSU
supervisor Linda Whitcomb. "For
tunately nothing like that hap
pened."
But the ASSU's low-profile
image this year may have to do with
much more than the absence of a
COP. It may point to larger cur
rents of student apathy and skepti
cism about the body's ability to
truly benefit the student popula
tion.
Expecting a shakeup of "busi
ness as usual," students may hard
ly have noticed a tremor. And
though senate leaders and admin
istrators lament the loss of the
COP, their remorse may reflect an
affinity for the most familiar, not
necessarily the most effective sys
tem.
"The model we've been using is
fairly traditional and has been in
existence for decades," Michael
Jackson said. "It may be an out
moded system."

Tomorrow: Has the lack of a COP
fostered increased student apathy
this year?
