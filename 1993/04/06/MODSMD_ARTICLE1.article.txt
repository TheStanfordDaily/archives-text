## Some say student input hampered; ASSU Senate struggles to fill Council of Presidents' empty shoes

With the victory of the"I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate in last spring's election,
student voters delivered a resounding criti
cism of business as usual in the ASSU.
However, the enthusiasm that accom
panied the Prefer slate's idea to dissolve of
the Council of Presidents was tempered by
foreboding visions of a student government
without direction, an ASSU Senate with
out leadership, and an electorate without a
voice.

One year later, some administrators and
senators believe those visions have come
true.
"The most powerful potential role of the
COP is its representation of students in re
lations with the University administra
tion," said Senate Chair Ron Brown, who is
the de facto leader of the ASSU this year.
"This is where the lack of the COP was
seen most," he said. "Student input in the
University's direction was lacking."
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
agreed. "Over the years, the COP has been
good at articulating issues important to
students, and advocating for students," he
said. "In some respects, that's been lost."
Despite the chasm created between stu
dents and the administration as a result of

the lack of the COP, many said general stu
dent life carries on seemingly undisturbed.
"Speaking from a student's point of
view, I haven't been able to tell much of a
difference," said Jay Jackson, one of the
members of the Prefer slate.
"I saw no problems without a COP,"
added graduate senator Sanford Dickert.
"There was a need for student input but I
felt that it was met by the senate."
Such mixed reviews about the student
government's performance this year make
the outlook for the ASSU as muddled and
uncertain as it was one year ago, when life
without the COP began.
The communication gap
In order to close the gap created between

the ASSU and the administration without
a COP, the senate formed the University
Relations committee and expanded several
administrative jobs.
"The University Relations committee
was supposed to replace the COP," Brown
said. "But it did not take as active a role in
communicating with the University....
We didn't get as much respect from the
University as the COP would have."
"The University Relations committee
did not work as well as I had hoped," ad
mitted graduate senator Derek Miyahara,
who created and chaired the committee.
Problems with coordination and commit
ment plagued its success throughout the
year, Miyahara said.
Since the administration was not used

to working with the senate, there was a con
siderable period of adjustment for both
University officials and senate leaders.
Miyahara said that "we spent much of the
first quarter just trying to establish rela
tionships."
"If there was a big or small issue," Dean
of Students Michael Jackson said, "the
COP was a good place to start. We could al
ways consult with them and find out the
concerns of the students."
ASSU Financial Manager Christine
Vargas added that "administrators really
miss the COP because they have a hard
time knowing who to come and talk to."
