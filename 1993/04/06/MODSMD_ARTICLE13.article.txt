Grade inflation creates
unfair playing field for
all university students

Grade inflation is a lot
like the federal deficit. Peo
ple generally don't worry
about either of them, as they fig
ure they are somebody else's prob
lems, they haven't hurt them yet
and both the benevolent grading
and the carefree spending that
have created these concerns have
helped them attain a higher quali
ty of life than would be found with
out either "problem."
However, as the federal deficit
slowly crests, likewise grade infla
tion has grown from a moderate
concern to one that is seriously
threatening academics both here
at Stanford and at other universi
ties. A recent survey revealed that
A's comprise 35 percent of all
grades given to students at Stan
ford in the last 20 years; the figure
for B's is 28 percent, and C's and
D's rate only 8 and 1 percent,
respectively. In short, grades today
are noticeably higher than their
levels 20 years ago.
Stanford is not alone in its grade
inflation. Other universities also
have made the A and the B, rather
than the C, the "pivot point" for
grades and grading.
While students undoubtedly do
not oppose this inflation intensely,
it is effectively corroding the true
meaning and spirit of the grading
process. Furthermore, it is grow
ing so deeply entrenched that,
unless action is taken among uni
versities nationwide to reverse or
at least halt the upward trend of
grades, an A will be the cubic zir
conium of grades — pretty to look
at, but not worth a whole lot.
But students should be con
cerned with "grade creep," even if
only in the spirit of self-preserva
tion. After all, if 4,000 students
with 4.o's apply for a job, ulterior
characteristics will certainly also

come into play.
Furthermore, with A's so easy
to earn, a particular student's
strengths are easy to overlook. Of
what value is an A in a class where
50% of students get A's? To a stu
dent majoring in said department
and hoping to pursue a career in
that field, an A is a vital prerequi
site for future employment. For
another student, taking the class
on a lark, and putting forth only a
small proportion of the effort
exerted by his or her classmate, an
A is nice, but hardly earth-shatter
ing. But with the grade inflation
that is common today, both of
these students earn A's, cheapen
ing the former student's effort.
Of course, there are vast gulfs
among departments and classes in
grades. Larger classes generally
have a wider distribution of grades
than their smaller counterparts,
and techie classes also utilize a
wider range of marks than their
fuzzy equals. But everywhere, it
appears, the C is no longer the
mark of an "average" student;
instead the B denotes the median
performance level. This should
stop.
However, if Stanford were to
unilaterally heighten its grading
standards, its graduates and stu
dents would be massacred in the
workplace. Clearly, action must be
taken by other universities as well
to ensure that grading does not
become a joke and that excellence
in a particular field is rewarded by
a grade that signifies excellence,
not mere adequacy.
Almost all the students at Stan
ford had 4.o's or thereabouts in
high school. However, so did many
thousands of other applicants who
were not accepted. Just as good
grades did not help these unlucky
students, likewise they will not
ensure that a Stanford student
will be recognized as excellent in
his or her post-collegiate life. How
ever, with fair and responsible
grading, perhaps a student's
marks will reveal what sets partic
ular students apart from others,
instead of being among the 35 per
cent who achieve "greatness."
