Ayn Rand Society takes umbrage with Daily editorial

AS PRESIDENT OF the Ayn Rand
Society, I would like to address a
few of the points you made in your
April 1 editorial criticizing my group's
People First! Day activities.
First of all, we have never said, as you
claim, that our mission "is merely to
raise debate" about environmentalism
and the value of Earth Day. In fact, our
mission is to eliminate Earth Day, by
detailing a reasoned position against it.
Secondly, we are not "engaging in
this bizarre ballet of boobishness as an
attention-getting device." While you may
see flyers like "Environmentalism
KILLS" as "superficial," I assure you we

are quite serious. Ultimately, environ
mentalism is an issue of production vs.
stagnation, life vs. death.
Sam Rayburn, as quoted in your edi
torial, was almost right: It does take a
carpenter to build a barn. But he can't
build anything if an army of jackasses,
from A 1 Gore to Paul Ehrlich to Donald
Kennedy, are tying his hands with envi
ronmental regulations. And more impor
tantly, he can't build if he insists on
tying his own hands by accepting the
environmentalist rhetoric and pseudo
science.
The lectures on April 14 are not
meant for the jackasses, but for the

metaphorical carpenters, the producers.
We aim to help the carpenters to see
environmentalism for the nonsense it is,
and thereby to free themselves from the
environmentalist ideas they may already
have accepted.
Finally, I would like to say a word
about the smear tactics employed by the
Daily editorial board. By stating that
"the Ayn Rand Society will undoubtedly
play the demagogue's hand in its Earth
Day diatribes," and that our only case is
"through manipulation or ignorance of
basic facts," The Daily does not make
any kind of counter-argument, but
merely smears whatever the Society or

our lecturers say, regardless of what we
say.
By using blatant arguments from
intimidation ("Stanford students are
smart enough to know that despite what
they might hear from the Fountain
heads The Daily hopes to harass
some students into not even listening to
what we have to say. Hopefully, those
who truly care about the facts will show
up at Cubberley Auditorium at 7 p.m. on
April 14, if only to show The Daily that
reason can win over intimidation.

Privacy, not sensationalism, needed in honor code cases

I AM DISMAYED by the sentiments
expressed by Bob Beyers, former direc
tor of Stanford News Service, in his
editorial letter printed in the March 30
issue of The Daily. He is of the opinion
that the names of students found guilty of
misconduct should be made public, osten
sibly to prevent a "shadow" from falling
on students not involved in the miscon
duct, but otherwise associated with the
class or group affected.
I fear this is the typical line of reason
ing employed by the press as it attempts

to interpose itself into every nook and
cranny of our private lives. There are
some affairs which do not benefit from
press scrutiny. There is no necessity for
the public to be involved in such events:
there is no "clear and present danger" and
the public does not benefit from the
knowledge. It is merely titillating and sells
newspapers.
Does Beyers sincerely believe a Stan
ford graduate will be denied career
advancement because he was a member of
a class in which someone is thought to

have cheated on an exam? Rather, the
sanctimonious Beyers may be interested
in publicly embarrassing students who
exhibited poor judgment, because it makes
a good newspaper story. The University is
correct to deal with these matters private
ly, where appropriate steps can be taken
deliberately without sensationalism.
The press, including The Daily, is quick
to print stories which excite the base
instincts. However, they are loathe to
print follow-ups when the stories prove to
be groundless. People's good names can be

damaged by zealous reporting of the
charges and only marginally exonerated
by the tiny follow-ups months later when
their innocence is established. This is why
I resist the urge to publicize every alleged
transgression, and even proven ones
which are of limited significance. Privacy
is threatened by the relentless onslaught
of cameras and microphones ... we had
better decide now where we want the line
to be drawn, or will be drawn for us.
