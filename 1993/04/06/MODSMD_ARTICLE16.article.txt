## An all-American dullard 
### 
KEVIN COSTNER is the anti-
Christ. OK, that's probably not
true. The Burger King guy, I'm
quite sure, is the anti-Christ. Neverthe
less, Kevin Costner remains a major
problem in popular American culture.
Through the phenomenal success of
his movies — and Conventional Wis
dom's necessitating of cataclysmic
changes once a decade, on the decade, in
American culture — Costner has
emerged as the prototype of the 1990's
American male,.
That's sad. Not because Mr. Costner is
a bad guy. I'm sure he's a fine husband
and parent, and probably mows his lawn
all the way to the edge of his property.
But his character on the screen — that's
right, the one that doesn't change
whether he's Robin Hood, an lowa
farmer or a gun-runner — consistently
undermines the image of the American
male.
If we hear so much about the respon
sibility of role-models —when a senior on
the UNLV basketball team takes Fresh
man English and a class on prevention of
pre-menstrual syndrome and has some
one else do his work for him — we should
hear even more when Kevin Costner
repeatedly portrays the American male
as a sterile, uninteresting, undriven
nothingness. And worse, when millions
love him for it.
Mr. Costner, give us the vitality of A 1
Pacino, the intrigue of Robert DeNiro,

the acting and heart of Denzel Washing
ton. Give us something, anything,
besides a $5 haircut and a stupid smile. I
need more from my heroes.
I don't ask much. I'm a midwestern
valued guy like you, Mr. Costner. But
even midwestern values can be interest
ing — look at the drive of Gene Hackman.
For God's sake, look at "Dave," the
founder of Wendy's, if that's more your
level of acting ability.
If you're going to be a sensitive guy,
wear a pony tail, a long one, and be proud
of it. If you're going to do a butt shot,
don't make it a long one of someone else's
butt. Carpe Diem, Kevin. Shake your own
tailfeather.
But unlike Mel Gibson, Costner
doesn't shake-up much of anythmg. He is
the consummate follower, not a leader.
He makes politically correct movies —
only after recognizing Native American
rights and interracial romance became
safe concepts — and somehow makes it
appear as though it was the white Amer
ican male (or worse yet, Costner himself)
who championed those causes.
We deserve better. Like Stephen Rea
in"The Crying Game," tackling an issue
of sexual politics which would drive most
Costner fans straight to the Maalox. But
no, Mr. Costner doesn't want to rumple
any feathers.
Costner's character, let's call him
"Nothing," seeks to please you, Constant
Audience, by not offending. Like some

kind of Academy Awards production
number, he seeks to please everyone and
loses all his vitality and possible appeal in
the process.
And yet, everything from a current
Cable TV commercial to People magazine
(Sexiest Man Alive) to drooling grand
mothers considers Costner everything
the American male should strive to be.
Has it come to this? Is our future filled
with sterile male figures who can satisfy
everyone and excite no one? Don't look
now, Pat O'Brien is hosting the Final
Four on CBS.
But maybe that's what we, want.
Maybe that's why Eric Clapton; Clint
Eastwood and Jimmy Connors couldn't
be heroes until they took the edge off
the characteristics which made them so
great in the first place. And maybe
that's why Mr. Costner himself became
the impotent mega-star he is, only after
interesting performances in "Fandan
go," "No Way Out" and "Bull
Durham."
Superman's dead. Kevin Costner lives.
I pray for America.

While not necessarily ascribing any of the
above views to her, John would like to
thank Kimberly Chrisman for her "moral
support" on this highly emotional column.
