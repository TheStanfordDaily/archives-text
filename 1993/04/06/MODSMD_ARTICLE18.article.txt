## Devens buckles down, steps up for Stanford tennis 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Last year, teammates may
have described Robert Devens as
the life of the party, but now the
junior from New York City is aii
business when he steps on the
tennis court.
After a freshman year in which
he saw no playing time on Stan
ford's prestigious men's tennis
team, Devens worked his way into
the bottom half of the lineup last
year and has made tremendous
improvement this season, jump
ing from No. 4 up to the No. 2
spot.
Ranked No. 20 nationally,
Devens (12-2) was the only unde
feated singles player on the Cardi
nal squad until last weekend
when the team was crushed by
USC and UCLA.
Devens attributes part of his
success this season to a change in
priorities. "I've been going to
sleep earlier (before matches) and
not looking ahead or taking
schools like UOP (University of
the Pacific) for granted," he said.
"Sometimes last year I wouldn't
even know we had a match until
noon of that day.
"Last year it was the seniors'
(Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee) job
to keep us in line," Devens said.
"Now [the juniors] have got to
take over a bit — there's more
pressure on us to perform."

'He doesn't possess
any one shot That is
overpowering,but
his versatility and
fighting spirit power
him.'

Without any superstars on the
squad, Devens stresses the need
for a united team effort. "Every
one needs to step up a notch if
we're going to compete with the
big teams."
Devens seems to be doing his
part with characteristic grit,
intensity and nerves of steel. "He
is extremely tough mentally," said
coach Dick Gould. "He keeps the
competition in perspective. ... If
there is any way he can beat you,
he will.
"He doesn't possess any one
shot that is overpowering," he
continued, "but his versatility and
fighting spirit power him."
Devens is effective from the back
court and deadly at the net, yet it
is his mental game which sets him
apart from the competition.
Over and over, Devens has
pulled out crucial matches
because of his aversion to losing.
Last spring in the second round of
the NCAA Championships, Stan
ford was locked in a close battle
with Louisiana State. At 5-5 in
the third set of his No. 4 singles
match, Devens developed heat
cramps and lost the match. Bare
ly able to walk, he came back on
the court to play doubles with
Michael Flanagan. Although he
hardly moved, Devens held serve
and the duo won the match 6-3, 6-
2 to clinch the Cardinal's team
victory.
This January, at the National
Collegiate Championships in
Palm Springs, Devens was
plagued by back spasms but man

aged to win his semifinal match
over Notre Dame's Mark Schmidt
7-6 (16-14), 1-6, 6-3 to become the
tournament's co-champion with
USC's Brian MacPhie.
"I was in a lot of pain staying

out there, but the guy got so ner
vous playing me that I was actual
ly at an advantage," Devens said.
A month later at the National
Indoor Intercollegiate Champi
onships, Devens pulled out a

gruelling 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 win over
Duke's Peter Ayers to give the
Cardinal a 5-2 victory. These
high-pressure wins have given
Devens a base on which he con
tinues to build.

"Once you win a few close
matches your confidence goes way
up," he explained. "Going into a
third set, I feel like I have the
advantage. That's a big difference
from last year."
