NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Two
blunders. Two national champi
onships for Dean Smith.
North Carolina capitalized on
a last-second mistake by Michi
gan and gave Smith his second
title with a 77-71 victory Mon
day night.
Both titles came at the Super
dome, but the 1982 game ended
on a closing jumper by Michael
Jordan and a botched pass by
Georgetown's Fred Brown. This
game wasn't settled until Michi
gan's Chris Webber called a
timeout the Wolverines didn't
have with 11 seconds left.
"In the heat of the moment,
strange things happen," Michi
gan coach Steve Fisher said.
"Chris said he heard someone
hollering and calling for a time
out. It's an awful way to end the
season."
The Tar Heels (34-4) won
with a powerful inside game of
Eric Montross and the three
point shooting of Donald
Williams as Michigan's Fab Five

lost in the title game for the sec
ond consecutive year.
Smith becomes the fourth
active coach to win two national
championships. Indiana's Bob
Knight has won three, while
Louisville's Denny Crum and
Mike Krzyzewski of Duke have
each won two. Only John Wood
en with 10 at UCLA, Adolph
Rupp of Kentucky with four and
Knight have won more than
Smith, who was making his
ninth appearance in a Final
Four.
North Carolina was leading
73-71 when Pat Sullivan missed
the second of two free throws
with 20 seconds left. Webber
grabbed the rebound, charged
up court and stopped in front of
his bench to call timeout. The
Wolverines had already used
their allotted three and a techni
cal foul was called.
Williams, who finished with
25 points, made both free
throws on the technical and he
added two more when he was

fouled on the ensuing posses
sion for the final margin.
When the buzzer sounded the
Tar Heels charged the court and
mobbed Smith, the second-win
ningest coach of all time who
had always been maligned for
his Final Four failures.
Asked about getting his sec
ond championship on a bizarre
play, Smith said, "I don't want
to say that was another fluke."
The Tar Heels got the lead for
good when Derrick Phelps
scored on a layup with 3:12 left
for a 68-67 lead. Jimmy King of
Michigan threw up an air ball
from 3-point range and the Tar
Heels extended the lead to three
when George Lynch scored in
the lane with 2:10 left. Mon
tross, who had 16 points,
dunked with one minute left and
it was the Tar Heels by six.
Ray Jackson's jumper with
47 seconds left brought Michi
gan within three again. An
unforced turnover gave the ball
back to the Wolverines and Web

ber scored on a rebound with 36
seconds left. Those were Michi
gan's final points for a season in
which it went 31-5, but failed
again in the final game.
Williams, the Tar Heels' only
legitimate perimeter threat, had
five 3-pointers in the semifinal
win over Kansas and he
matched that against Michigan
in 11 attempts.
While Williams was scoring
outside, Montross was occupy
ing most of the Michigan front
court inside. That allowed
Lynch to come up with 12 points
and 10 rebounds, and allowed
Williams to get off the long
jumpers.
Michigan had taken a 67-63
lead with 4:13 left on a jumper
by King, but Williams hit a 3-
pointer to bring the Tar Heels
within one and set the stage for
10-4 run that closed the game.
Webber finished with 23
points and grabbed 11 rebounds.
King had 15 points, while Jalen
Rose added 12.
