# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Over the weekend, Stanford's athletes
were competing all across the country and
doing the Cardinal proud. Swimmer Jenny
Thompson built on her first-place overall fin
ish at the NCAA Championships two weeks
ago by winning at the selection meet for the
U.S. Olympic Festival. John Hribar helped
lead the Cardinal volleyball team to two away

victories versus Loyola Marymount and Pep
perdine with flawless play.
Thompson exhibited her Olympic form at
the 1993 National Swimming Championships
in Nashville, Tenn., last week. Swimming
unattached for Seacoast Swim Association,
the sophomore opened the meet on Thursday
with a win in the 100-meter freestyle.
Her second title came on Saturday, as she
swam the 100 backstroke in a personal-best
time of 1 minute, 3.24 seconds. Winning by a
narrow 0.01 second margin, Thompson cap
tured her first national title in a stroke other
than freestyle. In addition, she notched a sec
ond-place finish in the 100 butterfly.
The Dover, N.H., native finished the meet
strongly on Sunday, earning the 50 free title
with a time of 25.77. For her efforts, Thomp
son won the Kiphuth Award and was the
high-point winner of the competition.
Thompson finished ahead of Californians
Janet Evans and Kristine Quance, who tied
for second.

Middle blocker John Hribar had an amaz
ing night against the Loyola Marymount
Lions on Friday, hitting .789. He was able to
follow this with an equally impressive effort
against the Pepperdine Waves on Saturday,
racking up a .722 hitting percentage and 13
kills. In both contests, Hribar had no errors.
Loyola Marymount appears to be a favorite
target of the 6-foot-6 senior from Pittsburgh,

Pa. Last season, he recorded a then career
high 14 digs and six blocks against the Lions.
His play this year sparked Stanford to two
key wins as it prepares for the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Championships in
three weeks. The Cardinal is currently ranked
second in the MPSF, with a 13-2 conference
record.
