Men's water polo
The Cardinal men's water polo team was dominant at a spring
season tournament held at Pepperdine last weekend, winning all
four of its exhibition games.
On Friday, Stanford used many counter-attack goals to best the
USC Trojans, 14-7. Saturday's double-header saw the Cardinal
come out on top twice, as Stanford beat UC-Irvine, 8-7, and Long
Beach State, 18-3. Stanford concluded the tournament on Sunday
with a 9-3 victory over Pepperdine, with the Cardinal outscoring
the Waves 4-0 in the fourth quarter.
Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti was pleased with the squad's
overall performance. According to the coach, it provided an early
indication that Stanford will once again contend for the national
title next year.
