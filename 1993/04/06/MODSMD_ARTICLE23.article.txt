# Rowers have trouble at San Diego Classic
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Hoping for a strong start to
the spring season at the San
Diego Crew Classic last week
end, the Cardinal men's and
women's crews instead endured
a difficult two days of racing, as
Washington swept every event
except the men's junior-varsity
race.
The men's crew team had
mixed results on Saturday and
Sunday. For the varsity, a poor
race in the Saturday heat, with
a time of 6 minutes, 16 seconds,
placed Stanford in the petite
final on Sunday. A finishing
time of 6:11 gave them an over
all place of eighth for the week
end.
"It was a disappointing week
end," said senior Tom Grace.
"There were a lot of things we
needed to do that didn't happen
the way they should."
The junior varsity had a good
race on Saturday, gaining a
berth in Sunday's final. Howev
er, a last-place finish in the
final gave them an overall place
of sixth. The freshman team,
competing in only one race, was
even with the other boats for
the first 1,000 meters but fell
behind in the second half of the
2,000-meter course and fin
ished at the back of the pack.
Citing early-season anxiety
and nervousness, Grace said the
team needs to get to work and
seriously look at how it wants
the season to progress after San
Diego.
"Our dual race schedule is
very comfortable for us," Grace
said. "We face a lot of small Cal

ifornia schools, and when some
thing like San Diego comes up,
we just haven't had the experi
ence against the top crews like
Washington, or been put in sit
uations where we had to make
hard choices."
The Cardinal women had an
equally challenging weekend of
races. The varsity came in fifth
of six boats on Saturday, but
turned it around Sunday to
place third in the petite final
with a time of 7:10, nine sec
onds behind first-place Wiscon
sin.
"We were scattered in our
Saturday race and we had some
problems at the start," said
senior Kristin Hubbard. "One
good thing from this race was
that we learned how to handle a
race, how to be professional and
composed. We have a pretty
young crew, so all we need now
is to be aggressive."
The junior-varsity crew qual
ified for the grand final with a
third-place finish on Saturday,
but came in last in Sunday's
final. Hubbard said the junior
varsity was happy to get to the
finals and knew they faced
tough competition in Washing
ton and California. Stan
ford's novice boat had an excel
lent race, coming from a full
boat-length back to within four
tenths of a second of first-place
UC-Irvine in their petite final.
"We were intimidated by the
other boats, no question about
it," said women's coach Wendy
Davis. "The team realized that
one bad race can put you out of
competition. I think the team is
ready to attack every race now
and not let up."
