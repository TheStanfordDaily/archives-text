If you think it's hard getting around campus
without suffering mutilation. from people
oblivious cyclists, try it blindfolded.
Students in Prof Jim Adams's "Mechanical
Engineering 223: Creative Problem Solving"
class went a step further yesterday, in an exer
cise designed to simulate the experience of
blind people. Blindfolded students, led by a
partner, attempted to maneuver one of cam
pus's busiest intersections.
"It's very scary," a blindfolded Jeff Marin
chak said. "I've been here (White Plaza) dozens

"lt's funny the things you're sensitive to
(with no sight)," Patty Wang said. "Light and
dark become very important and so does touch."
Students used the exercise to brainstorm
ideas to make the campus more accessible to
the blind. Marinchak's partner, sophomore

Kjetl Larsen, suggested restricting bicycle- and
car-accessible areas.
"People in cars or on bikes assume you see
them — I know I do. And maybe we could find
a way to let people know if they're blind."
Adams said the purpose of the exercise was
to make students more aware of the plight of
the blind. "Ever walk with a blindfold? You can
tell different things. You become sensitive to
things you don't normally," Adams said.
But the students' limited experience only
approximates that of a blind person, Adams ex
plained.
"Actually, what the students' experience
has very little to do with the life of a blind per-
