# Seeing the campus through different eyes Engineering students experience blind access problems firsthand

If you think it's hard getting around campus
without suffering mutilation. from people
oblivious cyclists, try it blindfolded.
Students in Prof Jim Adams's "Mechanical
Engineering 223: Creative Problem Solving"
class went a step further yesterday, in an exer
cise designed to simulate the experience of
blind people. Blindfolded students, led by a
partner, attempted to maneuver one of cam
pus's busiest intersections.
"It's very scary," a blindfolded Jeff Marin
chak said. "I've been here (White Plaza) dozens
of times, but it's still scary because of all the bi
cycles and cars."

"lt's funny the things you're sensitive to
(with no sight)," Patty Wang said. "Light and
dark become very important and so does touch."
Students used the exercise to brainstorm
ideas to make the campus more accessible to
the blind. Marinchak's partner, sophomore

Kjetl Larsen, suggested restricting bicycle- and
car-accessible areas.
"People in cars or on bikes assume you see
them — I know I do. And maybe we could find
a way to let people know if they're blind."
Adams said the purpose of the exercise was
to make students more aware of the plight of
the blind. "Ever walk with a blindfold? You can
tell different things. You become sensitive to
things you don't normally," Adams said.
But the students' limited experience only
approximates that of a blind person, Adams ex
plained.
"Actually, what the students' experience
has very little to do with the life of a blind per-
son. You become mostly con
cerned with falling down while a
person who is blind all their life
wouldn't be," he said.
"One of the main problems
blind people have are bicycles. If
you walk with a cane, the stick can
go between the wheels, and you'd
never notice until you'd tripped on
it," Adams continued. "Another
problem is holes, because if there's
a sign that says 'Danger,' it's not
much help to a blind person."
Marinchak said it was impor
tant to go slow and to be aware of
one's surroundings. "It's much
better with audible clues, like the
fountain. I've also learned that
bushes aren't very friendly —
they can scratch you."
Chris Carter cited another
problem. "In watching my partner
stumble with the blindfold, it was
interesting to see how people per
ceived him. They were laughing
and they thought it was all a big
joke. But it was probably because
he was wearing a blindfold."
