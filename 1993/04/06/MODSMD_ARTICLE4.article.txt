# Class of '97 may close gender gap

### Michael McCarroll Staff writer 
The Class of '97 may be the
first in Stanford's history in
which women outnumber men.
Stanford offered admission to
2,841, or 21 percent, of the ap
proximately 13,600 candidates
who applied in December. About
1,580 of the admitted students
are expected to enroll this fall,
and of these, more than half may
be women.
The number of men and women
admitted is the most equal in Stan
ford history â€” 50.1 percent men
and 49.9 percent women, versus
47.6 percent women in last year's
admitted class.
Yet, as Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions James Montoya
points out, women accept their
offers of admission to Stanford at
a higher rate than men, and so
next year's freshman class may
have a female majority.
According to Montoya, the
number of female applicants was
up 6 percent this year, reflecting
a rise in the number of women
applying to four-year institu
tions nationally.
Admission offers were mailed
to applicants from all 50 states as
well as 48 countries.
The number of international
students admitted was also high
er this year: 5.8 percent of the ad
mitted students are from other
countries, up from 4 percent last

year, even though Stanford can
only offer financial aid to be
tween 35 and 40 foreign stu
dents.
"There were simply a larger
number of foreign students who
could pay for themselves," said
Jon Reider, an associate director
of undergraduate admissions. He
added that several strong foreign
applicants already had offers of
support from their home govern
ments and did not need to avail of
Stanford's financial aid pro
gram.
Part of the increase was also
due to a greater number of appli
cants from Eastern European
countries, including the former
Soviet states and Yugoslavia.
The ethnic makeup of next
year's freshman class is remark
ably consistent with those admit
ted last year. Of the admitted
students, 9.3 percent are black,
24.7 percent are Asian-Ameri
can, 9.9 percent are
Chicano/Latino and 1.3 percent
are Native American.
"Even I am surprised by the
consistency of the numbers of
this class," Montoya said.
He said that there were no ef
forts to try to match the diversity
numbers of previous years. "At
the end of the process, we did not
'massage' the numbers," Mon
toya said. "What we see in [next
year's] freshman class is what re-
