# Getting a handle on bike traffic
## Raised pedestrian lanes a possibility for curbing wrecks 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
The white bicycle lanes
around campus, disregarded by
most Stanford cyclists, might be
replaced by bike traffic circles
and raised pedestrian sidewalks
under a new University pro
gram.
"Stanford has done a pretty
good job of planning for both au
tomobiles and pedestrians" but
bicycles have not been specifical
ly targeted, said Jeffrey Tumlin,
the special projects coordinator
for Transportation Programs.
As a result, Tumlin said there
has been chaos around campus.
"[The lack of planning] has
created unnecessary hazards for
pedestrians and an accident rate
that is unacceptably high," Tum
lin said. "We all know about the
problems in White Plaza and
around the clock tower."
Officials from Transportation
Programs, the Stanford Plan

ning Office and the Office of Pub
lic Safety are planning to hire a
consultant by May 1 to compose a
comprehensive bicycle plan for
the campus.
Though there are no specifics
yet, Tumlin already has a few
ideas, such as bicycle traffic cir
cles in congested areas like White
Plaza. Creating raised pedestri
an-only sidewalks in White Plaza
is another option, he said.
"I hope the consultant will
look at all the possibilities," he
said.
Tumlin is putting together an
advisory committee, comprised
of commuters, students and
other bicycle riders on campus,
which will work with the consul
tant in writing the plan.
Student input will also be so
licited during public meetings in
May. According to Tumlin, the
final draft should be ready by
Aug. 15.
Tumlin also plans to request
$50,000 from the General Plant
Improvement Fund — money
usually spent on automobile
parking lots and roads — to pay
for bicycle-related projects, par
ticularly parking facilities.
"We'll concentrate on the
dormitory areas because that's
where the theft rates are high
est," Tumlin said, adding that
80 percent of bike thefts occur
near dorms. Stanford police
reported 682 bicycle thefts last
year.
"There is almost no secure
bike parking any place at Stan
ford. . . . You need to be able to

lock your frame to something,"
Tumlin said.
He hopes that dorms will
eventually be equipped with
"bike corrals," covered struc
tures that would be kept locked
at all times.
Tumlin pointed to UC-Davis,
which he visited a few months
ago, as a good example of suc
cessful bicycle planning.
"It's a totally different
world. ... They banned automo
biles and kept bicycles on the
streets and pedestrians on the
sidewalk. They replaced stop signs
with traffic circles because stop
signs are a problem for bicycles,"
he said.
Though a ban on cars is unre
alistic, Tumlin said he hopes
that some of Davis' successes
can be emulated here.
