# Getting a handle on bike traffic
## Raised pedestrian lanes a possibility for curbing wrecks 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
The white bicycle lanes
around campus, disregarded by
most Stanford cyclists, might be
replaced by bike traffic circles
and raised pedestrian sidewalks
under a new University pro
gram.
"Stanford has done a pretty
good job of planning for both au
tomobiles and pedestrians" but
bicycles have not been specifical
ly targeted, said Jeffrey Tumlin,
the special projects coordinator
for Transportation Programs.
As a result, Tumlin said there
has been chaos around campus.
"[The lack of planning] has
created unnecessary hazards for
pedestrians and an accident rate
that is unacceptably high," Tum
lin said. "We all know about the
problems in White Plaza and
around the clock tower."
Officials from Transportation
Programs, the Stanford Plan

ning Office and the Office of Pub
lic Safety are planning to hire a
consultant by May 1 to compose a
comprehensive bicycle plan for
the campus.
Though there are no specifics
yet, Tumlin already has a few
ideas, such as bicycle traffic cir
cles in congested areas like White
Plaza. Creating raised pedestri
an-only sidewalks in White Plaza
is another option, he said.
"I hope the consultant will
look at all the possibilities," he
said.
Tumlin is putting together an
advisory committee, comprised
of commuters, students and
other bicycle riders on campus,
which will work with the consul
tant in writing the plan.
Student input will also be so
licited during public meetings in
May. According to Tumlin, the
final draft should be ready by
Aug. 15.
