Bosnia at war for one year

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— Marking the first anniversary of the
war that has shattered their lives and their
city, residents of Sarajevo waver between
resignation and disbelief.
Grim and exhausted, they live day to
day, struggling to survive amid the ruins
with U.N. handouts and a belief that the
Serb attackers will never take their city.
Today is regarded as the first anniver
sary of the war. Last April 6, the United
Nations recognized the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, and Serbs who oppose the
state's independence drive opened fire on
peace demonstrators.
The Bosnian government estimates
that 8,250 Sarajevans have died since then
and that 14,500 have been wounded.
Across the republic, more than 200,000

people are dead or missing, the govern
ment says.
No official observance was planned.
10 killed in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)
— Ten black ANC supporters were killed
early yesterday when masked assailants
blasted the home they were sleeping in
with bullets and a hand grenade.
It was the country's third massacre
since Friday, the day after black and white
political parties met in Johannesburg to
resume constitutional talks and seek a
negotiated end to apartheid.
Political violence has derailed negotia
tions previously and some analysts believe
the mass killings could be an attempt to
spoil the current talks.
