# Senate deadlocked on jobs bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House signaled yesterday that it was
prepared to compromise on its jobs bill
as Senate Democrats and Republicans
hunted for a way to end their standoff
over the $16.3 billion package.
Behind the scenes, the two sides
searched for a compromise over the jobs
bill, a central ingredient of Clinton's
prescription for economic recovery.
Republicans want to trim the measure
and pay for it by cutting other pro
grams.
GOP lawmakers crowed that the
episode shows the White House won't
be able to ignore them on future issues.
On the Senate floor, Democrats
failed for the third time to find enough
votes to halt a GOP filibuster that has
stalled the bill for over a week. This
time, the vote to halt the delays was 49-
29 — 11 votes short of the 60 needed to
clear the waf for a vote on final passage.

Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, conceded that the
message was becoming clear, even
before he held a fruitless meeting with
his GOP counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole, R-
Kan.
"If we can't get 60 votes, we can't
pass this bill in its present form so we'll
have to do the best we can to get as close
to that as possible," he said.
On his way to an opening day base
ball game in Baltimore, Clinton jabbed
at Republicans for the stalemate.
"In a time when no new jobs are
being created ... it means that for polit
ical purposes, they are willing to deny
jobs to places like Baltimore, Dallas,
Houston, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
and Cleveland and Seattle," he told
reporters.
White House spokesman George
Stephanopoulos suggested that a com
promise was possible. He said the White

House would follow Mitchell's lead.
As the Senate debated the measure,
Republicans showed no signs of folding.
All of them present voted to continue
their delaying tactics.
"We're prepared to discuss working
out some compromise if that's the
word," said Dole. "First we're going to
cut it, and then we're going to pay for
it."
The jobs measure would finance
everything from jobs at Head Start
preschool centers to making govern
ment buildings more energy efficient.
The administration says the measure
would create more than 200,000 jobs.
Republicans said they would support
a bill worth about half the $16.3 billion
Clinton wants, including $4 billion for
benefits for long-term jobless Ameri
cans. But they said they wanted to offset
much of it with cuts in other programs
— a condition Democrats were opposing.
