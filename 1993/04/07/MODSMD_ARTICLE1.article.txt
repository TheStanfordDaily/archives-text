# An apathetic constituency
## Does a lack of candidates indicate a loss of faith in student government?

Editor's note: This is the second article in a
two-part series.
With only 30 candidates vying for 40
ASSU Senate seats and only one slate run
ning for Council of Presidents, the wave of
distaste for student government that the"I
Prefer Not To Have a COP" slate rode to vic
tory last spring seems to have carried over
into this year's elections.
Even more threatening to the ASSU, stu
dents may have lost faith in their ability to af
fect change through their elected officials. Ap
athy toward the ASSU, by most accounts, is
running high throughout the student popula
tion.
"I think it's unfortunate," said graduate
senator Kevin Murdock. "There is a general
level of frustration among students trying to
have an effect on the University."
"Student opinion has gone sour, become
negative," agreed ASSU Financial Manager
Christine Vargas.
Without a COP this year, both ASSU offi
cials and the student body have had consider
able time for political soul-searching. Senate
leaders claim the ASSU has been active, but
many students have not taken the time to no
tice.
"There are a lot of positive things that
come out of the ASSU," Senate Chair Ron
Brown said. "Students should be aware of
what the ASSU does for them."
"Much of the ASSU's work is done behind
the scenes," added undergraduate senator
Ying-Ying Goh.
Fables of past reconstruction
Student apathy appears to be a
perennial concern for the ASSU. "I
was here for the last incarnation of
the 'do-nothing' spirit in 1986,"
said graduate senator Derek Miya
hara. In that year, the Hammer
and Coffin slate won the COP race
and threatened to disband the sen
"This whole 'I Prefer Not to'
business is nothing new," he said.
Now Miyahara believes the
ASSU is caught in a vicious circle.
"When you don't have a COP, it
doesn't appear as if things are get
ting done," he said, "and people
want to spend time doing things at
a place where things are going to
happen."
Murdock, too, said student
enthusiasm has dampened with
out a COP. "The things that get

people involved and interested are
those things that the COP does."
"I wouldn't call the problem a
structural one," Brown said. "Stu
dents just don't feel they can have
a positive impact on the University
through the ASSU."
Brown contends that there is a
lack of "perceived success" in the
ASSU — students simply do not
know what their government is
doing, and therefore conclude it is
doing nothing. That issue, one
connected largely to public rela
tions, also would have been partly
alleviated with a COP, senate lead
ers believe.
"In the freshman class, people
don't even know what a COP is —
how can we expect them to partici
pate if they have never seen any of
the ASSU's effects?" asked Goh.
Miyahara said the COP was
particularly adept at "generating
its own publicity. It's hard to see
much happening in the govern
ment when you only hear from the
senate once every two weeks."
"This past year things have
happened in the ASSU," Goh said.

"But people haven't been taking
the initiative to let the students
know about these successes."
Student apathy, then, may have
perpetuated itself without the
body that was designed to create
interest in the ASSU — the Coun
cil of Presidents.
A bum rap
Even with the problems facing
the ASSU this year, students con
tinue to ask, "Why should we
care?"
According to Paul Szczesiul,
associate director of Tresidder
Union, students should be con
cerned about the ASSU's continu
ing role in the University.
"While the student government
may not be perfect, it offers a voice
for students that would otherwise
not be there," he said. A less effec
tive ASSU "makes it difficult for
the University to see what prob
lems are facing the students and
what the students want to do
about them."
ASSU leaders believe their
organization has received an

unwarranted bum rap. "I think
people forget just how much the
ASSU does for them," such as
funding student organizations,
said Vargas. "The University cuts
back, but we are still there."
Brown, who is running on the
lone COP slate this election, said,
"There are a lot of positive results
coming out of the ASSU. If you are
in a student group that is receiving
funds, or have ever been to a
speech sponsored by the Speakers
Bureau, you've benefitted from
us." The ASSU, he asserted, is still
a viable body.
But others think it may be time
to rethink the entire system. "I
think the ASSU still has a pur
pose, if it is structured in a differ
ent way," said Ted Lai, a member
of the Prefer slate. "Maybe it's too
large for its own good."
"Maybe we need to bring to the
surface some new ideas," Dean of
Students Michael Jackson said.
"Maybe the ASSU should be more
of a business association than a
governing association. Maybe our
system is outdated."

What next?
As it stands now, a reprise of
last year's Prefer drama this
spring is unlikely. The Prefer slate
reneged on its promise to place an
amendment that would abolish
the COP on this year's ballot. With
no one running against "A Clean
Slate" — which includes juniors
Brown, Goh, Delia Lopez and
Jason Snyder — it appears the
COP will be resurrected.
Despite the absence of heated
races for either the senate or the
COP, Miyahara believes student
government has reached a critical
juncture. "A lot depends on next
year," he said. "If the ASSU does
something good, it's back in busi
ness. If it flounders, it's in trou
ble."
Undergraduate senator Mork
Murdock, for one, is optimistic. "I
think there is a political energy
this year," he said. "With the like
lihood of there being a COP, with
the senators running all looking
towards coming up with a common
student agenda and working
towards it as a team, I think we'll

see something the senate and the
COP has never seen."
Ultimately, though, the success
of this student government will
rest with the constituency itself.
"If there is a continued deteriora
tion of student interest," said
Nanci Howe, associate director of
Tresidder Union, "there will be a
continued deterioration of the
quality of the government."
The disenchantment of stu
dents with their government and
subsequent lack of involvement
may not, indeed, be anything new.
But if the muddled year without a
COP made anything clear, it is
that the survival of student gov
ernment is inexorably linked to the
satisfaction of the electorate; that
satisfaction, in turn, is met only
when concerted ASSU action
engages student interest.
"Things evolve," Jackson said.
"They tend to ebb and flow."
And if the ASSU does not con
vince students it is meeting their
needs, it may — like last year's
COP — be swept away with the
tide.

know what their government is
doing, and therefore conclude it is
doing nothing. That issue, one
connected largely to public rela
tions, also would have been partly
alleviated with a COP, senate lead
ers believe.
"In the freshman class, people
don't even know what a COP is —
how can we expect them to partici
pate if they have never seen any of
the ASSU's effects?" asked Goh.
Miyahara said the COP was
particularly adept at "generating
its own publicity. It's hard to see
much happening in the govern
ment when you only hear from the
senate once every two weeks."
"This past year things have
happened in the ASSU," Goh said.

"But people haven't been taking
the initiative to let the students
know about these successes."
Student apathy, then, may have
perpetuated itself without the
body that was designed to create
interest in the ASSU — the Coun
cil of Presidents.
A bum rap
Even with the problems facing
the ASSU this year, students con
tinue to ask, "Why should we
care?"
According to Paul Szczesiul,
associate director of Tresidder
Union, students should be con
cerned about the ASSU's continu
ing role in the University.
"While the student government
may not be perfect, it offers a voice
for students that would otherwise
not be there," he said. A less effec
tive ASSU "makes it difficult for
the University to see what prob
lems are facing the students and
what the students want to do
about them."
ASSU leaders believe their
organization has received an

unwarranted bum rap. "I think
people forget just how much the
ASSU does for them," such as
funding student organizations,
said Vargas. "The University cuts
back, but we are still there."
Brown, who is running on the
lone COP slate this election, said,
"There are a lot of positive results
coming out of the ASSU. If you are
in a student group that is receiving
funds, or have ever been to a
speech sponsored by the Speakers
Bureau, you've benefitted from
us." The ASSU, he asserted, is still
a viable body.
But others think it may be time
to rethink the entire system. "I
think the ASSU still has a pur
pose, if it is structured in a differ
ent way," said Ted Lai, a member
of the Prefer slate. "Maybe it's too
large for its own good."
"Maybe we need to bring to the
surface some new ideas," Dean of
Students Michael Jackson said.
"Maybe the ASSU should be more
of a business association than a
governing association. Maybe our
system is outdated."

What next?
As it stands now, a reprise of
last year's Prefer drama this
spring is unlikely. The Prefer slate
reneged on its promise to place an
amendment that would abolish
the COP on this year's ballot. With
no one running against "A Clean
Slate" — which includes juniors
Brown, Goh, Delia Lopez and
Jason Snyder — it appears the
COP will be resurrected.
Despite the absence of heated
races for either the senate or the
COP, Miyahara believes student
government has reached a critical
juncture. "A lot depends on next
year," he said. "If the ASSU does
something good, it's back in busi
ness. If it flounders, it's in trou
ble."
Undergraduate senator Mork
Murdock, for one, is optimistic. "I
think there is a political energy
this year," he said. "With the like
lihood of there being a COP, with
the senators running all looking
towards coming up with a common
student agenda and working
towards it as a team, I think we'll

see something the senate and the
COP has never seen."
Ultimately, though, the success
of this student government will
rest with the constituency itself.
"If there is a continued deteriora
tion of student interest," said
Nanci Howe, associate director of
Tresidder Union, "there will be a
continued deterioration of the
quality of the government."
The disenchantment of stu
dents with their government and
subsequent lack of involvement
may not, indeed, be anything new.
But if the muddled year without a
COP made anything clear, it is
that the survival of student gov
ernment is inexorably linked to the
satisfaction of the electorate; that
satisfaction, in turn, is met only
when concerted ASSU action
engages student interest.
"Things evolve," Jackson said.
"They tend to ebb and flow."
And if the ASSU does not con
vince students it is meeting their
needs, it may — like last year's
COP — be swept away with the
tide.
Editor's note: This is the second article in a
two-part series.
With only 30 candidates vying for 40
ASSU Senate seats and only one slate run
ning for Council of Presidents, the wave of
distaste for student government that the"I
Prefer Not To Have a COP" slate rode to vic
tory last spring seems to have carried over
into this year's elections.
Even more threatening to the ASSU, stu
dents may have lost faith in their ability to af
fect change through their elected officials. Ap
athy toward the ASSU, by most accounts, is
running high throughout the student popula
tion.
"I think it's unfortunate," said graduate
senator Kevin Murdock. "There is a general
level of frustration among students trying to
have an effect on the University."
"Student opinion has gone sour, become
negative," agreed ASSU Financial Manager
Christine Vargas.
Without a COP this year, both ASSU offi
cials and the student body have had consider
able time for political soul-searching. Senate
leaders claim the ASSU has been active, but
many students have not taken the time to no
tice.
"There are a lot of positive things that
come out of the ASSU," Senate Chair Ron
Brown said. "Students should be aware of
what the ASSU does for them."
"Much of the ASSU's work is done behind
the scenes," added undergraduate senator
Ying-Ying Goh.
Fables of past reconstruction
Student apathy appears to be a
perennial concern for the ASSU. "I
was here for the last incarnation of
the 'do-nothing' spirit in 1986,"
said graduate senator Derek Miya
hara. In that year, the Hammer
and Coffin slate won the COP race
and threatened to disband the sen
"This whole 'I Prefer Not to'
business is nothing new," he said.
Now Miyahara believes the
ASSU is caught in a vicious circle.
"When you don't have a COP, it
doesn't appear as if things are get
ting done," he said, "and people
want to spend time doing things at
a place where things are going to
happen."
Murdock, too, said student
enthusiasm has dampened with
out a COP. "The things that get

people involved and interested are
those things that the COP does."
"I wouldn't call the problem a
structural one," Brown said. "Stu
dents just don't feel they can have
a positive impact on the University
through the ASSU."
Brown contends that there is a
lack of "perceived success" in the
ASSU — students simply do not
know what their government is
doing, and therefore conclude it is
doing nothing. That issue, one
connected largely to public rela
tions, also would have been partly
alleviated with a COP, senate lead
ers believe.

don't even know what a COP is —
