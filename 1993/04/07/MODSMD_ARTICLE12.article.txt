King trial testimony ends
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Testimony ended in
the federal Rodney King beating trial yester
day after prosecutors showed jurors a video
tape of one policeman condemning his co
defendants and his sergeant returned to the
stand to rebut him.
Sgt. Stacey Koon's attempt to contradict
Officer Theodore Briseno's taped testimony
from last year's state trial gave a prosecutor an
opportunity to tell jurors a Briseno remark
that had been edited out of the videotape —
that he believed another officer was "out of
control" during the beating.
Briseno broke ranks with his fellow police
men in the state trial, in which they were
acquitted of nearly all charges.
He joined their defense in the current trial
on federal civil rights charges, and he didn't
testify.
