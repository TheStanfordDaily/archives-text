# Huge radioactive waste explosion in Russia

### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” A tank of radioac
tive waste exploded and burned yester
day at a weapons plant in the Siberian
city of Tomsk-7, contaminating a vast
area and exposing firefighters to danger
ous levels of radiation, Russian officials
said.
The accident could be among the
worst in the former Soviet Union since a
reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in Ukraine exploded in 1986, spew
ing radiation across Europe.
It was unclear how much radiation
was released in the accident, or how
many people might be affected.
But the Interfax news agency report
ed that about 2,500 acres were contami
nated with radiation from the explosion.
It said the wind was carrying the radia
tion toward unpopulated areas.
Vitaly Nasonov, a spokesman for the
Nuclear Energy Ministry, said some fire
fighters at the scene were exposed to

dangerous levels of radiation. Interfax
said the maximum dose among the fire
fighters was 0.6 roentgens.
Interfax reported that radiation levels
around the plant were 30-40 milliroent
gens per hour.
Roland Finston, a health physicist at
Stanford, said that the firefighters' dose
"would not cause any clinically
detectable illness." The average accept
able dose for nuclear workers is 2.0
roentgens per year according to the
International Commission on Radiologi
cal Protection.
But he said that the level around the
plant "is quite a lot if it persists for a long
time. Anyone who spent more than a
couple of days in the area would be above
acceptable levels and at increased risk for
cancer."
The initial radiation emission from
the Chernobyl explosion was about 200
roentgens an hour. Official statistics say

31 people were killed by the Chernobyl
accident, but some scientists say thou
sands in the region have died of radia
tion-related illnesses since then.
The international environmental
group Greenpeace said the explosion
took place in a plutonium separation fac
tory, part of a secret nuclear weapons
complex in Tomsk-7.
Greenpeace said the explosion appar
ently did not involve plutonium, which is
fatal if inhaled in even microscopic
amounts. The group said its information
came from conversations with Nuclear
Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov.
Tomsk-7 is believed to be about 12
miles outside Tomsk, a city of 500,000
people about 1,700 miles east of Moscow.
But because Tomsk-7 is secret, it does
not appear on ordinary maps.
No efforts to evacuate the region were
reported.
During the Soviet era, secret cities

were set up across Russia to work on mil
itary projects, including the Soviet nucle
ar weapons program.
In 1990, the Tomsk-7 complex was
blamed for contaminating the nearby
Tom River with nuclear waste. At least
38 people were hospitalized in that inci
dent.
Authorities said the tank that explod
ed contained a solution of uranium
waste products, and the cause of the
explosion was under investigation.
Greenpeace said the explosion appar
ently was caused by a rapid increase in
temperature in the tank after nitric acid
was added to the uranium.
Although the tank was made of stain
less steel, buried in the earth and covered
by a concrete slab, the explosion "has
released all of the radioactive materials
into the atmosphere and surrounding
environment," Greenpeace said in a
written statement.
