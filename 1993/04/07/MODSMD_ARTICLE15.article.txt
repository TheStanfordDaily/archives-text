## A 						competent sidekick... 
### 
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE
role of a university provost
is equivalent to that of the
Vice President of the United
States.
Let's hope not — in a time
when Stanford does not have
pennies to spare on its adminis
tration, the last thing we need is
a figurehead and presidential
sidekick.
As the University searches for
a permanent replacement for
Interim Provost Gerald Lieber
man, the search committee
needs to keep in mind that now,
more than ever, Stanford needs
an effective and efficient person
who will be a crucial member of
the president-provost team.
While Casper is interacting
with members of the University
community, the provost needs to
take care of day-to-day adminis
trative functions so the presi

dent can continue to be visible
and accessible.
At a time when a young
administration is still adjusting
to its recent reorganization, the
provost will have the opportuni
ty to help restructure adminis
trative roles, as well as redefine
his or her own position.
Limited financial and staff
resources will demand that the
provost seek the most efficient
ways to run the administrative
business smoothly without over
looking the input of outside voic
es, from students, faculty and
fellow administrators.
As the University continues to
chart its course through stormy
seas, teamwork — between the
provost and the president, as
well as between the administra
tion and the rest of the Universi
ty — will be pertinent to Stan
ford's success.
