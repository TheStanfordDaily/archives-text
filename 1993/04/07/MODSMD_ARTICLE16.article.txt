# and improved offerings

### 
After decades of at
least partial exclusion from
U.S. history books and aca
demic study in general, the time
has come to recognize the Asian-
American experience as a bona
fide area worthy of study. What
better place to start than Stan
ford?
In light of a new survey con
ducted by the Independent Sur
vey Project, a student-run study
polling over 1,000 Stanford stu
dents, popular support seems to
be behind the creation of such a
program. It is now fitting for the
University to address the need
for substantial course offerings,
focusing on the issues and expe
riences of the Asian-American
community.
Unfortunately, budget cuts
and financial restraints will most
likely spoil the christening of an
independent program. However,
several options exist, including
the addition of a concentration in

the existing American Studies
program. The University would
provide the minimal funds
required to hire a project coordi
nator, in charge of seeking out
faculty willing to teach Asian-
American studies courses.
Admittedly, the figure of 65
percent of students in favor of, as
well as 20 percent strongly sup
porting, the creation of an Asian-
American Studies Program does
not mean all those students
would choose to major in this
area. However, the numbers do
suggest that an expansion of the
number of classes would be a
move which would be beneficial
to and heralded by the University
community. Similar to the
African and Afro-American
Department, whose student
majors number 18, and whose
benefits are felt campus-wide,
this Asian-American concentra
tion would go a long way toward
satisfying student demands.
