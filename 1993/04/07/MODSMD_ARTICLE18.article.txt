## America's favorite pastime 
### 
AT LAST. DAY before yesterday,
it finally began. Another glorious
season, bringing with it a sine
wave of highs and lows, of joys and sor
rows. Of tried-and-true consistencies,
and eye-opening surprises. And we're
not talkin' about spring.
We're talkin' baseball.
As far as I'm concerned, the year can
be split into two parts. One six-month
season, and one six-month off-season.
And folks, the season's a-turnin'.
Well, yes, it is a game. Some would
even call it a simple game; all you do is
run, throw, catch and hit. But don't you
dare define it as just that. Baseball is
more than just a game. Much more.
Baseball is going to the ballpark,
emerging from the tunnel to the striking
green of the grass. It's someone singing
the national anthem, where the "home
of the brave play ball." It's the vendors
selling peanuts and popcorn. It's that
stupid wave thing, and even more stupid
dot races. It's the heckler whose funny
quotient is inversely proportional to the
inning.
It's an escape. Going to the ballpark
to take part in a little mellow-drama is
the perfect cure for the overworked or
the depressed. Even if your team loses,
you still get to spend three hours with
the players.
It's art. The swing of Will Clark. A per
fectly executed bunt or 6-4-3 double play.
A curveball. They're all pure poetry.

It's elation. And it's despair. And it's
a place where either can be illicited in
seconds. Two out, bottom of the ninth,
tying run on second. Tell me you can't
feel the excitement in the air so thick
you can cut it with a knife.
It's tradition. For more than 100
years, baseball has been one of the few
dependable constants in our society.
Through the wars, the depressions,
baseball has been there. Through the
administrations of liberals and conser
vatives, through the lives of countless
individuals, baseball has been there.
It has been a microcosm of society. It
saw the beginnings of integration with
Jackie Robinson, the era of institutional
corruption with Shoeless Joe Jackson
and Pete Rose, and the undeniable force
of of commercialism with the introduc
tion of artificial turf, the designated hit
ter and lights at Wrigley Field.
Baseball follows the themes of all
great literature. Wanna hear a story
about the unknown stranger coming
through to save the day? Let me tell you
about a young man named Francisco
Cabrerra and his moment of glory in
game seven of last year's National
League Championship Series. Wanna
see a comedy? Let me take you to a
Rockies or Marlins game, or at least let
me tell you about last year's Dodgers.
Wanna hear a tragedy? Let me tell you
about the untimely deaths of Cleveland
Indian relievers Steve Olin and Tim

Crews.
And like literature, baseball is a com
mon denominator among people. You
can go anywhere and strike up a conver
sation about the local baseball team.
Can they do it this year? Every team is a
potential champion, except maybe the
Cubs.
It is clear, simple and pure. Differen
tiating good and evil is as easy as identi
fying the home and away teams. We
know what success is, and what failure
is. We know when to cheer, and when to
boo.
Maybe it's not the fastest-moving of
sports. Maybe it doesn't have the best
athletes. Maybe the players have start
ed to become too much like business
men.
But baseball is still baseball. It's the
pick-up game in the empty lot down the
street. It's a coach arguing with an
umpire. It's the kid from the projects
making it. It's counting down the days
until "pitchers and catchers report." It's
a dog and a beer in the cheap seats.
It's a game, but it's a heck of a lot
more. It's . . . baseball.

Mike Langford also thinks that Suzy-
Q's, uelcro and Evel Kneivel are all
metaphors for life.
