Frosh English class sizes limited; students must be flexible

AS AN OFFICE ASSISTANT in the
Freshman English Department for
the past three years, I have seen a
lot of students come and go. I have seen
arrogant, self-important students bop into
the office in the spring of their senior year
and demand they be placed into an
already-full Freshman English class so
they can graduate. I have seen student
after student come in to change their
Freshman English class because it con
flicts with another class they must take.
And I have also seen students like Joey
Rosenblum, who upon strolling into the
Bookstore, decide "Gee, these books look
cool, I think I'll switch my Freshman
English class."
What many of these students fail to
realize is that all of the Freshman English
classes have a limited enrollment size. The
reason for this is simple. The smaller the
class size, the more individual attention
each student receives. However, because
enrollment is limited, students cannot
switch into a class unless another student
decides to drop out of it or unless the pro

fessor decides that he or she can handle
another student. While this may seem like
a "minor bureaucratic hell," it seems to
me to be a reasonable price to pay for
small class sizes. Sure, I was none too
pleased to fmd out that my Freshman
English class met at 8:30 a.m. Sure, I
would have liked to switch to a later class.
However, like the other students in my
class, I dealt with it.
This is not to say that those of us at the
Freshman English office are unsympathet
ic toward the plight of students like Rosen
blum. There is nothing the department
secretary, Dolores Rainer, likes to see
more than happy, satisfied students. While
Rosenblum mentions that the Freshman
English office had "suddenly turned hos
tile now that classes had begun," he mis
takenly attributes that hostility to the
Freshman English Department. He fails to
take into account that when he
approached Rainer she was in the middle
of mediating a dispute between three war
ring freshmen and dealing with an influx
of seven other students who were demand

ing that by some feat of magic she create
space in a full class. If anyone is being hos
tile I would say it is the students who want
miracles and will settle for nothing less.
It is unfortunate that Rosenblum got
caught in the cross-fire, but to denounce
the Freshman English program on the
basis of one encounter seems short-sighted
and a bit childish. Also, I find it quite iron
ic that for a person who has "never agreed
with the existence of Freshman English,"
Rosenblum obviously found some of the
classes worth his time, as his desire to get
into them indicates.
No one is doubting Rosenblum's intelli
gence or ability to spell. I'm sure Rosen
blum is every bit the budding Hemingway
he claims to be. Perhaps in his case, he is
such a smart and special individual that he
cannot benefit whatsoever from a writing
course. But I seriously doubt that Fresh
man English is a "waste of time for most
students." The Freshman English Depart
ment receives student evaluations of each
of the Freshman English classes taught,
and one of the most common statements

seen on them is "I feel that my writing has
improved."
We all hate bureaucracy. Indeed, it
would be nice if all 1,500 incoming fresh
men could choose their Freshman English
section and get their first choice. Despite
what some students may think, we do not
sit in the Freshman English office design
ing ways to frustrate students. Rainer
tries to accommodate as many students as
possible. However, when 30 students want
to get into an 18-person class, someone is
going to go away unhappy.
Until the day comes when every stu
dent finds every class "amazing," the best
advice I can give to students in Rosen
blum's position is to make the best out of
what you got. Perhaps the class to which
you have been assigned does not immedi
ately thrill you to the depths of your soul,
but there is something new and different
to be learned from each Freshman English
class. And after all, I think we are here to
learn.
