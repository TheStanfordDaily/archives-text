# Rosenblum's writing proves he really needs a Frosh English class
## 
### 
After reading Joey Rosenblum's letter
in The Daily, I found some of his propos
als interesting and his experiences with
the English department to be truly
lamentable. I ei\joyed the humor he
employed in the ninth paragraph,
through which he alluded to his mastery
of spelling and syntax. However, it is clear
to me that his understanding of correct
grammar and word usage needs some
enhancement.
For instance, in the second and third
paragraphs he begins sentences with con
junctions. Although this can be used for
effect and to improve the flow of a passage,

I think that the editorial page of the news
paper is not the best place for this level of
informality. He is arguing an important
point; it is better to think of transitions
that rise to the level of the discussion.
He makes a number of errors concern
ing verbs. For example, he makes an error
in verb tense in the fourth paragraph.
Instead of, "The next step was approach
ing ..." he needs to write, "The next step
was to approach...
Beware of redundancies. He states,
"And fearing a storm of rage and wrath, I
was mildly pleased at the pleasant help I
got." If one fmds something pleasant, it is
understood that it is pleasing to him. One
would not say, "I found the information to
be informative."
His final group of mistakes, and in my
opinion the most serious, concern his use
of colloquialisms. In all cases they are con
fusing and break the flow of his narrative.

Do the classes he refers to in the second
paragraph deal with an unknown number
of fairy tales, or do the stories covered in
the class deal with material of possible
fairy tale nature? His insertion of the
phrase "something like" in the first para
graph is unnecessary at best and lame
brained at worst (like, OMIGOSH; total
gag-o-rama).
Joey may feel that this response is too
critical and nit-picking. He may feel this is
a campus newspaper where only true sub
stance matters, regardless of the style it is
wrapped in. However, if he is arguing that
Freshman English is unnecessary for most
students, he needs to do everything he can
to convince the reader that he is part of
that nuyority. Although the style of his let
ter is not terrible it operates wholly against
the point he is trying to make.
