## Cruel and unusual punishment: a successful ex-boyfriend 
### 
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING
here? Not that my parents don't
eryoy life in the trailer park; the
Thursday evening hoe-downs are fab. And I
like wearing hand-me-downs. Really. And
Tender Vittles don't taste so bad, once you
get used to it.
Meow.
But after going home for spring break to
find some curious situations in the old
Home Town, I figure it's time to reevaluate
my life plans.
It's an ex-boyfriend thing.
Yes, the boy who spent several hours of
quality time with yours truly in the back of
a white Mazda truck with tinted windows.
The one who couldn't grasp the whole the
bra-hooks-in-the-front concept, much less
algebra. Mr. C'mon-I've-got-a-condom.
No, he wasn't a Kennedy.
Dan, one of those guys who wasn't good
with book learning, but could flirt his way
out of detention after painting his name on
all the skylights in every hallway in school.
The one who was student-body president
after throwing a campaign keg party and
handing out stickers with the subtle phrase

"Dan ... hard as a rock."
Swoon. What a man.
So I go home this vacation, ready to wow
all my Carl's Junior cashier friends with a
few more stories about what it's like to actu
ally live outside your parents' house and to
take classes which don't mention "oil vis
cosity" or "the art of gather and tuck."
Egoiste. Egoiste. Egoiste.
So as my friends and I sat down to watch
"The Wall" for the 200 billionth time, dis
cussing the semantics of life without eye
brows, and the fact that it would have been
"killer" to burn Ms. Sacco the festering
trigonometry puss-bag just like in the
movie, I bring Dan's name up.
You know, the same-old same-old. Is he
balding yet? Did he ever get kicked out for
throwing that bring-your-own-paint-thin
ner sniffing party? How's his pit bull? And
does he have a girlfriend and would she
mind if he and I scammed over break since
the dating scene at my school tends to leave
me unfulfilled every now and then?
Subtlety is the key.
Nope. Nobody's heard of him lately.
Maybe he's finally enrolled in the local J.C.

Maybe he decided to pursue that career in
the T-shirt production industry after all.
Wait, he's in Colorado.
So, Dan-the-man's'in Colorado. Just like
two years ago when he was my hometown
honey, dropping me off on his way up to the
Rockies to sell himself into ski-resort maid
dom, to make peoples' beds in return for
free lift tickets.
Dare to dream.
And just as I get to be feeling pretty
content with my knowledge of 19th-centu
ry Argentinian romanticists and the land
grant laws of colonial Mexico, I get an
interesting little phone call.
Hey, Dan, need a quick bail-bond? Look
ing for a little stability from the only person
you know who can read a newspaper when
its upside-down? Want the name of a good
lawyer with a decent three-piece suit? Or a
blanket — I hear the winters up there get
mighty cold.
Putting a whole Doc Martens factory in
my mouth.
Dan, as a tribute to the value of a higher
education, is living in Denver. His resort job
fell through after he couldn't find housing

and there "weren't enough babes." So my lit
tle tofu brain headed to the city to find a job.
Pray tell in what, I asked. Sour cream
squirter at Taco Bell? Mine sweeper? Crash
dummy?
Laugh while you can.
My little lotus blossom had gathered a
portfolio after working one year at a graph
ics company for god-damned $5-an-hour, 20
hours a week, and turned it into some brain
washing, real-seeming resume. My pachy
derm of passion had gotten, may ferrets nib
ble at his genitalia, a real job.
God hates me.
LovemufFin now rents a four-bedroom
house in a major city of the United States —
because he thinks it's cool— and owns his
own computer, fax machine and car.
The main drawback, my beloved Aus
tralopithecus laments, is the dance clubs in
Denver aren't over-18, so as a 20-year-old,
he has nowhere to go.
God really, really hates me.
He says it's great. I should come out for a
visit. He'll pay for anyone who wants to
come out and settle down's airfare.
Oh, how sweet of him.

All those hours discussing Aeneas' trou
bles in CIV. All those oh-so-important "little
lessons" I couldn't have learned anywhere
else but our personal paradise. All those
heart-to-heart talks about female mous
tache-hair and its pluses and minuses.
All reduced to a pool of worthless facts
and unpaid credit-card bills.
I cry soft, wet tears.
And I remember his gelled hair, crisp as
a rock, and his tight jeans, pegged with safe
ty pins at the ankles. And the way he
couldn't spell worth anything in his snivel
ing love notes. And the way he'd always try
to change lanes on the freeway without hit
ting the divider dots.
This pathetic excuse for a functioning
human has a real job. With a real salary.
Maybe I'll give in and marry him after
all.
