# Bug exposes his relative's feeding habits
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: Being that you are a "bug"yourself,
and with summer approaching, 1
wonder if you can explain how one
mosquito, in a large bedroom, at night
with the lights off, can manage to find
me? Someone says they must have some
sense of smell, but I do not believe that.

A: Although it does seem incredible
that a little tiny insect searching
through an enormous room in the dark
would be able to find its goal, you should
understand that the particular bugs to
which you refer have the most compelling
reason in the world to locate their tar
gets:
They want you for sexual purposes.
And if that sounds a little kinky, get
ready for another one: Among
mosquitoes, it's the females who stick it
in.
Into you, that is. The major food
sources for the adults of most species of

mosquito are the sugary saps and nec
tars of various plants; the males con
sume nothing else. Females, however,
whose reproductive responsibilities
include the production of many hun
dreds of well-stocked eggs, need dietary
supplements — and as most of us know
all too well, we're not talking about pick
les and ice cream.
When her biological clock begins to
tick, a female mosquito is faced with a
dilemma: relative to the number of prey
animals in her neck of the woods (say,
Wilbur Field), the amount of basically
empty space is vast. Also, her brain is too
simple to support complex visual tasks
like discerning (say) a sorority girl from
(for instance) a post or stump — hey, like
I said, complex. Thus, she must rely on
other cues to guide her to her victims.
There is a great deal of evidence
regarding how mosquitoes might locate
prey, but almost none explains how they
definitely do. The most convincing
results of modern entomology, however,
suggest that a major component of host
recognition by mosquitoes is — despite
what this week's questioner refuses to

believe — a sense of smell.
I waffled at the end of the last para
graph because the sense I'm referring to
is not, like our olfactory sense, able to
identify all sorts of scents, from floral to
flatulent. Rather, the female mosquito is
able to detect airborne concentrations of
a single type of molecule — namely, car
bon dioxide, a by-product of animal res
piration.
The mosquito's prey animals generate
plumes of carbon dioxide-laden air.
When a blood-hungry female flies across
the boundary of such a plume, she
detects it, crosses it, and turns around to
repeat the process. This zig-zagging con
tinues until she bumps into something
warm and soft, or until another cue
guides her more directly to her quarry's
locale.
Mosquitoes will home in on blocks of
dry ice, which is further evidence for car
bon dioxide's attractive powers. This
suggests a creative way to rid your picnic
of unwanted bloodsuckers (of the winged
type; I can't help you with the Bursar):
simply place a chunk of dry ice close
enough that it will draw off those

mosquitoes that may bite you.
A lower-tech solution
might be to build a small fire
(for those of you who opted
out of chemistry, the fire con
sumes oxygen and produces
carbon dioxide) to divert

unwanted mosquitoes.
Temperature and humidity gradients
are also significant to mosquitoes: Just
like high local carbon dioxide concentra
tions, they are produced by prey animals
and are not easily concealed. Mosquitos'
ability to detect these clues is not as fine
ly honed as their talent for sensing car
bon dioxide, but it is important at short
ranges, and is key to the female's final
descent on her way to the act of penetra
tion.
Simple visual clues — moving bound
aries between highly contrasting bright
and dark regions — may also assist the
mosquito in her hunt, even at night.
Nocturnally feeding mosquitoes are sen
sitive to changes in light levels about
one-fourth as intense as normal
starlight; this means that even when you
can't see her, she can see you.

Before thrusting her labium (I swear,
that's what it's called) beneath the skin
of her unsuspecting prey, she probes the
surface on which she has landed for as
long as thirty seconds. Although female
mosquitoes will occasionally suck blood
through cool, dry artificial membranes,
moderate lactate concentrations in
saline solutions on the membrane sur
face (lactate is, among other things, a
component of sweat) and normal body
heat greatly stimulate feeding behavior.
Hmm . . . nighttime, sweat and body
heat. Under those conditions, she might
not be the only one engaging in a little
penetration.
