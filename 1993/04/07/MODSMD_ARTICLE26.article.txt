## Moos earns respect as key passer for the Cardinal 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Passing.
It's one of the most overlooked
skills in volleyball. It doesn't have
the adrenaline rush of a hammer-like
kill, or the thrill of a diving save. But
a team without a talented passer is
like a car without an ignition. It just
won't run.
"It's the most important skill in
volleyball," said men's volleyball
coach Ruben Nieves. "It makes every
thing go."
Senior Ryan Moos agrees with
Nieves, as might be expected. Moos is
the strongest passer on the team, and
among the strongest in the nation.
In deference to that fact, in last
Friday's match against the Cardinal,
Loyola Maymount served only five
times to Moos, as opposed to 100
serves to Moos' counterpart, Bob
Hillman.
"[Passing] stabilizes the offense,"
Moos said. "When you have really
good middle blockers and you pass
the ball to the spot, 95 percent of the
time the ball is terminated."
There is no volleyball statistic
devoted to passing. Partly because of
this omission, the talented passers
get little of the glory reserved for the
explosive hitters or imposing block
ers. Still, Moos is satisfied with his
integral role on the team.
"The casual observer of volleyball
doesn't appreciate passing because
it's a lot more fun to watch somebody
hammer the ball," said Moos, "[but]
the best feeling for me is when I pass
a perfect ball and it is terminated by
the middle."
Moos has been surrounded by vol
leyball all his life, even before he
could appreciate it. Marv Dumphy
[the U.S. Olympic coach in '88] is a
close friend of the Moos family, and
paid unexpected visits around Christ
mastime.
"When I was a kid, Marv Dumphy
was Santa Claus for me," Moos said.
"Gary Sato, who was his assistant
coach on the National Team, was his
little elf helper."
But basketball was Moos' first
sport. He played volleyball on the side
until 10th grade, when he just got
tired of basketball.
"By that time I had been to so
many basketball camps and heard so
much about basketball that I was
beginning to anticipate and know

everything the coaches were saying,"
Moos said. "It was 'No, not this
again.' "
So he decided to devote 100 per
cent of his time to volleyball. All that
summer he played on the beach with
Chris Marlowe and Linda Chisim,
two former pros. These two gave
Moos the"in" he needed to play regu
larly in the cliquey beach volleyball
world.
Improving steadily, Moos received
his first recruiting letter the summer
of his junior year. He then realized
volleyball could become a vehicle for a
more important goal — going to col
lege.
"The best thing about playing a
sport is that you could go to college
and get a free education," Moos said.
"If it could get me that much and
nothing else, I'd be totally happy that
I played the sport."
According to Moos, he matriculat
ed at Stanford with "the best men's
volleyball recruiting year ever, for
any college."
With limited playing time, he was
able to go to the Final Four with such
Stanford stars as Dan Hannan and
Scott Fortune.
Moos has been used both as a
starter and a substitute in his career
at Stanford.
This year he now competes with
Hillman and Mike Lambert for the
two swing hitter positions on a game
by-game basis.
Some games he finds himself sit
ting behind freshman Lambert.
Rather than pouting, though, he
looks at what is best for the team and
realizes his value off the bench.
"Sometimes it's difficult to sepa
rate your individual feelings from
what's best for the team," Moos said,
"but it depends on what you need at
that time. . . it's good to have a ham
mer like Mike Lambert out there or
someone who hits well in adversity
like Bob Hillman.
"It's almost like I'm the perfect
sub. . . The two players on the court
know that if the passing starts to fal
ter. . . I can come in and stabilize [the
team]."
After this season, Moos' future in
volleyball is uncertain. His next goal
is World University Games, then the
National "B" Team.
Once on the "B" Team, he hopes to
be able to join his friend and former
teammate Duncan Blackman on the
"A" Team.

"I know the National Team is
watching his progress," Nieves said.
"There are a couple ways Ryan could
make the National Team. . . One way
is just with his passing. . . The other
is for him to raise the rest of his play
to the international level."
As athletes become more skilled at
a certain sport, it becomes harder and
harder to reach the next level. One
personality trait of Moos' that has
helped him attain his present skill
level, and should help him progress
further, is his concentration and
intensity.
"Ryan is an intense person,"
Nieves said "He gets quality time
from the things he decides to pursue,
whether it is volleyball. . . or his
study of Japan."
It is impossible to talk about Moos
without discussing his interest in
Japan.
A double-major in Economics and
East Asian Studies, Moos took his
first trip to Japan at age 13. He's
been back many times since then, and
spent a year at the Stanford Kyoto
center, where he practiced volleyball
with Suntory, a Japanese corporate
team.
"It was a great experience, in
terms of seeing how a Japanese team
operates," Moos said. "There is a
pecking order, but also a strong feel
ing of togetherness."
"He had to take long train rides to
get his practice in with a very high
level team," Nieves said. "He came
back a better player."
Moos' father was the catalyst
behind the preseason trip the Stan
ford volleyball team took to Japan
over Christmas break, where they
played and lost to both Suntory and
Tokai University.
"I thought it was great getting our
butts kicked," Moos said, "because it
reduced a lot of our confidence and
made us work harder."
Excelling at a skill which does not
get as much respect as it deserves
from the average volleyball fan, Moos
said the respect the Japanese give one
another is his favorite aspect of their
culture.
"They treat other individuals the
way people should be treated," he
said. "They care about your own
space and your feelings."
As the match against LMU seems
to indicate, opponents are starting to
give Moos some respect and space of
his own.

be able to join his friend and former
teammate Duncan Blackman on the
"A" Team.

"I know the National Team is
watching his progress," Nieves said.
"There are a couple ways Ryan could
make the National Team. . . One way
is just with his passing. . . The other
is for him to raise the rest of his play
to the international level."
As athletes become more skilled at
a certain sport, it becomes harder and
harder to reach the next level. One
personality trait of Moos' that has
helped him attain his present skill
level, and should help him progress
further, is his concentration and
intensity.
"Ryan is an intense person,"
Nieves said "He gets quality time
from the things he decides to pursue,
whether it is volleyball. . . or his
study of Japan."
It is impossible to talk about Moos
without discussing his interest in
Japan.
A double-major in Economics and
East Asian Studies, Moos took his
first trip to Japan at age 13. He's
been back many times since then, and
spent a year at the Stanford Kyoto
center, where he practiced volleyball
with Suntory, a Japanese corporate
team.
"It was a great experience, in
terms of seeing how a Japanese team
operates," Moos said. "There is a
pecking order, but also a strong feel
ing of togetherness."
"He had to take long train rides to
get his practice in with a very high
level team," Nieves said. "He came
back a better player."
Moos' father was the catalyst
behind the preseason trip the Stan
ford volleyball team took to Japan
over Christmas break, where they
played and lost to both Suntory and
Tokai University.
"I thought it was great getting our
butts kicked," Moos said, "because it
reduced a lot of our confidence and
made us work harder."
Excelling at a skill which does not
get as much respect as it deserves
from the average volleyball fan, Moos
said the respect the Japanese give one
another is his favorite aspect of their
culture.
"They treat other individuals the
way people should be treated," he
said. "They care about your own
space and your feelings."
As the match against LMU seems
to indicate, opponents are starting to
give Moos some respect and space of
his own.

Ryan Moos steps in at swing hitter for the Stanford men's volleyball team and delivers
a strong passing game for the No. 2-ranked Cardinal.
Passing.
It's one of the most overlooked
skills in volleyball. It doesn't have
the adrenaline rush of a hammer-like
kill, or the thrill of a diving save. But
a team without a talented passer is
like a car without an ignition. It just
won't run.
"It's the most important skill in
volleyball," said men's volleyball
coach Ruben Nieves. "It makes every
thing go."
Senior Ryan Moos agrees with
Nieves, as might be expected. Moos is
the strongest passer on the team, and
among the strongest in the nation.
In deference to that fact, in last
Friday's match against the Cardinal,
Loyola Maymount served only five
times to Moos, as opposed to 100
serves to Moos' counterpart, Bob
Hillman.
"[Passing] stabilizes the offense,"
Moos said. "When you have really
good middle blockers and you pass
the ball to the spot, 95 percent of the
time the ball is terminated."
There is no volleyball statistic
devoted to passing. Partly because of
this omission, the talented passers
get little of the glory reserved for the
explosive hitters or imposing block
ers. Still, Moos is satisfied with his
integral role on the team.
"The casual observer of volleyball
doesn't appreciate passing because
it's a lot more fun to watch somebody
hammer the ball," said Moos, "[but]
the best feeling for me is when I pass
a perfect ball and it is terminated by
the middle."
Moos has been surrounded by vol
leyball all his life, even before he
could appreciate it. Marv Dumphy
[the U.S. Olympic coach in '88] is a
close friend of the Moos family, and
paid unexpected visits around Christ
mastime.
"When I was a kid, Marv Dumphy
was Santa Claus for me," Moos said.
"Gary Sato, who was his assistant
coach on the National Team, was his
little elf helper."
But basketball was Moos' first
sport. He played volleyball on the side
until 10th grade, when he just got
tired of basketball.
"By that time I had been to so
many basketball camps and heard so
much about basketball that I was
beginning to anticipate and know

everything the coaches were saying,"
Moos said. "It was 'No, not this
again.' "
So he decided to devote 100 per
cent of his time to volleyball. All that
summer he played on the beach with
Chris Marlowe and Linda Chisim,
two former pros. These two gave
Moos the"in" he needed to play regu
larly in the cliquey beach volleyball
world.
Improving steadily, Moos received
his first recruiting letter the summer
of his junior year. He then realized
volleyball could become a vehicle for a
more important goal — going to col
lege.
"The best thing about playing a
sport is that you could go to college
and get a free education," Moos said.
"If it could get me that much and
nothing else, I'd be totally happy that
I played the sport."
According to Moos, he matriculat
ed at Stanford with "the best men's
volleyball recruiting year ever, for
any college."
With limited playing time, he was
able to go to the Final Four with such
Stanford stars as Dan Hannan and
Scott Fortune.
Moos has been used both as a
starter and a substitute in his career
at Stanford.
This year he now competes with
Hillman and Mike Lambert for the
two swing hitter positions on a game
by-game basis.
Some games he finds himself sit
ting behind freshman Lambert.
Rather than pouting, though, he
looks at what is best for the team and
realizes his value off the bench.
"Sometimes it's difficult to sepa
rate your individual feelings from
what's best for the team," Moos said,
"but it depends on what you need at
that time. . . it's good to have a ham
mer like Mike Lambert out there or
someone who hits well in adversity
like Bob Hillman.
"It's almost like I'm the perfect
sub. . . The two players on the court
know that if the passing starts to fal
ter. . . I can come in and stabilize [the
team]."
After this season, Moos' future in
volleyball is uncertain. His next goal
is World University Games, then the
National "B" Team.
Once on the "B" Team, he hopes to
be able to join his friend and former
teammate Duncan Blackman on the
"A" Team.

"I know the National Team is
watching his progress," Nieves said.

is just with his passing. . . The other
