# Lacrosse, crew, golf: non-national pastimes worth watching
## 
### 
Ah, SPRING, WHEN a young
man's fancy turns to . . . Schya,
right. At Stanford. As if.
Ah, spring, when a young man's fancy
turns to — lacrosse.
Actually, I've never even watched a col
legiate lacrosse game (match? rugger?). In
fact, come to think of it, with the exception
of baseball, spring sports at Stanford
resemble the late-night edition of ESPN.
Come on, don't deny it. You know you've
stayed up 'til 3 a.m. some nights watching
cricket — just to find out how the hell they
play that game. Hey, how about that as a
new slogan for Stanford spring sports ...
"Stanford's Spring Sports — Find Out
How the Hell They Play That Game."
OK, maybe not.
Nevertheless, athletics at Stanford are
no less exciting and intense in these warm
months of spring. Sure, you might have
been to Sunken Diamond once or twice, but
take a trip to the Stanford Tennis Stadium

for a change. Yesterday, I watched Stan
ford's No. 1 men's doubles team of Chris
Cocotos and Michael Flanagan squeak out
the oh-so-narrow 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (8-6) win
over their Fresno State counterparts to seal
the victory over the Bulldogs. The crowd
was yelling on every point, and, of more
entertainment value, Flanagan yelled at
himself on every miss. Hey, who needs
McEnroe?
How about the women, who are the No.
1 team in the nation and own eight of the

last 11 NCAA Titles? No. 1 Laxmi Poruri
has beaten Monica Seles and Arantxa
Sanchez, and rumor has it that Graf is
scared to play her. This year, you can watch
three of the country's top-10 collegiate
players in action, and you can get a tan at
the same time.
Men's volleyball is 15-3 and No. 2 in the
nation. And they're bald, which should be
reason enough to go see them. Make
Maples Pavilion rock again, like it did for
the 1992 national-champion Stanford
women's volleyball team. Count Goss' kills.
Keep track of Hribar's blocks. This is a fun
sport to watch, and Rob Ross needs some
one to read his articles. I'm kidding of
course.
Men's and women's crew is also a must
see for every Stanford student. I had the
honor of covering the crewpeople last year,
and took a drive out to scenic Redwood
Shores to watch them get drowned by Cal.
But go out anyway. Enjoy. Watch from the

bridge. Dare the women's varsity eight to
bench press you. They can.
Women's golf is currently in the hunt
for a national championship, and if you're
not good enough to play the Stanford
course, get out there and watch people who
are. Nail down that golf clap you've been
working so hard to perfect. Have a chili dog
at the ninth-hole snack shack. I especially
love mud-womping in the golf carts on the
14, but that's just me.
And, of course, there are those sports
you have to watch for a while to figure out
how they're played. I've seen a couple of
professional women's lacrosse matches,
and I think I've finally found a sport more
brutal than hockey. Women dressed in foot
ball pads run around a semi-grassy field
whipping a rock around and pummeling
each other with sticks. Bleeding is encour
aged. This might be my favorite sport.
Rugby is a little less lethal, but just as
intense — and they use an overinflated foot

ball. It's like basketball, football and soccer
rolled up in one, and if you play they give
you this cool-looking jersey you can wear to
class to look sharp. Bleeding allowed — but
unlike lacrosse, play stops if you lose a limb.
OK, so maybe some of these sports
aren't really fan-tastic. But at least I can
say, hey, I've been to a cre.v meet. At a
school where virtually every sport wins a
national championship or comes close, you
don't have an excuse not to see something
besides football, basketball or baseball.
Spring sports are high-performance sports
with low attendance, and folks, they don't
deserve it. Besides, then you'd start reading
my women's tennis articles.
I'm kidding of course.

Mike McDonough is actively lobbying the
athletic department for more spring varsity
sports, including bodybuilding, WWF
wrestling, auto racing and chess. He wel
comes your suggestions.
