# Men's tennis staves off scare from 'Dogs
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
It's been a long time since the
Cardinal men's tennis team has
played a five-hour match. But
yesterday, a quietly competent
Fresno State team had Stanford
coaches sweating and the No. 5-
ranked players fighting for every
point.
In the end, after five hours and
10 minutes, the Cardinal squad
prevailed, 6-3. "This is the first
time we've gone to doubles all
year," said junior Michael Flana
gan. "For the freshmen it was a
good taste of what Athens (and
the NCAA Championship) is like.
We need to experience this kind
of pressure before we get to the
real thing."
Head coach Dick Gould had
similar sentiments. "[Fresno
Statel played well against us," he
said. "When the match was on
the line, our guys sucked it up
enough to win it. In Athens every
one will be like this."
At the top of the lineup, No. 7
Michael Flanagan barely beat No.
84 Nils Koitka, 6-4, 7-6. With a
quick 5-1 lead in the first set,
Flanagan thought he had the

match in his pocket.
"I thought, Thank goodness!
I'm finally playing someone
who's having a bad day,' " he
said. "Then all of a sudden, he
came alive." Flanagan's lead
quickly deteriorated as Koitka
won eight of the next 11 games,
taking a 5-2 lead in the second
set.
In the tiebreaker, Flanagan
was cruising to victory with a 4-0
lead when Koitka made one last
stand, winning five points before
Flanagan closed out the match 7-
5.
At second singles, No. 95
Vimal Patel had a similar close
encounter with Steve Jackson
before pulling out a 6-2, 7-6 win.
No. 18 Robert Devens, who usu
ally plays in the second slot, sat
out so coach Gould could play
other team members in the bot
tom half of the lineup.
Chris Cocotos, at No. 3, fell
quickly to Bryan Juinio 6-3, 6-4
but Jeff Sakenstein breezed to a
6-2, 6-4 win over Andy Stewart.
At the fifth slot, Billy Wright was
off to a strong start, taking the
first set 6-3 but the Bulldogs'


Curtis Chen â€” Daily
Junior Michael Flanagan and the men's tennis team had their hands full against Fres
no State yesterday. No. 7 Flanagan managed to hold off No. 84 Nils Koitka, 6-4,7-6.
Blago Petrov woke up in the second
set and took control, winning the
match 3-6,6-3,6-1.
Cardinal freshman Jim Thomas,
coming off of a bad cold, was unable
to rally effectively against Peter Kli
novsky. He was defeated 6-2, 3-6, 6-
1.
Heading into doubles at 3-3, a
upset became a very real pos
sibility for the Bulldogs. Although
Patel and Devens easily won their
No. 2 doubles match 6-2, 6-1 over
Jackson and Petrov, the other two

matches were not going well for
Stanford.
After two quick breaks in the first
set, Flanagan and Cocotos, at No. 1,
were down 1-3 in the third set, while
Thomas and Salzenstein were down
0-1 in the second set after losing the
first.
As the sun set, the two matches
progressed, with the Bulldogs stub
bornly hanging on. At No. 3, the
Stanford freshmen were struggling
at 6-7, 5-4 and looking to enter a
third set.
At No. 1, Fresno State had three
match points at 6-5 in the third set
before Cocotos and Flanagan man
aged to tie it up at 6-6. In the
tiebreaker, the Bulldogs gave up a

match point at 6-4, in a vicious series
of eyeball-to-eyeball volleys.
The Cardinal tied the score at 6-6.
A slicing volley by Cocotos gave the
Cardinal a 7-6 lead and a flubbed
Bulldog lob gave Stanford the win, 4-
6, 7-5, 7-6.
"Koitka was incredible," Flana
gan said. "We were just trying to hit
to [Stewart]."
With the match clinched, the
Cardinal crew relaxed a bit and
watched the freshmen battle to a 6-
7, 6-4, 6-3 victory.
Despite the close call, Gould was
pleased with his team. "After last
week (losing to USC and UCLA) they
could have curled up a bit," he said.
"This (win) is a real credit to them."
