# Men's tennis staves off scare from 'Dogs

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
It's been a long time since the
Cardinal men's tennis team has
played a five-hour match. But
yesterday, a quietly competent
Fresno State team had Stanford
coaches sweating and the No. 5-
ranked players fighting for every
point.
In the end, after five hours and
10 minutes, the Cardinal squad
prevailed, 6-3. "This is the first
time we've gone to doubles all
year," said junior Michael Flana
gan. "For the freshmen it was a
good taste of what Athens (and
the NCAA Championship) is like.
We need to experience this kind
of pressure before we get to the
real thing."
Head coach Dick Gould had
similar sentiments. "[Fresno
Statel played well against us," he
said. "When the match was on
the line, our guys sucked it up
enough to win it. In Athens every
one will be like this."
At the top of the lineup, No. 7
Michael Flanagan barely beat No.
84 Nils Koitka, 6-4, 7-6. With a
quick 5-1 lead in the first set,
Flanagan thought he had the

match in his pocket.
"I thought, Thank goodness!
I'm finally playing someone
who's having a bad day,' " he
said. "Then all of a sudden, he
came alive." Flanagan's lead
quickly deteriorated as Koitka
won eight of the next 11 games,
taking a 5-2 lead in the second
set.
In the tiebreaker, Flanagan
was cruising to victory with a 4-0
lead when Koitka made one last
stand, winning five points before
Flanagan closed out the match 7-
5.
At second singles, No. 95
Vimal Patel had a similar close
encounter with Steve Jackson
before pulling out a 6-2, 7-6 win.
No. 18 Robert Devens, who usu
ally plays in the second slot, sat
out so coach Gould could play
other team members in the bot
tom half of the lineup.
Chris Cocotos, at No. 3, fell
quickly to Bryan Juinio 6-3, 6-4
but Jeff Sakenstein breezed to a
6-2, 6-4 win over Andy Stewart.
At the fifth slot, Billy Wright was
off to a strong start, taking the
first set 6-3 but the Bulldogs'
