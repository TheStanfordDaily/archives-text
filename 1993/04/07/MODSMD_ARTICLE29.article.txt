# Tennis primes for 'Big Match'
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
They don't call it the Big Match for nothing.
The women's tennis team will take its 19-1
record across the Bay today as it faces No. 4 Cal
ifornia (13-3, 2-2 in Pacific 10 Conference
South) in an 11 a.m. match in Berkeley.
Stanford narrowly edged the Golden Bears by
a 5-4 score on March 6 at Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, and California has beaten both No. 5 USC
and No. 13 UCLA since that match, becoming
one of the nation's top five collegiate women's
tennis teams.
"They've been doing very well this year," said
Stanford coach Frank Brennan. "They beat both
L.A. teams and they really want to beat us."
The Cardinal comes off a weekend sweep of
USC and UCLA, matches which Stanford took
by 7-0 and 8-0 scores, respectively.
Both wins came without the Cardinal's N0.3
singles and doubles player, redshirt freshman
Kim Shasby, the nation's No. 7 singles player.
Shasby is expected to be out for at least the rest
of this week, due to a strained muscle in her
foot.
"We had our lineup together for the first time
[against USC and UCLAI and it felt good," Bren
nan said. "It was a very pleasant surprise to do
so well and plow right through without Kim."
The Golden Bears sport four singles players
ranked in the top-100, including No. 28 Lisa
Parks, No. 33 Jennifer Poulos,
No. 53 Pam Nelson and No. 82
Veena Prabhakar, and are look
ing to make a run at the NCAA
Championship this year.
On the other hand, Stanford
is the only school in the nation
with all six starting singles
players in the top-100 and three
in the top-10.
Laxmi Poruri is ranked No. 2
nationally, Heather Willens fol
lows at No. 4, Kim Shasby is
No. 7, Kristine Kurth is No. 38,

Beth Berris is No. 41 and Amy
Chiminello rounds out the
strong Stanford contingent at
No. 94.
Despite its successes in
recent matches, however, nei
ther the Cardinal nor Brennan
are taking California lightly.
"We're in a pretty good mind
set right now," Brennan said.
"We thought that the last
match against them might have
been a little fluky, so we're not
going in afraid.
"As long as we pay attention
and concentrate on our game,
we should be OK."
Stanford will likely start
junior Emma Woodhouse at the

No. 6 position to fill the gap left
by Shasby.
Woodhouse posted a 7-5, 6-3
win over USC's Carla Quares
ma and a 6-1, 6-3 win over
UCLA's Anicia Mendez last
weekend, and has played at the
sixth spot for the Cardinal since
its March 24 match against No.
2 Florida.
Berris will also put her unde
feated individual-match record
on the line against the Golden
Bears.
Berris survived a two-hour,
25 minute match against USC's
Melissa Hernando last week,
winning 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 to keep
her match win streak alive.
