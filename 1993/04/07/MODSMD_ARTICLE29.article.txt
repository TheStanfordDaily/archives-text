They don't call it the Big Match for nothing.
The women's tennis team will take its 19-1
record across the Bay today as it faces No. 4 Cal
ifornia (13-3, 2-2 in Pacific 10 Conference
South) in an 11 a.m. match in Berkeley.
Stanford narrowly edged the Golden Bears by
a 5-4 score on March 6 at Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, and California has beaten both No. 5 USC
and No. 13 UCLA since that match, becoming
one of the nation's top five collegiate women's
tennis teams.
"They've been doing very well this year," said
Stanford coach Frank Brennan. "They beat both
L.A. teams and they really want to beat us."
The Cardinal comes off a weekend sweep of
USC and UCLA, matches which Stanford took
by 7-0 and 8-0 scores, respectively.
Both wins came without the Cardinal's N0.3
singles and doubles player, redshirt freshman
Kim Shasby, the nation's No. 7 singles player.
Shasby is expected to be out for at least the rest
of this week, due to a strained muscle in her
foot.
"We had our lineup together for the first time
[against USC and UCLAI and it felt good," Bren
nan said. "It was a very pleasant surprise to do
so well and plow right through without Kim."
The Golden Bears sport four singles players
ranked in the top-100, including No. 28 Lisa
