# Mem Aud sound system now in sight

Although new speakers and amplifiers have
been installed in Memorial Auditorium, the
ASSU-funded sound system will not be fully
operational until $3,000 worth of additional
wiring is installed.
Dolby, the company that is donating the sig
nal processor for the sound system, is requiring

the ASSU to pay for the installation of the
equipment, said graduate senator Sanford
Dickert at last night's ASSU Senate meeting.
"They say that they want to make sure that
this is a first-class system," Dickert said.
"What we have to remember is that they are
still donating much of the equipment."
Once Dolby's requirements are met and the
signal processor is installed, the sound system
will be completely ready for operation. The

ASSU originally said the system would be
working by the end of last quarter.
The cost of the additional equipment will
preclude the purchase of another piece of the
sound system, an AC sequencer, which would
prevent someone from turning on all the am
plifiers at once.
Dickert requested that the senate appropri-
ate an extra $3,000 to buy the
sequencer, pointing out that it
would safeguard the system against
"people who aren't thinking."
Graduate senator Robert
Lodenkamper argued against the
proposal, saying that "the only
way to protect the equipment is to
keep clowns away from it."
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins responded by telling the
senate to "think of it as an insur
ance policy."
"I would be more than willing to
pay $3,000 so some bumblefuck
doesn't destroy the system," he said.
In the end, however, the sen
ate defeated the proposal, which
failed to amass the two-thirds
majority needed for passage.
No date was given for the final
completion of the sound system.
"I've spent the last week and a
half talking to Dolby about this,"
said Dickert.
Another issue brought up at
last night's meeting involved the
ASSU Nominations Committee

— the body that assigns students
to University committees.
Graduate senator Kevin Mur
dock proposed an amendment to
the ASSU Bylaws that would allow
the senate to fill vacancies in Uni
versity committees during the
school year, and would require all
candidates for ASSU offices to
apply to serve on those committees.
The first part of the amendment
passed easily. Murdock described
this segment of the amendment as
"a first step in reforming the nom
inations process."
However, the second portion
faced opposition and was finally
removed from the amendment.
Murdock argued that "some
thing people are not aware of when
they apply for ASSU office is the
opportunity to get on committees."
But graduate senator Brian
Flachs said, "There is no point to
forcing people to apply to [serve
on] committees — I think it
makes a mockery of the whole
application process."
Other business included a con
firmation of sophomore Barbara
Wang and senior Brian Hillger as
the new administrative and finan
cial managers, respectively.
