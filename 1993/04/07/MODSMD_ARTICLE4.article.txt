What do the creators of Hip-
Hop Night, the founder of Cowell
Student Health Center's anony
mous HIV testing program, and
the developers of a community ser
vice class have in common?
They're all recipients of 1992-1993
James W. Lyons Awards for Ser
vice.
Last month, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson presented the
semi-annual awards to under
graduates Becca Bracy, Isabel
Bourelle, Pat Dote, Chris Eisen
berg, Jim Haljun, Elson Liu,
Alexander Macalalad, James Men
doza, Myra Parker, Eva Silva,
Darcy Thompson and Andrew
Zurn.
Macalalad, a senior, was hon
ored for his role in establishing
Cowell's anonymous HIV testing
and counseling program. The stu
dent-focused, student-run pro
gram is one of the most popular in
Cowell's history.
Another senior, Mendoza, re
ceived the award for his efforts in
revitalizing Stanford's CPR and
first-aid programs.
Both Macalalad and Mendoza
were nominated by Carole Pertof
sky, director of Cowell's Health
Promotion Program.
"Both students really were
mavericks in terms of having a vi
sion of a program and commit
ting themselves to making that
vision a reality," Pertofsky said,

speaking of both students' "per
sonal dedication and integrity."
Bracy, Liu and Thompson were
given the Lyons award for their
work in creating the American
Studies 120 class, "Process and
Practice of Community Service."
The 12-18 student seminar is of
fered during fall quarter.
While the idea of a public service
seminar "has been in the works for
quite a while" the class is the first
of its kind, Liu said.
"The goal of the class is to exam
ine public service comprehensively
â€” practice, theories, problems . . .
and our own motivations," Liu
said.
The three seniors were nomi
nated by Communication Prof. Je
remy Cohen, Tim Stanton of the
Haas Center for Public Service and
Charles Junkerman of the Hu
manities Center.
Seniors Haljun and Dote were
honored "for the energy, ingenuity
and creativity that have allowed
them to set a new standard for mul
ticultural musical programming
on campus." They collaborated in
creating the successful Hip-Hop
Night program in the Coffee
House.
Eisenberg and Zurn received
the awards for their work on the
1992-93 Stanford Directory, which
increased its advertising revenues
by $20,000 last year. The publica
tion grossed $280,000 "for the ben
efit of all" on the Stanford campus.
