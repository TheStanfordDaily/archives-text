# Conduct policy draft released
## Community response awaited 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
The latest draft of the Univer
sity policy on sexual harassment
has been released to the public and
now awaits input from faculty,
staff and students before undergo
ing final revisions.
Compared to its more hefty
predecessors, the three-page
draft has been pared down to
the bare-bones policy and basic
procedures on sexual harass
ment.
In addition, changes have been
made to statements regarding
confidentiality, consensual rela
tionships and a new response net
work.
For the last two years, a work
group has been working on and re

drafting the policy, which is sup
posed to update the University's
existing sexual harassment policy,
written in 1978.
The policy's statements on con
fidentiality and consensual rela
tionships were given special atten
tion in the most recent revision,
said Barbara Butterfield, vice
president for faculty and staff ser
vices.
The confidentiality clause
The current draft's statement
on confidentiality is a departure
from the initial policy's stronger
stand, which prohibited the re
lease of a complainant's identity
to "the press, parents or others"
without the "individual's express
consent."
In the past, graduate women in
particular — who may be more
easily identified in certain depart
ments with a small number of
females — had emphasized the
need for a strong confidentiality
clause.
According to the updated pol
icy, every complaint, whether
formal or informal, must be a
claim made against a "specific,
named individual," and the com
plainant "must consent to being
identified to the subject of the
complaint."
Because the issue has been a
sensitive one, the work group was
"careful of the confidentiality
clause," Butterfield said.
Despite the victim self-identifi
cation clause, the newest draft
also leaves room for University
action in response to anonymous
reports of harassment — not
technically defined as complaints
because of the victim's unwilling
ness to identify him or herself.
The draft, published in today's
edition of Campus Report, states:
"Although every effort will be
made to honor a complainant's

request for confidentiality, there
may be cases where the individual
concludes that he/she does not
desire to make a complaint, but
the situation described nonethe
less requires University action."
Consensual relationships
Complying with the University
Cabinet's request, the work
group also hammered out some
ambiguities from previous drafts
about consensual relationships,
Butterfield said.
The current document states
that the University "has no for
mal policy prohibiting consensual
romantic and/or sexual relation
ships among faculty, staff or stu
dents," but warns of the potential
risks of such relationships.
Butterfield said there has been
"no great disparity" between
work group and cabinet members
about the issue. But the Universi
ty of Virginia's recent decision to
completely ban "consensual rela
tionships" — such as those
between students and professors
or employees who directly super
vise one another — is likely to
spark further discussion, Butter
field said.
A new response network
The policy in its current form,

if enacted, will establish a
response network consisting of
sexual harassment advisers, an
adviser/coordinator and a sexual
harassment panel.
Advisers will "act as resources
to individuals who have concerns
or complaints about sexual
harassment" and will be responsi
ble to the adviser/coordinator,
according to the policy.
The panel will act "as an
optional resource to school or
administrative officers responsi
ble to investigate complaints and
remedy situations where sexual
harassment is found," the policy
states.
Butterfield said the panel and
"network of harassment advi
sors" are smaller than the origi
nal drafts had proposed.
Nevertheless, these resources
will provide "new access points"
for students, faculty and staff to
make complaints or voice con
cerns, as well as "opportunities
for interested students, staff and
faculty to fill these roles."
The road to approval
The last three drafts included
more detailed guidelines on pro
cedure, training and referral
resources, as well as a set of rec
ommendations for implementa

tion, said Butterfield.
It was decided that this infor
mation would be separated from
the policy itself and later pub
lished in a training and referral
brochure, she said.
"There's a good summer's
worth of work for us in those
areas," Butterfield said. "We
decided not to try to publish [the
policy and supplemental informa
tion] all at once."
While the supplemental infor
mation will take longer to draft,
Vice Provost for Student
Resources Mary Edmonds, a
group member, re-emphasized
University President Gerhard
Casper's determination to finish
the actual policy by the end of the
academic year.
The policy will be open for
written comments until April 30.
Students' responses can be direct
ed to Edmonds; faculty and staff
can submit comments to Butter
field.
The work group will then
"digest the real content" of the
responses, and submit recom
mendations to Casper for any
revisions to the policy.
Butterfield added that she
believes Casper also will want to
discuss the policy with the Facul
ty Senate.
