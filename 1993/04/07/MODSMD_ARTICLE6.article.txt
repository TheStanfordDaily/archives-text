who had accepted the position as
director of the Black Community
Services Center on Friday, has de
cided not to come to Stanford be

James "definitely told me she
was going to accept the position. I

yesterday that the decision not to

With James no longer in the

with this person and we will do our

the position," he said.
English Prof. John Baugh,
chair of the search committee, ex
