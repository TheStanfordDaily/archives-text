# James backs out after accepting BCSC position
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Ohio educator Judith James,
who had accepted the position as
director of the Black Community
Services Center on Friday, has de
cided not to come to Stanford be
cause of personal difficulties,
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
said yesterday.
James "definitely told me she
was going to accept the position. I
was very certain of that," said
Jackson, a member of the search
committee. "I've been around for
17 years and I definitely know the
difference between yes and no."
Currently the executive direc
tor of the Teaching Leadership
Consortium in Ohio, James said
yesterday that the decision not to
come to Stanford "is very much
related to some personal family is

sues that preclude me from leav
ing. . . . That was not an easy deci
sion, but one I had to make."
With James no longer in the
picture, Jackson said he is negoti
ating with another of the finalists
for the position. "We have a terrif
ic other person who was being con
sidered, and I am in conversations
with this person and we will do our
best to see if he would like to take
the position," he said.
English Prof. John Baugh,
chair of the search committee, ex
plained that the list of names sub
mitted to Jackson was unranked.
"If he is able to close a deal with
another person on that list, we
will be happy," he added.
There are four finalists besides
James who visited campus. The
candidates are:
• Steven Birdine, director of
the Marcus Garvey Center at the
University of Northern Colorado;
• Czerny Brasuell, director of
the Development and Communi
ty Organization at the Christie
Institute South in North Caroli
na;
• John Ortiz-Hutsom, the stu
dent affairs officer responsible
for the Learning Skills Center at
UC-Davis; and
• Zizwe Poe, director of the
African (Black) Student Pro
grams at UC-Davis and chair of
the school's multicultural ethnic
relations committee.
Jackson said that if the candi
date he is currently negotiating
with also does not take the posi
tion, the committee may have to
start another search.
"I would get together with the
entire search committee and
examine the other candidates,"
he said. "If that doesn't work we
will start searching again."
Baugh agreed there was "a
possibility" of another search.
"Even if we do have to conduct
another search, it's not that bad

because we can still talk to some
people who haven't made com
mitments for next year," he
explained. "The members of our
committee felt it extremely
important to have a person in
that position who will serve Stan
ford's needs."
Baugh said that although he
had not talked to James since her
decision, he knew that "over the
weekend she was trying to make
arrangements with her ex-hus
band for shared custody of her
daughter. There were some prob
lems because he would not let
their daughter move to Califor
nia."
"We were very careful in the
course of the search to avoid per
sonal inquiries so I didn't even
know she had a daughter or an
ex-husband," Baugh continued.
"I just have the shock and disbe
lief that every one else who has
talked to her has."
Acting BCSC Director Barbara
Smith said she could not com
ment on the search, but that she
looked forward to the naming of a
new director. "It's been educa
tional, it's been enlightening," she
said. "I'm glad I had the opportu
nity to step in and help the com
munity, but I really enjoy my
assistant director duties, especial
ly working with students."
