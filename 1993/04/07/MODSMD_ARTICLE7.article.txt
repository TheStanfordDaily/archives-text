# Student volunteers help staff free clinic
## 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
Early Sunday morning, a
middle-aged white woman
walked into Palo Alto's Arbor
Free Clinic after three weeks of
coughing.
"I just waited for it to go
away because I didn't want to
pay for a doctor," she explained,
adding that she was from East
Palo Alto and "between jobs."
After being examined by a
volunteer doctor and Stanford

medical students clad in jeans,
she discovered she was suffer
ing from bronchitis and re
ceived prescription medication
for free.
Later, an African-American
man hurried into the clinic, con
cerned about his small daughter
waiting in the car, who he said
may have chicken pox. A med
ical student rushed out to the
car to see if he could diagnose
and treat her there.

Every Sunday morning, when
most students are just stum
bling to brunch, Stanford volun
teers bustle around the clinic,
located in the Palo Alto Red
Cross building, providing medi
cal care for patients who cannot
be treated through normal chan
nels.
The patients, most of whom
who do not have health insur
ance, walk directly into the clinic
— some directly off the streets
where they live.
The clinic was started almost
three years ago as a research pro
ject by Eric Stark, a Stanford
student in the School of
Medicine. It is the only free clin
ic in the country that is entirely
student run.
"When I was interviewing at
different medical schools, I
found that Stanford was one
without a student clinic, so I
wanted to start one," Stark said.
"But unlike the others, we are
the only free-standing clinic.
The students organize all of the
supplies, funding and account
' „ W
ing.
The clinic, which both pro
vides clinical experience for Stan
ford medical students and free
medical care to those without
insurance, is open to patients on
a first-come, first-served basis.
About half of its patients are
homeless, coming mostly from
East Palo Alto and Redwood
City.
When patients enter the clin
ic, they are first interviewed by a
pre-clinical student and later

examined by a clinical student. A
doctor is present to give a final
examination of the patient.
"Its a lot of teamwork," said
Tain-Yen Hsia, a second-year
medical student.

I've really learned that
there are two sides to
medicine, the straight
facts which I learn in
class and the doctor
patient interaction.'

Boxes of donated supplies —
toothbrushes, tampons, dispos
able thermometers, condoms
and even old eyeglasses — are
displayed on a table in the room
of the clinic that serves as the
main examining room. However,
donations do not come in regu
larly and sometimes the clinic
doesn't have what its patients
need.
But even small successes are
big victories.
Workers at the clinic celebrat
ed when a donated pair of eye
glasses matched the prescription
for a young child. The child had
been examined the week before,
but no glasses with the correct
lens strengths were available
then.
One of the clinic's purposes is
to provide small tools to help
keep patients healthy.
"Some patients come in and
just want some Tylenol or

Motrin. They don't have five
bucks for a bottle," said Sidney
Morris, a third-year medical stu
dent.
Undergraduates also volun
teer at the clinic. "Its really cool
because every once in a while you
get to follow a patient through
the examination," said sopho
more Vip Soni.
Soni recalled that the first
time he volunteered, a drug user
came into the clinic who was
worried about his leg. "He had
shot up so much in his leg that it
was really infected. The doctor
suggested that it might have to
be amputated, so the guy just ran
out of the clinic and hasn't come
back," Soni said.
But most patients come in
with less serious aliments.
"The most frequent problems
are colds as well as dental prob
lems. Dermatological problems
are common too, because home
less people don't have showers,"
said Brad Rubin, who graduated
from Stanford in 1991. "Some
times people just come by
because they want to sit down,
get some coffee or go to the bath
room."
Rubin has spent the past five
months volunteering at the clin
ic's check-in desk while he
applies to medical schools. "You
definitely get a sense of more
mainstream patients who don't
have health care," he said.
Unable to pay doctors' fees,
many patients come in merely to
get a free physical for a job appli
cation, added Stark.
"There's probably an average
of about 20 patients a day, but
the number of people depends on
the weather," said Rubin.
"About 60 to 70 percent of the

people who come in are new," he
said.
The clinic also refers patients
to other specialized free clinics
and hospitals in the area for ser
vices — like dental care — the
volunteers cannot provide.
Soni pointed out that working
at the clinic teaches students
important skills about relating to
patients.
"I've really learned that there
are two sides to medicine, the
straight facts which I learn in
class and the doctor-patient
interaction," Soni said. "Its great
to work here because I get to see
the interaction, and I get to
speak a little of my Spanish once
in a while too."
According to Stark, the clinic
is understaffed. "Its pretty
unlikely that we'd open for
more than just Sunday," Stark
said. "Its hard to come up with
enough man-power to open for
more than once a week," he
said.
Originally funded by the Com
munity Scholars Program at the
Medical School, the Arbor Free
Clinic is now supported by the
Peninsula Community Founda
tion. Stark said that one of his
dreams is to get the Stanford
Business School involved in the
clinic doing the "business end of
the deal."
Initially, the clinic was to be
run in a church on Arbor Street
in Menlo Park, which is where
its name originated. "But the
Menlo Park City Council
imposed a $1,000 permit on us
and wanted us to go through a
bunch of paper-work," said
Stark. "Basically, they didn't
want homeless people around
there."

of about 20 patients a day, but
the number of people depends on
the weather," said Rubin.
"About 60 to 70 percent of the

people who come in are new," he
said.
The clinic also refers patients
to other specialized free clinics
and hospitals in the area for ser
vices — like dental care — the
volunteers cannot provide.
Soni pointed out that working
at the clinic teaches students
important skills about relating to
patients.
"I've really learned that there
are two sides to medicine, the
straight facts which I learn in
class and the doctor-patient
interaction," Soni said. "Its great
to work here because I get to see
the interaction, and I get to
speak a little of my Spanish once
in a while too."
According to Stark, the clinic
is understaffed. "Its pretty
unlikely that we'd open for
more than just Sunday," Stark
said. "Its hard to come up with
enough man-power to open for
more than once a week," he
said.
Originally funded by the Com
munity Scholars Program at the
Medical School, the Arbor Free
Clinic is now supported by the
Peninsula Community Founda
tion. Stark said that one of his
dreams is to get the Stanford
Business School involved in the
clinic doing the "business end of
the deal."
Initially, the clinic was to be
run in a church on Arbor Street
in Menlo Park, which is where
its name originated. "But the
Menlo Park City Council
imposed a $1,000 permit on us
and wanted us to go through a
bunch of paper-work," said
Stark. "Basically, they didn't
want homeless people around
there."
Early Sunday morning, a
middle-aged white woman
walked into Palo Alto's Arbor
Free Clinic after three weeks of
coughing.
"I just waited for it to go
away because I didn't want to
pay for a doctor," she explained,
adding that she was from East
Palo Alto and "between jobs."
After being examined by a
volunteer doctor and Stanford

medical students clad in jeans,
she discovered she was suffer
ing from bronchitis and re
ceived prescription medication
for free.
Later, an African-American
man hurried into the clinic, con
cerned about his small daughter
waiting in the car, who he said
may have chicken pox. A med
ical student rushed out to the
car to see if he could diagnose
and treat her there.

Every Sunday morning, when
most students are just stum
bling to brunch, Stanford volun
teers bustle around the clinic,
located in the Palo Alto Red
Cross building, providing medi
cal care for patients who cannot
be treated through normal chan
nels.
The patients, most of whom
who do not have health insur
ance, walk directly into the clinic
— some directly off the streets
where they live.
The clinic was started almost
three years ago as a research pro
ject by Eric Stark, a Stanford
student in the School of
Medicine. It is the only free clin
ic in the country that is entirely
student run.
"When I was interviewing at
different medical schools, I
found that Stanford was one
without a student clinic, so I
wanted to start one," Stark said.
"But unlike the others, we are
the only free-standing clinic.
The students organize all of the
supplies, funding and account
' „ W
ing.
The clinic, which both pro
vides clinical experience for Stan
ford medical students and free
medical care to those without
insurance, is open to patients on
a first-come, first-served basis.
About half of its patients are
homeless, coming mostly from
East Palo Alto and Redwood
City.
When patients enter the clin
ic, they are first interviewed by a
pre-clinical student and later

examined by a clinical student. A
doctor is present to give a final
examination of the patient.
"Its a lot of teamwork," said
Tain-Yen Hsia, a second-year
medical student.

I've really learned that
there are two sides to
medicine, the straight
facts which I learn in
class and the doctor
patient interaction.'

Boxes of donated supplies —
toothbrushes, tampons, dispos
able thermometers, condoms
and even old eyeglasses — are
displayed on a table in the room
of the clinic that serves as the
main examining room. However,
donations do not come in regu
larly and sometimes the clinic
doesn't have what its patients
need.
But even small successes are
big victories.
Workers at the clinic celebrat
ed when a donated pair of eye
glasses matched the prescription
for a young child. The child had
been examined the week before,
but no glasses with the correct
lens strengths were available
then.
One of the clinic's purposes is
to provide small tools to help
keep patients healthy.
"Some patients come in and
just want some Tylenol or

Motrin. They don't have five
bucks for a bottle," said Sidney
Morris, a third-year medical stu
dent.
Undergraduates also volun
teer at the clinic. "Its really cool
because every once in a while you
get to follow a patient through
the examination," said sopho
more Vip Soni.
Soni recalled that the first
time he volunteered, a drug user
came into the clinic who was
worried about his leg. "He had
shot up so much in his leg that it
was really infected. The doctor
suggested that it might have to
be amputated, so the guy just ran
out of the clinic and hasn't come
back," Soni said.
But most patients come in
with less serious aliments.
"The most frequent problems
are colds as well as dental prob
lems. Dermatological problems
are common too, because home
less people don't have showers,"
said Brad Rubin, who graduated
from Stanford in 1991. "Some
times people just come by
because they want to sit down,
get some coffee or go to the bath
room."
Rubin has spent the past five
months volunteering at the clin
ic's check-in desk while he
applies to medical schools. "You
definitely get a sense of more
mainstream patients who don't
have health care," he said.
Unable to pay doctors' fees,
many patients come in merely to
get a free physical for a job appli
cation, added Stark.
"There's probably an average
of about 20 patients a day, but
the number of people depends on
the weather," said Rubin.
"About 60 to 70 percent of the

people who come in are new," he
said.
