# Student volunteers help staff free clinic

Early Sunday morning, a
middle-aged white woman
walked into Palo Alto's Arbor
Free Clinic after three weeks of
coughing.
"I just waited for it to go
away because I didn't want to
pay for a doctor," she explained,
adding that she was from East
Palo Alto and "between jobs."
After being examined by a
volunteer doctor and Stanford

medical students clad in jeans,
she discovered she was suffer
ing from bronchitis and re
ceived prescription medication
for free.
Later, an African-American
man hurried into the clinic, con
cerned about his small daughter
waiting in the car, who he said
may have chicken pox. A med
ical student rushed out to the
car to see if he could diagnose
and treat her there.
