SPRING IS IN THE AIR
The great California spring skies are wating for you. The Stanford Flying club can
teach you how to fly. Most students obtain their Solo License with only 10 to 20 hours
of flying time.
Stanford Flying Club Members can fly planes for less then 30 cents a mile! That's
less than the real cost of a car, including fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc. And could
you afford not to learn to drive?
We also offer aerobatics and high-performance aircrafts. Call today for details.
