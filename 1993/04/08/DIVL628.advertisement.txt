Dear Patron
Chef Chu's is proud to have provided
reliable, personal, and professional catering
service to its many satisfied customers for
over two decades. Whether you're planning a
wedding reception, cocktail party, an
Intimate sit-down dinner, or an office party —
whatever the occasion — let Chef Chu's
help to make your get-together a
memorable one.
When your group numbers 20 or more,
one phone call brings a Chef Chu banquet
direct from our kitchen to your table —
complete and ready to enjoy, for as little as
$10 a person. We'll deliver your personalized
banquet in aluminum trays, arrange the food
buffet style, even supply the paper plates,
napkins, and plastic utensils. You don't have
to do a thing. Your catering is In good hands.
Let Chef Chu be a part of your next
banquet. Throwing a party could be a lot
easier than you think. And a lot more
affordable than you ever imagined.
Chinese-style catering with distinction...
