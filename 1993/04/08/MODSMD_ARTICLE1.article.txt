# Resource center's future unsure
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
No one knows better than
Caroline Mitchell that the fu
ture of the Sexual Assault Re
source Center is anything but
certain.
Both Mitchell's position as
sexual assault prevention educa
tor and the center's survival
hinge on the passage of an ASSU
special fee request, sponsored by
the Coalition Against Sexual As
sault. Students will vote on the
fee request during the ASSU
general election next Wednes
day and Thursday.
The Coalition is requesting
$52,280 — an estimated $39,210
after students request fee re
funds — to fund Mitchell's posi
tion, the center and campus edu
cation, including activities such
as the orientation program "Sex
in the '90s" and self-defense
workshops.
While the threat of losing
funding is new to Mitchell, the
issue has dogged the center over
the past few years.
The center was established in
1991 when the ASSU Senate ap
proved $45,000 in funding for
sexual assault prevention and
education on campus.
The original bill — which
compensated for the Universi
ty's inability to fund recommen
dations of the Sexual Assault
Task Force— committed the
ASSU to funding the programs
for one year, after which the
University was expected to as
sume financial responsibility.
When budget difficulties pre
cluded the University from
funding the Sexual Assault Re
source Center and its coordina
tor, students last year voted for
a $49,000 special fee request, ef
fectively funding the position for
another year.
"The students have histori
cally been the ones to commit to
this issue," Mitchell said. "I see
my role as honoring the commit
ment students have shown on
this issue — a commitment that
has preceded the University's
both in terms of interest and in
funding."

Although the University later
decided to fund a half-time posi
tion, hiring Sexual Assault
Resource Center coordinator
Fran Gibson, her responsibilities
tend more toward research than
outreach.
According to Mitchell, Gib
son's budget is also much smaller
than Mitchell's. Without special
fee money, Gibson would be left

to do the work of both positions
with a shoe-string budget,
Mitchell said.
"Fran was essentially hired to
manage a program without
money," Mitchell said. "Without
the Coalition's fee request, there
really isn't a united effort towards
sexual assault prevention on cam
pus — just one half-time position
with minimal funding."

Though Mitchell's current
position is funded only through
the end of August, part of her job
is to plan next year's Orientation.
"We're so up in the air right
now," Mitchell said. "We just
have to take it on faith.
"I'm planning 'Sex in the '90s*
now just assuming that we'll get
the funding . . . that I'll be here
at all," she added.

Along with the orientation
program, Mitchell said the fee
would go to pay for what she and
Gibson called "positive program
ming."
"If you make people feel alien
ated and 'bashed' they're just
going to tune out," Mitchell said.
"We're trying to make our pro
grams as positive and construc
tive as possible."

Since her position and the
center are student funded,
Mitchell said she feels a strong
responsibility to address student
needs, which might not be
addressed after a funding cut.
"I see myself and my position
as trying to see that students are
represented," she said. "You
really need someone specifically
focused on student needs."
