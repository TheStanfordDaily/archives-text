Jackson not interested in heading NAACP
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Rev. Jesse Jackson, citing a move by
some NAACP board members to weaken the position of executive
director, said yesterday he is no longer interested in heading the civil
rights organization.
Jackson withdrew in a letter to NAACP board Chairman William
Gibson, dated yesterday. The withdrawal came two days before the
NAACP's full board is to vote on a successor to Benjamin Hooks, who
is to retire at the end of the month.
The five-page letter was received in the NAACP's Baltimore head
quarters, said spokesman Jim Williams.
" Even if my number one ranking is upheld by the full board of direc
tors, it would not be in the best interest of the NAACP membership for
me to continue to permit my name to be considered," Jackson wrote.
Jackson said he "had a chance to reflect'' on a proposed rule change
that would broaden the board's powers over day-to-day functions of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"The idea ... is a substantial shift from the current constitution,"
Jackson said. "A strong director — with meaningful powers and duties
— is essential to a strong NAACP.
