# Cuomo will not seek Court nomination
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Mario Cuomo, the
best-known candidate for the upcoming
Supreme Court vacancy, formally withdrew
yesterday from consideration before President
Clinton had narrowed his list of prospects.
In a letter to Clinton, Cuomo said he wanted
to remain as governor to help New York's eco
nomic recovery. He said staying in the political
world would allow him to "continue to serve as a
vigorous supporter of the good work you are
doing for America and the world."
Clinton refused earlier in the day to confirm
reports of the withdrawal, but said, "I think he's
terrific."
Cuomo's decision removes the only candidate
with celebrity quality from the long list of names
earning speculation in Washington. It would
appear to be an indication that Cuomo may run
for a fourth term as governor.
In the rampant speculation about the
Supreme Court opening, Cuomo had emerged as
the liberal wing's sentimental choice, though the
Clinton inner circle had never tipped its hand
about Cuomo's chances.

But the loss of a celebrity candidate in Cuomo
could rob Clinton of one of the qualities he is '
seeking in a nominee. Another White House offi
cial familiar with the search process said Clinton
wanted "someone who will make people say
'Wow,' whether they agree with the person or
not."
Clinton has said only that he wants a justice
who will respect the right to privacy, an argu
ment that is the underpinning for a woman's
right to an abortion. Clinton said he would not
directly ask any potential nominee his or her
position on abortion.
Aides said Clinton is at least a month away
from making his choice. There is no hurry, since
Justice Byron White will not retire until the end
of the court's term, usually late June or July.
Cuomo's decision, which Newsday said was
forwarded to Clinton last Thursday, was
unknown to some of Clinton's closest advisers
until now. That is an indication of how hard the
president is working to avoid leaks that plagued
some of his Cabinet selections.
Cuomo, 60, has sent mixed signals on whether

he would want to be on the Supreme Court. In a
recent interview, he compared the position to
both "heaven" and being "entombed." He has
been governor of New York for the past 10 years.
In the letter, Cuomo wrote, "I do not know
whether you might have nominated me but
because there has been public speculation con
cerning the possibility, I think I owe it to you to
make clear now that I do not wish to be consid
ered."
Cuomo, often referred to as Hamlet on the
Hudson, kept people guessing through much of
the early stages of both the 1988 and the 1992
presidential campaigns about whether he would
run or not. He eventually begged off both those
races.
Among the remaining candidates being men
tioned by administration officials are Judge
Judith Kaye, chief judge of New York's highest
state court; Judge Patricia Wald, who sits on the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington and Judge
Richard Arnold of Little Rock, who sits on the
Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and is an
old friend of Clinton.
