## Moving to a new Haas 
### 
Completed Haas Center
shows Stanford's strong
support of public service

NOW THERE IS a bigger and
better reason to go into the
Haas Center for Public Ser
vice — literally. Every Stanford stu
dent should visit the new building,
not only to inspect its architecture
but to partake in the many public
service organizations that are now
housed there.
The Haas Center recently moved
into a new building which is almost
three times the size of its former
home in Owen House. In its new
incarnation, almost three times as
many student organizations will
work out of the center, bringing the
total to almost 40 groups.
Although $2 million for its con
struction may seem expensive, it
was well worth the investment. In
addition to the added space, the
new center is wheelchair-accesible,
unlike Owen House, allowing every
student to take part in Haas' orga
nizations.
Now, more students can make
use of the Stanford in Government,
Haas Center Public Service Oppor
tunities Clearinghouse, Raven
swood Stanford Tutoring Program,
Stanford Project on Nutrition and
other public-service organizations.
In the old center, each office had
two or more staff members or stu
dent organizations working out of it
— and not even every student orga
nization had a desk. Some organi
zations just used the Haas Center
as a central meeting point to receive
phone messages and mail — and for
lack of space were forced to meet
other places.
Alpha Phi Omega, a coeducation
al service fraternity, worked out of
the Toyon Eating Clubs, but now
has a space in the new Haas Center.
Moving to the new center puts this
organization closer to other public
service groups and other students
interested in volunteering.

Stanford in Government, a stu
dent organization dedicated to
funding government fellowships
and acting as a clearinghouse for
government internships, had an
office in Owen, but now has an
even bigger office so students can
look through SIG resources more
easily.
Not only will Stanford students
benefit from the new building, the
communities which Haas Center
sponsored activities impact will also
benefit. The tutoring programs
based in the Haas Center are now
all housed in the same building so
they can share resources. The
added space also allows tutors to
read through library books and bet
ter prepare for their tutoring ses
sions.
The lack of meeting space in the
old Haas Center caused difficulty
because it required meetings and
seminars to be held in the Humani
ties Annex, Mariposa House or
other buildings on campus. In the
new Haas Center, there are two
small conference rooms and the
Donald Kennedy seminar room.
Some Haas Center employees,
like Clearinghouse Coordinator
Sue Gray, did not have offices in the
old building and sometimes had to
use the library, borrow someone
else's office or find a room in the
nearby law school to work.
Even the construction firm who
built the new building got into the
spirit of public service by donating
all of the appliances for the kitchen
in the new building.
With all the facilities available
for public-service groups now, stu
dents must do their part to make
sure the organizations have enough
volunteers to fulfill their missions.
There are so many different organi
zations for which a student can vol
unteer that everyone can find
something that interests them at
the public-service center.
The Haas Center has invested in
a building to make public-service
opportunities more accessible to
Stanford students — now it's the
students turn to take them up on
the offer.
