Hernandez's cartoon offends Jews by reviving incorrect myth

WE WERE disgusted and appalled
by Rick Hernandez's "Where
Random's Come To Die" cartoon
which appeared in The Daily April 6.
Besides lacking the requisite humor of a
typical comic strip, the cartoon served
only to reinforce the stereotype of the
Jewish people as bringing on the death of
Jesus, and can only serve to perpetuate
anti-semitic sentiment. At this time of
religious celebration for both Jews and
Christians alike, such blatant disregard
for not only the Stanford Jewish commu
nity, but for the Jewish faith as a whole,
should not and cannot be dismissed.
While racial and ethnic stereotypes
have been commonplace in past Daily fun

nies, Hernandez's attempted jibe over
looks the painful images of Eastern Euro
pean Jews, fleeing attackers chanting,
"Kill the Jesus killers!" Perhaps Hernan
dez, like many individuals, is unaware of
the complex emotions his attempted satire
evokes. But then again, he must have
found some inkling of humor in what was
to us, if not subtle anti-semitism, an
avenue through which anti-semites may
garner strength. Furthermore, and per
haps more convincing than any words we
might write, are the Vatican II documents
issued by the Vatican council in 1965.
Such a voluminous paper would be diffi
cult to broach in such a short letter. Suf
fice it to say that within the papers are

contained Pope John XXIII's own words
absolving the Jewish people as a whole of
deicide. We accompany this brief explana
tion with the strong recommendation that
Hernandez familiarize himself with these
documents at some point.
Whether Hernandez' derogatory inter
pretation of the meaning of the Jewish
celebration of Passover was deliberate or
not, it nevertheless serves to remind us of
the upsetting, even fatal, stereotypes of
the Jewish people in the past. As any
minority group member will admit, it only
takes a moment to lose the respect and
acceptance one has had to fight for all his
life. As the Passover Hagadah says, "Were
it not for the suffering of our ancestors,

we would not be free today." Passover
represents freedom; freedom from slav
ery, freedom to worship as one pleases,
and freedom to be who one wants, with
out fear of persecution. How appropriate,
then, that we write this letter this
Passover â€” if not for ourselves, then for
our ancestors.
In this culturally diverse, world-class
institution of learning and truth seeking,
Hernandez's piece, more so than convey
ing humor, is a disservice to people of
good faith of all religions.
