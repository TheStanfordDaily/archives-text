# Cartoon depicts Jews unfairly and helps to reinforce stereotypes
## 
### 
Is Rick Hernandez living in the Mid
dle Ages?
His April 6 cartoon portrayed a
Catholic, Protestant and a Jew sitting
peaceably at a Seder table, until the Jew
boasted that the Seder is "the last meal
your God ate before we told on him and
got him killed." The cartoon, for rea
sons Hernandez apparently missed,
caused us great pain on the eve of our
Second Seder. During our Passover holi
day, in which we celebrate the ideals of
freedom, human rights and hospitality
toward strangers, Hernandez has
(unknowingly?) resuscitated one of the
classic medieval lies used to incite the
slaughter of the Jews — namely, that
the Jews had "gotten Jesus killed." In
an age when even the Vatican has pro
claimed that this accusation was base
less and had caused the murder of an
untold number of Jews (see Vatican II),
Hernandez and The Daily editors

should be embarrassed.
