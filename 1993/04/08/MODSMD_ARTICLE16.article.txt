# Grade inflation is not the problem; Stanford should abolish grades
## 
### 
In response to your April 6 editorial
regarding grade inflation at Stanford,
I have an alternate suggestion: abolish
grades altogether and make all classes
pass/fail.
Here's why I think this would be a
good idea:
The editorial states, "Students
should be concerned with 'grade creep*
. . . after all, if 4,000 students with
4.0s apply for a job, ulterior character
istics will come into play." Wonderful!
Shouldn't that be exactly what we
want? I have known enough extraordi
nary people during my years at Stan
ford to hope that their ulterior charac

teristics help them to achieve great
ness once they leave here. Your dis
missive term, "ulterior characteris
tics," encompasses everything I appre
ciate most about the people I have
known here — their passion, their
leadership, their humor — all qualities
which may or may not be correlated
with G.P.A.
Also, "with A's so easy to earn, a
particular student's strengths are easy
to overlook." This is true, if a particu
lar student's only strength is getting
A's. My point is that anybody who
really wants a particular job should
concentrate on demonstrating their
strengths in ways that transcend sim
ply getting A's in all of their core
classes. If a student is interested in a
career in science, for instance, that
student might undertake an indepen
dent research project, read an unas
signed book, visit one of the many dis
tinguished scientists present on this
campus and talk with them about
their careers, write a letter to a leader
in the field that interests them (would
be chemists, do you really think any
one is going to give a damn about your
grades if you present them with a let
ter of recommendation from Linus

Pauling? Don't write to him though,
he's busy, and he doesn't have too
much time left, Vitamin C notwith
standing) — the possibilities are end
less.
I dare to speculate that if grades
were abolished altogether, students
here would be compelled to do more
than just coast through their under
graduate careers, secure in the knowl
edge that a high G.P.A. will take them
wherever they want to go. A high
G.P.A. alone will not get anyone far.
Furthermore, students who really
care about their classes would contin
ue to perform just as well, because
they would be taking those classes out
of a deep love for their subject, and not
because their eyes were focussed on
getting into the professional school of
their choice.
With this in mind, I wish all of you
on the Daily's editorial board an excel
lent spring quarter, and I hope you all
receive good grades in 10-weeks' time.
Grades that you can be proud of,
because you worked for them, and not
simply because they're better than
other peoples'.
