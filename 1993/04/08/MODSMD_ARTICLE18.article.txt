## The 						Daily needs some help 
### 
THE DAILY SHOULD be ashamed
of itself. On Monday, The Daily
brought us "Night & Day in EPA:
Hope & despair live side-by-side in Stan
ford's not-so-distant neighbor." If there
was an award for the most irresponsible
and ill-conceived photojournalism piece,
Monday's edition would have won top
honors.
The piece was ill-conceived because it
exploited human suffering while
neglecting its systemic causes. And it
was irresponsible because, like the rest
of the media, it portrayed the criminals
as black and Chicano and all of the good
guys and saviors as white.
First, on the front page they show
two white officers arresting a black man
supposedly coming out of a crack house.
The photo quality is so poor that all you
can see is one set of white hands cuffing
a pair of black hands, a billy club and
another white officer looking on. Jesse
Helms couldn't have designed a better
campaign to reinforce negative racial
stereotypes and support a "more police
less crime" philosophy. (And the Daily
prides itself in having a liberal slant!
HA!)
Just below, the caption reads "East
Palo Alto by day can seem like most
other towns, but the city's drug dealers
and criminals wait for the cover of dark
ness to spring into action"!?!
Now on to the main program. On the
left side of the double page documentary

inside is the "despair" side. Here, we get
the disturbing photos of cops, criminals
and junkies in action. At one point
we're even treated to a picture of a Lati
no man who had just been shot in the
groin as white officers arrive on the
scene.
But before you vow to never take
University Avenue at night we get the
happy "hope" side on the right.
Here, we see happy little black and
Latino kids in a classroom with their
bilingual white teacher. (The Daily
didn't realize its "Night & Day'Vßad &
Good motif was playing itself out as
Non-White & White in the photos.)
What kills me is not even the irre
sponsibility of the black bad guys and
white good guys tangled up in the
"Night & Day" theme, but rather the
fact that they chose to focus on East
Palo Alto the way they did.
If you want to use "Night & Day" as
your theme, you don't juxtapose crimi
nals at night "waiting to spring into
action" with schoolchildren in the day
as a representation of what happens in
East Palo Alto in a 24-hour period. If
you really want to deal with a night
and-day difference, why not juxtapose
the disparity between the haves & the
have-nots on either side of Route 101?
Did The Daily send its investigative
reporters over to EPA to interview
high-school students, community lead
ers, gang members and parents to get a

broader understanding of what's hap
pening there?
No. Instead The Daily opts to drive
around with police and then print three
pictures of a woman who had just died of
a heroin overdose, and they had the nerve
to print her full name and address (and
I'm sure it wasn't so you could send flow
ers).
And if all of this wasn't enough, they
write, "One can only hope that the high
ly competent officers along with the city's
residents can help EPA lose its distinc
tion as the country's most dangerous
community." Notice they don't mention
what part Stanford can play in this effort.
However, on the front page of that
same issue, The Daily tells us how an ad
hoc committee dubbed the "Dream team"
spent $22,000 last weekend dreaming
about a $200 million project to improve
access between the Stanford and Palo
Alto.
I hope being a Daily columnist and all,
that I'm not cutting off the hand that
feeds me. But the way I look at it, if the
hand that feeds me belongs to a criminal,
I'd rather starve.
