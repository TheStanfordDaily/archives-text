## Netters can't measure up, fall short in Berkeley, 6-3 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team took an unblemished 5-0
Pacific 10 South record and a
No. 1 national ranking into
Berkeley yesterday afternoon in
the hopes of sweeping its season
series with the No. 4 Golden
Bears.
Unfortunately, it was the
Cardinal who came back blem
ished.
Stanford (19-2, 5-1 Pac-10
South) fell to California (15-3, 3-
2) by a 6-3 score in only its sec
ond dual-match loss of the year.
While the Cardinal enjoyed
its second-striaght two-week
rankings period in the top spot
heading into the match, the
Golden Bears had been enjoying
a late-season surge, moving up
two spots in polls released earli
er this week.
The Cardinal suffered a sim
ilar loss to the Bears last year
at Berkeley, 5-4, but beat Cal
by that same score this year
March 6 at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
Stanford was missing No. 3
singles and doubles player Kim
Shasby going into the competi
tion, but also played without
No. 6 Amy Chiminello, who
remained home with the flu.
The Bears also found them
selves without key players —
notably, No. 3 singles player

Cara Abe and No. 2 doubles
player Valerie Poulos.
The lineup changes left
junior Emma Woodhouse in the
No. 5 position and freshman
Wendy Sacks at the vacant No. 6
spot, while Cal inserted
Keirsten Alley into its No. 6
slot.
The bad news came early for
the Cardinal, as No. 1 junior
Laxmi Poruri was upset by Cali
fornia fceshman Pam Nelson in
the first singles match, 6-4, 6-4.
Nelson is ranked No. 53 in the
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion rankings, while Poruri is
ranked No. 2.
Stanford rebounded in the
No. 2 match, however, as senior
captain Heather Willens defeat
ed Jennifer Poulos by a 6-0, 7-6
score.
But the Golden Bears then
ran off three straight singles
wins. At No. 3, junior Kristine
Kurth won a tight second-set
tiebreaker, but couldn't pull out
the win in her 6-3, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3
defeat at the hands of Lisa
Parks.
California's Veena Prabhakar
handed Stanford's Beth Berris
her first individual dual-match
loss in the No. 4 position,
pulling out a close 7-6, 6-7 (1-7),
6-2 win over the Cardinal fresh
man.
Woodhouse met a similar fate
in her No. 5 match, dropping a
6-2, 7-5 decision to Nicole

Elliott.
Sacks kept it close for Stan
ford by winning the No. 6 sin
gles match against the Bears'
Alley, 6-1, 6-7, 6-3.
However, California took two
out of the three doubles match
es, as it did against the Cardinal
earlier this season, and sealed
the dual-match upset.
The No. 1 team of Poruri and
Willens had an easy time of it
against California's Nelson and
Alley, winning 6-3, 6-4, but that
would ultimately be the last
Stanford win of the day.
Number three Woodhouse
and Sacks were swamped by the
Bears' Parks and Prabhakar, 6-
0, 6-0, which wrapped up the
dual win for California. Berris
and Kurth defaulted their No. 2
doubles match against Poulos
and Elliott after losing the first
set 7-6 (7-2).
The Cardinal will not face the
Golden Bears again, unless it
meets them at the Pac-10
Championships April 22
through 25 or at the NCAA
Championships in Gainesville,
Fla., from May 12 through 20.
Stanford will return to con
ference play tomorrow against
No. 10 Arizona at 1:30 p.m., fol
lowed by a Saturday 1 p.m.
match against No. 7 Arizona
State.
Both matches will be held at
Stanford Tennis Stadium, and
admission is free.


Victor Cheng — Daily filo
Amy Chiminello, normally Stanford's No. 6 singles player, sat out yesterday's match in Berkeley with
the flu. The top-ranked Cardinal could have used her, however, as it fell to No. 4 Cal, 6-3.
