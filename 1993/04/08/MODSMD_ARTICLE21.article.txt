# Burdick golfs to victory

### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
For Steve Burdick, it was the tourna
ment of a lifetime.
For the rest of the Stanford men's
golf team, however, the Southwestern
Intercollegiate Invitational served as an
indication of how far the squad still has
to go to compete with the very best.
While its sophomore captain won the
individual competition, the Cardinal
only managed a 14th-place finish in the
team standings at the Southwestern,
held Monday and Tuesday in Westlake
Village, Calif.
Burdick shot 67, 69 and 72 in three
rounds on the par-71 North Ranch Golf
Club course, to finish five strokes under
par with a final tally of 208. The next
best golfer was Chris Zambri of USC,
who finished with a three-under 210.
Defending-champion Scott Peterson of
Colorado and Arizona State's Todd
Bensey tied for third at 211.
"Burdick had a great tournament and
played just great golf. He showed lots of

maturity. I'm really proud of him,"
coach Wally Goodwin said.
"It was a great tournament with a
great field," Burdick said. "I was able to
make a really good start and stayed away
from mistakes on a really narrow course.
I kept the ball in play and it was good
enough. It was great. I was speechless."
Burdick's play has spoken volumes
for him this season, as he has been Stan
ford's most consistent player and is the
only member of this year's team to have
played on last year's Pacific 10 Confer
ence-champion squad.
Sophomores Darren Dragovich, Jerry
Chang and Matt Thompson followed
Burdick, tallying scores of 222, 234 and
245, respectively. Senior Dave Rutkows
ki also shot 245.
Arizona State took the team title at
the tournament, beating out 17 other
squads. USC, who hosted the tourna
ment, finished second.
"I think we're starting to come along
a little bit," Goodwin said of his team's
overall performance. "We could have fin
ished 10th or 11th."
