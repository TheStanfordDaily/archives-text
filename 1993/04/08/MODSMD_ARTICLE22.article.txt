# Women's ruggers debut in style

It's not always easy to get over the
hump and achieve the first victory of a
season. For the Stanford women's
rugby team, that hump must have
seemed like Mount Everest.
After dropping its first seven games
to local club teams, the Cardinal
squad has been on a streak of late,
earning a win and a tie in its past two
contests. Stanford clobbered Wash
ington State, 31-0, three weeks ago
and managed a 5-5 stalemate with
Harvard last weekend.
In the victory March 13, the Cardi
nal dominated its opponent, despite
the fact that the Cougars are a top
ranked squad with more experience
than the recently formed Stanford
team.
The Stanford women got to work
early, scoring a try just minutes into
the first half. The Cardinal back line
then contributed three of the next
four tries, the final one being scored
by freshman sensation Emily Shank
lin, who chased a kicked ball into the
corner of the try-zone and dove on it

for five points.
Bobbie Bernstein followed
Shanklin's try with an unusually dif
ficult conversion kick from the side
line, bringing the score to 31-0.
"We really needed this win," said co
captain Elizabeth Bassett, who played
for the struggling team last year, before
it folded due to lagging interest. "It's
easy to get discouraged playing every
weekend against nationally ranked club
sides. Today was our chance to prove
we couid hold our own against another
college team."
Although the Harvard contest
proved to be a tight match, the Cardi
nal players nevertheless felt they had
outplayed their East Coast opponent.
"We played really, really well
against them," freshman Jen Kerns
said. "We should have won, because
the ball was on their side the whole
time."
However, Kerns' score near the end
of the second half gave Stanford its
only points of the game.
Many of the players attribute the
team's comeback after last season to
the new Cardinal coach, Nancy Breen,
herself a retired US National-side

rugger. Breen was delighted, but not
surprised, by the victory against
Washington State.
"We have a young, inexperienced
team, but it's made up of a bunch of
hard-working, dedicated athletes,"
Breen said. "Today's win against a
much more experienced team bodes
well for the future of Stanford
women's rugby."
"It definitely brings our confidence
level up," Kerns said. "We know that
our level is comparable to (other col
lege teams)."
The Cardinal needed some bright
spots after scoring just once in its
seven games against the much more
experienced club teams from Sacra
mento and the Bay Area. Playing such
skilled opponents has proven beneficial
in the long run, however.
"It's definitely good to play those
teams," Kerns said. "It really helped a
lot to get a feel for the game."
With two outstanding perfor
mances under its belt, and a chance to
travel to the national championships
in three weeks, the future looks
bright for the Cardinal women's
rugby team.
