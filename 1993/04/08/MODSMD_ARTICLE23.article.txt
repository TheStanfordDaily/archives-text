# Trojans in town as Cardinal batters try to tighten Six-Pac race
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Front-running USC visits
Sunken Diamond this weekend
for a three-game set that con
cludes the club's season series
with Stanford.
Every conference game is
important for the unranked
Cardinal (16-13 overall, 4-8 in
the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) at this point
in the season.
Their series with No. 9 USC
(21-16), which opens today at
2:30 p.m., is anything but an
exception.

"Obviously, this series is
pretty big," said second base
man Jeff DesJardins. "If we
play well, this could be a turn
ing point in our season."
"Southern Cal is a much
improved team since the last time
we saw them," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess.
"They've picked it up offen
sively."
The Trojans, one of the
hottest teams in the Six-Pac,
are 13-5 since dropping two of
three to the Cardinal last
month at Dedeaux Field in Los
Angeles.
"They execute the hit-and

run well, and thpy apply pres
sure on the bases more than any
other team in the conference,"
Marquess said.
Catcher Casey Burrill has
spearheaded the Trojan attack
all season long.
Burrill, a senior, leads the
conference in batting with a
.455 mark, and his 11 home
runs are good enough for fourth
in the league.
"Burrill is a really tough out
right now," said Stanford pitch
er Andrew Lorraine. "He has
more home runs (11) than
strikeouts (8), which is a really
amazing stat."

But it was freshman short
stop Gabe Alvarez who turned
in the big numbers last time
around for USC.
Alvarez delivered clutch hits
in all three contests against
Stanford, including a ninth
inning home run in Game 2, and
was 7-for-12 overall with six
runs batted in.
"I was really impressed with
Alvarez," Lorraine said. "He's
one of the better hitters in the
league, even for a freshman."
The USC pitching staff,
expected to be the class of the
Six-Pac, has been ravaged by
injuries for much of the year.
Starting pitchers Kent Donnelly
(arm surgery) and Ben Tucker
(rib stress fracture) have missed
most of the season. With over
20 games remaining on their
schedule, the Trojans have
already used eight different
starters.
The Stanford staff, on the
other hand, has established
itself as one of the best in the
conference. Junior Willie
Adams is coming off a five-hit
shutout, the first of his career,
against California Friday. Lor
raine tossed a complete game
victory over Cal as well, striking
out a career-best 11 in a 3-2
win.
"Our most consistent thing
Las been our pitching," Mar
quess said. "Adams and Lor
raine have given us good out
ings almost every time out
there."
In addition, Todd Bartels is
coming off his best two starts of
the season. The freshman
righthander allowed no earned
runs in an eight-inning no deci
sion against Cal, and is expected
to start Sunday's game.
Reliever Greg Mix has also

impressed Marquess lately. The
senior, who took the loss
against Cal Sunday, nearly
pitched his way out of a bases
loaded, no-outs jam in the 10th
inning of that game.
"Our pitching numbers are
respectable," the coach said.
"Our weaknesses have been
offensively and defensively."
Marquess has experimented
with several lineup changes
over the past few weeks in an
attempt to bolster both the
offense and defense, giving
juniors Rod Meyer and Des-
Jardins increased playing time
at center field and second base.
Steve Carver, who has spent
time at both designated hitter
and left field, continues to pace
the Cardinal with his .371 aver
age. The sophomore collected
six hits against Cal last week
end.
"We've been hitting the ball
pretty well," Lorraine said. "We

just haven't been scoring the
runs."
While Stanford ended a five
game skid by taking two of
three from Cal, they still trail
USC in the Six-Pac by four
games.
However, the Cardinal would
jump into the middle of another
heated conference race with a
strong performance against the
Trojans.
"It's a difficult division," said
Marquess. "USC is probably the
favorite since they've won some
big series/ but [the race] will
probably stay bunched together
like last year."
In 1992, only five games sep
arated first-place Arizona from
the last-place Trojans.
"We came out and won some
games last weekend, although I
thought we should have won all
three," Lorraine said. "We're
just one weekend away from
really turning things around."
