Men's Rugby
Last weekend, the Stanford men's
rugby team traveled south for the Santa
Barbara Invitational Tournament and
came away with its second tournament
championship in as many years.
Stanford cruised to big victories in pre
liminary games over Cal State-Fullerton,
UC-San Diego and San Jose State Satur
day. In the Sunday morning final against
IJCSB, the Cardinal continued its season
long habit of coming out slowly, but then
cruised to a 30-7 victory. The Gauchos led
at the half by a score of 7-3, but Stanford
coach Franck Boivert counseled his team
not to become anxious as the second half
started.
The strategy paid off as Cardinal for
wards then took control of the game.
Whenever the Gauchos seemed to be stop
ping their opponents' running attack, the
Stanford big men bound together around

the ball and marched down the field.
Dan Byers, John Girard, Kevin Linker
and Brian Schultz all recorded scores for
the Cardinal. The team dedicated the win
to a collegiate-rugby player from Colorado
who recently suffered an injury that has
left him confined to a wheelchair; the Stan
ford players have chosen to send him the
tournament trophy along with a Stanford
jersey.
The Cardinal will practice intensely for
the next week and a half before leaving for
Corvallis, Ore., to compete in the Pacific
Coast playoffs April 16 through 18. Stan
ford is looking to upend defending national
champion California and earn a berth in
the Final Four, to be held May 1 and 2 in
Houston.
"We've worked hard and had a great
season," said junior scrum-half Kevin
Linker. "But none of that will matter if we
can't do what we set out to do at the begin
ning of the season, beat Cal."
