# Safety engineer sues University
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A Stanford safety engineer
has filed suit against the Univer
sity, charging that supervisors
wanted him to ignore health and
safety hazards and discriminat
ed against him when he refused.
The lawsuit — filed last week
in Santa Clara County Superior
Court on behalf of Environmen
tal Health and Safety Depart
ment employee Gary Schell — al
leges that Stanford managers:
• asked Schell to ignore the
University's failure to correct
and report health and safety haz
ards, particularly in the Gilbert
Building for Biological Sciences;
• criticized Schell's whistle
blowing behavior and excluded
him from important health and
safety meetings and regulatory
reviews by public agencies;
• subjected him to "ridicule
and contempt," and subtle ha
rassment; and
• deprived him of two 10 per
cent salary increases he had re
ceived.
Senior University Counsel
Mike Vartain said the University
will respond to the allegations
when it is officially served the
lawsuit, which should occur

within a few days.
Schell directs programs for
emergency preparedness and the
investigation and prevention of
accidents. His other responsibili
ties include creating hazardous
substance controls as well as
identifying, analyzing and cor
recting safety deficiencies.
According to the 22-page law
suit, when Stanford hired Schell
in 1986, it assured him "the op
portunity to perform his job free
from ostracism, retaliation, ha
rassment, internal or external
pressure, or other forms of con
duct designed to inhibit the
plaintiffs truthfulness ... in the
performance of his job responsi
bilities."
But, the lawsuit states, Schell
worked "under difficult, adverse
and stressful circumstances . . .
posing a growing moral, ethical
and statutory dilemma to him,
and others, caused by Stanford's
continuing and repeated failure
to abide by proper health and
safety regulations, standards
and procedures."
Menlo Park lawyer John
Shaffer, who is representing
Schell, said the University may
have been attempting to force
Schell to resign. "He's not neces
sarily a well-liked individual
because often what he is suggest
ing is expensive and inconvenient
to the University," Shaffer said.
"He's like the voice of con
science saying, 'Hey, we can't do
it this way,' " Shaffer added.
The suit seeks more than
$10,500 in lost wages, as well as
general damages for emotional
distress and punitive damages "in
an amount sufficient to deter
Stanford and other defendants,
and others like them, from the
same or similar conduct."
The suit states that internal
and external investigations in
recent years have uncovered a
host of safety regulation viola
tions, including:

• insufficient training and
improper analysis, storage and
destruction of hazardous waste;
• condoning erroneous design
and providing inadequate protec
tion from health hazards in build
ings such as Gilbert, the McCul
lough Building and the Stauffer
Buildings; and
• allowing improper health and
safety inspections as well as
harassment and termination of
health and safety officials.
Although the University
offered assurances that it would
follow up on the alleged safety vio
lations, "Mr. Schell's experience is
to the contrary," Shaffer said.
He deferred more specific ques
tions regarding violations discov
ered by Schell until the case pro
ceeds further, "in the hope that
we're going to resolve this."
This is not the first time Stan
ford has been accused of trying to
cover up safety hazards or the

first time Shaffer has helped sue
the University. In 1988, he suc
cessfully represented an assistant
safety director who claimed Uni
versity officials forced his 1987
resignation to cover up alleged
toxic-regulation violations.
Jon Moldestad, who headed
Stanford's Environmental Safety
Facility, blew the whistle on such
safety hazards as improperly stored
explosive chemicals, toxic waste
and an improperly functioning
incinerator at the Medical Center.
His letter of resignation —
which alleged that the University
wasted millions of dollars shoddi
ly managing health and safety,
unnecessarily endangering Stan
ford's faculty, staff and students
— prompted two investigations.
SRI International of Menlo
Park conducted a brief walk
through audit of 10 research
buildings. Although the report
said the University took "unnec

essary risks" because of lax atti
tudes toward safe handling of
toxic substances, auditors found
no "clear and present" danger.
Moldestad argued that Stan
ford and SRI were negligent in
proclaiming no serious dangers
existed when the report stated its
purpose "was not to conduct a
thorough health and safety
inspection or to identify all code
violations."
Angered by the SRI investiga
tion, Moldestad sued, claiming
Stanford and SRI covered up or
falsified SRl's inquiry. It cited
personal damages including
breach of contract, defamation of
character, intimidation and
harassment.
The second investigation, by
University auditor David Fetter
man, found "a serious case of
institutionalized mismanage
ment" but dismissed Moldestad's
charges of an institutional cover

up of safety problems.
After those investigations,
then-University President Donald
Kennedy announced a substantial
shakeup in the administration,
creating three new health and
safety positions, as well as the for
mation of a permanent new com
mittee on health and safety and
more clearly delineated policies.
Shaffer, who University
lawyers called "abusive" in 1989,
requested thousands of pages of
documents relating to campus
health and safety.
Soon after University officials
began testifying in deposition pro
ceedings, Stanford settled with
Moldestad for $200,000, the full
amount requested in the suit.
Although the University
denied legal liability, it acknowl
edged that in one incident a
supervisor had ordered Moldestad
to stay away from reporters with
his story or be fired.
