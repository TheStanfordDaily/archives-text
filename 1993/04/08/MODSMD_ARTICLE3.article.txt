# Safety engineer sues University
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A Stanford safety engineer
has filed suit against the Univer
sity, charging that supervisors
wanted him to ignore health and
safety hazards and discriminat
ed against him when he refused.
The lawsuit — filed last week
in Santa Clara County Superior
Court on behalf of Environmen
tal Health and Safety Depart
ment employee Gary Schell — al
leges that Stanford managers:
• asked Schell to ignore the
University's failure to correct
and report health and safety haz
ards, particularly in the Gilbert
Building for Biological Sciences;
• criticized Schell's whistle
blowing behavior and excluded
him from important health and
safety meetings and regulatory
reviews by public agencies;
• subjected him to "ridicule
and contempt," and subtle ha
rassment; and
• deprived him of two 10 per
cent salary increases he had re
ceived.
Senior University Counsel
Mike Vartain said the University
will respond to the allegations
when it is officially served the
lawsuit, which should occur

within a few days.
Schell directs programs for
emergency preparedness and the
investigation and prevention of
accidents. His other responsibili
ties include creating hazardous
substance controls as well as
identifying, analyzing and cor
recting safety deficiencies.
According to the 22-page law
suit, when Stanford hired Schell
in 1986, it assured him "the op
portunity to perform his job free
from ostracism, retaliation, ha
rassment, internal or external
pressure, or other forms of con
duct designed to inhibit the
plaintiffs truthfulness ... in the
performance of his job responsi
bilities."
But, the lawsuit states, Schell
worked "under difficult, adverse
and stressful circumstances . . .
posing a growing moral, ethical
and statutory dilemma to him,
and others, caused by Stanford's
continuing and repeated failure
to abide by proper health and
safety regulations, standards
and procedures."
Menlo Park lawyer John
Shaffer, who is representing
Schell, said the University may
have been attempting to force
