Fall a possible suicide attempt
Stanford police are treating the case of a stu
dent who fell from the seventh floor of an Escon
dido Village high-rise as an attempted suicide,
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
The student — who is being held for observa
tion at Stanford Hospital — was interviewed by
police Tuesday and "had no recollection of any
thing," said Niemeyer.
The student did not know anyone living in
Hoskins apartment building and could not recall
why he was there. "It is still basically a mystery,"
said Niemeyer. "We still don't know what his
intentions were.
"We've learned this man has had a history of
undergoing psychiatric therapy," Niemeyer
added.
The man sustained injuries to his legs and head
as a result of the incident and underwent surgery
Tuesday for a blood clot in his brain, Niemeyer
said.

Bungling bike burglar busted
A campus employee charged with stealing two
bicycles told police he did it to replace two bikes
previously stolen from him, said Police Capt.

Raoul Niemeyer.
Information supplied by an observant Adams
House resident helped police apprehend 32-year
old Jose Meraz Saturday night. The witness saw a
suspicious man walking with a locked bicycle over
his shoulder and watched him put the bicycle in a
blue Saab, said Niemeyer.
Meraz "kept looking over his shoulder and
looking back at [the student]," said Niemeyer.
Sgt. John McMullen was on patrol Saturday
night and saw the blue Saab at the Beacon gas sta
tion at 715 Serra St. — right across from the
police station. While talking with Meraz,
McMullen saw the bicycle in the back of the car.
When McMullen asked Meraz what the prob
lem was, Meraz made a "spontaneous" confession
that he had stolen the bicycle, according to
Niemeyer.
Meraz also confessed to stealing another bicy
cle from Escondido Village on Dec. 24, 1992,
Niemeyer said. While Meraz was a suspect in that
theft, he had "steadfastly denied" taking the bicy
cle when previously interviewed, Niemeyer said.
Meraz — who attended Stanford as a graduate
student between 1984 and 1989 — has been
charged with two counts of petty theft. He cur
rently works on campus and lives in Palo Alto,
Niemeyer said.
