## On Kafka, Camus and 'Cool Like Dat' 
### 
By now you've probably heard Digable
Planets. If you haven't, it's time to
check the Oven-Stuffer™ timer,
'cause you're done. Maybe you had a chance
to see them last Sunday as they squalled
through San Jose rolling up their sold-out
Bay Area tour. Yeah, we were there. We were
the ones in the deejay booth.

We like Digable Planets.
We even like them for more
reasons than the fact we had
a stack of comps thicker than
your Hum Sex textbook-

But then again, when two seniors have a
stack of necessary-to-graduate incompletes
thicker than your Hum Sex textbook... well,
how can we put this subtly? How 'bout: does
the acting registzar like rap music? Arms for
hostages, indirect costs for yachts... concert
tickets for diplomas. When you think about
it, it's just not that bad. Everyone does it in
the U.K.
But on their newly released album,
"Rcachin' (A New Refutation Of Time &
Space)," Digable Planets docs something rather
unique: they credit their samples. For in
stance, they list the licks used from tenor sax
messiah Sonny Rollins, famous for once an
nouncing the Bulls versus Knicks' play-off
score during a show at Carnegie Hall, and not
coming out for an encore until the Knicks ate it.
By giving credit to the musicians who
make the album's sound possible, Digable
engages in a very honest dialog with their au
diences. After all, they're probably going to
get more play and money off their single "Re
birth Of Slick (Cool Like Dat)" than many of
the artists sampled ever got in their careers.
And giving those artists props accomplishes
the hip semiotics of explaining a history and
context to Digable's sound not stored in the
digitized logic of CDs.

While the style and arrangement might be
all original, all Digable — the music didn't
start with them. Choosing to come clean and
not mask themselves in implied originality re
connects them with a jazz legacy of keeping
true to your tubers, of working out the impor-

tance of individual takes on
collectively produced art.
Besides, Digable buys out
of the rather elitist tip of eso
teria, of deejay cold-warring
about who can find the most

obscure riff. For those of you
still scoping the sale bins at Groove Mer
chants, the sample to "They Want EFX" is
James Brown; the flute solo in "Supa" is from
"Round Midnight"; the vibe part in "Who
Got The Props?" isn't really a sample, it's the
guy from Giant Step; and Penn & Teller had
someone under the box of frozen fish on
"Letterman."
With the emergence of sampling as an ex
plosive and defining force across many musi
cal genres throughout the later '80s and early
'90s, music has been adding another dimen
sion to itself — one where technical virtuosi
ty over an instrument is phasing out, replaced
by the creativity of the edit, a technician's
ability to layer a cybcrtronic matrix of sounds
into a cohesive, deep whole — whoa... we're
having a postmodern moment: Someone
hold us and pass the Cafe Vienna.
As music continues evolving, it does so by
changing with the social and technological
contexts it flows through. Both musicians
and audiences are always challenged to rede
fine quality, to find new ways of building
sound and the spaces for its enjoyment. Di
gable Planets offers an approach for not los
ing connections with the strides and accom
plishments of the past in the midst of con
structing the current. ■
