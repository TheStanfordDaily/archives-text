## Let slip the dogs of publishing 
### 
For the last few years, the cow has been the
domestic animal of choice inartistic cir
cles. This year, apparently, it's the dog.
In two new books that came out last
month, "Recital of the Dog" by David Rabe
and "Let the Dog Drive" by David Bowman,
dogs are not only man's best friends, but

man's greatest curses, man's
unlikeliest deities, General
Motors' most intrepid crash
test dummies, and woman's
best ... well, let's just say

they're a little more intimate than friends.
But these books have more in common
than dogs and the authors' first names. In
many ways, they typify what fiction of this
decade tends to look like: very stylized, self
conscious, loosely structured first-person nar
ratives that are more obsessed with iconogra
phy than your ninth grade British Lit teacher.
Rabe's book takes us deep inside the psy
che of a frustrated painter who kills his
neighbor's dog and so begins a terrifying
and seemingly infinite downward spiral into
insanity and violence. An Obie award-win
ning playwright, Rabe is apparently so over
joyed to be released from the restraints of di
alogue that he eschews human interaction
almost entirely, attempting instead to con
struct a complex internal logic from the tur
bulent psychoses of his persona.
The novel draws the reader in only occa
sionally, most notably in the rare occasions
when the main character actually interacts
with other people and Rabe's keen sense of sit
uation and dialogue shines through. For most
of the book, the reader is forced to slog
through pages and pages of disconnected hal
lucinations, which are ultimately unconvinc
ing and instead read like a pretentious artistic
notion of what hallucinations ought to be.
The ghosts that haunt Bowman's novel are

Ted Quinn

decidedly more down-to-earth. A strange
and pungent jambalaya of Emily Dickinson,
Dashiel Hammett, sun-bleached California
cultism and gritty New York angst, the book
winds a twisted path through America as our
hero, Bud Salem, hitchhikes his way into the

strange and diseased heart of
the Cushman family and the
psychedelic crime story which
ensues.
The book is paradoxically
more obviously fictional and

yet more honest than Rabe's work. We get the
sense that we are listening to a fable of sorts,
but that Bowman is writing from the gut, cre
ating a mosaic of his world from these eclec
tic snippets of modern Zeitgeist in a style rem
iniscent of Mark Leyner.
Both novels reflect the self-conscious
ethos of a society in chaos, desperately seek
ing some sort of healing through feverish in
trospection, yet only fabricating more con
fusion and despair in the process. The re
lentless images that spill forth from the
books echo our endless attempts to get a
handle on our collective psychosis by
mythologizing ourselves through every
thing from 30-second television commer
cials to New Age mysticism.
And in the center of it all lies the dog, the
expression of a tragic longing for a simple
kindness and an unwavering loyalty which
America must have lost long ago.
In the idiotic grin of a mutt, these authors
seek respite from the painful throes of exces
sive self-awareness which resonate through
so much modern fiction. Give us a warm
spot in front of the fireplace and a scratch
behind the ears and we'll be happy, they
seem to proclaim in the murky subtext of
their work.
It doesn't sound all that bad, does it? ■
