I'm halfway through a telephone interview
with Leonard Cohen, at a momentary loss
for a question, when he says, with more in
flection than normal, "A friend of mine is ar
ranging flowers in my house now. It's very
beautiful. One vase after another is emerging."
Since I have only a limited time to speak
with the celebrated songwriter-singer-poet
novelist, I go on with my questions concern
ing his past work and his new album, "The Fu
ture." Still, it comes as no surprise that he
would just as soon talk about the flowers.
Cohen is anything but self-important about
his role as a songwriter.
"I never thought of myself as a musician or
a writer. I just happened upon these instru
ments, and I've used them in the most direct
and immediate way just to produce a setting
for something I have to say. What I have to say
is not based on any particular idea, but just on
an urgency."
So says one of the most respected song
writers over the past three decades, on the eve
of a European and American tour to promote
his 10th album, his first in four years. You may
know him from his most famous song,
"Suzanne"; you may know his music from the
Robert Altman film, "McCabe and Mrs.
Miller"; or you may never have heard of him at
all. Throughout what he describes as his
"shabby career," he has had no strategy but to
pursue honesty in his art.
In its latest incarnation, that art is a power
ful combination of keyboards, strings and
percussion behind Cohen's voice, which is
about an octave lower and 20 grains rougher
than it was on "Suzanne."
Cohen, 58, grew up in Montreal. He
published his first book of poetry, "Let
Us Compare Mythologies," in 1956. It
contained a mixture of the religious, sexual
and violent imagery which would character
ize much of his work.
Over the next 12 years, he would release
four more books of poetry and two novels, es
tablishing himself as one of the leading Cana
dian writers of his generation. His 1968 an
thology, "Selected Poems," won Canada's
highest literary prize, the Governor General's
Award. Around this time, though, to the cha
grin of many of the literary cognoscenti com
ing to praise him, he began a career in music.
Several of the songs on his first album,
"Songs of Leonard Cohen," had appeared in
his fourth poetry book, "Parasites of Heaven."
Concerning the transition from writing to
singing, Cohen says, "No thought was given to
it at all. I've always played guitar... and there
was always an invisible guitar behind all my
work, whether it was prose or poetry or song."
Still, his music is not a mere echo of his
books. Cohen once commented that his 1984
Book of Mercy "isn't aimed the way a song is
aimed." When asked how he manages to
"aim" his songs, there is a long pause. Then, in
his unmistakable baritone — building in in
tensity, but not pitch nor volume — he offers,
"You know, you close one eye, squint with the
other, look down the barrel and try to line one
end up with the other."
In similarly creative ways, Cohen has often
resisted over-analysis ofhis words. Throughout
his career, he has displayed genius at pitting his
work against his public persona. "Let Us Com
pare Mythologies" contained the lines, "I heard
of a man/who says words so beautifully/that if
he only speaks their name/women give them
selves to him." Cohen tells that this particular
poem will lead off a new written anthology
soon to be published, and that "it was both a
fear and an aspiration. There's always someone
who is going to be speaking words more beau-

tifully than you, so it's a very hazardous
aspiration."
As he says the words, though, with
his friend in the background

arranging flowers in his Los
Angeles home, he can take
comfort that he has valiantly

struggled on behalf of such beauty. In the past
he has compared his work to an ice cube in a
drink, which acts "to give comfort."
"I like that metaphor, and I'm not sure
what it means, but it seems to be right, that I
feel my work is like ice cubes in a drink. It just
changes the drink. Even though the songs are
dense and carefully worked out, it's very diffi-

cult to say exactly what they mean or stand for.
But like the taste of cold water, it's refreshing."
Despite the obvious irony of attempting
"to give comfort" by singing as he often
does about chaos and despair, he main
tains he has yet to go far enough in that direc
tion. "I haven't exposed enough discomfort. I
still feel the songs are hedging their bets and are
alibis for the real thing. They've got to get clear
er and more disclosing, more disclosing."
This unyielding drive for honesty is one
way in which Cohen has separated himself
from the wave of "poet"-singers who rode Bob
Dylan's success into recording contracts in the
1960's and

1970'5. An
other is how
he has re
mained sur
prisingly free
of political
pretense:
"I'm not
impressed by

my opin
ions at
all. It is

the kind of in formation that
arises from the work of mak
ing the songs that interests
me, and those are positions.

story by scott crawford

"I call them positions rather than opinions.
Those are positions that I don't command and
I don't use in arguments. They just are posi
tions, they just are constellations of feelings
and thoughts that as I say are often empty and
just act as refreshment or oxygen, rather than
slogans or manifestoes."
Since he generally declines to advertise any
particular message in the songs, one takes no
tice when he does offer commentary: "For
some time there have been recurring scenes or

intimations that have run through the work,
and one is that the social contract has deterio
rated and that a catastrophe has already taken
place on the interior level.
"That we are in the days of the Flood, and
it is more appropriate for us to discern what is
proper behavior in a flood. In other words, if
you're holding onto your piece of orange crate
and you pass somebody who's holding onto

his broken spar, what is the appropriate salu
tation? Do you really want to say 'I'm a liberal'
or 'I'm a conservative' — 'I'm for abortion' or
'I'm against abortion?'
"Aren't these positions highly inappropriate to
the situation? This notion of a catastrophic re
ality that we are all inhabiting is a recurring
position through the songs for the past 10 or
15 years. And where they used to produce a lot
of raised eyebrows 10 or 15 years ago, the eye
brows don't go up quite so high anymore."
Cohen speaks from and about this wasteland
on the new album, explicitly in songs like the
growling "The Future" and "Democracy," and
also on an interpersonal level in the "Waiting for

the Miracle." This latter
song investigates the "new
courtesy" that must arise
with the realization of the
catastrophe: "I think this is

pondering his past
and 'The Future'

the contract, the possible
contract, between lovers or

partners in this shattered landscape.
"It's the other side of waiting. It is the ac
knowledgment of both parties that they are
waiting for the miracle, but having acknowl
edged that, they are free from waiting for the
miracle."
In the song, Cohen even issues a marriage
proposal, which belies the familiar End of
Love scenes between men and women in his
older songs. "Well, [the marriage proposal] is
the other side, when it's clear that the other

'For a long time it was commonly understood

that I only knew three chords, when 1 knew five!'

[person] also has acknowledged ... the ex
tremely remote possibility of coherence that
exists today... then it's possible to address that
other [person] now."
This need for coherence, that people must
accept the chaos that surrounds them in order
to relate to each other, riddles the new album.
"But while one person hangs on to the no
tion that things are as they were before, that
the landscape is intact, that the landmarks are
still erect, that the lights are still shining, that
the whole operation is business as usual —
then there can't really be any kind of declara
tion or proposal between people on either side
of this divide."
While chaotic images are not new to
Cohen's work, the finale of "The
Future" is a new step for him.
"Tacoma Trailer" is a rich instrumental, with
a very tender piano lead backed up by deep
strings and percussion. The musical content
of Cohen's work has often been overlooked.
When asked about his reaction to this bias, he
says, "I'm very accustomed to it now. For a
long time it was commonly understood that I
only knew three chords, when I knew five! So
I felt, yes, neglected."
At the same time, Cohen has always ex
pressed appreciation for any audience his
work finds. He duly acknowledges and makes
peace with the power of the audience when he
says poetry and songwriting are "verdicts
rather than intentions." He elaborates:
"Well, the fact that the lines don't come to
the end of the page does not guarantee the
poem. And the feet that there is a highly urgent
and irrefutable intention to be a poet also does
not guarantee the poem. So there doesn't seem
to be any way to guarantee the poem, it seems
to be the verdict of the people who read it, and
this itself is not secure because each generation
changes the verdict on what is poetry."
So although Leonard Cohen has never felt
he was pursuing a particular career, he has al
ways answered the "urgency" within him in a
forum subject to the mercurial force of his au
dience.
In 1965, he proclaimed himself to be on a
search for a "state of grace," a state of balance
with the chaos that surrounded him. He says
he has since taken the advice "that the search
itself stands in the way of the experience," and
consequendy has called it off. It is not surpris
ing that at the same time he is making state
ments within and without his music that em
brace the chaos.
In closing, Cohen responds to the reading
of a line from his 1978 book, "Death of a
Lady's Man": "Greater is he that answers
Amen than he that says the blessing," explain
ing his sentiments:
"That's a quotation from...the section of
the Talmud called Ethics of the Father. It's
quite a wise and profound saying, and it has
many resonances. That confession to yourself
that you cannot innovate, but you might be
able to affirm that which is worthwhile af
firming, is a wonderful notion and the begin
ning of a kind of wisdom."
And as to whether, in his music, he is inno
vating or affirming he takes a long pause.
I wonder if he's deciding whether or not I
deserve the real answer:
"If the affirmation is passionate and sincere,
then it has the refreshment of innovation."
Amen. ■
