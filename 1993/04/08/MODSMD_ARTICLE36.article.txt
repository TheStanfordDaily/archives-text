# RAM'S HEAD'S West side story
## 
### 
Passionate yearnings of doomed lovers
and furious violence of warring gangs
will fill the stage of Memorial Audito
rium tomorrow night, as Ram's Head The
atrical Society breathes life into Leonard
Bernstein's "West Side Story."
Set in New York City in 1957, the musical
updates the "Romeo and Juliet" tragedy
through the white Jets gang and the Puerto
Rican Sharks. Former Jets member Tony falls
for Maria, the innocent sister of Sharks leader
Bernardo. The star-crossed lovers proceed to
break tradition as they head toward their in
evitable downfall.
Although "West Side Story" 's portrayal of
gang life in the 1950s appears tame and naive
when viewed against the violent backdrop of
1993, director Scott Offerdahl said the staff
chose not to update the musical.
"Looking back on '57 maybe can help us
think about (gang conflict) in a little more
distanced way," said the graduate student,
noting that updating the story would have
proven difficult because "it's a sensitive issue
and hard to gain some perspective (on)."
Offerdahl said he seeks to bring to the
show — "the first musical of its time
to unify dance, score and script" —
some elements many other productions have
ignored.
"One, the Tony character is a real interest
ing one and potentially cardboard if played
wrong," Offerdahl said. "It's always tempting
to cast someone who can only sing, and ignore
the acting. The fact is, Tony is a former gang
member and definitely is a street character
who would fight, and in fact does." From the
flat characterization of Tony in many produc
tions, his climactic decision whether to fight
or make peace often "comes from nowhere."
"Two, the ultimate strength of Maria
needs to come across. Maria is the strongest
character," Offerdahl said, "and that's often
de-emphasized."
"It's easy to make [this story] trite and
simple," said sophomore Lisebeth Kearns,
who plays Maria. "You have to work at it to
get at the real story underneath."
Searching for that depth, the actors seek to
bring dramatic substance to their characters.
"Many people don't see beyond the young
lovers, and there is much more," said fresh
man Aaron Rubenson, who plays Tony. "In
Tony you have the ex-Jet who is quite a tough
guy, a legend on the streets. At the same time
he senses there is something beyond the
gangs. It's a lot of fun to play that character, to
deal with two sides."

Rubenson said the "rumble" scene — in
which Tony must choose between peace and
fighting — presents a challenge because "that
duality which Tony possesses is really brought
to the forefront, and he is forced to deal with
both sides at the same time. I think that's lost
[with many other productions]. In the movie,
he forgets he's a really tough street fighter."
Adding that Maria also has a double-sided
personality, Rubenson said, "She's not just a
helpless young woman who falls in love and
is sort of bashed around by the ways of soci
ety. She's a very capable woman and especial
ly has grown up quite a bit by the end of the
play. It's neat to see that evolution, which is
very difficult [for the actress to play]."
Although Kearns enjoys watching Na
talie Wood play Maria in the 1961
movie version of the musical, she
draws most of her inspiration from the role
itself. "Maria is a pretty complex character,"
the Ram's Head veteran said. "It takes time to
figure out who she is."
The challenge, she said, is to "find those
emotions in myself and then put them aside
and not carry them home with me."
At a retreat held soon after Offerdahl as
sembled the cast, the director had the per
formers talk about their characters — even if
they only speak three words in the whole
show. "Usually in a musical [that kind of
character identification is] blown off," Offer
dahl said. "It really made it real for them."
Kearns said she found it valuable "to hear
Aaron talk about Tony, and how that related
to me and with all the characters and how

they formed a cohesive whole."
Asked if any specific scene sends shivers
down his spine, an excited Offerdahl couldn't
pin down just one. "There are several dance
numbers that blow you away," he said." 'Cool'
is one that is just awe-inspiring. 'America' is
really cool, and 'A Boy Like That' is probably
the most powerful dramatic song.' "
The quintet in "Tonight," featuring five
separate vocal lines by the Jets, Sharks, Tony,

Maria and her friend Anita, is "musically the
most amazing experience," Offerdahl said.
"When that's done you just go oooh, wow,
that's really cool."
The climactic rumble — in which knives
flash on stage in dance-fighting — required
the help of a professional fight choreograph
er. "I hope the fights look convincing on
stage," said Ram's Head veteran Paco Farias,
who plays Bernardo.
In the "powerful" scene in which Anita is
almost raped by the Jets, "you see the culmi
nation of all this racial tension," Rubenson
said. "None of the Jets are evil individually, but
when they all get together, they have a frustra
tion they can't understand, which feeds on it
self and produces a very scary thing."
lthough ethnicity occupies the central
/~\ spotlight in this show, the staff ig-
J. Jinored skin color when casting the
Puerto Rican Sharks and white Jets.
"We decided from day one to cast based on
talent more than anything else," Offerdahl
said, noting the casting of two Asian-Ameri
can Jets and a "hodgepodge" of ethnicities
throughout the rest of the cast. "While the
show is about gangs who have an ethnic con
flict, it's not just Puerto Ricans against white
New York kids. There's more to it than that."
Offerdahl said the two gangs are visually
differentiated by dress and their positions on

stage, rather than ethnicity.
"They casted a lot more on a look than an
ethnic background," said Farias, adding that
he is one of two Latinos in the musical.
Keams, who is white, said, "I don't want it
to come off as, 'Oh, there's a white person try-

ray J
r i
'] hope the fights
look convincing on
stage.'
— Paco Farias
L.J
I ' 'oil

ing to be ethnic.' That's part of the chal
lenge I have to think about what it really
would be like to come to America and be an
immigrant and not just gloss over it."
The vocal director, a linguist, helped the
cast fine-tune their Puerto Rican accents — a
difficult element to learn, Kearns said.
The staff tried to form a "multitalented"
cast that could deftly handle all three chal
lenges of singing, dancing and acting, Offer
dahl said, noting that since Stanford is not a
school that attracts professional dancers, the
stepwork required extra attention.

Cast members credited Offerdahl with
providing the friendly, stable hand
that has led the production to success.
"He has a terrific global understanding of
the play," Rubenson said. "He'll be critiquing
one part while he has in mind how the scene
and the lines are going to affect the rest of the
play. It's difficult to separate the nitty-gritty
from the big picture."
Kearns praised Offerdahl's collaborative
style. "He's been able to command our re
spect but be a friend as well," she said. "He's
very open to what we have to say, but knows
when to put his foot down."
"The cast gets along great," Farias said.
"It's a very friendly cast, very warm."
"When we're working out a scene," Offer
dahl said, "I'm looking for input from the ac
tors, what they think will make it work. I don't
really buy the whole dictator approach. It's a
lot more fun to get 50 peoples' creative input."
Offerdahl, who has acted, vocal directed
and music directed in such Stanford produc
tions as the "New Stu Review," "Gaieties,"
"Into the Woods" and "Evita," said he in
spires his actors and actresses "with the car
rot and not with the stick."
"When a scene works, there's a real magic
that everyone in the room can feel," he said.
"I emphasize those times to the actors in and
out of the scene. I say, 'See, isn't that magic re
ally cool?' and then say the things that made

it that way. I get reactions from them, and
they think about it."
"It's been fun to see them grow into their
characters," Offerdahl added.
Tomorrow — a year after Ram's Head
members approved the show and six months
after planning meetings began — the actors
will try to step into their characters' skins,
discarding thoughts of line memorization
and grueling hours of practice.
Kearns, noting she has never done any
thing like "West Side Story," said she is "excit
ed and really nervous. I feel a lot of pressure

right now."
"I have seen all of the things I want to see,"
Offerdahl said. "Now it's a matter of getting
them on stage at the same time. There is a lit
tle stress in the back of my mind. I have to
give the show up. On Friday, it's not me; I'll
be there in the audience watching them.'n

"West Side Story" will be performed at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium on Friday, April 9; Satur
day, April 10; and Thursday to Sunday, April 15-
17. Tickets $10, $7 students/seniors. For tickets
