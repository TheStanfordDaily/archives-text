Indecent Proposal

Enter stage right: Young, loving couple
seeking the American dream of financial se
curity in a time of recession.
Enter stage left: Billionaire playboy look
ing upon the world with a gaze that says,
"My, what a simple breed these peasants
are!"
Billionaire offers the husband a cool mil
lion for one night with the wife. Couple
thinks about it, decides their relationship is
strong enough to go through with it and put
it in their past. After all, they say, it's only one
night. And so unfolds the story of "Indecent
Proposal."
An original idea? Not really. It was done
in "Honeymoon in Vegas." An engaging
script? Hardly. If the characters were any
shallower, they'd have "No Diving" tattooed
on their foreheads.
Good acting? Don't count on it. Woody
Harrelson plays David Murphy, the pathetic
sap who allows his wife to be "bought." In a
feeble attempt at masculinity, he punches
walls and breaks things, but still comes off as

a spineless wimp. He shows more passion
and sex appeal as the bland bartender on
"Cheers."
Demi Moore (Diana Murphy) and
Robert Redford (billionaire John Gage) give
uninspired portrayals of uninspiring char
acters. It doesn't matter, though — no
amount of talent could salvage this film.
Viewers can't sympathize with the Mur
phys when "only one night" casts such a
shadow on their relationship that Gage can
move in for the kill. They were stupid
enough to accept, and Diana even seems to
have enjoyed the experience.
Worse, the Murphys' marriage is so unde
veloped that the viewer wants Diana to ditch
her hubby. She obviously doesn't think she
has much to lose by dogging her husband, if
she's so easily enraptured by Gage's nauseat
ing cliches such as "You want to hate me, but
you can't."
Diana attempts to justify her decision by
saying, "It's just my body. It's not my mind.

It's not my heart." Yet during the three
minute discussion they have about whether
to accept Gage's offer, the word "prostitu
tion" is never mentioned. The film romanti
cizes the concept of the "bought woman,"
which overly fascinates Diana.
This concept only exists to appeal to the
viewer's baser instincts. Floggings for direc
tor Adrian Lyne and twice the floggings for
producer Sherry Lansing and screenwriter
Amy Holden Jones — as women, they
should be more responsible than this.
Lansing, Lyne and Jones don't single out
women — they're equal-opportunity of
fenders, throwing in grossly stereotyped
portrayals of lisping gay men, nerdy mobs of
Japanese tourists and the "no-hablo-ingl£s"
hotel maid.
Lyne describes the "Indecent Proposal" as
"provocative" while Jones claims it's about
"real-world relationships." My, what a sim
ple breed these moviemakers are.

A Far Off Place

While Walt Disney movies haven't kept
pace with the PC movement, the makers of
"A Far Off Place" have tried to; they've
rewritten for a woman one of the male
leads from Laurens van der Post's original
novel.
"A Far Off Place" tells the story of 14-
year-old Nonnie Parker, who is thrown to
gether with city boy Harry Winslow when
both are orphaned in an assault by poachers.
Joined by Nonnie's wise and courageous
Bushman friend Xhabbo, the two set out to
trek 1,000 miles across the Kalahari desert to
escape the bad guys.
The film exposes viewers to the dying
Bushman culture and takes an anti-poach
ing stance. Director Mikael Salomon even
constructed a herd of life-sized latex ele
phants to avoid hurting real ones in a grisly
slaughter.
But despite the filmmakers efforts to give
"A Far Off Place" a veneer of social aware
ness, the movie still displays the less-than
enlightened assumptions about race and
gender that characterize most Disney pro
ductions.
The heroes are all white, and the African
characters in the film are either evil poach
ers, servants, or savages. Xhabbo is a sympa
thetic and semi-heroic Bushman, but he's
more of a companion, wise man and mystic
than a participant in the action.
Despite these shortcomings, the film
does have its redeeming qualities, most no
tably its spectacular cinematography.
Filmed in the Namib desert, Salamon packs
the movie with breathtaking scenery and
wildlife.
Reese Witherspoon also gives a energetic
performance as Nonnie, the spunky girl
who-would-be-a-boy, almost making up
for Ethan Randall s blatant lack of acting
ability.
Best of all, "A Far Off Place" does not fail
to deliver large servings of warm fuzziness.
Anything less wouldn't be Disney.
