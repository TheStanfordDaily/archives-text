Rhymes with the
appeal of a whip
held by De Sade

Leonard Cohen

Bccausc it takes Leonard Cohen four or
five years to finish an album, each one seems
like a comeback.
"The Future" builds materially and stylis
tically on his 1988 album, "I'm Your Man,"
without being a rehash at all.
For people who only know Cohen's early
work, the style will come as a surprise. Gone
is the lone balladeer/guitarist, in favor of a
larger sound, with moderately elaborate

string and percussion arrangements built
around Cohen's keyboards.
He's been using these instruments for over
a decade, and on this album he makes it
work. His voice, too, has transformed over
the years, becoming deeper, often rough and
filled with menace.
Menace plays a key role in two songs, the
title track and "Democracy," which build on
the apocalyptic visions in "I'm Your Man."
He brandishes a whip against the guilty con
science of a nation, delivering lines like "Give
me crack and anal sex/Take the only tree
that's left/and stuff it up the hole/in your cul
ture" with a torturer's subtle satisfaction.
With these songs, Cohen welcomes us back
into his den of torment and despair, but of
fers a chance for hope.
As "Waiting for the Miracle" unfolds, the
hope lies in accepting chaos. Here, the voice
takes on compassion beside an ominous

baseline, as Cohen makes an unprecedented
proposal: "Baby, let's get married/we've been
alone too long/Lets be alone together/Let's
see if we're that strong."
This isn't the only surprise on the album
for those familiar with his work. He also in
cludes two covers and an instrumental.
Frederick Knight's "Be For Real," done as a
slow, sensitive ballad, fits nicely into Cohen's
lexicon, although it is new to hear him say, "I
don't want to be hurt by love again."
It wouldn't have worked on "Songs of
Love and Hate," but it works on "The Fu
ture," echoing the sentiments in "Waiting for
the Miracle." Cohen's addendum to the
song, "I don't give a damn about the truth,
baby/except for the naked truth," helps to
make the song his own. He also offers his
own prelude to Irving Berlin's "Always,"
which begins as a simple blues melody and
evolves over its eight-minute length into a
full-blown band ballad.
"Closing Time" and "Anthem" reflect
most strongly Cohen's past work. The for
mer is a raucous ode to desire and intoxica
tion, while the latter can stand among his
most touching songs, and is the definitive
statement of acceptance on the album.
Having made a career of reveling in the
melee, on "The Future" Leonard Cohen is
bolder than ever about his willingness to
embroil himself within it.

Obsessions with
'60s prove funky
enough for '90s

Lenny Kravitz

Multifarious doesn't begin to describe
Lenny Kravitz's latest musical offering, "Are
You Gonna Go My Way." But you've got to
start somewhere.
The album, which leans haughtily on the
corner of '60s psychedelia and '70s soul, in
vokes everyone from Led Zeppelin to the Isley
Brothers, producing a sound that convinc
ingly alternates between the familiar and
brand new.
"Are You Gonna Go My Way" elevates the
retro-sound of Kravitz's first records ("Let
Love Rule" and "Mama Said") to a higher,
and occasionally grungier level.
The title track — a generous helping of
scratchy Hendrix-inspired guitar riffs,
smothered over a fuzzy electric bass and
drum accompaniment — sets the ideal tone;
as the instruments struggle to drown each
other out, Kravitz belts out a volley of pleas
ant-sounding yet ultimately innocuous lyrics.
This packaging convinces you that some
thing truly wonderful is brewing beneath all the
distortion... but only Lenny and company—
guitarist Craig Ross and bass guitarist Tony
Breit—seem to know exactly what that "thing"
is; you've just got to take their word for it.
Fortunately the tune's limiting sound
doesn't hog-tie its sister tracks. They're per
fectly able to sink or swim on their own merit.
The fact that Kravitz's adoration for the clas
sic styles he champions is much too intense
goes without saying. As his high production
values suggest, he takes his homage very seri
ously, and hopes his listeners follow suit.
And with tunes like "Come On And Love
Me" and "Is There Any Love In Your Heart,"
it's difficult to imagine why anyone would
consider doing any less. The first of these
brisk numbers runs the alto voice of a rigid
lead guitar in front of a husky bass riff that
trots up and down the instrument's strings in
triplets — as a torn torn, bass drum and high
hat jockey for positions of prominence with
in the rhythm section.
The groove, which achieves a sort of cere
bral antsiness, feels like the album's best ...
until "Is There Any Love In Your Heart,"
drops three songs later. Kravitz creates a com
plicated musical environment, where the bass
must pick its way through an impulsive per
cussive bombardment that threatens to shake
the arrangement apart, even as it pieces to
gether the rhythmical playground where the

lead and secondary guitars engage in a frolic
some dance of improvisation.
The album's diversity continues to astound
as Kravitz dabbles in everything from psyche
delic excursions ("Black Girl" and "My Love")
to made-for-adult-radio ballads ("Sugar" and
"Heaven Help") to classical Bob Marleyian
reggae ("Eleutheria"), without ever misplac
ing his distinct musical sensibilities.
No matter who he patterns his arrange
ments after, or how he chooses to do it, when
the smoke clears, the end product is always
unmistakably and entertainingly Lenny.

Sting goes Garth
to tell one off ten
tales on new disc

Sting

With "Ten Summoner's Tales", Gordon
Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, seems to have found a
style in which to spend the rest of his artistic
life. The photographs on the case and insert
show Sting dressed as a medieval-style bard
with a mandolin and horse in the courtyard
of a castle. It hints at what the album con
tains, a look into the past.
"Ten Summoner's Tales" synthesizes his
last three solo albums, "The Soul Cages,"

.. Nothing Like The Sun" and "Bring on
the Night" into a reflective, jazz/new-age
style. Some of the tracks even contain
melodic lines and instrumentals lifted
straight from songs on his other albums.
One of the best of his jazz-influenced
tracks is the current single, "If I Ever Lose My
Faith In You." It has a higher level of energy
than most of the songs on the album and
would have fit in perfectly on "Soul Cages,"
as would "Sha ?e Of My Heart" and "Some
thing the Boy Said."
The best song on the album, "It's Probably
Me" fits more closely with "... Nothing Like
The Sun," a jazzy, mellow album with
poignant lyrics. This track has the dark, open
and moody sound — emphasized by the use
of a muted trumpet in the background — of
wandering the streets of the big city at night.
The two songs with the most energy both
possess the fast-paced jazz sound of "Bring
on the Night." One, "St. Augustine in Hell,"
is a duet of the mellow Sting of "Soul Cages"
and the angst-ridden Sting of the "Syn
chronicity" album.
The only track that approaches a true de
parture from past Sting is also the worst:
"Love is Stronger than Justice," a Sting ex
periment with Country & Western. The cho
rus, filled with a twangy guitar and simple
lyrics, sounds more like a joke than a serious
piece of music. But then, maybe it is.
Sting fills "Ten Summoner's Tales" with
some very good music, but suffers from the
same problem as much of his past work:

repetitiveness. In nearly all of the songs the
verses are interchangeable, because none
contain variation or progression.
Still, Sting's lyrics, which range in mood
from laughter to love-ridden angst, are
damned good. Get thee to a record store and
summon these tales now.

Kansas, llltown &
Oakland provide
new hip-hop cuts

SNIPPETS

BASEHEAD: "Not in Kansas Anymore"
Michael Ivey of Basehead fears that fans of
his first album may be "a little put off" by the
follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut,
"Play With Toys."
In his ambitious sophomore effort, "Not
In Kansas Anymore", Ivey attacks more polit
ical problems and offers deeper solutions.
While the content of his music has
evolved, his production and style have not.
Mellow, often droning lyrics glide over
thumping drum beats and live instruments,
conveying the same post-party, blunted
feel. If you liked Basehead's first release or
dig alternative, check out this one. But reg
ular hip-hop fans like myself will hate it.

NAUGHTY BY NATURE:" 19NaughtylH"
Hip Hop Hooray for Naughty by Nature's
follow up release. They take what worked on
the first album and sprinkle in some novel
ty to release a satisfying album.
Surprisingly, "19NaughtyIH" has a no
ticeably different feel than the first album.
Obviously the phenomenal pop success of
"0.P.P." has Treach and company shouting
some cheesy choruses (e.g. "Heeey, Hooo,
Heeey, Hooo ...") As soon as you look past
this, though, the album will certainly grow
on you, as Treach continues his mastery of
rhyming and alliteration. Vinnie, scattered
sparsely in the first album, showcases some
rhyming talent of his own, flowing on track
after funky track. Check it out.

TUPAC "Strictly 4 my Niggaz"
Erstwhile member of Oakland's Digital
Underground and full-time actor Tupac
("Juice"), must have known how terrible his
last album was. He uses almost every trick in
the business to come up with a slamming
follow-up, "Strictly 4 My Niggaz."
Although his last album "2pacalypse
Now" demonstrated his rhyming gift,
sophomoric production left it an übiquitous
inhabitant of used-record stores. This time,
T\ipac uses a crew of producers, and every
one of them is on.
The album evades the monotony that
can accompany a solo effort. He uses the art
of guest rappers; Ice Cube and Ice T team up
on "Last Wordz" while Treach and Apache
give Tupac a hand on "5 Deadly Venomz."
His old pals from Digital Underground join
him on a vintage D. U. track, "I Get
Around." He even shows a soft side on a
couple of tracks. I highly recommend you
give it a spin.

Surprisingly, "19NaughtyIH" has a no

Obviously the phenomenal pop success of
"0.P.P." has Treach and company shouting
some cheesy choruses (e.g. "Heeey, Hooo,
Heeey, Hooo ...") As soon as you look past
this, though, the album will certainly grow
on you, as Treach continues his mastery of
rhyming and alliteration. Vinnie, scattered

TUPAC "Strictly 4 my Niggaz"
Erstwhile member of Oakland's Digital
Underground and full-time actor Tupac
("Juice"), must have known how terrible his
last album was. He uses almost every trick in
the business to come up with a slamming
follow-up, "Strictly 4 My Niggaz."
Although his last album "2pacalypse
Now" demonstrated his rhyming gift,
sophomoric production left it an übiquitous
inhabitant of used-record stores. This time,
T\ipac uses a crew of producers, and every
one of them is on.
The album evades the monotony that
can accompany a solo effort. He uses the art
of guest rappers; Ice Cube and Ice T team up
on "Last Wordz" while Treach and Apache
give Tupac a hand on "5 Deadly Venomz."
His old pals from Digital Underground join
him on a vintage D. U. track, "I Get
Around." He even shows a soft side on a
couple of tracks. I highly recommend you
give it a spin.

Leonard Cohen

Bccausc it takes Leonard Cohen four or
five years to finish an album, each one seems
like a comeback.
"The Future" builds materially and stylis
tically on his 1988 album, "I'm Your Man,"
without being a rehash at all.
For people who only know Cohen's early
work, the style will come as a surprise. Gone
is the lone balladeer/guitarist, in favor of a
larger sound, with moderately elaborate

string and percussion arrangements built
around Cohen's keyboards.
He's been using these instruments for over
a decade, and on this album he makes it
work. His voice, too, has transformed over
the years, becoming deeper, often rough and
filled with menace.
Menace plays a key role in two songs, the
title track and "Democracy," which build on
the apocalyptic visions in "I'm Your Man."
He brandishes a whip against the guilty con
science of a nation, delivering lines like "Give
me crack and anal sex/Take the only tree
that's left/and stuff it up the hole/in your cul
ture" with a torturer's subtle satisfaction.
With these songs, Cohen welcomes us back
into his den of torment and despair, but of
fers a chance for hope.
As "Waiting for the Miracle" unfolds, the
hope lies in accepting chaos. Here, the voice
takes on compassion beside an ominous

baseline, as Cohen makes an unprecedented
proposal: "Baby, let's get married/we've been
alone too long/Lets be alone together/Let's
see if we're that strong."
This isn't the only surprise on the album
for those familiar with his work. He also in
cludes two covers and an instrumental.
Frederick Knight's "Be For Real," done as a
slow, sensitive ballad, fits nicely into Cohen's
lexicon, although it is new to hear him say, "I
don't want to be hurt by love again."
It wouldn't have worked on "Songs of
Love and Hate," but it works on "The Fu
ture," echoing the sentiments in "Waiting for
the Miracle." Cohen's addendum to the
song, "I don't give a damn about the truth,
baby/except for the naked truth," helps to
make the song his own. He also offers his
own prelude to Irving Berlin's "Always,"
which begins as a simple blues melody and
evolves over its eight-minute length into a
full-blown band ballad.
"Closing Time" and "Anthem" reflect
most strongly Cohen's past work. The for
mer is a raucous ode to desire and intoxica
tion, while the latter can stand among his
most touching songs, and is the definitive
statement of acceptance on the album.
Having made a career of reveling in the
melee, on "The Future" Leonard Cohen is
bolder than ever about his willingness to
embroil himself within it.

Obsessions with
'60s prove funky
enough for '90s

Lenny Kravitz

Multifarious doesn't begin to describe
Lenny Kravitz's latest musical offering, "Are
You Gonna Go My Way." But you've got to
start somewhere.
The album, which leans haughtily on the
corner of '60s psychedelia and '70s soul, in
vokes everyone from Led Zeppelin to the Isley
Brothers, producing a sound that convinc
ingly alternates between the familiar and
brand new.
"Are You Gonna Go My Way" elevates the
retro-sound of Kravitz's first records ("Let
Love Rule" and "Mama Said") to a higher,
and occasionally grungier level.
The title track — a generous helping of
scratchy Hendrix-inspired guitar riffs,
smothered over a fuzzy electric bass and
drum accompaniment — sets the ideal tone;
as the instruments struggle to drown each
other out, Kravitz belts out a volley of pleas
ant-sounding yet ultimately innocuous lyrics.
This packaging convinces you that some
thing truly wonderful is brewing beneath all the
distortion... but only Lenny and company—
guitarist Craig Ross and bass guitarist Tony
Breit—seem to know exactly what that "thing"
is; you've just got to take their word for it.
Fortunately the tune's limiting sound
doesn't hog-tie its sister tracks. They're per
fectly able to sink or swim on their own merit.
The fact that Kravitz's adoration for the clas
sic styles he champions is much too intense
goes without saying. As his high production
values suggest, he takes his homage very seri
ously, and hopes his listeners follow suit.
And with tunes like "Come On And Love
Me" and "Is There Any Love In Your Heart,"
it's difficult to imagine why anyone would
consider doing any less. The first of these
brisk numbers runs the alto voice of a rigid
lead guitar in front of a husky bass riff that
trots up and down the instrument's strings in
triplets — as a torn torn, bass drum and high
hat jockey for positions of prominence with
in the rhythm section.
The groove, which achieves a sort of cere
bral antsiness, feels like the album's best ...
until "Is There Any Love In Your Heart,"
drops three songs later. Kravitz creates a com
plicated musical environment, where the bass
must pick its way through an impulsive per
cussive bombardment that threatens to shake
the arrangement apart, even as it pieces to
gether the rhythmical playground where the

lead and secondary guitars engage in a frolic
some dance of improvisation.
The album's diversity continues to astound
as Kravitz dabbles in everything from psyche
delic excursions ("Black Girl" and "My Love")
to made-for-adult-radio ballads ("Sugar" and
"Heaven Help") to classical Bob Marleyian
reggae ("Eleutheria"), without ever misplac
ing his distinct musical sensibilities.
No matter who he patterns his arrange
ments after, or how he chooses to do it, when
the smoke clears, the end product is always
unmistakably and entertainingly Lenny.

Sting goes Garth
to tell one off ten
tales on new disc

Sting

With "Ten Summoner's Tales", Gordon
Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, seems to have found a
style in which to spend the rest of his artistic
life. The photographs on the case and insert
show Sting dressed as a medieval-style bard
with a mandolin and horse in the courtyard
of a castle. It hints at what the album con
tains, a look into the past.
"Ten Summoner's Tales" synthesizes his
last three solo albums, "The Soul Cages,"

.. Nothing Like The Sun" and "Bring on
the Night" into a reflective, jazz/new-age
style. Some of the tracks even contain
melodic lines and instrumentals lifted
straight from songs on his other albums.
One of the best of his jazz-influenced
tracks is the current single, "If I Ever Lose My
Faith In You." It has a higher level of energy
than most of the songs on the album and
would have fit in perfectly on "Soul Cages,"
as would "Sha ?e Of My Heart" and "Some
thing the Boy Said."
The best song on the album, "It's Probably
Me" fits more closely with "... Nothing Like
The Sun," a jazzy, mellow album with
poignant lyrics. This track has the dark, open
and moody sound — emphasized by the use
of a muted trumpet in the background — of
wandering the streets of the big city at night.
The two songs with the most energy both
possess the fast-paced jazz sound of "Bring
on the Night." One, "St. Augustine in Hell,"
is a duet of the mellow Sting of "Soul Cages"
and the angst-ridden Sting of the "Syn
chronicity" album.
The only track that approaches a true de
parture from past Sting is also the worst:
"Love is Stronger than Justice," a Sting ex
periment with Country & Western. The cho
rus, filled with a twangy guitar and simple
lyrics, sounds more like a joke than a serious
piece of music. But then, maybe it is.
Sting fills "Ten Summoner's Tales" with
some very good music, but suffers from the
same problem as much of his past work:

repetitiveness. In nearly all of the songs the
verses are interchangeable, because none
contain variation or progression.
Still, Sting's lyrics, which range in mood
from laughter to love-ridden angst, are
damned good. Get thee to a record store and
summon these tales now.

SNIPPETS

BASEHEAD: "Not in Kansas Anymore"
Michael Ivey of Basehead fears that fans of
his first album may be "a little put off" by the
follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut,
"Play With Toys."
In his ambitious sophomore effort, "Not
In Kansas Anymore", Ivey attacks more polit
ical problems and offers deeper solutions.
While the content of his music has
evolved, his production and style have not.
Mellow, often droning lyrics glide over
thumping drum beats and live instruments,
conveying the same post-party, blunted
feel. If you liked Basehead's first release or
dig alternative, check out this one. But reg
ular hip-hop fans like myself will hate it.

The only track that approaches a true de
parture from past Sting is also the worst:
"Love is Stronger than Justice," a Sting ex
periment with Country & Western. The cho
rus, filled with a twangy guitar and simple
lyrics, sounds more like a joke than a serious
piece of music. But then, maybe it is.
Sting fills "Ten Summoner's Tales" with
some very good music, but suffers from the
same problem as much of his past work:

repetitiveness. In nearly all of the songs the
verses are interchangeable, because none
contain variation or progression.
Still, Sting's lyrics, which range in mood
from laughter to love-ridden angst, are
damned good. Get thee to a record store and
summon these tales now.

SNIPPETS

BASEHEAD: "Not in Kansas Anymore"
Michael Ivey of Basehead fears that fans of
his first album may be "a little put off" by the
follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut,
"Play With Toys."
In his ambitious sophomore effort, "Not
In Kansas Anymore", Ivey attacks more polit
ical problems and offers deeper solutions.
While the content of his music has
evolved, his production and style have not.
Mellow, often droning lyrics glide over
thumping drum beats and live instruments,
conveying the same post-party, blunted
feel. If you liked Basehead's first release or
dig alternative, check out this one. But reg
ular hip-hop fans like myself will hate it.

NAUGHTY BY NATURE:" 19NaughtylH"
Hip Hop Hooray for Naughty by Nature's
follow up release. They take what worked on
the first album and sprinkle in some novel
ty to release a satisfying album.
Surprisingly, "19NaughtyIH" has a no
ticeably different feel than the first album.
Obviously the phenomenal pop success of
"0.P.P." has Treach and company shouting
some cheesy choruses (e.g. "Heeey, Hooo,
Heeey, Hooo ...") As soon as you look past
this, though, the album will certainly grow
on you, as Treach continues his mastery of
rhyming and alliteration. Vinnie, scattered
sparsely in the first album, showcases some
rhyming talent of his own, flowing on track
after funky track. Check it out.

TUPAC "Strictly 4 my Niggaz"
Erstwhile member of Oakland's Digital
Underground and full-time actor Tupac
("Juice"), must have known how terrible his
last album was. He uses almost every trick in
the business to come up with a slamming
follow-up, "Strictly 4 My Niggaz."
Although his last album "2pacalypse
Now" demonstrated his rhyming gift,
sophomoric production left it an übiquitous
inhabitant of used-record stores. This time,
T\ipac uses a crew of producers, and every
one of them is on.
The album evades the monotony that
can accompany a solo effort. He uses the art
of guest rappers; Ice Cube and Ice T team up
on "Last Wordz" while Treach and Apache
give Tupac a hand on "5 Deadly Venomz."
His old pals from Digital Underground join
him on a vintage D. U. track, "I Get
Around." He even shows a soft side on a
couple of tracks. I highly recommend you
give it a spin.
