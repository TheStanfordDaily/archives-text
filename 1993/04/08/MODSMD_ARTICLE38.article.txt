Rhymes with the
appeal of a whip
held by De Sade

Leonard Cohen

Bccausc it takes Leonard Cohen four or
five years to finish an album, each one seems
like a comeback.
"The Future" builds materially and stylis
tically on his 1988 album, "I'm Your Man,"
without being a rehash at all.
For people who only know Cohen's early
work, the style will come as a surprise. Gone
is the lone balladeer/guitarist, in favor of a
larger sound, with moderately elaborate

string and percussion arrangements built
around Cohen's keyboards.
He's been using these instruments for over
a decade, and on this album he makes it
work. His voice, too, has transformed over
the years, becoming deeper, often rough and
filled with menace.
Menace plays a key role in two songs, the
title track and "Democracy," which build on
the apocalyptic visions in "I'm Your Man."
He brandishes a whip against the guilty con
science of a nation, delivering lines like "Give
me crack and anal sex/Take the only tree
that's left/and stuff it up the hole/in your cul
ture" with a torturer's subtle satisfaction.
With these songs, Cohen welcomes us back
into his den of torment and despair, but of
fers a chance for hope.
As "Waiting for the Miracle" unfolds, the
hope lies in accepting chaos. Here, the voice
takes on compassion beside an ominous

baseline, as Cohen makes an unprecedented
proposal: "Baby, let's get married/we've been
alone too long/Lets be alone together/Let's
see if we're that strong."
This isn't the only surprise on the album
for those familiar with his work. He also in
cludes two covers and an instrumental.
Frederick Knight's "Be For Real," done as a
slow, sensitive ballad, fits nicely into Cohen's
lexicon, although it is new to hear him say, "I
don't want to be hurt by love again."
It wouldn't have worked on "Songs of
Love and Hate," but it works on "The Fu
ture," echoing the sentiments in "Waiting for
the Miracle." Cohen's addendum to the
song, "I don't give a damn about the truth,
baby/except for the naked truth," helps to
make the song his own. He also offers his
own prelude to Irving Berlin's "Always,"
