# MLK the MAN

Most people know Martin Luther King,
Jr., the civil-rights figure. Many have
even heard his "I have a dream"
speech and have taken the day off to celebrate
his birthday.
But Martin Luther King, Jr., the person, is
not as well known or understood. His rela
tionship with family, as well as his background
as a minister in the black church, are not stud
ied as thoroughly as the protests he led.
Twenty-five years after his death, History
Prof. Clayborne Carson has written "Pas
sages of Martin Luther King," a docudrama
reconstructing the life of the civil-rights
leader through King's own words, thoughts
and feelings — as well as those of the people
important to him.
Based on documentation from the Martin
Luther King Papers Project, headed by Car
son, the story uses dialogue recreated from
the papers, as well as protest and gospel
music, along with film and sound recordings
from King's lifetime.
"King is not a very new person in Ameri
ca. He is an icon, a holiday," Carson said.
"The challenge is not to have an icon, but a

person on the stage interacting with other
people. I think I will have succeeded if a
member of the audience leaves thinking of
King as a person and not as an icon.
"There is a danger that commemoration
of Martin Luther King becomes dry and per
functory and boring," he explained. "The
challenge now is for people who want to keep
the King legacy alive to infuse that legacy
with creative imagination so that King re
mains real and always contemporary, rather
than a textbook historical figure."
Format makes the docudrama a unique
exercise in history, combining media clips
and photos with reenacted dialogue. Direc
tor Victor Walker said, "We knew it would be
a difficult task maintaining the historical
continuity and adding drama.
"I didn't want to recreate, but to capture the
essence of those people on stage both as lead
ers and as individual, ordinary people," con
tinued Walker, a James Irvine Fellow and an
acting assistant professor of American Theater
in the Drama Department. "All the actors just
brought a lot of humanity to their parts."
To bring King to life, "Passages" focuses
on his relationships with members of
his family, including his wife, mother
and most importantly his father, Martin
Luther King, Sr. (also called "Daddy" King).
The play highlights Daddy Kings' positions
as a role model, both as a parent and as a Bap
tist minister.
In one scene, Daddy King (Anthony J.
Haney) talks about his need to discipline his
sons and steer them into the ministry, while
in another King (Floyd Thompkins) remi
nisces about spending his childhood listen
ing to his father's preaching.
Walker said he did not know a lot about
Daddy King before his collaboration with Car
son. "One of the characters we developed was
Daddy King. The title is 'Passages of Martin
Luther King' — not senior or junior. The first

act deals mostly with Martin Luther King, Sr.
"Where Martin developed his ideas and
gained his strength, a lot of that came from
his mother and father," he continued.
Carson emphasized that the relationship
between the civil-rights leader and his father
framed the documentary. "The original con
ception was that the play was not just going to
be about King, but about Daddy King and the
family and his relationship with others, in
cluding Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X,"
he explained.
"Passages" also highlights King's role as a
minister, including excerpts from some of his
and his father's sermons and a choir singing the

not as an icon.'

religious and the protest songs. "I know that
deep down inside, he considered himself first
and foremost a Baptist minister, modeled
after his father," explained Carson.
Casting Rev. Floyd Thompkins as King
also places emphasis on his role as a spiritual
leader. Thompkins, who serves as associate
dean of Memorial Church, had never acted
prior to "Passages," but has preached since
the age of eight.
"It was Rev. Thompkins' natural oratory
skills that led me to cast him as Martin," said
Walker, pointing out that although he had
four professional actors audition for the part,
he felt that Thompkins' speaking ability was
necessary to do the role justice. Still, he says,
"We spent a lot of time working on Martin
the man, not on Martin the orator or Martin
the civil-rights leader."

Thompkins is not the only cast member
who had never acted before. Barbara Smith,
acting director of the Black Community Ser
vices Center, debuts as Alberta "Bunch"
King, Martin Luther King's mother, and
Thom Massey, Student Affairs Officer in the
Humanities and Sciences Deans Office, steps
on his first stage as Malcolm X.
But in addition to amateur actors, profes
sional actors, including Haney (Daddy
King), and Stanford students play many
roles. In the end, the characters work well to
gether, and it is difficult to tell who is amateur
and who professional.
"There's no real distinction in my mind
because the cast has really melted into one
group," explained senior John Livingston,
who plays a white critic of King. "Until I saw
the program [Friday night], I really didn't
know who was who."
Carson said he felt that each of the actors
had made their role their own. "It's hard for
me to visualize other actors in the roles," he
said. "After seeing Tony Haney's Daddy King,
it will be hard for me to go back and revise the
script without thinking of him. All of them
have put their stamp on these roles."
For the actors as well as the audience, this
project is an educational experience.
"When you're learning about King,
there are just some missing elements," ex
plained William Franklin, Jr., a graduate stu
dent in education who plays student civil
rights leader Stokely Carmichael. "I had never
known so much about King's parents. All of
these little caveats we were learning because of
the papers project were overwhelming.
"The words, even though they are 25-
years-old, are still poignant and still neces
sary," he continued, explaining that he had
decided to audition for the docudrama
shortly after the death of Supreme Court Jus
tice Thurgood Marshall.
Livingston said he was unfamiliar with
King's life before becoming involved in "Pas
sages." "The passion of King's commitment
comes through in the play," he said. "To see
someone who is that committed to anything
affects you." ■
