# Smoke detectors to be installed in dorm rooms
## Will bring University into compliance with county ordinance, improve safety 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
In an attempt to both improve student
safety and comply with a county ordi
nance, the University is installing smoke
detectors in many undergraduate dormito
ry rooms.
The renovation is mandated by a Santa
Clara County code that requires dormitory
rooms to have individual smoke detectors,
according to Rodger Whitney, associate di
rector for student housing operations.
In addition, recent fires in student rooms
at UC-Berkeley and San Jose State have
sparked concerns about safety at Stanford.
"Frankly, safety considerations have
caused everyone to be particularly cog
nizant of student living spaces," Whitney
said.
The renovation is being done in older un

dergraduate residences that were built be
fore the existing county fire code was enact
ed. Newer houses like Kimball Hall, Lan
tana and Castaiio already have in-room
smoke detectors. Smoke detectors are not
required in graduate student housing be
cause the regulation does not cover apart
ments.
The alarms, which will be mounted on
the wall within a foot of the ceiling, will not
hooked up to existing fire-detection sys
tems in dorms that are connected to the
fire department. They serve only to alert
the individual of a fire in that particular
room.
"Their purpose is to wake up the individ
ual so he can get out. It's up to him to pull
the nearest fire alarm" to alert the rest of
the building, said campus fire marshal Ray
Gamma.
According to Gamma, the University did

not take the extra step to connect the smoke
detectors to the central building system be
cause it is not required in the county ordi
nance.
"This is how the county ordinance for ex
isting facilities reads — it's very specific,"
said Gamma.
In addition, Gamma said, connected sys
tems can be more trouble than they are
worth. For example, in Governor's Corner,

where the individual smoke detectors are
connected, the system is prone to false
alarms.
Cost is also an issue, said Whitney. "It's
easier to do it locally, and its less expen
sive."
Alarm installation in all undergraduate
rooms will cost between $750,000 and $1
million, according to Whitney. The money
comes from a special account — funded by
student room fees — earmarked for major
repairs.
The renovation is being done in two
stages. The first stage, which has already
begun and will be completed by June 15, is
the installation of smoke detectors in all
residences that will be occupied over the
summer.
The second stage will take place over the
summer and involve residences that will be
unoccupied during summer quarter.
