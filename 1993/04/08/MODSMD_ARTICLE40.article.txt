■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's
got America abuzz? Well you won't
find out, unless you see writer-di
rector Neil Jordan's offbeat hit.
Stephen Rea, Forest Whitaker and
newcomer Jaye Davidson are at
the top of their game in this brilliant
web of love and intrigue involving
the IRA, a British soldier and an
enigmatic hairdresser. Shades of
"Vertigo," it's a definite must-see.
R
■ Ethan Frome
Last year's hot dead author was
E.M. Forster; this year, it's Edith
Wharton. John Madden's adapta
tion turns a blatantly melodramatic
plot into a sensitive work of art.
Actor Liam Neeson ("Husbands
and Wives") brilliantly imparts
Ethan's vulnerability and good
heartedness without resorting to
the standard silences of most male
leads. And the film's tragic ending
will chill you like the New England
winter of the story's setting R
Falling Down
Michael Douglas plays a laid-off
defense worker who loses it while
trapped in an L.A. traffic jam. On
his way home, he leaves a trail of
trashed Korean grocery stores,
dead Latino gangbangers and ter
rified fast-food employees in his
wake. So why's it so bad? Because
the writer and director think terror
izing Koreans and shooting help
less Latinos is funny Rent "The
Terminator" instead. R
■ Like Water For Chocolate
In Mexico, hot chocolate is pre
pared by adding cocoa to boiling

water. So when a person is sexual
ly aroused, they are termed "like
water for chocolate." The youngest
daughter of a ranching family is
forced to stay at home with her
mother, despite the attentions of a
virile suitor. But her passion can't
be contained, as she releases it in
the food that she painstakingly
prepares. A delectable banquet of
love, magic and food served up by
Mexican director Alfonso Arau. Not
Rated
Mad Dog and Glory
It could have been a contender;
Produced by Martin Scorsese, writ
ten by Richard Price ("Sea of
Love,") and directed by John Mc-
Naughton ("Henry: Portrait of a Se
rial Killer"). But the high-concept
plot of a gangster (Bill Murray) giv
ing a sad lieutenant (Robert
DeNiro) the company of a female
bartender (Uma Thurman) for a
week doesn't have enough char
acter development to make it work.
Still, it boasts the most brutally
honest sex scene since Almod
ovar's "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down."
R
Point of No Return
Violent action-thriller about a wild
child turned government-trained
assassin. Single white actress
Bridget Fonda tries gamely, but
she's no match for actress Anne
Parillaud, who starred in the origi
nal French film "La Femme Nikita."
She's not alone; her co-stars, the
director, the cinematographer and
the composer don't measure up ei
ther. A pointless remake. R
