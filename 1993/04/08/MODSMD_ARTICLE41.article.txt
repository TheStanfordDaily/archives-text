When we were children, we thought as children, and
watched cartoons. Even though we've all grown up,
animated films still reduce the most cynical of us to sappy, ef
fusive praise. So for those who can't put away childish things,
here's a sampler of animation achievements.
Even an avowed Disneyphobe like myself had to admit
that Beauty and the Beast was a minor classic. Classical
and computer-generated animation lifted this archetypal
fable beyond anything the studio had ever done. As long as
you don't let that drivel about "feminist heroine" fool you
— 1 don't know many feminists whose reading lists consist
solely of fairy tales — it's a breathtaking piece of work.
The Hudlin brothers, who brought us House Party
and Boomerang, produced Bebe's Kids. Based on a
series of skits by the late comic Robin Harris, the film fea
tures a group of unruly children raised by Bebe, a single
mother. When one of Bebe's friends takes the kids with her
on a date to an amusement park, all hell breaks loose.
Worth a look.
While US animators (read: Disney) haven't exploited the
possibilities of animation aimed at adults, their more imag
inative Japanese counterparts are filling the gap. Akira
stands out as a Japanimation classic — a twisted vision of
Neo-Tokyo, overrun by gangs and defended by a corrupt
military plotting to control the paranormal powers of
Akira. Though not as technically proficient as Disney's best
work, it possesses a vision Disney could only dream of.
Once Who Framed Roger Rabbit showed the po
tential of mixing live actors with animated characters, it
was only a matter of time before someone asked, "What if
a human had sex with a cartoon?" Bad boy director Ralph
Bakshi of Fritz the Cat fame promised an answer with
Cool World. But Brad Pitt and Gabriel Byrne couldn't
overcome Bakshi's poor production values and Kim
Basinger's atrocious performance. Rent in the middle of
the week. ■
