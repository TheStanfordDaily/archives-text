The last word 0n...

Brandon Lee didn't want to be remem
bered as the son of Bruce Lee.
In fact, he spent his entire life trying to
avoid being known as "the son of Bruce Lee,"
and spent most of his early childhood avoid
ing Kung Fu altogether, because he didn't
want to be like his father.
Yet even now that he has died, the media is
filled with many comparisons between Bran
don and his dad.

Modernism...

To compare most drama to Pirandello would be
like comparing El Camino to The Haight.
Modernism at it's finest, two of Pirandello's plays,
"Chee-Chee" and"The Man with the Flower in his
Mouth," will be performed today through Saturday in
the Nitery at Old Union.
Known for "Six Authors in Search of an Author,"
Pirandello influenced such greats as Genet and Brecht.
"Man" is a mysterious and enigmatic play about
one man's confrontation with his dark side. In con
trast, "Chee-Chee" is a comedic romp about life, love
and greed.
Directed by Mark Capri, the Pirandello one-acts
will show at 8 p.m. through Saturday, with a 2 p.m.
performance on Sunday. Tickets cost $5 for stu
dents/seniors, $9 general, and are available through
the Tresidder Ticket Office or at the door.

I knew Brandon personally; our mothers
have been best friends since they were 11.
And 1 watched Brandon as he was forced into
roles based on the life of his father.
By playing what media and society expect
ed of "the son of Bruce Lee," Brandon was
never seen as an individual, but always as just
another "kung-fu jock."
After a number of movies, which I feel ex
ploited his ancestry and family background,
it finally seemed like Brandon would gain his
own recognition with "The Crow."

... and serious money

Despite it's name, "Serious Money" is free entertain
ment. Performed outside the Cummings Art Building
at "The Well," "Serious Money" is a not-so-serious
spoof of rampant capitalism.
A satirical murder-mystery, "Serious Money" fea
tures the Red Hoop Players, 12 students taking on more
than 50 different roles in the City of London during the
1980's financial boom.
The Cummings Art Building is located across from
the Quad, adjacent to the Stanford Art Gallery. The
players will share the space with Joan Mir6's sculpture,
Osieaux.

Sadly, Brandon died before this could
happen. And though images of such a young
death are reminiscent of his father, I cannot
and will not see his death as just the death of
"the son of Bruce Lee." I'll always know Bran
don as someone who enjoyed the outdoors,
playing video games on his Apple computer
and who protected his best friend from bul
lies while growing up.
