Who cares?
Andrew Rapp does.
In fact, he cares so much that he won a Na
tional Caring Award.
Rapp, a freshman from Pueblo, Colorado, re
ceived the award for his work in aiding a group
of doctors that traveled across Mexico and the
United States performing cataract surgery on
the poor.
He acted as a Spanish interpreter on the mis
sion, greeting patients and explaining both the
procedure and the necessary follow-up care.
Rapp's goal was to improve communication be
tween doctors and patients.
"Many people who came in had no eyesight,"
Rapp said, "But when they left, they could see."
Cataracts, which cause the eye's lens to be
come less transparent, generally occur in older
people. The surgery is a simple procedure that
can dramatically improve one's sight.
Rapp's high school counselor nominated his
for the award after his extensive public-service
work. The award is presented by the Washing
ton, D.C., based Caring Institute, a group
whose mission is "to bring back the values of
caring and social justice in America."
For five years the institute has been present
ing National Caring Awards to people who do
extraordinary things to help others. The recipi
ents have included business leaders, house
wives, community organizers and wealthy phil
anthropists, among others.
The Young Adult Caring Awards were first
presented in 1990, and Rapp was
a member of the ihird group to
receive such awards.
In high school, Rapp assisted
social service organizations in his
community, emphasizing the
issue of homelessness. A group he
headed gathered donated food for
shelters in an effort to feed the
hungry, he said.
Rapp also volunteered at an
emergency shelter for homeless
men and for a teen suicide pre
vention hot-line.
To accept his award, Rapp was
given an expense-paid trip to
Washington, where he got to meet
other caring award winners, attend
an awards ceremony in the Capitol
and view the opening of the Caring
Institute Museum, which contains
an exhibit on caring award win
ners, including Rapp.
Although his only community
service work at Stanford has been
a writing project for his freshman
English class, Rapp said he would
like to get back to working on
community service issues.
