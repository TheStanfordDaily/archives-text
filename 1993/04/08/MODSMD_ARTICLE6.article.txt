# $3 million annex planned for Terman Center
## Building will house new classrooms, allow programs to expand

Looking for room to grow, the School of Engi
neering will begin construction this summer on a
$3 million multi-purpose annex to the Terman
Engineering Center that will house several new
laboratories and classrooms.
The new building will be located across the
street from the Roble Hall parking lot, next to
Terman Pond and the current engineering build
ing. The complex should be completed by August
or September 1994.
According to Facilities project manager Vojka
Ivanek, the building, named the Charles B.
Thornton Center for Engineering Management,
will be a two-story, 10,762-square-foot annex to
the existing engineering building.
The first floor will consist of two 70-seat
"case-study" classrooms — amphitheater-like
rooms that are better than regular lecture halls
at fostering interaction between students and
professors.
While typical in business and law schools,
case-study classrooms are uncommon in engi
neering buildings. But according to Charles Hol
loway, co-chair of the Stanford Intergrated Man
ufacturing Association, case-study classrooms
"are also important for faculty who teach in
manufacturing."
The building's second floor will house several
laboratories, including the Smart Products De
sign Lab and the Manufacturing Models Lab,
which is currently located in Building 530. The
annex will also have a conference room, several
offices, a library and some work spaces.
According to Timothy Portwood, the School of
Engineering's director of corporate relations, the
new center will not only provide improved class
rooms and lab facilities, but will also allow vari
ous programs within the department to expand.
One of the programs that will grow with the

new building is the manufacturing association, a
10-year-old joint venture between the Graduate
School of Business and the School of Engineer
ing.
The program allows students to earn a mas
ter's in Manufacturing Systems Engineering or a
dual MBA and MSE. According to Portwood, the
program is currently expanding to "meet indus

try demands."
Another program that will benefit from con
struction of the building is the Future Professors
of Manufacturing, which is a year-old doctoral
program that will "create a new cadre of acade
mics" at American universities, Portwood said.
The goal of the program is to produce approxi
mately 50 professors over the next 10 years.
