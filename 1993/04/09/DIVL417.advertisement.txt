The debt is paid
hen Jesus cried out from the cross, "It is
finished!", He used the same term that merchants of
His time used when they marked a bill
"PAID IN FULL'.
Our debt has been paid in full. The price of our sins has been paid. We have been
bought back from slavery to sin and from eternal death by Jesus' death on the
cross. Only the death of the Son of God, who was without sin Himself, could
remove the everlasting punishment which was due us for our disobedience to
God's laws. This is the message of Good Friday, Good because out of Jesus'
suffering and death came our freedom.
We know that our debt has been paid in full because God raised Jesus from the
dead on Easter morning. When we die, we who believe will also be raised to life
again, to eternal life in heaven. There are no "hidden charges" which can separate
us from God's love. The power of the devil has been broken. Even though we
humans continue to sin, when we repent and ask for forgiveness, it is ours.
We want to share this wonderful news with everyone!
We invite you to worship with us on Good Friday at 12:00 noon and 7:30 pm.
We will have an outdoor Easter sunrise service on the church grounds at 6:00
am, as well as our regular schedule of 8:15 and 11:00 am. Sunday School and
Bible Classes for all age groups are at 9:45 am.
