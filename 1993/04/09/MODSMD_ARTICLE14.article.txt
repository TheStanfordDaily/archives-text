Russians clean up radiation
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Hundreds of disaster work
ers cleared snow and built dams in the Siberian
wilderness yesterday in an effort to clean up the
radiation from Russia's worst nuclear accident
since Chernobyl.
Commonwealth Television showed heavy dam
age at the nuclear weapons complex in the secret
city of Tomsk-7, where an underground tank con
taining a poisonous mix of liquid nuclear waste
exploded and burned Tuesday.
The roof and several walls of the complex's plu
tonium-processing facility were destroyed in the
blast, which spewed a radioactive cloud into the
atmosphere.
The Russian Air Defense Command said the
wind was blowing the radioactive cloud northeast,
away from Tomsk-7 and the nearby city of Tomsk.
There were conflicting reports about the extent of
the contamination and the cloud.
