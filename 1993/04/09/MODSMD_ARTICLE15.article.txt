# Clinton releases $1.52 trillion budget for 1994

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton unveiled his $1.52 trillion bud
get yesterday, a blueprint for 1994 that
boosts taxes on the rich and slashes
military spending to break the govern
ment's habit of deficit spending.
The budget puts flesh on the skele
ton plan that Clinton released in
February. The biggest change is that
the amount of deficit reduction — $447
billion over five years — is slightly
lower than what the new president ini
tially announced.
Clinton's budget projects spending
$1.52 trillion for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. That increase — 3.2 per
cent over current spending — essen
tially keeps pace with inflation.
Before he left office, President Bush
put forward a document assuming the
same amount of spending for next
year. But he was prepared to seek
fewer defense cuts, tax increases and

spending boosts than Clinton pro
posed.
Clinton's economic battle plan hews
closely to the philosophy he campaigned
on last year: more money for low
income students and other initiatives to
bolster the economy and create jobs,
and an attack on federal red ink led by
higher taxes on the rich, energy users
and higher- income Social Security
recipients. These changes would still
have to be enacted through legislation.
"The plan flows from the demand of
the American people for change and
my vision of what America can be if we
embark upon an economic strategy of
investing in people and putting people
first," Clinton wrote to Congress.
"It's pretty much what they
promised — more taxes, more spend
ing," said Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
With record speed, majority

Democrats have already whipped a
deficit-reduction outline through
Congress. It closely tracks Clinton's
thinking. Over five years, it would cut
deficit spending by $67 billion more
than the president proposed.
Combined, the two plans would pro
duce $514 billion in budget cuts by
1998, exceeding the nearly $500 billion
that the 1990 budget summit planned
over five years.
The $447 billion in deficit reduc
tions Clinton proposed relies on $296
billion in tax increases, one of the
biggest revenue boosts in history; $108
billion in defense and domestic pro
gram cuts and $43 billion in lowered
interest payments on the national
debt.
To save money, the military would
reduce its active force of nearly 2 mil
lion troops by 108,000. Cuts would be
made in subsidies to farmers, law

enforcement grants to local govern
ments, NASA's efforts to fly to Mars
and Medicare payments to doctors and
hospitals.
But along with these reductions
were spending bonuses for other initia
tives. The Head Start program for pre
school children, federal anti-drug
efforts, road-building and aid to com
munities hurt by military cuts would
all grow.
As a result, Clinton said his budget
would leave a 1994 budget shortfall of
$264 billion, down from an anticipated
$322 billion.
The red ink is expected to drop to
$214 billion in 1997 but balloon again
to $250 billion in 1998 due to the rapid
ly growing costs of Medicare, Medicaid
and other government health-care pro
grams. The administration plans to
complete its package for containing
health care costs next month.
