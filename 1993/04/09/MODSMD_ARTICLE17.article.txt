## Senatorial privilege 
### 
WELL, THE Council of
Presidents and ASSU elec
tions have once again ap
peared on the horizon.
Yippee.
This year, only one non-write-in
slate of candidates is running for
the former position, and only 30
candidates are running for the 40
ASSU Senate seats.
Of these 30 candidates, only six
are graduate students, with no
candidates whatsoever from the
Schools of Law, Business and
Medicine.
Admittedly, graduate students
have a plethora of demands on
their time and efforts. However, at
a time when these students are
growing increasingly vocal con
cerning their rights, needs and
privileges, it is curious to note
their lack of attention to a body
which potentially could be utilized
to address these concerns.

Unfortunately, a majority of
this year's graduate senators have
not performed ably in addressing
these tasks, instead choosing not
to attend potentially vital meet
ings.
The attendance record of the
ASSU senators this year has been
abysmal; five senators from the
Law School were "suspended
indefinitely" by Senate Chair Ron
Brown earlier this year. This inac
tion by the outgoing senators
should, hopefully, have spurred an
increased desire among graduate
students to effect change where
the earlier senators had failed. Yet
this appears not to have been the
case.
Out with the old, in with the
new. Let's hope that what few
graduate-school candidates there
are can once again make the ASSU
Senate an effective lawmaking
body.
