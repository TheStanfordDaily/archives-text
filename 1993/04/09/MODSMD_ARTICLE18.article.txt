# Worthwhile debate
## 
### 
Recently, significant flaws
in the structure of the ASSU
Senate and Council of Presi
dents election have become obvi
ous. The most glaring of these
shortcomings is the lack of debates
among candidates for various
offices.
While there is no shortage of
posters in and around campus,
each proclaiming the virtues of a
particular candidate, students
have almost no way to ask sub
stantive questions of these office
seekers.
Although each candidate travels
from dormitory to dormitory in an
attempt to garner votes and
answer students' questions, no one
person can reach all interested vot
ers. An all-campus open debate
involving COP and ASSU Senate
candidates would ameliorate this
problem.
While a debate would appear to
be less-than-necessary in a year
which features the campaigns of

only one non-write-in COP slate
and only 30 candidates for the 40
senate seats, it would nonetheless
prove helpful in allowing voters to
make their individual choices.
In addition, while there is a
deficit of candidates, there are still
more senate-seekers than voting
seats available. If a debate had
been held, voters would be more
likely to cast informed ballots in
filling these vital positions. In fact,
with so few candidates running, it
is now more important than ever
to elect the most-qualified persons
available for the voting seats, as all
office-seekers are almost guaran
teed a senate seat.
A debate in which senate and
COP candidates would be forced to
articulate their positions on vari
ous issues would also serve to
"weed out" insincere office-seekers
in the event that there are more
candidates than seats available.
After all, you can't learn too
much from a poster.
