Questionnaire 's bias leads to inaccurate survey results

Faculty members have just
received the 1993 C-AAA Survey
on Grading to guide the Commit
tee's recommendations on grading
options. Previous surveys were deemed
inadequate because of a low return rate.
The present survey is unlikely to pro
duce an accurate estimate of faculty opin
ion for other reasons — an obvious bias
in questionnaire construction, the inclu
sion of regressive options only and the
failure to specify the educational goals to
be achieved by the proposed changes.
One thing we know about survey
research: the answers depend in large
part upon the way the questions are
worded. If we want unbiased opinions,
we need to avoid leading questions and
prejudicial language.
Consider, for example, Part C of the
Survey which is headed in big black let
ters: "Grade Inflations and (pass)/NC
grades." The headline itself associates
grade inflation (obviously a bad thing)
with (pass)/NC grades. The three-page
summary of findings accompanying the
survey states that there had been no
grade inflation since the early 19705.
Why then the headline suggesting an
association we need to deal with now?
The first question in Part C has this
preamble: "Independent of whether there
is grade inflation, some are concerned
that the high proportion of 'A' grades
results in decreased utility of the tran-

script and in poorer resolution in differ
entiating between excellent and good per
formance." Note that the statement pre
supposes that the proportion of A grades
is already too high, not too low (respon
dents would have to refer to a second doc
ument to discover the actual figure, 35
percent). The preamble also associates
good grades with bad outcomes.
Having set the stage with a prejudi
cial headline and preamble, the first
question in Part C reads as follows: "Do
you agree that the preponderance of A
grades makes the indication and reward
of truly excellent student performance
difficult?" The phrase "Do you agree"
leads to an affirmative-response set —
of course, most of us want to be seen as
agreeable people. The word "preponder
ance" means an "excess of weight, influ
ence, number, etc." So the question
itself suggests that the number of A
grades is excessive. Finally, the question
presupposes that the only purpose of
grading is to distinguish the truly excel
lent from the merely good. No other pur
poses are stated or implied. Under these
circumstances, we should expect respon
dents to call for fewer A grades.
Suppose we wanted to bias the survey
in the opposite direction. Piece of cake.
The headline: "Enthusiasm for Learning
and 'A' Grades." The preamble: "Some are
concerned that the low proportion of 'A'
grades results in Stanford graduates

whose enthusiasm for new learning is
diminished and who lack confidence in
their own ability to compete successfully."
The question: "Doesn't it seem obvious to
you that the scarcity of A grades reduces
the motivation for new learning and low
ers self-confidence?" Now we would expect
respondents to call for more A grades.
An unbiased questionnaire would
have no headline and no one-sided
preamble. A possible question might
read: "What effects would you predict if
Stanford faculty awarded a greater per
centage of A grades?"
All the options considered in the
questionnaire are a throwback to poli
cies in place decades ago. The choices
offered are between keeping the present
policy or returning to a more punitive
system of F grades, W grades and short
er deadlines for dropping courses/No
mention was made of eliminating D
grades, and yet it is clearly the fear of D
grades that leads students to request an
NC grade instead. No questions were
raised about the necessity of grading
itself. No thoughts about the desirability
of master learning were suggested. No
hints about modern evaluation alterna
tives were mentioned. The questionnaire
gave us the choice of maintaining the
status quo or moving backward.
The most serious deficiency in the
survey questionnaire is the absence of
any clearly stated educational goals in

considering a grading policy. What are
we trying to accomplish here? For whose
benefit was Stanford University estab
lished? If students are the intended bene
ficiaries, and if we want to equip them to
deal effectively with the unknown future,
then we must teach and evaluate them in
a way that motivates them to continue
learning for the rest of their lives. Are we
motivating students for lifelong learn
ing? Or is it more important to serve as a
screening service for future employers?
Are we encouraging students to explore
new domains? A grading policy should be
designed to accomplish certain educa
tional ends. We can't agree on an educa
tional policy if we don't specify the goals
it should achieve.
Much is known about survey research.
To obtain valid results, a full range of
unbiased questions in an appropriate
context is needed. Obtaining responses
from a representative sample is more
important than amassing a large return.
The weaknesses in the present ques
tionnaire will leave us still puzzled about
faculty aspirations for improving the grad
ing system. And before we take any action,
we should obtain the opinions of our stu
dents and alumni too. The institution
exists, at least in part, for them, doesn't it?
