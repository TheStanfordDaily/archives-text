# New budget released: cuts going well, deficits persist
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Halfway through its two-year,
$43 million budget-reduction pro
gram, the University's adminis
trators praised the budget-cutting
progress in revealing the 1993-94
preliminary budget at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
But on track with previous
projections, the University will
still face an approximately $11
million deficit during the 1994-
95 school year. Last year, Univer
sity officials had projected
deficits of $10-$l5 million in
1994 and 1995.
"It won't be easy to deal with,
but it will be manageable,"
Provost Gerald Lieberman said
after yesterday's meeting.
The budget, which details the
second half of the $43 million bud
get adjustment, calls for $10 mil
lion in cuts and a $5 million rev
enue increase next year.
Likely to be approved by the
Board of Trustees next week, the
budget incorporates additional

revenue from the 7.5 percent tu
ition hike and maintaining the en
dowment payout rate at 6.75 per
cent, two points higher than usual.
"Our efforts have paid off,"
Lieberman said. "We have been
monitoring the progress of the
budget, and we all agree Ithe
deficit reduction program] is going
well."
In one case, the University ac
tually took too much from an area
— Libraries and Information Re
sources — and is restoring some of
the funds that were cut, Lieber
man said.
Reaction to cuts in this area, es
pecially from students, has been so
"vociferous," Lieberman said after
the meeting, that he realized ap
proximately $200,000 needed to be
returned to restore some pro
grams.
Lieberman added he "was not
aware of other areas where the
cuts had a significant impact on
operations."
Unlike Libraries and Informa-
tion Resources, Financial Aid —
another area hit hard in last year's
cuts — will not receive any sort of
"rebate." But a plan to lower the
amount of aid students must repay
while still at Stanford will contin
ue.
Last year, while cuts were made
in the budget for student aid, the
University was determined to con
tinue its policy of need-blind admis
sions.
University Budget Director Tim
Warner said before the meeting
that Stanford had to be "more vigi
lant in determining student needs
and assets" to bring financial aid
back on target.
Lieberman said that these
changes, such as seeking contribu
tions from non-custodial parents,
are not working as well as antici
pated, but the University still
hopes to achieve the full reductions
in the four-year period.
Warner said after the meeting
that the University overestimated
the amount of parental contribu
tions.
However, he said Stanford will
be able to meet its goal of raising
$2.5 million as a way of offsetting
reductions in financial aid, since
contributions from non-custodial
parents will be requested of incom
ing classes over the next four
years.
Despite the shortfall in finan
cial-aid savings, Lieberman said he
wants to continue reducing the
amount students are required to
pay back while at Stanford from 25
percent to 20 percent.
Even though this reduction will
result in an additional $1.2 million
cost over the next two years,
Lieberman said he realized that the
old rate was too high.
Along with the tuition increase,
a large part of income in next year's
preliminary budget will come from
maintaining the 1992-93 increase
of the endowment fund's payout
rate.
This 6.75 percent rate was
approved by the trustees in June
1992 only for the following two
years' budgets, to eliminate the
deficit.
Lieberman said the current rate
will generate $26.1 million. Of this
amount, $12 million will be used to
eliminate the deficit. The remain
ing $14.1 million is to be divided so
that $7.1 million will cover Medical
School debts and $7 million will be

an indirect-cost contingency fund.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy said the University
should consider permanently
adopting a higher payout rate.
Lieberman said this is some
thing determined by the trustees,
but he hopes that a rate increase
could be agreed upon.
One aspect of the budget still up
in the air is how the University will
be affected by the government's
policies regarding indirect costs.
While the government has cur
rently capped the rate at 60.3 per
cent, Lieberman said he expects the
Clinton administration to re-issue
its rules regarding the recovery of
indirect costs of federal research.
The $7 million set aside in next
year's budget should cover any
changes in the regulations that
might affect Stanford, Lieberman
said.
The University also can't afford
to put as much aside for new pro
grams as it has in the past, Lieber
man said.
In the '80s, an average of 2 per
cent of the budget was earmarked
for new programs, and up to $30
million for the "contingency fund"
for unexpected events, such as the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
But Lieberman said since Stan
ford is "living in a new world and
new reality," only $2 million — 0.5
percent of the budget — can go to
new programs, and $3 million for
contingencies.
Education Prof. Myra Strober
questioned this dramatic reduction
in the general contingency fund at
the meeting.
Afterwards, she said, "I think
committing to keeping the budget
balanced, and not spending money
we do not have, is important." But
"there are just certain contingen
cies, like earthquakes, which we
cannot predict."
University President Gerhard
Casper said he is pleased with what
the budgets have accomplished.
"We will have a permanent cost
reduction of $23 million over two
years — that's not a bad accom
plishment. I'm very pleased we
have been able to stick to the origi
nal plan."
However, Casper emphasized
after the meeting that once Stan
ford is out of the red, it will not be
able to change its policy, particular
ly since Stanford relies heavily on
the economy of California, whose
budget is "discouraging."
"We will not be able to live
extravagantly in the future. We are
going to have to make hard deci
sions," he said.
