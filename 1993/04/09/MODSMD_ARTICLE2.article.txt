Halfway through its two-year,
$43 million budget-reduction pro
gram, the University's adminis
trators praised the budget-cutting
progress in revealing the 1993-94
preliminary budget at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
But on track with previous
projections, the University will
still face an approximately $11
million deficit during the 1994-
95 school year. Last year, Univer

Likely to be approved by the
Board of Trustees next week, the
budget incorporates additional

revenue from the 7.5 percent tu
ition hike and maintaining the en
dowment payout rate at 6.75 per
cent, two points higher than usual.

Lieberman said. "We have been
monitoring the progress of the
budget, and we all agree Ithe
deficit reduction program] is going
well."
In one case, the University ac
tually took too much from an area
— Libraries and Information Re
sources — and is restoring some of
the funds that were cut, Lieber
man said.
Reaction to cuts in this area, es
pecially from students, has been so
"vociferous," Lieberman said after
the meeting, that he realized ap
proximately $200,000 needed to be
returned to restore some pro
grams.
Lieberman added he "was not
aware of other areas where the
cuts had a significant impact on
operations."
