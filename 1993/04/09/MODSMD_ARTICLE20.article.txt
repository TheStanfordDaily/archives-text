# Stanford, other police attempting to head off possible soccer damage
## 
### 
I would like to respond to Paul
Fahn's April 1 letter regarding con
cerns about safety and security at the
1994 World Cup Soccer Matches to be
played at Stanford Stadium. Mr. Fahn
raises some legitimate issues. Interna

tional soccer has a history of fan vio
lence in other parts of the world. How
ever, none of the many international
soccer matches played at Stanford over
the past several years has resulted in
any violence.
We know that World Cup 1994 will
bring more foreign visitors and the pos
sibility of increased problems. To pre
pare for that eventuality, the police offi
cials from all nine venues and the World
Cup officials have been meeting on a reg
ular basis to develop strategies to mini

mize any threat. Obviously, no one can
guarantee a completely trouble-free
event. But, we have the cooperation and
assistance of the World Cup sponsors
and are working hard to ensure a series
of safe and entertaining soccer matches.
Our Department has successfully han
dled security for many high-profile
events over the years. We will do all we
can to maintain that standard.
Marvin L. Herrington
Director, Stanford Department of Public
Safety
