## DR's: the danger inside 
### 
I FULLY ADMIT I've been lax in ful
filling my Distribution Requirements.
This comes to mind, seeing as my par
ents are coming out here in June not just
to see the Claw spout water. So with one
quarter to go, I have two, count 'em two,
DR's left to fill.
My main criteria for picking classes to
fulfil these pesky requirements included
the availability of the pass/no credit
option, their not being dreadfully boring,
not requiring too many expensive books
and requiring absolutely no sections.
After a few years of technoid classes,
where section boils down to an extra lec
ture from the TA, I developed a profound
distaste for section, any kind of section.
I had awful flashbacks from Fiction
Writing, talking teddy-bears (in all hon
esty this was some other people's Fiction
Writing class), shotgun to the head
(ditto) and licking other people's eyeballs
as trust exercises (italics and experiences
mine). I recalled horror stories from my
fuzzier friends about mass indoctrina
tions.
I failed in my attempts to get into the
interesting classes, in which I recognized
no one, except for maybe one person who
was there for the same reason I was (side
note: even if you're taking the class as a
DR, don't ever write that on the informa
tion sheet for a size-restricted class,
unless you want to get axed for the spud
next to you). We would exchange the

knowing glance of the DR mercenary and
quietly excuse ourselves as the professor
described the 30-page research paper and
mandatory pony-tail growth (I left main
ly as a short-hair protest thing).
What I ended up with was a class that
had (you guessed it, folks) a section.
Strangely, someplace between "So what
do you guys think of the lectures?" and
"Well, we're about out of time," I started
to enjoy being in section.
I liked the interaction. No, not getting
in-touch-with-my-feelings-and-the-feel-
ings-of-others interaction (don't even
think about touching my feelings), but
rather I liked yelling at other people. And
I am going to get credit, for simply refut
ing arguments, applying logic, talking in
a loud voice and being hostile towards
others.
This was not food-service table
interaction, where half of the people at
the table would rather be at the next
table talking with the cool people about
whether or not you can breathe
through a blueberry muffin, and the
other half want to get back to the com
puter cluster because they just recov
ered a Holy Avenger Two-handed
Sword, and they want use it to interact
with the Balrog.
This was not talking on the phone
with your parents, where your main
goals are to ascertain the status of your
dog (and to ensure that your dog hasn't

really died and your parents aren't trying
to trick you), to conceal your payment of
$80 to Mr. Ticket, the dubiously named
ticket salesman, and to avoid having to
talk to a younger sibling about anything
your parents are too embarrassed to dis
cuss.
I read that people in Western nations
spend twice as much time watching TV as
socializing with other folks. Too
because I enjoyed throwing out ideas and
beating people over the head with them;
Maybe Stanford has smashed some of the
spunk out of its students by making them
accept standardized ideas. I used to see
section as indoctrination time.
We are less eager to engage in a duel of
ideas over things that matter. We've
learned to walk away. Those with differ
ent views cultivate them secretly in dark
ness, not daring to bring them to light.
Who would, and face an apparent oppos
ing army of indoctrinated zombies? Dan
ger, danger, I'm over-extrapolating, dan
ger. Am I praising the Review? I hope
not, but I am calling for more real discus
sions or maybe simply more interactions.

Kenny thinks that living in a town that
has a number as part of its name is a bad
idea (eg. Tomsk-7).
