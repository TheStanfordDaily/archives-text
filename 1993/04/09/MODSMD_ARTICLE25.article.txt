almost 22. Others of you are not. Those
who are not should clip this out and save it
until then — not only because this con
tains useful information, but to improve
your organizational skills. Those who are
22 should realize you are now chronologi
cally closer to having your first child than
to your freshman year of high school.
Even if you think you do, you don't
really remember high school. At best you
remember your first keg party and how
much smaller your prom date's breasts
looked once you got them out of that
deceivingly complex piece of formalwear.
But what you don't remember is having
to change for a gym class in which you
spent the whole period taking a written
test about the rules of badminton. You
don't remember being yelled at for talking
in study hall. And you don't remember
how to fold notes into those little triangle
things that impressed boys so much.
Unless, of course, you were involved in
that tent thing last week. And at 22, don't

you think you should have been doing
something else with your time?
It was those formative years of public
schooling when you were turned into the
kind of citizen who will unquestioningly
set his clock forward an hour just to appeal
to some long-dead agrarian myth. And so
you won't miss the beginning of
"Roseanne."
Public school had a fascist tone to it
that you couldn't quite put your finger on
— mostly because you'd get a week of
detention if you did. There was something
eerie about 25 parole officers and parolees
to-be standing in unison at 8 a.m. to recite
the Pledge of Allegiance.
You cannot save children with fascism.
Unless of course, they voluntarily offer to
be boyscouts. Then the best thing to do is
to teach them a new knot every year and to
keep them away from girls.
It may have taken years, but somehow
this concept is finally sinking in. And the
most unlikely people seem to be catching
on, including vice-first lady Tipper Gore.
Tipper finally quit the PMRC, the group
that worked so hard to get those "parental
advisory" stickers put on CDs, which —
much to Al's chagrin — can't be recycled.

Almost makes you want to sit through a
dinner at the Gore house. Even if the Gore
girls were eating at a friend's house.
No, fascism won't save the children.
And if a grown woman who introduces
herself as "Tipper" to foreign dignitaries
can discover this simple truism on her
ownsome, why can't the rest of us?
Just this week, a public school in Long
Island banned the first "Where's Waldo?"
book from their shelves. Again, not for the
sake of the kids' eyesight, but because in
the upper-right hand corner of the beach
scene page, a microscopic woman is bear
ing her microscopic breast.
Yes, the kids might be able to handle it,
but the Waldo years being formative ones,
the kids might store that breast the size of
this letter "e" in their long-term memory
and their prom would be ruined before
they even got in the back seat.
Stop trying to save the kids. Stop trying
to keep them busy with standardized tests
and No. 2 pencils, so they never ask any
questions. A baloo is a bear. Sure it is. It's
all some Pentagon brainwashing tech
nique that will one day land us in Burkino
Faso pumping oil from dead Muslim lakes.
The FCC won't stop saving them,

deciding last month to stop allowing
shows like the Jetsons and G.I. Joe to
count as educational programming.
Which means more episodes of Barney,
the purple dinosaur, soon to be owned by
Disney.
But in some of the commercials for the
$29.99 videotape, the voice-over invites us
to learn with "Barney, the purple
dinosaur," when, in others, the very same
Barney is described as "Barney, the red
dinosaur." Not only are we making kids
color blind, but giving them weird
thoughts about Paleozoic pigmentation.
Come to think of it, what color was Fig
ment? Damn that Eisner.
Sure, 25 percent of children live in
poverty, but 49 percent of 12- to 13 year
olds have televisions in their room. That
means that of those who can eat, three
quarters of them can eat in front of their
own TVs.
So my 22-year-old friends who no
longer have that odd, guilty-about-feeling
guilty feeling when you show the bouncer
your ID, remember what it was like to be a
kid. Kids know when you're running them
through a factory system of education that
is as outdated as that giant schoolroom on

"Little House." And then they get mad
and sell crack. That's the problem in a
nutshell.
Sure kids may be influenced by our cul
ture, but, left to their own devices, they'll
decipher and filter what they get by them
selves, and come out the stronger for it.
They'll learn something from Ice-T's
anger and frustration, they'll learn about
America from"The true story of the
cheerleader people," and then they'll go
down to the record store and buy the new
Sting album which, to the relief of the
Long Island mothers, is based loosely on
the English classic, Chaucer's "Canter
bury Tales."
Oh, if they only knew.
