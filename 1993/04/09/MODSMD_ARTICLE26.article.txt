# Draft Policy on Sexual Harassment
## 
### 
It is the policy of Stanford University to main
tain the University community as a place of work
and study for students, faculty, and staff free of
sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimi
dation and exploitation. It is fundamental to the
concepts of academic freedom and equal oppor
tunity that each member of the University com
munity be treated with dignity and without re
gard to any factor irrelevant to participation in
the activities of this community.
It is further the policy of the University to pre
vent, correct, and remedy sexual harassment. All
students, faculty, and staff are subject to this poli
cy. Individuals who engage in such behavior are
subject to discipline up to and including dis
charge, expulsion, or other appropriate sanction.
Further University policy specific to sexual as
sault is provided in a companion policy statement.
Sexual harassment consists of unwanted sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, or other vi
sual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual na
ture when:
1. It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that sub
mission to or rejection of the conduct will be a
factor in academic or employment decisions or
evaluations, or permission to participate in a
University activity; or
2. The conduct has the purpose or effect of in
terfering with the individual's academic or work
performance, by creating a hostile and unaccept
able educational or work environment.
The determination of what constitutes sexual
harassment will depend upon the specific facts
and the context in which the conduct occurs.
Sexual harassment may take many forms. It may
be subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. It
may be conduct affecting an individual of the
opposite sex or conduct affecting an individual
of the same sex. It may occur between peers, or
between individuals in a hierarchical relation
ship. Regardless of the intentions of the actor,
the key question is always whether the conduct
is unwelcome to the individual to whom it is di
rected. Coercive behavior, including suggestions
that academic or employment reprisals or re
wards will follow the refusal or granting of sexu
al favors, constitutes gross misconduct and will
not be tolerated. A single incident could be
grounds for discharge or expulsion.
No reprisals will be taken against any individual
who in good faith makes a complaint about the
behavior which is in violation of this policy. In
tentionally false complaints, however, are
grounds for discipline.
Consensual Relationships
Those who supervise or evaluate the work of
others, both in academic and employment set
tings, must base their decisions on the merits,
and must deserve the trust of their students or
subordinates. To be effective, they must be per
ceived to make their decisions fairly and without
favoritism. There are special risks in any sexual
or romantic relationship between individuals in
inherently unequal positions (such as teacher
and student, or supervisor and employee). For
example, such relationships may undermine the
real or perceived integrity of the supervision and
evaluation provided. They may, moreover, be
less consensual than the individual whose posi
tion confers power believes, because of the com
plex and subtle effects of that power. The rela
tionship is likely to be perceived in different
ways by each of the parties to it, especially in ret
rospect.
Although the University has no formal policy
prohibiting consensual romantic and/or sexual
relationships among faculty, staff or students,
relationships in which one party is in a position
to review the work or influence the career of the
other may provide grounds for a complaint when
that relationship gives undue access or advan
tage, restricts opportunities, or creates a hostile
and unacceptable environment for others. Fur
thermore, circumstances may change and con-

duct that was previously welcome may become
unwelcome. Even when both parties have con
sented at the outset to a romantic involvement,
this past consent does not remove grounds for a
complaint based upon subsequent unwelcome
conduct.
IMPLEMENTATION
Overview of Resources
Responsibility for implementing this policy re
sides in the University officers responsible for
faculty, staff and student affairs. Anyone who
believes he or she may have been sexually ha
rassed, or who has other individual concerns
about sexual harassment in the University, is en
couraged to discuss the matter with any Univer
sity officer and obtain guidance and advice
about available procedures. Informal, local res
olution of a problem or complaint is preferred
whenever feasible. There are, however, a num
ber of individuals specially trained and charged
with specific responsibilities, in the area of sexu
al harassment.
Sexual Harassment Advisers ("Advisers") act as
resources to individuals who have concerns or
complaints about sexual harassment. The Sexual
Harassment Panel ("Panel") acts as an optional
resource to school or administrative officers re
sponsible to investigate complaints and remedy
situations where sexual harassment is found.
The Panel is also a resource to University griev
ance officers hearing grievances involving sexual
harassment. The Advisor/Coordinator supervis
es the Advisers, acts as an informational resource
to the Panel, encourages prevention education in
the University community, and keeps records
showing the disposition of complaints brought
under this policy. Each school and administra
tive unit may also develop and maintain Local
Resources charged to respond to concerns or
complaints about sexual harassment.
Adviser/Coordinator
The Adviser/Coordinator (1) acts as an Adviser;
(2) supervises the day-to-day advising duties of
other Advisers; (3) acts as a resource to the
Panel; (4) provides information toother Univer
sity officers about sexual harassment; (5) is
aware of and encourages and facilitates the use
of prevention education resources specific to
sexual harassment (e.g., trainers, speakers,
videotapes, written materials; (6) coordinates
training for new Advisers and Panel members;
(7) maintains records of every complaint, includ
ing the names of the complainant and subject
and the disposition of the complaint; (8) trans
mits to the President annually a report of the
number or complaints made to the Advisers and
other University officers, and their resolution;
(9) takes other action necessary to implement
this policy including:
• Developing awareness, education, and train
ing programs.
• Publishing and disseminating an informational
pamphlet containing this policy and providing
guidance for those affected by sexual harass
ment.
• Distributing this policy statement to all stu
dents, faculty and staff at the time of their join
ing the University and annually thereafter.
• Distributing and posting relevant material and
making any reports required by state or federal
law.
Sexjial Harassment Advisers
Advisers are appointed jointly by the Provost
and Vice President for Faculty and Staff Ser
vices to provide initial response to concerns and
complaints of sexual harassment. They discuss
any such concerns or complaints with students,
faculty, staff members who consult them provide
copies of this policy, and explain the internal op
tions. Possible outcomes of an individual's dis
cussion with the Adviser include these:
• The individual concludes that he/she does not
desire to make a complaint and no further ac
tion is taken by the University (even if an indi-

vidual declines to identify the subject of concern,
the Adviser may be able to give useful advice
concerning ways the situation might be handled
without University involvement);
• Although every effort will be make to honor a
complainant's request for confidentiality, there
may be cases where the individual concludes
that he/she does not desire to make a complaint,
but the situation described nonetheless requires
University action (for example, other students or
employees may be at risk); in these cases the
Adviser refers the matter to the cognizant Uni
versity officer for further action;
• The complainant seeks prospective changes in
the subject's behavior only, and the facts are ei
ther undisputed or uncontested; no further in
vestigation is required and a mediated resolu
tion is appropriate;
• Because the complainant seeks a retroactive
remedy (such as a changed grade or back pay),
or the facts are disputed, the matter is referred
to the school or administrative unit loFfurther
action.
In every case in which an individual makes a
complaint, the Adviser will notify the Coordina
tor of the fact of complaint and the identity of
the parties involved before taking any specific
action to resolve the matter informally.
Local Resources
Deans of Schools and heads of other administra
tive units may handle concerns and complaints
about sexual harassment themselves or with the
help of an advisory individual or group. The Ad
viser/Coordinator is available to facilitate train
ing of individuals so designated. Complaints
made to school or administrative unit (either by
the complainant in the first instance, or because
the complaint is not suitable for informal resolu
tion by an Adviser) will be handled as follows:
1. If the facts are disputed, the complaint will be
investigated by the cognizant University official;
once the facts are determined, if sexual harass
ment (or other unfair or inappropriate action) is
found, the cognizant University official will at
tempt to reach a negotiated or mediated resolu
tion;
2. If the negotiated or mediated resolution is
not reached, the cognizant University official
will take appropriate action;
3. In either case, the complainant and the Ad
viser/Coordinator will be advised of the outcome
of the investigation and the action, if any, taken
in response to the complaint. Those handling
complaints brought to schools or administrative
units are strongly encouraged to consult with the
Panel (or a member designated by the Chair of
the Panel) concerning the investigation and ac
tion to be taken to remedy sexual harassment.
In any event, the disposition of every complaint
shall be reported to the Adviser/Coordinator.
The Sexual Harassment Panel
The Panel is appointed by the President. On re
quest of a dean or head of administrative unit,
the Panel (or one or more of its members, as de
termined by its Chair) will advise and assist
Local Resources and administrative officers in
investigating or considering action based upon a
complaint of sexual harassment. In any formal
grievance procedure in which sexual harassment
is claimed, the University grievance hearing offi
cer shall consult the Panel, which shall provide
guidance and advice. The Panel shall report to
the Adviser/Coordinator on every complaint in
which it is involved.
Complaints
Stanford will investigate every complaint of sexual
harassment, and will take appropriate action to
remedy the effects of conduct that violates this
policy. A complaint is a claim that a specific
named individual has violated this policy. The

complainant is the individual making the com
plaint, who must consent to being identified to the
subject of the complaint. Students, faculty, and
staff members should, however, feel free to dis
cuss concerns that do not amount to complaints
with the Advisers or other University officers.
A complaint may be handled informally or for
mally. While an informal complaint may be
made at any time, the more promptly a com
plaint is made, and the more information the
complainant can provide, the more likely it is
that a full investigation can be conducted effec
tively. A formal complaint is one brought under
one of the University's established grievance
procedures. Grievances must normally be filed
within the time limits specified by the applicable
procedure.
Informal Procedures
The procedure for handling complaints infor
mally depends upon whether the facts are con
tested and whether the complainant seeks a
remedy other than a prospective change in the
subject's behavior.
If the facts are not contested, and the com
plainant seeks only a prospective change in the
subject's behavior, the complaint may be raised
to an Adviser, who will seek to mediate a resolu
tion.
If the facts are contested, or if a retroactive rem
edy is sought, the complaint will be directed to
the cognizant University officer in the school or
administrative unit where the subject works. (If
the subject is a student, the complaint may be di
rected either to the dean of the relevant school,
or to the Dean of Students.) After the facts are
determined, the cognizant University officer will
take any action required.
Grievances
As an alternative to informal procedures, or
when informal resolution efforts fail, the com
plainant may be able to file a grievance. While
informal resolution efforts will not automatically
toll the time limits for filing a grievance, in ap
propriate circumstances the complainant and
the University may mutually agree in writing to
extend the time for filing a grievance. These are
the established grievance procedures:
• Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Guide Memo 22.10).
• Collective Bargaining Agreements for unit
members.
• Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Academic Staff Handbook).
• Faculty Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 21.4).
• Student Academic Grievance Procedure (see
Stanford University Bulletin, Information and
Regulations Governing Student Conduct and
Procedures for their Enforcement).
• Student Employee Grievance Procedure (see
Guide Memo 24).
• Student Nonacademic Grievance Procedure
pursuant to Title IX (consult the Director of the
Office of Multicultural Development, who
serves as the University's Title IX Officer).
Remedies
Incidents of claimed sexual harassment may be
remedied by a change in the behavior that is
questioned, by retroactive relief to the com
plainant, or both. When it is impossible to deter
mine whether the conduct complained of in fact
occurred, it may nonetheless be appropriate for
the school or administrative unit to renew pre
vention education efforts.
Independent of the remedy for the individual
complainant, the University may determine that
disciplinary action should be taken against the
subject. The decision to take disciplinary action
is in the discretion of the President (for faculty
and students) or the administrative supervisor
(for staff employees). The complainant and the
Adviser/Coordinator will be informed of any dis
ciplinary action that is imposed.
It is the policy of Stanford University to main
tain the University community as a place of work
and study for students, faculty, and staff free of
sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimi
dation and exploitation. It is fundamental to the
concepts of academic freedom and equal oppor

It is further the policy of the University to pre

students, faculty, and staff are subject to this poli
cy. Individuals who engage in such behavior are
subject to discipline up to and including dis
charge, expulsion, or other appropriate sanction.

• Distributing this policy statement to all stu
dents, faculty and staff at the time of their join
ing the University and annually thereafter.
• Distributing and posting relevant material and
making any reports required by state or federal
law.
Sexjial Harassment Advisers
Advisers are appointed jointly by the Provost
and Vice President for Faculty and Staff Ser
vices to provide initial response to concerns and
complaints of sexual harassment. They discuss
any such concerns or complaints with students,
faculty, staff members who consult them provide
copies of this policy, and explain the internal op
tions. Possible outcomes of an individual's dis
cussion with the Adviser include these:
• The individual concludes that he/she does not
desire to make a complaint and no further ac
tion is taken by the University (even if an indi-

vidual declines to identify the subject of concern,
the Adviser may be able to give useful advice
concerning ways the situation might be handled
without University involvement);
• Although every effort will be make to honor a
complainant's request for confidentiality, there
may be cases where the individual concludes
that he/she does not desire to make a complaint,
but the situation described nonetheless requires
University action (for example, other students or
employees may be at risk); in these cases the
Adviser refers the matter to the cognizant Uni
versity officer for further action;
• The complainant seeks prospective changes in
the subject's behavior only, and the facts are ei
ther undisputed or uncontested; no further in
vestigation is required and a mediated resolu
tion is appropriate;
• Because the complainant seeks a retroactive
remedy (such as a changed grade or back pay),
or the facts are disputed, the matter is referred
to the school or administrative unit loFfurther
action.
In every case in which an individual makes a
complaint, the Adviser will notify the Coordina
tor of the fact of complaint and the identity of
the parties involved before taking any specific
action to resolve the matter informally.
Local Resources
Deans of Schools and heads of other administra
tive units may handle concerns and complaints
about sexual harassment themselves or with the
help of an advisory individual or group. The Ad
viser/Coordinator is available to facilitate train
ing of individuals so designated. Complaints
made to school or administrative unit (either by
the complainant in the first instance, or because
the complaint is not suitable for informal resolu
tion by an Adviser) will be handled as follows:
1. If the facts are disputed, the complaint will be
investigated by the cognizant University official;
once the facts are determined, if sexual harass
ment (or other unfair or inappropriate action) is
found, the cognizant University official will at
tempt to reach a negotiated or mediated resolu
tion;
2. If the negotiated or mediated resolution is
not reached, the cognizant University official
will take appropriate action;
3. In either case, the complainant and the Ad
viser/Coordinator will be advised of the outcome
of the investigation and the action, if any, taken
in response to the complaint. Those handling
complaints brought to schools or administrative
units are strongly encouraged to consult with the
Panel (or a member designated by the Chair of
the Panel) concerning the investigation and ac
tion to be taken to remedy sexual harassment.
In any event, the disposition of every complaint
shall be reported to the Adviser/Coordinator.
The Sexual Harassment Panel
The Panel is appointed by the President. On re
quest of a dean or head of administrative unit,
the Panel (or one or more of its members, as de
termined by its Chair) will advise and assist
Local Resources and administrative officers in
investigating or considering action based upon a
complaint of sexual harassment. In any formal
grievance procedure in which sexual harassment
is claimed, the University grievance hearing offi
cer shall consult the Panel, which shall provide
guidance and advice. The Panel shall report to
the Adviser/Coordinator on every complaint in
which it is involved.
Complaints
Stanford will investigate every complaint of sexual
harassment, and will take appropriate action to
remedy the effects of conduct that violates this
policy. A complaint is a claim that a specific
named individual has violated this policy. The

complainant is the individual making the com
plaint, who must consent to being identified to the
subject of the complaint. Students, faculty, and
staff members should, however, feel free to dis
cuss concerns that do not amount to complaints
with the Advisers or other University officers.
A complaint may be handled informally or for
mally. While an informal complaint may be
made at any time, the more promptly a com
plaint is made, and the more information the
complainant can provide, the more likely it is
that a full investigation can be conducted effec
tively. A formal complaint is one brought under
one of the University's established grievance
procedures. Grievances must normally be filed
within the time limits specified by the applicable
procedure.
Informal Procedures
The procedure for handling complaints infor
mally depends upon whether the facts are con
tested and whether the complainant seeks a
remedy other than a prospective change in the
subject's behavior.
If the facts are not contested, and the com
plainant seeks only a prospective change in the
subject's behavior, the complaint may be raised
to an Adviser, who will seek to mediate a resolu
tion.
If the facts are contested, or if a retroactive rem
edy is sought, the complaint will be directed to
the cognizant University officer in the school or
administrative unit where the subject works. (If
the subject is a student, the complaint may be di
rected either to the dean of the relevant school,
or to the Dean of Students.) After the facts are
determined, the cognizant University officer will
take any action required.
Grievances
As an alternative to informal procedures, or
when informal resolution efforts fail, the com
plainant may be able to file a grievance. While
informal resolution efforts will not automatically
toll the time limits for filing a grievance, in ap
propriate circumstances the complainant and
the University may mutually agree in writing to
extend the time for filing a grievance. These are
the established grievance procedures:
• Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Guide Memo 22.10).
• Collective Bargaining Agreements for unit
members.
• Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Academic Staff Handbook).
• Faculty Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 21.4).
• Student Academic Grievance Procedure (see
Stanford University Bulletin, Information and
Regulations Governing Student Conduct and
Procedures for their Enforcement).
• Student Employee Grievance Procedure (see
Guide Memo 24).
• Student Nonacademic Grievance Procedure
pursuant to Title IX (consult the Director of the
Office of Multicultural Development, who
serves as the University's Title IX Officer).
Remedies
Incidents of claimed sexual harassment may be
remedied by a change in the behavior that is
questioned, by retroactive relief to the com
plainant, or both. When it is impossible to deter
mine whether the conduct complained of in fact
occurred, it may nonetheless be appropriate for
the school or administrative unit to renew pre
vention education efforts.
Independent of the remedy for the individual
complainant, the University may determine that
disciplinary action should be taken against the
subject. The decision to take disciplinary action
is in the discretion of the President (for faculty
and students) or the administrative supervisor
(for staff employees). The complainant and the
Adviser/Coordinator will be informed of any dis
ciplinary action that is imposed.
It is the policy of Stanford University to main
tain the University community as a place of work
and study for students, faculty, and staff free of
sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimi
dation and exploitation. It is fundamental to the
concepts of academic freedom and equal oppor
tunity that each member of the University com
munity be treated with dignity and without re
gard to any factor irrelevant to participation in
the activities of this community.
It is further the policy of the University to pre
vent, correct, and remedy sexual harassment. All
students, faculty, and staff are subject to this poli
cy. Individuals who engage in such behavior are
subject to discipline up to and including dis
charge, expulsion, or other appropriate sanction.
Further University policy specific to sexual as
sault is provided in a companion policy statement.
Sexual harassment consists of unwanted sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, or other vi
sual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual na
ture when:
1. It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that sub
mission to or rejection of the conduct will be a
factor in academic or employment decisions or
evaluations, or permission to participate in a
University activity; or
2. The conduct has the purpose or effect of in
terfering with the individual's academic or work
performance, by creating a hostile and unaccept
able educational or work environment.
The determination of what constitutes sexual
harassment will depend upon the specific facts
and the context in which the conduct occurs.
Sexual harassment may take many forms. It may
be subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. It
may be conduct affecting an individual of the
opposite sex or conduct affecting an individual
of the same sex. It may occur between peers, or
between individuals in a hierarchical relation
ship. Regardless of the intentions of the actor,
the key question is always whether the conduct
is unwelcome to the individual to whom it is di
rected. Coercive behavior, including suggestions
that academic or employment reprisals or re
wards will follow the refusal or granting of sexu
al favors, constitutes gross misconduct and will
not be tolerated. A single incident could be
grounds for discharge or expulsion.
No reprisals will be taken against any individual
who in good faith makes a complaint about the
behavior which is in violation of this policy. In
tentionally false complaints, however, are
grounds for discipline.
Consensual Relationships
Those who supervise or evaluate the work of
others, both in academic and employment set
tings, must base their decisions on the merits,
and must deserve the trust of their students or
subordinates. To be effective, they must be per
ceived to make their decisions fairly and without
favoritism. There are special risks in any sexual
or romantic relationship between individuals in
inherently unequal positions (such as teacher
and student, or supervisor and employee). For
example, such relationships may undermine the
real or perceived integrity of the supervision and
evaluation provided. They may, moreover, be
less consensual than the individual whose posi
tion confers power believes, because of the com
plex and subtle effects of that power. The rela
tionship is likely to be perceived in different
ways by each of the parties to it, especially in ret
rospect.
Although the University has no formal policy
prohibiting consensual romantic and/or sexual
relationships among faculty, staff or students,
relationships in which one party is in a position
to review the work or influence the career of the
other may provide grounds for a complaint when
that relationship gives undue access or advan
tage, restricts opportunities, or creates a hostile
and unacceptable environment for others. Fur
thermore, circumstances may change and con-

duct that was previously welcome may become
unwelcome. Even when both parties have con
sented at the outset to a romantic involvement,
this past consent does not remove grounds for a
complaint based upon subsequent unwelcome
conduct.
IMPLEMENTATION
Overview of Resources
Responsibility for implementing this policy re
sides in the University officers responsible for
faculty, staff and student affairs. Anyone who
believes he or she may have been sexually ha
rassed, or who has other individual concerns
about sexual harassment in the University, is en
couraged to discuss the matter with any Univer
sity officer and obtain guidance and advice
about available procedures. Informal, local res
olution of a problem or complaint is preferred
whenever feasible. There are, however, a num
ber of individuals specially trained and charged
with specific responsibilities, in the area of sexu
al harassment.
Sexual Harassment Advisers ("Advisers") act as
resources to individuals who have concerns or
complaints about sexual harassment. The Sexual
Harassment Panel ("Panel") acts as an optional
resource to school or administrative officers re
sponsible to investigate complaints and remedy
situations where sexual harassment is found.
The Panel is also a resource to University griev
ance officers hearing grievances involving sexual
harassment. The Advisor/Coordinator supervis
es the Advisers, acts as an informational resource
to the Panel, encourages prevention education in
the University community, and keeps records
showing the disposition of complaints brought
under this policy. Each school and administra
tive unit may also develop and maintain Local
Resources charged to respond to concerns or
complaints about sexual harassment.
Adviser/Coordinator
The Adviser/Coordinator (1) acts as an Adviser;
(2) supervises the day-to-day advising duties of
other Advisers; (3) acts as a resource to the
Panel; (4) provides information toother Univer
sity officers about sexual harassment; (5) is
aware of and encourages and facilitates the use
of prevention education resources specific to
sexual harassment (e.g., trainers, speakers,
videotapes, written materials; (6) coordinates
training for new Advisers and Panel members;
(7) maintains records of every complaint, includ
ing the names of the complainant and subject
and the disposition of the complaint; (8) trans
mits to the President annually a report of the
number or complaints made to the Advisers and
other University officers, and their resolution;
(9) takes other action necessary to implement
this policy including:
• Developing awareness, education, and train
ing programs.
• Publishing and disseminating an informational
pamphlet containing this policy and providing
guidance for those affected by sexual harass
ment.
• Distributing this policy statement to all stu
dents, faculty and staff at the time of their join
ing the University and annually thereafter.
• Distributing and posting relevant material and
making any reports required by state or federal
law.

Remedies
Incidents of claimed sexual harassment may be
remedied by a change in the behavior that is
questioned, by retroactive relief to the com
plainant, or both. When it is impossible to deter
mine whether the conduct complained of in fact
occurred, it may nonetheless be appropriate for
the school or administrative unit to renew pre
vention education efforts.
Independent of the remedy for the individual
complainant, the University may determine that
disciplinary action should be taken against the
subject. The decision to take disciplinary action
is in the discretion of the President (for faculty
and students) or the administrative supervisor
(for staff employees). The complainant and the
Adviser/Coordinator will be informed of any dis
ciplinary action that is imposed.
It is the policy of Stanford University to main
tain the University community as a place of work
and study for students, faculty, and staff free of
sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimi
dation and exploitation. It is fundamental to the
concepts of academic freedom and equal oppor
tunity that each member of the University com
munity be treated with dignity and without re
gard to any factor irrelevant to participation in
the activities of this community.
It is further the policy of the University to pre
vent, correct, and remedy sexual harassment. All
students, faculty, and staff are subject to this poli
cy. Individuals who engage in such behavior are
subject to discipline up to and including dis
charge, expulsion, or other appropriate sanction.
Further University policy specific to sexual as
sault is provided in a companion policy statement.
Sexual harassment consists of unwanted sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, or other vi
sual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual na
ture when:
1. It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that sub
mission to or rejection of the conduct will be a
factor in academic or employment decisions or
evaluations, or permission to participate in a
University activity; or
2. The conduct has the purpose or effect of in
terfering with the individual's academic or work
performance, by creating a hostile and unaccept
able educational or work environment.
The determination of what constitutes sexual
harassment will depend upon the specific facts
and the context in which the conduct occurs.
Sexual harassment may take many forms. It may
be subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. It
may be conduct affecting an individual of the
opposite sex or conduct affecting an individual
of the same sex. It may occur between peers, or
between individuals in a hierarchical relation
ship. Regardless of the intentions of the actor,
the key question is always whether the conduct
is unwelcome to the individual to whom it is di
rected. Coercive behavior, including suggestions
that academic or employment reprisals or re
wards will follow the refusal or granting of sexu
al favors, constitutes gross misconduct and will
not be tolerated. A single incident could be
grounds for discharge or expulsion.
No reprisals will be taken against any individual
who in good faith makes a complaint about the
behavior which is in violation of this policy. In
tentionally false complaints, however, are
grounds for discipline.
Consensual Relationships
Those who supervise or evaluate the work of
others, both in academic and employment set
tings, must base their decisions on the merits,
and must deserve the trust of their students or
subordinates. To be effective, they must be per
ceived to make their decisions fairly and without
favoritism. There are special risks in any sexual
or romantic relationship between individuals in
inherently unequal positions (such as teacher
and student, or supervisor and employee). For
example, such relationships may undermine the
real or perceived integrity of the supervision and
evaluation provided. They may, moreover, be
less consensual than the individual whose posi
tion confers power believes, because of the com
plex and subtle effects of that power. The rela
tionship is likely to be perceived in different
ways by each of the parties to it, especially in ret
rospect.
Although the University has no formal policy
prohibiting consensual romantic and/or sexual
relationships among faculty, staff or students,
relationships in which one party is in a position
to review the work or influence the career of the
other may provide grounds for a complaint when
that relationship gives undue access or advan
tage, restricts opportunities, or creates a hostile
and unacceptable environment for others. Fur
thermore, circumstances may change and con-

duct that was previously welcome may become
unwelcome. Even when both parties have con
sented at the outset to a romantic involvement,
this past consent does not remove grounds for a
complaint based upon subsequent unwelcome
conduct.
IMPLEMENTATION
Overview of Resources
Responsibility for implementing this policy re
sides in the University officers responsible for
faculty, staff and student affairs. Anyone who
believes he or she may have been sexually ha
rassed, or who has other individual concerns
about sexual harassment in the University, is en
couraged to discuss the matter with any Univer
sity officer and obtain guidance and advice
about available procedures. Informal, local res
olution of a problem or complaint is preferred
whenever feasible. There are, however, a num
ber of individuals specially trained and charged
with specific responsibilities, in the area of sexu
al harassment.
Sexual Harassment Advisers ("Advisers") act as
resources to individuals who have concerns or
complaints about sexual harassment. The Sexual
Harassment Panel ("Panel") acts as an optional
resource to school or administrative officers re
sponsible to investigate complaints and remedy
situations where sexual harassment is found.
The Panel is also a resource to University griev
ance officers hearing grievances involving sexual
harassment. The Advisor/Coordinator supervis
es the Advisers, acts as an informational resource
to the Panel, encourages prevention education in
the University community, and keeps records
showing the disposition of complaints brought
under this policy. Each school and administra
tive unit may also develop and maintain Local
Resources charged to respond to concerns or
complaints about sexual harassment.
Adviser/Coordinator
The Adviser/Coordinator (1) acts as an Adviser;
(2) supervises the day-to-day advising duties of
other Advisers; (3) acts as a resource to the
Panel; (4) provides information toother Univer
sity officers about sexual harassment; (5) is
aware of and encourages and facilitates the use
of prevention education resources specific to
sexual harassment (e.g., trainers, speakers,
videotapes, written materials; (6) coordinates
training for new Advisers and Panel members;
(7) maintains records of every complaint, includ
ing the names of the complainant and subject
and the disposition of the complaint; (8) trans
mits to the President annually a report of the
number or complaints made to the Advisers and
other University officers, and their resolution;
(9) takes other action necessary to implement
this policy including:
• Developing awareness, education, and train
ing programs.
• Publishing and disseminating an informational
pamphlet containing this policy and providing
guidance for those affected by sexual harass
ment.
• Distributing this policy statement to all stu
dents, faculty and staff at the time of their join
ing the University and annually thereafter.
• Distributing and posting relevant material and
making any reports required by state or federal
law.
Sexjial Harassment Advisers
Advisers are appointed jointly by the Provost
and Vice President for Faculty and Staff Ser
vices to provide initial response to concerns and
complaints of sexual harassment. They discuss
any such concerns or complaints with students,
faculty, staff members who consult them provide
copies of this policy, and explain the internal op
tions. Possible outcomes of an individual's dis
cussion with the Adviser include these:
• The individual concludes that he/she does not
desire to make a complaint and no further ac
tion is taken by the University (even if an indi-

vidual declines to identify the subject of concern,
the Adviser may be able to give useful advice
concerning ways the situation might be handled
without University involvement);
• Although every effort will be make to honor a
complainant's request for confidentiality, there
may be cases where the individual concludes
that he/she does not desire to make a complaint,
but the situation described nonetheless requires
University action (for example, other students or
employees may be at risk); in these cases the
Adviser refers the matter to the cognizant Uni
versity officer for further action;
• The complainant seeks prospective changes in
the subject's behavior only, and the facts are ei
ther undisputed or uncontested; no further in
vestigation is required and a mediated resolu
tion is appropriate;
• Because the complainant seeks a retroactive
remedy (such as a changed grade or back pay),
or the facts are disputed, the matter is referred
to the school or administrative unit loFfurther
action.
In every case in which an individual makes a
complaint, the Adviser will notify the Coordina
tor of the fact of complaint and the identity of
the parties involved before taking any specific
action to resolve the matter informally.
Local Resources
Deans of Schools and heads of other administra
tive units may handle concerns and complaints
about sexual harassment themselves or with the
help of an advisory individual or group. The Ad
viser/Coordinator is available to facilitate train
ing of individuals so designated. Complaints
made to school or administrative unit (either by
the complainant in the first instance, or because
the complaint is not suitable for informal resolu
tion by an Adviser) will be handled as follows:
1. If the facts are disputed, the complaint will be
investigated by the cognizant University official;
once the facts are determined, if sexual harass
ment (or other unfair or inappropriate action) is
found, the cognizant University official will at
tempt to reach a negotiated or mediated resolu
tion;
2. If the negotiated or mediated resolution is
not reached, the cognizant University official
will take appropriate action;
3. In either case, the complainant and the Ad
viser/Coordinator will be advised of the outcome
of the investigation and the action, if any, taken
in response to the complaint. Those handling
complaints brought to schools or administrative
units are strongly encouraged to consult with the
Panel (or a member designated by the Chair of
the Panel) concerning the investigation and ac
tion to be taken to remedy sexual harassment.
In any event, the disposition of every complaint
shall be reported to the Adviser/Coordinator.
The Sexual Harassment Panel
The Panel is appointed by the President. On re
quest of a dean or head of administrative unit,
the Panel (or one or more of its members, as de
termined by its Chair) will advise and assist
Local Resources and administrative officers in
investigating or considering action based upon a
complaint of sexual harassment. In any formal
grievance procedure in which sexual harassment
is claimed, the University grievance hearing offi
cer shall consult the Panel, which shall provide
guidance and advice. The Panel shall report to
the Adviser/Coordinator on every complaint in
which it is involved.
Complaints
Stanford will investigate every complaint of sexual
harassment, and will take appropriate action to
remedy the effects of conduct that violates this
policy. A complaint is a claim that a specific
named individual has violated this policy. The

complainant is the individual making the com
plaint, who must consent to being identified to the
subject of the complaint. Students, faculty, and
staff members should, however, feel free to dis
cuss concerns that do not amount to complaints
with the Advisers or other University officers.
A complaint may be handled informally or for
mally. While an informal complaint may be
made at any time, the more promptly a com
plaint is made, and the more information the
complainant can provide, the more likely it is
that a full investigation can be conducted effec
tively. A formal complaint is one brought under
one of the University's established grievance
procedures. Grievances must normally be filed
within the time limits specified by the applicable
procedure.
Informal Procedures
The procedure for handling complaints infor
mally depends upon whether the facts are con
tested and whether the complainant seeks a
remedy other than a prospective change in the
subject's behavior.
If the facts are not contested, and the com
plainant seeks only a prospective change in the
subject's behavior, the complaint may be raised
to an Adviser, who will seek to mediate a resolu
tion.
If the facts are contested, or if a retroactive rem
edy is sought, the complaint will be directed to
the cognizant University officer in the school or
administrative unit where the subject works. (If
the subject is a student, the complaint may be di
rected either to the dean of the relevant school,
or to the Dean of Students.) After the facts are
determined, the cognizant University officer will
take any action required.
Grievances
As an alternative to informal procedures, or
when informal resolution efforts fail, the com
plainant may be able to file a grievance. While
informal resolution efforts will not automatically
toll the time limits for filing a grievance, in ap
propriate circumstances the complainant and
the University may mutually agree in writing to
extend the time for filing a grievance. These are
the established grievance procedures:
• Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Guide Memo 22.10).
• Collective Bargaining Agreements for unit
members.
• Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Academic Staff Handbook).
• Faculty Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 21.4).
• Student Academic Grievance Procedure (see
Stanford University Bulletin, Information and
Regulations Governing Student Conduct and
Procedures for their Enforcement).
• Student Employee Grievance Procedure (see
Guide Memo 24).
• Student Nonacademic Grievance Procedure
pursuant to Title IX (consult the Director of the
Office of Multicultural Development, who
serves as the University's Title IX Officer).
Remedies
Incidents of claimed sexual harassment may be
remedied by a change in the behavior that is
questioned, by retroactive relief to the com
plainant, or both. When it is impossible to deter
mine whether the conduct complained of in fact
occurred, it may nonetheless be appropriate for
the school or administrative unit to renew pre
vention education efforts.
Independent of the remedy for the individual
complainant, the University may determine that
disciplinary action should be taken against the
subject. The decision to take disciplinary action
is in the discretion of the President (for faculty
and students) or the administrative supervisor
(for staff employees). The complainant and the
Adviser/Coordinator will be informed of any dis
ciplinary action that is imposed.
