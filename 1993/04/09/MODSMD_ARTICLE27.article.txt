## Adams makes sure eight is enough, blanks Trojans 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Stanford belted a season-high
three home runs against division
leading USC at Sunken Diamond
yesterday. And Willie Adams
didn't need any of them.
Adams, a 6-foot-7 junior,
tossed his second-consecutive
complete-game shutout, holding
the Trojans to five hits in an 8-0
romp.
"Unbelievable," said coach
Mark Marquess. "We've had some
great pitchers here since I've been
here, but I don't think we've ever
had anyone throw back-to-back
shutouts in league."
"Traditionally, they're real
aggressive at the plate," Adams
said. "I threw a lot of off-speed
pitches early in the game to get
ahead of the hitters. It worked
out pretty well."
Adams, now 7-1 on the year,
walked one and struck out two in
lowering his earned-run average
to 3.23. He made big pitches when
he got into trouble, recording
three groundouts after giving up
a double to Gabe Alvarez to start
the seventh inning.
"I really think he's one of the
best pitchers in the league, if not
the country," Marquess said.
But Adams wasn't the only
story for the Cardinal yesterday.
Stanford (17-13 overall, 5-8 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion), plagued by defensive prob-.
lems and a lack of offensive power
production for most of the season,
remedied both yesterday.
The maligned Cardinal infield
looked solid all day long. In the

second, for instance, Dusty Allen
retired Geoff Jenkins with a back
handed stab of a sharp grounder.
The next batter, Kurt Bierek,
bounced a slow roller to short
stop, which Jed Hansen handled
with a nice charging play.
Third baseman Brian Dal
limore ended the inning by block
ing a hard-hit ball off the bat of
Aaron Boone, throwing him out
on a close play at first. In the out
field, Brodie Van Wagenen robbed
Boone again in the fifth with a
diving catch in right-center field.
"We're playing more sound
defense lately," Dallimore said.
"Our pitching has really been
excellent, but our defense hasn't
helped out that much. But we're
starting to give a little more effort
out there."
"The defense has been a con

cern of ours all season," Mar
quess said. "It's been a lot more
consistent lately."
Offensive power, also a con
cern of Marquess', was not a
problem for Stanford yesterday,
as Cardinal batsmen pounded out
six extra-base hits.
Stanford jumped to a 2-0 lead
on sacrifice flies from Steve Carv
er and Hansen. Allen made it 4-0
in the fifth when he lined his
third home run of the season into
the trees in left field. Allen, who
went deep 10 times last season,
now has three this year.
"Dusty's going to hit more
home runs, there's no question
about that," Marquess said. "It's
a matter of time."
