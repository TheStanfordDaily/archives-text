# Netters hope to rebound as top-10 foes visit

Call it "mid-season crisis," or a case
of post-Gainesville stress disorder, but
to paraphrase John Lennon, they're not
half the eight-time former NCAA cham
pions they used to be.
Despite wins over Florida, Arizona,
Arizona State and California earlier this
season, it was a different No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (19-2, 5-1 Pacific
10 South) that dropped a 6-3 decision to
the Golden Bears Wednesday, and no
one is more confused with the Cardi
nal's sudden transformation than head
coach Frank Brennan.
"I was as shocked as they were when
we lost," Brennan said. "I was thinking,
'What happened? What did we miss?
Did something fall out of the bus?' I
don't have a feel for it. It's puzzling."
Stanford will need to figure that out
quickly, as the Cardinal hosts No. 10
Arizona and No. 7 Arizona State today
and tomorrow at Stanford Tennis Stadi
um in its last two home dual matches of
the year. Although Stanford handled

1 was as shocked as
they were when we lost.
I was thinking, "What
happened? What did we
miss? Did something fail
out of the bus?" '
— Frank Brennan

the Wildcats and Sun Devils in Arizona
by 7-2 and 5-1 scores, respectively, the
loss to California casts some doubts on
the Cardinal's effectiveness as of late.
"The team that lost at Cal did not
resemble the one that beat Florida at
the Indoors," Brennan said. "We really
have to play tougher, and I think we
also need to play with a little bit more
emotion — we need someone out there
yelling and screaming a bit."
Arizona is led by No. 1 player Alix

Creek, ranked No. 5 in the country in
the latest Intercollegiate Tennis Associ
ation singles poll, while Arizona State's
attack will be spearheaded by Kori
Davidson and Joelle Schad, ranked
25th and 78th in the nation, respective
ly-
"Creek and Kori and very similar
players — they'll just keep pounding
and pounding away at you," said assis
tant coach Lele Forood. "Creek's very
good, but I think Kori's got more
offense — she can hit some really good
forehand winners."
Stanford will start the same six sin
gles players that lost to the Bears on
Wednesday, which means that the Car
dinal will again be without No. 3 Kim
Shasby and No. 6 Amy Chiminello in
the lineup.
Brennan feels that a weekend sweep
of the Arizona schools is vital to restor
ing the Cardinal's confidence as a team
going into the final part of the season.
"These are important matches for us
— they're our last home matches and
they come when we're in the final dash
for a national championship," Brennan

said. "What am I worried about with
these teams? I'm worried we'll lose."
Brennan emphasizes the team's need
to return to its winning ways, and in a
huny.
"They're absolutely capable of beat
ing us unless we get tough out there,"
Brennan said. "There's such a thing as
team chemistry with us, and it's wasn't
there without Shasby and Amy [on
Wednesday). We need to find a way to
get it back."
According to Brennan, one way to do
that is with vocal support from the
crowd at Stanford Tennis Stadium, sup
port which hasn't been as strong as
Brennan would like.
"We really could use a loud cheering
section on Friday," Brennan said.
"That's something we saw at Florida,
and it helped them tremendously. Our
crowd could give us a real boost."
Today's match against Arizona
begins at 1:30 p.m., while tomorrow's
match with Arizona State starts at 11
a.m.
Admission for both of these final
home matches is free.
