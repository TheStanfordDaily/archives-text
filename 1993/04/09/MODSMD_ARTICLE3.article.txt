# Smaller tuition hikes in future
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Hefty tuition hikes dur
ing the last two years may
soon give way to smaller in
creases, Provost Gerald
Lieberman announced at
yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
"Our hope would be that
in the long run ... it would
be inflation plus 2 percent,"
he said in an interview after
the meeting.
Next year's 7.5 percent
tuition hike more than dou
bles the 3 percent inflation
rate.
For two years, the Board
of Trustees has abandoned
a pledge to hold tuition costs down
to inflation plus 1 percent. This
year, tuition went up 9.5 percent.
Lieberman cautioned, howev
er, that the optimistic forecast
does not mean next year's
increase will be low. He was not
sure exactly when smaller hikes
would take effect.
The University's long-range
plan pairs the tuition goal with a
decision to keep faculty salary
increases at this year's rate,

which is inflation plus 1 percent.
Staff pay will rise 0.5 percent
ahead of inflation in the plan,
Lieberman said.
He told the senate that faculty
salaries will go up 4 percent next
year, if the preliminary budget
guidelines are approved by the
trustees next week.
Compared to past annual rais
es "it's a little lower," he admitted
after the meeting. But he added,
"It's very good compared to the
University of California" where
faculty are taking a 5-percent cut.
"How it compares to other
schools remains to be seen,"
Lieberman said.
