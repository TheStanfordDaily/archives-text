# Richards paves way as women golfers take fourth
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Over the past few weeks, the
Stanford women's golf team has
undergone marked improve
ment, finishing fourth in last
month's San Jose State Invita
tional in Monterey, Calif., and
second at the Hawaii Invitation
al in Kaneohe.
Last Sunday, the Cardinal
continued its pattern of
improved play at the PING/ASU
Women's Golf Invitational, held
on the Karsten Golf Course in
Tempe, Ariz., finishing fourth
overall with a team score of 915.
Host Arizona State won the tour
nament with a scor? of 897, and
was followed by San Jose State
(902), USC (909) and UCLA
(915, tied with Stanford).
Senior captain Martha
Richards (73-74-71) put in her
most impressive performance of
the season, winning the individ
ual tournament with a two-over
par 218.
"This is really the first tour
nament where I've played consis
tently well for all three rounds,"
Richards said. "It felt good to
win it, but more importantly,
I'm glad to see myself making
the tough shots."
Sophomore Jamille Jose (77-
76-76) finished 17th overall,
while junior Melinda Daniels
(79-79-76) and freshmen Vicky
Strada (77-75-83) and Julie
Bowen (82-82-82) finished 32nd,
37th and 69th, respectively, in
the individual standings.
Richards played her best golf
during the final six holes, with
birdies on the 13th and 17th.
"When I saw the leaderboard at
15, I noticed I was three behind,
and I just wanted to go out and
post a number. Negative
thoughts never entered my
mind; I was kind of in attack

mode the whole day."
Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin
believes that the final six holes
are six of the most difficult in
women's collegiate golf.
Richards agrees with this evalua
tion.
"The entire back side of the
course was really rough, but I
just hit the ball really well the
whole day," Richards said.
"Eighteen was probably the
toughest finishing hole we've
played all year because of all the
water surrounding the
approach."
Baldwin was particularly
impressed with the progress
Richards has made throughout
the season and her career. "She
has come so far in her golf game,
and she just gets a little better
every tournament," Baldwin
said. "This is the 32nd year of
this tournament. Every player
that has won it has gone on to
quite a career in professional
golf."
After a somewhat mediocre
fall season, the women's golf
team, behind Richards' impres
sive performances, has improved
considerably this spring, moving
from 26th to 10th in the nation
al ranking in the last several
weeks.
Baldwin believes the team is
pointed in the right direction, and
could move to an eighth or ninth
ranking after this tournament.
"For a team that struggled in
the fall, everybody's game is real
ly picking up," Baldwin said.
"The whole team is feeling good
about their play."
"We played really well as a
team. This is by far our best per
formance of the year," Richards
said. "We may have had better
scores at earlier tournaments,
but given the competition arid
the course here, we played our
best golf."
