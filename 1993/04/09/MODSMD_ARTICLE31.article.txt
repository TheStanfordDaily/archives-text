The Stanford track and field team will be
hosting its second annual all-comers meet Sat
urday at noon in Stanford Stadium.
All walk-ons are encouraged to test their
running and throwing prowess against the
likes of Cardinal stars Louise Watson, winner
of the 1992 District-8 cross-country title and
Jen McCormick, a talented transfer in the
throwing events.
On the men's side, Dave Scudamore will be
tough to beat in the distance events, while high
jumper Travis Clark and Stanford's trio of
strong throwers — Pat Stowell, Matt Karse
var, and John Fowler — will offer stiff compe
tition on the field.
"There's a lot of students out there who
were former track stars in high school and
decided not to compete in college," said assis
tant coach Scott Chisam. "This is an opportu
nity for them to get out and run with the var
sity track team."
The meet will begin at 12:30 p.m. with the
men's hammer throw and the women's long
jump, javelin and shotput. On the track, the
3000-meter steeplechase will officially open
the running events at 1 p.m. Overall, there will
be 22 running events and 15 field events.
According to Chisam, the all-comers meet
usually attracts members of the local communi
ty as well. Several community college athletes,
Masters runners, and younger kids show up to
compete each year. Although the event is free for
Stanford students with student identification,
all other participants must pay a $3 entry fee.
Of the 600-700 competitors the meet
attracted last year, several were former Bay
Area Olympians and Stanford professors,
according to Chisam. This year, former Cali
fornia Sen. Alan Cranston has indicated an
interest in running at the meet.
"This is really a unique opportunity for the
students and the members of our community,"
Chisam said. "You can't go out and practice
with Bill Walsh's team, or hit balls with Mark
Marquess' guys, or play hoops with the men's
or women's basketball teams. This is the only
available competition where students can com
pete alongside of varsity athletes."
However, the varsity athletes have other goals
in mind for this "low-key" meet, according to
head coach Vin Lananna. "We've hit a mid-season
stride and this is just a break in the schedule."
Two weeks ago the Cardinal hosted an
intense two-day meet which attracted some of
the nation's most prestigious track and field
teams to the Bay Area. Next week, Stanford will
head to Southern California to compete in the
Mt. SAC Relays, a highly touted and competi
tive invitational at Mt. San Antonio College.
"This weekend will be an in-between meet,"
Lananna said. "First, it's an opportunity for
the team to run at home. Second, it provides
some people another opportunity to make
their Pac-10 qualifying standards. Those
who've already achieved those marks will be
looking to improve on them."
The Pacific 10 Conference Finals are less
than six weeks away, and Chisam believes the
team has already hit the "championship part
of the season." From now until the Pac-10
meet, the Cardinal will be traveling across the
nation to compete in several major meets.
