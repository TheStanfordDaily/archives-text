# Men's tennis on guard approaching Arizona schools

Although the main goal of the
fifth-ranked Cardinal men's ten
nis team is to sharpen up before
No. 2 USC and No. 1 UCLA
come to town next weekend,
they are not about to let this
weekend's series in Arizona go
unnoticed.
"If we let up for a little bit, Ari
zona and Arizona State will beat
us," said Stanford coach Dick
Gould. Tuesday's close call
against Fresno State was a strong
reminder that, unlike Stanford
squads of the past, this year's
team cannot take a single match
for granted.
"I think [Fresno State] was a
good call to arms," Gould said. "It
will remind the guys that we need
to stay focused."
Although the Cardinal (13-3)
easily disposed of the Sun Devils
6-0 and the Wildcats 8-1 over
Spring Break, Stanford had the
homecourt advantage and proba
bly an uncharacteristically easy
match against Arizona.
"[The Arizona players] seemed
real tired," said junior Chris
Cocotos. "I think they can play
better."
Last time, the Cardinal domi
nated the match. Four of the sin

gles matches were won in straight
sets. Only Vimal Pavel, ranked
95th in the nation, needed three
sets to defeat Greg Prudhomme.
Cocotos had Stanford's only loss
to Brandon Hearn 7-6, 6-4. In
doubles, all three Cardinal pairs
swept the competition in straight
sets.
Against Arizona State, only
No. 7 Michael Flanagan needed
three sets to overcome Bruce
Haddad. The rest of Flanagan's
teammates breezed to straight set
victories. Doubles were not
played.
Overall, the Cardinal seems to
be in good position as it enters the
last few weeks of the season. All
players are healthy, including
freshman Jim Thomas, who was
out for several weeks with pulled
stomach muscles.
After weeks of mixing and
matching, Gould seems to have
found a solid set of doubles
teams. No. 29 Flanagan and
Cocotos have been a powerful
pair, despite their different court
styles. Cocotos noted earlier in
the season, "Flanagan gets me a
little more hyped up and I get him
to settle down a little bit."
Next in the lineup is another
pair of juniors, Patel and Robert
Devens (No. 18 in singles), with
whom Gould was especially

impressed last Tuesday. "They
stepped up as a team when they
had to and did an excellent job,"
he said. The pair won its match
quickly in straight sets (6-2, 6-1)
while the other two doubles
teams struggled through three
sets.
At No. 3, freshmen Thomas
and Jeff Salzenstein gained valu
able experience last Tuesday as
well when they found themselves
on the brink of losing in straight
sets, which could have cost Stan
ford the match had Flanagan and
Cocotos also lost.
The freshmen hung on to the
second sei (6-4) and then fought
to a 6-3 victory in the third to
complete the Cardinal sweep of
doubles.
For all three doubles teams,
the match was a reminder of
what next month's NCAA
Championships are all about.
Both Gould and several older
players noted the importance of
doubles, since most matches at
the Athens, Ga. tournament
are decided by the doubles
matches.
"For the freshmen this is a
good taste of what Athens is
like," Flanagan said. "We need
to experience this kind of pres
sure before we get to the real
thing."
