# No. 2 spikers could strike gold in 49er territory
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
For the second-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team, the magic number is two.
Any combination of Cardinal wins plus
Long Beach State losses in the next two
weeks summing to two clinches the Pacific
Division of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation for Stanford. Thus, on this

weekend's trip to Southern California, a
win tonight over the 49ers guarantees
Stanford the division title. If the Cardinal
should fall in tonight's match, it can at
least whittle its magic number down to one
with a win over the USC Trojans on Satur
day.
The fates of Long Beach State and USC
this season have been similar. Both teams
struggled early in the year after being

ranked sixth and fifth, respectively, in the
Volleyball Monthly preseason poll. The
Cardinal contributed to these early season
slumps with a four-game win over the
49ers and a three-game sweep of the Tro
jans. USC slumped so badly that it fell out
of the Volleyball Monthly Top 10.
Lately, however, both teams have begun
to fulfill preseason expectations. The 49ers,
winners of three of their last four — includ
ing a victory over No. 6 Brigham Young —
have climbed to a No. 5 national ranking
with a 13-10 record.
The Trojans have also ridden back into
the national picture, with two victories
over fourth-ranked Cal State Northridge
helping to lift USC to a No. 9 ranking in
Volleyball Monthly and a No. 6 ranking in
the Tachikara Coaches' Poll.
Both team's mid-season recoveries are'
due in part to strategy revisions. Instead of
receiving serve with two players (as Stan
ford does), the 49ers have changed to a
three-player serve receive style, with Zack
Small, their best passer, in the center.
"They made that change because they
want Zack Small handling the ball more,"
said Stanford coach Ruben Nieves.
"Putting Zack in the middle of the court
flanked by two passers makes it a bit hard
er to hit the ball away from him."
Probably the biggest difference between
Long Beach State now and earlier in the
season is the play of opposite hitter Brent
Hilliard. The only men's collegiate volley
ball participant in the 1992 Summer
Games, Hilliard has been recording some
truly Olympian numbers of late. He was
named the MPSF Player of the Week last
week after parlaying 106 swings into 53
kills in a four-game match against BYU.
Hilliard, last year's Player of the Year, was
only two kills off the NCAA record for kills
in a match, held by Cardinal Dave Goss.
Another obstacle between Stanford and
a division title is Long Beach Arena.
"There are so many gyms in our league
that are tough to go into," Nieves said.
"They are hostile environments. Long
Beach may very well be at the top of my
list."
Presently the 49ers are riding a five-

game winning streak at home. Historically,
a trip to Long Beach has meant a hard
fought loss for Stanford.
"Because we've never beaten Long
Beach at Long Beach, it has been a prima
ry goal for many of the players on the
team," said Stanford swing hitter Bob Hill
man. "A victory over Long Beach would be
as satisfying as any victory this year, short
of the national championship."
USC has also made a change to improve
passing. Head coach Jim McLaughlin has
moved top hitter Jason Mulholland from
the opposite position to swing hitter and
put in Dave Derocher at opposite. This
change boosted the hitting output of both
players, as Mulholland has risen to second
in the nation in kills while Derocher is now
14th.
"Mulholland is one of their primary
passers and still hits out of all six rota
tions," Nieves said. "But when they set
Mulholland out of the back row now it's
usually a pipe-set, right down the middle of
the court."
After impressive wins over UC-Irvine
and Pepperdine last weekend, the Cardinal
(15-3, 13-2 MPSF) has put together a nine
game winning streak. Individually, middle
blocker Joe Burghardt continues to lead
the nation with a .584 hitting percentage.
John Hribar's stellar performance last
weekend shot him to eight in the country
with a .462 hitting percentage. Goss holds
down the fourth spot with 6.92 kills-per
game, while Hillman's 2.35 digs-per-game
tie him for 11th in the nation.
