## Hail, hail, I've got no mail...again 
### lan Thorson Staff writer 
Open your mailbox. Face the
black hole. Peer in disbelief. Slam
the door. Rip the key out and take
a few steps away. Tell yourself
that cool people don't write let
ters. They talk on the phone.
The woes of mail at Stanford.
Regardless of the hoopla about
the slothlike-characteristics of
the Stanford Post Office, you still
must face facts. You have no mail.
No friends. No Life. Nothing to
do for 15 minutes before Bio.
Thus, you have no choice but to
theorize about the uniformed
ghost in the postal machine who
left you stranded and letterless.
• Enter: "The Back Door
Theorem." This postulate pro
poses that the back door of

the post office (where the
mail comes in) is real-

ly, really hard to
open. The
postal officers -
need

an eternity to pry it open.
• Enter: "The Back Door
Theorem Part ll.** The back
door only cracks open wide
enough to push one envelope at a
time through it.
• Enter: "The Double Stuff
Postulate." Each student has
two mail boxes — one right
behind the other. The mail goes
into the "holding chamber."
Seven days later a little man
stuffs the goods into your prima
ry mailbox.
• Enter: "The My Box Is
Boarded Up Axiom.** The
postal police don't like you— they
sealed off your box to make your
life miserable.
• Exit: All thoughts of "I get no
mail, I have no life."
Congratulations you
have just

theorized your way out of no
mail-psychomimetics! Now it's
time to put your theories to the
acid test.
• Enter the office. Interview a
minor postal deity. Cut the line
with the Jedi Mind Trick. Lean
over the glass desk. Look at the
name tag.
"Uhh, Gene. I lost my wallet.
What should I do?" You ask.
"Get to the back of the line,"
replies 25 years of postal savvy.
The Force run strong with the
U.S. Postal Service.
Three wrinkles crease your
brow and sixty-two grey hairs
sprout as you wait. The moment
arrives.
"Next, please," Gene cranes
his neck.
"Gene, could I ask you a few
questions?" •
"Sure." He has chosen to for
get your previous visit.

"How long does it take for the
mail to get from the truck to our
boxes?" You asked the big ques
tion, all of your theories teetering
on the brink of destruction.
"It goes up when it comes in."
"The Back Door Theorem"
spontaneously combusts, inciner
ating this week's mail.
"Why do I get all my mail on
Friday?" You counter.
"Some days you get more mail
than others."
"The Double Stuff Postulate"
bursts into flames, burning next
week's mail.
Gene struts away in triumph.
No more theories. How does it
feel? Despondent (a five dollar
word). Try to grapple with a
postal machine with no explana
tions and no ghosts. Existential
ist void.
Some simple advice for ye des
perate souls: get out a pen and
paper and write a friend! They
may even write back!
Editor's note: The writer has
misquoted the postal attendant
because: "Every time the Daily
quotes the post office, they
always get it wrong. It's standard
operating procedure," said Gene
Conroy, mailman at the Stanford
post office, 94309.
