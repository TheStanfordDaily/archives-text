# It's all Greek to me: a look at Rush '93
## 
### 
Rush is a strange beast. For starters, why
the hell is it called "rush"?
It certainly has nothing to do with adrenal
rushes, as far as I know. And baby Moses in
the bulrushes (bullrushers, Huck said) is out.
Maybe it's a head-rush from the constant
release of hot air. Mmm . . . Now the word
"rush" has ceased to sound like English at all.
Try saying it out loud: "Rush, rush, rush."
Ecchh.
Safire-style linguistic criticism notwith
standing, I can't understand why a non-alco
holic ritualized reenactment of a high-school
party has so many people, er, rushing to
attend. The prospect of standing around
drinking slightly warm Sprite with a bunch of
guys I don't know swapping stories of our
drunken pre-Stanford years just isn't that
appealing.
I suppose the free food offerings have
their own following. Those in the know say
the Phi Delts have a lovely snack 'n' dip
spread at their first evening event. And don't
let anyone tell you that EBF members pos
ing as freshmen have never made forays
down the Row during rush to stock up on cut
celery and those crispy little taco rolls you
heat up in the microwave — I've seen it hap
pen. Swear.
But the entire fraternity-rush thing has to
pale in stupidity when compared with what
the women go through. While I realize mine
eyes have never seen the inside of those
white, wind-whipped palaces that gracefully
dot Wilbur Field, rest assured I've heard
more talk in the last two weeks about the
entire hell-borne process than I did about
Amy Fisher's underpants.
Besides, I take pride in the fact that I've
utterly failed to witness a chorus line of

flushed and slightly steaming Tri-Delts twist
"Under the Sea" into a hideous and possibly
illegal energy-boosting musical number.
It boggles the mind that a woman can actu
ally feel that she is in a comfortable and sup
portive environment when crammed like a
Japanese subway rider into a tent for a hard
sell competition that rivals a Time-Life sales
campaign.
Truthfully, that anyone who is actually in a
sorority can fervently speak in favor of anoth
er girl — with whom her only contact has been
a three-minute sound-bite conversation about
nail polish and "how much I love that
bracelet" — says something about the ram
pant insincerity that, if anything, is the hall
mark of the whole process. •
It's no wonder that marketing departments
around the world scramble to hire Greeks for
their sales forces; who else would you want
reassuring the defenseless housewife that
"this is the last pair of pinking shears you'll
ever have to buy"?
But it's not even as if sorority members
believe their rush is the most effective way of
recruiting new members — to hear it told,
most of them detest the rush process more
than the freshwomen. Alpha Phi, you will

note, decided to forego the whole insipid pro
cess this year and rush informally; I have it
on good authority that a certain other soror
ity did the same for a limited number of
women.
So what's the bottom line? We've got a
large number of rushees who are forced to face
the strain of a ridiculously arbitrary process in
order to fulfill some image of how to fit into
the Stanford social order, along with nearly
500 sorority actives who hate the stupid week
even more.
Sounds like a prescription for harmony.
Then, cap the whole experience off with a
bid-acceptance party where the new pledges
earn the enviable right to pull off frat dicks'
boxer shorts with their teeth.
Something, as they say, stinks over at
Wilbur, and it's not the food. Let the call go
out: the sorority rush system needs a Golda
Meir, an Indira Gandhi, someone who can step
in and take control.
Why not create a model sorority rush
that encourages deep conversation, analysis
of the prevalent social order, coming to
grips with the fact that frozen yogurt tastes
like shit, and a return to American family
values?!
Hey, who am I kidding? This is a women's
issue; let them figure it out.
Besides, the sorority-rush lunacy makes
fraternities look good by comparison, and why
refuse a little positive P.R.? If Casper has his
way, we'll need all the help we can get.
Have a good weekend.

Adam Block is generally considered a frat dick
himself. He was lucky enough to be able to
write this at home on a computer that wasn't
slow.
