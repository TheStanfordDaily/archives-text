# With or without a COP? Slates battle over student leadership
## "A Blank Slate" prefers to continue life without COP 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Here we go again.
Just when it appeared as if "A Clean Slate"
would waltz into office unopposed, a group of
write-in candidates for the Council of Presidents
has entered the election fray, pledging to forgo a
COP for a second-straight year.
Waggishly calling themselves "A Blank Slate,"
seniors John Previtali, Jeremy Nelson, Jason Mer
cer and Eddie Lintz are running on essentially the
same platform that carried "I Prefer Not To Have
a COP" to victory last spring.
Unlike Prefer, however, Blank Slate will not at
tempt to amend the ASSU constitution and abolish
the COP altogether.
Previtali said the slate decided to run last week
when "we figured out that there wasn't another
non-COP slate running. It's kind of a travesty for
one party to run unopposed."
"The people running for COP (on A Clean Slate)
are the same ones that were rejected by the stu

dents last year," Nelson said. A Clean Slate is com
posed of Ron Brown, Delia Lopez, Jason Snyder
and Ying-Ying Goh. Brown, Snyder and Lopez pre
viously ran on last year's defeated slate "Indepen
dents: A new era."
Because the deadline to file official candidacy
expired last month, Blank Slate must run as a
write-in option. "This is a grass-roots campaign,"
Mercer said.
Election commissioner Tom Tsao confirmed
that, in keeping with "past precedent," voters will
have to write in both the slate name and the names
of all four members of any unofficial candidates. "I
don't want to give the (ASSU) Senate any excuse
not to ratify this election," he said.
According to Previtali, the slate is concerned
with reform of the ASSU and maintains that the
members of the COP are "figureheads."
A victory by A Blank Slate would "force a re
evaluation of government," Nelson said. "I think
the ASSU tried to get away with an interim system
this year, assuming that this
year they would go back to the
status quo. We want the whole
system redone."
He added that those running
on the Clean Slate "are the polit
ical establishment. They're the
future civil servants of Ameri
ca." Brown is currently senate
chair and Goh is an undergradu
ate senator.
Previtali said he hopes "peo
ple realize that this year, with
out a COP, there weren't any
bad consequences," he said. Nel
son added that projects such as
ASSU Lecture Notes and SURE
Escort Service survived without
the COP.
While they are pressing for
across-the-board reform in stu
dent government, Blank Slate
members contend that the ASSU
Senate is a better representative
of the electorate than the COP.
"The way the ASSU govern

ment works is that the Senate,
as a large body, represents a lot
of the constituency," Nelson
said. "The senators have agen
das, too. In committee form,
they are far more powerful than
the COP."
Mercer argued that a COP
can obstruct, rather than
enhance, student interests. "The
Stanford community is diverse
enough that four students are
not capable of representing all
student interests," he said.
And, according to Lintz: "The
COP perpetuates a static gov
ernment. It perpetuates student
reliance on government and
increases stasis, molasses."
But while the Blank Slate
talks change and progress, their
political success largely depends
on the creeping disinterest in
student politics.
The slate's campaign slogan,
for example, exhorts voters to
"carry on the proud tradition of
political apathy at Stanford."
Such an appeal, perhaps,
reflects the long odds that face
the Blank Slate. No write-in can

didate has ever won the COP
election.
The slate is also battling the
election clock.
With less than a week left
before voters hit the ballot box
Thursday, the slate is asking for
volunteers to help launch the
publicity blitz needed to chal
lenge the politically recognizable
Clean Slate.
Blank may further be hurt by
the fact that only Mercer, who
has been accepted as a cotermi
nal student, will be on campus
next year.
However, Previtali said the
Blank Slate yesterday received
the endorsement of the Stanford
Libertarians.
And he hopes to organize a
public debate Monday between
the two slates.
Despite the uphill struggle
ahead of them, members of "A
Blank Slate" remain optimistic,
especially with Prefer's legacy
on their side.
"I think we've got a very good
chance," Mercer said. "We are
the incumbents."
