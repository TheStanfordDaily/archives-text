# With or without a COP? Slates battle over student leadership
## "A Blank Slate" prefers to continue life without COP

Here we go again.
Just when it appeared as if "A Clean Slate"
would waltz into office unopposed, a group of
write-in candidates for the Council of Presidents
has entered the election fray, pledging to forgo a
COP for a second-straight year.
Waggishly calling themselves "A Blank Slate,"
seniors John Previtali, Jeremy Nelson, Jason Mer

have to write in both the slate name and the names
of all four members of any unofficial candidates. "I

not to ratify this election," he said.
According to Previtali, the slate is concerned
with reform of the ASSU and maintains that the
members of the COP are "figureheads."
A victory by A Blank Slate would "force a re
evaluation of government," Nelson said. "I think
the ASSU tried to get away with an interim system
