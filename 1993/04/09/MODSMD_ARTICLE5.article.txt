# "A Clean Slate" offers to lead without salaries

### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The Clean Slate has pledged to knock on every
Brannerite's door if elected.
But more communication with students isn't the
only thing the Council of Presidents slate intends to
accomplish.
As the only slate officially on the ballot in the
ASSU elections this year, "A Clean Slate: Salaries
Not Included" is planning to change the University
by tackling issues including summer storage, finan
cial aid and graduate housing.
ASSU Senate Chair Ron Brown, undergraduate
senator Ying-Ying Goh, Delia L6pez and Jason Sny
der make up the slate which promises to reintroduce
student input to the University's decision-making
process.
"It's critical that students' voices are heard at all
levels of the University," Snyder said. "This election
is basically between a slate that would create a lack of
representation and one that would represent stu
dents for free."

As part of their campaign, the Clean Slate is not
asking for the traditional salary paid to the COP.
Each member of last year's COP received $4,000.
By voting to have no COP, "students spoke out
and said they shouldn't have salaries," said Goh. The
Clean Slate is simply following the will of the stu
dents, she said.
The methods to improve communication proposed
by the Clean Slate include walking door-to-door in
residences and holding town meetings where stu
dents would discuss issues of importance to them.
"We also want to bring members of the adminis
tration to residences to talk to students," said Lopez.
"This is a time when students aren't as energized
about the ASSU," Snyder added. "We want to make
sure that students have input into what student gov
ernment does."
The slate also intends to focus in on particular is
sues that affect both undergraduate and graduate
students. "It's important that both are treated equal
ly and effectively," Snyder said.
Summer storage and financial
aid are among the major under
graduate issues that the Clean
Slate seeks to address.
With the storage issue, "it's a
matter of getting a business pro
posal written up," said Goh.
"We're working on it right now —
we're also making sure that the
University has enough space" for
storage facilities.
"We will have to work with the
University on that issue," she
added. "That is key — we need to
have a COP that can work with
the administration as well as the
students. That link must be
established for the ASSU to be
effective."
On financial aid, the slate
wants to keep the self-help level
— the minimum amount of
tuition that must be paid by stu
dents themselves — to a manage
able level.
"We want to work closely with

the Financial Aids Office," said
Snyder. "The COP can be particu
larly effective in lobbying against
tuition hikes. It can act as a voice
for the students."
Brown pointed out the dangers
of cutting financial aid, saying
that "increased self-help levels
stop people from wanting to come
here to school."
"They also limit diversity,"
added Snyder. "I think it's critical
that we address this issue as soon
as possible."
In addition to undergraduate
issues, the Clean Slate stressed
that they want to reach out to
graduate students.
"It's tough because we couldn't
put a graduate student on our
slate," said Goh. "We're going to
go out and find ways we can help
graduate students on their issues
next year."
"The ASSU usually neglects
graduate students," said Brown.
"We plan to change that."
Issues like equality of special
fees and graduate housing are in
the slate's platform alongside the
more traditional undergraduate

emphasis.
"If you look at the list of recip
ients of special fees, undergradu
ates consume a much greater
share," Brown explained. "But
graduates pay the same amount
to the ASSU."
The slate is even willing to look
at the possibility of a complete
restructuring of relations
between graduate students and
the ASSU.
"We don't want to close our
selves to changing the ASSU,"
Snyder said. "We may need a task
force on whether graduates even
want to be in the ASSU."
If the Clean Slate wants to turn
around the apathy of this year, all
of its members agree that a great
deal of effort will be required. All
that remains now is for the stu
dents to make their decision.
"In general, looking at the race
as it is now, I think students have
an opportunity to show that stu
dents at Stanford want action
rather than apathy," said Brown.
"If students are concerned about
what happens here, I can only hope
they make that clear in their votes."
