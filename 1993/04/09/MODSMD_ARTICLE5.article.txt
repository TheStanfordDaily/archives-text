# "A Clean Slate" offers to lead without salaries

The Clean Slate has pledged to knock on every
Brannerite's door if elected.
But more communication with students isn't the
only thing the Council of Presidents slate intends to
accomplish.
As the only slate officially on the ballot in the
ASSU elections this year, "A Clean Slate: Salaries
Not Included" is planning to change the University
by tackling issues including summer storage, finan
cial aid and graduate housing.
ASSU Senate Chair Ron Brown, undergraduate
senator Ying-Ying Goh, Delia L6pez and Jason Sny
der make up the slate which promises to reintroduce
student input to the University's decision-making
process.
"It's critical that students' voices are heard at all
levels of the University," Snyder said. "This election
is basically between a slate that would create a lack of
representation and one that would represent stu
dents for free."

As part of their campaign, the Clean Slate is not
asking for the traditional salary paid to the COP.
Each member of last year's COP received $4,000.
By voting to have no COP, "students spoke out
and said they shouldn't have salaries," said Goh. The
Clean Slate is simply following the will of the stu
dents, she said.
The methods to improve communication proposed
by the Clean Slate include walking door-to-door in
residences and holding town meetings where stu
dents would discuss issues of importance to them.
"We also want to bring members of the adminis
tration to residences to talk to students," said Lopez.
"This is a time when students aren't as energized
about the ASSU," Snyder added. "We want to make
sure that students have input into what student gov
ernment does."
The slate also intends to focus in on particular is
sues that affect both undergraduate and graduate
students. "It's important that both are treated equal
ly and effectively," Snyder said.
