# Prying eyes? Private e-mail messages are accessible to network administrators

If telephone operators were able to listen
in and record every phone conversation
that went through their switchboards,
most people would probably feel their pri
vacy was being violated.
In a similar way though, that is how the
University's electronic mail system works:
every message that remains on the network
for more than 24 hours is recorded and
then stored for a year, and network admin
istrators have easy access to these mes
sages.
But work has started on implementing
new systems that will resolve many privacy
problems, according to Dennis Michael, the
system administrator for the University's
e-mail network.
Three new systems are in development,
he said, to address three major security
problems: the issue of backups, administra
tors' access and password cracking.
Necessary backups
The University's e-mail system is de
signed to make a backup and store mes
sages for a year — even those that are later
deleted — that have been on the network
for more than 24 hours, Michael said.
It is a necessity, Michael said, because of
the system's computer format. Occasional
ly, the data on one or two of the hard disks
that run the e-mail network are lost each
year due to events such as power shortages,
fires and disk failures caused by mechanical
aging.
Michael said no exceptions could be
made for individuals who do not want back
ups made, because it would be too compli
cated to ask each one of the 17,000 users if

he or she wanted a backup. Everything is
automatically copied, regardless of the in
formation and user, he said.
Theoretically, he said, someone could
gain access to e-mail files by going to the
Center for Educational Research at Stan
ford, where the backups are stored.
However, he emphasized that the files
are very secure — only the system adminis
trators, the fire department and the police
department have the authority to access
the equipment.
And this summer, he added, a new sys-
