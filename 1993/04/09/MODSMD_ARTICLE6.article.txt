# Prying eyes? Private e-mail messages are accessible to network administrators
## 
### Ajai Chari Staff writer 
If telephone operators were able to listen
in and record every phone conversation
that went through their switchboards,
most people would probably feel their pri
vacy was being violated.
In a similar way though, that is how the
University's electronic mail system works:
every message that remains on the network
for more than 24 hours is recorded and
then stored for a year, and network admin
istrators have easy access to these mes
sages.
But work has started on implementing
new systems that will resolve many privacy
problems, according to Dennis Michael, the
system administrator for the University's
e-mail network.
Three new systems are in development,
he said, to address three major security
problems: the issue of backups, administra
tors' access and password cracking.
Necessary backups
The University's e-mail system is de
signed to make a backup and store mes
sages for a year — even those that are later
deleted — that have been on the network
for more than 24 hours, Michael said.
It is a necessity, Michael said, because of
the system's computer format. Occasional
ly, the data on one or two of the hard disks
that run the e-mail network are lost each
year due to events such as power shortages,
fires and disk failures caused by mechanical
aging.
Michael said no exceptions could be
made for individuals who do not want back
ups made, because it would be too compli
cated to ask each one of the 17,000 users if

he or she wanted a backup. Everything is
automatically copied, regardless of the in
formation and user, he said.
Theoretically, he said, someone could
gain access to e-mail files by going to the
Center for Educational Research at Stan
ford, where the backups are stored.
However, he emphasized that the files
are very secure — only the system adminis
trators, the fire department and the police
department have the authority to access
the equipment.
And this summer, he added, a new sys-
tem will be installed that will
eliminate the need for backups,
because the redesigned e-mail
computer will contain five disk
drives. The information will be
written onto the five disks in such
a way that if one disk were lost, it
could easily be replaced with one
of the other disks, he said.
Staff access to files
The four members of the
Leland system's administrative
staff have complete access to all of
the e-mail files.
The e-mail system the Univer
sity uses was originally intended
for text processing and document
preparation, not e-mail, Michael
said. With the original design, the
network's "root" users have com
plete access and control.
"System administrators are
generally next to God," said
Dwayne Virnau, the consulting
coordinator for academic comput

ing support.
But a new system, which takes
out the all-powerful administra
tive role and only allows users
access to their files, is in the
works, though, Michael said.
However, he added that
because it is being done through a
process called encryption —
which is very technically detailed
and requires a great deal of the
system's resources — it may take
a year or two before the imple
mentation of the new system.
In the meantime, though, Uni
versity regulations require that
system administrators who
access an account read only the
message headers — which con
tain information such as whom
the message is from, and the date
and time the message was
received — and not the specific
contents of a message.
If the administrators need to
see a file, they must first inform
the user.
"I have never read mail and
make it a point not to read mail
because I think it is unethical,"
Michael said, adding that he

would fire anyone on his staff
caught reading e-mail without
permission.
Cracking the password
The security problem that
most e-mail users probably hear
about, though, is password crack
ing.
When users initially open
accounts, they receive a mail file,
which is a partition of the entire
computer system's mailbox.
Access to the mail file and all
other files in an account is
restricted to the user, who selects
a user name and a password.
Until recently, password
cracking presented a considerable
problem, because of the setup of
the security system, Michael said.
When a user logged on, the
password entered would be
encrypted and compared to the
main file containing the list of all
the encrypted passwords avail
able.
But because the main file was
on the same machine as the com
puter users logged onto, once a
hacker guessed a password, he or

she had essentially cracked the
code and would have access to all
the passwords on the Leland sys
tem.
To prevent this from happen
ing, Michael's group put their
fastest machine to work guessing
passwords to stay ahead of the
password crackers. Using a pro
cedure like the one used by the
many hackers, the machine
would enter every word from dic
tionaries in several languages,
such as English, Spanish,
French, Chinese, Japanese, Kore
an, German, Italian and even
slang.
The guess would be encrypted
and compared to the list of possi
ble passwords, and if a match
occurred, the account would be
frozen and the user would be con
tacted.
However, about six months
ago, a new security system devel
oped at MIT, known as Kerberos,
was implemented. Michael said
the security risk is less now,
because the file of encrypted pass
words is no longer stored in the
same machine as the computer

users log onto.
His group is also considering a
password aging scheme, in which
users would be forced to guess
new passwords after a certain
period of time. Passwords are still
periodically checked, but guide
lines for e-mail privacy suggest
that users select passwords that
are unrelated to the user name,
not all numbers and not a word in
any language.
But much of the unwanted
access is simply due to users' own
negligence. Every day, Virnau
said, there are always several peo
ple who leave their computers
without logging out, leaving their
account open for others to read.
Some users also give their
passwords out to friends without
thinking of the consequences.
And others simply choose pass
words that are easily guessed by
hackers trying to break into the
system.
Just another document
In most other ways though, e
mail — and any other informa
tion stored electronically — is

treated as just another document.
Unlike recorded conversations,
e-mail is as "discoverable" as files
stored on paper, according to
Assoc. University Counsel Robin
Kennedy.
During the discovery phase of
a lawsuit, parties request evi
dence from each other. Unless a
certain privilege, such as the
attorney-client one, allows a
party to withhold some evidence,
the party is obliged to present all
relevant information.
Since e-mail is so commonly
used in academic circles,
Kennedy said that the University
has presented it as evidence in
many cases. She cited an anti
trust suit filed against several Ivy
League schools for fixing tuition
prices where e-mail was subpoe
naed because administrators at
those institutions often commu
nicated with each other via e
mail.
However, Kennedy said she
could not recall a single case in
which Stanford had to obtain a
subpoena to examine a student's
e-mail.
If telephone operators were able to listen
in and record every phone conversation
that went through their switchboards,
most people would probably feel their pri
vacy was being violated.

of the other disks, he said.
Staff access to files
The four members of the
Leland system's administrative
staff have complete access to all of
the e-mail files.
The e-mail system the Univer
sity uses was originally intended
for text processing and document
preparation, not e-mail, Michael
said. With the original design, the
network's "root" users have com
plete access and control.
"System administrators are
generally next to God," said
Dwayne Virnau, the consulting
coordinator for academic comput

ing support.
But a new system, which takes
out the all-powerful administra
tive role and only allows users
access to their files, is in the
works, though, Michael said.
However, he added that
because it is being done through a
process called encryption —
which is very technically detailed
and requires a great deal of the
system's resources — it may take
a year or two before the imple
mentation of the new system.
In the meantime, though, Uni
versity regulations require that
system administrators who
access an account read only the
message headers — which con
tain information such as whom
the message is from, and the date
and time the message was
received — and not the specific
contents of a message.
If the administrators need to
see a file, they must first inform
the user.
"I have never read mail and
make it a point not to read mail
because I think it is unethical,"
Michael said, adding that he

would fire anyone on his staff
caught reading e-mail without
permission.
Cracking the password
The security problem that
most e-mail users probably hear
about, though, is password crack
ing.
When users initially open
accounts, they receive a mail file,
which is a partition of the entire
computer system's mailbox.
Access to the mail file and all
other files in an account is
restricted to the user, who selects
a user name and a password.
Until recently, password
cracking presented a considerable
problem, because of the setup of
the security system, Michael said.
When a user logged on, the
password entered would be
encrypted and compared to the
main file containing the list of all
the encrypted passwords avail
able.
But because the main file was
on the same machine as the com
puter users logged onto, once a
hacker guessed a password, he or

she had essentially cracked the
code and would have access to all
the passwords on the Leland sys
tem.
To prevent this from happen
ing, Michael's group put their
fastest machine to work guessing
passwords to stay ahead of the
password crackers. Using a pro
cedure like the one used by the
many hackers, the machine
would enter every word from dic
tionaries in several languages,
such as English, Spanish,
French, Chinese, Japanese, Kore
an, German, Italian and even
slang.
The guess would be encrypted
and compared to the list of possi
ble passwords, and if a match
occurred, the account would be
frozen and the user would be con
tacted.
However, about six months
ago, a new security system devel
oped at MIT, known as Kerberos,
was implemented. Michael said
the security risk is less now,
because the file of encrypted pass
words is no longer stored in the
same machine as the computer

users log onto.
His group is also considering a
password aging scheme, in which
users would be forced to guess
new passwords after a certain
period of time. Passwords are still
periodically checked, but guide
lines for e-mail privacy suggest
that users select passwords that
are unrelated to the user name,
not all numbers and not a word in
any language.
But much of the unwanted
access is simply due to users' own
negligence. Every day, Virnau
said, there are always several peo
ple who leave their computers
without logging out, leaving their
account open for others to read.
Some users also give their
passwords out to friends without
thinking of the consequences.
And others simply choose pass
words that are easily guessed by
hackers trying to break into the
system.
Just another document
In most other ways though, e
mail — and any other informa
tion stored electronically — is

treated as just another document.
Unlike recorded conversations,
e-mail is as "discoverable" as files
stored on paper, according to
Assoc. University Counsel Robin
Kennedy.
During the discovery phase of
a lawsuit, parties request evi
dence from each other. Unless a
certain privilege, such as the
attorney-client one, allows a
party to withhold some evidence,
the party is obliged to present all
relevant information.
Since e-mail is so commonly
used in academic circles,
Kennedy said that the University
has presented it as evidence in
many cases. She cited an anti
trust suit filed against several Ivy
League schools for fixing tuition
prices where e-mail was subpoe
naed because administrators at
those institutions often commu
nicated with each other via e
mail.
However, Kennedy said she
could not recall a single case in
which Stanford had to obtain a
subpoena to examine a student's
e-mail.
If telephone operators were able to listen
in and record every phone conversation
that went through their switchboards,
most people would probably feel their pri
vacy was being violated.
In a similar way though, that is how the
University's electronic mail system works:
every message that remains on the network
for more than 24 hours is recorded and
then stored for a year, and network admin
istrators have easy access to these mes
sages.
But work has started on implementing
new systems that will resolve many privacy
problems, according to Dennis Michael, the
system administrator for the University's
e-mail network.
Three new systems are in development,
he said, to address three major security
problems: the issue of backups, administra
tors' access and password cracking.
Necessary backups
The University's e-mail system is de
signed to make a backup and store mes
sages for a year — even those that are later
deleted — that have been on the network
for more than 24 hours, Michael said.
It is a necessity, Michael said, because of
the system's computer format. Occasional
ly, the data on one or two of the hard disks
that run the e-mail network are lost each
year due to events such as power shortages,
fires and disk failures caused by mechanical
aging.
Michael said no exceptions could be
made for individuals who do not want back
ups made, because it would be too compli
cated to ask each one of the 17,000 users if

he or she wanted a backup. Everything is
automatically copied, regardless of the in
formation and user, he said.
Theoretically, he said, someone could
gain access to e-mail files by going to the
Center for Educational Research at Stan
ford, where the backups are stored.
However, he emphasized that the files
are very secure — only the system adminis
trators, the fire department and the police
department have the authority to access
the equipment.
And this summer, he added, a new sys-
tem will be installed that will
eliminate the need for backups,
because the redesigned e-mail
computer will contain five disk
drives. The information will be
written onto the five disks in such
a way that if one disk were lost, it
could easily be replaced with one
of the other disks, he said.

Leland system's administrative
