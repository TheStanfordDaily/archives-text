# Harassing e-mail: heavy breathers go high-tech
## 
### Ajai Chari Staff writer 
At first, "Robert" disregarded
derogatory comments about his sister
sent to him through electronic mail as
a stupid joke.
"I hear Asian women can be real ex
otic. Remember all those Vietnam
movies and the soldiers with their
prostitutes, but I digress," said the
message he received last February.
"Is she easy, or will I have to get her
drunk first?"
Initially, Robert said he was angry,
but decided it was not worth making a
formal complaint because he thought
the messages were just an imma
ture prank. Instead, knowing
that the message came from
another university, he contacted
an acquaintance at that school
in an attempt to find out what
was going on.
Last week, he received anoth
er message. "Hey you pathetic
little Asian. What's going on
here? I spend valuable time
thinking up an e-mail joke, and
you take a hissy-fit. My God,
how anal," read the note on his
computer screen. "P.P.S. The
only difference between your sis
ter and a 747 is that not every
one has been on a 747."
This time, Robert decided to
contact Dennis Michael, Univer
sity's e-mail system administra
tor. However, Michael said there
was little he could do, since the
sender was not a Stanford stu
dent.
He suggested that Robert
write to the other university's e
mail administrator. Robert fol
lowed Michael's advice and was
told that the matter is being
looked into.

"I don't want to have [the
harasserj expelled. I'm not par
ticularly vindictive," Robert
said. "I just wanted it to stop."
Fortunately for most people
at Stanford who are harassed by
e-mail messages, such cases are
easily resolved.
Unlike those who make
threatening phone calls or send
hate mail, harassers are easy to
track down because the system
keeps a record of the time, place
and user name of each person
who sends e-mail on the Univer
sity network.
And although the University
receives up to one complaint of e
mail harassment a month,
administrators have not yet had
to resort to legal action to resolve
the problem, Michael said.
Michael's first step when he
receives a complaint is to deter
mine if the message in question
constitutes harassment — in his
definition, if it is "personal com
munication to a single individu
al, of a threatening nature."
If he thinks it does, Michael
then checks the e-mail system's
records to see who actually sent
the messages. The accused indi
vidual's account is frozen and is
questioned about why he or she
sent the mail.

After the questioning,
Michael then makes a determi
nation about the level of harass
ment — if the person "deliber
ately harassed, did so without
meaning to, or did so in a fit of
passion."
Most people fall into the cate
gory of "did so without meaning
to," Michael said, and generally
stop sending the messages after
they are notified.
If the accused individual
denies sending the message,
Michael presents the mail logs to
him or her. If the individual still
denies it, he asks that person to
change their password, telling
him or her that he expects to see
no more harassing mail from the
account.
If more harassing mail comes
from the account after the pass
word change, Michael said he
then contacts Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole.
According to Cole, e-mail
harassment is treated like other
forms of harassment, with the
same penalties. Each year, 20
percent of Fundamental Stan
dard and Honor Code cases deal
with computers, she said.
Most e-mail harassment
cases, however, are resolved at
the computing facilities level,

Cole said.
In all the harassment cases
he has dealt with, though,
Michael said no one has ever
denied sending the messages, so
it has never been necessary for a
victim to obtain a court order to
monitor the accused person's
activities.
Typically, he said, students
sending the messages are
unaware that their actions are
considered harassment and stop
sending them once they are noti
fied.
For example, Michael said
one male student searched the
computer network to see if any
women were logged on and sent
them statements such as "I'm
looking at you now." The
women, who were often alone
at night, felt threatened by
such messages, he said. The
student stopped sending the
messages after a warning from
Michael.
Deliberate harassment,
though, is punished, in the same
way other harassment cases are.
In one case, a female student
was suspended for two quarters
after repeatedly harassing a
male student with whom she
had been romantically involved,
Cole said.
