stitution Senior Fellow Joseph Stiglitz,
Prof. William Perry and former trustee

ted off to Washington to advise President
Clinton on issues ranging from education
to economics.
But more Clinton advisors may be
lurking on campus, at the Haas Center for

Public Service.
Formed by a handful of students in No
vember, the Stanford Project on National
Service has been attracting national at
tention for its work in providing a non
partisan forum for college students and
community organizations to advise the
new administration on public-service pol
icy.
"SPONS is a college voice, a youth

Dave Kuhn, chair of the Stanford Program on National Service, said he founded
the group because he believes "a youth voice" can make a difference in national
politics.
voice," said sophomore Dave Kuhn,
founder and chair of the 16-mem
ber organization. "And the admin
istration is affected by a youth
voice (on this issue)."
Making connections
In a recent speech at Rutgers
University, Clinton proposed a ser
vice program that would allow stu
dents to repay federal financial-aid
loans by performing community
service in arenas such as education
and law enforcement for one to two
years.
Given the president's general
proposal and his call for local lead
ership and creative energy in plan
ning such a program, SPONS and
other student service organizations
may prove influential in future pol

icy making.
SPONS has focused on estab
lishing a system of communication
between itself, student service
groups on different college campus
es and local community service
organizations, said Anoop
Prakash, the group's publicity
director.
By achieving a network between
these three sections of the popula
tion, "SPONS will give people from
diverse backgrounds a voice," said
Linda Cheu, the Haas Center's vol
unteer coordinator and a SPONS
staff advisor. She noted that youth
and community voices are often
ignored when issues of national
service are addressed.
A communication network
would also provide these groups
with the chance to get into the
details of Clinton's plans, said
Cheu, pointing out that the govern
ment has yet to publicize a specific
proposal of the scholarship-for-ser

vice plan.
Working with these issues in
mind, SPONS joined forces with a
national organization called the
Young People for National Service.
Together, the two groups devel
oped a plan to hold a series of 13
conferences on Clinton's proposal
across the country, explained
Kuhn.
Beginning in Washington, D.C.
at the end of March, the series will
culminate at Stanford on April 25.
At the Stanford conference, tenta
tively scheduled speakers include
State Sen. Nicholas Petris and for
mer Stanford multicultural educa
tor Greg Ricks, who is currently
working at a Boston community
service organization that has estab
lished a small-scale scholarship
for-service program.
According to Kuhn and Prakash,
each conference shares several
common goals: to establish a basis
for future working relationships

between students and community
members, to encourage delegates
from other colleges to form their
own SPONS-like programs, and to
create a national service proposal to
present to interested lawmakers.
Humble beginnings
Asking any of the 16-odd mem
bers how the group grew from one
student's brainchild to a nationally
recognized organization in just five
months elicits a grin of pride.
Kuhn said he remembers
attending the Haas Center retreat
early last fall and deciding to orga
nize a group to help make Clinton's
fledgling plan a reality.
"I guess I'm an idealistic, naive
person," said Kuhn, referring to
his decision to aggressively pursue
this cause at a time when its main
proponent was still battling to be
elected.
With the help of Cheu, Kuhn
held the first SPONS meeting in a

dorm room with about six other
students. The group adopted its
name from a defunct organization,
also called SPONS, which worked
for the passage of the National
Community Service Act of 1990
and disbanded shortly after the leg
islation passed.
Despite the large amount of
work that is left before they draft a
proposal and ship it off to the Oval
Office, members of SPONS already
feel a sense of success from their
efforts to coordinate the confer
ences.
"For a group that's just started,
we have connections all over the
country," said Prakash. "The great
thing is, the best publicity we've
had is that we're mentioned by
these national groups," including
service organizations like the Unit
ed States Student Association.
SPONS National Coordinator
Roopal Mehta, a senior, said she
believes a sense of urgency con

tributed to the organization's suc
cess. "As soon as Clinton acted, we
did," she said. "Even before he was
inaugurated we could have handed
in paperwork to him lon the pro
posal!."
Cheu explained, "These stu
dents are extremely committed.
It's not uncommon to see a few of
them here every day."
The experiences they gain now
will help SPONS members tackle
future projects and problems. "Our
biggest challenge lies after the con
ference," said Kuhn. The organiza
tion plans to narrow its scope and
perhaps draw up a community ser
vice proposal exclusive to the Stan
ford community.
According to Kuhn, it is also con
sidering a campus publicity drive to
increase awareness about Clinton's
scholarship-for-service plan.
"The idea is something that res
onates with people," he said. "It
makes sense."
