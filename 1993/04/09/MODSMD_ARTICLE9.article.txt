Featuring everything from a
"Pink Party" in White Plaza to a
Queer Big Game, the annual Bi
sexual, Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Days, or BGLAD, begins
Monday.
With a wide variety of events
scheduled, BGLAD organizers
hope to combine "a discussion of
issues with pure fun," according
to co-chair Bobbi Bernstein, a law
student.
One issue highlighted next
week will be the widely publicized
debate over homosexuals in the
military. Keynote speaker Sgt.
Perry Watkins, discharged from
the Army after 16 years for being
gay, will address the issue Tues
day night.
And a military panel — includ
ing Watkins and Keith Meinhold,
the only gay service member ac
knowledged by the military —
will also tackle this issue Wednes
day evening in Branner Hall.
The week's primary purpose is
to "celebrate our identity as gay,
lesbian or bisexual students,"
Bernstein said, adding that
BGLAD hopes to "instill gay
pride and affirm the queer com
munity."
She said the events will also
help activists gear up for the April
25 Gay Pride March in Washing
ton, D.C.
Other speakers during the
week include Stanford alumnus
Michael GofT, founder and editor
of Out! magazine and English
Prof. Terry Castle.
Panel discussions in dorms, a
comedy night at the Coffee
House and a Sunday afternoon
picnic will also be featured. Even
Sunday Flicks will feature a
short film with a gay theme this
week.
Cowell Student Health Center
will also host a panel on issues of
well-being in the gay community,

addressing medical and psy
chosocial questions. Dr. Dee Mos
bacher will show her film "Les
bian Physicians on Practice,
Patients and Power" and hold a
discussion about gays in
medicine.
A core group of about 18 grad
uate and undergraduate students
have been planning the week's
events since fall quarter. Bern
stein said they hope the events
and speakers will create "a fun
week for gay, lesbian and bisexu
al students, which includes being
inspired by people in the queer
community, educating other peo
ple and being visible."
