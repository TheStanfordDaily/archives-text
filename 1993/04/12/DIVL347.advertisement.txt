Our goal? To help buy 1,000,000 meals*
for America's hungry. And you can take part
just by using the American Express Card.
You see, each time you charge a purchase to the Card
between March 15 and April 30,1993, you help pay for one meal.
The more purchases you make, no matter how big or small,
the more meals you help provide. It's that simple.
To make it all work, we've teamed up with Share Our
Strength, a nationwide non-profit organization fighting to
end hunger. They're doing it in some very resourceful ways.
For example, most restaurants have extra food at the end
of the night, but they don't always know what to do with it.
Now each time you
use the Card, you help
buy a meal for
a hungry person.
SOS does. They see to it that the food is deliv
ered to those who need it. In fact, they've
mobilized more than 5000 restaurants to join
the fight against hunger, here in the U.S. and around the world.
So remember, now one of the most valuable reasons to use
the Card isn't for what you can get, but for what you give.
If you're not currently a Cardmember, but would like to
apply, please call us at 1-800-365-AMEX.
The American Express® Card.
When you reach for it, you reach out to help others.
•American Express will donate $ 09 per transaction, up to $90,000, a maximum
of 1,000,000 meals. Donation is not deductible for income tax purposes.
