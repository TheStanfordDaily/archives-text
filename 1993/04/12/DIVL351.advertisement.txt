Julie Dash Speaks...
Writer/director of
Daughters of the Dust
"Julie Dash is one of our most important
filmmakers of the '90's. Her breadth of vision,
insight, and ability to capture and personify
the African American experience is
remarkable, if not downright uncommon.
She is an uncompromising artist (hallelujah!)
who didn't sell a dream for less than it's
worth. Daughters is a film whose power
emanates in such an organic manner that its
beauty seduces you, overwhelms you . We
need the visual miracles of Julie Dash's scope
to flourish as long as possible. Hollywood
won't be able to ignore her, because we won't
let them. McMiUan
