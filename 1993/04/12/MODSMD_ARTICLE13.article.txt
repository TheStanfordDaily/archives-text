Not even Mother Nature could
stop Sorority Rush.
In spite of heavy rain and an
electrical failure in the six tents
on Wilbur Field, Rush, which
ended last week, "went pretty
smoothly overall," said Rush co
chair Preeti Malladi.
According to Malladi, 150 of
the 250 women who started Rush
accepted bids to sororities partici
pating in formal rush.
Approximately 10 women who
completed the entire Rush pro
cess did not receive bids, Malladi
said, adding that the number was
about average compared with pre
vious years.
"There always ends up being a
limited number of women who do
not receive bids. We try to limit
that as much possible," she said.

Activities, noted that there are
typically a few women who indi
cate only one preference during
the bid process — known by stu
dents as "suiciding" — thereby
reducing their chances of receiv
ing a bid. Howe, who has advised
sororities for two years, said
between five and 15 women in any
given year do not receive bids.
Malladi stressed that the fig
ures were subject to change.
Sororities that are "under ceiling"
— that is, they have not filled the
80-member quota mandated by
the University — can continue to
offer bids into the next school
year. Chi Omega and Delta
Gamma are now under ceiling,
according to Malladi.
The names of rushees who
dropped out or did not receive
bids are given to sororities that
are below their membership
quota, and these sororities can
informally offer bids to these stu
dents.

Although the sororities were
able to cope with this year's
weather-related difficulties, Mal
ladi said she hopes that sororities
will be able to avoid future prob
lems by relocating Rush.
"We're trying to see if we can
push to have Rush someplace
other than tents because then we
don't have to deal with generators
or the weather conditions," she
said. "If we plan ahead, maybe we
can have Rush in rooms across
campus."
Heavy rain on one of the nights
disrupted the electric generators
that lighted the tents, forcing two
Rush parties to be pushed over to
the following night.
The sororities which partici
pated in formal rush were: Chi
Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi
Beta Phi. Alpha Phi decided not
to participate in formal rush
this year.
