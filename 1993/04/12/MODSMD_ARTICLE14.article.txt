2 killed after Hani's death
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)
— Two whites were burned to death by a
black crowd and a third had part of his
tongue cut out despite appeals for calm
yesterday, a day after the assassination of
popular African National Congress offi
cial Chris Hani. A white man has been
arrested in Hani's killing.
The three white men had driven into
Lwandli black township outside Cape
Town to buy beer when their two vehicles
were stoned and set afire by a crowd,
police said. Police said two were killed and
one injured. A fourth white man escaped.
Police did not know whether the
attack was in reprisal for Hani's assassi
nation Saturday.
At a news conference yesterday, the
ANC said Hani's death should inspire

political parties to work more fervently
for a peaceful end to apartheid.
Inmates riot in Ohio prison
LUCASVILLE, Ohio (AP) — Inmates
rioted yesterday at a maximum security
prison in south-central Ohio, injuring at
least seven guards and taking others
hostage, authorities said.
It wasn't immediately known how
many guards were being held or how
many prisoners were involved in the dis
turbance at the Southern Ohio Correc
tional Facility, said a prison official.
The disturbance at the L Block started
about 3 p.m. yesterday with a few prison
ers, but other prisoners became involved,
a prison official said. The unit houses
about 761 prisoners, but not all those
inmates were involved, said officials.
