# Israel to seal off Gaza, West Bank
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Cabinet min
isters endorsed Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin's proposal to seal the occupied
territories indefinitely yesterday and
sharply cut the Palestinian work force
in Israel.
Ministers acknowledged that the clo
sure would create economic hardship
for the 1.8 million Palestinians of the
occupied lands, but were vague about
measures to guarantee their economic
survival.
Rabin believes a separation of the
two areas is vital to curb violence and
win support among Israelis for future
concessions in Middle East peace talks.
The occupied territories were sealed
during most of the Persian Gulf War,
and have been shut periodically during
times of unrest.
The latest closure, imposed March 31
after a wave of Arab-Israeli attacks, dealt

a harsh economic blow to both sides.
Wages from 120,000 Palestinian
laborers in Israel account for half the
income of Gaza and one-third the
income of the West Bank. Israeli
employers, meanwhile, depend on
Arabs to fill many low-paying jobs.
Yesterday, the Cabinet decided to
review the closure weekly and inject an
undetermined amount of money into
the territories to compensate for the
lost jobs.
In another development, aides to
Rabin said he would meet Wednesday
with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
in the Egyptian city of Ismailiya to try to
work out problems hindering the resump
tion of peace talks. The talks are sched
uled to restart April 20 in Washington.
A key issue will be the participation
of Palestinians, who pulled out of the
U.S.-sponsored talks after Israel

deported about 400 alleged Muslim mil
itants to south Lebanon in December.
On Saturday, Palestinian leader
Faisal Husseini said an Israeli promise to
return all deportees was no longer a con
dition to resume negotiations. The Pales
tinians have not, however, announced
they were returning to the talks.
At its meeting yesterday, the Cabinet
did not approve any clear-cut plans for
creating jobs in the occupied territories.
Labor Minister Ora Namir said hun
dreds of millions of dollars in taxes paid
by Palestinian laborers would be rein
vested in the occupied lands.
Up to 7,000 Palestinians will be
given special permits to work on Israeli
farms that rely on Palestinian labor.
Namir predicted the closure would
be lifted in stages and that at least
70,000 Palestinians would return to
their jobs.
