## Endorsements A 						clean, solid slate 
### 
Unsalaried COP slate
will bring respectability
back to abandoned post

A VOTE FOR the Council of
Presidents slate, "A Clean
Slate: Salaries Not Includ
ed," is the best means available to
save the beleaguered position and
revive students' faith in student
government.
The "Clean Slate" candidates —
Ron Brown, Ying-Ying Goh, Delia
Lopez and Jason Snyder — realize
the necessity of demonstrating to
both students and administration
the importance of the COF| and are
prepared to do so without pay
"A Clean Slate" is clearly a bet
ter choice than its only opposition
— the write-in candidates "Blank
Slate" — because with its election
the Stanford community will
receive four people lobbying for
students' interests at no cost. Even
if the candidates only make a few
improvements while in office, it is
still more than would be accom
plished for students if there was
not a COP
"Blank Slate" does not possess a
coherent platform, nor does it pre
sent a campaign focused on any
thing other than the ephemeral
(but nonetheless popular) word
"change." Though the reformation
of the COP's goals and duties is
admirable, without actually help
ing in that process, "Blank Slate"
seems to be counting on the efforts
of undetermined individuals —
providing only vague, unfocused
ideas. "A Clean Slate" offers both
solid aims and strong proposals.
The "Clean Slate" candidates
should be encouraged to follow
through on their promise to
remain in close contact with the
student body by continuing to
maintain door-to-door contact
with students in residences, hold
ing "town" meetings and meeting
with student organizations. Its
success in establishing a rapport

with students will be a good indica
tor of the future success of "A
Clean Slate," as grass-roots efforts
are needed to ensure that student
government becomes responsible
to and representative of Stanford
students.
The slate plans to focus upon
tuition and financial-aid issues.
Members of the slate said they will
continue to pressure the Universi
ty to commit to a stated policy on
tuition increases — such as the
"inflation plus 1 percent" policy of
the past. Wishful thinking, per
haps, but definitely worth
attempting. Once again, some
thing is better than nothing.
The candidates have also said
they will propose the creation of a
Financial Aids Resource Center
dedicated to helping students
improve their packages.
The task of earning the respect
of the administration will also be
a formidable one for the slate.
After a year without a COF| the
University and Stanford students
will need to be convinced anew
that the COP is a potent political
force. University President Ger
hard Casper will complete his first
year on campus without ever
having been in touch with a COP
With a new provost next year, the
slate will have to aggressively
market itself to Casper and Uni
versity officials and prove that it
is serious about representing stu
dents, as well as affirm its own
importance.
After a year without a COFJ and
also without serious repercussions
due to its absence, it is fundamen
tal for "A Clean Slate" to provide
real results for Stanford students
and prove to be less dispensable
than past COPs.
The "Clean Slate" has made
many impressive promises over
the course of the campaign. How
ever, promises are easy to make.
Effective policy is not. "A Clean
Slate" has offered generally broad
proposals regarding important
issues, and its effectiveness and
earnestness to date suggests it will
be able to fill in these guidelines
with genuine advances.
