## Good timing is everything 
### 
WELCOME TO my column for
this week, which will take
approximately one minute and
45 seconds to read. I think it's impor
tant that you know how long it will take.
After all, time is so valuable these days.
There isn't enough time to begin
with. Classes, eating and talking take up
a sizable chunk of the day. To top it off,
there are only 10 weeks or so in the
quarter. If I had the time, I'd calculate
how many hours that is, but I would
have to subtract one because I just lost
an hour to daylight "savings." I lost an
hour! Whoever finds it is in for big bucks
because, as everyone knows, time is
money.
And so, when I waste my time, I
waste my money. I might as well toss
away dollar bills every time I wait in a
line. Sometimes I do, just to make a
point. At the post office, if I've had to
wait too long, I take out a stack of dol
lars and clear my throat dramatically, to
get everyone's attention. I then count
off the bills with the regularity of a tick
ing clock and fling them to the floor, one
at a time, in disgust. When I've abso
lutely lost my patience, I throw the rest
of the stack in the air like confetti, shoot
a spiteful glare at the clerks and storm
out in a rage. This may sound drastic,
but these kinds of symbolic displays are
the best way to force people to realize
my time— everybody's time— is being

wasted, all the time, by everybody.
The other day, for example, I went to
the store to buy a bag. After I'd paid for
it at the register, the salesman asked,
"Would you like a bag for that?" I
thought, "This is a bag, dammit." I
don't have time for this kind of redun
dancy. Let me say that again: I don't
have time for this kind of redundancy!
It simply doesn't fit into my schedule,
which is organized impeccably on a cal
endar, with neat little blocks for how
long each activity will take. Sometimes I
have so many plans my days are just big,
black squares. No time. I'm busy, busy,
busy.
Everything reminds me of time's
passing. I have an electronic watch that
sounds two short beeps every hour, a
meek little time-marker that is echoed
by the clock tower's rude "Bong! Bong!
Bong!" which seems to scream out
"MORTALITY!" Time is rushing me
forward at a merciless pace. When I
press "save" on the computer, a tiny
clock appears to show the seconds tick
ing irretrievably away while I sit by idly.
Every month, my phone bill lists how
much time each of my phone calls took,
along with the corresponding value of
that time. I cringe when I see the worth
of all those minutes, listed in perfect
columns — wasted time and wasted
money.
In an effort to maximize the value of

my time, I do everything fast, and some
times two, three or more things at once.
I read on the toilet, listen to the radio
when J.'m jogging, and iron my clothes
while I sing and watch TV. Sometimes,
when I find myself involved in a waste
fully long conversation, I nod along as
the other person is talking and, in my
head, I secretly work out logic problems.
You might be thinking, "Whoa, slow
down Rob. Stop and smell the roses."
But why should I stop to smell the roses
when I can whiz by on my bike and still
catch a good whiff of them? Using one
hand to steer, I can eat a sandwich, too,
and still leave my mind free to think
about my other plans.
There's just not enough time, not
enough white space on the calendar to
black out. I've got places to go, and I've
got to get to them fast. Even as I write,
the second hand of my clock pounds in
my ears with the intensity of a jackham
mer, mocking me as I squander precious
minutes. I'm about to start tossing dol
lar bills to the wind again. Time is wast
ing.
