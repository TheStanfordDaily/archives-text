# Student's film seized by Customs
## 
### Matt Parsons 
Like most Stanford students waiting
for a package, Sara Whiteley checked her
mailbox regularly. Her package wasn't
homemade cookies or clothes ordered
from J. Crew; it contained a tape of a doc
umentary film Whiteley had made and
sent to a European film festival.
But her package never came.
Instead Whiteley, a graduate student
in Stanford's film production program,
received a letter from the U.S. Customs
Service stating that the contents of her
package, her film "Rapture," had been
seized because of its obscene content.

"I was really shocked when I received
the letter," Whiteley said. "'Rapture' has
been in many recognizable film festivals
and I don't understand how it could be
interpreted as obscene."
"The fdm isn't about sex," she added,
"but it is about that very fine line be
tween physical and spiritual ecstasy."
According to Whiteley, her short film
is about people passing through a state of
physical pain to one of spiritual ecstasy.
This theme is demonstrated by a com
parison of modern dancers, who weigh
themselves down with metal balls hung
all over their bodies from piercings, with
the rituals of 12th century nuns, she ex

plained.
"The opening of the film is pretty
shocking," Whiteley said. "You get this
woman screaming and then in the next
scene, there is a very long, quiet and
thoughtful shot of her ritually cleaning
her body in preparation for dancing and a
transformation. The music in the back
ground is like a hymn and the narrator's
voice would appear to be in sharp con
trast to what you are seeing."
She explained that the woman looks
like a 20th century punk who has a mo
hawk, tattoos and multiple piercings all
over her body. However, the narra
tor states that the viewer is looking
at a 12th century nun preparing to
be flagellated to ecstasy in an annu
al religious rite. The text of the nar
ration is taken from a 12th century
nun's manual.
Whiteley explained that she
drew the similarities between the
two cultures because the descrip
tions of the way the ball dancers
performed their ceremony remind
ed her of descriptions of ecstasy
experienced by Christian saints
and martyrs.
"The film closes with a narrated
quote from Saint Teresa of Avila
who was a 16th century saint,"
Whiteley said. "She talks about
how the internal experiences of
rapture is not accessible from the
outside. It's an article of faith that
only those who experience it can
understand."
Whiteley said she believes that
the film is not only challenging

because of its subject matter, but
also because of the way it is pre
sented.
"There is a way to make the film
feel comfortable and make people
feel like they aren't being confront
ed," Whiteley said. "I didn't make
my film that way.
"Culturally we are used to docu
mentary films that allow an expert
to interpret experiences that the
general culture might feel strange
or bizarre and set them in a context
that distances the viewer from
them; they are not threatened that
way," she added.
"If I had had an ethnologist or
someone who is not one of the
dancers explain the significance of
the dance and how the viewer might
understand it further than just self
mutilation, it would have made it
easier for the viewer, but it wouldn't
have challenged the viewer."
Whiteley said that because her
film has been recognized by film
festivals worldwide, including a
premiere at the New York Film
Festival in October 1992, she never
expected to have trouble with U.S.
Customs. She said she is currently
in the process of resolving the

issue.
According to Whiteley, after
sending a letter to the Customs
Service's Los Angeles office
explaining why she didn't believe
her film was obscene, she received
a reply stating that a review did not
find the tape obscene.
However, she added that the let
ter also stipulated that, in order to
get the tape back, she would have
to sign an agreement indemnifying
the government and agreeing to pay
any legal or administrative costs
incurred in processing the tape.
"I sent them back a respectful
letter saying that I was pleased that
they said it was not obscene, but I
thought it was wrong that I had to
agree to pay any charges," Whiteley
said. "It had already cost me money
because I only have a few copies of
my film and it cost me a lot of
money to make decent copies."
Whiteley explained that she
received another letter April 1, say
ing that if she didn't sign the agree
ment within 15 days, her tape
would be destroyed. She said she
has not decided what her next
course of action will be.
"I'm going to lose the video tape,

that's a given," she said.
"What made me mad was that
they could seize any tape or movie
that I ever sent out of the country,"
Whiteley explained. "It amounts to
almost censorship — not in my
case — but that it can happen to
other people and happens over and
over again. Then one begins to
wonder."
Whiteley said she sees her expe
rience as a universal threat to doc
umentaries.
"I can't help thinking that part
of what's going on is political,"
Whiteley added. "The film is not
sexual, there is no sex, but it's sex
ualized. You see women with their
breasts bare and they are touching
each others bodies to put the balls
on. I think there is so much fear
about anything that strikes middle
America as sexually aberrant, that
it is far more threatening than
actual pornography.
"It effects all film makers,"
Whiteley said. "It's about free
speech. Free speech isn't guaran
teed if you can't afford to pay Cus
toms off every time they seize one
of your films. I don't know if this
might happen to me again."

is about people passing through a state of
physical pain to one of spiritual ecstasy.
This theme is demonstrated by a com
parison of modern dancers, who weigh
themselves down with metal balls hung
all over their bodies from piercings, with
the rituals of 12th century nuns, she ex

plained.
"The opening of the film is pretty
shocking," Whiteley said. "You get this
woman screaming and then in the next
scene, there is a very long, quiet and
thoughtful shot of her ritually cleaning
her body in preparation for dancing and a
transformation. The music in the back
ground is like a hymn and the narrator's
voice would appear to be in sharp con
trast to what you are seeing."
She explained that the woman looks
like a 20th century punk who has a mo
hawk, tattoos and multiple piercings all
over her body. However, the narra
tor states that the viewer is looking
at a 12th century nun preparing to
be flagellated to ecstasy in an annu
al religious rite. The text of the nar
ration is taken from a 12th century
nun's manual.
Whiteley explained that she
drew the similarities between the
two cultures because the descrip
tions of the way the ball dancers
performed their ceremony remind
ed her of descriptions of ecstasy
experienced by Christian saints
and martyrs.
"The film closes with a narrated
quote from Saint Teresa of Avila
who was a 16th century saint,"
Whiteley said. "She talks about
how the internal experiences of
rapture is not accessible from the
outside. It's an article of faith that
only those who experience it can
understand."
Whiteley said she believes that
the film is not only challenging

because of its subject matter, but
also because of the way it is pre
sented.
"There is a way to make the film
feel comfortable and make people
feel like they aren't being confront
ed," Whiteley said. "I didn't make
my film that way.
"Culturally we are used to docu
mentary films that allow an expert
to interpret experiences that the
general culture might feel strange
or bizarre and set them in a context
that distances the viewer from
them; they are not threatened that
way," she added.
"If I had had an ethnologist or
someone who is not one of the
dancers explain the significance of
the dance and how the viewer might
understand it further than just self
mutilation, it would have made it
easier for the viewer, but it wouldn't
have challenged the viewer."
Whiteley said that because her
film has been recognized by film
festivals worldwide, including a
premiere at the New York Film
Festival in October 1992, she never
expected to have trouble with U.S.
Customs. She said she is currently
in the process of resolving the

issue.
According to Whiteley, after
sending a letter to the Customs
Service's Los Angeles office
explaining why she didn't believe
her film was obscene, she received
a reply stating that a review did not
find the tape obscene.
However, she added that the let
ter also stipulated that, in order to
get the tape back, she would have
to sign an agreement indemnifying
the government and agreeing to pay
any legal or administrative costs
incurred in processing the tape.
"I sent them back a respectful
letter saying that I was pleased that
they said it was not obscene, but I
thought it was wrong that I had to
agree to pay any charges," Whiteley
said. "It had already cost me money
because I only have a few copies of
my film and it cost me a lot of
money to make decent copies."
Whiteley explained that she
received another letter April 1, say
ing that if she didn't sign the agree
ment within 15 days, her tape
would be destroyed. She said she
has not decided what her next
course of action will be.
"I'm going to lose the video tape,

that's a given," she said.
"What made me mad was that
they could seize any tape or movie
that I ever sent out of the country,"
Whiteley explained. "It amounts to
almost censorship — not in my
case — but that it can happen to
other people and happens over and
over again. Then one begins to
wonder."
Whiteley said she sees her expe
rience as a universal threat to doc
umentaries.
"I can't help thinking that part
of what's going on is political,"
Whiteley added. "The film is not
sexual, there is no sex, but it's sex
ualized. You see women with their
breasts bare and they are touching
each others bodies to put the balls
on. I think there is so much fear
about anything that strikes middle
America as sexually aberrant, that
it is far more threatening than
actual pornography.
"It effects all film makers,"
Whiteley said. "It's about free
speech. Free speech isn't guaran
teed if you can't afford to pay Cus
toms off every time they seize one
of your films. I don't know if this
might happen to me again."
