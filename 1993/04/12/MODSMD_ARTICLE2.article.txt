# Student's film seized by Customs

Like most Stanford students waiting
for a package, Sara Whiteley checked her
mailbox regularly. Her package wasn't
homemade cookies or clothes ordered
from J. Crew; it contained a tape of a doc
umentary film Whiteley had made and
sent to a European film festival.
But her package never came.
Instead Whiteley, a graduate student
in Stanford's film production program,
received a letter from the U.S. Customs
Service stating that the contents of her
package, her film "Rapture," had been
seized because of its obscene content.

"I was really shocked when I received
the letter," Whiteley said. "'Rapture' has
been in many recognizable film festivals
and I don't understand how it could be
interpreted as obscene."
"The fdm isn't about sex," she added,
"but it is about that very fine line be
tween physical and spiritual ecstasy."
According to Whiteley, her short film
is about people passing through a state of
physical pain to one of spiritual ecstasy.
This theme is demonstrated by a com
parison of modern dancers, who weigh
themselves down with metal balls hung
all over their bodies from piercings, with
the rituals of 12th century nuns, she ex

plained.
"The opening of the film is pretty
shocking," Whiteley said. "You get this
woman screaming and then in the next
scene, there is a very long, quiet and
thoughtful shot of her ritually cleaning
her body in preparation for dancing and a
transformation. The music in the back
ground is like a hymn and the narrator's
voice would appear to be in sharp con
trast to what you are seeing."
She explained that the woman looks
like a 20th century punk who has a mo
hawk, tattoos and multiple piercings all
