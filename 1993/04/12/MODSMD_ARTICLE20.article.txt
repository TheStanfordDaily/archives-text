Subjectivity often renders Freshman English useless

IN THE ONGOING battle over the
value of the Freshman English
requirement at Stanford, countless
arguments have been proffered by both
camps. These arguments have, of
course, been of varying effectiveness,
but I submit that one type of argument
is completely without merit.
To wit: I do not believe that, because
no person is capable of crafting a bit of
prose or persuasion that ultimately sat
isfies the varying stylistic and grammati
cal standards of his entire audience, we
all should be forced to endure one or two
quarters of Freshman English.
Yet it is upon this premise that Scott
Pearson's argument for the require
ment apparently rests. Naturally, Fear
son's letter does not admit that no one
is capable of perfect prose; instead, he
suggests in a rather hypercritical and
presumptuous tone that Joey Rosen
blum, specifically, suffers this deficit,
and that it should be corrected by
spending a quarter or two in an English
classroom as Pearson, himself, surely
did.
There is one major flaw in Pearson's
argument. His presumption that fulfill
ing the Freshman English requirement
perfects one's skill with grammar, style
and word choice is wholly unsubstantiat
ed. This is most convincingly supported

by the fact that Pearson's own letter
was littered with the occasional - but by
no standard egregious - stylistic or
grammatical flaw,
For instance, Pearson suspects that
his letter might be viewed as "nit-pick
ing," when it was actually quite nit
picky. Also, many readers (and a sub
stantial proportion of high-school
English teachers) find a phrase ending
with a preposition to be distracting, if
not downright unacceptable. Finally, in
a piece of prose that is hoped to be
beyond criticism, the inflection of the
verbs should agree with the number of
relevant subjects: a group of mistakes is
but one and, hence, singular; it does not
"concern [the] use of colloquialisms," it
concerns their use. It seems, by Pear
son's logic, that we all should have an
even more imposing English require
ment than we do now, since even Stan
ford graduates are unable to compose a
stylistically and grammatically flawless
letter.
My desire here is not to point out that
perhaps Pearson should not be casting
stones. It is to demonstrate the futility
of quibbling over minutiae under the
guise of discussing the practical issue of
whether the Freshman English require
ment is necessary, useful and effective.
The fact is that neither Rosenblum, nor

Pearson, nor I am write a letter that
satisfies the stylistic and grammatical
standards of every reader. This suggests
one of two things: either there is not one
uniquely correct way to write in any sit
uation, or there is a right way and a
wrong way and fulfilling the Freshman
English requirement does not result in
always writing the right way.
In each case, the argument that the
Freshman English requirement is neces
sary because Rosenblum failed to write a
flawless letter is invalid. I believe that
the actual situation is a composite of
these two conditions. There is no intrin
sically correct way to write (particularly
when relying on structures of greater
complexity), but there are better ways
and worse ways, and Freshman English
classes are not sufficiently focused on
delineating those.
In my experience, Freshman English
classes are not achieving what many
(including myself) believe should be
their primary goal: improving the fun
damental English skills of students
who enter with vastly disparate levels
of previous exposure. What is a
gerund? What is the difference between
the pluperfect and future tenses? Is
there one, at all?
These are concepts that I can hon
estly assert were never discussed in my

required Freshman English class.
(Unless all of these mundane matters
were disposed of in the first meeting,
before I had switched into my class.)
Instead of covering grammar and dic
tion, most Freshman English classes
are devoted to serving the community
and instilling in students a respect for
alternate lifestyles and modern social
woes.
If social enlightenment is the academ
ic goal of the Freshman English require
ment, and the University administration
and faculty believe that to be its justifi
able objective, then it could not be more
efficacious. If this is the case, Rosen
blum should settle quietly into his seat
and Pearson should not be trying to
defend the requirement with the obser
vation that those who are opposed to it
are not perfect writers.
However, if the goal of Freshman
English is to strengthen students' skills
of grammar, style, and diction, it is fail
ing (anyone's criticism of my own letter
would serve only as further support for
this contention); students of superior
basic skills are not receiving the appro
priate instruction and, for those like
Rosenblum, the requirement well may
be inconvenient and unnecessary.
