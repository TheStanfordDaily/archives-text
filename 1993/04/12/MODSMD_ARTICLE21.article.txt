# Tuition hikes and aid cuts likely to continue despite COP's revival
## 
### 
Many people at Stanford believe it is
student ignorance which leads to the vie
tories of slates such as last year's "I Pre
fer Not to Have a COP." The truth is
that Stanford students are not ignorant,
or apathetic, but rather they are realists,
The ASSU provides the campus with
certain valuable services. Flicks and Lec

ture Notes both add to the Stanford
experience. However, the Council of
Presidents adds nothing, and students
know it is a sham. Can any student,
graduate or undergraduate, remember a
worthy accomplishment of the COP?
A Clean Slate promises to fight for
more financial aid. Despite the sinceri
ty behind its promise, its efforts would
be fruitless. The University, in order
to appear more open to student con
cerns, will meet with the COP. An
article in The Daily will proclaim that
the COP and the administration are
negotiating over student financial-aid

reforms.
The University will then offer some
empty and meaningless "concessions,"
which it had planned from the begin
ning, and there will be a great photo-op
with smiles and handshakes all around.
The University will then be able to justi
fy its decisions as "made with student
input."
The University knows students do
not want big tuition hikes and less
financial aid. Its decisions on tuition
and financial aid are based upon thou
sands of pages of data and calculations.
A COP will not add to the decision-mak

ing process. If anything, it will only
serve to provide the administration with
a cloak of legitimacy.
