## Burt Herman Photographer defends photo essay on East Palo Alto 
### 
Reality can often be trou
bling. While I acknowledge Kwame
Yao Anku's criticism as expressed
by his April 8 column, it seems that Anku
reads more into the photo essay than was
present in the photographs.
The photo department first conceived
the idea of an East Palo Alto photo essay
in order to show Stanford students an
incredibly troubled city (the "murder
capital" of the United States) that is
only 10 minutes from campus. Stanford
often typifies the ivory tower of
academia that can become cut off from
the real world.
I decided to ride along with police in
order to witness the crime that occurs in
East Palo Alto. To balance the violence,
Victor Cheng, one of my co-editors, was
sent to a school where children were
being educated, an institution with the
potential to fight this crime.
The Daily did not set out to do a
overview of everything that occurs in
East Palo Alto, but chose to look at two
small vignettes. The title "Night and
Day" refers to the fact that all the police
ride-alongs occurred at night, while the
school photographs were taken in the
daytime. Crime also occurs during the
day, and education occurs at night â€” yet
we made an artistic choice in order to
emphasize a contrast.
The photo printed on the front page
was meant to be a silhouette (not poor
photo quality) and it is thus fairly hard
to discern fine details. This photo is of
someone being searched, as is stated in
the caption (not an arrest). It is true
that the person's hand being searched is

relatively dark in skin color and the
police officer's hand is fairly light. How
ever, it is problematic to blindly assume,
as Anku does, that the person being
searched in the picture is African-Ameri
can and the officer is white.
Anku compares The Daily's photo to
a Jesse Helms campaign, yet it is he who
imparts racism to the meaning of the
photo by jumping to uninformed conclu
sions. Anku writes, "And The Daily
prides itself in having a liberal slant!
HA!" No newspaper ever prides itself on
having a slant of any kind.
In the photo spread, there is one pic
ture of a Latino man being questioned.
He was drunk and carrying a knife. The
other Latino man photographed had
been shot. It is puzzling why, to Anku,
this makes this man a criminal. There is
one silhouette of a police officer with his
gun drawn. The other three pictures are
of a white, middle-aged female who died
of a drug overdose.
Some of the photos are graphic. They
portray horrible things. However, this is
what I saw when I rode along with the
police. This is what might happen on a
typical night in East Palo Alto. It should
be distressing. The drugs and violence in
that community are tearing it apart. The
city has little money, because its most
profitable industry, drugs, is illegal and
thus untaxable.
Anku wonders why we gave full iden
tification of the woman who died of a
drug overdose. He sarcastically writes,
"I'm sure it wasn't so you could send
flowers." This extreme rhetoric seems to
imply that we had ulterior motives in

printing a complete identification. How
ever, it is a matter of journalistic profes
sionalism to print complete identifica
tion whenever possible, except in cases
dealing with rape victims or juvenile
criminals and victims.
Anku says that "like the rest of the
media, (The Daily] portrayed the crimi
nals as black and Chicano and all of the
good guys and saviors as white." By my
count, there are three photos of a white
drug user, one of a Latino intoxicated
man, one of a Latino victim and one
man being searched who might be
African-American.
On the other side of the page we pre
sented a white teacher. Her students are
predominantly black and Latino. It hap
pens to be reality that at Flood Elemen
tary School most of the students are
minorities and most of the teachers are
white. It would be a distortion to imply
anything different.
We did not go through our proof
sheets and count up the number of peo
ple of different ethnicities to publish in
the paper. The photos that ran are rep
resentative of the reality of East Palo
Alto looking from two unique perspec
tives. These pictures are representations
of what was seen by two photographers.
Anku fixates himself on the race of
the individuals portrayed in the pho
tographs. To Anku, it is not police who
aid the injured Latino man, they are
"white officers." Anku does not see good
guys and bad guys, but "white good guys
and black bad guys." In Anku's distorted
vision, there could never be any white
good-guy officers, for the issue of race

clouds his judgement of a person's
merit.
The officers aiding the man who was
shot showed incredible courage and
sense of civic duty. The female officer in
the picture got blood on her bare hands
to help the injured Latino before the
paramedics arrived. It is this kind of
heroism which is helping people knock
down the barriers of racism.
Why should it matter what race the
officers or teachers are? They are people
doing their job in a highly stressful situ
ation. Every officer I rode with took
their job seriously and never used exces
sive force. Anku wants to escalate the
issue into a Rodney King incident, yet
that is simply not the case. Anku speaks
from an isolated and uninformed per
spective, and he himself falls victim to
the media stereotypes that he calls
racist.
It is interesting to note that when
Anku talks of the horrors of running
"three pictures" of the white woman
who died, he omits a mention of race.
This would run contrary to his attempt
to show racism in the essay.
It is essential to look at the essay as a
whole, and not two individual parts.
The left side does show despair. Yet the
right side shows the means by which to
combat despair. Anku states that we
show no way that Stanford can help
fight the violence. However, the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring Pro
gram is mentioned in the accompanying
text, and the dominant photo on the
right side of the page is an elementary
school student being tutored by a Stan

ford student.
There are many opportunities for
public service such as this to be found at
the Haas Center for Public Service. Any
one who is interested in helping could
easily discover this. The Daily frequently
features articles that highlight campus
public-service events which assist East
Palo Alto. Last year, Daily staff mem
bers went to Costario School in East
Palo Alto to discuss newspapers and
tutor students in writing.
Anku closes with dramatic rhetoric
and implies that The Daily staff is
"criminal." Would it not have been more
"criminal" to completely ignore the
problem and pretend it did not exist? He
is afraid that he might be "cutting off
the hand that feeds [him]," further per
petuating his paranoid delusion of the
Daily staff as a bunch of overbearing
conservative bigots who place no value
on free speech.
It was our hope that these graphic
images might awaken Stanford from its
normal routine. We wanted to show the
University that people living close to us
are not as secure or fortunate as we are
at Stanford.
It was our hope that maybe people
would see the terrible violence, and then
see a way to help. Instead of searching
for racism in a photo essay, Anku might
better have used his column inches of
text to appeal to the student body to
take action in East Palo Alto to help
fight the violence. The choice is yours.

editors.
