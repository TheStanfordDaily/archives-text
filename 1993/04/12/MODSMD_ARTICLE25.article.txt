## Cardinal can't blow USC away as Trojans split 
### Andy Eiser Editorial staff 
After drubbing USC, 15-5, on Friday,
Stanford took the field at Sunken Dia
mond Saturday with thoughts of sweeping
its southern foe. Three hours later, the
Cardinal found those hopes gone with the
wind.
On an otherwise beautiful day, unpre
dictable winds swirled through the ballpark,
compounding Stanford's pitching woes by
carrying two Aaron Boone drives over the
left-field fence and inducing three Stanford
errors en route to a 6-4 Trojan victory.
Boone's homers, his second and third of
the season, helped USC (22-18, 12-9 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Division) main
tain its hold on first place in the hotly-con
tested Six-Pac, three games ahead of the
last-place Cardinal (18-14, 6-9).
"We came in here with a little bit of a
cushion hoping to do well against Stanford,"
Boone said. "They sort of took the wind out
of our sails with the first two wins."
The Trojan third baseman's roundtrip
pers also prevented Stanford from gaining
its first series sweep in conference play, an
indication of the overall strength of the
Six-Pac.
"It's always critical when you have a
chance to sweep somebody or be swept,"
said Cardinal coach Mark Marquess.
"Instead of losing one or gaining one, you
lose three or gain three. Any time you have
a chance to sweep somebody, you want to
take advantage of it, but that's tough to do
in our league."
For the second consecutive week, the
Cardinal took the first two games of a con
ference series behind its top two pitchers —
Willie Adams and Andrew Lorraine — only
to fall in the finale, a consequence of Stan
ford's season-long inconsistency in the
third starter slot.
"When Adams and Lorraine are on the
mound, it's no upset for them to beat any
body," said USC coach Mike Gillespie.
"They execute so much better behind
them."
Freshman Todd Bartels (0-1) took the
mound for his sixth start on Saturday, sur

rendering four runs and nine hits and tak
ing the loss in three and two-thirds
innings of work. He was spelled by former
starter Dan Reed, who yielded two runs
and four hits in three and one-third
innings.
"Hopefully we can have somebody step
up and take over that third-starter spot,"
Marquess said. "We haven't had anybody
do that yet."
Boone staked the Trojans to a 1-0 lead in
the top of the second, but Cardinal first
baseman Dusty Allen countered with his
fourth homer of the year, a towering shot
to left, to lead off the bottom half of the
inning. Right fielder Brodie Van Wagenen
then walked with one out and advanced to
second when center fielder Rod Meyer was
hit by Trojan starter Mike Collett (5-3).
Second baseman Jeff Des Jardins drove
Van Wagenen home, lacing a hit-and-run
single to right to give the Cardinal a 2-1
lead, its only advantage of the afternoon.
USC evened the score on two Cardinal
errors in the top of the third, then added
two more runs in the fourth on three hits,
including designated hitter Shon Malani's
first home run of the season. Van Wagenen
doubled and scored on a Des Jardins sacri
fice fly in the bottom of the fourth, but the
4-3 deficit would be as close as the Cardinal
would get, as the Trojans pushed across a
single run in the seventh and the teams
traded marks in the eighth.
"This loss might be a blessing in dis
guise," Des Jardins said. "It might make us
work harder still rather than, if we had
swept them, we might have kicked back."
The Cardinal was blessed with a potent
offense on Friday, as it backed up Adams'
8-0 shutout the previous day with a 15-5
rout that saw seven Stanford starters com
bine for 18 hits.
Brian Dallimore, the team's leadoff hit
ter and third baseman, walked in his first
four plate appearances, doubled down the
left-field line in his fifth trip and scored
three runs.
"Being leadoff, my mentality is just to
get on base," Dallimore said. "I don't care if

Andrew Lorraine sends one plateward to a would-be USC hitter. The senior southpaw worked more than seven innings
Friday in earning his sixth win of the season by a 15-5 count.
