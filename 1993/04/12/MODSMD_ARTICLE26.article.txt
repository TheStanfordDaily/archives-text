# Netters double up in razing Arizona, ASU

Before this weekend's trip to Ari
zona, Stanford men's tennis coach
Dick Gould emphasized the need for
his squad to stay focused. "If we let up
for a little bit, Arizona and Arizona
State will beat us," he commented.
Early in both matches, Gould's con
cern looked as if it may have become a
self-fulfilling prophecy. But after slow
starts, the Cardinal turned the tide
and notched a pair of victories. Fifth
ranked Stanford returned from the
Grand Canyon State with a season
record of 15-3.
"I was not pleased with how we
started our matches," Gould said.
"But I was extremely pleased with how
we battled and fought back. We took
charge in the doubles when we had to,
and the kids really pulled through."
Playing at No. 1 for the Cardinal,
junior Michael Flanagan dropped his
first set to a persistent Matt Holt, 6-7.

But seventh-ranked Flanagan battled
back to pull off a 7-6 second-set victory,
then snubbed Holt 6-0 in the third set.
Similarly, No. 99 Vimal Patel lost
his first set before defeating Wildcat
Greg Prudhomme, 6-7, 7-2, 7-5. In
another marathon match, junior
Robert Devens, ranked 18th national
ly, suffered a tough defeat at the hands
of Brandon Hearn, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3.
Chris Cocotos and Jeff Salzenstein
both minimized their time in the gru
eling Arizona heat with quick two-set
victories at No. 4 and No. 5 singles.
But Cocotos would have a chance to
go the distance in his doubles match,
where the duo of Rey and Holt took
him and partner Flanagan to the wire
in two sets before falling 7-6, 7-6.
Devens and Patel, nonplused by their
long singles sets, finished their after
noon quickly with a 6-2, 6-4 win over
Prudhomme-Foote.
Completing the doubles sweep was
the freshman team of Jeff Salzenstein
and Jim Thomas, which defeated

Hearn and Mike Klein, 7-5, 6-1. Ari
zona dropped to 6-14 on the season.
Stanford's doubles teams main
tained the rhythm on Saturday
against the Sun Devils, again proving
to be the key to a Cardinal victory.
After singles, the match was dead
locked at three-all.
In singles play, Devens, Patel and
Billy Wright downed their opponents,
but Flanagan, Cocotos and Salzenstein
came out on the short end.
The Sun Devils' doubles team of
Peter Jeschke and Paul Reber fought a
noble battle against the 29th-ranked
duo of Flanagan-Cocotos before
falling, 7-6, 3-6, 7-6. Devens and Patel
also had a challenge in Bruce Haddad
and Eric Brunner, but managed to
escape after only two sets, winning 7-
5, 6-4. Again, the pair of freshmen,
Salzenstein and Thomas, made a
faster job of it, winning 6-3, 6-1.
"Our No. 3 doubles team did a real
good job in both matches," Gould said.
"They're continuing to improve as a

team, which bodes well for us."
This weekend's intensity is just
what Stanford needed as it gears up
for the last part of the season. The
squad's matches against Arizona and
Arizona State earlier in the season had
been uncharacteristically easy.
When the Wildcats and Sun Devils
came to town last month, the Cardinal
dominated both matches, easily dis
posing first of Arizona, 6-0, then of
Arizona State, 8-1.
"I thought both teams were very
flat when they came to Stanford two
weeks ago," Gould said. "But they
played considerably better as a team
this time. These were very hard
fought wins."
Endurance played a key factor this
weekend. Although the 90-degree tem
peratures and five-hour matches may
have been ideal for spectators, they
tested Stanford's stamina. In the Car
dinal's back-to-back matches, Gould
was impressed with how "the kids held
up great physically."
