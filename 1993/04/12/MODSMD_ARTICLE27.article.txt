# Spikers succeed to Pacific crown in Long Beach
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's volleyball team, it was a
bittersweet weekend that was more sweet than bit
ter.
On Saturday, the No. 2 Cardinal (16-4, 14-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) lost to the
ninth-ranked USC Trojans (11-8, 9-7 MSPF), 15-12,
15-14, 15-6. But that was only after the squad had
soundly defeated No. 5 Long Beach State, (13-11, 9-
6) 17-15, 15-6, 15-8, the previous night to clinch the
Pacific Division crown.
With this title, Stanford now has two shots at
receiving a bid to next month's NCAA Final Four in
Los Angeles. First, the Cardinal will play the winner
of the Mountain Division (most likely No. 1 UCLA)
in Irvine, Calif, on April 28 for the overall MPSF
title and a guaranteed ticket to L.A. If Stanford loses
this match, it becomes the top seed in the eight-team
MPSF Tournament, played on the following three
days. The winner of this tournament will most like
ly also advance to the Final Four.
The win over the 49ers was sweet for other rea
sons besides its playoff implication. First, it marked
the first time any player on the current Cardinal
team has ever beaten Long Beach at Long Beach
Arena. Also, in snapping the 49ers' five-match home
winning streak, Stanford was able to run its win
streak to a season-high 10 matches. Furthermore, in
the three games on Friday, the Cardinal was able to
amass 49 digs, including a career-high 15 by Dave
Goss and 11 by Ryan Moos.
At the "Gold Mine," Goss hit only .191 with 21
kills, but the play of middle blockers Brian Garrett
and John Hribar compensated for the All-Ameri
can's subpar performance. Garrett turned in 11 kills
and hit .667 while Hribar contributed 12 kills and
hit .588. Hribar also led the team with six blocks.
Swing hitter Bob Hillman added 23 kills while hit
ting .364.
Another key to Stanford's win was the defense of
the 49ers' Brent Hilliard. Hilliard, last year's Player
of the Year, was held to a .172 hitting percentage,
almost 200 points below his average, and tallied only
14 kills, 10 below his typical performance.
In the first game, both teams came out flat. The
Cardinal, which as a team hits at a .401 clip, hit .297

in the opening game, while Long Beach State hit
.286. But Stanford raised its play in the next two
games to average .338 for the match while holding
the 49ers to .244, including a meager .045 in the sec
ond game.
The next night, the Trojans stampeded over a
Cardinal team that had some unusual replacements.
Starting in place of Ail-Americans Canyon Ceman
and Goss were senior Jimmy Blackman and fresh
man Mike Lambert. Lambert, playing the offense
intensive opposite hitter position, had 21 kills and 10
errors to hit .256.
"In terms of preparing for postseason, we want to
get these guys playing time in front of a tough oppo

nent.," said Stanford coach Ruben Nieves. "I thought
they both played well."
USC has had problems passing this year, so they
moved star sophomore Jason Mulholland to swing
hitter. Against the Cardinal, this lineup switch was
effective.
"Mulholland passed nails," Garrett said.
Nieves saw three reasons for the loss: first, Stan
ford did not block well, as evidenced by USC's .433
team hitting percentage. Second, the Cardinal had
an abysmal 27 service errors and only three aces.
"We just killed ourselves with poor serving,"

Bob Hlllman faces a wall of UCSB defenders in a match last month. Hillman and the other Cardinal
seniors finally exorcised the 49er ghost In clinching the MPSF Pacific title in Long Beach on Friday.
Nieves said. "We didn't serve
tough."
Finally, both starting swing
hitters had poor hitting matches.
Moos had seven hitting errors
and hit .136, while Hillman, a star
the night before, had eight hitting
errors and hit .235.
"112 Their hitting performance]
just wasn't enough to help us get
the job done," Nieves said.

At the middle-blocker position
John Bezmalinovic and Hribar
started against the Trojans. Hrib
ar had 15 kills and combined with
the others to give the Cardinal 27
kills out of the middle.
For USC, the duo of Mulhol
land and Chris Underwood (who
took Mulholland's position at
opposite hitter when Mulholland
was moved to swing hitter) contin
ued to pile up impressive hitting
statistics. Underwood had 23 kills
with six errors to hit .425, while
Mulholland led all players with 25
kills and a .488 percentage.
