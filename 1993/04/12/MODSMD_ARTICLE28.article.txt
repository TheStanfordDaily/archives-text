# Women rout 'Cats, Devils
## Whip Arizona 5-1, ASU 6-0 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
If Wednesday's loss to No. 4 California made
the Cardinal sick to its stomach, this weekend was
just what the doctor ordered.
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(21-2, 7-2 Pacific 10 South) rebounded with
authority in its final home matches of the 1993
regular season, defeating No. 10 Arizona and
No. 7 Arizona State by 5-1 and 6-0 scores,
respectively.
"When you think about it you get pretty
shocked," said coach Frank Brennan. "We beat
them without two of our key starting players,
which shows you just how deep our team is."
The victory was vital not only in getting the
nation's top team back to its winning ways, but
also in giving Brennan more confidence in a new
lineup that may have to carry the team to the Pac
-10 Championships in two weeks and beyond.
"I was happy our players rose to the occasion,"
Brennan said. "Emma [Woodhousel beat two
quality players, and [Wendy] Sacks is anxious to
play and did very well this weekend. I'm real
pleased with the lineup."
Stanford kicked off the weekend sweep with a
5-1 win over the Wildcats on Friday. No. 1 Laxmi
Poruri started the day with a convincing 6-3, 7-6
victory over the country's No. 5 player, Arizona's
Alix Creek. Creek is the defending Pac-10 singles
champion.
"Laxmi was a little shaky, but she closed it
out well," Brennan said. "She just had a bad day
at Cal."
Senior team captain Heather Willens dis
posed of Miko Hemsi in the No. 2 match in
straight sets, 6-1, 6-0, but No. 3 Kristine Kurth
was not so fortunate, losing to the 'Cats' Celine
Verdier by a narrow 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 score.
No. 4 Beth Berris increased her dual match
record to 20-1 with her win over Michelle Old
ham, 6-1,6-2, while No. 5 Woodhouse held off Ari
zona's Angela Bernal after 5-5 in the second set,
breaking Bernal and holding serve to take the
match 7-6, 7-5. Freshman Wendy Sacks clinched
the dual match win at No. 6 with a 7-5, 6-2 deci
sion over Allison Grace. Doubles were not played.
Stanford picked up where it left off on Satur
day, blanking the Sun Devils 6-0. Poruri blew by
25th-ranked Kori Davidson in the No. 1 match,
6-3, 6-1, while No. 2 Willens pulled out a three
set victory over Joelle Schad, 5-7,6-2,6-0, in Wil
lens' last home match. Appropriately, the senior
captain's win clinched the dual victory for the
Cardinal.
Kurth's previous four matches had gone to
three sets, but she only took two to defeat Mered
ith Geiger in the No. 3 match, 6-2, 6-3. No. 4
Berris also defeated Page Bartelt, 6-4, 6-4.
Woodhouse held off a second-set rally to top
Kara Schertzer in the No. 5 match, 6-4, 7-5, while
No. 6 Sacks sealed the shutout with a 6-4, 6-2
shellacking of ASU's Pam Ciofli.
Stanford closes out its 1993 regular season on
the road against No. 12 UCLA and No. 5 USC on
Friday and Saturday. A sweep of the Los Angeles
teams would clinch the Pac-10 title for the Cardi
nal and give it much-needed momentum going
into the NCAA Championships in Gainesville,
Fla., May 12 through 20.
