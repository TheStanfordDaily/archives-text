# Clark leaps to posterity in open meet
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Travis Clark became Stan
ford's first representative to
June's NCAA Track and Field
Championships last Saturday,
as the sophomore high-jumped a
personal-best 7-foot-1 3/4 at the
Stanford All-Comers Track and
Field Meet.
After Clark cleared that
height to gain an NCAA provi
sional mark, he attempted to
clear the bar at 7-foot-4 1/2 to
gain an automatic NCAA-quali
fying standard. All three of his
attempts came up short, howev
er, as he settled for the provi
sional mark and a first-place fin
ish in the event.
"It's something I've been
shooting for all season long,"

Clark said of the automatic
standard.
"Hopefully I can do it in the
next couple of weeks because we
have some very competitive
meets coming up."
Other highlights of the day
included David Popejoy's per
sonal best of 223-foot-9 in the
hammer throw.
That effort would have auto
matically qualified him for the
NCAA Championships, but he
has opted to redshirt this season

and continue competing un
attached.
Former Cardinal stand-out
Marc Olesen (class of 1988) set
a blazing pace in the 1,500-
meter run, as he out-distanced
a field of present Stanford ath
letes in a time of 3 minutes,
51.6 seconds.
Olesen, the Stanford Stadium
record holder in the 1,500-meter
race, currently trains with a
team of Stanford alumni in
hopes of qualifying for the 1996
Olympics. Six summers ago, he
secured a spot on the Canadian
Olympic team, only to lose it
because of injuries.
"For me this race was only a
tune-up for next week (at Mt.
SAO," Olesen said.
"However, I think it's great
that this meet brings in so many

high-quality people for the var
sity athletes to compete
against."
Other former Stanford stars
showed up to relive the glory of
their collegiate careers, as for
mer Pacific 10 Conference
champion Marcus Hickerson
(class of 1991) long-jumped 24-
foot-5 to beat out current Cardi
nal athlete Jason Robinson, who
leaped 22-foot-8.
Peggy Odita, who still runs
competitively with the Stanford
Track Club, dominated the field
in the high jump (5-foot-8 3/4)
and the 100-meter hurdles
(14.57).
An estimated crowd of 500
also welcomed its newest track
and-field star, as it gave 13-
year-old Matt London a thun
dering ovation after he complet
ed the 1,500-meter run in just
over five minutes.
The Kings Academy runner
started racing in the sixth
grade, when he placed second in
a local Junior Olympics compe
tition. He has been training out
of his home in Los Altos ever
since.
With so many community
members competing alongside
the team, several athletes con
sidered this meet as low-key and
"almost like practice," according
to Louise Watson, the winner of
the women's 1,500. "It's really
hard to get psyched up for the
meet," she said.
Tovi Abello, winner in the
100-meter hurdles, agreed.
"The meet was basically 90 per
cent Stanford and 10 percent
other, so even though we had a
couple of competitive former
athletes out there running,
overall it was more like an
intense practice."
However, coach Vin Lananna
stressed that the meet was a
break in the season. It provided
a chance for the community to
get involved and a chance for the
team to compete in front of a
home crowd.
Next week, the Cardinal will
resume intercollegiate competi
tion at the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Invitational. Mt. SAC is one
of the most prestigious track and
field meets in the nation and is
held each year in Walnut, located
in Southern California.
