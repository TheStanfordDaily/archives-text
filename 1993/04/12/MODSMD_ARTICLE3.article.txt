### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
After allegedly stealing various items from an un
locked parked car in the lot next to Toyon and Bran
ner Halls, a Santa Clara University student was ar
rested early yesterday morning for possession of
stolen property.
Stanford Police detained six Santa Clara Universi
ty students and booked 19-year-old Matthew Thomas
Collins, also a Santa Clara student, after finding one
stolen audio tape and another stolen tape cover in his
possession, according to Stanford Police Sgt. John
McMullen.
Police found four other audio tapes hidden in
bushes.
Collins later admitted to taking the five audio
tapes and an owner's manual from the car, McMullen
said. Police found the manual partially burned in the
hallway of the second floor of Branner.
At about 2 a.m. yesterday, a witness notified police
that three or four individuals were trying to break
into parked cars and had entered one car and re
moved property from it.
Officers went to the area and stopped a car pulling
out of the parking lot to ask if they had seen the sus
picious individuals.
At that point, the witness identified the individu
als in the car as those who had taken property from
one of the parked cars.
Stanford Police do not know Collins' motive or
what the Santa Clara students were doing in the
parking lot. Police are still investigating the possible
involvement of the other six Santa Clara students,
said McMullen.
Collins will probably be arraigned on Monday in
Santa County Municipal Court in Palo Alto and
given the opportunity to post $3,000 bail, McMullen
said.
If Collins is found is guilty and has no prior record,
his penalty would range from community service to
time in jail with restitution to the victim, McMullen
said.
He added that auto burglaries at Stanford have
been a "common problem" because of the large num
ber of cars on campus.
"We treat auto burglaries very seriously," Mc-
Mullen said.
