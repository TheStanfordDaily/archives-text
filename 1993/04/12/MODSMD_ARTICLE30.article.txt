### Amy Howard Editorial staff 
Stanford's "B" ice hockey team skated past a
club team from Dublin, Calif., to capture the Bay
Area championship, 9-6, at the Cow Palace last
Monday night.
The Cardinal win capped off a season in which
the team gelled and improved greatly as a whole.
Twice this year, Stanford had lost to Dublin's
Demons by one goal, and so according to forward
Peter Regan, this made the victory even sweeter.
"This win was just a great team effort," Regan
said. "Every time they got close, somebody scored
a key goal."
After two tight periods, Stanford pulled away
in the third. "After being down by two goals in the
first period, we started coming back," Kacey Fitz
patrick said. "They got tired in the third and we
took off."
Much of the scoring was courtesy of Regan. He
contributed a total of four points, including two
consecutive goals early on that brought the Cardi
nal from a 1-2 deficit to a 3-2 lead.
"He just went nuts," goalie Mason Woo said.
"He was incredibly good ... he lit it up when we
needed it."
Woo's efforts were also commended by his
team members, as he successfully defended 20
shots on goal and staved off the Demon attack.
"It was our goalie's best game. He was awe
some," Regan said.
Stanford had beaten the Demons in a playoff
scrimmage the day before the finals, and accord
ing to left wing Tom Smith — who contributed a
goal in the championship game — this bolstered

the squad's confidence.
"[The Demons] were definitely the best team in
the league," Smith said. "I think they came into
the game expecting to win, and when it became
clear at the end that we were going to, some peo
ple started taking cheap shots and checking with
their sticks.
"After the game, the ref told me it was really
cool that we had kept our heads, because it
could've gotten out of hand."
Fitzpatrick, the lone female member of the
coed team, agreed that "it was the roughest game
I've ever played in — it was brutal."
Captain Pat Burke emphasized the teamwork
that went into the victory. "Most of the teams
blew up, but we just kept our cool through the
whole thing. What won it all was the team pulling
together. There was no fighting, no internal con
flicts. Everybody had their job to do, and they did
it well."
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the win
for Stanford, however, was its unexpectedness.
Receiving no University funding, the squad
became a member of the 12-team Bay Area club
ice hockey league last summer.
Some players just started skating two years ago,
so the championship title took on extra signifi
cance. "We had a banquet on Saturday, and it was
obvious how much this win meant to the players. I
think that was the best part of it," Regan said.
This year's leading scorers, recognized at the
banquet, were right wing Kane Lai and center
Jerry Turin. According to Regan, Fae Woo Nam
also deserves recognition as "the team spark plug.
He was the most spirited player and always very
enthusiastic."
