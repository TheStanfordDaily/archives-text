# Sailors to see for whom Bell tolls

The America's Cup? Who
cares?
The Stanford sailing team
doesn't. In Northern California,
it's all about The Bell.
The North Series Perpetual
Bell. It's a 40-pound bell with
inscribed plaques that goes to
the winner of the North Series
regattas for the sailing season as
a trophy.
But it's more than that. It's a
symbol of pride, and even of
domination.
Stanford has it now, but Cali
fornia is threatening to take it
back after two years of being
Bell-deprived. In the past 40
years, the Bell has been in such
locales as UC-Santa Cruz, San
Jose State and Sonoma State —
it even spent a year in a Cal
sailor's refrigerator three years
ago. However, in the last 10
years, it has become sailing's
version of The Axe, because it
just goes back and forth across
the bay.
This may be the year that Cal
takes it back. If the Bear sailors
win the ninth and last North
Series Regatta this weekend,
they will regain the symbol of
what has become an intense
rivalry.

to Stanford two weeks ago in
Redwood City. Now the series is
tied at four-apiece, with regatta
No. 9 to decide who gets the bell.
The Cardinal sailors almost
lost the Bell last month in the
North Series 7 when they came
away with the victory in a tie
breaker.
In the crucial race, a Cal and
a Stanford boat battled for posi
tion, and both committed a
series of rule infractions. But
the Cal boat failed to do the
mandatory penalty restart. The
boat was disqualified for that
race, costing Cal the regatta and
maybe the Bell as well.
The Cardinal victory was led
by senior skipper John Emory
with junior crewmate Katherine
Chen and senior skipper Leo
Sommaripa with sophomore
crewmate Liz Clabaugh. Som
maripa and Clabaugh won their
division, while Emory and Chen
took second.
"Leo and Liz had an out
standing day. They've been one

or two places off the pace most
of the season, so it was nice to
see them go out and win," said
coach Blake Middleton.
Junior skipper Jeremy Mcln
tyre with freshman crewmate
Betsy Kennedy won their divi
sion and combined with the
efforts of Scott Sellers and Britt
Johnson for a second-place boat
finish.
Stanford also took fourth and
fifth places to seal the win.
The victory in North Series 8
was more decisive, as Stanford
gained the lead early in the day
and maintained it for the win.
Emory with Chen and Sellers
with Johnson dominated their
division throughout the day.
Emory and Chen were particu
larly consistent, as they finished
in the top three in all but one
race.
The clear victory was exem
plified and sealed in one special
race. With the wind blowing at
20 miles-per-hour, the Cardinal
sailors exploited their good
heavy-air mentality and home
water advantage to take the top
five spots.
"It's a big psychological lift to
completely dominate in certain
conditions," said Middleton.
"It gives you a certain power
with which you can influence
future races. Other teams start
thinking that they can't beat
you in those conditions."
