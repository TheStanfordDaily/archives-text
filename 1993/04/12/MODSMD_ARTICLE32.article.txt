# 'Ultimate' award
## Greeks earn recognition for community service 
### Josh Gohlke 
Stanford fraternities and
sororities recently received a
community service award for
throwing a party.
But unlike a stereotypical,
multi-keg bacchanal, the "Ulti
mate Tailgate" — for which the
Greeks won the 1992-1993
Western Regional Greek Confer
ence Community Service Award
— was a non-alcoholic party
that brought together disadvan
taged youth and local business
people.
"It was really nice to be recog
nized for something positive,"
said Heather Dunn, fraternal
affairs adviser in the Office of
Student Activities. "We get all the
negative headlines."
Held before the Stanford-Ari
zona football game, the progres
sive event involved local children
and merchants in a display of
"responsible hospitality."
This was the first time Stan
ford entered the competition, said
Dunn, who initially urged the
Stanford Interfraternity and
Intersorority Councils to apply
for the award.
The contest is open each year

to all schools west of the Rockies
with Greek systems.
Of the contest's three cate
gories, which are divided by
school size, Stanford competed in
the middle category, which con
tains the greatest number of
schools.
Rip Waters, then-president of
the IFC, said he was "kind of sur
prised" by the award and pleased
by the recognition given to the
tailgate.
"I thought the project we did
was worthwhile," said Waters,
who sat on the board that origi
nally devised the party. "I think
this is a step in the right direc
tion."
Not only Stanford, but other
schools around the country, are
now planning celebrations like
the Ultimate Tailgate, which
was the first of its kind, Waters
said.
Both Waters and Dunn said
the award was beneficial for the
reputation of fraternities and
sororities.
"People think all the Greeks do
is party," said Dunn, "but it's
tremendous the number of hours
of community service that take
place in the system."
