# Up in smoke
## Repairing damaged solar car will take 3,000 hours, $10,000 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Proudly unveiled to the
Stanford community less than
a week ago, the Stanford Solar
Car Project's vehicle, the Sun
burner, suffered severe dam
age when it caught fire Friday
night as it was being transport
ed to a test-drive site.
According to Alex Tilson, a
member of the project, damage

caused by the fire will cost an
estimated $10,000 and take
3,000 hours to repair.
Half of the solar ray — the
roof panel covered with solar
cells —was melted, and three
fourths of the car's shell was
destroyed in the fire.
In addition, the car sus
tained "significant localized
damage to 15 internal compo

nents," Tilson said. Only some
parts, including the motor and
wheels, are still usable.
Project members attribute
the fire to the car's batteries.
Though the batteries had been
separated from one another
before the trip, junior Charles
Nickel said the positive and neg
ative ends of the batteries prob
ably touched momentarily due
to the vibrations from the trail
er, causing nearby wires to send
off sparks which then ignited a
combustible foam coating.
The blaze set the project back
substantially, but group mem
bers began work on repairs
almost immediately after return
ing to campus.
While project participants
say they can make the car func
tional fairly soon, there is no
way to aerodynamically refine it
in time for a planned race in
June, said Steve Morse, a pro
ject member.
The car will still compete in
the Sunrayce, a solar car race
from Dallas to Minneapolis, but
won't have quite the perfor
mance it once did.
"It would be like driving a car
without doors and a windshield,"
Tilson said.
The repair cost will come out
of the money the group has
amassed for future races, which
will put many of their plans in
jeopardy, he said.
The group is also unsure if it
can participate in the Novem
ber 1993 World Solar Challenge
in Australia — especially since
their special fee request for the

ASSU, from which they gath
ered $32,000 last year, is also in
danger of being refused after
this mishap, Nickel said.
The solar car was being trans
ported to the San Joaquin Valley
when two of the project members
driving behind the trailer
noticed wisps of smoke stream
ing out from its back door.
"At first, we weren't sure if it
was fog or smoke," Nickel said.
"But when we saw it was smoke,
I radio-contacted |the drivers of
the trailer 1" and stopped the car.
Upon opening the trailer's
back door, the students faced "a
wall of smoke" bursting out,
beyond which the car was found
burning, he said.
Though Nickel raced for the
nearest phone and called the fire
department, the fire had burned
out by the time help came, and
the damage had been done, he
said.
'Tt's so perfectly tragic some
how," Tilson said. "Everything
that was so lovingly crafted for
thousands of hours, in the
course of 30 seconds, was
reduced to a pile of melted rub
ble."
Despite the loss, members
still feel optimistic about getting
back on their feet again.
Tilson pointed out that the
material loss of the car will not
detract from the overall learning
experience.
"We've always felt first and
foremost that this wasn't only
about building and testing a car,
but about using the car as a tool
to build and test ourselves — in
that respect, even if the car ceas
es to exist, we still walk away
with all that we have learned,"
he said.
