championed for four years. Officials say the
factory is essential in keeping the center at
the forefront of physics research, with the
additional funds offsetting the center's re
duced budget.

But the success is bittersweet. Although
funding for a B-factory is secure, pressure
from New York congressional members
might send the money into the coffers of a
laboratory at Cornell University — which
