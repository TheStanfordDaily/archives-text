# Clinton's budget may fund SLAC B-factory
## Money could go to cheaper Cornell project 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Although President Clinton's proposed
1994 budget will slice 11 percent from the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's $138
million annual funding level, SLAC officials
breathed a partial sigh of relief when the ad
ministration released its fiscal plan last
week.
The budget allots $36 million to start con
struction of the asymmetric B-factoiy, a cut
ting-edge atom smasher that SLAC has
championed for four years. Officials say the
factory is essential in keeping the center at
the forefront of physics research, with the
additional funds offsetting the center's re
duced budget.

But the success is bittersweet. Although
funding for a B-factory is secure, pressure
from New York congressional members
might send the money into the coffers of a
laboratory at Cornell University — which
has submitted a similar proposal with a final
price tag about $80 million less than the
$193 million SLAC plan.
If the Department of Energy-funded
SLAC loses the factory and then fails to con
vince the government to increase its $122
million 1994 budget, the center will have to
make some tough decisions about which of
its projects — and jobs — will survive.
SLAC officials still strongly believe they
will land the project and consider talk of lay-
ofTs hypothetical.-
"It's a little premature to be
making plans to be cutting staff
under scenarios which we think
are still very unlikely to happen,"
said Michael Riordan, assistant to
center director Burton Richter.
"We've been one of the most suc
cessful Department of Energy
labs, and they have an interest in
keeping us vital. This is the obvi
ous project (to do that)."
He noted that the Cornell lab,
run by the National Science Foun
dation, is not a national laborato
ry, and, therefore, the Energy
Department would have less of a
"vested interest" in putting the
particle collider there.
"Their natural inclination is to
give it to one of their existing labo
ratories," Riordan said. "They
would be reluctant to effectively
start another lab to do electron
physics. They have trouble enough
finding funds" for the Supercon
ducting Super Collider in Texas,
he said.
Currently the department's
High Energy Physics Advisory
Panel plans to make a decision by
October 1 — which could be too
late for a center that can't afford
to waste time while European labs
race into the future of high-pres
tige physics research.
"What we're focusing on right
now is that the review of the two
B-factoiy proposals happens in an
expeditious fashion — by July 1,"
Riordan said.
If SLAC can persuade the

administration to move up the
meeting, but still loses the B-facto
ry, "We will have won the opportu
nity to affect the budget process,
and perhaps get the money
restored to our base operating
budget," Riordan said.
Should the worst-case scenario
— loss of the B-factory and failure
to snare additional budget money
— occur, "then we have to make
some plans," he said.
For the center, whose linear
collider suffered a series of
mechanical difficulties since pow
ering-up in 1988 and only recently
has begun to perform up to par,
the potential loss of the B-factory
could spell the end to SI AG's days
on the frontier of physics research.
The two-mile-long particle col
lider has led to several important
physics discoveries, including one
that won Richter the 1976 Nobel
Prize in physics for discovering the
charm quark, a fundamental
building block of the universe.
The new atom smasher would
start unraveling the mystery of
why antimatter fails to blot out all
the matter in the universe — an
enigma experimentalists and theo
rists often cite as one of the two
most intriguing questions in parti
cle physics today, along with the
origin of mass, a puzzle
researchers hope to crack with the
super collider.
largely using leftover hardware
from previous machines, the asym
metrical B-factory would consist of
a new beam storage ring to be built
in the tunnel that houses the
Positron Electron Project ring,
SLAC's now-silent circular collider.
The new ring would carry a
beam of positrons, which would

travel through their ring in a
direction opposite that of the elec
trons. Their collisions would pro
duce subatomic B-meson particles.
Although California politicians
lobbied hard to land the funding
for the B-factory, Senate Finance
Committee chairman Rep. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan (D-New York)
took the stride out of their step.
"Moynihan came in and said,
'Wait a minute, what about us?' "
Riordan said. "Politics being what
it is, the budget was changed from
being earmarked for SI..AC to a
site to be determined by a review.
We certainly are the leading candi
date."
Karl Berkelman, director of
Cornell's Wilson Laboratory of
Nuclear Studies, emphasized only
one reason why the B-factory
should find its home in his labora
tory: the $110 million price tag. He
said he wrote a letter to the chair
of the Energy Department panel
requesting that the group conduct
an impartial technical review of
the Stanford and Cornell propos
als before awarding the B-factory.
Sounding less certain of his
lab's chances than Riordan,
Berkelman speculated, "There's a
chance that no B-factory will be
built at either place. It's probably
not better than 50-50 this year,
but maybe next year or after."
He posed a question — an
unlikely possibility, he admitted —
of whether two B-factories would
be built, one by the Energy
Department and the other by the
National Science Foundation. "It
seemed at one time that the two
were proceeding independently,"
he said. "I don't know whether
that's still true. It depends on the

availability of money and how
important it is to each group."
The B-f'actory, originally pro
posed to begin construction late
this year and to start hurling
atoms together by 1997, has trav
eled a rocky road during its gesta
tion period.
In early 1991, $10 million bud
get cuts forced SLAC to close the
Positron Electron Project and lay
off 66 workers. That year Richter
proposed building the B-factory
jointly with the University of Cali
fornia's Lawrence Berkeley Labo
ratory and Lawrence Livermore
National laboratory.
But in January 1992, the Ener
gy Department and National Sci
ence Foundation co-authored a
letter to Richter and Berkelman
stating there would be no new
money for a B-factory until at least
1997 — a move that seemed to end
hopes both for SIJ\C and Cornell.
Then Richter decided to
attempt it alone, drawing the B
factory funds out of SLAC's oper
ating budget. By trimming the
Linear Collider's operation from
nine months annually to six
months, the lab would save $35
million to $45 million each year —
enough to start the B factory in
1994 and complete it in 1998.
But while a government panel
gladly accepted the cuts, it recom
mended diverting those savings to
other colliders and delaying the B
factory at least until 1996.
However, in April 1992 the
Department of Energy panel
soundly endorsed the B-factory,
though giving it third priority for
funding after the super collider
and a new injector for the Fermi
National Lab in Chicago.
