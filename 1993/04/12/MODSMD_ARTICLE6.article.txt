# Six Kimball Hall rooms soaked after small fire
## Unattended candle causes $5,000 damage 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
An unattended candle ignited a fire in
Kimball Hall Friday night, causing about
$5,000 damage to six rooms and forcing
the evacuation of all residents.
The candle, which was left burning on a
bedside table in room 104, ignited a near
by stack of paper, according to Stanford
Fire Marshal Ray Gamma. The fire then
spread to the bedcovers and activated the
in-room sprinkler system, he said. The fire
caused no injuries and was extinguished
by the sprinlders before it could spread to
other rooms.
Two fire engines, a rescue truck, a med
ical truck, the fire chief and emergency
personnel responded to the call, which was
recorded at 11:06 p.m.
Although the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment responded in under three minutes,

the in-room sprinklers had already
drenched six rooms with close to 500 gal
lons of water.
The estimated $5,000 damage due to
water and fire includes personal belong
ings, computers and clothing in all the
rooms. The room in which the fire erupted
may also have to be repainted because of
smoke damage, Gamma said.
Ann Chen and Pat Suh, the occupants
of room 104, are currently staying with
friends until their room is cleaned up.
They might be moving into the guest room
in Kimball, said Resident Assistant Kellen
Glass. Students in the other five rooms
that incurred water damage were able to
remain in their rooms.
Suh, a sophomore, was watching televi
sion in the outer room of the two-room
double when the fire started. "All of a sud-
den I started smelling smoke,"
she said.
Suh opened the door connect
ing the two rooms and "There
was all this smoke," she said. "I
mean a lot."
After opening the door to
find a sprinkler spurting out
water in Chen's dark and smoky
room, Suh dialed 911.
Chen was not in her room
when the fire ignited.
Firefighters attributed the
blaze's containment to the
sprinkler system. "If it hadn't
been for the sprinkler system,
we would have had a major
fire," Gamma said.
"The building system did
what it is supposed to do." The
sprinklers activated when the
room's temperature reached
155 degrees, he said.
Evacuated students were
allowed back into their rooms
after one and a half hours.
"Most people thought (the
alarm] was a joke," said Eleanor
Lo, a Kimball resident.
But when the dorm was evac
uated and students saw the
emergency vehicles and fire
fighters, they realized it wasn't a
prank, Lo said.
"People didn't know there
was a fire. They thought some
one had gotten drunk and pulled
the alarm," Kimball Resident
Assistant Meredith Broome said.
The residents on the upper
floors thought the alarm was
just a drill, she added.
Stanford Facilities workers
and firefighters started clean-up
efforts by vacuuming the water
that night.
