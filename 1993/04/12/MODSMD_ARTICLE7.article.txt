# MBA Inequity
## Recent study shows men out-earn women 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Stanford Business School graduates may start
out on roughly equal footing, but two recent studies
show that men soon outdistance women in salary
and promotions.
And once the MBA recipients marry, the pay gap
widens to a chasm, according to a report compiled by
Business School Prof. Thomas Harrell.
"It is women who have babies and women who do
more housework," Harrell said. But he added that
accounting for lifestyle choices does not explain the
differences in the survey of 855 graduates; the re
sults strongly suggest discrimination is very real.
Harrell's study found that women who graduat
ed between 1973 and 1985 not only earned less, but
were less satisfied with their jobs, progressed more
slowly in their careers and showed more emotional
strain.
Single women earned an average of $106,146 in
1987, 14 percent less than men working the same
number of hours. Married women lost even more
ground, making $101,124 — 30 percent less than
married men's $144,461.
"There is a more even playing field when mar
riage is not involved," Harrell said, explaining that
married women usually contribute more to house
work and may act as a "hostess" for their husbands.
Career choice also affects salaries, he added. For
example, there are few women working in high-level
positions on Wall Street, and more women start
their own businesses than head large companies,
Harrell said.
Jobs in the higher-income occupations — invest
ment banking, consulting and corporate finance —
are often "guarded more zealously" by men, ex
plained School of Education Prof. Myra Strober.
"The kinds of hoops men and women have to
jump through are oriented toward men who have a
wife to attend to the other parts of their lives," she
said.
One of Strober's students, Deborah Kazal-
Thresher, analyzed Harrell's data for her disserta
tion.

hours, experience, job responsibilities, occupations
or industries, unemployment and part-time work
