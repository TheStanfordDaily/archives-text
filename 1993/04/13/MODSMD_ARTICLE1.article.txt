# Pick a number...
## Students will draw from box 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Plans to convert the annual
housing draw into an entirely
computerized process have been
delayed for a year or longer, al
lowing students to pick their lot
tery numbers by hand at least
one last time.
The computerized draw will
be delayed until the Network for
Student Information, which
maintains Axess, completes a
project to increase the efficiency
of the campus computer net
work.
Eventually, students will bfe
able to turn in their residence
preference lists for the spring
housing lottery and receive draw
allotments through Axess in
stead of hand-picking numbers
at a temporary office set up in
Tresidder Union.
According to Bill Georges, di
rector of the Housing Center,
the improved computer network
is needed help the draw program
run smoothly. Its installation
has taken longer than expected,
pushing back the computerized
process.
When instituted, the comput
erized draw should help cut
labor costs and save the Housing
Center thousands of dollars an
nually; the center's budget has
been slashed by a third over the
past few years, Georges said.
For example, the Housing
Center will no longer have to
hire about 30 students every
spring to gather and sort out
draw bids.
Although computerization
was delayed this year, several
other changes planned for Stan
ford housing next year will go
into effect.
One change is a "preferred
housing" system that will re
place the old guaranteed/un
guaranteed housing system.
Starting with the this year's
freshmen, students will no
longer have an unguaranteed
year.
Instead, for their three years
in the draw, students will have
two years of preferred housing,
in which they will draw in the
top 3,000 spots. For the other
year, students will select num
bers between 3,000 and 5,000.
Under the old system, stu
dents had two guaranteed years
in which they drew in the top
3,000 and an unguaranteed year
in which they drew up to 5,000
and had a chance of not receiving
any housing at all. The unpre
ferred year differs from the
unguaranteed year in that stu
dents will never be forced to find
off-campus housing.
Other changes include new
and relocated dormitories.
The American Studies House

will shift from 556 Mayfield Ave.
to Murray House in Governor's
Corner beginning next fall. The
current American Studies House
will become a non-theme, self
operated house.
Throe new focus houses will
be added to the draw list — Cas
tario will become a world affairs
house, Lantana will be a commu
nity service house and Robinson
will focus on environmental
issues.
Crothers Memorial Hall will
become an entirely graduate dor
mitory because of a lack of grad
uate housing and the completion
of Lantana and Castano for
undergraduates.
The Betas will also participate
in this year's Rush to regain
their house at 557 Mayfield.
