South Africa settles down
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — Blacks angered by the assassina
tion of black leader Chris Hani threw
stones and shot at police and journalists
in a Johannesburg township yesterday,
but the country generally was calm.
Leaders of black groups urged their
followers to refrain from violence. They
called for widespread demonstrations
and a one-day strike in Johannesburg
this week to protest Hani's killing.
Police, meanwhile, said they found a
suspected "hit list" of politicians and
several guns in the home of the white
man suspected in Saturday's killing. A
white extremist group confirmed the
suspect was a member, but there was no
claim of responsibility for the killing.
Violence erupted in the Katlehong
black township outside Johannesburg
after a protest rally by about 1,500 people.
1,000 Azerbaijanis missing
DASHKESAN, Azerbaijan (AP) - A
new refugee tragedy may be unfolding in
the snowy mountain ranges of this for

mer Soviet republic.
Relief officials and refugees fear that
more than 1,000 Azerbaijani civilians
fleeing Armenian attacks may have been
trapped in bitter winter conditions.
Already, some survivors have spoken
of leaving behind scores of women, chil
dren and elderly people who were too
cold and exhausted to continue a 21-mile
trek over the Dashkesan mountain
range to safety. Some said they saw dead
bodies along the route.
As fighting intensified late last month
between Armenia and Azerbaijan, tens
of thousands of Azerbaijanis fled the
western Kelbajar region, evacuated by
helicopters and trucks, or by hiking
across steep, snowy mountains.
Officials and U.N. relief workers said
about 5,000 people have made it across
the Dashkesan range to the city of Kel
bajar. But only three people arrived on
April 9, and the trickle has stopped since
then, they said Sunday.
"We doubt any more people will
arrive," said Sahib Sadiqov, a physi
cian in charge of a relief center at the
foot of the mountains 30 miles north of
Kelbajar.
