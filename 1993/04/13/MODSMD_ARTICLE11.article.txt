# U.N. enforces Bosnia flight ban

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — NATO warplanes patrolled
above an overcast Bosnia yesterday to
begin enforcing a U.N. no-fly zone in
the first flexing of the alliance's mili
tary muscle outside its territory.
There were no reports of confronta
tions, and a top Bosnian Serb comman
der said his troops had been told not to
interfere with the NATO mission.
A French Mirage 2000 jet went
down in the Adriatic Sea due to engine
failure, said the French Defense Min
istry's news service. The pilot was res
cued, it said.
The flights were meant to impress
Bosnian Serbs — the faction most
often accused of breaking the 6-month
old ban on military flights — of new
resolve to enforce U.N. resolutions
meant to end Bosnia's civil war.
But Operation Deny Flight had
more political than military signifi
cance. The year-long war has primarily
been fought with artillery, tanks and
infantry. NATO pilots were under
strict orders to shoot only as a last
resort.

the NATO operation as more evidence
of international bias in favor of

A U.N. official said at least 56 people
died in an hour-long barrage, including
15 children.
"It's an attack on civilians. Anything
that kills 15 children — that's crimi
nal," said John McMillan, a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Sartyevo. Another 90 peo
ple were wounded in the attack, he said.
Allied planes are policing Bosnia
from bases across the Adriatic in Italy.
Two U.S. Air Force F-15 jet fighters,
two French Mirage 2000 sand two
Dutch F-16s flew the first mission.
AWACs surveillance planes manned by
multinational crews and Navy jets on
the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt also are
participating.
NATO officials declined to discuss
specifically how violators would be
dealt with. But they said previously
that NATO pilots would try to order
violators back home or force them to
land. Shooting down violators would be
the last resort, and ground positions
could be fired on only in self-defense.
There were no reports of the NATO

planes confronting any aircraft yester
day.
Manojlo Milovanovic, the deputy
commander of Bosnian Serb forces,
told Serbian television in Belgrade that
his men had received orders "not to
provoke anyone" to avoid interfering
with the NATO flights.
The show of international will to
end the war took a step back yesterday
when the U.N. Security Council decid
ed to postpone a vote on tightening eco
nomic sanctions on Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia.
The sanctions are to be tightened to
force Serbia to pressure its Bosnian
Serb allies to accept a peace plan
already signed by their Muslim and
Croat rivals. -
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei
Kozyrev said in Moscow that the delay
would give the Serbs a "last chance" to
agree to the peace plan. But he said
that if the two-week-old Bosnian cease
fire did not generally hold, the Security
Council would have to resort to "most
decisive measures."
At Russia's request, the vote will
now be held a day after Russia's April
25 referendum on President Boris
Yeltsin's leadership.
