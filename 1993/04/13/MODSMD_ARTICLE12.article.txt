LUCASVILLE, Ohio (AP) -
Part of Ohio's only maximum
security prison remained under
siege yesterday after hundreds of
prisoners rioted, killing six inmates
and taking eight guards hostage.
There was conflicting informa
tion about whether the riot was
racially motivated. All six dead
prisoners were white, but some
inmates who were injured were
black. Officials wouldn't say if
there were any blacks among the
hostages.
"Certainly it could be racially
motivated, but there is also infor
mation to presume that it may not
be the case," said Reginald Wilkin
son, director of the Department of
Rehabilitation and Correction. He
wouldn't elaborate.
Wilkinson said the disturbance
Sunday afternoon that preceded
the hostage-taking may have been
a ruse. "It appears as if there was a
staged fight," he said.
Guards were called to break up

the apparent fight, which involved
a few prisoners. "That's when sev
eral hostages were taken. But a
number of officers also were able to
break away from that situation,"
Wilkinson said at a news confer
ence in Columbus.
About 450 prisoners were barri
caded inside one cellblock of the
prison, located about 70 miles
south of Columbus in south-cen
tral Ohio. The rest of the prison's
1,819 inmates, including death
row inmates, were confined to cells
away from the affected area.
Negotiators tried to work out a
deal with some of the state's most
dangerous prisoners, asking them
to free one hostage in exchange for
a chance to outline their demands
to the media.
Ten guards and eight inmates
were injured. Authorities said the
eight hostages were alive.
Late yesterday afternoon, pris
oners hung four sheets out win
dows of the cellblock. One sheet

said, "We want to talk to the FBI."
Another said, "The state is not
negotiating." Reporters were kept
too far away to be able to read the
other two signs.
Negotiations were continuing
last night, said Sharron Kornegay,
a spokeswoman for the Ohio
Department of Rehabilitation and
Correction.
The prisoners "are tired and
hungry.... We are at a very sensi
tive stage," she told reporters out
side the 69-acre prison.
Officials cut off electricity and
water to the cellblock, and refused
to deliver food. Prisoners were last
fed at about noon Sunday, but they
may have stored some food in their
lockers, she said. They didn't ask
for food or medicine by yesterday
evening.
The bodies of five inmates, all
Severely beaten, were released
early yesterday. The sixth body,
also beaten, was thrown through a
cellblock door later in the morning.
