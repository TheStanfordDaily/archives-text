# L.A. prepares for King verdict
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hundreds of National
Guard troops reported to staging areas yesterday
and civil rights leaders pleaded for restraint as a
federal jury deliberated the case of four policemen
accused of beating Rodney King.
Shielded from the public's jitters and the police
buildup, the 12 jurors resumed their talks after
meeting Sunday afternoon. Late yesterday they
headed back to the hotel where they were being
sequestered.
They asked U.S. District Judge John G. Davies
if they could take their trial notes back to the
hotel. He said no.
Jurors have deliberated for 15 hours since Sat
urday. They were to resume their talks this morn
ing.
Scores of TV trucks surrounded the downtown
courthouse, while across town, guardsmen
banged their rifle butts on the bed of a troop truck
in a display of spirit at California National Guard
headquarters in Inglewood.
About 600 guardsmen had reported to area
armories by yesterday morning and the Los Ange
les Police Department put 200 extra officers on
the streets at all times in case a verdict in the case
triggered violence.
However, operations will be routine until the
jury reaches a verdict, both agencies said.
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno approved up

to $1 million in federal funds for police overtime
following the verdict, Gov. Pete Wilson's office
announced yesterday.
Deadly rioting broke out last spring after Sgt.
Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell and
Theodore Briseno and former Officer Timothy Wind
were acquitted of most charges in a state trial.
In this federal trial, the four white officers
were charged with violating the black motorist's
civil rights during a beating after a highway chase
on March 3, 1991.
Powell, accused of striking the most blows
against King, said at the courthouse yesterday
that throughout the trial he kept asking himself if
he and the other officers did everything necessary
for their defense.
"I think we did and I think we will be acquit
ted," he said. "But that 1 percent that might not
be is real worrisome."
The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, newly elected lead
er of the NAACP, said yesterday he was concerned
about the buildup of "military apparatus" in Los
Angeles. He compared the heightened alert to the
way the United States geared up for war with
Iraq.
"Law enforcement officials have the responsi
bility to keep order," he said. "But what I'm say
ing is, I want to make sure we don't go too far and
wind up doing something that is provocative."
