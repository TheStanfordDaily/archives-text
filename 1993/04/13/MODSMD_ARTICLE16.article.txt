AASA $36,226
®YES O NO
The Asian American Students Association
works to promote awareness of Asian-
American identity and heritage and to advo
cate Asian-American issues. Their frequent
cultural and social activities speak well of
the organization, despite a troublesome,
persistent pattern of budget surpluses and
events that were funded but not held, partic
ulars not found in comparable organiza
tions.
ASSU Speakers $77,364
Bureau
DYES O NO
By far one of the most efficient and useful
groups funded by special fees, the Speak
ers Bureau facilitates intellectual discussion
at Stanford through its efforts to bring
notable personalities to campus.

Assistance
NO RECOMMENDATION*
BSU $36,036
DYES O NO
The Black Student Union, while continuing
its various cultural and community events,
will be eliminating the salaries given to its

ting move that speaks volumes regarding
its workers' dedication and efforts. In
addition, the BSU will be instituting a com
munity-service program that will serve to
link Stanford to outside communities.
Club Sports $153,702
®YES O NO
All Stanford students should be familiar with
Club Sports, which funds and assists 18
groups ranging from badminton to windsurf
ing. The Athletic Department's decision to
eliminates its funding of this organization
makes the ASSU special fee all the more
important for the continuation of club athlet
ics at Stanford.
Coalition Against $52,280
Sexual Assault
DYES O NO
Much of this group's request goes to the
salary of Caroline Mitchell, a dedicated work
er who should be offered a similar, Universi
ty-funded position. CASA's self-defense
class and consultation services make it an
invaluable resource for Stanford students.
Coalition $20,612
for Original
Music by Stanford Students
OYES DNO
A noble effort, designed to support and
showcase student bands, but one which
suffers from a vagueness of proposed fes
tival planning. If the organizers of COMSS
were to reduce its expenditures and focus
more on smaller, more frequent concerts,
it would be far easier to endorse its
efforts.
Graduate $24,200
Student Association
OYES DNO
A voluntary happy-hour association, the
GSA attempts to add a social aspect to
graduate student life, but their request for
ASSU funding for their social events should
be denied.
KZSU $100,827
®YES O NO
The 24-hour programming and media
experience offered by KZSU make the
radio station an invaluable element of
Stanford's communications and identity; in
addition, recent activities such as Hip-Hop
Night illustrate KZSU's involvement 'n the
community.
Legal Counseling $82,470
<§>YES O NO
The civil and criminal aid that Jewel Hudson
and the Legal Counseling Office provide
has saved Stanford students untold
amounts of time and money.

and campus involvement renders it an
invaluable cultural resource for all Stanford
students.
Project Motivation $10,764

tion's once-at-risk students Into Stanford
demonstrates the success of this group in
informing youths of the value of higher edu
cation.

Rape Education $20,955
Project
(DYES O NO
The REP publishes Confronting Rape, a
pamphlet distributed during orientation,
and organizes Rape Awareness Week.
Unfortunately, it only marginally coordi
nates its activities with CASA, thereby
fragmenting two groups striving toward a
similar goal.
SCBN $44,913
(DYES O NO
While SCBN's output this year has been
slight, this lack of production is more due to
the group's novelty rather than any incom
petence or lack of drive on the part of its
workers. With the hiring of a long-anticipat
ed program director and organizers' ambi
tious programming plans for next year,
SCBN promises to be significantly more
successful in '93-'94.
Stanford $31,520
American Indian
Organization
(DYES O NO
The SAIO's annual Pow Wow is perhaps
Stanford's most important and well-attended
cultural gathering, drawing participants from

cess.
Stanford Axe $27,780
Committee
(DYES O NO
Almost all of the Axe Committee's funding
goes directly to the Bonfire Rally and the Big
Game Bash and Sing-off. A vote against the
Axe Committee is akin to a vote for UC-
Berkeley.
Stanford Band $51,420
(LSJUMB)
DYES O NO
At $51,420, the Band is a bargain compared
to the cost of orchestras at other universi
ties. With the Music Department no longer
funding this group, the fee request consti
tutes over 50 percent of its budget.
Stanford Daily $58,565
NO RECOMMENDATION
Stanford $11,693
Homelessness
Action Committee
NO RECOMMENDATION*
Stanford In $41,437
Government

this year reflects the higher expenses associ
ated with the Sacramento internships.
Stanford Project $6,773
on Nutrition
(DYES O NO

teers distributes food that would otherwise
go to waste to area food banks and soup
kitchens. An excellent example of innovative
Stanford students reaching out to surround
ing communities.

Project

Stanford Solar $29,133
Car Project
DYES O NO
The only ASSU-funded scientific explo
ration, the Solar Car Project is perhaps the
only organization at Stanford still attempting
to find new trails to blaze. It represents the
scientific daring and dedication that all Stan
ford students share.
Stanford $12,000
Symphony
Orchestra
O YES DNO
Approximately one-half of the Orchestra's
budget will be devoted to its annual retreat.

munity that is not obsessed with and over

University.
Stanford $25,734
Women's Center
(DYES O NO
The SWC provides a haven for the Society
of Women Engineers, Cap and Gown,
Inter-Sorority Council, National Women's

nates the efforts of volunteers to teach
English in Eastern Europe as well as bring
ing foreign students to Stanford.
Students for $15,626
Environmental Action
at Stanford
(DYES O NO

Stanford's primary environmental organiza
tion, SEAS's Students for Environmental
EDucation program and its grassroots
efforts for stricter environmental policies at
Stanford are both worthy candidates for
support.
You Can $17,546
Make A Difference
Conference
(DYES O NO
The You Can Make A Difference Confer
ence has, in the past, brought speakers
such as Ted Koppel and Tom Brokaw to
campus; the ASSU fee request will see that
Stanford remains a forum for the discussion
of pivotal social issues.
Publications $50,383
Board
(DYES O NO
The publications board supports a legion of
campus publications; however, in a time of
budget cuts, to expand greatly upon its
budget would be wrongheaded.
Program $161,120
Board
+5%
This appropriations and budgetary group
has been effective. Yet it needs to keep a
closer eye on the discrepancies between
promises made and promises kept.

Stanford's commitment to aiding the com
munities around us.

MEChA's wide array of activities, festivals
and campus involvement renders it an
invaluable cultural resource for all Stanford
students.
Project Motivation $10,764

demonstrates the success of this group in
informing youths of the value of higher edu

Rape Education $20,955
Project
(DYES O NO
The REP publishes Confronting Rape, a
pamphlet distributed during orientation,
and organizes Rape Awareness Week.
Unfortunately, it only marginally coordi
nates its activities with CASA, thereby
fragmenting two groups striving toward a
similar goal.
SCBN $44,913
(DYES O NO
While SCBN's output this year has been
slight, this lack of production is more due to
the group's novelty rather than any incom
petence or lack of drive on the part of its
workers. With the hiring of a long-anticipat
ed program director and organizers' ambi
tious programming plans for next year,
SCBN promises to be significantly more
successful in '93-'94.
Stanford $31,520
American Indian
Organization
(DYES O NO
The SAIO's annual Pow Wow is perhaps
Stanford's most important and well-attended
cultural gathering, drawing participants from

Committee
(DYES O NO
Almost all of the Axe Committee's funding
goes directly to the Bonfire Rally and the Big
Game Bash and Sing-off. A vote against the

Berkeley.
Stanford Band $51,420
(LSJUMB)
DYES O NO
At $51,420, the Band is a bargain compared
to the cost of orchestras at other universi
ties. With the Music Department no longer

Stanford Solar $29,133
Car Project
DYES O NO
The only ASSU-funded scientific explo

only organization at Stanford still attempting

Stanford $12,000
Symphony
Orchestra
O YES DNO
Approximately one-half of the Orchestra's
budget will be devoted to its annual retreat.
While the Stanford Symphony Orchestra is
certainly a significant cultural resource, it
should not ask students to pay for another
trip to Disneyland.

Stanford $62,040

Stanford remains a forum for the discussion
of pivotal social issues.
Publications $50,383

The publications board supports a legion of
campus publications; however, in a time of
budget cuts, to expand greatly upon its
budget would be wrongheaded.

This appropriations and budgetary group
has been effective. Yet it needs to keep a
closer eye on the discrepancies between

The Asian American Students Association
works to promote awareness of Asian-
American identity and heritage and to advo

BSU $36,036
DYES O NO
The Black Student Union, while continuing
its various cultural and community events,
will be eliminating the salaries given to its

its workers' dedication and efforts. In
addition, the BSU will be instituting a com
munity-service program that will serve to
link Stanford to outside communities.
Club Sports $153,702
®YES O NO
All Stanford students should be familiar with
Club Sports, which funds and assists 18
groups ranging from badminton to windsurf

Coalition Against $52,280
Sexual Assault
DYES O NO
Much of this group's request goes to the
salary of Caroline Mitchell, a dedicated work

class and consultation services make it an
invaluable resource for Stanford students.
Coalition $20,612
for Original
Music by Stanford Students
OYES DNO
A noble effort, designed to support and
showcase student bands, but one which

more on smaller, more frequent concerts,
it would be far easier to endorse its
efforts.
Graduate $24,200
Student Association
OYES DNO
A voluntary happy-hour association, the

graduate student life, but their request for
ASSU funding for their social events should
