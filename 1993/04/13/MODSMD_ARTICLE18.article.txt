## It takes a real man to rush 
### 
I NEVER WANTED to be in a sorority.
As if my lower abdomen and complete
lack of "scrunchies" weren't good
encugh reasons to exclude myself, well —
I'll just go ahead and admit it — I've
never been good with paint pens.
So once again, I sat out sorority rush
this year along with every other male on
campus. Every other male, that is, except
one.
He did what other men would do only
after imbibing a good deal of mind-alter
ing substances or acquiring heavy gam
bling debts. He tried to enter sorority
rush. He did it sober.
Sure, I know this whole gender
switching/confusion thing has been going
on for some time. I saw "The Crying
Game." I've seen "Kids in the Hall." I
even voted for people named "Barbara"
and "Dianne" for Senate.
But a guy rushing a sorority? That
goes straight past breaking down gender
barriers to self-torture. And call me Jesse
Helms, but doesn't it just plain seem
weird? In your heart of hearts, I think
you do.
This day and age rightly loathes artifi
cial distinctions based on gender. Howard
Stern excluded, most of us cheered when
female politicians gained office, when
"Thelma and Louise" became a major hit
and when the Tampa Bay Lightning
signed a female goalie.
But we can't forget that the male and

the female are simply two different
beasts. Each gender has a number of
peculiar tastes, habits and social patterns
best left unshared with the other:
• Smoking jackets — Men
• Fishing — Men
• Angora sweaters — Women
• Bowling shirts — Men
• Name of "Bart" — Men
• Baby showers — Women
• Go to the bathroom in groups of two
or more — Women
• Wearing spouse's upper-body under
garments around the house — Women
• Beernuts — Men
• Lincoln Mark VII — Men
• Name of "Gertrude" — Women
And last, but not least confusing:
• Sororities — Women r
It is these quirks, of which the opposite
sex can have only a dim understanding,
which makes for the sometimes tragic,
sometimes beautiful relationship
between men and women.
And in some strange kind of Bob
Roberts, fundamentalist Christian way, I
think the traditional pattern is just fine.
Let the men have the name "Bart" and
let the women have their sororities.
Not only do women gain self-esteem
from being a part of an all-female group,
but it is perhaps only female sorority
members who can understand the impor
tance of calling aqua "teal," wearing
those Dutch-looking clopper shoes and

using words like "rally" on a regular
basis. Lord knows I don't.
Sororities constitute one of the
"multi-" cultures we hear so much
about. It may be a little too suburban
shopping-mall-influenced for some, but
it's a culture just the same.
We males are free to observe and
interact with it at the SAE house any
time we like, but cannot be be a part of
that culture any more than I can be a
part of the African-American one.
I admire the "sorority guy," if not for
the guts it must have taken to try to sign
up for rush, then for the mental forti
tude to be willing to stand so many
hours of it. No sorority asked him to join
their group, and although I do admire
the man, I can't blame the women for
leaving him out.
He didn't belong there. No man
belongs there, not with all that nail pol
ish around.
Much as it hurts to say, men just
wouldn't be stellar pledges.

John Ford is hurt that he didn't make the
third round of Sorority Rush, and he
thinks Chi Omega really should have cut
that short girl instead of him.
