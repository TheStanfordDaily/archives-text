## Patel develops game, becomes leader for Stanford 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
For two years, Vimal Patel blasted
every tennis ball that came his way at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium. He
never said much, he just slammed and
sliced his way into the Cardinal start
ing lineup, and eventually to a 23-5
record last season.
This year, the junior from Owens
boro, Ky., is becoming a more diverse
player on the court and a more expres
sive, assertive leader off the court.
"Instead of pounding every ball, I'm
trying to focus on using more strategy
and letting my game win [the match]
by causing the other guy to make mis
takes," he said.
"He's posed to take a gigantic leap,"
said coach Dick Gould. "Vimal has
been really receptive this year. (He
realizes that) he needs a new gear to
use."
By changing Patel's serve a little
and encouraging him to come up to the
net off a return, coaches are showing
Patel alternatives to his old style of
pounding every ball.
"(His style) held him back a lot,"
Gould said. "If things were not going
right he'd try to hit even harder and
that could change the direction of the
whole match. Our job, as coaches, is to
give him the confidence to do in
matches the things he does in prac
tice."
The work seems to be paying off. No.
99 Patel, playing third singles, sports a
15-3 record this season — virtually the
best on the team. The last few matches
have been especially big confidence
boosters to Patel, who won back-to
back three-setters against Arizona and
Arizona State last weekend, as well as a
close match against Fresno State where
he won a tiebreaker in the second set to
clinch his victory.
"Up to now I've been struggling," he
said. "I've been trying to do so many
things with my game that I've just felt
fatigued — mentally I just wasn't there.
But this weekend was big for me
because I pulled out a couple of grinder
matches. Once you do that, your confi
dence shoots up."
Patel's confidence in doubles has
skyrocketed as well. His pairing with
Robert Devens, who has a

similar playing style, originally raised
some skepticism on the part of both
players. All doubts have subsided now,
however, as the duo has lost only one
of their last seven matches.
"After last weekend I am very, very
comfortable playing with [Devens].
Our games are quite similar but we're
learning to work together," he said.
"We're both aggressive players who
expect the other guy to do something
(after we make a good shot). But now
we realize that, so when Rob makes a
good shot I'll cover for him (and vice
versa)."
Patel has not only changed his game
style this season, but he has stepped
up and become one of the off-court
leaders of the team as well.
"He's a real quiet guy, and for the
first few years you never quite knew
what he was thinking," Gould said.
"He's really blossomed this year and
come into his own. His influence with
the younger guys on the team has
been tremendously positive. He is
more of a 'we' team-player than an
'I/me' player."
Gould attributes much of Patel's
leadership to his experience with two
very different Cardinal squads. As a
freshman, Patel was part of a highly
touted team that was supposed to
slaughter the competition at the
NCAA Championships. Unfortunate
ly, the team didn't even reach the
finals.
Last year, Stanford didn't attract
much attention, since over half of the
starters were sophomores who hadn't
even played during the previous sea

son. Yet, the Cardinal surprised every
one by sweeping Notre Dame in singles
to win the national title.
"Vimal has been on a winning team
and on a team that lost (at NCAAs)
and he sees the kinds of things that
need to be done in order to make this
a winning team. He is not reticent
when it comes to [pointing things
out). It is a very positive style of lead
ership," Gould said.
So what does the future hold for
the 1993 Cardinal squad? Patel feels
that team unity (or lack of it) will
make or break a team at the NCAA
Tournament.
"A big part of NCAAs comes down to
team dynamics," he explained. "Some
players do their own thing and others
play for the team. I think that one rea
son why we won last year is because
the team was so close."
Although this year's squad may not
be quite at the level of last year's Car
dinal underdogs, Patel believes that a
successful NCAA tournament is not
out of the question.
"I think we're a notch below where
we were last year at this time . . . but
we're constantly improving, which is
what we were doing last year also.
"Last year we were so confident in
(Alex O'Brien's and Jason Yee's] abili
ty to win that it gave us confidence,"
he continued. "This year we don't have
that, but during the last few matches
we've seen that we can pull out any
thing. . . . The key will be to eliminate
stupid errors — nothing flashy or
fancy, just solid tennis."
