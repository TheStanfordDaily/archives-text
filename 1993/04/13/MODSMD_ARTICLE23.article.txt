# Baseball succumbs to Spartans' offensive onslaught, 11-3
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Is it a case of the Monday Blues? The
Cardinal dropped to 1-5 on Monday after
being swamped 11-3 by San Jose State at
Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon.
"We were never in the game," said Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess. "We just didn't
play very well at all."
Stanford (18-15 overall), which had

improved its standing in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division with con
secutive series victories over California
and USC, surrendered four runs in the
first Inning and fell behind 11-1 before
scoring twice in the bottom of the ninth.
"It's one of those games that we have to
put behind us," said designated hitter
Steve Carver. "We need to improve our
mental attitude at the plate. We tend to
take ourselves out of games."
But Stanford would have needed a whole
lot of offense to combat the Spartans (24-
13) yesterday.
San Jose State left fielder Angelo Leber
led the game off with his third home run of
the season, as the Spartans jumped to a 4-
0 first-inning lead.
"The first inning was really important,"
said Spartan head coach Sam Piraro. "We
got off to a quick start, and it's important
to get a jump on Stanford."
The Cardinal put a run on the board in
the fourth. Singles by Carver and Jed
Hansen and a walk to Brodie Van Wagenen
loaded the bases for Rod Meyer, who
brought home Hansen when he was hit by
a Mike Rausch fastball.
But a single run was all that Stanford

managed to pull from the situation. The
Cardinal stranded 14 men overall.
"Teams that are aggressive at the plate
tend to get the breaks," Carver said. "And
we're not being aggressive."
"When you get three runs on 12 or 13
hits, you're obviously not getting the hits
when you need them," Marquess said.
The longball caused problems for Stan
ford again in the sixth. With two men
aboard, Laverne Thomas drove a Matt
Marenghi (2-2) offering over the score
board in left field to give San Jose State a 7-
1 edge.
Mario Iglesias relieved Marenghi with
two runners aboard. On a 1-0 count, the
Spartans' Gerad Cawhorn put the game
virtually out of reach with San Jose
State's third home run of the game. His
three-run shot gave San Jose State a 10-1
edge.
With both Dan Reed and Todd Bartels
seeing extended action on Saturday, Mar
quess went deep into his bullpen yesterday.
Freshman Dan Ripoll pitched the
eighth, giving up a run on two hits,
while left fielder/designated hitter Nate
Olmstead worked the final frame. Olm
stead, a junior, recorded two strikeouts

in his first-ever collegiate pitching
appearance.
"I was pleased with both Dan and Nate,"
Marquess said. "It's a little bit easier to
pitch in the situations that they were in,
but they got the job done."
The Cardinal closed out scoring in the
ninth, picking up two runs on RBI singles
from Hansen and Dusty Allen.
Stanford, who travels today to face UC-
Davis, will be playing its fifth game in six
days. But the team's problems cannot be
blamed on fatigue, according to Marquess.
"fSan Jose Statel was in the same boat
we were," the coach said. "They've played a
lot of games lately, but they didn't seem
tired.
"If we're tired, then they must sleep bet
ter than us."
Cardinal Notes
Three position players have now taken the
mound for Stanford: Olmstead, Meyer (twice)
and catcher-outfielder Jimmy Noriega . . . The
Cardinal does not play at home again until Ari
zona comes to town April 23 through 25 . . .
Stanford visits San Jose State on April 20 for a
one-game rematch at Municipal Stadium in San
Jose.

Is it a case of the Monday Blues? The
Cardinal dropped to 1-5 on Monday after
being swamped 11-3 by San Jose State at
Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon.
"We were never in the game," said Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess. "We just didn't
play very well at all."
Stanford (18-15 overall), which had

improved its standing in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division with con
secutive series victories over California
and USC, surrendered four runs in the
first Inning and fell behind 11-1 before
scoring twice in the bottom of the ninth.
"It's one of those games that we have to
put behind us," said designated hitter
Steve Carver. "We need to improve our
mental attitude at the plate. We tend to
take ourselves out of games."
But Stanford would have needed a whole
lot of offense to combat the Spartans (24-
13) yesterday.
San Jose State left fielder Angelo Leber
led the game off with his third home run of
the season, as the Spartans jumped to a 4-
0 first-inning lead.
"The first inning was really important,"
said Spartan head coach Sam Piraro. "We
got off to a quick start, and it's important
to get a jump on Stanford."
The Cardinal put a run on the board in
the fourth. Singles by Carver and Jed
Hansen and a walk to Brodie Van Wagenen
loaded the bases for Rod Meyer, who
brought home Hansen when he was hit by
a Mike Rausch fastball.
But a single run was all that Stanford

managed to pull from the situation. The
Cardinal stranded 14 men overall.
"Teams that are aggressive at the plate
tend to get the breaks," Carver said. "And
we're not being aggressive."
"When you get three runs on 12 or 13
hits, you're obviously not getting the hits
when you need them," Marquess said.
The longball caused problems for Stan
ford again in the sixth. With two men
aboard, Laverne Thomas drove a Matt
Marenghi (2-2) offering over the score
board in left field to give San Jose State a 7-
1 edge.
Mario Iglesias relieved Marenghi with
two runners aboard. On a 1-0 count, the
Spartans' Gerad Cawhorn put the game
virtually out of reach with San Jose
State's third home run of the game. His
three-run shot gave San Jose State a 10-1
edge.
With both Dan Reed and Todd Bartels
seeing extended action on Saturday, Mar
quess went deep into his bullpen yesterday.
Freshman Dan Ripoll pitched the
eighth, giving up a run on two hits,
while left fielder/designated hitter Nate
Olmstead worked the final frame. Olm
stead, a junior, recorded two strikeouts

in his first-ever collegiate pitching
appearance.
"I was pleased with both Dan and Nate,"
Marquess said. "It's a little bit easier to
pitch in the situations that they were in,
but they got the job done."
The Cardinal closed out scoring in the
ninth, picking up two runs on RBI singles
from Hansen and Dusty Allen.
Stanford, who travels today to face UC-
Davis, will be playing its fifth game in six
days. But the team's problems cannot be
blamed on fatigue, according to Marquess.
"fSan Jose Statel was in the same boat
we were," the coach said. "They've played a
lot of games lately, but they didn't seem
tired.
"If we're tired, then they must sleep bet
ter than us."
