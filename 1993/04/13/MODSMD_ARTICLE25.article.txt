# Men's golf travels to Far Western tourney
## 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf
team returns to Pasatiempo
Golf Club in Santa Cruz, Calif.,
Tuesday and Wednesday for the
1993 Far Western Intercolle
giate.
According to coach Wally
Goodwin, "This is the course
last spring where [the] squad
first started coming together."
That team tied for third in the
Pasatiempo tournament, and
went on to win the Pacific 10
Conference Championship.
This year's team is a much
younger edition of the Cardinal,
with only sophomores Steve
Burdick and Jerry Chang
returning. In last year's tourna
ment, they both shot 74 on the
par-71 course on the final day of
competition.
Pasatiempo is one of the old
est courses in Northern Califor
nia, and its 6,500 yards are
made difficult by narrow fair
ways and many natural haz
ards. According to Goodwin, dis
ciplined shots and a strong
short game will be the keys to
success.
Goodwin described last

week's Southwestern Intercol
legiate Open, played on the
North Ranch golf course in
Westlake Village, Calif., as
"fun."
"I had no great expecta
tions," he said. "It was a beauti
ful course, but a little too tough
for our last few guys."
It was not too tough for Bur
dick, however, as he won the
tournament with a three-round
total of 208 (67-69-72). Stanford
placed 14th as a team.
As for Pasatiempo, "Darren
Dragovich looks as if he's about
ready to break through. Jerry
Chang had a terrible tourna
ment last week. We just have to
get him straightened out,"
Goodwin said.
There will be six team mem
bers traveling, and the top four
scores will count towards the
team score each round.
There will be three rounds
played, with two taking place
on Tuesday and one on Wednes
day.
Stanford will need to perform
well to be among the top 11
teams in the region by next
month, which would qualify the
squad for the NCAA West
Regionals.
