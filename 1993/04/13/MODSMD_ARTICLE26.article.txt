# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The Athletes of the Week both got a taste
of individual glory in their respective sports
last week. Stanford pitcher Willie Adams
chalked up not one, but two shutouts in a
row, and golfer Martha Richards rose to the
top of a 142-player field to garner first-place
honors at the Ping/Arizona State Women's
Invitational.

Adams hurled his first career shutout on
April 2 in the Cardinal's 4-0 win over Cali
fornia. The 6-foot-7 junior from La Mirada,
Calif., overcame a bases-loaded situation in
the second inning and never looked back.
Not a single Cal player advanced past sec
ond base in the next seven innings, and
Adams allowed a paltry five hits in his fourth
complete game of the season.
He followed this performance with an
equally-impressive effort last Thursday
against USC. Again allowing only five hits, he
racked up his second consecutive complete
game shutout against the leading team in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.
According to coach Mark Marquess, this
was the first time a Stanford pitcher had
thrown back-to-back shutouts in league
play. Adams improved his record to 7-1 for
the year, and lowered his ERA to 3.23.

On April 4, Richards shot a one-under-par 71
on the difficult Karsten Golf Course in Tempe,
Ariz., to clinch the Ping/ASU Women's Invita
tional title.
Her consistent play in the first two rounds (73
and 74), and two birdies in the last six holes of
the tournament fueled her one-stroke victory
over USC's Jill McGill.
Richards has showed steady improvement
throughout the season, and now appears to be
coming into her own. The 5-foot-11 former bas

ketball player uses her height and strength to hit
the ball farther than anyone else on the team,
but showed last week that she can also hit the
trickier short shots.
Prior to this win, the senior captain's highest
finish of the '92-93 season was a fifth-place show
ing at the Stanford Intercollegiate in October.
