Stanford Business School graduates may
start out on roughly equal footing, but two
recent studies show that men soon outdis
tance women in salary and promotions.
And once the MBA recipients marry, the
pay gap widens to a chasm, according to a
report compiled by Business School Prof.
Thomas Harrell.
"It is women who have babies and women
who do more housework," Harrell said. But he
added that accounting for lifestyle choices
does not explain the differences in the survey
of 855 graduates; the results strongly suggest
discrimination is very real.
Harrell's study found that women who
graduated between 1973 and 1985 not only
earned less, but were less satisfied with their
jobs, progressed more slowly in their careers
and showed more emotional strain.
Single women earned an average of
$106,146 in 1987, 14 percent less than men
working the same number of hours. Married
women lost even more ground, making
$101,124 — 30 percent less than married
men's $144,461.
"There is a more even playing field when

marriage is not involved," Harrell said,
explaining that married women usually con
tribute more to housework and may act as a
"hostess" for their husbands.
Career choice also affects salaries, he
added. For example, there are few women
working in high-level positions on Wall Street,
and more women start their own business
than head large companies, Harrell said.
Jobs in the higher-income occupations —
investment banking, consulting and corporate
finance — are often "guarded more zealously"
by men, explained School of Education Prof.
Myra Strober.
"The kinds of hoops men and women have
to jump through are oriented toward men who
have a wife to attend to the other parts of
their lives," she said.
One of Strober's students, Deborah Kazal-
Thresher, analyzed Harrell's data for her dis
sertation.
She found that "even when differences in
work hours, experience, job responsibilities,
occupations or industries, unemployment and
part-time work are accounted for, women
MBAs in this sample still earn about 11 per
cent less than men MBAs," according to the
report.
That 11 percent could include both dis
crimination and the effects of marriage, Har
rell said.
A second survey conducted last summer by
Kaufman Associates of Menlo Park also found
pay discrepancies. The median income for full

time employees from the Class of '82 was
$142,500 for men, compared to $104,200 for
women.
"It just was really shocking to me," said
Julie Kaufman, whose market-research firm
directed the study. "In this survey, there's no
reason the women should be earning less. I
think discrimination has to play a large role."
While she believes bias is the dominant fac
tor, Kaufman added that a contributing factor
could be that "the men are just pushing hard
er for salaries and titles."
Lynn Pierone, a 1982 MBA graduate and a
manager at Apple Computer, said it is also
possible that women may choose not to com
pete because "the time isn't right family
wise."
Her classmates now average about two chil
dren each, Pierone said, but the added respon
sibility doesn't explain everything — there are
"women making a quarter of a million with
two children."
"The real question is why women aren't
keeping pace hierarchically," she said, citing
statistics that show men are, on the average,
two levels higher in companies. Women are
more likely to be managers while men are
often directors or vice presidents, Pierone
said.
"The glass ceiling effect has very negative
consequences for young women," Strober said,
since looking at differences in pay and promo
tions tends to dampen the aspirations of col
lege women aiming for a business career.
