# Philosophy CIV final will count
## Cheating investigation continues 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Winter-quarter final exams for
students in Philosophy 58, a Cul
tures, Ideas and Values course,
will count despite numerous alle
gations of cheating on the test.
Investigations into alleged
cheating in that class and Geo
physics 4 "Natural Hazards and
Man" have not yielded any con
crete results, Judicial Affairs Offi
cer Sally Cole said yesterday.
In both courses, cheating was
discovered after several students
anonymously reported to profes
sors that class members who took
the exam early distributed infor
mation about the test.
Students in Geophysics 4 were
offered three options: taking a
"pass" grade for the class, accept
ing their midterm grade or taking

another final examination. Until
yesterday's announcement, grades
for students in the CIV track had
been withheld.
"I determined that continuing
to withhold the grades wouldn't
serve any purpose," explained
Philosophy Prof. John Perry.
"There's a lot of reasons not to
have another final. It's very unfair
to students who did not cheat. We
don't have evidence of widespread
cheating."
Ronald Glass, a lecturer in the
philosophy class, said he believed
using the final grades was the best
option among a selection of bad
choices.
"We felt at his point we don't
have enough information to war
rant giving another exam," Glass
said. "I feel some people definitely
cheated and, as of now, they are
getting away with it.
"The best way to handle the
situation would be for the people
who had cheated to realize they
had done wrong and own up to
that so people who took the
exam fair and square wouldn't
be penalized," he said. "But that
won't happen."
Freshman Timothy Lang, a
student in the class, said he also
believed there was no good solu
tion.
"Personally I know it's not
some rampant thing," Lang said.
"If there are people cheating, I
think that's outrageous. But
there is no one right thing you
can do about it."
Although the students in
both classes will receive grades,
Cole said in a statement yester
day that both she and the
instructors "are continuing to
lean on these students with all

the moral pressure we can
exert" to name those who violat
ed the Honor Code.
Cole also pointed out that the
investigation has raised broader
questions about the role of the
Honor Code.
"We have at least raised
awareness about the Honor Code
and spent time discussing issues
of fairness and honesty that tend
not to get attention in the usual
course of events," she said.
"Many students understand
their privileges and responsibili
ties in the academic arena better
than previously," Cole said. "An
unknown number of dishonest
students have experienced sever
al weeks of anxiety and many
faculty are rethinking their
views about early examina
tions."
She added that two adminis
trative committees, the Student
Conduct Legislative Committee
and the Faculty Senate Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement, are also examining
the impact of allowing early
exams.
