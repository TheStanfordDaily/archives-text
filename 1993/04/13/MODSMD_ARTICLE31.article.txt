# Panel tackles press, politics interaction
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
When Time magazine's man
aging editor interviewed Presi
dent Clinton for the 1992 "Man
of the Year" issue, the seasoned
journalist said he unwittingly
underwent a subtle manipula
tion that exemplifies govern
ment's growing control of the
press.
As Henry Muller and a co
worker waited to begin the inter
view, White House communica
tions director George Steph
anopolous told them Hillary
Clinton would join them about
halfway through.
But he asked them not to take
pictures — an "implicit message"
that the White House wanted to
keep the first lady's profile low in
the early days of the administra
tion, Muller told an audience of
about 50 at a "Politics and the
Press" panel sponsored by The
Daily yesterday.
Muller agreed, and continued
with the interview. But the next
Monday, before the issue hit
newsstands, Newsweek show
cased Hillary on its cover.
Muller said he realized the
administration had wanted to
protect its exclusive arrange
ment with Newsweek but not to
exclude Hillary from the Time
article.
"I had a slightly bad taste in
my mouth because we'd been
used a little bit. These folks are
pretty good at figuring out what
the media needs and exercising
control over what the media can
do," said Muller, now the editori
al director of Time Inc.
"In the last decade and a half
we've seen a quantum leap in the
government's ability to shape
what appears in the press" — a
trend that he said has not been
significantly discussed.
Panelist Eric Alterman, how
ever, said he was bothered by
the press' effect on politics, not
politicos' effect on the press.
Alterman, the author of "Sound
and Fury: the Washington Pun

ditocracy and the Collapse of
American Politics," decried the
influence of the Washington's
elite press corps. Composed of
no more than two dozen people
at any one time, he said, the
group sets "the tone for the elite
public discussion of issues in
this country."
For these pundits, caught up
in the power whirl of the Belt
way, often "their sources become
more important to them than the
readers."
However, for some readers,
the "media" not only include the
Washington elite but also talk
show hosts such as Larry King
and Phil Donahue, said Alter
man, a doctoral student at Stan
ford.
Indeed, King and Donahue
played an increasingly large role
last fall. Bypassing the tradition
al national media became the
norm in the 1992 campaign, said
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody. But the talk show hosts
aren't good interviewers, he said,
adding, "We're ill-served by them
giving a forum to presidential
candidates."
Still, Philip Taubman, deputy
national editor of the New York
Times, praised the press for its
relative success in covering the
1992 race. "We ended up with a
campaign that didn't get as dis
tracted by peripheral issues," he
said. "That's a debt we owe Ross
Perot, whether one likes his poli
tics or not."
But political columnist Linda
Witt noted that in the so-called
"Year of the Woman," female
politicians were "terrified of the
press" because of the way in
which reporters treated them.
For example, she noted that
during Illinois Sen. Carol Mose
ley Braun's candidacy, an article
profiling her and her opponent
began with a description of her
as a "den mother with a cheerful
smile." Not until the 20th para
graph did the article mention her
credentials as a lawyer, a federal
prosecutor and a veteran of the
state senate, Witt added.
