# Voting made easy
## ASSU relaxes write-in regulations; COP slates to debate issues tonight 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Voters may not be required to
write in the names of all four
members of Council of Presidents
hopeful A Blank Slate in this
week's election, a turn of events
that considerably bolsters that
slate's hopes for victory.
And as the race for the COP
heated up yesterday, members of
Blank Slate and its opponent, A
Clean Slate, agreed to a public de
bate in the Donner Lounge at 6
p.m. tonight, Clean Slate member
Jason Snyder said. He added that
a moderator has not been selected
yet.
Election commissioner Tom
Tsao had said last week that, in
keeping with past precedent, vot
ers would have to write in both the
slate name and the names of all
four slate members for unofficial
COP candidates.
Blank Slate, which has
promised to dissolve the COP if
elected, made its candidacy public
last Thursday, well after last
month's deadline to file for official

placement on the ballot.
"I don't want the rules turned
against me," Tsao said yesterday
afternoon. "I want to stay by the
book, and be as precise as possi
ble."
However, after Blank Slate ap
pealed to Tsao yesterday evening
claiming the rule against write
ins was unfair, Tsao overturned
his decision.
Hearings Officer Greg
Gilchrist said that after consult
ing the ASSU Constitution, he
and Tsao agreed to throw out the
member write-in requirement if
the Blank Slate can produce a dec
laration of intent to run before the
election begins tomorrow.
"The final decision was made
by both of us," he said. "Both of us
felt the bylaws were fairly clear."
The ASSU Bylaws state that
"all votes for write-in slates that
have not declared their slate
names in a Declaration of Intent
before the opening of the polls
must contain the names of the in
dividual members of that slate to
be attributed to that slate."
If the decision holds up, voters
will have to write in only the
name of the slate itself — and not
all four members — for their bal
lots to count. Blank Slate member
Eddie Lintz said the slate has
drafted a declaration of intent
and will file it with the ASSU
today.
Tsao could not be reached for
comment last night.
The rule change removes an
obstacle in Blank Slate's path

that slate members felt would
hurt their chances of victory. As
both slates campaigned in cam
pus residences last night, the
race's outcome seemed less clear,
lending added importance to the
debate tonight.
"I've given up on trying to call
[the opinion of] the electorate at
this point," Clean Slate member
Ron Brown said. He said Clean
Slate "will campaign at the same
schedule," despite the ruling.
Lintz, who earlier said the
ASSU was "stalling and obfuscat
ing" by imposing the write-in reg
ulations, said his slate is "really
happy" with the reversal. "People
who know about the Blank Slate

will be able to vote without this
prohibitive measure hanging over
their heads," he said. "The elec
tion will be more accessible to stu
dents."
Ying-Ying Goh, a member of
the Clean Slate, agreed that the
decision will "make it easier for
voters to vote for [Blank Slate], It
is a lot to ask of voters to put
down all four names of the slate
members."
Goh said Clean Slate will focus
in tonight's debate on its "obvi
ous strength — that students
have nothing to lose."
"Students have something to
gain from a COP," she said. "We
intend to prove that."
