## Health-care reform needed in regulations, insurance

President Clinton came to Stanford last
night â€” sort of.
Donning the president's persona as
moderator of a panel discussion on health
care reform, Harvard Law School Prof.
Charles Ogletree challenged experts to
form a "master plan" to reform America's
health care system.
The panel included Business School
Prof. Alan Enthoven, founder of the con
cept of managed competition in health
care; former University President Donald
Kennedy; Rep. Anna Eshoo and California
Insurance Commissioner John Garamen
di.
Panelists agreed on the need to create a
high-quality, universal health-care sys
tem with contained costs and access for
everyone. They failed, however, to agree
on several of the details of how the system
will work.
Enthoven called for "an industrial
revolution in health care, a whole differ
ent way of going about it." He outlined
his managed competition program, in
which the financing and delivery of
health care would be managed by effi
cient, organized units of doctors and hos
pitals competing with one another to at
tract consumers.
According to Enthoven, the overall
goal of the plan is to provide comprehen
sive medical coverage while controlling

health care costs.
Most of the health-care experts agreed
that Enthoven's plan can serve as a useful
starting point for health-care reforms.
Creating such efficient organizations to
streamline health care purchasing will
control costs and, according to Garamen
di, increase the quality of care.
Several of the panelists claimed that in
surance companies are inefficient and har
bor excess in the system, and said that
these companies should not continue con
trolling the cost and distribution of Amer
ican health care.
The experts also agreed that the "fee for
services" system currently employed by
many physicians provides an incentive for
them to perform unnecessary treatments.
Changing incentives in the health care
system should be a element of re
form.
While the panelists agreed on many of
the broad aims of health care reform, how
ever, they tended to find "the devil in the
details," disagreeing on the pace of change
and specific strategies for implementa
tion.
Kennedy said the current push for re
form in Washington appears to some to be
like "a high-school Model U.N. on
steroids." He added that it is important
that the American people feel as if a coher
ent plan is being considered, but warned
against making too many changes too
quickly.
