# Promoting in-depth investigations
## Watergate's Woodward says media obsessed with quick stories 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Bob Woodward, one of the two re
porters who uncovered the Watergate
scandal, criticized the news media for
being obsessed with "the latest up
date" instead of in-depth investiga
tions during a speech yesterday.
Woodward's speech closed a sympo
sium celebrating the 20th anniversary
of The Stanford Daily's independence
from the University. He is now assis
tant managing editor for investiga
tions at the Washington Post.
The journalist told an audience of
about 400 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
that the biggest problems plaguing
the news media are an addiction to
video images, too much concern for
their reputation and a failure to re
port stories thoroughly because it's
too time-consuming.
"The biggest enemies to the media
are working from within. They are
speed, simplicity and brevity," he said.
"It's so much easier to treat the
Woody Allen-Mia Farrow story than
to treat the underlying story of child
abuse."
Similarly, he criticized the media
for trying to predict the effects of the
verdict in the trial of the police officers
accused of beating Rodney King. In
stead, he argued, the media should ask
a more important question: Is there

justice in the U.S. legal system?
Woodward argued that the media
should focus more on long-term, in
depth investigative reporting that al
lows for the more complete treatment
of important issues.
"The common characteristic of
good reporting is that it takes time. It
has to take the point of view of under
standing — not be done on the run,"
he said.
Among the issues he said will re
quire such attention in the future will
be the deterioration of American busi
ness, the war on drugs and the perma
nent American underclass.
Although readers may not like to
read long in-depth articles, it is the
media's obligation to do them anyway,
he added.
To illustrate the need of reporters
need to look beyond the surface to
learn what is really happening, Wood
ward told a childhood story about his
father's law firm in Wheaton, 111. He
said that while doing janitorial work
he found papers in the attic labeled
"disposed files." The files contained
information about crime, fraud and
decadence in his hometown, which
had the appearance of Norman Rock
well-like suburbia.
"A journalist must always keep his
or her eyes fixated on the 'disposed

The common character
istic of good reporting is
that it takes time. It has
to take the point of view
of understanding — not
be done on the run'
