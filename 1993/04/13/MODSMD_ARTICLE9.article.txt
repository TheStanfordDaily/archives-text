# Zeta Psi, Betas hope to gain new members during Rush
##

The clapping is done, the tents
put away. ... Now the boys have
come out to play.
But playing is not all the fra
ternities have done in preparation
for this year's Rush activities.
This spring, two fraternities in
particular have put extra time
and effort into the two weeks of
Rush.
Zeta Psi, an unhoused frater
nity whose house was revoked
five years ago due to disciplinary
problems, is back after successful
informal rushing in the fall and
winter.
There are currently 16 mem
bers of Zeta Psi, and Rush chair
man Brad Chinn said he hopes to
increase that number to at least

30.
"We'd love to have more if we
have terrific prospects," he said.
Zeta Psi, which was estab
lished in 1892, is Stanford's old
est fraternity.
"This is the main reason for
wanting to re-establish ourselves
on campus. We have such a rich
history," Chinn said.
The Betas are hoping for a suc
cessful Rush this year to help
their campaign to regain a house
in a few years.
They lost their national char
ter in 1990 after a series of dis
agreements with their national
organization, Beta Theta Pi. They
then lost their house last summer
after a sharp decline in member
ship.
"Our main objective [this year]
is not to gain our house back, but

to get one strong pledge class
which will carry on the traditions
and have an equally incredible
Rush next year," said Kurt Hur
tado, Rush chairman of the Betas.
There are currently 10 Beta
members. To regain their house,
they need to have a total of 34
members.
"My personal goal for this year
is to get around 12-15 members.
This will not get our house back
this year. But next year, when the
Betas are twice as strong, we can
gain the house then," Hurtado
said.
If the fraternity does obtain
the enough pledges, they will
regain their old house — simply
known now as 557 Mayfield. The
house is presently a University
operated, coed, upperclass resi
dence.
