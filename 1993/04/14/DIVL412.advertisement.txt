Who We Are...
The JNM Forbesons Group is working to be a developed company in a developing country.
We're India's leading manufacturer of steam engineering and process controls, with 700 employees,
offices in every major Indian city, as well as agents in 9 countries overseas. We make everything from
boilers and valves, to funky things like Vortex Flow instruments and PCX telemetry systems.
And we're growing. This year, we're trying to achieve what we call 2X. That means reaching double
the sales turnover. Double the profits. Double the efficiency. Half the response time. Half the defects.
Double the pay. We're also best-known in Indian Industry for our progressive work environment and
active recruiting of women and the physically challenged.
Who We're Looking For...
We're currently looking for Stanford folk to come work in India for anywhere between three months to
a year or more, depending on how you like it here. We'll take Seniors, as well as Juniors willing to
stop outfall quarter next year. We're interested in hiring majors in Electrical Engineering, Industrial
Engineering, Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Product Design to
work on special fast-track R&D projects in a small entrepeneurial-style development team. We're also
looking to hire someone majoring in International Relations or related fields to help build our
International Operations sales and marketing.
What You Get...
We'll give you more freedom and responsibility than any U.S. company in their right mind can offer
you right out of college.
You'll see India. If you're in international operations, you'll probably also see a little of Kenya, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore,
Malaysia and/or Hong Kong.
We'll provide you with an apartment, medical coverage while you're in India, as well as give you extra
money for beer or whatever else floats your boat.
If you're interested, you should mail or fax your resume to us, pronto.
We'll set up a campus interview for spring quarter.
