# The
						end of party politics?
## No divisive issues, no Students First 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students First has gone the
way of the Whigs, the Populists
and the Free Soil party.
The party — which used to face
off against People's Platform in
the ASSU Senate and COP races
— appears to be the latest victim
of the apathy plaguing Stanford's
student government.
This year, People's Platform
has 11 of the 30 candidates on the
ballot for senate seats, while Stu
dents First has no senate candi
dates and is not running a slate
for the Council of Presidents.
Since its formation about four
years ago and until this year, Stu
dents First ran a COP slate and
several senate candidates in each
election. In Spring 1991, the Stu
dents First-backed slate sailed
into the office of the COP.
But the prominence of Stu
dents First is over. "I'm not even
sure who's in charge of the party
this year," said Doug Bone, who
was a Students First senator last
year.
"I really don't know why no
body's doing anything this year —
It doesn't look like there was a lot
of coordination," he added.
