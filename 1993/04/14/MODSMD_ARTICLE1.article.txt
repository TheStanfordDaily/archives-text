# The 						end of party politics?
## No divisive issues, no Students First 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students First has gone the
way of the Whigs, the Populists
and the Free Soil party.
The party — which used to face
off against People's Platform in
the ASSU Senate and COP races
— appears to be the latest victim
of the apathy plaguing Stanford's
student government.
This year, People's Platform
has 11 of the 30 candidates on the
ballot for senate seats, while Stu
dents First has no senate candi
dates and is not running a slate
for the Council of Presidents.
Since its formation about four
years ago and until this year, Stu
dents First ran a COP slate and
several senate candidates in each
election. In Spring 1991, the Stu
dents First-backed slate sailed
into the office of the COP.
But the prominence of Stu
dents First is over. "I'm not even
sure who's in charge of the party
this year," said Doug Bone, who
was a Students First senator last
year.
"I really don't know why no
body's doing anything this year —
It doesn't look like there was a lot
of coordination," he added.
The swift retreat of the party
from ASSU politics appears to be
a direct result of a moderation of
attitudes in the senate.
"Now, the senate has only one
party with one platform," added
undergraduate senator Mork
Murdock. "There is really no
need for Students First."
With student opinion shifting
against the ASSU — evidenced
by the election of the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate last
year — the parties seem to have
reconciled their differences in
order to produce a joint effort to
save the ASSU.
People's Platform has tradi
tionally focused heavily on multi
cultural issues and improved stu
dent services, while Students
First adopted a more laissez-faire
approach to student government.
"Three years ago, there was a
lot of party politicking in.the sen
ate," said graduate senator
Derek Miyahara. "This year, it
didn't happen much at all. The
moderates won out.
"Senators realized that Peo
ple's Platform and Students
First really aren't that differ
ent," he said.
"In the past, people got tired
of the petty politics in the senate
that sometimes overshadowed
the good things that the ASSU
could do," said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson.
A decrease in participation in
the ASSU may be both a cause
and a result of the fall of party
politics. With only one COP slate
and 30 senate candidates on the
ballot this week, the disappear
ance of Students First appears to
be the latest in a string of events
demonstrating student apathy

toward the ASSU.
"The major reason for there
not being a lot of candidates [for
senate this year] is that Students
First isn't there," said Murdock.
Without an opposition party, stu
dents with more extreme views
are not so quick to run for senate
seats, he said.
Previously, Students First
existed in reaction to the ideas of
People's Platform, said under
graduate senator Cecilia Tom,
who was also affiliated with Stu
dents First. "My guess is that
there is nothing left to react
against — no divisive issues came
up this year."
"The ASSU has become less
and less important," said Bone.
"Political parties in general have
declined."
Another problem with the
party seems to have been its
organization. Without a firm
structure, it fell apart quickly
when politics in the senate died
down.
"Students First was never
really that organized," explained
Bone. "It was never a very tight
ly controlled thing — in other
years it just came together. ... I
guess this year it didn't."
"There's no organization
now," Tom added. "Many of the
people who used to lead the party
have gone overseas."
In addition to the missing Stu
dents First COP slate, the Stan
ford Chaparral has has broken
with tradition and failed to spon
sor a COP slate.
"We didn't get enough people
together" to organize a slate, said
Adrian Klein, who works for the
humor publication.
However, one member of the
Chapparal, Jeremy Nelson, is
running as a candidate on a write
in COP slate. "We feel the Blank
Slate is uniquely qualified," Klein
said.
