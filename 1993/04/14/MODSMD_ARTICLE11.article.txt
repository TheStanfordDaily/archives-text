# Coiffing and cutting a campus of clients
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
In the 1950'5, students went to
Old Union to pay their bills, pick
up their financial aid checks —
and get their hair cut.
Now, Carmelo Cogliandro and
Newell Whitford's family-owned
business is located in Tresidder
Union, where they cut hair for
Stanford students, faculty and
neighbors at "Stanford
Hairstyling."
The business actually began as
two barbershops — one in Encina
Hall run by Cogliandro's father
and the other in Old Union run by
Whitford's uncle. Both catered to
men only in a "more defined,
more traditional 'barbershop' "
style, explained Cogliandro.
The two barbershops com
bined in 1961, and the pair
opened up shop in Tresidder the
next year.
Cogliandro said the shop
excites him because of "the vitali
ty of the people who are here,
always changing faces and new
things."
"The interest is in the people.
The people make the business,"
he said.
Cogliandro has certainly
coiffed the 'dos of some of Stan
ford's most notable. "I've done
(former University Presidents)
Wallace Sterling, Richard Lyman,
Don Kennedy, (University Presi
dent) Gerhard Casper plus Nobel
and Pulitzer Prize winners," he
said. "And, of course, the core of
our business is students."
"I just cut Kennedy and he's
always interesting," he said,

adding that he also enjoys talking
to head football coach Bill Walsh
while trimming his hair.
Cogliando quickly pointed out
that the shop has changed over
the years. Rather than only cater
ing to men with traditional short
hair cuts, the shop now has sever
al stylists who cut all types of hair
for both men and women, and
provide services including color
ing, perming and relaxing, he
explained.
The shop also does what
Cogliando called "design work,"
which includes shaving letters,
initials and numbers into client's
hair.
"The design cuts are always
interesting," laughed Cogliando.
"As long as they can diagram it, I
can generally cut it."
On the wall is one framed
photo of someone inscribing the
Delta Kappa Epsilon initials onto
one student's head.
"A few years ago I did a Deke
rush party. I was going to be a
sidelight, but it turned out they
wanted all sorts of design cuts,"
he said. "It was very entertain
ing.
"I've involved myself a lot in
student events," Cogliando
added, pointing out that last year
he cut hair on stage during a
Christmas show. "We're always
involved in charities that affect
campus."
Aiid the shop follows the cam
pus schedule: busier while the
students are around and less hec
tic during vacations, he said.
Before dances such as the
Viennese Ball business booms,
explained Cogliando. "A lot of the

women like to have their hair
rolled or braided. We really try to
cover all the bases."
But perhaps the busiest time is
the month before Commence
ment, he added. "Between job
interviews and graduation and
seeing their parents, there's no
question students become more
attentive to their appearance."
But the shop, despite its mod

ern hair technology, retains a
sense of Stanford history. Inter
spersed with posters advertising
hair care products and styles are
photos of Stanford's past, from
construction to fires and bicycles.
Cogliando pointed out that the
shop has seen a lot of Stanford's
tumultuous history. "We've real
ly been through a lot," he added,
including labor strikes on cam

pus, earthquakes and the time
the shop flooded out a few years
ago.
Like the shop itself, its clients
are a mix of old and new.
Ted Costello, a Palo Alto resi
dent, said he has been coming to
the shop so long that Cogliando's
father originally cut his hair.
"Got out of Stanford in '48 and in
'50 I moved out of the area. Came

back in '55. I come here because
all these years they've done a
wonderful job."
In contrast to Costello's long
history with the Cogliando busi
ness, prospective freshman Laura
Van Winkle said she "just saw the
shop and stopped in." Since she
didn't need an appointment, she
decided to have her hair cut on
the spur of the moment.
