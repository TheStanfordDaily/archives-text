Israel fires on Lebanon
MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) â€”
Israeli helicopters and artillery shelled
seven villages in southern Lebanon after a
roadside bomb killed three Israeli soldiers
and seriously wounded two.
Security sources said five Lebanese
were wounded in the attacks on a cluster
of villages near the Israeli buffer zone
inside Lebanon's southern border. Israel
occupied the 440-square-mile zone in
1985 to protect its northern region from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
The latest spasm of bloodshed came a
week before the Clinton administration
hopes to resume Middle East peace talks
in Washington.
Hezbollah's guerilla wing claimed
responsibility for the ambush of the

Israeli patrol. As the standard-bearer of
Shiite Muslim fundamentalismO, Hezbol
lah opposes the peace talks.
March sales plummet
WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans
sharply curtailed retail spending in
March as they dug out from the Blizzard
of '93 and an avalanche of credit card
debt from a holiday shopping spree.
Sales plunged 1 percent to a seasonal
ly adjusted $166.9 billion, the Com
merce Department said yesterday. It
was the worst drop since January 1991,
during the depths of the recession.
The Clinton administration seized on
the report as evidence its $16 billion
jobs bill is needed to keep the recovery
alive.
