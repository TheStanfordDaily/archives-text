SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Hundreds of women and chil
dren, including dozens of wounded,
jammed trucks yesterday to flee the mis
ery of Srebrenica, where Serb shelling
killed at least 56 people Monday.
Of the 650 people who arrived in gov
ernment-held Tuzla hours later, 47 were
hospitalized with various wounds, offi
cials of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees reported.
Robert Johansson, who drove one of
the trucks, said the convoy was stoned
by bystanders when it passed Serb-held
Zvornik. The refugees were protected by
tarpaulin covering on the trucks, he
said.
Sarajevo radio reported late yester
day that the eastern and northern front
lines in the Srebrenica area were being
heavily shelled with mortars and multi
ple rocket launchers.
Those who perished Monday in

Srebrenica, a Muslim enclave, includ
ed 15 children. At least 90 people were
injured, 73 seriously, in the bombard
ment that coincided with the first
patrols by NATO warplanes of the
U.N.-imposed no-fly zone over Bosnia.
U.N. officials in Zagreb, Croatia, said
they believed the eventual death toll
would be much higher because of a lack
of medical supplies.
Srebrenica, packed with tens of thou
sands of refugees, is one of only three
areas held by the Muslim-led Bosnian
government in eastern Bosnia.
"Apparently in the pathological drive
to acquire territory, the Serbs are will
ing to kill anybody to achieve their
ends," U.N. High Commissioner for
•Refugees spokesman John McMillan
said.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic said Monday's attacks were a
response to Muslim violations of an

often-ignored cease-fire that took effect
across Bosnia two weeks ago.
In other developments:
• U.S. and Russian envoys contin
ued efforts to persuade Bosnia's Serbs
to sign a U.N. peace plan, which would
deny them land links to Serbia proper
and to Serb-held parts of Croatia for
which they have fought for a year.
• Reginald Bartholomew, President
Clinton's special envoy, met Croat offi
cials in Split and Zagreb. He was expect
ed in Belgrade today.
• The Sarajevo aid airlift, suspended
Saturday after Serbs moved anti-air
craft weapons near the capital's airport,
will resume tomorrow, McMillan said.
NATO warplanes, meanwhile,
patrolled over Bosnia for a second day in
the alliance's first military operation
outside its boundaries since it was set up
in 1949. Allied pilots were under orders
to shoot only as a last resort.
