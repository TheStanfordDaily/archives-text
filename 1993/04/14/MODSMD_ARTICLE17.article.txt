## ENDORSEMENTS COP: A Clean Slate 
### 
A VOTE FOR THE COUNCIL
of Presidents slate "A Clean
Slate: Salaries Not Included"
is the best means available to save the
beleaguered position and revive stu
dents' faith in student government.
The "Clean Slate" candidates —
Ron Brown, Ying-Ying Goh, Delia
Lopez and Jason Snyder — realize
the necessity of demonstrating to

both students and administration
the importance of the COFJ and are
prepared to do so without pay.
"A Clean Slate" is clearly a bet
ter choice than their only opposi
tion — the write-in candidates "A
Blank Slate" — because with its
election the Stanford community
will receive four people lobbying
for students' interests at no cost.
