## Founding factions from foci 
### 
TODAY'S THE DAY. ASSU elec
tions snuck up on us quicker and
quieter than a Poli Sci midterm.
Before I knew it, there were 13 people at
my house meeting endorsing stuff. I
found myself cheering for all the candi
dates and their ESPN dorm ideas and
Taco Bell Tresidder things. And I was
convinced all the fee requests represent
ed righteous causes.
Then something struck me. Why is it
that the only time I hear from these
groups, and all the great things they're
doing, is election time?
Soon after, I read how we're getting
three new theme houses. And some
bers of the Jewish community want a
theme house, too. Before you know it,
we're gonna have more foci than an army
of hyperbolas.
I think all this stuff is connected. All
these campus groups, all these theme
houses, suffer from the same disease —
fractionalization.
Don't get me wrong. I think these
houses and groups are an indispensable
means to celebrate and educate others
about a culture or idea. If I were Latino
and I wanted to learn more about my cul
ture, then I can't think of a better way to
do that than by living in Zapata or getting
involved in MEChA. Or if I were interest
ed in community service, then it would
probably be a good idea to join Alpha Phi
Omega or live in Lantana.

But I think there's a difference
between celebrating a culture or idea and
isolating it.
The stated mission of Res Ed is one of
multiculturalism. In theory that means
sticking a bunch of people with different
ideas and backgrounds together so they
can learn from one another. A great idea.
But if all the ecologists are in Robinson,
then who is going to enlighten me on my
sinful aerosol-using ways? In that man
ner, focus houses defeat Res Ed's efforts
to have a healthy mix of ideas.
And another thing, who says what the
right themes on which to base houses
are? Who Jfrat,, "eywirpjnroepW
issues" of "world affairs" are the correct
things to focus on? I'll bet there are a lot
of themes being ignored. How about
turning Cedro into the fondue theme
house. Or Eucalypto into the Ethel Mer
man theme house.
Soon we won't be choosing just a place
to live, but a focus to concentrate on.
Before long, Res Ed is going to attach a
theme to every upperclass dorm. Can't
we live in a place where we're free to fol
low any number of themes? We'll have
one dorm on campus that will be super
aware of one issue, but they will not be
similarly exposed to other ideas of merit.
And I think that's the problem with
many groups on campus. Groups such as
AASA, or ethnic fraternities or sororities,
instead of just serving as sources of cele-

bration and dynamic education, also wind
up isolating themselves. Why don't they
try and teach the rest of us about their
ideas so that maybe we can begin to
understand their problems and solu
tions? Maybe we can help. Or maybe not.
But shouldn't we try?
Sure, there are a lot of Asian-Ameri
cans who most likely feel much more
comfortable when immersed in their own
culture. But don't you come to a place
like Stanford to experience other cul
tures? To try on new ideas?
The way I see it, we should just have a
bunch of regular, old themeless houses.
Then we will have people of all different
interests mixed together to teach and to
learn from one another. And as for all
these groups, of course they should exist,
but as a tool of celebration and education
rather than isolation. They should be
reaching out and making an active effort
to educate others.
All I'm saying is college should be a
place to experience new things, to broad
en your horizons. And that's not going to
happen by just sticking with people of the
same interests. Take a chance.

in Bill Walsh for ASSU Senate.
