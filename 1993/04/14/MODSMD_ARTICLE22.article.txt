## No one at Stanford has problems? Yeah right 
### 
IT'S NOT MY TURN TO DIE YET.
Lately I've been in a pretty morbid
mood. It's been one of those Sprock
ets, dress-all-in-biack weeks. It is in
weeks such as these when I wonder if I
have any friends. When I wonder if I will
ever do laundry. When I wonder if I will
suddenly get hit by varicose veins.
No, it is not a Midol moment.
How can the sky still be blue? How can
small children still smile? How can large
groups of attractive men with nice facial
structures participate in Rush, all when I
am in such a sour mood?
Maybe I'll get run over by the Mar
guerite.
It is such an impotent week, that after
trekking all the way over to the Sigma Nu
party on Saturday, and trekking all the
way back incredibly soon after — even
though it was packed with tall, virile men
— I did a strange thing; I sat down to
read my high-school yearbook.
Yes, me and my pathetic self sat down
to read the comments of all my pseudo
friends from Dick Nixon High. All the
"get a tan," "keep in touch," and"I lust

ed after you for four years, but it just
never worked out" comments one tynical
little columnist could take.
They will all, I repeat all, be working
at Puffy Taco when the fifth-year
reunion rolls around.
But as I pointed to all the guys in tank
tops with the arm holes cut down to their
waists to expose their meager little
chests, and the girls with denim shorts
cut up to their waists to expose their
meager little butts, I had to smile.
These fine examples of adolescence
were true friends. People who'd wait for
me at the Wall before going into the Cafe
teria. People who'd target Sadie
Hawkins' dates for me. People who would
tell me if I had large waterfowl stuck in
my teeth — the mark of a five-star friend.
I am not a total failure.
But I'm hitting bottom, I tell you. And
I don't know why. My Prozac prescrip
tion is fully stocked. My Morissey and
Suicidal Tendencies tapes have been con
fiscated by my neighbors. There hasn't
been a god-damned cloud in the sky for
quite a while. Plus, I'm still wearing

makeup, a remarkable two-and-a-half
weeks into the quarter.
No, I still don't have a boyfriend, but
that's not it either.
One problem with being a high-pow
ered, over-achieving Stanford student,
selling your soul for some vague "experi
ence" thing in exchange for a few spare
seconds to sit down and light your dorm
room on fire with a candle, is that life
begins to lose its perspective.
I do nothing with my life. Nothing. I
have no friends. I do nothing. And I am
unhappy. Yet I am constantly doing
things, spending time with people and
telling an inappropriate joke here and
there belying this inner-sadness thing.
I've fallen, and I can't get up.
But as my friends remind me they are
my friends, my schedule reminds me that
I do lots of things, and my mom reminds
me to go to class, I realize it's all self pity.
You have a problem with self pity?
I have nothing to be sad about. I have
messages on my answering machine and
in my email account. My face isn't break
ing out. My clothes all fit. My hair days

are fair-to-middling, but it doesn't seem
to phase me. All the usual trauma factors
are stable.
It's a beautiful day in my neighbor
hood.
But then why do I go from carefree
moments of toothbrush swordfighting
and narcoleptic-puppy imitations —
accompanied by bladder-jeopardizing
laughter — to wallow sessions sitting out
on Wilbur field at night wondering if the
things I do have any real purpose.
Will I ever be a model or just look like
one? Will I ever have fun, fun, fun on a
Caribbean Cruise? Will I ever meet a
well-adjusted, yet somewhat socially
unacceptable male with whom I can
spend meaningless quality hours swap
ping lines from Monty Python movies?
I never wanted to work in a pet store
in the first place.
And then a friend, in a frenzied attempt
to cheer me up, asks me what, if I actually
got hit by some cumbersome transit vehi
cle, he could bring to the funeral.
A veritable ray of sunshine, he is.
But I have to think. My funeral.

Who/what would be there? My parents.
My past loves. The rugrata down the
street who used to try to run away from
home whenever I babysat. My friends, i
Or at least the ones who look good ;in
black.
Unfortunately, I'm not ready to give i}p.
I have much more tormenting of my
fellow human beings to do. I will, with
god as my witness, get into the Phi Delt
house. I may be less than charming at
times, but there are so many wicked little
things to be done. Hearts to break, ears to
blow in, anal-retentive people to badger.
Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
But let me ride out my pathos for the
week. Soon I'll run out of clean macabre
clothing and turn back to a Gap-ped
image of my former self. For just this
moment, however, I will be sad. Forgive
me for my weakness.
It's such a blast to be alive.

spend meaningless quality hours swap
ping lines from Monty Python movies?
I never wanted to work in a pet store
in the first place.
And then a friend, in a frenzied attempt
to cheer me up, asks me what, if I actually
got hit by some cumbersome transit vehi
cle, he could bring to the funeral.
A veritable ray of sunshine, he is.
But I have to think. My funeral.

Who/what would be there? My parents.
My past loves. The rugrata down the
street who used to try to run away from
home whenever I babysat. My friends, i
Or at least the ones who look good ;in
black.
Unfortunately, I'm not ready to give i}p.
I have much more tormenting of my
fellow human beings to do. I will, with
god as my witness, get into the Phi Delt
house. I may be less than charming at
times, but there are so many wicked little
things to be done. Hearts to break, ears to
blow in, anal-retentive people to badger.
Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
But let me ride out my pathos for the
week. Soon I'll run out of clean macabre
clothing and turn back to a Gap-ped
image of my former self. For just this
moment, however, I will be sad. Forgive
me for my weakness.
It's such a blast to be alive.
