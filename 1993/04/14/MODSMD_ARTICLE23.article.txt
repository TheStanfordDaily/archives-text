## Caffeine in moderation: OK — Caffeine in excess: A killer? Study says moderate caffeine consumption by pregnant women does not cause babies to be born with low birth weight 
### Heather Rock Staff writer 
What habit-forming, mind
altering drug is strong enough to
produce clinical symptoms of
anxiety, but is safe to consume
in small amounts during preg
nancy?
Caffeine. According to James
Mills, the principal investigator
for a recent study conducted by
the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Develop
ment, "a woman who drinks a
few cups of coffee or tea, or sev
eral cans of cola a day, is not at
higher risk for having a miscar
riage or a growth retarded
baby."
Caffeine has long been
assumed to be a risk to one's
health. Most physicians advise
limiting caffeine intake to
between 200 and 300 milligrams
a day, the equivalent of two 5-
ounce cups of coffee.
The study found that women
who consume less than 300 mg
of caffeine had few incidences of
babies with a low birthweight.
On the other hand, the women in
the study who consumed more
than 300 mg a day had a higher
incidence of low-birthweight
infants.
However, alternative explana

tions, like smoking, may also
contribute to the low birth
weights. Many of these women
also smoked, which is also a
known cause of low birthweight.
Taking other risk factors into
account, heavy caffeine con
sumers did not appear to expose
their infants to a higher degree
of danger than moderate con
sumers.
Although moderate caffeine
consumption does not appear to
harm one's health, overcon
sumption may lead to some prob
lems, say scientists.
This overconsumption can
have minor effects, such as the
jitters, as well as more serious
consequences like heart disease.
Caffeine belongs to a group of
compounds called methylxan
thines that stimulate neuro
transmitters in the central ner
vous system — that's why a shot
of double espresso can prevent
sleep in a tired person.
The pharmacological effects
of caffeine, called caffeinism,
include: nervousness, irritabili
ty, headaches, rapid heart rate,
shakiness, disturbed sleep, upset
stomachs, increased urine pro
duction and decreased reaction
time.
Some studies in the last
decade have shown links

between heavy caffeine con
sumption and conditions such as
pancreatic cancer, hypertension,
heart disease and fibrocystic
breast tissue — non-cancerous
lumps in the breast.
According to dietician Debra
Waterhouse, a consultant for the
Institute of Natural Resources in
Berkeley, the standard "cup"
measurement used in studies is 5
ounces.
However, the standard cup
often does not correlate to a "real
life" cup.
"Many people are drinking
several cups out of their favorite
mugs, which may be 10 to 12
ounces," Waterhouse said.
But as long as caffeine con
sumption is kept under five cups
a day, the risk of complications
remains low, Waterhouse said.
"There is equal research to
support both sides of the caffeine
link. So I recommend to women
to moderate their caffeine
intake, which is a good idea any
way," she said.
Regular caffeine consumers
develop a tolerance to its effects,
while occasional users are more
likely to notice some of the
symptoms of caffeinism. Heavy
caffeine users often go through
withdrawal symptoms like
headaches and irritability 14-16

hours after their last use.
Several studies have found
that many heavy caffeine con
sumers also smoke, eat a high
fat diet, and exercise infrequent
ly. Such correlations make it
difficult to distinguish the

causal factors of any health
problems.
College students also use caf
feine frequently, so there is a
good chance that they exceed the
recommended intake, Water
house said.

Alternatives to caffeine for
staying alert include exercise
and consuming protein. "Protein
produces a brain chemical called
dopamine which increases alert
ness, concentration and thinking
ability," Waterhouse said.
