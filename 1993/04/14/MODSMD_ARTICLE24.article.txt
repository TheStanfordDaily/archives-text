# Birds and the bees are sad and lonely
## The 						Pill and Norplant: two ways to prevent an unwanted pregnancy 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
Ahh . . . spring is in the air.
Birds are singing. Bees are
buzzing. Flowers are being pol
linated. . . .
In honor of it all, this week's
column focuses on contracep
tion.
Well, actually only on two
contraceptives, the birth con
trol pill and Norplant, two pop
ular, yet frequently misunder
stood, choices for sexually

By taking the Pill, the
body receives an
increased dose of
estrogen which stops
the processes that nor
mally tell the brain to
release the hormones
needed to begin the
development of an
egg.

active couples.
"The Pill" was invented by
Stanford's own chemistry guru,
Prof. Carl Djerrasi. It is one of
the most widely studied and
used drugs throughout the
world; in 1988, about 13.8 mil
lion American women chose it
as their contraceptive of choice.
The Pill is a synthetic combi
nation of two female sex hor
mones, estrogen and progestin.
When taken daily, the Pill
works to prevent pregnancy by
altering the level of hormones
in a woman's body.
Each month the levels of sex

hormones in a
woman's body
fluctuate, set
ting off the
cycle of events
that allow her
to reproduce.
By taking
the Pill, the
body receives

an increased dose of estrogen
which stops the processes that
normally tall the brain to
release the hormones needed to
begin the development of an
egg. As a result, ovulation does
not occur and pregnancy cannot
happen.
(Ovulation is the stage at
which an egg can become fertil
ized, resulting in pregnancy.)
The state of the body that
results from taking the Pill
resembles being pregnant, with
one exception — woman who are
on the Pill will still menstruate
— pregnant women do not.
Progestin, the other synthet
ic hormone found in the Pill,
functions to discourage preg
nancy. It causes the cervical
mucus, which usually aids
sperm motility, to thicken,
impeding sperm activity. In
addition, it renders the lining of
the uterus, where fertilized
eggs plant themselves, inhos
pitable to eggs.
For the hormones to be effec
tive, a woman must take the
pills in a 28-day cycle. For the
first 21 days , one pill must be
taken at the same time every
day. During the last seven days
of the cycle, no pills or pills
without hormones (i.e. sugar
pills) are taken.
Among contraceptives, the
pill is considered very effective.
Failure rates are between 0.1
percent and 3 percent and most
unintended pregnancies are
attributed to forgetting to take
a pill or a couple's negligence to
use a back-up contraceptive

during the
first month of
use.
Howev
er, the Pill is
not suitable
for every
woman. Smok
ers, women
with a history

of breast cancer, stroke, coro
nary disease or reproductive
system cancers as well as
women over 35 years old should
not use oral contraceptives.
Since the pill is a prescrip
tion drug, women must first see
a health professional who will
perform a pelvic exam and
check health history before
writing the prescription. Prices
for the Pill vary between $10-
$20 per month at pharmacies.
They are sold for less that $10
at Cowell.
For those who'd rather not
use the Pill, a hormonally based
contraceptive implant called
Norplant is an option.
The Cowell's Contraceptive
Information Center reports
Norplant to be extremely effec
tive at preventing pregnancy;
its failure rate is between 0.04
percent and 1.1 percent.
Norplant consists of several
capsules containing a synthetical
ly produced hormone — pro
gestin levonorgestrel. After being
inserted into a woman's upper
arm, the capsules are designed to
slowly release hormones through
the walls of the capsule into the
body. Like the Pill, the pres
ence of these additional hor
mones in the body alters the nor
mal activity of a woman's men
strual cycle and causes changes
that prevent pregnancy.
At present there are two
types of Norplant on the market
that differ because of their lifes
pan. Norplant will last for five
years and consists of six 34-
milimeter-long tubes; Norplant

2, made to last for three years,
is made up of two longer 44-mil
limeter rods.
Both types of Norplant are
inserted into the arm during a
15-minute surgical procedure
that can be done in a doctor's
office or a clinic. Sometimes the
tubes are noticeable because of
their ridges or bumps.
Many women are attracted
to Norplant because it allows a
large degree of sexual freedom.
Once it is in place, women do
not have to worry about contra
ception during every sexual"
encounter.
But the effectiveness of the
hormones in Norplant dimin
ishes over time. For this reason
the tubes need to be replaced
once in a while to ensure proper
functioning.
The effects of Norplant are
readily reversible. After it is
removed, former users have the
same pregnancy rates as women
who do not use contraception.
Like the Pill, Norplant might
be unacceptable for some
women: women with a history
of heart disease, blood clots,
unexplained vaginal bleeding,
diabetes, epilepsy, high blood
pressure or women who weigh
more than 154 pounds are
advised against Norplant.
In addition, some women are
discouraged by the initially high
cost of Norplant — the five year
version of Norplant runs for
about $350.
Some clinics may charge an
additional fee for the surgical proce
dure required to insert the device.
Norplant is available at
Stanford Hospital or Planned
Parenthood. The Pill is avail
able at Cowell Student Health
Center. For information, call
the Contraceptive Information
Center or 723-3739, or visit the
Safer Sex Shoppe located on
the first floor of the Old Fire
house.
