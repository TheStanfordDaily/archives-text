# Technology builds the new newspaper
## Panelists discuss how advances in computers will affect the future of mass media 
### Leena Prasad Staff writer 
Imagine a newspaper sans the paper.
According to a panel of experts, that's the
future; a new breed of "newspaper" readers are
emerging who do not read the news at the
breakfast table anymore. Instead, they punch
keys on their desktop computer and read it off
the monitor.
"Personally, I think newspapers are out of
business. They just don't know it," said Paul
Saffo, a research fellow at the Institute for the
Future, speaking at Monday's panel discussion
"New technology, new media."
Four panelists participated in the discus
sion, which was part of a media symposium
sponsored by The Daily.
Panelist Barry Parr, a marketing director at
The Mercury 2000 Center at the San Jose Mer
cury News explained that the Center puts out a
daily edition of the Mercury News on an elec
tronic network.
Parr said that the Mercury News is current
ly studying the potential use of this new tech
nology. In two years, they hope to exploit the
growing on-line user market. Currently, at
least 50 percent of Mercury News subscribers

own a personal computer and some of them
also subscribe to on-line information services
like CompuServe and Prodigy.
But despite writers' and editors' willingness to
go high-tech, one big obstacle stands in the way of
producing on-line newspapers — advertisers.
Many advertisers are reluctant to jump on
the electronic media bandwagon, since readers
can easily ignore advertisements in on-line for
mats, said panelists.
But "for some readers, advertisement is
part of the content," Saffo said in defense of
on-line advertising. Saffo has written several
papers discussing the emerging technology
and its role in shaping the future of the news
media.
Another problem, according to Communica
tion Prof. Clifford Nass, is that the multi-media
computer format is more complex than the
today's print media.
Nass said that the new format may not be
something that current readers find comfort
able.
"Holding the paper in your hand and having
the newspaper in a physical place are important
considerations," Nass said.
While all four panelists agreed that current
newspaper readers may not automatically

switch to the format of news on computers,
news can now be brought to more readers.
The panelists cited the growing use of elec
tronic-mail among academic and corporate
users — who may not be habitual newspaper
readers. These people, familiar with the new
technology, may begin to get their news from
on-line systems.
They also suggested that as technology pro
gresses towards a paperless world, a generation
which grows up with the new media may devel
op a new culture which is different than the
current newspaper-reading culture.
"Literacy is a moving target," said Saffo,
adding that in today's world, being a good read
er is not a sufficient criteria for success. One
also has to know how to use computers, fax
machines and other electronic media, he said.
Some newspapers are already using technol
ogy to reach a larger audience. South America's
most technologically advanced newspaper,
Hoy, is one such example. Panelist Jaime Mon
tilla, Hoy's publisher, said, "Newspapers need
to face the necessity to change."
Hoy publishes a special fax edition, offers a
special database service and a daily bulletin on
Internet, among several other electronic ser
vices.
