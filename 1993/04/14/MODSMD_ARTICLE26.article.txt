# The
						bug, lustful romance and some chocolate kisses

"How can you have the wrong
kind of orgasm? My worst one
was right on the money."
— Woody Allen
I've heard that eating
Ky chocolate stimulates simi
lar, if not the same, chemicals
as those produced during a
woman's orgasm. Is this true?
— A huge chocolate fan

A: Umm . . . Gee whiz, why
do you ask? Does your
question imply that there is a
shortage of orgasms in your
life? If so, I can think of several
ways in which you might recti
fy the situation — and none of
them involve candy bars. No,
wait; I just thought of one.
But it was pretty nasty.
Vile innuendo aside, the short
answer to your question is "No."
Even if you were to consume
enough chocolate to make your
self a literally "huge" fan of the
substance, you'd still be left look
ing for Mr. Goodbar. You would
experience neither a bona fide
orgasm nor a cheap imitation
thereof.
The question was a reason
able one. Chocolate contains a
chemical known as phenylethy
lamine (PEA), which has been
found in the human brain and is
believed to function as a neuro
transmitter associated with the
onset of romantic love.
Structurally, the PEA
molecule strongly resembles
amphetamine ("speed," if you're
in Haight-Ashbury). Clinically
depressed humans tend to have
abnormally low levels of the stuff
in their urine, and — most
importantly for our discussion —
PEA levels are elevated when you
first fall in love with someone.
The idea that PEA might
actively cause the behaviors and
feelings associated with love is
supported by the observation
that drugs which increase brain
PEA levels lead to overstimula
tion, sleeplessness, optimism,
more socially outgoing behavior
and giddiness — all ways in
which Cupid's arrow leaves its
mark on humans.
This suggests that the beauti
ful moments that fill so many of
our best memories exerted their
mood-lifting effects by doping us
up on speed.
Disturbing as the idea may be,
however, seeing love as an addic
tion of sorts explains a heck of a
lot: Seeing or merely contemplat
ing your love objects causes PEA
secretion and gives you a
euphoric rush. The more time
you spend with your petit chou,
the better you feel — and, sooner
than you can say, "Pavlov's pup
pies," you quickly learn to associ
ate the person you love with the
chemical kick their presence pro
vides.
When they head off to greener
pastures, especially if it's sudden,
you literally go through with
drawal: Unable to get your fix,
you become unmotivated, social

ly isolated and depressed. You eat
less and think unhappy thoughts
about yourself and your future.
Cold turkey is tough, whether
your junk comes from the street
corner or your neurons.
Even if your relationship
lasts forever, the highs can't.
In humans, tolerance to PEA
may build up over time, caus
ing you to need more and more
to give you your fix. After two
or three years, tops, the brain
just can't crank out the neces
sary quantities of PEA. Unless
mutual respect has developed
between you and your partner
since you first gave in to your
respective neurochemical
storms, the buildup of PEA tol
erance can be disastrous to a
relationship.
Sound familiar? Might as well
face it, we're addicted to love.
And although the textbooks still
use conditionals and subjunc
tives when describing the phe
nomenon, it seems likely that
PEA is involved.
Furthermore, some wit with
an urge to schmooze with the
media made an offhand remark
to the effect that chocolate is
loaded with PEA, and — without
having done a single experiment
— suggested that chocolate
might be used by some to boost
romantic feelings.
Chocolate is also a common
gift between lovers in our cul
ture, and everyone knows some
one who eats chocolate when
they're depressed. Could choco
late, via PEA, enhance or even
provide romantic sensations to
its consumers?
National Institutes of Health
researchers who wondered the
same thing actually went
through the discomfort of eating
pounds of chocolate and monitor
ing their PEA levels both before
and after this frightening experi
ence. To their surprise, they
found no change, suggesting that
PEA is broken down so early in
the digestive process that it
doesn't even make it into the
blood, much less the brain.
If chocolate gives you roman
tic sensations, it's due to either a
rare side effect of the sugar/caf
feine rush or a function of accul
turation — like getting painfully
drunk or spending loads of
money at The Gap. Eating choco
late is something you've learned
to do when you're feeling bored
or unloved and it makes you feel
better.
If orgasm and romance are
what you crave, then chocolate
will not do the trick. There are
simpler, more natural ways to
experience both sorts of sensa
tion. This is Stanford. There are a
lot of desperate people out there.
