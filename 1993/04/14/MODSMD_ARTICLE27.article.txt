Aggies (27-11 overall, 3-4
against Division I schools) yes
terday, Stanford (19-15 over
all) finished a difficult run of
five games in six days on an up
note.
The Cardinal never trailed in
the game. After a scoreless first
inning, Stanford jumped on
starting pitcher Tony Franchi
for two runs in the second,
helped by Davis' porous
defense.
Nate Olmstead led off the
inning with a walk, and reached
third when Jeff DesJardins sac
rificed while Brodie Van Wage
nen took first on an error by
Aggie third baseman John
Dietz. After consecutive singles
by Cale Carter, scoring Olm
stead and Brian Dallimore, Van
Wagenen crossed the plate on a
passed ball.
The Cardinal really broke
the game open in the fifth. With
one out, Steve Carver and Olm
stead walked and DesJardins
followed with an infield single,
loading the bases for Van Wage
nen, who brought everybody
home with a double off reliever
Cam Bullock.
In the bottom half of the
frame, Davis answered — but it
could have been worse for the
Cardinal. The Aggies had only
one out, one run already in, the
bases loaded, and cleanup hitter
Greg Morris at bat, but Dan
Bartels got Morris to ground
into a double play to end the

threat.
Stanford closed out its scor
ing in the Cardinal half of the
sixth as Dallimore doubled and
came home on Jed Hansen's
triple.
Davis added a run in the bot
tom of the ninth to reach the
final tally.
A quintet of pitchers shared
the load for Stanford. Dan Reed
got the win with a strong
shutout three innings, Todd
Bartels gave up one run in his
two innings, Dan Ripoll blanked
the Aggies in his frame, Olm
stead struck out four in two
innings of work and Greg Mix
threw the ninth.
Olmstead was the big sur
prise. Usually an outfielder or
designated hitter, the junior
made his second appearance on
the mound in as many days, his
first two ever as a Cardinal. He
may get some more opportuni
ties: in his three innings so far,
he has recorded six strikeouts
while giving up only one hit. He
is what baseball purists love — a
designated hitter who pitches for
himself.
The Cardinal's offense
pounded out 10 hits, but it was
willing to accept charity from
Davis' sloppy defense. The
Aggies yielded five walks, three
errors, a wild pitch and a passed
ball. In addition, Bullock
plunked Dallimore, for a total of
11 free rides.
The Cardinal welcomed

heavy production from the bot
tom of the lineup. Olmstead,
DesJardins, Van Wagenen and
Carter, Stanford's six through

nine hitters, combined for five
hits, four runs and four RBIs.
After five ballgames in six
days, the team looks forward to

a couple days of rest before it
heads to Los Angeles for a
three-game set against the
UCLA Bruins this weekend.

Aggies (27-11 overall, 3-4
against Division I schools) yes
terday, Stanford (19-15 over
all) finished a difficult run of
five games in six days on an up
note.
The Cardinal never trailed in
the game. After a scoreless first
inning, Stanford jumped on
starting pitcher Tony Franchi
for two runs in the second,
helped by Davis' porous
defense.
Nate Olmstead led off the
inning with a walk, and reached
third when Jeff DesJardins sac
rificed while Brodie Van Wage
nen took first on an error by
Aggie third baseman John
Dietz. After consecutive singles
by Cale Carter, scoring Olm
stead and Brian Dallimore, Van
Wagenen crossed the plate on a
passed ball.
The Cardinal really broke
the game open in the fifth. With
one out, Steve Carver and Olm
stead walked and DesJardins
followed with an infield single,
loading the bases for Van Wage
nen, who brought everybody
home with a double off reliever
Cam Bullock.
In the bottom half of the
frame, Davis answered — but it
could have been worse for the
Cardinal. The Aggies had only
one out, one run already in, the
bases loaded, and cleanup hitter
Greg Morris at bat, but Dan
Bartels got Morris to ground
into a double play to end the

threat.
Stanford closed out its scor
ing in the Cardinal half of the
sixth as Dallimore doubled and
came home on Jed Hansen's
triple.
Davis added a run in the bot
tom of the ninth to reach the
final tally.
A quintet of pitchers shared
the load for Stanford. Dan Reed
got the win with a strong
shutout three innings, Todd
Bartels gave up one run in his
two innings, Dan Ripoll blanked
the Aggies in his frame, Olm
stead struck out four in two
innings of work and Greg Mix
threw the ninth.
Olmstead was the big sur
prise. Usually an outfielder or
designated hitter, the junior
made his second appearance on
the mound in as many days, his
first two ever as a Cardinal. He
may get some more opportuni
ties: in his three innings so far,
he has recorded six strikeouts
while giving up only one hit. He
is what baseball purists love — a
designated hitter who pitches for
himself.
The Cardinal's offense
pounded out 10 hits, but it was
willing to accept charity from
Davis' sloppy defense. The
Aggies yielded five walks, three
errors, a wild pitch and a passed
ball. In addition, Bullock
plunked Dallimore, for a total of
11 free rides.
The Cardinal welcomed

heavy production from the bot
tom of the lineup. Olmstead,
DesJardins, Van Wagenen and
Carter, Stanford's six through

nine hitters, combined for five
hits, four runs and four RBIs.
After five ballgames in six
days, the team looks forward to

a couple days of rest before it
heads to Los Angeles for a
three-game set against the
UCLA Bruins this weekend.


Victor Cheng — Daily file
Freshman outfielder Brodie Van Wagenen had two hits, including a base-clearing double in the fifth, to
help propel the Cardinal past UC-Davis.
