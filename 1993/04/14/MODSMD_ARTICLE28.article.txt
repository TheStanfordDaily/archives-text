# Take me out to the ballgame: tales of a pinch-hitting reporter
## 
### 
Thoughts while still wondering if
Chris Webber should be awarded the
grand prize in "Timeout for Tuition":
When I arrived at Sunken Diamond, I
didn't know what to expect. After all, I had
never had the opportunity to cover the
Cardinal baseball team for the Daily. I had
attended games as a fan, sure. I had even
appeared on a KZSU broadcast of a 1992
contest and gotten boyhood hero Steve
Garvey (who was working the game for
Prime Network) to sign my scorecard.
So when my beat writer asked me to
fill in and report on the goings-on from
the final two engagements of the Stan
ford-USC series last Friday and Satur
day, I was flattered. Displaying remark
able pre-MCAT wisdom, I decided to step
down (up?) momentarily from my edito
rial "throne" and get one step closer to
the action.
When last I had seen it, the young Car
dinal squad was in action in February, and
all minds were rightfully on basketball. On
a couple of blustery occasions, I had braved
the elements to watch preseason tangles
with the likes of Santa Clara as part of an
announced crowd of 200 (many of whom,
oddly enough, came dressed as wooden

benches). Stanford was winning then,
something it did not do much of immedi
ately before or after Spring Break; in fact,

the team struggled and found itself occu
pying last place in the Six-Pac from its first
conference game to the present.
Being a concerned fan of the Cardinal
nine, the invitation to witness its pickle
(that's a baseball term; get your mind
out of the gutter!) firsthand gave me an
excuse to get my nose out of Kaplan's
color-coded prep books (yours for only
$750) and into some Coppertone Sport
(only $8 per four-ounce tube). Of course,
I would have gone anyway, but now I had
the perfect excuse.

Andrew Lorraine started Friday's con
test for Stanford on the heels of Willie
Adams' second-consecutive shutout, an
8-0 five-hitter on Thursday that was sure
to grab the attention of the first-place
Trojans. Don't get me wrong — I, along
with assorted major league scouts, have
faith in Lorraine's left arm — but I was
prepared for the worst, half-expecting
USC to come out and make like Murder
er's Row in an effort to avenge the loss
and even up the series.
Instead, I was treated to a three-hour,
22-minute slugfest that looked like Car
dinal batting practice. The two teams tal
lied 20 runs and 35 hits, 15 and 18 of
which, respectively, were Stanford's.
Five starting freshmen and two sopho
mores — Stanford's own Sensational
Seven — backed up a shaky Lorraine
outing, unfazed by the competition or
the winds that made Sunken feel like a
Diamond in the rough (or at least a mini-
Candlestick).
There was freshman third baseman
Brian Dallimore, a shortstop by high
school trade, reaching base five times
from the leadoff spot and holding down
the hot corner like an experienced

glovesman.
There was A.J. Hinch, last year's
national High School Player of the
Year, making Trojan pitchers pay
dearly for letting Dallimore roam the
basepaths. Defining the term "timely
hitting," Hinch drove in two runs and
scored one on three hits.
There was sophomore slugger Dusty
Allen, the Cardinal's reliable first base
man with the perfect baseball name,
cleaning up any straggling baserunners
in a two-for-five command performance.
The list goes on, but the poise Stan
ford demonstrated that day impressed
itself on my sun-scorched mind. I found
myself in disbelief — which exactly was
the first-place team and which the last
place one?
Ah, but I asked too soon. My assign
ment ran for two games, and when I
came back to the ballpark on Saturday,
I saw the prophesies of doom come to
fruition. As Trojan coach Mike Gilles
pie was to tell me after his team's
sweep-saving 6-4 victory, the Cardinal
— as a group of relatively inexperi
enced players — performs better
behind its experienced top two starting

pitchers, Adams and Lorraine. Howev
er, when a pitcher of similar collegiate
experience, such as Saturday starter
Todd Bartels and reliever Dan Reed,
takes the mound, an undeniable let
down occurs. Gillespie is right, as
Stanford's last two Six-Pac series have
come one Adams-less, Lorraine-less
win shy of propelling the squad back
into the title chase.
The Cardinal did not look bad on Sat
urday — it looked liked what it is, a
young team learning the ropes in what
could be the nation's most competitive
league. This is not a reason to abandon
the ship, however. This squad could still
play the spoiler and earn a spot in a Col
lege World Series Regional next month.
In the meantime, I invite the student
body to come out, get a tan, watch the
team. If nothing else, you can partake of
the swim team's heckling; it gets funnier
as the season goes on.
I'll see you there.

Andy Eiser, one of The Daily's slugging
sports editors, hopes that MCAT Saturday
is "his day," like the 21st birthday Wade
Boggs ordered for him last week.
