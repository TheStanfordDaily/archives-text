# Polo gallops to win at West Regionals
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
For the second consecutive
year, the Stanford men's polo
team has reached the Final Four
in NCAA competition. The Cardi
nal will square off against No. 1
seed Cornell in first-round com
petition this week in Fort Worth,
Texas.
Stanford reached the Final
Four two weeks ago by pummel
ing Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in
Indio, Calif. Led by the dominat
ing force of junior captain John
Harris in the midfield, the Cardi
nal won its second-consecutive
Western Regional title, 12-4.
The Cardinal sealed it victory
towards the end of the third
chucker as Harris stole the ball
and finessed a perfect pass right
onto veteran defender John
Mcßitchie's mallet. Mcßitchie
then slugged the ball through the
goal to give Stanford the go
ahead goal and the eventual vic
tory.
"We won the match and the
tournament with a good, strong
team effort," and Harris, the
tourney's Most Valuable Player.
"We stamped on our style of play
instead of getting sucked into Cal
Poly's frantic polo."
Harris tallied 11 goals on the
day through "good, solid passing
and structured team play," as he
went on to become the tourna
ment's top scorer. Stanford was
also led by the contributions of
junior Guy Elliot and senior Mor
gan McCarroll, who served as the
platoon in the forward position,
while Mcßitchie manned the goal
as the Cardinal's sole defender.
On the other field, the

women's team did not fare as well
as the men this year. Comprised
of senior Elena Reilly, freshman
Ilia Christy and sophomores Sue
jin Hwang and Sarah Wadhwani,
the squad entered the tourna
ment ranked second, and defeat
ed USC 10-6 to advance to the
finals.
There they fell victim to
defending Western Regional
champion UC Davis' more expe
rienced field of players, losing 13-
4. The two teams played to a
standstill through two chuckers
before the Aggies' Jessica Bailey
broke free for a series of goals to
leave Stanford in the du3t.
"We have a young team right
now, but I think we are going to
get better and better," Hwang
said. "Maybe next year we'll have
a good chance if we just keep it
up."
"By containing Davis for as
long as they did, the women real
ly ascended to a level of polo they
hadn't realized before," Harris
said. "Davis is a very experienced
team and (the women) fought
well enough to learn a lot from
the match. Now they're looking
forward to next season, knowing
they did their best this year."
However, the men's season is
far from over, as they will face
Trevor Wells, the nation's pre
mier polo player and Cornell's
backfielder, in the first rounu of
Final Four action. The team is
hoping to contain Wells' scoring
with a strong network of passes
and tight defense.
"If we control their big player
(Wells)," Harris said, "there's
reason to speculate that we might
go all the way, if we can get by
Cornell."
