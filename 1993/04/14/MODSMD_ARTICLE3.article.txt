# COP slates debate how to fix ASSU
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The COP campaign trail
ended with a head-to-head con
frontation between the "Blank"
and "Clean" slates as they de
bated in Donner lounge yester
day evening.
Students in attendance asked
the slates questions and Resi
dent Fellow Linda Paulson mod
erated. While the two Council of
Presidents slates disagreed on
most of the answers, they were
able to find common ground on
the need to restructure the
ASSU and increase student in
volvement.
As expected, the slates of
fered different ways to approach
these reforms.
The "Blank Slate," conduct
ing a write-in campaign, is advo
cating the removal of the COP
— placing power in the hands of
the senate, while the "Clean
Slate" wants to use the COP as a
tool to revitalize the ASSU.
The Clean Slate argued that a
COP would be best suited to
oversee reforms in the ASSU.
"The COP can play a valuable
role in restructuring the
ASSU," said Clean Slate mem
ber Ron Brown.
Clean Slate member Delia
L6pez added that "part of our
platform is restructuring the
senate and dealing with student
apathy."
"The fact is that we will be on
campus next year — we will ac
tually be able to help in restruc-

Turing," said Brown.
The Blank Slate countered
this argument, explaining that a
COP would hamper the process.
In fact, they contended that a
fundamental part of the restruc
turing should be the absence of a
COP.
"We think the senate just
wants to pass out responsibili
ties to the COP," said slate
member Jon Previtali, arguing
that an active COP deters sena
tors from taking a greater role in
the ASSU.
"What we're going to do is
leave," said Eddie Lintz, a mem
ber of the Blank Slate.
"If the ASSU realizes that
students don't want a COP,
then the senate will take the
power" said Jeremy Nelson, an
other member of the slate.
The Blank Slate argued that
the ASSU Senate ought to be the
only representative body for stu
dents. "There are a lot more spe
cific interests in a 40-person
body than in a four-person
body," said Previtali, adding
that with a COP in place the sen
ate would not be compelled to
work to represent students.
"I would rather have people
that are available to me — sena
tors to talk to," said Eddie Lintz,
Blank Slate member. "We won't
be here to meddle."
The Clean Slate, however,
claimed that the senate and
COP can work together in order
to facilitate student input and
effective legislation.
"It would be a mistake to
think that by electing a COP, the
senate will vanish," said Brown.
"What we should be compar
ing here is the input of 40 peo
ple versus that of 44," he said.
"It doesn't make sense to
remove a COP in order to make
the senate work — we should
get everyone to do the most pos
sible work."
"A COP is like a lightning
rod," said Clean Slate member
Jason Snyder. "People come to it
with issues."
But Blank Slate members
argued that a COP is incapable
of effectively articulating these
issues to the administration,
which they say is slow-moving
and unresponsive.
"I have talked to a lot of
administrators," said Previtali.
"It's amazing how I can get such
'B.S.' from them. That's one of
our points — four people
putting pressure on them is
unrealistic."
Snyder also recognized the dif
ficulties of communicating with
the administration. However, he
said the COP would help, rather
than hinder, this situation.

"The students need a group of
individuals whose job is to hound
the administration," he added.
In addition to problems with
communication, the slates also
addressed graduate student
issues in their debate — even
though only three of the 40 audi
ence members were graduate
students.
When graduate senator San
ford Dickert asked the slates
why graduate students should
believe the Clean Slate's
promise to tackle graduate stu
dent issues next year, Snyder
responded, "what we will do is
reach out to graduate leaders
and find out their concerns."
"We have outlined your con
cerns because we are committed
to students," added L6pez.
"That means undergraduates
and graduates."
The Blank Slate had a more
cynical outlook on the COP's
ability to affect graduate-stu
dent issues.
"All those who are disenfran
chised by the ASSU — like the
graduate students — are with
us," said Blank Slate member
Jason Mercer.
"We don't have a commit
ment to graduate issues," added
Lintz. "But graduate senators
do — those are the people who
should be dealing with their
issues."

Nelson summed up their
view, saying that "in (Clean
Slate's] system, the COP is, in
general, working for the under
graduates. In ours, there are 20
senators working for the gradu
ates."
At the debate, the Clean Slate
also brought up successes of the
COP in previous years to bolster
their side.
Clean Slate member Ying-
Ying Goh noted that "the
decrease in tuition increases
from 9.5 percent to 7.5 percent
this year came largely as a result
of the COP two years ago."
Snyder also said the COP rep
resented student opinions when
the current Cultures, Ideas, and
Values track system replaced the
original Western Civilization
track.
However, the Blank Slate
again expressed skepticism
about the relevance of the Clean
Slate'sgoals.
"I have two words in response
— Burrito Supreme," said Lintz,
explaining that many other
issues the COP has dealt with
are unimportant to the stu
dents.
"What we need are more tan
gible goals," he said. "I want
students to get involved in pro
jects like a Taco Bell in Tresid
der. If we want Soft Tacos, we
have to act as a student body."

cating the removal of the COP
— placing power in the hands of
the senate, while the "Clean
Slate" wants to use the COP as a
tool to revitalize the ASSU.
The Clean Slate argued that a
COP would be best suited to
oversee reforms in the ASSU.
"The COP can play a valuable
role in restructuring the
ASSU," said Clean Slate mem
ber Ron Brown.
Clean Slate member Delia
L6pez added that "part of our
platform is restructuring the
senate and dealing with student
apathy."
"The fact is that we will be on
campus next year — we will ac
tually be able to help in restruc-

Turing," said Brown.
The Blank Slate countered
this argument, explaining that a
COP would hamper the process.
In fact, they contended that a
fundamental part of the restruc
turing should be the absence of a
COP.
"We think the senate just
wants to pass out responsibili
ties to the COP," said slate
member Jon Previtali, arguing
that an active COP deters sena
tors from taking a greater role in
the ASSU.
"What we're going to do is
leave," said Eddie Lintz, a mem
ber of the Blank Slate.
"If the ASSU realizes that
students don't want a COP,
then the senate will take the
power" said Jeremy Nelson, an
other member of the slate.
The Blank Slate argued that
the ASSU Senate ought to be the
only representative body for stu
dents. "There are a lot more spe
cific interests in a 40-person
body than in a four-person
body," said Previtali, adding
that with a COP in place the sen
ate would not be compelled to
work to represent students.
"I would rather have people
that are available to me — sena
tors to talk to," said Eddie Lintz,
Blank Slate member. "We won't
be here to meddle."
The Clean Slate, however,
claimed that the senate and
COP can work together in order
to facilitate student input and
effective legislation.
"It would be a mistake to
think that by electing a COP, the
senate will vanish," said Brown.
"What we should be compar
ing here is the input of 40 peo
ple versus that of 44," he said.
"It doesn't make sense to
remove a COP in order to make
the senate work — we should
get everyone to do the most pos
sible work."
"A COP is like a lightning
rod," said Clean Slate member
Jason Snyder. "People come to it
with issues."
But Blank Slate members
argued that a COP is incapable
of effectively articulating these
issues to the administration,
which they say is slow-moving
and unresponsive.
"I have talked to a lot of
administrators," said Previtali.
"It's amazing how I can get such
'B.S.' from them. That's one of
our points — four people
putting pressure on them is
unrealistic."
Snyder also recognized the dif
ficulties of communicating with
the administration. However, he
said the COP would help, rather
than hinder, this situation.

"The students need a group of
individuals whose job is to hound
the administration," he added.
In addition to problems with
communication, the slates also
addressed graduate student
issues in their debate — even
though only three of the 40 audi
ence members were graduate
students.
When graduate senator San
ford Dickert asked the slates
why graduate students should
believe the Clean Slate's
promise to tackle graduate stu
dent issues next year, Snyder
responded, "what we will do is
reach out to graduate leaders
and find out their concerns."
"We have outlined your con
cerns because we are committed
to students," added L6pez.
"That means undergraduates
and graduates."
The Blank Slate had a more
cynical outlook on the COP's
ability to affect graduate-stu
dent issues.
"All those who are disenfran
chised by the ASSU — like the
graduate students — are with
us," said Blank Slate member
Jason Mercer.
"We don't have a commit
ment to graduate issues," added
Lintz. "But graduate senators
do — those are the people who
should be dealing with their
issues."

Nelson summed up their
view, saying that "in (Clean
Slate's] system, the COP is, in
general, working for the under
graduates. In ours, there are 20
senators working for the gradu
ates."
At the debate, the Clean Slate
also brought up successes of the
COP in previous years to bolster
their side.
Clean Slate member Ying-
Ying Goh noted that "the
decrease in tuition increases
from 9.5 percent to 7.5 percent
this year came largely as a result
of the COP two years ago."
Snyder also said the COP rep
resented student opinions when
the current Cultures, Ideas, and
Values track system replaced the
original Western Civilization
track.
However, the Blank Slate
again expressed skepticism
about the relevance of the Clean
Slate'sgoals.
"I have two words in response
— Burrito Supreme," said Lintz,
explaining that many other
issues the COP has dealt with
are unimportant to the stu
dents.
"What we need are more tan
gible goals," he said. "I want
students to get involved in pro
jects like a Taco Bell in Tresid
der. If we want Soft Tacos, we
have to act as a student body."
