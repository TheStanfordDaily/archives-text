# COP slates debate how to fix ASSU
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The COP campaign trail
ended with a head-to-head con
frontation between the "Blank"
and "Clean" slates as they de
bated in Donner lounge yester
day evening.
Students in attendance asked
the slates questions and Resi
dent Fellow Linda Paulson mod
erated. While the two Council of
Presidents slates disagreed on
most of the answers, they were
able to find common ground on
the need to restructure the
ASSU and increase student in
volvement.
As expected, the slates of
fered different ways to approach
these reforms.
The "Blank Slate," conduct
ing a write-in campaign, is advo
cating the removal of the COP
— placing power in the hands of
the senate, while the "Clean
Slate" wants to use the COP as a
tool to revitalize the ASSU.
The Clean Slate argued that a
COP would be best suited to
oversee reforms in the ASSU.
"The COP can play a valuable
role in restructuring the
ASSU," said Clean Slate mem
ber Ron Brown.
Clean Slate member Delia
L6pez added that "part of our
platform is restructuring the
senate and dealing with student
apathy."
"The fact is that we will be on
campus next year — we will ac
tually be able to help in restruc-

Turing," said Brown.
The Blank Slate countered
this argument, explaining that a
COP would hamper the process.
In fact, they contended that a
fundamental part of the restruc
turing should be the absence of a
COP.
"We think the senate just
wants to pass out responsibili
ties to the COP," said slate
member Jon Previtali, arguing
that an active COP deters sena
tors from taking a greater role in
the ASSU.
"What we're going to do is
leave," said Eddie Lintz, a mem
ber of the Blank Slate.
"If the ASSU realizes that
students don't want a COP,
then the senate will take the
power" said Jeremy Nelson, an
other member of the slate.
The Blank Slate argued that
the ASSU Senate ought to be the
only representative body for stu
dents. "There are a lot more spe
cific interests in a 40-person
body than in a four-person
body," said Previtali, adding
that with a COP in place the sen
ate would not be compelled to
work to represent students.
"I would rather have people
that are available to me — sena
tors to talk to," said Eddie Lintz,
Blank Slate member. "We won't
be here to meddle."
The Clean Slate, however,
claimed that the senate and
COP can work together in order
to facilitate student input and
