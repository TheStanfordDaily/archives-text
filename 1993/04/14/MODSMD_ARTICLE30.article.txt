## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team took over four hours to do
it, but it finally pounded
unranked Utah into submission
with a 6-3 victory. The Cardinal
(16-3, 5-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) wrapped up the match by
taking five out of six singles
matches, then lost two of three
matches in the doubles competi
tion.
Junior Michael Flanagan,
Stanford's No. 1 singles player,
did not play due to a bacterial
infection, which gave Robert
Devens the chance to play in the
No. 1 match. The junior did not
disaopoint, running his individ

ual match record to 14-3 with a
6-3, 6-4 victory over Utah's
Toby Curtis.
Patei, however, could not
repeat the success in the No. 2
match. The junior lost to Jeff
Weichers in a three-setter, 4-6,
6-2, 7-6.

"The one damper in the whole
competition, I would say, was
Vimal's singles loss," coach Dick
Gould said. "Some of the things he
was doing were good, but at times
there was some bad execution, and
that cost him the match."
No. 3, junior Chris Cocotos,
took the Utes' Chris Reilly in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-4, and
freshman Jeff Salzenstein made
similar short work of Graeme
Cox in the No. 4 match, 6-4, 6-2.
"I'm very pleased with the
players who don't gel much
attention, 'ike Salzenstein and
IJimmy] Thomas and [Roman]
Sydorak," Gould ,>aid.
Junior Billy Wright finished
off Jay Quimby in the No. C
match, 6-4, 7-5, whiie freshman

Ricky Becker notched his third
singles win in as many appear
ances with a 7-5, 6-4 decision
over Magnus Hjalmarson in the
No. 6 match.
The doubles matches were
not as successful for the Cardi
nal, as the No. 2 team of
Thomas *nd Salzenstein scored
the only Stanford doubles win,
6-2, 6-1, over Weichers and Cox.
The No. 3 team of Sydorak and
Mihir Mankad dropped a 6-1, 5-
7, 7-5 match to Reilly and Hjal
marson, while Devens and Patel
staved off four match points in
the second set before succumb
ing to Curtis and Quimby in the
third, 7-5, 6-7, 6-3.
"I didn't think we started out
the No. 1 doubles match with much
spark," Gould said, "especially after
Vimal [Patel's] heartbreak loss in
singles."
Stanford faces perhaps its
toughest challenge of the year
this weekend, as it hosts No. 2
USC and No. 1 UCLA on Friday
and Saturday at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium. The Cardinal will
try to even the season series
with the Los Angeles squads.
"If we play to capability and
play reasonably solid, we can
win these matches," Gould said.
"If anyone is going to beat them
when it counts, it's going to be a
team like us."
Gould emphasized that a
strong fan section will be need
ed to bolster the team against
the nation's top two teams this
weekend.
"The biggest factor that
could help us right now is crowd
support,*' Gould said. "We need
our guys to have confidence in
their games and feel good about
themselves out there, and they
get that when the crowd is
cheering on every point."
Stanford meets USC at 1:30
p.m. on Friday, and UCLA at 1 p.m.
