# Rodney King looks on as L.A. Dodgers fall to Cardinals, 9-7
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - While a
jury deliberated in his civil rights
trial, Rodney King paid a visit to
Dodger Stadium. What he saw was
all too familiar to Los Angeles fans.
Lee Smith became baseball's all
time saves leader and Gerald Perry
made up for a big mistake by hitting
a three-run pinch-hit homer Tues
day as the St. Louis Cardinals beat
Los Angeles 9-7 in the Dodgers'
home opener.
King attended the game as a
guest of Dodgers outfielders Eric
Davis and Darryl Strawberry.
"I've been talking to Rodney for a
few months now," Davis said,
explaining he was introduced to
King by former Los Angeles Rams
player Ron Jessie. "I met with Rod
ney during the offseason and he's an
avid baseball fan.
"I invited him over to my house,
he accepted, and we've become
friends. He asked me if he could
come to the game and I said, 'Sure.'
He's a Dodger fan, just like every
body else."
The jury retired for the day with
out reaching a verdict shortly before
Smith retired Tim Wallach on a fly
to right field with runners at second
and third to end the game.
"It's a very touchy situation,"
Strawberry said. "You like to see a
guy his life. He'll come out in

public and feel relaxed and not feel
so tensed up about everything."
Nearly a year ago, four games
were postponed because of rioting in
the downtown area following the
acquittal of four Los Angeles police
officers charged in the videotaped
beating of King.
Smith pitched a scoreless ninth
inning for his 358 th career save, sur
passing Jeff Reardon of Cincinnati.
It was Smith's third save this season.
"The first save, the 300 th save,
and today were all against the
Dodgers," Smith said. "That's pret
ty weird, they usually hit me pretty
good.
"I'm not in the game to set
records, I want to pitch in the World
Series, hopefully this year."
Smith, 35, is coming off his two
best seasons — 47 saves in 1991 and
43 last year.
With the Dodgers leading 7-5 and
two outs in the seventh, Peny hit
his fourth career pinch homer off
Pedro Martinez (0-1) to spoil a Los
Angeles comeback. Todd Zeile sin
gled and Bernard Gilkey walked ear
lier in the inning.
Perry arrived at Dodger Stadium
less than an hour before the game.
"I just assumed it was a night
game, I got a call from (equipment
manager) Buddy Bates," Perry said.
"I was shocked, and very embar

rassed. That's never happened
before, and it won't happen again,
that's for sure.
"I was up since 8:30, ordered
breakfast, talked on the phone. I was
watching 'The Bodyguard.' Right at
the end of the movie, Buddy called
me. It was a horrible feeling."
Said Cardinals manager Joe
Torre: "I might make him stay at
the hotel tomorrow. We needed a lift
at that time, he really picked us up."
Strawberry lunged into the right
field seats in pursuit of Perry's homer,
but said a fan took it away from him.
"I guess he felt kind of stupid,
because everybody was getting on
him," Strawberry said. "They ran
him out of the ballpark, and hope
fully they won't let him back in."
Tom Pagnozzi's homer off rookie
Rick Trlicek with two outs in the
ninth completed the scoring.
The Dodgers, trying to rebound
from a 63-99 record and a last-place
finish in the NL West last year, fell
behind 5-0, but scored seven unan
swered runs, the final two against
winner Les Lancaster (1-0) in the
sixth on RBI singles by Brett Butler
and Davis.
The Cardinals took a 4-0 lead in
the first after starter Kevin Gross
retired the first two batters. Mark
Whiten and Pagnozzi had RBI sin
gles and Gilkey singled in two runs.
