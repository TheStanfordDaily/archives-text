Fourth-year medical student
Reuben Granich was "shocked
and offended" when he received
a booklet containing these and
other anti-abortion jokes in the
mail. He and at least one other
medical school student have re
cently received harassing anti
abortion mail, and in light of re
cent violence against doctors
who perform abortions, stu

dents and Medical School offi
cials are concerned.
The 14-page pamphlet, titled
"Bottom Feeder," was distrib
uted to medical students by Life
Dynamics Inc., an organization
based in Lewisville, Texas.
"The pamphlet is just full of
homophobic, sexist, racist jokes
—incredibly offensive materi
al," Granich said. "I felt both
threatened and incensed."
Granich is not alone; in the
wake of Florida doctor David
Gunn's death on March 10, doc
tors and medical students are
taking threats from anti-abor
tion groups more seriously.
"At first I was disgusted,
then angry that they would be
sending me this obnoxious
piece of garbage through the
mail," Granich said.
Although the graduating
medical student is not planning
to go into obstetrics and gynecol
ogy, he said that his contact with
Life Dynamics "would make me
think twice (about entering that
field)."
According to Granich, when he
called the Texas agency to inquire
and complain about the pam
phlet, he was told the iiituliagAxras

"not a personal threat." But "they
wanted me to know that if I
became an abortionist my life
would be miserable . . . plagued
with phone calls, pickets, harass
ing mail, that kind of thing,"
Granich said.
Life Dynamics has refused to
comment, but other pro-life
activists have questioned the
pamphlet's format.
The cartoon-like brochure
which Life Dynamics, Inc. uses to
present important pro-life mes
sages "undermines the entire

pro-life movement," said Jack
Guerrero of Stanford Students
for Life.
"A lot of the message itself
they incorporated into the pam
phlet I would express in other
ways ... in a more serious man
ner," Guerrero said.
Granich agrees. "I don't think
this represents (all) pro-life peo
ple — not everybody's being rep
resented by this fringe group," he
said.
Asst. Prof. Kate O'Hanlan,
associate director of Stan fowl

Gynecologic Cancer Services and
a pro-choice activist, said that the
pamphlet's level and humor
"insult American college students
tremendously."
"It is amazing to me how low
they have stooped in using bath
room vulgarity to make their
point," O'Hanlan said.
The Medical School has
received two complaints from
students arbitrarily receiving
anti-abortion mail, according to
Donna Daly, the registrar for
xnadical sad graduate student

affairs.
"Both of the incidents were
with pre-clinical students," Daly
said, meaning that neither has
declared any intention of pursu
ing obstetrics and gynecology.
While both Gunn's death and
pamphlets like "Bottom Feeder"
highlight the fierce debate over
abortion, Granich doubts that
intimidation tactics will change
medical students' opinions.
"If you're really committed to
providing abortions, threats like
this aren't going to sway you/'

Granich said.
"The medical students that I
talk to are uniformly pro-choice
and would find this material rep
rehensible," O'Hanlan said.
According to Pamela Schroed
er of the Stanford post office,
offensive pamphlets qualify as
protected speech and are not ille
gal to mail.
"Unless it's sexually oriented,
all you can do is send a nasty let
ter saying you don't agree with or
are offended by what they are
sending you," Schroeder said.
