# 'Genocide': Toxic waste sites target minorities
## 
### Josh Gohlke 
American corporations and
governments practice a form of
genocide by deliberately selecting
minority communities as sites for
toxic waste dumps and polluting
factories, environmental activist
Richard Moore said in a speech last
night.
Moore, a founding member of
the Southwest Network for Envi
ronmental and Economic Justice,
delivered his speech, titled "Toxi
cs, Race, and Class: The Poisoning
of Communities of Color," in Ter
man Auditorium.
Moore accused U.S. corpora
tions of "intentional targeting of
communities of color" for environ
mentally dangerous activities.

"You can't talk about the envi
ronment without talking about
racism," Moore said. "We have to
talk about genocide. It cannot be
anything else."
The speech, delivered to a
crowd of about 50, was sponsored
by MEChA and Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford as
the second in a series of events
scheduled for Earth Month.
Moore cited examples of what
he calls "environmental racism"
â€” from lead paint still exist ing on
the walls of low-income housing
projects to extremely high cancer
rates among Native Americans be
cause of exposure to uranium min
ing.
