# 'Genocide': Toxic waste sites target minorities
## 
### Josh Gohlke 
American corporations and
governments practice a form of
genocide by deliberately selecting
minority communities as sites for
toxic waste dumps and polluting
factories, environmental activist
Richard Moore said in a speech last
night.
Moore, a founding member of
the Southwest Network for Envi
ronmental and Economic Justice,
delivered his speech, titled "Toxi
cs, Race, and Class: The Poisoning
of Communities of Color," in Ter
man Auditorium.
Moore accused U.S. corpora
tions of "intentional targeting of
communities of color" for environ
mentally dangerous activities.

"You can't talk about the envi
ronment without talking about
racism," Moore said. "We have to
talk about genocide. It cannot be
anything else."
The speech, delivered to a
crowd of about 50, was sponsored
by MEChA and Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford as
the second in a series of events
scheduled for Earth Month.
Moore cited examples of what
he calls "environmental racism"
— from lead paint still exist ing on
the walls of low-income housing
projects to extremely high cancer
rates among Native Americans be
cause of exposure to uranium min
ing.
"Unfortunately, I could go on
and on with examples from all
over," he said.
Moore's network consists of
71 affiliate organizations — such
as women's and youth groups as
well as trade unions — in eight
states, including California, and
Mexico. Most of the members
and all of the directors of the
organization are black, Latino,
Asian-American or Native Amer
ican.
"We realize that it is a class
issue," said Moore, referring to
the fact that poor whites are also
the victims of pollution and haz
ardous waste in regions such as
Appalachia and elsewhere. "But
it is also a race issue."
The U.S. Environmental Pro
tection Agency has been ineffec
tive in dealing with environmen
tal issues in communities of
color, Moore said.
"The EPA has practiced selec
tive enforcement of regulations,"
he said. "Our people are being
poisoned, and they have the
nerve to tell us it's because of the
food we're eating."
Moore also noted that the EPA
has only appointed one minority
person its higher-ranking posi
tions.
The Southwest Network is
scheduled to meet with the new
head of the EPA, Carol Brown
ing, in late May to discuss many
of these issues. The organization
maintains an EPA accountability

campaign to keep track of the
agency's actions.
Moore also expressed mixed
feelings about the new adminis
tration. In spite of the new vice
president's reputation as an
environmentalist, Moore said he
has doubts about his dependabil
ity.
"We just hope Gore lives up to
what he wrote in his own book,"

he said.
The group's main hope howev
er, according to Moore, is in the
actions of minority community
members themselves.
"We have a heavy responsibil
ity," he said. "If we're going to
sit back and wait, we may be sit
ting back for 500 more years. We
cannot blame anyone but our
selves."
