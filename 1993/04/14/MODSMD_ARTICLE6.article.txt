# Trustees OK pared-down '93-'94 budget
## $472 million operating budget calls for spending cuts, new revenue 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Next year's $472 million operating budget
— which includes $10 million in new spending
cuts — was easily approved yesterday by the
Board of Trustees.
The cuts and $5 million in additional rev
enue will allow the University to almost com
plete a two-year, $42 million deficit-reduction
program that began last year.
Director of University Budgets Tim Warner
said the 1993-94 budget — especially the cuts

— did not come as a surprise to Board members
since they had seen the plan before when they
passed similar cuts last spring for this year's
budget.
Of the budget cuts that comprise the $42
million deficit-reduction program, 60 percent
deal with academic and administrative areas of
the University. Next year's budget shows cuts
of $2.9 million from academic areas and $4.5
million from administrative areas.
The added income will come primarily from
a 7.5 percent tuition increase — more than
double the rate of inflation — and an increase

in the endowment payout rate to 6.75 percent.
Normally, 4.75 percent of the interest ac
crued from the University's endowment fund
— the fund's payout rate — is used to fund the
operating budget. But last June, the trustees
approved a temporary two-year, 2 percent in
crease in the payout rate to help offset budget
deficits.
The operating budget was submitted Mon
day to the Board's Finance Committee and
Academic Policy and Planning Committee,
Warner said.
After these committees
approved the budget with little dis
cussion, it was sent to the entire
Board for approval yesterday,
Warner said.
The trustees approved the
entire budget as it was submitted
to them, said Assistant to the Pres
ident Jean Fetter.
"I think there was a generally
positive reaction on how the plan
ning and implementation [of the
adjustments] is going," Warner
said.
"There was general praise for
the president and the provost for
all the effort that went into the
budget process," said Board secre
tary Marlene Wine.
Wine said the trustees only
raised a few general points or clar
ifications in discussing the budget.
This year's budget also includes
a $7 million contingency fund for
any changes that may occur in the
federal government's policies
regarding indirect costs.
While Provost Gerald Lieber
man said last week that he expects
the government to issue new cost
recovery regulations, which are
currently capped at a rate of 60.3
percent, he said he feels the $7 mil
lion should adequately cover any
changes.
Despite the cuts, some areas
will receive more money next year.
For instance, the budget restores
approximately $200,000 to
Libraries and Information
Resources — a move made after
what Lieberman described as
"vociferous" student reaction.
In addition, faculty salaries will
increase by an average of 4 per
cent next year, according to the
budget.
