# Trustees OK pared-down '93-'94 budget
## $472 million operating budget calls for spending cuts, new revenue 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Next year's $472 million operating budget
— which includes $10 million in new spending
cuts — was easily approved yesterday by the
Board of Trustees.
The cuts and $5 million in additional rev
enue will allow the University to almost com
plete a two-year, $42 million deficit-reduction
program that began last year.
Director of University Budgets Tim Warner
said the 1993-94 budget — especially the cuts

— did not come as a surprise to Board members
since they had seen the plan before when they
passed similar cuts last spring for this year's
budget.
Of the budget cuts that comprise the $42
million deficit-reduction program, 60 percent
deal with academic and administrative areas of
the University. Next year's budget shows cuts
of $2.9 million from academic areas and $4.5
million from administrative areas.
The added income will come primarily from
a 7.5 percent tuition increase — more than
double the rate of inflation — and an increase

in the endowment payout rate to 6.75 percent.
Normally, 4.75 percent of the interest ac
crued from the University's endowment fund
— the fund's payout rate — is used to fund the
operating budget. But last June, the trustees
approved a temporary two-year, 2 percent in
crease in the payout rate to help offset budget
deficits.
The operating budget was submitted Mon
day to the Board's Finance Committee and
Academic Policy and Planning Committee,
