William Greider cited the "sys
temic breakdown of democratic
understanding" as the primary
source of America's economic
downturn when he addressed an
audience of 200 at Kresge Audito
rium last night.

"Most Americans no longer feel
represented in the process of gov
ernment," said Greider, author of
"Who Will Tell the People?," a re
cent book that examines faults in
the American political process.

tent. It's not a cyclical economic

discontent. I think it's much
deeper," Greider explained. "This
feeling of powerlessness is the
result of political failures."
In addition to the failure of
democracy, Greider identified
the end of the Cold War, the
continued expanse of the global
economy and the media's dis
tance from the public as major
factors influencing the nation's
current predicament. And he
identified entrenched cynicism
as a hindrance to potential
restoration of democracy.
Greider, a long-time journalist
and former managing editor at
the Washington Post, described
the economic and social condi
tions the next generation of
adults (people who are currently
college-aged) will experience as
critical to determining America's
long-term economic and political
future.
Greider said that many essen
tial questions concerning democ

racy, equality and freedom will
come to the forefront in the near
future. "One of the things miss
ing in our society today is mutual
respect," he explained.
He said he believes that Amer
ica cannot reach a state of mutu
al respect, particularly in regard
to governmental representation,
until "at some level, everyone
counts and everybody will be lis
tened to."
In particular, he challenged
the audience by asking, "Is there
a ground where [the public]
might all assemble together and
accumulate real power? Can you
even imagine such a place?"
Despite the overwhelming
complexities clouding any clear
solutions to our nation's demo
cratic failures, Greider remains
optimistic. "Can you really
believe in regenerating that sense
of connection that people once
had?" he asked. "I think that it's
humanly possible. In fact, it's a
universal yearning."
"Democracy is the abstract
but essential glue that makes this
country work," Greider added.
"Even if we don't carry it out, we

still believe in the idea of political
equality."
Greider praised presidential
candidate Ross Perot for provid
ing a means for Americans to
channel their anger toward the
Los Angeles riots and other inci
dents exposing our nation's
tainted democracy.
In addition, Greider attacked
the American public's "short
attention span" with regard to
presidential proposals.
"It is both unfair and irra
tional to sit back and say, 'We
have this president who's going
to do all these nice things,' " and
then when these changes don't
happen immediately, nag on his
failures.
Greider closed his speech by
urging everyone to help restore
the "democratic connection" he
feels America currently lacks.
Though he didn't propose
any specifics, "The effort
itself, in a way, is its own
reward," he said. "(People who
do this) discover themselves.
They literally find qualities in
themselves that they didn't
know existed."
