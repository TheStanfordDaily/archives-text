King verdict delayed
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Deliberations
in the Rodney King beating trial were
interrupted in their fifth day yesterday
when a juror got sick and went to a doc
tor.
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies
said he expected jurors to resume deliber
ations today on whether four police offi
cers violated King's federal civil rights in
the videotaped beating.
The jury has deliberated 25 1/2 hours.
In a state trial last year, jurors deliberat
ed 32 hours before acquitting the officers
of most charges.
The acquittals sparked riots that left
54 people dead and caused $1 billion in
damages.
Attorneys said that if the juror became
too sick to continue, one of three alter
nate jurors would be chosen by lot to
enter the deliberations.
"The real problem is if the new juror
gets in there, they have to start all over
again," said defense attorney Harland
Braun. Asst. U.S. Attorney Steven Cly

mer said he too hoped Davies wouldn't
dismiss the ill juror.
Envoy warns Serbs
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Pres
ident Clinton's special envoy warned
Yugoslav leaders yesterday that they face
complete isolation if Bosnian Serbs do
not stop committing atrocities and make
peace.
The United States and its allies also
will press for Bosnia's largely Muslim
government to be exempted from a
U.N. arms embargo if Bosnian Serbs do
not sign a U.N.-sponsored peace plan,
envoy Reginald Bartholomew told
reporters.
"The military and human horror has
to stop now," he said. "Bosnian Serbs
have to do it now."
Bartholomew and Russian envoy
Vitaly Churkin were engaged in what
seemed to be a last-ditch attempt to get
Bosnia's Serbs to sign a peace plan
already agreed to by Muslim and Croat
leaders in the former Yugoslav state.
