JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) â€” In an outpouring of black rage,
millions of workers went on strike yes
terday to protest the slaying of black
leader Chris Hani. At least four people
were killed and hundreds wounded as
blacks battled police.
The worst clash was in the black
township of Soweto, where police fired
on marchers outside the main police sta
tion. Hospital spokeswoman Adri Potgi
eter said three people died, five were crit
ically wounded and 259 suffered minor
wounds.
Police claimed they fired because
protesters were hurling rocks, but wit
nesses said most of the crowd was calm
and had started to leave the area.
Among the dead was African National
Congress official Sam Ntobane, the
black group said.
Police and soldiers fired shotguns,
rubber bullets and tear gas at looters
who rampaged through shops in Cape
Town and torched vehicles. A hand
grenade exploded and injured 10 sol

diers, and medical officials said a man
was killed and about 150 people were
wounded in the looting.
Hani, head of the South African Com
munist Party and one of the ANC's most
popular leaders, was assassinated out
side his home Saturday. A white right
winger has been charged in the murder.
Across much of the country yester
day, mourners expressed their sadness
by attending peaceful memorial services
and marches, heeding the ANC's call for
a one-day strike.
"It was one of the best-attended stay
aways ever," said economist Miekie
Dames. Business groups said as many
as 75 percent of the nation's 6 million
black workers were on strike, meaning
a possible $160 million loss to the econ
omy.
Black and white leaders are strug
gling to prevent anger over Hani's killing
from derailing talks on ending apartheid
and giving the black majority the vote.
The government and the ANC have said
they will press ahead with talks.

"We could have ended up with a much
worse situation," said ANC Secretary-
General Cyril Ramaphosa. He warned
that if negotiations did not speed up,
"worse could happen."
President F.W. de Klerk called yester
day night for a meeting with ANC presi
dent Nelson Mandela as soon as possible.
He said an additional 3,000 troops
and police would be sent to combat
unrest, bolstering the 23,000 on the
streets yesterday.
"What happened in South Africa
today cannot be tolerated in any civilized
country," de Klerk said.
At one of the biggest memorial ser
vices, about 20,000 people squeezed into
Soweto's small Jabulani Stadium, where
Mandela pleaded for calm.
"I appreciate that our young people
are very angry because their hero has
been killed," he said as the crowd surged
dangerously toward the small stage. But
"to return to violence only means more
innocent people are going to continue
dying."
