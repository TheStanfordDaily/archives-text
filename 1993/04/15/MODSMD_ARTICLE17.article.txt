## Setting the record straight 
### 
NOW, I'M under fire. It has been
brought to my attention on the
pages of The Daily on Monday
that I have a problem. I am a paranoid
black man who is "searching for racism"
and consequently misunderstood the
intent of the East Palo Alto photo essay.
Now, I would like to set the record
straight.
First, the argument against me spent
most of its time showing me how the
accusations of racism are rootless.
What's interesting to me is the fact that
at no point in my column did I accuse
anyone of being racist.
What I said was that the piece was ill
conceived and irresponsible. In my opin
ion, it was ill-conceived because it exploit
ed human suffering while neglecting its
systemic causes. This aspect was never
addressed.
Also, it was irresponsible because it
perpetuated the media stereotype of
drug users and criminals being poor
black and Latino. The media has his
torically created and perpetuated the
image of young black and latino men as
being criminals and dangerous. As an
agent of the media, publications have a
responsibility to counteract that. If
they present pictures that fit the
stereotype, even if that wasn't their
intent, they have effectively perpetuat
ed the myth.
Their defense is that I am the one fix-

resource, it should not ask students to
pay for its retreat.
Stanford $62,040
United for
Rape Elimination
(DYES O NO
SURE helps ensure that Stanford is a com
munity that is not obsessed with and over
whelmed by fear once the sun sets.
Stanford $5,746
Volunteer Network
(DYES O NO
Over 2,000 students annually participate in
activities designed or aided by the SVN.
This organization's shoestring budget works
out to approximately $3 per volunteer.
SWEAT $5,653
OYES (D NO
The Stanford Wilderness Educational
Active orientation Trips sponsors outdoor
education and leadership trips for medical
students. However, their excursions, open
only to Medical School, should not be fund
ed by the entire University.
Stanford $25,734
Women's Center
(DYES O NO
The SWC provides a haven for the Society
of Women Engineers, Cap and Gown,
Inter-Sorority Council, National Women's
Political Caucus and other groups.
Students for $11,563
East European
Development
(DYES O NO
For a relatively minor sum, SEED coordi
nates the efforts of volunteers to teach
English in Eastern Europe as well as bring
ing foreign students to Stanford.
Students for $15,626
Environmental Action
at Stanford
(DYES O NO
Stanford's primary environmental organi

ated upon race because I don't see people
as people but rather as races.
Following this logic I'm accused of try
ing to escalate the issue to a Rodney King
incident and that I speak from an isolat
ed and uninformed perspective.
As a black man in this country who
has been accosted and brutalized by those
who have internalized the media stereo
types of the culturally constructed cate
gories of race, I am far from isolated and
uniformed. I suffer the consequences of
the stereotype everyday. So to say I'm
buying into the stereotype — by calling
someone out who is perpetuating it — is
ridiculous.
And furthermore how is it that riding
in a police car at night gives someone a
holistic and informed perspective? A com
ment like "[East Palo Alto] has little
money because its most profitable indus
try, drugs, is illegal and thus untaxable"
hardly seems to come from an informed
perspective.
The most important thing I have to
say is this. In my column I emphasized
that it wasn't even the night-day / black
white theme that got me the most upset.
I said it was the fact that EPA was por
trayed the way it was.
It was written that it was "[The
Daily's] hope that the graphic images
would waken Stanford from its normal
routine and people would see the terrible
violence and then see a way to help." How

zation, SEAS's Students for Environmen
tal EDucation program and its efforts for
stricter environmental policies at Stan
ford are both worthy candidates for sup
port.
You Can $17,546
Make A Difference
Conference
(DYES O NO
The You Can Make A Difference Confer
ence has, in the past, brought speakers
such as Ted Koppel and Tom Brokaw to
campus; the ASSU fee request will see
that Stanford remains a forum for the dis
cussion of pivotal social issues.
Publications $50,383
Board
(DYES O NO
The publications board supports a legion of
campus publications; howevor, in a time of
budget cuts, to expand greatly upon its
budget would be wrongheaded.
Program $161,120
Board
+5%
This appropriations and budgetary group
has been effective. Yet it needs to keep a
closer eye on the discrepancies between
promises made and promises kept.
Community $108,459
Service Board
+5%
A slight increase will once again reaffirm
Stanford's commitment to aiding the com
munities around us.
Constitutional Amendment
(DYES O NO
Will amend the constitution to make
ASSU fee refunds available for all stu
dents.

Editorial Board did not interview these

ommendation regarding their
requests.

could they think their readers would see
a way to help when they made it clear
that "one can only hope that the police
and the citizens can help EPA lose [its
violent reputation]"?
I say again if you want to have the
night and day theme, then juxtapose
Stanford/Palo Alto with East Palo Alto.
Explore what role we (as the beneficiaries
of this system) play in creating systemic
joblessness and how we literally drive
people to use and sell drugs?
So I call to you, make your voice
heard. Write to The Daily. Don't let me
be written off as an angry black man
who, as it was put, is just "perpetuating
his paranoid delusion that the Daily
staff as a bunch of conservative big
ots. ..."
I don't think that because a publica
tion puts forth a well-intended but irre
sponsible piece they are conservative big
ots. I do think, though, that good inten
tions aren't enough. We need to engage in
a serious, in-depth discussion and study
of race and class so that we will be able to
effectively bring about understanding
and change.
