## Donald Kennedy Former Stanford president pays tribute to Stegner 
### 
THE NIGHT OF Wally Stegner's
death, but before I knew of it, I
had a dream about him; he was in
his role of environmentalist and West
ern geographer, a role not unlinked, of
course, to that of Wally Stegner the
writer. I was examining a strange map
of North America — one on which the
watersheds of the major river basins
were outlined. To my amazement it
showed the Colorado drainage extend
ing all the way into the Upper Midwest;
in my dream I confirmed this unexpect
ed geography by tracing the flows of
tributary streams.
To Wally, standing beside me, I
remarked how amazing it was that this
river appeared to drain half of the Unit
ed States, yet was responsible for less
than a quarter of the total runoff vol
ume. I went on to remind him of how,
in"The Sound of Mountain Water," he
had written of the aridity of the West,
and the oasis character of the society

that had grown up in it.
I don't know why Wally was there in
my dream. I tend to resist the supernat
ural explanations for these sorts of coin
cidences; perhaps he was there only
because I so often look to him for the
most thoughtful, literate expression of
the values I associate with nature. But
the juxtaposition of the dream and his
death hit me especially hard, because it
was such a dramatic reminder of just
how much we have lost.
In his non-fiction, he gave us the
finest and most memorable portraits of
the West: landscapes, natural history
and people. And his fiction was laced
with the most accurate and enchanting
descriptions of everything from winter
California storms to the ecology of cha
parral. Indeed, the novella that actually
launched the Portola Valley series was
entitled "A Field Guide to the Western
Birds." He was a thoughtful and persua
sive conservationist with a deep under

standing of what environments mean to
people. So the people in his novels
always move against a beautifully ren
dered natural landscape that illumi
nates them without blinding the reader.
Eight years ago I invited the late
Norman Maclean, the author of "A
River Runs Through It," to lecture at
Stanford. It was not difficult to per
suade Wally to introduce Maclean,
whom he had never met. That occasion
was memorable in two ways. Maclean
spoke of his unfinished work on the
Mann Gulch fire in Montana, since
posthumously published as "Young
Men and Fire"; it was a gripping
account. But Wally's introduction, a fel
low author's critical appreciation of
"River," was a masterpiece in its own
right: insightful, generous and sea
soned with the barest dash of honestly
disclosed professional rivalry. I have
and treasure the original typescript of
that introduction.

Wally Stegner built a splendid tradi
tion in creative writing at Stanford,
and the list of authors he and his suc
cessors have launched is by now leg
endary. So is their loyalty; a substan
tial chunk of Scott Turow's first royal
ties from "Presumed Innocent" went to
endow a Stegner Fellowship, and that
is a form of immortality that anyone —
even Wally, a notorious curmudgeon
about recognition — should like. He
and Mary readily earned the love that
prompted such acts.
But Wally's most enduring legacy is
a remarkable body of fiction. It begins
with "The Big Rock Candy Mountain,"
and ends with "Crossing to Safety."
Between those end-books are no less
than 50 years of Wally's life — years
in which he himself largely retraced
the landscape-crossing paths of his
subjects. The first is really about the
Westward Movement. A young man's
first novel, it is about youth — espe-

daily its recklessness. The last is
about a much older man's return to a
more settled, reflective environment
in the East. Thus these works recapit
ulate Wally's own personal history,
but in a larger sense they reflect
changes in his — and our — approach
to the world around us. First, there is
the pull to the frontier and the feel
ing, still very much alive in pre-World
War II America, that we could expand
exuberantly and even carelessly in it.
And then, half a century later, there is
the vision of a more settled and filled
up country, with which we now need
to find a new, more cautious and more
responsible relationship. Wally's
metaphor for this final returning
might serve as an epitaph for him; it
should be enduring advice for the rest
of us.
