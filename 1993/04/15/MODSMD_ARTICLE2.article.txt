# Faculty pay remains high
## Study shows Stanford salaries above average 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Despite budget cuts and other financial
woes, Stanford's average faculty salary re
mains one of the nation's highest, accord
ing to a recent survey conducted by the
American Association of University Pro
fessors.
The survey reported that at private doc
toral institutions like Stanford, the aver
age annual salary for a full professor is
$80,280. At Stanford, however, salaries
for full professors average $91,200.
In addition, the survey found that an
nual pay increases at most institutions
dropped to 2.5 percent this year, failing for
the second time in three years to keep pace
with inflation, which was 2.9 percent at
the end of 1992.
At Stanford, however, the pay increase
— like the salaries — was above average.
In spite of budget cuts, faculty salaries
rose an average of 4 percent in 1992-93.
Ann Fletcher, a staff associate for facul

ty affairs with the Provost's office, said
"there are a whole lot of institutions repre
senting a very broad range" incorporated
into the national average. As a top univer
sity, Stanford is naturally at the higher
end of that range, she said.
One reason for the higher-than-average
numbers here may be the rivalry between
Stanford and other similar institutions for
top professors, Fletcher added. To lure
good faculty members, the University
must offer them a salary comparable to
what they would receive at other schools.
A look at the faculty salaries of Stan
ford's competitors reveals similarly high
numbers. The average professor receives
$96,500 at Harvard, $92,700 at Princeton,
and $90,200 at Yale. Professors at Berke
ley receive an average of $79,800, higher
than the $63,250 average salary at other
public universities.
In 1994-95, faculty salaries will also in
crease an average of 4 percent and staff
salaries will rise an average of 3.3 per
cent.
