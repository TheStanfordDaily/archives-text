## Gymnastics looks for NCAA championship repeat 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The only meet that counts . . .
This is the way the Stanford
men's gymnastics team is think
ing about this weekend's NCAA
Finals in Albuquerque, N.M.
While this competition may
be the culmination of the entire
season, Stanford's outcome will
only be determined by its per
formances over Friday and Sat
urday night. An outcome which
it hopes will be a repeat nation
al championship.
The Cardinal will fight in
defense of its 1992 NCAA title
as it takes on fellow Western
Regional qualifiers Nebraska
and Oklahoma along with Ohio
State, Illinois and Minnesota
from the East.
Stanford earned a spot in the
finals with its second-place fin
ish to Nebraska in the Western
Regionals two weeks ago in
Oklahoma. The meet cost the
squad dearly, however, when
junior co-captain Mark Booth
tore his achilles tendon while
performing a tumbling pass.
While Booth's contribution
as an all-around competitor will
be missed, the team is trying
not to let his absence affect its
overall competition.
"I was planning on someone
maybe getting hurt along the
way," said coach Sadao Hama
da. "Certainly neither the team
nor I really have to panic about
it."
Hamada is counting on

'Our intensity and con
sistency are both
really up right now. We
have been hitting real
ly good sets in prac
tice and that's where
you win the meet.'

junior Chris Sey and freshman
Andrew Manson, both of whom
have been out this season with
injuries, to step in for Booth.
The Cardinal will be led by
senior co-captain Jair Lynch, who
will look to improve his fifth
place all-around finish in the
Western Regionals. Last year,
Lynch captured the NCAA high
bar title and earned All-America
honors in five events. He will be
hoping to best his all-around
record of 59.025, which he earned
in last year's team final.
An experienced NCAA com
petitor, Lynch should set the
pace this weekend. He main
tains an optimistic attitude
going into the meet.
"Our intensity and consisten
cy are both really up right now,"
Lynch said. "We have been hit
ting really good sets in practice
and that's where you win the
meet."
Sophomore Jing-Wei Liang is

also slated to compete in all six
events, yet is still recovering
from an ankle injury which could
keep him out of the floor compe
tition. Liang tied for first in the
Regionals on the parallel bars
with 9.75 and tied for second on
the rings with the same score.
"The biggest challenge for
me will be dealing with my
ankle and how it affects my per
formance," Liang said. "If it
hurts I'll still need to go
through; everyone on the team
has some sort of problem. If we
are tough enough, we can do it."
Lynch and Liang will be
joined by senior Jeff Bender in
the all-around competition. In
last year's NCAA Finals, Ben
der's high bar performance was
the routine which secured the
team title for Stanford.
Senior Shawn Adamek will
add depth to the Cardinal squad
on the pommel horse and the
parallel bars, along with junior
Jason Cohen, who is expected to
perform on the rings, vault,
floor and high bar.
Hamada is also counting on
sophomore Josh Stein to boost
the team score as he competes
on all events but the high bar.
Junior Aaron Kushner, expect
ed to compete on the floor, pom
mel horse and vault, rounds out
the Cardinal lineup.
"As long as my big guns —
Liang, Lynch and Bender —
perform to their potential, we'll
be fine," Hamada said. "The
number four, five and six gym
nasts just have to lead them up

to those high scores."
Hamada anticipates that
Nebraska will be Stanford's
biggest threat. The Regionals
ended with the Cornhuskers
accumulating only six misses to
the Cardinal's total of 14. He
hopes the past two weeks of
intense practices will lead to
fewer mistakes this weekend.
"We can afford to miss one
routine per event,"he said. "But
we'll pretty much be thinking
about going six for six."

The team anticipates the first
night of preliminary competi
tion to be the toughest of the
two days because of the scoring
system. Friday's base score of
9.50 will drop on Saturday to
9.00, which puts Stanford at an
advantage on the second night.
With a lower starting score,
the Cardinal will have more
room to capitalize on its high
level of difficulty, since difficul
ty will be factored into the judg
ing, along with execution.

Hamada believes Stanford will
have a four-point advantage
over Nebraska Saturday night
based on its repertoire of more
challenging skills.
"After the last meet, Sadao
not only told us we were the bet
ter team, he proved it to us by
breaking down the numbers,"
Lynch said.
"As long as we get through
Friday night, the emotions will
be there on Saturday," he
added.
