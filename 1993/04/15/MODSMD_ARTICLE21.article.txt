# Penguins' streak ends with 6-6 tie
## 
### 
(AP) — Now that the New
Jersey Devils have ended the
longest winning streak in NHL
history, they'd be delighted to
not have another crack at the
Pittsburgh Penguins — at least
for a while.
"I don't think there is any
one in the league, if they had
their choice, that wants to play
Pittsburgh, knowing what
they've done over the past few
years," New Jersey's Claude
Lemieux said after the Devils
ended the Penguins' 17-game
winning streak with a 6-6 tie
Wednesday night.
But Lemieux says the Devils,
who will clinch third place in
the Patrick Division — and
avoid a first-round playoff

meeting with two-time defend
ing Stanley Cup champion
Pittsburgh — with a point Fri
day night, shouldn't feel inferi
or to the Penguins.
"There's no doubt in my
mind we can beat them if we
play good hockey," he said.
They didn't because an unre
lated Lemieux — Mario, who
came back to score two goals
after being injured early in the
game — and Joe Mullen refused
to lose.
"We all knew we wanted to
keep it alive if we could," said
Mullen, whose 33rd goal, with
66 seconds remaining in the
third period, salvaged the tie.
"The most important is we
always go out to win anyway. It
doesn't matter if there is a streak
on the line."
Mario Lemieux sent the puck
behind the net to Jaromir Jagr
and he found Mullen all alone to
the left of goalie Craig Billington
for a shot between the pads.
Mario Lemieux, who missed
part of the season with
Hodgkin's disease, gave his

teammates some anxious
moments 90 seconds into the
game when he was cross-checked
by Scott Pellerin and seemingly
hurt his left leg.
After two minutes on the ice,
Lemieux got to his feet and
played the rest of the game. His
short-handed, breakaway goal at
12:40 of the second period gave
Pittsburgh a 5-4 lead. It was his
69th goal of the season.
Meanwhile, the New York
Islanders, who need a victory at
home in the season-finale against

the Devils to avoid the Penguins
in the opening round, have a so
what approach to the playoffs —
be their opponent Pittsburgh or
second-place Washington.
"To get out of our division,
the road still goes through Pitts
burgh," Ray Ferraro said after
the Islanders lost 5-4 in overtime
at Hartford. "Let's face it. . . it's
going to take a solid effort to
advance no matter who we play
and I'd rather be where we are
(going to the playoffs) than like a
lot of other clubs."
