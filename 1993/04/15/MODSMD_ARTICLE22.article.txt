# Baseball season boring? Not this year!
## 
### 
I'm doing it again. When foot
ball season rolled around, I
couldn't get enough of the IM
"touch" variety, and wasted
hours of valuable Poli Sci 171
studying time immersed in the
Nintendo Tecmo Bowl subcul
ture. Those weren't just anony
mous blips of light on my TV
screen. They were the world
champion Tampa Bay Bucca
neers.
Then basketball season start
ed, and I immediately trotted out
to the courts to work on my left
handed dribble, my "Time-Out
For Tuition" half-court shot, and
my world-famous, patented
"three-point hook." Hey, at least
it hits the backboard now.
With spring upon us, however,
my thoughts have turned to base
ball. Yes, the annual rite of
spring, the sporting event that
tells me there are only eight
weeks left in the quarter and I can
spend them all getting a tan. Ah,
the sun. The dusty basepaths.

The crack of the bat. The spitting.
I'll admit it, I can't figure out
how I can go from the frenzy of
the Final Four to a sport where
the pla>ers just stand around
most of the time. Maybe I've just
given into the fascist propaganda
mechanism designed to enforce
servility to a capitalist regime.
Maybe it's the hot dogs.
But baseball is not just back
this year, it's actually interesting.
For once, Stanford isn't dominat
ing every Six-Pac opponent that
comes visiting at Sunken Dia
mond. The Giants are home to
stay and have a new manager, a

new owner, a new PA announcer,
a refurbished stadium and a guy
named Bonds. Florida and Col
orado have teams, and now, so
does George Steinbrenner.
Things are hopping. To wit:
• The good news is that the
Cardinal is 1.7.-J.3. jaftei; two more
wins courtesy of Willie Adams and
Andrew Lorraine. The bad news
is that Adams and Lorraine need
to rest sometime. Stanford needs
a solid third starting pitcher
badly, or Dusty Allen and compa
ny are going to have to score 20
runs a game. Two out of three
ain't bad, but Stanford won't get
to the Collegiate World Series on
Mark Marquess' good looks alone.
At least I don't think they will.
• History was made at Candle
stick Park this week as the Flori
da Marlins played their first
series against the Giants, the
Giants played their first home
games, the first female announcer
announced her first game and
Barry Bonds rounded his first

first base after his first home run
in his first home game in his first
at-bat as a Giant.
Whoa. Better switch to the
decaf.
• And George Steinbrenner is
back at the helm of the New York
Yankees. Yay. Whoopie. Just
when my favorite team looks like
it might be good, Steinbrenner
sucks all the winning drive and
fun out of the game like the
human black hole of festering
despair that he is.
Can you tell I'm from New
York?
Nevertheless, baseball, like
those Barney the Dinosaur com
mercials, springs eternal, and you
can bet that this quarter (13
units, 5 P/NC) I'll be out at the
ballpark. Sunken Diamond is,
without question, a place every
Stanford student should visit at
least once, and the games in the
next few weeks will likely decide
