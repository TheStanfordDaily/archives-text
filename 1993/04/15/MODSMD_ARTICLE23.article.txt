OK, so it's your turn in your local
women's gymnastics Rotisserie
draft, and the following two names
come up.
"Jene Elzie — Sophomore.
Scored 9.85 in 1993 NCAA West
ern Regional uneven bars competi
tion, tying Hillary Anderson for
top spot. Holds Stanford all-time

record in uneven bars and top-five
all-time Stanford all-around
marks. Second-team Ail-American
last year. Nowhere to go but up."
"Hillary Anderson — Fresh
man. Scored 9.85 in 1993 NCAA
Western Regional uneven bars
competition, tying Jene Elzie for
first place. Owns silver medal from
1991 Pan-American Games on
bars, as well as team gold. Holds
Stanford all-time record in balance

beam. Nowhere to go but up."
Who do you pick?
Elzie and Anderson, the Cardi
nal's dynamic duo, will begin their
quest to become 1993 Ail-Ameri
cans on uneven bars tonight in
Corvallis, Ore. The top-eight fin
ishers will be declared first-team
All-Americans and will compete on
Saturday for the national champi
onship. Numbers nine through 16
win second-team honors.

Elzie was with the Cardinal last
year when it went to gymnastics'
big dance and finished 10th, and as
for Anderson, well, if the Pan-Am
Games don't prepare you for pres
sure, nothing will.
Neither had such lofty dreams
when she started in the sport.
Although they both first hit the
mat around the time Nadia
Comenici was dazzling the world
and inspiring little girls every
where to jump on balance beams,
neither Stanford superstar has a
story of a Moses leading her to the
promised land of gymnastics.
"My family moved to the Bay
Area from New York when I was
three," Elzie recounted. "There
were no kids around at all when I
was little, so my mom put me in a
(gymnastics) program at the Y
because I had a lot of extra energy.
I was really hyper as a kid."
Anderson and Elzie have very
distinctive performing styles,
which is especially apparent on
bars. Although they do virtually
the same routine, it can be hard to
tell. Elzie is 5-foot-6, tall for a gym
nast, and very strong. Her height
makes her routine look very delib
erate, as if she is convincing the
bars with her strength that it
would be a bad idea if they weren't
where they were supposed to be at
all times.
In contrast, Anderson is a more
standard 5-2, and looks like a gib
bon playing at the zoo as she
zooms through her routine.
Greenwood says that contrast
carries over to other events.
Anderson is much more of a
finesse athlete. "She's such a
stylish gymnast" he said, adding
wonderingly, "she points her toes
when she walks."
What Greenwood admires most
about Elzie is her ability to com

pete. "She works hard in practice,
but she's that much better in a
meet. When she's had time to pre
pare, she's unbeatable."
The excitement of collegiate
gymnastics gave Anderson a bit of
culture shock. "It took a while to get
used to competing with a team," she
said. "In high school, I was always
the only one competing, so I learned
to block others out."
When her dorm, Larkin,
screamed crazily for everything
she did at her first home meet, it
threw her a bit. "I had to prove to
them that I'm really good," she
continued. "After the meet, they
had flowers and told me, 'Hillary,
you should have gotten a 10.00 on
everything,' even though I fell. I
learned to love seeing them there."

Elzie has adjusted to the college
level in a different way, becoming
more technically proficient. "Gym
nastics is a sport that, when you
get into college, you've already
learned a lot; here, you refine your
skills," she said.
Her coach thinks she's done a
great job. "Jene has really emerged.
She was power-oriented, not really a
finesse gymnast, and she's really
cleaned it up," Greenwood said.
Elzie's power still wows the fans
and judges, but it has a downside, too.
Her strength puts a lot more strain on
her body parts, and she only competed
in all-around twice this year because of
nagging injuries. After the national
competition, she said she has only one
