# 'Blank Slate' members get threatening calls
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
At least two members of "A
Blank Slate" received threaten
ing phone messages last night
warning them to "watch your
back" and withdraw from the
Council of Presidents race.
Slate member Jon Previtali
reported the anonymous threat
on his answering machine to
Stanford Police at about 10:30
p.m., a few minutes after he
replayed the message.
The anonymous caller, speak
ing with a slight Southern accent,
accused Previtali and his slate of
being "immoral" and "making fun
of the whole political process at
Stanford."
Previtali guessed the caller's
complaint about immorality may
have referred to his slate's naked
run through Flicks Sunday night.
"Maybe he's pissed off about how
we streaked at a G-rated movie,"
he said.
According to Stanford Police
officer Alan James, who respond
ed to Previtali's call, telephone
threats are not extremely unusual
at Stanford, and don't tend to be

serious. However, James did take
Previtali's tape as possible evi
dence in case the harassment
escalates.
A similar message, apparent
ly from the same caller, was left
on slate member Jeremy Nel
son's answering machine. "This
is a well-wisher call. . . you guys
are being all immoral and people
are very angry. ... I suggest
that you retract your nomina
tion. . . . This is just a warning.
Be careful."
Previtali said the calls may just
be a prank, but added, "It's just
kind of scary."
He said he would have consid
ered dropping out of the COP race
if he had received the call before
the election began yesterday.
Today is the last day of voting.
"We don't want to risk our
lives," Previtali said.
James advised Previtali to have
the other slate members report
any similar messages they might
receive to the police. The other
slate members were not in their
rooms at the time Previtali
received his call, and it is
unknown whether they received
similar calls.
