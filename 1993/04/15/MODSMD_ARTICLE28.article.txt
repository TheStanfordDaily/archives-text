# Panel blasts military gay ban
## Speakers call for tolerance toward homosexual soldiers 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Three homosexual members of the military
spoke to a crowd of about 70 in Branner lounge
last night, calling for tolerance toward gay and
lesbian soldiers and sailors.
The speakers — a retired army sergeant and
two naval officers, including Stanford student Zoe
Dunning — expressed frustration at the military
and hope that the gay ban would be lifted by the
Clinton administration.
The military today "is teaching that you can
call people faggots, that it's OK," said Keith
Meinhold, a Naval officer who is openly gay.
But he added that the military is a valuable
organization, and lauded those fighting the
ban.
"This is the start of a new civil-rights move
ment in this country, or maybe the continuation
of an old one," Meinhold said.
Perry Watkins, a retired sergeant first class
who was openly gay for his entire 21 years in the
Army, also urged President Clinton to repeal the
ban.
"All it takes is the guts to sign the order,"
Watkins said, adding that good soldiers will then
follow the order even if they disagree with it per
sonally.
While the panelists said they thought the ban
should be lifted, there was little optimism

expressed about the likelihood of overturning the
ban.
"I'm really not sure what's going to happen,"
said Dunning, a second-year student at the Busi
ness School who publicly announced she was a
lesbian in January. Dunning said, however, that
she fears the ban will not be lifted.
To promote tolerance, both Dunning and Mein
hold encouraged homosexuals already in the mili
tary to come out of the closet.
"Those who stay in the closet are only putting
the nails in our coffin," Dunning said.
While she said she was not trying to pres
sure people to admit their homosexuality
before they are ready, Dunning added that "if
you're not part of the solution, you're part of
the problem."
Dunning pointed out that there are already
many homosexuals in the military, and that the
military has not collapsed because of it.
Indeed, Meinhold said that he has had only a
few small problems at his job since he announced
that he is gay.
And while both Dunning and Watkins told sto
ries of serious harassment they had received
because of their sexual orientation, Watkins said
he also found encouragement from some of his
fellow soldiers.
"I had a family in the barracks," he said. "I had
the support of the military family that I had to
create, that I had to reach out to."
