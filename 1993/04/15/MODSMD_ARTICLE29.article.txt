For the second time in less
than two weeks, police have
arrested Stanford employee
Jose Meraz for bicycle theft
after finding a bike in his car.
Meraz was apprehended on
Tuesday and charged with
stealing a mountain bike from
Escondido Village, Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said.
When Palo Alto Police pulled
over Meraz's car on Embar
cadero Road at 1:30 p.m.,
Niemeyer said the suspect
sprinted away. After officers
caught up with Meraz they
found a bicycle valued at $100
in his vehicle, he said.
On April 3, Meraz was
arrested for stealing a bicycle
from Governor's Corner.
According to Niemeyer, he has
also confessed to stealing
another bicycle in December

1992.
Niemeyer said Meraz is
"back in the bucket," and is
being held in North County Jail
on petty theft charges.
In other bike theft news, Stan
ford Police are still investigating
a husband-and-wife team who
allegedly stole two bicycles from
campus before spring break.
A student, who saw the pair
loading bikes into a van, wrote
down the license plate number
on his hand and notified police,
Niemeyer said.
When police followed the van
to Hillsborough and contacted
the two suspects at their home
they found the two bikes in the
couple's possession.
People are "literally hauling
[bicycles] away in trucks," he
said.
The two individuals have not
yet been arrested or charged
with theft, but police are
attempting to have witnesses
identify photos of the suspects.
