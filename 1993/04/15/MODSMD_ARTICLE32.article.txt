Did "Unforgiven" deserve Best
Picture? Wasn't it a boring,
overlong western? Didn't we
had more fun watching the court
room pyrotechnics of "A Few Good
Men," or the twists and turns of "The
Crying Game?"
No. What's more daring about
"Unforgiven" is the way it frustrates
our bloodlust. We go into the film ex
pecting to see a bru-

tal, yet honorable
Clint kill hundreds
of bad guys. But we
get a filmic thesis on

violence and its relationship to the
mythic West instead.
The film opens with a cowpoke
:arving up the face of a prostitute who
aughed at the size of his penis. Little
Bill, the local assassin-turned-sheriff,
settles the matter non-violently: he
orders the cowpoke and his partner
jive some of their horses to the
whorehouse owner.
The guilty man's partner offers his
>est horse to the victim. But the prosti
utes, insulted, drive them both away
-vith a barrage of stones while the vic
:im looks on silently. "Just because they
ride us like horses," says one, "doesn't
mean they can treat us like one." So
they pool their money and put a price
on the two cowpokes' heads.
We're barely 30 minutes into the
film, but already Eastwood's blurred
the line between right and wrong. Do
we side with the women who are out
for brutal frontier justice? Or the man
who tries to make amends?
Into this mix comes Eastwood's
Man With A Name, retired gunfight
er William Munny. Struggling to raise
two children alone, he accepts an offer
to go after the prostitutes' bounty.
He says he's only doing it for his
children's future. When his old part
ner-in-crime Ned asks him if he's wor
ried about falling back into his old ways,
he replies, "I ain't like that no more."

He's lying. Munny's the meanest
gunfighter who ever lived—a killer of
men, women and children. When
Ned can't bring himself to shoot one
of the unsuspecting cowpokes from
the top of a ravine, Munny grabs the
rifle and fires.
The scene encapsulates Eastwood's
demythification of the West. The cow
poke's been hit in the gut. We're
forced to listen to him

scream as he slowly
bleeds to death. And
he was the innocent
one. He didn't de-

serve to die.
But as Munny says, "Deserve's got
nothin' to do with it."
We don't even deserve a traditional
heroic western. The cowboys all get
their courage from bottles of Jack
Daniels. The other cowpoke gets killed
in an outhouse. And Ned abandons the
mission, only to be caught, whipped to
death by Little Bill, then mounted in an
open coffin outside the whorehouse.
Eastwood frustrates us all the way
to the climax — the whorehouse is so
darkly lit that we can barely see the ac
tion. A drunk Munny enters with a
shotgun, motions the deputies to step
away from the owner, then shoots him
down. When Little Bill protests that
the man was unarmed, Munny says,
"He should have armed himself." He
lets the other men clear out through
the back. Then he kills Little Bill.
More than two hours into the film,
Clint's finally cut loose. So why aren't
we satisfied?
That's the point. "Unforgiven"
isn't a violent film — it's a film about
violence. Eastwood simply refuses to
show us what we came for. No glori
ous shootouts here. Instead, he
shows us exactly what it means to kill
someone. And that may come as a
shock to a generation raised on
"Lethal Weapon" sequels.
It ain't pretty.■
