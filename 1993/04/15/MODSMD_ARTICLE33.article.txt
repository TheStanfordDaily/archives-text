# Aspiring dancer
## Former Urban Studies administrator launches HER SECOND SF PERFORMANCE 
### Christina Lepnis 
Where might you find a local perfor
mance artist about to make her piv
otal San Francisco debut? Installed
at the front desk in Stanford's Department of
Urban Studies, perhaps?
Until recently, that's exactly where dance
theater artist Nina Farana was expending the
non-kinetic half of her energies — for all of 11
years. Now, this former "Urbs" administrator
and Stanford graduate is heading out to the
Cowell Theater in San Francisco, where on
April 16 she will launch a second performance
by Inside Out Arts, the theatrical company she
founded last year and also directs.
Farana's brand of theater is an "event" of
movement, poetry, prose, music and unex
pected scenic projections that include suspen
sion bridges, molten steel, stilettos, pigeons,
black boots, grids, postage stamps, buckshot
and a steno pad.
To say that Farana's theatrical style both
harmoniously and disconcertingly blends nu
merous art forms only begins to describe the
contradictions that are the lifeblood of her
work. Although she reveres traditional aesthet
ics, she is also attracted to dissonance, which,
says Farana, adorns some of her work like "gar
goyles on churches."
"It's all drawn out of my own experience,"
Farana reveals, "which includes pain, horror,
shock, anxiety, confusion. I want to express it
because being in those places in a conscious
way has also shown me something greater than
that pain. That's why I do art — to get that
point across."
The personal challenges Farana obviously
has faced go unnamed, at her request, but their
effects seem to linger in her quiet intensity. Her
dark features and soft-spoken manner height
en the mystery in which she cloaks herself.
A colorful tumble of congratulatory gifts
from friends decorated one corner of
Palo Alto's Cubberley Theater foyer last
July when Farana, enabled by a Neighborhood
Arts Fund grant from the San Mateo Commu
nity Foundation, first presented her jointly
conceived work, "The Windows The Waves,"
before an audience. The occasion seemed not
unlike a nuptial reception.
Indeed, Farana had transformed herself
into a bride of sorts. After many years of re
calcitrant dance injuries, funding impedi
ments and clerical-job doldrums, she was fi
nally marrying into the province of artistic
recognition.
Audience members rose to their feet that
evening, slinging flowers onto the stage when
Farana took her bows. She was astonished —
even somewhat numbed — by this clamorous
public response. "It was a surprise, and I think
that's the great thing about the work," explains
Farana. "You learn to trust surprise, and that
teaches you how to do life better."
With her interpretation of Virginia Woolf s
novel "The Waves," which makes equal use of
movement, poetic readings and lighting ef
fects, Farana seeded her reputation as an in
ventor of dramatically original and darkly ru
minative images. Thanks to the private dona
tions she solicited through a concerted
fundraising drive for Inside Out Arts, Farana is
able to bring "The Windows The Waves" back
for a splashy City premiere.

"The Windows," a collection of five pieces
and program partner to "The Waves," is a psy
chological and spacial study of the multiple di
mensions of solitude — though you'll never
hear Farana define it that way. She'd rather be
enigmatic about the content of her works than
offer explanations liable to limit or obstruct
the individual imaginations in her audience.
"These (pieces) are like momentarily illu
minated windows in a darkened house," ob
serves local writer Christie Cochrell. "Drawn
to look in, we see meticulously detailed scenes,
fixed in a frame."
Cochrell goes on to remark that a perturb
ing quality settles over the first three composi
tions — "A Thousand Fans," "Bend" and"The
Box" — as "Farana's face is hidden by a Chi
nese hat, an eyeless mask, hands, the geometric
angles of her hair. Then, finally, in 'Pedal

Point,' it is starkly visible, beautiful and com
pelling, and becomes the focal point of the
tableau."
Santa Clara Arts Council administrator Eu
genia Haney characterizes Farana's stage per
sona as "very inwardly focused," although not
in a narcissistic vein. Farana's internalizations,
says Haney, are "highly theatrical" and cou
pled "with intriguing visual images."
Farana's collaborator in this performance
collage is musician/ composer Atthys
Gage, Inside Out's other performing
member (a team of production artists com
pletes the company roster). Using keyboards,
viola, harmonica, bass and acoustic guitars, as
well as his voice, Gage not only accompanies
Farana, he augments her.
Weaving together the disparate elements

of their program required hundreds of hours
of improvisational rehearsals, which Farana
describes as "a real exchange. Atthys began
to build stuff based on what he thought was
my movement style, and I adapted my form
to fit his style." Their strong creative rapport
needed time to brew, however. Farana recalls
that "in the very first rehearsal I sat there
with my back to him the whole time — I was
so shy."
Farana and Gage broadly experimented
with the theme of isolation, which figures
prominently in their lives as both people and
artists. "We laugh about the dementia of it,"
relates Farana. "The dark rooms, the attics, the
dusty hallways — we went into those places (to
rehearse together) because we were both com
ing from our own isolated little rooms where
we had spent years by ourselves, working with
nobody else. We played with that (withdraw
al), tried to find some commonality, some
beauty in it. We tried to make it into something
more than just isolation."
Inga Weiss, a senior lecturer emeritus in
Dance at Stanford, whom Farana names as her
most inspiring teacher, describes the
Farana/Gage duo as "possessed on stage. It is a
magical intercourse."
Since completing half of Stanford's M.A.
Program in dance education roughly 10
years ago, Farana has not pursued any
further formal dance training. Rather, she has
been guiding her own movement develop
ment, preferring the possibilities of floor work,
a common component of modern-dance tech
niques. She also studied aikido with Frank
Doran at Stanford for two years.
Indoor roller-skating was another expres
sive outlet for Farana, which she reveled in for
years, despite regularly sustaining cuts and
bruises from jolting encounters with crazed,
careening adolescent bodies. Although she was
particularly keen on the sensation of moving in
spirals, the perils of rink skating finally forced
her to abandon the activity.
Wheeling around in an empty parking lot
was never a viable alternative for her. "Indoors
you feel the space and it reverberates with you,
but outside you're competing with the sky and
trees," Farana explains.
Although attentive to the such physical as
pects in her art, Farana refuses to categorize
dance as an activity of motion. "It's all about
life," she stresses, "and the body is just the con
tainer we live through. Dance to me is not just
physical — it's emotional, psychological and
spiritual. And so I've involved myself in many
therapies: movement therapy, dance therapy,
psychotherapy."
Looking back, Farana admits her passion
for dance, which surfaced in high school, was
never driven by grandiose dreams of one day
blossoming into a professional performer. "It
just hit me, and I didn't know why," she re
flects. "It directed my life. It was really sur
vival." ■

Inside Out Arts will present "The Windows
The Waves" on Friday, April 16 at 8 p.m. at
San Francisco's Cowell Theater, located on the
waterfront at Fort Mason. General admission
tickets are $12, $10 for students and seniors,
and are available at the door.

Cowell Theater in San Francisco, where on
April 16 she will launch a second performance
by Inside Out Arts, the theatrical company she
founded last year and also directs.
Farana's brand of theater is an "event" of
movement, poetry, prose, music and unex
pected scenic projections that include suspen
sion bridges, molten steel, stilettos, pigeons,
black boots, grids, postage stamps, buckshot
and a steno pad.
To say that Farana's theatrical style both
harmoniously and disconcertingly blends nu
merous art forms only begins to describe the
contradictions that are the lifeblood of her
work. Although she reveres traditional aesthet
ics, she is also attracted to dissonance, which,
says Farana, adorns some of her work like "gar
goyles on churches."
"It's all drawn out of my own experience,"
Farana reveals, "which includes pain, horror,
shock, anxiety, confusion. I want to express it
because being in those places in a conscious
way has also shown me something greater than
that pain. That's why I do art — to get that
point across."
The personal challenges Farana obviously
has faced go unnamed, at her request, but their
effects seem to linger in her quiet intensity. Her
dark features and soft-spoken manner height
en the mystery in which she cloaks herself.
A colorful tumble of congratulatory gifts
from friends decorated one corner of
Palo Alto's Cubberley Theater foyer last
July when Farana, enabled by a Neighborhood
Arts Fund grant from the San Mateo Commu
nity Foundation, first presented her jointly
conceived work, "The Windows The Waves,"
before an audience. The occasion seemed not
unlike a nuptial reception.
Indeed, Farana had transformed herself
into a bride of sorts. After many years of re
calcitrant dance injuries, funding impedi
ments and clerical-job doldrums, she was fi
nally marrying into the province of artistic
recognition.
Audience members rose to their feet that
evening, slinging flowers onto the stage when
Farana took her bows. She was astonished —
even somewhat numbed — by this clamorous
public response. "It was a surprise, and I think
that's the great thing about the work," explains
Farana. "You learn to trust surprise, and that
teaches you how to do life better."
With her interpretation of Virginia Woolf s
novel "The Waves," which makes equal use of
movement, poetic readings and lighting ef
fects, Farana seeded her reputation as an in
ventor of dramatically original and darkly ru
minative images. Thanks to the private dona
tions she solicited through a concerted
fundraising drive for Inside Out Arts, Farana is
able to bring "The Windows The Waves" back
for a splashy City premiere.

"The Windows," a collection of five pieces
and program partner to "The Waves," is a psy
chological and spacial study of the multiple di
mensions of solitude — though you'll never
hear Farana define it that way. She'd rather be
enigmatic about the content of her works than
offer explanations liable to limit or obstruct
the individual imaginations in her audience.
"These (pieces) are like momentarily illu
minated windows in a darkened house," ob
serves local writer Christie Cochrell. "Drawn
to look in, we see meticulously detailed scenes,
fixed in a frame."
Cochrell goes on to remark that a perturb
ing quality settles over the first three composi
tions — "A Thousand Fans," "Bend" and"The
Box" — as "Farana's face is hidden by a Chi
nese hat, an eyeless mask, hands, the geometric
angles of her hair. Then, finally, in 'Pedal

Point,' it is starkly visible, beautiful and com
pelling, and becomes the focal point of the
tableau."
Santa Clara Arts Council administrator Eu
genia Haney characterizes Farana's stage per
sona as "very inwardly focused," although not
in a narcissistic vein. Farana's internalizations,
says Haney, are "highly theatrical" and cou
pled "with intriguing visual images."
Farana's collaborator in this performance
collage is musician/ composer Atthys
Gage, Inside Out's other performing
member (a team of production artists com
pletes the company roster). Using keyboards,
viola, harmonica, bass and acoustic guitars, as
well as his voice, Gage not only accompanies
Farana, he augments her.
Weaving together the disparate elements

of their program required hundreds of hours
of improvisational rehearsals, which Farana
describes as "a real exchange. Atthys began
to build stuff based on what he thought was
my movement style, and I adapted my form
to fit his style." Their strong creative rapport
needed time to brew, however. Farana recalls
that "in the very first rehearsal I sat there
with my back to him the whole time — I was
so shy."
Farana and Gage broadly experimented
with the theme of isolation, which figures
prominently in their lives as both people and
artists. "We laugh about the dementia of it,"
relates Farana. "The dark rooms, the attics, the
dusty hallways — we went into those places (to
rehearse together) because we were both com
ing from our own isolated little rooms where
we had spent years by ourselves, working with
nobody else. We played with that (withdraw
al), tried to find some commonality, some
beauty in it. We tried to make it into something
more than just isolation."
Inga Weiss, a senior lecturer emeritus in
Dance at Stanford, whom Farana names as her
most inspiring teacher, describes the
Farana/Gage duo as "possessed on stage. It is a
magical intercourse."
Since completing half of Stanford's M.A.
Program in dance education roughly 10
years ago, Farana has not pursued any
further formal dance training. Rather, she has
been guiding her own movement develop
ment, preferring the possibilities of floor work,
a common component of modern-dance tech
niques. She also studied aikido with Frank
Doran at Stanford for two years.
Indoor roller-skating was another expres
sive outlet for Farana, which she reveled in for
years, despite regularly sustaining cuts and
bruises from jolting encounters with crazed,
careening adolescent bodies. Although she was
particularly keen on the sensation of moving in
spirals, the perils of rink skating finally forced
her to abandon the activity.
Wheeling around in an empty parking lot
was never a viable alternative for her. "Indoors
you feel the space and it reverberates with you,
but outside you're competing with the sky and
trees," Farana explains.
Although attentive to the such physical as
pects in her art, Farana refuses to categorize
dance as an activity of motion. "It's all about
life," she stresses, "and the body is just the con
tainer we live through. Dance to me is not just
physical — it's emotional, psychological and
spiritual. And so I've involved myself in many
therapies: movement therapy, dance therapy,
psychotherapy."
Looking back, Farana admits her passion
for dance, which surfaced in high school, was
never driven by grandiose dreams of one day
blossoming into a professional performer. "It
just hit me, and I didn't know why," she re
flects. "It directed my life. It was really sur
vival." ■

Inside Out Arts will present "The Windows
The Waves" on Friday, April 16 at 8 p.m. at
San Francisco's Cowell Theater, located on the
waterfront at Fort Mason. General admission
tickets are $12, $10 for students and seniors,
and are available at the door.

Where might you find a local perfor
mance artist about to make her piv
otal San Francisco debut? Installed
at the front desk in Stanford's Department of
Urban Studies, perhaps?
Until recently, that's exactly where dance
theater artist Nina Farana was expending the
non-kinetic half of her energies — for all of 11
years. Now, this former "Urbs" administrator
and Stanford graduate is heading out to the
Cowell Theater in San Francisco, where on
April 16 she will launch a second performance
by Inside Out Arts, the theatrical company she
