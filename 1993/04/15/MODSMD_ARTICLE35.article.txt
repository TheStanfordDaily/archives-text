# dressin'on the wild side

Lime polyester house-dresses, furry brown robes, multi
colored Beach Boys T-shirts.... Who said you could buy
anything at the Stanford Shopping Mall? You'd be hard
pressed to find these articles of clothing, much less for under two
bucks a piece.
For the handful of Stanford students who dare to wear syn
thetic material and colors not found in nature, the Mall is not
the shopping mecca it's made up to be. They'd much prefer "Fa
vors" in Redwood City, "Thrift City" in San Carlos, or the
Goodwill in San Mateo.
San Mateo? Wouldn't the Goodwill in Palo Alto be more
convenient?
"The Goodwill in Palo Alto sucks because it's yuppie cloth
ing at yuppie prices," says junior Aaron Edsinger. And that's not
what alternative dressing is about.
What is it about then? Why does that girl in lecture wear
cheap go-go boots? Who is the guy in front of the post office in
the bright orange jeans? And what in the world possessed that
person to wear a tapioca velvet jacket?
"I like velvet a lot," says senior John Ott, "it's a really offen
sive material. My tapioca velvet jacket is a God-forsaken piece of
clothing.
"It's a love/hate thing," Ott says,"I can use its power against
others, and I think everyone comes out better in the end."
The power of thrift-store dressing: it can make people laugh,
it can make people wince in disgust, but at Stanford, it mostly
just makes people look twice. In a sea of cotton T-shirts, blue
jeans, shorts and tennis shoes, those who dress a little off the
beaten path are sure to turn some heads.
While Ott claims that fashion faux pas such as his size 14
bowling shoes (he's a size nine) are just "cheap attention-getting
ploys," other "alternative dressers" believe the way they dress
reflects their personal style and beliefs.
"I try to portray that I'm not boring; I'm not normal in the
sense that I'm not apathetic. I'm willing to be different," says se
nior Susana Loza.
"Certainly your way of dressing doesn't say 'I believe in this..
..' But I wouldn't wear a Ralph Lauren sweater, pegged-in jeans
and top-siders, because even though I know people who dress
like that and are liberal, you wouldn't know by just looking at
them," Loza says.
"Clothing is a really simple way to make a statement. I'm very
politically liberal in almost everything, and I think the way I
dress shows that I'm open-minded," she adds.
"I used to be so shy," senior Molly McCall says. "Then some
time in the seventh grade a need arose to not be like everybody
else I used to have a pair of multi-colored Converse high
tops [back when no one else had them] and it was really impor
tant for me to wear them.
"I went to a high school that had a lot of snotty people at it. I
tried to purposely distinguish myself, and people used to make
fun of me, so I made myself even more different," she continues.
"Now I could never really be mean to anyone, and that came out
of the way I dressed.
"I used to use [my clothes] to define myself against others,
but now it's just a part of the way I am. It's an important way to
express myself," McCall says.
While Stanford may boast about its multi-cultural atmos
phere, clothing on campus doesn't appear to reflect much di
versity. Look around: the J. Crew stereotype is definitely
rooted in reality. Putting together a distinctive wardrobe
takes an attitude that may not be consistent with Stanford's
way of life.
" 'Alternative' is just a category that the media creates to mar
ket a look," Edsinger says. "Macy's has a 'Grunge' section and a
'Haight' section when there's really no such thing.... It's a lot
more than fashion; it's the mind set of the slacker ideal, a rejec
tion of upwardly-mobile society.
"It's hard to reconcile [with Stanford] because you have to be
rich to go here and the ideal is to reject that part of society. It's
anti-materialism left over from the post-punk era.
"Stanford isn't really representative of what people in their

twenties are wearing today," Edsinger adds. "When you get off
campus and look around, what people here call 'alternative' isn't
alternative after all."
"Most people dress in the most easy and comfortable way,"
McCall says. "But I think other people don't want to spend time
[on clothing] because they're so driven about other things, like
studies or finding jobs.
"I think it's also connected with the way a lot of people at

Want to talk repression? I went to
an all-girl's Catholic high school and
we wore uniforms: long-sleeve,
white, button-down shirts with col

After five days a week of fashion
bondage, my friend Jenny and I
used to go thrifting together on Mel
rose and in Venice Beach. Those
were the days of cheap plastic jew

ond-hand records, smoking in the
parking lot (Jenny inhaled; I didn't),
and lusting after skate-rats with
dyed-black hair (I lusted; Jenny
didn't).
College meant freedom: a place
where we could choose what to wear
every morning. Once our four years
at Immaculate Heart Prison were up,
Jenny went to Art School in the East
Bay and I came to Stanford. And that

Confessions of an ex«alternative wannabe

McCollom and Larlarb, who met when they noticed they were
wearing the same chunky black-and-white checkered shoes,
plan to start a clothing company named "Androgyny."
"Usually there's something I like and can't buy, so I just make
it,"says McCollum, whose favorite materials are corduroy and
terrycloth. "It's really relaxing and it's really cool, because when
I'm done I have this thing and nobody else can get one just like
it."
As advice for Stanford students who want to liven up their
wardrobes, McCollum adds, "Explore outside of Palo Alto.
There are a lot of great thrift stores in Redwood City. But don't
expect to find something every time. You have to go a lot, and
then, maybe on the fifth time, you'll find something you like.
"And if you're in doubt, just buy it because it's only two

bucks," says McCollum.
Dressing with style may take a little time and a little effort, but
it certainly doesn't have to take a lot of money. In a good second
hand store you can buy a whole new outfit for less than a latt6 at
the Coffee House.
"I grew up in a trash-culture scene [in Oklahoma] where
people would ask, 'how much did you pay for that?.... Fifty
cents?! That's way too much,' " says junior Peggy Dunn.
Dunn's wardrobe includes plenty of 25-cent dresses and
shoes, as well as what she considers her best buy, a $ 1 black poly
ester jacket.
"The best thrifting is in the mid-section of the country," she
says. "It's a lot cheaper and less people are looking for things that
are cool.
"The whole idea of thrifting is interesting because people are
deciding for themselves what is fashionable," Dunn says.
Kind of changes your perspective on that sweater on sale for
$30 at The Gap.
And don't think J. Crew sent you that catalogue because they
know you're hard up for mail. They have marketing strategies:
their people come here and observe students jogging around the
lake, making small talk in the Quad, worshipping the sun in
Wilbur Field.
J.Crew knows what we don't like to admit: appearances mat
ter even at Stanford — especially at Stanford.

Now, Melrose is a locale for a Fox

Four years later, Jenny still wears

She's going to make ceramics for a

to wear skirts that show off my legs
and that sometimes I can get my lip
stick to match the color of my

There are only a few things I'd
like to know before I die: Was it me,
or was it Stanford? How did my mom
know? Wasn't there supposed to be
some kind of benefit to selling out?
