Buster Keaton's
spirit survives in
wacky new flick

Benny & Joon

Missed the sneak preview last week? Well,
hip Seattle grunginess meets 1920s slapstick
in "Benny and loon," a little tale of misfit ro
mance that succeeds by playing down the
mush and playing up the scenes of Johnny
Depp acting weird.
The plot is a little ho-hum, but the film's
gentle humor subtly grows on you, raising
the possibility that a comedy about young
adults doesn't require cheap sight gags and
constant complaints about not getting laid.
Benny Pearl, played by Aidan Quinn in all
his blue-eyed hunkiness, is the protective
brother of Joon, his nice but unruly schizo
phrenic sister (Mary Stuart Masterson). Joon
blends Cap'n Crunch with peanut butter,
holds up Seattle traffic wearing a snorkel and
brandishing red paper, and exhibits pyroma
nia. Needless to say, she's quite a handful for
Quinn, whose life consists of caring for her
and working at the body shop.
But all of Joon's malevolence disappears
when Sam (Johnny Depp) arrives for a visit at
the Pearl household. Sam is an illiterate,
near-mute weirdo who cooks up grilled

cheese sandwiches with an iron and attacks
potatoes with tennis rackets.
Johnny Depp once again proves himself a
canny actor who manages to avoid typical
"hot young Hollywood actor" roles. With
only about 60 lines in the film, he manages to
pull off the physical comedy with the requi
site style and bewildered grace — he's about
the only guy bizarre enough to get together
with Joon.
Director Jeremiah Chechik admits to
wholesale plagiarism in "Benny and Joon" —
many of the scenes are direct rip-offs of old
classics — but in this case, imitation is a sin
cere form of flattery. The spirits of Buster
Keaton, Chaplin and Harold Lloyd are un
likely to be troubled. Indeed, it seems that
Chechik and screenwriter Barry Berman in
tend to reveal a new generation to the films of
those screen greats.
Masterson's performance deserves an A
for effort, but overall she comes off as a
movie star pretending to be a schizophrenic.

The problem might lie in the fact that the
film subscribes to a romantic vision of men
tal illness: it's all fun, creativity, wacky weird
ness — along with the occasional psychotic
episode that goes away with medication.
Though this mythic vision of mental ill
ness is a little irritating, Chechik's meticu
lous direction makes it a visual treat. His
camera lingers over such symbolic objects as
doorknobs and keys, which reflect the twin
themes of independence and confinement.
The bold colors showered throughout the
Pearl household and numerous shots
through stained glass add visual juice to this
upbeat film.
Intelligent dialogue also lifts the film
above the morass of other wannabe come
dies, with lines such as, "Having a 800 Radley
moment, are we?" Sure, there are some shaky
moments, but the ship manages to stay afloat
because it conducts itself with restraint and
grace.

'Europa Europa'
director returns
with dark thriller

Olivier Olivier

Olivier was born twice — once two months
premature, his mother Elisabeth says, and
once in a jubilant return from the hospital to a
beautiful old family farmhouse in the country
side outside Paris. That must be why she
smothers him with attention, and why writer
director Agnieszka Holland decided to call her
funny, spooky, fascinating new movie "Olivier
Olivier."
Based on some actual events, the storyline
of Holland's new movie is both more realistic
and more bizarre than her last work, the simi
larly titled "Europa Europa."
One day the 9-year-old Olivier puts on his
favorite Chicago Bulls baseball cap, mounts his
sister's bike and, like Little Red Riding Hood,
sets off to his sick grandmother's house with a
basket of food.
And he disappears without a trace.
But six years later, when a lanky street kid is
brought in to a Paris police station wearing a
red Bulls' cap, the real mystery begins.
Is he Olivier? Or isn't he?
Olivier himself isn't telling, and Gr6goire
Colin plays up Olivier's enigmatic nature deli
ciously. He watches and prowls and drops
hints with a cheshire-cat smile.
In a similarly enigmatic performance, Ma
rina Golovine exudes defiance as Olivier's 17-
year-old sister Nadine. She challenges Olivier's
right to return to the family she has basically
held together by openly questioning his identi
ty. Nadine's intensity does not, however, erase
a certain gentleness that enchants us as much
as it does Olivier.
Among these complicated relationships, Hol
land manages to work in some social commen
tary — Olivier has had an AIDS test since he's
been a hustler. But the film fails in some of its
ideological undercurrents — prejudice is sup
posed to demonstrate innocence, as Nadine con
tinually teases Olivier about being a "homo."
More disturbingly, the film uses sex as the batde
ground of the family's power struggles.
We eventually find out the truth about
Olivier, but even afterwards, the mysteries re
main mysterious. That's what's so tantalizing
about "Olivier Olivier": does reality even mat
ter?
