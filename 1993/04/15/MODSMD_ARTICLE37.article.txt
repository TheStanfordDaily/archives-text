Vanessa Paradis

There's nothing worse than a mediocre
singer suffering from poor production. Noth
ing.
It doesn't take a BAin music to recognize
vocal mediocrity when it's accompanied by
blasd instrumentals tethered to rote break
beats. But trained ears can get shiftless when
that same commonplace crooning is united
with real musicianship.
Case in point: the self-titled release of
French ex-supermodel Vanessa Paradis.

Pulling an ensemble of melodic memorabilia
from his familiar bag of tricks, producer Lenny
Kravitz fathers a medley of alternately funky,
folksy and downright schmaltzy tunes that de
light the ear and relax the mind.
The album begins with "Natural High," a
murky blend of simple guitar chords and
grinding organ riffs perched atop a bouncy bass
and dragging drum cadence. It's the perfect
musical backdrop for Paradis' sound — an
oddly agreeable mixture of Cyndi Lauper and
Diana Ross, rounded out with a hint of French
soul.
Gone from this album are Kravitz's trade
mark Al Green-inspired ballads and the overtly
Hendrix/Zepplin-fashioned guitar licks. Loi
tering just as comfortably, but less psychedeli
cally are Lennon inspired ditties like "I'm wait
ing for the man." Paradis' sultry delivery in
vokes the lyricism of Hendrix's "The Wind
Cries Mary."
Also hanging about: the frighteningly au
thentic Motown sound-alike "Be My Baby,"

and the funk-heavy "Future Song." The for
mer's use of strings, chimes and hushed, yet
forceful percussion, emit a sense of d£ja vu so
overwhelming it leans toward the phantas
magoric. The latter will quickly remind Kravitz
fans of the Mayfield influenced "What Comes
Around Goes Around."
The upbeat '70s ballad "Your Love Has Got a
Handle On My Mind" and the James Brown -
esque instrumental "Paradis" — which sound
and feel like masturbation on producer Kravitz's
part — round out the record's eclecticism.
While "Vanessa Paradis," in all of its retro
pop splendor, is as close to pure listening satis
faction as a '90s Top-40 album is likely to get,
it's still a double-edged sword for the
songstress-in-residence. Lenny's production
suggests that while Paradis' face graces the
cover, she'll play just a small part in the album's
quest for success.
But it's nothing for her to get bent out of
shape about.
