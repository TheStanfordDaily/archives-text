Drummer should
replace 'Less Fat'
with phat sounds

Chris Mars

Sometimes fat adds a little flavor. Former
Replacements' drummer Chris Mars should
have kept this in mind while working on his
second solo album, "75% Less Fat."
About 30 percent of the album is worth
listening to — even replaying. Make that 40,
if you ignore the second-grade lyrics on
some of the tracks. But the rest of the album
places Mars' new effort in the annals of
generic rock 'n' roll mediocrity.
This "bastard of young," whose former
group was one of the demigods of garage
band rock, now succumbs to too many cook
ie-cutter sound-alike tracks.
The first song, "Stuck in Rewind," even
sounds eerily like one of those Eddie Money
songs, especially in the riffs that accompany
Mars as he belts out, "Found sitting lost at a
bar, reminiscing with a deluxe stout."
When he does come up with catchy, stay
in-your-head guitar grooves, Mars also
comes up with lackluster lyrics. While the
lines in "Car Camping" — "I smell a skunk/
There's beer in the trunk/ The fishing is
good/ We'll piss in the woods. .." — cer
tainly aren't profound, they're not even in
sipidly funny. Nor is the gratuitous belch ac
companying yet another line about beer.
However, Mars' attempts at straightfor
ward lyrics do work on a few tracks. "Demo
lition," a brooding, slower song that wallows
in gritty urban depression, showcases the
squandered potential of "Less Fat."
"Nightcap," the last track and the
album's most dramatic departure from
Mars' guitar-driven routine, is a slow, jazzy
instrumental with a prominent clarinet
sound. Maybe it's the best cut because it de
viates so much from the other songs, stand
ing out as a mutant elevator jazz tune on a
resolutely rock album.
But the few good songs on the album
stand out as just that — mutants. The rest of
"Less Fat" lacks musical creativity, as Mars
spreads himself thin, playing all but two of
the instruments on the album. Here, Mars
goes overboard on the rationing and now
seems hungry for a dose of originality. But
then, isn't that what diets are all about?

Mo' 'Bliss' makes
this an album that
you'll die without

P.M. Dawn

When you think hip-hop, you probably
think "slammin' bass lines, hardcore lyrics
and Parental-Advisory stickers." But an
overweight MC and his thinner deejay broth
er are coming straight from Jersey to redefine
your notion of hip-hop.
Their names: Atrell and Jarrett Cordes.
But you might know them better as Prince Be
and DJ Minutemix — the duo called P.M.
Dawn.
The group's debut album, "Of the Heart,
of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Ex
perience" achieved critical and commercial
success by mixing clever samples with hip

hop beats, R&B harmonies and an adult-con
temporary sound.
But hip-hop artists gave them no respect
— their music wasn't street enough. So they
came back strapped with a ballad from the
Boomerang soundtrack, "I'd die without
you."
The song didn't solve their street-credibil
ity problem, but its overwhelming success
made people even hungrier for their next re
lease.
Their new CD, "The Bliss Album" contin
ues to attack the conception of what hip-hop
is. "When Midnight Sighs" seduces us into
believing we're in musical heaven with Prince
Be's soft raps, angelic harmonies and back
ground vocals, accompanied by a soft piano.
Slammin' and funky, "Plastic" answers
those critics who say P.M. Dawn's music isn't
worthy of being called hip-hop.
The track derides suckers who are jealous
of their success with lyrics like "Do you real
ly wanna know what a sellout is?" over a New
lack Swing beat. Prince Be attacks the mike
with the positive aggression of a man on a
mission to change the direction of rap music.
"Looking Through Patient Eyes" is this
album's "Set Adrift On Memory Bliss" — a
sample of George Michael's "Father Figure,"
replaces Spandau Ballet's "True." D] Min
utemix adeptly combines Michael's record
with R&B harmonies, and Prince Be's story
telling-reminiscent rap style makes us sym
pathize with the problems of love.
"Filthy Rich" is another example of P.M.
Dawn's unique musical talent. Unlike the

harsh lyrics and hard hitting rhythms that
symbolize MC battles — like the feud be
tween Kool Moe Dee and LL Cool J — they
use their mellow music to dis KRS-One.
This is a must-buy album for any music
fan. I'm definitely waiting for the next one.

Albums serve up
offbeat lyrics and
music this week

SNIPPETS

THE THE: "Dusk"
"Dusk" is as substantial as the band's name.
Initially multi-faceted and enjoyable, the
album doesn't leave anyone coming back for
more.
You heard it. You got it. Go home.
Refrains like the pathetic "You make me cry
when you look into my eyes/ And see me for
who I really am" are more reminiscent of a
sniveling high-school break-up than a real
artistic outpouring.
The single "Dogs of Lust" received a lot of
airplay, but it's just another happy l> at/worth
less lyrics-song. Tracks like "Sodium Light
Baby" and "Helpline Operator" have poten
tial, but don't expect anything more magical

than a mediocre beat and so-so lyrics.

SHONEN KNIFE: "Let's Knife"
The all-female trio from Japan takes a stab
at their first all-English album, merging their
heavily accented singing with music reminis
cent of the Ramones.
Much of the album's charm lies in the
group's accented voices. The lyrics tend to be
goofy, but they're backed with infectiously
catchy music. Listening to "Flying Jelly At
tack," you're likely to want to sing along about
the joys of eating jelly beans.
The group proves their musical range,
from thrashy pop to '50s pop. With "Let's
Knife," Shonen Knife will probably win over
more fans this side of the Pacific.

ULTRAVIVIDSCENE: "Rev"
Lead vocalist Kurt Ralske makes yet anoth
er foray into the land of psychedelia, but what
he comes up with is more interesting lyrically
than musically. Constant references to death
and sadomasochism have long been part of
Ralske's repertoire. However, the music is so
mellow it becomes bland.
Unfortunately, the music just lacks passion.
And with Ralske's soft, detached vocals, the
music needs to make up for his passivity in
order to live up to the lyrics. It doesn't.

They're funny, they're thrashy, they're perky, they're grungy — they're Shonen Knife, an all-girl trio from Japan preparing to assault
American airwaves with their unique sound.
