# early'80s music a nostalgia trip
## 
### michaei green 
In a malicious attempt to make our age
group feel older than it is, the trend setters
of today have turned our yesterday into a
time of nostalgia.
Like Donalds Trump and Kennedy, the '80s
are becoming a caricature of themselves.
Ripped-shoulder sweatshirts. Rubik's
Cubes. Pac Men. Michael Jackson jackets with
the zippers. They're all comedic now. But

worst of all, people are begin
ning to lash out at the one
pure facet of that precious, im
pressionable era.
Its music.
The fates of those bands are

as varied as their sound. Some
disappeared without a peep,
while others bled and writhed
quite prominently before conced
ing to death on the charts. A few
are even still around to tell the
story of the early '80s. And maybe,
just maybe, they'll come back to
add a tale or two.

One of the most prominent bands of the
early-'Bos era was Culture Club. This
group was big for both style and sound,
giving us songs such as: "Do You Really Want
to Hurt Me," "Miss Me Blind" and everyone's
favorite, "Karma Chameleon."

In 1983, Culture Club won the Grammy
Award for "Best New Artist." In the acceptance
speech for the award, lead singer and popular
eccentric, Boy George commented, "Thank
you America. You've got taste. You've got style,
and you know a good drag queen when you see
one."
Unfortunately, Culture Club didn't honor
their success with solidarity and broke up after
the release of their fourth album "From Luxury
to Heartache."
After struggling with heroin addiction, Boy
George attempted several solo albums. He
recorded under the psuedo-psuedonym Jesus
Loves You so the drug disapproving U.S. audi
ence wouldn't toss the albums aside before lis
tening. His attempts failed, excepting mild suc
cess on "urban" dance stations. Boy George's
most recent triumph, his remake of "The Cry
ing Game" found on the film's soundtrack, has
returned him to his familiar position at the top
of the charts.
One of the most internationally appreciated
performers is a forever-young boy named
Michael Jackson. Though Jackson's career
began well before the '80s, he brought style and
fame to new heights with his 1982 album,
"Thriller." With "Thriller" Jackson broke the
the record of four Top-10 hits off one album

with five. The record was previously held by
Jackson with his '79 album "Off the Wall."
Jackson followed up his overwhelming suc
cess by sharing it with others through a series of
duets. Partners included Rockwell, his brother
Jermaine Jackson and Paul McCartney.
In 1984, Michael reunited his former part
ners and brothers and recorded the Jackson's
"Victory" album. Michael then took a

three year nap in his new mound of

money until
he returned to
fluff his pil
lows by
| recording
the album
"Bad."

"Danger
ous" soon followed; however,
kickbacks from the album apparently didn't
earn Jackson enough money to buy that
planet he's always wanted, so he went and
signed a contract with Sony which will earn

him an even billion. A bil
lion dollars'll buy a lot of
monkeys.
Toto, known for their
"Rosanna," "Africa" and"I
Won't Hold You Back," is
another band readily associ
ated with the video genera
tion.
Their success is easily re
membered and appreciated,
but it is all the more impres
sive when one takes into ac
count that they were origi
nally a band of session musi
cians.
After the group's time of
splendor declined, they too
went their separate ways.
Jeff Porcoro, the drummer
of the band, was killed in an
obscure gardening accident.
Singer, Bobby Kimball
toured solo posing as
"Toto" and was sued by the
remaining members of the

group for it. After the suit, Kimball continued
his tour, however, he did so as "An evening of
Toto music with Bobby Kimball."
In fifth grade, girls used to fight over whether
Nick or Andy was the cutest member of
Duran Duran. (Nick Rhodes. Definitely

Nick Rhodes.)
Duran Duran
brought us the classics
"Rio," "Hungry Like
the Wolf," "The Re
flex" and later, "A
View to A Kill." Since
their big days, the
band has had two
major hits, "All She
Wants is..and "I
Don't Want your
Love," both off of
their 1988 album,
"Big Thing."
Though without
both Andy and
Roger, the three re
maining members
(plus new guitarist
Warren Cuccurullo)
have recently record
ed a new comeback
album, self titled
"Duran Duran." This
album comes with

hopes for renewed
success that their 1990 attempt, "Liberty"
didn't have.
The single "Ordinary World" has already
brought them back into the Top 20. The troupe
can be seen plugging its resurgence on the talk
show circuit, and is hoping to tour again.
From Australia we had Men At Work. Dur
ing their reign they put forth two albums on
which appeared hits "Who Can it Be Now?,"
"Down Under" and "It's a Mistake." The
group released a third album entitled "Two
Hearts," which flopped in 1986.
Upon disbanding, lead singer Colin Hay
attempted a solo album that, likewise, met
with little success.
About three years ago, Hay returned to
the stage with his newly formed The Colin
Hay Band. Their album "Wayfaring Sons"
was a critical success, but a public failure in
the United States.
Nevertheless, he and his band have been
quite popular in their native Australia
where they currently play concerts and
clubs frequently.
In 1985 A-Ha! rocked all stations with
"Take on Me" off their record, "Hunting
High and Low On T.V." After a quiet inter
lude, they returned to the charts with the
theme song for the James Bond film "The
Living Daylights." Their fourth album, re
leased over a year ago, shook the continent
with the unfortunate intensity of a mute
shadow.
Falco ("Rock Me Amadeus," "Vienna
Calling") also experienced a quiet fade out.
The band has put out two albums since the
success of its first, but neither met any re
sponse from U.S. listeners.

Talented singer and snappy head
shaver Cyndi Lauper apparently dis
continued her party-girl singing ca
reer in favor of acting.
Most memorable as the nutty psy
chic in the HBO film "Vibes," in
which she starred opposite Jeff Gold
blum and Peter Falk, Lauper recently
announced her return to music and
expects her new album to be received
better than the Goonies ever were.
In 1982 a band called Asia released
their self-titled album, which includ
ed their most popular song "Heat of
the Moment." They have since put
forth subsequent albums "Alpha,"
"Astra" and the compilation album
"Then and Now."
Recently, Asia put forth a new
album "Aqua," which lacked their
lead singer John Wetton, but fea-

If imitation is a measure of success, then De
peche Mode can hang up their hats.
While their long-lived popularity is in itself
impressive, a recent record has been released
in Europe consisting of several popular
Swedish bands performing covers of original
Depeche Mode songs.
The members of Depeche Mode have laud
ably weaned themselves from the pre-fabbed
synth-pop accompaniment of their infancy to
the more solid sustenance of real instruments.
For proof, look for their latent release "Songs of
Faith and Devotion."

And for the few who remember Baltimora's
1985 hit "Tarzan Boy," it now exists as the jin
gle for the new Listerine Antiseptic ad.
It sometimes seems sad what happened to
the idols of our pre-pubescence. We had
them on pedestals Gary Coleman never
could have reached. Now they exist only in
dust-covered vinyl and Mixed Company con
certs.
Sure, there are the few who made it back and
made it big, but not all of them beat the odds.
We should honor them all.
Pay tribute to Rick Springfield by re-reading
Dynamite Magazine. Put up the old posters and
go listen to whatever you played at your fourth
grade slumber party.
Treat these bands with the reverence they
deserve. After all, no one else will. â–
