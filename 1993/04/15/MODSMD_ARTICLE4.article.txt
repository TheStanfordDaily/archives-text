# Direct-loan program could help students
## But University officials fear extra costs Survey says: 
### Michael McCarroll Staff writer 
President Clinton's recently unveiled
budget calls for the speedy implementation
of a new direct-loan program that could
lower interest rates on student loans. But a
Stanford financial-aid official yesterday ex
pressed skepticism about the plan's effica
cy-
Clinton's proposed fiscal 1994 budget
calls for the full implementation of a pilot
direct-lending program that could reduce

the interest rates students pay on federal
loans by as much as 0.6 percent.
Under the current system, financial-aid
loans are disbursed through private banks
and savings and loan institutions. The gov
ernment insures these loans against de
fault, and pays fees to banks to subsidize
lower lending rates.
The proposed program would eliminate
these intermediaries, and would instead
send the funds directly to schools. The aid
would be distributed through a
school's existing financial-aid pro
grams under the current criteria.
A pilot direct-loan program at
200 schools was approved in Octo
ber to determine the effectiveness
of direct lending. However —
instead of waiting to observe the
effects of the program — the Clin
ton administration wants to push
ahead with a full-scale implemen
tation of direct lending by 1997.
But the rush to enact the new
program has raised concerns at
universities nationwide, includ
ing Stanford.
Robert Huff, director of the
Financial Aid Office, said he
believes the government may be
implementing the program too
soon, and that banks may stop
making loans under the current
program before universities
assume the lender's role. This
could leave students with no place
to borrow funds.
"I am concerned that a lot of
lenders will pull out," Huff said.

"We must keep them around
until we see that the pilot pro
gram will work."
Huff said he would rather see a
continuation of the pilot program
to see just how well it will work.
"Institutions and students must
be assured that the money will be
there," he said.
With the accelerated imple
mentation, more than 250
schools will be included by the
1994-95 academic year. Accord
ing to Huff, Stanford will not be
among those early participants.
The Office of Management and
Budget anticipates an approxi
mate $4.2 billion savings during
the next five years under the
direct-loan program.
At the same time, students will
benefit through reduced interest
rates on their loans. Though
there would be no change in
interest rates or term conditions
until the 1997-98 academic year,
the direct-loan plan will make
more federal funds available for
loans in the interim.
Tom Lyon, a Department of
Education public affairs official,
said the program will greatly sim
plify the student loan process for

students. "There will be far fewer
headaches for students and their
parents," Lyon said.
Under the new system, stu
dents would be able to repay their
loans under a variety of options,
depending on their family's abili
ty to pay. One option, "income
contingent repayment," would let
students repay their loans over a
longer period and as a fraction of
total income.
While the program may make
it easier for students to borrow
and repay their loans, universities
may face increased paperwork
and headaches from the system.
With direct loans, colleges and
universities would have to certify
the eligibility of students and par
ents, provide loan counseling and
disburse loans to borrowers —
exactly as they do under the cur
rent system. 13ut under the new
plan, schools would also deliver
direct-loan promissory notes and
maintain data on disbursements.
Huff said processing these
loans could cost the University up
to $115 each — significantly more
than current accounting costs.
"We could see additional
expense," said Huff. "Given all

the budget cuts, what we don't
need are programs that will cost a
lot to implement."
And while the OMB insists
that students will benefit, HufT
said that "it is premature to guess
how much it will help students."
"The current entitlement pro
gram is being given up for a pro
gram that will have a lot of ques
tions," Huff said.
Educators are also concerned
about the amount requested for
Pell Grants in the administra
tion's budget; while the Educa
tion Department requested $6.3
billion in total Pell-Grant funding
for next year — a 4 percent
increase from last year — tuition
has been increasing nationwide
an average of 6 percent per year.
Thus, a 4 percent increase will
effectively lessen the buying
power of a Pell Grant.
Moreover, the Clinton admin
istration projects that the average
Pell Grant will drop from $1,452
this year to $1,324 next year
because more students will quali
fy for grants.
"The increase in Pell funding
becomes essentially meaning
less," Lyon said.
