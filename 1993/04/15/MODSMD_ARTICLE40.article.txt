■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's got
America abuzz? Well you won't find
out, unless you see writer-director
Neil Jordan's offbeat hit. Stephen
Rea, Forest Whitaker and newcom
er Jaye Davidson are at the top of
their game in this brilliant web of
love and intrigue involving the IRA,
a British soldier and an enigmatic
hairdresser. Shades of "Vertigo,"
it's a definite must-see. R
Falling Down
Michael Douglas plays a laid-off
defense worker who loses it while
trapped in an L A. traffic jam. On
his way home, he leaves a trail of
trashed Korean grocery stores,
dead Latino gangbangers and ter
rified fast food employees in his
wake. Why's it so bad? Because
the filmmakers think that terrorizing
Koreans and shooting helpless
Latinos is funny. It isn't. R
■ Hear No Evil
Disjointed, implausible, contrived,
superficial and uninvolving — and
that's just the script. Marlee Matlin
stars as a deaf athletic trainer
whose life is endangered when
one of her clients hides the world's
most valuable coin in her beeper.
A few laughs — Matlin teaches her
boyfriend how to sign "orgasm" —
but the film offers little beyond tips
on how to mack on hearing-im
paired women. A waste of Matlin's
talent. R
Indecent Proposal
The Brat Packer, The TV Bartender

and The Sundance Kid can't save
this bomb. Destitute couple wants
money. Billionaire wants wife. Bil
lionaire offers a million dollars for
one night with wife. Couple ago
nizes over it. Wife does it. Husband
can't deal with it. Wife enjoyed it.
What's next? Pain, angst and
above all, a happy ending. What's
the moral? Pimpin' ain't easy? I
wanna be yo' ho? Avoid. R
■ Like Water For Chocolate
More magical realism from Down
Under... in Mexico. The
youngest daughter of a ranching
family is forced to stay at home
with her mother despite the atten
tions of a virile suitor. So she sub
limates her overwhelming pas
sions in the kitchen, through the
food she painstakingly prepares.
A delectable banquet of love,
magic and food served up by
Mexican director Alfonso Arau.
Not Rated
Mad Dog and Glory
It could have been a contender;
Produced by Martin Scorsese, writ
ten by Richard Price ("Sea of
Love,") and directed by John Mc-
Naughton ("Henry: Portrait of a Se
rial Killer.") But this story of a gang
ster (Bill Murray) giving a nerdy
cop (Robert DeNiro) the company
of a female bartender (Uma Thur
man) for a week doesn't have
enough character development to
make it work. Still, it boasts the
most brutally honest sex scene
since Almodovar's "Tie Me Up, Tie
Me Down." R
