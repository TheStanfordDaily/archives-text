Searching for substance? Here are four of 1992s best
films on video. In Robert Altman'sThe Player, an
anonymous screenwriter threatens a studio exec
with murder. The exec kills his harasser... but can he get
away with murder? Altman acerbically examines the
everyday deals, double-crosses, pitches in and power plays
of Tinseltown. Best of all, he uses Hollywood's own for
mula — "suspense, laughter, violence, hope, heart, nudity,
sex and happy endings" — to decry the death of film as an
art form.
In Zhang Yimou's latest film, Raise The Red Lantern,
the four wives of a wealthy man scheme and plot against one
another for his attentions. Why? Because only one of them
can be the favored wife at a given time — only one will have
the red lanterns raised before her residence. The newest wife
resists the intrigue, but soon begins to play the game with a
vengeance. Yimou's bleak story markedly contrasts his ele
gantly composed visuals. A haunting masterpiece.
Quentin Tarantino brought us last year's most assured
debut, Reservoir Dogs. A group of professional armed
robbers plot a jewelry-store heist. But when the caper goes
horribly wrong, the thieves try to find out the rat's identi
ty. The script shifts efficiently between the heist's origins
and the aftermath, raising the stakes every step of the way.
A joyfully nihilistic homage to '50s pulp movies.
David Mamet won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1983 play
Glengarry Glen Ross, a scathing look at the cutthroat
world of real estate. To counter slipping sales, management
creates a contest to motivate the salesmen. The top prize is
a Cadillac. The second prize is a set of steak knives. The
third prize? A pink slip. Mamet successfully indicts
Reaganomics by exposing the lies and thievery that helped
the rich get richer at the working class' expense. A stellar
cast — A 1 Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin and
Jonathan Pryce — sinks its teeth into Mamet's juicy script,
creating 1992's most unforgettable performances.
