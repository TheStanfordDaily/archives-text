The last word 0n...
I am from a small town.
No, change that. I am from a podunk, rinky
dink, 72-miles-firom-nowhere, yes-my-high
school-mascot-really-was-the-horned toad
small town.
Stanford is bigger than my home town.
Heck, the line at Aladdin last Sunday was bigger
than my home town. We just got our first stop
light last October.
Need I say more?
But we're all '90s folk here— how does that

Isn't gore grand?

Beavus and Butthead. Lupo the Butcher. Mr. Olaff.
The Bulimianator. With characters like this, how can
you go wrong?
Yes ladies and gents, welcome to the world of Spike
and Mike's Festival of Twisted Animation.
Running from April 16 to May 8 at the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco, the annual collection of intestine
squishing, leg-humping, baby-flesh-eating cartoons as
saults the big screen. Part of Spike and Mike's Festival of
Animation which includes the top, award-winning ani
mated films of the year, Sick and Twisted is a late night

imated shorts.

make me feel?
Dammit, I'm proud. I like being able to
walk down the street and talk to just about
every person you see.
I like going to the video store and rent
ing five movies and watching them all in a
row because, hey, I ain't got nuttin' else to
do.
I like the cheesy poetry in the weekly paper.
I like the drive-in's vanilla Cokes.
But most of all, I like peace.
Where else but a small town can you go to
escape the intellectual hoopla of this here

place? Where else can you forget about the
hassles of university life because no one has
even the slightest idea what you're talking
about?
Where else can you nap and the only thing
that will wake you up is the clicking of a
horse's hooves on the pavement across the
street?
Middle America is great.
Go Toads!
