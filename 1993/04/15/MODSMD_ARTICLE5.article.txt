### Urmimala Sarkar Staff writer With AP wire reports 
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
Stanford English Prof. Emeritus Wallace
Stegner died Tuesday night as a result of
injuries suffered in a March 28 automobile
accident. He was 84.
A renowned teacher, Stegner taught cre
ative writing and literature at Stanford
from 1945 until his retirement in 1971. He
founded Stanford's Creative Writing pro
gram in 1956, which has produced

renowned authors including Ken Kesey,
Larry McMurtry and Scott Turow.
Friends remembered Stegner fondly
yesterday as a great writer and a great
teacher, whose legacy will continue long
after his death.
Nancy Packer, Stegner's former student
and present director of the Creative Writ
ing Program, said Stegner's classes were
always popular with students, and his writ
ings "brought distinction" to the Universi
ty.
"He was a marvelous teacher.
Under his tutelage, my writing
improved as much as it was able,"
Packer added.
Former University President
Donald Kennedy, a longtime
friend of Stegner, said that when
he arrived on campus in 1960 the
author "was the faculty person
that I most admired from afar."
Kennedy called the Creative
Writing program "one of the pro
grams that was really special"
about Stanford, attracting a
"parade of exciting people to cam
pus" to learn the writer's craft
from Stegner.
"Wally was a fine teacher, and
he was also a wonderfully creative
and important writer," Kennedy
said. "His writing, his novels will
grow in stature for a long time. I
think he was a great craftsman,
and I think what he wrote was
timeless."
Packer described Stegner as

"more than just a novelist. He
was a biographer, a short-story
writer, an essayist, a historian, an
en viron men talist."
Indeed, environmentalism was
central to Stegner's writing and
his life. He devoted himself to the
environmental movement for
many years.

'Wally was a fine
teacher, and he was
also a wonderfully
creative and impor
tant writer.'
â€” Donald Kennedy

Stegner, who lived in Los Altos
Hills, loved to write about the
spirit and beauty of the American
West. He won the 1972 Pulitzer
Prize in fiction for the novel
"Angel of Repose," about a man
who researches his pioneer ori
gins in order to come to terms
with his own troubles. In 1977, he
won a National Book Award for
the novel "The Spectator Bird."
His semi-autobiographical
novel "The Big Rock Candy
Mountain," one of his most popu
lar works, described one family's
unsuccessful search for prosperi
ty in the West, paralleling Stegn
er's own Western childhood,

when his father moved the family
constantly in a fruitless search
for success.
Stegner was born in Lake
Mills, lowa, on February 18,
1909, the son of Scandinavian
immigrants. He earned his bach
elor's degree from University of
Utah in 1930, and his master's
and doctorate from the Universi
ty of lowa.
Before joining the University
English Department in 1945, he
taught creative writing and litera
ture at University of Utah, Uni
versity of Wisconsin, and Harvard
University.
Several events have been
scheduled in memory of Stegner.
