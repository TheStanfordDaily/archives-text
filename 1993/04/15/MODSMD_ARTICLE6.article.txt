# Bribes, brevity needed for research
##

Everything has a price — even stu
dent opinion.
Stanford researchers looking for
samplings of student attitudes, tastes
or political persuasions Bay getting
those on campus to respond to surveys
is often a herculean task, usually re
quiring a good deal of creative bribery
to get enough responses.
People conducting surveys have
been known to proffer candy bars,
money, pizza parties, gift certificates
and lottery chances in hopes of attract
ing subjects.
"I was disturbed to hear that stu
dents might need an incentive to an
swer the surveys," said Yoko Takai, a
School of Education graduate student
who has been researching gender is
sues.

"Maybe because there's so much re
search being done here, the students
Eire annoyed and tired of them. They
don't think they're important," she
said.
This mentality holds especially true
if the survey requires time, deep
thought or lacks a personal entreaty —
such as a phone call — asking them to
complete it.
"Briefness is key," said psychology
student Parker Bailey, who conducted
two student surveys — a brief version
and a longer one. He said the return
rate was about 30 percent higher on his
short survey than on the longer one,
even though both surveys were dorm
based.
"With the shorter survey I did for
'Psychology and Gender,' it only took
about two minutes so I could sit there
and wait for [the subjects] to finish it.
"If it's longer, though, they'll say,

'Can I get this back to you?' and some
times they won't," Bailey added.
The problem becomes even more
acute when studies go campus-wide.
While Bailey dealt with response rates
of 100 percent and 70 percent, gender
role researcher Yoko Kawashima —
who distributed 1,200 surveys last
month — has obtained only about 200
responses.
Even more troubling to Kawa
shima, she needs a total of 600 re
sponses by today to reach a meaningful
conclusion. In an effort to drum up
more participation, her assistants re
sorted to offering a pizza party for the
dorm with the highest return rate on
the 23-page surveys.
"Usually with the longer surveys
it's appropriate to give some money,
maybe $5," said Christine Yeh, an as-
sistant to Kawashima. "We can't
pay individuals money for taking
the survey, but last week we
decided to pay distributors of the
survey. That and the pizza party
have helped."
Kawashima's predicament is
not unique. Psychology student
Janet Sung has had a return rate
of less than 10 percent in con
ducting a survey of the freshman
class. "I think an incentive is
good," Sung said. "Unless you
really love answering surveys,
you're not going to want to do it."
Several weeks ago, Law School
students came prepared with
Mrs. Field's cookies during dorm
dinner hours to draw more partic

ipants for a survey on conditions
that would prompt litigation.
Kristen Honey, a freshman
who conducted a survey on Vol
unteers in Asia for a community
service-writing project, said that
personally distributing question
naires was also crucial. "We also
kept it really simple. No sen
tences — just circle yes or no,"
Honey said.
While Honey and her partner
didn't use incentives to encourage
people to answer the survey, they
distributed just 150 in limited
areas.
"I think that if I were doing a
campus-wide survey, I'd try to
recruit as many people as I
could," Honey said. "Mealtimes
are also very good, just because
people aren't bustling to class,
and they have five minutes to fill
out a survey."
