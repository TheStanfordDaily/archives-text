# More graduates choose careers in service
## Economic uncertainty, stagnant job market responsible for shift 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Management-consulting jobs, prestigious law
schools.and medical schools — all are possible,
even expected, career paths for Stanford graduates.
Over the last few years, however, a growing
number of seniors are foregoing — or at least
putting off for a few years — the professional ca
reer track to pursue lower-paying, alternative ca
reers in the public sector.
Twenty-five percent of last year's graduating se
niors expressed a strong interest in public service
jobs — about a 15 percent increase over the last 10
years, according to yearly surveys of individual
counseling appointments at the Career Planning
and Placement Center, said Anne Greenblatt, the
CPPC's public-service and international-career
specialist.
The reason for the interest seems to have to do
with a mixture of timing, age and idealism. Many of
these graduates genuinely want to help others, and
they are at a "time in [their] lives when there's
more flexibility," Greenblatt said.
The other motivation that explains the recent
upsurge in interest is more practical. Despite the
lower pay, economic uncertainties have helped
make public service a more appealing way to get
started in the stagnant job market.
"There are not as many jobs out there as there
have been in the past," said Patrick Kaspari, a re
cruitment officer at the Peace Corps' San Francis
co office.
While this recent upsurge in popularity of public
service jobs may bring back memories of a similar

outbreak of philanthropy 30 years ago,
when President John F. Kennedy first
created the Peace Corps, the renewed
attraction to the field is different this
time around.
Though much of the idealism is still
intact, many students look at the public
service sector as a place to stay in the job
market and gain much-needed skills and
experience before they head back to
school or to the private sector.
For instance, applications from college
undergraduates for the Peace Corps have
gone up 50 percent since 1990, according
to Kaspari. He said the great increase in
interest among college students is mostly
economically driven.
"In harder economic times, people tend

to look at those hardest hit," said Karen
Schlaepfer, a 1989 Stanford graduate who
volunteered with the Peace Corps as a
rural farm worker in Senegal. "If the econ
omy gets better, there may be a dip in
applications, but I hope not."
In addition, students are also discover
ing that public-sector jobs can support
them.
While the Peace Corps only pays volun
teers a stipend for room, board and trans
portation during their 27-month commit
ment to work in various public service
areas in more than 100 countries, begin
ning salaries in many public service jobs
range from $18,000 to $25,000 a year,
Greenblatt said.
"Salaries in public service tend to be
three-fourths of those in business," she
said, "but people can definitely live off
them." Students are also allowed to defer
their college loans if they participate in
certain programs, she said.
And under a plan recently proposed by
the Clinton administration, students who
receive financial aid might soon be able to
pay off two years of loans through one
year of public service. At the present time,
however, the proposal is so vague that
many are unsure of what the impact will
be on service programs.
Other public service organizations,
such as Teach for America and the locally
based Volunteers in Asia, which has
offices at Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz,
also report an increase in applications.
Teach for America received 3,500 appli
cations for 500 to 700 teaching positions
— the highest number since the program
began in 1989, according to Elizabeth
Lach, the program's communications
manager.
The organization commits volunteers
to teach for two years in a public school
district that has a shortage of teachers.
The program pays its teachers a beginning
teacher's salary of about $15,000-$26,000

per year.
At Volunteers in Asia, which sends
graduates and undergraduates to teach
English in Asian countries, applications
have also been steadily increasing over the
past few years, said Hilary Hug, the
Indonesia program director.
Seventy students are vying for 33 posi
tions this year; last year 64 students
applied for the 33 spots. Although these
numbers are not nearly as large as other
national organizations, the percentage
increases are comparable.
Teach for America's Lach also attribut
ed the rise in applications to a reaction to
the Reagan-Bush years and the self-cen
tered mentality of the 1980s. She also said
the current state of the economy has con
tributed to the program's success.
"There's no sure thing these days," she
said. "This way, people can get experience
and contribute to society. Public service
has a huge appeal."
Greenblatt added that some students
she has counseled at the CPPC said they
regretted going straight to graduate
school without working first.
Students can gain lifelong skills in pub
lic-sector jobs, she said, because these jobs
do not have such narrowly defined
descriptions, and workers' duties can be
more broad.
"They can gain resourcefulness, man
agement skills, and the ability to make
things happen," she said.
Gaining experience
Some students — now aware of the
skills that a few years of public service
work can give them, and how that experi
ence can help with future job-hunting —
have chosen volunteer work as the first
step in their career paths.
"People in their twenties want to crys
tallize their career decisions, so the years
after graduation are an important time to
explore, and public service experience is a
good way to explore," Greenblatt said.
Senior Mike Milliken, who will spend
two years teaching English in Indonesia
with the Volunteers in Asia program, said
it is "pretty likely" that he will attend
graduate school after teaching.
But he wants to keep his options open,
and he said he believes that his experi
ences with the teaching program may help
him to be more marketable.
"I'll have a better chance of getting a
job that I'm interested in two years from
now, and I'm really in no hurry," he said.
"I want to see another part of the world
and learn more about myself."
Several other students say they feel the
same way — motivated by personal goals,
yet very aware of the significant practical
experience the public service world offers.
"There are so many challenges, and you
must depend on yourself a lot more than
ever before. You have to leave everything
you know behind," Schlaepfer said of her
Peace Corps experience.
She added that her responsibilities in
Africa made her a stronger individual, and
said she plans to continue working in the
public sector.
Schlaepfer, who now works with the
government's Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children program, plans to attend
Harvard's Kennedy School of Public Poli
cy next fall.
She said that although her motivation
to participate was personal, she gained sig

nificant practical experience as well.
"It seemed like something I wanted to
do and [after graduation] was the only
time I could do it," she said. "It's an
incredible experience."
Public service is also a much wider and
more creative field for people fresh out of
college.
"As a young person who doesn't know
what to do, the public sector is a good
place to start," said Pilar Keagy, a sec
ond-year law student, who worked in
Washington, D.C., for three years before
going back to school. She was a press sec
retary on Capitol Hill for three congress
men, and said she believes her experience
helped her get into law school.
Keagy said she thinks the rise in inter
est in public sector jobs can be traced to a
tough job market and a generation of
young people who want to help others.
"The economy pressurizes people and
makes them more creative," she said.
"But there are also things that make peo
ple coalesce, like AIDS or the environ
ment. Being in college does that — you
feel like you can change the world."
Greenblatt said she hopes the trend
will continue, adding that the Clinton
administration's recently announced
proposal to have students repay loans
through public service should have a pos
itive impact on the public sector, by mak
ing it "more viable and more visible."
However, she added that the program
will only work if it results in students
doing public service because they want
to. "As long as there's not a feeling that
this is something one has to do," she said.

'Although it's low-pay
ing and pressured, it's
more valuable than a
private-sector job
because you feel like
you are giving some
thing back.'

A 'sense of community'
Although all public-sector jobs can
help train people for their professional
careers, they also provide personal fulfill
ment and offer support to participants.
Many people who are employed tem
porarily in the public sector become
hooked, and want to stay involved for a
lifetime. ,
Lach said that of the 1992 Teach for
America volunteers, about 70 percent
stayed in the education field, either
teaching, administrating or going on to
graduate school.
"It's by far the most rewarding thing
I'll ever do," said 1991 graduate Corey
Davis, of his Teach for America teaching
position at Hoover Elementary School in
Oakland.
Now in his second year of teaching,
Davis plans to stay at Hoover for another
three to four years.
"Although it's low-paying and pres
sured, it's more valuable than a private

sector job because you feel like you are
giving something back," he said. "There
is also more of a sense of community in
these jobs."
He said that though many people
applied to Teach for America just to get a
job, he was more motivated by the service
ideal behind the program than economic
pressures.
"I love teaching," he said. "The kids
are the best part — I love exposing them
to different worlds."
The same intentions were behind
Hug's decision to stop out of Stanford for
a year to teach English in Indonesia with
the Volunteers in Asia program.
Hug said that living in another culture
allowed her to examine her own more
objectively.
"I want to help people cooperate better
and become more aware," she said.
"That's why I value IVolunteers in Asia].

We're in a fast-changing world, and with
the problems we face, we must be on our
toes."
These members of "Generation X" —
people who are currently in their twen
ties — "want to repair things and get
things working,"
Greenblatt said.
However, unlike the students of the
'60s, today's college graduates are more
pragmatic, she said, looking for viable
solutions to local problems, rather than
trying to save the world as their more ide
alistic predecessors tried to do.
In the '60s, the Vietnam War perpetu
ated "a sense of political and social
activist motivation that's different from
now," said CPPC Director Ruth Schnei
der. "But in both decades, when people
are in public service, they usually have a
feeling within themselves that they can
make things better."
