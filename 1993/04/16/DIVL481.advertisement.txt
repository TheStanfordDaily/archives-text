A LETTER TO THE
STANFORD COMMUNITY
Dear Stanford Folks —
Aiya! They did it again! Last Saturday, the residents of
OKADA HOUSE and the Asian American students of
Stanford put on the huge Asian American cultural fair
known as Extravaganza. Was it fun? Ask the 2000 people
at White Plaza who ate Korean barbecue & Vietnamese
rice plates, or heard soulful Filipino rappers & South
Pacific dancers,or saw Chemistry Prof. Robert Waymouth
& Computer Science Lecturer Nick Parlante & football star
Elery Roberts get soaked in the water-dunking booth. Best
of all, Extravaganza was a community celebration for
everyone.
We'd like to thank the hardworking, altruistic people who
made Extravaganza a success. Okada House's student
staff — Theme Associates Beatrice Hastings-Spaine, Angel
Lau, & Julius Paras; Resident Assistants Jane Huang,
Michelle Lin, & Chacko Sonny, Resilient Computer Coordi
nator Mickey Killianey, & Head Advising Associate Mickie
Shen — did a professional job that took months to plan.
Over 70 spirited residents and former residents of Okada
House pitched in when we needed them. Jason Burke of
Special Events & Vicki Baker of Tressider were a great
help. Several student organizations and performing groups
added to the festive spirit. In Residential Education,
we've received much support from Alice Supton, Ann
Porteus, &c Elizabeth Hiyama. Lastly, we'd like to thank
the ASSU Program Board, Residential Education, Peter
Bing, and Procter & Gamble Distributing for their finan
cial help. Also, more than 30 Stanford alumni, academic
departments, residence halls, & organizations sent us
contributions. Your generosity is truly appreciated.
We hope you'll catch next year's Extravaganza. Okada
House's new staff and resident fellows, graduate students
Derek & David Miyahara, will stage another fantastic
celebration. Enjoy!
Best Regards,
Virginia Mak, Career Planning & Placement Center
Edward Iwata, Journalist & Editor
Resident Fellows, Okada House
P.S. In case you're wondering, Okada House, Stanford's Asian
American Theme House, is named after the late writer John
Okada, author of No-No Hoy, the first authentic novel about the
World War II internment of Japanese Americans.
