# Law students call for more diversity in the classroom

### Sandy Lee 
Joining a national effort,
Law School students protested
the lack of faculty diversity
during a teach-in yesterday
afternoon.
Before a crowd of about 100
in Crown Quadrangle, speak
ers called for changes includ
ing the hiring of a Native-
American professor, expand
ing the curriculum to include
underrepresented perspectives
and allowing students to have
greater influence in hiring and
admissions.
"We want the administra
tion to feel confronted," said
first-year law student Susan
Callendar. "We want them to
engage us in meaningful
change."
Callendar and other mem
bers of the Coalition for Diver
sifying Faculty organized the
three-hour event to bring
attention to what they believe
is the Law School's historic
neglect in hiring minority fac
ulty members and its hostility
toward alternative viewpoints
in the classroom.
The teach-in was the first of
its kind at Stanford, but coali
tion member Leonard Lopez
said East Coast law schools
such as Yale have sponsored
similar events since 1987.
"The torch has been
passed," Callendar said. "It's
time to get off the Farm and
join the rest of the world."
Besides the issue of faculty
diversity — 72 percent of the
school's professors are white
males — speakers concentrat
ed on the negative experiences
of visiting minority professors
and the need for mentors of
diverse backgrounds.
Several students and facul
ty voiced their support of the
teach-in sponsors. Prof. Kim
Taylor, the first African-
American woman on the Law
School faculty, encouraged the
students to work with the
administration in bringing
minority faculty to Stanford,
and some Law School profes
sors incorporated the theme of
diversity into their classroom
lectures yesterday.
Law School Dean Paul
Brest was unable to attend,
but he issued a written state
ment.
Although the faculty has
not yet achieved its goals, he
said the Law School's commit

ment to diversity is second
only to its desire for excellence
in scholarship.
The Law School's tenured
faculty currently include only
two Latinos and one African-
American. Non-tenured facul
ty include two African-Ameri
cans, one Asian-American and
one openly gay professor.
"Stanford has a history for
the mistreatment of visiting
professors of color," Lopez
said, citing several instances
where professors have experi
enced hostility from both stu
dents and administrators.
In an open letter to stu
dents, the coalition wrote that
in 1987, alternative constitu
tional law classes were set up
for students who complained
that visiting Prof. Derrick
Bell's teaching heavily empha
sized the role of slavery and
racism in the creation of con
stitutional law.
And visiting Prof. Mari
Matsuda — who is one of the
top Asian-American race
scholars in the nation — was
not extended an offer or even
considered for a faculty posi
tion two years ago, said first
year law student Selena Dong.
The Law School's decision
not to hire Matsuda precipitat
ed race theorist Prof. Charles
Lawrence's resignation, Dong
said.
As a result of the Law
School's hiring record, "the
faculty is missing voices," she
added.
"These visiting professors
of color teach with acknowl
edgment of their perspective
because of their experiences as
people of color," Lopez said.
The coalition is hoping to
promote "alternative" views of
legal scholarship, which stud
ies not only the law as a writ
ten text but also its implica
tions.
The coalition is comprised
of nearly 40 students, Lopez
said. Launched in 1990, it
found early success in its
efforts to recruit more profes
sors of color for the faculty.
In 1990-91, Taylor became
the first African-American
woman professor and Janet
Halley was the first openly les
bian professor to join the Law
School.
A hiring freeze last year,
however, had reduced the
group's activism until yester
day's event.
