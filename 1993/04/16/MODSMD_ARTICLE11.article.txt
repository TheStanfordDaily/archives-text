# Madera, Okada to exchange locations
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Okada and Madera Houses will switch loca
tions this summer to give the Asian-American
theme dorm wheelchair accessibility and pro
vide both dorms with facilities for an equal
number of men and women.
In the new Okada, the first-floor bathroom
will be made wheelchair accessible and coed as
part of the University's 10-year capital
improvement project.
"[The renovations] will allow handicapped
students to live in Okada and let them partici
pate in the Asian-American experience," said
Okada Resident Fellow Virginia Mak.
Since the house reflects the cultural back
ground of 25 percent of Stanford's student
body, it should be wheelchair accessible, said
Alice Supton, director of Residential Educa
tion.
The need to improve accessibility and to
comply with the recently enacted Americans
with Disabilities Act contributed to the Uni
versity's decision, Supton added.
Because the RFs in both Okada and Madera
are changing this year and because Wilbur
Hall will be undergoing major renovations in

other areas, this summer would be an ideal
time to make the switch, Res Ed officials wrote
in a March 31 letter to members of the Asian-
American community.
Supton said minimal response to the letter
indicated that most Asian-Americans at Stan
ford do not have strong feelings against the
move.
"We know it's a sacrifice for the communi
ty to re-establish itself in a new place because
of its cultural memory, but the community is
willing to accept the costs for Okada to be
wheelchair accessible and for the good of the
(current) sandwich dorms," Supton said.
"Sandwich dorms" are dorms without coed
floors that have two floors of one sex but only
one floor of the other, causing a gender imbal
ance.
The move will allow Madera, which cur
rently has two all-male floors and one all
female floor, to become gender-balanced next
year â€” since the current Okada is already
equipped with a third-floor coed bathroom.
A meeting was held April 8 in Okada lounge
to allow Asian-American community members
to express their feelings on the proposed
change. According to Supton, two Okada
alumni were "not enthusiastic" about the

switch, but most students did not object to the
move.
"The students felt that the reasons were
sufficient to warrant the move," she said.
As part of an effort to bring the spirit of the
current Okada House to the new one, Supton
said Res Ed will subsidize a mural painter to
create cultural artwork for the new location
and would provide funds for a celebration of
Okada's relocation.
The move will promote a renewed interest
in the Okada program, Mak said. "It opens up
the discussion of the Asian-Americans and
allows the community to see itself."
Supton said the new Madera will be called
Junipero, which is the house's original name.
Michelle Lin, a resident assistant in Okada,
said she believes the move to a slightly smaller
dorm will foster a closer community.
"Of the people I've talked to, they seemed
to be excited about the change," she said.
"Okada's spirit doesn't depend on its loca
tion."
The renovation program will concentrate
on Wilbur this summer and will include
improved wheelchair access, gender balancing
and a general refurbishing of student rooms
and common areas.
