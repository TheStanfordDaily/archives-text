# Russia offered $28 billion in aid

TOKYO (AP) — Seven of the world's
richest nations gave Boris Yeltsin a
solid vote of confidence yesterday by
offering a $28.4 billion aid package to
promote his chances in a leadership ref
erendum and push Russia toward a
free-market economy.
The Group of Seven did not formally,
tie the aid to Yeltsin's victory in the
April 25 nationwide referendum on his
policies, the Secretary of State Warren
Christopher pointedly said, "The world
will be a considerably more dangerous
place if President Yeltsin does not pre
vail."
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei
Kozyrev praised the plan and said that
Moscow and its former enemies are
meeting "each other midway."
The aid will come from development
agencies such as the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, which
are financed mainly by the industrial

powers. This money will add to the indi
vidual aid packages announced by sev
eral nations during the two days of talks
on emergency aid for Moscow.
Earlier this month, major donor
nations agreed to make it easier for
Russia to repay the $15 billion in debts
of the former Soviet Union.
Although there is no formal link
between the money and the referen
dum, some Russians worry that the
Group of Seven could reconsider the
package if Yeltsin loses.
Some of the loans require proof that
Russia is undertaking corrective eco
nomic measures. But others will require
little more than a promise by Yeltsin
and his government to do their best.
The financial help is intended to
boost Yeltsin's program to transform
the Russian economy to free markets
and private ownership, an effort that is
being fought by hard-line lawmakers

elected before the Soviet collapse.
It also is an attempt to persuade
Yeltsin's countrymen to support him in
the referendum with promises that
their lives will be better after infusions
of Western assistance and advice.
Christopher called the mutual sup
port in this effort "extraordinary."
Christopher also said the United
States would add $1.8 billion to a $1.6
billion U.S. aid program pledged by
President Clinton earlier this month.
The additional aid includes $500 mil
lion for a new fund to finance the con
version of state-run Russian industries
to private ownership.
Christopher urged the other Group of
Seven nations — Japan, Germany,
Britain, Canada, France and Italy — to
put $1.5 billion in the privatization fund
and said international agencies would pro
vide a matching $2 billion. Most nations
said they needed to study the proposal.
