## Editorial An open ASSU letter 
### 
The campaign posters
were strewn across campus
this week with promises of
an effective ASSU. "Vote for me
and you'll see a new era at Stan
ford," the signs all seemed to say.
Yet, as is the case with every elect
ed official, campaign promises and
accomplishments while in office
are two vastly different things.
Those newly elected to repre
sent the student body in the ASSU
must be pressured by students
and their legislative peers to con
tinuously work toward achieving
student needs. The ASSU is not
about resume-packing, and any
person who acts in such a manner
should be removed.
However, the promises of some
candidates this year were exuber
ant to the point of almost being
unachievable. Some candidates for
senate seats even went so far as
placing the Taco Bell logo on their

flyers. If bringing Taco Bell to
Tresidder was as easy as xeroxing
the logo onto flyers, it would have
been done a long time ago. Those
who were elected and made
promises such as these should
know that they will be held
accountable for their campaign
oaths. It is obvious that Stanford
students are still skeptical of the
ASSU, and the organization
should work toward winning stu
dents' trust back — immediately.
When the senate convenes for
the first time next month, they
should feel as if the eyes of all stu
dents are on them. They should
feel as if they will be held account
able for everything they do not do
as well as everything they do per
form.
They should take their posi
tions seriously, the actions of their
peers seriously and, especially, the
idea of reform seriously.
