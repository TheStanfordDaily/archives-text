# A 						direct (loan) plan
## 
### 
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S
recently unveiled direct-loan
program is a step in the right
direction in helping students
obtain an affordable college
degree.
The pilot direct-lending pro
gram — which could lower the
interest rates on student loans by
as much as .6 percent — would
eliminate intermediaries such as
private banks and savings-and
loan institutions and would
instead send money directly from
the government to schools. Fur
thermore, as an additional aspect
of the loan plan, steps would be
taken to simplify the loan process
for students.
However, universities, including
Stanford, are skeptical about the
program and are worried about
increased accounting costs on their
end. They should be encouraged to
work with the government to work
out kinks such as these rather
than opposing the plan altogether.

Stanford officials foresee a pro
cessing charge on the new loans of
$115 per loan, which is significant
ly higher than current costs. One
option to alleviate these costs would
be for the government to take some
of the $4.2 billion — money it hopes
to save with the program over the
next five years — and reimburse
schools for some of the costs. That
way both the government and stu
dents would be saving money, and
universities would see little
increase in their costs.
With Stanford tuition increas
ing 7.5 percent next year, it is no
secret that the cost of higher edu
cation has spun radidly out of con
trol. It is unfair for universities to
say they can not handle additional
costs such as these when they
themselves are asking students to
pay additional costs to obtain their
education. A good idea such as
Clinton's should be worked with
until an affordable compromise is
found.
