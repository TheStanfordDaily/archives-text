Daily photo spread neglects good side of East Palo Alto

IN RESPONSE to the photo essay
"Night and Day in East Palo Alto," I
would like to address two issues.
This statement is also in relation to
Kwame Yao Anku's column and Burt
Herman's subsequent defense. My ini
tial response to the front-page photo
was, "Man, they got another brother on
the cover." The picture of a "colored"
man, although it is obvious to me that
he is black, and what I see as a white
officer, will not inspire folks to rush and
fight East Palo Alto crime.
Crime waiting "for the cover of dark
ness to spring into action," as the cap
tion states, will not encourage Stanford
students to leave the "ivory tower." Yet
I cannot deny that if you go into East
Palo Alto at night, just hanging around,
you may run into crime. Most criminals

commit crimes because they are either
bored or have felt forced by the system
to "get their own." But the vast mEyority
of residents go about the business of
making an honest living and trying to
make the best of (I won't mince words) a
depressed situation.
I agree with Herman that East Palo
Alto's crime is a reality and is a hard
fact to swallow. But as a black male in
this country I would like to remind
everyone that race does matter and I
hope that Herman will recognize that
race is more than an issue. It is my reali
ty, the context in which I live. This fact
is hard to swallow. As a journalist in a
"call to arms" against crime, Herman
does not have to cater to racial issues
and forsake reality but must also recog
nize that race is in the fabric of the

everyday lives of East Palo Alto resi
dents. The problem of crime can better
be solved when the residents of East
Palo Alto are also portrayed as the
antagonists of crime.
Residents must also be included and
depicted on the "good" side so that stu
dents who wish to help out will know
that there are many organizations that
are active against crime.
My point is that there are a myriad of
"good" forces in East Palo Alto who
have been fighting this battle for a long
time. In "Night and Day" I did not see
black and Latino adults of which there
are many in East Palo Alto, fighting the
crime along with the teachers and stu
dents. Education is one way to indirectly
fight drugs and boredom. More police
cars is another way to fight crime —

though I don't recommend it. Jesus
Christ is another way — one which I
recommend.
Church drug rehabilitation programs
seem to me an obvious, concrete and
direct attack on drugs. There are over 40
churches in East Palo Alto, yet the city
is not heralded as the Missionary Capitol
of the United States. There are active
MADD and DADD organizations in East
Palo Alto. Reader, did you know this?
With more program support the white
woman whp died of a drug overdose
might have lived. I hope this letter has
served as more than just a rebuttal.
Conflict may cause discomfort but I am
optimistic that it has bred knowledge —
for all of us.
