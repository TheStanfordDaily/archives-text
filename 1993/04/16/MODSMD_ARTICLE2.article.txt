# Home-style cooking?
## 4 Row houses to become 'semi-self-ops' 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Complaints about the poor quality of food in Uni
versity-operated Row houses have spurred the ad
ministration to make the residences student-man
aged starting next fall.
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Grove (Mayfield and La
suen), Roth and 557 Mayfield will become "semi
self-ope rated," which means residents will hire a
cook and supervise their kitchen, but the Universi
ty will provide custodial services.
Budget cuts two years ago forced the University
to remove the individual cooks in each house and
cart in meals from larger residences nearby. But the
food had to be reheated, and students found it un
satisfactory.
"Last-year we had food brought in from Wilbur.
The rubber chicken was extra rubbery when it got
here," said Andrew Lisac, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk's
resident fellow.
"The carting in was a disaster," agreed Alice Sup
ton, director of Residential Education.
Ideas such as having a few cooks prepare food for
more than one house failed. Other options, such as
providing students with 24-hour access to house
kitchens, were successful, but didn't satisfy stu
dents.
After a while, students started dining at large
campus cafeterias and stopped eating at their own
houses, Supton said.
"The community (within the houses) fell apart"
because people did not come together at meal times
"to catch up with another, talk to one another," she
said.
Delivering food to small houses was also expen
sive, another reason the administration decided to
make the transition.
"We cannot do for 30 people Iwhatl we can do for
300," Supton said.
Residents have been voicing their dissatisfaction
for two years now, holding numerous meetings and
discussions â€” among themselves and with the ad
ministration.
"[The change] is long overdue. It'll help residents
take a stake in their house and
form a much better community,"
said senior Tera Martin, a resident
assistant at Grove who helped
bring about the conversion.
"Semi-self-ops" differ from
fully self-operated dormitories in
that self-ops require students to
do their own cleaning or hire a jan
itor themselves. Co-operative
houses differ from self-ops in that
residents prepare meals them
selves instead of hiring a cook.
Because the decision was
announced late in the school year,
the Housing Center will circulate an
addendum to the Draw Book describ
ing these houses as semi-self-ops.
