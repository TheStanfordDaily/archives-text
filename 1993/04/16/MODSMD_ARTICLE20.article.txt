# Executive powers are necessary at Stanford

"The truth is that Stanford stu
dents are not ignorant, or apathetic,
but rather they are realists," Alison
Callicoatte wrote concerning last
year's victory of "I Prefer Not to Have
a COP."
Being realistic is, of course, natural.
However, being too realistic is not. Any
thing worth doing in this world is inher
ently not easy. "What's the point of
fighting for equality? The dominant
class is not going to give in." "What's
the point of fighting for anything if the
mtyority of the people don't support it?"
Many of us have probably felt this way
at one point or another.
Yet while it is important for us to
realize our capabilities and limitations,
throwing in our towels when things get
too rough is not going to accomplish
anything. In fact, to accomplish any
thing significant, sometimes it takes a
dreamer, someone who is willing to

build a path where none exists, to fight
against hopeless circumstances, to make
the most out of his or her situation.
There is no guarantee that the new
COP will be able to do all that. In fact,
the odds are against them. So much
depends on the University administra
tion, rather than student initiative, on
many issues of concern. But at least
they are willing to try. I think it's a bit
cruel to slap them in the face and deny
them a chance, simply because the peo
ple before them failed.
Yes, Stanford students are realistic,
often too realistic. I don't blame them,
'cause I'm one. It's really difficult to
care about what you learn and what you
do and the people and issues around
you, when you have to worry about
grades and money and other urgent
matters in life.
However, I don't think we have the
right to stop others from dreaming.
Shouldn't a reasonable choice be to give
a new COP a chance, since we really
have nothing to lose?
