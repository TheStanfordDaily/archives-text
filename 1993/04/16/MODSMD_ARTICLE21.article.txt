# COP should be given a chance to effect change
## 
### 
Apathy seems to have become the
norm these days; we cynically believe
that no government is better than a
bureaucratic government. The thing
that still puzzles me, though, is that
while we would like things to improve,
we shy away from electing officials to do
the job.
In Alison Callicoatte's April 12 let
ter to The Daily, she claims the COP
will have little effective input to the
administration.
I argue that the solution is not to
abolish the COP, but rather, to
strengthen it. If our goal is to have
the administration listen to the stu
dent voice, it seems logical that they
would pay more attention to a com
mitted group of popularly elected
leaders.
Last year's election of "I Prefer
Not To . . was a reminder to stu
dent government that they should not

be working towards a more impres
sive resume, but rather a better Stan
ford community.
From a policy standpoint, "I Prefer
Not To . . claimed that the tasks
performed by the COP could be
undertaken by the ASSU Senate.
While it is certainly possible that this
is the case, such decision-making
lacks the solidarity of executive nego
tiation.
To make an analogy, allowing
Congress to negotiate foreign policy
would bury issues in a political quag
mire, whereas electing a presidential
administration allows for guidance
and a cohesive policy approach. It
seems silly to cripple our student gov
ernment by cutting off its executive
branch.
I'm not suggesting that the COP
position is without its flaws, but let's
shed this cloak of apathy and elect stu
dents who are dedicated to improving
the quality of student life. Why not give
them a chance?
