I'D LIKE TO introduce my roommate.
Some of you already know him, and
for the rest of you, I'll refrain from
randomly assigning him a Germanic
name.
He's not such a bad roommate, aside
from his mild snoring and having a Texas
thing (not that there's anything wrong
with Texas. I'm from there myself, but
some people just have this thing about
it). He's so shiny and happy that the sight
of him sometimes blinds people. Occa
sionally his aura causes all of the forest
animals to bring offerings of food; in the
case of the squirrels, it's stale bagels. In
1973, his face was spotted in a bowl of
corn mush in Guatemala.
Anyway, he just got glasses. His vision
had begun to deteriorate, no doubt due to
extreme over-exposure to Willie Nelson (I
am now running the risk of angering peo
ple who live in a state where there are
four guns for every man, woman, child
and dog. Not very smart.). After a few
calls, he moseys on down to the
optometrist and Lenscrafters. Bang.
Then for the next day and a half, he
walks around repeating, "Boy, this is
cool. I can see. Everything's in focus."
We had a special house meeting while he
was in the shower, but my motion to
amputate his toes was rejected. The
milder factions believed he'd quiet down
after a few days. He has, so maybe the
toes thing was a little extreme.

A few years ago my vision took a head
er too, certainly because of an unfortu
nate incident involving the mixture of
cheesy female pop vocalists (Stacey Q,
Pat Benatar and the like) and occult
heavy metal (Blue Oyster Cult and Black
Sabbath). I was young enough that my
mother had to take me to get glasses. The
frames I got were the frames-of-choice of
engineering graduate students, if you
know what I mean. They weren't very
comfortable and none too stylish, so I
wore them only for driving. By the time I
got here, my musical tastes had forced
me to need glasses to read the chalk
board, but that was it — driving and
classes.
The point is this, I'm really amazed by
my roommate's quick and painless tran
sition from bare-faced man about town to
sophisticated glasses guy. He didn't even
break a sweat in picking the frames. As
you'll notice in my picture, I don't walk
around with them on my face all day,
every day. I can see reasonably well with
out them, but I'm not always sure if
someone is waving or making an obscene
gesture at me.
My excuse is rapidly losing its validity
as the Cold War passes into history, but
luckily this is a seismically unstable area.
If I got used to wearing my glasses, and a
disaster struck — be it nuclear war, the
Big One or whatever — then I would be
helpless without my glasses. In the post

apocalyptic world, where my glasses
could be destroyed or lost due to innu
merable causes (for instance, a giant
radioactive cockroach attack), my depen
dence on them would be a serious handi
cap. Comparisons to Velma abound.
I'm getting better about wearing them
though. I can admit that the probability
of giant radioactive cockroaches knock
ing off and trampling my glasses is
remote when compared to the possibility
that I'll be dorking along across the
street one day and ignore a fuzzy tan blob
in the distance. Next thing I know, I'll be
in the hospital with SURE cart tire
tracks across my back.
Why should you care? Why on earth
should you care about this little quirk of
some weirdo Daily columnist?
Because it's more interesting than
reading the Daily comics. Because maybe
we all have little quirks like this. You
should care for the same reason that you
should care that Chronicle columnist
Adair Lara's kids spit food at her cat,
because maybe you can learn something
from all of this, and maybe not.

Kenny once tried spitting food at his cat,
but due to his poor vision, merely ended,
up covering his Chia Pet in tofu.
