# Joel Stein: Aphorisms that Smudge

-JL OU DON'T KNOW

how to sin anymore. Pride, avarice, sloth,
masturbating to vaguely erotic pictures
of women in Sears catalogues — those
were sins. They were activities you could
enjoy — activities that made your soul
tougher, your gut fatter and your fore
arms bigger.
Today's sins aren't even things you
can hide from your mother. They are
group sins, which are actually committed
alone, and have absolutely nothing in
common with group sex, which is actual
ly an individual sin. Group sins are things
with "-isms" at the end, like sexism,
racism and classism, although no one
seems too sure exactly what that last one
is. Nihilism is not a group sin because the
group is too large.
So forget the rain forest. Put the ozone
on hold. Save the individual. Let him
smoke in airports. Let him say bad things
about the Dalai Lama, if that's what he
feels. Hell, let him call him a resume
packer. Whatever the sacrifice, bring
Dalai back.

The heros of old — the Gary Coopers
who come back to don the sheriff's pin
one more time — no longer face off
against their enemies at high noon.
Instead Thelma and Louise triumph over
"men," Michael Douglas revolts against
"the inner city," and Macaulay Culkin
succeeds despite "a well-written script."
If Frank Capra were alive today, Jimmy
Stewart would lobby Congress for FDIC
reform. ("You're the best ad hoc commit
tee a man could ever hope for.")
Things were better back in Capra's
time, when there was a Cold War to fight.
It was the individual against the collec
tive — even if the individual was Joe
McCarthy. Without a communist threat
right at our door, America has turned
inward for villains, specifically to groups
which are easy to pick on: drug users
have no constitutional rights. Smokers
must pay for health care and can only
smoke in those designated continents
which don't get CNN. Short women must
still wear heels to formal events.
So we must band alone. We must arm
ourselves against the idea of false con
sciousness which persists even after the
Marxist project is long dead. We are not
simply the prejudices of the groups we

were born into. We are the prejudices of
the friends we chose in late junior high
school. And if that means preferring
women in stonewashed jeans with the
zippers on the ankles, then so be it. Bet
ter that then those tan corduroy GAP
pants.
No one says leaving the comfort of
your group is going to be easy. Nor is
forming your own opinions and personal
ity. Remember when Peter tried it and
wound up with that lame Humphrey
Bogart thing about pork chops. Yes, it
was painful to watch, but he found him
self by the end of the episode, and he
never had that whiny, middle-child syn
drome that plagued Jan for all her years.
The first thing you must do is cut all
ties with every group you have ever been
a part of. If you are a divorce lawyer, and
people say offensive things about divorce
lawyers — like how they make money by
forcing people who once loved each other
to fight over wedding gifts they never
used, like juicers — refuse to think of
yourself as a divorce lawyer. Simply
reframe your identity as a person who
happens to do terrible things to people
who once loved each other, and that their
rash generalization about the juicer does

not apply to you. This will frustrate them
terribly.
But more than the sheer pleasure of
an attractive divorcee's frustration, this
attitude is the first step in forging an
individual identity. The other is to never,
ever get on any mailing lists.
And, as in this Peter allegory, which is
proving itself frighteningly useful in
making my point, we must allow our
older brothers to wear red bellbottoms
and to effectively destroy — through
unbelievably tacky in decoration, the
attic that we hope to one day have.
Leave the individual alone. Let him
make his own decisions. Let him take
drugs and smoke cigarettes and watch
Sharon Stone movies. Stop trying to peck
him to death with yet another useless
place for nutrition and warning labels:
"Warning: Cellular phones may make
you look like an asshole to people driving
next to you." Let him go it alone. Give
him a Homestead Act, 40 acres, a mule
and a Powerßook, and let him drive at
whatever speed he damn well pleases in
the Western states.
Because without individualism we'll
be no different than the Japanese, only a
little more slothful. And we still won't do

jumping jacks after the age of 12. And we
won't wear those T-shirts with English
words that don't say anything, unless it
says "ACA Joe" or "Frankie says relax."
But basically, we'll be like the Japanese.
So, this weekend, go out and sin the
old fashioned way: break a law. Figure
out which law it is you particularly find
offensive and surreptitiously break it.
Steal cable. Photocopy a text book. Do
that "submarine" thing where you turn
off your car lights and turn on the inside
ones. Until the laws more adequately
reflect our rights, they don't deserve your
respect.
The Japanese would never say that.
And if they did, there's no way they could
fit it on a T-shirt.
