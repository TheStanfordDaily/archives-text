## Do-or-die weekend series in Los Angeles for baseball 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
"You can say this is a do-or
die weekend for us, which it is,"
said coach Mark Marquess.
"But you can say the same thing
about every series we play at
this point."
Stanford (19-15 overall, 6-9
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) travels to Jackie
Robinson Field this weekend for
yet another crucial three-game

conference series, this time
with UCLA (19-12, 7-8).
With 15 games remaining in
its Six-Pac schedule, the Cardi
nal holds its postseason destiny
in its own hands, trailing divi
sion-leading USC by only three
games. Stanford rebounded
from a near-disastrous five
game Spring Break losing
streak to capture consecutive
series against the Trojans and
California.
"You try not to worry about

other teams," said junior Nate
Olmstead. "Our team philoso
phy all season has been to play
every game the same way."
Philosophy or not, the Cardi
nal has struggled all season to
maintain some degree of game
to-game consistency. Stanford
rebounded from an 11-3 drub
bing at the hands of San Jose
State on Monday — "one of our
definite low points," according
to Marquess — to defeat UC-
Davis, a highly-respected Divi

sion II program, 6-2 on Tues
day.
"There's a reason for that,"
Marquess said, "and that's
youth. But that doesn't make it
all any easier to accept."
On a team that often fields a
lineup made up exclusively of
freshmen and sophomores, youth
has been a catchword all season
for the squad's misfortunes.
Yet things do show signs of
turning around. The Cardinal's
fielding problems, pitching lapses
and production difficulties, all
attributed at some point in the
season to inexperience, have
slowly begun to disappear.
Freshman third baseman
Brian Dallimore, moved into the
leadoff spot in the lineup three
weeks ago, has responded with a
nine-game hitting streak, rais

inghis batting average to .313 in
the process. More importantly,
Dallimore has committed only
two errors in those nine games
after picking up 12 in his first 25
appearances.
"Dallimore is so much better
now than he was at the start of
the season," Olmstead said.
"We all knew he could field, but
he's been hitting the ball, too."
"When I got here, the coach
es basically reconstructed my
swing," Dallimore said. "I've
felt much more comfortable at
the plate lately."
A similar improvement is evi
dent on the mound. While top
starters Willie Adams and
Andrew Lorraine have been noth
ing short of excellent all season,
the staff has struggled beyond
them. Freshmen Todd Bartels

and Dan Reed have been, at best,
spotty in the No. 3 starter's role
— while Stanford is 6-4 in leaguo
with Adams or Lorraine starting,
it is 0-6 when either Bartels or
Reed takes the mound.
But Bartels and Reed both
threw well against Davis, which
is a sign of things to come,
according to Lorraine.
"Everyone (on the staff) is
picking everyone else up," Lor
raine said. "It used to be that
when someone pitched poorly, it
had a snowball effect on every
one else. But not any more.
We're going to start winning
those games."
And just in time. UCLA fea
tures a powerful lefthanded-hit
ting lineup led by first baseman
Ryan McGuire. McGuire, a
junior, is hitting .388 and is aver
aging one home run every eight
at-bats. As a team, the Bruins
are batting .315 and scoring just
under eight runs a game.
"They're dangerous hitters,"
Lorraine said. "If they get
ahead of you, then they do you
some damage."
UCLA, which advanced to the
finals of the NCAA Mideast
Regional last season, is ranked
No. 13 in the latest Baseball
America poll. But the Bruins have
dropped six of their last 10 games.
"It's a big weekend for both
teams involved," Marquess said.
"We both need these games to
remain in the Six-Pac race."

Joshua Folk — Daily file
Junior Andicw Lorraine is one bright spot on the mound for the Cardinal, but Stanford's pitching line
up has not proven to be very deep this season.
