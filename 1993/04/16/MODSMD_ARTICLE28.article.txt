Stanford came in second
out of a 13-team, 27-boat
field at the St. Francis
Yacht Club Invitational
last Saturday and Sunday.
Hawaii won the regatta by
seven points and Califor
nia took third, trailing the
Cardinal by 25 points.
This Saturday, the
North Team Eliminations
will be held in Redwood
City.
The top three finishers
in the team races will
qualify for the Pacific
Coast Championships,
held April 30th.
On Sunday, Stanford
hosts the ninth and final
North Series Regatta.
California and Stanford
have split the first eight
regattas evenly, making
Sunday's outcome the
final determination of who
will be awarded the Bell,
sailing's equivalent of the
Axe in football.
