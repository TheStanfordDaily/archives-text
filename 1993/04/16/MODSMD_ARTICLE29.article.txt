# Track heads to Mt. SAC invite
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
This weekend, 16 members of the Stanford track
and field team will be competing at the prestigious
Mt. San Antonio College Invitational, while the rest
of the squad will travel to San Francisco for the
Johnny Mathis Invitational.
The Mt. SAC Invite, based in Walnut, Calif., is one
of the most prestigious national meets during the
regular season. World-class athletes, Olympians and
world-record holders are represented there each
year, according to assistant coach Scott Chisam.
"Mt. SAC is a very elite meet with outstanding
athletes competing in every event," Chisam said.
"For us it's a good opportunity to run [personal
records] and hopefully gain a few NCAA-qualifying
marks."
Distance runners Louise Watson and Dave Scud
amore, along with high jumper Travis Clark and
steeplechase specialist Mike Reilly are already clos
ing in on NCAA standards. The four will try to obtain
their respective qualifying marks at either this
week's invitational or at the upcoming Penn Relays
in Pennsylvania.
Watson, the NCAA District-8 Regional champion
in cross-country, will run the 3,000-meter for the
first time this year. After finishing sixth place in the
10,000 at last year's Pacific 10 Conference Finals,
Scudamore is trying to improve upon that mark as
well as to qualify for the NCAAs this year.
Clark, who cleared the NCAA provisional mark of

7 feet.l 3/4 inches at the Stanford All-Comers Meet
last weekend, will make another attempt at the
NCAA automatic mark, 7-4 1/2, this weekend.
"I think Travis will hit 7-4 at least because he'll be
competing in a field of people who can clear 7-4 to 7-
6," Chisam said. "There's even going to be someone
who's cleared a 7-8 there this weekend."
With such high-quality competition represented
at Mt. San Antonio College this weekend, head coach
Vin Lananna is also looking for most of the athletes
to meet Pac-10 qualifying times and measurements.
"This is the best chance we've had all year to qualify
our athletes, because of the high-caliber people we're
going up against."
Lananna is looking for Pac-10 qualifying perfor
mances out of the athletes competing in the Johnny
Mathis Invite, as well. "The ones going up there are
actually progressing and putting themselves in a
position to qualify later this season, but the meet this
week will remain relatively low-key."
Presently, the Cardinal boasts four men and
seven women qualifiers for the Pac-10s. Clark has
qualified in the high jump, Reilly in the 3,000
steeplechase, Rene Rodriguez in the 400, and Pat
Stowell in the discus.
For the women, Dena Dey, Watson and Melissa
Freeburg have achieved the Pac-10 mark in the
1,500, while Christy Boyd qualified in the 100 hur
dles.
Rhonda Oliver has qualified in the 100 and 400,
Dana Weeks in the triple jump and Jenny
McCormick in the javelin.
