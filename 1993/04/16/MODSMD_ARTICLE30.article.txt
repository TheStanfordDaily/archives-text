# Men's tennis hosts southern Cal teams

If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.
That could be the motto of
Stanford's men's tennis team
this weekend as it seeks
revenge against USC and
UCLA. After soundly defeating
the Cardinal on its own turf,
the No. 2 Trojans and No. 1
Bruins are hoping for a repeat
performance at the Farm.
But if the No. 5 Cardinal has
anything to say about the mat
ter, the three teams will be tied
for first place in the Pacific 10
Conference by the end of the
weekend. UCLA was the only
undefeated team in the
nation's top-10 until last week
when USC, sporting a full,
healthy lineup for the first time
this season, crushed the Bruins
5-1.
The return of USC's top hit
ters, Brian MacPhie and David

Eckerot, proved to be too much
for the Bruins last week. After
playing the Trojans in Los
Angeles, Cardinal coach Dick
Gould acknowledged the chal
lenge posed by the Trojan
squad. "If they have a full line
up, we will need to take advan
tage of every single opportuni
ty."
After the team's last
encounter with its southern
foes, Gould was confident the
Cardinal could improve enough
to give USC and UCLA a much
stronger challenge the second
time around.
"A lot can happen in two
weeks, and we're continuing to
improve at a greater rate than
they are," he said. "How far we
can close the gap remains to be
seen."
Today the Cardinal will find
out if it has, in fact, closed the
gap and risen to the most elite
level of collegiate tennis. For several
reasons, this may be the day for an
upset of the Trojans. The Cardinal
has a healthy lineup, several close,
confidence-building wins under its
belt and the advantage of playing at
home.
Although Stanford's top hitter,
Michael Flanagan, was ill earlier in
the week and sat out Tuesday's
match against Utah, Gould says
Flanagan is recovering and hitting
well in practice.
Recent wins over Fresno State,

Arizona, Arizona State and Utah
have tested the Cardinal's doubles
teams. All three teams — Flanagan
and Chris Cocotos at No. 1, Robert
Devens and Vimal Patel at No. 2 and
freshmen Jeff Salzenstein and Jim
Thomas at No. 3 — have lost only
one match between them this sea
son.
Finally, the homecourt advantage
will be as strong as the fan support is.
"There's a tremendous difference
between playing at home and away,"
Gould said. "A good, supportive
home crowd could be the equalizer
[this weekend 1." Jiffy Lube, the
sponsor of this weekend's matches,
will give tennis towels to the first
1,000 fans who come to each contest.
