# Men's tennis hosts southern Cal teams

If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.
That could be the motto of
Stanford's men's tennis team
this weekend as it seeks
revenge against USC and
UCLA. After soundly defeating
the Cardinal on its own turf,
the No. 2 Trojans and No. 1
Bruins are hoping for a repeat
performance at the Farm.
But if the No. 5 Cardinal has
anything to say about the mat
ter, the three teams will be tied
for first place in the Pacific 10
Conference by the end of the
weekend. UCLA was the only
undefeated team in the
nation's top-10 until last week
when USC, sporting a full,
healthy lineup for the first time
this season, crushed the Bruins
5-1.
The return of USC's top hit
ters, Brian MacPhie and David

Eckerot, proved to be too much
for the Bruins last week. After
playing the Trojans in Los
Angeles, Cardinal coach Dick
Gould acknowledged the chal
lenge posed by the Trojan
squad. "If they have a full line
up, we will need to take advan
tage of every single opportuni
ty."
After the team's last
encounter with its southern
foes, Gould was confident the
Cardinal could improve enough
to give USC and UCLA a much
stronger challenge the second
time around.
"A lot can happen in two
weeks, and we're continuing to
improve at a greater rate than
they are," he said. "How far we
can close the gap remains to be
seen."
Today the Cardinal will find
out if it has, in fact, closed the
gap and risen to the most elite
