# Women's tennis travels to face USC, UCLA
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Stanford's 7-1 whirlwind tour
of the Pacific 10 Conference
South will come to an end this
weekend, as the No. 1 Cardinal
women's tennis team (21-2, 7-1
Pac-10 South) takes its game to
the smoggy confines of Los Ange
les to meet No. 5 USC and No. 13
UCLA.
Stanford will get a boost from
the predicted return of redshirt
freshman Kim Shasby to the
starting lineup. Shasby, ranked
No. 7 nationally in the latest
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion poll, plays No. 3 singles for
the Cardinal, and teams with
sophomore Amy Chiminello in
the No. 3 doubles spot. Shasby
has been hampered by a strained
foot muscle that has sidelined her
for four matches in the past two
weeks.
Chiminello, Stanford's No. 6
singles player, has also missed the
last two matches due to the flu.
Chiminello is ranked No. 94
nationally and holds a 17-1 indi
vidual match record, but she is
questionable for this weekend's
trip to Los Angeles. Junior Emma
Woodhouse filled in at the No. 5
spot last weekend, scoring two
straight-set victories against
Angela Bernal of Arizona and
Kara Schertzer of Arizona State,
and will likely play No. 6 this
weekend.
"There's such a thing as team
chemistry with us, and Amy is

important to that," said coach
Frank Brennan. "She's a real
leader out there — she's always
the one leading the troops into
battle and yelling for them to get
going."
In the two teams' meeting at
Stanford Tennis Stadium on
April 2, the Cardinal blanked
USC by a 7-0 score. No. 1 Laxmi
Poruri posted a decisive 6-0, 6-4
win over the Trojans' Petra
Schmitt, ranked No. 65 in the
country, and four other Stanford
players scored straight-set wins
to avoid doubles play and seal the
victory.
The Cardinal also made short
work of UCLA on April 3 at home,
defeating the Bruins 8-0. Five out
of six Stanford singles players
won straight-set matches, and in
four of those matches UCLA play
ers won two games or less. The
Bruins will finish the 1993 cam
paign with an uncharacteristic
losing record.
Stanford travels to Ojai, Calif.
Apr. 22 through 25 to compete in
the Pac-10 Championships, and
will have just over two weeks to
prepare for the 1993 NCAA
Championships, held in
Gainesville, Fla., May 12 through
20. The Cardinal will attempt to
knock off defending-national
champion and former-No. 1 Flori
da on its home court to recapture
the title Stanford held for six
straight years.
Cardinal Notes
Team captain Heather Willens and
Kim Shasby were selected to the eight

member 1993 USTA World University
Games team. Willens, the 1993 National
Collegiate Indoors Champion, and Shas
by, runner-up to Willens in that title

match, join California's Pam Nelson and
Indiana's Rachel Epstein on the women's
team that will play at the Games July 18
through 28 in Buffalo, N.Y.
