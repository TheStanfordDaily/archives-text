# Crew challenges Cal, rows in Big Regatta
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
For one of the few times this
season, the Stanford men's and
women's crews face difficult com
petition in a dual meet, as they
take on California at the Oakland
Estuary tomorrow.
Coming off a disappointing
showing two weeks ago at the San
Diego Crew Classic, the Cardinal
rowers must prove this weekend
that they have the intensity to
belong in the upper echelon of
national crew powers. Cal is cur
rently ranked second on the West
Coast, while the Stanford men are
ranked third.
"Cal has been extremely fast
this year," said men's coach Wies
law Kujda. "They are always fast
early in the season, but compared
to last year, they are five seconds
faster coming out of San Diego."
Because of the difficulties in
San Diego, Kujda decided to rest
the men's crew last weekend,
sending only the novice boat to
last Saturday's regatta at Red
wood Shores. Practice has been
much more focused, according to
Ki^jda.
Kujda has been experimenting
with rearranging the positions of

the rowers within the varsity and
junior-varsity boats, and he
believes both boats should be
faster this weekend because of the
changes.
The women's crew enters Sat
urday's race with a similar men
tality as the men. Because of tech
nical problems during the fall sea
son, including starting and steer
ing difficulties, the Cardinal
women haven't been able to legit
imately compare their times to
Cal.
"This is a hard time of the
year," said women's coach Wendy
Davis. "It's a combination of post
regatta letdown and adjusting to
daylight-saving time. We've been
in a dip, but now we're coming
out of it."
Although the women naturally
hope to come in first, a more real
istic goal for the team would be to
shave five or six seconds off their
previous times against Cal,
according to Davis. She has insti
tuted some technical changes,
concentrating on evening out the
skill level between the front and
back of the boats. These changes
should pay off later in the season,
but not necessarily this weekend.
Davis also said junior Kate Ste
ger is almost completely healed
from a back injury which occurred
during the off-season. Although
Steger is questionable for this week
end, she was able to make it

through a complete practice for the
first time this week.
An open-water course, the Oak
land Estuary presents some chal
lenges to the rowers. Although the
race officials attempt to start races
between tides, this does not always
happen. One lane will invariably have
an advantage because of the move
ment of the water, providing an extra
challenge for both (Cardinal squads.
