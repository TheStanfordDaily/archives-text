# Panel discusses Rodney King trial, riots
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
In anticipation of the federal
Rodney King beating-trial ver
dict, a tense crowd of more than
50 students and four panelists
gathered yesterday to discuss its
probable outcome and issues
surrounding last year's riots.
But despite the acute attention
that is currently focused on the
impending verdict, both stu
dents and panelists agreed that
the issues underlying the riots
are more significant than the
trial's outcome.
"We're waiting for the verdict
like it's really going to fix the
problems," said panelist Sally
Dickson, associate dean of the
Law School. "We must be care
ful and not get into the sound

bite approach that . . . tends to
cover up the real issues."
The "real issues," agreed the
panelists, are the widespread
poverty and unemployment that
plague inner cities, in addition
to the attitudes of police toward
the minorities who live there.
First-year law student and
South Central Los Angeles resi
dent Alma Medina, Assoc. Dean
of Memorial Church Floyd
Thompkins and Spanish and
Portuguese Prof. Sylvia Wynter
joined Dickson on the panel.
"There are all these wealthy
people worried, thinking, 'Peo
ple from South Central are
going to come out and riot in our
neighborhoods,' " Medina said.
"That's how we feel everyday."
Dickson, who is currently
teaching a course on the Los

Angeles riots, pointed out that
the only thing new about the
King beating case was that it
was captured on video and
played on national television.
According to Dickson, more
than 4,000 complaints of police
violence were filed against the
Los Angeles Police Department
in the four years preceding the
King case. But, she said, most
went unnoticed.
Thompkins said the basic
problem lies police officers' atti
tude toward blacks and minori
ties, which manifests itself in the
harassment of black and Latino
inner-city residents. He said it is
common for church pastors in
these areas to know of police vio
lence that goes unreported
because the victims "don't want
to mess with anybody."

Mistreatment by the police
forces blacks and Latinos to live
in constant fear that they will
somehow be hurt when officers
appear, Medina said.
"If you're sitting there talk
ing with one other person, that's
a gang," she said. "And that's
enough for them to harass you
and question why you're doing
whatever you're doing in your
own neighborhood."
While the panelists agreed
that there are immediate issues
that must be faced, they also
agreed that America's social and
economic system is the root of
the problem.
"This system says to 60 per
cent of blacks: 'You don't have
jobs, black man, so you get
crime,' " she said. "Poverty is
incurable within this system."
