# Ultimate treks to Banana Slug turf
## 
### Amy Howard Editorial staff 
The Stanford Men's Ulti
mate Team (SMUT) and the
Gals Ultimate Team of Stan
ford (GUTS) will journey to
Banana Slug territory this
weekend to compete in the Ulti
mate League Games (ULG) in
Santa Cruz. The Stanford men
(7-1), who were recently rated
No. 1 in the nation by the Ulti
mate Players Association
(UPA), look to continue their
preseason dominance.
"I pity anyone who must
play against us," said senior
team co-captain and Cincinatti
bred Ed Donovan. "I pity them,
and their mothers who will
have to stand up to their peers
and say, 'Yes, that poor cur
mudgeonly worthless-excuse
for-an-ultimate-player is my
son.' I pity them indeed."
Stanford's rise to the top of
the national rankings, which
are computed by the same sys
tem that the New York Times
uses to determine the college
football rankings, was consid
ered unexpected by many. After
the graduation of many key
players from last year's talent
ed squad, most thought the
men's ultimate team would be
competitive, but not nearly as
successful. But "Team Blood,"
as Stanford's team is affection
ately known, proved them
wrong.
"Like the legendary phoenix
of yore, we rose from the ashes
of decimation, with so much
glory and fortitude, to claim the
prize which is rightfully ours,"
said senior co-captain Wes
Williams.
With wins over Santa Bar
bara and Humboldt, Stanford
has shown itself worthy of its
No. 1 billing. The men-of-disk
also looked impressive in win
ning the Stanford Invitational,

one of the biggest and most
prestigious ultimate invitation
als in the country. In a battle of
the bodily fluids, the finals saw
Team Blood consume the Sea
men of UNC-Wilmington, 12-7.
However, the men's team
suffered a tragic blow soon
after, when they lost former
team co-captain Jeff Reed to
injury. Team Blood will have to
play without its spiritual leader
until nationals, and perhaps for
the rest of the season.
"Us losing Reed at this junc
ture is akin to a sparrow losing
its wings at the onset of winter,
finding itself bereft of the one
means which might carry it to
the comfort and safety of the
Southland," said Dave Dono
hue.
The women's ultimate team
has also been turning a lot of
heads in the preseason, scoring
a big victory over second
ranked Santa Barbara two
weekends ago. The women's
squad has been playing well of
late, according to team co-cap
tain Jen Donnelly, and has a
positive attitude going into this
weekend's competition.
"We're in a position to go to
nationals if we play to our
potential," said Donnelly. "We
have the right combination of
excited rookies and seasoned
veterans."
The women will look to
establish themselves in their
games on Saturday, which will
be against Davis, California and
Santa Cruz.
Owing to the paucity of West
Coast teams, every squad in the
League Games will advance to
sectionals, which are to be held
the following weekend in
Pleasanton. The league games
serve basically to determine the
seedings at sectionals.
