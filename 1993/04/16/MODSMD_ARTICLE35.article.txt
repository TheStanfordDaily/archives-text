# Volleyball hopes to keep Aztecs at bay
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
When a top-ranked team with nothing
to lose takes on a middle-of-the-road team
with everything to lose, the results may be
surprising. Tomorrow at 3 p.m. the third
ranked Stanford men's volleyball team
looks to avoid such a surprise as it hosts
the lOth-ranked San Diego State Aztecs.
Stanford (16-4, 14-3 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) has already
clinched the Pacific Division champi
onship of the MPSF and does not play its
next important match until the start of
the MPSF tournament on April 28.
San Diego State (15-11, 10-7) will enter
Burnham Pavilion looking for a new lease
on its volleyball season. After starting the
season slowly, the Aztecs have fought their
way to a tie for third in the Pacific Divi
sion. A win over Stanford would probably
assure SDSU a berth in the MPSF tourna
ment and a shot at the NCAA Final Four.
"They are fighting for their lives, while
we're trying to keep our momentum going
and work on our consistency from night to
night," said Stanford coach Ruben Nieves.
"To win the NCAA championship we're
going to have to put in a minimum of
three strong matches together back-to
back."
The Cardinal clobbered the Aztecs
when the teams met earlier this year at
San Diego State, 15-8, 5-15, 15-12, 15-6.
But last Saturday Stanford met a USC
team in the same situation and lost in
straight games.
Coach Nieves is looking forward to Sat
urday's match as a good warm-up for the
tournament.
"This is a real good rehearsal," he said.
"We're playing a good team; a team I
think should make it into the tournament
. . . this is the last time we'll play a team of
that caliber until April 28."

Like USC with Jason Mulholland, the
Aztecs play their best spiker at the swing
hitter position. John Hyden is seventh in
the country with a 6.27 kills-per-game
average, and also stands at 20th in the
nation with a .349 aces-per-game average.
"He is their top hitter," Nieves said.
"He's primarily a back-row hitter, but
he's not doing it at the opposite position."
The Aztec's two starting middle block
ers are Todd Yarbrough and John Ross.
Yarbrough is undersized for a middle
blocker at 6-foot-4, yet is still 19th in the
country with a .405 hitting percentage.
"He's got a big jump and a strong arm,"
Nieves said. "He's a pretty exciting player.
You'd think he would be overmatched in
the middle but he does real well."
According to Nieves, Ross is SDSU's
best overall player. The only player left
from the Aztecs' 1990, then ranked third
in the nation, Ross is the squad's leading
blocker, averaging 1.41 blocks per game.
Individually, Stanford players are in
the league's top-10 in almost every catego
ry kept by the MPSF. In hitting percent
age, sophomore Brian Garrett leads the
league with a .573 clip, while teammate
John Hribar is third, hitting .519.
Swing hitter Ryan Moos is sixth in the
league with .392 aces-per-game while his
teammate Bob Hillman is fifth with 2.38
digs-per-game. Finally, senior All-Ameri
can Dave Goss is fourth in the league,
averaging 6.91 kills-per-game and sixth in
digs-per-game, with 2.35.
Junior Joe Burghardt, who has been
battling a bad back all year, yet was still
leading the country in hitting percentage
until last week, landed on Jimmy Black
man's foot while warming up for last Fri
day's Long Beach State match and suf
fered a hairline fracture to his ankle.
"What we're shooting for with Joe is to
have him back and playing by the 28th (of
April)," Nieves said.
