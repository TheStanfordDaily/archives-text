The Stanford's men's golf team
.Taw, first hand, what it was like to
compete among the best teams of
the west at the Pasatiempo Golf
Club in Santa Cruz, Calif, on
Tuesday and Wednesday. The
squad played under beautiful con
ditions at the 47th Annual Far
Western Intercollegiate Invita
tional Tournament.
First-place honors in team
competition went to Oregon, who
scored 883 overall. San Jose State
followed with a score of 886,
Nevada-Reno finished at 888,
Kansas tallied 897 and California
shot 900. Stanford finished 12th
out of the 16-team field with a
score of 916.
All three top Cardinal golfers,
sophomores Steve Burdick, Dar
ren Dragovich and Jerry Chang,
placed in the top-50 in individual
competition. Burdick, the team's
most consistent player, finished
12th with 224 strokes. Dragovich
finished 27th with 227 strokes,
while Chang ended the tourna
ment in 42nd place with 232

shots.
Chang had finished the first
two rounds 20 strokes over par,
but then came back to shoot a 70
on the par-71 golf course in the
final round.
"I was really disappointed in the
first two rounds. Mentally, I just
wasn't there," Chang said. "That
night I did a lot of thinking and got
focused." It paid off, as his final
round was the best of the tourna
ment for any Stanford golfer.
Chang's eventual success mir
rored the progress of the rest of
the team. The Cardinal squad had
tough opening rounds, yet
improved in the final one. The
team scores for the first two
rounds were 312 and 308, respec
tively, while the team's final
round score dipped to 296, the
fourth best of any team that day.
"We improved each round,"
coach Wally Goodwin said.
"We've proved we can play. We
just have to put it together."
According to Goodwin, this
would mean having at least four
players on the squad playing up to
their potential in a tournament
simultaneously. "Right now we

just need a fourth or fifth player
to step up," Chang explained.
The team's opportunity to get
it together will come at the
Cupertino Inn U.S. Intercolle
giate Invitational Tournament
hosted by Stanford this weekend.
It will sport a field of some of the
best teams in the nation, includ
ing Oregon, California, Texas-El
Paso and San Jose State. The
tournament will take place on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday on
the Stanford Golf Course. One
round of golf will be played each
day, beginning at 8 a.m.
The U.S. Intercollegiate has
been hosted at Stanford since its
inception in 1978 and has tradi
tionally come just before the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships. The 16 competing teams
will be gearing up for Pac-lOs,
which will take place April 26
through 28.
"We're looking forward to
Stanford," Chang said. "It's bet
ter that these tournaments are so
close together because we're still
focused and feeling good and com
petitive from our last round at
Pasatiempo."
