## Dueling banjoes at house meetings and other titillating tasks Oh, the wonderful joys of dormcest

dorm • cest (dorm'sest) n.
Sexual or romantic practice
between persons who reside
within the same campus
housing facility.
Dormcest. Its mere men
tion should elicit a smirk.
A tear. Foaming at the
mouth. At least a giggle.
The notion of intra-dorm dat
ing is automatically associated
with both convenience and
messiness. Benefits and conse
quences. Inseparability and eter
nal bitterness.
In describing dormmates of
the respectively desired sex, peo
ple often say things like, "No
way, I couldn't go out with any
one in my dorm," or "We're all
like brothers and sisters."
This outlook can be said to be
the result of an informal taboo
against dating someone within
one's own residence.
"We had this 'buddy' thing
going, so it was taboo to bring it
up," said "Betty" explaining the
weeks it took before she and her
then neighbor/eventual boy
friend, admitted their mutual
attraction.
Thus, one can see, at least in
the campus vernacular, such an
idea exists. But is this avoidance
and/or disdain an inherent

response to the imposed famil
iarity? Is it pervasive?
"The evidence I have says it
(living together) won't make any
difference," said Prof. Arthur
Wolf, extrapolating from his
research on the cross-cultural
incest taboo. "If you don't bring
people together before the age of
three, it shouldn't have any
effect."
In fact, his experience has
pointed him in precisely the
opposite direction. Wolf spoke
anecdotally about a graduate
student he knew years ago who
became interested in the infor
mal dormcest taboo and began
studying it. After a few weeks of
observation, the graduate stu
dent had to give up the research
because, said Wolf, "the place
was a rabbit hutch."
This, along with the countless
examples of in-house romance
that are apparently unavoidable
(and often flaunted in the faces
of the whiny non-dating popula
tion), leads to the conclusion
that though the taboo is recog
nized, by no means does it stop
nature from sweeping students
along its sultry pheromonal
obstacle course.
In fact, that eligible 'others'
live in proximity should enhance
the chances of a romantic rela
tionship. According to the socio
logical and psychological concept
of propinquity, physical proximi

ty is one of the first filters for
mate selection. Those we live
with are those we tend to see
most often and, hence, spend our
time with.
After all, how are you sup
posed to hook up with someone if
you don't meet them? There are
some things even phone sex can't
do.
"I think one of the pleasant
things about dorms and relation
ships is sharing friends . . . more
shared activities," said William
Durham, professor of anthropol
ogy, director of the Human Biol
ogy Program and former resi
dent fellow of both Arroyo and
Toy on.
Many agree that the time
shared in a dorm setting provides
the framework for romantic deci
sion making.
"I need to get comfortable
with someone before going out
with them, and the dorm is most
conducive for that," noted
"Betty."
Furthermore, the conve
niences which result from living
together are seen as an addition
al benefit.
"People across campus will
have more problems of space and
time," said Durham.
"Daisy," who spent the better
part of her freshman year tango
ing with "Down-the-hall-
Donny," obviously saw this as a
convincing benefit.
"It can be absolutely fantastic,
and there is the potential for great
sex, because you don't have to
schedule it," she reminisced.
Nevertheless, there are sever
al obvious difficulties specific to
the maintaining of an in-dorm
relationship.
Herant Katchadourian, pro
fessor in the Human Biology
program remarked, "Such famil
iarity can counteract the more
unrealistic facades." He added
that an intense relationship in a
dorm setting, "might set them
apart from the rest of the
group."
The immediate reaction of
"Trevor" was a concern about
being overwhelmed by the con
tinuous presence of the partner.
"You need your own private
space every once in a while," he
winced.
Because a considerably
increased amount of time is
bound to be spent with one's
dormcestual partner, the fear
exists that the relationship will
get serious — potentially more
serious than originally intended.
Such romantic dissonance
could potentially lead to the most
feared aspect of an in-dorm rela

tionship — its demise. Said "Gal
lahad," "The problem is if you
break up . . . things become awk
ward."
In response to the prospect of
interactions after such a rela
tionship ended, Durham cupped
his face in his hands, "Oh yeah,
that could be a problem," he
laughed aloud. "The downside
consequences would show up at
the break-up." This is such a
concern because confrontations
between ex-partners are made
unavoidable by the same proxim
ity that brought the couple
together.
Whether students would
advise in favor or against in
dorm dating tends to be very
much dependent on their own
experiences. Based on the afore
mentioned informal student
interviews, it appears that those
whose relationships ended while
they still had to run their meal
card through the same line, or
keep their toothpaste in the
same cubby rack, argued most
strongly against it.
However, those whose rela
tionships either ended neatly
after their incidental cohabita
tion, or continued through to the
present, found the risks to be
worth it.
"Gallahad" for example,
whose love-fondue with "Gwen"
still rides strong, still felt that,
"If there's an obvious attraction,
that shouldn't be suppresseo,"
thus, lending truth to
Katchadourian's assertion that
"if people fall in love, they fall in
love."
Of the students questioned,
all agreed that the dormcest
taboo was a fallacy. The question
then arises: If the taboo is so
often transgressed, then why
should its legend persist?
One answer might be that che
taboo exists in order to provide
an excuse against risk-taking.
Perhaps the fear of the break up
could be the cause of the taboo
myth — keeping it alive as a pre
ventative agent or warning.
Maybe as students we still
haven't outgrown our adolescent
need for some kind of adversity
in order to make our relation
ships interesting. Since our par
ents aren't around to tell us our
attractive neighbors can't sleep
over, we create someone to hide
from.
Katchadourian suggested
that some students will continue
to be disinclined to engage in
such a relationship because they
feel the weight of the conse
quences more severely, and as a
result they keep the standard
going.
And so the paradox continues.
We say it shouldn't be done, yet
we still all know someone who's
boffing the boy next door.
No one can judge for certain
which is the way to go. Maybe it
is best to keep a distance.
Maybe one should wait until
marriage before seeing your
Neener-nubber before brushing
your teeth in the morning.
Then again, maybe it's best
to wait until marriage before
dating, period.

The notion of intra-dorm dat
ing is automatically associated
with both convenience and
messiness. Benefits and conse
quences. Inseparability and eter
nal bitterness.
In describing dormmates of
the respectively desired sex, peo
ple often say things like, "No
way, I couldn't go out with any
one in my dorm," or "We're all
like brothers and sisters."
This outlook can be said to be
the result of an informal taboo
against dating someone within
one's own residence.
"We had this 'buddy' thing
going, so it was taboo to bring it
up," said "Betty" explaining the
weeks it took before she and her
then neighbor/eventual boy
friend, admitted their mutual
attraction.
Thus, one can see, at least in
the campus vernacular, such an
idea exists. But is this avoidance
and/or disdain an inherent

response to the imposed famil
iarity? Is it pervasive?
"The evidence I have says it
(living together) won't make any
difference," said Prof. Arthur
Wolf, extrapolating from his
research on the cross-cultural
incest taboo. "If you don't bring
people together before the age of
three, it shouldn't have any
effect."
In fact, his experience has
pointed him in precisely the
opposite direction. Wolf spoke
anecdotally about a graduate
student he knew years ago who
became interested in the infor
mal dormcest taboo and began
studying it. After a few weeks of
observation, the graduate stu
dent had to give up the research
because, said Wolf, "the place
was a rabbit hutch."
This, along with the countless
examples of in-house romance
that are apparently unavoidable
(and often flaunted in the faces
of the whiny non-dating popula
tion), leads to the conclusion
that though the taboo is recog
nized, by no means does it stop
nature from sweeping students
along its sultry pheromonal
obstacle course.
In fact, that eligible 'others'
live in proximity should enhance
the chances of a romantic rela
tionship. According to the socio
logical and psychological concept
of propinquity, physical proximi

ty is one of the first filters for
mate selection. Those we live
with are those we tend to see
most often and, hence, spend our
time with.
After all, how are you sup
posed to hook up with someone if
you don't meet them? There are
some things even phone sex can't
do.
"I think one of the pleasant
things about dorms and relation
ships is sharing friends . . . more
shared activities," said William
Durham, professor of anthropol
ogy, director of the Human Biol
ogy Program and former resi
dent fellow of both Arroyo and
Toy on.
Many agree that the time
shared in a dorm setting provides
the framework for romantic deci
sion making.
"I need to get comfortable
with someone before going out
with them, and the dorm is most
conducive for that," noted
"Betty."
Furthermore, the conve
niences which result from living
together are seen as an addition
al benefit.
"People across campus will
have more problems of space and
time," said Durham.
"Daisy," who spent the better
part of her freshman year tango
ing with "Down-the-hall-
Donny," obviously saw this as a
convincing benefit.
"It can be absolutely fantastic,
and there is the potential for great
sex, because you don't have to
schedule it," she reminisced.
Nevertheless, there are sever
al obvious difficulties specific to
the maintaining of an in-dorm
relationship.
Herant Katchadourian, pro
fessor in the Human Biology
program remarked, "Such famil
iarity can counteract the more
unrealistic facades." He added
that an intense relationship in a
dorm setting, "might set them
apart from the rest of the
group."
The immediate reaction of
"Trevor" was a concern about
being overwhelmed by the con
tinuous presence of the partner.
"You need your own private
space every once in a while," he
winced.
Because a considerably
increased amount of time is
bound to be spent with one's
dormcestual partner, the fear
exists that the relationship will
get serious — potentially more
serious than originally intended.
Such romantic dissonance
could potentially lead to the most
feared aspect of an in-dorm rela

tionship — its demise. Said "Gal
lahad," "The problem is if you
break up . . . things become awk
ward."
In response to the prospect of
interactions after such a rela
tionship ended, Durham cupped
his face in his hands, "Oh yeah,
that could be a problem," he
laughed aloud. "The downside
consequences would show up at
the break-up." This is such a
concern because confrontations
between ex-partners are made
unavoidable by the same proxim
ity that brought the couple
together.
Whether students would
advise in favor or against in
dorm dating tends to be very
much dependent on their own
experiences. Based on the afore
mentioned informal student
interviews, it appears that those
whose relationships ended while
they still had to run their meal
card through the same line, or
keep their toothpaste in the
same cubby rack, argued most
strongly against it.
However, those whose rela
tionships either ended neatly
after their incidental cohabita
tion, or continued through to the
present, found the risks to be
worth it.
"Gallahad" for example,
whose love-fondue with "Gwen"
still rides strong, still felt that,
"If there's an obvious attraction,
that shouldn't be suppresseo,"
thus, lending truth to
Katchadourian's assertion that
"if people fall in love, they fall in
love."
Of the students questioned,
all agreed that the dormcest
taboo was a fallacy. The question
then arises: If the taboo is so
often transgressed, then why
should its legend persist?
One answer might be that che
taboo exists in order to provide
an excuse against risk-taking.
Perhaps the fear of the break up
could be the cause of the taboo
myth — keeping it alive as a pre
ventative agent or warning.
Maybe as students we still
haven't outgrown our adolescent
need for some kind of adversity
in order to make our relation
ships interesting. Since our par
ents aren't around to tell us our
attractive neighbors can't sleep
over, we create someone to hide
from.
Katchadourian suggested
that some students will continue
to be disinclined to engage in
such a relationship because they
feel the weight of the conse
quences more severely, and as a
result they keep the standard
going.
And so the paradox continues.
We say it shouldn't be done, yet
we still all know someone who's
boffing the boy next door.
No one can judge for certain
which is the way to go. Maybe it
is best to keep a distance.
Maybe one should wait until
marriage before seeing your
Neener-nubber before brushing
your teeth in the morning.
Then again, maybe it's best
to wait until marriage before
dating, period.
