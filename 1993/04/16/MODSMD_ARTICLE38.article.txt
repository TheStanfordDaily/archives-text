# Urchins, postdocs and other bio beasts
## 
### 
This is my final quarter as a Stanford
undergraduate. During the dwindling weeks
of this last spring of carefree youth, my
classmates are blithely taking road trips,
tanning, drinking and appearing naked (but
for a well-placed sock) in front of screaming
crowds.
Meanwhile, I am working frantically in the
lab, attempting to finish my honors thesis.
Now, you might think that the lives of
undergrad biologists are all glamor and glitz,
that we few proud are constantly enraptured
by the turgid thrill of discovery as we relent
lessly strain the taut borders of scientific
knowledge, intrepidly probing Mother
Nature's darkest recesses . . . Damn, that
therapy didn't do a bit of good.
Gratuitous Freudian innuendos aside, I
fear that those of you who — due to whatever
egregious misconception — believe that my
life is exciting, or in any way enviable, have
another thought coming. Here it comes: you
are dead wrong.
But why tell, gentle readers, when I can
show? Let me share a little bit of my life with
you, and describe in lurid detail just what it is
that I do. No, don't be afraid; I won't use any
words that my dear grandmother (who, being
from Kentucky, does speak English — after a
fashion) wouldn't understand.
In rough outline, it's pretty simple:
Whenever I am not in class or asleep, I go to
the lab and do experiments. Each experi
ment lasts for one or two weeks, and at the
end of this interval I develop a crucial bit of
X-ray film and realize that the experiment
has failed.
The grad students and postdocs in my lab,
when I approach them for advice, nod sagely

at my bits of film and mutter unprintable
arcanities about the causes of my failure. I
thank them and go home to curl up in the
fetal position. When I leave the room, they
nod sagely at each other.
"Undergraduate," they say in chorus.
At one point or another, all of them have
suggested that I pursue a career in journal
ism. They seem unconcerned about the poten
tial havoc such encouragement might wreak
on my self-esteem.
Once in a while a man called my "research
advisor" comes and asks me whether I. have
any data. I tell him I do not. He sighs and asks
how my work for the newspaper is going.
The details of the experiments I do are
irrelevant to the above rough outline: When
an experiment fails, I do it again. If it fails
twice, I do another kind of experiment. Third
verse, same as the first.
Nonetheless, there are some aspects of my
lab work which you might find interesting, or
at least grimly fascinating, like that trick
some little kids do where they turn their eye
lids inside out.
I work with sea urchins. I have a big tank
full of them in a storage closet in the lab.
The urchins resemble small beige pincush

ions, the principal difference being that pin
cushions are smarter. Most of the time they
sit at the bottom of the tank, placidly
munching on the seaweed I feed them. Once
I forgot to give them seaweed for a while and
they placidly munched on each other.
My particular experiments involve the
urchins' sperm and eggs, with which they do
not part willingly. Ergo, I must extract them
by guile.
I assure you that this process involves
nothing so simple as patiently stroking sensi
tive parts of the urchins' anatomy (there
aren't any) — while, perhaps, subjecting
them to some bizarre undersea pornography
(they have no eyes).
No indeed. Rather, following the strict
instructions of the scholarly literature, I turn
them upside-down and ram a hypodermic nee
dle through a soft spot near the mouth, soon
thereafter injecting a fairly large volume of a
concentrated salt solution into their viscera. If
they do not respond immediately to these gen
tle caresses, I proceed to shake them vigorous
ly. For some reason (unreported in the sage
journals from which I gleaned this technique)
such treatment excites them — males and
females alike — to the point of ejaculation.
Even though you didn't ask and probably
don't want to know, I will tell you right now
that a single male urchin, smaller than a
baby'B hand, can fill half a drinking glass with
semen.
There are some things that human eyes
were never meant to see.
