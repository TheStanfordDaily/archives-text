# Landslide victory for Clean Slate
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Michael Slemmer Staff writers 
The Council of Presidents is
back.
"A Clean Slate" stormed into
office last night as the ASSU elec
tions ended, claiming a landslide
victory and restoring the COP
after one year in absentia.
As the only slate officially
placed on this year's ballot, Clean
Slate — consisting of juniors Ron
Brown, Delia Lopez, Jason Snyder
and Ying-Ying Goh — garnered
over 80 percent of the popular
vote, easily outdistancing the up
start write-in candidate, "A Blank
Slate." Clean Slate has promised
not to accept a salary for their ef
forts next year.
"We've made the COP legiti
mate," Lopez said.
"It's an honor to be elected by
the students," Brown said. "It is a
signal that students have hope
that the ASSU can improve to
serve them better." He vowed that
"Over the course of the year we
will make sure that happens."
Blank Slate entered the race for
COP last week with an aggressive
and highly publicized campaign
pledging to disband the office for a
second straight year.
But those hoping for an encore
performance of last year's elec
tion-night drama, when "I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" narrowly tri
umphed over the "Independents:
A New Era" slate, were left disap
pointed. Blank Slate staggered to
the finish a defeated second, with
just 435 of the 3,686 total votes for
COP. Clean Slate received 3,000
votes.
"As a write-in campaign, it was
obviously difficult for us to have a
chance," Blank Slate member
Jeremy Nelson said.
Despite the loss, Blank Slate
members remained in high spirits.
"We hope we brought some enjoy
ment to the rest of the campus,"
Nelson said after the final returns
were announced. "We're glad for
Clean Slate — if they want to be
slave laborers for a year, well, God
bless them."
Blank Slate members argued,
with at least some seriousness,
that without their slate name visi
ble on the ballot, their chances of
challenging Clean Slate were, from
the start, slim. Further, the apa
thetic voters the slate targeted as
their constituency were in some
respects Blank's own worst enemy:
Those students most willing to
forgo a COP are generally those
least willing to vote.
Last spring, Brown, Goh and
Snyder ran for COP on the Inde
pendent slate but were defeated by
Prefer, which successfully dis
solved the office for one year.
Despite their convincing victo
ry, both Brown and Goh acknowl
edged that Blank Slate's rise to
prominence in the campaign shows
that larger currents of student dis
illusionment with the ASSU still
run deep.
"This will be a crucial year,"
Brown said. "Even though the
margin of victory was large, there
was a significant number of stu
dents that did vote for Blank Slate,
people who thought student gov
ernment isn't serving them at all."
Had Blank Slate appeared as an
official candidate, Goh said,
"things could have been different."
Goh said Blank Slate's presence
"helped to really define a lot of our
goals; they made us think about
student apathy."
She added that such sentiments
are "dangerous" and the Clean Slate
will "make sure we address them."
Indeed, the slate immediately
pledged to reconsider the very
structure of the ASSU. "The only
way to change the ASSU is to iden
tify the sources of student discon
tent," Brown said. He said that
Clean Slate will actively solicit stu

dent opinion on how, and in what
form, the association can operate
most effectively.
But ASSU Deputy Senate Chair
Derek Miyahara said the electorate
has reverted to "business as usual."
"Whether the downward spiral
of student support happens again
depends on what the COP does next
year," Miyahara said. "If they do
well, the students will forget that
little was accomplished this year."
Last night's results also high
lighted the growing rift between
graduate students and the ASSU:
only six official graduate candi
dates ran for senate this election,
clearing the way for 14 write-in
members.
Sanford Dickert, a graduate
senator who was re-elected last
night, said "my mandate is to find
a way to have graduate senators
better represented."
"The question is whether the
ASSU is the place for graduate rep
resentation," he said. Dickert
vowed that a constitutional
amendment proposing a shakeup
of the graduate student body's
relationship with the ASSU will be
on next April's ballot.
Capitalizing on a shrewd cam
paign centered around the slogan
"Milk the Vote," sophomore
Roberto Milk topped the list of
vote-getters for undergraduate
senate with a whopping 1,151 tal
lies. "With the aid of Clean Slate,
the senate will have strong legislat
ing abilities," he predicted.
With just 30 candidates official
ly running for office and no true
suspense in the COP race, the
ASSU offices were uncharacteristi
cally subdued throughout the
evening.
However, both COP slates were
reprimanded by Hearings Com
missioner Greg Gilchrist for illegal
campaigning.
A flyer for Clean Slate was
found in a classroom in Term an
Engineering Center yesterday, a
violation of the election ban on
advertising in classrooms and labo
ratories.
Blank Slate, meanwhile, was
warned of a rules infraction when
three members of the slate

computer cluster wearing flyers on
their heads shortly before the

been filed, the winner of the tied
races will be picked.
In addition, the senate stand
ings could change slightly because
up to 42 ballots from students at
foreign campuses still have to be
counted.
In all, independent candidates
won a total of 10 senate seats, Peo
ple's Platform took nine spots, and
the Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition as well as the League of
East Lag RCCs captured one seat
apiece. There are 19 unaffiliated
senators.

"A Clean Slate" stormed into
office last night as the ASSU elec
tions ended, claiming a landslide
victory and restoring the COP
after one year in absentia.
As the only slate officially
placed on this year's ballot, Clean
Slate — consisting of juniors Ron
Brown, Delia Lopez, Jason Snyder
and Ying-Ying Goh — garnered
over 80 percent of the popular
vote, easily outdistancing the up
start write-in candidate, "A Blank
Slate." Clean Slate has promised
not to accept a salary for their ef
forts next year.
"We've made the COP legiti
mate," Lopez said.
"It's an honor to be elected by
the students," Brown said. "It is a
signal that students have hope
that the ASSU can improve to
serve them better." He vowed that
"Over the course of the year we
will make sure that happens."
Blank Slate entered the race for
COP last week with an aggressive
and highly publicized campaign
pledging to disband the office for a
second straight year.
But those hoping for an encore
performance of last year's elec
tion-night drama, when "I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" narrowly tri
umphed over the "Independents:
A New Era" slate, were left disap
pointed. Blank Slate staggered to
the finish a defeated second, with
just 435 of the 3,686 total votes for
COP. Clean Slate received 3,000
votes.
"As a write-in campaign, it was
obviously difficult for us to have a
chance," Blank Slate member
Jeremy Nelson said.
Despite the loss, Blank Slate
members remained in high spirits.
"We hope we brought some enjoy
ment to the rest of the campus,"
Nelson said after the final returns
were announced. "We're glad for
Clean Slate — if they want to be
slave laborers for a year, well, God
bless them."
Blank Slate members argued,
with at least some seriousness,
that without their slate name visi
ble on the ballot, their chances of
challenging Clean Slate were, from
the start, slim. Further, the apa
thetic voters the slate targeted as
their constituency were in some
respects Blank's own worst enemy:
Those students most willing to
forgo a COP are generally those
least willing to vote.
Last spring, Brown, Goh and
Snyder ran for COP on the Inde
pendent slate but were defeated by
Prefer, which successfully dis
solved the office for one year.
Despite their convincing victo
ry, both Brown and Goh acknowl
edged that Blank Slate's rise to
prominence in the campaign shows
that larger currents of student dis
illusionment with the ASSU still
run deep.
"This will be a crucial year,"
Brown said. "Even though the
margin of victory was large, there
was a significant number of stu
dents that did vote for Blank Slate,
people who thought student gov
ernment isn't serving them at all."
Had Blank Slate appeared as an
official candidate, Goh said,
"things could have been different."
Goh said Blank Slate's presence
"helped to really define a lot of our
goals; they made us think about
student apathy."
She added that such sentiments
are "dangerous" and the Clean Slate
will "make sure we address them."
Indeed, the slate immediately
pledged to reconsider the very
structure of the ASSU. "The only
way to change the ASSU is to iden
tify the sources of student discon
tent," Brown said. He said that
Clean Slate will actively solicit stu

dent opinion on how, and in what
form, the association can operate
most effectively.
But ASSU Deputy Senate Chair
Derek Miyahara said the electorate
has reverted to "business as usual."
"Whether the downward spiral
of student support happens again
depends on what the COP does next
year," Miyahara said. "If they do
well, the students will forget that
little was accomplished this year."
Last night's results also high
lighted the growing rift between
graduate students and the ASSU:
only six official graduate candi
dates ran for senate this election,
clearing the way for 14 write-in
members.
Sanford Dickert, a graduate
senator who was re-elected last
night, said "my mandate is to find
a way to have graduate senators
better represented."
"The question is whether the
ASSU is the place for graduate rep
resentation," he said. Dickert
vowed that a constitutional
amendment proposing a shakeup
of the graduate student body's
relationship with the ASSU will be
on next April's ballot.
Capitalizing on a shrewd cam
paign centered around the slogan
"Milk the Vote," sophomore
Roberto Milk topped the list of
vote-getters for undergraduate
senate with a whopping 1,151 tal
lies. "With the aid of Clean Slate,
the senate will have strong legislat
ing abilities," he predicted.
With just 30 candidates official
ly running for office and no true
suspense in the COP race, the
ASSU offices were uncharacteristi
cally subdued throughout the
evening.
However, both COP slates were
reprimanded by Hearings Com
missioner Greg Gilchrist for illegal
campaigning.
A flyer for Clean Slate was
found in a classroom in Term an
Engineering Center yesterday, a
violation of the election ban on
advertising in classrooms and labo
