### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
The grass will be a lot greener
tomorrow, when Bay Area Earth
Day comes to Stanford.
The day-long event, to be
held in Frost Amphitheater and
on Angell Field, will feature of
celebrity speakers and perform
ers, including Hep. Anna Eshoo
and folk singer Michelle
Shocked. In addition, nearly
150 environmental and commu
nity groups will set up informa
tional booths on a wide range of
issues.
A coalition of Bay Area envi
ronmental groups, including Stu
dents for Environmental Action
at Stanford, is hosting the annual
event. Michael Cohen, a SEAS co
ordinator, said he expects 5,000
people to attend at least part of
the day's festivities.
Events begin in Frost at 9:30
a.m. and last until 6 p.m. Eshoo
will speak at 3:15 p.m. and
Shocked will perform immediate
ly afterwards.
In addition, selections from
works by the late Wallace Stegner,
a Stanford English professor

emeritus and Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author, will be read through
out the day. Stegner, who was
originally scheduled to speak and
sign books at the event, died late
Tuesday night from injuries suf
fered in an automobile accident
March 28.
Other speakers and entertain
ers include the Earth Circus Per
formance Troupe, Donald Aitkin
of the Union of Concerned Scien
tists and an "Eco Rap" music
group.
While speakers and performers
take the stage at Frost, across the
street 150 environmental and
community organizations repre
senting a "wide range of issues"
will set up booths on Angell Field
and the adjacent eucalyptus
grove, according to Cohen.
The area will be divided into 10
regions, each with a different
theme. For example, one area will
focus on "Business, Technology
and the Environment," while an
other will highlight "The Clean
and Green Home." One section
will be geared specifically toward
children.
