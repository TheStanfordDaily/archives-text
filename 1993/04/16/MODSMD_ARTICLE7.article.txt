# Fac Sen revises University copyright policy
##

Yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting
was shorter than an Econ. 1 lecture.
Despite the fact that "spring fever
has set in," as Senate Chair Prof.
William Northway said, the 30 sena
tors present managed in 45 minutes to
revise the University's copyright policy
regarding independent research.
The senate passed a resolution that
puts computer programs and course
work in the same category as books, pa
pers, music pieces or other creative

works, according to civil engineering
Prof. Boyd Paulson.
According to Paulson, chair of the
Committee on Academic Computing
and Information Services, the resolu
tion allows work produced by faculty or
students using University resources —
specifically computers — to be copy
righted to the individual.
This change does not affect copy
right policies regarding sponsored re
search, which are subject to individual
guidelines, Paulson said after the
meeting.
The changes to one of the Universi

ty's Administrative Guide Memos add
the words "computer software" and
"courseware" to the section that al
ready deals with such independently
produced creative works as books and
articles, according to Paulson.
The policy applies only to faculty
members and students of the Universi
ty, Paulson explained. University staff
are considered hired workers and have
a different set of guidelines.
The change was proposed because
present policy is outdated, Paulson said
at the April 8 senate meeting.
When the original policy was applied

in the 1950s and '60s, any independent
work done on computers required "the
expensive use of computer resources"
that only the University owned, Paul
son said last week.
Today, however, since most faculty
and students have access to their own
computers, any use of University re
sources is "incidental," he said.
Questions about copyright still
might arise regarding independent re
search only if the researcher uses sig
nificant amounts of University re-
