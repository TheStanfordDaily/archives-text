Richard White, Jr. shows that
though their numbers are smaller
than usually believed, the problems of
the homeless are greater and more
complex â€”mental illness, substance
abuse, and serious emotional distur
bance are the norm rather than the
exception. He outlines solutions that
respect the differences among the
homeless and that ultimately will help
them to govern their own lives.
Joel Blau argues that current gov
ernment policies at every level are
mired in pointless headcounting and
quick-fix solutions that only push the
homeless out of sight without touching
the underlying causes. He advocates
social reforms ranging from a national
standard for welfare benefits, a higher
minimum wage, and establishment of
a social sector for non-profit, afford
able housing.
We hope you will join us for a spirited debate on
this pressing national issue.
