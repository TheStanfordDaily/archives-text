# Men's gymnasts repeat as NCAA champs
## Season-long mission ends in perfection 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -
No questions, no doubts, no
fears.
Such was the mindset of the
Stanford men's gymnastics
team, which proved itself the
best in the country for the sec
ond year in a row at Saturday's
NCAA Championships. The
Cardinal outscored Nebraska
and Ohio State 276.5-275.5-
274.05 to clinch the national
title.
"We really did fantastic
today," said coach Sadao
Hamada, who earned the dis
tinction of National Coach of
the Year by virtue of the team
championship. "Our focus and
concentration level was key.
That was the major thing that
helped us to win the meet."
In the individual event finals
later that night, senior Jair
Lynch captured first place on
parallel bars as well as fifth on
floor exercise. Sophomore Jing-
Wei Liang's pommel horse rou
tine merited a second-place tro
phy, while sophomore Josh
Stein tied for fourth on floor.

placing in the top six in the individ
ual event finals.
A number of shaky Cardinal per
formances in Friday night's prelim
inary competition led to a third
place team finish. Yet while both
Nebraska and Ohio State managed
to outscore Stanford during this
first session, the Cardinal came out
ahead of the other three contenders
— Oklahoma, Minnesota and Illi
nois — to earn a spot in the team
finals.
Minnesota's John Roethlisberg
er secured the individual all-around
title on Friday night for the third
consecutive year. He was followed
by Chainey Umphrey of UCLA and
Nebraska's Dennis Harrison.
Lynch, Stanford's highest scoring
all-around competitor, finished
ninth, while Liang finished 11th.
While Stanford had hoped for
higher all-around individual finish
es, qualifying for the team finals
was clearly the Cardinal's main con
cern during the first night of compe
tition.
"All we wanted to do last night
was to place in the top three," Lynch
said on Saturday. "Other people
wanted me to concentrate on all
around, but the team championship
was what we came in to win."
From the outset of Saturday's
competition, Hamada and his Car
dinal squad appeared certain they
would be named back-to-back
champions. The team derived this
sense of security by trusting in
Hamada's overall plan, a scheme
which he implemented at the begin
ning of the season.
"One of the keys to our win was
my overall strategy for the season,"
Hamada said. "Especially my strat
egy over the past two days — who to
put in, the orders, which tricks to
throw and not to throw."
The plan revolved around the
new scoring system, which included
a drop in the base score from 9.50 on
Friday to a 9.00 on Saturday. Under
this system, the gymnasts start

with a lower beginning score to
which points are added according to
the difficulty of their routines.
"I prepared my guys according to
the 9.0 rule," Hamada said. "All the
guys were fighting for 9. Is and 9.25.
I needed 9.45, 9.5 sand 9.6s from my
big guns — guys like Lynch, Liang
and [Jeff] Bender."
Despite a team total of 12 misses
on Friday, Stanford's third-place
finish did not damper either Hama
da's or the team's faith that its sea
son goal would be realized the next
day.
While junior co-captain and all
around competitor Mark Booth's
injury in the Western Regionals
threw an unexpected kink in the
plan, Hamada adjusted his strategy
by activating two gymnasts in
Booth's place.
"I was absolutely confident
about Saturday," said junior Jason
Cohen. "I didn't have a single doubt
in my mind. I think we decided our
selves that we were champions,
thought like we were champions
and competed as champions — that
made it a reality."
Starting the team finals on the
rings, the Cardinal took the lead at
the end of the first rotation and held
the advantage throughout the
entire competition. After three rota
tions, Stanford had pulled out near
ly 1 172 points ahead of Ohio State
and two points ahead of Nebraska.
"After three events, we saw that
we were a point ahead and I knew
that we were going to pull away,"
Lynch said.
Lynch led the way on Saturday
with a showing of 8.90 on rings, 9.40
on floor and parallel bars, 9.45 on
high bar, and 9.50 on the pommel
horse along with his 9.60 vaulting
score.
On Thursday night, he was
named a Nissen Award nominee, an
honor voted on by the coaches
which goes to the nation's best
senior gymnasts.
While Lynch did not place as
high in Friday's all-around competi
tion as many expected, he did score

well enough to qualify for the indi
vidual finals in three events — floor,
parallel bars and high bar.
Liang also turned in a powerful
all-around performance, pulling
through on both nights despite a
nagging ankle injury. Bender came
through as Stanford's third all
arounder in the finals, after a some
what inconsistent showing the day
before.
"I felt a lot of pressure (Friday),"
Bender said. "I went into every
event trying too hard. Today I made
a conscious effort to calm myself
down, especially on pommel horse."
While the three all-around par
ticipants provided the crucial points
necessary to grasp the title, victory
would not have come without the
contributions of Stein, Cohen and
junior Chris Sey.
In the preliminaries, Stein dis
played a floor routine which earned
him a 9.775, good enough to qualify
him for the individual finals, where
he scored a 9.20. He added solid per
formances on the pommel horse,
vault and floor.
Cohen also proved himself a
valuable member of the Cardinal
squad on high bar, vault, rings and
floor.
Is is doubtful whether this week
end would have ended the way it did
without the efforts of Sey, who filled
Booth's spot in all events except for
rings. Planning to redshirt this sea
son while recovering from a broken
back, Sey started serious training
four weeks ago.
Sey pulled through for the Cardi
nal in the team finals with especial
ly strong showings on floor, vault
and high bar.
"I felt really good about my per
formance," Sey said. "I went seven
for nine and couldn't have asked for
more, especially on the high bar and
the floor."
Senior Shawn Adamek, perform
ing last on the pommel horse, deliv
ered a typically strong routine in the
team finals.
Rounding out the Stanford line
up were two of the squad's first-year

members. Freshman Peter Hegi
proved consistent under pressure,
hitting his ring and high bar rou
tines, which provided crucial points
in both events.
Classmate Andrew Manson also

came through for the Cardinal in
the first meet of his collegiate career
with a score of 9.50 on the rings.
Entering the competition as the
defending national champion, the
Stanford squad did not let the added

pressure for a repeat performance
influence it this weekend.
"The slate is clean and our wins
are at zero," Lynch said at a press
conference the day before the pre
liminaries.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -
No questions, no doubts, no
fears.
Such was the mindset of the
Stanford men's gymnastics
team, which proved itself the
best in the country for the sec
ond year in a row at Saturday's
NCAA Championships. The
Cardinal outscored Nebraska
and Ohio State 276.5-275.5-
274.05 to clinch the national
title.
"We really did fantastic
today," said coach Sadao
Hamada, who earned the dis
tinction of National Coach of
the Year by virtue of the team
championship. "Our focus and
concentration level was key.
That was the major thing that
helped us to win the meet."
In the individual event finals
later that night, senior Jair
Lynch captured first place on
parallel bars as well as fifth on
floor exercise. Sophomore Jing-
Wei Liang's pommel horse rou
tine merited a second-place tro
phy, while sophomore Josh
Stein tied for fourth on floor.

placing in the top six in the individ
ual event finals.
A number of shaky Cardinal per
formances in Friday night's prelim
inary competition led to a third
place team finish. Yet while both
Nebraska and Ohio State managed
to outscore Stanford during this
first session, the Cardinal came out
ahead of the other three contenders
— Oklahoma, Minnesota and Illi
nois — to earn a spot in the team
finals.
Minnesota's John Roethlisberg
er secured the individual all-around
title on Friday night for the third
consecutive year. He was followed
by Chainey Umphrey of UCLA and
Nebraska's Dennis Harrison.
Lynch, Stanford's highest scoring
all-around competitor, finished
ninth, while Liang finished 11th.
While Stanford had hoped for
higher all-around individual finish
es, qualifying for the team finals
was clearly the Cardinal's main con
cern during the first night of compe
tition.
"All we wanted to do last night
was to place in the top three," Lynch
said on Saturday. "Other people
wanted me to concentrate on all
around, but the team championship
was what we came in to win."
From the outset of Saturday's
competition, Hamada and his Car
dinal squad appeared certain they
would be named back-to-back
champions. The team derived this
sense of security by trusting in
Hamada's overall plan, a scheme
which he implemented at the begin
ning of the season.
"One of the keys to our win was
my overall strategy for the season,"
Hamada said. "Especially my strat
egy over the past two days — who to
put in, the orders, which tricks to
throw and not to throw."
The plan revolved around the
new scoring system, which included
a drop in the base score from 9.50 on
Friday to a 9.00 on Saturday. Under
this system, the gymnasts start

with a lower beginning score to
which points are added according to
the difficulty of their routines.
"I prepared my guys according to
the 9.0 rule," Hamada said. "All the
guys were fighting for 9. Is and 9.25.
I needed 9.45, 9.5 sand 9.6s from my
big guns — guys like Lynch, Liang
and [Jeff] Bender."
Despite a team total of 12 misses
on Friday, Stanford's third-place
finish did not damper either Hama
da's or the team's faith that its sea
son goal would be realized the next
day.
While junior co-captain and all
around competitor Mark Booth's
injury in the Western Regionals
threw an unexpected kink in the
plan, Hamada adjusted his strategy
by activating two gymnasts in
Booth's place.
"I was absolutely confident
about Saturday," said junior Jason
Cohen. "I didn't have a single doubt
in my mind. I think we decided our
selves that we were champions,
thought like we were champions
and competed as champions — that
made it a reality."
Starting the team finals on the
rings, the Cardinal took the lead at
the end of the first rotation and held
the advantage throughout the
entire competition. After three rota
tions, Stanford had pulled out near
ly 1 172 points ahead of Ohio State
and two points ahead of Nebraska.
"After three events, we saw that
we were a point ahead and I knew
that we were going to pull away,"
Lynch said.
Lynch led the way on Saturday
with a showing of 8.90 on rings, 9.40
on floor and parallel bars, 9.45 on
high bar, and 9.50 on the pommel
horse along with his 9.60 vaulting
score.
On Thursday night, he was
named a Nissen Award nominee, an
honor voted on by the coaches
which goes to the nation's best
senior gymnasts.
While Lynch did not place as
high in Friday's all-around competi
tion as many expected, he did score

well enough to qualify for the indi
vidual finals in three events — floor,
parallel bars and high bar.
Liang also turned in a powerful
all-around performance, pulling
through on both nights despite a
nagging ankle injury. Bender came
through as Stanford's third all
arounder in the finals, after a some
what inconsistent showing the day
before.
"I felt a lot of pressure (Friday),"
Bender said. "I went into every
event trying too hard. Today I made
a conscious effort to calm myself
down, especially on pommel horse."
While the three all-around par
ticipants provided the crucial points
necessary to grasp the title, victory
would not have come without the
contributions of Stein, Cohen and
junior Chris Sey.
In the preliminaries, Stein dis
played a floor routine which earned
him a 9.775, good enough to qualify
him for the individual finals, where
he scored a 9.20. He added solid per
formances on the pommel horse,
vault and floor.
Cohen also proved himself a
valuable member of the Cardinal
squad on high bar, vault, rings and
floor.
Is is doubtful whether this week
end would have ended the way it did
without the efforts of Sey, who filled
Booth's spot in all events except for
rings. Planning to redshirt this sea
son while recovering from a broken
back, Sey started serious training
four weeks ago.
Sey pulled through for the Cardi
nal in the team finals with especial
ly strong showings on floor, vault
and high bar.
"I felt really good about my per
formance," Sey said. "I went seven
for nine and couldn't have asked for
more, especially on the high bar and
the floor."
Senior Shawn Adamek, perform
ing last on the pommel horse, deliv
ered a typically strong routine in the
team finals.
Rounding out the Stanford line
up were two of the squad's first-year

members. Freshman Peter Hegi
proved consistent under pressure,
hitting his ring and high bar rou
tines, which provided crucial points
in both events.
Classmate Andrew Manson also

came through for the Cardinal in
the first meet of his collegiate career
with a score of 9.50 on the rings.

defending national champion, the
Stanford squad did not let the added

pressure for a repeat performance
