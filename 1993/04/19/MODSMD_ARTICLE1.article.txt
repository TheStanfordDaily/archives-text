ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -
No questions, no doubts, no
fears.
Such was the mindset of the
Stanford men's gymnastics
team, which proved itself the
best in the country for the sec
ond year in a row at Saturday's
NCAA Championships. The
Cardinal outscored Nebraska
and Ohio State 276.5-275.5-
274.05 to clinch the national
title.
"We really did fantastic
today," said coach Sadao
Hamada, who earned the dis
tinction of National Coach of
the Year by virtue of the team
championship. "Our focus and
concentration level was key.
That was the major thing that
helped us to win the meet."
In the individual event finals
later that night, senior Jair
Lynch captured first place on
parallel bars as well as fifth on
floor exercise. Sophomore Jing-
Wei Liang's pommel horse rou
tine merited a second-place tro
phy, while sophomore Josh
Stein tied for fourth on floor.
Lynch, Liang and Stein each
earned Ail-American honors by
