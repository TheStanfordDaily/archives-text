Peace after King verdict
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Churchgoers
rejoiced at the calm after the verdict in
the federal Rodney King beating trial

hard to believe, stayed out in force, but
the sheriffs office resumed regular
shifts in outlying areas.
Cries of "Amen" rippled through the
First AME Church congregation as Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Gov. Pete
Wilson and others lauded the convic
tions of two officers.
U.S. destroys Iraqi radar
WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S. war
plane destroyed an Iraqi radar tracking
site south of the no-fly zone over northern

Iraq yesterday after the aircraft was
threatened, a Defense Department
spokesman said.
The plane, one of two on a routine
monitoring patrol in the zone, was not
fired on, but "the crew felt threatened,"
said DOD spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Brian
Cullin.
White House spokeswoman Lorraine
Voles said the action "is consistent with
our policy that when our forces feel
threatened, we're going to respond."
Both aircraft safely returned to their
operating base at Incirlik, Turkey.
Iraq's official news agency reported
three Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the
incident. The Iraqi News Agency, moni
tored in Cyprus, quoted a Foreign Min
istry spokesman as saying the attack was
provocative, hostile behavior.
