# Srebrenica surrenders to Serb siege

TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) â€”
Srebrenica's defenders caved in to a
relentless Serb siege yesterday and
signed a truce that permits aid and
evacuations, but amounts to a virtual
surrender of the strategic Muslim town.
Many of Srebrenica's fighters resent
ed the agreement, and it was unclear if
the cease-fire would last. Scores of
truces in the Bosnian war have col
lapsed over the past year.
It would be the Bosnian govern
ment's biggest capitulation in the year
long war and underlines the weak posi
tion of the outgunned government
forces against the Serbs and Croats who
have seized most of the state.
Serbs are driving for control of east
ern Bosnia to connect the region with
adjacent Serbia and other Serb-held
areas of Bosnia and Croatia and create a
"Greater Serbia." Only two other Mus
lim enclaves, Gorazde and Zepa, remain

in eastern Bosnia.
Just hours after Serbs and the Mus
lim-led Bosnian forces signed the truce,
130 Canadian U.N. peacekeeping troops
entered the town to a hero's welcome,
said ham radio operators.
Crowds mobbed the peacekeepers' 22
armored personnel carriers and 19
trucks and hugged and kissed the sol
diers.
French and British helicopters then
began ferrying sick and wounded to
Tuzla, under an agreement permitting
airborne evacuation of the 500 most
desperate cases before an overland evac
uation starts for all those who want to
leave the town.
U.N. officials said 133 people were
evacuated by nightfall yesterday, and
the helicopters would continue their
mission over the next few days.
Tuzla, 45 miles northwest of Sre
brenica, is already overflowing with an

estimated 60,000 refugees from the
Serb drive in eastern Bosnia. There are
up to 60,000 more in Srebrenica.
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, pledged to honor terms of the
Srebrenica agreement.
But in an irate reaction to the U.N.
Security Council's decision Saturday to
impose new sanctions on Serbian-domi
nated Yugoslavia, he threatened to boy
cott further U.N.-sponsored peace talks.
One of the peace mediators, Britain's
Lord Owen, said yesterday he believes
sanctions alone are not sufficient to
stop the Serbs and reiterated his sug
gestion that military intervention may
be necessary.
U.S., German and French military
planes yesterday airdropped about 60
tons of food and medical supplies over
Srebrenica. The airdrop has been con
centrating on that besieged area in
recent days.
