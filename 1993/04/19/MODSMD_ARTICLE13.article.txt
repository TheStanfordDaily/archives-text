## A 						grad student COP 
### 
A second COP for grad
students could address
their needs, complaints

According to figures
released by the Registrar's
Office at the beginning of
this academic year, at Stanford
there are 6,564 undergraduate stu
dents, 6,549 graduate students
and 780 terminal graduate stu
dents.
But listening to the incessant
whining of some graduate students
active in the ASSU, one would
think graduate students are an
oppressed minority whose inter
ests are squelched at every turn,
not only by the University admin
istration, but also by know-noth
ing undergraduates.
The latest case: when the Grad
uate Student Association's fee
request — $18,000, mostly to be
spent on parties — was denied by a
narrow margin in last week's elec
tion, graduate student Neil
Crellin's reaction was, "Over one
half of the student body is made up
of graduate students who are taxed
to fund undergraduate programs.
The thanks we get is that under
graduates won't even fund one
program for us — well, screw (sic)
them."
Such sentiments by a graduate
student "leader" signify the need
for a thorough re-examination of
graduate students' attitudes and
University involvement, the under
graduate-graduate relationship
and graduates' role in the ASSU.
The first matter of concern is
graduate-student apathy. Accord
ing to Elections Commissioner
Tom Tsao, 2,189 graduate stu
dents (29.8 percent) voted in the
recent elections. This compares to
2,823 undergraduates (43 per
cent). If graduate students actual
ly cared enough to get out and
vote, their interests would have
sailed through the election.
But graduate-student apathy

doesn't appear limited to the polls.
Less than 10 graduate students
took the initiative to place their
name on the ballot for senate
seats, even though half these posi
tions are designated for graduate
students.
This apathy reflects the gradu
ate students' inability to recognize
that with student rights (i.e. par
ties) come responsibilities (such as
government service).
A second issue is the undergrad
uate/graduate-student dynamic.
According to graduate senator
Sanford Dickert, the GSA is "one
of the few organizations that. . .
provides services for graduate stu
dents."
But the fact is that many — if
not most — of the organizations
requesting special fees benefit the
entire campus, not just undergrad
uates. For example: the ASSU
Speakers Bureau funds guest
speakers of interest to all; Legal
Counseling is not restricted to
undergraduates; and the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault works on
issues of concern to all women, not
just those under the age of 21. Not
one of these groups restricts its
membership or activities to under
graduates. Ensuring that graduate
students make the time to partici
pate in these activities is not the
responsibility of undergraduates.
A possible solution to this
impasse involves re-examining the
role of graduate students, who are
apparently not adequately repre
sented in the ASSU. Perhaps a new
structure which specifically ad
dresses graduate-student concerns
should be formed.
One proposal which has merit is
the formation of a graduate-stu
dent Council of Presidents. This
second council would work in con
junction with, or as a special com
mittee to, the traditionally under
graduate COP
It could serve as a liason to the
administration on graduate-stu
dent issues, and introduce legisla
tion to the senate.
Who knows? Maybe the new
COP will be able to push through
funding for GSA parties.
