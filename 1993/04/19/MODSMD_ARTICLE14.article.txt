Perceptions of 6 reality 9 must not be created by media

-IDO NOT UNDERSTAND how Burt
Herman presumes to talk about
"reality" in his poorly framed April
11 rebuttal of criticisms leveled at the
photo essay "Night and Day in East
Palo Alto." The very fact that he
attempts to explain away Kwame Yao
Anku's well-taken and pointed objec
tions of April 8 indicates not only the
ambiguous, problematic and simplistic
nature of the display, but also confirms
the validity of the criticism.
I arrived at Stanford along with the
earthquake of 1989 and remember hav
ing to reassure family and friends that I
had not slipped into the Bay, contrary to
the impression given by photos of the
quake's devastation. Just as those pho
tos did not cause the quake, I acknowl
edge that neither Herman nor his co
photographer/co-editor, Victor Cheng,
invented black/white polarization (artis

tic or otherwise), the very real problems
of East Palo Alto, its poverty or the dis
mal state of public education.
Nonetheless, their voyeuristic incur
sion serves to recreate and continue the
mythical preconceptions of that polar
ization, preconceptions which are in
themselves fundamental to our inabili
ty to deal with or to actively interro
gate the issues. What Herman and
Cheng apparently fail to realize or to
take into account is the ideological
dimension of what, for them, was an
"artistic choice."
As such, Herman incorrectly accuses
Anku of imparting "racism to the mean
ing of the photos." However, it is the
structure chosen by these photogra
phers, steeped as it is in pre-existing
significance and inherent meaning,
which sets the stage for the ensuing
critical commentary. Anku simply rec-

ognizes the very real ideological signifi
cation in and behind the photos and the
accompanying text.
Herman spent 50 hours, roughly two
days, in the back of a police car. I have
lived in East Palo Alto for nearly three
years, and I do not pretend to know its
fullest dimensions. So I was jarred by
Herman's assertion that "[t]he photos
that ran are representative of the reality
of East Palo Alto." Perhaps they are rep
resentative of the photos that were
taken, perhaps they faithfully represent
the pre-set vision of someone seeking to
"witness the crime that occurs in East
Palo Alto," but they do not begin to accu
rately describe the "reality" of East Palo
Alto. Cheng's mandate to "balance the
violence" remains equally problematic
and incomplete. Would anyone dare to
speak of equity or representativeness if I
were to ride around Stanford in the back

of a police car or sit in one professor's
class for a week?
If Herman had included the rhetoric
contained in his rebuttal along with the
photos, it would have been even more
patently clear that the photo essay was
not an exercise in responsible photo
journalism, but a playing at a reality
which, in Herman's own words, "often
typifies the ivory tower of academia cut
off from the real world." Perhaps a
future project for Herman and Cheng
could be to hand over their camera to
residents of East Palo Alto — young
adults, seniors, etc. — and request that
they capture their own reality. Or, per
haps "Stanford's not-so-distant neigh
bors]" could offer their view of the
"ivory tower."
