# Interfaith leaders say Daily cartoon a sadly inept humor attempt
## 
### 
We were shocked and saddened by the
recent cartoons in The Daily portraying
a stereotypical Catholic, Jew and Protes
tant sitting together at a Passover
Seder, perpetuating the myth and false
hood that the Jews killed Jesus.
We as Christians and Jews know the
terrible consequences of perpetuating
such falsehoods. Such myths actually
made it possible for Christians to partic
ipate in numerous pogroms and eventu
ally contributed to some Christians par
ticipating in the Holocaust. For this rea
son we encourage the author of the car
toon to become more knowledgeable
about his own faith traditions.
The cartoon (according to The Daily)
portrays the three authors/roommates of
the cartoon at a Seder. What apparently

passes for casual humor among friends
takes on another meaning when said in
public.
While one might tease a Catholic
friend about eating "little wafers," and
they might in return refer to the "big
crackers" a Jewish person eats, all of
this would need to take place within the
confines of a close, understanding
friendship. If it were said out of context
in public, it would be highly inconsider
ate and insulting.
Additionally, the second cartoon con
tained a line of very poorly written
Hebrew which we believe was intended
to translate to "Excuse me, we didn't
want to speak evil but if you kept the
laws of the holiday, you would know
that it is forbidden to use the telephone
on a holiday to call."
The inference that those who objected
to the original cartoon do not know or
follow the laws of the holiday, and that
the cartoonist does, is additionally
insulting. May we remind the cartoonist
of the Jewish saying "On Judgement

Day, G-d will be your judge"; i.e. it is not
for one human being to judge the reli
gious virtue of another. That is for G-d
to judge.
The authors are obviously unaware of
the positive work being done on campus
to bring various religious communities
together in the spirit of education and
friendship.
Two weeks ago an inter-faith Seder
was held which was hosted by the Hillel
Foundation, the Lutheran Campus Min
istry and the Episcopal Chaplaincy at
Stanford. Over 60 people attended the
evening which focused on the similari
ties and the differences in our common
heritage. Those attending gained a
greater sensitivity, appreciation and
understanding of quite different reli
gious traditions.
We hope these offensive cartoons will
encourage all members of the Stanford
community to become more sensitive as
we deal with each other's diverse reli
gious traditions.
