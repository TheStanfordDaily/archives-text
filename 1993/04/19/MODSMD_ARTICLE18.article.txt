## Bargains! Steals! Deals! 
### 
THE CASHIER HAS bagged the
Customer's groceries and now he
waits for her to pay. The Customer
turns to search through her purse, her
back is to the cashier. What is she digging
for? Money, her checkbook, a knife? The
cashier is nervous. The line is backing up.
Suddenly, the Customer turns back
around, beaming with victorious pride.
She is wielding a handful of newspaper
clippings. "Wait!" she cries, "I've got
coupons!"
The Customer has triumphed over the
system, and the cashier will have to sub
tract the value of her coupons from the
previous total. In the process, the Cus
tomer has partaken of a time-honored
cultural ritual — she's gotten a "good
deal." Coupons are only one component of
the larger "good deal" culture. Two For
One! 20 percent Off! All-You-Can-Eat!
Cash Back! Free Pizza! — everywhere,
the Customer is assaulted by bargain
opportunities. And all too often, he seizes
upon them like a wide-mouthed bass
gulping down a shiny metal fishing lure.
One such lure is the Price Club, which
is founded on the premise that the Cus
tomer can't resist a good deal. Indeed,
from the moment he pays his $35 mem
bership fee, the Customer starts saving.
He is let into a gigantic warehouse full of
big racks with lots of stuff — big stuff—
for low prices. A dream come true! Good
deals everywhere, and along the way

there are free food samples. Free stuff.
Good deal! The Customer can save so
much at the Price Club that he actually
goes broke. This is the good deal's defin
ing paradox: the more you spend, the
more you save.
It's not so much the actual products
the Customer comes away with, it's how
impressive a goods-to-dollar ratio he gets.
"Big Gulps," for example, offer the Cus
tomer a staggering amount of fluid for a
price that's not that much more expensive
than a regular soda. And so, even if he
knows he can't possibly consume a 190
ounces of Mountain Dew, the Customer
will opt for the "Super Big Gulp" and
force himself to drink it — all of it —
because it's such a good deal. Even if he
has to pee every hour, on the hour, for
the next three days, the Customer can
rest assured that he took advantage of a
real beverage bargain.
At the movies, if she buys a "large"
Coke, the Customer will always feel a
tinge of regret that she didn't spring for
the "Best Value." More soda. More sav
ings. Better deal.
In fact, we might say that all of human
history and culture is driven by the desire
for "good deals." Take the Louisiana Pur
chase, where Thomas Jefferson scored a
lot of good land at a bargain price. He
didn't even need to use a coupon. Even
our dignified, stoic statesman must have
broken character for just a moment after

he paid Napoleon a buck fifty for 3 billion
acres of land. He probably clenched his
fist in front of him and whispered,
"Yesss! Good deal!"
Even religions, many of which call on
us to "redeem" ourselves, are just grand,
metaphysical "good deals." The faithful
Customer earns a kind of spiritual
coupon through devotion and sacrifice,
which promises an untold wealth of "sav
ings." And in the end, at the cash register
of eternity, when we go to pay for our
selves once and for all, a few lucky, pious
souls will be able to say, "Wait! I've got a
coupon!" and dig through their wallets
and purses and come up with tattered,
clipped squares of paper printed with the
word "Faith" or "Self-Sacrifice" or "Free
Pizza!" (A few hapless folks will, of
course, have brought the wrong coupon.)
But the truly redeemed will be let into
paradise, which might very well be a big
Price Club with all kinds of unimaginable
bargains. So they'll all be "saved" and
"saving" at the same time — saved from
eternal damnation, and saving on all
kinds of good deals. Great, big, heavenly
good deals.
