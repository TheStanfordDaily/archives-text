# Campus leaders: justice served in latest King trial
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Although the campus reacted
tranquilly to Saturday's verdict in
the federal Rodney King beating
trial, several students and faculty
said yesterday that the trial's end
does not herald the end of the
struggle for equality in America.
In contrast to last year's emo
tional rallies and marches, there
were no emergency meetings
planned, and no signs of violence
interrupted the weekend's activi
ties.
The verdict convicted two of
the four Los Angeles police offi
cers involved in the beating, Sgt.
Stacey Koon and officer Laurence
Powell, of violating King's civil
rights. Each face a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, but both are ex
pected to appeal the verdict. Offi
cer Theodore Briseno and former
officer Timothy Wind were acquit
ted.
Junior Allyson Dickson, co
chair of the Black Student Union,
said she agreed with the decision.
"I was really happy with the
verdict," she said. "I definitely
thought that Powell should be
convicted and Koon, too, because
he was the commanding officer.
The other two weren't as defi
nite."
Similarly, Law Prof. Robert

Weisberg said he believes the ver
dict was completely fair. "The
prosecutors did a great job," he
said. "Justice has been served."
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said there has been a cer
tain amount of justice, but that
there were other officers who bore
responsibility for the beating who
did not stand trial.
"I think the sad part is that it's
taken almost two years to try
these officers, and it's too bad a
country has to go through the pain
[this country] has gone through
over the past two years to see jus
tice done," he said.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Sylvia Wynter said that if the legal
system had worked, all the officers
would have been guilty of aiding
and abetting charges.
"One can't think of it in terms
of fairness," she said. "It has been
so clearly unjust for those who
had a knowledge of police brutali
ty."
Junior Priya Haji of the Com
munity Action Coalition, a group
formed in the aftermath of last
year's trial, said that although the
verdict was a step in the right di
rection, it should not allow people
to think justice has been served
adequately.
"The Rodney King verdict last
year galvanized a lot of interest
