## Stanford: A learning community of Higher Education An op/ed Special Report 
### Ron Glass 
THE DAY AFTER I first
made some notes for this
article, I was shocked by
allegations of breaches in the
Honor Code in my Philosophy
CIV course. I felt pain at the dis
respect and violation of the com
munity. I felt hopeless about iden
tifying the cheaters, and angry
that suspicion isolated faculty
from students and students from
one another. I felt the urge to
punish the transgressors, and the
sadness of knowing this could not
restore the community. I felt
determined to move through
these feelings and on to a deeper
reflection on the community that
is Stanford.
Pressed for time, since right
after the CIV final exam I had to
catch a flight to a meeting where I
was to read a paper, practical
questions dominated the initial
communications between me and
other faculty and the Judicial
Affairs office: How widespread
was the cheating and could we
reliably determine this? Should I
have cancelled the exam? Should
we grade the exam? What should
be said to the students and to the
broader public? How should we
make decisions about what to do?
Once on the plane, I was
struck by an irony: While we were
busy being diligent faculty
researchers and publishing
papers, we have overlooked a very
important educational duty. We
had assumed that students
understood the Honor Code and
the responsibilities of being mem
bers of a community. We did
spend time on plagiarism, a par
ticular form of transgression, but
not on the deeper moral issues
and commitments embedded in
being part of Stanford.
Though conscious that the
impact of a couple of hours of
serious reflection and discussion
on the meaning of moral commu
nity would be limited, I recalled
my own undergraduate years at
Harvard in the late '60s, and my
intellectual, moral and emotional
growth as a result of tense
debates about racism, war, drugs
and women's liberation.
I wondered at my nostalgia:
was such intense commitment to
working out a stand on the impor
tant moral issues of the day a
thing of the past, now blocked by
resistance to discussion of "politi
cally correct" concerns and by a
strictly instrumental approach to
education that focused on gradu
ate-school admission or financial
success?
I realized that Stanford is,
after all, a creature of history,

evolving in a culture which ele
vates an individualistic competi
tive ethos to a sacred natural
order, and which practices a
wealth-accumulation model of
education.
Quarters and grades
would disappear.
Faculty research and
teaching would not be
distinct domains of
activity. Rather, facul
ty and students would
join in investigations.
As scholars, our job is to mine
rich veins of theory, use technolo
gies of inquiry to extract nuggets
of truth, to discover new sources
of wealth and to concentrate capi
tal in the coin of the realm (lec
tures, articles and books). We
then selectively offer this wealth
for deposit in the cranial vaults of
the students, who pay handsome
ly for the chance to receive the
most valuable deposits from the
most famous wealth producers.
Students' certificates of deposit
(diplomas) attest to the value of
their holdings and the rate of
return (in prestige, salaries and
opportunities) that can be expect
ed.
Students labor privately in the
great banks (libraries) and seek
the most valuable nuggets in
orderto increase their bond rat
ing (grades), whereby they might
attract more deposits for their
own vaults, and thus be granted
access to positions of authority
and then the opportunity to dis
pense (at the highest prices
obtainable) the wealth-knowledge
thus accumulated.
Were the students simply
being realistic in their fear that a
Bin CIV would make a difference
with regard to their future, or to
admission to medical or law
schools? Is it any wonder that
some students treat the universi
ty community with a "catch me if
you can" attitude, intent only on
acquiring the formal certifications
that provide entry to wealth and
power?
Moreover, by structuring our
teaching around a quarter system
of instruction with grades, despite
knowing that grades are not reli
able indicators of the quality of
someone's contributions to their
family, their community or to his-

Tory, weren't we as faculty com
plicit in the wealth- and status
sorting functions of U.S. educa
tion? Could we faculty exert moral
leadership within our own domain
and transform Stanford to fit
more closely with what we know
to be of greatest importance in
life? Could we stand against the
forces of the day and a long histo
ry which had severed the link
between learning, moral self
development and the creation of a
just society? Could Stanford
become a community in which
cheating, lying and breaches of
honor offered no reward?
To become an avowedly moral
community and a learning com
munity would not mean that we
would be a community of saints,
nor even aspiring saints. In a
sense, we cannot be moral nor can
we be learned, we can only always
be becoming moral and becoming
learned.
Learning and the struggle to
live morally end only with death.
We are faced with limitless possi
bilities for further moral growth
and further learning as individu
als and as a community. Not only
do we live in an age of informa
tion explosion which defies the
most diligent scholar, but we live
unavoidably amid immorality,
pain, suffering, injustice, exploita
tion, starvation and murder on a
mass scale. Moreover, we con
tribute to the proliferation of
information whose very volume
obscures significance (instead of

undergraduate or
graduate programs
of prescribed peri
ods would disappear.
publish or perish, perhaps it has
become publish and perish), and
we are complicit in the evil of the
world despite our best intentions
and our unrelenting efforts.
This is not to suggest that feel
ings of guilt are more appropriate
than feelings or righteousness in
the moral and learning communi
ty that Stanford could be. Rather,
the point is that such a communi
ty would be responsible (meaning
both "able to respond to" and
"being accountable for") to itself
and the world, and committed to
the struggle to know more, care

more deeply and to make things
better.
Such a community would be
guided by values that are always
in the process of being defined
and realized, respectfully seeking
a critical truth in order to do jus
tice, with compassion for its igno
rance and shortcomings. In a con
tinual process of self-examination
and investigation of the world,
such a community welcomes criti
cism and truthful encounter and
fosters caring for and about the
suffering and pain that add a bit
tersweetness to the joys of life.
A Stanford that had being a
moral learning community as
its core objective would stop
structuring education around
the transmission of a canon of
Truths in artificial 10-week
packages. Quarters and grades
would disappear. Faculty
research and teaching would
not be distinct domains of activ
ity. Rather, faculty and stu
dents would join in investiga
tions (of quite various dura
tions) of problems and ques
tions that offer the promise of
making ourselves and the world
a better place.
We would recognize that each
person brings his or her own
measure of understanding,
knowledge and ignorance, and |
so we could better utilize the
cultural insights and accom
plishments stored in our
libraries and museums to hasten
our personal and community
development. Just as faculty
learning is recorded in the nar
ratives of our articles, books and
our tenure and promotion
reviews, so student learning
could be recorded in the narra
tives of their own writing and of
reviews of projects and research
es jointly written with faculty.
Degrees would be replaced by
portfolios. The notion of under
graduate or graduate programs of
prescribed periods would disap
pear as students would remain in
the Stanford community until
they had achieved the competen
cies needed to move into their next
set of commitments (and they
might return at various points in
their life to renew their self-under
standing and develop new compe
tencies).
As a moral and learning com
munity, Stanford would be
enabling lifelong development and
modeling a democratic, just soci
ety. The most telling record or our
learning would be the degree of
change in ourselves and our com
munity. If we take up this chal
lenge, and risk our present selves
and the present order and shape
of the university in order to

become
a kind of insti
tution that could do
honor to the 21st century,
perhaps we might not simply
make ourselves better people
more able to learn, we just might
change the world.
