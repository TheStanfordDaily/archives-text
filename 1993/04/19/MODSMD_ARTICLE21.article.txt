# Hope and glory — educational equality in 2050

this morning is slow, and so
you doze off. You float slow
ly out the window and on to the
Quad.
The buildings seem familiar,
yet somehow different. You pick
up a Daily and note with amaze
ment that the year is 2050.
Straining your credulity even fur
ther, the lead headline proclaims
that men and women are now
equally represented on the
Stanford faculty.
"Cool," you think, "if only I
could snare this article, it'd save
me hours in the library writing
my term paper on women in
higher ed."
Let's see. It says that in 1992-
93 women constituted 15 percent
of the faculty and 10 percent of
the tenured faculty.
That was already an increase
in women's representation as
compared to almost 20 years ear

lier (1974-75) when women were
8 percent of the faculty and 4 per
cent of the tenured faculty.
What about by discipline, you
wonder? Wow! The article says
that in 2050 women and men are
distributed approximately equal
ly across all disciplines. How dif
ferent from 1992-93.
In '92-93, women were a very
small percentage (5 to 8) of the
faculty in business and and eco
nomics and in most of the "hard"
sciences. But women were 25 to
45 percent of the faculty in edu
cation, many of the humanities
and some of the social sciences
and medical sciences.
What difference does it make
having approximately equal rep
resentations of women and men
faculty in all disciplines? You
decide to talk to some students.
One of them, Hope, tells you
she's your granddaughter. This
time-warp stuff is definitely
weird.
Hope explains that the approx
imately equal distribution of

women and men in the professo
rate and in the academic disci
plines parallels the approximate
ly equal distribution of women
and men in the workforce as a
whole.
She relates how the equality
came about in the early 21st cen
tury as a part of a world-wide
recognition that gender segrega
tion was impeding productivity
by preventing people from study
ing and working in fields that
made the best use of their talents
and skills.
Policy-makers in the early
21st century recognized as out
moded and inefficient the old
breadwinner/homemaker model,
which reserved the most econom
ically attractive jobs for men so
they could support their families.
In a world where women were
increasingly seen as partners in
their family's financial well
being, and increasingly making a
lifetime commitment to market
work, it made less and less sense
from the point of view of aggre
gate productivity to welcome
women only into those occupa
tions and specialties that were
less economically attractive, and
bar them or make them feel
unwelcome in the more tradition
ally male occupations.
At all levels of the society,
careful thought was given to the
implications of women's equality
in the workplace and the need to
coordinate work and family roles.
Procedures at work organiza

tions were changed to accommo
date the childrearing responsibil
ities of parents. For example, at
Stanford and other academic
institutions, the tenure process
was made more flexible. Parents
(and others as well) could take a
good deal more than seven years
to prove their scholarly abilities.
In elementary and secondary
schools, boys and girls learned
how the old breadwinner/home
maker stereotypes impeded their
abilities to use all their talents.
They were taught that with hard
work they could succeed in any
occupation they chose. And chil
dren were taught that childrear
ing was the responsibility of both
men and women.
Slowly the world began to
change. Women who wanted to
succeed at traditionally male
occupations were no longer sub
jected to sexual and other types
of harassment. They were wel
comed as equal participants. And
men who wanted to enter tradi
tionally female occupations were
no longer derided by friends and
family.
Men and women became equal
in their work relationships and in
their loving relationships.
Partners shared both financial
responsibilities and household
and childrearing responsibilities.
And productivity soared.
You linger a bit longer with
Hope, savoring her delight at the
new Stanford and the new world
in which she contemplates adult
hood. But you already feel your
self moving backward in time,
beaming back to 1993. January,
February, March, April. . . wait,
stop. Yes, it's the right hour.
Your classmates are in a heated
discussion on the pros and cons
of faculty affirmative action.
You listen for a while and then
assert with quiet authority, "I
have seen the future. Equal rep

resentation of women and men is
a good deal. Maybe we can get
there before 2050."
