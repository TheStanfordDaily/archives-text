# Journeying beyond retrenchment

### Patricia Gumport Brian Pusser 
IMAGINE THE YEAR 2000.
Imagine yourself in the library
of a m£yor research university.
You are there to look up the word
"retrenchment" in a dictionary.
To your surprise the dictionary
no longer contains the letters R
or Q, and only a portion of the
entries under Z.
Retrenchment is defined in
today's comprehensive dictio
naries as "the act of cutting
down, reducing or diminish
ing." When you envision the
university of the future, you
must confront the decisions
made during periods of
retrenchment. Your university
could be smaller, with fewer
fields of study, students and
faculty. With fewer resources
available for reference, you
might not be able to figure out
why.
According to the American
Council on Education, in 1991-
92 roughly two-thirds of public
research universities faced sub
stantial budget cuts. Many pri
vate research universities that
faced additional strain from
declining indirect-cost rates
also found themselves making
/■cuts. Given reductions in state
and federal funding for higher
education and sustained public
scrutiny of education finance,
research universities will need
to adapt. Among the available
responses is retrenchment.
How should a comprehensive
research university become
smaller? Would you cut non
academic areas only? If not,
would you cut the same num
ber of faculty from each field of
study? Would you try to protect
the most traditional or popular
fields, or would you protect the
most vulnerable? Would you cut
any discipline entirely, and if you
did, would you still consider your
campus a great university?
The American research univer
sity as we know it today has exist

ed for over a century. Much has
remained the same. The commit
ment to undergraduate and grad
uate education in the same orga
nization is one example. New pat
terns have also evolved, such as
the increased prominence of
research on campuses, and the
changing prestige of certain disci
plines. At one time, schools of law
and medicine were relatively low
status units on campus, while
humanities were held in great
esteem. The shift in status of aca
demic fields over time is a credit
and a caution to the modern uni
versity. It evidences the flexibility
needed to serve the changing
demands of society, while at the
same time illuminating the risk of
diminishing the university's abili
ty to meet changes in prestige
which are not easily predicted.
As we consider the year 2000,
it is important to reflect on
retrenchment decisions made
during the 1980s and early 19905.
A key aspect of those decisions
was that retrenchment entailed
selective as well as across-the
board cuts. On some campuses,
entire departments or schools
within universities were closed.
When retrenchment takes the
form of eliminating disciplines or
schools, it is useful to think of it
in terms of "restructuring." That
is, rather than simply becoming
smaller, a university begins to
take on a different composition
and shape, with significant and
potentially surprising ramifica
tions.
Those fields most likely to be
cut during the '80s were humani
ties, fine arts, education and
social sciences. These areas have
a disproportionately high number
of minority faculty and students,
the highest percentage of female
students obtaining B.A. degrees
and the greatest presence of
female faculty. A recent study of
contested reductions around the
country showed that nearly 75
percent of all faculty dismissals in
the study group were in fields
with a high proportion of women

students.
Departments which had few
tenured positions and large num
bers of junior or part-time faculty
were also particularly vulnerable.
These were often new or innova
tive programs on campuses,
which represented an important
component of higher education's
commitment to academic diversi
ty. Concurrent reductions in
administrative programs devoted
to affirmative outreach and
retention of minority and non
traditional students further chal
lenged efforts to diversify the
student body. If these trends con
tinue, by the year 2000 a major
research university could be sig
nificantly less diverse than it is
today.
Retrenchment efforts
changed the professional cli
mate on many campuses. The
struggle over where and how to
cut increased intra-disciplinary
discord, pitting relatively secure
faculty and disciplines against
the more vulnerable.
Tensions also increased
between university administra
tors and faculty. Traditionally
faculty members have been key
participants in the hiring and
dismissal of other faculty. Due
to the pressure to cut quickly
and the complexity of contempo
rary institutions, the process of
cutting academic programs dur
ing the '80s often strained stan
dard academic governance pro
cedures.
Justifications for retrenching
certain disciplines and not others
relied on subjective evaluations
of efficiency and productivity.
These assessments were some
times at odds with students' con
ceptions of important fields of
study. One strategy attempted to
redirect resources from
retrenched programs into a few
departments seen as "steeples of
excellence." Although these
steeples affirmed external per
ceptions of campus excellence,
internally they widened the
resource differential among acad

emic units on campus.
Undergraduates not directly
involved with funded research, or
who did not attend services at the
steeples of excellence, questioned
the reallocation of resources.
Retrenched departments general
ly raised the teaching load of sur
viving faculty and teaching assis
tants or increased the number of
part-time instructors. Students
increasingly attended larger
classes taught by instructors
with little time for advising or
mentoring.
There is no sign on the horizon
of an end to the economic and
political challenges for research
universities. However, as we look
to the year 2000 it is important to
consider some recent approaches
which indicate that retrenchment
may not be inevitable, and
renewed support for higher edu
cation may be possible.
A number of programs target
ed for elimination in the '80s sur
vived by building new coalitions
inside and outside the university.
Those coalitions successfully
questioned assessments of pro
ductivity and efficiency. They also
questioned the allocation of
resources among disciplines, and
whether that allocation conflicted
with a commitment to diversify
the campus and its community of
support.
In formulating responses
which best shape the future of
the university, it would seem
appropriate to develop an equi
table vision of adaptation before
committing to retrenchment or
restructuring. The entire univer
sity community will benefit from
deliberate contemplation of
whether it is appropriate to elimi
nate some programs in order to
promote others whose stars may
not shine so brightly when viewed
in different light or at another
time.

IMAGINE THE YEAR 2000.
Imagine yourself in the library
of a m£yor research university.
You are there to look up the word
"retrenchment" in a dictionary.
To your surprise the dictionary
no longer contains the letters R
or Q, and only a portion of the
entries under Z.
Retrenchment is defined in
today's comprehensive dictio
naries as "the act of cutting
down, reducing or diminish
ing." When you envision the
university of the future, you
must confront the decisions
made during periods of
retrenchment. Your university
could be smaller, with fewer
fields of study, students and
faculty. With fewer resources
available for reference, you
might not be able to figure out
why.
According to the American
Council on Education, in 1991-
92 roughly two-thirds of public
research universities faced sub
stantial budget cuts. Many pri
vate research universities that
faced additional strain from
declining indirect-cost rates
also found themselves making
/■cuts. Given reductions in state
and federal funding for higher
education and sustained public
scrutiny of education finance,
research universities will need
to adapt. Among the available
responses is retrenchment.
How should a comprehensive
research university become
smaller? Would you cut non
academic areas only? If not,
would you cut the same num
ber of faculty from each field of
study? Would you try to protect
the most traditional or popular
fields, or would you protect the
most vulnerable? Would you cut
any discipline entirely, and if you
did, would you still consider your
campus a great university?
The American research univer
sity as we know it today has exist

ed for over a century. Much has
remained the same. The commit
ment to undergraduate and grad
uate education in the same orga
nization is one example. New pat
terns have also evolved, such as
the increased prominence of
research on campuses, and the
changing prestige of certain disci
plines. At one time, schools of law
and medicine were relatively low
status units on campus, while
humanities were held in great
esteem. The shift in status of aca
demic fields over time is a credit
and a caution to the modern uni
versity. It evidences the flexibility
needed to serve the changing
demands of society, while at the
same time illuminating the risk of
diminishing the university's abili
ty to meet changes in prestige
which are not easily predicted.
As we consider the year 2000,
it is important to reflect on
retrenchment decisions made
during the 1980s and early 19905.
A key aspect of those decisions
was that retrenchment entailed
selective as well as across-the
board cuts. On some campuses,
entire departments or schools
within universities were closed.
When retrenchment takes the
form of eliminating disciplines or
schools, it is useful to think of it
in terms of "restructuring." That
is, rather than simply becoming
smaller, a university begins to
take on a different composition
and shape, with significant and
potentially surprising ramifica
tions.
Those fields most likely to be
cut during the '80s were humani
ties, fine arts, education and
social sciences. These areas have
a disproportionately high number
of minority faculty and students,
the highest percentage of female
students obtaining B.A. degrees
and the greatest presence of
female faculty. A recent study of
contested reductions around the
country showed that nearly 75
percent of all faculty dismissals in
the study group were in fields
with a high proportion of women

students.
Departments which had few
tenured positions and large num
bers of junior or part-time faculty
were also particularly vulnerable.
These were often new or innova
tive programs on campuses,
which represented an important
component of higher education's
commitment to academic diversi
ty. Concurrent reductions in
administrative programs devoted
to affirmative outreach and
retention of minority and non
traditional students further chal
lenged efforts to diversify the
student body. If these trends con
tinue, by the year 2000 a major
research university could be sig
nificantly less diverse than it is
today.
