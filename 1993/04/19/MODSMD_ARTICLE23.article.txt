# New admissions standards: replacing the SAT
## 
### Michael Kirst Henry Rowen 
Students rightly per
ceive a disconnection
between the subjects they
study in high school and the crite
ria used for evaluating them in the
next stage of their lives.
Employers tend not to ask for
high-school records, a fact which
sends a clear message: they do not
value the information in them.
Similarly, colleges and universi
ties, who ask for these records,
rely heavily on tests which are not
keyed to the content of high-school
curricula. They, too, evidently do
not value highly what students
study; decades ago they decided
that the aptitude of students was
more relevant for admissions than
what students know.
This disconnection between
school, on the one hand, and work
and college on the other, lowers
the incentive to study. It doubtless
contributes to the knowledge fail
ings of American students relative
to those of other nations. Without
strengthening the link between
work in school and later rewards,
it is hard to imagine how we can
achieve two of our national goals
for education for the year 2000:
• Increasing the high-school
graduation rate to 90 percent.
• Having students leave grades
four, eight and 12 with demon
strated competencies in challeng
ing subject matter including
English, mathematics, science,
history and geography — and pre
pared for responsible citizenship,
further learning and productive
employment.
Replacing the SATs, which are
not aligned with the high-school
curriculum, by subject-matter
achievement tests, which are,
would alter the incentives of stu
dents and teachers. Students who
now aspire to college only build
the skills needed to score well on
the SATs.
With the exception of the math
section, these tests are largely
free of content: in history, the sci
ences, much of literature and, of
course, foreign languages. Only
better students who are aiming
for selective institutions take sub
ject-matter tests, and even for
them the dominant concern is the
SAT score. (Testimony to its
power is the popularity of cram
schools such as Stanley Kaplan.)
Although many institutions urge
students to take several achieve
ment tests and most leading ones

require them, students seem to
believe that little weight is given
to subject-matter test scores — or
that they are used at all — for
admissions. The motivation of
teachers should also be improved
by a closer alignment between
what they teach and the assess
ment of their students.
The movement toward nation
al curricula standards, a move
ment which has been endorsed by
President Clinton and many state
governors, is highly compatible
with our proposal. College
entrance criteria should reinforce
national content goals and the
curricula of the schools. However,
there is opposition to national
curricula standards in the ele
mentary/secondary schools estab
lishment and their future is
uncertain. This makes college
entrance criteria all the more
important.
The College Board, which
established the SAT, is an impor
tant player in the process. It has
long offered achievement tests in
many subjects and is now devel
oping PACE SETTER, a sec
ondary-school framework and
related assessments, in five sub
ject areas. This is a positive devel
opment. Yet the College Board
does not propose that the SAT be
cut back.
In contrast, Crouse and
Trusheim in The Case Against
the SAT (University of Chicago
Press, 1988) argue that high
school grades are better than the
SATs in predicting college perfor
mance. They also cite several
studies showing that achievement
tests predict college performance
about as well as do the SATs, and
conclude that there is little basis
to believe that the SATs are freer
from differences in curricula
offerings among high schools.
They also dispute the claim that
the SATs help poor and black can
didates.
A recent study by Baron and
Norman, "SATs, Achievement
Tests and High-School Class
Rank as Predictors of College
Performance" (Educational and
Psychological Measurement 1992,
52), compares the predictive value
of various combinations of the
SATs, high-school class rank and
achievement tests. They found
that once high-school rank and
achievement test scores are
known, the SATs add little to the
prediction of academic perfor
mance. (The main analysis did
not incorporate underrepresented
minorities but a supplementary

analysis shows that this finding
appl ; es also to them.) The authors
conclude that "Use of achieve
ment tests and high-school class
rank for college admissions could
provide high-school students with
incentives to achieve academical
ly, but the SATs are not designed
to provide such incentive."
John Bishop in "Incentives for
Learning: Why American High
School Students Compare so
Poorly to Their Counterparts
Overseas" (in Research in Labor
Economics, volume II) writes,
"improving the teaching of these
subjects (science, history, social
science, trigonometry, statistics
and calculus or the ability to write
an essay) will have only a minor
effect on how a child does on the
SAT, so why worry about stan
dards?" Also, "the tendency not
to reward effort and learning in
high school tends to be a peculiar
ly American phenomenon. School
grades are the determinant
of who gets the most-preferred
apprenticeships. In west
Germany, in Canada, Australia,
Japan and West Europe, educa
tional systems administer
achievement exams that are close
ly tied to the curriculum....
Performance on these exams is
the primary determinant of
admissions to a university."
This change in America proba
bly needs to be led by private
higher education. Although these
institutions bear many burdens,
they are less encumbered politi
cally than public ones. Leading
private institutions are selective;
for them the combination of high
school records plus'achievement
test scores would produce very
close to the mix of students that
they now get through a combina
tion of SATs, high-school grades
and, sometimes, achievement
tests. There would be some differ
ences; at the margins, less bright
but hardworking students would
be favored and bright ones who
are lazy or from schools with poor
subject-matter offerings would be
disfavored. But these institutions
today find ways of admitting peo
ple that they want — for various
reasons — more or less indepen
dently from test results and they
would continue to do so. For
instance, student portfolios could
be used if some high schools do
not offer all the courses covered
in achievement tests.
These institutions have noth
ing to lose regarding the mix of
their students while all of higher
education and society as a whole

has much to gain from the exam
ple that they would set. Moreover,
even for the elite institutions,
over time the better alignment of
high-school curricula and admis
sions criteria would produce bet
ter-prepared entering classes.
Why hasn't this happened?
Only two small colleges, Bowdoin
and Bates, have dropped the
SATs. One possibility is that
admissions staffs in most selec
tive institutions see themselves in
something of a zero-sum game
with their peers and worry that
they will lose out if they switch
and others don't. We doubt that
any such worries are warranted.
Another is that they fear being
charged with hurting minority
access — even though the SATs
have been criticized on just this
score. It is true that a smaller
proportion of minority students
take achievement tests now, but
the gap has been narrowing. More
to the point: if such tests were
required instead of the SATs, the
SATs would disappear. According
to Bishop, "Substitution of acade
mic achievement tests for apti
tude tests in college admissions
improves minority access because
minority-majority differential
tends to be smaller (in standard
deviation units) on achievement
tests (e.g. the National
Assessment of Educational
Progress reading and math tests)
than on aptitude tests (e.g. the
SAT)."
Perhaps the most legitimate
concern is that poor-quality cur
ricula in some schools would hurt
the chances of bright, but poorly
prepared students. Again, chang
ing the criteria for admissions —
along with the movement for
national standards — would
increase incentives for inadequate
high schools to improve their cur
ricula.
So what should be done? The
leading, say 20, private colleges
and universities should agree to
replace the SAT with College
Board achievement tests that are
compatible with national curricu
la goals. So should public institu
tions. If each is reluctant to do so
on its own, perhaps for fear that
it would be disadvantaged, some
outside person or group — say
the Secretary of Education or the
Chief State School Officers —
should urge this switch for all.
