# Reversal of fortune as netters earn tough split

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
It just doesn't get any better than this.
The Cardinal men's tennis team treated
hundreds of fans to a 12-hour performance of

unmatched skill and unwavering determina
tion this weekend as they battled with the
giants of collegiate tennis, No. 2 USC and No.
1 UCLA, at Stanford Tennis Stadium. When
all was said and done, the Cardinal came away
with a 5-4 upset over the Bruins and a 5-4 loss

to the Trojans.
Friday's contest with the Trojans could not
have been closer. Nine matches went to three
sets and four of those were decided in
tiebreakers. Only No. 99 Vimal Patel, playing
in the third slot, had a lopsided singles match,
losing quickly to Zimbabwean Davis Cupper
Wayne Black, 6-1, 6-4.
After that, the 900 fans in attendance set
tled in for fierce three-set battles on every
court. The next player to fall was Stanford's
top hitter, No. 7 Michael Flanagan. No. 8
Brian MacPhie, who has been out for most of
the season, edged Flanagan 3-6, 6-2, 7-6.
With a 2-0 lead, the Trojans were on their
way to their second tromping of the Cardinal
this season. In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
Stanford was defeated 6-1. But within 10 min
utes the tide had turned, as Stanford won
three of the remaining four singles matches.
In the fourth spot, Chris Cocotos defeated
Jon Leach 4-6, 6-2, 7-6. Freshman Jeff
Salzenstein came through with a tremendous
win in the fifth slot over Hungarian Davis
Cupper Andres Lanyi 4-6, 6-3, 7-6. Ricky
Becker, who has started in only three singles
matches this year, quickly followed with a 3-6,
6-3, 7-6 victory over Adam Peterson.
"Losing at No. 5 and 6 was a surprise,"
MacPhie said. "Usually that's where we're
strongest."
In the No. 2 spot, No. 18 Robert Devens
was defeated by Swedish Davis Cupper David
Ekerot 6-4, 2-6,6-2.
In a 3-3 deadlock, the teams headed into

doubles. Salzenstein and partner Jim Thomas
fell quickly to No. 17 Black and Kent Seton 6-
1,6-1.
On courts 1 and 2, it was a battle of wills.
No. 29 Flanagan and Cocotos edged out No.
21 Leach and MacPhie in three exhausting
sets 1-6, 7-6, 6-4. "We just tried to wear them
down and stay in the points for as long as pos
sible," Flanagan said.
Suddenly the entire match, over five-and
a-half-hours of play, rested on the outcome of
the third-set tiebreaker taking place on Court
2. Patel and Devens had hit one winner after
the next and saved balls that were surely
unreachable. At 6-6, Patel went for an over
head smash to put the Cardinal at game-set
match point... but mishit it out of the court.
The next ball went into the net, clinching the
win for Ekerot and Lanyi (3-6, 7-6, 7-6) and
for the whole Trojan squad.
The weekend was only half over, however,
and Cardinal coach Dick Gould was concerned
about how the team would play against the
Bruins. "We need to come back emotionally
and psychologically after today," he said.
Despite a slow start on Sunday, his team
did not let him down. Salzenstein easily
defeated Fritz Bissell 6-4, 6-1, but the score
was tied 1-1 as Cocotos lost to No. 41 Davide
Sanguinetti 6-3, 6-4.
The Cardinal gained momentum as Becker
defeated Matt Quinlan 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 and
Devens and Patel won their second sets to

stay alive in close matches. Flana
gan soon defeated Canadian
Davis Cupper Sebastien Leßlanc
6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Patel followed suit
with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 triumph over
No. 33 Jason Sher.
At 4-1, Stanford was on the
verge of upsetting the Bruins in
singles alone. Devens, bearing the
weight of another possible Cardi
nal victory, was at 4-4 in the third
set.
But Janecek broke Devens'
serve to go up 5-4 and then served
to win, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Five hours after the match had

started, fans who had been to Fri
day's match were experiencing
deja vu. At No. 3 doubles, Becker
and Salzenstein were the first to
fall 6-3, 6-2 to Quinlan and Darin
Pleasant.
Flanagan and Cocotos never
did have the edge over Leßlanc
and Janecek, and soon the French
Canadian duo had a 6-4, 6-3 victo
ry under their belts.
At 4-4, the match once again
rested on the play of Patel and
Devens. A 3-1 Cardinal lead in the
third set quickly diminished as
Bissell and Sanguinetti came
charging back into the match. At
4-4, Patel adamantly held serve to
take a 5-4 lead, and a few points
later sealed the match with a win
ner, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.

"It was poetic justice that No.
2 won it, especially for Vimal,"
Gould said. "Today he took
charge with a style of play that he
is capable of, but doesn't always
feel comfortable with."
"That was brutal," Patel said.
"Everything was on us again.
Today we stayed more focused
and didn't play in streaks like we
did against USC ... And Bobby
really lifted his game in the third
set today.
"I think today we sent a mes
sage to everybody — we're not as
bad as people and teams think we
are!" he continued. "When we
were in L.A. [USC and UCLA|
acted like we weren't even worth
their time, but I think we gave
them a message back today."

Devens. A 3-1 Cardinal lead in the
third set quickly diminished as
Bissell and Sanguinetti came
charging back into the match. At
4-4, Patel adamantly held serve to
take a 5-4 lead, and a few points
later sealed the match with a win
ner, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.

"It was poetic justice that No.
2 won it, especially for Vimal,"
Gould said. "Today he took
charge with a style of play that he
is capable of, but doesn't always
feel comfortable with."
"That was brutal," Patel said.
"Everything was on us again.
Today we stayed more focused
and didn't play in streaks like we
did against USC ... And Bobby
really lifted his game in the third
set today.
"I think today we sent a mes
sage to everybody — we're not as
bad as people and teams think we
are!" he continued. "When we
were in L.A. [USC and UCLA|
acted like we weren't even worth
their time, but I think we gave
them a message back today."
It just doesn't get any better than this.
The Cardinal men's tennis team treated
hundreds of fans to a 12-hour performance of

unmatched skill and unwavering determina
tion this weekend as they battled with the
giants of collegiate tennis, No. 2 USC and No.
1 UCLA, at Stanford Tennis Stadium. When
all was said and done, the Cardinal came away
with a 5-4 upset over the Bruins and a 5-4 loss

to the Trojans.
Friday's contest with the Trojans could not
have been closer. Nine matches went to three
sets and four of those were decided in
tiebreakers. Only No. 99 Vimal Patel, playing
in the third slot, had a lopsided singles match,
losing quickly to Zimbabwean Davis Cupper
Wayne Black, 6-1, 6-4.
After that, the 900 fans in attendance set
tled in for fierce three-set battles on every
court. The next player to fall was Stanford's
top hitter, No. 7 Michael Flanagan. No. 8
Brian MacPhie, who has been out for most of
the season, edged Flanagan 3-6, 6-2, 7-6.
With a 2-0 lead, the Trojans were on their
way to their second tromping of the Cardinal
this season. In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
Stanford was defeated 6-1. But within 10 min
utes the tide had turned, as Stanford won
three of the remaining four singles matches.
In the fourth spot, Chris Cocotos defeated
Jon Leach 4-6, 6-2, 7-6. Freshman Jeff
Salzenstein came through with a tremendous
win in the fifth slot over Hungarian Davis
Cupper Andres Lanyi 4-6, 6-3, 7-6. Ricky
Becker, who has started in only three singles
matches this year, quickly followed with a 3-6,
6-3, 7-6 victory over Adam Peterson.
"Losing at No. 5 and 6 was a surprise,"
MacPhie said. "Usually that's where we're
strongest."
In the No. 2 spot, No. 18 Robert Devens
was defeated by Swedish Davis Cupper David
Ekerot 6-4, 2-6,6-2.
In a 3-3 deadlock, the teams headed into

doubles. Salzenstein and partner Jim Thomas
fell quickly to No. 17 Black and Kent Seton 6-
1,6-1.
On courts 1 and 2, it was a battle of wills.
No. 29 Flanagan and Cocotos edged out No.
21 Leach and MacPhie in three exhausting
sets 1-6, 7-6, 6-4. "We just tried to wear them
down and stay in the points for as long as pos
sible," Flanagan said.
Suddenly the entire match, over five-and
a-half-hours of play, rested on the outcome of
the third-set tiebreaker taking place on Court
2. Patel and Devens had hit one winner after
the next and saved balls that were surely
unreachable. At 6-6, Patel went for an over
head smash to put the Cardinal at game-set
match point... but mishit it out of the court.
The next ball went into the net, clinching the
win for Ekerot and Lanyi (3-6, 7-6, 7-6) and
for the whole Trojan squad.
The weekend was only half over, however,
and Cardinal coach Dick Gould was concerned
about how the team would play against the
Bruins. "We need to come back emotionally
and psychologically after today," he said.
Despite a slow start on Sunday, his team
did not let him down. Salzenstein easily
defeated Fritz Bissell 6-4, 6-1, but the score
was tied 1-1 as Cocotos lost to No. 41 Davide
Sanguinetti 6-3, 6-4.
The Cardinal gained momentum as Becker
defeated Matt Quinlan 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 and
Devens and Patel won their second sets to

stay alive in close matches. Flana
gan soon defeated Canadian
Davis Cupper Sebastien Leßlanc
6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Patel followed suit
with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 triumph over
No. 33 Jason Sher.
At 4-1, Stanford was on the
verge of upsetting the Bruins in
singles alone. Devens, bearing the
weight of another possible Cardi
nal victory, was at 4-4 in the third
set.
But Janecek broke Devens'
serve to go up 5-4 and then served
to win, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Five hours after the match had

started, fans who had been to Fri
day's match were experiencing
deja vu. At No. 3 doubles, Becker
and Salzenstein were the first to
fall 6-3, 6-2 to Quinlan and Darin
Pleasant.
Flanagan and Cocotos never
did have the edge over Leßlanc
and Janecek, and soon the French
Canadian duo had a 6-4, 6-3 victo
ry under their belts.
At 4-4, the match once again
rested on the play of Patel and
Devens. A 3-1 Cardinal lead in the
third set quickly diminished as
Bissell and Sanguinetti came
charging back into the match. At
4-4, Patel adamantly held serve to
take a 5-4 lead, and a few points
later sealed the match with a win
