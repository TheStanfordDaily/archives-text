It just doesn't get any better than this.
The Cardinal men's tennis team treated
hundreds of fans to a 12-hour performance of

unmatched skill and unwavering determina
tion this weekend as they battled with the
giants of collegiate tennis, No. 2 USC and No.
1 UCLA, at Stanford Tennis Stadium. When
all was said and done, the Cardinal came away
with a 5-4 upset over the Bruins and a 5-4 loss

to the Trojans.
Friday's contest with the Trojans could not
have been closer. Nine matches went to three
sets and four of those were decided in
tiebreakers. Only No. 99 Vimal Patel, playing
in the third slot, had a lopsided singles match,
losing quickly to Zimbabwean Davis Cupper
Wayne Black, 6-1, 6-4.
After that, the 900 fans in attendance set
tled in for fierce three-set battles on every
court. The next player to fall was Stanford's
top hitter, No. 7 Michael Flanagan. No. 8
Brian MacPhie, who has been out for most of
the season, edged Flanagan 3-6, 6-2, 7-6.
With a 2-0 lead, the Trojans were on their
way to their second tromping of the Cardinal
this season. In Los Angeles two weeks ago,
Stanford was defeated 6-1. But within 10 min
utes the tide had turned, as Stanford won
three of the remaining four singles matches.
In the fourth spot, Chris Cocotos defeated
Jon Leach 4-6, 6-2, 7-6. Freshman Jeff
Salzenstein came through with a tremendous
win in the fifth slot over Hungarian Davis
Cupper Andres Lanyi 4-6, 6-3, 7-6. Ricky
Becker, who has started in only three singles
matches this year, quickly followed with a 3-6,
6-3, 7-6 victory over Adam Peterson.
"Losing at No. 5 and 6 was a surprise,"
MacPhie said. "Usually that's where we're
strongest."
In the No. 2 spot, No. 18 Robert Devens
was defeated by Swedish Davis Cupper David
Ekerot 6-4, 2-6,6-2.
In a 3-3 deadlock, the teams headed into

doubles. Salzenstein and partner Jim Thomas
fell quickly to No. 17 Black and Kent Seton 6-
1,6-1.
On courts 1 and 2, it was a battle of wills.
No. 29 Flanagan and Cocotos edged out No.
21 Leach and MacPhie in three exhausting
sets 1-6, 7-6, 6-4. "We just tried to wear them
down and stay in the points for as long as pos
sible," Flanagan said.
Suddenly the entire match, over five-and
a-half-hours of play, rested on the outcome of
the third-set tiebreaker taking place on Court
2. Patel and Devens had hit one winner after
the next and saved balls that were surely
unreachable. At 6-6, Patel went for an over
head smash to put the Cardinal at game-set
match point... but mishit it out of the court.
The next ball went into the net, clinching the
win for Ekerot and Lanyi (3-6, 7-6, 7-6) and
for the whole Trojan squad.
The weekend was only half over, however,
and Cardinal coach Dick Gould was concerned
about how the team would play against the
Bruins. "We need to come back emotionally
and psychologically after today," he said.
Despite a slow start on Sunday, his team
did not let him down. Salzenstein easily
defeated Fritz Bissell 6-4, 6-1, but the score
was tied 1-1 as Cocotos lost to No. 41 Davide
Sanguinetti 6-3, 6-4.
The Cardinal gained momentum as Becker
defeated Matt Quinlan 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 and
Devens and Patel won their second sets to
