The Cardinal returned from Los Angeles
on Saturday night with a Pacific 10 South
Championship firmly in hand, but under
standably has its sights set on a greater
prize.
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(23-2, 9-1 Pac-10 South) handed it to USC
and UCLA in short order this weekend,
besting the No. 5 Trojans 7-2 and the No.
13 Bruins 5-1. The Cardinal concluded the
1993 regular season by sweeping the season
series with the Los Angeles teams.
The matches also marked the return of
redshirt freshman Kim Shasby and junior
Amy Chiminello to the lineup for Stanford.
Shasby, ranked No. 7 in the latest Intercol
legiate Tennis Association poll, played No. 4
singles this weekend due to a nagging mus
cle iryury in her foot, while Chiminello
returned to play No. 5 after a bout with the
flu last week.
The presence of Shasby and Chiminello
helped offset the loss of No. 1 Laxmi Poruri
from competition this weekend. Poruri
remained home with her father, who under
went surgery this weekend. Senior captain
Heather Willens took over the No. 1 spot in
singles, blowing by USC's Suzanne Ital
iano, 6-1, 6-0.
Junior Kristine Kurth was not as fortu
nate in the No. 2 match against USC, how
ever, falling to Petra Schmitt by a 6-1, 6-4
score. Her doubles partner, freshman Beth

Berris, met a similar fate in the No. 3
match, losing to Maggie Simkova, 6-3, 6-2.
Shasby and Chiminello, however,
enjoyed a triumphant return to singles
play, as No. 4 Shasby outlasted Courtney
Ross, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, while Chiminello took
Carla Quaresma in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
Junior Emma Woodhouse notched Stan
ford's fourth win of the day at the No. 6 sin
gles spot, edging USC's Ayisha Zaman, 2-6,
6-0, 7-5.
In doubles, however, it was all Cardinal.
Berris and Kurth, playing at the No. 1 dou
bles spot, downed USC's Italiano and
Schmitt, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, while Willens paired
with Chiminello in the No. 2 doubles match
to roll over Quaresma and Simkova, 6-2, 6-
4. Freshman Wendy Sacks and Woodhouse
rounded out the dual-match win at No. 3
doubles with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Sayaka
Kimura and Jennifer Milligan.
In Saturday's match against UCLA,
Stanford wrapped up the Pac-10 South
crown without even having to go to doubles.
In the marquee matchup of the day, No. 1
Willens topped Keri Phebus, ranked No. 11
in the country, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5, in Willens' last
career regular-season match.
"Six water polo scrubs were there with
'PHEBUS' spelled on their chests, and they
were cheering so loud you couldn't hear on
the court," Cardinal coach Frank Brennan
said. "But when Heather won, it was one of
the happiest occasions I've seen in a non-
