# Bruins brandish broom, blank batters

A Cardinal squad desperately in
need of some Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division wins got nothing of
the sort this weekend, dropping three
to UCLA at Jackie Robinson Field in
Los Angeles.
After losing a pair of heartbreak
ers, 7-6 and 7-5, on Friday and Satur
day, Stanford (19-18 overall, 6-12 Six-
Pac) was never in yesterday's game,
mustering only three hits in a 6-2
defeat.
The fortunes of the No. 13 Bruins
(22-12, 10-8), who moved up a slot to
third place in the division race, have
rested all season on the production of
an experienced lineup. This weekend's
series was no exception — in all three
games, UCLA produced when it mat
tered most.
Willie Adams (7-2) took the mound
for Stanford on Friday and looked
dominating in the early going. Staked
to a 1-0 lead in the third inning,
Adams surrendered a two-out, three
run home to run the the Bruins' Ryan
McGuire. McGuire leads the Six-Pac
in home runs with 16.
"McGuire's one of the better first
basemen in college baseball," said

Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "He's
proven that he's gonna hurt you at
the plate."
Steve Carver brought the Cardinal
within one in the fourth. His first col
legiate home run made the score 3-2.
Again, however, the Bruins answered
back immediately. Third baseman
Adam Melljuse began the UCLA
fourth with a single up the middle.
With two outs, Brett Schafer
reached on catcher's interference.
This two-out mistake proved crucial
— three hits later, the score was 7-2
Bruins.
Stanford shortstop Jed Hansen
brought the Cardinal back in the fifth,
belting a three-run home run over the
fence in the left-field corner. Hansen
now has five home runs on the season.
Hansen's RBI fielder's choice in
the seventh cut the Bruin lead to 7-6.
But Stanford would not score again,
stranding two runners in both the
eighth and ninth innings against
Bruin ace reliever Gabe Sollecito.
"We were close," Marquess said,
"But when we needed a hit, we
couldn't do that — give a lot of credit
to UCLA."
Like Adams, Andrew Lorraine (6-4)
was burned for each mistake he made
on the mound Saturday. Todd

Laßocca and Brian Dallimore home
runs gave the Cardinal a 4-1 edge in
the sixth.
But Lorraine, who pitched his sixth
complete game of the season, got into
some late-inning trouble. The junior
gave up only three walks on the after
noon. All three, however, led off
innings. All three scored.
With the score tied at five in the
ninth, Lorraine walked Dave Roberts
to lead off the frame. With one out,
catcher Matt Schwenke stepped to the
plate.
Schwenke, 0-for-25 against Stan
ford in his career and batting only
.209 on the season, ripped his second
homerun of the season, giving the
Bruins the 7-5 win.
UCLA sealed the series with an
exclamation point. Where the Cardi
nal could blame missed opportunities
on their first two losses, it was simply
outplayed yesterday.
Roberts led off the first inning with a
walk, scoring on a Melhuse single. But
Stanford starter Todd Bartels (0-2)
settled down, striking out the side in the
second and turning a nifty double play
in the third.
Bartels' success, however, was
