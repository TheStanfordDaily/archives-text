# Spikers shuffle deck, ace Aztecs
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Backed into a corner on Satur
day afternoon, the Stanford men's
volleyball team came out fighting
and clawed out a four-game victo
ry over visiting San Diego State.
In a match that meant nothing
to the third-ranked Cardinal (17-4,
15-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration), but might have cost the
Aztecs (17-12, 11-8) an MPSF
Tournament bid, the first notable
occurrence was Stanford swing
hitter Bob Hillman landing on his
ankle awkwardly.
With a cry, "This happens to
me every time I play volleyball!"
Hillman hobbled over to the train
er. Although not broken, Hill
man's ankle kept him out of the
rest of the match.
To compensate, coach Ruben
Nieves moved Canyon Ceman
from setter to swing hitter and
sent senior Jimmy Blackman in at
setter. While the Cardinal was
adjusting to this new lineup, San
Diego State took immediate
advantage and pounded out a 15-8
win behind swing hitter John
Hyden's nine kills and two strong
blocks of Cardinal opposite hitter
David Goss.
"It took a little bit of adjusting
to get used to Jimmy's sets," Goss
said. "Iln the second gamel Jimmy
began to set the ball great and we
started to click."
In the second game, Stanford
raced out to a 10-3 lead, highlight
ed by a kill that Ryan Moss plas
tered into an Aztec's chest. After a
few side-outs, Ceman stepped up
with an imposing block of Hyden,
then spiked two consecutive balls
to the Burn ham floor. Goss added
an ace, then a kill to end the game,
15-5.
This game was marked by the
surprising offensive eruption of
Moos. Not known for his hitting,
Moos compensated for the loss of
Hillman's 4.19 kills-per-game with
15 on the match, three off a career

high.
"My shoulder exercises seem to
be helping," Moos said. "I strongly
feel that's been the difference —
it's the difference between the ball
hitting off the block and someone
bumping it up and the ball hitting
off the block and 'Sayonara.' "
Phillip Jackson then came off
the bench for San Diego State
and led the Aztecs to an 8-3
advantage, but the Cardinal
scraped its way back behind the
play of Ail-American Goss.
Undaunted by the strong Aztec
blocking front, he continued to
pound away. Goss ended the
game with six kills in a row, and
nine of his last 10 swings landed
as Stanford was victorious, 15-
10. On the match, Goss led all
hitters with 40 kills, hitting .384.
Not to be outdone, fellow All-
American Ceman started the
fourth game implanting a spike
through Todd Yarbrough's face
that knocked the middle blocker
back two feet. Ceman was the dif
ference in this game, as his spikes
cemented a 15-11 Stanford win.
"I don't have that great a hit
ting strategy, except I like to hit it
really hard," Ceman said. "|By the
end of the match] I started getting
warmer, and I started hitting the
ball higher and harder."
On the match Ceman had 22
kills, besting his career high by 15,
and hit .417.
Last Saturday, in Stanford's
loss to USC, the Cardinal had
started both Blackman and Mike
Lambert in place of Ceman and
Goss. Assistant coach John Kosty
thought that experience prepared
Blackman for his surprisingly
major role against San Diego
State.
"This was exactly the situation
we were playing Jimmy and Mike
for," Kosty said. "Jimmy came in
and set a really good game."
"I thought I set well," Black
man said. "I pride myself on my
consistency ... I pattern my game
after AC. Green."
