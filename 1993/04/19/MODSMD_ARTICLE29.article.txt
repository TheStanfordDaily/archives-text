# Track fares well at Mt. SAC Invite
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
In split-squad competition last
weekend, the Stanford track and
field team ushered in the "cham
pionship portion" of the season
with several personal bests,
Pacific 10 Conference Finals
qualifying marks and NCAA pro
visional qualifying times.
Sixteen Cardinal team mem
bers were represented at the
prestigious Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Invitational in Southern Cal
ifornia, while the rest of the
squad headed to San Francisco to
compete in the Johnny Mathis
Invitational.
As advertised before the meet,
the Mt. SAC Invite attracted
world-class athletes from 15
nations and across the United
States, as well as top-notch colle
giate competitors and unattached
professionals. The Cardinal made
use of the excellent field of com
petitors by posting four individu
al personal bests and two NCAA
provisional times.
Freshman Rene Rodriguez
highlighted the meet by breaking
Stanford's long-standing fresh
man record in the 400-meter race
with a time of 46.94 seconds.
"It was a really good run for
him, because he beat Jim Cram
ton's 1988 time by more than a
quarter second," said assistant
coach Scott Chisam. "Usually,
records are broken by hundreths
of a second, but Rene completely
destroyed the old mark."
Junior distance runner Louise
Watson also had an impressive
outing, as she hit an NCAA pro
visional time (9:23.20) in her
first 3,000-meter race of the sea
son. Watson's provisional mark
will most likely guarantee her a
trip to New Orleans for June's
NCAA Finals, as very few people
achieve the automatic NCAA
qualifying mark in that event,

according to Chisam.
Despite reaching an NCAA
provisional mark of his own
(14:12.88) in the 5,000, senior
Dave Scudamore's time does not
stand up against other automatic
qualifiers this year, according to
Chisam.
"I need to run about 15 sec
onds faster in order to qualify,"
Scudamore said, "But right now
my main focus is on qualifying
for the NCAAs in the 10,000,
because that's what I ran last
year."
For the women, freshman
Laura Hayward posted a person
al best of 36:06.84 in the 10,000,
shaving two minutes off her old
time, while Sarah Truitt
improved to 17:29.90 in the
5,000. Sophomore Melissa Free
berg finished the 1,500 in a per
sonal-best time of 4:36.80.
Christy Boyd also had an out
standing meet as she finished
fourth in the 400 hurdles in
63.07 and second in the 100 hur
dles in 14.53. Dena Dey joined
the list of 12 Stanford Pac-10
qualifiers by clocking a 2:11.02 in
the 800.
In addition to Cardinal com
petitors, spectators at the Mt.
SAC Invite also witnessed the
Santa Monica Track Club team of
Floyd Heard, Leroy Burrell, Mike
Marsh and Carl Lewis set the
fastest 4 x 100 relay time this
year.
"Mt. SAC is by far the best
meet in the United States thus
far," said thrower John Fowler.
"Some of the best marks of the
year were set there. I was just
staring wide-eyed the entire
time."
At the Johnny Mathis Invita
tional, where 45 Cardinal com
petitors participated, the meet
was marred by rainy conditions.
Most of the competitors agreed
that the overall conditions were
not "conducive to good times."
