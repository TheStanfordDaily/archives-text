# New COP faces disgruntled electorate, daunting challenges
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
When the ASSU election returns from
the first day's voting were posted late
Thursday night, junior Ron Brown's
smile was a mixture of elation, exhaustion
and relief.
His "A Clean Slate," the only official
group of candidates running for the Coun
cil of Presidents, led its nearest competi
tor by over 1,000 votes. The race was, for
all intents and purposes, over.
Having attained the highest office in
Stanford student government, what

would Brown, and fellow
slate members Ying-Ying
Goh, Delia Lopez and
Jason Snyder do to cele
brate? "To start out, we're

going to take a break this weekend and get
caught up in school," Brown said.
It is a rest well-deserved. As this year's
ASSU Senate Chair, Brown, in the ab
sence of a COP, became the government's
unpaid — and unelected — leader. And
he, perhaps more than anyone else, knows
well the opportunities for success and in
vitations to failure that confront this new
student government.

This spring's election stands as a criti
cal hinge on which the fate of the ASSU,
as well as the COP, may turn. After elimi
nating the COP last year, voters last week
resolved to give the office another chance.
How many more chances the COP re
ceives depends largely on how productive
Clean Slate's term proves to be.
"This will be a crucial year," Brown
said on election night. He acknowledged
that despite his slate's convincing tri
umph over write-in candidate "A Blank
Slate," the electorate remains wary. "Peo
ple don't see the ASSU as a vehicle. There
is a feeling of helplessness and disillusion

ment with the ASSU."
Many of the election's political cur
rents support such a perception:
• Though it announced its candidacy
just one week before the election, Blank
Slate — which pledged to do nothing if
elected — conducted a surprisingly strong
campaign. Using the same platform that
carried "I Prefer Not To Have A COP" to
victory last April, Blank Slate received
considerable publicity, forced a debate
with Clean Slate, and salvaged 11 percent
of the popular vote. Goh admitted that,
had Blank Slate been officially placed on
the ballot, Clean Slate's path to victory

would not have been nearly as smooth.
• Only 38.2 percent of the student body
voted in this year's election, compared
with a 44.1 percent turnout last year.
• Less than 4,000 students voted in the
COP race, the lowest amount in 10 years.
• Students also approved an amend
ment to the ASSU Constitution that
makes special fee refunds available to all
students, including those who don't vote.
In essence, the passage of the amendment
removes one of the primary voting incen
tives for politically indifferent students, a
development that could foster even
greater apathy toward the ASSU.
The decline of voter interest
occurred, not coincidentally, with
a decline in the number of candi
dates for Senate. Only 24 stu
dents vied for 20 undergraduate
senate seats, and just six gradu
ate students ran for the same
number of graduate senate slots.
Brown said next year's legisla
ture will feature a "strong group
of senators. There was a small
group of candidates, but I look
forward to working with them."
Yet the campaign for under
graduate senate was marked by a
decided lack of discourse on stu
dent issues, perhaps partly
attributable to the disappearance
of party politics.
While candidates trumpeted
their commitment to vague topics
such as financial-aid advocacy,
summer storage, cable television
and a Taco Bell in Tresidder, few
offered tangible proposals on how
to achieve such goals.
The ennui of the senate race
was symbolized by the enormous

success of sophomore Roberto
Milk's "Milk the Vote" campaign,
which catapulted Milk to the top
spot among undergraduate vote
getters. When asked for the key
to his victory, Milk said frankly,
"80 people walking around with
my name on their backpacks."
Unfortunately, the lack of
choice and engaging debate in the
senate campaign may hinder the
solution to an increasing problem
in that body: its separation from
the interests of the electorate.
In February, for example, the
senate soundly rejected the spe
cial-fee requests of The Daily and
the Stanford Solar Car Project.
After successfully petitioning for
placement on the ballot, both
groups were approved by over 60
percent of the voters last week.
The tolerance of graduate stu
dents for the ASSU may have run
out already. With many stalwart
graduate senators gone from the
political scene and at least 12 new
write-in members who have not
publicly expressed any desire to
serve, graduate students could
find their concerns ignored by the
ASSU next year.
In fact, several senate leaders

are anticipating an overhaul of the
relationship between graduate
students and the ASSU. Graduate
senator Sanford Dickert, angered
by voters' denial of the Graduate
Student Association's fee request,
suggested that the time has come
for graduate students to fend for
themselves. "Graduates should
vote for graduate issues, under
graduates for undergraduate
issues," Dickert said.
"We will definitely look at re
evaluating the role graduate stu
dents play in the ASSU," Brown
said. "We'll see if graduates even
want to be in the ASSU."
The restoration of the COP
ensures that, structurally, busi
ness as usual has returned to the
ASSU — at least for this year.
But, as many of the results from
the election evince, dissatisfac
tion among the electorate is still
keen and many students are still
waiting for change.
The respite for the members of
Clean Slate lasts until next
month, when the new govern
ment convenes. After that, the
tough task of instilling a new
faith in student government
begins.
