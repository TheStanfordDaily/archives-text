# New COP faces disgruntled electorate, daunting challenges

When the ASSU election returns from
the first day's voting were posted late
Thursday night, junior Ron Brown's
smile was a mixture of elation, exhaustion
and relief.
His "A Clean Slate," the only official
group of candidates running for the Coun
cil of Presidents, led its nearest competi
tor by over 1,000 votes. The race was, for
all intents and purposes, over.
Having attained the highest office in
Stanford student government, what

would Brown, and fellow
slate members Ying-Ying
Goh, Delia Lopez and
Jason Snyder do to cele
brate? "To start out, we're

going to take a break this weekend and get
caught up in school," Brown said.
It is a rest well-deserved. As this year's
ASSU Senate Chair, Brown, in the ab
sence of a COP, became the government's
unpaid — and unelected — leader. And
he, perhaps more than anyone else, knows
well the opportunities for success and in
vitations to failure that confront this new
student government.

This spring's election stands as a criti
cal hinge on which the fate of the ASSU,
as well as the COP, may turn. After elimi
nating the COP last year, voters last week
resolved to give the office another chance.
How many more chances the COP re
ceives depends largely on how productive
Clean Slate's term proves to be.
"This will be a crucial year," Brown
said on election night. He acknowledged
that despite his slate's convincing tri
umph over write-in candidate "A Blank
Slate," the electorate remains wary. "Peo
ple don't see the ASSU as a vehicle. There
is a feeling of helplessness and disillusion

ment with the ASSU."
Many of the election's political cur
rents support such a perception:
• Though it announced its candidacy
just one week before the election, Blank
Slate — which pledged to do nothing if
elected — conducted a surprisingly strong
campaign. Using the same platform that
carried "I Prefer Not To Have A COP" to
victory last April, Blank Slate received
considerable publicity, forced a debate
with Clean Slate, and salvaged 11 percent
of the popular vote. Goh admitted that,
had Blank Slate been officially placed on
the ballot, Clean Slate's path to victory

would not have been nearly as smooth.
• Only 38.2 percent of the student body
voted in this year's election, compared
with a 44.1 percent turnout last year.
• Less than 4,000 students voted in the
COP race, the lowest amount in 10 years.
• Students also approved an amend
ment to the ASSU Constitution that
makes special fee refunds available to all
students, including those who don't vote.
In essence, the passage of the amendment
removes one of the primary voting incen
tives for politically indifferent students, a
development that could foster even
