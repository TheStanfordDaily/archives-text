# Wet Earth Day
## 2,000 brave rainy weather to celebrate Mother Earth 
### Matt Gregory Neerad Lal Staff writers 
Intermittent rain kept the crowds at Saturday's
Earth Day celebration small, but it couldn't damp
en the enthusiasm of those who turned out to cel
ebrate the environment.
In Frost Amphitheater, where about 20
singers, speakers and dancers performed, the
showers forced organizers to shuffle events to en
sure the show went on.
"The rain kept away a lot of people, but overall
we thought it was a success," said Michael Cohen,
one of the event's coordinators. "We would have
liked to reach more people, but there are some
things you just can't control."
Cohen said that approximately 2,000 people —
ranging from students to families from around the
Bay Area — attended the events in Frost and near
by Angell Field. Organizers had expected as many
as 5,000 to participate.
Outside Frost, hundreds of people trekked
through the damp earth near Angell Field, where
many companies displayed how they could operate
in a more "earth-friendly" manner, while activists
proposed ways for individuals to help save our
planet.
"I'm glad we have a day to celebrate that we
have an Earth to live on," said fifth-grader Max
Fox, expressing the spirit of the festival.
Fox and his "little gang" of mobile salesmen
roamed the fair selling Earth Day badges for $1
each, using their contagious grins to coax potential
customers.
"It's sad that rain, which is good for the earth,

is had for our business today," said
Alex Mednick, a representative
from Multi-Pure Drinking Water
Systems, a company that proposes
replacing bottled water with tap
water-refining devices.
"There was only half an hour of
sunshine the whole day," recapped
Mednick's daughter, Michelle.
Nonetheless she and droves of
other children wandered around in
excited curiosity of what Earth
Day was all about.
A potpourri of vendors, stu
dents and others set-up shop and
hawked their wares. Booths hous
ing everything from jewellers who
crafted trinkets out of junkyard
material to science teams propos
ing devices that make use of solar
power lined the fields.
"I was surprised at how many
more companies came than expect
ed," said Bob Serina, a graduate
student in environmental studies
at San Jose State University.
And while the children were
exploring the booths outside Fros£,
speakers were exploring the deeper
meaning of Earth Day inside the
amphitheater. Donald Aitkin of
the Union of Concerned Scientists
addressed a noontime crowd of
approximately 150 people.
Discussing the impact of envi
ronmental change in California,
Aitkin said a 3-degree rise in aver
age temperature could bankrupt

the state. The reduction of the
Sierra snowpack would hurt both
the ski industry and the state's
water supply, he said.
Later, poet Ken Fields and
author Mary Jane Moffett each
commemorated the late Wallace
Stegner, the Stanford English pro
fessor emeritus who died Tuesday,
by reading selections from his work.
The crowd began to grow as the
Congolese-American rock group
Bole Bantu took the stage around
12:30 p.m., bringing the sun out
with it. Some of the bolder fans
even started to dance.
But the crowd didn't peak until
later in the afternoon, when Rep.
Anna Eshoo tried to make the best
of the weather. "Let's thank this
good earth for all this rain today,"
she said, praising her district's
strong support of environmental
protection. Eshoo's reference to
the Endangered Species Act, which
she supports, drew loud cheers
from the audience.
Then the Earth Circus Perfor
mance Troupe, rescheduled from
earlier in the day because of the
difficulty of performing acrobatics
in the wet weather, demonstrated
their agility on stilts in an enig
matic skit which described the
ongoing conflict between technolo
gy and nature.
One part of their performance
featured a "salesman of the
future" vending, among other
things, a product to help one "sur
vive carbon-monoxide clouds."
At the opposite end of the fair,

representatives from Apple Com
puter explained how their new
packaging was completely bio
degradable, while Romic Chemical,
a local recycling plant, showed
viewers how filthy waste products,
such as solvents and anti-freeze,
could be transformed back into
their pure forms.
The fair provided all partici
pants with food for hunger, as well
as for thought. An "environmen
tally sound" fast-food tent fea
tured such popular items as tofu
burgers and bean sprout sand
wiches.
But the most popular item all
day seemed to have been folk
singer Michelle Shocked, who
eschewed an environmental mes
sage for a musical one.
"I'm not sure what to say ...
seems like [events) like this end up
preaching to the converted,"
Shocked said. "So I'll just enter
tain the troops."
Shocked did just that, perform
ing a variety of songs on subjects
ranging from hobos to abortion.
She also mentioned the Rodney
King verdict, announced early that
morning, while introducing a song
on police brutality.
Freshman Nathan Gove, an
Earth Day volunteer, said that
Shocked's presence shows that
"Earth Day is a lot more than say
ing phrases like 'Recycle' or 'Save
the Rainforest.' Earth Day and the
environmental movement are
more about enjoying the Earth,
too."
