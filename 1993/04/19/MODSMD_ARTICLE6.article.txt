# Honoring the dead,
## Survivor recounts Holocaust horror 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Concentration camp survivor Philip Bialowitz
spoke about his experiences at the hands of Nazi cap
tors Saturday night, saying he hopes to help insure
that the horrors of the Holocaust never happen
again.
"My story is a testament," he said. "It is dedicated
to the innocent who perished in the middle of the for
est, hidden from the world."
More than 100 people gathered in Tresidder's
Oak Lounge to listen to Bialowitz, the father of
freshman Joe Bialowitz, as part of Yom HaShoah,
Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Translated literally as "day of devastation," Yom
HaShoah is a Jewish holiday designed to remember
and honor the six million Jews who died at the hands
of the Nazis during World War 11.
According to the speakers, memories of the Holo
caust will ensure that a horror of its magnitude
never happens again. In addition, they said, it will
demonstrate that the spirit of the Jewish people is
still alive, despite the Nazis' efforts.
"The events of the Holocaust are so horrifying,
they seem unbelievable, a fiction of the mind. But
this was no fiction," said Philip Bialowitz. "Most peo
ple only dream their nightmares, but I lived mine."
Imprisoned in the Polish concentration camp of
Sobibor at the age of 15, Bialowitz helped plan and
carry out the escape of6oo prisoners in 1943, during
the largest prisoner uprising of the war. One of the
characters in the film "Escape from Sobibor" is
based on him.
Bialowitz said, as a witness to the horrors of the
Holocaust, he feels a duty and a responsibility to its
victims. "My story is a testament," he said. "It is ded-
icated to the innocent who per
ished in the middle of the forest,
hidden from the world."
Speaking quickly, he recounted
how he and other family members
were picked up by the Nazis short
ly after the 1943 Warsaw ghetto
revolt and transported to Sobibor.
"Sobibor was a pure extermina
tion camp. People were gassed on
arrival," he said. But Bialowitz
and his brother were spared as
slave labor at the camp, replacing
prisoners who had died the day
before they arrived.
Though the laborers often
entertained thoughts of escape,
Bialowitz said they believed it
would be impossible. But gradual

ly, a sea of resistance grew;
Bialowitz and his brother were
among a group that met secretly
to plan an escape.
According to Bialowitz, at 4
p.m. on October 14, 1943, the
escape began. Claiming a problem
in a workshop, he said laborers
lured several key Nazi officers into
buildings and killed them.
Soon, with a shout that "the
moment of destiny has come!" the
revolt began. Avoiding gunfire,
Bialowitz said prisoners climbed
the barbed-wire fences and ran
past minefields that ringed the
camp. Three hundred prisoners
reached safety, including
Bialowitz.
One of 15 former Sobibor pris
oners still alive today, Bialowitz
said he sometimes questions why
he, out of all others, was allowed to

survive. "I think .. . that we sur
vivors are 'the still small voices of
souls exterminated before their
time,' " he said.
And though a half-century
has passed since the Holocaust,
the service Saturday night
stressed that the crimes still
carry importance for all people
living today, as they raise ques
tions of responsibility and the
value of diversity.
"The Nazi crimes against the
Jews have rightly been identified
as ... an attack upon human
diversity. If we question that
diversity, we question the very
notion of humanity," said Univer
sity President Casper in a written
statement read during the service.
Casper stressed the need to
"accept diversity and accept the
autonomy of every human being."
