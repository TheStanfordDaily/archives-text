# 'Asian-American studies now'
## 70 protest lack of autonomous major, march to Casper's office 
### Nick Kuritzky 
Stanford boasts majors in African-
American and feminist studies as well
as a sizable offering of classes in Jewish
and Chicano studies. Now several stu
dents said they feel the time has come
for a program of Asian-American stud
ies.
About 70 people protested the lack of
an Asian-American studies major yes
terday with a noon rally that began
with the beating of traditional Taiko

drums in White Plaza and ended in a
march to University President Gerhard
Casper's office.
The rally — which came three weeks
after the release of a survey of student
attitudes on Asian-American studies —
was held in conjunction with similar
protests at UC-Berkeley, UC-Irvine
and Pomona college.
"This is more than just an AASA
issue," said Eliot Lee, the issues co
chair for the Asian-American Student
Association. "There is a statewide men

tality to have minority studies pro
grams."
Speakers at the rally included repre
sentatives of the Asian-American com
munity, ASSU Senate and other orga
nizations, such as MEChA and the
Black Student Union. Several pointed
out that while nearly a quarter of the
undergraduate population is Asian-
American, Stanford only offers two
classes in Asian-American studies.

ASSU Senator-elect Garheng Kong speaks at a rally in White Plaza protesting the lack of an Asian-American studies
major at Stanford. The rally ended with a march to University President Gerhard Casper's office.
"Asian-Americans have been
here for over 300 years," said
freshman Laura Kim. "(Yet)
Stanford fails to recognize the
rich historical past and complex
problems facing those in the
Asian-American community."
"The administration lacks ini
tiative," agreed freshman Jerry
Chen, a member of Asian and
Pacific Islanders for Change at
Stanford, a group that helped
organize the rally. "It is up to stu
dents to push for this mayor."
After the speakers' presenta
tions, the group marched toward
Casper's office, chanting "Asian-
American Studies now." When

the group reached the Inner
Quad, marchers held a moment of
silence "to represent the silencing
of Asian-American voices by the
lack of an Asian-American studies
major at Stanford."
The group then delivered a
hand-out advocating an Asian-
American studies program to
Casper's office, leaving it with his
secretary.
According to Lee, the rally was
designed "to raise awareness of
the lack of an Asian-American
studies so that when the
time comes for the administration
to decide on such a program, stu
dents will show support."
Not everyone passing by the
rally was fully supportive, howev
er.
Sophomore Cyd Zweigler said
he waivers on supporting an

Asian-American studies major. "I
really don't understand the need
for a program — not being Asian-
American I want to know why I
should be supportive."
Junior Rick St. John also had
his doubts. Describing the rally as
"rather silly," he said, "Ethnic
studies have been too politicized
over the years. In this time of
budget cutting for academics,
Asian-American studies is a zero
sum gain. It will take away fund
ing from other departments."
During his speech, junior Ken
Tan said that the program will be
"funded by previously untapped
sources," but did not elaborate on
what those sources are.
Students passed out a handout
emphasizing the recent survey,
which found 96 percent of minori
ties and 90 percent of white stu

dents believed there were "too
few Asian-American classes
offered."
"The administration has disre-.
garded this survey and the UCMI
(University Committee on Minor
ity Issues) recommendation that
Stanford implement more classes
in Asian-American Studies,"
Chen said.
Speakers announced plans to
call for the implementation of an
Asian-American studies depart
ment and tenure track positions
at tonight's ASSU's senate meet
ing.
Tan, who said he feels
"marginalized" by the lack of an
Asian-American studies program
at Stanford, said the group "will
not be asking the administration
for this program; we will be
demanding it."
