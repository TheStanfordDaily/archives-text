# 'Asian-American studies now'
## 70 protest lack of autonomous major, march to Casper's office

Stanford boasts majors in African-
American and feminist studies as well
as a sizable offering of classes in Jewish
and Chicano studies. Now several stu
dents said they feel the time has come
for a program of Asian-American stud
ies.
About 70 people protested the lack of
an Asian-American studies major yes
terday with a noon rally that began
with the beating of traditional Taiko

drums in White Plaza and ended in a
march to University President Gerhard
Casper's office.
The rally — which came three weeks
after the release of a survey of student
attitudes on Asian-American studies —
was held in conjunction with similar
protests at UC-Berkeley, UC-Irvine
and Pomona college.
"This is more than just an AASA
issue," said Eliot Lee, the issues co
chair for the Asian-American Student
Association. "There is a statewide men

tality to have minority studies pro
grams."
Speakers at the rally included repre
sentatives of the Asian-American com
munity, ASSU Senate and other orga
nizations, such as MEChA and the
Black Student Union. Several pointed
out that while nearly a quarter of the
undergraduate population is Asian-
American, Stanford only offers two
classes in Asian-American studies.
