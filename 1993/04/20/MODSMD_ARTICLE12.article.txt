## 86 believed dead after fire destroys Koresh compound 
### 
WACO, Texas (AP) â€” Doomsday cult
leader David Koresh's apocalyptic vision
came true yesterday when fires believed
set by his followers destroyed their
prairie compound as federal agents tried
to drive them out with tear gas after a 51-
day standoff.
As many as 86 members of the Branch
Davidian religious sect, including Koresh
and 24 children, were thought to have
died as the flames raced through the
wooden buildings in 30 minutes. Only
nine were known to have survived.
The blaze, fanned by stiff winds,
erupted about 10:05 a.m. PDT, just six
hours after FBI agents began using
armored vehicles to pound holes in the
complex of buildings and spray them
with tear gas.
"I can't tell you the shock and the hor
ror that all of us felt when we saw those

flames coming out," FBI spokesman Bob
Ricks said in a solemn afternoon news
conference. "We thought, 'Oh my God,
they are killing themselves.' "
Attorney General Janet Reno said she
personally approved the assault in hopes
of forcing a peaceful ending to the stand
off. She said she never considered the
"chances were great for mass suicide,"
despite Koresh's warning in a letter just
last week that any agents trying to harm
him would be "devoured by fire."
Federal authorities said they wouldn't
know the precise death toll until they
could search an underground maze of
passageways.
"We can only assume that there was a
massive loss of life," Ricks said. "It was
truly an inferno of flames."
The FBI previously had said two of the
women in the compound were pregnant, one

of whom was due to deliver in May. They
apparently were not among the survivors.
Four of the survivors were hospital
ized with burns and broken bones; the
five others were in custody in the McLen
nan County Jail.
One survivor told authorities that peo
ple inside the compound had set the blaze,
said Justice Department spokesman Carl
Stern. The man said that as he left one of
the buildings, "he could hear above him
people saying, 'The fire's been lit, the
fire's been lit,' " Stern said.
Ricks said multiple witnesses, includ
ing FBI snipers positioned outside the
compound, spotted cult members setting
fires.
"We did not introduce fire into this
compound," Ricks said. "David Koresh,
we believe, gave the order to commit sui
cide, and they all followed willingly his

order. He wanted to have as many people
killed in that compound as possible."
Late in the day, Reno told reporters the
FBl's assault was meant to be "a step for
ward" that "would increase pressure" on
the cultists to end the standoff.
"Obviously," she said, "if I had
thought that the chances were great for
mass suicide, I would never have
approved the plan."
Yesterday's action began well before
dawn when federal agents notified the
compound's neighbors "that it would end
today," according to Melanie Felton, a
nearby rancher. At 3:55 a.m., the FBI
telephoned the compound and told Steve
Schneider, considered Koresh's top lieu
tenant, that agents would gas the com
plex unless cult members surrendered
immediately. Schneider hung up.
A combat engineering vehicle called an

M-60 then moved to the southwest cor
ner of the compound, broke a hole in the
wall and started the gassing. At least 75
to 80 rounds of gunfire came from the
compound in an initial volley.
Agents continued ripping holes in
buildings throughout the morning, and
Ricks spoke calmly at a 8:30 a.m. session
with reporters about the decision to force
Koresh and his followers out.
Ricks said authorities believed the
tear-gassing was the best way to avert a
possible mass suicide, because it would
"cause confusion inside the compound."
But barely 90 minutes later, billowing
flames and smoke began spewing from
the sprawling rural compound. Fire
department units, not on hand through
the early assault, had to be summoned
and arrived about 10:30 a.m., when most
of the buildings were already gutted.
