## Striving for equality 
### 
New undergrad gender
balance not reflected in
all areas of University

Though one might not
notice it in engineering class
es, the gender gap in Stan
ford admissions has decreased, and
next year's freshman class might
have more women than men.
Following national trends, 49.9
percent of the students offered
admission this year are female;
50.1 percent are male. Depending
upon the acceptance rates of both
sexes, women could outnumber
men in the Class of '97.
Certainly, this equality is
laudable and signals the chang
ing course of higher education. It
is definitely a marked departure
from the long-standing image of
male-dominated universities
which offer few opportunities to
women.
But the University cannot
rest on these recent laurels; gen
der discrepancies still exist
among the faculty and within the
graduate programs.
Figures from the beginning of
the year indicate that female grad
uate students constitute a small
minority in most technically ori
ented programs.
While they are a majority in
the School of Education, women
comprise only 16 percent of Engi
neering graduate students, 25
percent of Earth Science gradu
ate students, 28 percent of Busi
ness School students and 38 per
cent of Humanities and Science
graduate students. Only in the
Law School and the School of
Medicine are the number of
women approaching the number
of men. Overall, however, gradu
ate women are outnumbered
4,555 to 1,994.
Similarly, a discrepancy exists
between the number of male and
female professors, with women
constituting only 5 to 8 percent of

scholars teaching business, eco
nomics and the more technical sci
ences. The number is higher for
some departments, but a definite
inequity still remains.
Certainly, a compelling "equity
for equity's sake" argument can be
made about the discrepancies of
sheer numbers.
Based on such reasoning alone,
a more proactive female recruit
ment and hiring policy could be
implemented. But the problems
which are partially or fully the
result of such unequal numbers —
harassment, intimidation in the
classroom, lack of role models —
should identify this area as one
which merits concrete, immediate
action.
Indeed, University-sponsored
committees have recognized these
numbers' impact on the campus
environment: the Women's Needs
Assessment, released in Decem
ber, advised the establishment of
training programs for faculty and
teaching assistants, intended to
enhance sensitivity regarding sex
ism and the classroom. This
report also suggested the creation
of a position designated to advo
cate exclusively on behalf of
women students in cases of gen
der discrimination in all areas on
campus.
The committee's chair, Diana
Akiyama, summed up the situa
tion when she said, "[it is] the
active responsibility of faculty and
deans to make it possible for
female students to have an equal
opportunity to achieve academi
cally."
Stanford certainly has come a
long way since the days when it
would admit only 500 women in
each entering class; the adminis
tration should be commended for
admitting a gender-balanced
prospective Class of 1997.
But although the task of bring
ing more female undergraduate
students to campus seems be pro
gressing, attention to the issue of
women's equity on campus must
not wane. A woman's place
shouldn't be restricted to under
graduate education.
