## The 						sad plight of the frosh 
### 
YOU POOR FRESHMEN. Poor,
pathetic freshmen. You graduated
valedictorian, authored Bill Clin
ton's new economic plan, published short
stories under the pen name "Joyce Carol
Oates" or some other Earth-moving thing
before coming to Stanford on your way to
fame, fortune and love in the Quad.
Everything in your life was perfect.
And then you heard about the Gender
Studies requirement.
To you freshmen and sophomores,
among the first two classes required to
take a course in "Gender Studies" before
graduating, let me just say I'm sorry. You
shouldn't have to take a class in Gender
Studies to graduate from college. No one
should. But you do, and there's a fair
chance it'll be in the Anthropology
Department. It's a cruel world.
The University instituted the Gender
Studies requirement two years ago in the
process of revamping the entire "distribu
tion requirement" system. Surely you are
all familiar with the "DR" system by now.
It goes like this: You need to fill a dis
tasteful DR, say, Technology and Applied
Science. You go to the easiest class that
fills that DR, say, Computer Science 105 a.
You sit through 10 weeks of a class oddly
reminiscent of high school in its quality of
teaching and student interest.
If the "professor" is untenured, you
know you're in the right place.
You learn how to make "Karel the

robot" move from the right side of the
screen to the left. And unless you're like
myself and had an unfortunate experience
regarding your "copying fee," you finish
the class with the best of all grades, "P."
The University is satisfied that it has
provided you with a well-rounded educa
tion. Your parents are satisfied that their
child has received world-class instruction
in yet another subject. And you feel guilty
knowing that Mr. Cunningham's comput
er class at Berkshire Middle School was a
lot harder.
I need not tell you that there are many
ways the distribution system could be
improved. There could be, for instance, a
foreign-language requirement — a seri
ous one, requiring fluency in another
tongue — which would put Stanford on
the path towards becoming the globally
oriented university it wants to be.
And to the administrators' credit,
other recent changes in the required cur
riculum have been positive, such as the
addition of more non-white and female
authors to the CIV reading list.
But on Gender Studies, they goofed.
Adding a Gender Studies requirement
isn't a solution to our DR woes.
If a professor is sexist, this should be
addressed. If there are not a sufficient
number of classes dealing with "gender
issues," this should be addressed. If read
ing lists ignore significant accomplish
ments of women, this should be

addressed.
But students shouldn't be made to
take a Gender Studies class. Not as long
as a class in American history isn't
required. A freshman today can graduate
without taking a single class in biology,
chemistry or physics. They can't without
taking a class in "Gender Studies."
Somethin's happenin' here, what it is
ain't exactly clear. (But I think it's initials
are "P" and "C").
So let's make the classes which are
supposed to "distribute" our education
educational. And let's make sure that
classes which involve gender issues deal
with them in a correct manner. But let's
not require a "Gender Studies" class
while others in rather significant depart
ments, say, mathematics, go untaken by a
large part of the student body.
As far as undergraduate education
goes, "Gender Studies" represents more
unfulfilled promises of glamour and glitz
than any real, substantial engagement
with the subject.
Kind of like the time I was stood up on
that lunch date.

John Ford did not write this column as a
bitter response to getting stood up on that
lunch date. Really.
