'Blank Slate'' — the COP hopefuls that refuse to die

Last Thursday at 9:55 p.m., five
minutes before the close of the elec
tion, three members of "Blank
Slate" were denied the right to vote
because they were attempting to bring
campaign material in the form of sacred
headgear within 150 feet of a polling site.
Our purposeful violation of this dis
criminatory campaign rule was neither
an attempt to affect the election nor
was it yet another flagrant attempt at
publicity.
It was a political statement meant to
bring attention to the ASSU policy
which prohibits campaign material with
in 150 feet of polling sites.
This rule does not prohibit ASSU
Election handbooks at the voting
booths. It does not prevent candidates
on the ballot from getting the best pub

licity of all — their names on every
computer screen. The 150-foot rule only
serves to place write-in candidates at yet
another disadvantage and to further
entrench the political establishment.
Unfortunately, instead of being com
mended for our courageous public
activism, the same sense of civic duty
which originally inspired us to enter the
election fray and give a voice to disen
franchised students everywhere, we
were chastised by the system, threat
ened with disqualification and ordered to
remove ourselves from the area.
The ASSU must have felt that our
election chances had not been damaged
enough by the policy which mandates
that COP slates register months in
advance in order to be put on the ballot.
This archaic policy, originally enacted in

order to allow time for the printing of
ballots, is unnecessary, given the ASSU's
current computerized voting method.
When one realizes that all that was
needed were a few strikes of the key
board, there was no reason why "Blank
Slate" was not on the ballot. We had
filed a Declaration of Intent, debated our
opponents and had been given extensive
Daily coverage.
In addition to these undemocratic
attempts aimed at hindering our election
bid, the ASSU is now attempting to steal
our election victory from us.
"A Clean Slate" did not win the past
election and "Blank Slate" does not con
cede. In fact, we demand a recount.
According to our calculations, based
on the fact that the 9,814 students who
did not vote in last week's election did

not vote for a COP and therefore voted
for us, we received 10,249 votes —
while "A Clean Slate" received 3,000.
We hereby claim a landslide victory!
If our victory is not immediately
acknowledged, we will have no choice
but to rescind the ASSU Constitution
and impose martial law on campus.
However, we would be willing to relin
quish our post if "A Clean Slate" can
prove to the Stanford community that
they are more worthy of the position by
beating us in a game of naked Twister in
White Plaza at high noon on Friday,
April 23.
