# 'Blank Slate' is a sad, stupefying, slick stand of shabby subversives
## 
### 
I am writing to register my complete
and utter disgust with "Blank Slate."
These pathetic attention-seekers have
made a mockery of student government.
Their immature antics ranged from the
ludicrous to the disgraceful to the
obscene. I cannot believe that after four
years at Stanford these seniors are still
so sophomoric. Perhaps another DR
should be created â€” "Maturity and
Responsibility: Acting Your Age."
The reason why the actions of Blank
Slate irritate me so greatly is the way in
which they, to borrow a phrase from Ali
son Callicoatte's letter to The Daily, dis
guised themselves with "a cloak of legiti
macy." Throughout the election, the
members of Blank Slate used thinly
veiled and shabbily constructed political
arguments to further their own goal of

enjoying themselves at the expense of
the student body.
Perhaps they thought they were only
being funny. However, had their cam
paign been more cleverly orchestrated,
or had they been more charismatic, the
results could have been devastating to
the Stanford community. People such as
the members of Blank Slate can be an
extremely dangerous and subversive ele
ment in a democratic society. Fortunate
ly, their actions caused no harm, other
than to embarrass themselves.
