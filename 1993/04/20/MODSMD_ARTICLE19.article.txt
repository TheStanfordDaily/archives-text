# BGLAD should include speakers representing contrasting viewpoints
## 
### 
The events last week celebrating the
homosexual community at Stanford are
a true display of unity and purpose. It
is nice to know that organizations such

as BGLAD are able to hold their events
on this campus without violence and
outcry. There are many campuses in
this country where they would not be
able to do so. It is unfortunate that
they chose to use the week of events as
an opportunity to lobby and propagan
dize the issue of homosexuals in the
military.
The panel discussion held at Branner
last Wednesday night was advertised to
be just that, a panel discussion. Normal
ly, at least in my expectation, a panel
discussion should include members of
differing viewpoints. Unfortunately, the
panel on Wednesday included three very
similar people. All three were against
the ban, homosexual and at one time in
the military.
Perhaps if they wholeheartedly
believed their arguments were correct
and strong enough to uplift the ban,
they would have included pro-ban mem
bers on their panel. I invite an explana
tion.
