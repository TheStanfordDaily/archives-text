# More than just conjugating verbs
## Senior creates 'the perfect school' for learning Italian

elaborate verb conjugations.
But senior Francesca Mattiussi-Sea
man decided that there had to be a better
way for others to learn her native tongue.
In an effort to save some would-be Ital
ian speakers from this ordeal, she estab
lished an intensive, four-week summer
language program last year in her home
town of Grado, Italy.
"I wanted to create something for the
students that would be perfect — the per
fect setting, the perfect school, the perfect

"How is the weather today? It is nice,"
prompts an Italian professor.
"Com' 6 il tempo oggi? Fa bello,"
drones the class.
Most students who want to attend
Stanford's program in Florence have to
sit through three quarters worth of re
quired Italian classes, imprisoned in tiny
language lab cubicles endlessly repeating

everything," said Mattiussi-Seaman, a
comparative literature major who said she
has experienced her share of unsatisfying
foreign language courses during her life.
Grado, a tiny island off the northeast
coast of Italy, offers sandy beaches, muse
ums, Roman ruins and a 1,400-year-old
church; Venice and the Alps are less than
two hours away.
But the most important aspect of
Grado is that none of its inhabi
tants, other than Mattiussi-Sea
man herself, speak English, there
by forcing students to become pro
ficient in Italian quickly if they
want to speak with anyone other
than themselves.
Unlike most Italians, Mattiussi-
Seaman explained that the inhabi
tants of Grado rarely see American
tourists. On the day her students
arrived, the entire island came to
the church to catch a glimpse of
the novel visitors.
"We were the famous visiting
American tourists," laughed fifth
year senior Matt Kratter, a gradu
ate of the program. The isolation
of the island is an advantage for
those trying to learn the language
quickly, Kratter emphasized,
adding, "It really improved my
Italian, just being immersed."
MattiusBi-Seaman said she lim
its the program to four students
per session in order to maximize
their learning experience. She
explained that direct interaction
with natives is the best way for for
eigners to learn how to get by in
another country.
Each morning, students con
vene at Mattiussi-Seaman's house
where they memorize a poem.
Later, she sends them into town
with a real-world assignment such
as a trip to the grocery store, the
train station or a museum.
But not every assignment is
easy. Like all teachers, Mattiussi-
Seaman also believes in the impor
tance of grammar. Every after
noon, back at her house, she teach
es them the technical details that
underlie the conversations they
have around town.
Although she prides herself on
the fact that her program "doesn't
feel like a school," Mattiussi-Sea
man claims her students learn
about 300 words a day.
"There is no memorization,"
she explains. "It is all based on imi
tation." Within four weeks, her
students learn enough Italian to
successfully negotiate any basic
conversation.

However, misunderstandings
inevitably occur along the way.
Kratter, who participated in the
program with his father and
brother last summer, remembers
a trip to the local barber that
ended unhappily for his brother,
Mark.
"There was this language barri
er," Kratter said. "The barber gave
him what he thought was an
American-style haircut, but it
wasn't. We all laughed a lot."
Overall, Kratter describes the
program as demanding but worth
while. "It's very intense," he
explained. "You spend five, six,

seven hours a day doing grammar
exercises and memorizing poetry.
Luckily, it doesn't just take place
in the classroom."
If it's sunny, for instance, Mat
tiussi-Seaman said she often holds
class on the beach, and in the
evenings she takes her students to
spots where they can absorb the local
culture and entertainment, such as
outdoor cafes, concerts and plays.
Designing and running a lan
guage program single-handedly
has been exhausting but very
rewarding, Mattiussi-Seaman
said. "It has been an incredible
experience," she claimed.
