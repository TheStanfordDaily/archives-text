## Batters seek return to winning ways in San Jose 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Things sure were different last
week.
Just eight dayB ago the Car
dinal was coming off a weekend
series in which it took two-of
three from conference-leading
USC and hosting San Jose
State last Monday with post
season play a not-so-far-fetched
goal.
The Spartans blasted Stan
ford, 11-3, in a game classified by
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess as
"one of our definite low points all
season."
One week later, the tables are
turned. Stanford (19-18) was
swept in three games by UCLA
over the weekend and is slowly
moving out of the NCAA picture.
The Spartan squad which they
face tonight, however, harbors
legitimate postseason aspirations.

'We've got to get to
the point where we
win five or six
games in a row in
league. We really
haven't been hot all
season.'
— Mark Marquess

San Jose State (27-14), third in
the respectable Big West Confer
ence, is right on the edge of the
NCAA bubble. Though the Spar
tans are unranked, they have
nonconference wins against both
Stanford and California under
their belt.
"It's impressive whenever you
can beat a [Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division] school," said
San Jose State coach Sam Piraro.
"The Cal and Stanford games
were both very big for our pro
gram."
This is not to say that the Car
dinal has been relegated to a
spoiler role. With 12 conference
games and 19 games overall
remaining on the schedule, Stan
ford still controls its own destiny.
Sort of. Now more than ever,
the squad needs to string together
some wins. "We've got to get to
the point where we win five or six
games in a row in league," Mar
quess said. "We really haven't
been hot all season."
Fifth in the Six-Pac with a
tepid .284 average and last in
home runs with 24, the Cardinal
needs increased offensive produc
tion in a hurry.
A pair of freshmen, Brian Dal
limore and A.J. Hinch, hold the
keys to any improvement. Dal
limore, a third baseman, hit .421
last week and smacked his first
ever home run on Saturday. The
righthander has seen his batting
average jump almost 100 points
to .325 since becoming the leadoff

hitter three weeks ago.
Hinch, second on the team
with a .328 average, collected four
hits last weekend and leads the
team with 26 hits in conference
play.

They face a stingy Spartan
pitching staff that has amassed a
1.83 earned-run average over its
last six games. Likely starter
Mike Rausch allowed only three
hits against Stanford last week in

five innings of work.
Stanford's own pitching situa
tion is, to say the least, unclear.
Beyond top starters Willie Adams
and Andrew Lorraine, several
young and inexperienced hurlers

continue to vie for the third and
fourth starting pitching slots.
"They're young, but they're
well-coached," Piraro said of the
Cardinal. "They're not going to
get anything but better."


Al Green — Daily file
Jed Hansen awaits a relay from the outfield. Following a weekend sweep at the hands of UCLA and a home loss to the Spartans last week,
Hansen and the Cardinal want to exact revenge on San Jose State on the road tonight. *
