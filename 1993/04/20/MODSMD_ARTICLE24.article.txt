# Lacrosse can't measure up in tourney
## Lose five games to superior competition, prepare for Nor Cal Final Four qualifier 
### Kyle Utsumi 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
dropped five matches on the muddy, rain
soaked Stanford intramural fields this week
end, as they participated in the Western
States Women's Lacrosse Tournament.
The team gained valuable experience com
peting against the top-rated collegiate and
club teams from west of the Mississippi River.
The tournament, the largest in the western
United States, featured more than 400 women
representing 37 teams.
Competing in the tournament's top divi
sion, the Cardinal fell to the eventual champi
on Seattle Club and runner-up Colorado. The
squad was also narrowly defeated by UC-Santa
Barbara and twice by the South Bay Club.
"The level of play at Western States is
much higher than we normally see in Califor
nia," said senior co-captain Jessica Barr.
"Playing lesser teams in league makes it
tougher to step up our game to a higher
level."
"The women on the club teams have years

of experience playing lacrosse, many at Divi
sion I schools on the East Coast," said co-cap
tain Robyn Norris, also a senior. "Some of
them are like the Dream Team of lacrosse."
But despite the tough losses, coach Kay
Cowperthwait was encouraged by the team's
play and mental preparation.
"Knowing the competition would be
extremely tough, we wanted to concentrate on
playing our game," Cowperthwait said. "We
wanted to do things we had worked on in prac
tice, and I think we did those things well."
According to Norris, the team has been
working on improving its patience and effi
ciency on offense.
"We were using each other well, setting up
the offense, and running our plays, especially
within the eight-meter," Norris said.
"We passed the ball well and had success
with short passes," Barr added.
"The team showed a lot of hustle, but our
shooting could be improved before next week
end."
Those improvements will be made in prepa
ration for the Northern California Women's

Lacrosse League's Final Four Qualification
Tournament, to be held either at Stanford or
St. Mary's this weekend. The Cardinal is cur
rently 6-2 in league play, and will be fighting
for the right to go to the state Final Four the
following week at UC-San Diego.
"UC-Davis will receive an automatic bid to
the Final Four for finishing first in league
play of the Nor Cal Division," Cowperthwait
said, "And we will be playing for Northern
California's second bid. We are now on a two
week plan focusing on winning the qualifying
tournament, and continuing on to the Final
Four.
"We need to keep up our intensity level,"
she continued. "At this point, we are well
conditioned and mentally prepared. Now it
comes down to doing the little things correct
ly."
While looking for good fundamental play
and team execution, Cowperthwait and co
coach Cecilia Paglia will also look for continu
ing excellent play from Barr and junior Jen
nifer Watts on the offensive attack, and Nor
ris at the defensive end of the field.
