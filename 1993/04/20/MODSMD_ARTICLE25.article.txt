# Athletes of the Week

### 
The Daily's Athletes of the Week — Jair
Lynch and Amy Chiminello — reflect an
ability to recover from conditions that would
otherwise hamper optimum sporting perfor
mance. Injuries to the Cardinal men's gym
nastics and women's tennis teams couldn't
keep Lynch from leading the former to a
national championship, or Chiminello from
keeping the latter on track to regain the

NCAA crown.
Lynch, a senior from Washington, D.C.,
had felt pressure before last weekend's
NCAA Championship meet in Albuquerque,
N.M. After all, the senior co-captain had led
the Cardinal to its first-ever national title in
1992, and had followed that up with a sixth
place showing on the parallel bars at the
Barcelona Olympics, where he was the
youngest member of the U.S. National
Team.
But perhaps Lynch's greatest challenge as
a gymnast came in last week's finals. Faced
with the knowledge that junior co-captain
Mark Booth's injury would not heal in time
for the meet, Lynch punctuated his colle
giate career with a ninth-place finish in the
individual all-around competition.
Tallying 9.40 and above in five of six dis
ciplines under a more stringent new scoring
system, Lynch made the difference as Stan
ford downed Nebraska and Ohio State 276.5-
275.5-274.05 on Saturday to remain the best
in the nation for a second consecutive year.

Chiminello, a sophomore from Melrose,
Mass., recovered from an ailment of her own
to lead the Cardinal to a sweep of USC and
UCLA in Los Angeles last weekend.
In a successful return from a bout with
the flu, Chiminello swept all three of her
matches as top-ranked Stanford wound up
its regular season at 22-3 and in first place in
the Pacific 10 Southern Division. On Friday,

she downed the Trojans' Carla Quaresma 6-
4, 6-4 at No. 5 singles and helped Heather
Willens seal a win at No. 2 doubles. On Sat
urday, Chiminello had a tougher time with
the Bruins' Jane Chi, but still managed a 7-
6, 6-2 straight-set victoiy.
Chiminello and the rest of the women's
netters will travel to Ojai, Calif., for Pac-10
individual finals this Thursday.
