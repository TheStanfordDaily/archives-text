# Boaters blown away in blustery Berkeley
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The idea of facing the UC-
Berkeley crew teams in a dual
meet is frightening enough just
by itself. Throw into that equa
tion 30 mph headwinds and
steady rain and you get a miser
able weekend for the Cardinal
men's and women's crew
teams.
Going into the race,
women's coach Wendy Davis
said her team had little hope of
beating Cal. The Cardinal
women's varsity finished with a
time of 10:05.51, almost a full
minute behind Cal's 9:09.51
finish. The junior varsity fin
ished 30 seconds behind Cal
with a time of 10:02.64 and the
novice boat finished at 9:34.26,
14 seconds behind Cal.
"The conditions were atro
cious," Davis said. "On top of
the terrible weather, we lost
Cara Larson and Kristin Hub
bard before the race, and Laris
sa Cochron wrenched her back
in the first minute of the race.
We normally have times
around 6:50 or 7 minutes, but
10 minutes? The conditions
were ridiculous."
Larson, who injured her
back last week, will be re-evalu
ated after a two-day rest. Hub
bard, suffering from severe flu
symptoms, is expected to be
healthy this week. Davis was
unsure of Cochron's injury or
when she will be ready to prac
tice again.
Despite the disappointing
showing, Davis remained opti
mistic about the rest of the sea
son.
"This race was a lot like
1988, when we raced Cal in the
same conditions and our varsi
ty was slaughtered," she said.
"We came back the next year
and finished third in the
nation."
Davis was also quick to
praise the advances Cal's team
has made this year. Benefitting
from a $65,000 budget increase
and a move into the plush
men's boathouse, the Cal
women have everything it takes
to give Washington and Prince
ton a run for the national
championship.

"They've been given every
thing they need and they're
making the most of it," Davis
said.
The men's crew team had
similar difficulties with the
conditions. The men's varsity
boat lost to Cal by 25 seconds,
finishing with a time of 8:02.72.
The junior varsity, finishing at
8:22.87, lost by a similar mar
gin. The novice crew trimmed
the margin, losing by only 11
seconds with a time of 7:41.69.
"These times don't really
show anything," senior Tom
Grace said. "The conditions
worsened as the day went on,
and by the time the varsity had
to race there were whitecaps
everywhere.
"Cal just responded better
than we did to the tough condi
tions," he continued. "These
results don't really reflect
either crews' speeds. We can't
learn much from these race
times."
He said that even after three
years of rowing experience on
both coasts, he had never seen
conditions this bad. According
to Grace, the wind and current
transformed the race into a
contest of sheer muscle as the
water seemed very heavy.
"We're a pretty strong team,
but not in the sense that we can
lift a lot of weight," he said.
The junior varsity and varsity
squads stayed close to Cal for the
first 750 meters of the 2,000-
meter race, but the final margin
reflected more of Stanford's
deterioration over the last half of
the race rather than Cal pulling
away, according to Grace.
"It's very difficult mentally
in these sorts of conditions,"
Grace said. "After about 750
(meters), we just got tired and
couldn't make it up.
"How much of a setback this
race is depends on the people,"
he continued. "We can take the
disappointment from this week
and use it to our advantage. If
Washington looks at the results
from this race and says Stan
ford has really dropped off this
year, they'll be mistaken. No
one is expecting much from us,
so Washington and Cal better
be looking over their shoulders
come championships."
