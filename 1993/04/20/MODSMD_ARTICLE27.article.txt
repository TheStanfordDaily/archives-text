# Home not so sweet for golfers

The 1993 Cupertino Inn U.S.
Intercollegiate at Stanford ended
yesterday with Oregon winning
its second tournament in two
weeks. Cardinal sophomore Steve
Burdick finished third in individ
ual standings, leading the best
team effort the Cardinal has
shown all season.
The Stanford Golf Course,
however, did not provide much
home-field advantage for the Car
dinal, which finished 11th in the
54-hole tournament despite a
strong showing in the last two
rounds.
The individual tournament
ended in a tie between the top two
finishers, Kevin La Mair from
Oregon State and Cam Martin
from Oregon, who both shot a
two-under-par 211 for the tour
nament. La Mair took the cham
pionship in a sudden death play
off which capped an exciting day
of golf.
In team competition, Califor

nia took second, finishing eight
shots behind Oregon's 862 with a
four-man score of 870 for the
tournament. "It's Cal's best team
since I've been here," Cardinal
coach Wally Goodwin said.
San Jose State, Washington
and USC finished third, fourth
and fifth, respectively, with
scores of 872, 873 and 874. Wash
ington led the tournament after
two rounds of play, but Oregon,
Cal and San Jose State had great
final rounds to push them into
the top three spots.
Sophomore Steve Burdick
tied for third in the individual
standings with San Jose State's
Steve Woods at a one-under 212.
"I came up one shot too short,"
Burdick said of narrowly miss
ing the sudden-death playoff.
"All in all, though, it was a good
tournament. Anytime you finish
in the top-10 you have to be
happy."
Goodwin, who took a moment
to talk quietly to his best golfer
after the final round, said, "He
just played a great, consistent

tournament. I'm really proud of
him."
Stanford's shot total of 889
marked a respectable finish for
the Cardinal, which played two of
its best rounds of the season Sun
day and yesterday. The team fin
ished Sunday's round with a
score of 293, its lowest of the sea
son, and then followed that with a
294 yesterday in the final round
of the tournament. "I am really
pleased," Goodwin said of Sun
day's round. "(Freshman) Pete
Ligotti shot a 77 that round and it
improved our team score
immensely."
The tournament did have some
rough spots, however. Rain
dampened the U.S. Intercolle
giate, which was postponed for
three hours on Saturday. The
Cardinal shot 302 as a team that
round, which, ironically, was Bur
dick's best.
The tournament was the Car
dinal's last competition before the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, which will take place
next week in Santa Barbara.
