# Goodbye, Joe . . .
## Montana rejects 49ers' offer, will play for Kansas City 
### 
SANTA CLARA (AP) - Just about
the time the San Francisco 49ers decided
to give Joe Montana his job back, he
decided he no longer wanted it.
Montana made clear yesterday that
the quarterbacking job he wants is in
Kansas City. He rejected an offer by the
49ers to reinstate him as the starter over
Steve Young, last season's passing leader
and league MVP.
Carmen Policy, the 49ers' president,
said he hoped to resolve Montana's sta
tus within the next 48 hours despite a
breakdown Monday in trade negotia
tions with the Chiefs.
The problem is over the compensa
tion the Chiefs would pay the 49ers for
Montana, a four-time Super Bowl win
ner in 10 years as San Francisco's
starter. He has a year left on his 49ers
contract.
Policy indicated the Chiefs hadn't
changed their earlier offer, but Kansas
City president and general manager Carl
Peterson disagreed, although he didn't
specify the change.
"I know what we gave, and we gave
an awful lot," Peterson said. "We did
have a lot of conversation (Monday) and,
frankly, I thought that what I put on the
table was more than fair. I improved the
offer of what I had before. I can say with
out equivocation that it's a very hand

some offer."
Montana, who lost his job to Young
during a two-year recovery from an
elbow injury, turned down the 49ers'
offer earlier Monday during a meeting
with Policy and coach George Seifert at
the quarterback's home.
Still, the coach said Montana techni
cally was the team's No. 1 quarterback,
with Young getting the job if he left.
Just a few days ago, it was the other
way around, and after the April 7 re
signing of Steve Bono as Young's nomi
nal backup, the 49ers deemed Montana
expendable and gave him permission to
shop around for another team.
Montana ended his two-week search
by embracing Kansas City, but the 49ers
blocked the move, complaining the
Chiefs hadn't bid enough. Then the Nin
ers clouded the picture further by offer
ing Montana his old starting job.
That tactic was seen by some as a
calculated effort to drive up Kansas
City's bid to bring it into line with one
from the Phoenix Cardinals, who pro
posed giving San Francisco a first-round
draft pick in return for Montana.
But Montana preferred to play for
the Chiefs, who reportedly offered their
first-round pick, but sought the 49ers'
second-round pick and another player in
addition to Montana.

"In an effort to accommodate Joe,
we had conversations with the Chiefs
today . . . but to no avail," Policy said.
"Those negotiations have broken off
again.
"We are now in a very delicate situa
tion in that we are exploring all, and I
underline all, of our alternatives.
Because of the very special relationship
with Joe, we will continue to attempt to
take his wishes into consideration. But
from this point in time, the underlying
purpose of whatever we do will be in the
best interest of the 49ers."
In recent weeks, Seifert had pub
licly backed Young as the starter before
team officials suddenly reversed field
this weekend following Montana's meet
ing with club owner Edward Deßartolo
Jr.
Seifert and Policy denied the 49ers'
hastily arranged proposal was manufac
tured to deflect public criticism. Backers
of Montana have deluged the club's
offices with faxes and phone calls in an
attempt to derail any trade.
"The offer that was made to Joe
Montana to be the starting quarterback
was a sincere, open, honest offer,"
Seifert saicf.
"When I said Steve Young was the
starting quarterback, obviously I didn't
expect Joe Montana to then want to go

on to another club," Seifert added. "As
this situation played out, I sensed there
was polarization with regard to players,
with regard to our organization, coach
ing staff, secretaries. There were a lot of
factors entering into this."
Nevertheless, the team's turnabout
seemed to undermine Seifert's credibili
ty, and left the 49ers in an awkward
position with Young and Bono no matter
how the affair played out.
"It's just like opening a can of
worms," 49ers receiver Jerry Rice told
the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.
Though a supporter of Montana,
Rice said he also felt for Young.
"He has to be wondering. He has to
be thinking something right now: 'I car
ried this team for two years and just look
what they're doing to me,' " Rice said.
"There has to be something in the back
of his mind."
Young, in the midst of law school
finals at Brigham Young University, was
unavailable for comment Monday.
In a statement released through
agent Peter Johnson, Montana said he
had no intention of forsaking the com
mitment he made to the Chiefs for a
return to the 49ers.
On Friday, Montana agreed in prin
ciple on a 3-year contract with Kansas
City, leaving the deal contingent on the

Chiefs and 49ers working out a trade.
The 49ers re-entered the picture
when Deßartolo, during a meeting Sat
urday with Montana, offered him his old
job. Seifert also called Montana, told him
he had made a mistake in naming Young
the undisputed starter and that he
would designate Montana as the club's
top quarterback heading into the 1993
training camp.
"I think it's important to note that I
never asked Mr. Deßartolo or anyone
else from the 49ers organization to be
named the starting quarterback," Mon
tana said in the statement.
"Earlier this year, I had hoped that I
would have the opportunity to compete
for the job this season. However, I was
told in January that Steve Young would
be the starter, and I accepted the 49ers'
position.
"Due to this decision, the 49ers
authorized me to work out an arrange
ment with another NFL team. Three
days prior to my decision to go with the
Kansas City Chiefs, once again the 49ers
stated publicly there would be no open
competition for the starting job.
Although Mr. Deßartolo and I spoke on
Saturday about finishing my career with
the 49ers, it is not going to be possible,
based on the commitment I made to the
Chiefs."
