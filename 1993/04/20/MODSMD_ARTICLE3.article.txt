# Two frats under fire for Rush infractions
## Kappa Sig and SAE accused of alcohol violations 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Two fraternities — Kappa Sigma and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon — have been accused
of violating University and fraternity Rush
policies by serving alcohol to minors at
Rush parties, Interfraternity Council Pres
ident Mike Champney said yesterday.
SAE Co-president Aaron Hendelman,
however, said the accusation against his
fraternity is false, and that the SAEs had
not offered alcohol at any of their Rush
events.
Kappa Sig President Kevin Efrusy said
the accusation against his fraternity is
being investigated, but he could not com
ment on the charge.
Official University investigations into
the accusations are likely to start within a
week. If the fraternities are found to have
violated alcohol rules, they could be as
sessed penalties ranging from community
service to social probation.
The alleged transgressions violate two
different sets of rules. One is a Rush code
agreed upon by fraternities that stated
Rush is to be dry this year — that no alco
hol is to be served at Rush events. The
other is a University policy that bans serv
ing alcohol to minors.
Because of this, the two fraternities
could face separate investigations and sets

of sanctions, one from their fellow fraterni
ties and the other — for University policy
violations — from the Greek Judicial
Board.
In addition to the official charges
against Kappa Sig and SAE, Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn said there
"have been other groups that have had
questions raised" about possible Rush vio
lations, but said no formal complaints have
been made about other groups.
According to Champney, a meeting of
fraternity presidents and Rush chairs was
held yesterday "to let everybody know
what was going on and that it is unaccept
able." Champney said that, to date, the two
complaints are the only formal complaints
of Rush violations this year.
Hendelman, however, said that nothing
was going on at SAE parties.
"We did nothing," he said. "There was
never any alcohol served to any minors or
rushees at an SAE Rush event."
Hendelman said he is currently drafting
a response to the accusations stating his
fraternity's position and is confident that
the SAEs will be found innocent. The fra
ternity is "still very optimistic about Rush"
despite the accusations, he said.
