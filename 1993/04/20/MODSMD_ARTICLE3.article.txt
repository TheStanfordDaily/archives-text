# Two frats under fire for Rush infractions
## Kappa Sig and SAE accused of alcohol violations 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Two fraternities — Kappa Sigma and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon — have been accused
of violating University and fraternity Rush
policies by serving alcohol to minors at
Rush parties, Interfraternity Council Pres
ident Mike Champney said yesterday.
SAE Co-president Aaron Hendelman,
however, said the accusation against his
fraternity is false, and that the SAEs had
not offered alcohol at any of their Rush
events.
Kappa Sig President Kevin Efrusy said
the accusation against his fraternity is
being investigated, but he could not com
ment on the charge.
Official University investigations into
the accusations are likely to start within a
week. If the fraternities are found to have
violated alcohol rules, they could be as
sessed penalties ranging from community
service to social probation.
The alleged transgressions violate two
different sets of rules. One is a Rush code
agreed upon by fraternities that stated
Rush is to be dry this year — that no alco
hol is to be served at Rush events. The
other is a University policy that bans serv
ing alcohol to minors.
Because of this, the two fraternities
could face separate investigations and sets

of sanctions, one from their fellow fraterni
ties and the other — for University policy
violations — from the Greek Judicial
Board.
In addition to the official charges
against Kappa Sig and SAE, Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn said there
"have been other groups that have had
questions raised" about possible Rush vio
lations, but said no formal complaints have
been made about other groups.
According to Champney, a meeting of
fraternity presidents and Rush chairs was
held yesterday "to let everybody know
what was going on and that it is unaccept
able." Champney said that, to date, the two
complaints are the only formal complaints
of Rush violations this year.
Hendelman, however, said that nothing
was going on at SAE parties.
"We did nothing," he said. "There was
never any alcohol served to any minors or
rushees at an SAE Rush event."
Hendelman said he is currently drafting
a response to the accusations stating his
fraternity's position and is confident that
the SAEs will be found innocent. The fra
ternity is "still very optimistic about Rush"
despite the accusations, he said.
Both Tresidder Asst. Director Nanci
Howe, the staff member on the Greek Judi-
cial Board, and Dunn said the
accusations may be due to a
change in Rush rules making the
event totally dry this year. Last
year official Rush events were
only scheduled for Mondays
through Thursdays and were dry.
Fraternity events on weekends
during the Rush period could
serve alcohol, however.
"We haven't quite made the
paradigm shift realizing that you
can't buy rushees with alcohol,"
Dunn said.
Dunn added, however, that
"there are groups playing by the
rules . . . and those men are to be
commended."
Howe said the idea of having a
dry Rush this year was to stave
off violations of University policy,
which had occurred in past rush
es.
Dunn said last year's partly
dry Rush still had "many prob
lems," so the University decided
Rush should be completely dry
this year. She added that almost
all universities nationwide have
dry rushes.
Howe said she has only
received verbal complaints of the
violations, but expects to receive
written complaints soon. The

board investigates violations of
the University policy.
After written complaints are
received, Howe said the board
would have to investigate of the
allegations and then suggest a
punishment to Dean of Students
Michael Jackson, who makes a
final decision on what punish
ment to mandate. Only Jackson's
final decision will be made public;
the rest of the process is private.
Howe said any suggested pun
ishments will likely be sent to
Jackson in about three weeks.
Punishments from the Universi
ty could include fines, community
service, social probation (a ban on
parties) and alcohol probation (a
ban on serving alcohol), she
added.
Any violations of fraternity
policy would likely be ruled on by
the presidents of all campus fra
ternities, said Dunn. According to
her, a formal complaint has been
made about Kappa Sig, and she
expects a formal complaint about
SAE today.
Dunn said the IFC investiga
tion will likely begin after Rush
ends, and may wait to see the
outcome of the Greek Judicial
Board's investigation before
reaching a decision. Dunn said
penalties for violating Rush pol
icy could include fines, public
service and educational pro
grams.
