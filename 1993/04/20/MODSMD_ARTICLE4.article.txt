# Publications seek funds to upgrade equipment
## ASSU Senate to consider proposal tonight 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Responding to student publications'
complaints of broken and antiquated
equipment, the Publications Board will ask
the ASSU Senate tonight for a funding re
allocation to purchase new computers and
other accessories.
The proposal would call for spending
$14,880 of the board's $39,740 reserve
fund on two new computers, two monitors
and other equipment.
"My own personal goal is to see a wealth
of publications at Stanford," said senior
Tammy Edwards who has run the board
since January. "From what I've seen, one
of the greatest problems that we face is a
lack of resources."
Broken equipment in the Storke Stu
dent Publications Building has forced sev
eral publications — including the Stanford

Review, the Release and New Speak — to
use personal computer equipment or send
their projects to professional typesetters.
"I would definitely say that there is a
need for improvements," said Cheo Coker,
editor of Release.
"Because of the high costs involved
[with using outdated equipment], not only
did the Release go bankrupt, but
New Speak, the G-Spot and Dialtone aren't
using the equipment anymore," said Stan
ford Review managing editor Steve Rus
sell.
Recognizing this difficulty with the
technical aspects of publications, Edwards
and Russell have drafted the proposal to re
place their outdated computer system.
"Really, the bill is there to let publica
tions publish," said Russell. "Its main goal
is to create an environment that is better
for new publications."
"What we've put together is
much more comprehensive than
earlier proposals," added
Edwards. In the past the board
has considered making requests
for equipment on a case-by-case
basis.
"It makes more sense to deal
with these problems all at once,"
she said.
Coker echoed this sentiment,
saying that "though the initial
investment is hefty, in the end, it

will pay off."
According to the proposal, the
new equipment would decrease
student groups' publishing costs.
In addition, it would allow more
groups the opportunity to publish.
However, it is possible that the
senate will not approve the trans
fer of funds out of the board's
reserve account.
"This bill is taking a huge sum
of money out of the ASSU fund,"
said Edwards. A large portion of
the ASSU's revenue comes from
interest accrued on the fund.
"This creates an incentive for
the senate not to approve the
request," said Russell.
