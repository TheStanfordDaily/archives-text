# Ex-porn star speaks out against abuse of women
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Linda Marchiano is now the
mother of two teenagers, a PTA
parent who prides herself on
being personable and baking cof
fee cakes for her neighbors.
Around the world, however,
she is remembered as "Linda
Lovelace," star of the hit pornog
raphy film "Deep Throat."
"When people watch 'Deep
Throat,' they're watching me be
raped," Marchiano explained in
Cubberley Auditorium last night.
More than 200 people gathered to
hear her speak at the opening
event of Rape Awareness Week,
organized by Stanford's Rape Ed
ucation Project.
In a speech that was as much a
personal history as an attack on
the pornography industry,
Marchiano described the horrors
of the abuse she suffered at the
hands of her former companion,
Charles Trainer, the man who she
says forced her into a lifestyle of
prostitution and pornography.
"I had a warm and loving up
bringing," Marchiano said of her
childhood in a calm suburb of
Yonkers, N.Y. The daughter of a

policeman who went to Catholic
school and lived under the shelter
of "overprotective" parents,
Marchiano described a less-than
sordid upbringing with no obvious
problems.
After a near-fatal car accident
in 1971, however, things took a
turn for the worse for her. Before
the accident, Marchiano had
planned to buy a boutique and a
house as a successful business
woman. Afterward, however, she
found herself recuperating in her
parents' house in Florida.
She was introduced to Trainer,
whom she eventually moved in
with after the accident, swayed
somewhat by the need to leave her
overprotective parents.
Unfortunately, after she left to
live with Trainer, who seemed to
be "an all-American type of guy,"
his true character became evi
dent, that of a perverse man "in
capable of any sexual act without
some kind of degradation and the
humiliation of some human
being."
In a two-and-a-half-year or
deal, Marchiano said she was
made into a "prisoner," a victim of
sexual, physical and emotional
abuse.
"I'm sure Mr. Trainer would
say he had taken a naive chick
who was embarrassed to take
her clothes off in front of a man,
and had turned her into a
freak," Marchiano said.
Marchiano described a contin
uous stream of traumatic events
in which Trainer allegedly beat
her, threatening to shoot her
and members of her family. She
said she was forced to participate
in orgies and other sexual activi
ties, dealing with individuals she
described as "inadequate busi
nessmen." Marchiano recalled
how these men complained to
Trainer, saying she was not up
to par as a prostitute and "really
a drag. [Shel had tears in [her)

eyes. That took the fun out of
it."
Eventually, she said, Trainer
initiated Marchiano into the
pornographic-film industry,
where she gained international
fame as the star of "Deep
Throat."
"I'd never seen an eight-mil
limeter film before, and the first
one I see is me," Marchiano
winced. "That's my luck, that it
('Deep Throat') became world
known ... It was the chic thing
to do, to go see that movie."
Marchiano went on to
describe beatings that followed
each day's filming on the set of
the movie, which eventually
grossed over $600 million, decry
ing the final product. "Everyone
talks about the smile on my face,
but nobody ever asks about the
bruises on my body."
After her alleged victimiza
tion by Trainer, Marchiano said
she was still not helped by others

on the set, remembering the
only comments of the film direc
tor being, "'How are we gonna
try and hide the bruises? The
sweet and innocent look is
ruined!"'
After three failed attempts,
Marchiano eventually escaped
and went into hiding, attempt
ing to heal on her own after her
pleas for help were ignored by
the police.
A few years later, Marchi
ano's story was documented in a
biography titled "Ordeal." By
that time, she had married and
started a family and she soon
went on the speaking circuit, lec
turing on the connection
between sexual violence and
pornography.
"Pornography destroys the
family unit, and the family is the
foundation of society," she said.
"If you're not part of the solu
tion, you're part of the prob
lem. ... I don't think [the anti

pornography effort) should be a
national organization. I think it
should be a small group of peo
ple, two or three who get togeth
er and say 'Hey, we're not gonna
let this happen anymore.' "
Living in Colorado, Marchi
ano has attempted to deal with
her past, explaining the years
she spent living with Trainer to
her children for their own
understanding.
Marchiano extolled the
virtues of an "honest and open"
education for children to help
avoid the horrors she suffered,
and also told the story of the fail
ure of civil-rights legislation
regarding pornography.
She refuted the need for
pornography, emphasizing its
violent nature and her personal
example of its potential for
destruction.
"When porno knocks, it
doesn't knock gently, it knocks
the door down."
