Linda Marchiano is now the
mother of two teenagers, a PTA
parent who prides herself on
being personable and baking cof
fee cakes for her neighbors.
Around the world, however,
she is remembered as "Linda

in 1971, however, things took a
turn for the worse for her. Before
the accident, Marchiano had
planned to buy a boutique and a
house as a successful business
woman. Afterward, however, she
found herself recuperating in her
parents' house in Florida.
She was introduced to Trainer,
whom she eventually moved in
with after the accident, swayed
somewhat by the need to leave her
overprotective parents.
Unfortunately, after she left to
live with Trainer, who seemed to
be "an all-American type of guy,"
his true character became evi
dent, that of a perverse man "in
capable of any sexual act without
some kind of degradation and the
humiliation of some human
being."
In a two-and-a-half-year or
deal, Marchiano said she was
made into a "prisoner," a victim of
