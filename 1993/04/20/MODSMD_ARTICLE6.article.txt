# Reges returns
## Former CS lecturer still pushing drug legalization 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
What a long, strange trip it's been.
Nearly two years after his dismissal for car
rying drugs on campus in protest of U.S. drug
policy, computer science senior lecturer turned
media darling turned Libertarian Party nation
al director Stuart Reges spoke to a Branner au
dience of 50 last night.
The experienced drug user, who champions
drug legalization at almost every opportunity,
acknowledged that he approaches that issue
both idealistically — through the Libertarian
eye of government non-intervention — and
pragmatically.
He argued that the government harms inner
cities by outlawing drugs, thereby creating a vi
olent high-profit black market that would not
exist if drugs were legal. While legalization
would definitely increase drug use, the benefit
of crime reduction would outweigh that cost, he
said.
He compared today's persecution of pro
drug opinions to the 1950s McCarthy era. "My
own feeling isn't that people were stupid in the
'20s and '50s and smart now. That's a vain way
of looking at things," he said. "There must be
something about America that there are these

areas of vast ignorance held by
people. There is a conspiracy of
silence on the drug issue."
With a smile, he added, "When
people make movies of this era,
they'll look at it ... with the atti
tude that people who challenged
the war on drugs were cool and
intelligent, while the others were
evil or well-meaning but igno
rant."
Reges belittled the myth that
some people cannot make compe
tent decisions about drugs. "If you
were to poll Americans, almost all
would say weak and ignorant peo
ple exist," he said. "If you ask if
they are one of these weak people,
they'd say no."
But the award-winning
instructor said he is not opposed
to an age restriction on drug use.
"I don't know if when I was 16 I

could have handled the drugs I
used (at age 22). You need a strong
sense of who you are before you
start experimenting."
The government has been
spreading lies about drugs, Reges
said, noting that the Drug
Enforcement Agency ignored its
own judge who called marijuana
"one of the most benign sub
stances known to man."
However, he predicted that the
government will definitely legalize
marijuana and MDMA (Ecstasy)
in the near future.
Although his widely publicized
protest and subsequent dismissal
virtually destroyed his future in
academics, he found success down
another path.
Starting as a low-level employ
ee at the Libertarian headquarters
in Washington, D.C. last year,
Reges was courted by the party in
January when it searched for a
new national director with admin
istrative experience. Reges, who

not only taught but served as as
assistant chair for education in
the computer science department,
fit their bill.
As a Libertarian, Reges abhors
mandatory seat belt and helmet
laws. He also likes to live a little on
the edge.
"People spend so much time
making sure something awful
doesn't happen that they never
live," he said. "The bad things
that have happened to me have
shaped my character much more
than anything else."
He called his episodes of drug
use some of his most cherished
experiences, and noted that he
wrote his successful computer
textbook, "Building Pascal Pro
grams," under the focusing influ
ence of crystal.
"It was as if I could see every
thing in my mind at once, every
sentence," he said. "People
assume drugs make you a bab
bling idiot."
