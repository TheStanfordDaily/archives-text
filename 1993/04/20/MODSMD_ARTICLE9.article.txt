Stanford ready for World Cup
The President and Vice President of Federa
tion Internationale de Football Association, soc
cer's international governing body, visited Stan
ford stadium yesterday as part of an inspection
tour to make sure the arena will be ready for what
they deemed "the world's most prestigious single
sporting event." Along with Alan Rothenberg, the
president of World Cup USA 1994, the dignitaries
expressed support for the future of American soc
cer and the choice of Stanford as host for several
World Cup games.
Although association President Joan Have
lange was originally among a group of critics who
questioned the choice of the United States as host
of the 1994 World Cup, he said now he is pleased
the United States is hosting the games. He
expressed confidence that certain problems with
the various stadiums will be "ironed out."
Concerning Stanford Stadium in particular,
Rothenberg said that permanent improvements
such as replacing wooden seats, improving the
press box and leveling the playing field will be
completed by December when a preliminary game
will take place between the United States and
Germany. The $4 million worth of changes will be

paid for by the association, the U.S. Soccer Feder
ation and Stanford. Rothenberg said the Univer
sity should earn back its portion of the costs
through revenues generated by World Cup events.

Hammer killer hired
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The man who killed
a popular Stanford math professor with a ham
mer in 1978 has been hired by the city's Munici
pal Railway, a Muni spokesman said yesterday.
Theodore Streleski, freed from prison in 1985
after serving seven years, will be an assistant elec
tronics technician and will repair fareboxes, said
Muni spokesman Alan Siegel. His start date in the
$45,800-a-year post was not yet known, Siegel said.
The former Stanford graduate student was the
leading candidate for the civil service post. The
city was aware of his background and allowed him
to take the civil service exam.
Streleski killed Prof. Karel DeLeeuw in his
Stanford office by smashing his head with a two
pound hammer. Streleski had spent 19 years at
Stanford pursing a doctoral degree, and he later
called the killing a protest over treatment of grad
uate students at Stanford.
