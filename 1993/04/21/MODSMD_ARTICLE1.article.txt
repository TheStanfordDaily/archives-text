# Granting amnesty
## Scores of stolen signs surrendered during grace period 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Taking advantage of an
amnesty period that protected
them from arrest, students pos
sessing stolen street signs have
turned in dozens of the coveted ar
tifacts to Facilities officials in the
last three weeks.
The idea for the amnesty peri
od "came from students who had
old signs in their houses and were
nervous about them" after police
raided the Phi Delta Theta house
last month to confiscate stolen
street signs, according to Diana
Conklin, associate director of Res
idential Education. The grace pe
riod, which began March 31 and
ended Friday, was arranged joint
ly by University housing officials
and the Stanford Police.
Facilities supervisor Clark Vitt
said between 20 and 30 signs were
turned in at Rinconada after the
Rinc-A-Delt party April 3. Anoth
er facilities supervisor reported
seeing several signs "strategically
abandoned" in the Stern Hall
parking lot.
The collected signs were taken
to Facilities' paint, sign and glass
center, where they will be sorted
and probably reused by the Uni
versity, according to Vitt. He said
many of the signs were "No Park
ing" and "Handicapped Parking"
signs.
Three other facilities supervi
sors were not available for com
ment, and it is unclear how many
signs in total were turned in.
Junior Thomas Arnold, a resi
dent assistant at the Kappa Sigma
house, said his fraternity turned
in all the signs from their common
rooms. "We didn't even think
about what the punishment
would be if we didn't" turn in the
signs, said Arnold. "We just want
ed to follow what the University
said. Besides, our signs just
weren't that important to us."
Last month, Stanford Police
raided the Phi Delt house and con
fiscated 49 signs. Sgt. Del Bandy
said the case was turned over to
the Santa Clara County district
attorney but was not prosecuted
because of difficulty in determin
ing who actually was responsible
for the signs.
When responsibility for the
signs is clear, however, students
can be charged with possession of
stolen property or misappropria
tion of found property. If the value
of the signs exceeds $400, it is con
sidered grand theft.
Conklin said the grace period
was "not intended as a change of
policy or practice in any way."
"I don't want students to be
paranoid that people are going to
go into their rooms and search
them. It won't happen," she said.
While many students took ad
vantage of the opportunity and
ridded themselves of possible lia
bility, others have coolly disre
garded the risk and left their
street signs hanging on the wall.
One sophomore, who did not
wish to implicate himself, said he
and his roommates "considered
taking our sign down or covering
it up, but we didn't think they
were really going to check."
"It sounds to me like the

police don't really want to do
anything about it. It's just that
somebody actually called them
about it for the Phi Delt house,"
he added.
Facilities officials who enter stu
dents' rooms for routine mainte
nance can report stolen signs.
Police officers may go into stu
dents' rooms if stolen property is
reported, or if they have cause to
believe that a crime is being com
mitted.
"If we have a case," said
Bandy, "we will prosecute and
possibly get a conviction. We've
done it in the past."

Though the grace period has
ended, University and police are
still encouraging students to
return stolen signs.
Students can still turn in signs,
give them to others to turn in, or
give them to their Facilities direc
tor anonymously and trust that
they won't be reported, Conklin
said. They can also wait until
there is no one at the Facilities
office and slide them in under the
door, she said.
Bandy suggested that students
turn in the street signs by report
ing them as found property and
having the police pick them up.
