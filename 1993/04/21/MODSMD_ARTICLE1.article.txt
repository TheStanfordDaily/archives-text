# Granting amnesty
## Scores of stolen signs surrendered during grace period 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Taking advantage of an
amnesty period that protected
them from arrest, students pos
sessing stolen street signs have
turned in dozens of the coveted ar
tifacts to Facilities officials in the
last three weeks.
The idea for the amnesty peri
od "came from students who had
old signs in their houses and were
nervous about them" after police
raided the Phi Delta Theta house
last month to confiscate stolen
street signs, according to Diana
Conklin, associate director of Res
idential Education. The grace pe
riod, which began March 31 and
ended Friday, was arranged joint
ly by University housing officials
and the Stanford Police.
Facilities supervisor Clark Vitt
said between 20 and 30 signs were
turned in at Rinconada after the
Rinc-A-Delt party April 3. Anoth
er facilities supervisor reported
seeing several signs "strategically
abandoned" in the Stern Hall
parking lot.
The collected signs were taken
to Facilities' paint, sign and glass
center, where they will be sorted
and probably reused by the Uni
versity, according to Vitt. He said
many of the signs were "No Park
ing" and "Handicapped Parking"
signs.
Three other facilities supervi
sors were not available for com
ment, and it is unclear how many
signs in total were turned in.
Junior Thomas Arnold, a resi
dent assistant at the Kappa Sigma
house, said his fraternity turned
in all the signs from their common
rooms. "We didn't even think
about what the punishment
would be if we didn't" turn in the
signs, said Arnold. "We just want
ed to follow what the University
said. Besides, our signs just
weren't that important to us."
Last month, Stanford Police
raided the Phi Delt house and con
fiscated 49 signs. Sgt. Del Bandy
said the case was turned over to
the Santa Clara County district
attorney but was not prosecuted
because of difficulty in determin
ing who actually was responsible
for the signs.
When responsibility for the
signs is clear, however, students
can be charged with possession of
stolen property or misappropria
tion of found property. If the value
of the signs exceeds $400, it is con
sidered grand theft.
Conklin said the grace period
was "not intended as a change of
policy or practice in any way."
"I don't want students to be
paranoid that people are going to
go into their rooms and search
them. It won't happen," she said.
While many students took ad
