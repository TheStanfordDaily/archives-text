Ex-Miami mayor sentenced
MIAMI (AP) — The former mayor of
Miami Beach was sentenced to nearly 3
1/2 years in prison on a single federal
corruption count yesterday. He still
faces trial on at least 30 additional
charges.
Alex Daoud's sentencing came a day
after U.S. District Judge James
Lawrence King rejected a plea bargain
that would have sent Daoud to prison for
five years on all the charges.
Daoud, 49, was convicted last year on
one count of taking a $10,000 bribe from
boxing promoter Willy Martinez.
