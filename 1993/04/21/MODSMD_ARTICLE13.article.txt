# FBI questioned about cult handling
## 
### 
WACO, Texas (AP) — Some dooms
day cultists may have been shot trying to
flee "Ranch Apocalypse" before others
started Monday's inferno that left scores
dead, investigators searching the still-smol
dering ruins said yesterday.
Whatever happened in the final hours
at the Branch Davidian compound Mon
day, federal agents — under intense
scrutiny for starting a tank-and-tear-gas
assault that apparently precipitated the
fire — placed responsibility for the car
nage solely with the group's leader, David
Koresh.
President Clinton echoed that senti
ment. "He killed those he controlled," Clin
ton said at the White House.
Koresh and 85 others, including 17 chil
dren under age 10, are believed to have died
in the fire that ended the cult's 51-day
standoff with federal agents; there were
nine survivors. Four remained hospitalized
yesterday, two in critical condition and two

in good condition.
Investigators began pulling bodies out of
the rubble yesterday, but were slowed
because "ammunition was still cooking and
exploding," said FBI agent Jeff Jamar. Offi
cials said it could take two weeks to gather
all the evidence.
Among developments yesterday:
• The Clinton adminstration's handling
of the case was sharply questioned by vic
tims' relatives and attorneys, politicians
and observers worldwide. Clinton defended
Attorney General Janet Reno, who
approved the FBI effort to use at least two
tanks to knock holes in the compound walls
and tear-gas the cult members out, but
said, "I signed off on this."
Clinton ordered federal agencies to
investigate events that led to the standoff*s
firey end. Congressional investigations also
were announced.
• Five cult members who survived the
blaze appeared in federal court, wearing

orange jail suits and shackled by the ankles.
One of them, Renos Avraam, told reporters
that an FBI tank spraying tear gas into the
compound had knocked over a lantern and
started the fire, and that the cult had "no
plan for suicide."
But the FBI said its snipers saw cultists
setting blazes and that a survivor told
investigators that lantern fluid had been
poured throughout the wooden complex.
Jaime Castillo, 24, was charged with
conspiracy to murder federal agents. Being
held as material witnesses were Avrram,
31; David Thibodeau, 24; Derek Lovelock,
37; and Graeme Craddock, 31. All five were
being held without bail.
• The FBI turned control of the com
pound over to Texas Rangers, the state's
elite crime-fighting force. The Rangers
began investigating shootouts at the begin
ning of the siege, during raids Feb. 28 by
federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents.
