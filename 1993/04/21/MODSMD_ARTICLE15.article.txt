Surpluses in student
group budgets should
be removed in future

According to most
accounts, the '90s are a
time of fiscal austerity.
Yet at the University and the
ASSU are undergoing massive cut
backs, careless accounting prac
tices and bloated budgets have
emerged within certain student
groups. In fairness to other stu
dent groups who have worked to
reduce their budgets, these groups
should work to get their financial
matters into shape.
Although uncommon in most
groups' budgets, the Asian Ameri
can Students Association has con
tinuously run up its reserves over
the past few years by allotting
large sums for budget surpluses,
and spending only a fraction of this
money.
According to its budget, AASA
had accumulated, as of December
31, 1992, a net surplus of $8,800.
Yet the group allocated a surplus of
$4,470 for 1993-94, most of which
would be transferred to a reserve
account. Why should they hoard
students' money?
Adding insult to injury, in addi
tion to the surpluses, there was at
least $2,000 allocated in the 1992-
93 budget for events which did not
happen. These activities did not
materialize for hardly excusable
reasons, such as bad timing or poor
coordination of event dates and the
school calender.
AASA officials say the group
needs the money in case unexpect
ed events come up during the year
which it wants to fund, such wor
thy occasions as last year's visit
from "Joy Luck Club" author Amy
Tan. And such unexpected "bonus
es" may be indeed worthy. But this
past year AASA officials said the
group spent about $1,000 on such
costs, and this year, the group
asked for nearly five times that

amount for its surplus. Why?
By now AASA should be able to
itemize its costs to within $1,000.
Continuous surpluses are an unaf
fordable luxury now, especially
when other groups have cut their
budgets and found outside sources
of revenue. For example, KZSU has
energetically solicited outside rev
enue, and was thus able to lower its
fee request by 13 percent this year.
This is not to say that all budget
surpluses are unnecessary. Budget
surpluses can be an integral part of
the financial viability of a group.
One example is the Stanford Con
cert Network; this year, the net
work has been operating hand-to
mouth. The network's student
managers make the valid assertion
that one bad turnout for a concert
could wipe them out, and therefore
they need an allocated budget sur
plus. But it is up to individual
groups to justify the budgeting of
surpluses. Groups similar in
nature to AASA — such as MEChA
and the Black Student Union have
no history of surpluses.
Admittedly, AASA's budget for
1993-94 was only a 7 percent
increase from last year's budget.
However, it seems the budget sur
pluses have become a permanent
— and possibly even increasing —
line item. The AASA treasurer and
officer core should work hard this
year to create a strict, itemized
budget for 1994-95.
AASA has a very important role
at Stanford and its budget difficul
ties should not reflect badly upon
the group. Stanford students rec
ognize the need to keep up AASA's
many cultural and extracurricular
activities, events that give the Uni
versity so much of its flair. But in a
time of rising tuition and cutbacks
in the areas of faculty, academic
and extracurricular activities,
organizations must maintain tight
and well-ordered ships to keep
their credibility among the stu
dents high.
As Stanford learned just a few
years ago, well-intentioned but
careless bookkeeping can lead to
multifarious headaches and a loss
of reputation.
