## Forgiving and forgetting 
### 
I FORGIVE YOU. Such an easy thing
to say, isn't it? But I think it might be
the hardest thing to do, and also the
most powerful. To actually forgive some
one for something, even if they can't jus
tify it — it takes superhuman effort.
After seeing the tape of the Rodney
King beating for the umpteenth time, I
find myself having a tough time forgiving
these men. But I know I should. And
Koresh. How can I forgive someone who
did that?
But I know that I need to.
When I was 12, I moved from my
mom's house in Spokane, Wash., to the
even more enticing Fallbrook, Calif., to
live with my dad, his wife, and the two
kids he had by this second marriage.
My step mother wasn't that far off
from that same character in Cinderella.
For one reason or another — I don't even
know if she knows — Karen never liked
me. Either she felt threatened by this
new seventh grader in the house, or she
thought I was taking my dad's attention
away from her two kids, or she was jeal
ous of my impeccable fashion sense. I
dunno. But I knew she didn't like me.
I know now that I didn't lose stuff as
often as I thought I did. Money, a watch,
my Tommy Tutone cassette, items of
clothing and other little things always
seemed to get misplaced, and my naive,
trusting little mind believed her when
she responded that she didn't know

where they were.
Until I got so frustrated one day that I
was determined to find my lost wallet.
After everyone left for some family out
ing that I was conspicuously not included
in, I turned the house upside down. And
among her Calvins I found a nice little
cache of my things. None of this stuff
could have been any use to her. She
reflexively did it. Just to upset me.
Then I began to notice other things.
When my friends called, she would tell
them I wasn't home, even if I was in the
next room, and she would conveniently
forget to tell me about them. I missed out
on watching 300 Elvis Impersonators at
the Statue of Liberty festival for this
exact reason.
For one two-month period, I didn't get
any mail. I thought that was curious until
I spotted a poorly submerged letter
addressed to me when I took out the trash
one night. So from that point on, I would
go to the trash outside to get my mail.
That worked for about a year, until she
found out that I knew where to find my
mail, so she started burning it. Seriously.
And it's not so much what she did do
as what she didn't. Not one word of
praise for the straight-A report card. No
"how are things going?" or "do you need
anything?" Not even a birthday card.
Nothing.
After a few years, I realized the conse
quences. If people asked, I said I was

going "to my house," but never "home."
She made me feel unwelcome. Unloved.
Unworthy. She took away anything that
I could call a family.
But even from the beginning, I knew I
had to forgive.
I remember being told when I was very
young that I should not shout names
back at my sister because that would be
"sinking to her level." So what? What's
wrong with that?
But it makes sense now. If I remain
angry with Karen, then I would be sink
ing down. If I got angry at the things she
would do to me if she got a hold of this
column, then she would have won.
Something about forgiveness. It gives
you a peace, both with yourself and with
other people. Instead of always thinking
about how to get back at your roommate
for snoring, you thank him for not hold
ing any grudges against you.
How often shall my brother sin against
me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?
I do not say to you up to seven times,
but up to 70 times seven.
Pretty powerful stuff.

Mike Langford can never forgive the
Padres for trading Bip Roberts and
Roberto Alomar, though. Never.
