## Approaching Stanford with a ten-foot pole 
### 
My childhood dream was
to go to UCLA. From the
moment I realized that the pur
suit of a degree in "ratting and frosting"
from Mr. Dominic's Beauty Academy was
not a satisfactory educational plan as far
as my parents were concerned, I set my
sights on Westwood.
I'd be a very cute ID number in a very
large dorm, and date a very poetic foot
ball player.
I had always wanted to be one of the
regular kids, semi-intelligent, semi-moti
vated, semi-sexually active and semi-con
scious.
Instead I came to Stanford.
Oh, my dear Pro Fros, I remember
getting that big fat letter, delivered by
my mom at school. Yes, I could go up
North and be one of the "cream of the
crop." I was "terrific," they said, and I
could hold my own at one of the nation's
top-notch universities.
Shoot me now.
High-powered comrades, smaller class
size, brilliant faculty, it meant nothing to
me. I wanted the "Animal House" experi
ence. I didn't want to pull all-nighters, at
least not ones with the lights on, and I
didn't want to be challenged.
Call me crazy.
I had spent my whole life with sweaty,
myopic physics dorkwads in honors class
es, spouting off worthless facts and com
plaining about the common hordes and
their shallow pursuits. Cheerleaders

were sluts. Student Body officers were
airheads. Teachers were losers who
couldn't fmd well-paying jobs in good
neighborhoods. Principals were social
outcasts thrown aside because of poor
wardrobe-management skills.
They'll have such a good time togeth
er in hell.
So, as my brother, who went to Stan
ford at the time, said to me, "Get your
own school," the choice became clear.
It was time to be a bimbo.
UCLA here I come. Bacchanalian fes
tivities. Brain-cell damage. Huge classes.
Huge campus. Huge men with huge
biceps. I almost cried with excitement.
It was too good to be true.
But in a second, my world was crushed.
My stunningly caring parents insisted I go
to a school further away from home, a
school which would provide a more rigor
ous academic atmosphere, explaining that
potential boyfriends were not a good cri
terium on which to base my decision.
The brutes.
They made me come here.
I had no choice, as the figuris
parentati forced me into a life of deceit,
fooling myself into eiyoying CIV section.
I was given no say in the matter, and
soon me and my big plaid bathrobe, new
cheap sheets and Nature Company
posters were shipped third-class mail up
to Stanford.
I cried.
Here I was, dropped off in a place

where it rained. A place where people
had maxed out the SATs. A place where
the quadratic equation wouldn't just be a
"math thingy" anymore.
Oh, rapture.
Life was so unfair. I could've been
partying every night, and instead I'd be
studying away in the library. I'd be try
ing to keep up with my intellectual supe
riors. I'd be discussing Laconian signifi
cance and the center vs. periphery over
tater tots at dinner. I'd be flirting my
way to passing grades.
How could my life's goal, that quest
for mediocrity, be put aside? Don't get
me wrong, I had visions of grandeur as a
child. They always fluctuated between
wanting to marry the lead singer from
the Red Hot Chili Peppers and wanting
to be the dictator of a small third-world
country. Yet somewhere, somehow, there
was always the hope that I'd just be pop
ular. Have friends. Use that little, black
cocktail dress my dad bought me.
De-nied.
But I got my spirits up, put on a cut
off tank top and some tight jeans, and
headed off to parties. I was skeptical at
first, but soon realized that men were
simple everywhere, when it was a Friday
night.
What a relief.
Cheap pick-up lines about liking my
shoes. Cheap ploys to look down my top
and get me to have a beer. Cheap cologne.
This is what I'd been waiting for.

It didn't take me long to figure it out,
but it happened. People are the same
everywhere. Granted, people might get
the allusions in"The Simpsons" more
often here. People might have read more
Sappho. People might have a clue.
Or maybe not.
But just because people are smart
doesn't mean they're not "normal." Peo
ple are equally as stupid and idiotic at
Stanford. We have our bike accidents,
our fire alarms, our burning couches
thrown off the roof, our dyed-pink
underwear and socks.
Phew.
We have our stereotypes, too. Frat
guys are all dicks. Stanford women are
all ugly. Branner freshman are all stupid.
Grad students are all geeks. Granola peo
ple all forget to shower. Food service food
is all bad.
OK, I crossed the line.
Above all, we are normal. OK, smarter
than normal, but basically normal. And I
like it. I like Stanford. Yes, I admit it. I
love Stanford, from The Axe to our black
squirrels.
I figure UCLA's a decent grad school.

Tish would like to thank everyone else for
coming to Stanford, too, especially Gar
ner "Ice " Weng. Ackthpppt.
