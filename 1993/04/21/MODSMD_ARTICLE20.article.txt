## Virtually everyone is interested in virtual reality The 						'goggles and gloves' aside, communication researchers are working on the nuts and bolts of this new technology 
### Peter Stevens Staff writer 
Instead of getting caught up in
the popular "cyberspace" hype,
several Stanford researchers are
making significant strides in virtu
al reality research by simply exam
ining the relationship between
computers and humans.
Asst. Prof. Clifford Nass and
Prof. Byron Reeves, both in the
Communication Department, and
several of their graduate students
are examining the characteristics
of computers that cause people to
react to the machines as they
would to other humans.
"We found that people exhibited
behaviors when working with our
computers that we normally associ
ate only with interactions between
humans," said Jonathan Steuer, a
communication graduate student
working on these experiments. "To
a certain extent, people are treating
computer programs as social actors,
even though they know that the
program is not another person."
The results of their research will
greatly impact the design of com
puters, learning systems, commu
nications devices and entertain
ment systems in the future.
As computers become more vivid
and interactive, users experience a
synthetic environment that is
increasingly real. These machines
provide users with increased inter
activity over traditional media —
such as television — and greater
levels of vividness over technologies
such as the telephone.
Interactivity describes how a
machine or a human responds to
actions of others. As a machine
uses more contextual and historical
information people see it as more
interactive and intelligent. Vivid
ness refers to how much informa
tion the user gains in interactions
with the machine.
For example, a computer dis

playing only text is less vivid than
one with sound or animated graph
ics. As interactivity and vividness
increase, the environment created
by the machine seems increasingly
real to users.
At Stanford, however,
researchers are beginning to rede
fine the notion of "virtual reality,"
a term that has been popularly
used to describe a technology —
typically consisting of head-mount
ed displays and very powerful
graphics hardware.
Virtual reality, Steuer said,
should be defined in experiential
terms, rather than in terms of the
equipment used.

According to
Steuer, much of
the current work
in virtual reality
is aimed toward
increasing the
power of graphics
hardware and cre
ating head
mounted displays
to achieve higher
levels of Derceived

reality. This work may be headed
in the wrong direction, he said.
Their research has shown that
complex cues, like talking heads
and powerful graphics, may not be
needed because simple cues have
convinced human users to interact
with the machines as they would
interact with other people. Steuer
warns, however, that the cues
must be the right ones.
"We want to see how crummy
the system can be and still evoke
social responses from people,"
Nass said, adding that even very
low-frame rate animations are suf
ficient in many cases.
The researchers, however,
found that adding high quality
voice synthesis to the computer
added significantly to the social
characteristics users ascribed to
machines.

The experiments were designed
to test whether people who were
accustomed to computers would
assign social roles and characteris
tics to computer programs.
Although their test subjects did
not confuse computers and televi
sions with human beings, they did
ascribe to them characteristics that
are more associated with human
interactions than with interactions
between people and machines.
"Sustained interactions be
tween people and machines that
mimic interpersonal relationships
are common," Nass said. "But pre
vious researchers have claimed
that this results from ignorance or
mistaken identification of comput
ers with humans."
However, their research shows
that people will assign distinct
"selves" to different voices "spo
ken" by computer programs. No
other human assignment — such
as a name or an animated face — is
necessary.
Human subjects in these experi
ments used social rules in interact
ing with the computer. In normal
human interactions, people believe
that praise bestowed upon a third
party by others is more valid than
praise from themselves.
The test subjects used these same
rules in interacting with computer
programs that praised and criticized
other computer programs. They
thought the program had done a bet
ter job when it was praised by anoth
er computer program.
The research showed that peo
ple interact with the machines as
they would interpersonally.
In addition, some of Reeves'
experiments showed that high res
olution, big-screen images provide
a more exciting entertainment
experience, but the people using
this equipment retained less infor
mation. These high resolution sys
tems may be worse for teaching.
Steuer said that less vivid media,

such as low-definition computer
graphics, require an active engage
ment that promotes learning. The
higher-resolution displays do not
require active mental engagement.
These systems provide what
Steuer calls telepresence, the sense
of being in an artificial or remote
environment. As communication
media provide a greater degree of
vividness and interactivity the envi
ronment seems increasingly "real."
Communication media that pro
vide telepresence are not new —
the telephone is a good example of

such a machine.
Other forms of communication
systems in use today vary in their
characteristic interactivity and
vividness. One example is the Inter
net computer network that links
millions of computer users around
the world. This network has been
termed a "virtual community" by
Howard Rhinegold, an early com
mentator on virtual reality.
Internet provides a high degree
of interactivity but limited degrees
of vividness. Physical characteris
tics such as appearance and loca

tion are unimportant.
These existing systems, the tele
phone and Internet, each provide a
sense of presence, a sense of place.
People who use them have an expe
rience that is best described as
being in an environment.
All this research brings up an
interesting question: What should
one do with virtual reality — teach,
entertain or use it as a tool?
"There are many more ques
tions to answer in this area,"
Steuer said. "We are just beginning
to scratch the surface."

fine the notion of "virtual reality,"
a term that has been popularly
used to describe a technology —
typically consisting of head-mount
ed displays and very powerful
graphics hardware.
Virtual reality, Steuer said,
should be defined in experiential
terms, rather than in terms of the
equipment used.

According to
Steuer, much of
the current work
in virtual reality
is aimed toward
increasing the
power of graphics
hardware and cre
ating head
mounted displays
to achieve higher
levels of Derceived

reality. This work may be headed
in the wrong direction, he said.
Their research has shown that
complex cues, like talking heads
and powerful graphics, may not be
needed because simple cues have
convinced human users to interact
with the machines as they would
interact with other people. Steuer
warns, however, that the cues
must be the right ones.
"We want to see how crummy
the system can be and still evoke
social responses from people,"
Nass said, adding that even very
low-frame rate animations are suf
ficient in many cases.
The researchers, however,
found that adding high quality
voice synthesis to the computer
added significantly to the social
characteristics users ascribed to
machines.

The experiments were designed
to test whether people who were
accustomed to computers would
assign social roles and characteris
tics to computer programs.
Although their test subjects did
not confuse computers and televi
sions with human beings, they did
ascribe to them characteristics that
are more associated with human
interactions than with interactions
between people and machines.
"Sustained interactions be
tween people and machines that
mimic interpersonal relationships
are common," Nass said. "But pre
vious researchers have claimed
that this results from ignorance or
mistaken identification of comput
ers with humans."
However, their research shows
that people will assign distinct
"selves" to different voices "spo
ken" by computer programs. No
other human assignment — such
as a name or an animated face — is
necessary.
Human subjects in these experi
ments used social rules in interact
ing with the computer. In normal
human interactions, people believe
that praise bestowed upon a third
party by others is more valid than
praise from themselves.
The test subjects used these same
rules in interacting with computer
programs that praised and criticized
other computer programs. They
thought the program had done a bet
ter job when it was praised by anoth
er computer program.
The research showed that peo
ple interact with the machines as
they would interpersonally.
In addition, some of Reeves'
experiments showed that high res
olution, big-screen images provide
a more exciting entertainment
experience, but the people using
this equipment retained less infor
mation. These high resolution sys
tems may be worse for teaching.
Steuer said that less vivid media,

such as low-definition computer
graphics, require an active engage
ment that promotes learning. The
higher-resolution displays do not
require active mental engagement.
These systems provide what
Steuer calls telepresence, the sense
of being in an artificial or remote
environment. As communication
media provide a greater degree of
vividness and interactivity the envi
ronment seems increasingly "real."
Communication media that pro
vide telepresence are not new —
the telephone is a good example of

such a machine.
Other forms of communication
systems in use today vary in their
characteristic interactivity and
vividness. One example is the Inter
net computer network that links
millions of computer users around
the world. This network has been
termed a "virtual community" by
Howard Rhinegold, an early com
mentator on virtual reality.
Internet provides a high degree
of interactivity but limited degrees
of vividness. Physical characteris
tics such as appearance and loca

tion are unimportant.
These existing systems, the tele
phone and Internet, each provide a
sense of presence, a sense of place.
People who use them have an expe
rience that is best described as
being in an environment.
All this research brings up an
interesting question: What should
one do with virtual reality — teach,
entertain or use it as a tool?
"There are many more ques
tions to answer in this area,"
Steuer said. "We are just beginning
to scratch the surface."
