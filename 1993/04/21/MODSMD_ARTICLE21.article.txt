# Hot bug speaks of cold showers

### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: Please help clear up a minor
argument for me: I think if a per
son goes out on a hot day and exercises,
and then wishes to cool off as quickly as
possible, he should take a warm or hot
shower. My reasoning is, by doing so, he
opens up his pores, and they release the
heat faster. My friend, an exerciser, feels
a cool shower is best. He says that cool
water lowers his body temperature and
that, therefore, cools him off.

A: Susan, I can't help pointing out
that the chilly blasts of a suffi
ciently cold shower can lower much
more than a man's body temperature.
Because I am disinclined to sarcasm
and innuendo, however, I will refrain
from wondering aloud whether your
"friend" might be using his cold show
ers to kill two birds with one stone.
Your explanation of the benefits of
warm showers is bogus. Heat loss per
se does not proceed more rapidly
through open pores than through
closed ones. Nonetheless, both warm
and cool showers — as well as tepid
ones, for that matter — can help an
overheated person return to a more
comfortable body temperature.
Exercise ordinarily raises deep
body temperature by a degree or so;
in some unfortunates, prolonged
exertion can increase the rectal
thermometer temperature as high
as 40-41 degrees Celsius (for those
of you who are really bad at the
green squares in Trivial Pursuit™,
37 C is the species norm). Thus,
cooling off after an invigorating
bout of shorin-ryu karate can indeed
be important.
I took pains in the preceding para
graph to distinguish deep-body and
skin temperatures for a couple of rea
sons. First, they are generally differ
ent (the body surface is cooler than
the core by a couple of degrees Cel

sius). Second, internal temperature is
much more important than skin tem
perature to the maintenance of opti
mal brain and heart function.
The human body responds to the
slight hyperthermia (overheating)
associated with exercise by increasing
the rate of heat loss through the skin.
Dilation of capillaries located just
under the skin results in an increase
in the volume of blood passing near
the body's surface, raising skin tem
perature and enhancing heat transfer
from blood to the surrounding air.
Evaporation of sweat (assisted by the
increased skin temperature) also car
ries away heat.
These mechanisms allow your
buddy's body to maintain a normal or
slightly elevated temperature during
his workout; after he's done for the
day, his built-in climate control sys
tem will eventually return him to the
normal core of 37 C.
Should he wish to hit the showers
for more rapid relief of his mild hyper
thermia, however, he has a pretty
wide range of water temperatures to
choose from. The optimal setting is
subject to taste, but I can offer a few
words of advice.
If your pal's goal is to cool off as
rapidly as possible, he might naively
turn the water to the coldest setting
and douse himself until he shivers.
After all, heat flow between two bod
ies is directly proportional to the tem
perature difference between them.

The co).der the water, the larger the
temperature difference, the faster the
heat transfer away from his recently
sweaty flesh — right?
Not exactly. The capillaries just
under his skin — the ones we were
depending on to take large volumes of
blood near the body surface — will
constrict when the skin is exposed to
cold water, decreasing the rate of
heat loss. To add insult to injury, his
involuntary shivering may actually
accelerate the generation of heat by
the body.
What, then? Human physiology has
confounded our intuitive approach,
but physical chemistry suggests an
alternative solution. Evaporating
water (for example, sweat) carries far
more heat away from the body than
does water that is merely warmed by
contact before running off. Ergo, your
homeboy's. best strategy for a rapid
cool-off might be to wet himself thor
oughly and then stand in a warm, stiff
breeze.
Water molecules vaporized by his
body heat and whisked away by the
airstream would remove heat energy
much more efficiently and resource
consciously than would the brute
force, deluge method he traditionally
employs. Furthermore, since the bulk
of heat loss would be due to vaporiza
tion rather than the heating of water
from low to high temperature, the ini
tial wetting could occur at or above
room temperature rather than under
near-Arctic conditions.
But, as I suggested earlier, a cold
shower can have its benefits — espe
cially if it's not just his temperature
he's trying to get down.

Recent experiences, thankfully past,
have made Chris Patil all too familiar
with cold showers. Drop your questions
