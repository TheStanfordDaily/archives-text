# All about giving blood
## Dracula not the only one who wants your blood 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
Gotten a tattoo lately? How about a
pierced ear?
No? Then chances are you're qualified
to give a valuable part of yourself to your
fellow human — your blood.
Wait! Before you get queasy at the

thought of people in white
coats poking you with
long, unforgiving needles,
consider this: organ trans
plants — those surgeries
that mean life and death
for an ailing patient —
require an average of more
than 100 units of blood.
Each unit represents
one pint of blood, which

approximately equal to one donation of
blood. In other words, this means that
when it comes to giving blood, a little real
ly means a lot.
And despite all the medical advances in
the world today, blood still remains a
human necessity. According to Jeanne
Larkin, a recruitment consultant at the
Stanford Blood Center, the demand for
blood never ends.
The Blood Center serves as the chief
supplier to both the Stanford Hospital and
the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital.
Blood, which must kept be on hand at all
times in the hospital, is required in the
event that something goes wrong during
an operation and is integral during bone
marrow surgery and organ transplants.
In order to make sure that all blood
types are available on demand, the Blood
Center must get 100 units of blood a day.
The center turns to the local communi
ty for most of these donations, drawing
blood from nearby corporations and
schools. They tap the Stanford population
about 75 times a year. A majority of these
donations come from students.
Most people are able to donate and can

do so every 56 days, Larkin said.
However, certain conditions may pre
clude a person from donating — temporar
ily or permanently. The following people
are usually deferred: individuals who are
HIV-positive, those with Hepatitis, people
who weigh under 110 pounds, diabetics,
anemics, people with heart disease and
those currently taking the acne medication

Accutane. In addi
tion, a history of sex
ual contact with a
prostitute, with
someone of the same
sex or with a person
carrying HIV will
disqualify a person.
Temporary
deferrals are also

given to people who
have recently traveled to certain regions of
the world where communicable diseases
may taint a person's blood. People born in
South and West Africa have recently been
cleared for blood donations as long as they
have been in this country for six months.
Donating blood is easy and takes only
about an hour. Prior to taking your blood,
staffers will ask you certain medical ques
tions to make sure your donation can be
accepted. As part of the screening process,
they'll also take your blood pressure, tem
perature and do a check for blood-iron lev
els.
After you give, the hospital lab process
es the blood, where it's checked for HIV,
hepatitis and other conditions
As early as twenty-four hours later,
blood is transported to needy hospital
wards where it is usually put to use imme
diately. If you give today, odds are you are
helping someone right now.
Oh, if you are sportin' a new tattoo or
earring, you're not ofTlimits forever — just
a year. Think about donating.
