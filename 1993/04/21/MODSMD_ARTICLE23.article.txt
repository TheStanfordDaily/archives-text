## Goss transforms from a 'me' player into a 'we' player All-American opposite hitter becomes role model 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Dave Goss wants to be a sub
stitute teacher.
OK, let's try that again. Stan
ford men's volleyball star, senior
All-American, last year's All-
NCAA tournament player, proba
ble National Team player, possi
ble Olympic team player, definite
ly one of the top-three hitters in
the country — this same Dave
Goss wants to be a substitute
teacher.
Not only that, but an elemen
tary school substitute teacher.
"It's a way to get exposed to
teaching," he said. "The kids can
be unruly, but I think if you lay
down the law from the start it can
be very fulfilling, too."
For the past four years, Goss,
a fifth-year senior, has been
quite successful at "laying down
the law" for opposing teams.
1,916 times in his Cardinal
career (a Stanford all-time
record), Goss has lifted himself
above the net, reared back and
delivered a volleyball traveling
up to 100 miles-per-hour to the
opponents' floor.
"When I go up to a hit, I'm
thinking about jumping as high as
I can and reaching as high as I can
and hitting a high ball," Goss
said. "When I don't see a real
open space, sometimes I'll just hit
where the block will be and try to
get it to tool off the block."
Against UCLA last year Goss
had 55 kills in one match, an
NCAA record.
"Number 55. It was a "D" set,
down the line, on the right side,"
Goss said whimsically. "I just
hammered the crud out of it."
This year, the Bruins are the
No. 1 team in the country and

Stanford's archenemy, as they
will trade spikes with the Cardi
nal a week from today for the
right to go to the NCAA Final
Four.
"UCLA has the most physical
talent of any team in the nation,"
Goss said. "But they don't have
any concept of what a team is.
They don't have any concept of
giving, caring and sharing with
their teammates. They're a bunch
of individuals with gigantic egos
who care about themselves. Stan
ford's not like that. We're a
team."
For Goss, the most oft-award
ed Cardinal last year, this idea of
a team and team success is more
important than anything he can
accomplish individually.
"I don't care if I don't get any
awards [this year]," he said. "If I
don't get any acclaim, that's per
fectly fine with me because I've
gotten that. My ego has been sati
ated.
"The only thing I want right
now is a national championship. I
want it so bad it's crazy."
The word "team" didn't used
to be in Goss' vocabulary, though.
For his first two years at Stan
ford, his focus was mainly on him
self.
"I was out of control as a fresh
man and sophomore," Goss said.
"And my teammates didn't like
me for it. They said, 'What's up
with this Goss guy? Here he is, a
starter on the team, and he just
doesn't care.' "
"We went through some tough
times where I didn't know if Dave
was going to come through as a
volleyball player," said Stanford
coach Ruben Nieves.
Two years later, instead of
being a disruptive force, Goss has
become a stabilizer and a role

model to the freshmen.
"There was a time when Dave
was not the guy I would want
young players to model them
selves after," Nieves said. "Now
he is a super example. . . I am very
proud of Dave."
"It's funny because I see
myself in a lot of the freshmen,"
Goss said. "I don't ever want to
have a holier-than-thou attitude
with them. . . But I have some
thing to tell them. I have gained
some wisdom in these five years,
and I'd like to do my best to
impart that to them."
Not only a role model for the
freshmen, Goss has done his best
to provide stability and focus to
the entire team. At the beginning
of the year, Nieves rotated the
honor of captain among his six
seniors. But the rotation has
stopped with Goss.
"Dave emerged this year as our
leader among leaders," Nieves
said. "He's done a real good job of
leading and setting an example."
Goss has stepped willingly into
this role as captain, not only on
game days, but throughout the
season.
"I have written two letters to
my teammates that have encap
sulated my thoughts on this sea
son and what it takes to win," he
said. "They're pretty corny, but
writing them is a way of motivat
ing me extra hard. Hopefully it
can motivate them too, because
that's really the purpose.
"[Senior swing hitterl Bob
Hillman jokes and says, 'Dave,
now that you're out of school,
you're taking volleyball for five
units and writing essays.' "
A leader, a role model, and an
essay writer — perhaps Dave
Goss won't be such a bad substi
tute teacher after all.
