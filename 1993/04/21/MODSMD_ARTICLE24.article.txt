# Latest NCAA title proves Cardinal reigns supreme...again
## 
### 
And then there were four. With a
repeat command performance
turned in by the men's gymnastics
team last weekend in Albuquerque, Stan
ford now has four national champi
onships to its credit on the 1992-93
school year.
Combine these with the record-tying five
that our school earned in '91-'92 — which
adds to a two-year standard of nine — and it
is easy to see how "Cardinal rules" have
recently taken over the distribution of
NCAA titles.
What's more, we're not done yet. The
aforementioned single-school-year mark
stands in serious jeopardy as we speak. If
any two of Stanford's three most serious
spring-sport threats — women's tennis,
men's volleyball and men's tennis — reach
es the promised land in the coming weeks,
Cardinal athletes will own more champi
onship rings from this year alone than can
fit on one hand, an awe-inspiring prospect.
But before our most recent triumph is

mothballed away, another look needs to be
taken at a championship that almost
wasn't.
Stanford's men's gymnastics team, like
the men's and women's swim and women's
basketball squads before it, shouldered the
burden not only of entering the 1993 cam
paign as defending NCAA champs, but also
of being the nation's "top guns," with near
ly every piece of ammunition returning to
stave off all challengers.
Jair Lynch, after pacing Stanford to its
first-ever title as a junior, had added the

experience of the Barcelona Olympics to his
incredible athletic resume; Mark Booth, the
squad's third all-arounder as a sophomore
in 1992, was ready to make the move to No.
2; seniors Shawn Adamek and JefT Bender
were bringing in three years' worth of scars
from collegiate battles; and Jing-Wei Liang
led a cast of freshmen and sophomores that
gave the team unparalleled depth.
But just like the women's hoopsters —
who with all of their initial promise eventu
ally suffered the ignominy of having the
"Sheetz" (Shelley) drawn in like so many
"Showtime at the Apollo" curtains during
their postseason show — the gymnasts fol
lowed a disquieting pattern of early-season
losses that painfully exposed a host of
unwelcome flaws.
Sometimes, the pain manifested itself in
the form of injuries — while certainly not as
banged up as their female counterparts, the
Stanford men incurred ailments of varying
degrees up and down the lineup. In fact, the
squad rarely fielded the same roster for two

consecutive meets.
While no one was willing to rule Stanford
out of the championship chase — especially
after the Cardinal won the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation crown by more than
four points last month — prospects
remained relatively bleak. Would Liang's
injury heal in time for the NCAA Western
Regional qualifier? Would Hamada's strate
gy of "saving the best for last" and installing
more difficult, untested tricks into his
team's routines at the end of the season pay
off? Did the Cardinal simply have the moti
vation to pull it off again?
The regional meet did not do much in
the way of answering these nagging ques
tions. In fact, it added one, a loaded query
which Stanford had to look straight in the
barrel — could the team win it all without
Booth? Booth's ankle gave out that fateful
day in Norman, and while the Cardinal
squeaked into the NCAA Championship
meet with a third-place finish, all hopes of
succeeding in the finals seemed to fade

deeper into these Daylight Savings-short
ened April nights.
Booth, the "two" in Stanford's "one
two" punch, had gone the way of Magic
Johnson and Byron Scott's hamstrings in
the Los Angeles Lakers' 1989 postseason,
and his absence was to drive the final nail in
the Cardinal's coffin, giving the opposition
the slight edge it needed to wrest the covet
ed throne.
Or was it?
Unlike their swimming counterparts,
the gymnasts could not rest on dynastic lau
rels. They scrapped, and under Hamada's
steady tutelage, squeezed into the top-three
on the first night of the championships
before blowing by Nebraska and Ohio State
to regain their glory.
Clutch effort, defined.
