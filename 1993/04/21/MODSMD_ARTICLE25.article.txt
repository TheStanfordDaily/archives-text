# Baseball mixes things up, earns 5-4 victory versus San Jose State
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
While the new jerseys and
new-look lineup were flashy, it
was a trio of relatively untested
arms that led the Cardinal to a
5-4 win over San Jose State at
Municipal Stadium in San Jose
last night.
Senior Greg .Mix combined
with freshmen Dan Reed and
Mario Iglesias to hold the Spar
tans (27-15) to nine hits and
three earned runs.
"They pitched well in a tight
game," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "They didn't
have any cushion all game."
Mix (1-2), a senior, was mak
ing his first start of the season,
and only the fourth start of his
Cardinal career.
But the righthander was just
one of many cards shuffled by
Stanford (20-18) last night.
Todd Laßocca, who has started
at shortstop, left field and desig
nated hitter, began the night in
center field. Rod Meyer, who had
played eight of the previous 11
games in center field, moved to
left field. Normal left fielder/des
ignated hitter Steve Carver
made only his second start of the
season at third base, while third
baseman Brian Dallimore shift
ed to second base.
"We just wanted to shake
things up a little bit," Marquess
said. "We moved some people
around, and it worked out."
With the score 2-0 Spartans,
San Jose State lefty Joey Chavez
entered the fourth inning with

things well in hand. Chavez,
who leads the NCAA in wins
with 11, had mowed through the
Stanford lineup to that point,
retiring the first eight men he
faced.
But it was not to be Chavez's
night. A.J. Hinch and Dusty
Allen opened the Stanford
fourth with back-to-back sin
gles. Allen, normally the Cardi
nal cleanup hitter, moved into
the No. 3 spot in the batting
order last night behind Hinch.
The move paid off: on three dif
ferent occasions, the two
reached base consecutively.
Hits by Steve Carver and
Brodie Van Wagenen tied the
score, and a Rod Meyer sacrifice
fly gave the Cardinal a 3-2 edge.
"We haven't strung any hits
together in eons," Marquess
said. "Tonight we did a little bit
of that."
But the real key for the Car
dinal last night was the work of
Mix, Reed, and Iglesias. Reed
replaced Mix in the sixth with
Stanford clinging to a 4-3 lead.
The freshman, who has strug
gled this year after some early
season success, held the Spar
tans to one hit and one
unearned run in 2.1 innings of
work.
"Dan came in in a tough situ
ation, and kept us in there,"
Marquess said.
Reed was helped by Laßocca.
With one out, Tim Gavello sin
gled and stole second four pitch
es later. Hinch's throw skipped
into center field, and the speedy
Gavello, who is 11-for-ll in

stolen bases this season, tried to
advance to third on the play.
Laßocca rifled a perfect throw to
Carver at third, who applied the
easy tag to Gavello.
With one out in the eighth,
Iglesias relieved Reed. Iglesias,
also a freshman, has had more
than his share of late-inning
misfortunes, dropping ninth
inning decisions in Fullerton
and Reno.
On a 1-2 count, Laverne
Thomas lined a single off Igle
sias' glove to lead off the ninth.
"That frustrated me," Iglesias
said. "I tried to turn that frus
tration into aggression."
The righty came back and
slammed the door on San Jose
State, racking up a strikeout and
a pair of groundouts to end the
game.
"This is a big game for
Mario," Marquess said. "It's
tough for a freshman to come in
and do what he did."
"It feels good to do this,"
Iglesias said. "I wanted to prove
to the team that I can do the
job."
Stanford, which split its sea
son series with the Spartans,
sported cardinal-red jerseys last
night for the first time all year.
"I had no problem with the
change," Marquess said. "And
now, I guess it's good luck or
something."
"We talked about it at batting
practice," said Hinch. "We fig
ured it was time for some kind of
change. Who knows? After
tonight, we might be wearing
these things for a while."
