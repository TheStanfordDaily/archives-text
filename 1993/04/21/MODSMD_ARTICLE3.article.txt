# ASSU backs Asian-American studies
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Inspired by calls from student
leaders and a campus rally on
Monday, the ASSU Senate last
night passed a resolution in sup
port of an Asian-American studies
major.
"This has been a request from
the community for some time —
one that we should validate," said
undergraduate senator Mork
Murdock, one of the bill's authors.
"This is what we view as a first
step for the senate on this issue."
"We've been working with the
faculty on this in order to formu
late a specific proposal," added un
dergraduate senator Ying-Ying
Goh, another author.
While she emphasized that this
resolution was only a starting
point and did not commit the Uni
versity to fund any specific pro
grams, some senators felt that
support for the resolution could
have financial implications.
"Certainly this bill does ask for
an increase in expenditures," said
undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins, who opposed the bill but
did not have a vote.

"It seems a little hypocritical,"
he said. "We complain about the
lack of funding for financial aid
and other programs and then turn
around and support resolutions
like this."
The financial issue prompted
graduate senator Kevin Rudd to
argue against passing such a reso
lution. "We only have limited re
sources," said Rudd, also a non
voting senator.
"I'm worried that the ASSU
loses credibility when it shows
support for something like this,"
he added. "With the current bud
geting constraints, without details
like cost, how can we support an
other special-interest major right
away?"
Despite criticism regarding fi
nancial issues, the vast majority of
senators showed favor for the res
olution. This support was bol
stered by about 15 additional stu
dents who came to the meeting to
lend support to the measure.
According to the resolution —
co-authored by six senators —
student sentiment in favor of
such a major is strong. Senators
