# Nine reap honors for academics
## 
### Vivien Wang 
This year's nine recipients of the Dean's Award for
Academic Achievement include the composer of an or
chestral symphony have in common with a Mayan
speaking anthropology major and a math major whose
experiments are being used by NASA.
Tanya Leise, a mathematics major, focused on
mathematical problems in the design of zero-gravity
space experiments in capillarity for the past year. Her
experiments have been officially accepted by NASA to
be part of the second orbiting microgravity laboratory
in 1994.
"It was nice to get recognition for plowing along in
an academic project," said Leise. "You can sometimes
get buried in the math department."
A senior majoring in industrial engineering, Scott
Starrett, was recognized for "Mountain Castle," a com
position he wrote for a large orchestra.
"I was surprised, because I'm an IE (industrial engi
neering) mfyor, and I got an award for work in music!"
Starrett said.
Bianet Caste llanos' anthropological research project
on gender issues and education of teenage Mayan girls
brought her to a small village in Yucatan, Mexico. In the

course of her research, she learned to speak fluent
Mayan. Her findings were recently presented at a ses
sion of the National Conference on Chicano Studies.
Eytan Alpem, a biology msyor, began a research pro
ject in the Department of Pathology to explore a central
problem in blood formation related to "peripheral
blood" which may be used in bone marrow transplants.
Apostolos Lerios, majoring in
computer science, has worked on
the (Space) Shuttle Electrodynamic
Tether System project in the Space
Telecommunications and Radio
science Lab for the past several
years, developing much of the mis
sion planning and operations soft
ware and taking part in data analy
sis following launch and recovery.
English Angela Bakker's
research with Asst. Pediatrics Prof.
Carolyn Russo culminated in her
co-authoring a paper that is to be

published in the Journal of Psycho
logical Oncology. Bakker also
helped pioneer a new human biolo
gy course, "Seminar in Bioethics."
liana Ben-Amos, who has an
individually designed major in
"History and Philosophy of the
Social Sciences," was recognized for
her research on the historical devel
opment of diametrically opposed
photographic stereotypes of indige
nous South Pacific islanders.
Edward Chan, majoring in elec
trical engineering, was recognized
for his work at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. He designed a
printed circuit board and is cur
rently writing diagnostic programs
to test for bugs in the device, one of

which has already been installed.
Andras Vasy, who has a double
major in physics and mathematics,
has consistently been in the top of
his classes in both mathematics
and physics, including several
advanced graduate courses.
The award, honoring under
graduates demonstrating intellec
tual accomplishment, is now in its
fifth year. Recipients, all seniors
this year, were nominated by facul
ty and staff members they worked
with in academic or research areas.
Each student received a certifi
cate, a copy of the citation read at
the ceremony and a specially cho
sen book with a personalized book
plate.
