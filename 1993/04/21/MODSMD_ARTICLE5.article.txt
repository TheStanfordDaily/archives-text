# ASSU grad senators say they plan to get involved
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Vowing to dispel fears of weak graduate-student
representation in the ASSU, 13 graduate write-in
vote-getters have claimed their Senate seats.
However, one graduate senate seat may remain
vacant, because only five candidates have petitioned
for the allotted six spots from the Humanities and
Sciences and Education schools.
Still, the prompt claiming of the seats reflects
what appears to be a concerted effort of write-in
candidates to revive the graduate half of the senate
and address growing graduate-student dissatisfac
tion with the ASSU.
This year's election yielded nine more write-in
senators than last year, when three unofficial grad
uate candidates were elected.
Elections Commissioner Tom Tsao said seats
were awarded to write-in vote-getters based on their
results in the election and punctual filing of a decla
ration of intent to serve.
According to the ASSU Bylaws, write-ins receiv
ing enough votes to qualify for the senate have 48
hours after the end of the election to submit a decla
ration of intent.
Some write-ins, notably William Banks, who
with 19 votes won a voting seat in the Humanities
and Sciences and Education area, did not produce
declarations of intent. Tsao said he was surprised
that Banks did not claim his voting seat.
The new senators take office in a year that many
feel will decide the future of the
relationship between graduate
students and the ASSU. The
graduate senate was plagued this
year by poor attendance, which if
continued would hurt any gradu
ate reform efforts.
Those graduate students who
accepted senate positions this
weekend seemed to grasp the
urgency of the situation, and
many — voting and non-voting
senators alike — are pledging to
actively participate in the senate.
Several write-in candidates even
conducted informal campaigns.
Cecil Huang, the second-high
est vote-getter among Law, Busi
ness and Medical School candi
dates, said he and fellow medical
students Munish Gupta and Greg
Ruhnke — who were also elected
by write-in votes — decided to
launch a write-in campaign short
ly before the election when "it
came to my attention a week
before the elections that no one
was running, no one was repre
senting the Medical School."
Huang said he, Gupta and
Ruhnke expect to attend all sen
ate meetings in an effort to "find
out how student government real
ly works" and "see if we can do
anything substantial."
"I don't like the idea of separa
tion from undergraduates," he
said. "If we sever ties, we won't be
working on the same campus, and
the (student) government needs
the voice of the entire student
body to be effective."
Like Huang, business students
David Golob and David Waldorf
ran a small write-in campaign,
placing flyers in the mailboxes of

first-year business students.
Golob said he did not register for
official candidacy because he "was
unaware the filing deadline had
passed. It was not well-publicized
at the Business School."
Though he failed to win a vot
ing seat, Golob remains deter
mined to represent Business
School student interests. "I think
you'll see some pretty active
involvement from senators from
the Business School," he said.
"There are a few issues we feel
really have to be settled this
year." Among them is what Golob
calls "taxation without represen
tation" — the fact that graduate
students pay for many ASSU pro
grams that do not benefit them.
"Given the amount of money that
flows out of the Business School,
the rewards from the ASSU are
not commensurate."
He added that incidents such as
the electorate's rejection of the
Graduate Student Association's
special-fee request last week sug
gest that the interests of under
graduates and graduates have
diverged and the structure of the
senate may need to be re-examined.
Humanities and Sciences stu
dent Neil Crellin, who did not
solicit any support this year but
has served in the senate before,
said he claimed his non-voting
seat because he felt he "could be a
resource to the senate, since I've
done this before and know the
ropes. This may be a year where
experience may be useful."
Crellin said he is interested in
seeing the proposals for restruc
turing the graduate senate.
"I'm not sure I support gradu
ate separatism," Crellin said,
referring to the idea that gradu
ate students and the ASSU go
their separate ways. "But a large
number of graduate students

seem to.
There is still some busywork
left to be done before the current
senate can approve the newly
elected body.
Currently, there are nine can
didates eligible for eight Engi
neering and Earth Sciences slots,
but only five students willing to
fill the six seats from the Human
ities and Sciences and Education
schools. The senate will break the
tie for the last Engineering and
Earth Sciences senate position,
and most likely leave the sixth
Humanities and Sciences and
Education seat empty.
In other election news, Tsao
said that after tallying the 42 over
seas ballots not counted in general
returns Friday, the special-fee
requests of both the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra and Project
Motivation have officially passed.
Both organizations had garnered
just over the required 50 percent
approval in the general election.
In addition, the top three vote
getters for the Student Conduct
Legislative Council — Lawrence
Baeck, Reid Schar and Josh
Green — all write-ins, have
agreed to accept their positions.
Write-in candidates awarded
voting seats are Humanities and
Sciences and Education student
Chris Hoffman, Business School
students Steve Abbott and Greg
Waldorf, and Medical School stu
dent Cecil Huang.
Non-voting write-in senators
are Engineering and Earth Sci
ences students Rolando Zeledon,
Edward Sharp, Jose Luis Vamos,
Brian Busse and Rodrigo Ocejo;
Humanities and Sciences and
Education students Neil Crellin
and Rob Jonas; and Law, Busi
ness and Medical School students
Munish Gupta, David Golob and
Greg Ruhnke.
