# Students fasting for justice
## Hunger strike will protest policy on Haitian refugees 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Guantanamo Bay may be
2,500 miles from California, but
for several Stanford students,
it's close enough to make them
go hungry for a week.
In protest of the 199 Haitian
refugees trapped in a U.S. mili
tary installation in Cuba, more
than 100 Stanford students are
expected to start a fast begin
ning at midnight tonight.
Since many of the refugees
have tested HIV-positive, the
government has barred them
from entering the country, an
act protesters say violates U.S.
immigration laws.
Stanford is the latest in a
chain of universities across the
nation that have joined together
in a series of one-week hunger
strikes to protest the Hatians'
plight. Each college fasts for a
week at a time, and then passes
the fast along to another univer
sity. Stanford is receiving the
torch from UC-Berkeley and
will pass it to UC-Santa Cruz
next Wednesday.
"For me, this is a way of
protesting through a non-violent
act of civil disobedience," said first
year law student Susan Callen
der, one of the fast's organizers.
According to organizers, the
refugees, who are awaiting polit
ical asylum in the United States,

live in decrepit conditions; they
sleep with only bed sheets as
partitions while rats and scorpi
ons wander about their diseased
bodies.
Nadia Bishop, also a first
year law student, will be fasting

as well, but for only three days.
"I don't think I am physically ca
pable of fasting for the full seven
days," she said.

the fast will not be eating during
the project, they will be drinking,
and will be monitored by several
nurses from the Law School and
Cowell Student Health Center.
"I have fasted before," Callen
der said, "but not for more than
nine days. To ensure the health of
the protesters, we will be working
in close association with the Med
ical Center."
Bishop said her specific goal is

education. "Through this protest,
I hope to provide a basic aware
ness on campus." She said she
hopes to raise awareness not only
through the fast, but also with a
letter-writing campaign to Attor
ney General Janet Reno and Pres
ident Clinton.
Callender voiced disappoint
ment with Clinton's handling of the
situation. "Although it was initially
President Bush's project, it has
now become Clinton's problem. He
made a campaign promise to do
something about it and nothing has
happened. We want to see people
released and allowed to go through

the normal process of gaining asy
lum in the United States."
The project was started on
March 3 by Van Jones, a student
at Yale. From there the torch was
passed to Harvard and on to
Brown, winding its way across the
country until it arrived in Califor
nia this month.
"The idea of passing the fast
ing along is so that the flame is
never dropped and someone is
always fasting along with the
refugees," Callender said.
A rally in conjunction with the
fast will occur at 12:15 p.m. tomor
row in front of the Law School.
