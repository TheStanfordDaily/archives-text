# Students fasting for justice
## Hunger strike will protest policy on Haitian refugees 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Guantanamo Bay may be
2,500 miles from California, but
for several Stanford students,
it's close enough to make them
go hungry for a week.
In protest of the 199 Haitian
refugees trapped in a U.S. mili
tary installation in Cuba, more
than 100 Stanford students are
expected to start a fast begin
ning at midnight tonight.
Since many of the refugees
have tested HIV-positive, the
government has barred them
from entering the country, an
act protesters say violates U.S.
immigration laws.
Stanford is the latest in a
chain of universities across the
nation that have joined together
in a series of one-week hunger
strikes to protest the Hatians'
plight. Each college fasts for a
week at a time, and then passes
the fast along to another univer
sity. Stanford is receiving the
torch from UC-Berkeley and
will pass it to UC-Santa Cruz
next Wednesday.
"For me, this is a way of
protesting through a non-violent
act of civil disobedience," said first
year law student Susan Callen
der, one of the fast's organizers.
According to organizers, the
refugees, who are awaiting polit
ical asylum in the United States,

live in decrepit conditions; they
sleep with only bed sheets as
partitions while rats and scorpi
ons wander about their diseased
bodies.
Nadia Bishop, also a first
year law student, will be fasting

as well, but for only three days.
"I don't think I am physically ca
pable of fasting for the full seven
days," she said.
