# CPPC fooled by phony job listing
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
It sounded too good to be true.
A job listing posted at the Career Planning and
Placement Center from a company called British Pe
troleum Latin America advertised openings for 120
employees from the arts, accounting, engineering,
computer analyzing, marketing and manufacturing
msgors.

Prospective applicants would be flown to Mexico
and given two nights' accommodations at the compa
ny's expense in order to interview for positions, ac
cording to Lucky Gutierrez, a program assistant at
the CPPC. "Alumni, graduating students and sum
mer students" who wanted to work in the firm's Mex
ican operations only needed to mail a "business visa
application," along with a check for $21 to pay for the
visa, to the company's Marietta,
Ga., headquarters.
But this week, CPPC officials
removed the phony listing after
receiving a letter from British
Petroleum saying the corporation
does not have a Latin American
division nor offices in Marietta.
"It sounds too good to be true,"
said Lucky Gutierrez, a program
assistant at the CPPC. "[The job J
encompassed everybody."

Towards the end of the letter,
Gutierrez said, "they start con
structing this whole scam," —
asking for cashier's checks, a
business visa and $21.
"I've been [at the CPPC] for 25
years and I have never known this
to happen before. It's not some
thing students need to be con
cerned about," said CPPC Direc
tor Ruth Schneider.
Gutierrez said he knew of at
least four people who attempted to
apply for the job, but the CPPC
pulled the listing from their files
before the students sent in their
money, he said students were

"totally shocked" when they found
out about the phony application.
The letter and application were
on British Petroleum letterhead
and were signed by a William H.
Fernandez, supposedly the vice
president of Human Resources
for British Petroleum Latin
America.
"It was so well done as far as
having a very authentic look to
it," Schneider said.
She said the CPPC is unable to
verify their job opportunities
because they have thousands of
listings — sometimes hundreds of
new notices come in each day.
