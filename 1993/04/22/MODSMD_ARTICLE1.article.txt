# Cancer vaccine advance
## Technique makes vaccines stronger 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Stanford research has led to
another breakthrough in the fight
against cancer.
According to a study published
in today's issue of Nature, Medical
Center researchers have devel
oped a technique that will make
cancer vaccines more effective by
producing a stronger reaction
from the body's immune system.
The research was conducted by
Oncology Prof. Ronald Levy and
former School of Medicine post
doctoral fellow Mi-Hua Tao.
The technique involves linking
a protein known as GM-CSF to an
antigen from an immune system
cancer known as B-cell lym
phoma. An antigen is a substance
that triggers the body's immune
system to create antibodies that
will fight a foreign substance, in
this case the lymphoma.
Vaccines work by sensitizing
the body's immune system to a
particular disease-causing agent.
If the infectious agent invades the
body later, the immune system
quickly produces antibodies that
destroy either the agent itself or
the toxin it produces.
While similar vaccines existed
in the past, they produced a less
vigorous reaction from the im
mune system. The addition of the
GM-CSF protein makes the im
mune system respond more effi
ciently to the antigen.
"Our molecule ... stimulates
immune cells to take up the anti
gen and alter the antigen's form
so that the immune system can
recognize it better," Levy said in
a statement released yesterday.
While Levy and Tao were out
of town yesterday and could not
be reached for comment, Oncolo
gy Assoc. Prof. Branimir Sikic
said, "I think it's very exciting
work."
The research findings released
today continue Levy's cancer
fighting research. In a study pub
lished by the New England Jour
nal of Medicine in October, Levy

and other Stanford researchers
reported success in trials on
patients of a vaccine that used B
cells to prompt the immune sys
tem to fight lymphoma.
"This technique will upstage
our previous work," Levy said in
his statement.
B-cells are a type of white
blood cells that help the immune
system fight disease. B-cell lym
phoma strikes about 10,000 peo
ple every year.
Clinical trials on the new vac
cine should begin by October.
Stanford is currently attempting
to patent the new vaccine pro
cess.
