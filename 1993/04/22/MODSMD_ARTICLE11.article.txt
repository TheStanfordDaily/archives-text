Muslims, Croats battle
TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Bitter
fighting between Muslims and Croats raged in cen
tral Bosnia despite a truce yesterday, deepening the
ethnic fissures of the year-long Bosnian war. U.N.
officials accused the former allies of committing
wanton murders in "ethnic cleansing" operations.
The battles have fractured the central region
into myriad fronts, further diminishing hopes
that a U.N. peace plan for the warring Serbs,
Muslims and Croats will come to fruition.
The U.N. Security Council also was preparing
a statement saying it was "appalled by reports of
the atrocities and killings of civilian population"
in central Bosnia, where a truce reached Tuesday
failed to stop a sixth day of combat.
U.N. observers estimated at least 250 people
had died.
Muslims and Croats have been nominal allies
against the Serbs since Bosnia seceded from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia 14 months ago, but
they have periodically battled over territory.
