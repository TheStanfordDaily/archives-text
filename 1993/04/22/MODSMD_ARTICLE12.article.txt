# 40 bodies found in debris of Waco compound

### 
WACO, Texas (AP) â€” Investiga
tors sifting through the incinerated
ruins of the Branch Davidian com
pound have found about 40 bodies,
and three with recent bullet wounds.
But authorities said yesterday it
wasn't clear if the three were victims
of suicide or homicide, and there was
no immediate word that cult leader
David Koresh's body had been found.
Also still unclear was federal
agents' rationale for sending in tear
gas-firing tanks to end a 51-day
standoff with the cult on Monday.
Attorney General Janet Reno has
said that reports of child abuse in the
compound led her to authorize the
agents' assault. The White House
said yesterday that child abuse inside
the compound had been continuing;
the FBI said it had only old reports
and a psychiatrist's analysis.
Federal and state officials said
about 40 bodies were spotted in the
rubble by late yesterday, but most

likely wouldn't be removed before
today. Investigators were moving
cautiously in the city block-sized area
where Koresh and 85 others, includ
ing 17 children age 10 or under, were
believed to have died. Nine cultists
survived.
Many of the found bodies weren't
immediately moved because officials
were being careful to avoid possible
booby traps and ammunition that
could explode in the still-warm
debris, Justice Department
spokesman Carl Stern said in Wash
ington.
Stern said three of the victims had
gunshot wounds and died recently.
He said one had been shot in the fore
head and the head of another victim
was "virtually blown away."
Stern ruled out the possibility that
they were victims of shootouts Feb.
28 after a raid by federal Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents. But he
said it was possible that their bodies

were struck by ammunition exploding
during the inferno in the compound,
where at least $200,000 worth of
weapons were believed to have been
stored.
Monday's blaze at the sprawling
rural complex broke out after agents
used tanks fitted with booms to break
holes in the walls and pump in tear
gas.
The FBI says agents saw cult
members set fire to the wooden build
ings in a mass suicide and had other
evidence of arson. But at least two of
the survivors allege that a tank
knocked over lanterns and started
the blaze.
Cult member Rita Riddle, 34,
shouted to reporters as she left a fed
eral courthouse yesterday that "there
was no suicide pact." She was charged
with conspiracy to murder federal
agents; court documents allege she
was one of five women who aimed
rifles at the agents during the Feb. 28

raid.
In Washington, meanwhile, a
spokesman for President Clinton said
there were "mountains of evidence"
of prolonged child abuse inside the
compound.
"Protecting the kids was the ulti
mate rationale for going in," said
George Stephanopoulos, the White
House communications director.
Koresh was "marrying children"
and "sexually abusing children" and
children were "being taught how to
commit suicide, how to put guns in
their mouths, how to clamp down on
cyanide," he said.
"It was continuing, it was going
on," Stephanopoulos said.
Stern, however, said an FBI offi
cial told Reno the "bureau had no
information on post-Feb. 28 sexual
abuse of the kids, but that recently
someone who had come out of the
compound said he believed . . . the
children were being beaten."
