## Increasing awareness 
### 
More discussion about
sexual diversity should
be a priority of Res Ed

Between the recent
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days (BGLAD)
and the upcoming Gay Pride
March in Washington, D.C., the
gay community at Stanford has
encountered increased visibility as
of late.
However, in a few weeks the
msyority of students will only think
about the gay community when
they pass by the Fire Truck House
or happen to walk into the Coffee
House during a Queer Be-In.
For whatever reason, diversity at
Stanford seems to be defined by cul
tural and racial differences, and on a
lesser note, financial and geographic
differences. Sexual orientation is
not part of this circle. The evidence
of this can be seen in Orientation
programming, which concentrates
much more on cultural and racial
differences than sexual ones.
Therefore, as Residential Edu
cation works to reduce ignorance
at Stanford, it does so mainly along
racial lines. However, it leaves
much of the responsibility of
reducing ignorance about homo
sexuals and bisexuals to the gay
community. This is not to imply
that discussions of racial and cul
tural diversity should be dimin
ished, but rather that discussions
of sexual diversity should be
increased in a way that does not
stigmatize those who are not het
erosexual or confident in their sex
ual orientation.
Too often — as the case with the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford panels that visit dorms
— an "us and them" tone pervades
conversation. The result is a series
of questions that often don't get to
the core of the problem. This can
not be the only form of discussion
on the issue.
This type of dialogue reinforces

campus ignorance regarding the
gay community and keeps curious
students from attending BGLAS
activities, even though all students
are welcome. It seems straight stu
dents are afraid of being labelled
and miss out on the opportunity to
learn about alternative lifestyles.
This makes life that much hard
er for students who are unsure of
their sexual orientation — a diffi
cult subject to discuss. These people
could benefit from an atmosphere
where sexual orientation is as easily
discussed as race, and there is no
feeling of "us and them." If feelings
and experiences were shared openly
among dormmates, everyone would
feel much more comfortable and
these students would hopefully not
feel so isolated.
Residential Education should
first concentrate its efforts on Ori
entation. Between culture dinners
and programs such as "Faces of
Community," the focus of the
events is not hard to find. And the
dorm discussion which is encour
aged by the Orientation handbook
to take place after "Faces of Com
munity" usually revolves around
cultural and racial diversity.
The one program designated
specifically to dealing with sexual
diversity takes place during the
time slot of Special Orientation
Workshops, a period packed with
eight other interesting options. It is
obviously not a priority. In addition,
it is geared toward "those exploring
sexual identity issues," although
the handbook later states all stu
dents are welcome. How many
freshmen are going to feel comfort
able telling their brand-new room
mate that they want to go to this
discussion to learn more? If there
was more inter-dorm discussion
encouraged from the very begin
ning, all students would benefit.
It is unfair of Stanford — the
bastion of multiculturalism — to
leave all the education regarding
such an important issue to the gay
community. Residential Education
needs to step up and try to create
an atmosphere where students can
learn from each other in every
aspect life.
