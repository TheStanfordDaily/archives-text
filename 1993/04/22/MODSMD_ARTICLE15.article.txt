Photo spread tried to isolate East Palo Alto's problems

ON THE DAY THE DAILY printed
the story "Night and Day in East
Palo Alto: Hope and despair live
side-by-side in Stanford's not-so-distant
neighbor," a close friend of mine, a long
time community activist who lives in
East Palo Alto, dropped by unexpectedly
to see me and to ask me a question. She
asked, "What is going on at Stanford?"
Having not seen the April 5 issue of The
Daily, I did not have any idea to what
she was referring. She told me about the
story, and I noticed the look in her eyes
and knew exactly what she was think
ing. Once again, her humanity was being
questioned.
After reading Kwame Anku's very
excellent April 8 column, I felt the issue
had been sufficiently dealt with and I
was not going to submit my letter. Yet,
remembering how my friend had been
made to feel, I realized something more
needed to be said about "what's going on
at Stanford."
As Anku pointed out, the use by The
Daily of the night/day opposition rein
forced the racial dichotomy of
white/black. For anyone who has known
or identified with the black experience,
the article displayed a level of insensitiv
ity reminiscent of the benign neglect of

the "Moynihan Report." Yet, what
stunned me the most was not the
imagery, but the mere fact that such an
unsophisticated article could actually be
written, given the availability of scholar
ship that has demonstrated the complex
ity of such issues of race and poverty.
Andrew Hacker's "Two Nations" and
Jonathan Kozol's "Savage Inequalities"
are only two recent additions to a
counter-intellectual tradition that has
consistently mounted a challenge to the
idea that poverty comes from some
where other than our institutions.
The article therefore lacked any intel
lectual acuity and barred the complexity
of how East Palo Alto is necessarily sys
temically connected to Palo Alto â€” pro
duced as Sylvia Wynter has argued, as
the indispensable boundary marker and
specific mode of chaos to our order (both
conceptual and material) here at Stan
ford. As the Kerner Commission report
put it, "What white America has never
fully understood but what the Negro can
never forget is that white society is
deeply implicated in the ghetto. White
institutions created it. White institu
tions maintain it. White society con
dones it." However, as we have seen
since the 19605, it not only is a question

of whites, but rather one of the middle
classes of all racial and ethnic groups,
especially the black, who are necessarily
implicated in the systematic replication
of the ghettos.
From the platitudes and cliches of the
article, one would hardly think that
most purchasers of drugs in East Palo
Alto are non-East Palo Altons (including
Stanford students). The article not only
erases this present reality but, as well, it
denies the history that has produced
East Palo Alto. When Palo Alto wanted a
golf course, a stream was redirected and
land was taken from East Palo Alto to
build it. When the 101 Freeway was
built, 52 businesses were destroyed; no
consideration was given to the propri
etors or the residents whose lives were
disrupted. Where were these facts in the
report of "night and day" activities of
East Palo Alto?
That the editors allowed the article to
be printed in such a form reveals the
extent to which there are no standards
for public discourse on blacks and the
poor. Apparently, when it comes to these
groups, speculation and impressionism
can easily replace any kind of rigid intel
lectual analysis. The article made me
think of Eric Williams' insightful state

ment that British historians wrote as if
Britain had founded black slavery mere
ly for the satisfaction of abolishing it.
The article gave a similar impression:
the inner city exists only for the middle
class to display its moral humanitarian
ism towards it; it has no other reality,
and definitely is not generated from any
dynamics of institutional causality.
As long as we continue to think that
poverty and the destruction of people's
lives in the inner cities are not as system
ically produced as is the wealth of our
peaceful suburbs, then it will not disap
pear. As Charles Darwin wrote, "If the
misery of our poor be caused not by the
laws of nature, but our institutions, great
is our sin" (Voyage of the Beagle). That is
why, as Harold Cruse has argued, we
must begin to do the "hard thinking"
necessary for the transformation of our
present socio-systemic order. Thus, if this
article tells us anything, then it poignant
ly tells us that "what's going on," intellec
tually, "at Stanford" will not have the
explanatory power to deal with the sys
temic, global crises (of Bosnia, South
Central Los Angeles and the environ
ment) that we all face now as a species.
