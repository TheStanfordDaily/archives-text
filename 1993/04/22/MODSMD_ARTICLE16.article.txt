# Grad students unfairly pay ASSU fee in return for almost no services
## 
### 
Monday's Daily editorial suggests
that graduate students are not ade
quately represented in the ASSU. I dis
agree. Graduate students shouldn't be
part of the ASSU in the first place.
Make-believe government may be inter
esting and perhaps even useful to a rea
sonable fraction of the undergraduates,
but the ASSU is almost entirely irrele

vant to most graduate students. The
only ASSU activities which I have
observed to have significant graduate
involvement and support are the GSA,
Tuesday Films and Legal Services. The
first two have been axed, and graduate
students can certainly provide their own
legal services for far less than the $100-
per-year of ASSU fees!
Perhaps the most annoying part of
The Daily editorial and the ASSU itself
is the attitude that we "don't know how
much the ASSU does for us." I know
exactly how much the ASSU does for me
and it's damn little. That's OK, because
I don't want anything from the ASSU. I

only want it to stop taking my $100
every year and then making me File a
request to recover some fraction of it.
The ASSU doesn't serve graduate
students, and it shouldn't try to do so.
It should just stop taking our money
and leave us alone. There is a time for
everything, and for most graduate stu
dents the time for playing "govern
ment" is long past. The only role that
the graduate students play in the
ASSU is to double the revenue it
receives. For this reason, I propose
that the newly elected graduate sena
tors should place an amendment on
next year's ballot to remove graduate

students from the ASSU. Let my peo
ple go!
