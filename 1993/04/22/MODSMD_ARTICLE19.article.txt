## Why we can't deal with race 
### 
1 RECENTLY WAS IN A discussion
when I heard a white student say, "I
don't think anyone could argue that
things in regards to race have not gotten
better in the last 30 years." I thought to
myself, "Where is this guy from?" but I
couldn't attack his argument because I
realized that in his eyes things were bet
ter.
This got me thinking How can we be
at Stanford — this bastion of intellectual
ism — and still have people walking
around saying how much better things
are?
In multiculturalism's sorry attempt to
break down color barriers, it has actually
misinformed the so-called ignorant. It is
from this misinformed perspective that
people make comments like, "Well, why
do black students want to socialize with
other blacks?" or my favorite one, " I
don't see why there has to be Black His
tory Month ... I mean there's no such
thing as white history month." (They
always breathe a sigh of relief when I
Remind them that every month is white
history month).
There always seems to be an inherent
defensiveness on the part of those who
think the history books are just fine. In
my opinion, if you have no idea what it is
like to go through an educational system
that has consistently devalued you, you
are not in much of a position to complain
against changing the education system.

From first-hand experience, I know
the damaging effects of going through
this entire system. Imagine how ridicu
lous I must have looked as a little first
grader when my teachers dressed me up
as a pilgrim. I am not attacking it because
it is Euro-centric, but rather because it
an inaccurate representation of history
— along with having detrimental effects
on black kids that are told that they were
never part of the mainstream (then we
are criticized later for being "unpatriot
ic"!?!).
The point is that black people can
never lose themselves in the nostalgic
cloud of Americana. For every white per
son who gets teary eyed and thinks of lib
eration from England when they hear the
national anthem, there is a black person
saying to him or herself, "There weren't
any black people celebrating on July 4,
1776."
I used to think America simply lived in
denial, but I realized that we do not deny
reality — we create a perception of reali
ty. Unfortunately, since we all didn't cre
ate the perception, Americana isn't all
that appealing to everyone.
Growing up, my white classmates
could connect with a fantastical narrative
of founding fathers who created "this
great nation." On the other side, I was
connected to a history that said black
Americans' "evolution" started in the
jungles of Africa and took us through

slave ships, underground railroads, the
civil-rights struggle and now on to killing
each other in the inner city. This a far cry
from the Boston Tea Party or heroic sto
ries about Paul Revere.
I bring all of this up to show there are
different historical consciousnesses that
lead to different perceptions of reality.
White students who have such a big prob
lem with "ethnic groups" segregating
themselves should seek to gain a deep
ened understanding, instead of being so
judgmental.
How do we as a community start deal
ing with these things? I think we should
get in candid discussions about our
beliefs and myths about race and these
divisionary categories. Res Ed has tried
to get all the colors of the rainbow to live
comfortably together, but has not want
ed to deal with uncomfortable history
that has created the tensions. There is
nothing comfortable about slavery,
lynchings, segregation or the Ku Klux
Klan. Dealing with any aspect of the
country's hidden guilt complex will be
difficult, but the journey to recovery is
never easy.
