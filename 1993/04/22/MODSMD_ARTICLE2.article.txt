America's sex life is in good, if tiny, hands.
This much seemed clear from the two-hour
book-signing stop Dr. Ruth Westheimer made at
the Stanford Bookstore yesterday afternoon. Wes
theimer, a noted sex adviser more commonly
known to the American public as Dr. Ruth, is cur

promotional tour for her most recent book, "The
Art of Arousal."
From a distance, Westheimer seems minus

Now your friends are gonna ask you what you did

almost twice her size, who plans to give a copy of
the book to two recently engaged friends. He
blushed slightly, looking helpless. "You tell them
that all you did was buy my book, OK?" He nod
ded, relieved, and made a break for the cash regis

Most of the fans who hovered around the im

many of whom patiently spelled out the names of
boyfriends and "just friends" when their turn
came at the front of the line. "I have some men get
ting them for themselves," Westheimer pointed
out, but they were in the minority.
These men were, however, no less enthusiastic.
One male admirer, unencumbered by a female
companion at the moment, planted a kiss on Wes
theimer's cheek after drawing close for a picture.
She concealed her mild annoyance almost com
pletely, and soon returned to pertly greeting her
