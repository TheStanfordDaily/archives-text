# Dr. Ruth arouses campus
## Diminuntive diva signs copies of her new book 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
America's sex life is in good, if tiny, hands.
This much seemed clear from the two-hour
book-signing stop Dr. Ruth Westheimer made at
the Stanford Bookstore yesterday afternoon. Wes
theimer, a noted sex adviser more commonly
known to the American public as Dr. Ruth, is cur
rently traveling around the United States on a
promotional tour for her most recent book, "The
Art of Arousal."
From a distance, Westheimer seems minus
cule, a childlike figure surrounded by eager giants.
From closer up, it is apparent that her feet don't
reach the ground from a standard office chair. All
the more striking, then, were the pithy quips and
earthy innuendos she aimed upward from behind
the book-signing table.
"... from Jeff and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Ha.
Now your friends are gonna ask you what you did

with her," she admonished an undergraduate man
almost twice her size, who plans to give a copy of
the book to two recently engaged friends. He
blushed slightly, looking helpless. "You tell them
that all you did was buy my book, OK?" He nod
ded, relieved, and made a break for the cash regis
ter.
Most of the fans who hovered around the im
mensely energetic Westheimer were women —
many of whom patiently spelled out the names of
boyfriends and "just friends" when their turn
came at the front of the line. "I have some men get
ting them for themselves," Westheimer pointed
out, but they were in the minority.
These men were, however, no less enthusiastic.
One male admirer, unencumbered by a female
companion at the moment, planted a kiss on Wes
theimer's cheek after drawing close for a picture.
She concealed her mild annoyance almost com

Dr. Ruth Westheimer signs copies of her new book, 'The Art of Arousal," at the Stanford Bookstore
yesterday afternoon.
customers.
Business, after all, was boom
ing. Westheimer signed copies of
"The Art of Arousal," which sells
for $35 in hardcover, for two solid
hours, with no more lengthy rest
for her writing hand than the
time it took to sip milky coffee
from a nearby mug.
The book itself resembles less
the self-help paperbacks that pro
pelled Westheimer's name into
the American pop-sex lexicon
than a standard-issue art history
text. Within its pages, the author
explores a broad spectrum of erot
ica as depicted in the visual arts
from antiquity to the present.
"The Art of Arousal" combines
paintings, sculptures and Greek
potshards to tell the oldest story
in the world in the order most
familiar to its participants:
Rather than appearing in chrono
logical or cultural order, the pic
tures proceed from flirtation to
foreplay, climaxing with inter
course and ending with blissful

exhaustion.
The book contains an implicit
message about the audience's
need to protect itself. Rather
than grappling with the nuts and
bolts of full participation in sexu
ality, as do Westheimer's previ
ous professional writings, the
book instead seems to invite
vicarious appreciation of erotica
as conceived and presented by
others.
"The whole football team can
be in your bed," Westheimer
writes "or you can join a crowd
bathing in the fountain in any vil
lage square — just as long as it
remains a fantasy."
Beyond that, what one concept
does she want college students to
take from her writings into their
bedrooms?
"I would tell them to become
sexually active only if they want
to," she said emphatically. "It is
very important also to always be
protected — against disease —
but most of all if they feel that
something is not right, they
should wait for someone more
special.
"This issue of consent is the
most important thing."
