## Lynch leaves legacy of success behind Senior gymnast spurs Stanford to new heights during his career 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
"Leave your mark."
As each Stanford gymnast started his rou
tine in the NCAA Finals, Jair Lynch's words
seemed to resonate above the sound of the
crowd.
Not only has the senior left his mark on the
Cardinal men's program, but his contribu
tions to the world of collegiate gymnastics will
be remembered long after he has moved on.
As one of the Cardinal squad's leading scor
ers for the past four years, Lynch led the team
to back-to-back national championships. In last
year's NCAA team finals, he set a new all
around record with a score of 59.025, and went
on to capture the high bar title. Last weekend,
he also became the 1993 parallel bar champion.
Yet his list of achievements doesn't end
there. As the youngest member of the nation
al team, Lynch competed in Barcelona last
summer after finishing fourth in the Olympic
Trials. While illness kept him in bed the week
before the Olympics, he still finished sixth on
the parallel bars.
"They had me on 16 different antibiotics,
trying to get my fever down and trying to get
my stomach to hold food — it was pretty hec
tic," he said.
Despite his sickness and the doubts of
those who thought he was too young to be pre
pared for Olympic competition, Lynch clearly
established himself as one of the up-and-com
ing gymnasts on the American scene.
"Just getting though that whole experience
and competing for the U.S. in front of the
world was great," Lynch said. "It just makes
me want to go back again."
Lynch got his start in the gym at the age of

eight, when he switched from diving to gym
nastics at the urging of his coaches, who rec
ognized his natural talent for the sport.
Once he decided his future was in gymnas
tics, Lynch began competing for a club team in
Washington, D.C. He soon gained notoriety as
one of the most promising young gymnasts on
the East Coast, and at 16, became the
youngest No.l-ranked junior-national team
member.
Heavily recruited by colleges across the
country, Lynch picked Stanford over UCLA,
his other top choice.
"I thought Stanford provided the best
coaching situation," Lynch said. "I didn't feel
like I was going to fit in as well on the UCLA
team, and I am glad I made that decision
because I have a very good relationship with
Sadao." .
He will continue to train with Stanford
coach Sadao Hamada to reach his next goal —
a trip to Atlanta in 1996. While the Olympics
may still be three years off, Lynch maintains
an extremely high level of training intensity,
often staying in the gym to perfect a move
hours after official practice has ended.
Lynch's work ethic not only impacts his
own performance, it also influences his team
mates' perceptions of their own practice
schedules.
"At times when I've felt tired, hungry and
thought about all the homework I have to do I
look and see Jair on his sixth event, still
putting in 100 percent effort," freshman
Peter Hegi said. "I think, 'Heck, if he can do
it, then surely I can put aside my pains.' "
While Lynch's dedication and hours of
extra practice have both been keys to his suc
cess, his teammates recognize that gymnas
tics also comes instinctively to him.

"Jair's strengths he in his understanding
of the mechanics of the sport," sophomore
Josh Stein said. "He knows how every trick
works, where his body is supposed to be. Once
he does it and understands, his body natural
ly knows how to do it."
During his time at Stanford, Lynch has
challenged himself to extend this natural tal
ent in new directions. Working with Hamada,
he is continuously developing and testing new
tricks.
"Gymnastics is one of those sports where
you can never be done, never be good
enough," Lynch said. "There's always another
day where you can go in and learn something
new."
This season, Lynch faced further chal
lenges as team co-captain. In leading a team of
distinct individuals, Lynch's job entailed uni
fying the squad and fostering a workout envi
ronment in which each gymnast felt secure
and relaxed.
"He has really made me feel like a part of
the team," Hegi said. "When I doubted my
place, he'd come over and reassure me that
I'm on the team for a reason, which is a real
boost of self-confidence."
Lynch sees the team's diverseness as a
strength which, as captain, he has tried to use
to the squad's advantage.
"There are so many different personalities
on this team and we thrive on that," Lynch
said. "I have to calm everyone down and make
everything blend together so we can go out
and perform."
With these leadership abilities and the
championship skills he has developed at Stan
ford, Lynch is now ready to take his own
advice and make an equally impressive mark
on the international gymnastics world.
