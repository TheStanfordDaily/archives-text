# Joe fans become Kansas City converts
## 
### 
I'm a Kansas City Chiefs fan. It hap
pened on Tuesday, after I turned on
CNN and found out that the great
est quarterback of all time would be
playing in that dusty Midwestern town.
Joe Football was coming back.
I have to admit, I, like every one of
you, was sickened by the whole
Young's-number-two-unless-Joe's-seri
ous-about-leaving deal going on with
the 49ers. Joe's staying, Joe's going,
Joe's staying again, Joe's going to
Phoenix, Joe's going to KC, Joe's going
potty. I mean, even Reggie White's
starting to feel neglected. One more
press conference and the 49ers will
need a circus license.
Joe Montana will be a shot in the
arm for the ailing Chiefs, who haven't
started a quarterback under the age of
62 since 1980. Not only that, but he's
good enough, he's smart enough and
dammit, people like him. In Kansas
City, that is. If you call what Joe's got
ten in San Francisco this year apprecia
tion, you're wrong. I wouldn't even
want to step in what Joe's gotten this
year.
Being from New York (actually, I
regret to say, New Jersey), I never paid
much attention to San Francisco
teams, except when the Giants were
playing them. But after that first time
Joe burned us for an 80-yard touch
down pass, I became a believer. I start
ed watching Joe whenever I could, and
he just kept getting better and better. I
even felt bad when the Giants'
Leonard Marshall put Montana on his
back and out of the 1991 NFC Champi
onship game with a bruised sternum

and a broken bone in his right hand.
Joe seemed to know how to win a ball
game, however he could. I could never
figure out what it was he did, he just

won.
Which is why I hated watching him
sit on the sidelines this year. Remem
ber, just two years ago, people were still
calling Joe Montana the greatest quar
terback in football. Now he's an old
man, can't walk, can't see, teeth falling
out, getting arthritis, bones don't work,
has a glass eye and needs a liver trans
plant.
Wait a minute, I think that's Bo
Jackson.
Sure, he may be old, but I'll say what
millions said for George Foreman:
"Give the old fat geezer a chance!"
All right, so maybe Joe's not all that
fat, but with all those Twinkies in the
off-season, you never know.
Okay, here's a quiz. Montana would
not be a gocd quarterback for the
Chiefs because:
(a) Has only won four Super Bowls,
the last one a whopping three years
ago.

(b) Would have to wear No. 17 — the
Chiefs retired No. 16, Len Dawson's
number.
(c) Could not make lucrative Hanes
underwear commercials in Kansas
City.
(d) Would make Chiefs unbeatable
on Nintendo's Tecmo Bowl.
(e) Half as many "good hair" days for
Jennifer in K.C.
(112) The Chiefs are happy with Steve
Deßerg's corpse at quarterback.
Try (g) None of the above.
My friend "John" and I were thrilled
with the news. "John" is a rabid KC
fan, but he and I promised to root for
whichever team Joe played for next
year. Sure, call us crazy, say that Joe's
washed up, say he'll get injured run
ning on the field for spring training.
We believe.
Joe has something the years will
never take away. He's a football quar
terback, he belongs on the football
field. When Montana trots onto the
green rug at Arrowhead Stadium this
season, he'll be The Kid again. No more
quarterback controversy. No more cyn
ical San Francisco fans. No more trade
rumors. Joe will go out like a champion
should — playing the game.
I know I'll be cheering.

an offer from the Stanford Review. Not.
