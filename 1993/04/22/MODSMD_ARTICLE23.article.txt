In an average performance, the
Stanford women's golf team finished
tied for fourth place with a team score
of 934 strokes at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, held at Walla
Walla Country Club in Washington.
Arizona State won the tournament
with a cumulative score of 905, UCLA
and USC followed with scores of 921
and 930, and Oregon came away tied
with Stanford.
The leading individual scorer was
Wendy Ward from Arizona State (69-
75-74), who shot a 2-over-par 218 for
the tournament. The Cardinal was led
by senior captain Martha Richards
(77-75-77), who finished tied for sev
enth individually, in a field of 50 play
ers. Other Stanford representatives
included Vicky Strada (81-75-77,
15th), junior Melinda Daniels (78-78-
79, 18th), sophomore Jamille Jose (82-
80-75, 24th) and freshman Julie
Bowen (84-85-82, 39th). Strada's 15th
place finish was her best individual
performance this season.
The Cardinal initially fell to sixth
place during the first round, due to
excellent individual and team perfor
mances by Arizona State and UCLA.
After the first round, Arizona State
held the lead with a torrid cumulative
score of 299. Sun Devil Ward led the
way with a tbree-under-par 69. UCLA

was second with a 300, while Oregon,
Oregon State and USC were tied for
third with 314. Stanford held its sixth
place spot with a 318, then advanced
to fourth place with a 308 during the
second round of play.
"It was a tough first day," noted
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin. "I
thought we were average. But I have
to say that this course is very difficult.
Both ASU and UCLA shot the lights
out. Wendy Ward's 69 might have been
the best collegiate round of golf any
where since Vicky Goetze shot a 65 at
[ASU's] Karsten Course last May. This
course is that tough."
Richards stood at eighth place indi
vidually after the first day with a five
over-par 77. "This is a great course, "
Richards said. "There were some
tough pin placements, but all in all the
course was in perfect shape and it's
providing us with a good test."
Richards improved to a seventh
place tie with a 75 on the second day,
eight strokes behind leader Wendy
Ward, and held that position with a 77
during the third round.
Next up for the Cardinal is the Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate Invitational,
held at Stanford Golf Course May 1
and 2. This home tournament will be
the final regular-season date for the
Cardinal squad before it heads to Tuc
son, Ariz., and Athens, Ga., for the
West Regionals and the NCAA Cham
pionships.
