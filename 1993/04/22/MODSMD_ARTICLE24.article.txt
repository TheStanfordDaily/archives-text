# Men's and women's tennis to play in individual Pac-10 tournament
## Men look to repeat last year's wins 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
If the past is any indication,
Stanford's men's tennis team
should be smashingly successful
this weekend at the Pacific 10
Conference Individual Champi
onships, which will be held in Ojai,
Calif. Last year, Stanford players
captured the singles and doubles
titles in both the Championship
tournament (for players ranked
No. 1 through No. 5 on their
teams) and the Invitational tour
nament (for No. 6 through No. 8
players).
Currently, the No. 8-ranked
Cardinal (17-4 overall) is coming
off a string of successful, but gru
eling dual matches, giving the
players a reason to look forward to
tournament play. "Ojai will be a
nice change of pace after so many
team matches," said junior
Michael Flanagan, who is ranked
seventh nationally. "It's a nice,
relaxed atmosphere and everyone
has a good time."
Flanagan, who has taken over
Stanford's No. 1 spot since Alex
O'Brien graduated last year, will
have big shoes to fill this weekend.
O'Brien, the defending NCAA sin
gles and doubles champion, was
also a two-time singles and two
time doubles champion at Ojai.
Last year O'Brien paired up
with Chris Cocotos to capture the
doubles titles at both the NCAAs
and the Pac-10 Championships.
This year, the No. 27 doubles tan

dem of Flanagan and Cocotos
have paired up to defeat tough
opponents like USC's Brian Mac-
Phie and Jon Leach (1-6, 7-6, 6-4),
who have played together for
three years and are consistently
ranked one of the top doubles
teams in the nation.
Aside from Flanagan and Coco
tos, the Cardinal will be represent
ed in the Championship tourna
ment by No. 25 Robert Devens, No.
62 Vimal Patel and freshman Jeff
Salzenstein. Patel and Devens will
team up in doubles, as will Salzen
stein and classmate Jim Thomas.
In the Invitational tourna
ment, the Cardinal also has a few
titles to recapture. Last year,
graduate Jason Yee won the sin
gles tourney while Roman Sydo
rak and Billy Wright captured the
doubles crown.
Wright, paired up with fresh
man Ricky Becker this year, will
be looking for a second doubles
title. Wright, Becker and Thomas
will also compete in the Invita
tional singles draw.
This weekend, the primary goal
for the Cardinal is to stay healthy.
"That is the most important thing
right now," Devens said. "We
want to come out iiyury-free."
Devens also felt that this week
end offers teams a chance to see
their competition in action. "We
need to keep the momentum going
on through this weekend," he
said. "We need to create a feeling
in their minds like, 'Uh-oh, here
comes Stanford!' "
