# Women plagued by injuries

### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
After a hectic, injury-filled 1993 regular season, all
this team wants to do is get away and relax.
Which is exactly what it's going to do.
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team (23-2,
9-1 Pacific 10 Conference South) will travel to
Ojai, Calif., today to play in the 94th Annual Pacif
ic 10 Championships. Several Cardinal players will
be looking to fine-tune their individual games
before the NCAA Championships, held May 12
through 20 in Gainesville, Fla. The last time Stan
ford's players traveled to Florida this season, they
came away 5-1 losers to the defending-national
champion Gators.
"We're a much different team than the one we took
to Florida (one month ago)," said coach Frank Bren
nan. "We've come a long way â€” we've gotten tougher
and showed grit and determination."
Brennan sees the Ojai tournament as a proving
ground for an injury-ravaged Stanford squad, as
sophomore Amy Chiminello and junior Emma Wood
house, the Cardinal's No. 6 and 7 players, will join No.
2 Heather Willens, No. 4 Kristine Kurth, and No. 5
Beth Berris in the Women's Championship Tourna
ment. Stanford's No. 1 and No. 3 players, junior
Laxmi Poruri and redshirt freshman Kim Shasby, will
remain home to nurse injuries and prepare for
Gainesville.
"If someone had told me that we would lose our No.
1 player for the L.A. matches, lose our No. 3 player for
the last part of the season, and lose our No. 6 for two
or three matches, I'd have guessed we might win half
our matches," Brennan said. "As it turns out, we have
won six out of seven, which is incredible."
The Cardinal will also send freshmen Wendy Sacks
and Sonya Cotero to compete in the Women's Invita
tional Tournament, which is reserved for players not
participating in the Championships. Cotero played in
the high-school division of the Ojai tournament last
year.
