# Gay students converge on capital
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
As the nation's capital gears up to
welcome an estimated 1 million support
ers of gay and lesbian rights, members of
the Stanford community are preparing
to make their voices heard at Sunday's
march on Washington.
Between 80 and 100 students, faculty
and staff members are expected to par
ticipate in the march, said campus
march coordinator Rosa de la Vega.

Many feel that the march could not
come at a more pivotal moment in the
history of gay, lesbian and bisexual
rights.
"I feel the gay community is at a criti
cal juncture," said Karl Knapper, pro
gram director for the Martin Luther
King Papers Project, who plans to
march. "We've recently become the
focus of Christian and conservative
right-wing groups who are trying to strip
away all that we've accomplished."
Junior Rachel Maddow, who will also

go to Washington, said that develop
ments like the recent Colorado amend
ment repealing gay-rights legislation
make the march even more momentous.
"This is a pretty crucial time in the
history of gay rights," Maddow said.
"Are we going to stand up and fight or
are we going to be pushed farther into
the closet?"
Washington is no stranger to crowds,
but the capital's hotels have never been
fuller, and major airlines have
had to add trips to the city, said
Stanford alumni Michael Goff,
editor of Out magazine.
"At the very least, we're going
to have one hell of a terrific week
end in Washington," Goff said.
Several students are planning
to meet under a Stanford banner
when they attend a student con
ference Saturday, senior John
Newsome said.
Another of the weekend's
highlights is a special event spon
sored by the Names Project, the
organization responsible for the
creation of the AIDS quilt.
Junior Benjamin Morgan, who
stopped out last quarter to work
as an intern for the project, said
that since the Washington site
had room for only 2,000 of the
quilt's 22,000 panels, organizers
have opted for a more creative
method of display.

"It was impossible to decide
which of the 2,000 panels to dis
play," Morgan said. "We are ask
ing people to bring new panels
with them and we'll be laying
them down on signature squares
people have previously written
on."
After registering, supporters
will be able to pin their panels
directly onto the new quilt, Mor
gan said.
"It should be a really moving
experience — I'm excited," Mor
gan said.
While many who will be
attending the march share this
same excitement, others face
more personal issues.
For Newsome, going back to
his hometown as a march partici
pant has raised feelings of appre
hension and fear.
"It's just something I have to
do," Newsome said. "It's a time
for me to go home and claim my
identity. In a way I think it will be
my first real homecoming."
While Newsome struggles to
overcome fears about home, he

also worries about misconcep
tions surrounding the gay, les
bian and bisexual community.
"I've just been sick about the
recent .. . flawed, poorly
researched study that only 1 per
cent of the male population is
gay," Newsome said. "It's almost
tragic that such false information
should come out right at this
point."
A nationwide survey on male
sexual behavior, published last
week, concluded that a 1948
study which reported that 10 per
cent of all males are gay was dra
matically high. Since the recent
study was based solely on face-to
face interviews, its results have
been questioned.
"But I'm grateful that this
came out at a time when we
queer people are involving our
selves and claiming membership
in such a public way," Newsome
added.
Participation in last year's pro
choice rally in Washington moti
vated senior Tiffany Neill and
sophomore Frank Salisbury to

attend this weekend's march.
"I was at the pro-choice march
last spring," Salisbury said, "and
it was an incredible feeling to see
700,000 people come together on
the same issue. And now here it is
my turn, my big issue — gay
rights — and I want to be part of
it."
"I felt like it really did some
good — not so much politically
but for people who are involved in
the cause," Neill said of last
year's rally. "It really boosted
morale and was very affirming."
Though Stanford's partici
pants are bringing different goals
to Washington, all share a sense
of the march's historic signifi
cance.
"I think a lot of people are
going into this thinking that this
is going to be one of the most
empowering and significant
moments of their life," Knapper
said.
Maddow, too, seems to have
captured this spirit.
"It's history, and I want to be
part of it," she said.
