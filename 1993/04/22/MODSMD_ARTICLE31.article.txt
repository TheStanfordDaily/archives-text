## Deconstructing media biases 
### 
TWO WEEKS AGO we promised our
selves we'd take a few moments to com
pletely disrespect the Deke "Rasta
Bash."
Their flier depicted a rude-boy totally
decked-out, guns blaring — maybe he was
doing "The Bogle," or maybe he was doing
the gangsta thing for real.
First off, Inka-Inka are as white as Pete
Hyuck's ass—another favored image of Deke

sophistication. Secondly,
Inka-Inka's largest audience
consists of pre-pubescent Paly
kids and their moms.
Let's be real. It's not that
Inka-Inka aren't reggae. It's

that they're not rude-boys.
Rude-boy possees are essentially gangs
steeped in a culture of violence, especially
open harassment of gays and lesbians.
Why should something as seemingly triv
ial as fliers for another weekend of generic
phrat parties matter?
The Dekes have no problem associating
mall-roots reggae with certain segments of
Dancehall reggae.
They have no problems simply lumping all
reggae into one semiotic capsule, despite the
abounding contradictions. The flier is kind of
like using Native-American stereotypes as
sports-team mascots.
America insists on casual, to the point of
callous attitudes towards the cultural images
it juxtaposes, unwilling to see the contexts
underlying the construction of these images
— like the jurors in Simi Valley unwilling to
treat "Gorillas In The Mist" as racist when
used by officers describing a domestic dispute
between two African-Americans.
We refuse to call that trial, "The Rodney
King Trial" because Rodney King wasn't on
trial.
Let's CBS Chalkboard™ the concept: "The
Amy Jo Fisher Trial" was called "The Amy Jo
Fisher Trial" because Amy Jo Fisher was on
trial. "The Jeffery Dahmer Trial" was called
"The Jeffery Dahmer Trial" because Jeffery

Pat Dote
Jim Haljun

Dahmer was on trial. And because Jeffery
Dahmer and Amy Jo Fisher were guilty, we
feel calling it"The Rodney King Trial" shifts
focus and places blame.
The verdict as revealed in Saturday's sec
ond trial showed that in addition to any offi
cers found guilty, the entire American system
is guilty for allowing urban problems to
blow-up to such levels of violence, insensitiv
ity and injustice.

Arid when the entire Amer
ican system perpetuates root
level inequality, there really
isn't room to focus on why re
leasing Madonna's, Prince's
and Garth Brooks' latest re
leases with 30 percent increas-

es in profit margins firmly nails mass music as
nothing more than pre-fab algorithms of per
sonality-cult glitz.
Kwame Anku's column last week urged
people to write-in supporting his views about
the photo essay on East Palo Alto which ap
peared in The Daily. We feel the decision to
run this piece as the trial went to jury showed
an insensitivity toward cultural realities.
"Night And Day" is kind of like The New
York Times running "Children Of The Shad
ows" these past two weeks. It's a series on
struggling urban youth who know nothing
other than a world of drug dealers and dys
functional families.
Both pieces lack any effort to find people
such as a recent "Rising Star" named by the
Golden State Warriors — a teenager who
stopped selling drugs to start legitimate work
and to start appyling himself as an A student.
Both pieces lack any contexual analysis of
what makes a place such as East Palo Alto.
Perhaps this information is missing because
it is too close to readers' and reporters'
homes. Because any history of East Palo Alto
is also a history of Stanford University at its
most uncaring and unjust.
As humans, these are the in sensitivities we
must guard against, especially when there is
no videotape. ■
