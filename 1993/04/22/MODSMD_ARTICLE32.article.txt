## On bullfights and Victoria's Secret 
### 
Deep down, you love Hemingway. Oh
sure, you chime in with everyone else
in discussion section and denounce
his work as misogynistic, self-important and
overrated, but you can't deny that it speaks
to that squalid den of testosterone and self
pity deep inside you — the place you drift off
to while munching Doritos and watching
basketball with glazed eyes.
That is, if you're a man. If you're a woman,

you probably think all that
tough monosyllabic dialogue
is just macho bullshit, and it
would be hard to prove you
wrong.

The problem is that Hemingway, and all
of the male writers after him who've really
tapped into the depths of the male psyche,
seem to stop there. The female characters in
their books are invariably shadowy carica
tures who exist only to serve as foils to their
swarthy heroes, two-dimensional represen
tations of either male fantasies or some reac
tionary notion of feminine villainy.
And so otherwise-enlightened men con
sign Hemingway, along with Raymond
Chandler, the Three Stooges and David
Mamet films, to the realm of secret vices like
drug addictions or purloined "Victoria's Se
cret" catalogs, afraid to praise them even in
the presence of other men, lest they be over
heard by some disloyal traitor to the gender
— some guy who actually liked "Wuthering
Heights" in high school.
The whole situation is pretty unfortu
nate, especially when you realize that litera
ture should be a perfect forum for a public
dialogue between men and women. Even in
this post-feminist era, male authors just
haven't been able to reinterpret all of that
whiskey-swilling, bull-fighting machismo
into anything thoughtful or equivocal
enough to stand by it and say "Here, this is
how we feel."
Instead, the tough guys just keep coming.
Mark Leyner's steroid-inflated persona in
"Et Tu, Babe" swaggers from one sexual en-

Ted Quinn

counter to another while single-handedly
subduing all threats to his cool superiority,
and the embittered ex-husband cop who
narrates T. R. Pearson's novel "Cry Me a
River" is worthy of any Hemingway novel.
With their keen sense of the male psyche,
authors like these are in a unique position to
create a male perspective on the gender gap,
but because they don't seem to make any more
effort to understand women than their char-

acters do, they are unable to
ask the really hard questions
about how all of this machis
mo operates in real world re
lationships.

Of course, there are plenty of male au
thors who try to write about relationships
equivocally, but for some reason they end up
suppressing their sexuality to such an extent
that they end up with a picturesque postcard
of a relationship they probably saw on some
TV show 01 read about in a sociology text
book.
It's hard to see why this dichotomy exists.
Self-appointed crusaders against "political
correctness" cite the feminist movement as
having a chilling effect on artistic expres
sions of male sexuality, but it just doesn't
ring true.
Women who are offering the female per
spective on these issues seem to be making a
genuine effort to understand men — recent
examples include Terry McMillan's novels
and Nora Ephron's screenplay for "When
Harry Met Sally." Ephron managed to make
Harry a vehicle for many of womankind's
grievances against men and yet created a
character that most men identified with.
So far, though, this dialogue appears to be
a monologue as Hemingway's successors
continue to toss back their scotch and shake
their heads uncomprehendingly at women.
As long as they do, they will continue to dis
qualify themselves from a forum where their
input is badly needed.
For now, just pass the Doritos. I think the
Lakers are playing on channel 4. ■
