# a 						few (brief) words with: RAGE against the machine
## 
### Josh Walker 
Rage Against The Machine is
pissed off. A lot of things
— ignorance, fear, racism,
illegitimate power, education —
tick them off, and it more than
comes across in their music. Vo
cals range from rap-like chants to
howls of pain laid over heavy
drums, throbbing bass and
torqued guitar. Their sound, in a
word: "intense."
Somewhere behind tour-bus
tinted windows lays the band that
has been labeled everything from
"original and virtuosic" to recy
clers of "the usual asshole-rock
catalog of third-generation
Sab/Zep/Golden."
Minutes passed, and three re
ally big, ugly guys in red jackets let
three other writers and me into a
ragged doorway. Three hours

from now I would be in the audi
ence somewhere, sucking in sec
ond-hand smoke, dodging goa
tee-sporting rap heads trying to
figure out if Rage was legit or just
another loud-mouthed, pseudo
political, burnt-out thrash band.
Having started out playing
parties in L.A., Rage is just com
pleting eight months on the road
with hard-core band Wool and
Irish-American/Notre Dame/-
Boston Celtics-promoting rap
pers House of Pain.
After playing with Body
Count, Public Enemy, Pearl Jam,
Suicidal Tendencies and now
House of Pain, as well as benefit
shows for Rock for Choice, Rage
has earned a grass-roots follow

ing that's about to turn into a
public park. And all this without
MTV (their first video was
banned by the FCC... 16 "fuck
you's" in a row will do that to
you), and with extremely limited
radio air time.
"If a year ago you would have
asked me what I am going to be
doing next year, it wouldn't have
been going to Europe and doing
Lollapalooza," says drummer
Brad Wilk, hands on his prickly
head. "It's pretty shocking how
everything has gone so — whoa
— everything's just happened so
fast! It's almost kind of scary.... I
don't want things to happen too
fast because then people forget
about you real quick. I just want a
real organic and natural growth."
This is coming from a band

with one of the most disturbing
photos ever to be placed on an
album cover: a shot of a Buddhist
monk burning himself to death in
protest of the Vietnam war. Are
they merely shock artists, or do
they mean it?
The lyrics could, perhaps, be
convincing on their own:
"Yes I know my enemies/
They're the teachers who taught
me to fight me/ Compromise,
conformity, assimilation, sub
mission/ Ignorance, hypocrisy,
brutality, the elite/ All of which
are American dreams" shouts out
"Know Your Enemy."
"Bullet in Ya Head," one of
the band's earliest songs, says,
"No escape from the mass mind

rape/ Play it again Jack and then
rewind the tape/ Play it again and
again and again/ Until ya mind is
locked in/ Believin' all the lies that
they're tellin ya/ Buying all the
products that they're sellin' ya/
They say jump/ Ya say how high/
Ya brain dead/ Ya gotta fuckin'
bullet in ya head."
Behind a chorus equating
South Central Los Angeles and
South Africa, "Township Rebel
lion" ends with "Why stand/ On a
silent platform/ Fight the war/
Fuck the norm "
"We pound things into peo
ple's heads because obviously
people aren't getting the mes
sage," says Wilk. "If you can say it
one time then say it a fucking
100,000 times, until people real
ize what's going on.

"People might get off [on our
first record] because of the music
or because they just hear 'Fuck
you, I won't do what you tell me.'.
.. If it at least makes them think a
little bit, makes them question
right or wrong, makes them ques
tion their basic assumptions that
they have, then I think it's a good
start, a really good start.
"I don't think you can start a
revolution from one record. But
you can start a process. You can
make people more aware and you
can get people to seek sources of
information other than MTV or
the news, which are run by big
corporations. You got to realize
that that's where the news is com
ing from, CNN included. You got

to realize that our democratic
party is basically now run by big
business, also."
Their concert echoes these
same ideas.
Lead singer Zach de la Rocha
pauses for a word between
songs. He dedicates "Bullet
in Ya Head" to the innocent dead
in the Persian Gulf War. He gives a
history lesson on the origins of rev
olutionary groups in Central and
South America.
He speaks long and in-depth
about the booths in the lobby, one
for an anti-censorship group, one
for AIDS awareness and one for
the American Indian Movement.
People in the audience yell at him
to shut up and keep playing. De la
Rocha stares them down, tells
them to "fuck off" and keeps

going.
"Some of you
people came
here tonight to
be entertained.
Well I'm fuck
ing tired of
being enter
tained! Its bull
shit!" he yells,
then the band
busts into song.
De la
Rocha throws

himself all
over the stage, leaping into the air
and shaking his dreadlocked
head. Part-way through the
opening song, a scuffle breaks out
between security guards and the
audience. Bassist Timmy C. and
Wilk jump down into the crowd
to break it up. With the help of
stage crew and House of Pain's
lead rapper Everlast, they emerge
moments later, shirts shredded.
A record rep tells me that a
kid was killed at a concert earlier
in the tour.
A minute later it's as if the in
cident never occurred. Sweat
gleams off of the tattoos of the
now bare-chested band members
who continue to cavort on stage
until the feedback from Rage's

final song fades and the house
lights click on.

"It's really hard sometimes
[to keep the intensity]," Wilk said
back during the interview, prop
ping his feet up on the coffee
table. "You feel like you're whor
ing yourself when you start doing
it every night — you're not 100
percent into it and yet you still
have to go out there, because you
have an obligation."
He turned to Vinnie. "Re
gardless of what [people] think,
it's a job. Just like your job is hold
ing that thing there," he mo
tioned to the tape recorder, "and
doing this interview."
Fortunately, the band no
longer has to worry about the or
ganizational details of full-time
touring and drumming up record
sales. Epic, a division of Sony and
Rage's label, now handles the
grunt work. According to Wilk,
any deal with a major label rather
than an independent label raises
questions about credibility.
"I don't feel bad about this
record selling 3 million records if
it does, because I think... there's
a message there. I think people
have a lot to learn from it,"he
said. "If 3 million kids are going
to buy this record instead of Poi
son's record, so be it.
"As long as it's honest and
natural and not hyped by Sony
records," he laughed, directing
his comments towards the two
Sony reps who were sitting be
hind me in the room.
Cutting through the hype of
becoming a big band and playing
through the tour seems to be what
weighs most on Rage's mind.
"I want to do this tour and play
for people and communicate to as
many people as possible," he said.
"Then I want to go in and make a
record that has nothing to do with
this record. I just want to grow." ■

gardless of what [people] think,
it's a job. Just like your job is hold
ing that thing there," he mo
tioned to the tape recorder, "and
doing this interview."
Fortunately, the band no
longer has to worry about the or
ganizational details of full-time
touring and drumming up record
sales. Epic, a division of Sony and
Rage's label, now handles the
grunt work. According to Wilk,
any deal with a major label rather
than an independent label raises
questions about credibility.
"I don't feel bad about this
record selling 3 million records if
it does, because I think... there's
a message there. I think people
have a lot to learn from it,"he
said. "If 3 million kids are going
to buy this record instead of Poi
son's record, so be it.
"As long as it's honest and
natural and not hyped by Sony
records," he laughed, directing
his comments towards the two
Sony reps who were sitting be
hind me in the room.
Cutting through the hype of
becoming a big band and playing
through the tour seems to be what
weighs most on Rage's mind.
"I want to do this tour and play
for people and communicate to as
many people as possible," he said.
"Then I want to go in and make a
record that has nothing to do with
this record. I just want to grow." ■


The date: 4/14/93.
The destination:
The Warfield, San
Francisco.
The mission:
Interview Rage
Against The Machine
— four Los Angeles
punks with baggy
shorts and a knack
for saying "fuck you."
Rage Against The Machine is
pissed off. A lot of things
— ignorance, fear, racism,
illegitimate power, education —
tick them off, and it more than
comes across in their music. Vo
cals range from rap-like chants to
howls of pain laid over heavy
drums, throbbing bass and
torqued guitar. Their sound, in a
word: "intense."
Somewhere behind tour-bus
tinted windows lays the band that
has been labeled everything from
"original and virtuosic" to recy
clers of "the usual asshole-rock
catalog of third-generation
Sab/Zep/Golden."
Minutes passed, and three re
ally big, ugly guys in red jackets let
three other writers and me into a
ragged doorway. Three hours

from now I would be in the audi
ence somewhere, sucking in sec
ond-hand smoke, dodging goa
tee-sporting rap heads trying to
figure out if Rage was legit or just
another loud-mouthed, pseudo
political, burnt-out thrash band.
Having started out playing
parties in L.A., Rage is just com
pleting eight months on the road
with hard-core band Wool and
Irish-American/Notre Dame/-
Boston Celtics-promoting rap
pers House of Pain.
After playing with Body
Count, Public Enemy, Pearl Jam,
Suicidal Tendencies and now
House of Pain, as well as benefit
shows for Rock for Choice, Rage
has earned a grass-roots follow

ing that's about to turn into a
public park. And all this without
MTV (their first video was
banned by the FCC... 16 "fuck
you's" in a row will do that to
you), and with extremely limited
radio air time.
"If a year ago you would have
asked me what I am going to be
doing next year, it wouldn't have
been going to Europe and doing
Lollapalooza," says drummer
Brad Wilk, hands on his prickly
head. "It's pretty shocking how
everything has gone so — whoa
— everything's just happened so
fast! It's almost kind of scary.... I
don't want things to happen too
fast because then people forget
about you real quick. I just want a
real organic and natural growth."
This is coming from a band

with one of the most disturbing
photos ever to be placed on an
album cover: a shot of a Buddhist
monk burning himself to death in
protest of the Vietnam war. Are
they merely shock artists, or do
they mean it?
The lyrics could, perhaps, be
convincing on their own:
"Yes I know my enemies/
They're the teachers who taught
me to fight me/ Compromise,
conformity, assimilation, sub
mission/ Ignorance, hypocrisy,
brutality, the elite/ All of which
are American dreams" shouts out
"Know Your Enemy."
"Bullet in Ya Head," one of
the band's earliest songs, says,
"No escape from the mass mind

rape/ Play it again Jack and then
rewind the tape/ Play it again and
again and again/ Until ya mind is
locked in/ Believin' all the lies that
they're tellin ya/ Buying all the
products that they're sellin' ya/
They say jump/ Ya say how high/
Ya brain dead/ Ya gotta fuckin'
bullet in ya head."
Behind a chorus equating
South Central Los Angeles and
South Africa, "Township Rebel
lion" ends with "Why stand/ On a
silent platform/ Fight the war/
Fuck the norm "
"We pound things into peo
ple's heads because obviously
people aren't getting the mes
sage," says Wilk. "If you can say it
one time then say it a fucking
100,000 times, until people real
ize what's going on.

"People might get off [on our
first record] because of the music
or because they just hear 'Fuck
you, I won't do what you tell me.'.
.. If it at least makes them think a
little bit, makes them question
right or wrong, makes them ques
tion their basic assumptions that
they have, then I think it's a good
start, a really good start.
"I don't think you can start a
revolution from one record. But
you can start a process. You can
make people more aware and you
can get people to seek sources of
information other than MTV or
the news, which are run by big
corporations. You got to realize
that that's where the news is com
ing from, CNN included. You got

to realize that our democratic
party is basically now run by big
business, also."
Their concert echoes these
same ideas.
Lead singer Zach de la Rocha
pauses for a word between
songs. He dedicates "Bullet
in Ya Head" to the innocent dead
in the Persian Gulf War. He gives a
history lesson on the origins of rev
olutionary groups in Central and
South America.
He speaks long and in-depth
about the booths in the lobby, one
for an anti-censorship group, one
for AIDS awareness and one for
the American Indian Movement.
People in the audience yell at him
to shut up and keep playing. De la
Rocha stares them down, tells
them to "fuck off" and keeps

going.
"Some of you
people came
here tonight to
be entertained.
Well I'm fuck
ing tired of
being enter
tained! Its bull
shit!" he yells,
then the band
busts into song.
De la
Rocha throws

himself all
over the stage, leaping into the air
and shaking his dreadlocked
head. Part-way through the
opening song, a scuffle breaks out
between security guards and the
audience. Bassist Timmy C. and
Wilk jump down into the crowd
to break it up. With the help of
stage crew and House of Pain's
lead rapper Everlast, they emerge
moments later, shirts shredded.
A record rep tells me that a
kid was killed at a concert earlier
in the tour.
A minute later it's as if the in
cident never occurred. Sweat
gleams off of the tattoos of the
now bare-chested band members
who continue to cavort on stage
until the feedback from Rage's

final song fades and the house
lights click on.

"It's really hard sometimes
[to keep the intensity]," Wilk said
back during the interview, prop
ping his feet up on the coffee
table. "You feel like you're whor
ing yourself when you start doing
it every night — you're not 100
percent into it and yet you still
have to go out there, because you
have an obligation."
He turned to Vinnie. "Re
gardless of what [people] think,
it's a job. Just like your job is hold
ing that thing there," he mo
tioned to the tape recorder, "and
