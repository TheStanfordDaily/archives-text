Even the most stodgy
emeritus professor,
alone in his room
pondering the somber truths
of DNA or Greek art, must
cavort around in his under
wear like Tom Cruise when
Perry Como comes on the
radio.
We all love to sing, to
undulate, to vocalize shame
lessly in our showers, cars
and other enclosed spaces
that fortunately keep our
vibrating air molecules to
ourselves.
And now, with the help of
yet another wondrous inno
vation in Japanese technolo
gy, we can take the ultimate
step in venting our repressed
vocal desires. In front of a
crowd of total strangers, you
— yes, you — can belt out
the hits with the same
pounding intensity of Bono,
of Jimi Hendrix — and for
the truly superlative —
Tiffany.
It's karaoke, and while

often grouped with such zeniths of American
culture as "The Clapper" and Home
Shopping Network, karaoke has swept into
the bars and clubs of the Bay Area, even
sprouting into locales where hip college stu
dents dwell.
Quit your snickering and listen up.
There are some serious karaokers out
there, and they say that when you've done it
once, it's hard to stop going back. And why
wouldn't it be? Every song is identical to that
found on the album, minus lyrics, and boost
ed by DJ-quality hi-fi equipment. And with
the bright strobe lights and titillating videos
playing behind you on a wide screen TV, you

might start feeling like the real McCoy. And
most times it costs absolutely nothing to try.
Indeed, you can even palm some serious
contest cash for delivering that loving rendi
tion of "Welcome To The Jungle." But cast
aside these mercenary concerns and think on
these other possibilities: will you successfully
screech Wilson Pickett's "In the Midnight
Hour" and leave your date in thrall?
Will you and your three girlfriends be able
to do justice to Aretha Franklins "(You Make
Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman?" Can you
and your frat brothers adequately say to your
selves, after it's all sung and done, that you
performed "Girl You Know It's True" to a

level of which Milli Vanilli would take pride?
But for those of you still somewhat leery of
baring your romantic soul, we take you on a
voyage into several local karaoke dives so you
don't have to embarrass yourselves. We've
done that already.
Night and we're in Redwood City. It's
10:41 on a Friday evening, and
Charley Brown's is dosed for eats but
open for beats. Located snug on the Marina,
the nautical view may encourage thoughts of
a rapidly sinking ships as you croon into the
mike, but all true artists eliminate such self
immolating thoughts.

Like most places that offer karaoke, CB's
doesn't charge for crooning into the mike —
understandable, since few people pay for a
chance at self-humiliation — and no one asks
for ID unless you step up to the bar. You sim
ply write down your name and your selection
on a piece of paper, and hand it to the KJ, the
karaoke jockey. When your name is called, it's
showtime, folks.

A fortyish looking
man wearing shades
sings a song with the
line, 'Young girls,
they get so weary.'
I decide it's time
to leave.

Linda Hazle, a thirtysomething blond with
a nice smile who's been doing karaoke for
about three years, runs the technical side of
the show at "Live Star Tracks," the group that
operates the karaoke every Friday night at
Charley Brown's. "There's nothing to it but to
do it," she says. Hazle, who tends bar during
the day and has been around the country
doing karaoke professionally, says she
employs several methods to encourage people
to let their hair down.
"It's challenging to try and get people to
sing," she says. "Sometimes if no one is
singing, we'll sing with a cordless mike, and
we'll go around to people and have them sing
a few lines. They're comfortable and then
they'll think, 'Hey, I can do that.'"
Hazle turns around and gets to work. The
procedure runs as follows: would-be crooners
pick from a comprehensive play list that runs
from Sinead O'Connor's "Nothing Compares
2 U" and Soft Cell's "Tainted Love" to "My
Old Kentucky Home." "Live Star Tracks"
employs three TV screens, one a wide-screen,
all of which display the song's lyrics as the
music blares out from the speakers at full
intensity. The lyrics slowly colorize with a
soothing Pepto Bismol-like shade as the

screen tells you when exactly to sing.
Devastatingly foolproof.
In addition, the screens also feature a video,
sometimes MTV-like in quality, but often like
your Dad's home movie of his trip to the
Grand Canyon. Meanwhile, Hazle and Miguel
Guidos — the male half of "Live Star Tracks"

— act like everyone's groupie, get people
excited and make sure the music pounds out
with ear-splitting volume. Now it's up to you
to sing on key, on time and with some scrap of
self-confidence. It's just all too easy.
Gary Johnson, a muscular black gentleman
sporting a English cap, assumes the stage and
belts out a throaty baritone rendition of Lionel
Richie's "All Night Long," but he's like a Richie
transformed by massive testosterone supple
mentation. Johnson, 45, a self-employed elec
tronics technician and a veteran of several
karaoke venues, says that singing "gives me
pleasure." As for his mental preparation, he
says,"I just pretend I'm in the shower."
The crowd goes wild and whoops in
encouragement as Johnson cruises into the
infamous "Mumbo Jumbo" chorus of the
song. Johnson's good and he moves smoothly,
with the ease of a man who's been through
this before.
"We can make anyone sound really good,
no matter what they sound like," says Hazle,
confidently, as she rests her hand on the
expensive equipment before her. Of course,
she admits, it helps that the bar is nearby,
with the alcohol loosening tongues and
increasing aural pain thresholds as less-than
stellar performers take the stage. Her rash
boast, however, is soon put to the test.
Bob, 33, photocopies medical records and
has decided to go for Depeche Mode's "Policy
of Truth." Depeche Mode writhes on the wide
screen as Bob's voice booms out along with the
tinny guitar. He's no Bing Crosby, to be sure,
and this writer notices that unlike Gary, whose
rich voice could be heard clearly, Bob's stentori
an flatness sounds like it's coming out of a deep
pit. I don't complain, and no one else in the
audience does either. Hazle knows her karaoke.
Indeed, the audience at CB's loves Bob.
Everyone who takes the stage is encouraged by
howls and hoots of delight as bodies hit the
dance floor. Says Hazle: "Last week a girl took
her bra out and threw it at a guy who was
singing." His reaction? Like a true performer,
"he got into it and started twirling it around."
Bob, whose formal vocal training also con
sists of taking showers, sits with Gary at a
table adjacent to the karaoke box, and waxes
philosophical when asked about his first
karaoke experience. "I was just determined to,
in essence, face my fears, to meet people and
be social," he says. "I'm pretty shy and intro
verted. But people respect you for having
guts. It's an introduction from me to the
whole audience."
It's now around midnight, and I'm some
where between a Safeway and a dry
cleaners in a deserted, Burlingame mini
mall parking lot. Woodlake Joe's, which
advertises "Dinner served until 11:30," is a
dark place with red booths and pictures of
hoboes on the wall.
Above the bar there's a collection of Franklin
Mint statues, about 30 of them, of cowboys and
milkmaids, and on another wall there's a pic
ture of Jimmy, Dick, Ron and Gerald at the
White House, hoisting a drink to each other
and looking like they're ready to start
up a mean version of "I Didn't Mean
—— To Turn You On." I wonder if the photo
is autographed.
The KJs here are another male
female pair, known as Johnny Rockit and
Candy Wrapper. Johnny, dressed in a tuxedo
with a crimson-red jacket and slicked-back
hair, was a singer in a '50s band for several
years and has been a KJ for about six years.
Like the folks at "Live Star Tracks," much
of Johnny Rockit's work is assuaging the fears

of the terminally shy, and he's not afraid to
mince words. "Sometimes they really suck
and come up to me and say, 'That was good,
wasn't it?' and I've got to say, 'Yeah, it was
wonderful.' But it's a lot of fun."
The crowd at Woodlake Joe's is small, and
there isn't any room to dance, but the people,
mostly in the 30 to 40 range, do enjoy their
karaoke. Some guy belts out "Dream Lover,"
another croons "I'm Into Something Good."
"In January, 1993, none of these people
would sing," claims Johnny. "We would do
most of the singing." If Johnny Rockit's right,
then he's done some impressive work.
Another 40ish looking man wearing shades
sings a song with the line, "Young girls, they
get so weary." I decide it's time to leave.
Located a few steps from San Jose State
University, San Jose Live is a bi-level
behemoth of a bar that boasts a basket
ball court, a dozen pool tables, a video arcade,
two dance floors and karaoke singing
Thursday night.
The crowd is young, hip, over 21 and
predatory, so grip your Mace and deliver your
best George Michael impersonation of "I
Want Your Sex" or Madonna's "Like A
Virgin." A crowd response is guaranteed,
especially if you sport a gluteal-length mini
skirt or tank top.
Sarti's, which bills itself as the best karaoke
bar in the South Bay and resembles a refur
bished Denny's, caters to a more mellow,
Filipino crowd that likes to warble tunes like
"Love Me Tender" and"The Rose." Singing tal
ent, however, definitely extends beyond the
amateur, but there's not much room for shak
ing your rear, and most of the audience, though
appreciative, isn't the most raucous I've seen.
On this sojourn I'm accompanied by three
Stanford undergraduate women willing to lay
their egos on the line and try karaoke for the
first time. I\vo have extensive singing experi
ence. The other one doesn't, but has had sev
eral beers. They're intimidated because the
last three singers have been really good. After
a another few rounds to calm their nerves, the
three ladies (who choose to remain nameless)
attempt a version of "Twist and Shout" to the

delight of the crowd, which has heard only
slow ballads the entire night.
"It's an amazing adrenaline rush," says one
of them. With some sense of relief, another
says: "You can't really hear what's going on.
You just sing."
After their giddy realization that they have
just walked in front of a crowd of total
strangers and sung "Shake it up, baby" several
times, the three ladies decide it's time to
quickly leave. During the drive back to Palo
Alto, however, they discuss plans to try
karaoke again. And perhaps even enter one of
those $100-prize contests.
Once again, a few more have become drawn
into the world of karaoke. And if you manage
to work up the nerve to shake that thing and
belt out a tune, you may not mind hanging
around for a while either. At least for an
encore. ■
