Hot actor Snipes
can't heat up this
lukewarm picture

Boiling Point

Imagine a movie about counterfeiters, cops
and call girls. Imagine a movie which manages
to perpetuate every conceivable stereotype
about the stupidity of women. Imagine a plot
less action movie which leaves its audience
yawning.
Now you don't have to see "Boiling Point"
Wesley Snipes stars as Jimmy Mercer, an
LA cop trying to bust two counterfeiters who
killed his partner. He has no evidence, but that
doesn't stop him from uncovering a series of
unbelievable coincidences that put him hot on
the killers' trail.
Mercer's target is Red Diamond (Dennis
Hopper), a con who owes the Mob 50 grand. He
and his partner Ronnie (Viggo Mortenson)
spend a week pulling off heist after heist to raise
the money, shooting everyone in their way.
Hopper gives an amazingly wooden perfor
mance — the only part of him that acts is his
hands. Maybe he's trying to parody George
Bush. Most of his dialogue consists of inter
minable pseudo-Mamet musings about busi
ness. Pass the popcorn, please.
What the movie lacks most is suspense, a
major flaw in a thriller. The audience knows
who the killers are, knows why and how they
kill. There are no high-speed chases or magnif
icent shootouts, only leisurely tailings through
beautiful downtown LA The violence in the
movie is the gratuitous kind — Ronnie shoots
one ofhis victims in the head with a sawed-off
shotgun, then smilingly runs his car over the
body.
If this weren't enough to offend moviegoers,
there are a series of boring and unrelated side
plots. Wesley has an ex-wife and kid. Why? His
current lover is a high-class hooker (Lolita Davi
dovich). Perhaps if she were as sexy as her name,
the audience might not wonder why a cop would
keep that kind of company.
Speaking of women, director James B. Har
ris does everything in his power to degrade the
women in the film. Take Connie, the drug ad
dict, whose husband calls her a "dumb junkie
bitch." She commits suicide by blowing up her
kitchen, where the movie suggests she belongs.

Red's wife continually takes him back, be
lieving all ofhis pathetic lies. And when Ronnie's
lover throws him out he slaps her, saying,
"That's not what you really want," then pins her
to the walL She finally sees the movie's warped
reasoning, and kisses him. Really, this movie is
an embarrassment to the '90s.
It's also a recipe for failure — start with a
boring plot, stir in mediocre acting and pepper
with degrading images. Audiences should put
the lid on "Boiling Point," turn off the stove
and forget it's even there.

Family squabble
turns ugly in new
Australian import

The Last Days of Chez Nous

"The Last Days of Chez Nous" is a unique
movie about a unique group of people. Set to
a jazz beat as mournful as it is exuberant, this
Australian import quietly celebrates family
and femininity.
Beth (Lisa Harrow), a writer, presides over
Chez Nous — a rambling Sydney cottage
housing her teenage daughter, her second
husband, her twentysomething sister, Vicki
(Kerry Fox), and their nerdy boarder.
Her husband J.P. (Bruno Ganz) is a French
man whose Old World sensibilities can't accom
modate all these independent women. "What
the hell am I doing here?" he asks himself. We
share his sense of powerlessness, thanks to force
ful performances from Harrow and Fox.
Vicki has just returned from Italy, seeking
refuge from a bad love affair. But you'd never

know it to look at her—beautiful and nervy,
she presents just the kind of threat that J.P. is
least prepared to handle.
Despite her strength, Vicki's completely
dependent on her big sister. She needs Beth's
guidance but resents her ability to provide it.
Meanwhile, Beth chafes at her role as moth
er to both her husband and sister. She's got
her own child and her own problems.
Director Gillian Armstrong, who success
fully handled a similar subject in "My Bril
liant Career," shows the neuroses, not the
mechanics of Beth's literary career.
Between J.P.'s indifference and her elderly
father's emotional abuse, Beth seeks to es
cape through her writing. She finally flees to
the stark outback with the old man, deter
mined to "settle" their unnamed conflicts.
When she calls home from a remote motel,
we see her coins stacked by denomination
atop the pay phone.
Ironically, as in Vicki's case, it's not the
trip, but the return home that destroys Beth.
Back at Chez Nous, everything has changed
— for better and for worse.
Chez Nous itself is a vivid character.
Graceful and unassuming on the outside, it
proves as full of subtle intricacies and shock
ingly incongruous colors as everything else
in the movie.
The cramped environs of Chez Nous
make for plenty of ominous angular shots
and spatial tensions. Armstrong indulges in
only one panoramic cityscape of Sydney
Harbor, saving her money shots for the end
less red deserts of the New South Wales out
back.
Even without the accents and red deserts,
you would know this is an Australian film. Fea
turing not one, but three strong women, and
written and directed by two more, "Chez Nous"
could never have been made in Hollywood.
If the movie has a flaw, it's that Arm

strong juxtaposes too many Big Issues with
moments of pure silliness. Her characters
go from dancing maniacally around the
house to musing philosophically on the af
terlife.
But "Chez Nous" achieves an offbeat kind
of balance nonetheless, successfully tran
scending the usual if-you-love-someone
set-them-free formula.

'60s nostalgia trip
takes us back to
Whitebread, USA

The Sandlot

Remember that suburban favorite, the "ABC.
After School Special?" If you long to return to
those days of agonizing drama—ranging from
the trauma of being the new fifth grader in
Whitebread, U.SA, to searching for lost pets
with names like "Rocky"—then "The Sandlot"
will be a refreshingly nostalgic road trip.
But the weak dialogue, less-than-sponta
neous acting and uninspired direction may
make you come to the grim realization that
your childhood days are over.
Scott Smalls, who narrates the film in his
adult form, A la "The Wonder Years" and
"Stand by Me," is the new fifth grader in 1962
Los Angeles. A paradigmatic geek, when chal
lenged with, "I bet you got all As this year," he
responds with, "Well, I got one A —, but it
should've been a B."
After displaying his woeful catching and
throwing skills, Scott tries to join a group of
local boys who play baseball like nobody's busi
ness. "Don't be a goofus," he chants to himself,
mantra-like, as he tries to play ball with them.
Of course, he Ms at first, but that's just the be
ginning of his summer of adventure.
The film, directed and written by David
Mickey Evans, continues in a jaunty, carefree
way, lifting dreamy sequences from "Field of
Dreams" and slow-motion lyricism from"The
Natural" Evans also tries to weave in pre-pu
bescent white-boy activities, whose cliches
squeeze a few laughs out of the audience. James
Earl Jones — who seems to enjoy starring in
semi-supernatural sports films and yapping
about why baseball is so great — appears as a
crotchety old man with a big junkyard dog.
Unfortunately, "The Sandlot" is all sugar
and very little spice, recalling the gritty realism
of "Encyclopedia Brown." Evans' attempt to
work Spielbergian magic frequently fizzles, and
he fails to coax believable performances from
the actors. And in another example of '90s po
litical sensibilities seeping into collective mem
ory, he features Latino and black kids playing
blissfully in 1960s white suburbia. Which one
of these does not belong?
"The Sandlot" does provide some genuine
laughs, but the jokes aren't very clever or
unique. Somebody barfs, so you laugh. The
narrator says of his fifth grade compatriot: "He
kissed a woman and he kissed her long and
good," so you laugh.
Most kids will probably enjoy the escapades
of the sandlot boys, but then again, most kids
can eat jellybeans for two hours and not feel ill.
You won't feel ill at the end of "The Sandlot,"
which tries to manufacture those happy days of
youth. But you won't feel very fed, either.

'60s nostalgia trip
takes us back to
Whitebread, USA

The Sandlot

Remember that suburban favorite, the "ABC.
After School Special?" If you long to return to
those days of agonizing drama—ranging from
the trauma of being the new fifth grader in
Whitebread, U.SA, to searching for lost pets
with names like "Rocky"—then "The Sandlot"
will be a refreshingly nostalgic road trip.
But the weak dialogue, less-than-sponta
neous acting and uninspired direction may
make you come to the grim realization that
your childhood days are over.
Scott Smalls, who narrates the film in his
adult form, A la "The Wonder Years" and
"Stand by Me," is the new fifth grader in 1962
Los Angeles. A paradigmatic geek, when chal
lenged with, "I bet you got all As this year," he
responds with, "Well, I got one A —, but it
should've been a B."
After displaying his woeful catching and
throwing skills, Scott tries to join a group of
local boys who play baseball like nobody's busi
ness. "Don't be a goofus," he chants to himself,
mantra-like, as he tries to play ball with them.
Of course, he Ms at first, but that's just the be
ginning of his summer of adventure.
The film, directed and written by David
Mickey Evans, continues in a jaunty, carefree
way, lifting dreamy sequences from "Field of
Dreams" and slow-motion lyricism from"The
Natural" Evans also tries to weave in pre-pu
bescent white-boy activities, whose cliches
squeeze a few laughs out of the audience. James
Earl Jones — who seems to enjoy starring in
semi-supernatural sports films and yapping
about why baseball is so great — appears as a
crotchety old man with a big junkyard dog.
Unfortunately, "The Sandlot" is all sugar
and very little spice, recalling the gritty realism
of "Encyclopedia Brown." Evans' attempt to
work Spielbergian magic frequently fizzles, and
he fails to coax believable performances from
the actors. And in another example of '90s po
litical sensibilities seeping into collective mem
ory, he features Latino and black kids playing
blissfully in 1960s white suburbia. Which one
of these does not belong?
"The Sandlot" does provide some genuine
laughs, but the jokes aren't very clever or
unique. Somebody barfs, so you laugh. The
narrator says of his fifth grade compatriot: "He
kissed a woman and he kissed her long and
good," so you laugh.
Most kids will probably enjoy the escapades
of the sandlot boys, but then again, most kids
can eat jellybeans for two hours and not feel ill.
You won't feel ill at the end of "The Sandlot,"
which tries to manufacture those happy days of
youth. But you won't feel very fed, either.

U.S. Treasury agent Jimmy Mercer (Wesley Snipes) takes aim at the men who murdered
his partner In the pseudo-action thriller "Boiling Point."
Hot actor Snipes
can't heat up this
lukewarm picture

Boiling Point

Imagine a movie about counterfeiters, cops
and call girls. Imagine a movie which manages
to perpetuate every conceivable stereotype
about the stupidity of women. Imagine a plot
less action movie which leaves its audience
yawning.
Now you don't have to see "Boiling Point"
Wesley Snipes stars as Jimmy Mercer, an
LA cop trying to bust two counterfeiters who
killed his partner. He has no evidence, but that
doesn't stop him from uncovering a series of
unbelievable coincidences that put him hot on
the killers' trail.
Mercer's target is Red Diamond (Dennis
Hopper), a con who owes the Mob 50 grand. He
and his partner Ronnie (Viggo Mortenson)
spend a week pulling off heist after heist to raise
the money, shooting everyone in their way.
Hopper gives an amazingly wooden perfor
mance — the only part of him that acts is his
hands. Maybe he's trying to parody George
Bush. Most of his dialogue consists of inter
minable pseudo-Mamet musings about busi
ness. Pass the popcorn, please.
What the movie lacks most is suspense, a
major flaw in a thriller. The audience knows
who the killers are, knows why and how they
kill. There are no high-speed chases or magnif
icent shootouts, only leisurely tailings through
beautiful downtown LA The violence in the
movie is the gratuitous kind — Ronnie shoots
one ofhis victims in the head with a sawed-off
shotgun, then smilingly runs his car over the
body.
If this weren't enough to offend moviegoers,
there are a series of boring and unrelated side
plots. Wesley has an ex-wife and kid. Why? His
current lover is a high-class hooker (Lolita Davi
dovich). Perhaps if she were as sexy as her name,
the audience might not wonder why a cop would
keep that kind of company.
Speaking of women, director James B. Har
ris does everything in his power to degrade the
women in the film. Take Connie, the drug ad
dict, whose husband calls her a "dumb junkie
bitch." She commits suicide by blowing up her
kitchen, where the movie suggests she belongs.

Red's wife continually takes him back, be
lieving all ofhis pathetic lies. And when Ronnie's
lover throws him out he slaps her, saying,
"That's not what you really want," then pins her
to the walL She finally sees the movie's warped
reasoning, and kisses him. Really, this movie is
an embarrassment to the '90s.
It's also a recipe for failure — start with a
boring plot, stir in mediocre acting and pepper
with degrading images. Audiences should put
the lid on "Boiling Point," turn off the stove
and forget it's even there.

Family squabble
turns ugly in new
Australian import

The Last Days of Chez Nous

"The Last Days of Chez Nous" is a unique
movie about a unique group of people. Set to
a jazz beat as mournful as it is exuberant, this
Australian import quietly celebrates family
and femininity.
Beth (Lisa Harrow), a writer, presides over
Chez Nous — a rambling Sydney cottage
housing her teenage daughter, her second
husband, her twentysomething sister, Vicki
(Kerry Fox), and their nerdy boarder.
Her husband J.P. (Bruno Ganz) is a French
man whose Old World sensibilities can't accom
modate all these independent women. "What
the hell am I doing here?" he asks himself. We
share his sense of powerlessness, thanks to force
ful performances from Harrow and Fox.
Vicki has just returned from Italy, seeking
refuge from a bad love affair. But you'd never

know it to look at her—beautiful and nervy,
she presents just the kind of threat that J.P. is
least prepared to handle.
Despite her strength, Vicki's completely
dependent on her big sister. She needs Beth's
guidance but resents her ability to provide it.
Meanwhile, Beth chafes at her role as moth
er to both her husband and sister. She's got
her own child and her own problems.
Director Gillian Armstrong, who success
fully handled a similar subject in "My Bril
liant Career," shows the neuroses, not the
mechanics of Beth's literary career.
Between J.P.'s indifference and her elderly
father's emotional abuse, Beth seeks to es
cape through her writing. She finally flees to
the stark outback with the old man, deter
mined to "settle" their unnamed conflicts.
When she calls home from a remote motel,
we see her coins stacked by denomination
atop the pay phone.
Ironically, as in Vicki's case, it's not the
trip, but the return home that destroys Beth.
Back at Chez Nous, everything has changed
— for better and for worse.
Chez Nous itself is a vivid character.
Graceful and unassuming on the outside, it
proves as full of subtle intricacies and shock
ingly incongruous colors as everything else
in the movie.
The cramped environs of Chez Nous
make for plenty of ominous angular shots
and spatial tensions. Armstrong indulges in
only one panoramic cityscape of Sydney
Harbor, saving her money shots for the end
less red deserts of the New South Wales out
back.
Even without the accents and red deserts,
you would know this is an Australian film. Fea
turing not one, but three strong women, and
written and directed by two more, "Chez Nous"
could never have been made in Hollywood.
If the movie has a flaw, it's that Arm

strong juxtaposes too many Big Issues with
moments of pure silliness. Her characters
go from dancing maniacally around the
house to musing philosophically on the af
terlife.
But "Chez Nous" achieves an offbeat kind
of balance nonetheless, successfully tran
scending the usual if-you-love-someone
