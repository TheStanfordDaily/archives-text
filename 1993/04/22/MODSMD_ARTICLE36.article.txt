Take the Bizarre
Ride II with funky
hip-hop comedy

The Pharcyde

MC's Slim Kid, Darky Boy, Booty Brown
and Fat Lip's debut album "Bizarre Ride II
The Pharcyde" is both a non-stop house
party and a rollercoaster ride into the world
of progressive hip-hop. These masters of the
mic, called The Pharcyde, feature innova
tive, funky hip-hop music with hype beats,
humorous lyrics and clever samples mixed
with jazz and R&B music.
Surprisingly, this group's label, Delicious
Vinyl, is best known for producing wacked
rappers Tone Loc and Young MC, who were
only concerned about Top-40 radio and
abandoned by suburban whites when their
second albums didn't have any hits. This new
group is from the gangsta-rap land of South
Central L.A. and has a unique style that re
sembles De La Soul.
"Oh Shit" is a cut where lyrics are thrown
down about the group's embarrassing expe
riences in the past. The phat beats, ghetto
humor and slammin' music make this exer
cise in self-degradation ultimate hip-hop
pleasure.
"Ya Mama" is a hilarious track that disses
a favorite target in da hood, people's old
girls. With lyrics like "ya mama's got an afro
with a chin strap" and "ya mama'ygot a glass
eye with a fish in it" over a bumpin' bass line,
these rappers sound almost like past cartoon
characters who say any crazy thing just to
make you laugh.
"Passing Me By" is a sensitive rap ballad
that has blown up on hip-hop, pop and R&B
stations across the nation. Each rapper de
scribes their past loves over a hardcore bass
line and soul music.
Pharcyde's fresh sound of freestyle, indi
vidualism, satire and lyrics with crazy no
tions will give them a loyal audience for
years to come. So if you have 15 bones and
are tired of centrist hip-hop, try The Phar
cyde, a hot group destined to make rival
MC's imitate their musical and lyrical
styles.

REM sound-alike
manages to create
solid rock album

The Tragically Hip

Rush home from record store in a sweat.
Rip up cardboard box and tear open plastic
coating. Run to stereo. Put in new "Tragical
ly Hip" disc. Finally relax. Close eyes. Ahhh
hhhhhh ... listen. Hear REM. Open eyes.
Check disc box. Examine receipt. Stop play
er. Scratch head.
The latest release by the "Tragically Hip"
entitled "Fully Completely" is good campus
rock. And, like many successful college
bands, they have taken R.E.M. as their idol.
But following closely in the footsteps of the
greatest twentysomething rock band of all
time also has its limitations.
Vocalist Bobby Blaker carefully mimics
R.E.M.'s lead singer Michael Stipe's trade
marks — the pained vibrato sound and
grungy emphasis — such that the two sound
astonishingly alike.
The lyrics wind creatively through the
songs, clinging to the rhythms just enough
to preserve their unity, but the content re
mains forgettable. Because most tracks em
phasize their chorus, they fail to relay a story,
and have little impact on the listener. But,
with most songs having little or nothing to
say in the first place, I count this as no big
loss.
The better and more familiar tracks off
the release are "Courage," "At the Hundredth
Meridian" and the title track. These songs
expand on the group's formula by using
more creative guitar work and vocal style.
The only work that clearly breaks away from
the album's continuity is "The Whitewithal."
It hits the listener much harder than other
tracks, but never escapes the band's calcula
tion and control.
"Fully Completely" is no fountain of cre
ativity, but it's actually a good album. The
Tragically Hip have a clear audience in mind,
and they've mastered their style. The album
won't be around 20 years from now, but it
will certainly get its 15 minutes of fame.

Rock band gives
up more of their
Deep South funk

Primus

Those wacky cheese-heads Primus are at
it again with their new album "Pork Soda."
The group continues their tradition of
emphasizing heavy bass, bringing this back
ground instrument into the spotlight —
where it carries much of the melody. As
usual, the lyrics are scattered amongst wan
dering guitars and rhythm-intense music
that sounds almost industrial — without
any of the sampling.-
"Pork Soda" is dedicated to the glorifica
tion of Southern, poor, pig-slopping, moon
shine-swilling, joyfully in bred, small town

white trash. In the twisted spirit of the group
Dead Milkmen, the title track pokes fun at
the idea of drinking a home-brewed soda
distilled from pickled pig parts.
More musically worthwhile songs include
"Welcome To This World," "Nature Boy"
and "Wounded Knee." Primus' great percus
sion sounds use variations in tempo to create
the feel of a military march ("Nature Boy"),
and psychedelic wind chimes ("Wounded
Knee").
The album's Southern flavor comes
through on two levels. The first on songs like
the tide track, "Pork Chop's Little Ditty,"
where the lead singer spits out the vocals in a
hokey Southern accent, and the choruses
consist of sophisticated lyrics like "ain't
nothing like sitting 'round the house sucking
down those cans of swine."
The other type of Deep South influence
can be heard on tracks like "The Air Is Get
ting Slippery," a jug-music song with a
danceable lead-banjo melody.
Other tracks hold non-traditional sur
prises, like an Irish dance tune with a man
dolin as the lead instrument, and a song ti
ded "Hail Santa," where a tricycle ringer sup
plies the main rhythm.
But the musical experimentation doesn't
end there. The album's best track is "Ham

ping, moonshine-swilling,
joyfully inbred, small town
white trash.

burger Train" a solid instrumental funk
piece with a wailing guitar in the back
ground. With the band on a free-form jazz
kick, it achieves the feel of a live piece,
Primus style.
Though the songs on "Pork Soda" never
quite capture the high humor of classic
Primus tracks like "Ass Whippin'," the album
still provides some good laughs. The overall
theme seems to combine more funk, more
sound and less "music" with more playful
ness, more experimentation and less tradi
tion. And for Primus lovers everywhere,
that's good news.
