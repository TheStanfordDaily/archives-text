■ Benny & Joon
Hip Seattle grunginess meets
1920s slapstick in this tale of misfit
romance. Benny is a mechanic
who cares for his eloquent but
schizophrenic sister, Joon. Enter
Sam, a charming weirdo who falls
in love with Joon, to her brother's
dismay. Johnny Depp pulls off the
physical comedy scenes with a
style and grace that's truly
Keatonesque. PG
■ The Crying Game
Still don't know the secret that's
got America abuzz? Well you won't
find out, unless you see writer-di
rector Neil Jordan's offbeat hit.
Stephen Rea, Forest Whitaker and
newcomer Jaye Davidson are at
the top of their game in this brilliant
web of love and intrigue involving
the IRA, a British soldier and an
enigmatic hairdresser. Shades of
"Vertigo," it's a definite must-see.

Falling Down
Michael Douglas plays a laid-off
defense worker who loses it while
trapped in an L.A. traffic jam. On
his way home, he leaves a trail of
trashed Korean grocery stores,
dead Latino gangbangers and ter-

rified fast food employees in his
wake. Why's it so bad? Because
the filmmakers think that terrorizing
Koreans and shooting helpless
Latinos is funny. It isn't. R
Indecent Proposal
The Brat Packer, The TV Bar
tender and The Sundance Kid
can't save this bomb. Destitute
couple wants money. Billionaire
wants wife. Billionaire offers a mil
lion dollars for one night with wife.
Couple agonizes over it. Wife does
it. Husband can't deal with it. Wife
enjoyed it. What's next? Pain,
angst and above all, a happy end
ing. What's the moral? Pimpin'
ain't easy? I wanna be yo' ho?
Avoid. R
