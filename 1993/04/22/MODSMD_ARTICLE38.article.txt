Notable 1992 debuts included actor Tim Robbins' auteurist
tour de force Bob Roberts, a biting satire of the world of
campaign politics. Robbins played the title character, a U.S.
Senate candidate who mixes Bush-Quayle conservatism, Clinton's
media savvy and Perot's down-home outsider status to buy, cheat
and steal his way to victory. Robbins' script is at times too clever for
its own good, but the film eloquently expresses voters' anger.
Politicians, take note.
Ernest Dickerson's work on She's Gotta Have It and Do the
Right Thing proved him one of the world's most talented cine
matographers. He directed Juice, a morality play set in Harlem,
about four friends whose lives are torn apart by a botched robbery.
The film's stylish look and pounding hip-hop score are undercut by
a clich£d, melodramatic script But Dickerson's brilliant use of the
Cypress Hill song "How I Could Just Kill a Man" is worth a look.
Billy Crystal, inspired by Raging Bull and comedian Lenny
Bruce, played a "Raging Jew" in his film Mr. Saturday Night, the
rags-to-riches-back-to-rags story of a stand-up comic. His char
acter's a brilliant performer, but he alienates everyone around him
with his constant need to be the center of attention. A decent ef
fort, but didn't Tom Hanks' Punchline prove that dramas about
comedians rarely work? A middle-of-the-week rent
Finally, Nick Gomez's Laws of Gravity stunned critics despite its
obvious parallels to the Martin Scorsese classic, Mean Streets. Two
aimless hoodlums — one smart one violent — try to pay off their
Mob debt with a bag of guns that a friend brings up from Florida.
Gomez replaces Scorsese's directorial wizardry and Catholic theolo
gy with a cinema-verity style that simply follows the pair as they drink,
start fights, make deals and drink some more. An unflinching look at
New York's criminal underclass, we can't help but wait anxiously for
his next film, a story of New Jersey car thieves. ■
