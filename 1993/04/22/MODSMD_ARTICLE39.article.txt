The story follows Emma, a young British woman
who moves to New York City in search of adventure
and romance. Emma tells her story through soul
searching musical monologues and her letters home
to England.
Performances begin tonight and run through April
24 at 8 p.m. in the Eleanor Prosser Studio, upstairs in
Memorial Hall. Admission is $3 at the door, and seat
ing is limited.
