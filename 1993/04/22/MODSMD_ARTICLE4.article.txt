# Kimmel attacks apathy about rape
## Speaker says male drive to be macho helps cause crime 
### Johnathon Briggs 
Men's fear of being labeled "sissies" may lead
them to prove their masculinity through sexual as
sault, Michael Kimmel told an audience last night
as he called for males to change their attitudes to
ward rape.
Kimmel, a visiting sociology professor at UC-
Berkeley, spoke in Cubberley Auditorium on
"William Kennedy Smith, Mike Tyson, Senator
Packwood, and Us: Why Men Should Care About
Rape."
"Its going to be an uphill fight," said Kimmel as
he addressed a sparse crowd of about 50 students,
almost evenly divided between men and women.
"It's not because men . . . are so actively hostile as
utterly apathetic."
Most men "would read the flyer 'Why Men
should Care About Rape?' and say . . . 'Why should
I care? I'm not a rapist, it's those other men, it's not
me.
Men still have a "terror of being a sissy" and as a
result are constantly trying to assert their man
hood, Kimmel said. "When does it stop? When do
you stop proving it? We have to allow for a mecha
nism for men to relax about this 'sissy terror.' "
If men want better relationships with women at
work as well as at home then men must change, he
said.
"All you had to do in the '50s to be a man was fol-

low four rules," Kimmel said.
According to him, men had to:
avoid being seen as sissies, be
"big wheels" by displaying mas
culinity through power and
wealth, hide their feelings and
exude a sense of daring.
These four ideas of masculini
ty are perpetuated by fear of
"anything remotely feminine,"
Kimmel said, and help explain
why there is sexism, rape, sexual
harassment and even the high
number of AIDS cases among
men.
If men always feel that they
have to live up to this standard
there will continue to be a great
number rapes, Kimmel said.
Men must rid themselves of
the "male predatory" and "sexual
entitlement" mind set, he said.
Men must not continue to pursue
women and define their mas
culinity by the number of sexual
encounters they have.
They must also, he said, not
think that they are entitled to a
woman's body.
Women have redefined them
selves in recent decades, he said,
while men generally have not.
Citing surveys measuring how
women think of men, Kimmel
said that women's perception of
men has worsened from 1970 to
1990.
"Are men worse now then they

were in the '70s? . . . Have we
regressed?" he asked. The answer
"has to do with the lives of
women."
Men, in fact, have not
regressed, he said, but women
have changed.
"The expectations of women
have changed and women's expe
riences have changed, but men's
experiences and men's lives have
not changed in relation to that in
the last 25 years," Kimmel said.
"As a result you have a gender
gap " # _ _
Kimmel said the women s
movement and the sexual revolu
tion redefined women in four
ways: it made gender more visi
ble, increased the number of
women in the work force,
changed their relation to work
and the home and made women
feel "entitled to sexual pleasure."
"Men must see rape and what
they can do to stop it," by chang
ing the norm for men and making
them see that it is all right to be
pro-feminist, he said.
"Men can support feminism,
can support women's coming for
ward, women's voices around
their own sexual assault and vic
timization," Kimmel said.
Men should talk to each other
and help decrease assaults, Kim
mel said. "Men must confront
men about rape."
The program, co-sponsored by
the Stanford Men's Collective
and the Rape Education Project,
was part of Rape Awareness
Week.
