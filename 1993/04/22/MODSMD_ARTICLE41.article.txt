There's nothing left to do but come to
terms with it.
I just really don't have anything better to
be doing right now. Later, maybe. But right
now I'm just bored out of my skull. And I
don't have a damn thing to do.
Maybe something's on TV. Hang on, I'll go
check.
Nope. Nothing interesting there either.
And when the totem of passive entertain

ment fails, you know life's just gonna suck.
But either way I'm still bored.
Thumb-twiddling, bricks-on-the-wall
counting, reminiscent-of-Great-Works-sec
tion, Three's-Company-rerun, baloney-on
white, just-another-day, "Idunnowhudday
ouwannado," let's-go-bowling, dammit-I'm
in-college-now-and-if-these-are-the-best-
days-of-my-life-I'm-more-than-mildly-dis-
appointed bored.
I figure there are two types of boredom.
One, when you're desperate to do something,

but there's just nothing there to do. And sec
ond, when there is a lot to do, but none of it
seems adequate.
I wonder which type I'm seething with
now.
Oh, you don't care. Because if you really
did you'd come over right now and entertain
me and then I wouldn't have to write this stu
pid thing just to amuse myself.
