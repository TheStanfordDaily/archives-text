# Grants to target minority techies
## Stanford one of 7 schools chosen to participate in NSF program 
### Bill Ackerman Staff writer 
Stanford is one of seven uni
versities chosen to participate in
a National Science Foundation
program that aims to increase
the number of minority students
graduating with degrees in engi
neering and science.
The foundation will give Stan
ford a total of $662,500 for the
five-year program, called the Al
liance for Minority Participation,
which is set to begin in the fall.
Blacks, Chicanos/Latinos and
Native Americans are being tar
geted specifically.
"We want to increase the num
ber of undergraduates who are
from the underrepresented mi
nority groups," said Noe Lozano,
director for Minority and Affir
mative Action Programs in the
School of Engineering. "We want
to create an opportunity for them
to do well academically."
Today, he said, about 30 per
cent of minority students who
enter the University intending to
study engineering eventually
switch their majors.
"I think its a good program,"
said engineering economic sys
tems graduate student Mike
Pickrum, a member of the Soci
ety of Black Scientists and Engi
neers. "I don't think enough ef
forts and grants are [currently
being] made to get minorities to
go for graduate degrees."
The grant will be used to re
cruit more minority engineering
students, teach summer classes
to incoming freshman and pro
vide financial assistance to grad
uate students. The School of En
gineering will add almost $1 mil
lion of its own funds to the effort.
"Right now our big competi
tors, Berkeley and MIT, are get

ting more of the top (minority)
talents," Lozano said.
Summer sessions will be fi
nanced for students desiring
more preparation for certain en
gineering classes. Many high
school classes use a descriptive
method for teaching math and
science rather than the analytical
method favored at Stanford,
Lozano said. As a result, many
students arrive unprepared.
"If students are taught analyt
ically then they are in sync when
they get here," Lozano said. "But
for the other students it gets
tougher. They are learning a
whole new teaching method ver
sus whole new content."
The School of Engineering is
concerned that many students
interested in engineering unnec
essarily fall victim to "weed-out"
classes because of poor high
school preparation and a lack of
group support.
Pickrum agreed that these
types of support are important.
"Though there's a lot of push to
get more minorities in, it's sort of
like a Catch-22; these students
may have the ability but they
may not be as prepared" by their
educational background, he said.
Lozano said the school hopes
to benefit from the experiences of
three historically black universi
ties — North Carolina A&T State
University, Southern University
in Louisiana and Prairie View
A&M in Texas — which have also
been selected for the program.
"Their success in creating . . .
support allowing blacks to reach
their potential should be help
ful," Lozano said.
In addition to focusing on un
dergraduates, Stanford will give
financial aid to minority students
