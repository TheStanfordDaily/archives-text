Russian campaign heats up
IZHEVSK, Russia (AP) — Boris
Yeltsin, seeking support in a referendum
on his leadership, promised massive aid
to Russia's depressed defense-industry
heartland yesterday while opponents
accused the president of plotting a coup.
The mudslinging was heavy in the
final days of the campaign for Sunday's
vote.
The Supreme Soviet legislature,
locked in a power struggle with Yeltsin
for months, issued a statement charging
him with engineering extensive election
fraud and planning to impose one-man
rule on election night.
Yeltsin's aides denied the allegations,
contained in a Supreme Soviet statement
quoting unidentified sources in the Secu
rity Ministry.
But during a whirlwind trip to the con
centration of defense plants at Izhevsk,

Yeltsin promised "a series of decisive,
harsh measures." He refused to elaborate.
Ozone at record low
WASHINGTON (AP) - The ozone
layer that protects the Earth from ultra
violet radiation has dropped to record low
levels globally, with the biggest decline
over areas that include North America,
Europe and parts of Asia.
The finding strengthens the concern
about the effects of man-made chemicals
on the natural ozone layer, researchers
said, although they also said the dip may
be related to a 1991 volcanic eruption.
J.F. Gleason, a scientist at the Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland, said that
measurements last December and January
by a NASA satellite showed that the ozone
layer was thinner than in any previous
measurements. The Nimbus 7 satellite has
been taking measurements since 1979.
