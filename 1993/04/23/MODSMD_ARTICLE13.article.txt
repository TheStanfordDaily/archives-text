# Clinton searches for new answers

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House, still reeling from its jobs-bill
defeat, searched yesterday for initia
tives on which to score a clear-cut vic
tory before getting enmeshed in other
looming disputes over campaign
finance reform and national health
insurance.
One candidate: Clinton's proposal to
restructure the college loan program to
allow students to pay off their loans
through national service.
Clinton announced that he would
send the measure — a key campaign
promise — to Congress next week. While
not without controversy, the program is
relatively straightforward and holds out
the possibility of attracting bipartisan
support.
Meanwhile, the administration worked
— without much optimism — with Demo
cratic leaders on ways to salvage parts of
Clinton's decimated jobs-stimulus package.
"There are a number of options,"
White House communications director

George Stephanopoulos said.
"The president wants to move forward
on summer jobs, he wants to move for
ward on investments in highways and
mass transit, and he wants to move for
ward on immunization and all the other
important initiatives contained in his
package."
Other White House aides said that a
supplemental appropriations bill might be
introduced in the House next week that
would include spending for these jettisoned
programs.
The mood at the White House was
clearly dark a day after Clinton was hand
ed his first major legislative defeat as
Democratic leaders failed for the fourth
time in a month to break a Republican fil
ibuster on Clinton's $16.3 billion jobs
stimulus package.
The White House and the Democratic
leadership then abandoned the proposal
and approved instead a $4 billion pro
gram to provide jobless benefits for
unemployed workers who have exhaust-

Ed their benefits — the only part of the
package that wasn't resisted by the GOP.
Other parts of Clinton's overall eco
nomic plan also appeared to be unravel
ling.
White House officials reluctantly sig
naled they might have to reconsider a part
of the package — an investment tax credit
— which is opposed by Rep. Dan Roe
tenkowski, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, and other key
Democrats.
"We're looking at it right now," White
House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said.
"I'm not ruling it in, I'm not ruling it out."
Other administration sources said Clin
ton was likely to fight hard for at least one
part of the investment tax credit — the one
for small businesses. The other part — the
short-term investment tax credit — is
more expendable, the sources suggested.
Clinton has proposed a tax credit worth
more than $20 billion to encourage com
panies to purchase new equipment for job
creating projects.
