PARKING. FOR years stu
dents have railed at high
permit prices, insufficient
spaces and the vast chasms sepa
rating student lots from resi
dences.
While it is unrealistic to ask
the University to lower permit
prices or build new lots in the face
of recent budget cuts, campus
parking planners could help pro
mote student safety with one sim
ple change â€” by only enforcing
residence-specific parking regula
tions between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Currently, students who want
to visit friends across campus can
not park their car in a lot outside
their zoned area without fear of a
Cushman-riding officer motoring
by and slapping a nasty $15 ticket
on their windshield.
Allowing students with a resi
dence permit to park in any
marked student area after the des

ignated hours would foster a
greater sense of security for those
who would otherwise have to walk
across campus alone at night. Stu
dents studying late in the library
or burning the midnight oil in
their labs deserve a safe way to get
back home.
Moreover, by changing night
time enforcement policies, stu
dents who drive to parties and
drink wouldn't feel pressured into
driving their cars back home.
With the change, Stanford's
police officers would be able to
spend more time patrolling cam
pus and deterring crime rather
than writing stacks of tickets.
During the daytime, zoned resi
dence parking makes sense as a
way to prevent students from driv
ing to classes and to discourage
traffic on campus.
But at night, students deserve a
break.
