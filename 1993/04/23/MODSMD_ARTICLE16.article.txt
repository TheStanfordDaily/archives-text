# Engineers' equality
## 
### 
Nowadays, about 30
percent of minority under
graduates who enter Stan
ford intending to be an engineer
ing major eventually change their
field of study.
According to officials at the
School of Engineering, this dra
matic drop-off is primarily the
result of poor high-school prepara
tion and a lack of adequate support
services; as a result, many African-
American, Chicano/Latino and
Native American students, who
are more likely to come from
underfunded school districts, fall
victim to "weed-out" classes.
But help may be in sight for
incoming minority students. Stan
ford was recently chosen as one of
seven participants in a National
Science Foundation program that
will give the University a grant to
increase the number of minority
students graduating with science
and engineering majors.
Coupled with a $1 million con

tribution from the School of Engi
neering, the added funds will be
used to recruit more minority
engineering students, fund special
summer classes in math and sci
ence for incoming freshmen and
provide financial aid for both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. The summer programs,
which may begin as soon as this
year, would put all students on an
equal footing when classes start.
An increase in the number of
minority teaching assistants
would provide more role models
for minority students and make
them feel more comfortable in
"techie" classes.
Lastly, an expansion of financial
aid to fifth-year minority students
would allow more aspiring scien
tists and engineers to utilize Stan
ford's research programs.
Hopefully with this grant and
the resulting programs, the Uni
versity can also take the lead in
diversifying the classroom.
