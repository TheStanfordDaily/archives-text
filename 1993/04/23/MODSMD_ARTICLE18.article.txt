## Montana precedes Texas? 
### 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT, the local
news broadcast began with 10
minutes of Joe Montana. The
news did not only describe the deal that
was arranged, but also showed man-on
the-street reactions.
A distraught woman called in to a
radio show dedicated to the subject,
because she had named her child after
Joe Montana, and didn't know how she
would explain to her daughter that Joe is
leaving. Grown men swore that they
would never go to another 49ers game
again. Claims flew that Joe Montana
would lead the Kansas City Chiefs to a
Super Bowl victory, simply because he
was there — and would actually play
(imagine that).
I staunchly refuse to call Joe Montana
"Joe," except to avoid a sense of repeti
tion. By calling him by his first name, he
gets an elevated status, as if no other
human being named Joe existed on the
entire planet (of course, I am forgetting
that Joe Montana is superhuman . . .
ever notice that people named after
states have more fun than the rest of us?
Joe Montana. Indiana Jones.). It would
be like calling Donald Duck, "The Don
ald," or calling Pink Floyd, "The Floyd,"
or something equally ridiculous.
Oh yeah, and the Waco thing hap
pened, and Bosnia is quickly becoming
one giant, burned-out crater. Scores of
people died, and the Chronicle pre-empt-

Ed those stories with a story about Joe
Montana on the top of the front page. I
bet the font they used for that headline
was about as big as the ones used for
"War Ends in Europe, Berlin Overrun."
I'm not trying to be the voice of social
conscience (I don't really have one any
way), but I am pointing out the utter stu
pidity of the situation. This was an
obscene aberration of priorities. I'm
telling you all of this, because on Satur
day it matters. On Saturday in Tresidder,
there will be CPR and first-aid training.
So instead of catching up on your read
ing, instead of getting a tan, instead of
finishing your problem set, you can learn
to save someone's life. You can learn how
to save your mom or dad whose heart just
decided to march to the beat of a different
drummer, because he or she had one too
many oh-just-one-more-of-these-but
tered-egg-waffles-with-whipped-cream-
won't-kill-me's.
For years, I've avoided learning where
to apply pressure to stop blood from
gushing out of someone's femoral artery.
If I'd ever been the first to arrive at the
scene of a car wreck, I could recall those
after-school specials and the tiny frag
ments of first-aid would be enough to
keep someone from bleeding to death. If I
couldn't decide where to grab the victim
in case of spinal iiyury, I'd just pick a spot
and yank. If later it turned out that they
were paralyzed for life, hey, they just

kissed a rock wall at 60 miles-per-hour,
so a little tug from me couldn't have done
much in the way of extra damage.
Sure, the down side was that I'd never
get a summer job herding little kids at
places with funny Native American
sounding names like Yawgoog (meaning
"place for small children to torture col
lege students"). I expected everyone
around me to know what I didn't, so that
I could sit back and relax while someone
else did all of the hard work (all that
pushing on somebody's chest doesn't
look like a walk in the park). If I got to
actually use the defibrillator machine,
that would be pretty cool, but I think the
paramedics keep a pretty tight reign on
who gets to use it and on whom.
If you don't want to save lives in the
interest of population control or inherent
cruelty, then do whatever you want.
Whether your work and sleep is more
important than learning to save lives
compares to Joe Montana versus
Waco/Bosnia.
