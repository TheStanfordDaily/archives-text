Student neglect creates cat surplus on Stanford campus

HUMANS SMOKE, animals
don't. But every year in univer
sities and laboratories through
out the nation, countless numbers of
them are forced to inhale the equiva
lent of many packs of cigarettes a day.
Humans take drugs, animals don't. But
every year countless numbers are
turned into addicts by being force-fed
narcotics in research labs. Animals
don't drink alcohol, but every year
alcohol is funnelled into them. We suf
fer from insomnia from our daily
excesses, so we force animals to stay
awake until they go crazy. We feel
stress from our way of living, so we
traumatize animals in rotating drums
to force them into a state of stress. We
cause car accidents from incompetence
or carelessness or drunk driving, so we

fasten animals to vehicles and send
them crashing into walls.
It is no accident that the concept of
"scapegoat" uses the metaphor of an
animal. Those less powerful have always
been made to pay for the excesses of the
master species. The question is not
whether humans come first or whether
animals come before people. Such over
simplistic dichotomies obscure more
than they illuminate. It is rather a ques
tion of responsibility and sober reflec
tion.
At Stanford, there are close to 300
cats that have been abandoned by stu
dents. Every year, in contravention of
University rules, students bring cats
into their campus housing only to kick
them out at the end of the year when it
is time to go home. Once again, animals

are made to pay for the excesses of
humanity. Once domesticated, it is diffi
cult for them to fend for themselves. We
have made them dependent, and then
abdicate our responsibility.
Every day, as I recently learned, vol
unteers of a group called the Stanford
Cat Network feed these feline campus
residents. They are spayed/neutered
and given medical attention, and
attempts are made to find them respon
sible homes. There are those who say
the Network only encourages the cats
and if they weren't fed, they would "go
away." Cats, trash, used goods, other
waste — just throw them away. It is
this irresponsibility that has led to
countless environmental problems. In a
finite ecosystem, there is no such thing
as "away." Our polluted earth is a

painful reminder. It is all the more dis
heartening when applied to sentient
beings.
There are even those who suggest the
cats should be exterminated. Let us not
forget that the cats are not here by
choice. They are here because our fellow
students put them here. And we have
certain responsibilities to those less pow
erful, less able to care for themselves —
species who are dependent on our com
passion because we have forced them to
be.
A cat is a lifetime responsibility, not
just something cute for three quarters in
a dorm room. When those students go
home for the summer, these cats don't
go away, they go hungry.
