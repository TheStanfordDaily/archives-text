Stanford will deny all allegations
brought in a recent suit by a University
safety engineer including breach of con
tract, defamation and unfair penalization
University legal officials said this week.
Gary Schell claims supervisors discrimi
nated against him when he refused to ig
nore health and safety hazards, and is seek
ing more than $10,000 in damages.
"The charges on the face of the lawsuit
will be strenuously denied," said Senior
University Counsel Mike Vartain.
As a safety engineer, Schell was "given
the task of saying, 'hey, this is right and
this is not,' " said his attorney, John Shaf
fer.
According to Shaffer, when Schell blew
the whistle on safety hazards in the Gilbert
Building for Biological Sciences, he was not
supported by the University; instead, he
was excluded from health and safety meet
ings, discriminated against and lost career

advancement opportunities.
The lawsuit outlines seven "causes of
action" that range from negligent and in
tentional misrepresentation to defama
tion, injurious falsehood and slander.
According to Shaffer, "causes of action"
are designed to bring a claim before the
court, that if proven to be true, justifies
some action by the court.
The suit seeks $10,500 to cover lost
wages, in addition to general damages for
emotional distress and punitive damages.
While Vartain did not have any specific
response to the allegations, he called the
charges "scanty."
"Precisely what charges are behind the
allegations, we're in the dark about until
the lawsuit proceeds," Vartain said.
The University plans to respond to the
allegations within 60 days. After that,
pleadings are filed in a process known as
"discovery" — where plaintiffs swear to
facts regarding the suit.
After discovery, Vartain said
the lawsuit will go through court
procedures and then a trial, if

necessary. He refused to com
ment on whether the University
would attempt to settle with
Schell out of court.
"I had hoped, frankly, that
this matter could be resolved —
they haven't indicated much
interest in that," Shaffer said.
