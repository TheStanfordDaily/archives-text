# Inefficient answering machines cause havoc
## 
### 
Stanford has a distinguished Opera
tions Research department, and Provost
Gerald Lieberman is a highly-esteemed
member of the department. "Operations
Research" simply means efficiency, yet
Stanford impresses me as a very ineffi
cient operation, despite the devotion of
most staff members. This may be a
result of size (smaller is usually more
efficient), or perhaps universities are
inherently inefficient.
I refer here specifically to telephone
problems. For economy reasons, but to
the general annoyance of the public,
large organizations have installed
answering machines, which tell the
caller to press one, two, three, etc. Often
this leads to more mechanical responses
which do not answer the precise ques
tion the caller wants to ask.
However, at Stanford a more annoy
ing problem is the abuse of the answer

ing machine. Usually the explanation is
that the official is in a meeting, is on a
coffee break, is out sick or is attending
a conference (possibly in Honolulu, not
to mention a not-infrequent abuse of
conference mania). The recorded
answer promises that the call will be
returned as soon as possible, but often
it is not. It is charged, even by Univer
sity officials, that the non-responder is
hiding behind the answering machine.
This can be very annoying when one
needs a prompt answer to a simple
question.
Let me be specific. My assistant is a
student who lives in the French House.
I needed to get in touch with him one
morning at about 8:30 a.m., but he had
changed his room, and for about a week
his telephone was inoperative. I called
the French House public phone, but no
one answered. Thinking the resident
fellow could be of help, I called the
French Department to find out his
name and phone number. To my
amazement, the responder said she did
not know.

I called the residences office and was
referred to the row office (which suppos
edly opens at 8 a.m.), but no one
answered there. In despair, I called the
Dean of Students' office, which moved
with admirable promptness, and my
assistant called me; it was now about 9
a.m.
This episode is important only in that
it is typical of a widespread situation.
The travelling salesman is a classical
problem in operations research. Why
cannot our experts in that field worry
about the phoning professor (or stu
dent)?
