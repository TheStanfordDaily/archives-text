# Secession an option for Stanford grad students
## 
### 
We don't really care if Stanford
undergraduates don't want the ASSU
funding our happy hours while funding
their own bonfires. And we really don't
care what the kids on the Daily editori

al board think about grad-student apa
thy. We find it amusing that they pre
sume to tell us about our responsibili
ties. (Primarily a two-year-old daughter
and another child soon to be born.)
What really annoys us is that a bunch
of 20-year-olds still learning to be inde
pendent from their parents (emotional
ly only, not financially) have control
over some of the money that we should
be spending on our family. The only
reason for increased grad-student
involvement in the ASSU is to insure
that the ASSU cannot touch our
money.
Student government is, as it should
be, by and for the undergrads. We're
graduating this year, but our advice to
new grad students is simple: SECEDE!
It is humiliating to be told to jump
through hoops in order to keep your
money, and there is no reason why it
should continue.
