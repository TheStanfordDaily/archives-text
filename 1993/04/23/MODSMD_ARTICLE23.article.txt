T'S NOT EASY BEING JOEL
Stein. Sure, it sounds great. Pre-school
children dressing up as you for Hal
loween. Kickbacks from plastic surgeons
whose clients request your nose and jaw
bone. Women falling off bicycles trying
to say hello to you, wearing nothing but
six-inch stiletto heels and gold lame
push-up bras, just because you men
tioned that particular ensemble in some
column you don't even remember.
But there's more to it than that,
babe. My column is translated into 43
languages, none of which I speak. It's
made available to more than 300 news
papers, magazines and computer bul
letin boards, worldwide.
With that kind of exposure comes
responsibility — more responsibility
than you, dear reader, will be asked to
deal with in your entire life. Responsi
bility not only for the ideas and
philosophies I put forth, but for the
aesthetic beauty of the similes,
metonyms, synecdoches and apostro
phes I use to convey those thoughts.
Responsibility, as indirect as it may be,
for Fox programming.
Multinational companies from
around the globe fight tooth and nail
for my skills. Representatives from
Aussie 3-Minute Miracle Shampoo call
to offer five-digit figures to have the
back of their bottle rewritten, to make
it more "Odwalla-y."
My instinct is to shoot the receiver
like Harrison Ford in "Star Wars,"
insulted by having my work compared to
that of the blatantly inferior Odwalla

writer. But I hesitate and put the gun
down, realizing much more is at stake.
Millions of people in the ex-British
empire read the Aussie bottle each
morning in the shower, and I have a
responsibility to them, no matter how
much an intolerable slob Aussie's mar
keting guy happens to be. Yes, responsi
bility. So I transfer him to my other
number and let my people take care of it.
I maintain two separate phone num
bers, both unlisted. And though the peo
ple at the Joel Stein Service do their
best to have both numbers changed as
often as possible, adding each new
AT&T security feature the day it comes
out, someone always seems to get a hold
of it. All too often, it's Dennis Miller
asking for some arcane reference. I like
Dennis, but he's too dependent.
This week, the messages on the non
corporate number included: a plea from
Don Henley for an old pair of jeans for
a charity auction to preserve Walden; a
supplication, flanked by serious finan
cial incentive, to get me to jump out of
a cake for some spoiled, SF deb's birth
day party; and an offer from an exec at
MTV (who just "loved" the TV show) to
guest vee-jay with Ed Lover and Dr.
Dre. Needless to say, most of these calls
go unanswered.
I spend an hour a week looking at fan
mail carefully weeded through by Ser
vice employees. That means I only get
to one or two, due to their length and
spelling problems. I then spend another
hour preparing a return package con
sisting of a personal letter, a signed 5 X
7 glossy and a corrected, fully edited
copy of their manuscript. People often
write more than once. Some send sever
al copies of the same letter, hoping to
improve their chances of gaining audi

ence. This does not escape the notice of
the Joel Stein Service.
Most of the letters ask me very spe
cific, well-researched questions, such as
"Did you really sleep with two beautiful
bisexual women? And, if so, are they
straight now?" or "Did the sperm bank
offer you much more money for your
sperm than for other men's?" or "Can
you please write more about eighth
grade sweetheart Kelly Mack, and what

she's doing now?" I take these ques
tions seriously and answer them with
the respect they warrant.
Others, however, use the opportu
nity to ask for back copies of columns
they missed or forgot to clip out. To
them I send a form letter which
unequivocally states that except in the
case where an unexpected death of an
immediate family member causes a
person to leave the state on the day a
column was published, the request of
a back issue is considered an insult
and results in immediate dismissal
from the the Fan Club. Requests
which have accompanying copies of
death certificates and plane tickets
are, however, processed and back
issues are sent.
In addition to these oftentimes bur
dening responsibilities, my position on
campus makes it virtually impossible
for me to enjoy the Stanford experience
as a participant; instead I am doomed
to experience it only as the icon and
paradigm I so quickly became. Profes
sors, almost unilaterally, refuse to
grade my papers on writing style, feel
ing inadequate and unqualified to judge
my ability. Instead they grade "on con
tent" or beg me to take it pass/no cred
it. I like to see them squirm.
And I have enemies. Fanzines, often
fly-by-night operations of unscrupu
lous, profiteering paparazzi, pop up by
the handful — eager to turn every 17-
year old girl in six-inch stiletto heels, a
gold-lame bra, twisted handlebars and a
body cast into a national incident. A
mysterious fraternity member, insulted
by a column concerning my policy of
utter disdain for the use of drugs and
alcohol, pours cheap beer into the gas
tank of my station wagon in a misguid-

Ed attempt to make it weave in and out
of lanes.
Yes, being Joel Stein is a pretty pres
tigious, important and dangerous role
to play, and I wouldn't trade it for the
world. But not everyone was meant to
handle it.
The truth is, I don't understand
your life and I don't pretend to. The
best I can do is to strongly advise you to
keep following my words and my
exploits, and to depend only upon infor
mation you read in this column, in
research articles compiled by the Joel
Stein Service or in memos written on
paper with "The Joel Stein Column"
insignia used as a watermark.
No, you can never hope to get the
kind of meaning from your own life as
you can from closely following mine.
No, you can never hope to approximate
the adrenaline rush I achieve simply by
looking in the bathroom mirror and
brushing my teeth.
I'm paid extraordinary fees by giant
British, American and Japanese compa
nies to provide the psychological outlet
which keeps you from leaving your job
and trying to be me. Sure it's a lot of
responsibility, but I can handle it. I'm
Joel Stein.

Editor's note: The Daily takes no respon
sibility for Joel Stein's egregious pompos
ity.
