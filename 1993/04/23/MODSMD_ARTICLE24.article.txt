## Seniors say bye-bye to Burnham No. 2 volleyball faces UC-San Diego in last home match of season 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
It's like being in the middle lane on the
freeway. You're driving along at a nice clip,
but you just can't get your car to accelerate
fast enough to zip into the left lane with the
speediest cars.
Five years ago, Stanford's men's volley
ball team was mired in that middle lane.
But the six seniors who will take the Burn
ham floor tomorrow at 5 p.m. against UC-
San Diego (2-23, 1-16 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) provided the
acceleration necessary for the squad to
switch to the fast track.
"They have taken Stanford men's volley
ball through the toughest part of our devel
opment," said coach Ruben Nieves. "When
these guys came in, we had gotten to the
point where we were competing very well
with the other teams in the league, but we
were not. . . the premier volleyball program
in the country."
It started in 1988 with the entrance of
freshmen Ryan Moos, Dave Goss, John
Hribar and John Bezmalinovic, widely her
alded as the best recruiting class ever. A
year later, Jimmy Blackman appeared on
the scene as a freshman and Bob Hillman
transferred from Georgetown. Living up to
their billing, these six integral members of
the active 12-man squad have transformed
Cardinal men's volleyball (17-4, 15-3
MPSF) from competitive to dominating, and
from a top-20 team to national champi
onship contenders.
"We do not have the most national cham
pionships," Nieves said. "But in terms of
the quality of the training, where the top

high-school players want to play, how pre
pared players are to play for the National
Team and pro beach volleyball and profes
sional volleyball in Europe, I think we're
setting the standard right now. ... In the
last five years, we have arrived at that
goal."
This year, Volleyball Monthly called
Stanford's current freshman class "the best
in the nation." But without the team's six
graduating seniors, it is doubtful whether
any of these promising freshmen would be
wearing the cardinal-and-white now.
"Players want to be in a program where
they can win the national championship,"
Nieves said. "When these players arrived (in
1988), all of a sudden it was like, 'Hey, there
might be a championship in the future for
this program.' "
Alphabetically, Bezmalinovic tops the list
of spikers saying good-bye to Burnham
tomorrow. In the middle, "Bez" excels at a
skill which the team as a whole does not —
blocking. He holds the top two Stanford
records for total blocks in a match (with 14
and 13) and is fifth in career blocks for the
Cardinal. This year he has been rotated in
and out of the middle blocker position with
Brian Garrett and Joe Burghardt.
Setter Blackman is the only fourth-year
senior of the bunch. Third on the Stanford
career assists list, Blackman has played a
backup role to Canyon Ceman this season.
The importance of this role was demon
strated last Saturday when, coming in at
setter — after Hillman sprained an ankle
and Ceman moved to swing hitter — he led
the squad to a four-game win with a career
high 92 assists, five digs and four blocks.
All-American Goss plays opposite hitter.

Third in the nation with an average of 7.09
kills per game, he spearheads a Cardinal
attack that is second in the country in hit
ting percentage. He is also 14th in the coun
try in digs, averaging 2.32 per game.
Hillman has had many physical ailments
this year, including a sprained thumb and
ankle. Yet he has managed to be a mainstay
on the squad, both statistically and emo
tionally. At swing hitter, he is second on the
team with a 4.19 kills-per-game average.
Emotionally, he tends to be the most vocal
on-court player. If he's frustrated, he'll try
to rip the net down, and if he's excited, his
cheers are the loudest heard.
Hribar doesn't like to sing his own prais
es, but his play this year has been worth
talking about. This mild-mannered middle
blocker from the volleyball Mecca of Pitts
burg, Penn., is third in the nation with a
.484 hitting percentage and also leads the
team with 60 blocks.
See Moos pass. A swing hitter, Moos
excels at this statistically invisible skill.
Sixth in the MPSF in aces-per-game, Moos'
serve is also the most potent on the team.
"The majority of my successes in volley
ball have been at Stanford," Moos said.
"The program's changed, and I think we've
got it headed in a great direction. There's
definitely a national championship in our
future."
Tomorrow is the last day for the Stanford
community to see the play of the seniors
who have carried the men's volleyball pro
gram so far. But it remains to be seen
whether they can carry the team to the
Final Four and cap off their careers with
the national championship that has eluded
them thus far.
