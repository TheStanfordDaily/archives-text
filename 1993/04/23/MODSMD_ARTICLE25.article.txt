# Sailors to compete at Pacific Champs
## Women try to qualify for Nationals 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
The Cardinal women sailors
will put their championship
title on the line this weekend
as nine teams battle in the
Women's Pacific Coast Cham
pionships in Alameda, Calif.
Though the Cardinal will
aim to win the regatta, it is
more important that it finishes
as one of the top two teams.
This would secure Stanford a
berth in the Women's National
Championships, held in Mary
land beginning May 27.
Whether a third berth will
open up for the Pacific Coast
Conference has not yet been
decided.
Strong contenders for the
advancing spots are California,
UC-Irvine, UC-Santa Barbara
and USC, all of whom will pose
serious challenges to the Stan
ford team.
Manning Stanford's boat in
Division A will be freshman
skipper Gretchen Uznis, who
will sail with senior crewmate
Britt Johnson.
In Division B, senior skipper
Haley King will team up with
senior crewmate Kathy Akers.
Freshman Cinnamon Hampkin
and sophomore Polly Brown
will stand by as substitutes for
the Cardinal.
According to Middleton,
Uznis has consistently per
formed well, turning in impres
sive outings for a freshman
skipper, and King is a veteran
with proven talent. King and

Akers have competed at nation
als for the past two years, and
although Haley has sailed off

Akers have done well each
time - -i mm
"Being away doesn t seem to
have affected us this season. If
we have any problems, they'll
be psychological or just luck,"
Haley said.
"If we keep a positive and
relaxed attitude, we should
qualify and maybe win."
While the women sail in the
Alameda Estuary, the rest of
the team will be preparing for
the Pacific Coast Dinghy
Championships and Team Rac
ing Championships in Cabrillo
Beach, Calif., held April 30
through May 2.
Stanford earned the right to
compete for the Pacific Coast
Dinghy Championship by tak
ing second place behind Cali
fornia in the last leg of the
North Series, held last Satur
day in Redwood City.
With the win, the Golden
Bears also took the nine-regat
ta North Series title and the
coveted North Series Perpetual
Bell.
"It*B a symbol of pride .. .
and it was disappointing to not
only lose, but to lose in our
home waters," Middleton said.
"But there are more important
things ahead that we have to
sail for."
Middleton said the bell was
last seen and heard "going ga
