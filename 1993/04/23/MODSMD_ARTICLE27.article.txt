# Track and field at Penn Relays
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
While the Stanford track and
field team takes a week off to per
fect their racing techniques for the
biggest dual meet of the year versus
California, seven runners and high
jumper Travis Clark will compete
in the Penn Relays, held in
Philadelphia, Penn., Thursday
through Saturday.
Stanford already placed in this
prestigious meet during the early
rounds of competition yesterday.
Rhonda Oliver, Melissa Freeberg,
Dena Dey and Louise Watson
teamed up to finish sixth out of 30
teams in the distance medley relay.
Oliver, who has qualified for
the Pac-lOs in the 100 and 400-
meters, ran the 400 yesterday in
the first leg. She was followed by
Dey in the 800 and Freeberg in the

1320. Both middle-distance run
ners have qualified for the Pac-10
Finals in the 1500. Watson, who
posted an NCAA Championship
provisional time in the 3000 last
week, anchored the medley race in
the mile.
"You don't go to the Penn
Relays unless you're one of the best
in the nation," said assistant coach
Scott Chisam. "I figured we
wouldn't win this year, but we
wanted to go in there and set it up
so we can go back next year and win
it all."
Freeberg, Dey, Watson and new
comer Marjorie Hsu will have
another chance at a title today as
they take on the national field in
the 4 x 1500 relay.
In the individual events, Dave
Scudamore will try to return to the
NCAAs this year with a repeat per
formance in the 10,000. Last year,

the senior ran to a sixth-place finish
in the event at the Pac-lOs and an
1 lth-place showing at the NCAAs.
Senior Mike Reilly also has his
sights set on the NCAAs, as he will
compete in the 3000 steeplechase
for a trip to New Orleans.
However, on Saturday all eyes
will be focused on high jumper
Travis Clark, as he will attempt to
clear the NCAA-qualifying mark of
7 feet, 4 1/2 inches. Two weeks ago,
the sophomore cleared the provi
sional mark with a jump of 7-1 3/4.
Next week, the team will head
to the Chico Invitational as a tune
up for the upcoming Cal meet on
May 9.
"In reality, that is a preparation
for the Cal meet and a chance for us
to get more Pac-10 qualifying
times. Right now we're just trying
to hone our racing strategies and
improve our times," Chisam said.
