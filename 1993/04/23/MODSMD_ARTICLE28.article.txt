# Crew to row in Cal State regatta
## Men send novice boats, women varsity split into fours 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The California State Championships couldn't
have come at a better time for the Stanford crew
teams.
After the worst possible racing conditions in
last week's dual race against UC-Berkeley, the
varsity squads will gain some much-needed rest,
while the novices will have a rare opportunity to
compete for the Cardinal.
The men's crew will send its novice boats to
Sacramento to race against many of California's
smaller state schools.
Primarily a race to determine the top small
school crews in California, the varsity squad is
taking the week off.
Men's novice coach John Brenner plans to take
two eight-man boats and one four-man boat. The
top novice eight will race in the junior-varsity

category, while the other two boats will compete
in the novice category.
"For many of my guys, this is their first race,"
Brenner said. "The lower boats have been crank
ing like crazy this week in practice for their first
race."
Brenner said the main competition from the
field of schools featured in the Cal State race will
probably come from Santa Barbara or Davis.
Stanford's novices faced Santa Barbara earlier
this season, and beat them by 30 seconds. How
ever, the Cal State schools have geared their
practice schedule to peak at this race, while Stan
ford's schedule has the Cardinal peaking later in
the year.
Women's coach Wendy Davis plans to shuffle
the varsity lineup for Saturday's race, breaking
up the varsity eight into two boats of four to
comply with race rules.
"We were pretty humiliated
against Cal," Davis said. "Basical
ly, this weekend gives our varsity
a chance to beat up on the small
er schools."
This race will give a good indi
cation of what the future of Stan
ford women's crew will be, as the
novice boat faces Santa Barbara,
Irvine and Davis. All three of
these teams placed higher than
Stanford at the San Diego Crew

Classic earlier this month.
"The core of the team lies with
the novices," Davis said. "I hope
this race shows us that we're
heading in the right direction."
This weekend's regatta also
gives varsity rowers Kate Steger,
Cara Larson, Kristin Hubbard
and Larissa Cochron an extra
week to heal from injuries.
Larson took this week off
from practice with a back injury,
and Hubbard was only able to
practice one day as she battled
the flu. Davis is still unsure
about Steger and Cochron, who
are both suffering from back
injuries.
