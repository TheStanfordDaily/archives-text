# Baseball to battle with Wildcats
## Arizona brings hard-hitting team to Sunken Diamond 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Two years ago, a young and
inexperienced Arizona baseball
squad finished last in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
with a 10-20 conference record,
the worst in Jerry Kindall's 21-
year tenure as Wildcat coach.
Using the same nucleus of
players, Arizona won the Six-Pac
last season and is battling for the
conference title again this year.
Can connections be drawn
between the Wildcats of 1991 and
the 1993 Cardinal, another tal
ented, yet inexperienced squad?
"All the teams in the Six-Pac
go through a cyclical process,"
Kindall said. "I don't think that
anybody can maintain that veter
an core of players for more than
three or four years.
"Stanford definitely has some
very fine young talent, and I think
that young talent has gotten bet
ter over the five or six weeks since
we last faced them."
Stanford (30-28 overall, 6-12
Six-Pac) can prove Kindall's

words true this weekend. The
Cardinal faces the No. 11 Wild
cats (26-19, 13-11) at Sunken Dia
mond in a three-game set that
begins today at 2:30 p.m.
It was almost two months ago
that Stanford opened its Six-Pac
schedule by facing Arizona in
Tucson. The Cardinal had won 10
of 13 games to that point, but the
hard-hitting Wildcats scored 43
runs in sweeping three games
from Stanford.
"They're obviously a good hit
ting ball club," said Cardinal
righthander Willie Adams. "They
keep the ball out of the air."
Or is it that they put the ball
into the air? Arizona leads the
Six-Pac in home runs with 79,
and four Wildcats, George Arias,
Jason Thompson, Todd Landry
and Willie Morales, have already
reached double figures in long
balls. In fact, the 'Cats lead the
division in all three Triple Crown
categories, topping the charts in
batting average (.346) and runs
batted in (407) as well.

Freshman catcher A.J. Hlnch possesses some of the young talent the Cardinal hopes to tap in this
weekend's home series versus Arizona.
However, these impressive num
bers are inflated. Baseballs tend to
carry well at Arizona's high-altitude
Frank Sancet Field, and the stadi
um's power alleys are immense.
"They're good hitters, but
their place is also kind of known
as a launching pad," said Stan
ford pitcher Greg Mix.
The numbers back up Mix's
words. While the Wildcats score
an average of over 11 runs a game
at home, they average about
seven runs per game on the road.
"I think it's going to be a dif
ferent story playing them at
[Sunken Diamond]," Adams said.
It's been a different story at
home all season for Stanford. The
Cardinal is 13-5 on the year play
ing at Sunken Diamond, and
Adams and Andrew L6rraih£,'
Stanford's top two starting pitch
ers, are a combined 11-2 at home.
More encouraging than any
home-field advantage, though, is
the performance of the Cardinal
bullpen in recent weeks. In Tues
day's game at San Jose State, Dan
Reed and Mario Iglesias gave up
only two hits over the final four
innings, with Iglesias picking up
Stanford's first save of the season
in the 5-4 win.
"The last couple of weeks

we've had some good outings,"
Mix said. "But the pen really
came through on Tuesday, which
helps."
While an improved relief situa
tion certainly bodes well for Stan
ford, any late-season run by the
Cardinal must be accompanied by
an offensive surge. Stanford has
not scored more than six runs in a
game in almost two weeks.
"We put a few hits together
[against San Jose State], which
was nice," Adams said. "Although I
still think that we can play better."
Arizona's injury-depleted
pitching staff could prove to be
just the medicine Stanford's
struggling bats need. Wildcat
hurlers bring a 6.20 earned-run
average into this weekend.
"We score a lot of runs, but
we've got to fight like mad to keep
scoring them," Kindall said. "Our
pitching at times has been pretty
Stanford coacn Mark Mar
quess can sympathize with that
inconsistency. "We've had a hard
time all season doing all things
well in the same game," Marquess
said. "Sometimes we hit or pitch
or field well. We haven't been able
to put it all together."
Adams agreed. "We never real
ly know what kind of a team is
taking the field when we play,"
the pitcher said. "But I think
we're still capable of making the
playoffs."
