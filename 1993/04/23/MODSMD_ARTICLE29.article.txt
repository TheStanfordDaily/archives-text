# Baseball to battle with Wildcats
## Arizona brings hard-hitting team to Sunken Diamond 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Two years ago, a young and
inexperienced Arizona baseball
squad finished last in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
with a 10-20 conference record,
the worst in Jerry Kindall's 21-
year tenure as Wildcat coach.
Using the same nucleus of
players, Arizona won the Six-Pac
last season and is battling for the
conference title again this year.
Can connections be drawn
between the Wildcats of 1991 and
the 1993 Cardinal, another tal
ented, yet inexperienced squad?
"All the teams in the Six-Pac
go through a cyclical process,"
Kindall said. "I don't think that
anybody can maintain that veter
an core of players for more than
three or four years.
"Stanford definitely has some
very fine young talent, and I think
that young talent has gotten bet
ter over the five or six weeks since
we last faced them."
Stanford (30-28 overall, 6-12
Six-Pac) can prove Kindall's

words true this weekend. The
Cardinal faces the No. 11 Wild
cats (26-19, 13-11) at Sunken Dia
mond in a three-game set that
begins today at 2:30 p.m.
It was almost two months ago
that Stanford opened its Six-Pac
schedule by facing Arizona in
Tucson. The Cardinal had won 10
of 13 games to that point, but the
hard-hitting Wildcats scored 43
runs in sweeping three games
from Stanford.
"They're obviously a good hit
ting ball club," said Cardinal
righthander Willie Adams. "They
keep the ball out of the air."
Or is it that they put the ball
into the air? Arizona leads the
Six-Pac in home runs with 79,
and four Wildcats, George Arias,
Jason Thompson, Todd Landry
and Willie Morales, have already
reached double figures in long
balls. In fact, the 'Cats lead the
division in all three Triple Crown
categories, topping the charts in
batting average (.346) and runs
batted in (407) as well.

Freshman catcher A.J. Hlnch possesses some of the young talent the Cardinal hopes to tap in this
weekend's home series versus Arizona.
