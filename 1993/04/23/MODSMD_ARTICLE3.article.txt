# Caught between communities
## Conflicts challenge gay students of color 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
"I know it shouldn't be this
way, but I can't help feeling
caught between conflicting
identities."
For junior Natasha Iskan
dor, balancing her Egyptian-
American heritage with her
identity as a lesbian has always
been a challenge.
"Politically I think there are
a lot of complex reasons why
being Egyptian and a lesbian is
totally culturally unaccept
able," she said. Iskandor is
one of many gays, lesbians and
bisexuals of color who some
times find themselves feeling
split between their ethnic com
munities and the gay communi
ty
Now, however, Iskandor and
the other members of both
groups are becoming aware of
this possible conflict and are

taking steps toward its allevia
tion.
In recent years, campus eth
nic centers have initiated more
gay-inclusive programming,
while the gay and lesbian com
munity has begun to explore its
own cultural diversity.
And while these efforts have
not eliminated the tensions,
they have helped to break down
stereotypes and build a
stronger relationship between
the campus gay community and
Stanford's ethnic communities.
Understanding culture
Some gay students of color
say that understanding their
cultural background — and rec
ognizing both the similarities
and differences with the gay
culture — helps harmonize
their dual identity.
For example, "The strong
role the church has played in black culture
even from the time of slavery can make it
(coming out) difficult," says junior Say
deah Howard. "But some are able to rec
oncile being gay with being Christian."
Howard, who is active in both the gay
and black communities, points out that
the two cultures also share some common
ground, such as the role gays and lesbians
play in producing house and hip-hop
music.
"A lot of what people think of as 'black*
culture is really adopted from gay cul
ture," Howard says. "Like snapping —
black people snap at each other but really
that's both a black thing and a gay thing."
In other cultures, family expectations
can sometimes complicate the already
challenging process of coming out.
Iskandor says she sees lesbianism as a
threat to the central role of the extended
family in Egyptian culture. "Family is
where you have your most important
social ties and where a lot of your identity
comes from," she says.
But the same cultural beliefs that pro
duce such close extended families run
counter to the acceptance of lesbianism.
According to Iskandor, while the male
domination of Egyptian society makes les
bianism taboo, it also creates ideal circum
stances for building relationships between
women.
"Because there's a lot of male/female
segregation, the most important ties
women make are with other women.
There's a lot of affection and touching . ..
the boundaries get really fuzzy."
Iskandor explains that the prevalence

of family ties in Egyptian society makes
the isolation she faces more difficult. "I
value family — that's part of who I am.
It's a devastating loss to be alienated from
them," she says.
While Iskandor's family experiences
have made dealing with her sexuality
more painful, senior Bill Ho has found
that his family's expectations made grow
ing up easier.
"Many Asian families aren't really into
talking about personal things," says Ho.
"As long as you're a good student, it's easy
to get away with not going to prom or
being part of the big social scene."
Some individuals find that stereotypes
about cultural attitudes account for mis
understandings between the gay and eth
nic communities.
According to Troy Gilbert, advisor to
the Lesbian, Gay, and Bi-sexual Commu
nity Center, distinguishing actual atti
tudes from cultural stereotypes is crucial.
But Howard says she "did not find a lot
of the typical stereotypes within [her] own
community, in terms of the black commu
nity being more homophobic."
Similar stereotypes hinder the gay
community's image among students of
color. "Oftentimes we stereotype the gay
experience to be a gay, white-male experi
ence," Gilbert says."The gay experience is
a mixture of all kinds of ethnicities, cul
tural experiences, and quests for spiritual
ity."
The stereotypes, however, are slowly
being eroded. Many campus ethnic com
munities have recently been making con
scious efforts to become more aware and
inclusive of their gay, lesbian and bisexual
members.

'People making connections'
"Ethnic centers have made great
strides in cooperative programming,"
Gilbert notes. "It's important that people
realize all oppressions are very connect
ed."
Gilbert offers the example of the Black
Student Union organizing groups to make
statements at a rally after last year's Rod
ney King verdict. "They included the
Women's Center and the LGBCC — a
great example of people making those con
nections," he says.
El Centro Chicano — a campus center
often mentioned as being very gay-inclu
sive — sponsored a course on gay, lesbian
and bisexual poets during winter quarter,
and also helped bring lesbian Chicana poet
Gloria Anzaldua to campus last month as
a part of Women's Herstory Month.
"It's very important to let students
know we are a supportive community,"
says Frances Morales, director of El Cen
tro Chicano, adding that the effort to
reach out to gays, lesbians and bisexuals
within the community was entirely stu
dent-initiated.
Both El Centro and the Asian Ameri
can Student Association have sponsored
speaker panels to discuss the gay and les
bian experience from an ethnic perspec
tive. "Programs like that. . . are very valu
able to students," he says.
Aiesha Earls, office coordinator at the
Black House says she hopes the everyone
in the community feels welcome. "We are
a resource center, and the resources here
are here for the entire community."
In addition to the ethnic communities
reaching out to gays, the LGBCC will

begin making available resources that
approach being gay from an ethnic per
spective, according to Gilbert. "There's a
lot of literature out there and the LGBCC
needs to have that available."
'Opening doors'
The growing openness of the ethnic
and gay communities has also helped
some gays of color to feel less compelled to
choose between their gay and ethnic iden
tities.
"People have a tendency to force you to
make choices," says Karl Knapper, pro
gram administrator with the Martin
Luther King Papers Project. "Unfortu
nately, if you have multiple identities or
allegiances, you're forced to privilege one
over the other or put them in order of
predominance.
"Often gays and lesbians end up ulti
mately erasing our ethnic identities," he
adds.
Still, the "opening doors" between the
gay and ethnic communities give Knapper
a sense of hope for gays, lesbians, and
bisexuals of color.
As an undergraduate from 1977-1983,
Knapper was one of three gay black men
out at Stanford.
"Since I've graduated, several have
come out," he says. "They had decided at
Stanford to privilege their identity as a
student of color, and were worried about
rejection — so a lot of them chose to stay
in the closet."
Though Knapper was a member of both
the gay community and the black commu
nity at Stanford — he lived at Ujamaa for
four years — Knapper says it was "stress
ful trying to straddle both communities."

But in the last few years, he says
"there has been a rebirth within the
African-American gay, lesbian, bisexual
community. There has been a real
attempt to build a community and a his
tory together."
While strides toward greater inclusion
are being made, Knapper says it is still
important that the entire Stanford com
munity's consciousness about racism and
sexuality continues to be raised.
"Racism goes on here just like any
where else," says Iskandor.
And dating "works the same way as in
the heterosexual community," says
Howard. "People are sometimes reluctant
to date people of other ethnicities." How
ever, she added, there are also specific
support groups to help cross-ethnic gay
couples overcome any cultural obstruc
tions.
Knapper suggests that members from
gay and ethnic communities should both
assume responsibility for breaking down
barriers.
"In gay communities people need to
realize that there are gays and lesbians of
color and we're not taking a back seat
anymore," he says. "Also, various ethnic
communities need to be open to the fact
that gays and lesbians have every right to
be part of both communities."
Howard has worked hard to make this
ideal a reality. "I think I have a good rela
tionship with my ethnic community,"
Howard says."I have a strong network of
black friends and a strong network of
queer friends.
"I've found that you can be involved in
both communities to whatever degree you
want to be involved."
"I know it shouldn't be this
way, but I can't help feeling
caught between conflicting
identities."
For junior Natasha Iskan

American heritage with her

speaker panels to discuss the gay and les
bian experience from an ethnic perspec
tive. "Programs like that. . . are very valu
able to students," he says.
Aiesha Earls, office coordinator at the
Black House says she hopes the everyone
in the community feels welcome. "We are
a resource center, and the resources here
are here for the entire community."
In addition to the ethnic communities
reaching out to gays, the LGBCC will

begin making available resources that
approach being gay from an ethnic per
spective, according to Gilbert. "There's a
lot of literature out there and the LGBCC
needs to have that available."
'Opening doors'
The growing openness of the ethnic
and gay communities has also helped
some gays of color to feel less compelled to
choose between their gay and ethnic iden
tities.
"People have a tendency to force you to
make choices," says Karl Knapper, pro
gram administrator with the Martin
Luther King Papers Project. "Unfortu
nately, if you have multiple identities or
allegiances, you're forced to privilege one
over the other or put them in order of
predominance.
"Often gays and lesbians end up ulti
mately erasing our ethnic identities," he
adds.
Still, the "opening doors" between the
gay and ethnic communities give Knapper
a sense of hope for gays, lesbians, and
bisexuals of color.
As an undergraduate from 1977-1983,
Knapper was one of three gay black men
out at Stanford.
"Since I've graduated, several have
come out," he says. "They had decided at
Stanford to privilege their identity as a
student of color, and were worried about
rejection — so a lot of them chose to stay
in the closet."
Though Knapper was a member of both
the gay community and the black commu
nity at Stanford — he lived at Ujamaa for
four years — Knapper says it was "stress
ful trying to straddle both communities."

But in the last few years, he says
"there has been a rebirth within the
African-American gay, lesbian, bisexual
community. There has been a real
attempt to build a community and a his
tory together."
While strides toward greater inclusion
are being made, Knapper says it is still
important that the entire Stanford com
munity's consciousness about racism and
sexuality continues to be raised.
"Racism goes on here just like any
where else," says Iskandor.
And dating "works the same way as in
the heterosexual community," says
Howard. "People are sometimes reluctant
to date people of other ethnicities." How
ever, she added, there are also specific
support groups to help cross-ethnic gay
couples overcome any cultural obstruc
tions.
Knapper suggests that members from
gay and ethnic communities should both
assume responsibility for breaking down
barriers.
"In gay communities people need to
realize that there are gays and lesbians of
color and we're not taking a back seat
anymore," he says. "Also, various ethnic
communities need to be open to the fact
that gays and lesbians have every right to
be part of both communities."
Howard has worked hard to make this
ideal a reality. "I think I have a good rela
tionship with my ethnic community,"
Howard says."I have a strong network of
black friends and a strong network of
queer friends.
"I've found that you can be involved in
both communities to whatever degree you
want to be involved."
"I know it shouldn't be this
way, but I can't help feeling
caught between conflicting
identities."
For junior Natasha Iskan
dor, balancing her Egyptian-
American heritage with her
identity as a lesbian has always
been a challenge.
"Politically I think there are
a lot of complex reasons why
being Egyptian and a lesbian is
totally culturally unaccept
able," she said. Iskandor is
one of many gays, lesbians and
bisexuals of color who some
times find themselves feeling
split between their ethnic com
munities and the gay communi
ty
Now, however, Iskandor and
the other members of both
groups are becoming aware of
this possible conflict and are

taking steps toward its allevia
tion.
In recent years, campus eth
nic centers have initiated more
gay-inclusive programming,
while the gay and lesbian com
munity has begun to explore its
own cultural diversity.
And while these efforts have
not eliminated the tensions,
they have helped to break down
stereotypes and build a
stronger relationship between
the campus gay community and
Stanford's ethnic communities.
Understanding culture
Some gay students of color
say that understanding their
cultural background — and rec
ognizing both the similarities
and differences with the gay
culture — helps harmonize
their dual identity.
For example, "The strong
role the church has played in black culture
even from the time of slavery can make it
(coming out) difficult," says junior Say
deah Howard. "But some are able to rec
oncile being gay with being Christian."
Howard, who is active in both the gay
and black communities, points out that
the two cultures also share some common
ground, such as the role gays and lesbians
play in producing house and hip-hop
music.
"A lot of what people think of as 'black*
culture is really adopted from gay cul
ture," Howard says. "Like snapping —
black people snap at each other but really
that's both a black thing and a gay thing."
In other cultures, family expectations
can sometimes complicate the already
challenging process of coming out.
Iskandor says she sees lesbianism as a
threat to the central role of the extended
family in Egyptian culture. "Family is
where you have your most important
social ties and where a lot of your identity
comes from," she says.
But the same cultural beliefs that pro
duce such close extended families run
counter to the acceptance of lesbianism.
According to Iskandor, while the male
domination of Egyptian society makes les
bianism taboo, it also creates ideal circum
stances for building relationships between
women.
"Because there's a lot of male/female
segregation, the most important ties
women make are with other women.
There's a lot of affection and touching . ..
the boundaries get really fuzzy."
Iskandor explains that the prevalence

of family ties in Egyptian society makes
the isolation she faces more difficult. "I
value family — that's part of who I am.
It's a devastating loss to be alienated from
them," she says.
While Iskandor's family experiences
have made dealing with her sexuality
more painful, senior Bill Ho has found
that his family's expectations made grow
ing up easier.
"Many Asian families aren't really into
talking about personal things," says Ho.
"As long as you're a good student, it's easy
to get away with not going to prom or
being part of the big social scene."
Some individuals find that stereotypes
about cultural attitudes account for mis
understandings between the gay and eth
nic communities.
According to Troy Gilbert, advisor to
the Lesbian, Gay, and Bi-sexual Commu
nity Center, distinguishing actual atti
tudes from cultural stereotypes is crucial.
But Howard says she "did not find a lot
of the typical stereotypes within [her] own
community, in terms of the black commu
nity being more homophobic."
Similar stereotypes hinder the gay
community's image among students of
color. "Oftentimes we stereotype the gay
experience to be a gay, white-male experi
ence," Gilbert says."The gay experience is
a mixture of all kinds of ethnicities, cul
tural experiences, and quests for spiritual
ity."
The stereotypes, however, are slowly
being eroded. Many campus ethnic com
munities have recently been making con
scious efforts to become more aware and
inclusive of their gay, lesbian and bisexual
members.

'People making connections'
"Ethnic centers have made great
strides in cooperative programming,"
Gilbert notes. "It's important that people
realize all oppressions are very connect
ed."
Gilbert offers the example of the Black
Student Union organizing groups to make
statements at a rally after last year's Rod
ney King verdict. "They included the
Women's Center and the LGBCC — a
great example of people making those con
nections," he says.
El Centro Chicano — a campus center
often mentioned as being very gay-inclu
sive — sponsored a course on gay, lesbian
and bisexual poets during winter quarter,
and also helped bring lesbian Chicana poet
Gloria Anzaldua to campus last month as
a part of Women's Herstory Month.
"It's very important to let students
know we are a supportive community,"
says Frances Morales, director of El Cen
tro Chicano, adding that the effort to
reach out to gays, lesbians and bisexuals
within the community was entirely stu
dent-initiated.
Both El Centro and the Asian Ameri
can Student Association have sponsored
speaker panels to discuss the gay and les
bian experience from an ethnic perspec
tive. "Programs like that. . . are very valu
able to students," he says.
Aiesha Earls, office coordinator at the
