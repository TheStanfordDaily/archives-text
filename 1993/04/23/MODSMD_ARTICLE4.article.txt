# Student publications lack adequate funds
## Constraints limit new ventures, older press 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
With one of Stanford's largest student
publications facing bankruptcy and anoth
er severely cutting back, leaders of many
campus publications are anxiously waiting
for the ASSU Senate to allocate additional
funding to bolster the Publications Board.
Stifled by a lack of resources and a
greater number of publications asking for
funds this year, campus editors say the
board has been rendered somewhat ineffi
cacious.
"The funding has dropped from last
year," said Rich Barnett, editor of the Stan
ford Journal of International Affairs. "Lots
of publications are starting out — people
are trying to create literary works and
aren't getting enough funding."
The board, which had budget of $50,383
this year, is responsible for funding student
groups that want to print publications. In
addition, the board is to provide computer
and other equipment for the groups to use.
But this year, broken-down equipment
has exacerbated funding constraints, forc
ing several publications such as Dialtone
and Release —which is close to bankruptcy
— to stop printing.
In addition, the Stanford Review is now
coming out every other week — instead of
weekly — this quarter. Although Rick St.
John, the Review's editor in chief, admitted
that a publication slowdown is a common
problem for his newspaper, he said "the sit
uation has been worse this year."

Because computers in the Storke Stu
dent Publications Building are inadequate,
the board has incurred the additional ex
penses of sending publications to outside
typesetters and printers.
"This takes money away from other
publications," said senior Tammie Ed
wards, the board's chair. "It's really one of
our biggest problems."
Not only are the board's coffers drained,
but the computer difficulties have added to
both aggravation and student labor costs.
Because there are currently only two work
ing computers in the office, the Review and
other groups often must produce their pub
lications late at night and early in the
morning in order to avoid conflicts with
other groups.
"There is a lot of pressure on the editors
because of the limitations on equipment,"
said Matt Kelso, the Review's news editor.
"The computers crash all the time and
make it difficult to run a tight schedule."
"Publication costs have gone up," added
St. John. "We have to pay people to work
longer hours."
Students are hoping to find a panacea in
a funding reallocation proposal that will
come before the senate May 4. The plan re
quests the senate to allow the board to use
$14,880 of its $35,000 reserve to purchase
new equipment.
Since the reserve money is tied to the
ASSU's investment funds, a reallocation
needs the senate's approval.
Some publications' leaders,
however, are skeptical of the pro
posal's success in the senate
because the board's reserve
account is held by the ASSU and
the interest generated goes to the
ASSU's general fund. "They have
no incentive to allow the money to
be spent," Review Managing Editor
Steve Russell said.
"Why is it that when students
choose to allocate money to an
account, it isn't spent and sits in a
fund earning interest for the
ASSU?" he asked.
In the past, the senate has often
denied and altered requests for
equipment. "What's happened is
that the senate has nickeled and
dimed the Publications Board and
changed their requests," said Rus
sell.
"They buy us equipment that
we can't possibly use — like a 12-
inch color monitor," he said. "That
is useless for laying out a paper like
the Review."
Edwards also stressed that pas
sage of the request in its present

form is vital. "It will pay for itself in
the long run," she said.
Because of the costs involved in
sending publications to outside
typesetters, the new equipment —
which would make this unneces
sary — has the potential to signifi
cantly decrease groups' expendi
tures on making publications.

'The bottom line is
that we need this
equipment badly.'
— Tammie Edwards

"Typesetting costs would be
gone," said Russell. "Right now,
the Publications Board has to sub
sidize its lack of equipment . i..
It's a waste of money."
Because a large sum has been
spent this year on unforeseen addi
tional expenses like outside type
setting, many fear that the senate
will deny the proposal, claiming
that too much money is being
spent by the board already.
"The bottom line is that we need

this equipment badly," said
Edwards. "It's not the solution to
all of our problems, but it is an
important part of making the Pub
lications Board work."
Even if the proposal passes, the
student publications aren't com
pletely out of the woods.
Because large publications such
as the Review occupy the space in
the Storke Building funded by the
board, other smaller groups often
must struggle to find working
space.
Although Barnett's quarterly
publication has little need for the
office space, he said several small
groups must use the office at some
time because it is the only place on
campus where computers are
available for the sole use of publi
cations.
This can cause problems when
another, larger publication needs
the office. "We need a reallocation
of available space," said Russell.
"This should happen through an
independent audit."
Despite such complaints, the
board's first priority remains fund
ing. "The focus now is on the
basics," said Edwards. "It's hard to
do everything at once."

typesetters, the new equipment —
which would make this unneces
sary — has the potential to signifi
cantly decrease groups' expendi
tures on making publications.

'The bottom line is
that we need this
equipment badly.'
— Tammie Edwards

"Typesetting costs would be
gone," said Russell. "Right now,
the Publications Board has to sub
sidize its lack of equipment . i..
It's a waste of money."
Because a large sum has been
spent this year on unforeseen addi
tional expenses like outside type
setting, many fear that the senate
will deny the proposal, claiming
that too much money is being
spent by the board already.
"The bottom line is that we need

this equipment badly," said
Edwards. "It's not the solution to
all of our problems, but it is an
important part of making the Pub
lications Board work."
Even if the proposal passes, the
student publications aren't com
pletely out of the woods.
Because large publications such
as the Review occupy the space in
the Storke Building funded by the
board, other smaller groups often
must struggle to find working
space.
Although Barnett's quarterly
publication has little need for the
office space, he said several small
groups must use the office at some
time because it is the only place on
campus where computers are
available for the sole use of publi
cations.
This can cause problems when
another, larger publication needs
the office. "We need a reallocation
of available space," said Russell.
"This should happen through an
independent audit."
Despite such complaints, the
board's first priority remains fund
ing. "The focus now is on the
basics," said Edwards. "It's hard to
do everything at once."
