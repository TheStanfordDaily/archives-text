# Student publications lack adequate funds
## Constraints limit new ventures, older press 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
With one of Stanford's largest student
publications facing bankruptcy and anoth
er severely cutting back, leaders of many
campus publications are anxiously waiting
for the ASSU Senate to allocate additional
funding to bolster the Publications Board.
Stifled by a lack of resources and a
greater number of publications asking for
funds this year, campus editors say the
board has been rendered somewhat ineffi
cacious.
"The funding has dropped from last
year," said Rich Barnett, editor of the Stan
ford Journal of International Affairs. "Lots
of publications are starting out — people
are trying to create literary works and
aren't getting enough funding."
The board, which had budget of $50,383
this year, is responsible for funding student
groups that want to print publications. In
addition, the board is to provide computer
and other equipment for the groups to use.
But this year, broken-down equipment
has exacerbated funding constraints, forc
ing several publications such as Dialtone
and Release —which is close to bankruptcy
— to stop printing.
In addition, the Stanford Review is now
coming out every other week — instead of
weekly — this quarter. Although Rick St.
John, the Review's editor in chief, admitted
that a publication slowdown is a common
problem for his newspaper, he said "the sit
uation has been worse this year."

Because computers in the Storke Stu
dent Publications Building are inadequate,
the board has incurred the additional ex
penses of sending publications to outside
typesetters and printers.
"This takes money away from other
publications," said senior Tammie Ed
wards, the board's chair. "It's really one of
our biggest problems."
Not only are the board's coffers drained,
but the computer difficulties have added to
both aggravation and student labor costs.
Because there are currently only two work
ing computers in the office, the Review and
other groups often must produce their pub
lications late at night and early in the
morning in order to avoid conflicts with
other groups.
"There is a lot of pressure on the editors
because of the limitations on equipment,"
said Matt Kelso, the Review's news editor.
"The computers crash all the time and
make it difficult to run a tight schedule."
"Publication costs have gone up," added
St. John. "We have to pay people to work
longer hours."
Students are hoping to find a panacea in
a funding reallocation proposal that will
come before the senate May 4. The plan re
quests the senate to allow the board to use
$14,880 of its $35,000 reserve to purchase
new equipment.
Since the reserve money is tied to the
ASSU's investment funds, a reallocation
needs the senate's approval.
