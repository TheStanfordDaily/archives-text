## Fake IDs prevalent on campus 
### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
They're sold at flea markets, in biker
magazines, in novelty shops — and in
dorms near you.
Fake identification cards are noth
ing new at Stanford, but they're not
going away, either. The administration
fears them, the police hate them —
and students continue to buy, use and
even manufacture them, though most
say they don't really need them after
all.
While several groups and individuals
have been caught over the years, none
of the University administrators inter
viewed dared venture a guess as to how
many fake IDs are currently in use on
campus.
The number varies from year to year
"depending on the ingenuity of the stu

dents," said Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn.
The most recent case involved a stu
dent who was caught manufacturing
and selling fake IDs in a four-class cam
pus residence last year.
"We had the sense that over a hun
dred IDs have been made and sold on
campus," Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said. "That's a lot."
This case and many others over the
past decade have involved what Dunn
calls "group projects," in which stu
dents in a particular residence or stu
dent group band together to make or
buy IDs.
"Ted," for example, bought his fake
Arizona driver's license with a group of
about 30 men in his freshman dorm.
Two other residents took photos of fel
low students next to a mock-up board
— a cut-out of a giant license — selling

the IDs for $40 each.
According to Ted, it was money well
spent. He's never been caught using
the ID, whether on campus or at local
nightspots such as Miyake's. But he ad
mits that he doesn't use it often — Ted
doesn't get carded much. Besides, "the
picture's not very good," he said.
Although "Sally" bought her fake ID
on campus, she's never used it there.
Instead, she uses it to get into night
clubs in San Francisco. The Oregon li
cense has Sally's real name, picture and
vital statistics with a false Oregon ad
dress.
Although she's used the ID several
times in San Francisco, Sally has only
been caught once — at a Palo Alto
liquor store.
"The guys who made it told us not to
