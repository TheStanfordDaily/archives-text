## Fake IDs prevalent on campus 
### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
They're sold at flea markets, in biker
magazines, in novelty shops — and in
dorms near you.
Fake identification cards are noth
ing new at Stanford, but they're not
going away, either. The administration
fears them, the police hate them —
and students continue to buy, use and
even manufacture them, though most
say they don't really need them after
all.
While several groups and individuals
have been caught over the years, none
of the University administrators inter
viewed dared venture a guess as to how
many fake IDs are currently in use on
campus.
The number varies from year to year
"depending on the ingenuity of the stu

dents," said Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn.
The most recent case involved a stu
dent who was caught manufacturing
and selling fake IDs in a four-class cam
pus residence last year.
"We had the sense that over a hun
dred IDs have been made and sold on
campus," Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said. "That's a lot."
This case and many others over the
past decade have involved what Dunn
calls "group projects," in which stu
dents in a particular residence or stu
dent group band together to make or
buy IDs.
"Ted," for example, bought his fake
Arizona driver's license with a group of
about 30 men in his freshman dorm.
Two other residents took photos of fel
low students next to a mock-up board
— a cut-out of a giant license — selling

the IDs for $40 each.
According to Ted, it was money well
spent. He's never been caught using
the ID, whether on campus or at local
nightspots such as Miyake's. But he ad
mits that he doesn't use it often — Ted
doesn't get carded much. Besides, "the
picture's not very good," he said.
Although "Sally" bought her fake ID
on campus, she's never used it there.
Instead, she uses it to get into night
clubs in San Francisco. The Oregon li
cense has Sally's real name, picture and
vital statistics with a false Oregon ad
dress.
Although she's used the ID several
times in San Francisco, Sally has only
been caught once — at a Palo Alto
liquor store.
"The guys who made it told us not to
use it very much in this area, like at
Safeway," she said. The store man
ager let her off with a warning, but
from now on Sally plans to do her
shopping in the city.
Home sweet Oregon
The mock-up board is only one
of many ways to manufacture a
phony ID. Rut fake IDs of all types
have certain elements in common,
according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
They usually come from under
populated or faraway states such
as Oregon, Arizona and Missouri.
They have certain flaws in photo
quality, typeface or composition,
and are easily detected by trained
officers. Forty dollars is the going
rate for a fake ID, according to stu
dents interviewed. And on campus,
they all seem to work.
Even the least common (and
least convincing) form of fake IDs
— genuine IDs with altered birth
dates or pictures — are accepted in
certain establishments.
"Matt," for example, manually
altered the birthdate on his own
New York driver's license.
Although it "looks really bad,"
Matt says the license has worked at
the Coffee House.
"I've never been carded any
where else," he said.
No typical punishment
Because fake ID users and man
ufacturers are rarely caught,
"there is no typical punishment,"
said Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole.
"At Stanford, we try to have an
atmosphere of trust," Jackson said,
summarizing the University's poli
cy on fake IDs. "We're concerned
about safety.... When a lot of peo
ple do this, it can breed a corrupt
ing environment, particularly if
people in one residence do it. The
attitude is, 'If we can get away with
it, it's okay.'"
However, the University does
take "it pretty seriously," especial
ly in the case of manufacturing
fake IDs, which is considered a vio
lation of the Fundamental Stan
dard, Cole said. The student
caught manufacturing IDs last
year was suspended for a year.
The police take fake IDs serious
ly, too. According to Niemeyer, pos

session of a fake ID is a misde
meanor, and can warrant fines, jail
time, community service and up to
three years probation. The produc
tion of fake IDs or falsifying an ID
application is a felony. In addition,
anyone under 18 caught using a
fake ID can lose driving privileges.
Although the University and
the Stanford Police do not share
records, they refer cases to each
other. If the offense violates the
Fundamental Standard, the case is
also reported to the Judicial Affairs
office. A larger operation will be
turned over to DMV fraud investi
gators, who in turn report viola
tions to the district attorney.
But Jackson said that most
cases are referred to his office by
students, rather than the police or
residence staffs.
"There are some students who
don't approve of this kind of activi
ty," he said.
Risky business
Despite the risks, many stu
dents seem unconcerned about
being caught. Most of those inter
viewed said they did not know it
was a crime to possess a fake ID,
and few admitted they had thought
about disciplinary consequences.
"I don't do anything seriously
illegal with it, like try to vote
twice," one student said.
Dunn said this nonchalance is
typical of college students, and
potentially, very dangerous.
"The students don't realize the
consequences of producing and
possessing fake IDs," she said.
"You don't consider consequences
when you're hoping to get a beer."
The University has mandated
that, if alcohol is served at a cam
pus event, there must be an ID
check. Usually, wristbands are
given to students over 21.
Dunn said the importance of
actually checking IDs is empha
sized over techniques for spotting
fake IDs. But groups do receive "a
limited amount of training" in rec
ognizing — and dealing with —
fakes.
"If you recognize a fake ID, you
can turn that person in or refuse to
serve them," Dunn said. She added
that the latter option is preferable
because it allows students "to be
non-confrontational and still pro
tect themselves."
Despite these precautions, how

ever, students say they usually
don't need fake IDs to get alcohol
on campus.
"No one checks IDs at parties,"
one student said.
On those rare occasions when
IDs are checked, "you can always
get someone else to get you a cup,"
said another student.
"Or else you have to know some
body who's serving," another stu
dent added.
Duping the DMV
Rather than risk being caught
with a forged ID, some students
opt for the genuine article — real
IDs, illegally obtained.
According to Roddy Rodriguez,
the supervisor at Department of
Motor Vehicles investigations
office in San Jose, there are two
ways of getting genuine IDs that
contain false information.
The first involves source docu
ments — such as birth certificates,
employee IDs and passports —
that are either borrowed or falsi
fied. But Rodriguez warns that
DMV workers are trained to spot
illegitimate documents.
"Generally, when people come
in here with a false or borrowed
birth certificate, the customer may
walk out with a temporary ID, but
someone will catch the forgery and
refer it to us," he said.
"Jennifer" found this out the
hard way when she tried to apply
for an ID using her older sister's
birth certificate.
"The guy at the DMV acted real
ly suspicious," she said. "He tried
to trip me up — he asked me if I'd
ever gotten a ticket in Oregon. I
didn't know what to say."
Rather than issuing a temporary
ID, the agent told Jennifer that
there was a problem and he'd have
to get back to her. He never did.
"I was so shaken up, I decided
I'd never drink again," Jennifer
said. "It's not worth it."
The second method of obtaining
a legitimate ID is borrowing one
from someone with similar fea
tures. But this practice also has
drawbacks. Often, an ID will carry
a good likeness, but telling infor
mation such as height and eye color
may be obviously incorrect.
There are additional safeguards
built into the application process.
Along with a birth certificate, social
security card and $6, California

driver's license applicants must
submit a thumb-print, which can
later be compared to that of the
ID's bearer if mischief is suspected.
While Rodriguez admits that
"the system is not foolproof," it's
getting ever closer as technology
improves. Soon, he said, computers
will carry digitized records of the
thumb-prints, which will prevent
ID-seekers from applying twice
under two different names.
In California, hard-to-reproduce
hologram licences and IDs will be
completely phased-in within eight
years. Again, the new cards are not
completely foolproof, but with
magnetic strips and holographic
images, they come close.
"Let's put it this way: we
haven't run across one that's been
successfully reproduced," Rod
riguez said.
Because California IDs are
harder to counterfeit than other
states, many local bars won't let
young people in without a Califor
nia license, Niemeyer added.
Caught at the CoHo
While not exactly a bar, the Cof
fee House has equally strict policies
regarding the sale and distribution
of alcohol.

All customers who plan to drink
at the Coffee House must produce
identification at the counter and
don a wristband. For the past three
months, security personnel hired
especially for the task have
patrolled the establishment,
enforcing the policy.
Night Manager Damir Zekhtser
sees — and confiscates — fake IDs
"every single night."
While the security measures
have effectively reduced underage
drinking, spotting fake IDs is "dif
ficult because most of the people
who work here are students,"
Zekhtser said. Employees may be
reluctant to confiscate their peers'
IDs, or unsure of how to spot a
fake, he added.
But "everybody knows that if
they have any sort of question
regarding an ID, they can always go
to a manager with more experience
and training," Zekhtser said. The
Coffee House also has an updated
catalog of U.S. driver's licences for
handy, on-the-spot reference.
While Zekhtser sympathizes
with underage students who want
to drink, he takes the problem of
fake IDs very seriously.
"If a problem like tliis got out of
hand, there would be no Coffee

House," he said. "Students would
be losing much more than just
drinking."
"Annette" found out just how
seriously the Coffee House takes
the fake ID problem when she was
caught using a friend's ID there.
"I figured if it would work any
where, it would work at the Coffee
House," she said.
A server confiscated the ID after
questioning Annette about her zip
code. She finally "begged" the serv
er to return it, explaining that it
belonged to a friend and promising
to "never use it there again."
According to Zekhtser, bor
rowed IDs are usually returned to
their owners, "but they have to
come in to claim them. When they
do, we'll have a little conversation
with them about that practice."
Although Annette has since
used the borrowed-ID trick suc
cessfully elsewhere, she's "scared"
to try it again at the Coffee House.
"[The server! said he'd report
me if he saw me drinking there
again," she said.
But Zekhtser hasn't had to
report anyone yet, and doubts he
ever will.
"No one's really that gung-ho
about drinking," he said.
