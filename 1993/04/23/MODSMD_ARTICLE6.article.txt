## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
In a symbolic exchange of bread for water, UC-
Berkeley students formally passed along a seven
day hunger strike to more than 50 Stanford stu
dents at a rally in the Law School yesterday after
noon.
The fast is being held in protest of the 199 HlV
positive Haitian refugees trapped in U.S. military
installations in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Nancy Laleau and Saman Dashti, two protesters
from Berkeley, said fasting was not a difficult task.
"This fast was easy for us," said Dashti. "Everytime
you hear your stomach growl, you think, 'Would I
rather be here, or in Guantanamo?' "
Laleau said a week of drinking gourmet fruit and
vegetable juices was an easy way to protest when put
into context of the situation. "Haiti has always been
hidden from view," she said. "We hope our protest
will show the scandal of all the institutions in our
nation."
Both protesters said they felt the refugees were
being denied access into the United States because
of their HIV-positive status. "Due to our igno
rance," said Dashti, "we have the lives of 200 people
in our hands. HIV is not a crime, but we have pa
tients doing time."
Once the fast had been passed to Stanford stu
dents, several speakers voiced their opinions on the
refugee situation.

director who was an eyewitness to the Haitian coup,

related some of the horrors he
saw when he arrived in Port au
Prince two days after the coup
began. Upon visiting a hospital,
Pina met a 68-year-old woman
who had been the victim of a
drive-by shooting. "She woke up
in a pool of her own blood and
found that she had been shot
while she slept," he said.
"I must say that the Haitian

army is more than capable of that
level of barbarity," he said.
In contrast, Pina described the
student and faculty protesters as
"guiding beacons to justice" and
congratulated the Law School for
organizing the event.
Dahlia Lithwick, a first-year
law student, said she began fast
ing after being reminded of the
"ugliness of humans .. . Our ugli
ness is in saying nothing and
thinking it is OK."
Lithwick said she has no qualms
about fasting and is doing it in
order to tell President Clinton to

keep his promises and "do the right
thing and the humane thing."
During the speeches, protest
organizers circulated petitions to
Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno, urging them to free
the refugees.
Law student Susan Callender,
a strike organizer, urged poten
tial fasters to drink a lot of water
and monitor themselves careful
ly. "We don't want a lot of people
passing-out here," she said.
The fast will last until next
Wednesday, when it is passed on
to students at UC-Santa Cruz.
