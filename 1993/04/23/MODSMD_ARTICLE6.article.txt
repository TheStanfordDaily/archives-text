In a symbolic exchange of bread for water, UC-
Berkeley students formally passed along a seven
day hunger strike to more than 50 Stanford stu
dents at a rally in the Law School yesterday after
noon.
The fast is being held in protest of the 199 HlV
positive Haitian refugees trapped in U.S. military
installations in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Nancy Laleau and Saman Dashti, two protesters
from Berkeley, said fasting was not a difficult task.
"This fast was easy for us," said Dashti. "Everytime
you hear your stomach growl, you think, 'Would I
rather be here, or in Guantanamo?' "
Laleau said a week of drinking gourmet fruit and
vegetable juices was an easy way to protest when put
into context of the situation. "Haiti has always been
hidden from view," she said. "We hope our protest
will show the scandal of all the institutions in our
nation."
Both protesters said they felt the refugees were
being denied access into the United States because
of their HIV-positive status. "Due to our igno
rance," said Dashti, "we have the lives of 200 people
in our hands. HIV is not a crime, but we have pa
tients doing time."
Once the fast had been passed to Stanford stu
dents, several speakers voiced their opinions on the
refugee situation.
