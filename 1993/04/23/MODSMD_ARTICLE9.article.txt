## Conference examines community outreach programs 
### Dina Updegraff 
Improving communication between universi
ties and their neighboring communities will be
the focus of tomorrow's lOth-annual You Can
Make a Difference Conference.
According to conference planner Kara Imm,
organizers "really wanted to reach out into the
community." While many Stanford students talk
about helping the community and even take class
es on public policy, Imm said, "It is important as
university students to make our experiences more
real."
Organizers chose the topic "Bridging the Gap
Between Town and Gown" primarily in response
to the recent Rodney King trials, said Imm, the
conference's fundraising and logistics chair.
One issue the conference hopes to address is
the conflict between Stanford volunteers' goals
and East Palo Alto's needs. Too often individuals
with good intentions go into communities with
out consulting them, said Imm. The conference is
trying to alleviate this problem by facilitating
communication between Stanford and East Palo
Alto.
Once students know what the community
needs, they will be able to help them more effi
ciently, Imm said. In addition, she said the rela
tionship with East Palo Alto can be reciprocal:
East Palo Alto has a wealth of knowledge to con
tribute to Stanford, she said.
Imm said that one goal is to identify the
strengths found among Stanford students and

then find a way of using them to help the commu
nity.
A large part of the day will be devoted to work
shops on a wide range of topics including the local
economy, low-income housing and health care.
For example, one workshop will address the
responsibilities, if any, that the Stanford Medical
Center has to the community. Another will evalu
ate the effectiveness of outreach programs begun
by universities throughout California as a result
of the King verdict.
"I think the conference has a lot of diverse per
spectives from the University and the different
communities," said conference co-chair Jason
Snyder.
University President Gerhard Casper will
deliver the conference's welcoming address. Other
participants include Rep. Anna Eshoo, East Palo
Alto Mayor Sharifa Wilson and Haas Center
Director Catherine Milton, who is currently serv
ing as director of the Commission on National and
Community Service. George McKenna 111, super
intendent of Inglewood unified school district in
Los Angeles, will deliver the closing keynote
address.
After attending the conference, participants
will have an opportunity to practice what they've
learned this weekend through pre-arranged pub
lic service projects in nearby cities. Some of the
programs include serving meals to the homeless
and visiting with senior citizens.
Admission to the all-day conference is free for
Stanford students.
