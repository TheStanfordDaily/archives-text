SCHOOL OF THE ARTS
Spring Semester in Film for Visiting Students
"As a media arts and science major at MIT, I was
lacking hands-on filmmaking experience, and the
semester at Tisch fit right in with what I needed."
— David Kung
David, now a senior at MIT, was working with interactive
video and found it was difficult to think about films of
the future without knowing the filmmaking process.
"At Tisch, I learned about every aspect — writing, cast
ing, shooting, directing, and editing. I did everything!"
David's new understanding of film has been very valu
able to his work with video. "The Tisch program fulfilled
my expectations and much more; it was an amazing
experience."
Each spring, we offer students of all educational back
grounds the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of
filmmaking at the Tisch School's renowned Department
of Film and Television. During an intensive one-semester
program, you can immerse yourself in the study of film
while living in the heart of Greenwich Village.
