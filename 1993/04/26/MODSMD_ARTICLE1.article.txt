## Co-ops campaign to inform campus, increase interest 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Faced with steadily declining
popularity, campus co-ops have
initiated an outreach campaign to
drum up student interest before
this year's Draw.
Under pressure from Residen
tial Education, members of Stan
ford's seven cooperative resi
dences have taken steps — such as
scheduling informational meet
ings in various dorms around
campus this week — to increase
student awareness about co-op
life.
Many co-op residents believe
communal living has definite ad
vantages over dorm life, from a
closer-knit community to a signif
icantly lower board bill, and they
want to get this message across.
"Co-ops would be good for a lot
of people who don't like dorms —
they just aren't aware of it," said
junior Carl Goldschmidt, house
manager at the Enchanted Broc
coli Forest and Co-op Outreach
Motivator.
Students living in co-ops do
their own cooking and cleaning,
distributing chores among house
members and non-resident eating
associates.
Pushed by Residential Educa
tion Assoc. Director Diana Con
klin, the co-ops been have work
ing together on this project for the
past few months and have pro
duced a 10-page guide for the
spring housing lottery, containing
information on each house and a
chart summarizing how they com
pare.
Co-op members hope that the
information will dispel many of
the negative rumors about the
houses and show people what co
op life is really like, Goldschmidt
