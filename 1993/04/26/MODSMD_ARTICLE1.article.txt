## Co-ops campaign to inform campus, increase interest 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Faced with steadily declining
popularity, campus co-ops have
initiated an outreach campaign to
drum up student interest before
this year's Draw.
Under pressure from Residen
tial Education, members of Stan
ford's seven cooperative resi
dences have taken steps — such as
scheduling informational meet
ings in various dorms around
campus this week — to increase
student awareness about co-op
life.
Many co-op residents believe
communal living has definite ad
vantages over dorm life, from a
closer-knit community to a signif
icantly lower board bill, and they
want to get this message across.
"Co-ops would be good for a lot
of people who don't like dorms —
they just aren't aware of it," said
junior Carl Goldschmidt, house
manager at the Enchanted Broc
coli Forest and Co-op Outreach
Motivator.
Students living in co-ops do
their own cooking and cleaning,
distributing chores among house
members and non-resident eating
associates.
Pushed by Residential Educa
tion Assoc. Director Diana Con
klin, the co-ops been have work
ing together on this project for the
past few months and have pro
duced a 10-page guide for the
spring housing lottery, containing
information on each house and a
chart summarizing how they com
pare.
Co-op members hope that the
information will dispel many of
the negative rumors about the
houses and show people what co
op life is really like, Goldschmidt
said. The outreach program is espe
cially geared toward freshmen, who
may not be well-acquainted with
the residences.
Over the last few years, declin
ing student interest in co-ops has
been reflected in Draw numbers.
For example, men with Draw
numbers as poor as 4,561 and
women with Draw numbers of
3,224 (without priority) were
placed in EBF last year, and a
number of students were assigned
there who did not request the
house, according to Bill Georges,
director of the Stanford Housing
Center.
This is a decline from 1990,
however, when EBF was in higher
demand.
But Georges added that the co
ops do not all fare as badly. Last
year, Chi Theta Chi had numbers of
1,695 for men and 2,540 for women
(with priority) — higher than many
non-co-op university residences.
However, these numbers have still

declined since 1990, when Theta
Chi went at 1,536 for men and 507
for women (with priority).
"The Row was less popular over
all last year because of the opening
of new residences like Lantana,
Castano and Kimball. The Row
houses are not as new or as nice,"
Georges said.
This trend may change, Georges
added, because the housing center
plans to remodel two to four Row
houses each year for the next sev
eral years. But Res Ed wants to see
an increase in student interest
sooner than that.
Georges thinks the outreach will
help co-ops reach their goal. "We've
gone through cycles of this — when
the co-ops do outreach, it spurs a
lot of interest. In the years when
they don't, interest falls, especially
among freshmen," he said.
Even though the co-ops usually
fill to capacity, Goldschmidt
believes it is important that stu
dents move into the house because
they want to, not just because they
are assigned there.
"In order to build a tighter com
munity you need people who want
to be there," Goldschmidt said.
