## Calls for acceptance and equal rights Gay march draws 300,000 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Throngs of
gay men and women spilled across the
Washington Mall yesterday demanding
acceptance and equal rights from a society
that often scorns their community. "A sim
ple matter of justice" was their rallying cry.
In brilliant, summery sunshine, they
came by the hundreds of thousands to tell
America who they are and what they want:
everyday citizens seeking an end to legal
discrimination that threatens their jobs,
privacy and peace of mind.
"We are the new American refugees,
coming home from exile," Torie Osborn,
executive director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, exhorted the mellow,
enthusiastic crowd.
"We won't compromise our freedom.
We won't negotiate our freedom away so
those who have freedom can be more com
fortable," said David Mixner, a Los Ange
les business consultant and fundraiser
who has advised President Clinton on gay
issues.

The U.S. Park Police estimated the
crowd at 300,000. But march organizers
said the event drew 1.1 million, a turnout
that would rival the great civil rights and
anti-war protests of the past quarter-cen
tury.
Some same-sex couples held hands or
hugged in an atmosphere they described as
more comfortable and supportive than
what they encountered in their daily lives.
"You can walk around holding hands
and being completely natural with each
other without fear," said Chris Triebert,
41, a graphic designer from Brattleboro, Vt.
Clinton, who invited gay leaders to a
White House meeting earlier this month,
lent support from a distance. In a speech in
Boston to newspaper editors, he said he had
paid a political price for trying to end the
ban on gays and lesbians in the military.
In a message to marchers, he declared,
"I stand with you in the struggle for equal
ity for all Americans, including gay men
and lesbians."
