# Yeltsin wins vote of confidence
## Referendum says people support economic reforms 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris
Yeltsin won a vote of confidence in a key
referendum yesterday but fell short of
his aim to force new parliamentary elec
tions, according to exit polls and partial
official results.
Yeltsin sought the referendum to
overcome the Communist-era Congress
of People's Deputies, which has tried to
thwart his reforms and curb his powers.
Although the results were mixed, his
hand was likely to be strengthened.
One exit poll showed 63.8 percent of
voters had confidence in Yeltsin and a
surprising 56 percent supporting his
market reforms, despite the hardships
they have caused.
Yeltsin adviser Gennady Burbulis
hailed.the vote as a victory, saying "Rus
sian voters took it upon themselves to
decide the protracted power struggle of
the top power structures."
He said on state-owned television that
the president will use the results to push
for early elections and a new constitution
to replace the Congress with a two

chamber, U.S.-style legislature.
The vote, however, did not provide an
uncontestable legal basis for early elec
tions and a new constitution that Yeltsin
hinted he would press for if given a man
date to call for the new parliamentary
elections.
While polls showed strong voter sup
port for new elections, it did not tally up
to a majority of the electorate, as
required. Voter turnout of 65 percent
was heavier than forecast, but too low to
give Yeltsin the majority he needed.
Lawmakers were certain to challenge
the meaning of the outcome during a
meeting of the smaller, standing
Supreme Soviet legislature set for today.
Both sides alleged that election laws
were broken.
Across 11 time zones, from snowy
Kamchatka to the balmy Black Sea, mil
lions of Russians voted by dropping a
paper ballot into a simple wooden box.
Election officials in many districts
reported voters returning early from
their country dachas to cast ballots.

In the final days before the balloting,
Yeltsin imitated a Western-style cam
paign, shaking hands and kissing a baby.
He also relied heavily on the two state
owned television channels.
The 62-year-old leader also made a raft
of promises to special interest groups,
raising pensions for the elderly, increas
ing stipends for students, promising land
to army officers and reversing a decision
to raise the price of gasoline.
The referendum asked voters
whether they:
• had confidence in Yeltsin, who was
elected to a five-year term in 1991 as
Russia's first popularly chosen presi
dent;
• approved of his economic reforms
launched in 1992;
• favored early presidential elections;
and
• favored the new parliamentary elec
tions.
Unlike the questions on early elections,
the questions on Yeltsin and his reforms
required only a majority of those voting.
