WATER, WATER every
where, but not a drop to
drink.
While the ASSU Publications
Board has accumulated a $35,000
reserve, most of Stanford's ASSU
funded publications have shriveled
to shadows of their former selves.
Plagued by antiquated, broken
equipment and unfairly distribut
ed office space, mainstay periodi
cals such as Release, The Review
and Dialtone have been faced with
astronomical costs which have
driven them into obscurity.
Better late than never, a bill has
been introduced to the Senate that
would allocate $14,880 of Publica
tions Board reserves to purchase
new equipment. But instead of
quickly seizing upon this issue in
order to salvage what has other
wise been a lackluster and frus
trating publishing year, the ASSU
has been operating as slow as
molasses, delaying consideration
for weeks.

The ASSU must realize failure
to take immediate action may spell
the final nail in many of these pub
lications' coffins. And the intellec
tual and creative loss to the cam
pus is incomparable to the petty
$14,880 the bill would allocate.
With this year's absence of a
Council of Presidents, students
have had little communication
with the administration. As a
plethora of publications go down
the tubes, students' voices will be
even more stifled in years to come.
Diversity of opinion will be rele
gated to lunch-time conversation,
far removed from any forum
where suggestions, demands or
problems can be aired and
resolved.
A vibrant student press and
communication of student con
cerns are hallmarks of a great uni
versity. Without expedient assis
tance this week by the ASSU, stu
dents and their concerns will be
left high and dry.
