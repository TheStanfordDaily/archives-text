SIX MONTHS LATE and at a
price tag of $15,000. Nothing
like efficiency in government,
right?
Finally, the ASSU has "done
something" about the summer
storage crisis. Unfortunately, the
plan reeks of last-minute planning
and a poor understanding of stu
dent needs.
The ASSU is planning to pur
chase eight tin bins, each with a
capacity of 320 square feet. Stu
dents seeking storage will be
accommodated on a first-come,
first-serve basis.
The ASSU plans to place these
bins on unused University land
near the stadium, under the hot
summer sun.
How many students are going to
be enthusiastic about cooking their
bulky, yet valuable belongings —
mountain bikes, stereos, comput
ers, televisions, VCRs etc. — in

steel sheds located on a remote
area of campus?
Beyond the question of heat
damage, security will be of great
concern. Since the sheds will be
above ground and unattended, the
possibility for foul play seems
great. Students may even be
required to sign a disclaimer before
leaving their items in the bins.
According to local storage propri
etors, students could rent about 400
square feet of summer storage space
— more than adequate for three or
more people — for about $150.
Instead of buying a paltry
amount of storage at the rate of $6
per foot, the ASSU should investi
gate the possibility of negotiating a
cut-rate deal with local storage
retailers (including transporta
tion), or spend the $15,000 needed
to pay University employees to
tend to traditional on-campus stor
age spaces.
