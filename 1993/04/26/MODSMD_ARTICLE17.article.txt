AASA explains its special fee request and budget reserve

Apparently, after the Special
Fee Recommendation interviews,
there was still confusion at The
Daily about AASA's proposed 1993-94
budget. I hope the following will clarify the
issues brought up in the April 21 editorial.
To l>egin, AASA works in three
accounts, and each of these accounts must
be included in the special fee request. The
first is the funded account into which the
ASSU places our funds at the beginning
of each quarter with the autumn-quarter
installment being the largest. This is iron
ic, because most of AASA's major events
occur later in spring quarter, accounting
for the $8,000 surplus existing at the end
of Dec. 1992. However, this $8,000 sur
plus gets carried over to the next quarters
and is eventually used up by the end of
the school year.
The second is the non-funded account
which includes money not from the ASSU
special fee, but money from outside
resources (e.g. fund raisers). If all of the
money here is not used during the school
year, the leftover is carried over into the
next year. The carryover from last year
was less than $100 and is predicted to be
even less for the end of this year. These

two accounts are readily accessible upon
the presentation of receipts as evidence of
use of funds.
The third account is the budget
reserve, which is what seems to be the
most troublesome to the editorial staff. At
the end of the school year, whatever is left
in the funded account is transferred to the
budget reserve, instead of being carried
over like money in the non-funded
account. Usually, leftover funds are the
result of cancelled programs. As is appar
ent in the submitted request, line items
were deducted when found to be in excess
of what was needed for this year. In the
case of cancelled programs, AASA alterna
tively tries to disperse the money before
the end of the school year by agreeing to
co-sponsor worthwhile programs with
other student organizations such as the
Asian Pacific Islander Law Students Asso
ciation and MEChA. However, because
these programs are unplanned, AASA
cannot predict exactly how much of the
surplus will be accounted for in that man
ner. It could be all or none or somewhere
in between.
Similarly, because of the unpre
dictability of expected revenue sources,

the true predicted surplus is less than the
$4,000 mentioned, and much less than
the $8000 calculated at the end of Dec.
1992. The $4000 includes expected
income and an essentially untouchable
budget reserve. For example, ticket sales
from the Lunar New Year celebration
were expected to bring in a revenue of
$500. In actuality, only a little over $200
worth of tickets were sold. As for money
in the budget reserve itself, AASA is able
to access it only by a two-thirds vote in
the ASSU Senate.
This budget reserve is essential, and an
example of use from this year would be the
coverage of the travel expenses of B.D.
Wong who spoke at the "Voices for
Change" program last spring. The goal of
requesting a certain amount for the special
fee is not to add to the budget reserve. It is
not as The Daily would believe, that AASA
wants to "hoard students' money" year
after year to purchase a luxury yacht or
vacation home or gold-plated toilet seat
covers for Old Union. It happens inciden
tally and not in terms of thousands of dol
lars per year. Additionally, the money from
the budget reserve is not calculated into
the final figure for the Special Fee Request.

Furthermore, AASA is unique in that
the ASSU funding, in part, goes to the
support and the co-sponsorship of pro
grams with the 40-plus smaller Asian
organizations on campus. This budget
was created according to which programs
are traditionally held and which programs
other groups have approached AASA
about for the following year. In addition,
this budget was created before the AASA
officer elections. In reality, we also depend
on the officer cores of those 40-plus orga
nizations to predict which events they
want co-sponsorship with. AASA is an
umbrella organization and cannot force
the other groups to hold events for which
they may have no time.
AASA tries very hard to use all of the
money wisely and purposefully, even if
planned events do not pan out. Unfortu
nately, the format of the budget leaves lit
tle room for explanation of little variables
such as the redirection of funds to unex
pected events that are of similar nature or
of a nature in keeping with the goals of
AASA.
