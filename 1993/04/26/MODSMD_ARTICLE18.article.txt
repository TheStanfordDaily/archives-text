# Grad students are not apathetic as stated in recent Daily editorial
## 
### 
We were offended and surprised at
The Daily's editorial, "A grad student
COP" which attacked the Graduate Stu
dent Association (GSA) and graduate
students in general. We feel that the edi
torial simply ignored the facts in describ
ing the GSA and presented a false image
of graduates students.
First, the editorial states that most of
the GSA budget is set aside for parties,
yet a full 45 percent of the budget is

devoted to sponsoring speakers at gradu
ate seminars, cultural events such as a
live music series at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center and the Lively Arts at
Stanford through a campus-wide spring
arts festival.
Second, the editorial unfairly labels
graduate students as "apathetic" and as
"complainers."
While graduates are, in general, less
involved in campus activities than
undergraduates, that does not mean
they are apathetic; it simply means
they lead a different lifestyle. Most
graduate students are occupied with
matters more important than the ASSU
elections. A large number of graduate
students are from foreign countries and

are here for a limited time, so they
must concentrate solely on their stud
ies. Many are married and are raising
children, which limits their time to
devote to outside activities. Still others
are involved in research which keeps
them away from campus much of the
time.
Through the GSA, many graduate stu
dents who had little contact with the
campus, due to other commitments, were
able to become involved in student activi
ties. It is not surprising that some of
these students, upon losing the opportu
nity to interact with other students,
would voice their unhappiness to their
student government representatives.
Instead of being met with a little bit of

intelligent understanding, these students
have been childishly and unfairly labeled
as "complainers" by the Daily editorial
ists.
While we are disappointed that the
GSA fund request was voted down for
the next academic year, we are still com
mitted, for the current year, to providing
the services for which the GSA was cre
ated — social and cultural activities for
graduate students.
