## Omens and superstitions 
### 
A HUGE OWL SCREECHED down
from the sky. Its white wings cut
the air with broad, powerful
strokes. I thought it must be an omen of
some kind, and I became transfixed as I
watched the creature disappear slowly
into the dark with each mysterious brush
of its wings. I was so enraptured that I
failed to notice the lamp post in front of
me, and smacked into it face-first.
I felt so foolish. Clearly, the owl had
been an omen, screeching out with signi
fication and trying to warn me, "Watch
out for the lamp-post!"
I vowed to pay more attention to
omens, and invest more faith in supersti
tions.
I remembered one of my favorite
superstitions — to rule out bad things
that might happen to me, simply by
imagining them. Since it is impossible to
predict the future, I reason, merely
thinking of something terrible guaran
tees that it will never occur. If I say to
myself, "Oh, I hope a boulder doesn't fall
on me," I automatically preclude the pos
sibility of that tragic fate. Granted, the
chances of a boulder falling on me are
slim, but imagine the chances of a boul
der falling on me right after I say, "Oh, I
hope a boulder doesn't fall on me." In
this way, I imagine away countless
bizarre accidents.
It would be absurdly coincidental if a
boulder were to fall on me right after I

imagined it. But if I say, out loud, to a
friend, "I hope a boulder doesn't fall on
me right now," and then laugh hysteri
cally at the absurdity of that notion right
as a 10-foot square rock crashes through
my roof and flattens me — that would be
terribly ironic. My friend would think,
"My God, what he said was an omen!"
and marvel at the irony of it all.
Imagining something is good insur
ance against it ever happening, but actu
ally saying it introduces the possibility of
irony, which I believe is a real, operative
force. It's a bad omen to make superla
tive statements, for example, because
there is always a chance that the force of
irony will mock you. I never boast how
well I did on an exam or how well a job
interview went, for fear of the opposite
coming true. If I exclaim, "This is going
to be the best year of my life!" and raise
my arms in the air as if to reach out to
the world and all its promise, and just
then a wildebeest crashes through the
door and tramples me, who's to say I
didn't have it coming, setting up a poten-'
tially ironic situation like that? This is
why people knock on wood — as a kind of
"irony insurance."
There are other things one can do to
make sure bad things don't happen.
Some people sacrifice goats, but nowa
days it's more common to carry around a
lucky rock or a two-dollar bill. In effect,
these charms do the same thing as my

practice of ruling out accidents by imag
ining them away, but they insure their
owners against bad fate in general. They
also imbue their holders with a kind of
positive aura that fends off ill fate. Thus,
it would also be ironic, if I were crushed
by a boulder, for my friends to later dis
cover that I had been wearing my lucky
rabbit's foot the whole time.
At this point, things may be a bit
unclear. With all these omens, coinci
dences, superstitions, ironies and dou
ble-reverse ironies floating around,
you might be wondering, "What can I
do to be safe?" Unfortunately, the
answer is "not much." Even if I had a
great way for you to insure yourself
against absurd misfortune, if I told
you my secret, I would just be taunt
ing the forces of irony to come and
prove me wrong. Probably, even before
I got the words, "Here's how to be sure
bad luck will never visit you" out of
my mouth, a big bag of roast beef
would fall from the sky and strike me
on the shoulder. I don't mean to be
superstitious, but that would be a bad
omen.
