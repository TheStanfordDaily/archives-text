## Draft day: Gordon, Milburn, Lynch picked by pros 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Stanford football team contin
ued its tradition of sending top
prospects to the pros as cornerback Dar
rien Gordon, running back Glyn Mil

burn and safety John Lynch were select
ed in the first four rounds of the Nation
al Football League Draft yesterday in
New York.
Gordon, a second-team All-Pacific
-10 Conference player, was selected
with the 22nd pick of the first round

by the San Diego Chargers. He had
four interceptions and 17 deflections
for the 10-3 Cardinal in his senior
season last year.
Milburn, who virtually rewrote the
Stanford record books in his three
seasons in a Cardinal uniform, was
selected by the Denver Broncos in the
second round with the 43rd overall
pick. The hard-hitting Lynch was
picked by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in the third round with the 82nd
overall pick.
"It feels great," Gordon said. "I'm
happy to go to such a good team, too."
Despite being snubbed by all the
postseason collegiate all-star games,
Gordon impressed Chargers General
Manager Bobby Beathard with excel
lent workouts at various pre-draft
combines. Beathard, considered one
of the NFL's top talent scouts, liked
Gordon's ability to change directions
and accelerate.
"I think Gordon's stock probably
rose from midseason on," Beathard
said. "I don't think we went into the
season looking at Darrien Gordon as
one of the hot prospects. But the way
he played and the matchups he had
during the season with good
receivers, he did an excellent job."
Gordon has proven his defensive
coverage abilities against some of the
nation's top receivers. Arriving at
Stanford from Shawnee, Okla. as a
wide receiver, Gordon made the quick
transition to defense and gained
renown for his performances against
USC's Curtis Conway and California's
Sean Dawkins. He punctuated his
