## Draft day: Gordon, Milburn, Lynch picked by pros 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Stanford football team contin
ued its tradition of sending top
prospects to the pros as cornerback Dar
rien Gordon, running back Glyn Mil

burn and safety John Lynch were select
ed in the first four rounds of the Nation
al Football League Draft yesterday in
New York.
Gordon, a second-team All-Pacific
-10 Conference player, was selected
with the 22nd pick of the first round

by the San Diego Chargers. He had
four interceptions and 17 deflections
for the 10-3 Cardinal in his senior
season last year.
Milburn, who virtually rewrote the
Stanford record books in his three
seasons in a Cardinal uniform, was
selected by the Denver Broncos in the
second round with the 43rd overall
pick. The hard-hitting Lynch was
picked by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in the third round with the 82nd
overall pick.
"It feels great," Gordon said. "I'm
happy to go to such a good team, too."
Despite being snubbed by all the
postseason collegiate all-star games,
Gordon impressed Chargers General
Manager Bobby Beathard with excel
lent workouts at various pre-draft
combines. Beathard, considered one
of the NFL's top talent scouts, liked
Gordon's ability to change directions
and accelerate.
"I think Gordon's stock probably
rose from midseason on," Beathard
said. "I don't think we went into the
season looking at Darrien Gordon as
one of the hot prospects. But the way
he played and the matchups he had
during the season with good
receivers, he did an excellent job."
Gordon has proven his defensive
coverage abilities against some of the
nation's top receivers. Arriving at
Stanford from Shawnee, Okla. as a
wide receiver, Gordon made the quick
transition to defense and gained
renown for his performances against
USC's Curtis Conway and California's
Sean Dawkins. He punctuated his

picks in this year's draft.
Gordon, who started every
game for the Cardinal the last
two years, was the third defen
sive back picked in the draft.
Only Texas A&M's Patrick Bates,
considered one of the top athletes
available, and Notre Dame's Tom
Carter, the best coverage corner
back on the block, were picked
before Gordon.
Gordon even has a chance to
slip into the starting cornerback
slot next year for the Chargers,
due to the loss of last season's
starter, Tony Blaylock, to the
Chicago Bears via free agency.
Gordon's main competition will be
six-game starter Sean Vanhorse
and free-agent Brian Davis.
"Hopefully I see myself start
ing right away or as soon as pos
sible," Gordon said. "They have
good corners there already, so if
I can just come in and play some
nickel and learn the system, and
hopefully start challenging for
the job, that would be great."
"He's got that rare speed, so
if you can have a cornerback
that can run with any receiver, I
think that's an advantage,"
Beathard said. "It gives you a
little more flexibility."
Gordon made the biggest
impact at the draft combines
with his speed. Timed at 4.3 sec
onds in the 40-yard dash, he is
as fast or faster than many of
the NFL's top receivers.
In the realm of offense, Mil
burn became the second Stan
ford running back in as many

years to be drafted in the first
two rounds. Tommy Vardell was
drafted in the first round a year
ago by the Cleveland Browns
with the ninth overall pick.
Pro scouts had difficulty rating
Milburn, whose small size limits
his potential to play running back
in the NFL. Denver will probably
use his quickness and pass-catch
ing ability as a third-down receiver
and kick returner.
The Buccaneers will welcome
the addition of Lynch as they
hope to bolster a relatively young
defense with his bone-crushing
hits. Lynch, also a promising
pitcher in the Florida Marlins'
farm system, had his two-sport
future blurred considerably with
his selection by Tampa Bay. He
has yet to make a decision about
which sport he will pursue, but
most experts think he will turn
to baseball full-time.
Overall, the Pac-10 had an
excellent showing in the first
round of the draft. Washington
State's Drew Bledsoe, rated as
the top quarterback prospect,
was tabbed first by the New
England Patriots. Chicago
picked Conway with the seventh
selection, and Washington's
mammoth offensive tackle Lin
coln Kennedy was picked ninth
by the Atlanta Falcons. He joins
former Stanford lineman Bob
Whitfield, the eighth pick in last
year's draft, in Atlanta.
Dawkins was the 15th pick, fill
ing a major need at wide receiv
er for the Indianapolis Colts.
Other Pac-10 picks in the first
four rounds were: UCLA's Carl
ton Gray, db, Seattle, 28th over
all; Washington's Billy Joe
Hobert, qb, Los Angeles Raiders,
58; Arizona's Ty Parten, dl,
Cincinnati, 63; Cal's Russell
White, rb, Los Angeles Rams, 73;
Washington State's Lewis Bush,
lb, San Diego, 99; USC's Travis
Hannah, wr, Houston, 102; and
Washington's Jaime Fields, lb,
Kansas City, 103.
The NFL Draft will hold the
final four rounds of selection
Monday. Stanford linebackers
Ron George and Dave Garnett
and offensive lineman Chris
Dalman have strong chances to
be picked sometime during
today's draft action.
