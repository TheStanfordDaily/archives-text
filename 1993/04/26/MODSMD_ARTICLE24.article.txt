# Netters can't match past Pac-10 feats

Although the fifth-ranked Cardinal did not
sweep this weekend's Pacific 10 Individual
Men's Tennis Championships in Ojai, Calif, as
it has in past years, coach Dick Gould man
aged to keep an optimistic perspective.
The team remained healthy and the players
showed continuing improvement, according to
Gould. "I saw some really positive things," he
said, noting improved strokes and court strategy.
The most successful Cardinal netter was
junior Robert Devens, who won three matches
before falling in the semifinals. Devens, whose
matches usually outlast those of all his team
mates, simply ran out of energy.
"After three tough matches on Thursday,
he just hit the wall (on Friday)," Gould said.
"He had a few chances to win it, but he just
couldn't pull it out."
Before the 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 loss to UCLA's
Fritz Bissell, Devens had a big quarterfinal
win over UCLA's Sebastian Leßlanc, 6-4, 6-4,
and two early round wins over Cal's David
Smith (6-4, 6-4) and Randy Baldimore of Ari
zona (6-2, 6-3).
Junior Vimal Patel was the only other Stan
ford player to reach the quarterfinals. On Thurs
day, he breezed by Arizona's Brendan Hearn 6-
2,6-2 and triumphed in a close battle with Wash
ington's top hitter, Chet Crile, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6.

On Friday, however, Patel lost to UCLA's
Robert Janecek 6-2, 6-2. "Vimal had two out
standing matches," Gould said. "But then he
just played into Janecek's hands — Janecek
did better at what he does best than Vimal did
at what Vimal does best. . . . Vimal did do a
good job of mixing his strokes and implement
ing the things we've been doing in practice."
Although Stanford's other three players in
the championship division lost on the first day
of competition, Gould was not ruffled. "Last
year we did better, but we had Alex (O'Brien)
to do it with," he said. "When you take him
out of the picture, this year's performance is
comparable with last year's."
Junior Michael Flanagan, who has played
at No. 1 for the Cardinal all year, suffered a
surprising loss in the first round to Cal's Steve
Lappin, 6-3, 6-3.
"He was a little flat," Gould said. "He
seemed tentative, but this is the first time in a
long time that he has played someone who
wasn't the team's top player."
Freshman Jeff Salzenstein also lost in the
first round. Leßlanc defeated Salzenstein 6-1,
7-5 before losing to Devens in the quarterfinals.
Junior Chris Cocotos pulled out a victory
over Cal's top hitter, Tommy Phanco, 6-1, 3-6,
6-3 before losing to UCLA's Davide San
guinetti 6-4, 6-1.
"That was one of the better matches I have
seen Chris play all year," Gould said, referring

to the first-round win.
For all of its troubles in singles play, how
ever, the Cardinal found the going to be even
rougher in doubles action. Devens and Patel
cruised to an easy first-round win before
falling in the second, while the other two Car
dinal tandems lost in the opening round.
A 6-2, 6-1 rout of the Huskies' Manuel
Marti and Robbie Wendell set up Patel and
Devens for a grueling three-set contest with
UCLA's Janecek and Leßlanc. Again, the Bru
ins pulled out this contest 6-7, 7-5, 6-1.
Cocotos and Flanagan lost a close three-set
ter to USC's Adam Petersen and Lukas Hovor
ka 6-7, 6-4, 7-6. Salzenstein and partner Jim
Thomas played well, but were overwhelmed by
one of the best collegiate pairs in the country,
USC's Brian MacPhie and Jon Leach, 6-2, 6-3.
"Jim and Jeff were doing stuff I haven't
seen them do all year," Gould said. "They had
a great match."
In the invitational bracket, the Cardinal
fared a bit better. Thomas won three matches
before falling in the semifinals to UCLA's
Matt Quinlan 6-1, 6-7, 6-3.
Junior Billy Wright notched a pair of wins
before losing to yet another Bruin, Darin
Pleasant, in the quarterfinals. Freshman
Ricky Becker lost in the round of 16.
In doubles, Wright and Becker made it to the
semifinals before falling to a pair of Bruins,
Heath Montgomery and Graham Gillis, 7-5,6-4.
