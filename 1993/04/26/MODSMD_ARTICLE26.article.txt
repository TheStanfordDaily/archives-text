# Wildcats take two of three, push Cardinal to postseason brink
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
With four weeks remaining in
the 1993 regular season, the fat
lady is warming up her voice for
the Cardinal baseball team.
Stanford (21-20 overall, 7-14
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division), fighting for its NCAA
playoff life, lost two of three cru
cial games to No. 11 Arizona
(28-20, 14-11) at Sunken Dia
mond this weekend.
After opening the series with
a 9-6 win on Friday, the Cardi

nal dropped the final two con
tests, 4-3 and 16-8 on Saturday
and Sunday.
Stanford, which needs to fin
ish with a .500 conference
record to merit serious postsea
son recognition, must win eight
of its final nine Six-Pac games to
achieve that mark.
"Realistically, we haven't got
much of a chance to make the
playoffs," said Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess. "If I tell the
team any different, then I'm
lying."
The Wildcats, who virtually

assured themselves of a postsea
son berth, won in the same man
ner they have been winning
games all season — with the bat.
Arizona cranked out five home
runs and 43 hits against a Cardi
nal staff that led the Six-Pac
with a 4.67 earned-run average
going into the weekend.
"They do a good job with
their offense," Marquess said.
"They obviously swing the bat
well."
The 'Cats wasted no time in
demonstrating their offensive
prowess, touching Stanford ace

Willie Adams for three runs in
the first two innings of Friday's
game.
Adams, who had perhaps his
worst outing of the season
against Arizona two months ago
in Tucson, settled down after
the second, retiring the side in
order in the fourth and fifth
innings.
In the seventh, the Cardinal's
sleepy bats awoke in a hurry.
With Stanford down 5-3, desig
nated hitter Nate Olmstead sin
gled to left to lead off the inning.
Olmstead, who came into the
weekend batting only .190, col
lected six hits in the series.
With one out and runners on
second and third, Brodie Van
Wagenen stepped up to the
plate. Van Wagenen, who Mar
quess moved from the No. 6 to
the No. 9 position in the lineup,
doubled to the gap in left-center
field, tying the score at five.
After Brian Dallimore singled
Van Wagenen to third, Wildcat
reliever Zack Pringle replaced
starter Ryan Frace. Pringle
walked Jed Hansen to load the
bases for Dusty Allen. Allen,
who leads the Cardinal in runs
batted-in with 39, padded that
total by driving a three-run
triple to the wall in right field.
Steve Carver capped the inning
by driving Allen home on a sac
rifice fly.
With the four-run cushion,
Adams cruised to his team-lead
ing eighth victory and seventh
complete game, striking out a
career-high 11 on the afternoon.
Saturday's contest looked to
be a repeat of Friday's game.
Once again, the Wildcats
stormed to an early lead. Arizona
centerfielder John Tejcek home
red off Stanford lefty Andrew
Lorraine to open the game.

Once again, the Cardinal
came from behind to take the
lead. Stanford tied it in the sec
ond on an Olmstead double and
a Van Wagenen single. In the
third, Hansen made the score 2-
1 Cardinal, drilling a 1-2 Todd
Singelyn offering over the left
field fence for his sixth home
run of the season.
But Lorraine began to run
out of gas in the seventh. Short
stop James Motte led off the
inning with a home run which
cut the Stanford lead to 3-2.
Two batters later, the Wildcats
had runners on first and second
with no outs and Robby Moen at
the plate.
Moen, second in the Six-Pac
with a .410 average, ripped a line
drive down the third base line.
Dallimore snagged the shot,
reeled and threw to first to com
plete an amazing double play.
"You love to see things like
that happen behind you," Lor
raine said. "They're unpre
dictable."
Lorraine left the game in the
eighth with George Arias on sec
ond and Willie Morales at bat.
"Sometimes you wonder after
you leave a game whether you
could have gotten the job done,"
Lorraine said. "But this time, I
didn't have much left."
Marquess gave the ball to
Olmstead, Stanford's starting
designated hitter. In his first
three appearances, Olmstead
had allowed only one hit in 6.2
innings of work, striking out 12.
But Olmstead, who raised his
batting average from .190 to
.259 in the series, did not experi
ence similar successes on the
mound. He picked up his first
loss of the season after giving up
a double to Morales and an RBI
single to Chris Gump.

Down 4-3, the Cardinal would
not score again, stranding a pair
of runners in the eighth and
going down in order in the
ninth.
While Arizona jumped to
early leads in the first two
games, it was Stanford who got
on the scoreboard first in yester
day's rubber match.
Wildcat starter Rob Ippolito
lasted for exactly two batters.
Coach Jerry Kindall, wary of
Ippolito's recent ineffective per
formance, gave him the hook
after only seven pitches. Reliev
er Steve Arffa was no more
effective, however, as the Cardi
nal batted around in the first to
take a 4-0 lead.
But even a 4-0 lead is tenuous
against Arizona, which scores an
average of almost 10 runs a
game. By the fourth, the score
stood at 9-6 'Cats, and every Ari
zona starter had picked up a hit.
The Wildcats absolutely clob
bered Cardinal pitching yester
day, pounding out 20 hits, nine
for extra bases. Arizona desig
nated hitter Jason Thompson
went 5-for-6, improving to 16-
for-29 in six games against Stan
ford this season.
"I can't explain it. It's mental.
Hitting's all mental, in my opin
ion," Thompson said. "They have
good pitching, two of the best
guys in the league in Adams and
Lorraine, but you get on a roll and
you expect things to happen."
Things certainly haven't been
happening for the Cardinal,
which has lost six of its last
seven conference games.
"We're trying to win games
and play well," Marquess said.
"And we'll keep trying to do that
until the end of the season."


Al Green — Daily
Dusty Allen contributed three runs and six RBI to the Cardinal cause over the weekend, but Stanford finds
itself on the verge of losing all College World Series aspirations after dropping two of three to Arizona.
