# Spiking seniors depart with sweep
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
In sweeping the visiting UC-
San Diego Tritons 15-3, 15-9,
15-4 Saturday night, the second
ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team (18-4, 16-3 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) creat
ed two separate stories.
One was the story of six
seniors who have been invalu
able to the Cardinal volleyball

program uniting for one last
match on the parquet of Burn
ham Pavilion. The other was
the story of freshman Mike
Lambert shedding some light on
the future of Stanford men's
volleyball.
The match began with a
recognition of the achievements
of each of the six seniors on the
Cardinal squad — John Bezmali
novic, Bob Hillman, Ryan Moos,
David Goss, John Hribar and

Tm really proud of
that group of seniors
... I'm very proud of
all the success they
have brought to this
program.'
— Ruben Nieves

Jimmy Blackman.
These six combined to hit an
impressive .633 in a game-one
rout, while holding UCSD (2-
25, 1-18) to a miserable .097.
The Tritons were clearly over
matched from the get-go, as two
hitting errors led to a 2-0 Cardi
nal advantage.
Goss then took over, raking
up four of his game-high nine
kills on the next few series as
Stanford grabbed a 6-1 lead.
Goss, who sat out the final two
games, hit .818 with zero
errors.
As Goss' spiking cooled
down, Hillman's serving heated
up. On a recently-sprained
ankle, Hillman tallied three
straight points on his biting
jump serve. Also contributing
with his spiking, Hillman had
four kills on five attempts to hit
.600.
The first game was then put
away 15-3 on a Moos ace. Swing
hitter Moos, who also sat out
games two and three, had three
kills in three attempts for a per
fect 1.000 hitting percentage.
"I'm really proud of that
group of seniors," said Stanford
coach Ruben Nieves. "Individu
ally, they've become tremen
dous volleyball players. And
I'm very proud of all the suc
cess they have brought to this
program."
The final two games show
cased the talents of Lambert,
who replaced Goss at opposite
hitter. In game two, Lambert
recorded 13 kills, more than any
other player tallied on the entire
match. He added six more in the
third and final game to hit .615
on the night.

"I thought there was one
part of the match that was very
competitive," Nieves said. "I
thought the best player during
that stretch of the match was
Mike Lambert. He was the guy
that we were going to, and he's
what made the difference there.
"Mike's a player. He does a
lot of things well. The only rea
son he has not played more this
year is that he's playing behind
some fifth-year seniors."
In addition to his hitting,
Lambert had two aces to tie for
the match-high with Bezmali
novic.
This year, Lambert has seen
most of his playing time at
swing hitter. But he feels more
comfortable at opposite hitter, a
position which becomes wide
open when Goss graduates in
June.
"I feel much more at home
and at ease at opposite," Lam
bert said. "All you do is hit the
ball as hard as you can and
block every ball you get your
hands on. Swing hitter is a dif
ferent attitude. . . . It's a lot
harder."
Other lesser-known Cardinal
players also played significant
roles in games two and three.
Sophomore Eric Wells, usually
used in defensive substitution
situations late in games, raked
up significant playing time, pro
ducing six kills, one block and a
match-high six digs.
While playing in only his
fourth match of the season,
sophomore swing hitter David
Fischer enjoyed a career-high
six kills to go along with one dig
and one block.
Stanford can now turn its
full attention to this Wednes
day's MPSF championship
match against UCLA in Irvine,
Calif., a contest with a guaran
teed NCAA Final Four bid at
stake.
"I think ever since we beat
Long Beach State we couldn't
wait for [this] Monday to
come," Nieves said. "We worked
real hard to get us into the posi
tion we are in now, and we've
just been chomping at the bit to
take it from here. Let's get on
with the playoffs."
