# Chiminello electrifies Pac-10s
## 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
OJAI, Calif. — They say that on a
given day, any tennis player can
beat any other tennis player. This
was her day.
Sophomore Amy Chiminello was
the Cinderella story at the 94th
Annual Ojai Valley Pacific 10
Championships this weekend,
pulling off back-to-back-to-back
upsets of higher-ranked players,
before finally falling in the semifi
nals to defending Pac-10 champion
Alix Creek of Arizona, 6-0, 6-4.
"Amy played the best tennis I've
ever seen her play," said coach
Frank Brennan. "Her match
against [Keril Phebus was one of
the best collegiate matches I've seen
in 14 years at Stanford."
Chiminello returned to dual
match play just last weekend after
recovering from the flu, and she left
no question that she was back in
prime form. Chiminello kicked off
the 32-player singles tournament
with a convincing 6-4,6-1 upset vic
tory over Keirsten Alley of Califor
nia in a match that Brennan said
"set the tone for the rest of the tour
nament."
In her second-round match,
Chiminello came up with upset No.
2, dumping USC's Suzanne Italiano
with authority, 6-3, 6-0. Italiano is
ranked No. 28 in the country and is
the top singles player for the No. 5
Trojans.
Chiminello's third and biggest
upset win, however, came against
Keri Phebus of UCLA, 6-4, 6-1, in
the quarterfinals Friday. Phebus is
the Bruins' No. 1 singles player and
is ranked No. 6 nationally.

"Everything you ever want to
see as a coach she did in that
match," Brennan said. "She knew
what to do and when to do it at all
times — strategically and tactically,
she played the perfect match."
The clock struck midnight for
Chiminello in the semis, however,
as Creek, ranked fifth in the nation,
overpowered her with quick
groundstrokes and precision ball
placement.
"She's a shotmaker — she just
never missed a shot, so I felt like I
was never getting a chance,"
Chiminello said. "But I never gave
up against her — I never counted
myself out."
"Alix is a great frontrunner,"
Brennan said. "She's very intense
and a quick starter — she can be
very tough."
Senior team captain Heather
Willens had hoped her last trip to
Ojai would produce a champi
onship, but unfortunately for Stan
ford's No. 2 singles player, it was
not to be. Willens, ranked No. 4 in
the country, scored early round
wins over Washington State's
Katherine Cos tain, 6-1, 6-1, and
Arizona State's Page Bartelt, 6-2,6-
2, but fell victim to an upset herself,
losing in the quarterfinals to
UCLA's Jane Chi, 6-1,1-6, 7-5. Chi
is ranked 93rd nationally.
"Heather's been playing sick this
weekend," said assistant coach Lele
Forood. "She was playing a lot
worse than usual, and Jane was
having a great match."
Cardinal freshman phenom
Beth Berris disposed of Washing
ton's Kim Frost in the first round of
the singles competition, 6-2, 6-2,
but fell in the second round to Phe-

bus by a 7-5, 6-3 score. Junior Kris
tine Kurth also advanced past the
first round with a convincing 6-3, 6-
1 win over UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk,
but couldn't hold off Creek, as the
defending Ojai champion won 6-3,
6-1. Junior Emma Woodhouse lost
in the first round, 6-2, 6-1, to Miko
Hemsi of Arizona.
In doubles, Rerris and Kurth
rebounded from a slow start to
defeat Arizona's Angela Bernal and
Allison Grace in three sets, 4-6, 6-1,
6-2. Stanford's No. 2 duo, however,
could not hold a 5-4 second-set lead
and succumbed to a late rally by
USC's Italiano and Ayisha ZaLnan
in the second round, falling to the
Trojans 6-4, 7-5. Chiminello and
freshman Wendy Sacks, the Cardi
nal's other doubles entry, dropped a
6-1, 6-2 decision to California's
Alley and Pam Nelson in the first
round of play.
In the invitational bracket, Sacks
drew a first-round bye and scored a
6-0, 6-0 win over Amy Marks in the
second round, but lost to Sarah
Maynard in the third, 6-3, 7-6.
While several Cardinal players
benefited from this valuable tune
up for the NCAA Tournament in
Gainesville, Fla. from May 12
through 20, Chiminello's best per
formance of the year might get even
sweeter yet, since this weekend's
results could result in her first-ever
NCAA Singles Championship
berth.
"Wow, I didn't even think of
that," Chiminello said. "Obviously,
I'm excited playing for the team
championship since that's been our
goal all year, but being in singles is a
nice thought. It would definitely top
off my year."
