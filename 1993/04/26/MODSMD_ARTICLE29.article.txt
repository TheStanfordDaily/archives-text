# Crews use 'capital' punishment

Benefitting from a change in weather, the Stan
ford women's crew team proved that it belongs in
the upper echelon of the nation's rowing powers,
winning two out of three races at the California
State Championships in Sacramento on Saturday.
The Cal State Championships, the major race
for California's small state schools, proved to be
exactly what Stanford needed to get back to its
winning ways.
"We needed to go beat up on some people this
weekend, and we did," coach Wendy Davis said.
"This race helped us get our confidence back."
The women's varsity four completed Davis'
task of beating up on the smaller boats, winning
with a time of 7 minutes, 58 seconds. San Diego
State came in second in 8:07, and Long Beach
State finished third in 8:11.
According to Davis, the varsity boat of Kate
Steger, Chuen-Yen Lau, Larissa Cochron, Sarah
Morse and coxswain Justine Matera finally found
a rhythm to their stroke that the coach had been
looking for all year. Matera, the varsity coxswain
since January, showed a wily determination long
beyond her limited experience.
"Justine has done a great job keeping this boat
together," Davis said. "She's comfortable making
the right calls and now has a lot of experience on
this Sacramento course, which will come in handy
for [Pacific Coast] Championships, because
they're at Sacramento."
The junior-varsity eight also finished first with
a time of 7:35, defeating UC-Santa Barbara by five
seconds, UC-Davis by six seconds and UC-San
Diego by 35 seconds.
"I was never really concerned in either the var

sity or junior-varsity races, and that's the way I
like it," Davis said.
Unfortunately, the novice boat did not have the
same success as the varsity or junior varsity. Fac
ing many of the crews which beat them at the San
Diego Crew Classic, the Cardinal rowers were
unable to make up any time as they placed fourth,
18 seconds off the pace.
UC-Santa Barbara won the novice race with a
time of 7:19. UC-Davis came in second with a time
of 7:30.3, narrowly beating UC-Irvine by one
tenth of a second.
"We were further back against these crews
than at San Diego," Davis said. "The novices were
missing their second-best rower, and that really
affected them."
The women's crew appears to be getting over
the injuries which have plagued it all season. This
weekend showcased the return of Steger and
Cochron, and Davis expects varsity rower Kristin
Hubbard to be ready to practice on Monday. Davis
also wants to see if Cara Larson can start getting
back into shape this week.
The men's crew got a peek into the future with
heavy participation from the novice boats. Stan
ford's top freshman boat competed in the junior
varsity category, finishing third with a time of
6:30.4. UCSB crossed the finish line at 6:26.2,
while Santa Clara finished second in 6:30.31.
The top freshman boat, also competing in the
men's novice eight division, finished fifth with a
time of 6:22.9, eight seconds off UC-Davis' winning
time of 6:14.8. UCSD finished second at 6:18.7 and
Sacramento State finished third with a time of
6:19.7. The University of San Diego narrowly edged
the Cardinal for fourth with a time of 6:21.7.
Neither the second freshman eight nor the Car
dinal's four qualified for the finals.
