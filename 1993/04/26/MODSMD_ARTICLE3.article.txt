# Cabinet may revamp UCMI review process
## Internal evaluations, 'transculturalism' proposed; 'self-segregation' questioned 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
A proposal that would overhaul the way
the University evaluates multicultural
progress will be presented before the Uni
versity Cabinet on Thursday.
In addition to making general remarks
on the issues raised by the 1991 panel re
port of the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, the proposal recommends
that "internal review panels" replace the
existing UCMI review panel process, and
attempts to establish "transculturalism" as
a preferred term to "multiculturalism."
The draft, obtained by The Daily, was
written by Law School Dean Paul Brest,
who said he could not comment on the pro
posal until it is discussed by the full cabinet
later this week. If approved, the proposal
will become the official University Cabinet
Response to the 1991 review panel report of

the UCMI.
The UCMI was established in 1987 by
then-University President Donald
Kennedy and then-Provost James Rosse in
response to student demands for a formal
evaluation and definition of the Universi
ty's multicultural goals.
The original committee — composed of
faculty, staff and students, as well as out
side experts — published its final report in
1989, with findings and recommendations
in several areas, including the curriculum,
student life, and faculty, staff and student
diversity.
As outlined in the final report, review
panels — also comprised of faculty, staff,
students and experts from other schools —
were formed in 1990 and 1991 to publish
periodic reports on the University's
progress toward fulfilling these recommen-
dations.
As part of the recommenda
tions, the Office of Multicultural
Development was established in
1990 — primarily to oversee the
implementation and review of the
UCMI's goals.
Internal review panels
According to the cabinet's
response draft, an internal
review panel is preferable to the
current arrangement, because
"although the Office of Multicul
tural Development plays an
important function in gathering
and disseminating information, a
substantive assessment of
progress can only be undertaken
by the Provost, relying on appro
priately constituted committees."
Such internal review commit
tees would be "more credible and
persuasive" because "they repre
sent a diversity of viewpoints,"
and would be "more effective
than review by an entity com
posed in part of people from out
side the University," the draft
states.

However,
Sharon Parker,
the director of
the Office of
Multicultural
Development,
said the UCMI
review process
should not be
thought of as
either internal
or external.

"The existing process has
always been both (internal and
external) to make sure that voic
es are heard," Parker said,
adding that she is concerned that
the cabinet's "discussion may be
taking place in a vacuum of infor
mation" about UCMI.
Parker said she hopes to shed
light on any misconceptions in a
presentation she is slated to give
to the cabinet at its Thursday
meeting about the current
progress of UCMI and the Office
of Multicultural Development.
However, A 1 Camarillo, chair
of the original UCMI, said the
cabinet's proposed review process
meshes well with the committee's
"recommendation for an annual
internal review of some sort via a
standing committee to be decided

by the president or provost."
The original committee "never
came up with the visiting com
mittee idea," said Camarillo, an
associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences. "To my understanding,
the proposed process doesn't pre
clude outside people being on the
review panel."
But Black Student Union
member Allyson Dixon said she
feels an internal review process
would cheat the University of a
"refreshing, broad perspective
that is not already submerged in
what they're trying to evaluate."
Dixon, a senior, said she feels a
review panel should be "different
from the status quo" and that an
internal panel would leave too
great a risk for "politics to come
into play."
Lack of student voice
Dixon and junior Eva Silva,
coordinator of El Centro Chi
cano, expressed concern about
the lack of student voice in for
mulating the draft, questioning
the administration and cabinet's
commitment to multiculturalism
as it applied to students.
Since the whole debate regard
ing UCMI originated with stu
dents, Dixon said she was sur
prised that so little student input
was solicited in the drafting of
the cabinet response.
Although the draft was not
officially "confidential," it was
not intentionally distributed to
the public. Students became
aware of it when it was anony
mously photocopied and dis
tributed to the ethnic community
centers.
The cabinet's "shying away
from publicity" regarding the
draft disturbed Dixon because "it
seems as if the administration did
it on purpose" to avoid objec
tions.
"It's such a change from the
status quo, and the students and
faculty ultimately have to deal
with it," Dixon said. "An explana
tion was necessary. Yet if it
weren't for some concerned peo
ple, we wouldn't have known
about it at all."
Silva said University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper mentioned
the formulation of the cabinet
response draft to MEChA mem
bers earlier in the year, and she
was concerned at the time that he
didn't say anything about stu
dent input.
"He said he would keep us

posted, but there was really no
notification or public distribution
when the draft came out," Silva
said.
"Students want to be heard
and it seems that (the adminis
tration and cabinet) are not lis
tening," she said.
Self-segregation?
The draft also responds to the
UCMI review panel's concerns
about budget cuts adversely
affecting student services —
namely the ethnic community
centers and theme houses — by
stating that the cabinet shares
the review

panel's concern,
but perceives
"that the stu
dent services
have not suf
fered dispropor
tionately due to
budget cuts."
Some stu
dents, however,
beg to differ. As

coordinator of El Centro Chi
cano, Silva said she has experi
enced first-hand the community
centers' lack of sufficient
resources.
"We have a lot of community
service and cultural events that
we can't put on because our bud
get is frozen and the community
is growing," Silva said.
The original UCMI report rec
ommended that community cen
ters receive three full-time staff
members each, as well as addi
tional funding to meet their
growing student demand.
Like most of the other ethnic
community centers, El Centro
only has two full-time staff mem
bers and has not received the
increased budget that the UCMI
report called for, Silva said.
Also, the cabinet states in the
draft that while they acknowl
edge the value of the University's
community centers and theme
houses, "the University should
be alert to their potential for self
segregation."
Silva said the draft's state
ment only serves to "perpetuate a
lot of myths that ethnic commu
nities are segregationist. People
don't see the need for the support
systems."
The statement "seems to be an
excuse not to fund the communi
ty centers and theme houses,"
she added.
Dixon said the community

centers do focus on issues that
surround those communities and
may be perceived as "clique-ish,"
but they make efforts to include
the entire Stanford community.
Parker said the statement is
unfair to students of color
because it assumes that students
of color who gather for common
interests are segregationist, but
white students who do so are not
presented that way.
"Trans-" vs. "multi-"cultural
The response draft also seeks
to clarify the premises and defini
tions of the UCMI review panel's
findings, establishing "transcul
turalism," rather than "multicul
turalism" as the cabinet's pre
ferred terminology.
"Multiculturalism" has "dif
ferent and sometimes inconsis
tent" meanings that reflect vary
ing perspectives on how the con
cept should be implemented and
how multicultural groups inter
act in relation to one another and
the University as a whole, accord
ing to the draft.
Instead of dealing with the
"ambiguous and politically and
emotionally fraught" term "mul
ticulturalism," the cabinet
prefers to focus on diversity and
"transculturalism," a term which
the draft describes as "a vision of
interaction rather than separa
tion."
The draft, however, still
employs the term "multicultural
ism" when referring to curricular
development.
But some are confused and
concerned about the implications
of the new terminology.
"I don't know where [the term
transculturalism] comes from,
and I don't know how it's differ
ent from multiculturalism,"
Camarillo said. "The same criti
cisms of 'multiculturalism' can
extend to 'transculturalism.' "
Silva also said she does not
understand what "transcultural
ism" means. "I don't see how [the
cabinet! sees it as a better
defined word."
Parker said she feels the cabi
net's discussion of the term
"transculturalism" diverts atten
tion from real issues by "playing
with words. It's rather ridiculous
at this point.
"Why do we have to pop up
with a new term every year?" she
asked. "Multiculturalism is not
such an explosive term that we
have to abandon it."
