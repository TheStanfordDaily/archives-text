EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.
(AP) â€” The Pittsburgh Penguins'
NHL-record 14-game playoff win
ning streak was halted Sunday by
the New Jersey Devils, who avert
ed a first-round sweep by defeat
ing the two-time Stanley Cup
champions 4-1.
Stephane Richer, scoreless in
the opening three games of the
series, had a goal and two assists,
and goalie Chris Terreri made 30
saves in frustrating Mario
Lemieux and Co.
The Penguins, who had an
overall 21-game (20-0-1) unbeat
en streak, can wrap up the best
of-7 series by winning Game 5
Monday night at Pittsburgh.
Maple Leafs 3, Red Wings 2
At Toronto, Dave Andrey
chuk's goal at 4:47 of the third
period lifted Toronto past Detroit
to tie the Norris Division playoff
series at two games apiece.
Kings 3, Flames 1
At Inglewood, Calif., rookie
Warren Rychel scored on a
rebound in the second period and
Pat Conacher added an empty-net

goal with six seconds remaining
as Los Angeles pulled into a 2-2
tie with Calgary in the best-of-7
Smythe Division series.
Another rookie, goaltender
Robb Stauber, made the most of
his first start in the playoffs with
several key saves for the Kings in
the final period.
The rookies carried the Kings
when the big names again went
bust. Wayne Gretzky, Luc
Robitaille, Tony Granato and
Tomas Sandstrom remained score
less in the playoffs. They combined
for 141 goals in the regular season.
Rychel's second goal of the
series came as he caught the puck
on a rebound and slid it in before
falling over downed Calgary goal
tender Jeff Reese, giving Los
Angeles a 2-1 lead at 4:48 of the
second period.
Blues 4, Blackhawks 3 OT
At St. Louis, Craig Janney
scored unassisted at 10:43 of over
time, giving the Blues a 4-3 victory
and a four-game sweep of Chicago
in a first-round playoff series.
The Blues outshot Chicago 6-3
in the extra period, and Black

hawks goalie Ed Belfour stopped
three good scoring chances in the
first two minutes. Included were
two from point-blank range by
Janney.
On the game-winner, Belfour
left the net to try to track down
the puck and couldn't get back in
time as Janney stopped a clearing
effort and shot from the left circle.
Canucks 3, Jets 1
At Winnipeg, Manitoba, Sergio
Momesso scored what proved to
be the game-winning goal and
goaltender Kirk McLean made 29
saves as Vancouver built a 3-1
lead over Winnipeg in their
Smyth Division series.
Momesso's goal at 3:18 of the
second period gave Vancouver a 2-
0 lead, more than enough for
McLean, who was often spectacu
lar. Vancouver added insurance
when Dana Murzyn scored into
an empty net with 1:15 to play.
That goal came seconds after
McLean had made a sparkling
save to frustrate Phil Housley's
attempt at a tying goal.
Vancouver can close out the
series Tuesday night at Vancouver.
