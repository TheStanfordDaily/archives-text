# Campus to honor Chavez tonight
## Chicano/Latino community plans memorial service 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Stanford's Chicano/Latino community will hold a
memorial celebration for Cesar Chavez, the nation
ally acclaimed union activist and community leader,
in the Casa Zapata dining hall at 7:30 p.m. today.
Chavez's efforts on behalf of farm workers will be
recalled by speakers and musical performances.
Plans for the campus-wide event include reflections
from those who worked with Chavez, as well as those
who knew the leader from marches or knew of him
through the coverage his efforts earned over the
years.
Father Eugene Boyle, assistant to the bishop of
San Jose, will be on hand to lend personal memories
of Chavez, and the musical group Flor del Pueblo
will perform.
A long-time Mexican-American hero of the farm
workers movement in California and nationwide,
Chavez was the driving force behind the United

Farm Workers Union. He passed away Friday at the
age of 66.
The memorial celebration will be an opportunity
for the Stanford community to reflect on the life of a
man who "devoted his whole life to the farmworkers.
He was responsible for unleashing the Chicano
movement," said Casa Zapata Resident Fellow Jose
Antonio Burciaga.
"He was out in the fields in the '62-'65 farmwork
ers movement... . For the first time the Chicano
movement had unity, leadership and purpose."
Chavez is represented in the "Last Supper of Chi
cano Heroes" mural in the Casa Zapata dining hall,
where an altar has been set up in his honor. When
the mural was painted in 1990, a poll was taken for
suggestions regarding which leaders should be fea
tured in the work; Chavez received the most votes.
This evening's activity is designed to educate
those who are not familiar with his work, as well as
to allow those whose life Chavez influenced to share
anecdotes, experiences and memories.
