# ASSU planning to offer limited summer storage
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
To meet student demands for summer
storage, the ASSU plans to purchase several
steel containers that will be available for
rental on a first-come, first-serve basis.
A proposal detailing the plan — by which
the containers will be purchased and placed
on empty land near Stanford Stadium —
will be presented to Dean of Students
Michael Jackson this week.
"We are trying our best to make sure
there is some storage this summer," said
Ying-Ying Goh, an ASSU senator and a
Council of Presidents' member-elect.
The University announced the discontin
uation of summer storage in residences last
spring, citing potential fire hazards and pro
hibitive costs as factors in the decision. Al
though many dorms retained storage this

past summer, the service will be eliminated
in all residences — including Row houses —
this June.
The ASSU first announced intentions of
providing alternate storage last spring. Al
though the proposal is still in the planning
stages, the ASSU has discussed purchasing
eight large containers measuring 5 feet
wide, 8 feet tall and 8 feet deep.
ASSU officials anticipate spending
$15,000 on the project and may even take a
loss to fund it, Goh said. "We will buy as
many [containers] as is economically feasi
ble, ".she said. "Our goal is not to make
money."
Goh said the new containers will be more
efficient than dorm storage because each
section will be color-coded to facilitate easy
identification.
However, she said liability is
the biggest question surrounding
the proposal. Because the contain
ers will be outside, students'
belongings will be less secure than
in dorms.
Though Goh said the contain
ers, "would not be 100 percent
secure," she added that, "You'd
have to have a blow torch to open
them."
To lessen the liability for the
ASSU and the University, stu
dents will have to sign a disclaimer
before storing their belongings.
Sophomore John Moore, who
plans on renting space at a storage
unit with friends, said he would
wonder about the security of his
possessions in the ASSU contain
ers.
Freshman Mark Greninger sees

another potential drawback to the
ASSU storage plan: "The only
problem with [the steel drums) is
that I could see them getting hot
and frying my stereo and comput
er equipment."
Because the proposal from the
ASSU will grant summer storage
on a first-come, first-serve basis,
some students will be forced to
arrange alternate storage plans.
The proposed containers "will be
nowhere near the capacity of sum
mer storage previously. There is no
way we can replace that," Goh said.
"I don't imagine [summer stor
age 1 will ever be back the way it
was two or three years ago," Jack
son said, emphasizing that, after
budget cuts, the University is "too
short-staffed to run a huge storage
operation for thousands of peo
ple."
"It's really in the students'
court at this point" Jackson said,
referring to the ASSU's plans to
provide alternate storage options.

Jackson said he wants the ASSU
plan wrapped up by May 7.
Calling the lack of University
storage "an inconvenience," fresh
man Chantel de la Rocha com
plained about the ASSU's delayed
action on the storage issue. "Since
the beginning of the year, the
ASSU kept telling us they would
fight for summer storage, but I
don't see many storage options
before me."
Area storage facilities are
already charting calls from Stan
ford students, and several report
ed tallying more inquiries about
summer rentals than usual.
Anticipating students' in
creased need to ship belongings,
Nomi Martin, Toyon Hall's office
coordinator, is working with Unit
ed Parcel Service to have more
trucks on campus at the end of
spring quarter. In previous years,
two UPS trucks have come to cam
pus during the last weeks of school
so students can send boxes home.
