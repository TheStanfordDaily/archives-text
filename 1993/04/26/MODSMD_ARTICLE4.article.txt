# ASSU planning to offer limited summer storage

To meet student demands for summer
storage, the ASSU plans to purchase several
steel containers that will be available for
rental on a first-come, first-serve basis.
A proposal detailing the plan — by which
the containers will be purchased and placed
on empty land near Stanford Stadium —
will be presented to Dean of Students
Michael Jackson this week.
"We are trying our best to make sure
there is some storage this summer," said
Ying-Ying Goh, an ASSU senator and a
Council of Presidents' member-elect.
The University announced the discontin
uation of summer storage in residences last
spring, citing potential fire hazards and pro
hibitive costs as factors in the decision. Al
though many dorms retained storage this

past summer, the service will be eliminated
in all residences — including Row houses —
this June.
The ASSU first announced intentions of
providing alternate storage last spring. Al
though the proposal is still in the planning
stages, the ASSU has discussed purchasing
eight large containers measuring 5 feet
wide, 8 feet tall and 8 feet deep.
ASSU officials anticipate spending
$15,000 on the project and may even take a
loss to fund it, Goh said. "We will buy as
many [containers] as is economically feasi
ble, ".she said. "Our goal is not to make
money."
Goh said the new containers will be more
efficient than dorm storage because each
section will be color-coded to facilitate easy
identification.
