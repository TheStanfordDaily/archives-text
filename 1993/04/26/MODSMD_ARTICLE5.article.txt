# Rude awakening
## Pranksters pull alarms in 7 dorms 
### Johnathon Briggs 
It wasn't the smell of breakfast that
awakened students in seven residences
across campus early Friday morning.
Instead, it was the sound of blaring fire
alarms — all of which turned out to be
false.
Shortly after midnight, fire alarms in
Larkin, Roble, Branner, Kimball, Madera
Paloma, and Ujamaa were pulled in rapid
succession within a 56-minute time peri
od, according to Palo Alto Fire Capt. Lee
Leonard.

The first alarm, which went off in
Roble, was pulled at 12:56 a.m., and the
last alarm, in Ujamaa, was pulled at 1:52
a.m., he said. All of the activated alarm
boxes were on the first floor next to acces
sible exits.
Police and fire officials said yesterday
that they are still trying to determine who
was responsible for the alarms. "We want
them to understand the consequences of
this," Leonard said.
But unless someone comes forward
with additional information,
Leonard said police and fire offi
cials "don't have much to go on."
The culprits "don't think it's a
serious crime, but it is. These (fire
alarms) are not toys to play with,"
he said.
Leonard said the numerous
false alarms created a potentially
dangerous situation not only for
Stanford, but for parts of Palo
Alto as well. Since only one fire

engine covers the entire Stanford
campus, another engine from
Palo Alto's Page Mill station had
to be called.
"The engine was not able to
handle possible emergencies in its
district because it was called here
. . . someone could have been hav
ing a heart attack," he said.
Fire officials, however, did
become suspicious after the first
two false alarms and alerted fire
fighters to respond rapidly, but
not in their most urgent mode.
Leonard said he suspects that
different students in each dorm
collaborated on the prank.

He emphasized that the stu
dents who pulled the alarms do
not realize the overall "negative
effects" of their behavior.
With frequent false alarms, he
said, students become skeptical
when they hear an alarm and tend
to stay in their rooms instead of
evacuating the building.
Waiting for firefighters to
arrive, many pajama-clad stu
dents found themselves waiting
outside for more than 15 minutes.
"I thought it was a very irrespon
sible prank," said freshman
Miguel Green, an Ujamaa resi
dent.
