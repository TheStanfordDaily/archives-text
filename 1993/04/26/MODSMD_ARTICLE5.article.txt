It wasn't the smell of breakfast that
awakened students in seven residences
across campus early Friday morning.
Instead, it was the sound of blaring fire
alarms â€” all of which turned out to be
false.
Shortly after midnight, fire alarms in
Larkin, Roble, Branner, Kimball, Madera
Paloma, and Ujamaa were pulled in rapid
succession within a 56-minute time peri
od, according to Palo Alto Fire Capt. Lee
Leonard.

The first alarm, which went off in
Roble, was pulled at 12:56 a.m., and the
last alarm, in Ujamaa, was pulled at 1:52
a.m., he said. All of the activated alarm
boxes were on the first floor next to acces
sible exits.
Police and fire officials said yesterday
that they are still trying to determine who
was responsible for the alarms. "We want
them to understand the consequences of
this," Leonard said.
