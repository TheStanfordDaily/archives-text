# From classrooms to community
## Conference examines university-town relationship 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Investing 5 percent of endowment
revenues in the community, requiring
students to perform community service
and opening up university classrooms to
local residents were just some of the sug
gestions put forth at Saturday's 10th
annual You Can Make A Difference Con
ference.
Titled "University and Community:
Bridging the Gap Between Town and
Gown," the conference focused on rela
tions between universities and their sur
rounding communities.

Dr. George McKenna, superinten
dent of the Inglewood School District in
Los Angeles, delivered a dynamic — and
often critical — closing oratory that
challenged the audience to go beyond
"individual acts of heroism" and truly
change the system.
Draping a brightly colored scarf made
of African textiles around his shoulders,
McKenna opened the keynote address by
saying he was "unapologetic about my
perspective |as an African-American
man]."
"The extent to which we pay atten
tion to the neediest is the extent to which
we are civilized," said McKenna, a for

mer high school principal who success
fully turned around an inner-city school
that had been devastated by violence and
low morale.
"The role of the university is only
being scratched at the surface. ... All
the work being done now is good but not
enough," he said.
"We need to teach our youth to
change the world," McKenna said,
stressing that students should be forced
to contribute to the community just as
they must go to class. "Algebra was not
voluntary for me," said the former
mathematician and engineer. "I
would have preferred to play bas
ketball."
"The question is how to institu
tionalize service," McKenna said.
"Can you imagine a school like Stan
ford that has a counseling program
as trained as the football team?"
Indiana University President
Thomas Ehrlich, in his opening
keynote address, also emphasized
students' obligation to serve the
community.
Because Indiana is a public insti
tution, it has a special responsibility
to the community, he said. But he
also pointed out that research uni
versities like Stanford and MIT
receive just as much money from
federal and state governments.
"We sometimes think of a sharp
line between public and private
institutions," Ehrlich said. "That
line is very blurry now."
In the panel discussion that fol
lowed, community members
offered their views on how Stan
ford can be a better neighbor. The
consensus was that Stanford is not
doing enough.

"Tutoring is wonderful, but
where is the effort to change the
system?" asked panelist Stephen
Viederman, to loud applause.
Viederman, president of an
environmental-rights foundation,
suggested that the university
invest part of its endowment in the
community to "empower the peo
ple [and] show that you truly are a
good neighbor."
When pressed later, Viederman
stressed that "it was not an off
hand remark," and suggested a 5
percent figure for schools like
Stanford.
East Palo Alto Mayor Sharifa
Wilson suggested that the Stan
ford "open its doors" to communi
ty residents, allowing them to sit in
on classes.
Rep. Anna Eshoo added that
institutions must exercise a sense
of humility "because the commu
nity can teach as well."
The rest of the day was filled
with events including workshops
an opportunities fair highlighting
a number of community and stu
dent organizations, and plenary
sessions focusing on a variety of
specific topics such as "The Reper
cussions of University Research"
and"The Economic Impact of a
University."
