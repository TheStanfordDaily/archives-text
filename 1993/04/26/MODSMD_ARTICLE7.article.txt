After 10 months of construc
tion, the new Haas Center for
Public Service officially opened its
doors Friday afternoon, at a dedi
cation ceremony attended by a
crowd of more than 250.
To mark the occasion, the
Haas Center sign, which had
adorned Owen House since 1984,
was symbolically transferred by
the crowd between the two hous
es and hung above the porch of
the new building.
"It's a dream come true for
Stanford," said Assoc. University
Counsel Robin Kennedy, who
was among those taking self
guided tours of the three-story
$3.35 million building before the
ceremony. "It's exciting to think
of the generations of student vol
unteers that will pass through

this building."
Visitors mingled with student
volunteers and enjoyed perfor
mances by members of the
Caribbean Students Association,
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and
the Pilipino American Student
Union in the Ford Community
Courtyard on the back patio of the
building.
The Courtyard is named after
Tom Ford, chair of the Public Ser
vice Advisory Board, who led the
fund-raising campaign for the
new building.
Welcoming the crowd assem
bled on the center's front lawn,
University President Gerhard
Casper warmly praised his prede
cessor's initiative in encouraging
public service. The center was es

The center is named for the
Haas family, which endowed it
with $6.2 million in 1989. Both
Miriam and Peter Haas attended
the ceremony, and Ms. Haas said a
few words to the crowd, emphasiz
ing people's ability "to make a dif
ference" through public service.
In closing remarks, Common
Cause founder John Gardner, the

said: "History never looks like his
tory when you're going through
it, but history will be made in this
flagship disguised as a house."
