# Is there intelligent life?
## Renowned astronomer Sagan speaks on detecting life on Earth from space

There is intelligent life on
Earth.
At least, that's what renowned
astronomer Carl Sagan claims.
In a Friday afternoon speech,
Sagan spoke to a packed crowd of
over 700 in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um, addressing the question, "Is
There Intelligent Life on Earth?"
"The conclusion is wildly posi
tive," Sagan said. However, he
added that this is not evident by
merely observing Earth from
outer space, and sometimes what
is visible does not attest to this in
telligence.
Mixing humor with science,
Sagan went on to explain what ex
actly can be seen from above
Earth's atmosphere, as he pre
sented charts and photographs of

the planet taken from the Galileo
spacecraft.
"Look at what's visible from
space," Sagan said, "bovine flatu
lence, sushi and a means for
launching missiles . . . any one of
which can destroy 200 cities."
The bovine flatulence Sagan
spoke of is the level of methane in
the atmosphere, which indicates
that life exists on the planet.
Sushi referred to the Japanese
squid-Fishing fleet whose lights
can be seen from space at night.
But despite these signs of life,
Sagan said, "You cannot see an
enormous amount of our art,
music, literature, culture, sci
ence, lor] compassion. . ." If any
extra-terrestrials were to view the
Earth from orbit, he said, they
would not get a true sense of the
human race.
However, Sagan also suggested
that the destruction visible from
space may call into question this
claim of intelligence. Considering
the depletion of topsoil on the
earth, the release of industrial
pollutants into the air and fires
burning all across the Amazon
rain forest, he said, "It surely will
be necessary to reassess the pre
liminary conclusion that there's

intelligent life on Earth."
Sagan also criticized "geo-cen
tric" views that are prevalent
today, as he reviewed the progress
of science and development of
human intelligence over the years.
From Copernicus to Einstein,
he said, scientists and
astronomers have made observa
tions that take away from Earth's
prominence in the universe.
"Every step was a kind of compro
mise in which people attempted to
rescue centrality in some other
way," said Sagan.
He said he is dismayed, howev
er, that despite these consistent
attempts to destroy geo-centric

views, many people today still
cannot talk about the Earth with
out being geo-centric. "We talk
about 'the world' . . . leven
though] we're one of ... a billion
worlds."
Sagan was invited to deliver
the 12th-annual Bunyan lecture,
a speech dedicated to science.
He is presently a professor of
astronomy and space sciences at
Cornell University. He has
authored several books including
"Contact," "The Dragons of
Eden," "Broca's Brain" and
"Comet." He is also well known
for his public television series
"Cosmos."
