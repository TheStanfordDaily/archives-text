Hi!

Our recombinant DNA technology has
yielded products that help people combat
a variety of serious medical conditions.
And, with four FDA-approvcd products
and many more in clinical trials, we've
proven our long-term commitment to
advances in biotechnology.
To continue this, we invest 50% of our
annual revenues in research which
enables us to concentrate on new projects
every year. And, has resulted in the on
going expansion of our research facilities.
Our most important investment, however,
is in our people. We find the best possible
people for every area of our organization.
People who share our commitment
to changing the shape of the
biotechnology industry.
Shape your career.
Attend our information session on
Thursday, April 29th from 5-6:30 PM.
Our on-campus interviews will be on
Friday, April 30th. We actively support
and promote affirmative action and equal
employment opportunity. Women and
minorities are encouraged to attend.
