# Smoke-free
## University considering policy to ban smoking indoors, cigarette sales 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Spurred by studies showing the danger of sec
ond-hand smoke, the University is considering
prohibiting smoking in all indoor facilities and
banning the sale of cigarettes on campus start
ing next school year.
The proposal, which has already been pre
sented to the Board of Trustees and the Univer
sity Cabinet, will be reviewed at a faculty round
table discussion tomorrow, according to Tom
Matteoli, the director of employee relations and
development.
According to Matteoli, studies on the hazards
of second-hand smoke have shown that "passive
smoking" increases the chances of lung disease.
He said the University is also concerned with
keeping its policy "in line with that of other in
stitutions."
Matteoli, who framed the proposal for a
smoke-free environment, said a copy of the poli
cy will be printed in Campus Report for review
and comment by students, faculty and staff. The
proposed policy is a revision of the University's
current smoking policy.
According to officials at Tresidder Union, the
policy's stipulation that "tobacco products will
not be sold at the University" will have consider-
able financial impact on Tresidder
Express, the only campus store
that sells cigarettes.
Such a prohibition would sig
nificantly decrease the store's rev
enue, according to Paul Szczesiul,
Tresidder's associate director.
"Currently, cigarettes make up
almost 10 percent of sales there,
so it's a significant piece of busi
ness," he said. "[The new policy!
may necessitate renegotiation of
the store's lease from the Univer
sity."
Tresidder Express representa
tive Ken Shark agreed that
cigarettes make up a "significant
amount of revenue" for the store,
which is owned by the Bookstore.
"You can't substitute another
product in the place of
cigarettes," he said.
"We support the no-smoking
concept, and are happy to comply
if the rules change and we can't
sell tobacco," he said. "But let's
change the (lease) agreement to
reflect that."

Currently, the lease agree
ment mandates the Bookstore
pay the University 10 percent of
Tresidder Express' gross profits
or a minimum $120,000 annual
ly. In 1990-91, the store grossed
$1,191,731 and the Bookstore
paid $120,000 rent. But if sales
fall 10 percent and the lease
agreement remains the same, the
Bookstore could lose about
$12,000 a year on the deal.
Some student smokers said
they feel a ban on campus
cigarette sales is too harsh.
"Enough with this trendy health
fascism," senior Doug Sims said.
"How do they have the right to
restrict the marketplace?"
Senior Elizabeth Witchel, who
purchases cigarettes at Tresidder
Express regularly, said a ban
would inconvenience her. "I can't
get off campus, so I have to buy
here," she said.
However, since smoking is
already currently banned iri many
University buildings, the portion
of the proposal prohibiting it in all
indoor facilities will probably not
have much of an effect on smok
ers.
"You generally can't smoke

indoors in the first place," said
Mushtaq Kahn, a graduate stu
dent in economics, adding that he
was not disturbed by the propos
al's guidelines.
The proposal officially pro
hibits smoking in "enclosed build
ings and facilities and covered
walkways," in University vehicles
and during any indoor or outdoor
"University sponsored" events,
including athletic events.
Smoking will still be permitted
outdoors as long as such areas are
"located far enough away from
from doorways, open windows
and ventilation systems to pre
vent smoke from entering."
Current University policy
states that "smoking is prohibit
ed in indoor locations where
smokers and non-smokers occupy
the same area," such as class
rooms, libraries and computer
facilities.
However, students can cur
rently smoke in their dorm
rooms if they live alone or can
reach an agreement with their
roommates to make their rooms
"smoking rooms." In addition,
up to one-third of dining areas
and lounges can be smoking

areas if adequate ventilation
exists; entire lounges can be des
ignated smoking if duplicate
non-smoking areas exist; and
rooms with closed doors can be
designated "smoking permit
ted," if non-smokers don't need
to use them.
Provisions for enforcement of
the new policy are vague, saying
only that it "relies on the
thoughtfulness, consideration
and cooperation of smokers and
non-smokers." However, the pro
posal's current draft states that
faculty, staff and students who
"repeatedly violate the policy
may be subject to corrective
action."
Matteoli said that while about
25 percent of all Americans
smoke, less than 8 percent of the
Stanford population does.
"We're very happy with that
figure," he said. "And hopefully
with the new policy we can get
that even lower."
Suggestions for possible
changes from the Stanford com
munity will be "considered before
this is finally submitted for
approval," Matteoli said. "A policy
of this nature affects all students,
