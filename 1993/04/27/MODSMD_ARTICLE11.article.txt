Cult started fire
WACO, Texas (AP) — Independent
arson investigators yesterday supported
FBI claims that members of a doomsday
cult started a fire that consumed their
prairie compound in a suicidal inferno a
week ago.
"We believe it was intentionally set by
persons inside the compound," said Paul
Gray, who headed the investigation team.
"At least two locations were signifi
cantly distant enough from each other
that they couldn't have been set by the
same source at the same time."
The FBI has said the fire was set by
Branch Davidian members. Some of the
nine survivors have said the fire began

when an FBI tank that punched holes
through a wall knocked over a burning
lantern.
Clinton gets mixed marks
NEW YORK (AP) — As President
Clinton nears his 100 th day in office,
almost half of Americans in an Associated
Press poll say he already has broken
promises too often. But about the same
number consider him a strong leader.
The leadership measure could be cru
cial for a president trying to push an agen
da of change after winning only 43 per
cent of the vote in November.Those polled
regard Clinton as a strong leader 49 per
cent to 37 percent, with the rest unsure.
