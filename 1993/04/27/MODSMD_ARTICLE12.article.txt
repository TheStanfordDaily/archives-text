# Serb leaders deny peace plan

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) â€”
The first cracks appeared yesterday
between Bosnian Serbs and their patrons
in Belgrade when the Serbian leadership
in Bosnia ignored a sharply worded
appeal from Serbia's president.
With tougher sanctions set to begin
today that would basically impound any
Yugoslav planes, trains and ships that
operate abroad, Serbian President Slobo
dan Milosevic urged the ad hoc assembly
to accept an international peace plan to
end more than a year of fighting in
Bosnia.
The assembly, meeting in the north
eastern Bosnia town of Bijejjina, had met
in hurried session Sunday night but in
the end, its 77 representatives voted
unanimously against accepting a U.N.-
sponsored plan to end fighting in Bosnia

that has left 134,000 people dead and
missing the past year.
Bosnia's Serbs are dependent on
Yugoslavia for supplies and moral sup
port, so without Yugoslav backing, they
face the prospect of being totally cut off.
The assembly's rejection of the peace
plan, however, sets the stage for tough,
new international sanctions to go into
effect against Yugo-slavia.
It also may bolster the arguments of
those in the West and the Islamic world
who say only force will make Bosnian
Serbs end fighting in which they've cap
tured 70 percent of Bosnia.
The plan would require Bosnian Serbs
to give up one-fifth of what they cap
tured.
It also would require 10 regions of
Bosnia-Herzegovina to be divided, with

three provinces each for Bosnian Serbs,
Croats and Muslims, and joint adminis
tration over the 10th, the capital district
of Sarajevo.
Milosevic's bid to unite Serbs through
out the former Yugoslav federation in a
"Greater Serbia" is widely seen among
his foes as the chief reason for the blood
shed.
While enforcement of the new sanc
tions remains an uncertainty, Milosevic
appeared deeply concerned.
Yugoslavs "will keep on expressing
solidarity," he said in an appeal to the
Bosnian Serbs.
The new sanctions include freezing
Yugoslav public and private funds in over
seas banks, barring Yugoslav ships from
foreign territory, and blockading Yugoslav
goods on the vital Danube River.
