## Diverse or divided? 
### 
Administration should
make new UCMI panel
as diverse as Stanford

Review and reform
often come clothed in
euphemism and political cor
rectness.
Diversity, race and culture roll
off our tongues as interchangeably
as "investment" and "contribu
tion" do for some government fig
ures.
But when people slyly substi
tute words for ideas, i.e. "transcul
turalism" in lieu of "multicultural
ism," it's time to watch what they
do, not what they say.
On Thursday, a proposal to the
University Cabinet will suggest
that an internal review of the
University Committee on Minori
ty Issues (UCMI) would consti
tute a "more credible and persua
sive" point of view than the varied
panel of faculty, staff, students
and outside sources of the past
few years.
However, this would hardly
seem to be the case if the review
board is to consist solely of com
mittees arranged by the provost, as
per the proposal. In order to be
effective, these committees must
truly represent a wide range of
viewpoints, including students'.
While the University states that
a "diversity of viewpoints" will be
represented on the panel, it would
be hard-pressed to match the cur
rent UCMI panel in this regard. It
is difficult to see how this particu
lar revision in the process would
contribute to the ideal of a wide
spectrum of opinions.
More disturbingly, the proposal
seems to shut out any place for the
students' voice in the matter. In
addition, the manner in which the
announcement of the proposal
took place leaves little room for
confidence.
Though the University made a
commitment to keep student lead

ers informed in the matter, it
wasn't until anonymous photo
copies of the proposal made their
way into campus ethnic communi
ty centers that students were
aware of it.
The University reluctance to
encourage discussion on the mat
ter is disturbing; student voices
should and must be represented on
the panel.
After all, the UCMI was first
instituted in response to student
concerns. Within the Stanford
campus, it is the students who are
most involved with issues of multi
culturalism and diversity on an
everyday level. These issues come
into play constantly in ethnic-cul
tural associations, theme houses
and continual contact with a
diverse population.
And consequently it is also the
students who must have a repre
sentative voice that will be heard
by the policymakers.
This acute necessity is shown by
the dissent already brewing
between student leaders and the
review panel on the issue of fund
ing. While the panel believes that
student ethnic community centers
have not suffered disproportion
ately from recent budget cuts, cen
ter coordinators disagree.
Even if the panel is correct, the
fact that there is a difference in
opinion demonstrates the poten
tial for a lack of communication
between administration and stu
dents.
Finally, while it might be
admirable for the proposal to
attempt to seek an end to a
described "self-segregation" among
campus groups, the use of the word
"transculturalism" does not begin
to address the deep debate on
assimilation or diversity or the
compromises involved.
If the University desires to inte
grate its communities by the use
of semantics, it would be well
advised to first consult the opin
ions and feelings of the student
community.
The issues of multiculturalism
and assimilation are too important
to do otherwise.
