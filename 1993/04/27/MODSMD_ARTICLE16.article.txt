# John Ford
## Double edges and jeopardy 
### 
/F EVERY PERSON who represented
law and order beat you up .. . how in
the hell do you expect a man to be
patriotic?
Answer: You can't.
The quote comes from a World-War-I
era unionist, but its message doesn't lose
a bit of its meaning when applied to the
modern-day ordeal of Rodney King and
others like him.
The ordeals of those like Rodney King
— whose faces never appear in any news
papers, not even "A Current Affair" —
have much less to do with courtroom
gavels than eager nightsticks. Their tri
als never come to court. Their justice
comes in cruel varieties: "nigger" jokes,
inadequate education or maybe just a
couple of guys named Koon and Powell.
It's hard to blame the disenfran
chised, whose voices scarcely register an
echo when aimed at the walls of Wash
ington, for feeling unpatriotic. It's hard
to blame them for considering the ver
dict in the recent trial as some kind of
perverted baseball score: 2-2, justice and
injustice deadlocked in America.
It's hard to blame them for wanting
justice to win by any means necessary,
even if it means violating the Constitu
tion. To Rodney King and those like
him, a good "constitution" is a body
without track marks or bruises from
recent police blows. It has precious little
to do with the piece of paper that gov

erns our land.
And so if the principles written on
that yellowed paper must be violated to
get justice — as happened in the re-try
ing of the four police officers involved in
the beating — well then, they would say
that's just too bad.
But the troubling issue remains.
Within the Fifth Amendment lies a "dou
ble jeopardy" clause which states that no
person shall be prosecuted twice for the
same crime in the same jurisdiction.
The second trial of the four police
officers was allowed on the basis of pre
vious court rulings which have deter
mined that a prior state trial does not
prevent a federal trial because the two
are considered two different jurisdic
tions with two different sets of laws.
But we can't deny it: the men were
standing trial for the same thing. After
the rioting of last year, it became a polit
ical necessity for the government to take
some kind of legal action, if only to calm
the people. So the government did. If
only to calm the people.
They tried the police officers for the
same thing as the state did. And despite
cosmetic wording changes in the charges,
legal experts say state and federal prose
cutors had to prove essentially the same
points. If that's not double jeopardy, I'd
be hard pressed to say what is.
Worrying over this issue shouldn't
seem insensitive to Rodney King. It's

worth remembering that when we make
a habit out of violating constitutional
principles, it's the Rodney Kings who
end up suffering. And it is not hard to
imagine the continued violation of dou
ble jeopardy ending up as a part of Amer
ica's nightmares rather than its dreams.
There were better ways to deal with
the first acquittal than to simply put the
officers on trial again. There is protest.
There is education. There are better
solutions than seeking revenge on four
people when the problem occurs nation
wide. And perhaps ironically, but per
haps not, the government's second trial
did a lot to defuse the search for those
better solutions because it gave us a
false sense that justice is served in
America.
The second trial had two results: the
unconstitutional punishment of two
individual police officers and a new con
tentment with race relations in the
United States. We should ask ourselves
— do either of these two things point to
a better America?

John Ford does well in jeopardy, but
those increased dollar values in double
jeopardy, where anything can happen,
just kill him.
