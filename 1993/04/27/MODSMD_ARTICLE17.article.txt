Calm debate over new major should replace theatrics

ON APRIL 19, 1993, some 70 per
sons convened in White Plaza to
protest the absence of an Asian -
American studies major at Stanford Uni
versity. Such political demonstrations
have been fashionable at American uni
versities since the 19605.
Rather than advance their arguments
in a rational, discursive way through the
many channels available in the Universi
ty, those demonstrators chose to politi
cize their demands and resort to noise
making, invoking symbols and marching
to the University president's office. In so
doing, they joined a cavalcade of political
animals that ranges from groups
demanding divestiture from South

Africa to Vietnam War protesters.
Unable to articulate their views in a
cool, rational way, these demonstrators,
like their counterparts of previous
decades, believe they have some innate
right to disturb the life of those around
them in the University in order to
advance their own particular demands.
There are two issues here that
require sensible debate. First, why
should the University tolerate any form
of political demonstration, whether it is
for initiating an Asian-American studies
major at Stanford University or for any
other special-interest cause? The univer
sity is a sacred institution created for
rational, logical discussion and not for

ranting and raving.
Second, according to what reasonable
standards should a university consider
going to the expense of establishing a
new major solely devoted to Asian-Amer
ican studies, or for that matter to Afro-
American studies, Jewish studies, femi
nist studies, gay studies, cult studies and
all the rest?
There may well be sensible reasons
why Stanford's resources should be allo
cated to developing laboratories and lec
ture programs to study these topics, but
I have yet to be convinced that such rea
sons are compelling, because their pro
tagonists never seem able to conceptual
ize their standards and support them

with reliable information.
By creating programs of mediocre
majors in ethnic and gender studies, uni
versities have done their students a great
disservice, neither educating them nor
preparing them to be citizens of the world.
Perhaps those who beat the taiko
drums so enthusiastically in White Plaza
could be encouraged to sit down and
draft a rational argument lucidly
explaining why Stanford University
should go to great expense in establish
ing another ethnic major program of
highly questionable value.
