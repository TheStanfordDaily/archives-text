# Irish-American major deserves consideration
## 
### 
On April 20, The Daily ran a front-page
article about the demand for an Asian-
American Studies msyor which began with
the misleading statement "Stanford
boasts majors in African-American and
Feminist Studies." The mtyor commonly
referred to as "Afro-Am" is really the
African and Afro-American Studies
AAAS is interdisciplinary â€” incorporating
African, Afro-American and Afro-
Caribbean studies, and sharing course
listings with 14 other departments.
Since Afro-American Studies must be
viewed within the context of African his
tory and culture, an Afro-American
Studies rntyor would have too narrow of
a focus. Asian-American Studies also
must be viewed within the context of
Asian history and culture. Stanford
should increase the number of course
offerings on Asian-American Studies,
but should not establish an Asian-Amer
ican Studies mtgor.
Instead, Stanford should build an
Asian and Asian-American Studies

major, and should do so in a manner
that will not undermine the present
East Asian Studies major. The American
public knows very little about Asian-
American history, and Stanford's lack of
Asian-American Studies classes perpetu
ates this problem.
The Stanford curriculum has disrespect
ed other ethnic groups as well. For
instance, at an estimated population of 40
million, Irish-Americans comprise the sec
ond-largest ethnic group in the United
States. However, no Stanford course focus
es on Irish or Irish-American history (a few
English classes study Irish literature).
While most present-day Irish-Ameri
cans have assimilated into the white main
stream, Irish-Americans have a unique
history and culture which has been largely
ignored by the academic world.
At noon on Thursday, April 29, there
will be a brief meeting at the fountain in
White Plaza (the "Claw") to draw up a
formal demand for an introductory
Irish/Irish-American Studies class, and
to discuss the possibility of forming an
Irish-American Student Association.
