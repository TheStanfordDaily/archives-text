# Ford neglects the need for Gender Studies DR
## 
### 
Ah, the irony.
The placement of John Ford's April
20 column ("The sad plight of the
frosh") directly next to The Daily's edi
torial entitled "Striving for equality"
couldn't have been planned any better.
"Women comprise only 16 percent of
Engineering graduate students," the edito
rial reminds us. Women make up "only 5
to 8 percent of scholars teaching business,
economics and the more technical sci
ences," it frowns. The piece ends with the
plea, "attention to the issue of women's
equity on campus must not wane."
And Ford wonders why we need a
Gender Studies distribution require
ment?
Not only that, but he supports his
criticism of Gender Studies by pointing
out the inadequacies of an entirely unre
lated course, CSIOSA. One must specu
late if Ford has ever taken a Gender
Studies class himself.
Don't knock it if you haven't tried it!
He goes on to call mathematics one of

the "significant departments" on cam
pus, implying that Gender Studies is
insignificant, representing more "unful
filled promises of glamour and glitz than
any real, substantial engagement with
the subject."
You want reality? Try checking out
the facts presented in the editorial that
appeared next to your column on Tues
day. If you haven't realized it by now,
education is the only way we can hope to
change some of the gender inequalities
that exist in this country.
It's true that not every Stanford stu
dent enjoys having to take certain class
es to fulfill their distribution require
ments. And maybe you did take the easi
est blow-off classes you could find, for a
pass/NC grade, and considered it a total
waste of time.
I, for one, would like to give other
Stanford students a little more credit. If
nothing else, students will come away
from Gender Studies courses with a
greater awareness of the many forms of
oppression women face in our society
today.
At least it's a beginning.
