# Sexual harassment policy under fire
## Draft criticized for vagueness, lack of student input and confidentiality clause 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
The public-response period for the
current draft of the University's sexu
al-harassment policy is drawing to a
close, but numerous student and staff
concerns may render the final leg of the
road to approval a rocky one.
Members of campus women's orga
nizations have criticized the draft —
the first published draft of the plan —
for a lack of student input, a weak con
fidentiality clause and ambiguity in
various areas. However, many also
praised the policy's strong stances
against certain consensual sexual rela
tionships — such as those between fac
ulty and students — and against sexu
al harassment in general.
The policy work group, which has
been writing and redrafting the policy
over the past two years, will be accept
ing responses to the document from
the Stanford community until April 30.
The University hopes to have the
final policy, which will replace the cur
rent 15-year-old policy, approved by
the end of the academic year, a deadline
set by University President Gerhard
Casper.
Student involvement?
Several students have expressed
concern about what they perceive as a
lack of receptiveness to their sugges
tions and input in the formulation of a

policy that will significantly affect
them.
Part of the concern stems from re
marks Casper made at a recent visit to
the Women's Center.
"Casper met [at the center] for 10
minutes a couple of weeks ago, and ba-

sically said we
shouldn't criticize the
draft too much be
cause the first priority
was to pass it — it
could be fixed later,"
said senior Margaret
Solomon, a member of
the Women's Center
Collective. "I definite
ly feel like he was just

telling us not to rock the boat."
While she sympathized with
Casper's frustration with "the long,
two-year process" of drafting the poli
cy, Solomon said she also felt that he
was "not encouraging input to come up
with the best possible policy."
Solomon said she was not reassured
by Casper's promise that the policy,
once passed, will be revised if neces
sary. She said that after the policy is
passed, "people will be sick of it, and
after the long process of coming up
with it they won't want to change it."
In response, Casper said that while
he was "not discouraging any com
ments whatsoever," he wanted to make
clear that debate cannot continue in
definitely, and he had every intention

of meeting his end-of-the-academic
year deadline.
"This project has been going on for
entirely too long," Casper said. "If
there are mtyor objections, they should
be raised, but I don't think we should
worry about crossing every't' and dot
ting every 'i.' "
At the meeting at the center, Casper

said he stated that the policy would not
be "written in stone," but that he "sim
ply did not want to go another academ
ic year without a policy."
Furthermore, the drafting process
has been open for comment from stu
dents and all University community
