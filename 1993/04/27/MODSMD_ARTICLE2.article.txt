# Sexual harassment policy under fire
## Draft criticized for vagueness, lack of student input and confidentiality clause 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
The public-response period for the
current draft of the University's sexu
al-harassment policy is drawing to a
close, but numerous student and staff
concerns may render the final leg of the
road to approval a rocky one.
Members of campus women's orga
nizations have criticized the draft —
the first published draft of the plan —
for a lack of student input, a weak con
fidentiality clause and ambiguity in
various areas. However, many also
praised the policy's strong stances
against certain consensual sexual rela
tionships — such as those between fac
ulty and students — and against sexu
al harassment in general.
The policy work group, which has
been writing and redrafting the policy
over the past two years, will be accept
ing responses to the document from
the Stanford community until April 30.
The University hopes to have the
final policy, which will replace the cur
rent 15-year-old policy, approved by
the end of the academic year, a deadline
set by University President Gerhard
Casper.
Student involvement?
Several students have expressed
concern about what they perceive as a
lack of receptiveness to their sugges
tions and input in the formulation of a

policy that will significantly affect
them.
Part of the concern stems from re
marks Casper made at a recent visit to
the Women's Center.
"Casper met [at the center] for 10
minutes a couple of weeks ago, and ba-

sically said we
shouldn't criticize the
draft too much be
cause the first priority
was to pass it — it
could be fixed later,"
said senior Margaret
Solomon, a member of
the Women's Center
Collective. "I definite
ly feel like he was just

telling us not to rock the boat."
While she sympathized with
Casper's frustration with "the long,
two-year process" of drafting the poli
cy, Solomon said she also felt that he
was "not encouraging input to come up
with the best possible policy."
Solomon said she was not reassured
by Casper's promise that the policy,
once passed, will be revised if neces
sary. She said that after the policy is
passed, "people will be sick of it, and
after the long process of coming up
with it they won't want to change it."
In response, Casper said that while
he was "not discouraging any com
ments whatsoever," he wanted to make
clear that debate cannot continue in
definitely, and he had every intention

of meeting his end-of-the-academic
year deadline.
"This project has been going on for
entirely too long," Casper said. "If
there are mtyor objections, they should
be raised, but I don't think we should
worry about crossing every't' and dot
ting every 'i.' "
At the meeting at the center, Casper

said he stated that the policy would not
be "written in stone," but that he "sim
ply did not want to go another academ
ic year without a policy."
Furthermore, the drafting process
has been open for comment from stu
dents and all University community


Casper
members "for years," Casper
pointed out. The lack of continu
ity of students who respond has
resulted in the misperception that
students were not involved, he
said.
"We have a new generation (of
students) that may or may not
have been consulted," he said.
"But if we open debate all the
time, we'll never have anything."
But sophomore Esther Conrad,
a member of the collective, said
she feels a lack of student input is
reflected in the draft. She noted
that students may not be comfort
able with the policy because of its
lack of clarity and its weak confi
dentiality clause.
"When I sit down and read it, it
really scares me because I really
don't know what I would do if I
were harassed," Conrad said.
Students also said that the pol
icy needs to clarify what students'
roles will be in the response net
work, which will consist of sexual
harassment advisers, a sexual
harassment panel and an advis
er/coordinator, said third-year
graduate student Winnie Poster,
a member of the Graduate
Women's Network.
However, Barbara Butterfield,
the vice president for faculty and
staff services, said interested stu
dents as well as faculty and staff
members will have the opportuni
ty to fill the roles of the advisers
and panel members.
Members of the Stanford com
munity can also get involved in
the policy's development through
written responses to the work

group, which will be compiled and
submitted as recommendations to
Casper, Butterfield said.
Further discussion with the
University Cabinet and possibly
the Faculty Senate will follow,
and approval of a final policy is
expected by the end of the aca
demic year.
Confidentiality concerns
The strongest objections to the
policy draft raised by members of
the women's community concern
what they feel is a weak or nonex
istent protection of the identity of
people who report harassment.
The current draft's confiden
tiality clause departed from a
stronger statement in the earliest
draft, which prohibited the
release of a complainant's identity
to "the press, parents or others"
without the "individual's express
consent."
The latest draft states that in
order for someone to file a com
plaint of sexual harassment, he
or she must make a claim
"against a specific, named indi
vidual," and "must consent to
being identified to the subject of
the complaint."
In addition, the draft outlines a
"formal" procedure for reporting
sexual harassment through the
University's existing academic
grievance process. Poster pointed
out that students are "dissatis
fied" because, as outlined by the
policy, the first step of the process
is to approach the alleged perpe
trator.
Caroline Mitchell, sexual
assault prevention outreach edu
cator, said she and others have

read the policy draft to mean that
complainants will "automatically
be identified," which will "com
pletely discouraged people from
coming forward."
While she acknowledges that
confidentiality cannot be protect
ed in all cases, Mitchell said a
complainant's identity needs to be
kept confidential in all cases when
identification is not legally
required.
However, work group mem
bers say the issue is not that sim
ple. Senior University Counsel
Susan Hoerger, a work group
member, said there is tension
between the University's obliga
tion to promptly and fully investi
gate complaints of sexual harass
ment and the complainant's
desire not to be identified.
"There are so many interests
involved — the University obliga
tion to state and federal laws,
complainants, subjects of com
plaints," Hoerger said. "We don't
want to put forth the possibility of
promising confidentiality that
can't be delivered."
Stephanie Kalfayan — a for
mer University of Chicago sexual
harassment complaint adviser
who worked as a consultant with
the work group several drafts ago
— explained that through her
practical experience with harass
ment complaints, she has realized
that confidentiality is a "very dif
ficult issue to deal with."
"While there can be a certain
level of assurance of confidentiali
ty, sometimes it is incumbent
upon the University to act and
confidentiality cannot be kept,"
Kalfayan said.

Some say the lack of confiden
tiality assurance is a particularly
significant problem for graduate
women, who are not only more
likely to experience harassment,
but also tend to have more at risk
when they file a complaint.
Nationally, one out of every
five undergraduate women and
one out of every three graduate
women are harassed to the extent
that it meets the legal definition
of sexual harassment, said Fran
Gibson, the Sexual Assault Infor
mation Resource Center coordi
nator.
Poster, of the Graduate Wo
men's Network, pointed out that
if a graduate student files a com
plaint against an adviser or a fac
ulty member within their depart
ment, he or she "could be essen
tially cut off from everything"
within the department, including
research funds, teaching assistant
jobs and grades.
Furthermore, Poster said she
feels the draft does not ensure
enough protection from retalia
tion from the alleged perpetrator.
"There is only one line in the pol
icy that says there will be no
repercussions, but it is not clear
who is going offer protection and
whether it is assured."
Policy too vague?
Members of the women's com
munity also say the draft lacks
clarity and completeness in vari
ous areas, further hindering stu
dents from effectively using it.
"The document is really con
fusing," said Sara Horsley, a
Women's Center Collective mem
ber, pointing out that students

simply will not use a policy they
do not understand.
"It is unclear who we're sup
posed to go to in what cases, and
when we can expect to express a
complaint or concern confiden
tially if we're harassed," said
Horsley, a sophomore. She added
that many students share her
confusion about the current
three-page draft, which has been
pared down from an approximate
ly seven-page draft.
Mitchell said she was also con
cerned about the definitions of
"complaints versus non-com
plaints and informal versus for
mal processes" for reporting sexu
al harassment outlined in the pol
icy.
The work group has received
comments regarding the lack of
clarity between the informal and
formal processes of reporting,
said work group member Mary
Edmonds, the vice provost for
student affairs. She said the
group will try to clear up the defi
nitions of "formal and informal."
Some students added that
there are areas where they felt the
existing draft needed to be fleshed
out and pointed out some harass
ment situations that should be
addressed in the policy.
For example, Gibson said, care
needs to be taken in cases where
sexual harassment crosses the
line into sexual assault. Protect
ing confidentiality needs are
especially important in these
cases, she added. Nationally, 10
percent of all sexual-harassment
incidences involving a faculty
member and student are techni
cally defined as sexual assault,

she said.
Pointing to another perceived
shortfall, Conrad said the draft
only focuses on harassment in the
classroom, and does not acknowl
edge harassment in student resi
dences.
A 'strong stance'
Despite numerous concerns
and criticisms regarding imple
mentation of the plan, many
applauded the draft's introducto
ry policy statement that speaks
out against sexual harassment
and strongly warns against con
sensual relationships, such as
those between students and fac
ulty.
According to Gibson, 16 to 18
percent of graduate and under
graduate students nationwide
have had at least one consensual
sexual relationship with a teach
ing assistant or faculty member.
Although consensual relation
ships "might be protected under
the Constitution, a relationship
where there's an imbalance of
power can be a problem if the stu
dent wishes to end a relationship
with someone who has the power
to award and withdraw academic
merit," Gibson said.
Applauding the draft's state
ments that sexual harassment is
intolerable, Conrad said she felt
the policy and definitions were
good, even if the implementation
is problematic.
Mitchell said the current draft
is generally "a good one to start
with," but added she hopes it will
be considered experimental and
will be changed according to its
successes and failures.
