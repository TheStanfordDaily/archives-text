## Hardworking frosh Berris is no tennis tenderfoot 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Nestled in among the Ail-Americans,
the established tennis greats and the tour
nament-title holders on the Stanford
women's tennis team is a player who, with
little fanfare or glamour, is quietly making
a name for herself as one of the hardest
working competitors in women's colle
giate tennis.
And she's only a freshman.
If you were to see her walking around
campus, Beth Berris might strike you as a
smiling, friendly, semi-serious woman
who uses the word "whoa" a few more
times than the average person. But on the
tennis court, Berris is all business. Just
ask her first 19 opponents this year, all of
whom went down in defeat.
"Beth is a very hard worker and a con
sistent player," said Stanford coach Frank
Brennan. "She's very similar to Heather
[Willensl when she was a freshman —
she's following the same path."
For Berris, a comparison to Willens —
Stanford's No. 2 singles player and the
nation's fourth-ranked player — is flat
tery indeed.
"They have amazing players come
through here every year, and just coming
to a place like Stanford with players like
Heather and Laxmi (Poruri) — I just
thought, "Whoa, this is the greatest thing
ever!' " she said.
At the age of eight, Berris accompanied
her mother to tennis lessons each week,
and after a while she asked if she could
pick up a racket and join her mom on the
court.
"I used to play all kinds of sports — I
took swimming lessons, too," Berris said.
"I don't know why I kept playing — when
I was 10 I think I lost every first round of
every tournament I played in. I must have
really liked it to keep going."
Eventually, however, Berris started
winning, and winning, and winning. She
competed in the junior nationals for the
first time when she was 11 and played in
them every year after that. At Lodi High
School, she was introduced to team tennis
and helped her squad capture three out of
four section titles during her high-school
career.

"Just to be with the team was great,"
Berris said. "We got behind each other and
rooted each other on, and that was so
much fun."
But even coming out of high school as
one of the country's top recruits, Berris
still wasn't sure she had what it took to
play for the Cardinal.
"When I was really, really little, I want
ed to come to Stanford, but I thought I had
no chance," she said. "I didn't realize I
could come here until I talked to Frank
and got a letter saying that he was inter
ested in having me come. I finally thought,
'Maybe he does want me, maybe I do want
to be here.'"
"She's a good example of someone who
couldn't believe she belonged here," Bren
nan said. "She's one of those people that
thinks, 'Oh my God, am I one of Dean
Jim's mistakes?' "
Berris, along with fellow classmates
Wendy Sacks and Sonya Cotero, made up
a solid freshman contingent to replace
departing seniors Kylie Johnson and Kelly
Fisher. Yet, Berris took some time adjust
ing to the rigors of Stanford life, both on
and off the court.
"Stanford was a very intimidating place
to me when I first came here," she said. "I
thought you had to have done something
special to get in, and everyone here seems
to be good at everything. But the team was
actually really good about making me feel
at home and comfortable."
"During all of fall quarter, I was adjust
ing," Berris continued. "I finally got it
together in January — I figured, 'I know
how to do the laundry, I have a social life,
I can do this school thing.' "
On the court, things seemed more
orderly for the freshman. "I liked the team
a lot and I knew I wouldn't play high,"
Berris said, "so I concentrated on working
hard on my game and winning my match-
W
es.
That work has paid off for Berris this
year, as she has steadily disposed of player
after player in dual matches this season.
Berris remained the only undefeated Car
dinal player in the starting singles lineup
until April 7, when she finally dropped a
close 7-6,6-7 (1-7), 6-2 decision to Califor
nia's Veena Prabhakar. As a result, fans of
Stanford tennis have come to expect

almost as much from Berris as she expects
of herself. Almost.
"I was crushed when I lost!" Berris
said. "She played very well, and I went in
there not playing well, but I just couldn't
believe I lost. I wanted to win all my
matches this year because I felt I should
expect that out of myself."
Brennan sees Berris as her own hard
est critic this season, even after her 22-2
individual dual-match record — the
team's top winning percentage — and an
incredible 19-match winning streak.
"She says, 'My opponent was terrible' or
'I should have hit this shot or that shot,' "
Brennan said. "She grades herself very
hard — I think when the season's over
she'll look at her record and think, 'Geez, I
was 22-2, that's good. Hey, that's really
good!'"
Berris admits, however, that her happi
est moments this year came against Flori
da's Erica Kuttler and Kristin Osmond in
two separate matches. Berris topped Kut
tler, 6-3, 6-3 to notch Stanford's only win
in its 5-1 dual match loss to No. 1 Florida
March 24. But even more satisfying was
her 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Osmond to
wrap up the Cardinal's upset win of the
top-ranked Lady Gators earlier in the year
at the National Indoors.
"Beating Erica was one of the best wins
because the crowd was bad and I just
played focused and shut them out," Berris
said. "Erica's good and experienced, and it
was great to beat her, but the happiness
only lasted until the handshake, because
the team was losing."
Berris and the Cardinal have only one
competition left to prepare for: the 1993
NCAA Championships. And this feisty
No. 5 slugger is looking forward to it.
"It's going to be fun," Berris said. "Now
we know the crowd down there is going to
be brutal, and that's just going to fire me
up more — I'll want to do it in spite of the
crowd."
However, she points out that the pres
sure probably won't get to her. "I don't
feel much pressure — just what I put on
myself. I need to practice hard and get my
mind where it should be so I'm fine-tuned
for Florida"
And how is she going to do that?
"Work hard," as usual.
