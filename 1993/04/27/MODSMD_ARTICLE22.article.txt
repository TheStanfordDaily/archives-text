# Dons may give Stanford batters much-needed victory, confidence
## Unranked USF holds 6-36 record, seven-game skid; ailing Cardinal needs shot in arm to earn playoff berth

Will the Dons prove to be the
answer to the Stanford baseball team's
midseason blues?
On March 2, the Cardinal ended a
four-game skid by defeating the Univer
sity of San Francisco, 11-4. Stanford
built off the successes of that game in
its next series, taking two of three from
use.
Stanford (21-20) has struggled of
late, losing seven of their past 10
games. On the other hand, San Fran
cisco has struggled all season. Since
opening the season with a 3-3 mark,
the Dons (6-36) have lost 33 of 36
games, including their last seven in a
row.
Despite San Francisco's poor record,
the Cardinal is unconcerned about a
letdown. "We've had so few wins lately,
we look at this game a lot differently
than we might have in other situa
tions," said designated hitter/pitcher
Nate Olmstead.
With Stanford facing the possibility
of missing the NCAA playoff cut for

the first time since 1989 and finishing
with a losing record for the first time
since 1964, every game becomes cru
cial.
After today's game, the Cardinal
travels to Tempe, Ariz., to square off
against front-running Arizona State
in a three-game series. Outfielder
Rod Meyer, who recorded his first
collegiate hit and home run earlier
this season against the Dons,
stressed the need for Stanford to go
into the weekend series on a winning
note.
"With a win, we can go into ASU
with confidence, which is important,"
Meyer said. "Obviously, every game is
important, but yeah, we really want
this one."
The Cardinal, last in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division with a
7-14 record, must win eight of its final
nine conference games to remain in
the postseason hunt.
"I definitely don't think we've given
up, but it's frustrating," Olmstead
said. ""We've just got to take every
game seriously and improve. It's a total
cliche, but it's true."
