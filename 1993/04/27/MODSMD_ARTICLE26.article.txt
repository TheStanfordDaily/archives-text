# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
For this week's top two athletes, once is
never enough.
Just last week, women's tennis player Amy
Chiminello's mug graced this same highly
coveted spot, as she earned Athlete-of-the-
Week honors for her role in Stanford's rout of
USC and UCLA. Cornerback Darrien Gordon
earned the much-sought-after award on the
heels of his Most Valuable Player performance
at the Blockbuster Bowl on New Year's Day.

And now they've both done it again.
Chiminello was on fire during the
Women's Pacific 10 Conference Individual
Championships in Ojai, Calif., last weekend.
She stayed alive until the semifinals, pulling
ofT one upset victory after another, disposing
of some of the nation's top-ranked players.
Her most dramatic win came in the quar
terfinals against UCLA's No. 1 singles player,
Keri Phebus. In the latest Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association rankings, Phebus holds the
No. 6 spot, but she was sent packing by the
unranked Chiminello, 6-4, 6-1.
In her first and second rounds of play, the
Stanford sophomore from Melrose, Mass.,
also disposed of Keirsten Alley and the
nation's 28th-ranked netter, Suzanne Ital
iano. The only person capable of snapping
Chiminello's string of wins was Arizona's Alix
Creek, the tournament's defending champion
and eventual repeat winner.

Gordon shed his cardinal-and-white jersey
and entered the professional world on Sun
day, as he became the San Diego Chargers'
first-round draft pick.
Gordon's senior season was highlighted by
four interceptions and 17 deflections, as well
as outstanding postseason play against Penn
State in the Blockbuster Bowl.
The 6-foot-1, 185-pound cornerback from
Shawnee, Okla., earned second-team All-Pac
-10 honors this year. He turned in one of his
most impressive outings of the season during

Big Game, snagging one interception and
holding All-American receiver Sean Dawkins
to just 31 receiving yards during the first half.
His career statistics include 99 unassisted
tackles, two fumble recoveries, eight inter
ceptions and 28 pass deflections. Gordon had
started the last 31 games at left corner for
the Cardinal, and will try to use his out
standing speed to land a starting spot for the
Chargers next year.
