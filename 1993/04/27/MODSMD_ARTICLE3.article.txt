# Other universities' policies have stronger confidentiality clauses
## 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
Stanford's current sexual-harass
ment policy draft would establish a
response network similar to those at
other universities, but appears to
take a less stringent approach to pro
tecting the confidentiality of individ
uals who use such response net
works.
Like other universities' policies,
Stanford's current draft attempts to
resolve the sometimes-conflicting in
terests of protecting complainant
confidentiality and the University's
legal obligation to fully investigate
claims of sexual harassment.
However, unlike Stanford's draft
statement that states a complainant

"must consent to being identified to
the subject of the complaint," some
universities make explicit state
ments about the confidentiality of
record-keeping at the initial re
sponse stages.
The University of Chicago's policy
— which University President Ger
hard Casper helped formulate when
he served as provost there — states
that "no record will be kept" of all
discussions between complainants
and the university's trained re
sponse advisers, except for "an inci
dent report that will not contain the
names of either the complainant or
the accused."
While the University of Pennsyl
vania's policy itself does not have
a statement of confidentiality,
issues of identification are
resolved through the University's
general confidentiality policy, said
Joanne Mitchell, director of the
university's affirmative action
office.
Mitchell said the university
has devised a system in which a
complainant can sign a "waiver of

investigation" in the initial pro
cess, therefore freeing the univer
sity from its legal obligation to
investigate certain complaints of
sexual harassment.
This system allows com
plainants to decide for themselves
whether to proceed with an inves
tigation and be identified after
speaking to a resource officer
about their options, Mitchell said.
The UC-Berkeley policy care
fully straddles the tension
between maintaining confiden
tiality and fulfilling legal obliga
tions, stating, "In the mediation

and complaint resolution process
es every reasonable effort is made
to protect the privacy of all parties
in accordance with existing Uni
versity policies and applicable
state law."
In addition, "no records kept
by resource people include the
names of individuals or other
information which would permit
identification." UCLA's confiden
tiality policies are nearly identical
to UC-Berkeley's.
While the privacy policies of
Stanford and other universities
differ, the current Stanford draft

establishes a mechanism for deal
ing with harassment charges —
including a response network of
advisers overseen by an
adviser/coordinator and a sexual
harassment panel — that bears
similarities to other universities'
systems.
The Chicago policy establishes
a "Complaint Advisor" system as
the recommended first-contact
point for an individual who
believes he or she may have been
harassed.
Much like the Stanford policy
draft, Chicago has a coordinating

officer for complaint advisers and
a sexual harassment panel.
Penn also has a response sys
tem, but its "Harassment Infor
mation Resources" members —
comprised of faculty, staff and
students — are deliberately not
called "advisers" because their
role is to provide information, not
to take any action or act as an ini
tial hearing process, Mitchell
said.
However, she said the system
is currently under review because
of problems, which include updat
ing the training of the resource

officers.
At Berkeley, the Title IX com
pliance officer and faculty assis
tant for the status of women serve
as "Complaint Resolution Offi
cers," who act as information
providers for complainants and
keep records of complaints,
according to the university's poli
cy-
Similar to Stanford's attempts
to establish informal and formal
complaint processes, UCLA's pol
icy outlines "pre-grievance" and
"formal grievance" procedures for
reporting sexual harassment.
