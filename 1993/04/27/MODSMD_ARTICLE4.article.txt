# 'He was the organizer of... a true social movement.'
## Casa Zapata service remembers Chavez 
### Sean Kennedy 
Gathering in front of a mural depicting the
late Cesar Chavez, more than 100 students
and community members bid a fond farewell
to the prominent Mexican-American leader
in a memorial service last night.
Chavez, best known for founding the Unit
ed Farm Workers Union, died in his sleep Fri
day at the age of 66.
Between lively musical performances in
Casa Zapata's dining hall, including farm
workers' songs sung by the San Jose-based
Flor del Pueblo, several speakers — many of
them friends of Chavez — took turns recall
ing memories of him and of the rise of the
union.
"Cesar was a great union organizer," said
Father Eugene Boyle, a former Stanford
chaplain. "But Cesar was far more than a
union organizer. He was the organizer of
what we have to say was a true social move
ment."
Boyle praised Chavez as a compassionate
and sensitive man who taught frugality,
"who was a tough organizer and a tough ne
gotiator."
"I would consider Cesar one of the great
est, if not the greatest union organizer of this
century. . . . We have to thank God he was in

He told how Chavez received the most
votes in a poll that attempted to determine a
list of great leaders for Stanford's
Chicano/Latino community.
In 1991, Chavez visited Casa Zapata and
signed his name on the mural bearing his
likeness, "The Last Supper of the Chicano
Heroes."
"This is not a time for mourning," said
Herman Gallegos, another good friend of
Chavez. Rather, he said, Chavez would have
seen his passing as a good opportunity to
unite for community renewal and organiza
tion.
Gallegos told an anecdote from many years
ago, in which he and Chavez were delivering
boxes of food to families during Christmas.
They ended up with an extra box but Chavez
refused to take it home with him even though
he was out of work and his family did not have
any of the luxuries of the holiday season.
Gallegos explained that this was because
as an organizer, Chavez refused to put him
self before others. "[People] understood he

meaning that the union organiza

Citing Chavez's determina
tion, Gallegos said, "That man
never worked less than you did.
He always worked harder."

Asking everyone in the audi
ence to stand, Gallegos ended his
speech by reciting "A Personal
Pledge to Non-Violence," a prin
ciple that Chavez adhered to in
his life. Chavez was well known
for using fasting as a protest
technique.
Gallegos concluded his speech
with a shout of "Viva Cesar!",
bringing a strong cheer from the
crowd.
