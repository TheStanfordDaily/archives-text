## Haas Center director steps down to accept job in Washington, D.C. 
### Johnathon Briggs 
Haas Center for Public Service
Director Catherine Milton has an
nounced her resignation to accept
the job of executive director of the
Commission on National and
Community Service in Washing
ton, D.C.
In a resignation letter dated
April 14, she said the decision to
leave was "difficult." Previously
on leave from the center, Milton
already has been working in
Washington for more than a
year.
"As you know, I have been torn
between my love and loyalty to
Stanford and the commitment to
follow through on the national
service agenda of the president,"
Milton's letter said.
Coming to Stanford in 1983 to
help then-President Donald
Kennedy promote the Universi
ty's commitment to public service,
Milton was a crucial player in the
creation of the center. Her ability
to infuse student input into her vi
sion of service is well remembered
by her colleagues.

"She is an ef
fective and lively
person," said
Kennedy, now a
professor of bio
logical sciences.
"I immediately
thought of her
when looking at
service here at
Stanford.

"Programs such as Stanford in
Washington .. . would not be here
if Catherine had not been able to
mobilize the students," he added.
"It's the students who did it, but
Catherine was the catalyst."
Kennedy said that Milton's
ability to work with students was
very effective in creating changes
in public service attitudes on cam
pus.
"There's been a change in the
culture here at Stanford. Public
service is now a central part of
conversation. ... It's become an
expectation of students here,"
Kennedy said.
