## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
The search committee for a
new director of the Black Com
munity Services Center will con
tinue its hunt, after the group's
second choice decided not to ac
cept the position, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson said yes
terday.
"The second person that we
were exploring ended up getting a
very significant counter-offer
from his current institution,"
said Jackson, who declined to
identify the candidate.
The committee's first choice,
Ohio educator Judith James, had
initially accepted the position but
backed out on April 6 citing per
sonal difficulties.
Jackson, who plans to meet
with the committee sometime
this week to discuss the search's
future, said the other three final
ists who have visited campus will

not be considered for the position.
At this point, the search can
follow three courses, explained
Jackson. "A few other applica
tions that came in late could be ex
amined, there is the possibility of
reopening the search and we'll
also discuss seeking applications
from a few targeted individuals
who we think are terrific."
Education Prof. John Baugh,
the committee's chair, said he was
disappointed the chosen candi
dates were not coming to Stanford.
"The search will have to con
tinue because the status quo obvi
ously cannot remain indefinite
ly," he said.
Jackson said the nature of the
search provided no definite time
frame for filling the position, but
he "hoped to do so as soon as pos
sible."
Asst. BCSC Director Barbara
Smith has served as the center's
acting director and as an associate
dean of students since last June.
