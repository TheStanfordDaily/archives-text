## Faludi to examine 'masculinity crisis' next 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Only months after the much-heralded "Year of
the Woman" drew to a close, Susan Faludi already
has set her sights on men.
"There's been an excessive amount of attention
paid to so-called female problems," said Faludi, au
thor of the best-selling book, "Backlash: the unde
clared war against American women." So in her
next book, she plans to "look at male anxiety, and
male fear and loathing, and male nervousness
about feminism."
"It kind of turns things upside down," she said.
But turning popular beliefs on their heads is
nothing new for Faludi, whose first book debunked
popular media myths about women and launched
its author to the forefront of what has been touted

as a new wave of feminism.
Faludi, who is taking classes and doing research
on campus this year as part of the Knight Fellow
ship Program for professional journalists, will
speak on " 'Backlash* in the year after the 'Year of
the Woman' " in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 7:30
tonight.
"One of the things I will be talking about is de
constructing [the 'Year of the Woman'], because I
think it's a very slippery and dangerous concept,"
said Faludi, whose fierce eloquence is almost lost
at times, when her gentle voice fades into a near
whisper.
"I do think it was the 'Year of the Woman' in
that women found their voices after a long period
of silence," Faludi continued. "But it was not a

year for women's progress or
women's advancements in any
statistical or social or economic
terms."
"The few gains we made were
just that — very few gains."
Yet even the smallest advances
are seen as threatening by detrac
tors of the feminist movement,
she said. "Our society isn't able to
disconnect women's progress
from men's decline. It's like the
sexes are on a see-saw — to use a
terrible playground metaphor —
anytime women rise, men think
they're sinking."
And this fear of falling, of
being displaced culturally, has led
to a phenomenon she calls the
"masculinity crisis."
"This generation has had the
idea of man as being the bread
winner — the sole breadwinner —
handed down to it as an ideal,"
she explained. "But this is eco
nomically impossible for all but
about 7 percent of households. So
I think a lot of men are casting
about trying to prove their mettle
in other ways: Huge doses of

steroids is one classic example."
Faludi, a Pulitzer Prize-win
ning Wall Street Journal reporter
in her pre-"Backlash" life, said
researching the masculinity crisis
has proved "a much more difficult
task" than documenting her first
book.
Ironically, her least-academic
class at Stanford, "Weight Train
ing for Women," proved fertile
ground for her interests: "I'm
always fascinated when I go into
Encina weight room," she said.
"The way a lot of young men
approach their exercise regimen is
a real demonstration of compul
sive masculinity ... a lot of moan
ing and groaning and lifting of
weights that far exceed the
amount they should be lifting."
Academia: 'a mixed bag'
Along with the backlash
against women's progress in
other areas, Faludi believes
there's been a severe overreaction
to the strides women and minori
ties have made in academia, a
point she illustrates with a hand
ful of ready anecdotes.
"What's ironic is that Stanford
is perceived by the media as one
these universities in which femi
nists are in command — which is

hilarious when you're here,
because not only are they not in
command, you don't even know
where they are.
"Here we have this small,
somewhat unobtrusive field of
feminist studies, yet it's per
ceived, particularly by white-male
professors I've talked to here, as
the prevailing form of scholar
ship," Faludi said. "More than
one of them has complained to me
that they can't get jobs because
they're not women and they're
not minorities. And I'm sitting
there listening to them — and it's
a whole room of white men. And
I'm thinking, 'you all look
employed to me.' "
While Faludi wholeheartedly
supports the developing field of
feminist studies, and chastises
universities for not granting
these programs full departmental
status, her appraisal of the disci
pline was less than sterling.
She criticized the methodology
of many feminist studies classes,
saying they rely on the use of con
voluted, elitist language only
accessible to those versed in the
rhetoric of the field.
Feminist studies is "practical
and relevant to the degree that it
prompts women to have a femi

nist consciousness and to think
about the erasure of women from
the historical record," Faludi said.
"But as for the actual scholarship
itself, I think it's a mixed bag.
"This is not a popular view, I
suppose, on this campus," she
continued. "But I find extremely
frustrating the level of 'decon
structionist' — or whatever the
term is these days — 'discourse,'
as they insist on calling it.
"When you're sitting in a class
in which you can barely under
stand what people are saying, and
every other word is 'privileged
space' and 'intentionality' ... I
really worry that in the long run
it will turn off more women than
it will attract to the field.
"I don't claim to be an expert
in deconstruction — but it does
seem to me that by embracing a
form of scholarly analysis that
relies on a rather impenetrable
and elitist-coded language, I femi
nist studiesl comes dangerously
close to replicating the elitist,
patriarchal system that shut
women out of academia in the
first place."
By using this kind of exclusive
language, scholars also feed into
the idea that feminism is elitist,
Faludi said. "Lord knows, [detrac

torsl are always looking for a way
to present feminism as the indul
gence of an overeducated upper
class set. And we're sort of giving
them an opening."
Shying from feminism
Criticisms about feminism
have existed as long as the
women's movement itself, and
many have proved particularly
effective in discouraging women
— particularly young women —
from embracing feminism, Faludi
said, explaining why she believes
so many college students shy
away from the term "feminist."
"Younger women are especially
vulnerable to all of the canards
and backlashes loaded onto the
word feminism," she said. "To
hear that if you identify yourself
as a feminist, you won't be able to
find a man, get married or have
children, that you'll be unattrac
tive, that you'll be seen as some
one who hates men, that you'll be
viewed as unpopular — those
kinds of threats are much more
effective when thrust before a 20-
year-old than before a 30, 40 or
50-year-old.
"When someone says you're
not going to get married, it
doesn't keep me up at night, but it

might have when I was 19," said
the 34-year-old Faludi.
But even at 19 and younger,
Faludi was a staunch feminist,
forever fascinated by women's
issues and concerns: "I've always
been really preoccupied with it:
unhealthfully so, some think,"
she said.
"Being at Harvard certainly
accentuated my awareness of
inequity: gender and class and
race, but gender in particular,"
said Faludi, who served as manag
ing editor of the Harvard Crimson
before graduating in 1981.
"There's something about the
bratty Harvard boys that makes it
even more obvious," she contin
ued. "They all think they have an
enormous amount of entitlement,
and the women all think they have
an enormous lack of entitlement.
"Plus, Harvard itself is such a
male place. You see all the lines of
paintings of the founding fathers
on wood-paneled walls, and you just
don't feel like it's a place that wants
you as a woman to succeed — or
even to exist within its four walls.
"But it's not as if Stanford is
all that much of a departure from
that. It seems to me that most of
the pictures on the walls here are
still men."

seem to me that by embracing a
form of scholarly analysis that
relies on a rather impenetrable
and elitist-coded language, I femi
nist studiesl comes dangerously
close to replicating the elitist,
patriarchal system that shut
women out of academia in the
first place."
By using this kind of exclusive
language, scholars also feed into
the idea that feminism is elitist,
Faludi said. "Lord knows, [detrac

torsl are always looking for a way
to present feminism as the indul
gence of an overeducated upper
class set. And we're sort of giving
them an opening."
Shying from feminism
Criticisms about feminism
have existed as long as the
women's movement itself, and
many have proved particularly
effective in discouraging women
— particularly young women —
from embracing feminism, Faludi
said, explaining why she believes
so many college students shy
away from the term "feminist."
"Younger women are especially
vulnerable to all of the canards
and backlashes loaded onto the
word feminism," she said. "To
hear that if you identify yourself
as a feminist, you won't be able to
find a man, get married or have
children, that you'll be unattrac
tive, that you'll be seen as some
one who hates men, that you'll be
viewed as unpopular — those
kinds of threats are much more
effective when thrust before a 20-
year-old than before a 30, 40 or
50-year-old.
"When someone says you're
not going to get married, it
doesn't keep me up at night, but it

might have when I was 19," said
the 34-year-old Faludi.
But even at 19 and younger,
Faludi was a staunch feminist,
forever fascinated by women's
issues and concerns: "I've always
been really preoccupied with it:
unhealthfully so, some think,"
she said.
"Being at Harvard certainly
accentuated my awareness of
inequity: gender and class and
race, but gender in particular,"
said Faludi, who served as manag
ing editor of the Harvard Crimson
before graduating in 1981.
"There's something about the
bratty Harvard boys that makes it
even more obvious," she contin
ued. "They all think they have an
enormous amount of entitlement,
and the women all think they have
an enormous lack of entitlement.
"Plus, Harvard itself is such a
male place. You see all the lines of
paintings of the founding fathers
on wood-paneled walls, and you just
don't feel like it's a place that wants
you as a woman to succeed — or
even to exist within its four walls.
"But it's not as if Stanford is
all that much of a departure from
that. It seems to me that most of
the pictures on the walls here are
still men."
Only months after the much-heralded "Year of
the Woman" drew to a close, Susan Faludi already
has set her sights on men.
"There's been an excessive amount of attention
paid to so-called female problems," said Faludi, au
thor of the best-selling book, "Backlash: the unde
clared war against American women." So in her
next book, she plans to "look at male anxiety, and
male fear and loathing, and male nervousness
about feminism."
"It kind of turns things upside down," she said.
But turning popular beliefs on their heads is
nothing new for Faludi, whose first book debunked
popular media myths about women and launched
its author to the forefront of what has been touted

as a new wave of feminism.
Faludi, who is taking classes and doing research
on campus this year as part of the Knight Fellow
ship Program for professional journalists, will
speak on " 'Backlash* in the year after the 'Year of
the Woman' " in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 7:30
tonight.
"One of the things I will be talking about is de
constructing [the 'Year of the Woman'], because I
think it's a very slippery and dangerous concept,"
said Faludi, whose fierce eloquence is almost lost
at times, when her gentle voice fades into a near
whisper.
"I do think it was the 'Year of the Woman' in
that women found their voices after a long period
of silence," Faludi continued. "But it was not a

year for women's progress or
women's advancements in any
statistical or social or economic
terms."
"The few gains we made were
just that — very few gains."
Yet even the smallest advances
are seen as threatening by detrac
tors of the feminist movement,
she said. "Our society isn't able to
disconnect women's progress
from men's decline. It's like the
sexes are on a see-saw — to use a
terrible playground metaphor —
anytime women rise, men think
they're sinking."
And this fear of falling, of
being displaced culturally, has led
to a phenomenon she calls the
"masculinity crisis."
"This generation has had the
idea of man as being the bread
winner — the sole breadwinner —
handed down to it as an ideal,"
she explained. "But this is eco
nomically impossible for all but
about 7 percent of households. So
I think a lot of men are casting
about trying to prove their mettle
in other ways: Huge doses of

steroids is one classic example."
Faludi, a Pulitzer Prize-win
ning Wall Street Journal reporter
in her pre-"Backlash" life, said
researching the masculinity crisis
has proved "a much more difficult
task" than documenting her first
book.
Ironically, her least-academic
class at Stanford, "Weight Train
ing for Women," proved fertile
ground for her interests: "I'm
always fascinated when I go into
Encina weight room," she said.
"The way a lot of young men
approach their exercise regimen is
a real demonstration of compul
sive masculinity ... a lot of moan
ing and groaning and lifting of
weights that far exceed the
amount they should be lifting."
Academia: 'a mixed bag'
Along with the backlash
against women's progress in
other areas, Faludi believes
there's been a severe overreaction
to the strides women and minori
ties have made in academia, a
point she illustrates with a hand
ful of ready anecdotes.
"What's ironic is that Stanford
is perceived by the media as one
these universities in which femi
nists are in command — which is

hilarious when you're here,
because not only are they not in
command, you don't even know
where they are.
"Here we have this small,
somewhat unobtrusive field of
feminist studies, yet it's per
ceived, particularly by white-male
professors I've talked to here, as
the prevailing form of scholar
ship," Faludi said. "More than
one of them has complained to me
that they can't get jobs because
they're not women and they're
not minorities. And I'm sitting
there listening to them — and it's
a whole room of white men. And
I'm thinking, 'you all look
employed to me.' "
While Faludi wholeheartedly
supports the developing field of
feminist studies, and chastises
universities for not granting
these programs full departmental
status, her appraisal of the disci
pline was less than sterling.
She criticized the methodology
of many feminist studies classes,
saying they rely on the use of con
voluted, elitist language only
accessible to those versed in the
rhetoric of the field.
Feminist studies is "practical
and relevant to the degree that it
prompts women to have a femi

nist consciousness and to think
about the erasure of women from
the historical record," Faludi said.
"But as for the actual scholarship
itself, I think it's a mixed bag.
"This is not a popular view, I
suppose, on this campus," she
continued. "But I find extremely
frustrating the level of 'decon
structionist' — or whatever the
term is these days — 'discourse,'
as they insist on calling it.
"When you're sitting in a class
in which you can barely under
stand what people are saying, and
every other word is 'privileged
space' and 'intentionality' ... I
really worry that in the long run
it will turn off more women than
it will attract to the field.
"I don't claim to be an expert
in deconstruction — but it does
seem to me that by embracing a
