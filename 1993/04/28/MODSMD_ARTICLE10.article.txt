# Finding hidden anthropological artifacts
## Patterned pottery, intricate baskets fill small departmental museum 
### Amy Hsieh 
Around 100 years ago, a
group of Native Americans from
the Pomo tribe in Northern Cal
ifornia lovingly crafted a series
of baskets, noted for their intri
cate weaving patterns.

Now these baskets are tucked
away in the The Felix M.
Keesing Museum — a series of
exhibits that anthropology pro
fessors and interested students
can use in their studies.
The museum appears a little
like an unused classroom, dark

and empty; only letters spelling
out the museum's name on the
side of the door give visitors any
indication they have found the
home of cultural treasures.
Assoc. Anthropology Prof.
John Rick, the collection's cura
tor, said he is one of few people
who regularly visits and utilizes
the display.
Although he has seen the
Pomo baskets often, Rick said
the artifacts remain special to
him. "The basketry is definitely
a very special craft form — it
could be seen almost as techno
logical," Rick said. "It represents
a mixture of precision and
patience — which must have
been abundant to accomplish
[the baskets].
"It also represents a lot of
time, idle time to be able to make
objects of such exquisite quality
— there's reassurance knowing
that people had time to do that,"
he added.
In addition to the Pomo bas
kets, the museum houses centu
ry-old Pueblo pottery decorated
with animals including parrots
and deer.
Rick explained that the pot
tery is of "very high workman
ship" and is especially dear to
him because of his own field
work in Arizona.
"The pottery is the Pueblo
response to the world around
them," he said. "It was their way
of remaining faithful to their
own art while dealing with their
problems of land shortage by
making pots to sell for money."
Although the anthropological
exhibits are considered quite
valuable, they are rarely noticed.
Even Rick, the museum curator,
said upkeep is considered a low
priority and the exhibits are
rarely visited — except by
anthropology students working
on class assignments.
However, Thomas Seligman,
curator of the Stanford Museum
of Art, said the museum is a
valuable resource because there
is not enough room to exhibit the
anthropology collection in the
art museum.
And last year the value hid
den in the museum was noticed

by a robber who purloined 18
baskets, estimated at a total
value of $50,000, from an exhib
it on the Karuk tribe of North
ern California.
The exhibit of Karuk baskets
had been noted for its diversity.
Some of the collection consisted
of flat, circular trays used in
everyday chores, while others
were "basketry hats" commonly
worn by the tribal women. They
were exhibited with photographs

'The basketry is
definitely avery
special craft form
— it could be seen
almost as techno
logical.'

of tribe members using them in
their daily chores.
The museum's first exhibits
were selected and organized in
the late 1960s as a project for a
class led by Anthropology Prof.
Emeritus Bert Gerow.
After retiring in 1978, he con
tinued on as the collection's
curator and in 1985, the exhibit
became an actual museum,
named after the former chair
man of the Anthropology
Department.
Because the art museum has
been closed since the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake, the contents
of the tiny anthropological dis
play have not changed. Instead
of choosing new exhibits, stu
dents have helped inventory and
pack sections of the art muse
um's collection.
In addition to the exhibits,
Rick said that some local
schools have visited the muse
um, classes occasionally meet
there and many department
functions are also often held in
the room. Rick laughed as he
pointed out that the museum
serves as the "Anthropology
multi-purpose room with 3-D
decorations."

only one of the anthropological treasures contained in the The
Felix M. Keesing Museum.
