State officials indicted
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Sen. Frank
Hill, R-Whittier, Assemblyman Pat
Nolan, R-Glendale, and lobbyist Terry
Frost were indicted by a federal grand
jury yesterday for allegedly shaking
down special interests for cash.
The eight-count indictment stems
from an undercover FBI sting at the
state Capitol and marks the first time
Republican lawmakers have been
charged in the probe.
The ongoing investigation has already
resulted in charges against three other
elected state officials, several former legisla
tive aides, a former state coastal commis
sioner and a powerful Sacramento lobbyist.
"I would hope people have gotten the
message that they cannot connect legisla
tive action with campaign contributions,

honorarium or any other payment," said
U.S. Attorney George O'Connell.
China, Taiwan talk
SINGAPORE (AP) - China and Tai
wan took a historic step toward resolving
more than 40 years of hostility yester
day, when delegates began facing each
other across a conference table for two
days of talks on neutral territory.
For the most part, the two said they
avoided discussing their political differ
ences at the carefully choreographed
meeting.
However, senior officials of the two long
time enemies smiled across a table in the
first formal meeting since the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949, when the Nation
alist government fled to Taiwan from the
mainland.
