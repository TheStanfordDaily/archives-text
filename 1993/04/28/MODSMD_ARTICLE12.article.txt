# Pentagon to lift women combat ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Female pilots
could be flying Navy and Air Force war
planes within months and Army combat
helicopters within a year under a new
directive set to be signed Thursday by
Defense Secretary Les Aspin, Pentagon
officials say.
The directive also will tell the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to pro
vide justification if they want to put any
battlefield role, including ground combat
units, off limits to women.
"It's big, it's a very big move for Aspin
to be making," said one senior official,
who like the others spoke last night only
on condition of anonymity.
The action means Air Force and Navy
women could be in fighter cockpits with
in months, but female pilots in the Army
will have to undergo special training
before flying front-line Apache attack
helicopters, officials said.
Because the Marines have no women

in training in any aviation unit, changes
will take longer in that service.
The law banning women from war
ships prevents them from serving on an
array of vessels ranging from small
frigates to aircraft carriers.
The New York Times published the
first account of Aspin's plan in its edi
tions today and the report subsequently
was confirmed by officials.
Aspin's directive is clearly designed to
upgrade the status of women in the mili
tary. It comes at a time when the Navy
has suffered a black eye resulting from a
1991 convention of the Tailhook Associa
tion, a private group of pilots and other
supporters of carrier-based aviation.
Even before Aspin's plan became
known, Adm. Frank Kelso Jr., chief of
naval operations, had been preparing to
create more postings for women on com
bat support ships. And Aspin himself had
taken note of the Navy's move, express-

Lng concern to reporters that the services
should be synchronized in making
greater combat roles available to women.
Women in the services have long cam
paigned for more direct combat roles, but
in recent weeks their efforts have been
somewhat eclipsed by President Clin
ton's efforts to drop barriers to homosex
uals in the military.
The Defense Department sources said
Aspin will direct the services to make "fis
cally feasible" changes and has made it
clear he wants to avoid expensive renova
tions to warships to accommodate a small
number of women.
"It has to be reasonable," the official
said. "It doesn't make sense to put women
on small ships, such as mine sweepers."
But women flying the Navy's top-of
the-line combat aircraft could be aboard
carriers within the year, the official said.
"We have women who are ready to
go," the official said.
