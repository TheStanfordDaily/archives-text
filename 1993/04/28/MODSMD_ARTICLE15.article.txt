New sexual harassment
policy should be revised
with input, anonymity

WHETHER it's pronounced
sexual or
ha*RASS*ment, the man
ipulation of men and women for
sexual reasons or purposes is an
ugly thing. It is also a problem
which universities and corpora
tions nationwide have recently
attempted to solve through new
policies and awareness.
The Stanford administration is
now prepared to put forth a pro
gram which attempts to amelio
rate the sexual-harassment situa
tion on campus. However, critics
have charged that the proposal
omits several important safe
guards designed to ensure the
anonymity of persons who make
harassment charges.
The administration has made
the counter-charge that the Uni
versity has gone too long without a
revised policy, and that any addi
tional changes can be made in the
future, after the passage of the
plan. In all, both the plan and its
critics have meritable arguments;
a compromise between them must
be sought.
The promise of confidentiality is
vital to the elimination of sexual
harassment on campus. Realisti
cally, few victims will likely come
forward if they fear reciprocation
by their superiors. It is curious
that the administration, which has
taken an admirably progressive
tack in other fields, has chosen to
revert to an antiquated policy of
full exposure that has been reject
ed by most of the nation in recent
years.
Further, critics of the plan solid
ly argue that the proposal provides
a twisted and confusing path of
redress for victims of sexual
harassment. And indeed, the
plan's procedure for reporting
harassment is akin to a catacombs,

and should be streamlined. For
example, the first step in the pro
cess is for the victim to approach
the alleged perpetrator, thereby
eliminating almost any chance the
victim has of receiving a fair hear
ing.
However, much of this opaque
ness could be handled through
informative programs and proce
dures following the passage of the
plan, and should not be a grounds
to eliminate the proposal alto
gether.
Instead, student involvement
should be sought in completing the
plan, thereby ensuring that vic
tims (undoubtedly a majority of
which will be students and gradu
ate students) are able to under
stand the various options they pos
sess in fighting harassment.
The administration also has a
reasonable grounds for desiring
passage of the sexual-harassment
proposal. The current draft has
been in the development process
for two years, and the administra
tion is undoubtedly eager to
demonstrate that they are opposed
to harassment through the pro
duction of a plan — any plan.
There are few doubts that Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and others in the policy work
group are sincere in stating that
they will attempt to revise the pol
icy to address student concerns
once it is adopted. However, the
changes and shifting priorities of
all universities prompt schools to
ensure that when they have an
opportunity to effect real change,
they should formulate the best of
all possible alternatives.
President Casper is aiming for
the end of the academic year for
the installment of the sexual
harassment policy revision, a goal
which can certainly still be met
even if student groups' input and a
confidentiality clause are both
included in the making of the pro
posal.
Overall, the plan is generally
even-handed and clearly repre
sents a step forward from the cur
rent policy. But when it's so close,
why not make it perfect?
