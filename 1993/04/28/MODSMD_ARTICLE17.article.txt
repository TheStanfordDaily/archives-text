## Intolerance of intolerance 
### 
I'M A RACIST. Look at the facts: I'm
from a middle-class family, went to a
high school with a very small Asian
and African-American population, I once
hired an illegal alien to do work, I have
owned two American-made cars and
don't think Malcolm X would have been
such a terrific guy to be around. I must
be a racist.
When I arrived at Stanford, I was
immediately made to think exactly that.
Because I was an average white male, I
was indirectly called ignorant. Intoler
ant. Privileged. Sheltered. Closed-mind
ed. I checked my closet to see if there
were any white sheets with holes cut in
the middle that I might don in some
altered state of consciousness.
I'm a sexist. Of course I'm a sexist. I
must be. After all, I'm male. On occa
sion, the word "girl" will slip from my
mouth. I've often been seen hanging out
with only guys, and on occasion, I'll do
stuff with them that I wouldn't do with
a female. Like talk about chicks. In real
ly demeaning ways. Well, it must be
demeaning because I'm sexist, right?
Despite the, ahem, extremely intellec
tual atmosphere here at Stanford, I have
found that people here are very quick to
judge, and very willing to label. People
observe one small facet of someone, and
think they have them all figured out.
I'm homophobic. Gotta be. I don't
have one of those little pink triangles on

my backpack, and I'm not very familiar
with "Queerland." I've never been to the
Firehouse. I like to go out on dates with
women. Homophobic.
Intolerance of intolerance. When cer
tain people see something that might
belie some kind of prejudice, they react.
All reasonable or objective thinking
stops as they start affixing a nice, easy
label to the person
I'm a Bible-thumping evangelist
because I've been seen wearing a cross.
I'm a liberal Res Ed-multicultural-loving
kinda guy because I'm an RA. I'm a
prude because I don't swear. I'm no fun
because I don't drink. I'm a techie nerd
because I like computers. I'm a fuzzy
weirdo because I like writing. And I'm a
racist, sexist and homophobe.
Why do we do it? We all know that
labels are usually deceiving. Nutritional
information on a package of M & M's
doesn't mean they're nutritious. Bran
ner doesn't suck just because it's a big
all-frosh house. We can't cheat ourselves
and others so easily. We hesitate to go
deeper and look beneath the often-mis
leading outside packaging. It's never as
simple as that.
Life is good. Watching my little broth
er play baseball. Going out to dinner on
weekends. Hearing an old, favorite song
on the radio. The message light blinking
on your answering machine.
Life isn't so good. Homelessness. The

family that can't afford to buy food, so
they dig through a restaurant's dump
ster. Unemployment. The AIDS patient
dying alone as an outcast. Drug abuse. A
drive-by shooting that accidentally killed
a 7-year-old. Abortion. Sexism. Racism.
An all-encompassing label is impossi
ble to affix anywhere. Nothing is black
and white. And we all know that. We
buy Consumer Reports and watch
"Fight Back! with David Horowitz"
because we don't want to be fooled by
imprecise appearances. And we get upset
when we are labelled according to our
race, our sex or our interests. Yet we
turn around and do the same thing to
other people.
I think it's intellectual laziness. It's
easiest to categorize people quickly and
be done with it. It's difficult and some
times painful to go deeper. But we have
to â€” we sell ourselves short otherwise. I
really don't think I'm a racist. Even if I
can't play basketball.
It's not that easy.

Mike Lang ford, often labelled a fashion
czar, merely used "Fight Back! with
David Horowitz " as a rhetoric example,
and never, ever watches the program.
Really.
