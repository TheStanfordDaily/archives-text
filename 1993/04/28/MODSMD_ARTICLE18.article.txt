Graduate student' Tea Party 9 to create belt-tightening

ACCORDING TO The Daily's April
15 fee endorsements, roughly $1.5
million in special-fee requests
were included on the recent ASSU bal
lot. Of that, the vast majority were tar
geted for decidedly undergraduate pur
suits, despite the fact that graduate stu
dents comprise half of the student popu
lation. We concede that certain organiza
tions (e.g. SURE) benefit everyone, but
most no longer appeal to us as a group,
as we explain below. It is indisputable
that we fund an undue amount of essen
tially undergraduate activity.
The Daily's April 19 editorial, "A grad
student COP," seems to suggest that
graduate students should simply act like
undergraduates with advanced classes.
Of course, we flatly reject this notion. To
assume that we should have the same
interests as undergraduates, and to label
us "apathetic" when we do not, is asi
nine. The call for "a thorough re-exami
nation of graduate students' attitudes
and University involvement" applies to
the editorial staff of The Daily, and per
haps to the undergraduate population at
large — but not to us.
Most of us completed our undergrad
uate degrees at other universities. Stan
ford is not our alma mater — we cheer
for Stanford teams until they play our
teams — and a much smaller proportion

of our activities revolves around Stan
ford organizations. For most of us,
r6sum6 padding, extracurricular over
achievement, student politics and so
forth are a thing of the past. We are too
busy doing research, teaching under
graduates, nurturing careers, even rais
ing families. Surely such an otherwise
"enlightened" student body should be
able to recognize these basic differences
between the two groups.
It may sound as if we just want to
complete our degrees and get the hell
out of here, but we still want to have
some fun! We like to drink a few beers
and (yes) EANABS; we like to listen to
the local bands; we like to sample the
night life in the city; we like to cut loose
any way we can. Is it too much to ask
that the GSA organize and pay for a
small portion of it? No way, we say!
The GSA and the School of Medicine's
SWEAT, the only two organizations that
specifically addressed graduate-student
interests, comprised a mere 2 percent of
the total fee requests. The denial of this
pittance demonstrates either the under
graduates' unwillingness to respect grad
uate concerns or their willingness to
mindlessly regurgitate The Daily's ill
founded recommendations.
We have always had more important
disputes with Stanford's general dis-

missal of graduate-student complaints,
such as the dearth of on-campus hous
ing. So in the past it was easier to for
give this obvious imbalance in ASSU
funding, especially with a couple of
(apparently) free beers in our bellies.
But now you have denied us that one
simple pleasure. You have convinced us
to take drastic action, and that is no
small feat.
Which brings us to our saving grace:
the passage of an amendment to the
ASSU Constitution opening the fee
refund process to all students. For in the
fall, we will sponsor a Graduate Student
"Tea Party" — with apologies to its his
toric namesake. At this landmark event,
we will use the fee-refund process to
drain the coffers of the ASSU and its
undergraduate-dominated organizations,
and correct this uneven "taxation." In the
spirit of The Daily, we will provide
"endorsements" to guide the participants;
but we will, of course, leave to each indi
vidual the final decision of which specific
refunds to collect. After all, we simply
wish to encourage, organize and empower
the largest possible number of graduate
students, not to dictate their actions—
nor to hurt organizations with recognized
graduate participation.
Rest assured: when the ASSU reaches
for its wallet following this raid, it will

feel a lot, lot lighter. The sound of the
tightening belts of student organizations
will be deafening.
Could we have avoided all this by
improving graduate voter turnout, or by
rebutting The Daily's misguided recom
mendation to decline GSA funding? Per
haps, but that is irrelevant. We refuse to
be judged by undergraduate standards of
"responsibility."
We do, however, welcome proposals
from all sides for constructive change in
the future. For example, perhaps we can
provide a separate graduate organization
with power to control graduate students'
fee allocations. This is a logical solution
that other universities have already
embraced. Any organization that
deserves funding from graduate stu
dents (and indeed, some do already
exist), could certainly petition this new
group with documentation that it wel
comes, encourages and receives graduate
participation.
After all, we can be reasonable when
treated with respect.
Thank you for listening.
