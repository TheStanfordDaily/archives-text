# Faculty and students must help create new proposal for program
## 
### 
We call upon the Stanford community
to act on the popular mandate set by the
Independent Survey on Asian American
Studies. The faculty and Asian-Ameri
can campus community need to take
decisive steps toward implementing a
degree program in Asian-American

Studies. We call for faculty to openly
endorse such a program by writing let
ters to department heads and the Dean
and Assistant Dean of Humanities and
Sciences. We also ask that faculty write
letters to The Daily to contribute to fac
ulty-student action on the issue. In addi
tion, we would like students to initiate
discussion with their Asian and non-
Asian peers so that a broad coalition can
work together to establish a formal
Asian-American Studies program.
After students and faculty each deter
mine what elements to incorporate into

an Asian-American Studies program,
they can come together to integrate
their ideas into a concrete proposal.
If you are interested in working on
this issue, one of the many organizations
you can contact is A/PECS, Asian/Pacific
Islanders for Education and Change at
Stanford, at the Asian-American Activi
ties Center in Old Union.
