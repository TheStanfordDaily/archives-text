Union leaders at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center have filed a petition to end alleged
discrimination against one of their representa

The petition claims that requiring United
Stanford Workers' field representative Reuben
Serna to obtain radiation-measuring badges
daily or monthly — rather than annually — is
discriminatory and could waste anywhere from
$600-$ 12,000 of taxpayers' money each year.
Officials at SLAC, however, say they are not

that the issue of badges is being blown out of

nature of their work at SLAC.

taking a general employee training course.
Although Serna has taken the course and
said he is qualified to receive an annual badge
under SLAC's policy, he said he must still apply
for a new badge every month. Processing fees
for new badges cost taxpayers about $50 each.
Serna, who has acted as the union represen

daily for the first four of those years. He said he
thinks the switch to a monthly badge was arbi-
