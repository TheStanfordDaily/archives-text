# Union leaders file petition concerning alleged discriminatory conduct at SLAC
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Union leaders at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center have filed a petition to end alleged
discrimination against one of their representa
tives, and are considering taking their com
plaints to the national level.
The petition claims that requiring United
Stanford Workers' field representative Reuben
Serna to obtain radiation-measuring badges
daily or monthly — rather than annually — is
discriminatory and could waste anywhere from
$600-$ 12,000 of taxpayers' money each year.
Officials at SLAC, however, say they are not
discriminating against the union, and believe

that the issue of badges is being blown out of
proportion.
But if the union receives no response to the
petition, Serna said it will take its complaint to
the National Labor Relations Board and the De
partment of Energy, which funds SLAC.
All employees and visitors at SLAC must ob
tain a dosimeter badge to measure the amount
of radioactivity to which they have been ex
posed. Workers must reapply for a badge on a
daily, monthly or yearly basis, depending on the
nature of their work at SLAC.
Serna — who is not a SLAC employee but vis
its the facility every day — said he falls into the
category of "non-radiation workers," which in
cludes "all regular SLAC employees, and visi

tors expecting to work at SLAC longer than a
month who enter a Controlled Area," according
to SLAC's Radiation Safety Digest. These em
ployees are usually issued annual badges after
taking a general employee training course.
Although Serna has taken the course and
said he is qualified to receive an annual badge
under SLAC's policy, he said he must still apply
for a new badge every month. Processing fees
for new badges cost taxpayers about $50 each.
Serna, who has acted as the union represen
tative for five years, had to apply for a new badge
daily for the first four of those years. He said he
thinks the switch to a monthly badge was arbi-
trary. Susan Strubbe, a second
union representative who was
recently assigned to SLAC, must
also go through the process of get
ting a monthly badge.
The petition claims that
Serna's use of monthly badges
costs unnecessarily $600. Obtain
ing a daily badge could waste
$12,000, the document says.
Lon Warneke, a union steward
and an executive board member of
the Local 680, said that making
Serna repeat this process monthly
"is really discrimination against
the union."
"Even though there are budget
cuts, they make us go through this
process eveiy month," he said.
However, SLAC personnel
director Lee Lyon said he is not
trying to restrict Serna's or any
other USW representative's
access to the radiation area.
According to SLAC Director
Burton Richter, whether or not to
issue the annual badges is at the
discretion of SLAC officials. He
said the center would proceed "in
accordance with requirements
with the union contracts and in
accordance with Department of
Energy regulations."
Serna said one reason he has
been told he does not qualify for an
annual badge is that he does not
receive paychecks from Stanford.
However, he said some contract

workers who do not get checks
from the University have perma
nent badges, so this reason is not
valid. Serna claims the conflict
stems from a "personal vendetta"
Lyon has against the union.
"It's plain, unadulterated
harassment," Serna said. "Lyon
chooses to discriminate simply
because of my political affiliation.
I want to be treated equally."
Lyon said he has no personal
vendetta against the union, and
does not know why people think
he does.
He said he believes Serna is
using this issue to cover up his
own unruly behavior. "When
Reuben can't get things done
through normal channels, he goes
to the press," he said.
Richter said the union was wel
come to take any complaints to the
NLRB or DOE, but said he did not
know if they had sufficient
grounds to do so. Richter said the
badge controversy "may be some
thing of a tempest in a teapot."
Union officials are treating the
badge question as a very serious
issue. Warneke said he thinks "it's
really a petty way to abuse taxpay
ers' money, and we want taxpay
ers to know how their money is
being wasted."
Relations between SLAC and the
USW have proven rocky in recent
years. In 1991, when SLAC officials
laid off 66 union workers in
response to federal budget cuts,

ter was "engaging in union-bust
