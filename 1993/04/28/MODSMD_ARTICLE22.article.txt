## If I only had the nerve, a call for some courage 
### 
Sometimes i can be such a cow
ard. Despite my macho exterior —
that ability to crush beer cans on my
forehead, my shocking bench pressing
ability and the way I can get my eyebrows
to feather just so — I am a coward.
Don't blow my cover.
Yes, I can go on infinitely awkward
blind dates to the Coffee House. Yes, I can
introduce myself at loud parties and not
flinch as my new-found friend shouts
back an obscene butchering of my name.
OK, so maybe I can tan in my bikini out
on Wilbur Field while extremely attractive
large men are playing topless basketball.
Twist my arm.
But I want true courage. Like the lion
in the Wizard of Oz, without the butt
kissing permed hairdo.
No fear.
I used to be invincible. I used to cross
the street without looking left-right-left
again. I used to ride a bike with no hands.
I used to participate in my Spanish class
es.
The wonder years.
But now, I couldn't ask a question in a
large lecture class to save my sister's vir
ginity. I avoid discussions about ethnic
theme houses like three-unit classes with
mountainous course readers.
I don't deserve to grace this campus.
But I hope to reverse this repulsive
trend, this lack of balls, as it were. I

dream of the day when I can have sex in
the library, get a tattoo on my bikini line
and wear only suspenders and a sarong to
Exotic Erotic.
All in the same day, of course.
I didn't used to be this way. It's just a
phase. A nasty little temporary flaw. But
it's been around since last summer, and
the time has come to move on.
Check please.
So, I am getting to the root of my
problem. I am facing the music, paying
the piper, laying in the oh-so-comfy egg
cartoned bed I have made.
I'm going to Nicaragua.
Nicaragua, I said. Feel free to tag
along.
I know, I know, Nicaragua isn't
included on those 14-day, tighten-your
buns-in-between-ports-of-call cruises. No
spring-break deluxe packages to scenic
Managua. No five days and five nights
hotel stays. There's a reason for that.
Nicaragua is my own personal hell.
I left with a few ounces of self-respect,
but I came back with a new perspective
on my previous bravery.
I know people who love Nicaragua.
Half of them now live in my hometown in
L.A. But last summer the country and I
had a battle of wills, and I went down for
the count.
Last summer Nicaragua kicked my
butt.

Going down as a doe-eyed American, I
was crushed by the realities of Nicaragua.
As I sat pounding my head into my carry
on bag during my eight-hour layover in
the Miami airport with no way of turning
back, I had a premonition it'd all happen.
Go with that gut feeling.
Who was I to go somewhere that I
wasn't welcome? Who was I to find my
way around without the rigors of a few
hours of some pansy Spanish-for-foreign
ers school planning my every bowel
movement? Who was I to think I could
not be conquered?
Oh, if I knew then what I know now.
Hey, I learned a lot. I went to high
school for a week. I taught pre-school for
a week. I played for two weeks with kids
with funky skin diseases, touring some of
the most unfortunate, miserable housing
conditions I hope to ever see. I met impor
tant people, and got several marriage pro
posals touring the countryside talking to
ex-contra and ex-Sandinista leaders.
I even got a parasite.
But all resume-packing aside, the
hours of fulfilling cultural education I
received don't really make up for the 12
hours a day I spent watching Xuxa and
the worst bunch of soap operas Dante
could concoct, my legs swollen with
mosquito bites, unable to leave the house
for lack of a rapid-transit system and the
danger of walking alone on the streets.

Lucky me.
Sitting in the living room every day, I
tried to invent reasons to go to the air
conditioned supermarket one more time,
just to get out of the tiny room that was
my world. I couldn't go out by myself,
because of my hosts' fear I'd be snatched
up because of my watch, my earrings, my
Lucky Charm decoder ring.
They quickly tired of having me
around, but there was no escape. I
couldn't just go hang out with the small
children selling gum, hairbrushes and
newspapers to bored commuters at every
highway intersection. I couldn't go any
where. I was trapped with an ornery 77-
year old woman, with no alternative.
Shoot me now.
And as I sat in my room, reading the
five letters my mom had sent me, 20
times each a day, I wondered why god
hated ine. I was a burden. I felt useless. I
couldn't make anyone's life better.
Money, concern, even action couldn't
change these people's world. I felt that
people honestly hated me. And I hadn't
even tried.
If only I'd known it could be so easy.
I was powerless. The people around
me were powerless. Nicaragua was going
to teach me a lesson. There are some
things you can't fix. There were no 25-
cents-in-someone's-cup solutions to make
everything OK. I was just as helpless as

the people leading oxcarts In the street.
For the first time in my life, I truly
believed I would die. If I couldn't do any
thing for the people around me, why not?
Put me out of my misery.
When they thought I had malaria, I
waited for it. When we got shot at sitting
outside someone's plywood house, I
expected it. When the man at immigra
tion said he wouldn't let me get on my
flight, and that I'd have to stay in the
country, I begged for it.
Death becomes her.
For six weeks of pitiful longing, I had
dreamt soft dreams of my return home.
Defeat.
But, despite it all, I'm going back. Like
walking in high heels, I insist on renew
ing the pain. I can't accept the defeat. I
am a coward. I wanted to come home
early. I thought about buying a new plane
ticket so I could take a hot shower and
flush the toilet again.
I was such a girl.
So I'm going back. Take two. Rewrite
the script. Be a woman this time. This
time I'm going to learn from Nicaragua.
And we'll see who wins.
I'll send you a postcard.

highway intersection. I couldn't go any
where. I was trapped with an ornery 77-
year old woman, with no alternative.
Shoot me now.
And as I sat in my room, reading the
five letters my mom had sent me, 20
times each a day, I wondered why god
hated ine. I was a burden. I felt useless. I
couldn't make anyone's life better.
Money, concern, even action couldn't
change these people's world. I felt that
people honestly hated me. And I hadn't
even tried.
If only I'd known it could be so easy.
I was powerless. The people around
me were powerless. Nicaragua was going
to teach me a lesson. There are some
things you can't fix. There were no 25-
cents-in-someone's-cup solutions to make
everything OK. I was just as helpless as

the people leading oxcarts In the street.
For the first time in my life, I truly
believed I would die. If I couldn't do any
thing for the people around me, why not?
Put me out of my misery.
When they thought I had malaria, I
waited for it. When we got shot at sitting
outside someone's plywood house, I
expected it. When the man at immigra
tion said he wouldn't let me get on my
flight, and that I'd have to stay in the
country, I begged for it.
Death becomes her.
For six weeks of pitiful longing, I had
dreamt soft dreams of my return home.
Defeat.
But, despite it all, I'm going back. Like
walking in high heels, I insist on renew
ing the pain. I can't accept the defeat. I
am a coward. I wanted to come home
early. I thought about buying a new plane
ticket so I could take a hot shower and
flush the toilet again.
I was such a girl.
So I'm going back. Take two. Rewrite
the script. Be a woman this time. This
time I'm going to learn from Nicaragua.
And we'll see who wins.
I'll send you a postcard.

Sometimes i can be such a cow
ard. Despite my macho exterior —
that ability to crush beer cans on my
forehead, my shocking bench pressing
ability and the way I can get my eyebrows
to feather just so — I am a coward.
Don't blow my cover.
Yes, I can go on infinitely awkward
blind dates to the Coffee House. Yes, I can
introduce myself at loud parties and not
flinch as my new-found friend shouts
back an obscene butchering of my name.
OK, so maybe I can tan in my bikini out
on Wilbur Field while extremely attractive
large men are playing topless basketball.
Twist my arm.
But I want true courage. Like the lion
in the Wizard of Oz, without the butt
kissing permed hairdo.
No fear.
I used to be invincible. I used to cross
the street without looking left-right-left
again. I used to ride a bike with no hands.
I used to participate in my Spanish class
es.
The wonder years.
But now, I couldn't ask a question in a
large lecture class to save my sister's vir
ginity. I avoid discussions about ethnic
theme houses like three-unit classes with
mountainous course readers.
I don't deserve to grace this campus.
But I hope to reverse this repulsive
trend, this lack of balls, as it were. I

dream of the day when I can have sex in
the library, get a tattoo on my bikini line
and wear only suspenders and a sarong to
Exotic Erotic.
All in the same day, of course.
I didn't used to be this way. It's just a
phase. A nasty little temporary flaw. But
it's been around since last summer, and
the time has come to move on.
Check please.
So, I am getting to the root of my
problem. I am facing the music, paying
the piper, laying in the oh-so-comfy egg
cartoned bed I have made.
I'm going to Nicaragua.
Nicaragua, I said. Feel free to tag
along.
I know, I know, Nicaragua isn't
included on those 14-day, tighten-your
buns-in-between-ports-of-call cruises. No
spring-break deluxe packages to scenic
Managua. No five days and five nights
hotel stays. There's a reason for that.
Nicaragua is my own personal hell.
I left with a few ounces of self-respect,
but I came back with a new perspective
on my previous bravery.
I know people who love Nicaragua.
Half of them now live in my hometown in
L.A. But last summer the country and I
had a battle of wills, and I went down for
the count.
Last summer Nicaragua kicked my
butt.

Going down as a doe-eyed American, I
was crushed by the realities of Nicaragua.
As I sat pounding my head into my carry
on bag during my eight-hour layover in
the Miami airport with no way of turning
back, I had a premonition it'd all happen.
Go with that gut feeling.
Who was I to go somewhere that I
wasn't welcome? Who was I to find my
way around without the rigors of a few
hours of some pansy Spanish-for-foreign
ers school planning my every bowel
movement? Who was I to think I could
not be conquered?
Oh, if I knew then what I know now.
Hey, I learned a lot. I went to high
school for a week. I taught pre-school for
a week. I played for two weeks with kids
with funky skin diseases, touring some of
the most unfortunate, miserable housing
conditions I hope to ever see. I met impor
tant people, and got several marriage pro
posals touring the countryside talking to
ex-contra and ex-Sandinista leaders.
I even got a parasite.
But all resume-packing aside, the
hours of fulfilling cultural education I
received don't really make up for the 12
hours a day I spent watching Xuxa and
the worst bunch of soap operas Dante
could concoct, my legs swollen with
mosquito bites, unable to leave the house
for lack of a rapid-transit system and the
danger of walking alone on the streets.

Lucky me.
Sitting in the living room every day, I
tried to invent reasons to go to the air
conditioned supermarket one more time,
just to get out of the tiny room that was
my world. I couldn't go out by myself,
because of my hosts' fear I'd be snatched
up because of my watch, my earrings, my
Lucky Charm decoder ring.
They quickly tired of having me
around, but there was no escape. I
couldn't just go hang out with the small
children selling gum, hairbrushes and
newspapers to bored commuters at every
highway intersection. I couldn't go any
where. I was trapped with an ornery 77-
year old woman, with no alternative.
Shoot me now.
And as I sat in my room, reading the
five letters my mom had sent me, 20
times each a day, I wondered why god
hated ine. I was a burden. I felt useless. I
couldn't make anyone's life better.
