## Med School biologists discover bacteria have a 'nose' 
### Jim Morris Staff writer 
Bacteria, without even know
ing it, took another step up on
the ladder of evolution this past
month with the published find
ings of three Stanford
researchers.
Lucy Shapiro, chair of the
Medical School's Department of
Developmental Biology, and two
post-doctoral students, Janine
Maddock and Dickon Alley,
have found "noses" on the com
mon bacteria Escherichia coli
and Caulobacter crescentus.
These bacteria are found in
human stomachs and tap water,
respectively.
Although these "noses" do
not physically resemble the
usual human proboscis, in
many ways they exhibit similar
behavior.
While the human nose smells
detecting pleasant or poten
tially dangerous odors — a bac
teria's "nose," according to
Maddock, consists of several
sensory proteins called
chemoreceptors that detect food
or poisons in whatever environ
ment the bacteria lives.
The discovery demonsrated

that these chemoreceptors are
localized to one area of the bac
teria's membrane, the cell pole,
instead of being uniformly dis
tributed.
Localization of chemorecep
tors betrays all previous
thoughts about bacteria —
organisms scientists didn't con
sider sophisticated enough to
actively collect proteins in one
location.
"The bacterial cell exhibits a
level of organization and com
plexity that has not been appre
ciated, up until now," Shapiro
said.
She continued, "This discov
ery will change textbook
descriptions of bacteria that are
currently referred to as bags of
enzymes."
Recently, developmental biol
ogists have become more aware
of research opportunities in this
area.
"Even though bacteria are so
tiny, it doesn't mean that just
because you don't see some
thing it isn't there." Alley said.
In the days before modern
technology, people thought all
foundational bacteria research
was completed. Biologists have
not re-examined fundamentals

using new technologies until
Maddock turned the electron
microscope's beam on E. coli.
Previously, researchers had
missed detecting chemorecep
tors forming at a specific site —
the bacterium's "nose."
The "nose," a grouping of
chemotaxis proteins, is used to
aid chemotaxis, which is the
movement toward food or move
ment away from poison.
To find "the nose," Maddock
attached a particle of gold to
each protein using a series of
antibodies and examined them
under an electron microscope.
The microscope beam did not
detect the proteins themselves,
but it showed black dots wher
ever gold particles — and thus
the proteins — resided.
Using this technique, she
found that bacteria do somehow
localize proteins into a complex
at the cell pole, hence labeled a
"nose."
While Maddock was magnify
ing E. coli 100,000 times on an
electron microscope, research
ers at the University of Indiana
were looking at a bacterium
found in an Australian sturgeon
fish with their naked eyes.
The fact that such a large
bacterium exists challenges pre
conceived notions that bacteria
perform all of their cellular
functions through diffusion, a
process similar to the perme
ation of an odor in a closed
room.
These findings, published a
day before those of the Stanford
researchers, proved a common
point — bacteria indeed have an
organization more complex
than previously thought.
Cells in higher organisms
have a cytoskeleton — which
can be imagined as a road, with
stop-lights, where certain pro
teins travel to specific places.
Maddock said that visible
structures like a cytoskeleton
have not been found in bacte
ria, but suggested that, differ
ent machinery, or perhaps an
"invisible" cytoskelton, move
proteins around in a bacterium.
This research is already cap
turing the interest of drug com

panies. "We've been getting
calls from drug companies
because they're interested in
utilizing potentially new types
of machinery in the bacterial
cell as targets for new classes of
antibodies," Shapiro said.
The quest for new drugs aris
es because "adapted" strains of
bacteria are rendering present
formulas of antibiotics useless.
According to Shapiro, tubercu
losis is a prime example.
Alley's research on Caulobac
ter gave the first indication of
chemotaxis — the localization
of proteins.
He was studying the bacterial
development and noticed that
just before cell division, the cell
grouped certain proteins in one
end.
From there, Maddock picked
up on this research and exam
ined E. coli to look for two
things — if this phenomena is
found among all bacteria and if
other proteins, involved in
chemotaxis, were localized
along with the chemoreceptors.
Maddock found that E. coli
exhibited the same localization

of proteins as Caulobacter, but
also found that three proteins,
when put together, caused local
ization. She concluded that the
process occurs as a group effort.
She noted that these might
not be the only proteins
involved in localization, but
without them, grouping did not
occur.
"Consider the localization
components to be like parts of a
bicycle. When and only when all
the parts are together will the
bicycle work," Shapiro said. "As
for localization in E. coli, only
when all of the necessary pro
teins are assembled will the
'nose' come to form."
Alley then looked closer at
Caulobacter with this idea that
bacteria were more specialized
than previously thought.
He wanted to know why the
protein complex localized at just
one end of the cell before it split
off to form a new cell.
While searching for the spe
cialization that would relocate
proteins to specific places from
their previous random disburse
ment, he made another discov

ery.
The new cell, a result of cell
division, grew a flagellum,
whereas, the old cell which had
dropped its flagellum before
dividing remained without one.
He found that the old cell
became stationary after cell
division, and no longer had use
for the "nose."
Since it no longer engaged in
chemotaxis, its chemoreceptors
were actively destroyed.
DNA governs the reproduc
tive process in bacteria and car
ries the instructions to destroy
these chemoreceptors. It is
encoded in definite parts of its
molecular structure, known as
genes.
A process called differentia
tion controls the timing of and
the extent to which these genes
take an active part in the life of
a bacterium.
"A large portion of DNA in
bacteria ... is excess or unus
able because the organism has
evolved beyond them. They're
still there, but they're rendered
useless by evolution," Alley
said.

things — if this phenomena is
found among all bacteria and if
other proteins, involved in
chemotaxis, were localized
along with the chemoreceptors.
Maddock found that E. coli
exhibited the same localization

of proteins as Caulobacter, but
also found that three proteins,
when put together, caused local
ization. She concluded that the
process occurs as a group effort.
She noted that these might
not be the only proteins
involved in localization, but
without them, grouping did not
occur.
"Consider the localization
components to be like parts of a
bicycle. When and only when all
the parts are together will the
bicycle work," Shapiro said. "As
for localization in E. coli, only
when all of the necessary pro
teins are assembled will the
'nose' come to form."
Alley then looked closer at
Caulobacter with this idea that
bacteria were more specialized
than previously thought.
He wanted to know why the
protein complex localized at just
one end of the cell before it split
off to form a new cell.
While searching for the spe
cialization that would relocate
proteins to specific places from
their previous random disburse
ment, he made another discov

ery.
The new cell, a result of cell
division, grew a flagellum,
whereas, the old cell which had
dropped its flagellum before
dividing remained without one.
He found that the old cell
became stationary after cell
division, and no longer had use
for the "nose."
Since it no longer engaged in
chemotaxis, its chemoreceptors
were actively destroyed.
DNA governs the reproduc
tive process in bacteria and car
ries the instructions to destroy
these chemoreceptors. It is
encoded in definite parts of its
molecular structure, known as
genes.
A process called differentia
tion controls the timing of and
the extent to which these genes
take an active part in the life of
a bacterium.
"A large portion of DNA in
bacteria ... is excess or unus
able because the organism has
evolved beyond them. They're
still there, but they're rendered
useless by evolution," Alley
said.

Bacteria, without even know
ing it, took another step up on
the ladder of evolution this past
month with the published find
ings of three Stanford
researchers.
Lucy Shapiro, chair of the
Medical School's Department of
Developmental Biology, and two
post-doctoral students, Janine
Maddock and Dickon Alley,
have found "noses" on the com
mon bacteria Escherichia coli
and Caulobacter crescentus.
These bacteria are found in
human stomachs and tap water,
respectively.
Although these "noses" do
not physically resemble the
usual human proboscis, in
many ways they exhibit similar
behavior.
While the human nose smells
detecting pleasant or poten
tially dangerous odors — a bac
teria's "nose," according to
Maddock, consists of several
sensory proteins called
chemoreceptors that detect food
or poisons in whatever environ
ment the bacteria lives.
The discovery demonsrated

that these chemoreceptors are
localized to one area of the bac
teria's membrane, the cell pole,
instead of being uniformly dis
tributed.
Localization of chemorecep
tors betrays all previous
thoughts about bacteria —
organisms scientists didn't con
sider sophisticated enough to
actively collect proteins in one
location.
"The bacterial cell exhibits a
level of organization and com
plexity that has not been appre
ciated, up until now," Shapiro
said.
She continued, "This discov
ery will change textbook
descriptions of bacteria that are
currently referred to as bags of
enzymes."
Recently, developmental biol
ogists have become more aware
of research opportunities in this
area.
"Even though bacteria are so
tiny, it doesn't mean that just
because you don't see some
thing it isn't there." Alley said.
In the days before modern
technology, people thought all
foundational bacteria research
was completed. Biologists have
not re-examined fundamentals

using new technologies until
Maddock turned the electron
microscope's beam on E. coli.
Previously, researchers had
missed detecting chemorecep
tors forming at a specific site —
the bacterium's "nose."
The "nose," a grouping of
chemotaxis proteins, is used to
aid chemotaxis, which is the
movement toward food or move
ment away from poison.
To find "the nose," Maddock
attached a particle of gold to
each protein using a series of
antibodies and examined them
under an electron microscope.
The microscope beam did not
detect the proteins themselves,
but it showed black dots wher
ever gold particles — and thus
the proteins — resided.
Using this technique, she
found that bacteria do somehow
localize proteins into a complex
at the cell pole, hence labeled a
"nose."
While Maddock was magnify
ing E. coli 100,000 times on an
electron microscope, research
ers at the University of Indiana
were looking at a bacterium
found in an Australian sturgeon
fish with their naked eyes.
The fact that such a large
bacterium exists challenges pre
conceived notions that bacteria
perform all of their cellular
functions through diffusion, a
process similar to the perme
ation of an odor in a closed
room.
These findings, published a
day before those of the Stanford
researchers, proved a common
point — bacteria indeed have an
organization more complex
than previously thought.
Cells in higher organisms
have a cytoskeleton — which
can be imagined as a road, with
stop-lights, where certain pro
teins travel to specific places.
Maddock said that visible
structures like a cytoskeleton
have not been found in bacte
ria, but suggested that, differ
ent machinery, or perhaps an
"invisible" cytoskelton, move
proteins around in a bacterium.
This research is already cap
turing the interest of drug com

panies. "We've been getting
calls from drug companies
because they're interested in
utilizing potentially new types
of machinery in the bacterial
cell as targets for new classes of
antibodies," Shapiro said.
The quest for new drugs aris
es because "adapted" strains of
bacteria are rendering present
formulas of antibiotics useless.
According to Shapiro, tubercu
losis is a prime example.
Alley's research on Caulobac
ter gave the first indication of
chemotaxis — the localization
of proteins.
He was studying the bacterial
development and noticed that
just before cell division, the cell
grouped certain proteins in one
end.
From there, Maddock picked
up on this research and exam
ined E. coli to look for two
things — if this phenomena is
found among all bacteria and if
other proteins, involved in
chemotaxis, were localized
along with the chemoreceptors.
Maddock found that E. coli
exhibited the same localization

of proteins as Caulobacter, but
also found that three proteins,
when put together, caused local
ization. She concluded that the
process occurs as a group effort.
