## Answers to awful asparagus aroma

A: For those who consider this topic trivial,
I have but one thing to say: You are prob
ably right.
Nonetheless, since science amounts to
little more than the obsessive scrutinization
of the banal, I will provide an answer to this

They fed their subjects
asparagus, waited a while,
and had them fill a little cup.
After having their subjects
score themselves (by sniff
ing their little cups) as
"excreters" or "nonex
creters," they had the mem
bers of each category
switch cups and smell
each other's urine.

odoriferous reader's question.
In 1956, two Oxford professors reported
— in Nature Magazine, no less — that
among the individuals they surveyed,
roughly one in five was able to detect a char
acteristic odor in the urine they excreted an
hour or so after eating four sticks of com
mon garden asparagus.
A chemist colleague, presumably another
Oxford don inadequately occupied by more
significant endeavors, demonstrated that
the compound responsible for the smell was
methanethiol, CR3SH.
Methanethiol is closely related to the
widely touted potential wonder-fuel
methanol, CH3OH, except that it has a
stinky sulfur in place of methane's oxygen.
The authors of the study assumed —
incorrectly — that those who could smell
methanethiol in their urine after eating
asparagus were the only ones who were
excreting the substance, and set about
investigating whether this "error of
metabolism" was inborn or sporadic.
They found that the children of "non

excreters" were invariably "non-excreters"
themselves, that "non-excreters" who mar
ried "excreters" had about half of each type
of child, and that "excreters" who tastefully
married their own kind had a yet improved
chance of begetting children with the same
trait.
This pattern led the experimenters to
conclude that the excretion of methanethiol
in the urine following consumption of
asparagus is a dominant trait.
For those of you still struggling with
first-quarter Hum Bio material, let me
explain what this means: Genes come in dif
ferent versions called "alleles."
You get two copies of each gene, one from
each parent; the allele of a given gene that
you get from mom can be the same, or dif
ferent, from the one you get from dad. To
express a dominant trait, an individual
needs to carry at least one copy of the corre
sponding allele.
The authors were very proud of their
findings, and trumpeted about being among
the first to observe a genetic polymorphism
in human beings.
A gene is said to be polymorphic when two
or more alleles exist in a given population at
relatively high frequencies that can't be
explained by recurrent mutation.
One school of thought contends that
polymorphisms are maintained only when
individuals who are heterozygous — i.e.,
those who possess two different alleles for
the gene in question — are better survivors
than those who carry two copies of any
given allele.
The authors of this early paper went as
far as to suggest that the excreter/non
excreter polymorphism was maintained in
human populations as a result of just such a
heterozygote advantage — perhaps, they
hypothesized, people who carried one copy
of each allele were somehow unusually
resistant to disease.
Yeah, right.
Pretty exciting, no?

Well, no. What's more, the authors of the
1956 paper were wrong on at least one count
and possibly on others, but it wasn't until
1980 that someone showed them up.
In that fateful year, another pack of
British researchers finally thought to do a
very simple control experiment: They fed
their subjects asparagus, waited a while,
and had them fill a little cup — thus far, the
same as the earlier study. But after having
their subjects score themselves (by sniffing
their little cups) as "excreters" or "non
excreters," they had the members of each
category switch cups and smell each other's
urine.
They found that anyone who could smell
methanethiol in their own urine after eat
ing asparagus could also detect it in the
urine of anyone who had just snacked on the
vegetable, even if the "donor" could not
smell it in their own.
The inverse was also true: those who
were blissfully unaware of their own uri
nary aroma were similarly oblivious of the
stench in the urine of others.
Hence, it became clear that the trait of
interest isn't excretion of methanethiol but
rather the ability to detect it.
Furthermore, the trait might not be dom
inantly inherited or even inherited at all.
The original study surveyed a pitifully small
sample size — 115 people — and looked at
only two generations of subjects (parents
and children).
To make significant conclusions about
modes of inheritance, they would have had
to dramatically increase the number of sub
jects.
Or get the existing subjects' grandpar
ents to sniff their own urine.
