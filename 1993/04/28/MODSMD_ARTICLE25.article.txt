## Carl Sagan answers science questions 
### Heather Rock Staff writer 
Addressing "billions and bil
lions" of questions Friday,
astronomer Carl Sagan spoke
about everything from God to
extra-terrestrials to ooze.
Wryly choosing his words,
Sagan dealt with controversial
topics, such as how to reconcile
religion and science
"Of course I believe in God —
the God of Einstein," said Sagan,
which he described as the sum
total of the physcial laws of the
universe. He then explained the
intellectual advantages of the
religion of science over that of
conventional religion.
"The best part about the sci
entific method is that it has a
built-in error correction
machine," Sagan said. "We are
fully capable of deceiving our
selves, and beauracratic religions
have no self-correction."
Expanding on the relations
between science and religion,
Sagan addressed sticky issues
such as evolution, which encom
pass both disciplines.
Mincing no words, Darwin
demoted mankind from its posi
tion as "the ruler of all living
things on Earth," and dismissed
arguments of scientific creation
ists and religious groups who
oppose teaching evolution in
schools.
Scientific creationists, who
believe in the biblical creation
story, prefer to explan human
existence in terms of supernatu
ral intervention. They want to
think human come from angels,
not ooze, Sagan said. "Ooze is not
uplifting."
It is human's emotional need
to feel important, Sagan said,
that leads them to believe that
out of the billions of planets in
the universe, Earth is the only
one with life. Sagan dismissed
such self-importance as arro
gance.
"We are only a small planet in
the galactic boondocks of space,
with other galaxies running away
from us (referring to the expan
sion of the universe) as if we had
some loathsome cosmic disease,"
Sagan said.
Turning to issues of life in

space, Sagan said no repeatable
radio signals from extra-terrestri
al life forms have been detected in
experiments which also broad
cast radio signals into space.
When asked about the poten
tial dangers of revealing humans'
position to extra-terrestrial life by
broadcasting such signals, Sagan
shrugged off the fear.
"If they're more advanced
than we are, there's nothing we
can do except hide — but it's too
late!" Sagan said.
According to Sagan, the last
45 years of television and radio
broadcasting has leaked such
human accomplishments Howdy
Doody, the Mac Arthur hearings
and other "intelligent" signs of
life to hundreds of stars. But he
doubted whether such "samples"
of human life would entice a visit
from far-off life forms.
"Do we have such a delicate
flavor that we're worth crossing
interstellar distances for?" he
asked.
Sagan said that if extra-terres
tials did show up it would be
more efficient for them to take a
few humans and clone us rather
than, as numerous people claim,
snatching many bodies at many
different times.
The search for extra-terres
tials is just one component of the
space program, Sagan said. Space
research that does not send peo
ple into space — like satellites
and spacecraft to other planets —
brings the most rewards for the
least cost, according to Sagan. He
cited examples such as satellites
for communication, weather,
treaty verification, and Earth
studies as space programs which
have saved lots of money and
have offered obvious benefits.
Sagan also noted that Earth
monitoring satellites have gath
ered recent data that clearly
shows that "the dominant organ
ism on Earth is putting itself at
risk."
He elaborated by explaining
that satellites have detected top
soil loss in Madagascar so
extreme that none will be left in a
few decades, and fires in the
Amazonian basin show up on
satellite pictures as bright orange
