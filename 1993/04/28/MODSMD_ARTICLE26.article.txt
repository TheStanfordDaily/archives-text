## Cardinal unleashes latent attack, downs Dons 20-8 
### Sean May Staff writer 
And you thought Rocky IV
had a lot of hitting.
In a baseball game that more
closely resembled a drinking
game, the Stanford and Univer
sity of San Francisco batters
pounded a combined 37 hits,
but the Cardinal got 21 of them
and came away with a 20-8 vic
tory over the Dons at Benedetti
Diamond at USF.
The 20-run, 21 -hit assault
was the biggest offensive output
of the year for the normally
reserved Cardinal bats, besting
previous season highs of 15 and
19.
Stanford (22-20 overall)
exploded for six runs in the first
inning, five in the third and a
total of 18 in the first five
innings to put the game out of
reach in a hurry.
Second baseman Todd
Laßocca led the early-inning
onslaught for Stanford, going 4-
for-6, including a double and a
two-run home run (his fourth of
the year), scoring three runs
and knocking in five.
Laßocca was not alone, as the
entire Cardinal squad feasted
on the four pitchers used by the
Dons (6-37).
It was an extra-base extrava
ganza for the Cardinal batters,
as they hit three doubles, a
triple and a total of five home
runs.
In addition to Laßocca's
blast in the fourth, Jed Hansen
contributed two home runs,

while Brian Dallimore and
Steve Carver smote one dinger a
piece.
Stanford wasted no time
jumping all over Don starter
and eventual loser Augie Acuna
(0-3). Dallimore led off the game
with a double to right, and
Hansen followed with a walk.

After Dusty Allen forced Dal
limore at third, A.J. Hinch hit
an RBI single.
Three batters later, with the
bases loaded and two out, Rod
Meyer walked in the second run.
Laßocca and Brodie Van Wage
nen then hit consecutive two
run doubles to make the score 6-
0 Stanford.
USF looked like it might
threaten the Cardinal in the
bottom of the frame, scoring
three runs and six hits of its
own off winner Mario Iglesias
(2-2), including Sammy Taylor's
second homer of the year.
But the Cardinal was just too
strong. After Hansen's solo shot
in the second, Stanford poured
it on some more in the third.
Five consecutive hits, including
singles by Meyer and Laßocca, a
triple by Van Wagenen and
back-to-back homers by Dal
limore — his second of the year
— and Hansen — his team-lead
ing eighth — gave the Cardinal
five more runs, a 12-3 lead and
the chance to coast the rest of
the way.
It was another committee
effort for the Cardinal on the
mound.
Iglesias settled down after
the shaky first, shutting out the
Dons in the next three innings
while giving up only two hits.
Matt Marenghi pitched a solid
two frames, allowing only one
run.
Dan Ripoll got touched for
four runs after the game was
already in hand, and Cliff Kali
nowsky threw a scoreless ninth.

Cardinal Note
The Cardinal probably wishes it
could play the rebuilding Dons in
every game. Stanford swept the
home-and-home season series,
outscoring USF 31-12 in the two
games.
Coach Mark Marquess' record
against the Dons now stands at 36-
3, and the Cardinal now has a 5-0
record on Tuesdays.


Ai Green — Daily file
Jed Hansen arrives safely at second base. Hansen collected four hits off of University of San
Francisco pitching yesterday, including two home runs to bring his team-leading total to eight.

After Dusty Allen forced Dal
limore at third, A.J. Hinch hit
an RBI single.
Three batters later, with the
bases loaded and two out, Rod
Meyer walked in the second run.
Laßocca and Brodie Van Wage
nen then hit consecutive two
run doubles to make the score 6-
0 Stanford.
USF looked like it might
threaten the Cardinal in the
bottom of the frame, scoring
three runs and six hits of its
own off winner Mario Iglesias
(2-2), including Sammy Taylor's
second homer of the year.
But the Cardinal was just too
strong. After Hansen's solo shot
in the second, Stanford poured
it on some more in the third.
Five consecutive hits, including
singles by Meyer and Laßocca, a
triple by Van Wagenen and
back-to-back homers by Dal
limore — his second of the year
— and Hansen — his team-lead
ing eighth — gave the Cardinal
five more runs, a 12-3 lead and
the chance to coast the rest of
the way.
It was another committee
effort for the Cardinal on the
mound.
Iglesias settled down after
the shaky first, shutting out the
Dons in the next three innings
while giving up only two hits.
Matt Marenghi pitched a solid
two frames, allowing only one
run.
Dan Ripoll got touched for
four runs after the game was
already in hand, and Cliff Kali
nowsky threw a scoreless ninth.

Cardinal Note
The Cardinal probably wishes it
could play the rebuilding Dons in
every game. Stanford swept the
home-and-home season series,
outscoring USF 31-12 in the two
games.
Coach Mark Marquess' record
against the Dons now stands at 36-
3, and the Cardinal now has a 5-0
record on Tuesdays.


Ai Green — Daily file
Jed Hansen arrives safely at second base. Hansen collected four hits off of University of San
Francisco pitching yesterday, including two home runs to bring his team-leading total to eight.
And you thought Rocky IV
had a lot of hitting.
In a baseball game that more
closely resembled a drinking
game, the Stanford and Univer
sity of San Francisco batters
pounded a combined 37 hits,
but the Cardinal got 21 of them
and came away with a 20-8 vic
tory over the Dons at Benedetti
Diamond at USF.
The 20-run, 21 -hit assault
was the biggest offensive output
of the year for the normally
reserved Cardinal bats, besting
previous season highs of 15 and
19.
Stanford (22-20 overall)
exploded for six runs in the first
inning, five in the third and a
total of 18 in the first five
innings to put the game out of
reach in a hurry.
Second baseman Todd
Laßocca led the early-inning
onslaught for Stanford, going 4-
for-6, including a double and a
two-run home run (his fourth of
the year), scoring three runs
and knocking in five.
Laßocca was not alone, as the
entire Cardinal squad feasted
on the four pitchers used by the
Dons (6-37).
It was an extra-base extrava
ganza for the Cardinal batters,
as they hit three doubles, a
triple and a total of five home
runs.
In addition to Laßocca's
blast in the fourth, Jed Hansen
contributed two home runs,

while Brian Dallimore and
Steve Carver smote one dinger a
piece.
Stanford wasted no time
jumping all over Don starter
and eventual loser Augie Acuna
(0-3). Dallimore led off the game
with a double to right, and
Hansen followed with a walk.
