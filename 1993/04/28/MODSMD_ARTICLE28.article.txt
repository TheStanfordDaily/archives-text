# Eclipse: Suns will find NBA playoffs too hot to handle
## 
### 
IN THE HISTORY of the world, there
have been something on the order of
billions of sunrises. However, as of
this morning, the sun had also cascaded
over the horizon billions-minus-one
times.
Sunrise, sunset — it's a paradigm as
simple as night and day, as fundamen
tal as that "Fiddler on the Roof' song
that makes Jewish parents melt "like
butta" at every Bar/Bat Mitzvah recep
tion.
Sunrise, Sunset — now that the
marathon National Basketball Associa
tion regular season has finally broken
the tape, the achievements of the
Phoenix Suns have emerged as the
story of the year, rivaled only possibly
by the Chicago Bulls' quest for a "three
peat" in the winner's circle.
To their credit, the Suns' 1992-93
record speaks of success. Newly
acquired captain and emotional-leader
Charles Barkley is a hands-down choice
for league MVP. The franchise's 60 vic
tories marked the first time the squad
has reached that milestone. Rookie
head coach Paul Westphal, who just
happened to be a local hero already,
smoothed the transition into the
Barkley era and rode out a string of
injuries to point guard Kevin Johnson.
The America West Arena, their brand
spanking-new greenhouse, packed in
19,000 Arizona hoops addicts for all 41

home dates.
Sporting a league-best 62-20 record,
however, the Suns have little time to
bask in their glow, as they find them
selves at the brink of a new challenge.
For all of their accomplishments to
date, the Suns have clinched home
court advantage in the world's toughest
tournament, the NBA's "second sea
son," for as long as they can stand the
heat.
Wait a minute. The "second season"?
Haven't the Suns earned the right to
pack it up and go home for the summer,
with the Larry O'Brien championship
trophy coming C.O.D. after the
engravers get through with it? Didn't
NBC just Chrome-a-key an impressive
array of statistics before our very eyes
last weekend to the effect that the team
with the home-court edge fails to win
the NBA playoffs about as often as Cuba
changes dictators?
Well, yes, no and it really doesn't
matter. The league didn't become the
fastest-growing professional sport in
the history of the universe over the last
decade by calling it quits in April. No
sirree. While the integrity of the game
may have been compromised as a result
of skyrocketing salaries (read agents)
and expansion, the NBA game stands at
a pinnacle of talent and excitement.
Nowhere is this talent and excitement
showcased more successfully than in

the postseason, where contestants now
battle for the right to cash the largest
bonus check.
Funny things happen on the way to
the bank, though. Sometime between

now and the Suns' predicted June date
with the ATM, the referees will swallow
their whistles. The pounding in the
paint will get more severe as the trees in
the key grow bigger trunks. The have
nots of the regular season will see the
writing on the wall and make the most
of their opportunities to inflict damage
on their way to next season.
All of a sudden, the Suns will find
themselves in a new solar system, one in
which the stars that prey on darkness
pounce on the first sign of perceived
weakness. Which brings me to the philo
sophical dilemma posed by this year's
designated juggernaut: if the center
cannot hold, won't things fall apart?
Phoenix starts 6-foot-10 Mark West

at center. Don't get me wrong, West is a
decent NBA player — for a power for
ward. In the playoffs, however, a center
must do more than jump at the begin
ning of the game and get out of Sir
Charles' way, and this is where West
goes south.
Remember David Robinson? His San
Antonio Spurs could face the Suns in
the Western Conference semifinals.
Does the name Hakeem Olajuwon ring a
bell? His Houston Rockets most likely
loom in the conference finals. All those
who think Mark West can stop Robin
son and Olajuwon, much less one of
them, raise your hand.
Not so fast, Mr. Barkley.
Suppose, though, that after surviv
ing a first-round scare by the Los Ange
les Lakers (homer alert!) and defeating
the Spurs or the Portland Trail Blazers
in the semis, the Suns manage to
ground the Rockets and earn their first
conference title in 17 years.
Now it's time to consider the New
York Knicks, the NBA Finals and the
fatigue factor (the Knicks will have
ended the weary Bulls' mini-dynasty
after Chicago is roughed up by the
Cleveland Cavaliers in a tough second
round series).
For this final test, we go to the
bench. No, not the grown men in under
wear who call themselves "reserves."
I'm talking about the balding gentle

men with the Armani digs, men whose
jobs ultimately ride on maintaining the
spirits of millionaires for nearly nine
months and 100 games — the coaches.
The stakes get even higher for the suits
when considering last month's bench
clearing brewhaha between the Knicks
and Suns, which adds the task of
babysitter to their resumes.
In this corner: the Knicks' Pat Riley,
owner of four NBA Championship
rings, the most playoff wins of any
coach in history, 1990 Coach of the Year
honors and an impeccable hairdo.
And in this corner: Westphal. Well,
he was a great player.
And so the West will phal, as it has in
each of the last four years, when the
Lakers and Blazers tallied an abysmal
4-16 mark in championship play. The
West will phal because for the Suns' one
Charles, the Knicks counter with two,
Smith and Oakley. The West will fall
because of West, or have we forgotten
the game's best big man, Patrick
Ewing?
Need any more reasons? Watch what
happens at about 8:15 tonight. Suns
rise, Suns-set.

that makes Jewish parents melt "like
butta" at every Bar/Bat Mitzvah recep
tion.
Sunrise, Sunset — now that the
marathon National Basketball Associa
tion regular season has finally broken
the tape, the achievements of the
Phoenix Suns have emerged as the
story of the year, rivaled only possibly
by the Chicago Bulls' quest for a "three
peat" in the winner's circle.
To their credit, the Suns' 1992-93
record speaks of success. Newly
acquired captain and emotional-leader
Charles Barkley is a hands-down choice
for league MVP. The franchise's 60 vic
tories marked the first time the squad
has reached that milestone. Rookie
head coach Paul Westphal, who just
happened to be a local hero already,
smoothed the transition into the
Barkley era and rode out a string of
injuries to point guard Kevin Johnson.
The America West Arena, their brand
spanking-new greenhouse, packed in
19,000 Arizona hoops addicts for all 41

home dates.
Sporting a league-best 62-20 record,
however, the Suns have little time to
bask in their glow, as they find them
selves at the brink of a new challenge.
For all of their accomplishments to
date, the Suns have clinched home
court advantage in the world's toughest
tournament, the NBA's "second sea
son," for as long as they can stand the
heat.
Wait a minute. The "second season"?
Haven't the Suns earned the right to
pack it up and go home for the summer,
with the Larry O'Brien championship
trophy coming C.O.D. after the
engravers get through with it? Didn't
NBC just Chrome-a-key an impressive
array of statistics before our very eyes
last weekend to the effect that the team
with the home-court edge fails to win
the NBA playoffs about as often as Cuba
changes dictators?
Well, yes, no and it really doesn't
matter. The league didn't become the
fastest-growing professional sport in
the history of the universe over the last
decade by calling it quits in April. No
sirree. While the integrity of the game
may have been compromised as a result
of skyrocketing salaries (read agents)
and expansion, the NBA game stands at
a pinnacle of talent and excitement.
Nowhere is this talent and excitement
showcased more successfully than in

the postseason, where contestants now
battle for the right to cash the largest
bonus check.
Funny things happen on the way to
the bank, though. Sometime between

now and the Suns' predicted June date
with the ATM, the referees will swallow
their whistles. The pounding in the
paint will get more severe as the trees in
the key grow bigger trunks. The have
nots of the regular season will see the
writing on the wall and make the most
of their opportunities to inflict damage
on their way to next season.
All of a sudden, the Suns will find
themselves in a new solar system, one in
which the stars that prey on darkness
pounce on the first sign of perceived
weakness. Which brings me to the philo
sophical dilemma posed by this year's
designated juggernaut: if the center
cannot hold, won't things fall apart?
Phoenix starts 6-foot-10 Mark West

at center. Don't get me wrong, West is a
decent NBA player — for a power for
ward. In the playoffs, however, a center
must do more than jump at the begin
ning of the game and get out of Sir
Charles' way, and this is where West
goes south.
Remember David Robinson? His San
Antonio Spurs could face the Suns in
the Western Conference semifinals.
Does the name Hakeem Olajuwon ring a
bell? His Houston Rockets most likely
loom in the conference finals. All those
who think Mark West can stop Robin
son and Olajuwon, much less one of
them, raise your hand.
Not so fast, Mr. Barkley.
Suppose, though, that after surviv
ing a first-round scare by the Los Ange
les Lakers (homer alert!) and defeating
the Spurs or the Portland Trail Blazers
in the semis, the Suns manage to
ground the Rockets and earn their first
conference title in 17 years.
Now it's time to consider the New
York Knicks, the NBA Finals and the
fatigue factor (the Knicks will have
ended the weary Bulls' mini-dynasty
after Chicago is roughed up by the
Cleveland Cavaliers in a tough second
round series).
For this final test, we go to the
bench. No, not the grown men in under
wear who call themselves "reserves."
I'm talking about the balding gentle

men with the Armani digs, men whose
jobs ultimately ride on maintaining the
spirits of millionaires for nearly nine
months and 100 games — the coaches.
The stakes get even higher for the suits
when considering last month's bench
clearing brewhaha between the Knicks
and Suns, which adds the task of
babysitter to their resumes.
In this corner: the Knicks' Pat Riley,
owner of four NBA Championship
rings, the most playoff wins of any
coach in history, 1990 Coach of the Year
honors and an impeccable hairdo.
And in this corner: Westphal. Well,
he was a great player.
And so the West will phal, as it has in
each of the last four years, when the
Lakers and Blazers tallied an abysmal
4-16 mark in championship play. The
West will phal because for the Suns' one
Charles, the Knicks counter with two,
Smith and Oakley. The West will fall
because of West, or have we forgotten
the game's best big man, Patrick
Ewing?
Need any more reasons? Watch what
happens at about 8:15 tonight. Suns
rise, Suns-set.
