# Spikers to battle for Final Four berth
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Sometimes the numbers speak for
themselves.
Tonight, the second-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team (18-4,16-3 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) plays the
top-ranked UCLA Bruins (21-3, 16-3)
for the MPSF conference title at UC-
Irvine's Bren Events Center. However,
the only number that truly matters is
Final Four — an automatic berth to
which the winner of tonight's match is
entitled.
This clash of the volleyball titans
showcases the top offensive squads in the
nation. The Bruins have led the country
all year with a .418 team hitting percent
age, while the Cardinal has held down the
second spot, hitting .403 collectively.
Individually, the hitting percentages
are just as gaudy. At middle blocker,
UCLA's tandem of Jeff Nygaard and
Tim Kelly are second and fifth in the
country with hitting percentages of .490
and .465, respectively. Two feet away on
the other side of the net, Cardinal mid
dle blocker John Hribar hits at a .482
clip, good for third nationally. His mid
dle-blocking partner, sophomore Brian
Garrett, unloads kills at an astounding
.574 pace, which would lead the nation
by 50 percentage points if Garrett had
enough games to qualify.
For both squads, though, the big gun
plays opposite hitter. For Stanford, that
big gun is Ail-American Dave Goss. With
a .361 hitting percentage, Goss averages
7.09 kills-per-game, which is good for
third in the nation.
Mike Diehl, the Bruin's opposite hit
ter, injured his bicep tendon earlier in
the year and missed several season
opening matches. He has come back
from this injury to average 6.20 kills
per-game, which would place him sev

enth in the nation if he had enough
games.
"Goss carries a bigger load than their
opposite," said Cardinal coach Ruben
Nieves. "But Diehl is still their top hitter."
Quarterbacking the teams at setter,
both squads have dominant floor lead
ers. Stanford's playmaker is junior Ail-
American Canyon Ceman, whose pin
point sets make his teammates' lives
much easier. Just yesterday, Ceman was
named 1993 MPSF Player of the Year.
Mike Sealy, the Bruins' setter, gained
All-American honors last year and fol
lowed up with an All-MPSF perfor
mance this season. A jack-of-all-trades,
Sealy turned in an 83-assist, 11-dig, six
block effort against the Cardinal earlier
this year.
"He's having a great year," Nieves
said. "His play might be the single
biggest difference between UCLA of last
year and this year. Last year they were
pretty good but inconsistent. . .. This
year, start to finish, they have been the
top team in the country."
Defensively, the teams excel in differ
ent areas. For UCLA, that area is block
ing. Both in the top-10 nationally in
blocks-per-game, 6-foot-7 Nygaard and
6-foot-10 Kelly set an imposing obstacle
for any enemy hitter. Nygaard led the
country in blocking last year and this
year stands in sixth place with a 1.06
blocks-per-game average.
For the shorter Cardinal, digging is the
defensive key. In every important match,
a different Cardinal player has stepped up
to make an inordinate number of saves.
Both of the squad's swing hitters, Ryan
Moos and Bob Hillman, join Goss in the
MPSF top-10 in digs-per-game.
"I don't think it's realistic for us to
try to match their blocking," Nieves
said. "We have to make up for their
strong blocking by digging a lot of balls."
Stanford and UCLA met last month

in Pauley Pavilion, and the Cardinal left
with a dramatic 5-15, 11-15,15-13,15-6,
15-13 victory. The key to that match
was how the Cardinal handled another
Bruin weapon — their jump serve. In
the first two games, Stanford did not
pass well, which backed them into an 0-
2 corner. The Cardinal's comeback and
eventual win was a result of a vastly
improved passing effort, led by the play
of Moos ofT the bench.
Stanford enters tonight's match with
a slight psychological edge. The last
three times these two have played in sig
nificant matches, the Cardinal has come
away victorious. Last year, Stanford
ended UCLA's season with a 15-10, 15-
9, 15-11 win that sent the Cardinal to
the Final Four.
"Our record against them in the last
three years may be the best in the coun
try," Nieves said.
But the Bruins need only turn back
to the last 20 years, in which UCLA won
13 national championships and had
"something like a 50-1 record against
Stanford", according to Nieves.
Now these two teams stand face-to
face: UCLA, with its tradition of volleyball
dominance, and Stanford, an up-and-com
ing program. Neither likes what they see.
"You get tired of getting beat up by
that team," Nieves said. "And at the
same time they don't like the threat [of
a new volleyball power]. . . . Nobody
would call it a friendly rivalry."
"It will be an intense match," said
UCLA coach A 1 Scates.
Should the Cardinal falter in
tonight's match, it would be seeded into
the MPSF Tournament semifinals at
the Bren Center on Friday With a
win in the semis and a win in the final
on Saturday, the loser of the Stanford-
UCLA match would get the MPSF nom
ination to the NCAA Final Four, to take
place at Pauley Pavilion May 7 and 8.

.574 pace, which would lead the nation
by 50 percentage points if Garrett had
enough games to qualify.
For both squads, though, the big gun
plays opposite hitter. For Stanford, that
big gun is Ail-American Dave Goss. With
a .361 hitting percentage, Goss averages
7.09 kills-per-game, which is good for
third in the nation.
Mike Diehl, the Bruin's opposite hit
ter, injured his bicep tendon earlier in
the year and missed several season
opening matches. He has come back
from this injury to average 6.20 kills
per-game, which would place him sev

enth in the nation if he had enough
games.
"Goss carries a bigger load than their
opposite," said Cardinal coach Ruben
Nieves. "But Diehl is still their top hitter."
Quarterbacking the teams at setter,
both squads have dominant floor lead
ers. Stanford's playmaker is junior Ail-
American Canyon Ceman, whose pin
point sets make his teammates' lives
much easier. Just yesterday, Ceman was
named 1993 MPSF Player of the Year.
Mike Sealy, the Bruins' setter, gained
All-American honors last year and fol
lowed up with an All-MPSF perfor
mance this season. A jack-of-all-trades,
Sealy turned in an 83-assist, 11-dig, six
block effort against the Cardinal earlier
this year.
"He's having a great year," Nieves
said. "His play might be the single
biggest difference between UCLA of last
year and this year. Last year they were
pretty good but inconsistent. . .. This
year, start to finish, they have been the
top team in the country."
Defensively, the teams excel in differ
ent areas. For UCLA, that area is block
ing. Both in the top-10 nationally in
blocks-per-game, 6-foot-7 Nygaard and
6-foot-10 Kelly set an imposing obstacle
for any enemy hitter. Nygaard led the
country in blocking last year and this
year stands in sixth place with a 1.06
blocks-per-game average.
For the shorter Cardinal, digging is the
defensive key. In every important match,
a different Cardinal player has stepped up
to make an inordinate number of saves.
Both of the squad's swing hitters, Ryan
Moos and Bob Hillman, join Goss in the
MPSF top-10 in digs-per-game.
"I don't think it's realistic for us to
try to match their blocking," Nieves
said. "We have to make up for their
strong blocking by digging a lot of balls."
Stanford and UCLA met last month

in Pauley Pavilion, and the Cardinal left
with a dramatic 5-15, 11-15,15-13,15-6,
15-13 victory. The key to that match
was how the Cardinal handled another
Bruin weapon — their jump serve. In
the first two games, Stanford did not
pass well, which backed them into an 0-
2 corner. The Cardinal's comeback and
eventual win was a result of a vastly
improved passing effort, led by the play
of Moos ofT the bench.
Stanford enters tonight's match with
a slight psychological edge. The last
three times these two have played in sig
nificant matches, the Cardinal has come
away victorious. Last year, Stanford
ended UCLA's season with a 15-10, 15-
9, 15-11 win that sent the Cardinal to
the Final Four.
"Our record against them in the last
three years may be the best in the coun
try," Nieves said.
But the Bruins need only turn back
to the last 20 years, in which UCLA won
13 national championships and had
"something like a 50-1 record against
Stanford", according to Nieves.
Now these two teams stand face-to
face: UCLA, with its tradition of volleyball
dominance, and Stanford, an up-and-com
ing program. Neither likes what they see.
"You get tired of getting beat up by
that team," Nieves said. "And at the
same time they don't like the threat [of
a new volleyball power]. . . . Nobody
would call it a friendly rivalry."
"It will be an intense match," said
UCLA coach A 1 Scates.
Should the Cardinal falter in
tonight's match, it would be seeded into
the MPSF Tournament semifinals at
the Bren Center on Friday With a
win in the semis and a win in the final
on Saturday, the loser of the Stanford-
UCLA match would get the MPSF nom
ination to the NCAA Final Four, to take
place at Pauley Pavilion May 7 and 8.
