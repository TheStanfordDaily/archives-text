# More room for hip-hop, espresso
## Coffee House may be remodeled next year

Tresidder Union's earthy-crunchy, yet un
mistakably hip watering hole might be in line
for a facelift.
Because of its increased popularity, the
Coffee House may be enlarged and remodeled
next year, potentially phasing out the current
Tresidder Recreation Center.
Plans now under consideration would add a
full kitchen, a dance floor and a larger per
forming stage to the establishment, by using
some of the space in the adjacent recreation
center, Tresidder officials said. The recreation
center would be moved to another location on

campus, incorporated as part of the renovated
Coffee House or closed permanently.
The increased popularity of the Coffee
House this year has created the need for more
seating and better kitchen facilities, said
Tresidder Director Bobbi Braden and Associ
ate Director Paul Szczesiul.
Currently, when events like Hip-Hop Night
or Comedy Night are held, or when live music
bands play, the cafe's 130 seats are nowhere
near enough, said Szczesiul. The proposed 3X
pansion would create room for 200 seats.
"The Coffee House is now in a place that
was once a ping-pong table room. It was never
intended for the kind of use it's getting now,"
said Braden.

The recreation center is the only feasible
expansion space in Tresidder Union. The
other unused area in the basement would be
too expensive to convert, Braden added.
A group of student Coffee House employees
and food service employees met Friday with
Braden and Szczesiul to discuss possibilities
for expansion.
Szczesiul said an independent consultant
has been hired and will present several possi
ble plans. A final plan will be chosen by the end
of spring quarter, and construction should
begin in the summer of 1994. The expansion is
expected to cost from $500,000 to $800,000.
In contrast to the Coffee
House's popularity, the recre
ation center's clientele has
decreased steadily during the last
10 years. Revenue from games
has fallen from about $160,000
in 1982 to $40,000 in 1992.
Because of its overhead, the
recreation center is projected to
actually lose money this year,
Szczesiul said.

"We'd like to keep some sem
blance of the center because
there are still people who use it,"
he said, but "we might have to
phase it out altogether."
With a workable kitchen, the
Coffee House would also have
hot food on the menu instead of
serving only sandwiches and
microwaved items, he added.
Increased seating capacity
and a better sound system and
stage would allow the Coffee
House to support more frequent
and varied programming, Szcze
siul said.
