# Casper defends University policies at ASSU meeting
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Addressing the ASSU Senate
last night, University President
Gerhard Casper touched on a mul
titude of issues ranging from the
current draft of the University's
sexual-harassment policy to Dead
Week policy, Asian-American
studies and graduate student
housing.
Responding primarily to previ
ously submitted questions,
Casper seized upon the sexual-ha
rassment policy, discussing it at
length. He reiterated his intention
to have a policy in place by the end
of the school year and defended
the proposal in response to sena
tors' inquiries regarding victim
confidentiality.
"I frankly have not found an
other University policy that has
more confidentiality built into it,"
he said.
But Casper recognized that
questions still exist. "This is a

source of great controversy," he
said. Casper raised the hypotheti
cal situation of how to catch re
peat offenders while guaranteeing
confidentiality. "If we want to
have records, for example, to cap
ture repeat offenders, then I must
warn you that they can be subpoe
naed."
Such a subpoena could under
cut the concept of confidentiality,
making records of sexual harass
ment reports essentially available
to the courts, claimed Casper.
He also warned that the Uni
versity could not invoke a confi
dentiality clause to cover up
crimes. "If there is a crime com
mitted on campus, we are legally
bound to alert the authorities," he
said.
In discussing the issue, Casper
paused to criticize The Daily's cov
erage of the policy's development.
"This is a very difficult subject
that is not summed up accurately
by catchy headlines," Casper said.
"I wish that The Stanford Daily
would discuss real issues rather
than giving them such vague
treatment."
This statement, which drew
applause from the senate, was fol
lowed by a discussion of student
input in the process of developing
the policy.
"The suggestion is now that I
have somehow not engaged the
University in discussion on this
matter," he said.
Attempting to defend himself,
Casper argued that efforts were
made this year to reach out to stu
dents. "We published the policy in
the Campus Report and took out
an ad in The Daily asking for stu
dent input," he said.
According to Casper, the admin
istration received many responses
from students and is taking them
into account in finalizing the pro
posal. However, he did not address
the question of whether adequate

student input had been solicited in
formulating the draft.
Finally, he emphasized that the
issue be dealt with expediently. "It
is I who rescued this issue from
the doldrums of inaction," he said.
"One of the aspects of Stanford
seems to be that discussion on
policies is never closed," he said.
"No action can take place in such
an atmosphere."
Senators also questioned
Casper about the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
and a draft of the University Cab
inet's response to a UCMI review
panel's recommendations on the
report. The draft dealt with issues
of terminology used with regard to
multiculturalism, funding of eth
nic community centers and the
potential for self-segregation
among ethnic communities.
However, he was able to offer
little enlightenment on the cabi
net's draft response because he
said he only received a copy of it
yesterday.
"A copy of a document that I
had not even seen was leaked," he
said, referring to an article pub
lished in Monday's Daily which

drew upon a draft of a University
Cabinet document. Reiterating
earlier sentiments about The
Daily, he issued his displeasure
with the newspaper for using this
source.
"It most certainly must be pos
sible for the Cabinet to discuss
drafts of such documents," he
said. "I am not withholding any
thing from the community â€” we
have not completed our internal
review."
Delving deeper into the issues
of multiculturalism on campus,
senators asked Casper about his
views on diversity.
"I hope that this university
does not lose its commitment to
affirmative action. ... I have
repeatedly made it very clear that
I do believe that a diversity of cul
ture is a wonderful fact of Stan
ford life," he said.
However, he also acknowl
edged the difficulties associated
with a multicultural atmosphere.
"It can create tension between
different groups," he said.

In order to deal with such
problems, he called for "a lot of
serious discussion," pointing out

that we are "a University, not a
political commune."
Turning to an academic angle
of multiculturalism, Casper sug
gested a reconsideration of the
Cultures, Ideas, and Values pro
gram might be in order. "I'm not
so sure that our present civiliza
tion requirement adequately
meets this need," he said.
Casper also responded to a
question about the recent calls for
more classes and a potential
major in Asian-American studies,
but refused to issue his opinion
on the matter.
"I have referred the matter to
the school of Humanities and Sci
ences," he said. "I have referred
the petitions and expect them to
respond."
Outlining the major questions
involved in creating such a pro
gram, Casper pointed to academic
and financial issues. He said that
both need to be considered before
the administration makes any
decisions.
"This comes rather late in the
year," he said. "I would be sur
prised if it were resolved before
the summer."

Turning to more specific
issues, Casper addressed gradu
ate senator Sanford Dickert's
query about graduate housing.
Casper said that "we are utterly
convinced that there exists a
greater need than one or two
years ago."
"We have come to the conclu
sion that some of the undergradu
ate housing projects should be

reconceptualized as graduate
housing," he said.
According to Casper, past deci
sions regarding housing have
favored undergraduates before
graduates. He said he supports a
change to that policy by "pursu
ing graduate and undergraduate
housing in parallel, rather than in
series."
Wrapping up the evening,
Casper addressed a concern that
Dead Week is not taken seriously
by professors and does not repre
sent a lighter load prior to finals,
given that assignments and pro
jects are frequently due during
the week.
"I think the present Dead
Week policy is asinine," he said.
"It does lead you to believe that
there is a Dead Week when there
really isn't one."
Casper outlined two options to
the senate: either admit that
Dead Week is not really dead or
change the current policy.
Though he admitted that such
changes are difficult to enact
under the quarter system, he said
that it is an issue that the Univer
sity should consider.

question about the recent calls for
more classes and a potential
major in Asian-American studies,
but refused to issue his opinion
on the matter.
"I have referred the matter to
the school of Humanities and Sci
ences," he said. "I have referred
the petitions and expect them to
respond."
Outlining the major questions
involved in creating such a pro
gram, Casper pointed to academic
and financial issues. He said that
both need to be considered before
the administration makes any
decisions.
"This comes rather late in the
year," he said. "I would be sur
prised if it were resolved before
the summer."

Turning to more specific
issues, Casper addressed gradu
ate senator Sanford Dickert's
query about graduate housing.
Casper said that "we are utterly
convinced that there exists a
greater need than one or two
years ago."
"We have come to the conclu
sion that some of the undergradu
ate housing projects should be

reconceptualized as graduate
housing," he said.
According to Casper, past deci
sions regarding housing have
favored undergraduates before
graduates. He said he supports a
change to that policy by "pursu
ing graduate and undergraduate
housing in parallel, rather than in
series."
Wrapping up the evening,
Casper addressed a concern that
Dead Week is not taken seriously
by professors and does not repre
sent a lighter load prior to finals,
given that assignments and pro
jects are frequently due during
the week.
"I think the present Dead
Week policy is asinine," he said.
"It does lead you to believe that
there is a Dead Week when there
really isn't one."
Casper outlined two options to
the senate: either admit that
Dead Week is not really dead or
change the current policy.
Though he admitted that such
changes are difficult to enact
under the quarter system, he said
that it is an issue that the Univer
sity should consider.

Addressing the ASSU Senate
last night, University President
Gerhard Casper touched on a mul
titude of issues ranging from the
current draft of the University's
sexual-harassment policy to Dead
Week policy, Asian-American
studies and graduate student
housing.
Responding primarily to previ
ously submitted questions,
Casper seized upon the sexual-ha
rassment policy, discussing it at
length. He reiterated his intention
to have a policy in place by the end
of the school year and defended
the proposal in response to sena
tors' inquiries regarding victim
confidentiality.
"I frankly have not found an
other University policy that has
more confidentiality built into it,"
he said.
But Casper recognized that
questions still exist. "This is a

source of great controversy," he
said. Casper raised the hypotheti
cal situation of how to catch re
peat offenders while guaranteeing
confidentiality. "If we want to
have records, for example, to cap
ture repeat offenders, then I must
warn you that they can be subpoe
naed."
Such a subpoena could under
cut the concept of confidentiality,
making records of sexual harass
ment reports essentially available
to the courts, claimed Casper.
He also warned that the Uni
versity could not invoke a confi
dentiality clause to cover up
crimes. "If there is a crime com
mitted on campus, we are legally
bound to alert the authorities," he
said.
In discussing the issue, Casper
paused to criticize The Daily's cov
erage of the policy's development.
"This is a very difficult subject
that is not summed up accurately
by catchy headlines," Casper said.
"I wish that The Stanford Daily
would discuss real issues rather
than giving them such vague
treatment."
This statement, which drew
applause from the senate, was fol
lowed by a discussion of student
input in the process of developing
the policy.
"The suggestion is now that I
have somehow not engaged the
University in discussion on this
matter," he said.
Attempting to defend himself,
Casper argued that efforts were
made this year to reach out to stu
dents. "We published the policy in
the Campus Report and took out
an ad in The Daily asking for stu
dent input," he said.
According to Casper, the admin
istration received many responses
from students and is taking them
into account in finalizing the pro
posal. However, he did not address
the question of whether adequate

student input had been solicited in
formulating the draft.
Finally, he emphasized that the
issue be dealt with expediently. "It
is I who rescued this issue from
the doldrums of inaction," he said.
"One of the aspects of Stanford
seems to be that discussion on
policies is never closed," he said.
"No action can take place in such
an atmosphere."
Senators also questioned
Casper about the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
and a draft of the University Cab
inet's response to a UCMI review
panel's recommendations on the
report. The draft dealt with issues
of terminology used with regard to
multiculturalism, funding of eth
nic community centers and the
potential for self-segregation
among ethnic communities.
However, he was able to offer
little enlightenment on the cabi
net's draft response because he
said he only received a copy of it
yesterday.
"A copy of a document that I
had not even seen was leaked," he
said, referring to an article pub
lished in Monday's Daily which

drew upon a draft of a University
Cabinet document. Reiterating
earlier sentiments about The
Daily, he issued his displeasure
with the newspaper for using this
source.
"It most certainly must be pos
sible for the Cabinet to discuss
drafts of such documents," he
said. "I am not withholding any
thing from the community â€” we
have not completed our internal
review."
Delving deeper into the issues
of multiculturalism on campus,
senators asked Casper about his
views on diversity.
"I hope that this university
does not lose its commitment to
affirmative action. ... I have
repeatedly made it very clear that
I do believe that a diversity of cul
ture is a wonderful fact of Stan
ford life," he said.
However, he also acknowl
edged the difficulties associated
with a multicultural atmosphere.
"It can create tension between
different groups," he said.

In order to deal with such
problems, he called for "a lot of
serious discussion," pointing out

that we are "a University, not a
political commune."
Turning to an academic angle
of multiculturalism, Casper sug
gested a reconsideration of the
Cultures, Ideas, and Values pro
gram might be in order. "I'm not
so sure that our present civiliza
tion requirement adequately
meets this need," he said.
Casper also responded to a
question about the recent calls for
more classes and a potential
major in Asian-American studies,
but refused to issue his opinion
on the matter.
"I have referred the matter to
the school of Humanities and Sci
ences," he said. "I have referred
the petitions and expect them to
respond."
Outlining the major questions
involved in creating such a pro
gram, Casper pointed to academic
and financial issues. He said that
both need to be considered before
the administration makes any
