# Casper defends University policies at ASSU meeting

### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Addressing the ASSU Senate
last night, University President
Gerhard Casper touched on a mul
titude of issues ranging from the
current draft of the University's
sexual-harassment policy to Dead
Week policy, Asian-American
studies and graduate student
housing.
Responding primarily to previ
ously submitted questions,
Casper seized upon the sexual-ha
rassment policy, discussing it at
length. He reiterated his intention
to have a policy in place by the end
of the school year and defended
the proposal in response to sena
tors' inquiries regarding victim
confidentiality.
"I frankly have not found an
other University policy that has
more confidentiality built into it,"
he said.
But Casper recognized that
questions still exist. "This is a

source of great controversy," he
said. Casper raised the hypotheti
cal situation of how to catch re
peat offenders while guaranteeing
confidentiality. "If we want to
have records, for example, to cap
ture repeat offenders, then I must
warn you that they can be subpoe
naed."
Such a subpoena could under
cut the concept of confidentiality,
making records of sexual harass
ment reports essentially available
to the courts, claimed Casper.
He also warned that the Uni
versity could not invoke a confi
dentiality clause to cover up
crimes. "If there is a crime com
mitted on campus, we are legally
bound to alert the authorities," he
said.
In discussing the issue, Casper
paused to criticize The Daily's cov
erage of the policy's development.
"This is a very difficult subject
that is not summed up accurately
