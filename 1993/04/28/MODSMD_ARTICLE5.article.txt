# Elections may be streamlined
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students may be able to
sidestep election lines next
year and vote on-line instead,
if the ASSU Senate's effort to
cut costs and attract more
voters becomes reality.
While the bill to officially
change the election rules did
not come up for a vote, it re
ceived general approval from
the ASSU Senate.
The proposal, introduced
last night in conjunction with
the ASSU 1993-94 operating
budget, would allow students
to vote at their leisure on any
computer on the University
