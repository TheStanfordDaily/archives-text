# Elections may be streamlined
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students may be able to
sidestep election lines next
year and vote on-line instead,
if the ASSU Senate's effort to
cut costs and attract more
voters becomes reality.
While the bill to officially
change the election rules did
not come up for a vote, it re
ceived general approval from
the ASSU Senate.
The proposal, introduced
last night in conjunction with
the ASSU 1993-94 operating
budget, would allow students
to vote at their leisure on any
computer on the University
network and eliminate the need
for pollwatchers.
Although installing the system
would cost $6,000 this year, it
will "make elections cheaper in
the future," said elections com
missioner Tom Tsao.
In fact, once the system is
changed, it will save the ASSU
$6,500 each year thereafter, Tsao
added.
"What it amounts to is that we
need the money and this is a good
idea," said graduate senator
Brian Flachs, who presented the
budget to the senate.
In addition to financial consid
erations, senators also pointed
out that the modified system
would likely result in increased
voter turnout in general elec
tions. This year's voter turnout
rate declined 5.9 percent from
last year.
Putting the elections on the
network would make elections
both more widely accessible and
less time-consuming.
Although the ASSU budget
was scheduled to pass the senate
last night, the meeting was
adjourned prematurely because
the required quorum of 11 voting
senators was not maintained.
The quorum was lost when

undergraduate senators Mork
Murdock and Anoop Prakash left
the meeting. Prior to their depar
ture, 12 senators were present.
When asked about his exit,
Murdock would only say "We felt
there were things that probably
wouldn't pass tonight but would
pass with a full senate." Though
a quorum existed until he left,
Murdock maintained that "the
people at the meeting weren't
representative of the full sen
ate."
When Murdock and Prakash
left the meeting, the senate was
discussing reinstating the $3,000
salary for the senate chair — one
of the items that would be cut by
the committee on budget and
finance's proposed budget.
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins gave one interpretation
of the duo's departure. "[Mur
dockl is the only person running
for [senate chair] so far," noted
Cousins.
"It looks like Mork knew that
if the quorum was maintained he
wouldn't have a large salary," he
said. "That would be a good rea
son to leave."
Earlier in the meeting, the
senate also finalized the results of
the most recent general election.
In doing this, they broke a tie for
the last two Engineering Gradu
ate seats, choosing Jose Luis
Vamos and Rodrigo Ocejo to fill
the spots.
