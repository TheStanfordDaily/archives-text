# Expiration of patents may deplete research funding
## Profits from FM synthesizer, recombinant DNA to end 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Like so much else at Stanford, research develop
ment funds supported by patent revenues will take a
cut in the next four years, as the University's two
most profitable patents expire within that time, one
in 1994 and the other in 1997.
The U.S. and Japanese patents for the FM synthe
sizer, invented by Music Prof. John Chowning, will
end in the next year. Over the last 16 years, the in
vention has generated millions of dollars for the Uni
versity. Similarly, the School of Medicine will lose
over $1 milUon in yearly income when three patents
for its recombinant DNA technology expire in 1997.
"It will definitely reduce the flexibility to support
research," said Assoc. Dean of Research Pat Devaney.
"We're hoping that some new inventions will develop
and take their place."
While the expiration of the patents will impact spe
cific departments, the loss will be felt most greatly by
the Office of Technology Licensing, which oversees
the licensing and commercial development of Univer
sity research.
The office recovers its expenses and then takes 15
percent of patent royalties as a fee. Included in the of

fice's expenses are its operating costs and budget re
serve contributions.
Another portion of the profits from the patents are
put into a research incentive fund. The remainder of
the patent receipts are divided evenly among the in
ventor, the inventor's academic department and the
department's school.
In recent years, these two lucrative technologies
have comprised 68 percent of the licensing office's
revenues, which were $18 million last year. Now the
office is scrambling to find new sources of revenue.
Impact on departments
The DNA patents, which are half-owned by the
University of California, will have grossed over $170
million by the time they expire, making them the
most lucrative patents in Stanford's history.
However, the effect of most such lost patent royal
ties will be minimized since departments usually do
not budget this money. Kept in a discretionary fund,
the funds are usually used for one-time costs.
"In terms of unrestricted money, [the patents' ex
pirations] are very major," said David Botstein, chair
of the Genetics Department. "But research money is
