# Expiration of patents may deplete research funding
## Profits from FM synthesizer, recombinant DNA to end 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Like so much else at Stanford, research develop
ment funds supported by patent revenues will take a
cut in the next four years, as the University's two
most profitable patents expire within that time, one
in 1994 and the other in 1997.
The U.S. and Japanese patents for the FM synthe
sizer, invented by Music Prof. John Chowning, will
end in the next year. Over the last 16 years, the in
vention has generated millions of dollars for the Uni
versity. Similarly, the School of Medicine will lose
over $1 milUon in yearly income when three patents
for its recombinant DNA technology expire in 1997.
"It will definitely reduce the flexibility to support
research," said Assoc. Dean of Research Pat Devaney.
"We're hoping that some new inventions will develop
and take their place."
While the expiration of the patents will impact spe
cific departments, the loss will be felt most greatly by
the Office of Technology Licensing, which oversees
the licensing and commercial development of Univer
sity research.
The office recovers its expenses and then takes 15
percent of patent royalties as a fee. Included in the of

fice's expenses are its operating costs and budget re
serve contributions.
Another portion of the profits from the patents are
put into a research incentive fund. The remainder of
the patent receipts are divided evenly among the in
ventor, the inventor's academic department and the
department's school.
In recent years, these two lucrative technologies
have comprised 68 percent of the licensing office's
revenues, which were $18 million last year. Now the
office is scrambling to find new sources of revenue.
Impact on departments
The DNA patents, which are half-owned by the
University of California, will have grossed over $170
million by the time they expire, making them the
most lucrative patents in Stanford's history.
However, the effect of most such lost patent royal
ties will be minimized since departments usually do
not budget this money. Kept in a discretionary fund,
the funds are usually used for one-time costs.
"In terms of unrestricted money, [the patents' ex
pirations] are very major," said David Botstein, chair
of the Genetics Department. "But research money is
not the largest volume source of
income within the department.
"I think the stoiy of Joseph in
the Bible is appropriate," Botstein
said. "You save in the seven years
when you live well so that you have
something left for the seven that
you don't."
While the patent revenue has
helped, "the Medical School does
operate on a deficit," said Chief
Financial Officer Peter Van Etten.
But officials have long foreseen the
termination of the patents and are
prepared to deal with it.
"We've already worked on a
plan — approved by (the Board of)
Trustees in June '91 — to get
through it,"he said.

Since research income is so
unpredictable, departments tend
to re-invest it in research or capital.
The Department of Genetics used
their share to renovate and bring
facilities up-to-date.
"We will have to tighten our
belts," Botstein said. "Will it be
more difficult to finance? Yes. Will
it be impossible? No."
WTiile the Medical School seems
likely to weather the financial set
back with relative ease, the Center
for Computer Research on Music
and Acoustics may be hit some
what harder.
"The FM synthesizer was defi
nitely the largest piece of the fund
ing pie," said Assoc. Music Prof.
Chris Chafe, "but we mix and
match sources of funding."
Chafe said the center also
receives funds from sources such
as the National Science Founda

tion, the National Endowment for
the Arts, private donations, teach
ing and garage sales.
But Chafe hopes the center will
continue to generate revenue
through the licensing office with
newer research projects.
Establishing a departmental
endowment may be another solu
tion, said Chafe. The endowment
would need to total at least $10
million for the center to become
self sufficient.
The patenting process
The licensing office handles the
entire patenting process for inven
tions to which Stanford takes title.
This includes all federally funded
and corporate-sponsored projects,
which make up the majority of
research at Stanford.
Research revenues, including
indirect costs but excluding the

work at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center, make up $300 mil
lion of Stanford's annual income,
according to Devaney.
"The [office] is also really good at
finding commercial value for inven
tions," said Dave Plough, a liaison
for groups of Business School alum
nae consultants currently working
for the office. "Often these inven
tions are 10 years from being sold on
the market."
Patents often take eight to 10
years to generate any money, accord
ing to Katherine Ku, the licensing
office's director. At the music center,
the FM synthesizer is experiencing a
boom in its fmal year.
Patents establish the owner
ship of intellectual property, and
the success upon application gives
ownership rights to the Invention
or idea for 17 years. After that
point, the technology becomes free

and common property.
Stanford is unusual from most
other universities in that it gives
the inventor intellectual rights to
the invention even if it was invent
ed on University property or time.
The only exceptions are the above
mentioned cases of government or
corporate sponsorship.
However, in response to the
prospect of the office's impending
funding fall-off, Ku appointed
consultants to analyze the current
situation and construct long-term
strategies. These groups are
proposing changes in Stanford's
lenient policies.
Among the long-term strategies
tentatively expected to be present
ed by the Committee on Research
to the Faculty Senate at the end of
May is a revision of the Universi
ty's patent entitlement policy.
"What we suggest, with the aid of

faculty and administration, is that
the University take over anything
built on University time or equip
ment," Plough said.
Van Etten said that a decision
would not be likely until early next
year. "It would not have a major
immediate financial impact since
most inventions are titled to the
University," he said. "But yes, it
could make a difference in poten
tial patents."
Devaney said the committee
will also tackle the University's
conflict of interest policy; the
group is likely to make a recom
mendation in May as well.
"Right now, faculty are not even
required to disclose all their inven
tions. It is left up to their discre
tion," Devaney said. "Most likely,
there will be a recommendation to
require disclosure and let another
party determine who it belongs to."
