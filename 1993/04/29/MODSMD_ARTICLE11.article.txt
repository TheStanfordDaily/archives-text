Combat ban lifted
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a revolu
tionary change for the U.S. military,
Defense Secretary Les Aspin ordered the
service chiefs yesterday to drop restric
tions on women flying combat missions
and serving aboard most Navy warships.
"The steps we are taking today are
historic," Aspin said at a news confer
ence attended by the chiefs of the Air
Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps.
The policy change means that within
a year, dozens of women could be flying
Navy and Air Force fighter jets and pilot
ing the Army's most lethal attack chop
pers.
Permitting women to serve aboard
warships will require congressional
action. Aspin said he had instructed
Adm. Frank Kelso, the chief of naval
operations, to prepare the groundwork

for a legislative proposal to end this pro
hibition.
Yeltsin still under fire
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin's oppo
nents went on the attack yesterday to
undermine his referendum victory, accus
ing the president of making a secret deal
with the United States to punish Serbia.
Hard-line lawmakers also created a com
mission to investigate allegations of corrup
tion within the Yeltsin administration.
The sniping confirmed predictions that
Sunday's referendum would not end Rus
sia's power struggle, but only intensify it
— at least until Yeltsin can push through
a new constitution.
Fifty-eight percent of those voting
expressed confidence in Yeltsin and 53
percent endorsed his painful economic
reforms.
