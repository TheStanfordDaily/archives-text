# Clinton vows stern Bosnia stance
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Despite
sharp divisions in Congress and qualms
at the Pentagon, President Clinton said
yesterday he is determined to take
tougher action to end the war in Bosnia.
Aides said he probably would decide
on new steps by the week's end.
"I will decide what I think the right
thing to do is, and then see if I can per
suade the Congress and the allies to go
along," Clinton said.
Frustrated by the refusal of Bosnian
Serbs to end a war that has left 134,000
people dead or missing, Clinton is con
sidering air strikes against Serb
artillery sites and exempting Bosnian
Muslims from a United Nations arms
embargo.
"I still believe the United States has
to strengthen its response," the presi
dent told reporters after a Rose Garden
ceremony to name former New York
Police Commissioner Lee Brown to lead
the nation's drug war.
Pentagon leaders doubt that air

strikes would stop Serb aggression. And
there is growing concern in Congress
that the use of American military forces
would get the United States bogged
down in a Vietnam-style conflict with
an large commitment of troops.
Clinton said he heard many different
views from members of Congress about
what he should do. Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., said there was an emerging con
sensus for lifting the arms embargo
because that's "a way to oppose air
strikes and be for something."
Three senior officers nominated for
top posts serving the Joint Chiefs of
Staff expressed deep reservations at a
Senate Armed Services Committee
hearing about an increased U.S. role in
the Balkan conflict.
Lt. Gen. Barry McCaffrey said he
saw "no military solution" to stop the
bioodshed and force the warring fac
tions to the negotiating table.
"I'm really at loss to suggest a decent
military operation," said McCaffrey,

just returned from a trip to the Balkan
region where he accompanied President
Clinton's special envoy, Reginald
Bartholomew.
And Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael E.
Ryan said air strikes alone will not work
without the threat of subsequent mili
tary action. "They will just ride it out,"
he said of the Serbs.
None of the three envisioned allied
air strikes working effectively without
the use of ground forces, and they indi
cated that ending the arms embargo
would fail to achieve any short-term
success.
In Brussels yesterday, NATO military
officials demanded that their political
leaders refrain from calling for air strikes
against Bosnian Serbs unless a long-term
strategy to end the war is devised.
"We need to have the clearest guid
ance on what [the action) is seeking to
achieve," said British Field Marshal
Richard Vincent, NATO's top military
officer.
