## When dry means dry 
### 
All fraternities have to
follow dry rush rules
for the system to work

Fraternity rush has
ended, and hundreds of
young men have just
received bids — in the most ideal
of situations — to the Greek orga
nization of their choice.
This choice will affect their
social lives, friendships and, in
many cases, living arrangements
for the rest of their years at Stan
ford. And yet, the question arises
of whether these choices were
tainted by this year's alleged dry
rush infractions.
This year is the first year Uni
versity fraternities have had a
totally dry rush. The intent was
to send the message that "you
can't buy rushees with alcohol,"
according to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn.
But if the allegations are con
firmed, two fraternities appar
ently did just that during this
year's rush. If they refused to
conform to regulations, they not
only broke University policy and
state law, but also, more impor
tantly, undermined the level play
ing field on which rushees were
supposed to make their judg
ments.
In order to prevent future
occurances of these violations, if
the alleged infractions are con
firmed, the fraternities should
receive strong punishment.
Even if a dry rush is not indica
tive of a fraternity's usual social
functions, it does allow rushees
to make decisions based on the
aspects of the fraternity's mem
bers and atmosphere — qualities
that may otherwise be overshad
owed by the presence of a few
kegs. It is unfortunate that
some fraternities feel so insecure
about their merits — outside of
their ability to serve alcohol to
minors — that they were com

pelled to break rush regulations.
Even worse, if there were rush
violations, it was the fraternities
that played by the rules that lost
out, as one or two groups unfair
ly lured rushees. The fraternities
that did abide by regulations
should be congratulated for their
efforts — hopefully their integri
ty and confidence in their organi
zations, even without alcohol,
were evident to rushees.
Dry rush allowed fraternities
to focus more of their energies on
creative events, such as casino
nights and theme parties, rather
than trying to serve the best and
most alcohol. Rushees could
focus on meeting fraternity mem
bers, without feeling the pressure
to drink in order to improve their
chances of getting a bid.
However, such a regulation
needs to be an all-or-nothing
deal. If even one fraternity does
not adhere to the standard, its
purpose is defeated.
If the alleged infractions prove
to be true, the responsible frater
nities should face severe reper
cussions — not slaps on the wrist
like community service or short
probation periods — to demon
strate the importance of making
dry rush work to serve its aims.
Otherwise, fraternities may as
well return to their original
"wet" rush standards. There is
no point in making a regulation
that only some of the groups will
follow, or that is weakly enforced.
Also, given that sorority rush
has been dry for years without
any problems with infractions,
there seems to be no reason why
fraternities cannot do the same.
Fraternities should frankly
convey to rushees what role alco
hol plays in the organization's
social activities to avoid uncom
fortable situations in the future
caused by mismatched expecta
tions.
However, this can be verbally
expressed, and does not need to
be demonstrated through a bla
tant violation of rules that is
unfair to other fraternities.
