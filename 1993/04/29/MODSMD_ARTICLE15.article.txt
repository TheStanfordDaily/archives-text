Denouncement of Asian-American Studies reveals ignorance

IN HIS LETTER TO The Daily, pub
lished in the April 27 issue, Ramon
H. Myers unjustly dismisses the
rally for Asian-American Studies held
April 19. Furthermore, he evidently
fails to understand the need for Asian-
American Studies.
The rally held April 19 was not "a
cavalcade of political animals," as Myers
would have it. It was peaceful and was
organized as part of a state-wide mobi
lization to raise awareness about Asian-
American Studies at college campuses in
California.
His accusation that rally partici
pants were "unable to articulate their
views in a cool, rational manner" is
unfair and unsubstantiated. For the
past 20 years, Stanford students have
been articulating the need for Asian-
American Studies through University
committees, faculty, alumni and presi
dents, yet with little result. Even now,
a working'group composed of faculty,
staff, alumni and students is drafting a

proposal for how Asian-American stud
ies can be established and budgeted at
Stanford. This plan will be formally
presented to the University in the
coming months.
Nevertheless, the rally was necessary
to move beyond the behind-the-scenes
university process in order to raise
awareness and support from the greater
Stanford community, particularly the
student body. The next day the ASSU
Senate unanimously endorsed the
efforts to establish Asian-American
Studies at Stanford. Still, there is a place
for free speech in the University.
Grounded in the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution is the
right to peaceful assembly and speech.
Myers directly questioned our right to
peaceful, non-violent, public discussion
and indirectly challenged the civil liber
ties of all Americans. If it were not for
the demonstrations of the civil rights
movement of the 19605, Americans
would still be drinking from separate

drinking fountains. As Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Cesar Chavez
proved in their lives, sometimes creative
pressure needs to be exerted in order to
bring about social change.
Additionally, Myers obviously fails to
understand the need for Asian-American
Studies. He openly disclaims the pro
gram as "a great disservice" to the Uni
versity. He believes that Asian-American
Studies does not educate students or
prepare them for becoming "citizens of
the world." Nothing, however, could be
further from the truth. His statement
makes no sense, considering the world is
multi-ethnic, and especially because,
since the time of this nation's establish
ment, America has always had Asian
and Pacific Islander peoples.
The main purpose of ethnic-studies
programs is to educate students about
the issues we all must face in today's
multicultural world. Stanford is becom
ing a 21st century university. Our cur
riculum must prepare us for this.

Since the first Rodney King verdict,
the present situation of ethnic relations
is no theatrics. We must develop Asian-
American Studies to contribute to the
alleviation of societal ills, not merely to
pontificate upon things past. By reject
ing the need for the studies of other peo
ples who have contributed to this coun
try, Myers invalidates the very existence
of minorities as Americans and encour
ages racial intolerance.
In writing his letter to The Daily,
Myers illustrates his ignorance of con
temporary America. He should come
down from the ivory tower of Hoover
and get a taste of reality down here, in
America, before asserting his ill-formed
opinions.
