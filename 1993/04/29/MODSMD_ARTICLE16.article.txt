# Ford's simplification of double jeopardy denies the issue's complexity
## 
### 
It's hard to blame John Ford for
making the points he does in his April
27 column. The issues are timely and
fashionable. The arguments are inter
esting and intelligent.
I just don't happen to think they're
right.
Sell me a bridge in Brooklyn, but I
just don't buy the argument that the
issue of double jeopardy is so simple. If
the courts examining the Rodney King
affair found that the language of the
Fifth Amendment allows the second
trial, how can one proclaim this a
deflowering of the Constitution without
deeper discussion? There arise the

issues of original intent and constitu
tional interpretation, topics worthy of
entire semester classes at a law school.
For someone who seems to imply
that people were too quick to ignore
issues in clamoring for "justice," Ford
is quick to cry foul. For someone
protesting "cosmetic word changes in
the charges," Ford is quick to use
words like "violation" and "Constitu
tion" in the same breath five times in
his 6-inch x 8-inch space. Perhaps at
some point in the future, a court of
appeals will decide that four Los Ange
les police officers' constitutional rights
were violated, but in the meantime,
three or four short paragraphs are not
convincing.
Regardless of opinions on the issue
of double jeopardy, Ford poses the
serious question of whether the Rod
ney King affair sets a dangerous prece
dent. Will every trial yielding an

unpopular verdict be retried through
some technical loophole? The answer
is clearly no. The money to do this
does not exist. The will of prosecutors
to do this is doubtful. And of course,
pressure such as was exerted by the
media, and public sentiment in the
Rodney King trials will not exist in
every trial. The "continued violation of
double jeopardy" will certainly remain
in "America's nightmares" as just
that, a nightmare, a fantasy.
Finally, the issues of the Rodney
King affair have hardly dropped out of
sight. The repercussions still reverber
ate; the tension is far from gone. The
second Rodney King trial has not
engendered complacency. It has taken
and held the global spotlight, and it has
fostered hope.
How has it fostered hope? Consider.
Racism does occur — too often. Use of
excessive force does occur — too often.

Violations of civil rights do occur —
too often. Capturing of such events on
videotape does occur — hardly ever.
This is why there was an uproar over
Rodney King while other incidents
remain real only to the people whom
they affect. How can countless inci
dents which are not videotaped ever
hope to reach "justice" if Rodney King
could not?
Mistakes will and do occur in the
American judicial system. Every now
and then one is particularly gross, par
ticularly egregious, particularly cen
surable. Perhaps the first Rodney King
trial is such a mistake. Is being possible
to rectify such situations, even through
a loophole, the worst of all worlds?
Don't just ask me. Ask the people of the
inner cities.
