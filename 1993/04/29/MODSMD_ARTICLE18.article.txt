## Beyond multiculturalism 
### 
WHEN I WAS LITTLE MY
mother used to tell me
"Kwame, if you are trying to
fix something, and your method isn't
working, try something else."
As we see more and more division of
people on this campus, we have to ask
ourselves is multiculturalism working?
Since I see no evidence to show that it
is effectively dealing with the problems
of race, I say it's time for something
new.
A few years back Stanford was deal
ing with a racial powder keg in its lap.
There were racial incidents, apathy,
isolation and outward hostility. So,
they consulted some "expert"
researchers to find out what was wrong
and why the tensions existed on cam
pus. Somehow, after thousands of sur
veys and interviews, the best they could
say to explain racial tensions was that
"racism stems from ignorance and lack
of exposure."
Feeling that tensions come from
ignorance, they suggested that diversi
ty and exposure would be the key to
battling racism. And out of this logic,
we get multiculturalism.
However, racism is not a result of
what you don't know, it's a result of
what you do know. We have been social
ized by a system that defines American
as being essentially white and middle
class. So no matter how much you try
to multiculturalize the curriculum you

will never be able to deal with the prob
lem.
Looking to multiculturalism to fix
the tensions that exist between various
groups is like thinking that putting a
fresh coat of paint on a dilapidated
house will prevent it from falling down
during an earthquake. Fresh paint
doesn't cure rotten wood. If you want
to solve the problem you have to
destroy the old house and build a new
one.
Now, whenever I say this people
always ask "What about celebrating
diversity and learning about other cul
tures?" The fact that people ask me this
question illustrates the magnitude of
the problem. Multiculturalism has
fooled us into thinking that problems of
race can be solved by all of the colors of
the rainbow smiling and holding hands.
We have to understand that there is a
difference between celebrating cultural
diversity (traditions, folklore, dance,
holidays) and dealing with race as a
social construct and its systemic conse
quences (i.e. plight of urban poor, hate
crimes, disproportionate jail sentenc
ing, etc.)
Also, being a black man who is not
embracing multiculturalism, I am
equated to the conservatives. (I remind
those people that just because Malcolm
X believed in black self-empowerment
doesn't mean he was conservative). I do
have to say that the Stanford Review

and their relentless attack on multicul
turalism is good, because it is able to
offer critique from the outside. But
they end up being just as guilty as the
P.C. police because they go running
around campus looking for classes that,
as they say in a recent issue, "may
offend some Stanford students" The
multiculturalists and the conservatives
are both guilty.
The engineers of multiculturalism
have misdiagnosed the problem, and
the conservatives don't even want to
acknowledge that a problem exists.
Racism, sexism and homophobia are
not a result of men, white people or the
rich. These problems are a result of the
culture-specific system of representa
tions that has consistently negatively
stigmatized non-whites, non-heterosex
uals and the poor and the jobless. We
have to re-examine our current body of
knowledge and begin to see how the
mechanisms within it function to cre
ate pariah groups.
However, to rectify this situation
you can not use multiculturalism. It is
a failing system; and like Mom used to
say, it's time to try something else.

new options and discuss new ideas.
