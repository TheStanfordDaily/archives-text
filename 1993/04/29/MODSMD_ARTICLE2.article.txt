The rushed Rush is officially
over.
A three-week event in the past,
this year's fraternity Rush began
April 12 and ended just two weeks
later, on Saturday. Bids went out
Monday and fraternities received
acceptances yesterday.
Of the 369 men who participat
ed in at least one Rush event, In
terfraternity Council President
Mike Champney said 247 have ac

Alpha Delta Phi picked up the
most pledges with 30. They were
followed by the SAEs and Sigma
Phi Epsilon (28 each); Phi Delta
Theta (23); Kappa Sig and Sigma

(18); Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma
Chi and Theta Xi (15 each); Zeta

Psi (13); Alpha Epsilon Pi (10);
Lambda Phi Epsilon (6); and the
Betas (5). Kappa Alpha received
three pledges and Phi Kappa Psi
received just one.

weeks and banning all alcohol.
Champney said although the
shortened Rush allowed less time
for members to get to know
rushees, he believes the potential
for a two-week Rush is good.
"I think this was a trial period
and it went off pretty well. We're
pretty pleased with the Rush
process," he said.
Groups that used their time
well "managed to have a success
ful Rush," Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Heather Dunn said. Others,
who thought they could simply
condense everything they had
done in three weeks into two
weeks didn't do so well, she
added.
Although the IFC opted to re
strict Rush to two weeks, the Uni
versity imposed another a change
this year — making Rush com
pletely dry.
Last year, Rush was to be offi
