# Rushed Rush ends
## Phi Psi and KAs fare poorly; Alcohol investigation continues 
### Ajai Chari Staff writer 
The rushed Rush is officially
over.
A three-week event in the past,
this year's fraternity Rush began
April 12 and ended just two weeks
later, on Saturday. Bids went out
Monday and fraternities received
acceptances yesterday.
Of the 369 men who participat
ed in at least one Rush event, In
terfraternity Council President
Mike Champney said 247 have ac
cepted bids. Eight housed and
eight unhoused fraternities par
ticipated in the event.
New pledges are down more
than 10 percent since last year,
when 276 men accepted bids.
Rush officials also said they
are still investigating complaints
that two fraternities — Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Kappa Sigma
— violated a no-alcohol Rush pol
icy.
Alpha Delta Phi picked up the
most pledges with 30. They were
followed by the SAEs and Sigma
Phi Epsilon (28 each); Phi Delta
Theta (23); Kappa Sig and Sigma
Nu (19 each); Delta Tau Delta
(18); Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma
Chi and Theta Xi (15 each); Zeta

Psi (13); Alpha Epsilon Pi (10);
Lambda Phi Epsilon (6); and the
Betas (5). Kappa Alpha received
three pledges and Phi Kappa Psi
received just one.
This year's event received
mixed reviews for two innova
tions: shortening the event to two
weeks and banning all alcohol.
Champney said although the
shortened Rush allowed less time
for members to get to know
rushees, he believes the potential
for a two-week Rush is good.
"I think this was a trial period
and it went off pretty well. We're
pretty pleased with the Rush
process," he said.
Groups that used their time
well "managed to have a success
ful Rush," Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser Heather Dunn said. Others,
who thought they could simply
condense everything they had
done in three weeks into two
weeks didn't do so well, she
added.
Although the IFC opted to re
strict Rush to two weeks, the Uni
versity imposed another a change
this year — making Rush com
pletely dry.
Last year, Rush was to be offi
cially dry only from 8 p.m. to 11
p.m., and only on weekdays.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said the University
forced this year's Rush to be dry
because it cannot condone serving
alcohol to freshmen.
Student reaction to the dry
Rush was lukewarm.
"Dry Rush is an oxymoron.
Our alumni can't believe it," said
Kurt Hurtado, the Betas Rush
chair.
Hurtado said that since he's
been at Stanford, Rush has gone
from being "all wet to half wet to
a third wet to all dry." While he
knows "it's the law and it's safe"
and that rushees are predomi
nantly underage freshmen, he
said it is his biggest complaint
about Rush this year.
Another reason Rush was con
densed to two weeks was that the
idea of having three dry weeks
was unappealing to some fraterni
ty members, Dunn said. Champ
ney agreed, saying, "There is a
definite advantage to two week
Rush because it doesn't drag out."
There was apparently some

confusion as to what dry meant
this year, Dunn said. For exam
ple, some thought that at mid
night, alcohol could be served.
"I think most frats have been
abiding in spirit," Hurtado said,
but "obviously, people can be
taken into back rooms" and
offered alcohol.
Last week Kappa Sig and SAE
were accused of violating Univer
sity and fraternity Rush policies
by serving alcohol to minors at
Rush parties.
Howe said the Greek Judicial
Board, which is still investigating
the matter, has received one writ
ten complaint against SAE and
two against Kappa Sig. The com
plaints were made by two IFC
members and a monitor at one of
the fraternities' parties, she said.
The board will determine
whether or not there were viola
tions next week, according to
Dunn.
Champney said no formal com
plaints of Rush alcohol violations
have been made against other fra
ternities.
Since the next IFC meeting
will be held Wednesday, the group
has not yet decided on a course of
action regarding the complaints.
"Right now, we're leaving it up to
the Judicial Board," Champney

said.
With formal Rush over, the
Betas do not have the 34 mem
bers needed to recover their house
at 557 Mayfield. However, the
Row housing office has given the
fraternity another week to try
and pick up more members.
The group had nine old mem
bers and received five new mem
bers after Rush. Twenty more
men have been offered bids but
have not yet accepted. If every one
of these undecided men decided to
accept, the Betas would regain
their house.
Another fraternity that wanted
a significant increase in member
ship was Zeta Psi, which had four
teen bids accepted. The group
began with seven members in the
fall, and eight more joined in an
informal winter Rush, according
to Zeta Psi Rush chair Brad Chinn.
Zeta Psi was hoping for a
strong Rush to re-establish them
selves on campus. The fraternity
had their house revoked five years
ago after disciplinary problems.
Chinn said the two-week Rush
was definitely an advantage
because Zeta Psi did not have the
funds to sustain three weeks of
Rush.
Also, he said, "the sooner you
get Rush over, the better it is."
