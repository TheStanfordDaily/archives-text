## Shasby shines on court despite setbacks 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
It wasn't the best freshman
year of all time.
Kim Shasby spent most of hers
tending to an anterior cruciate
ligament injury, which kept her
off the tennis court for most of
the 1992 season and forced her to
redshirt the year. As if that
wasn't enough, this year she's
been bothered by a nagging foot
muscle strain that kept her on
the sidelines for six-straight
matches.
Of course, a No. 7 national
ranking helps to ease the pain.
"It was a shock — it was real
frustrating not to play," said
Shasby. "But I guess I took it with
a grain of salt. I figured that as a
redshirt, it's not the end of the
world."
Despite her extended stay on

the proverbial disabled list, when
Kim Shasby does step on the
court, the results are impressive.
She advanced all the way to the
final match of the Rolex National
Indoors in February before
falling to teammate Heather Wil
lens, and rang up Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoors singles and dou
bles titles. The singles win came
over No. 5 Alix Creek of Arizona,
in a performance Stanford coach
Frank Brennan called "awe
some."
All this came during a season
marred again by injury, which
makes the rest of the Pac-10 —
and the nation — wonder what
this North Liberty, lowa, native
might do when she's healthy.
"The injury [in 1992] made me
prioritize this year," Shasby said.
"If you're going to be playing,
your body's going to take a beat
ing, so I just try to play my best all

the time."
Unlike most of her teammates,
Shasby said she didn't start play
ing tennis until the "late" age of
nine, and she didn't make it to the
junior nationals until she was 11.
However, once she started, she
competed in the tournament each
year thereafter until college, gar
nering a No. 1 seed more than
once. Talk about a late bloomer.
It was during one of these
junior tournaments that Shasby
visited a certain large university
on the West Coast renowned for
its academics and tennis program.
That's when she knew where she
was headed.
"I stayed in the Suites two or
three nights with my Dad, and he
wanted me to see the whole cam
pus," Shasby remembers. "I came
away from here and just thought,
'That's where I want to play
someday.' "

Shasby took her success in
the juniors to high-school com
petition, where she led lowa
City West High School not only
as lowa's state high-school ten
nis champion, but also as a
member of the volleyball, bas
ketball and swimming teams
during her sophomore and
junior years. As a senior, she
played for Lausanne Collegiate
in Tennessee, where she went
on to become one of the nation's
top recruits.
However, Shasby didn't have
high hopes for being a starter on a
Cardinal squad packed with tal
ent when she arrived at the Farm.
"I didn't expect to play a lot
last year," she said. "I wanted to
compete, but I knew that there
were some good players ahead of
me, so I'd have to wait my
turn."
As it turned out, Shasby's
wait ended up being longer than
she bargained for. A knee injury
suffered early in her first season
at Stanford deferred any plans
of competition for at least a
year, which allowed Shasby to
take a break from tennis for a
while.
"In a way, it helped not playing
that year," Shasby said. "I could
just be a freshman at Stanford
and not have to worry about ten
nis at the same time."
1993, however, was to be the
return of Kim Shasby to collegiate
competition, and compete she did.
Her preseason No. 65 national
ranking jumped to No. 25 by the
end of the 1992 fall campaign, and
from there Shasby's Rolex and
Pac-10 performances vaulted her
into the No. 11 spot, and finally to
her present No. 7 ranking.
"I was surprised to come off
the injury so quickly, and I cer
tainly didn't expect that [No. 7
ranking]," Shasby said. "Some
people deal with the rankings bet
ter than others — if you get
ranked, you have to be confident
of yourself, and I had that confi
dence going in, so it helped."
Shasby has provided solid play
for the Cardinal at the No. 3 sin
gles spot and in the No. 3 doubles
position with sophomore Amy
Chiminello. In the Cardinal's
match against UC-San Diego,
Shasby even had the chance to
step onto Stanford Tennis Stadi
um's center court as the No. 1 sin

gles player.
"I was definitely nervous — it's
a different feeling playing No. 1,"
Shasby said. "But I had a lot of
fun playing in center court."
But 1993 would also bring
another injury. A strained muscle
in Shasby's foot once again forced
her off the court, this time during
the latter half of the Cardinal's
competitive schedule. Her return
to dual-match play against USC
on April 16 was crucial to restor
ing faith in her ability to compete
despite her injuries.
"I really had fun on the L.A.
trip — I'm glad I didn't shy away
from it," Shasby said. "It was
great pulling through even
though I was hurting, and that
gave me confidence in my game."
Now Shasby is finally healthy,
and with any luck, will remain
healthy for the NCAA Champi
onships in May. Her goal is to get
herself mentally and physically
ready for collegiate tennis' pre
mier event.
"It's the first time at the
NCAA's for me," Shasby said. "In
the next two weeks I want to get
out and hit a lot of tennis balls.
Being in singles especially is excit
ing — I try not to think too much
about it. I'll just take it one match
at a time and hopefully let my
confidence build."
For the present, Shasby is
enjoying life on the nation's No. 2
team and the chance to be in the
limelight.
"The team is really tight
knit," she said. "I love competing
on a team — it's nice to be sur
rounded by people that support
you. The girls understand the
trials and tribulations of tennis,
and it's nice to work together
instead of competing against
them.
"I'd like to see myself as a
solid, reliable part of the team,"
Shasby continued. "I've learned
it's frustrating to sit on the side
lines, and I don't think there are
many people that don't learn that.
Now I go into every match with
high expectations, and I'm not
afraid of getting hurt. I don't like
fear."
If her performances so far this
year are any indication, the only
people with fear on their minds
should be her opponents at the
NCAA Championships next
month.

ference Indoors singles and dou
bles titles. The singles win came
over No. 5 Alix Creek of Arizona,
in a performance Stanford coach
Frank Brennan called "awe
some."
All this came during a season
marred again by injury, which
makes the rest of the Pac-10 —
and the nation — wonder what
this North Liberty, lowa, native
might do when she's healthy.
"The injury [in 1992] made me
prioritize this year," Shasby said.
"If you're going to be playing,
your body's going to take a beat
ing, so I just try to play my best all

the time."
Unlike most of her teammates,
Shasby said she didn't start play
ing tennis until the "late" age of
nine, and she didn't make it to the
junior nationals until she was 11.
However, once she started, she
competed in the tournament each
year thereafter until college, gar
nering a No. 1 seed more than
once. Talk about a late bloomer.
It was during one of these
junior tournaments that Shasby
visited a certain large university
on the West Coast renowned for
its academics and tennis program.
That's when she knew where she
was headed.
"I stayed in the Suites two or
three nights with my Dad, and he
wanted me to see the whole cam
pus," Shasby remembers. "I came
away from here and just thought,
'That's where I want to play
someday.' "

Shasby took her success in
the juniors to high-school com
petition, where she led lowa
City West High School not only
as lowa's state high-school ten
nis champion, but also as a
member of the volleyball, bas
ketball and swimming teams
during her sophomore and
junior years. As a senior, she
played for Lausanne Collegiate
in Tennessee, where she went
on to become one of the nation's
top recruits.
However, Shasby didn't have
high hopes for being a starter on a
Cardinal squad packed with tal
ent when she arrived at the Farm.
"I didn't expect to play a lot
last year," she said. "I wanted to
compete, but I knew that there
were some good players ahead of
me, so I'd have to wait my
turn."
As it turned out, Shasby's
wait ended up being longer than
she bargained for. A knee injury
suffered early in her first season
at Stanford deferred any plans
of competition for at least a
year, which allowed Shasby to
take a break from tennis for a
while.
"In a way, it helped not playing
that year," Shasby said. "I could
just be a freshman at Stanford
and not have to worry about ten
nis at the same time."
1993, however, was to be the
return of Kim Shasby to collegiate
competition, and compete she did.
Her preseason No. 65 national
ranking jumped to No. 25 by the
end of the 1992 fall campaign, and
from there Shasby's Rolex and
Pac-10 performances vaulted her
into the No. 11 spot, and finally to
her present No. 7 ranking.
"I was surprised to come off
the injury so quickly, and I cer
tainly didn't expect that [No. 7
ranking]," Shasby said. "Some
people deal with the rankings bet
ter than others — if you get
ranked, you have to be confident
of yourself, and I had that confi
dence going in, so it helped."
Shasby has provided solid play
for the Cardinal at the No. 3 sin
gles spot and in the No. 3 doubles
position with sophomore Amy
Chiminello. In the Cardinal's
match against UC-San Diego,
Shasby even had the chance to
step onto Stanford Tennis Stadi
um's center court as the No. 1 sin

gles player.
"I was definitely nervous — it's
a different feeling playing No. 1,"
Shasby said. "But I had a lot of
fun playing in center court."
But 1993 would also bring
another injury. A strained muscle
in Shasby's foot once again forced
her off the court, this time during
the latter half of the Cardinal's
competitive schedule. Her return
to dual-match play against USC
on April 16 was crucial to restor
ing faith in her ability to compete
despite her injuries.
"I really had fun on the L.A.
trip — I'm glad I didn't shy away
from it," Shasby said. "It was
great pulling through even
though I was hurting, and that
gave me confidence in my game."
Now Shasby is finally healthy,
and with any luck, will remain
healthy for the NCAA Champi
onships in May. Her goal is to get
herself mentally and physically
ready for collegiate tennis' pre
mier event.
"It's the first time at the
NCAA's for me," Shasby said. "In
the next two weeks I want to get
out and hit a lot of tennis balls.
Being in singles especially is excit
ing — I try not to think too much
about it. I'll just take it one match
at a time and hopefully let my
confidence build."
For the present, Shasby is
enjoying life on the nation's No. 2
team and the chance to be in the
limelight.
"The team is really tight
knit," she said. "I love competing
on a team — it's nice to be sur
rounded by people that support
you. The girls understand the
trials and tribulations of tennis,
and it's nice to work together
instead of competing against
them.
"I'd like to see myself as a
solid, reliable part of the team,"
Shasby continued. "I've learned
it's frustrating to sit on the side
lines, and I don't think there are
many people that don't learn that.
Now I go into every match with
high expectations, and I'm not
afraid of getting hurt. I don't like
fear."
If her performances so far this
year are any indication, the only
people with fear on their minds
should be her opponents at the
NCAA Championships next
month.

Redshlrt freshman Kim Shasby has struggled with a foot injury this season, but has still managed to
play No. 3 singles for the Cardinal and snag a No. 7 national ranking.
It wasn't the best freshman
year of all time.
Kim Shasby spent most of hers
tending to an anterior cruciate
ligament injury, which kept her
off the tennis court for most of
the 1992 season and forced her to
redshirt the year. As if that
wasn't enough, this year she's
been bothered by a nagging foot
muscle strain that kept her on
the sidelines for six-straight
matches.
Of course, a No. 7 national
ranking helps to ease the pain.
"It was a shock — it was real
frustrating not to play," said
Shasby. "But I guess I took it with
a grain of salt. I figured that as a
redshirt, it's not the end of the
world."
Despite her extended stay on

the proverbial disabled list, when
Kim Shasby does step on the
court, the results are impressive.
She advanced all the way to the
final match of the Rolex National
Indoors in February before
falling to teammate Heather Wil
lens, and rang up Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoors singles and dou
bles titles. The singles win came
over No. 5 Alix Creek of Arizona,
in a performance Stanford coach
Frank Brennan called "awe
