# Just an average week in the wide world of sports
## 
### 
Remember all those ASSU senators
who promised you ESPN if they
got elected? I know I voted for
them, even though I still think the slo
gan "Milk the Vote" is somehow
strangely pornographic.
Well, it's time to make those favor
currying, resume-packing public "ser
vants" pay up.

With football, bas
ketball, baseball and
hockey all grabbing
the headlines this
week, I want instant
gratification. No
CNN interrupting me
with irrelevant news
from the White
House or Congress —
just the important
stuff, thank vou verv

much. This week has been chock full of
that.
• In perhaps the happiest sports
development of 1993, the Oakland Ath
letics are 5-10 and, joy of joys, in dead
last place. That's right, they're not
even close to first place, they can't even
smell first place, even if the wind is
blowing the right way. Both expansion
teams have won more games. Yes, even
the Indians are better.
• The Detroit Tigers are on a torrid
pace, having won six straight while
outscoring their opponents 45-10 in
the past three games. I think they beat
the A's 55-3. They're in first place in
the American League East, and in
third place in the National Football
Conference Central, just ahead of the
Lions.
• On a sadder note, former New
York Yankee Mark Koenig died last
week. Koenig was the starting short
stop for the 1927 Yankees, a team
many believe was the greatest baseball
team of all time. He was the last sur
viving member of Murderer's Row,
which included greats like Lou Gehrig
and Babe Ruth. Thanks for the memo
ries.
• Draft day for the NFL was Sunday
and Monday, and am I the only one
who can't figure out why Rick Mirer
was the second overall pick? If I'm not
mistaken, isn't this the same guy who
couldn't hit the side of a barn against
Stanford last year? And what about

Gino Toretta? What a kick in the butt
it must have been to go in the seventh
round. I didn't even enter the draft and
/ almost got as much interest.
• Biggest injustice of the 1993 draft:
Dave Garnett, solid inside linebacker
for Stanford, had the ability, had NFL
potential, had impressive numbers
next to Ron George on defense, and

nobody was
interested in
him. Dave, you
deserved better.
• The New
Jersey Devils
were swept out
of the NHL Play
offs by the Pitts
burgh Penguins
Monday. Sigh.
• The NCAA

Women's Tennis Championships are
coming up May 12, and the big ques
tion is: Will Stanford recapture the
title from Florida and return to the
dynasty years of Cardinal tennis? Keys
to a Stanford championship: Kim Shas
by at 100 percent, Kristine Kurth a
consistent winner at No. 4, and doubles
teams ready to win a national champi
onship in the final match.
• Stanford men's baseball — well,
maybe not.
• The Drive For Five might very well
tu~n out to be the Drive For Six. Stan
ford already has four national titles
this year (women's volleyball, men's
swimming, women's swimming and
men's gymnastics) and could conceiv
ably break the collegiate record of five
NCAA titles (held by Stanford and
UCLA) with two more titles from
men's tennis, women's tennis or men's
volleyball. Keep your fingers crossed.
• The Charlotte Hornets are in their
first-ever NBA playoff series, while the
Los Angeles Lakers may be in their
last. Look for Phoenix to capture its
first-ever NBA Championship, and for
Andy Eiser to eat lots of crow.
This week could have left even sea
soned sports fans confused, bothered
and bewildered, but hey, it could have
been worse. Joe Montana could have
come back to the Niners.

Mike McDonough is pushing for an all-
Montana netivork — all Joe, all the time.
