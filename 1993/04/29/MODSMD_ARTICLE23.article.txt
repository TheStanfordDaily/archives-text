# Final Four berth not automatic:
## No. 1 Bruins pound Stanford spikers 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
IRVINE, Calif. - The UCLA men's
volleyball team has been ranked No.l
for 15 of the last 16 weeks of the sea
son.
Last night it showed Stanford why.
In a three-game shellacking, the
Bruins (22-3, 17-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) destroyed the Car
dinal 15-4, 15-7, 15-13 in the MPSF
championship game at Bren Events
Center in Irvine, Calif., thereby guar
anteeing themselves a ticket to the
Final Four next weekend in Los Ange
les.
Now the task for Stanford (18-5, 16-
4) is to defeat Long Beach State tomor
row and the winner of the Cal State-
Northridge vs. Pepperdine match on
Saturday to garner the MPSF nomina
tion for an at-large bid to the Final
Four.
The match started with surprises
from both teams. The Bruins started
senior Dan Landry at opposite in place
of Mike Diehl. Stanford countered by
starting junior Joe Burghardt at mid
dle blocker with John Hribar.
Burghardt, a top hitter for the Cardi
nal last year, has seen limited playing
time this year due to two herniated
discs in his back. Two weeks ago he
suffered a hairline fracture to his
ankle, and expectations were that he
would not play unless needed. But,
according to Stanford coach Ruben
Nieves, Burghardt had a great practice
Tuesday, forcing his way into the line
up.
Behind a heavily-biased crowd, the
Bruins came out on fire. With dominat
ing net play from middle blockers Jeff
Nygaard and Tim Kelly (who combined
for 12 of UCLA's amazing 15 blocks in
the match), UCLA zipped out a 15-4
win against a bewildered Cardinal
team.
In the second game Stanford start
ed out strong, going ahead 2-0, then
4-1 on a Canyon Ceman ace that
glanced off swing hitter Kevin Wong's
cheek. But the Bruins fought back on
a Mike Sealy kill, a Wong block and
two Cardinal net violations to take
the lead 6-5.
After taking a time out, the Cardinal
reverted back to its abysmal play.
UCLA's pounding serves kept Stanford
passers off balance, which resulted in
errant sets and spikes. With the Bruins

ahead 11-6, Nieves sent in freshman
Mike Lambert for beleaguered opposite
hitter Dave Goss, whose two kills in
game one and .105 hitting percentage
on the match were both season lows.
Lambert started out spiking deep,
but then tallied two kills to pull Stan
ford within 12-7.
But the Bruins' net play kept Stan
ford out of striking distance. Two
blocks by Wong put them up 14-7, and
Nygaard ended the game by blasting a
Lambert kill to the Bren Events Center
floor.
Behind the chant "Final Four," the
Bruins took the floor for the third
game. And, for the first 20 minutes of
this final game, the Cardinal continued
to fade. Before the crowd had gotten to
the "Hey, hey, hey" part of the goodbye
chant, Stanford was down 11-2.
Then, after wholesale substitutions
by Nieves, the team of Jimmy Black
man, John Bezmalinovic, Brain Gar
rett, Ryan Moos, Lambert and Goss

almost recreated the events of March
12, when the Cardinal came from two
games down to defeat the Bruins in
Pauley Pavilion.
The comeback attempt started
innocuously enough with a Blackman
kill, his 10th of the year. Then UCLA's
passing fell apart and, like a house of
cards, so did the rest of the Bruins'
game.
Behind strong serving by Moos and
Lambert and a revitalized hitting
attack by Goss, Stanford grabbed the
momentum for the first time on the
night. In the space of five minutes, the
score went from 11-2 to 14-13, as the
Bruins played with the same ineptitude
Stanford had shown in the two previ
ous games.
Lambert and Goss were both ablaze,
and Moos was serving as well as he had
all year. Except for shouts of "Come on
guys, one more point!" the UCLA

crowd was silent, and it seemed
that if Stanford could pull out
game three, the smart money
was on a Cardinal trip to L.A.
But it was not to be.
Moos' serving was halted by
a foot-fault and Lambert's kill
was halted by a Wong block
that brought a flood of Bruin
fans onto the floor and left the
Cardinal players on their knees.
The final statistics tell the
story. As a team, Stanford hit
.145, more than 200 points
below its season average. The

squad had 14 service errors, two
aces and only three blocks.
UCLA, on the other hand, had
15 total blocks and hit .379.
Opposite hitter Landry led all
hitters with 16 kills and a .560
hitting percentage. Wong hit
.381 with 10 kills, four blocks
and three digs.
Even with this hideous out
ing, however, all is not lost for
the Cardinal.
According to Nieves, the team
must build on its promising
third-game play for its next two
matches. UCLA setter Sealy has
no doubts about what the out
comes of those matches will be.
"We'll see them next week [in
the Final Four]," he said.
