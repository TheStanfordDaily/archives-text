Dish a red-light district
Two red lights meant to warn approaching air
craft were stolen from the the Dish last weekend,
and vandals did further damage to the giant radio
telescope.
According to SRI International Senior
Research Engineer Michael Cousins, an unknown
person or persons climbed to the top of the Dish
and stole the red-light fixtures and bulbs. In addi
tion, someone rolled large coils of wire down a hill
near the Dish, damaging a gate at the site.
"This is something that has happened in the
past, repeatedly, over the past 30 years," Cousins
said. "We're talking about thousands of dollars" in
repair costs.
Cousins said the last time the lights were stolen
from the Dish was about a year ago.
