# Faludi questions gains in 'Year of the Woman'

### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
"Backlash does not evaporate
in the 'Year of the Woman'â€”it
goes underground," said Susan
Faludi, authdr of "Backlash: the
undeclared war against American
women" to a standing-room-only
crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last night.
Titled "Backlash after the
'Year of the Woman,' " Faludi's
speech debunked many popular
myths about the progress of
American women in 1992.
Faludi used humor to enliven
her serious message, referring
both to the "Amazonian army" al
leged to have taken over college
campuses and to media remnants
of "lingerie pyrotechnics" to illus
trate the year's backlash against
feminism.
While she sees 1992 as "the
year women broke the sound bar
rier and threw away the etiquette
book," Faludi said she worries
about the media message that
American women have made
tremendous gains.

The message that all is well and
women have nothing left to com
plain about may "tempt women to
slide back into a sleeping beauty
state," Faludi said.
Examining the state of women
from Washington politics to Hol
lywood movies, Faludi went on to
dispel many of the popular myths
that led "the press and politicans
to annoint 1992 The Year of the
Woman.' "
Faludi reminded listeners that
the "unprecendented growth of
women in the Senate" meant that
the number of women senators
grew from two to six, and urged
her audience to be wary of politi
cal complacency.
Turning to media coverage,
Faludi backed up her statement
that "the media is no friend of
women", with a California State
University system study that
'women's stories' comprised only
3 percent of the news in 1992, as
opposed to 10 percent in 1974.
Movies and television were lit
tle better, said Faludi.
Faludi quoted 1992 Best
Actress Academy Award Winner
Emma Thompson as saying "For
women in film it is worse than it
has ever been, except in the
1950'5."
The 1992 movie images of
"women with price tags", and
"ghoulish. . .Fatal Attraction"
female psychopaths are danger
ous signs for women, said Faludi.
Faludi also touched on
"advances" for working mothers

in 1992, noting that one-fourth of
all women who took pregnancy
leave were not rehired and 75 per
cent of working mothers have no
health insurance.
Ending her look at the "Year of
the Woman" with the progress of
reproductive rights, the year's
only marginal advances drove
anti-abortionists to stage increas
ingly violent raids, she said.
The speech was sponsored by
Stanford's Knight Fellows Pro
gram for professional journalists.
As part of the program, Faludi is
spending a year researching and
taking classes at Stanford.
Faludi ended her speech with a

"pretend play-book" for the back
lash media, intended as a guide to
spotting backlash.
Her list of nine tounge-in
cheek rules included tips like
"don't 'et the facts get in the
way," "get personal and mali
cious," and "pretend feminism is
dead."
Feminists, however, should
not lose heart, Faludi said.
Although the single "Year of
the Woman" may not have
undone centuries of oppression,
"the actions of real women show
that feminism is more alive and
spirited than it has been in
decades, " Faludi said.
