## Stephen King on film: pure misery 
### 
Why can't anyone do a Stephen King
film right? The path from the
cornfields to the pet cemetery is
littered with misguided and mishandled
adaptations of King's novels. It's gotten so
bad that his name on a marquee all but
screams "Bad Script. Bad Actors. Bad Direc
tor. Stay Away."
But it wasn't always so.
In 1976, Brian Dc Palma's "Carrie" rein
forced his claim to Alfred Hitchcock's

throne. Sissy Spacek played
the title character, a shy wall
flower tormented by her
mother's religious zealotry

and her schoolmates' callousness. Carrie de
velops telekinesis — the ability to move ob
jects with her mind — and uses it to punish
her enemies.
De Palma wove the typical hopes and
fears of adolescents into a web of Gothic sus
pense. Carrie's classmates get her named
prom queen as part of a vicious prank. As
she goes onstage to accept her crown, De
Palma slows down the action, building inex
orably to the moment when the pranksters
douse our unsuspecting heroine with a
bucket of blood. The revenge she exacts
upon the entire town is one of the most ter
rifying sequences in film history.
Four years after De Pal ma's success, an
other King novel attracted Stanley Kubrick
("2001: A Space Odyssey"). He signed on to
direct "The Shining," with superstar Jack
Nicholson in the lead.
Unsurprisingly, Kubrick's antiseptic vi
sual style was perfectly suited to King's tale
of a man driven to kill his own family by
spirits haunting an isolated, snowed-in
lodge.
One image — Nicholson's sneering face
looming through a door — and one line —
"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,"
— still resonate in the minds of moviegoers
who saw its original release.
Since that brief high point, all adapta
tions of Kings novels have fallen into two

N'Gai Croal

categories. First, the serviceable — i.e.
"Firestarter," "Stand By Me" and "Misery."
These films adequately reproduce many of
the scenes from the source novels. The di
rection and acting are usually competent.
There might even be a decent handful of
frightening moments.
But the images don't sing. The films can't
stand on their own. A quick re-read of the
novels reveal that, no matter how faithful
the adaptation, the filmmakers capture only

an nth of the visceral power
of King's writing. His most
recent film, "The Dark Half,"
falls into this category — it's

competent, but it's no classic.
Still, these films stand head and shoulders
above those in the second category: garbage.
Most Stephen King movies — i.e. "Silver
Bullet," "The Running Man," "Children of
the Corn" and"The Lawnmower Man" —
fall into this category.
Instead of tapping the depths of King's
twisted imagination, the makers of these
films go for excess: more gore, more action
and more special effects. Good acting, writ
ing and direction fall by the wayside in a
crude attempt to strike gold at the box office,
based solely on the name recognition of
King's work.
King himself isn't blameless. He routine
ly sells the rights to his novels without re
taining any creative control. He wrote the
screenplay to "Pet Scmetery," and directed
the stunningly atrocious "Maximum Over
drive." So he can't claim that those evil Hol
lywood executives are destroying his mater
ial — he'd be lying.
The result: I lis and Tinseltown's mutual
greed has severely degraded the value of the
King franchise. No longer can producers at
tract talents like Jack Nicholson, Sissy
Spacek and Stanley Kubrick to his projects.
They're too smart to get sucked into the
cesspool of current King adaptations.
We should wise up, too. That's what
VCR s are for. H
