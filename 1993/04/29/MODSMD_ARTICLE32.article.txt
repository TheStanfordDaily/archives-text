# A 						night of 'revelations' with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater

In its primal dynamism, the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater is unrivaled.
The company's collective voice is so com
pelling that its dances not only move, they
sing.
Formed in 1958, the Alley company has
been widely acclaimed for bringing together
dance, music and the experience of African-
Americans in a way that is accessible to audi
ences of all races. Ailey, a modern dance
choreographer who died in 1989, drew on all
dance forms, but his musical tastes favored
jazz, spirituals and the blues.
Completing its split-week engagement at
UC-Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall this Friday
through Sunday, the Ailey troupe presents a
repertory of both classic revivals and new works.
Last weekend's opening night featured two
stunning examples of the company's commit
ment to exploring social turmoil and to cele
brating ethnicity, humanity and religious faith.
"Shelter," an explosive female drama
about the ravages of homelessness, spills the
reality of its emotional and physical hardships
across the stage. Choreographed in 1988 by
Jawole Willa Jo Zollar for her company,
Urban Bush Women, the work pulses with
raw energy and African-inspired rhythms.
Percussion drums and spoken text ac
company six drably clad women dancers as
they portray the experience of poverty. The
emphatic passages, delivered in a strong and
sober voice, heighten the volatility of their
despair. A line from poet Hattie Gossett's
text, "Between a rock and a hard place, at the
intersection of reduced resources and rever
berating rage," crystalizes their ordeal.
With impressive force and control, the
dancers embody anger and deprivation in
this seamless fusion of modern dance and
African cultural dance. If this weren't an ex
ploration of poverty, it would appear to be a
witch dance; as it is, these women create an

edge so electrifying that the dance sometimes
borders on urgent ritual.
The women are boldly drawn as situa
tional warriors — only occasionally do they
huddle together, vulnerable and defenseless.
This demanding piece propels them into the
air and hurls them to the ground, where they
shake violently from the cold or lament the

lowliness of their lives.
"Living in the
street is so easy, so easy.
It can happen to you,"
says the narrating

voice, transforming the issue into a personal

threat. Zollar's depiction of the
human spirit in dehumanizing cir
cumstances ultimately warns that

the poverty of individuals will sure
ly lead to the poverty of all humanity.

Alvin Ailey's 1960 masterpiece, "Revela-

tions," inspired by his
early religious upbring
ing, captures the passion
of African-American de-

votional music. Ailey used spirituals, gospel
songs and holy blues to create a joyous suite
of dances, as well as a solid portrait of

African-American dignity.
The first section, "Pilgrim of Sor
row," opens with nine dancers costumed

in golden hues, meditatively rising, sinking,
contracting and reaching in a triangular as
sembly. A single man hovers over this group
of eight women, his arms tenderly and cere
moniously unfolding.
There are shades of modern-dance leg
end Martha Graham here, especially in the
weighted lunges, contractions and tautly
stretched arm gestures that enhance the folk
religious theme. The entire piece recalls Gra
ham's powerfully stylized depictions of
American frontier pioneers.
"Take Me to the Water," the middle por
tion, starts as a processional and builds to an
exuberant baptism, "Wading In the Water."

Blue and white strips of sheeting ripple like
water across the stage, while a woman in a
frilled white gown, flourishing a white para
sol, elegantly sweeps and weaves her long
body toward the ceremony.

'Shelter,' ar
explosive female
drama about
the ravages of
homelessness,
spills the reality
of its emotional
and physical
hardships across
the stage.

A contained, restless solo, U I Want To Be
Ready," follows, in which a floor-bound man
exhibits impeccable control in a minimalistic
array of movements. It is a elegant and un
derstated portrait of faith and self-discipline.
The final section, "Move, Members,
Move," captures the joyful spirit of revival
meetings, beginning with "The Day Is Past
and Gone," in which an animated cluster of

women in long frocks and floppy straw hats
energetically fan themselves while perched on
stools. The rousing ensemble finale, "Rocka
My Soul In the Bosom of Abraham," serves as
a tidal wave of ecstatic temperament, utilizing

powerful impulses in the torso, proudly open
gesturing and rolling rhythms.
"Revelations" incorporates humor and

charm with its spiritual motif, but remains
strict in its embrace of traditional values and
devout simplicity. As distinct as the individual

dances are, each one is sown with a sim
ilar hopeful anticipation, derived from
the exhilaration of church activities.
The least remarkable offering, the

Bay Area premiere of Billy Wilson's vivid and
flashy "The Winter in Lisbon," opened the

program. An homage to the
brilliance of Dizzy Gille
spie, the work is set to pieces
of his music written over

the last five decades.
Fast and furious jazz dancing segues into
languid sensuality and back again, with in-

tensely colorful costuming
and chromatic lighting
heaping more spectacle

onto the already ostentatious numbers—com
plete with rising steam. That Wilson is a Broad-

way choreograph
er comes as no par
ticular surprise.
Despite blazing,
supple cast per-

formances, the piece is too saucy a concoc
tion. After experiencing the conceptual
depth and compositional integrity of "Shel
ter" and "Revelations," it's easy to look back
on "Lisbon" as a facile and gratuitous misap
propriation of company talents. ■
