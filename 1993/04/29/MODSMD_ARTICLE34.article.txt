Busted equipment. Ballistic tem
pers. Ballooning budgets.
Beastly storms.
The dangers lurking for student film
makers abound. But so do the rewards.
Witness Matthew Irving, who directed
an atmospheric, three minute black-and
white piece called "The Author" at last
summer's Stanford Mass Media Institute.
Hands thrust out before him, Irving
giddily describes the piece's climactic
sequence, the product of hours of shooting
and careful editing. In the scene, the music
reaches its highest crescendo right as the
title character throws his manuscript up
into the air over a windswept landscape.
"When something works there's noth
ing like that," he says. "That's worth all the
frustrations."
But Stanford's student directors must
hurdle a slew of obstacles to reach those
epiphanies.
During one night of shooting in
the woods with a generator and
3,000 watts of rented lights,
"Phobia" director Eric Manchester had to
coordinate one actor driving a truck on
the road, another actor running through
the forest and crew members speaking
through walkie-talkies.
"I had to time the shot so the actor
would come out of the woods and see the
headlights of the truck right after he
emerges from the woods," says Manchester,
who graduated winter quarter.
"I brought a sleeping bag to cover the
generator so it wouldn't make so much
noise. But someone put the bag over the
lights. At one point the walkie talkies
didn't work. It started to drizzle, and my
sleeping bag was melting on the light.
Nothing was working, the guy was out of
the woods and the truck wouldn't go."
Irving, another early graduate, took the
money he had saved for spring tuition and
sunk it into filming his 20-minute screen
play "Leaves." "Fate," he says, "has been
conspiring against us in the entire shoot."
Rain delayed important filming in
Livermore, and two days after Irving shot
a scene in a field of windmills, a small
plane crashed into the middle of the
rolling hills.
But the lively and imperturbable direc
tor, who eventually snagged the shots he
needed, sports a history of resourcefulness.
As a young child, Irving and his
brother shot Super 8 films while running
around the yard shooting guns, adding
thick laser blasts with red pens afterwards.
At age 14 he hand drew two 30-minute
animated films. "When I get into a bind,"
he says smiling, "I think, 'Hell, if I could
do that I can do anything.' "
While directing a docudrama at a
Parisian film school, senior
Birgitte Estelle learned how to
curse fluently in French — when her assis
tant director accidentally erased three pre
vious takes.
"I just blew my top," she says. "There
was a big scene, and the assistant director
said, 'Fine, I'm leaving.' It was really upset
ting — we were close to finishing. I got my
senses back together and told him, 'You're
going to finish this with me.' "
The two are now best friends.
"It was proof to me that I could go
overseas not knowing anyone and get
together a crew of people and shoot and
complete a goddamn film," Estelle says."It
was easily the most incredibly exhilarating
feeling you could ever imagine."

She adds, "You have to be able to
make split-second decisions One time
we shot an entire scene, and let the actors
go home, and then figured out the camera
didn't actually record anything.
"Even if you make a mistake you can't
let the crew know about it."
Being able to hold the results of the
director's effort — to touch the film itself
— ft is something so satisfying," Estelle
says. "It's a basic primal instinct."
During last summer's Stanford
Mass Media Institute, students
conceived and produced their
own short black-and-white project, collab
orating on each others' films during brief
and hectic weekend shoots.
Many of the student filmmakers copped
a guerrilla attitude toward their work, trying
to make the best of what they had.
"The equipment was just archaic,"
says senior Ayanna Bennett. "These little
cast iron cameras are from before World
War 11. You can't even see by looking
through the viewfinder if your image is in
focus or not. You have to rtieasure the light
and measure the distance between the
subject and the camera."
Her hilarious "Turning Tables" features
two women objectifying all the men who
walk by — much to the objects' chagrin.
Bennett, who edited a SWOPSI mini
documentary on black male-female rela
tions at Stanford and spent a year at
Howard University studying TV and film,
acknowledges the filmmakers' toil often
goes unappreciated.
"No one else was as impressed with the
films as we film students, because we knew
how long it took to put those images togeth
er — especially making the sound go with it.
If somebody got a sound just right with the
image it was going to, we were like, 'YES!' "
For the summer program, Estelle
crafted a gripping, highly stylized film of
an Arabian man who dies in the desert —
actually filmed in the searing heat of near
by San Gregorio beach.
During the final edit of "Fata Morgana"
she slaved seven straight days in the
Communication Department's basement.
"That to me was the final test at that point to
see if I am fit for the industry," says Estelle,
who also produced and edited the 1991
Stanford Video Yearbook. "I'm staying in it."
Junior Carl Sandler's sensually lavish
"Image In Image Out" explored the rela-

tionship between bodybuilding and
pornography. "I don't think directing style
is important these days," says Sandler, who
recently finished a 21-minute safe-sex
erotic video for a contest sponsored by the
San Francisco Aids Foundation. "Almost
anyone can direct a film. What distin
guishes people is their intelligence and
how they say things."
While it may be true that cameras can
pop up in almost any hand, only the most
innovative directors can emulate low-bud
get miracle makers such as Richard
Rodriguez, director of the $7,000 critical
hit "El Mariachi."
At age 19, TV producer Michael Wiese
directed a film that landed a spot in the
Cannes Film Festival. His work ran 28
minutes, and boasted elaborate sets and
special effects. All for just $800.
How? He pleaded free film from the
local TV studio and created all the sets out
of one roll of butcher paper. "We crinkled
it up in different ways, lit it creatively, pro
jected images on it,"says Wiese, 45.
He now owns a company that pub
lishes how-to books on filmmaking, one
of which, "Film Directing: Shot by Shot,"
is a staple of Stanford's film production
classes. A member of the San Francisco
Art Institute's first graduating class, Wiese
worked on a $5,000 gem that has grossed
half a million dollars worldwide —
"Hardware Wars."
"We made that as kind of a joke to
meet George Lucas," Wiese says."I learned
a lot about marketing because we picked
one of the hottest films at the time."
The cult film's creators employed card
board to create spaceships and sets. "The
good news about having no money is that
it forces you to be creative," Wiese says.
Although Stanford's narrative
film reputation does not equal
that of such noted film schools
as USC, UCLA and NYU, the University's
Documentary Film Program has earned
numerous Student Academy Awards.
"At a place like Stanford ... we are not
at a great situation to do fiction but an
ideal one to do documentaries,"
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose
says. "On virtually any subject, there is
probably a world-renowned authority
within 10 minutes' walk."
Still, third-year Documentary Film
graduate student Signe Taylor didn't stroll

over to the Quad to research her film.
Instead she spent 32 days in Iraq, docu
menting the effects of the Gulf War and
the economic embargo on citizens. After
hurdling numerous obstacles presented by
the Iraqi government, she spent a week
with each of three families.
"It was the most circumscribed cir
cumstance I ever filmed under," she says.
"But once I got beyond the government,
the people were very open and friendly."
Now she must carve 32 hours of
footage into a half-hour video for a June
completion date. "It's hard," she says. "It's
not real clear what makes things work."
Public TV and cable channels offer fer
tile fields for documentaries, whose cheap
er costs attract students, Breitrose says.
He warns, "If you are making a docu
mentary, you always earn less than your
lawyer. It's something you do because you
have a calling, almost."
Stanford filmmakers don't labor
under the illusion that they'll
immediately burst onto the movie
scene and pile up millions in box office
receipts. But they are trying to find some sta
bility in a topsy-turvy industry.
Hollywood's conventional wisdom dif
fers over film school, which many champi
on as offering a critical contact network.
But film schools "perpetuate the illu
sion that we're going to teach the students
everything they need — and they fail mis
erably," Wiese says. "Students might know
how to make a film but not necessarily
create anything marketable."
He recommends students "find a job
— any job — that will get you close to the
industry, and learn like a sponge."
Manchester agrees. "I think the
money I could spend on film school I
would rather use to make a movie," he
says. His 67-minute stunt-laden "Phobia"
screens May 21 in Kresge Auditorium.
Amassing industry contacts and flesh
ing out resumes, students have perspired
for a diverse group of filmmakers.
Manchester worked on the set of
Penny Marshall's "A League of Their Own"
as a video assist — a position he landed
through a relative without an in-person
interview. In fall 1991, Irving interned at
Industrial Light and Magic, George Lucas'
visual effects factory.
Bennett, who wants to direct, write and
perhaps adapt some works of best-selling
African-American authors Terry McMillan
or Toni Morrison, says she's established
contacts with black women working in the
industry. "There are so few movies that say
anything about black women that I could
spend the rest of my life making movies
just telling different things, illustrating dif
ferent events in the lives of African-
American women," she says.
Estelle has already conducted 14 inter
views in Los Angeles. "Coming into the
film industry is like learning to walk the
tightrope with your eyes closed," she says.
"There is no stability, no guarantees."
She adds, "The difference between
minority and majority in Hollywood is that
if a woman or minority person has their first
film flop, they don't get another chance."
But the industry's harsh realities haven't
daunted their optimism. Irving, who was
recently accepted to the USC film school and
is currently tinkering with five screenplays,
looks forward to the day when he can relish
the anonymous success accorded the director.
"I'd love to be able to walk into a the
ater, buy a ticket and enjoy my film with a
crowd of people." ■

receipts. But they are trying to find some sta
bility in a topsy-turvy industry.
Hollywood's conventional wisdom dif

on as offering a critical contact network.
But film schools "perpetuate the illu
sion that we're going to teach the students
everything they need — and they fail mis

how to make a film but not necessarily
create anything marketable."
He recommends students "find a job
— any job — that will get you close to the
industry, and learn like a sponge."
Manchester agrees. "I think the
money I could spend on film school I
would rather use to make a movie," he
says. His 67-minute stunt-laden "Phobia"
screens May 21 in Kresge Auditorium.
Amassing industry contacts and flesh
ing out resumes, students have perspired
for a diverse group of filmmakers.
Manchester worked on the set of
Penny Marshall's "A League of Their Own"
as a video assist — a position he landed
through a relative without an in-person
interview. In fall 1991, Irving interned at
Industrial Light and Magic, George Lucas'
visual effects factory.
Bennett, who wants to direct, write and
perhaps adapt some works of best-selling
African-American authors Terry McMillan
or Toni Morrison, says she's established
contacts with black women working in the
industry. "There are so few movies that say
anything about black women that I could
spend the rest of my life making movies
just telling different things, illustrating dif
ferent events in the lives of African-
American women," she says.
Estelle has already conducted 14 inter
views in Los Angeles. "Coming into the
film industry is like learning to walk the
tightrope with your eyes closed," she says.
"There is no stability, no guarantees."
She adds, "The difference between
minority and majority in Hollywood is that
if a woman or minority person has their first
film flop, they don't get another chance."
But the industry's harsh realities haven't
daunted their optimism. Irving, who was
recently accepted to the USC film school and
is currently tinkering with five screenplays,

Busted equipment. Ballistic tem
pers. Ballooning budgets.
Beastly storms.
The dangers lurking for student film
makers abound. But so do the rewards.
Witness Matthew Irving, who directed
an atmospheric, three minute black-and
white piece called "The Author" at last
summer's Stanford Mass Media Institute.
Hands thrust out before him, Irving
giddily describes the piece's climactic
sequence, the product of hours of shooting
and careful editing. In the scene, the music
reaches its highest crescendo right as the
title character throws his manuscript up
into the air over a windswept landscape.
"When something works there's noth
ing like that," he says. "That's worth all the
frustrations."
But Stanford's student directors must
hurdle a slew of obstacles to reach those
epiphanies.
During one night of shooting in
the woods with a generator and
3,000 watts of rented lights,
"Phobia" director Eric Manchester had to
coordinate one actor driving a truck on
the road, another actor running through
the forest and crew members speaking
through walkie-talkies.
"I had to time the shot so the actor
would come out of the woods and see the
headlights of the truck right after he
emerges from the woods," says Manchester,
who graduated winter quarter.
"I brought a sleeping bag to cover the
generator so it wouldn't make so much
noise. But someone put the bag over the
lights. At one point the walkie talkies
didn't work. It started to drizzle, and my
sleeping bag was melting on the light.
Nothing was working, the guy was out of
the woods and the truck wouldn't go."
Irving, another early graduate, took the
money he had saved for spring tuition and
sunk it into filming his 20-minute screen
play "Leaves." "Fate," he says, "has been
conspiring against us in the entire shoot."
Rain delayed important filming in
Livermore, and two days after Irving shot
a scene in a field of windmills, a small
plane crashed into the middle of the
rolling hills.
But the lively and imperturbable direc
tor, who eventually snagged the shots he
needed, sports a history of resourcefulness.
As a young child, Irving and his
brother shot Super 8 films while running
around the yard shooting guns, adding
thick laser blasts with red pens afterwards.
At age 14 he hand drew two 30-minute
animated films. "When I get into a bind,"
he says smiling, "I think, 'Hell, if I could
do that I can do anything.' "
While directing a docudrama at a
Parisian film school, senior
Birgitte Estelle learned how to
curse fluently in French — when her assis
tant director accidentally erased three pre
vious takes.
"I just blew my top," she says. "There
was a big scene, and the assistant director
said, 'Fine, I'm leaving.' It was really upset
ting — we were close to finishing. I got my
senses back together and told him, 'You're
going to finish this with me.' "
The two are now best friends.
"It was proof to me that I could go
overseas not knowing anyone and get
together a crew of people and shoot and
complete a goddamn film," Estelle says."It
was easily the most incredibly exhilarating
feeling you could ever imagine."

She adds, "You have to be able to
make split-second decisions One time
we shot an entire scene, and let the actors
go home, and then figured out the camera
didn't actually record anything.
"Even if you make a mistake you can't
let the crew know about it."
Being able to hold the results of the
director's effort — to touch the film itself
— ft is something so satisfying," Estelle
says. "It's a basic primal instinct."
During last summer's Stanford
Mass Media Institute, students
conceived and produced their
own short black-and-white project, collab
orating on each others' films during brief
and hectic weekend shoots.
Many of the student filmmakers copped
a guerrilla attitude toward their work, trying
to make the best of what they had.
"The equipment was just archaic,"
says senior Ayanna Bennett. "These little
cast iron cameras are from before World
War 11. You can't even see by looking
through the viewfinder if your image is in
focus or not. You have to rtieasure the light
and measure the distance between the
subject and the camera."
Her hilarious "Turning Tables" features
two women objectifying all the men who
walk by — much to the objects' chagrin.
Bennett, who edited a SWOPSI mini
documentary on black male-female rela
tions at Stanford and spent a year at
Howard University studying TV and film,
acknowledges the filmmakers' toil often
goes unappreciated.
"No one else was as impressed with the
films as we film students, because we knew
how long it took to put those images togeth
er — especially making the sound go with it.
If somebody got a sound just right with the
image it was going to, we were like, 'YES!' "
For the summer program, Estelle
crafted a gripping, highly stylized film of
an Arabian man who dies in the desert —
actually filmed in the searing heat of near
by San Gregorio beach.
During the final edit of "Fata Morgana"
she slaved seven straight days in the
Communication Department's basement.
"That to me was the final test at that point to
see if I am fit for the industry," says Estelle,
who also produced and edited the 1991
Stanford Video Yearbook. "I'm staying in it."
Junior Carl Sandler's sensually lavish
"Image In Image Out" explored the rela-

tionship between bodybuilding and
pornography. "I don't think directing style
is important these days," says Sandler, who
recently finished a 21-minute safe-sex
erotic video for a contest sponsored by the
San Francisco Aids Foundation. "Almost
anyone can direct a film. What distin
guishes people is their intelligence and
how they say things."
While it may be true that cameras can
pop up in almost any hand, only the most
innovative directors can emulate low-bud
get miracle makers such as Richard
Rodriguez, director of the $7,000 critical
hit "El Mariachi."
At age 19, TV producer Michael Wiese
directed a film that landed a spot in the
Cannes Film Festival. His work ran 28
minutes, and boasted elaborate sets and
special effects. All for just $800.
How? He pleaded free film from the
local TV studio and created all the sets out
of one roll of butcher paper. "We crinkled
it up in different ways, lit it creatively, pro
jected images on it,"says Wiese, 45.
He now owns a company that pub
lishes how-to books on filmmaking, one
of which, "Film Directing: Shot by Shot,"
is a staple of Stanford's film production
classes. A member of the San Francisco
Art Institute's first graduating class, Wiese
worked on a $5,000 gem that has grossed
half a million dollars worldwide —
"Hardware Wars."
"We made that as kind of a joke to
meet George Lucas," Wiese says."I learned
a lot about marketing because we picked
one of the hottest films at the time."
The cult film's creators employed card
board to create spaceships and sets. "The
good news about having no money is that
it forces you to be creative," Wiese says.
Although Stanford's narrative
film reputation does not equal
that of such noted film schools
as USC, UCLA and NYU, the University's
Documentary Film Program has earned
numerous Student Academy Awards.
"At a place like Stanford ... we are not
at a great situation to do fiction but an
ideal one to do documentaries,"
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose
says. "On virtually any subject, there is
probably a world-renowned authority
within 10 minutes' walk."
Still, third-year Documentary Film
graduate student Signe Taylor didn't stroll

over to the Quad to research her film.
Instead she spent 32 days in Iraq, docu
menting the effects of the Gulf War and
the economic embargo on citizens. After
hurdling numerous obstacles presented by
the Iraqi government, she spent a week
with each of three families.
"It was the most circumscribed cir
cumstance I ever filmed under," she says.
"But once I got beyond the government,
the people were very open and friendly."
Now she must carve 32 hours of
footage into a half-hour video for a June
completion date. "It's hard," she says. "It's
not real clear what makes things work."
Public TV and cable channels offer fer
tile fields for documentaries, whose cheap
er costs attract students, Breitrose says.
He warns, "If you are making a docu
mentary, you always earn less than your
lawyer. It's something you do because you
have a calling, almost."
Stanford filmmakers don't labor
under the illusion that they'll
immediately burst onto the movie
scene and pile up millions in box office
receipts. But they are trying to find some sta
bility in a topsy-turvy industry.

it up in different ways, lit it creatively, pro
jected images on it,"says Wiese, 45.
He now owns a company that pub
lishes how-to books on filmmaking, one
of which, "Film Directing: Shot by Shot,"
is a staple of Stanford's film production
classes. A member of the San Francisco
Art Institute's first graduating class, Wiese
worked on a $5,000 gem that has grossed
half a million dollars worldwide —
"Hardware Wars."
"We made that as kind of a joke to
meet George Lucas," Wiese says."I learned
a lot about marketing because we picked
one of the hottest films at the time."
The cult film's creators employed card
board to create spaceships and sets. "The
good news about having no money is that
it forces you to be creative," Wiese says.
Although Stanford's narrative
film reputation does not equal
that of such noted film schools
as USC, UCLA and NYU, the University's
Documentary Film Program has earned
numerous Student Academy Awards.
"At a place like Stanford ... we are not
at a great situation to do fiction but an
ideal one to do documentaries,"
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose
says. "On virtually any subject, there is
probably a world-renowned authority
within 10 minutes' walk."
Still, third-year Documentary Film
graduate student Signe Taylor didn't stroll

over to the Quad to research her film.
Instead she spent 32 days in Iraq, docu
menting the effects of the Gulf War and
the economic embargo on citizens. After
hurdling numerous obstacles presented by
the Iraqi government, she spent a week
with each of three families.
"It was the most circumscribed cir
cumstance I ever filmed under," she says.
"But once I got beyond the government,
the people were very open and friendly."
Now she must carve 32 hours of
footage into a half-hour video for a June
completion date. "It's hard," she says. "It's
not real clear what makes things work."
Public TV and cable channels offer fer
tile fields for documentaries, whose cheap
er costs attract students, Breitrose says.
He warns, "If you are making a docu
mentary, you always earn less than your
lawyer. It's something you do because you
have a calling, almost."
Stanford filmmakers don't labor
under the illusion that they'll
immediately burst onto the movie
scene and pile up millions in box office
receipts. But they are trying to find some sta
bility in a topsy-turvy industry.
Hollywood's conventional wisdom dif
fers over film school, which many champi
on as offering a critical contact network.
But film schools "perpetuate the illu
sion that we're going to teach the students
everything they need — and they fail mis
erably," Wiese says. "Students might know
how to make a film but not necessarily
create anything marketable."
He recommends students "find a job
— any job — that will get you close to the
industry, and learn like a sponge."
Manchester agrees. "I think the
money I could spend on film school I
would rather use to make a movie," he
says. His 67-minute stunt-laden "Phobia"
screens May 21 in Kresge Auditorium.
Amassing industry contacts and flesh
ing out resumes, students have perspired
for a diverse group of filmmakers.
Manchester worked on the set of
Penny Marshall's "A League of Their Own"
as a video assist — a position he landed
through a relative without an in-person
interview. In fall 1991, Irving interned at
Industrial Light and Magic, George Lucas'
visual effects factory.
Bennett, who wants to direct, write and
perhaps adapt some works of best-selling
African-American authors Terry McMillan
or Toni Morrison, says she's established
contacts with black women working in the
industry. "There are so few movies that say
anything about black women that I could
spend the rest of my life making movies
just telling different things, illustrating dif
ferent events in the lives of African-
American women," she says.
Estelle has already conducted 14 inter
views in Los Angeles. "Coming into the
film industry is like learning to walk the
tightrope with your eyes closed," she says.
"There is no stability, no guarantees."
She adds, "The difference between
minority and majority in Hollywood is that
if a woman or minority person has their first
film flop, they don't get another chance."
But the industry's harsh realities haven't
daunted their optimism. Irving, who was
recently accepted to the USC film school and
is currently tinkering with five screenplays,
looks forward to the day when he can relish
the anonymous success accorded the director.
"I'd love to be able to walk into a the
ater, buy a ticket and enjoy my film with a
crowd of people." ■
