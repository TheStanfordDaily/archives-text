Tobias Wolff's story
of slow, subtle abuse
will make you think

This Boy's Life

Caroline Wolff (Ellen Barkin) has a twisted
way of dealing with her problems — she leaves
them behind.
Unfortunately, she drags her adolescent son
Toby (Leonardo DiCaprio) with her as she
runs from each problem. When she decides
that she can no longer escape, she opts for a life
of disillusionment and abuse at the hands
Dwight Hansen (Robert De Niro), a classless
man with a violent nature.
Thus begins Tobias Wolffs powerfully
compelling autobiography, passionately
brought to the screen in director Michael
Caton-Jones latest film, "This Boy's Life."
Wolff s story isn't about extreme hardship
nor extraordinary courage. Rather, it vividly il
lustrates the effects of slow, subtle abuse (phys
ical, verbal, psychological) and a long series of
minor failures. Intolerant of anyone who
might challenge him, Dwight takes his frustra
tions out on his family. Caroline, unable to
make a good life for herself and her son, even
tually loses her emotional identity. Toby,
struggling; to grow up in world without hope,
becomes a delinquent.
Excellent performances, along with won
derfully unquotable lower-class vernacular
and artful direction, produce a movie that si

multaneously inspires rage and compassion.
DiCaprio carries the movie by delivering a
remarkable performance, juxtaposing con
flicting emotions with spirited moodiness.
Barkin conveys a feeling of disillusionment
with pointed realism. De Niro portrays the
redneck Dwight with just the right amounts of
ignorance, arrogance and brutality.
"This Boy's Life" is set in a small Pacific
Northwest town during the late '50s to early
'60s. The happy soundtrack, a generous supply
of "all is well in the world" period music, pro
vides an interesting contrast to the desperation
portrayed by the actors. Production designer
Stephen Lineweaver works well within the
tight sets, giving the whole movie a kind of
closed-in, no-escape type of mood. Most of the
scenes take place in small spaces — dingy little
rooms or rickety old cars.
If "This Boy's Life" falls short of excellence
in any way, it is in the film's treatment socially
relevant issues. In one of the movie's funniest
scenes, Toby accuses a classmate, Arthur Gayle
(Jonah Blechman), of being a homosexual.
This leads to a fight in which Arthur, aided by

his cute little dog Pepper, makes Toby take
back his accusation. What is disturbing about
this sequence, however, is that the images of
Pepper joining in the fight are so funny that
you miss the statement.
If you have survived a less than idyllic child
hood, you'll understand Toby. If not, you'll
admire Toby's spirit. Either way, "This Boy's
Life" will leave you thinking.

In-your-face gang
violence and urban
drama fuel this flick

Bound by Honor

"Bound by Honor" s in-your-face reality
of the brutal and tragic aspects of gang vio
lence makes clear that director Taylor Hack
ford meant the urban drama to be a Chicano

version of "Boyz N the Hood."
While the film forces upon the viewer
more vivid images of violence and drugs
than the best TV reality shows supply,
"Bound by Honor" falls short in its attempts
to counteract the shock value of testos
terone-loaded bloodshed with the psycho
logical impact of gang life.
The plot plunges right into a dizzying
chain of separate-yet-related events that are
all supposed to be connected to a gang-fight
murder.
However, the storyline launches into di
verging directions, relating the separate lives
of relatives/best buddies/gang members
Mildo, Cruz and Paco before setting up a basis
for their friendship. This disjointed set-up
gives the viewer little to substantiate the main
characters' intense bonds with each other.
Because the movie's key relationship suf
fers from lack of development,-"Bound by
Honor" fights a losing battle from the begin
ning. Ultimately, it only perpetuates stereo
types of Chicanos and gang members, and
the story tells more of unbridled machismo
than of brotherhood and the human side of
gangs.
While Jesse Borrego (Cruz) and Benjamin
Bratt (Paco) give adequate performances,
Damian Chapa (Miklo) — a blond, blue
eyed half Chicano — has an annoyingly de
liberate Mexican accent reminiscent of
Speedy G )nzales.
But evi n more annoying than Chapa's ac
cent are the occasional subtides used for
English lines that happen to be spoken with a
slightly thicker accent. Nothing like letting
the viewer grasp the subtleties of Chicano
gang culture.
Despite the presence of renowned poet
Jimmy Santiago Baca on the screenwriting
team, the film's lack of flow and emotional
impact reflects little poetic influence.
What Baca does contribute, however, is
his insight on the intricacies and brutalities
of jail culture. Miklo spends the majority of
his life in San Quentin, where he becomes
intrinsically and irreversibly tied to its Chi
cano jail culture. These scenes are the film's
most thought-provoking and hard-hitting,
reflecting Baca's own experiences in jail,
where he learned to read and write.
Given the constant depictions of impale
ment by switchblades, butterfly knives,
heroine needles, picks, probes and even a
comb, the movie's overall effect is surpris
ingly blunt. Never mind the cutting edge,
we'd settle for a mere point.

characters' intense bonds with each other.
Because the movie's key relationship suf
fers from lack of development,-"Bound by
Honor" fights a losing battle from the begin
ning. Ultimately, it only perpetuates stereo
types of Chicanos and gang members, and
the story tells more of unbridled machismo
than of brotherhood and the human side of
gangs.
While Jesse Borrego (Cruz) and Benjamin
Bratt (Paco) give adequate performances,
Damian Chapa (Miklo) — a blond, blue
eyed half Chicano — has an annoyingly de
liberate Mexican accent reminiscent of
Speedy G )nzales.
But evi n more annoying than Chapa's ac
cent are the occasional subtides used for
English lines that happen to be spoken with a
slightly thicker accent. Nothing like letting
the viewer grasp the subtleties of Chicano
gang culture.
Despite the presence of renowned poet
Jimmy Santiago Baca on the screenwriting
team, the film's lack of flow and emotional
impact reflects little poetic influence.
What Baca does contribute, however, is
his insight on the intricacies and brutalities
of jail culture. Miklo spends the majority of
his life in San Quentin, where he becomes
intrinsically and irreversibly tied to its Chi
cano jail culture. These scenes are the film's
most thought-provoking and hard-hitting,
reflecting Baca's own experiences in jail,
where he learned to read and write.
Given the constant depictions of impale
ment by switchblades, butterfly knives,
heroine needles, picks, probes and even a
comb, the movie's overall effect is surpris
ingly blunt. Never mind the cutting edge,
we'd settle for a mere point.
