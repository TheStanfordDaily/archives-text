Nuclear wars, Earth's
resources: eco-band
has a grievance or two

Midnight Oil

Listen up. The tall bald man is back, and
he's got plenty to say.
In the album "Earth and Sun and Moon,"
lead singer Peter Garrett and his bandmates
in Midnight Oil tackle an assortment of is
sues set with strong guitar playing. And, as
usual, Midnight Oil has produced a solid
album containing the catchiest environmen
tally and politically correct songs out right
now.
Throughout their career, Midnight Oil has

consistently articulated their views, from re
turning Australian land to the aborigines to the
destruction of the earth's resources. Their lat
est release continues this tradition without
compromising thoughtful lyrics for boring
music.
"Earth and Sun and Moon," the song of the
same title, laments the destruction of the
earth's ecological environment. "An axe upon
the broken ground, the sigh of trees/And it's
floating in the ether and it brings me to my
knees," sings Garrett in a mournful voice that
reflects his sorrow at seeing the harm that hu
mans have done to nature.
In other tracks, he allows the rage he feels
to creep into his singing. Garrett attacks
blind faith in one's government in "My
Country." Here, robotically following lead
ership allows war to occur. "Now who can
stop the hail/When human senses fail/There
was never any warning, no escape," he sings.

Much of the power of Midnight Oil's
songs comes from the sheer force of Garrett's
vocals. Earnest and urgent, his singing com
pels the listener to sit up and take note of
what he's saying.
Garrett doesn't sound quite as angry on
this album as he did in previous efforts. He's
tempered his anger, but "Earth and Sun and
Moon" matches the group's earlier releases
in intensity.
Guitarists Jim Moginie and Martin Rosey,
along with bassist Bones Hillman, craft dri
ving guitar melodies that add to the urgency
of their lyrics. Moginie, doubling as a key
boardist, helps flesh out the tunes while
drummer Rob Hirst provides a steady beat.
But don't let all the talk about their politi
cal, social and environmental awareness dis
courage your listening to this album. Teeming
with energy, this album is pure rock and roll.
