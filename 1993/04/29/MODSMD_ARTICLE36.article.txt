Nuclear wars, Earth's
resources: eco-band
has a grievance or two

Midnight Oil

Listen up. The tall bald man is back, and
he's got plenty to say.
In the album "Earth and Sun and Moon,"
lead singer Peter Garrett and his bandmates
in Midnight Oil tackle an assortment of is
sues set with strong guitar playing. And, as
usual, Midnight Oil has produced a solid
album containing the catchiest environmen
tally and politically correct songs out right
now.
Throughout their career, Midnight Oil has

consistently articulated their views, from re
turning Australian land to the aborigines to the
destruction of the earth's resources. Their lat
est release continues this tradition without
compromising thoughtful lyrics for boring
music.
"Earth and Sun and Moon," the song of the
same title, laments the destruction of the
earth's ecological environment. "An axe upon
the broken ground, the sigh of trees/And it's
floating in the ether and it brings me to my
knees," sings Garrett in a mournful voice that
reflects his sorrow at seeing the harm that hu
mans have done to nature.
In other tracks, he allows the rage he feels
to creep into his singing. Garrett attacks
blind faith in one's government in "My
Country." Here, robotically following lead
ership allows war to occur. "Now who can
stop the hail/When human senses fail/There
was never any warning, no escape," he sings.

Much of the power of Midnight Oil's
songs comes from the sheer force of Garrett's
vocals. Earnest and urgent, his singing com
pels the listener to sit up and take note of
what he's saying.
Garrett doesn't sound quite as angry on
this album as he did in previous efforts. He's
tempered his anger, but "Earth and Sun and
Moon" matches the group's earlier releases
in intensity.
Guitarists Jim Moginie and Martin Rosey,
along with bassist Bones Hillman, craft dri
ving guitar melodies that add to the urgency
of their lyrics. Moginie, doubling as a key
boardist, helps flesh out the tunes while
drummer Rob Hirst provides a steady beat.
But don't let all the talk about their politi
cal, social and environmental awareness dis
courage your listening to this album. Teeming
with energy, this album is pure rock and roll.

Harmonica Hendrix,
blues-riff jamming
band try comeback

Blues Traveler

When Blues Traveler released their incen
diary debut album a few years back, they es
tablished themselves as a staple of college
music diets on the East Coast.
John Popper's harmonica playing was a
revelation. It was quite a novelty to hear this
300-pound man spew out notes with the pas
sion and dexterity of a harmonica Hendrix.
The fierce blues-riff jamming of the rest of
the band staked out a claim for blues-in
spired boogie in the modern-rock world.
(Back in the New York clubs, the lesser
known Spin Doctors would open shows and
then Blues Traveler would step forward and
jam until no one could dance anymore. It
seemed only a matter of time before Blues
Traveler would be REALLY big.)
Unfortunately, the band's second album,
"Travelers and Thieves," suffered from Pop
per's attempt to prove himself as a lyricist.
The music was a forced and uninspired back
drop to endless verses of acid-induced hippie
idealism and medieval imagery. The album
didn't sell very well.
Then the Spin Doctors emerged as the
quintessential groove-rock party band and
found the kind of mainstream success that
has since eluded Blues Traveler. One would
expect that the success of their musical com
panions would inspire Blues Traveler to re
turn to the fire and focus of their first album.
But no such luck.
"Save His Soul," their third release, is prob
ably better than the second album, but it's not
going to catapult them into the Spin Doctors'
chart territory. Instead, it exposes a band that
used up all it's material on their first record
and has been struggling ever since.
Still, there are some flashes of the old fire.
"Love and Greed," "NY Prophesie" and the
title track, "Save His Soul," showcase the sav
age rhythms and virtuoso harmonica py
rotechnics that are the band's forte.

When Blues Traveler
released their incendiary
debut album a few years
back, they established
themselves as a staple
of college music diets
on the East Coast.

The first single, "Conquer Me," is a pleas
ant and relatively catchy rewrite of the
Band's, "The Weight." And "Letter From A
Friend" is an interesting ballad about coming
to terms with the death of a loved one.
But the majority of the album is burdened
by the same turgid melodrama as the second
album. Some songs display promising varia
tions from the typical Blues Traveler style,
but it all gets pretty tiresome after rambling
musical sections and prolific versification
drag the songs way past rewarding conclu
sions.
For those who like the Spin Doctors and
have not yet heard Blues Traveler, the debut
album is a must-own. But "Save Your Soul" is
only for the die-hard fans who won't mind
buying half an album's worth of good material.

'Bigger and Defter'
follow-up just may
leave listeners deaf

LL Cool J

A lot of us here at Stanford feel as if we
peaked at 18. Ever since revolutionizing the
nip-hop industry with his classic album,
"Bigger and Deffer," LL probably feels the
same.

Back then, he tried incessantly to come
out with something new, something unex
pected. It seems now, with "14 Shots to the
Dome," he has forcefully bucked the desire to
revolutionize, adopting the glock-wielding,
hardcore style so popular today. Unfortu
nately, Marley Marl and company can't pro
duce an album that is non-stop hard without
making it eventually sound like a parody of
gangsta-style rap.
Armed with a hype video, the first single,
"How I'm Comm.' " successfully extends the
ass-beatin' LL Cool J from the hit single
"Mama Said Knock You Out." It's obvious LL
thrives on the energy of the hardcore beat,
rapping so forcefully his voice sometimes
cracks.
"Buckin' Em Down," as the title implies,
further pulls the hardcore image. It's a good
song, but by the time we reach it, 10 minutes
of yelling and thumping have begun to grate.
"Stand By Your Man," slows the album
down just in time, though its not the smooth
LL of old. Written when he was "turned on,"
the other slower groove, "Pink Cookies in a
Plastic Bag Getting Crushed By Buildings,"
brings back the carefree LL and exquisitely
demonstrates his poetic gift.
"Funkadelic Relic," a brief autobiography
of his career, provides another satisfying
track, mixing in samples from some of his
own favorite records, including "I Need a
Beat," "I Need Love" and "Mama Said Knock

You Out."
The style behind the album's other single
which is receiving pop radio time, "Back
Seat," indirectly tells the story behind LL's
new dedication to hardcore. Though playful
and smooth, LL noticeably avoids the pop
flavor attributed to his haughty single "I'm
That Type of Guy," a song that elicited over
whelming boos from a crowd in Harlem dur
ing a past performance.
"14 Shots to the Dome," though showcas
ing a handful of pretty good songs, is not fully
demonstrative of LL's true talent. He used to
experiment with several styles and succeed in
all of them. By moving toward the hardcore,
hip-hop has forced him to fit a mold, some
thing true greats like himself should never
have to do.
Do not despair, though; the street-beat fad
will fade, and LL will be back.

From metal to Top
40, alternative's up
and coming groups

SNIPPETS

Suede: "Suede"
America's welcoming androgyny with
open arms, and Suede, a new band from
Britain, hopes to become the next big thing.
Lead singer Brett Anderson pays tribute to
his idol Morrissey Suede's self-titled debut
album, drawing words out for full dramatic
effect and hitting some pretty high notes via
falsettos.
But Anderson's voice, when unassisted by
a catchy melody, quickly becomes annoying.
In "She's Not Dead," he tries to achieve ethe
real heights but fails mid-flight.
Anderson can't quite carry his voice with
the same panache as Morrissey. Instead, his
overblown manner of singing makes one

cringe.
When Suede manages to deliver, however,
the songs really hit the mark. Aided by a dri
ving guitar beat, songs like "Metal Mickey"
and"The Drowners" stand out when com
pared to earlier glam songs.
In Britain, Suede's album has become the
highest-selling debut album since Frankie
Goes to Hollywood. If Suede's wise, they'll
make a greater effort with their music instead
of allowing the image to sell. Otherwise, they
might go where Frankie went. Nowhere.
— Daphne Kwong

Hammerbox: "Numb"
You definitely have to be a hard-rock fan to
get into Hammerbox. Don't let the four-per
son band's Seattle roots fool you — Pearl Jam
they are not. Lead singer Carrie Akre's vocals
bite with venomous intensity, complimenting
perfectly the accompanying angry guitar riffs.
But don't assume she can't sing. She can.
As evidenced in "Hed," off Hammerbox's
major-label debut, Akre's rich vocals melt
over verses like bittersweet chocolate.
For punkers and people just plain in a
pissy mood, "Numb" is a God-send.

Tasmin Archer: "Great Expectations"
British-born artist Tasmin Archer may
have won the 1993 BRIT Award (equivalent
to the Grammys) for "Best Newcomer," but
the cut "Sleeping Satellite" is the best her first
release, "Great Expectations" ever gets.
Tired top-40 melodies sink Archer's spring
water clear vocals in a sea of vapidity. Fortu
nately, British and American critical acclaim
promises she will have a chance to get a real
band for her sophomore effort. But 1 digress.
Unless you're a slave to pop music, "Great
Expectations" has about as much appeal as
Garth Brooks.

he's got plenty to say.
In the album "Earth and Sun and Moon,"
lead singer Peter Garrett and his bandmates
in Midnight Oil tackle an assortment of is
sues set with strong guitar playing. And, as
usual, Midnight Oil has produced a solid
album containing the catchiest environmen
tally and politically correct songs out right
now.
Throughout their career, Midnight Oil has

consistently articulated their views, from re
turning Australian land to the aborigines to the
destruction of the earth's resources. Their lat
est release continues this tradition without
compromising thoughtful lyrics for boring
music.
"Earth and Sun and Moon," the song of the
same title, laments the destruction of the
earth's ecological environment. "An axe upon
the broken ground, the sigh of trees/And it's
floating in the ether and it brings me to my
knees," sings Garrett in a mournful voice that
reflects his sorrow at seeing the harm that hu
mans have done to nature.
In other tracks, he allows the rage he feels
to creep into his singing. Garrett attacks
blind faith in one's government in "My
Country." Here, robotically following lead
ership allows war to occur. "Now who can
stop the hail/When human senses fail/There
was never any warning, no escape," he sings.

Much of the power of Midnight Oil's
songs comes from the sheer force of Garrett's
vocals. Earnest and urgent, his singing com
pels the listener to sit up and take note of
what he's saying.
Garrett doesn't sound quite as angry on
this album as he did in previous efforts. He's
tempered his anger, but "Earth and Sun and
Moon" matches the group's earlier releases
in intensity.
Guitarists Jim Moginie and Martin Rosey,
along with bassist Bones Hillman, craft dri
ving guitar melodies that add to the urgency
of their lyrics. Moginie, doubling as a key
boardist, helps flesh out the tunes while
drummer Rob Hirst provides a steady beat.
But don't let all the talk about their politi
cal, social and environmental awareness dis
courage your listening to this album. Teeming
with energy, this album is pure rock and roll.

Harmonica Hendrix,
blues-riff jamming
band try comeback

Blues Traveler

When Blues Traveler released their incen
diary debut album a few years back, they es
tablished themselves as a staple of college
music diets on the East Coast.
John Popper's harmonica playing was a
revelation. It was quite a novelty to hear this
300-pound man spew out notes with the pas
sion and dexterity of a harmonica Hendrix.
The fierce blues-riff jamming of the rest of
the band staked out a claim for blues-in
spired boogie in the modern-rock world.
(Back in the New York clubs, the lesser
known Spin Doctors would open shows and
then Blues Traveler would step forward and
jam until no one could dance anymore. It
seemed only a matter of time before Blues
Traveler would be REALLY big.)
Unfortunately, the band's second album,
"Travelers and Thieves," suffered from Pop
per's attempt to prove himself as a lyricist.
The music was a forced and uninspired back
drop to endless verses of acid-induced hippie
idealism and medieval imagery. The album
didn't sell very well.
Then the Spin Doctors emerged as the
quintessential groove-rock party band and
found the kind of mainstream success that
has since eluded Blues Traveler. One would
expect that the success of their musical com
panions would inspire Blues Traveler to re
turn to the fire and focus of their first album.
But no such luck.
"Save His Soul," their third release, is prob
ably better than the second album, but it's not
going to catapult them into the Spin Doctors'
chart territory. Instead, it exposes a band that
used up all it's material on their first record
and has been struggling ever since.
Still, there are some flashes of the old fire.
"Love and Greed," "NY Prophesie" and the
title track, "Save His Soul," showcase the sav
age rhythms and virtuoso harmonica py
rotechnics that are the band's forte.

When Blues Traveler
released their incendiary
debut album a few years
back, they established
themselves as a staple
of college music diets
on the East Coast.

The first single, "Conquer Me," is a pleas
ant and relatively catchy rewrite of the
Band's, "The Weight." And "Letter From A
Friend" is an interesting ballad about coming
to terms with the death of a loved one.
But the majority of the album is burdened
by the same turgid melodrama as the second
album. Some songs display promising varia
tions from the typical Blues Traveler style,
but it all gets pretty tiresome after rambling
musical sections and prolific versification
drag the songs way past rewarding conclu
sions.
For those who like the Spin Doctors and
have not yet heard Blues Traveler, the debut
album is a must-own. But "Save Your Soul" is
only for the die-hard fans who won't mind
buying half an album's worth of good material.

'Bigger and Defter'
follow-up just may
leave listeners deaf

LL Cool J

A lot of us here at Stanford feel as if we
peaked at 18. Ever since revolutionizing the
nip-hop industry with his classic album,
"Bigger and Deffer," LL probably feels the
same.

Back then, he tried incessantly to come
out with something new, something unex
pected. It seems now, with "14 Shots to the
Dome," he has forcefully bucked the desire to
revolutionize, adopting the glock-wielding,
hardcore style so popular today. Unfortu
nately, Marley Marl and company can't pro
duce an album that is non-stop hard without
making it eventually sound like a parody of
gangsta-style rap.
Armed with a hype video, the first single,
"How I'm Comm.' " successfully extends the
ass-beatin' LL Cool J from the hit single
"Mama Said Knock You Out." It's obvious LL
thrives on the energy of the hardcore beat,
rapping so forcefully his voice sometimes
cracks.
"Buckin' Em Down," as the title implies,
further pulls the hardcore image. It's a good
song, but by the time we reach it, 10 minutes
of yelling and thumping have begun to grate.
"Stand By Your Man," slows the album
down just in time, though its not the smooth
LL of old. Written when he was "turned on,"
the other slower groove, "Pink Cookies in a
Plastic Bag Getting Crushed By Buildings,"
brings back the carefree LL and exquisitely
demonstrates his poetic gift.
"Funkadelic Relic," a brief autobiography
of his career, provides another satisfying
track, mixing in samples from some of his
own favorite records, including "I Need a
Beat," "I Need Love" and "Mama Said Knock

You Out."
The style behind the album's other single
which is receiving pop radio time, "Back
Seat," indirectly tells the story behind LL's
new dedication to hardcore. Though playful
and smooth, LL noticeably avoids the pop
flavor attributed to his haughty single "I'm
That Type of Guy," a song that elicited over
whelming boos from a crowd in Harlem dur
ing a past performance.
"14 Shots to the Dome," though showcas
ing a handful of pretty good songs, is not fully
demonstrative of LL's true talent. He used to
experiment with several styles and succeed in
all of them. By moving toward the hardcore,
hip-hop has forced him to fit a mold, some
thing true greats like himself should never
have to do.
Do not despair, though; the street-beat fad
will fade, and LL will be back.

From metal to Top
40, alternative's up
and coming groups

SNIPPETS

Suede: "Suede"
America's welcoming androgyny with
open arms, and Suede, a new band from
Britain, hopes to become the next big thing.
Lead singer Brett Anderson pays tribute to
his idol Morrissey Suede's self-titled debut
album, drawing words out for full dramatic
effect and hitting some pretty high notes via
falsettos.
But Anderson's voice, when unassisted by
a catchy melody, quickly becomes annoying.
In "She's Not Dead," he tries to achieve ethe
real heights but fails mid-flight.
Anderson can't quite carry his voice with
the same panache as Morrissey. Instead, his
overblown manner of singing makes one

cringe.
When Suede manages to deliver, however,
the songs really hit the mark. Aided by a dri
ving guitar beat, songs like "Metal Mickey"
and"The Drowners" stand out when com
pared to earlier glam songs.
In Britain, Suede's album has become the
highest-selling debut album since Frankie
Goes to Hollywood. If Suede's wise, they'll
make a greater effort with their music instead
of allowing the image to sell. Otherwise, they
might go where Frankie went. Nowhere.
— Daphne Kwong

Hammerbox: "Numb"
You definitely have to be a hard-rock fan to
get into Hammerbox. Don't let the four-per
son band's Seattle roots fool you — Pearl Jam
they are not. Lead singer Carrie Akre's vocals
bite with venomous intensity, complimenting
perfectly the accompanying angry guitar riffs.
But don't assume she can't sing. She can.
As evidenced in "Hed," off Hammerbox's
major-label debut, Akre's rich vocals melt
over verses like bittersweet chocolate.
For punkers and people just plain in a
pissy mood, "Numb" is a God-send.

Tasmin Archer: "Great Expectations"
British-born artist Tasmin Archer may
have won the 1993 BRIT Award (equivalent
to the Grammys) for "Best Newcomer," but
the cut "Sleeping Satellite" is the best her first
release, "Great Expectations" ever gets.
Tired top-40 melodies sink Archer's spring
water clear vocals in a sea of vapidity. Fortu
nately, British and American critical acclaim
promises she will have a chance to get a real
band for her sophomore effort. But 1 digress.
Unless you're a slave to pop music, "Great
Expectations" has about as much appeal as
Garth Brooks.
