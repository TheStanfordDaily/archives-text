■ Benny & Joon
Hip Seattle grunginess meets
1920s slapstick in this tale of misfit
romance. Benny is a mechanic
who cares for his eloquent but
schizophrenic sister, Joon. Enter
Sam, a charming weirdo who falls
in love with Joon to her brother's
dismay. Johnny Depp pulls of the
physical comedy scenes with a
style and grace that's truly
Keatonesque. PG
Boiling Point
Counterfeiters, cops and calls
girls, yes. An exciting action movie
with a halfway-credible plot, no.
Even with Wesley Snipes as
vengeful L.A. cop and Dennis Hop
per as the mobster who killed
Snipe's partner, this suspenseless
thriller can't hold the attention of a
vidiot. Sexist and full of gratuitous
violence, director James B. Harris'
"Boiling Point" is an embarassing
recipe for failure. R
■ Like Water For Chocolate
In Mexico, hot chocolate is pre
pared by adding cocoa to boiling
water. So when a person is sexual
ly aroused, they are termed "like
water for chocolate." The youngest
daughter of ranching family is

forced to stay at home with her
mother despite the attentions of a
virile suitor. But her passion can't
be contained, so she releases it in
the food that she painstakingly
prepares. A delectable banquet of
love, magic and food served up by
Mexican director Alfonso Arau. Not
Rated
■ Last Days of Chez Nous, The
Strong women dominate this
unique Australian film on the resi
dents Chez Nous, a cramped Syd
ney cottage. An offbeat if-you-love
someone-set them free story, "Last
Days" explores the subtle intrica
cies of gender and family relation
ships. A quiet celebration of family
and femininity. R
Sandlot, The
Miss those thrilling After School
Specials? Well, writer/director
David Mickey Evans has the film
for you. An agonizing drama about
the escapades of fifth-grade base
ball hounds, "The Sandlot" pro
vides as much entertainment as
Wonder Bread. But then again, if
you're a kid, you may prefer white
to nine-grain. If you're not, rent
E.T. At least it had magic. PG
