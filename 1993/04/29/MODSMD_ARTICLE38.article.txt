As the 46th Cannes Film Festival prepares to open on the
banks of the Riviera, here are some past American win
ners of its prestigious grand prize, the Palme D'Or:
In 1975, director Martin Scorsese's third feature, Taxi Dri
ver, vaulted him into the top rank of international filmmak
ing. Robert DeNiro starred as Travis Bickle, a psychopathic
Vietnam veteran who drives a cab at night because he can't
sleep. New York's mean streets — choked with hookers, hoods
and hustlers — drive Travis to seek redemption in a cathartic
orgy of violence. Cybil Shepherd and a young Jodie Foster co
star in one of the best films ever made.
First-time director Steven Soderbergh kicked off three years
of American dominance at Cannes with sex, lies and video
tape. The classic tale of yuppie angst stars Andie Macdowell as
a frigid woman whose husband is having an affair with her sis
ter. The presence of the character Graham, a now-impotent
family friend who videotapes women talking about their sexu
al experiences, turns everyone's life upside down. A comically
touching look at thirtysomething life.
After David Lynch's Blue Velvet revitalized his career, he
followed it up with Wild At Heart. Nicholas Cage and Laura
Dern star as Sailor and Lula, two lovers on the run from the law
and Lula's wicked witch of a mother. Lynch's script reworks
"The Wizard of Oz" into a darkly comic pop cartoon complete
with good witches, cowardly lions and, in a deliciously villain
ous role, Willem Dafoe as the Big Bad Wolf. "Wicked Game,"
the film's theme song, launched the singing career of the Bay
Area's own Chris Isaak. ■
