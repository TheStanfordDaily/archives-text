### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper plans to focus on under
graduate education and Stanford's
image during his first "State of the
University" address this afternoon
in Kresge Auditorium.
The annual address is signifi
cant because it allows the president
to review the past year and outline
his visions for the coming year. For
Casper, it will give him the oppor
tunity to publicly review his first
eight months in office.
The first part of his speech will
assess the University's image as
well as the "overall situation of the
University and the challenges it
faces in the present political and
economic environment," Casper
said yesterday.
He said he will focus on how
people inside and outside the
University look at Stanford, past
and future relations with the fed
eral government, and the eco
nomic challenges that Stanford

faces in the future.
According to Casper, the second
part of his speech will deal general
ly with undergraduate education.
He said he will investigate what
purposes the University is trying to
accomplish in teaching undergrad
uates.
Casper will discuss issues such
as Advanced Placement test credit,
whether the foreign language re
quirement is adequate, and"the in
terplay of all the requirements," in
cluding distribution requirements
and the Cultures, Ideas and Values
program.
University News Service Direc
tor Terry Shepard said Casper
wrote the address himself and is
taking this first speech "very seri
ously."
"Given all the constraints of his
schedule, he's giving [his talk] all
the attention he thinks it de
serves," Shepard said.
The annual presidential address
is given to the Academic Council.
This body is composed of essen
tially all associate, assistant and
tenured-line professors, as well
as senior researchers and a few
administrative officials.
Casper will deliver his
address today at 4:45 p.m. in
Kresge; it will be broadcast live
on KZSU and SUNet. Students
and staff are welcome to
attend.
