# A 						Perverse Tour
## 
### 
Now that rush is over, it's time to get perverse, and
Jesus Jones' Perverse Tour is just the ticket. It's techno
rock at its finest, with the heavy sounds of synthesizers
merging with the grunge of electric guitars. Your mom
wouldn't approve, but then again, she'll probably still
be happy about the Mother's Day card you sent her.
Expect music loud enough to hard-boil an egg at
point-blank range, perfect for shaking off the stress of
midterms.
You could tell your professors you're listening to a
musical presentation with Jesus. But however you want
it, you'd better act quickly .because the Perverse Tour is
only at the Warfield in S.F. for two days, May 14 and 15.
Call BASS for more ticket information.
