Only 10 days since the siege at Waco —
and already the jokes are rolling. Now we all
want to be hip on the latest in American
humor. But we don't want to tell a joke that
isn't funny. So here's a guide to the latest in
cult humor:
What are David Koresh's three favorite
movies?
"Backdraft"Firestarter" and "Apocalypse
Now."

This joke is clearly the product of a minor
league imagination. Avoid at all costs.
How do you pick up a Branch Davidian girl?
With a Dustbuster.
Simple and to the point. Even if people
don't laugh, the punchline comes so quickly
that you can move on to the next joke before
they realize it.
What is the Branch Davidian anthem?
"The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire/We
don't need no water, just burn, let it burn."
Inspired. Can't you picture the Branch

Davidians chanting those lyrics by the raging
firelight?
Why did Koresh burn down the Waco com
pound?
Because he wanted to keep up with the Jones.
The best of the lot. Twisted and macabre,
it'll leave listeners shaking their heads at your
irreverence. Guaranteed laughter — at the
very least, nervous chuckles.
