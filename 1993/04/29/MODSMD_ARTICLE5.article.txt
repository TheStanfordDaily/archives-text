# $2,000 in forged vouchers
## Junior arrested for cheating Bookstore 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
A Stanford junior has been arrested for al
legedly conducting a year-long scam in which
he stole more than $2,000 worth of books
from the Bookstore and exchanged them for
credit vouchers.
Dale Jeremy Yeatts, 22, was booked last
week on a $5,000 felony warrant for grand
theft, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said yesterday. Yeatts turned himself in last
week and has since been released from Santa
Clara County Jail.
Yeatts told The Daily "absolutely" denies
the charge, saying he doesn't even understand
its basis. "I think [the charges] are ground
less. ... I didn't do anything wrong," he said.
Police claim Yeatts' scam started last
March and ended April 14, when store em
ployees became suspicious. Yeatts would al
legedly walk into the Bookstore empty-hand
ed and collect textbooks, Niemeyer said.
Police believe he would then take the
books to the customer-service window and re
turn them for store credit, sometimes claim
ing he had forgotten his receipt.
According to Niemeyer, Yeatts received
$2,029 in Bookstore credit vouchers as part of

'I thought it would be a
joke to use funny names
and rebel against the bu
reaucracy of everyday life,'
Yeatts said. He said he
used names like 'Trotsky'
and 'Lenin.'

his scheme.
Yeatts, however, said it was "perfectly rea
sonable" for him to have "a couple of hundred
dollars" in credit because he had returned
books for several classes.
"The only thing I can see is that I bought
some books that the Bookstore and the police
thought were not necessary," Yeatts said.
"They interpret some kind of wrongdoing/'
Store officials started to suspect a scam be
cause of what Niemeyer calls "infamous ink
blot stains" â€” Yeatts allegedly spilled ink on
a stack of the vouchers. The inky vouchers

were signed by the same "clean and crisp"
handwriting, but used four or five different
names, Niemeyer said.
Employees were able to compare corre
sponding ink blots when he redeemed the
vouchers for merchandise and determined
that the differently named vouchers fell vic
tim to the same ink spill, and therefore came
from the same person.
Upon noticing Yeatts in the store making
numerous transactions and comparing ink
stains on the vouchers, Niemeyer said Book
store officials called the police.
Yeatts gave police "a weak excuse" to ex
plain why he used phony names at the store,
Niemeyer said.
"I thought it would be a joke to use funny
names and rebel against the bureaucracy of
everyday life," Yeatts said. He said he used
names like "Trotsky" and "Lenin."
The Bookstore usually requires a picture
ID for returns, but Niemeyer said Yeatts was
able to return the non-purchased books to the
store using fictitious names in 10 of the 22 al
leged incidents.
Yeatts told police he was dropping courses
and needed to return the books, Niemeyer
said. But after checking with the
Registrar, police discovered
Yeatts had not dropped any class
es.
Niemeyer said Yeatts became
uncooperative when two detec
tives went to search his Palo Alto
home, so the police secured a
search warrant to look for books.

For Yeatts to need $2,000
worth of books in one year is
"totally out of the realm of possi
bility," Niemeyer said.
But Yeatts, an anthropology
major, said he couldn't take some
of the courses he wanted to
because of unit limits. Instead, he
purchased books he thought
would be interesting to read later.
"I thought the whole experience
of broadening your horizons" was
part of Stanford's philosophy,
Yeatts said.
