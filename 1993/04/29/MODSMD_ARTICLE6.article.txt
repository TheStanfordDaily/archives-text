# Hidden fingers make Hoover carillon ring
## Tower bells lend a historic note 
### Vivien Wang 
Ordinary visitors to Hoover
Tower use the monument's anti
quated elevator, passing the first,
10th, 11th 12th and 13th floors to
reach the observation deck where
they can glimpse both a panorama
of campus and a cage containing
the tower's historic bells.
But the not-so-ordinary visi
tors have access to another, hid
den elevator that leads to a differ
ent level of the tower. And one of
those floors, the 13th, houses the
mechanism to make the tower's
bells ring.
Among musty stacks of books
on 20th century history and poli
tics sits a clearing with a simple
wooden platform upon which
rests a rickety piano bench, Ger
man music books and a very pecu
liar-looking mechanism.
This contraption consists of
wooden knobs organized in twos
and threes acting as levers that to
gether function like a keyboard.
Straight across from this curious
arrangement is what seems to be a
metal drum with patterned holes
and pegs ingrained in it, similar to
the little metal drums inside
