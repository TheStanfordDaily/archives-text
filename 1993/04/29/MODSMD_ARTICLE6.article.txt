# Hidden fingers make Hoover carillon ring
## Tower bells lend a historic note 
### Vivien Wang 
Ordinary visitors to Hoover
Tower use the monument's anti
quated elevator, passing the first,
10th, 11th 12th and 13th floors to
reach the observation deck where
they can glimpse both a panorama
of campus and a cage containing
the tower's historic bells.
But the not-so-ordinary visi
tors have access to another, hid
den elevator that leads to a differ
ent level of the tower. And one of
those floors, the 13th, houses the
mechanism to make the tower's
bells ring.
Among musty stacks of books
on 20th century history and poli
tics sits a clearing with a simple
wooden platform upon which
rests a rickety piano bench, Ger
man music books and a very pecu
liar-looking mechanism.
This contraption consists of
wooden knobs organized in twos
and threes acting as levers that to
gether function like a keyboard.
Straight across from this curious
arrangement is what seems to be a
metal drum with patterned holes
and pegs ingrained in it, similar to
the little metal drums inside

music boxes, but 100 times larg
er. Hair-like wires run from the
floor through two slots in the
ceiling.
Although this mechanism
remains nameless, it actually
performs a function of rather
resounding importance to the
carillon. It plays a host of once
common fixed melodies on the
tower's 35 bells of varying size
and tonal quality.
The 18,000-pound bells,
which used to ring at least once a
week, now hang motionless in
the middle of the tower's obser
vation platform.
In the past, James Angell, a
professor emeritus of electrical
engineering, rang the bells at
least once a week at dinner
time.
Hoover Senior Fellow Richard
Burress, who has worked in the
tower for many years, fondly
recalled Angell's tunes.
"I remember one day coming

back from a football game and
Dr. Angell was up there playing
'Raindrops Keep Falling on My
Head.' It was great," he said.
The bells have "certainly been
a very important part of Stan
ford history," Burress explained.
"If I could play them, I would."
Alumnus Tim Zerling
explained that sometimes he
would play sonatas with Angell
— some as long as an hour —
written especially for carillon
bells.
But during the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake, explained
Elena Danielson, an associate
archivist at Hoover, Angell and
Zerling were "playing the bells
like they usually did at 5 p.m.
when at 5:04 p.m., the earth
quake hit."
"Angell was playing a concert
and there were several people
with him" she said. "Suddenly,
books came off the shelves."
Zerling added that "the tower
was shaking so much that the
bells were ringing by themselves.
It was an absolute mess when the
earthquake was over. We had to
dig our way out."

After the earthquake, Daniel
son explained, "Professor Angell
was worried about the bells, so
he slowly and gently played one
last melody."
However, Zerling said the
playing was Angell's "way of sig
nalling that we were OK."
Though the bells still occa
sionally ring, Danielson said the
metal drum device that plays the
melodies was broken during the
earthquake. Due to the damage
and Angell's subsequent retire
ment, the bells have not been
played on a regular basis since
1989.
The last time the bells were
officially played was on the day of
(University President) Gerhard
Casper's inauguration; the next
performance will be during Com
mencement.
Zerling admitted that he did
"play the bells just on a whim"
once during winter break, but
other than that, he plays only
when University officials call
him for some special occasion.
Now the bells most often serve
as a type of wishing well, where
people throw pennies, dimes and

quarters. Some of the coins have
been sitting on the floor of the
bell cage for decades without
affecting their mellifluous
sound.
The bells have a history
almost as old as the tower itself.
They were given to the late
President Herbert Hoover, the
tower's namesake, by the Bel
gian government as a gift for his
World War I relief efforts.
The carillon also serves as a
monument to the end of the war.
On the largest bells is inscribed
in Latin: pro pace sono — "I ring
for peace."
The bells had only one home
prior to their installment in the
tower; they were part of the Bel
gian exhibition at the 1939 New
York World's Fair.
An inscription in Hoover
Library denotes that "The Caril
lon is a gift to Stanford Universi
ty from the Belgian American
Educational Foundation, with
which are associated the Belgian
universities and educational
foundations, recipients of endow
ment funds from the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium."

played on a regular basis since
1989.
The last time the bells were
officially played was on the day of
(University President) Gerhard
Casper's inauguration; the next
performance will be during Com
mencement.
Zerling admitted that he did
"play the bells just on a whim"
once during winter break, but
other than that, he plays only
when University officials call
him for some special occasion.
Now the bells most often serve
as a type of wishing well, where
people throw pennies, dimes and

quarters. Some of the coins have
been sitting on the floor of the
bell cage for decades without
affecting their mellifluous
sound.
The bells have a history
almost as old as the tower itself.
They were given to the late
President Herbert Hoover, the
tower's namesake, by the Bel
gian government as a gift for his
World War I relief efforts.
The carillon also serves as a
monument to the end of the war.
On the largest bells is inscribed
in Latin: pro pace sono — "I ring
for peace."
The bells had only one home
prior to their installment in the
tower; they were part of the Bel
gian exhibition at the 1939 New
York World's Fair.
An inscription in Hoover
Library denotes that "The Caril
lon is a gift to Stanford Universi
ty from the Belgian American
Educational Foundation, with
which are associated the Belgian
universities and educational
foundations, recipients of endow
ment funds from the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium."
