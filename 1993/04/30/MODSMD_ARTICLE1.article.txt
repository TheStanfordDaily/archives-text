# UCMI debate to continue
## 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
The University Cabinet de
cided yesterday to continue dis
cussion on the draft of its re
sponse to the 1991 University
Committee on Minority Issues
review.
Cabinet member and draft
author Paul Brest said the dis
cussion "didn't finish" at yester
day's meeting, and the docu
ment will be on the agenda when
the cabinet reconvenes May 13.
Brest, dean of the Law
School, said he cannot comment
on the response until the cabinet
releases a version that is meant
for the public.
The cabinet's confidential
draft was anonymously photo
copied, distributed to ethnic
community centers and ob
tained by The Daily earlier this
week.
Brest said the cabinet also has
received a student memoran
dum regarding the draft.
The cabinet's draft addresses
the review process of the UCMI
final report, which was written
in 1989 to evaluate and make
recommendations on the Uni
versity's multicultural goals.
In accordance with the final
report's recommendations, re
view panels were established in
1990 and 1991 to report on the
University's progress toward
these goals. The Office of Multi
cultural Development was estab
lished in late 1990 to oversee
this process.
The cabinet's draft makes
various observations about the
issues discussed in UCMI as well
as the 1990 and 1991 reviews.
Suggested adjustments to the
previous reviews include a pref
erence for the term "transcul
turalism" over "multicultural-
ism," a warning about ethnic com
munity centers' theme houses'
potential for self-segregation and
a call for more faculty mentors.
In addition, the draft recom
mends an "internal review pro
cess" of "provostial committees"

instead of the current UCMI
review panels composed of faculty,
staff and students from various
areas of Stanford as well as spe
cialists from outside universities.
Students have expressed con
cern over the draft, saying that
they had no voice in formulating
it and that the internal review
panels would not allow more
objective outside perspectives.
They also have said that the

draft's statements seem to sug
gest ethnic communities are
exclusionary and do not need
additional funding.
Copies of a flyer summarizing
and criticizing the cabinet's
draft were distributed at Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper's
State of the University address
yesterday afternoon.
The flyer — which states it is
"from concerned members of

Stanford's communities of color,
women, queers, disabled students,
the student government and the
general student body" — argues
that the cabinet's draft "strays
from UCMI's original commit
ment to multiculturalism," citing
examples such as the weakening
of the Office of Multicultural
Development's role and the lack of
recognition for ethnic theme hous
es and community centers.
