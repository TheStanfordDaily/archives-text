Economic growth declines
WASHINGTON (AP) - The growth
rate in the U.S. economy slowed dramat
ically to 1.8 percent in the first three
months of the year as consumers turned
more cautious and defense spending
dropped sharply, the government said
yesterday.
The increase in the gross domestic
product, the sum of all goods and services
produced in the United States, was less
than half the robust 4.7 percent annual
rate of the fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
The White House immediately seized
on the figures to renew its pitch for a $16.2
billion job-creating stimulus package,
blocked last week by Senate Republicans.
However, economist Norman Robert

son, an adjunct professor at Carnegie-
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said, "I
don't think this number in any way
implies we are on the threshold of anoth
er recession."
Number of AIDS cases grows
ATLANTA (AP) — The number of
Americans with AIDS increased at a sur
prising rate during the first three months
of the year, when more than 35,000 new
cases were reported, federal health offi
cials said yesterday.
Most of the new cases stemmed from
a new definition of the deadly disease,
but even cases not attributed to the
broader definition increased by 21 per
cent, double the rate for the period last
year.
