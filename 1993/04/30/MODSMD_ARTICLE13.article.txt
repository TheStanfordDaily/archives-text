WASHINGTON (AP) - Students
who perform community service could
work off $13,000 in college tuition, get a
modest stipend and qualify for health
care and day care benefits under Presi
dent Clinton's national service program.
According to a White House outline
of the program obtained by The Associ
ated Press, the plan to be unveiled today
also includes a more controversial com
ponent to make higher education afford
able: a $25 billion federal government
takeover of the college loan program.
Clinton said during the presidential
campaign he would like to have the IRS
collect loan money from students, but
Deputy Education Secretary Madeline
Kunin said yesterday that the Depart
ment of Education will hire private con
tractors to collect debts for now.
Neither the community service pro

gram nor the loan overhaul would be
fully in place before 1997.
Clinton sketched the outlines of this
program March 1; he scheduled a
speech today to students at the Univer
sity of New Orleans to promote it now
that draft legislation is ready to be sent
to Congress.
Some 150,000 students would join the
National Service Corps by 1997, when
the program is fully phased in. Students
could work full-time for up to two years,
earning $6,500 a year in tuition credits to
be paid directly to schools.
The $13,000 is substantially less
than the average cost of tuition but
equals the average debt among graduat
ing students.
Students, age 16 or older, could serve
after high school and before, during or
after they attend a college, university or

vocational school.
Federal money would also cover 85
percent of the costs of health insurance
for participants without access to cover
age, the outline said. The total cost of
the health care and day care benefits
was not specified in the outline.
The federal government would pay a
portion of the students' stipends. The
outline says the government would pay
no more than 85 percent of the annual
stipend now given to Volunteers in Ser
vice To America, or VISTA, workers.
Community service programs would
be allowed to double that amount using
their own money.
To administer the National Service
Trust Program, Clinton wants to merge
two existing federal agencies, the Com
mission on National and Community
Service and ACTION.
