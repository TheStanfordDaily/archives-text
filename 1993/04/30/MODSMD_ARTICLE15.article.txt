University committees
offer students a chance
to effect positive change

WHINE, YELL, WRITE a
letter, moan, sign a peti
tion, sigh. Repeat.
This year, student activism and
participation in University affairs
has been at best minimal and at
worst pathetic. From issues such
as the University's sexual harass
ment policy to the lack of summer
storage, and even the eviction of
the White Plaza vendors, student
voices haven't been heard; what
little has been done hasn't been
very productive.
In the next few weeks, students
will have the opportunity to ensure
history doesn't repeat itself; now is
the season to apply to serve on a
University Committee via the
ASSU's Nominations Commission.
Care about the possible rein
statement of the F? Apply to serve
on the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement. Con
cerned about library hours or ser
vices? Join the Committee on
Libraries. Want a Taco Bell in
Tresidder? How about a Gap? Join
the Tresidder Union Board.
Students can serve on commit
tees of undergraduate admissions
and financial aids; residential edu
cation; athletics; overseas studies;
graduate-student housing and
individually designed majors, to
name a few. Students may even sit
on KZSU's board of directors.
There are more than 50 com
mittees, panels, subcommittees
and boards of directors which have
more than 115 spaces reserved for
students.
To its credit, the ASSU is mak
ing it easier than ever to apply this
year. The user-friendly, five
minute-maximum-time-required
applications will be distributed
door-to-door. Just fill one out and
return it to the ASSU offices in
Tresidder by May 10. Applications

will then be screened and inter
views conducted. Influence is just
a one-page application away.
But of course, getting students
on the committees is just a start,
and the appointed students and
the ASSU must follow through
next year.
First, appointees for next year
should meet with this year's com
mittee members so they may be
briefed regarding how each com
mittee works, what issues are cur
rently in consideration, who sits on
the committee and how to work
with them.
The ASSU should endeavor to
keep track of these appointees,
ensuring they really are attending
meetings and representing stu
dents. The ASSU should also feel
free to use these students as infor
mation resources and/or conduits
for policy concerns.
A roster of the committee mem
bers, including addresses and
phone numbers, should be posted
prominently in the ASSU's offices.
The ASSU should also devise some
sort of mailbox or message system
whereby students could leave
notes for members.
Periodically, committee mem
bers should post reports about the
work of their committee and what
they specifically are doing on that
committee.
To orchestrate all these efforts,
perhaps a coordinator of commit
tee members should be named, or
someone on the Nominations
Committee should be assigned this
coordinator role. Without such a
facilitator, making the student
representative system work will be
an uphill battle, and students may
lose out for a second straight year.
Students have shown by elect
ing a Council of Presidents that
they're interested in having repre
sentation in University matters.
But even more than a COFJ the
committee system is a much more
extensive and powerful network
through which students can have a
say in policies that affect them.
So what's new? Well, this year
there may actually be a positive
answer to this question.
