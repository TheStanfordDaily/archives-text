## Conan the, er, librarian? 
### 
SINCE MY ROOMMATE'S desire to
do work was on par with his desire
to be eaten by a python, the TV in
our room was on last night. Jay Leno
was doing his best to be the funniest
comedian that can be made by modern
science, and suddenly he was joined on
stage by this computer programmer
from San Jose. Well, he looked like one
anyway.
This was Conan. Conan O'Brien is the
man who would be David Letterman. I
know I went on a tirade last week about
calling people by one name as a form of
grotesque reverence, so I'll do my best to
not just call him Dave. Anyway, I have
trouble calling anyone Conan, because it
brings up images of Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger hacking off the heads of snake
cultists.
For the members of the reading audi
ence who were raised by wolves in New
Mexico, or who absolutely must go to
sleep by 10 p.m., Dave Letterman is a
late night talk-show host who doesn't
have to stoop to featuring lesbian go-go
dancers (see Oprah).
Basically, Conan O'Brien isn't nearly
ugly enough to replace David Letterman.
Part of the charm of watching Dave
(shortened for repetition reasons) is his
bug-eyed, gap toothed face. Conan has a
full head of hair, and looks like a pretty
decent guy â€” definitely not like Letter
man, the raving maniac restrained by a

double-breasted blazer. Could Conan
repeat a phrase like "Hey, kids," or
"Work that jab," so much that the audi
ence finds it funny? It didn't look like it
from his short appearance on "The
Tonight Show."
To his credit, Conan O'Brien has writ
ten for some very funny TV programs,
including "The Simpsons." Perhaps he's
funny at two in the morning, locked in
his basement, giggling to himself, shout
ing "Hey wolfie!" at the top of his lungs,
and madly scribbling it down. But
whether he can be popular in front of the
cameras is dubious. Along the line of
other things whose popularity will be
dubious, the proposed Asian-American
Studies major also could be replaced by a
syndicated version of "Baywatch" soon
after its introduction. (My editors
demand that the column be relatively
coherent, so if I want to cover two topics,
I have to contrive some links between
them, however tenuous.)
Whether your diploma says "East
Asian Studies" or "Asian-American Stud
ies," Big Foreman Jim will still probably
let you drive the forklift, before he lets
Crazy Freddy, whose academic record
contains words like, "assault with a dead
ly weapon with intent to cause bodily
harm."
Just for grins I took down my Courses
and Degrees, blew the dust off, and
looked up the East-Asian Studies Major.

It has no classes. You can get a degree in
it, but you can't take a class in the
department, because there are none. In
Asian-American Studies, the department
also offers a grand total of zero classes.
Both of these departments only offer
cross-listed courses from other depart
ments.
Does this have to be a new major? For
some esoteric reason, will different words
on the diploma make a difference in any
thing? Will what you learn be fundamen
tally altered by what University comput
ers store as your mtyor? So, maybe what
people demand is more classes in the sub
ject of Asian-American Studies. Will
those 70 people that were at the rally fill
the classrooms of the new courses? (I
won't.) Or will those classes just become
a discarded symbol of an idiotic game of
one-upmanship between the various eth
nic and cultural groups on campus? Why
is it, that if these 70 people and thou
sands more across the land are so inter
ested in more classes in this subject, we
don't have more student-initiated semi
nars? Maybe we do, and I don't notice
(read as "care"). .. .
