Multiculturalism panel must include student voices

I APPRECIATED YOUR April 27 edi
torial on the University Committee
on Minority Issues. "Multicultural
ism," "political correctness" and other
buzzwords are sprinkled through our
current vocabulary like chocolate chips
in cookie dough.
Although I am passionately devoted
to the development of greater under
standing and respect among racial and
ethnic groups, the genders, different
religions, etc., I feel that the emphasis
on these catchphrases is masking the
true conflicts in our society.
My point to the Stanford community,

and especially the University Cabinet, is
this: Multiculturalism, or whatever you
choose to call it, is the students' issue.
The problems involved are both insti
tutional and interpersonal, but at bot
tom we are going to have to work out
these conflicts by ourselves. Stanford
has been trying for some time to reduce
tension through a number of education
al policies, including DR requirements
and dorm programming.
Although these well-meaning efforts
have opened some minds, they have put
a lot of people on the defensive, and as
we all know, defensive people don't com

municate veiy well. Speaking as an
Asian woman, I have found this defen
siveness to be more of a problem than
the initial stereotypes and prejudices. At
least the latter can be talked through.
If the University as an institution
has a role to play in increasing under
standing throughout this campus, it is
that of facilitator.
The confrontations between individ
uals and groups that have problems
with each other are going to have to
occur willingly. Trying to force the
adoption of "correct" ideas will only
postpone this conflict, and make it

much worse when it finally happens.
When the UCMI review is formed, it
is essential that it include students. The
conflict is between the students, the feel
ings are within the students and in the
end it is the students who have the over
whelming task of resolving these issues.
If the University Cabinet wishes to
assist us with this (as I'm sure they do),
they need to understand our needs.
Excluding the student voice from the
review panel would be an enormous mis
take.
