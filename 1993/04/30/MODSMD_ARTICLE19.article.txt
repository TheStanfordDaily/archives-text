# All charges and labels must undergo scrutiny to find out their worth
## 
### 
Like Mike Langford, I have been
bombarded by many questions about
myself as a white male. It is a painful
process to be confronted with uncom
fortable ideas, especially when they con
cern how people label you. Moreover, it
is true that snap judgements of racism,
sexism and homophobia can be wrong.
However, it is just as much a snap judge
ment to discard them without any
thought.
I am not imputing this to Langford,
but the fact is that some white males act
like addicts when it comes to charges of
racism, sexism and homophobia: instead
of "I am not an alcoholic," the flustered
reply is "I am not a racist!"
This reply may be perfectly accurate,
but it expresses a feeling of defensiveness
more than a conclusion based on reflec
tion.
Given the strong reactions that race,
gender and sexual orientation evoke, we
must not make snap judgements either
way when analyzing whether or not we

act according to biases regarding them.
The one extreme is to accept without
question the "oppressor" label and pro
ceed to flagellate one's self with guilt.
The other extreme is to enter flat denial,
where any charge is simply "PC" and
thus inconceivable.
I have seen this latter stance exhibit
ed all too often as a way to push aside
self-examination, myself included. It is
very pleasing to regard yourself as free
from oppressive behavior.
Of course, it is also pleasing to deny
that you are an alcoholic, though you
look forward to getting drunk every
night.
As Langford notes, quick labels of
others are not trustworthy. Our self
imposed labels can also deceive when not
exposed to critical examination.
