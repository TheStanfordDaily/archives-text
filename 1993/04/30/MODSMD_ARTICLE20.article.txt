# Commencement eating activities are a rather exclusive collection

### 
There must have been a typo. We
just received our Commencement

Weekend information packets, and,
perusing their contents, found that
there will be no place for us to eat on
June 12, 1993.
After a fun day of activities open to
all, the pluralist throng will part. Our
Catholic friends and their families will
gather at 4:30 p.m.; our Asian-Ameri
can friends and their families will be
dining at 5 p.m.; our Native American
friends and their families will be dining
at 6 p.m.; our African-American
friends and their families will be
received at 7 p.m.; and our
Chicano/Latino friends and their fami
lies will dine and dance until 1 a.m. We
fit none of these categories. And oh,
funny that, neither do our families, a
combined $240,000 in tuition later.
History repeats itself. Four years ago
during Freshman Orientation, we sat in
our dorm wondering which "Welcome
Banquet" to attend. We settled on the
Asian-American banquet, simply
because the food was the most appeal
ing. The food was fine, but we were
clearly outsiders.
This year, are we forced to be intruders
once again? It's bad enough we have no
place to go â€” after four years at Stan
ford, we're used to it. But what can we tell
our families? They're our guests.
We're confident that this has been an

oversight.
