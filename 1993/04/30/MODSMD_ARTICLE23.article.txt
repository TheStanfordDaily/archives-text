# Friendship with a celebrity proves more than it's cracked up to be
## 
### 
I HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS TO
build a barn. Not one of those small,
Fisher Price barns with the unauthentic
cow sounds either. I'm talking about the
kind of barn with plush carpets, sky
lights, self-flushing bidets and one of
those quaint ladder-loft things like they
had on "Little House."
And, when I say friends, I'm not talk
ing about a bunch of guys in 18th-centu
ry wigs, arguing about local politics in a
small room and eating tepid oats from a
cereal bowl. No, that's not what friends
are to me.
To me, a friend means something
more. A friend is someone who knows
me. Someone who knows what kind of
presents I like, what kind of words I con
sider to be appropriate compliments
("magnetic," "riveting," "gargantuan"),
and that certain kinds of cheap cologne
turn me on. Someone who knows the
story behind why that is.
Some would accuse me of having shal
low friendships, simply by virtue of the
fact that I have so many. To them, I say,
"Screw off." My friendships are some of
the most intimate, intense relationships

since Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty.
Some people spend hours together at
coffee shops, exchanging intimate details
about their lives, which oftentimes center
around bizarre sexual fantasies in which
I star. My friendships are not like that,
although I wouldn't be surprised if some
of that goes on in my friends' subcon
scious. But we don't talk about it.
When I pass a friend biking by, and I
say, "Hey babe," I'm communicating a lot
more than any cup of joe could ever hope
to accomplish. When I say "Let's do din
ner some time," I don't really mean it,
but that's not what's important. What
I'm saying is "If we're both at the same
restaurant, you should feel free to stop by
my table and say 'hi.' " In a friendship,
it's not the words that matter, it's the
emotion, the connection. And that's a
skill you just can't learn.
My friendships are the most impor
tant things in my life. More important
than my personal, polydactylic masseuse.
More important than the shrub outside
the Oval Office that the gardener, with
utmost care and precision, shapes in my
likeness as an odd, but powerful, tribute.
When my friends call and ask for a favor,
I do it, even if it means entirely rearrang
ing the schedule of a valuable member of

the Joel Stein Service.
No, I don't have a lot of time for my
friends. I can't personally return every
phone call or every piece of mail. And,
yes, sometimes I get confused with the
fan mail and send a form letter and a 5 X
7 glossy to someone I'm sleeping with.
But they always understand.
But although my time is extremely
limited, I make an effort to let people
know I care. If that means calling when I
know they're out, so I can save time by
leaving a message, then I do it. If it
means telling them to gather in large
groups and to wait for me in public
places, like the ATM machine and the
urinal, then I do it. I'm not afraid to bend
the rules. Not when it comes to my
friends.
And even if I'm not in touch, I make
sure I keep up on their lives. People at the
Stein Service are trained to trace their
location and interrogate their friends
until I find out what they've been eating,
if they've been exercising and who
they're sleeping with. The Service
employee then prescribes a strict diet, a
rigorous training program and a copy of
my latest book "Staying Trim, Keeping
Fit, Writing Clever: The Joel Stein
Secret."

Not everyone can be my friend. They
have to be willing to deal with the
tabloids, to have their name whispered at
posh dinner parties like it was a curse or
a rare South American disease. They
have to be willing to have Stein Service
employees occasionally spy outside their
windows to make sure they're not screen
ing when I call. Friendship is important,
but trust is stupid.
But for those who do become my
friends, they can look forward to a rela
tionship with more depth and strength
than any they'll ever know. No one ever
had a friend like me, not the Lone
Ranger, not Fred Flintstone, not Serbia
during World War I. If a friend of mine
needed a kidney, I'd buy him one. And
not one of those cheap, crack-infested
ones that anyone can find off the streets.
That's the kind of friend I am.
