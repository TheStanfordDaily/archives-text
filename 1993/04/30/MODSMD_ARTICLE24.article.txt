## Tennis gears up for Huskies, California Stanford hosts final dual matches of season 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
This weekend marks the final
dress rehearsal for the eighth
ranked Cardinal men's tennis team.
Today's match against Washington
at 1:30 p.m. and tomorrow's contest
with California at 1 p.m. will be the
last home competitions and the final
dual matches of the season for the
defending national champions. In
two weeks, Stanford (17-4) will head
back to Athens, Ga., in search of its
third national team title in four
years.
Although the Huskies and the
Bears are unranked, Cardinal head
coach Dick Gould expects two solid
matches this weekend.
"Washington is kind of a scary
team," he said. "They have a No. 1
player (Chet Crile) who can beat
anyone in collegiate tennis, and good
depth throughout their lineup."
No. 26 Crile, a senior at Washing
ton, defeated USC's No. 2 man,
David Ekerot, at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoor Championships. Yet
Stanford's No. 3 player, Vimal
Patel, defeated Crile last weekend at
the Pac-10 Individual Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif.
Although Stanford's No. 1 hitter,
Michael Flanagan, crushed Crile 6-
3, 6-1 in the finals of the Pac-10
Indoor Championships in January,
the junior from Dallas may still be a
bit shaken up from last week's sur

prising first-round loss to Cars
Steve Lappin at the Pac-10 Individu
al Championships.
"Mike will have a tough match
(against Crile)," Gould said. "It'll be
interesting to see how he bounces
back after last weekend."
Also at the top of the Husky ros
ter is Robbie Wendell, a transfer
from UCLA. He has been perform
ing well all year, defeating
formidable players like his former
Bruin teammate and Pac-10 Individ
ual Champion, Fritz Bissell, earlier
in the season.
Tomorrow's Big Match will be no
cake-walk either. Despite last
month's solid 6-3 pounding of Cal on
foreign turf, the Cardinal is expect
ing to meet a new-and-improved
pack of Bears at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
"They were pretty banged up and
not really ready to play us last
time," Gould said. "They'll be much
tougher this time around."
The Bears are led by No. 40
Tommy Phanco, who was handily
defeated by Stanford's Chris Coco
tos in the first round of play in Ojai
last weekend. In their last meeting,
Flanagan also crushed Phanco, 6-2,
6-3.
The Bears lost one starter to
graduation last spring, but gained
several formidable players this year.
Freshman Casey Louie and San Jose
State transfer Brian Eagle have
notched up impressive upsets

throughout the season.
However, Stanford junior Robert
Devens quickly found Eagle's weak
spots when they played in Berkeley
at the beginning of the season, win
ning 6-2, 6-4. The story was similar
with freshman Jeff Salzenstein, as

he crushed the upstart Louie 6-3, 6-
3.
After its last two home matches
this weekend, the Cardinal will have
two competition-free weeks to make
any alterations before beginning its
quest for the national title.
