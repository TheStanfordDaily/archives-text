Men's volleyball
Tonight at Bren Events
Center in Irvine, Calif., the
No. 2 Stanford men's volley
ball team (18-5, 16-4 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) takes on No. 5 Long
Beach State (17-12, 13-7) in
the semifinals of the MPSF
tournament.
A win tonight, coupled with
a win Saturday night against
the winner of the Cal State-
Northridge vs. Pepperdine
match will garner the MPSF
nomination for an at-large bid
to the NCAA Final Four in
Los Angeles for the Cardinal.
No. 1 UCLA already clinched
a trip to L.A. with a victory
Wednesday night against

Stanford.
Stanford must rebound
after an abysmal performance
against the Bruins. As a team
the Cardinal hit .145, its low
est output of the year. Indi
vidually, Ail-American Dave
Goss and MPSF Player of the
Year Canyon Ceman must
recover from particularly bad
outings.
The 49ers have lost to
Stanford twice this year
already. They advanced to the
semifinals by defeating
Brigham Young University
15-13, 15-13, 15-13 on
Wednesday night. Olympian
Brent Hilliard led the team
with 39 kills against the
Cougars.
