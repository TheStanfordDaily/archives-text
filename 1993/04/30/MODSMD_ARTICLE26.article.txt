# Golf hosts tournament
## Women to play in California intercollegiate 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf team will
host the California Intercollegiate Golf
Invitational this weekend at Stanford Golf
Course. The par-73, 6,200-yard course has
been ranked as one of the nation's top
-100, making for an excellent competition
on Saturday. The eighth-ranked Cardinal
will face three highly-rated teams, includ
ing 20th-ranked Washington, ninth
ranked USC and top-ranked San Jose
State.
The Cardinal will be represented by
senior captain and First Team All-Pacific
10 Conference selection Martha Richards,
junior Melinda Daniels, sophomore
Jamille Jose, and freshmen Vicky Strada
and Julie Bowen. Richards has led the
Cardinal in six of eight outings this year,
winning the Ping/ASU Invitational at the

treacherous Karsten Golf Course.
Richards and the Cardinal can expect to
face fierce individual competition in the
form of Tracy Hanson from San Jose
State, Jill McGill from USC, and Angie
Burkett and Sherri Vincent from Wash
ington.
The Cardinal would seem to have the
advantage playing on its home golf course.
Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin downplayed
this aspect of the competition, however.
"All three teams really know our course,"
Baldwin said. "Last year, San Jose State
came up and broke every record imagin
able."
The Spartans, considered by many to be
the best collection of amateur women's
golfers of all time, had the lowest three
round total in Stanford Golf Course history
(870), the lowest one-round total (284) and
tournament-winner Tracy Han
son had the lowest individual
three-round total (211). All three
of these records still stand today.
The Cardinal has finished tied
for fourth in each of the last two
tournaments it has appeared in,
including the Ping/ASU Invita
tional and the Pac-10 Champi
onships. The team, which had a
mediocre fall season, has
improved dramatically in the
spring, rising to eighth in the
nation. The Cardinal golfers are
looking to use this tournament as
preparation for the NCAA West
ern Regionals, held May 13
through 15 in Tucson, Ariz.
"This tournament is a great
warmup for the regionals," Bald
win said. "We're considering it to
be just like any other tourna
ment, and we should give San
Jose State a good run."
