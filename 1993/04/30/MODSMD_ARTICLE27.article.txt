# Batters face tough Devils
## Arizona State best in Six-Pac

"We've got to win some games down there [at Arizona
State]," said Stanford coach Mark. Marquess. "It's pretty
simple."
With 13 games remaining on the regular-season
schedule, things have gotten simple for the Cardinal
baseball team. Stanford (22-20 overall, 7-14 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) must win at least seven,
and probably eight, of its remaining nine Six-Pac games
to advance to the NCAA playoffs.
Does the Cardinal have a realistic shot at finishing so
strongly? This weekend's series at Arizona State will
prove everything.
Winners of 11 of their last 13 games, the Sun Devils
(38-16, 15-9) are the hottest team in the conference. Ari
zona State's No. 2 national ranking is the team's highest
since 1990, and the squad has won 12 of its last 15 Six-Pac
games.
"ASU is the class of the conference," Marquess said.
"They've proven all season that they're a competitive
club. But we still have a shot at them."
The Cardinal must play some of its best baseball of the
season to have a true shot at Arizona State. The Sun Dev
ils are the quintessential complete baseball team, first in
the conference in earned-run average (4.62) and second in
both batting average (.336) and fielding percentage (.959).
The Arizona State roster also features two of the most
respected players in the conference in Marc Barcelo and
Paul LoDuca.
Barcelo, a righthander who was a virtual unknown
entering the season, has bettered the most optimistic
expectations of Sun Devil coach Jim Brock. "Marc's been
one of the most pleasant surprises all season," Brock said.
"He pitched well at the end of last season, and right now,
he's better than we ever thought he might be."
Barcelo leads the Six-Pac with a 3.10 ERA, and is tied
