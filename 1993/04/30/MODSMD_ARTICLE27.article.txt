# Batters face tough Devils
## Arizona State best in Six-Pac 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
"We've got to win some games down there [at Arizona
State]," said Stanford coach Mark. Marquess. "It's pretty
simple."
With 13 games remaining on the regular-season
schedule, things have gotten simple for the Cardinal
baseball team. Stanford (22-20 overall, 7-14 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) must win at least seven,
and probably eight, of its remaining nine Six-Pac games
to advance to the NCAA playoffs.
Does the Cardinal have a realistic shot at finishing so
strongly? This weekend's series at Arizona State will
prove everything.
Winners of 11 of their last 13 games, the Sun Devils
(38-16, 15-9) are the hottest team in the conference. Ari
zona State's No. 2 national ranking is the team's highest
since 1990, and the squad has won 12 of its last 15 Six-Pac
games.
"ASU is the class of the conference," Marquess said.
"They've proven all season that they're a competitive
club. But we still have a shot at them."
The Cardinal must play some of its best baseball of the
season to have a true shot at Arizona State. The Sun Dev
ils are the quintessential complete baseball team, first in
the conference in earned-run average (4.62) and second in
both batting average (.336) and fielding percentage (.959).
The Arizona State roster also features two of the most
respected players in the conference in Marc Barcelo and
Paul LoDuca.
Barcelo, a righthander who was a virtual unknown
entering the season, has bettered the most optimistic
expectations of Sun Devil coach Jim Brock. "Marc's been
one of the most pleasant surprises all season," Brock said.
"He pitched well at the end of last season, and right now,
he's better than we ever thought he might be."
Barcelo leads the Six-Pac with a 3.10 ERA, and is tied
for second in the conference in both wins (9) and com
plete games (6).
More impressively, he emerged the clear winner of
his first duel of the season with Cardinal ace Willie
Adams. While Arizona State touched Adams for eight
earned runs in less than seven innings of work, Barce
lo went the distance in a 12-2 complete-game win. The
junior has not lost an outing in more than a month.
But if Barcelo has been solid on the mound, LoDu
ca has been simply spectacular at the plate. When the
Cardinal last saw LoDuca, the catcher/designated hit
ter was riding a modest 12-game hitting streak.
Now make it 32. LoDuca is working on the third
longest streak in Sun Devil histoiy, and has hit in all
but three of Arizona State's 54 games.
LoDuca and company will face a Jekyll-and-Hyde
Cardinal rotation which has struggled all season to
string together three solid performances. While Adams
and Andrew Lorraine form the division's most potent
righty-lefty combo, Stanford has yet to win a confer
ence game using any other hurler.
Once again, the Cardinal will probably look to either
Todd Bartels or Dan Reed on Sunday. The two fresh
men have alternated flashes of brilliance with less
than-impressive outings all year.
"This is a big weekend for whoever we start in that
game," Marquess said. "We need a big game on Sun
day, and the team knows it."
On offense, the struggling Cardinal bats have
shown increased life lately. Stanford has scored 40
runs in its last four games, including a monstrous 20-
run, 21-hit output at the University of San Francisco
on Tuesday.
Shortstop Jed Hansen, moved from third to seventh
to second in the lineup, has responded by exploding for
three home runs and two doubles in his last five games,
raising his season average from .274 to .301.
