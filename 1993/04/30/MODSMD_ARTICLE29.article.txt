# Sailors take Pacific Coast Championships
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Stanford's women sailors
proved themselves undisputed
commanders of the West Coast
waters last weekend, as they suc
cessfully defended their Pacific
Coast Conference Championship
title and advanced to national
competition.
Establishing a decisive lead
over the seven other schools early
in the regatta, the Stanford
women let it be known that the
championship crown was in their
possession to stay.
"We were the class of the
regatta," said Stanford coach
Blake Middleton. "Last year it
was a surprise that we won. This
year we were expected to win and
we did it in a convincing way."
More often than not, the real
competition was between UC-
Santa Cruz and UC-Santa Bar
bara as they battled for second
place. Santa Cruz prevailed in the
end and came in 27 points behind
Stanford. With their finish, the
Banana Slugs also advanced to
the Nationals, which will be held
starting May 27 in Maryland.
Santa Barbara finished 55 points
back to take third. Whether they
will also advance has not yet been
announced.
Finishing in the top-three in
all but two races, the Cardinal
gained early dominance over the
other competing schools and
never looked back. The Cardinal
established an early lead Satur
day afternoon, taking advantage
of its superior skills in heavy
winds to move beyond the reach
of the other teams, Middleton
said.
"It was fun to realize that we
are definitely the best team on
the West Coast," said senior
crewmate Kathy Akers, who took
first place in B Division with
senior Haley King as skipper.
King and Akers won their divi
sion by taking first place six times
and second place another six in

their 15 total races. They finished
out of the top-three in only one
race, and left the nearest compe
tition 10 points behind.
In A Division, freshman skip
per Gretchen Uznis with senior
crewmate Britt Johnson took
command by winning their first
four races and going on to take
first another three times. They
came in second place four times,
and ended up third one time. The
nearest boat came in 16 points

behind them.
Sophomore Polly Brown took
over for Johnson as crew when
winds were particularly heavy.
Freshman skipper Cinnamon
Hampikian and crewmate
Catherine Adams-Simmons were
also substitutes for the Cardinal.
With their advance last week
end, the Cardinal women earned
a berth among the 16 teams at
the Nationals, where they fin
ished 13th last year.

This year, any finish in the top
eight will represent a good perfor
mance. However, if the condi
tions are windy during the com
petition, Stanford would become
a strong contender for one of the
top spots, according to Middleton.
Hoping to fare as well as the
women sailors, Stanford's coed
teams will vie for a top-two finish

The Cardinal is a favorite to
win the team-racing competition
in Cabrillo Beach, Calif., today
and advance to Nationals for an
eighth-consecutive year.
The outcome of the dinghy
fleet racing is far from certain,
however, as five teams ranked in
the top-20 will go head-to-head
Saturday and Sunday.
No. 3 Hawaii is expected to be
one of the top-two teams, but will
face stiff competition from the four
other ranked schools. Stanford,
ranked No. 13, will have to beat out
No. 8 UC-Irvine and No. 9 Califor
nia earn its spot at Nationals. USC,
ranked No. 18, is also a strong con
tender and has the homewater
advantage in Cabrillo Beach.
