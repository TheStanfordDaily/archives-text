# Casper plans review of undergrad studies
## Speech questions DR system, four-year degree 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper
announced plans to establish a commission
to re-evaluate Stanford's undergraduate
curriculum and requirements yesterday
during his "State of the University" ad
dress.
Speaking to the Academic Council in
Kresge Auditorium, Casper also discussed
the University's overall health, emphasiz
ing finances and the tense relationship
with the federal government.
Once established, the goal of the new
Commission on Undergraduate Education
will be to "clarify the purpose of (Stan
ford's] undergraduate programs and see to
it that the content of our programs clearly
supports that purpose," he said.
Casper said that he will wait a couple of

weeks to form the commission of about 15
students, alumni, faculty and staff so he
can receive input from both the current
and incoming provosts as well as the new
and old deans of Humanities and Sciences.
Quoting Swede Torsten Husen, Casper
said Stanford needs to be wary of "multi
disciplinary illiteracy," and he questioned
whether the distribution requirements ac
tually give students useful knowledge or
just offer a "smattering of this and a smat
tering of that, which we can hardly believe
to be the essentials of education."
He suggested that the new commission
look into the idea that the requirements be
not about sampling a lot of areas, but
rather about focusing on "the particular in
tellectual skills" needed for a career.
In reviewing the current requirements,
Casper tied in the idea of the
essentials of a college education
with his widely-discussed three
year degree plan, despite having
downplayed the seriousness of
his suggestion several months
ago.
Casper pointed to the fact that
many students satisfy the 180
credits needed for graduation
before the end of their senior
year, but stay in Stanford for four
years because it is the typical
"social convention."
"As a purely practical matter,
as the cost of education rises, we
must increasingly focus on essen
tials," Casper said.
Casper touched on a host of
additional suggestions regarding
ways to strengthen Stanford's
undergraduate education.
He suggested requiring more
logic courses "that focus on the
very tools of thought and analysis
themselves," and also mentioned
that he fears students lack ade
quate knowledge of both Ameri
can and foreign culture.
Saying "no introductory
course can do justice to another
civilization," Casper added that
he feels the language requirement
is "a poor and inadequate substi
tute" for true proficiency in sec
ond language.
He said he also believes "stu
dents at an American university
should graduate with an appre
ciation of American civiliza
tion."
Casper tied his discussion of
academic issues with financial
ones, saying Stanford's continu
ing budget woes necessitate "fur
ther review and reductions of
activities, including academic
ones."
Subsequently, looking at the
essentials of a Stanford education
will include considering if "the
range of undergraduate degrees
and majors is appropriate and . . .
affordable in the light of [thesej

cost pressures."
WTiile Casper said after the
meeting that combining current
majors may be necessary due to
costs, this does not mean that
new majors, like the proposed
Asian-American studies program,
will be ignored.
The creation of new programs
is a different issue that the School
of Humanities and Sciences has
to determine with regard to
resources and needs for such new
programs, he said.
Casper emphasized the need to
"maintain [Stanford's] commit
ment to intellectual quality and
open discourse .. . even if we do
not have all of the financial
resources."
Citing the fact that Stanford
still faces budget cutting long into
the future, Casper said in the first
part of his speech that "there
never again will be business-as
usual; the 'good old days' will not
return."
Casper also took the opportu
nity to lash out at the federal gov
ernment for prolonging the indi
rect-cost investigation that has
cost Stanford $27 million to date,
and enough man-hours to equal
one person working full-time for
125 years.
"Our frustration level is very
high," he said. However, he added
that future cooperation between
educational institutions and the
government is important for
enhancing research and technolo
gy*
Prof. William Northway, chair
of the Faculty Senate, said
Casper's speech was excellent and
the proposed commission is
important to determine the best
curriculum to prepare students
for the next century.
Despite the crises Stanford has
been through and the questions
ahead, Casper told the audience
not to "get carried away by gloom
and doom."
"Many envy our intellectual
and material resources. Stanford
may not be the Garden of Eden,
but it comes awfully close," he
said.
