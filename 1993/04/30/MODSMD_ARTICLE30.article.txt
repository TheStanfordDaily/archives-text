# Ruggers head off to Final Four matches
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Starting with a core of only
three returning players at the
outset of the season, the Stan
ford women's rugby team has
proven that hard work indeed
paves the way to success.
This weekend, the squad
hopes a year of intense prac
tice will pay off as it travels to
the NCAA Championships in
Houston, Texas. The Cardinal
will represent the Pacific
Coast division, facing off
against Connecticut, Pennsyl
vania State and Air Force in a
Final-Four style tournament.
"I think our team is really
excited about this weekend,"
said sophomore co-captain
Karen O'Connell. "It's really
just a matter of who we can
surprise."
O'Connell's attitude stems
from a season marked by
defeats. Since Stanford is the
only women's collegiate rugby
team in California, it has
mainly only had the chance to
test its skills against area
women's club teams.
The Cardinal fell in all five of
its matches against these clubs,
which are made up of highly
experienced adult players.
"They do get to see very,
very good rugby, but it is hard
to keep up morale," said Stan
ford coach Nancy Breen. "I've
been amazed with the team;
they know that they're learn
* _ M
ing.
Since the bulk of the team
is comprised of freshmen,
learning the mechanics of the
sport has been one of the
squad's main focuses. A mjyor
recruiting effort at the begin
ning of the year spawned 45

interested women, a number
which has leveled off to 25 on
the current roster.
"We started out just want
ing to get a team together,"
said senior co-captain Eliza
beth Bassett. "But so much
talent came together that we
thought we really could go
somewhere."
The team's opportunity
arose when Washington State
traveled to Stanford in March.
In a game which ended 31-0,
the Cardinal's complete domi
nation over the Cougars was
apparent. "We tried to con
vince people we were playing
well against the club teams,"
O'Connell said. "We later
proved it when we played [our
first collegiate game] against
WSU."
In its second collegiate
matchup, Stanford tied Rad
cliffe 5-5, again demonstrating
its merit as a viable contender
against teams of the same age
and experience level.
While Washington State
was planning on representing
the Pacific Coast in Nationals,
the Cougars decided to offer
the spot to Stanford after los
ing by so wide a margin.
"At the college level, we're
definitely very competitive,"
Breen said. She attributes
much of the team's success not
only to the hard work and
intensity of the team, but to the
squad's overall intelligence.
"As Stanford students, the
team is very smart and orient
ed to being useful in team situ
ations," Breen said. "In such a
high-pressure sport, they have
really demonstrated a sense of
grace."
