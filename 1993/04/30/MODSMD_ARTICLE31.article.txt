# Track guns for top showings at Chico
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
In preparation for the Big
Meet against California next
Sunday, the Stanford track and
field team will travel north to
compete in the Chico Invitation
al this Saturday.
Considered a low-key meet,
the Invite will give the athletes
another chance to qualify for the
Pacific 10 Conference Finals
before the team enters the cham
pionship portion of its season
next week.
Thus far, five Cardinal men
and seven women have achieved
Pac-10 qualifying standards.
For the men, sophomore
Travis Clark high jumped 7 feet,
1 3/4 inches three weeks ago to
place him among the favorites at
the Pac-10 meet. Freshman
Rene Rodriguez has also
impressed Pac-10 watchers with
a 46.94 clocking in the 400
meters.
In the distance events, Mike
Reilly is among the top
steeplechase runners in the con
ference with a 8:59.42 showing
in the 3,000 steeplechase. Senior
Dave Scudamore, who also has
an NCAA provisional time in the
10,000, ran a blazing 14:12.88 in
the 5,000 three weeks ago at the
Stanford All-Comers Meet. Mark
Hochstetler qualified in the 800
(1:54.14) to round out the Cardi
nal men's team.
On the women's squad, senior
sprinter Rhonda Oliver is a Pac
-10 qualifier in both the 100
(11.97) and the 400 (55.30).
Freshman Dena Dey has also

qualified in two events, including
the 1,500 with a time of 4:35.50,
and the 800 with a 2:10.20.
Junior transfer Louise Wat
son, who won the NCAA District
-8 Regional cross-country title last
fall, has qualified in the 1,500
(4:36.01) and the 3,000 (9:23.20)
this season. Her time in the 3,000
is also an NCAA provisional time,
which will likely earn her an invi
tation to the national meet in
New Orleans this June, according
to Stanford coach Vin Lananna.
Melissa Freeberg is a qualifier
in the 1,500 as well, giving the
Cardinal three entries in that
event. Sophomore Christy Boyd
has posted a 14.20 in the 100
hurdles, while on the field, Dana
Weeks has triple jumped 38-feet
-11 and Jenny McCormick has
thrown 155-feet-4 in the javelin.
In the spirit of this rebuilding
year, Lananna and his athletes
will try to increase the number of
Pac-10 qualifiers on both teams.
"We're trying to get as many
people to qualify as possible, in
order to raise the sights of our
program," Lananna said. "This
year we'll get lots of athletes
experienced at the Pac-10 level
so we can be competitive on that
and higher levels in the future."
For now, the team's main
focus is on hosting the Golden
Bears at Stanford Stadium on
May 9. After the Big Meet, the
Stanford Pre-Pac-10 Open Meet
will follow a week later. The sea
son then culminates on the
weekend of May 21, as the Cardi
nal will take its chances at the
Pac-10 meet on the Bears' home
turf.
