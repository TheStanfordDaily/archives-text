# Men's golf takes ninth in Pac-10 Championships
## 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
"We were jinxed by the devil before
we even started," said Stanford coach
Wally Goodwin of the men's golf team,
which returned from the Pacific 10
Conference Championships yesterday.
The Cardinal entered the tourna
ment as the defending champion and
left a disappointing ninth-place finish
er in the 10-team field.
The only player unaffected by the
"jinx" appeared to be sophomore sen
sation Steve Burdick, who brought
home a seventh-place finish in the indi
vidual competition. Burdick's perfor
mance also earned him All-Pac-10
First Team honors.
Sophomore Jerry Chang placed
38th in a tie with Darren Dragovich,

who had never played a round of colle
giate golf before this season. Freshmen
David Garcia and Peter Ligotti finished
53rd and 58th, respectively.
Most of the excitement occurred on
the way down to the Sandpiper Golf
Course in Goleta, Calif. Goodwin had
wrenched his back the day before,
freshman David Garcia was suffering
from a nosebleed and sophomore Jerry
Chang was dealing with his allergies.
To make things more interesting,
the right rear wheel nearly came off
the team's van somewhere south of
Morgan Hill.
"If we had been going highway
speed," Goodwin said, "six Stanford
golfers and one coach wouldn't be here
right now."
The squad carried on, and found
themselves in the midst of tough Pac

10 competition. Many of the team's
troubles stemmed from the fact that
most of last year's squad redshirted
this season, with Burdick the only
returning member.
The final results of the Pac-10 tour
nament reflected the success of the
Arizona programs and the difficulty of
the par-72, 7,067-yard course. Arizona
State came from nine shots back of
defending-national champion Arizona
at the start of the final round to win
the team title. ASU placed first with
1,44.4. strokes, just two shots ahead of
Arizona at 1,446. Tournament host
UCLA placed third, California placed
fourth at 1,490 and Stanford was ninth
at 1,517.
The individual competition was also
a shoot-out between the Arizona
schools. Jason Gore of Arizona and

Todd Demsey of ASU shot four-under
par 284's, with Gore winning a sudden
death playoff at the second hole to take
the Pac-10 individual title. Burdick fin
ished just five strokes off the pace for
the Cardinal with a one-over-par 289.
In what Goodwin described as "the
best thing to happen this week," and a
"worthy decision," Burdick was named
as the only non-Arizona-school player
to receive All-Pac-10 honors. Jason
Gore, David Berganio and Manny Zer
man of Arizona and Todd Demsey and
Chris Stutts of ASU also were named
to the team. Burdick is now waiting for
a possible invitation to the NCAA West
Regional tournament in Provo, Utah.
Referring to the season, Goodwin
praised the talent and maturity of his
young squad, saying, "We've achieved
what we wanted."
