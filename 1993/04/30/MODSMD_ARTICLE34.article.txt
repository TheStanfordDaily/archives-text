# Rowers race Aggies, 49ers
## Stanford crews host regatta 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Closing out their home schedules, the Stanford
women's and men's crews look to tune-up for the
Pacific Coast Championships this weekend as they face
UC-Davis and Long Beach State at Redwood Shores.
Although the Cardinal women have defeated the
Aggies previously this year, women's coach Wendy
Davis does not want to look past them to the champi
onships.
"We just want to beat them, survive and get out of
there," Davis said. "With midterms going on now and
tiying to peak for championships, it's been a tough
week of practice."
Davis sees little competition coming from Long
Beach State, who brings in only a varsity boat of four
and a novice eight.
"Long Beach is just in there for fun," Davis said.
"They really wanted to race us sometime this year.
"The main concern is Davis' novice boat," Davis
continued. "If we can beat them, our novices should
move up two spots in the Pac-10 standings."
The iryuiy bug continues to annoy the women's
crew. Kate Steger and Sarah Morse both felt stiffness
in their backs from injuries they thought they had gotr
ten over. Davis plans to take it slowly with both of them
and is still unsure whether they will race Saturday or
not.
"There's a fine line between over-training and
under-training that we need to tiptoe around so no one
else gets injured," Davis said.
Instead of racing both Davis and Long Beach on the
same day, the men's crew will race the Aggies on Sat
urday and Long Beach on Sunday. Unlike the women,
the men have not raced Davis head-to-head this year.
Both teams were at the San Diego Crew Classic four
weeks ago, where Stanford's time was about 10 sec
onds faster than Davis'.
Stanford men's coach Wieslaw Kujda has not pre
pared specially his squad for this race, as he has kept
the Cardinal on its regular practice schedule and
focused on the Newport Regatta next weekend.
"The team will not be very rested for this weekend,"
Kujda said. "It's been hard to get things together after
losing to Cal, but we've stressed the positive rather
than the negative, and worked from there."
Kujda said his team is physically capable to race
with anyone, but what they must work on now is their
mental toughness.
"We have the courage to challenge, but we are a
fragile team mentally," Kujda said. "We haven't really
learned how to respond to stress during a race."
This weekend should prove to be a good warmup for
the Cardinal rowers. Kujda sees Long Beach State as
being the same caliber as the Aggies, so Stanford
should have little trouble putting away both schools
and moving on to Newport next week.
