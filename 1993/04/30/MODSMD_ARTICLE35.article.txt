## Tales of life, love and Melrose Place 
### 
Sometimes I can't decide if it's life in general
that sucks or just my life that sucks. Now don't
get me wrong, I'm no pessimist, the glass can be
half fu11... It just seems that I'm not dealing with
a glass but a Styrofoam cup, the kind that you get
coffee in at some AM/PM Minimart in the middle
of Cowdungland along the asphalt river of death
known as 1-5.
And what makes things really bad is that I live
in Cowdungland.
But enough of that. There are more important
issues to deal with.
I iike, what Is up with Billy and Allison? That's
the question.
First, however, let's get this straight: I'm not a
pop-culture addict — my musical taste is too eclec
tic, my fashion sense too antediluvian and my pock
et IxKik too anorexic. But there's something that's
driving me nuts: what's going on with tho6e two?
OK, OK, it's not a big deal. I realize that stupid
Aaron Spelling is just a Neener trying to make
moolah, since that show with his mangled-looking
daughter is continuing to flail. But there's some
thing about bloody Melrose Place that keeps me
watching, and I think it has to do with vicarious
living.
For all ye who art uninformed, listen up. We
have Billy and Allison (played by Andrew Shue
and Cortney Thorne-Smith) who are rooming
together in the oh-so-Californian apartment
complex called Melrose Place. Billy was a starv
ing writer/cab driver (he recently got a job for
Spin magazine) and Allison does some kind of
job where she has to put up with stupid Aman
da (Heather Locklear) all day — but I'm get
ting ahead of myself.
They are going to hook up eventually, that was
evident from day one. But the thing is, there's a
long time in between day one and next week when
they finally do.
You see, Allison gets together with a married
man. Bad move. Billy is tormented but doesn't do
a thing. They break up. She needs surgery. Billy is
there for her. Oh, so close.
Later, Billy gets caught up with Amanda. Alli
son is tormented. He moves in with Amanda.
More torment. They break up. Allison gets close
to spilling her guts when the married guy comes
back in the picture, now freshly divorced. Woah.
Allison and Married Guy decide they want
back in. Billy is tormented. They move off to Seat
tle together. More torment for Billy. Then Allison
comes back because Seattle stinks. It's getting

perkier.
Things then get cat-fighty between Allison and
Amanda at the office, with Billy caught in the mid
dle. Amanda tries to seduce Billy again, but he
resists. Allison finally decides to do something. It's
late, Billy comes home. Allison is waiting. She grabs
him, they kiss, she goes to bed — alone. The end.
Dizzying, I know.
Here's where the vicarious living part comes
in. You see, I have no love life. As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure what the words "love" and
"life" mean, much less what they would be doing
in the same sentence together. The only reason I
even know the phrase is because I think I read
about it somewhere or one of my roommates
knows about it or something, I don't know.

And plus, Billy and I are almost the same per
son. Take away his good looks, fit body, cool apart
ment, attractive female roommate and nice career,
and add love handles, poor vision, a quad on the
row with stinky, slobbering guys, plus a mediocre
existence writing papers and working to pay for a
college education, and Billy and I are equals.
Basically, the Josh Walker Female Situation
ain't so hot. Then again, it ain't cold, lukewarm or
anything in between — it just ain't.
So when a guy who might as well be me is
about to hit it off with a woman who is as great as
Allison, how can I help but get excited?
I know, Billy has his shortcomings, and Alli
son, she's not quite all there either. But you have
to understand, those are the faults of the lousy
writers. Billy and Allison aren't really like that.
They are only written that way to keep helpless
yutzes like me from watching some other equally
idiotic show Just to get a glimpse of maybe 30 sec
onds of what their true characters are like. As a
matter of fact, the whole affair thing and the
whole Amanda thing, and the whole back into the
affair thing never really existed, that was just TV
hoopla.

So why my interest? Why do I make an effort
to curl in front of the TV with a glass of lemonade
and a bowl of gummi bears with a bunch of
friends who all have somewhat-significant others
and watch some totally fabricated romance play
out before my pitiful eyes?
Because I can empathize with unrequitiesence.
I don't think it needs to be called unrequited love
— love is an alien concept that I must have a hor
rible allergic reaction to — unrequited like will do.
It seems that all failure in my life can be
attributed to the "B" word — "but." There's:
"You're great, I like you a lot, you mean a lot to
me, but..or, "You're so nice to me. My life is
better having known you. You're my best 1- —d,
but..." Need Igo on?
But those are only cases that reached the
state of confrontation. The ones that haven't are
just as depressing. For example, I have actually
had conversations where she asked me advice on
how to approach some guy she liked. Really.
Hey, I can live with being a pathetic, dork
faced, stupid-headed Neener — no problem. But
the thing is, there are people who don't think I
am. That only makes the whole thing even worse.
Note this conversation I had the other day:
Me (with typical goofy look on face): Hi!
Her (she has a guy she's interested in): Oh, you
look so cute.
Me: Huh?
Her: You have such a cute look on your face
(makes cooing, goo goo noises).
Me: 0h... thanks.
(I start to walk away.)
Her: Josh, do you have a girlfriend?
Me (feeling great at this point): No.
Her (with a puzzled, disbelieving tone in her
voice): No? Why not?
Me: Don't know.
Her (genuinely concerned and daunted, sort of
a what-are-all-those-women-out-there-thinking
type of thing): I don't understand it.
(She walks off shaking her head in disbelief.)
I did not make any of this up.
So where does this leave me and my untapped
potential? Yelling at the television in terror when
Amanda kisses Billy? Rushing to refill my bowl
during the commercials? Yelling some more? Get
ting sick of this wish-fulfillment thing? Yes, to all
of the above.
Ahhhhh!
Oh well, at least I have a date every Wednesday
night.

in. You see, I have no love life. As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure what the words "love" and
"life" mean, much less what they would be doing
in the same sentence together. The only reason I
even know the phrase is because I think I read
about it somewhere or one of my roommates
knows about it or something, I don't know.

And plus, Billy and I are almost the same per
son. Take away his good looks, fit body, cool apart
ment, attractive female roommate and nice career,
and add love handles, poor vision, a quad on the
row with stinky, slobbering guys, plus a mediocre
existence writing papers and working to pay for a
college education, and Billy and I are equals.
Basically, the Josh Walker Female Situation
ain't so hot. Then again, it ain't cold, lukewarm or
anything in between — it just ain't.
So when a guy who might as well be me is
about to hit it off with a woman who is as great as
Allison, how can I help but get excited?
I know, Billy has his shortcomings, and Alli
son, she's not quite all there either. But you have
to understand, those are the faults of the lousy
writers. Billy and Allison aren't really like that.
They are only written that way to keep helpless
yutzes like me from watching some other equally
idiotic show Just to get a glimpse of maybe 30 sec
onds of what their true characters are like. As a
matter of fact, the whole affair thing and the
whole Amanda thing, and the whole back into the
affair thing never really existed, that was just TV
hoopla.

So why my interest? Why do I make an effort
to curl in front of the TV with a glass of lemonade
and a bowl of gummi bears with a bunch of
friends who all have somewhat-significant others
and watch some totally fabricated romance play
out before my pitiful eyes?
Because I can empathize with unrequitiesence.
I don't think it needs to be called unrequited love
— love is an alien concept that I must have a hor
rible allergic reaction to — unrequited like will do.
It seems that all failure in my life can be
attributed to the "B" word — "but." There's:
"You're great, I like you a lot, you mean a lot to
me, but..or, "You're so nice to me. My life is
better having known you. You're my best 1- —d,
but..." Need Igo on?
But those are only cases that reached the
state of confrontation. The ones that haven't are
just as depressing. For example, I have actually
had conversations where she asked me advice on
how to approach some guy she liked. Really.
Hey, I can live with being a pathetic, dork
faced, stupid-headed Neener — no problem. But
the thing is, there are people who don't think I
am. That only makes the whole thing even worse.
Note this conversation I had the other day:
Me (with typical goofy look on face): Hi!
Her (she has a guy she's interested in): Oh, you
look so cute.
Me: Huh?
Her: You have such a cute look on your face
(makes cooing, goo goo noises).
Me: 0h... thanks.
(I start to walk away.)
Her: Josh, do you have a girlfriend?
Me (feeling great at this point): No.
Her (with a puzzled, disbelieving tone in her
voice): No? Why not?
Me: Don't know.
Her (genuinely concerned and daunted, sort of
a what-are-all-those-women-out-there-thinking
type of thing): I don't understand it.
(She walks off shaking her head in disbelief.)
I did not make any of this up.
So where does this leave me and my untapped
potential? Yelling at the television in terror when
Amanda kisses Billy? Rushing to refill my bowl
during the commercials? Yelling some more? Get
ting sick of this wish-fulfillment thing? Yes, to all
of the above.
Ahhhhh!
Oh well, at least I have a date every Wednesday
night.

Sometimes I can't decide if it's life in general
that sucks or just my life that sucks. Now don't
get me wrong, I'm no pessimist, the glass can be
half fu11... It just seems that I'm not dealing with
a glass but a Styrofoam cup, the kind that you get
coffee in at some AM/PM Minimart in the middle
of Cowdungland along the asphalt river of death
known as 1-5.
And what makes things really bad is that I live
in Cowdungland.
But enough of that. There are more important
issues to deal with.
I iike, what Is up with Billy and Allison? That's
the question.
First, however, let's get this straight: I'm not a
pop-culture addict — my musical taste is too eclec
tic, my fashion sense too antediluvian and my pock
et IxKik too anorexic. But there's something that's
driving me nuts: what's going on with tho6e two?
OK, OK, it's not a big deal. I realize that stupid
Aaron Spelling is just a Neener trying to make
moolah, since that show with his mangled-looking
daughter is continuing to flail. But there's some
thing about bloody Melrose Place that keeps me
watching, and I think it has to do with vicarious
living.
For all ye who art uninformed, listen up. We
have Billy and Allison (played by Andrew Shue
and Cortney Thorne-Smith) who are rooming
together in the oh-so-Californian apartment
complex called Melrose Place. Billy was a starv
ing writer/cab driver (he recently got a job for
Spin magazine) and Allison does some kind of
job where she has to put up with stupid Aman
da (Heather Locklear) all day — but I'm get
ting ahead of myself.
They are going to hook up eventually, that was
evident from day one. But the thing is, there's a
long time in between day one and next week when
they finally do.
You see, Allison gets together with a married
man. Bad move. Billy is tormented but doesn't do
a thing. They break up. She needs surgery. Billy is
there for her. Oh, so close.
Later, Billy gets caught up with Amanda. Alli
son is tormented. He moves in with Amanda.
More torment. They break up. Allison gets close
to spilling her guts when the married guy comes
back in the picture, now freshly divorced. Woah.
Allison and Married Guy decide they want
back in. Billy is tormented. They move off to Seat
tle together. More torment for Billy. Then Allison
comes back because Seattle stinks. It's getting

perkier.
Things then get cat-fighty between Allison and
Amanda at the office, with Billy caught in the mid
dle. Amanda tries to seduce Billy again, but he
resists. Allison finally decides to do something. It's
late, Billy comes home. Allison is waiting. She grabs
him, they kiss, she goes to bed — alone. The end.
Dizzying, I know.
Here's where the vicarious living part comes
in. You see, I have no love life. As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure what the words "love" and
