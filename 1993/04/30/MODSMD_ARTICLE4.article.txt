# Groups may feel pinch from new refund plan
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, voters in the ASSU elec
tion approved a record $1.5 million in stu
dent-group special fees.
But the funding windfall may be offset
by the passage of another item on the ballot
— an amendment to the ASSU Constitu
tion that makes fee refunds available to all
students, including those who do not vote.
The bill's victory has muddled the con
fusing fee-refund picture even further,
spawning a wave of speculation on exactly
how much money student groups will re
ceive from the ASSU next year, and beyond.
'Taxation without representation?*
Since funding for student groups ap
proved on the ballot comes directly from
students' quarterly ASSU fees, supporters
of the measure say the extension of refund
privileges to non-voters protects against a

situation of "taxation without representa
tion" — where students are required to pay
for groups that might not benefit them sim
ply because they did not vote.
"Student groups have flourished out of
student ignorance," said graduate senator
elect Neil Crellin, who, as deputy Senate
chair last year, authored the amendment.
"Basically, the fee-refund system is not well
understood by most students."
Crellin argued that the current ban on
non-voters receiving fee refunds hurts
graduate students unfairly. "Graduate stu
dents are both taxed for programs that do
not affect them and penalized for not voting
on those two obscure days in April, when
many graduate students are not on campus
in the first place," he said. "The motivation
for the amendment was to make refunds
available to those students who do not want
to be so taxed."
Loss of funds
While the bill may protect stu
dents from unwanted taxation, it
could in turn curtail the activity of
student groups that rely on special
fees.
Two such scenarios, however
farfetched, could unfold. The first
is the kind of campaign being pro
posed by the newly-formed Gradu
ate Student Tea Party: a drive to
encourage all graduate students to
claim refunds from the ASSU at
their first opportunity next fall.
"Basically it's a publicity infor
mation drive — we'll give explicit
instructions on how, when and
where to pick up fee refunds," said
electrical engineering graduate
student Michael Grant, one of the
party's charter members. Grant
said the party's intended goal is to
"make sure graduate students
realize they don't have to sit back
and accept taxation anymore."
Grant said the campaign aims
at exhorting student groups
tighten their financial belts. "I
think we could get a significant
turnout, and put a significant
dent into the funding for some
groups," he said. "It may not be
crippling, but we want to encour
age people to rethink what they're
asking for."
Hut how successful such an
effort will be is questionable. "The
fact that refunds will be more acces
sible won't have a significant differ
ence," Crellin said. "There won't be
a doubling of the refund rate."
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Christine Vargas, stu
dent groups lose about 20 to 25
percent of their proposed special
fee requests through refunds. As a
result, the budgets approved by
students already have built-in
"buffer" allocations intended to
account for funding withdrawals.
When asked how much of a dent
his party hoped to inflict on special
fees, Grant said, "about 30 per
cent." Vargas said a refund-rate
increase on that order would neces
sitate only a small hike on ASSU
dues, and not a drastic revamping
of student groups' budgets.
The second scenario the
amendment portends could be
more daunting to student groups:
the ASSU Bylaws state that in
order to receive their fee requests,
student groups must be approved
by not just a mtyority of voters,
but at least 15 percent of the total

student population.
With the voting incentive of fee
refunds now removed, some fear
that voter turnout may slip below
the 30 percent mark, thereby jeop
ardizing funding for all groups.
Only 38 percent of the electorate
voted this year.
"This amendment stands to
ream a lot of student groups,
which I don't think is a good
thing," said deputy senate chair
Derek Miyahara. "The system has
enough protection for students
who do nothing. We need to
remove restrictions and make it
easier for groups to do things."
But Crellin said voter turnout
might not be decreased, but
encouraged by the new amend
ment. "I think this will reduce the
complacency of student groups," he
said. "There is very little self-pro
motion by these organizations."
Crellin said the threat of low
turnout will force student groups
to "increase awareness on what
these groups do, and in turn lead
to greater support for them."
Separating graduates?
While Miyahara earlier this
year suggested lifting the 15 per
cent threshold, Crellin and Grant
offered a different proposal.
Both agreed that one possible
solution to the fee-refund dilem
ma is to separate undergraduate
and graduate voting results. If
undergraduates approve a group
that graduates reject, they should
bear the burden of cost, and vice
versa. Such an amendment could
be placed on next spring's ballot.
"If this plan was passed, under
graduates might have larger fees
than graduates," Grant said. "But
that makes sense anyway."
A representative for one student
group acknowledged that the onus
of their funding may be inequitably
distributed, since most of the
group's participants are undergrad
uates, but said a decrease in fund
ing would have its effects.
"It would give us problems,"
said MEChA treasurer Jose Gar
cia. "If there is a limit on the
amount of money we receive, we'll
have to prioritize our activities.
We'll have to scale down our
expenses."
The Graduate Student Tea
Party maintains that such sacrifice
may be the only means to a fairer
system of special-fee funding.
"To be frank, we want to make
people hurt next year, to make
them honest, so that next year we
can pass another amendment and
give graduates a little more con
trol," Grant said.
