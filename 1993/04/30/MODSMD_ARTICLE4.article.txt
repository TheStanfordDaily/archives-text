# Groups may feel pinch from new refund plan
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, voters in the ASSU elec
tion approved a record $1.5 million in stu
dent-group special fees.
But the funding windfall may be offset
by the passage of another item on the ballot
— an amendment to the ASSU Constitu
tion that makes fee refunds available to all
students, including those who do not vote.
The bill's victory has muddled the con
fusing fee-refund picture even further,
spawning a wave of speculation on exactly
how much money student groups will re
ceive from the ASSU next year, and beyond.
'Taxation without representation?*
Since funding for student groups ap
proved on the ballot comes directly from
students' quarterly ASSU fees, supporters
of the measure say the extension of refund
privileges to non-voters protects against a

situation of "taxation without representa
tion" — where students are required to pay
for groups that might not benefit them sim
ply because they did not vote.
"Student groups have flourished out of
student ignorance," said graduate senator
elect Neil Crellin, who, as deputy Senate
chair last year, authored the amendment.
"Basically, the fee-refund system is not well
understood by most students."
Crellin argued that the current ban on
non-voters receiving fee refunds hurts
graduate students unfairly. "Graduate stu
dents are both taxed for programs that do
not affect them and penalized for not voting
on those two obscure days in April, when
many graduate students are not on campus
in the first place," he said. "The motivation
for the amendment was to make refunds
available to those students who do not want
to be so taxed."
