# Fac Sen examines graduate issues
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
While University President
Gerhard Casper's "State of the
University" address yesterday
focused primarily on under
graduate education, the Facul
ty Senate discussed graduate
student housing issues and
doctorate oral examination
committees.
ASSU graduate senator
Kevin Murdock opened the
meeting by inquiring about the
priority of graduate student
housing within the administra
tion.
In response to this question,
Provost Gerald Lieberman said
the University's first priority is
"to understand and correct"
any inadequacies in undergrad
uate housing caused by the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,
while also providing under
graduates with four years of
housing.
Lieberman said the Univer
sity is also currently looking at
options for increasing graduate
student housing, such as build
ing flexible housing that could
be designated for graduates or
undergraduates depending on
demand.
While a new Graduate
Housing and Issues Group has
been established to examine
future graduate housing possi
bilities, Lieberman empha
sized the importance of cur
rent flexible options, saying
that it would take two years for
additional permanent housing
to be built.
Lieberman said after the
meeting that he is taking the
problem of graduate housing

very seriously, but added that
nothing definitive can be done
until the issues group com
pletes its study on the status of
graduate housing.
According to Lieberman,
Stanford already provides 42
percent of its graduate stu
dents with housing, a figure he
says is one of the highest
nationally.
Murdock said after the
meeting that the administra
tion has been very cooperative
so far in dealing with this issue,
and he was glad to hear that
graduate student housing is an
important issue.
The second half of the meet
ing was devoted to discussion
regarding the role and selec
tion of doctorate oral exam
chairs.
The senate debated whether
a chairperson should be a neu
tral arbiter from outside the
department or a person who
has some knowledge of the
material and thus can control
the quality of the exam. Cur
rently, chairpersons' roles vary
by department.
After a long discussion that
focused on the actual function
performed by a chair, the sen
ate passed a proposal stating
that the definition of a chair
person be ambiguous so that a
chairperson can be either a
quality controller or umpire,
depending on the individual
exam.
This proposal, which kept all
old rules and exemptions,
emphasized the fact that chairs
should come from the Academ
ic Council, and students should
not be required to select chairs
themselves.
