Irish -American studies?
While beer, shamrocks and lep
rechauns may come to mind, a
small group of students has start
ed a serious campaign to bring
knowledge of Irish-American cul
ture to Stanford.
Sophomore Chip Curran is
gearing up efforts to create both
an Irish-American studies class
and an Irish-American student or
ganization. He met with 11 people
in White Plaza yesterday to dis
cuss both the class and organiza
tion.
Having talked with many stu
dents, Curran believes there will
be sufficient interest in both the

class and the student organiza
tion, even in the face of Universi
ty-wide budget cuts.
"There are 40 million Irish-
Americans and 3 million people
living in Ireland," Curran said.
But because Irish immigrants are
so assimilated into American cul
ture, "you can't just look up all the
people whose last names start
with 'O' in the phone book," he
said.
Curran hopes the University
will create an introductory course
that would explore Irish-Ameri
can issues, perhaps taught
through the Anthropology or His
tory Department. Curran con
ceives of a class that would cover
the unique contributions that
Irish-Americans have made to
American culture, beginning with
the massive Irish immigration in
the 19th century. But he said he
has not yet discussed the topic
seriously with faculty.
Last year, Curran took a
SWOPSI course titled "North
ern Ireland — Europe's Forgot
ten War." However, Stanford
Workshops on Political and
Social Issues classes no longer
exist and the only other course
dealing with Irish issues is a lit
erature class taught through
the English Department, Cur

ran said.
In addition to a course, Cur
ran hopes to create an Irish-
American student organization.
The club would be open to peo
ple of all ethnic backgrounds
who are interested in Irish and
Irish-American issues. There
would be a focus on current
issues, such as the crisis in
NoftlrefTT'tfetffnd. The club
would also sponsor social
events, including an occasional
keg of Guiness, he said.
After publicizing his efforts,
some people called to ask Curran
if he was joking. But he insists he
is 100 percent serious. "My pur
pose is to join other people in a
journey to rediscover my roots,"
Curran said, who added that he
supports all ethnic organizations

on campus, and thinks there is
room for more.
Curran, who is part Irish,
traces his Irish heritage to his
great-great-grandfather who
lived in Southern Ireland. Not
wanting to pay the British tax
collector, Curran's distant rela
tive tied him to a cow in "a sexu
ally compromising position."
After forcing the Englishman to
eat the tax papers, Curran's rela
tive came to the United States to
avoid legal punishment.
Curran said he became more
motivated to form the group
after talking about Irish Republi
can Army bombings with a child
hood friend who now lives in
London. When Curran asked his
dorm-mates what they knew
about the crisis in Northern Ire

land, people of both Irish and
non-Irish backgrounds said they
knew very little.
"The main reason I'm doing
this is most Irish-Americans are
hopelessly out of touch with their
roots," Curran said.
Some students at the meeting
yesterday expressed doubts that
the University would see Irish-
American issues as multicultural.
Others, however, were more con
fident.
"The Irish have been screwed
over just as much as any obvious
ethnic group," freshman Rebecca
Sparling said.
Curran hopes to organize his
efforts this quarter so that the
club can be in place to recruit
freshman during next year's Ori
entation.
