# Conductor gives life to a 'living art form'
## Symphony's first female leader takes the podium 
### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
J. Karla Lemon conducted her first concert
at age eight.
"I used to give concerts in my house— and
charge admission," said Lemon, the newly ap
pointed conductor of the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra. "I'd put on a record and conduct
it."
It wasn't until she was 15 that Lemon
started seriously studying conducting, even
tually majoring in music at UC-Berkeley. She
has since won several student and profession
al conducting awards, including recognition at
the 1988 National Endowment for the Arts
Affiliate Artists Conducting Competition.
Growing up in the Bay Area, Lemon had
early exposure to the "rich reputation" of
Stanford's music department. When she
takes the podium for the first time in Septem
ber, replacing current conductor Robert
Black, she will be the first woman to hold the
post — a distinction she tends to downplay.
"I think of myself as a conductor — not a fe
male conductor," Lemon said. "But I am in
what has traditionally been a man's field and
there are certainly challenges and, perhaps,
fewer opportunities."
Currently conductor of the San Francisco
State University Symphony, Lemon professes
a deep commitment to student orchestras,
partly because today's students are tomor
row's season subscribers.
"Because of funding problems, live music
as an art form is becoming rarer and rarer,"
she said. "But there's nothing more thrilling
than sitting in an auditorium, hearing a sym
phony and watching the players sweating and
the bow strings breaking and the rosin flying.
It's a unifying experience, not just for the au
dience but for the performers.

"Everyone is working together to realize
the context or intent of the piece," she added.
"It's a living art form."
Although Lemon hasn't yet chosen the
Symphony's 1993-94 repertory, she said she
would like to play "something for everyone."
"I like to present a mix of traditional and
new works," she said. "I always try to include
a new work in a program — something written
in this century, or even a world premiere. I'm

also interested in digging up the lesser-known
works of the masters."
Lemon plans to present more concertos, as
well as symphonies by Mahler, Stravinsky,
Brahms and works by American and women
composers. She also hopes to collaborate with
student composers and vocalists, including
the Stanford Chorale.
