# Fee hike
## New students in fall of '93 will pay $110 'document fee' 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Beginning fall quarter, new
undergraduates and most first
year graduate students will be
charged a $110 "document fee"
to cover official transcript and
Career Planning and Placement
Center expenses.
The new fee will only apply to
matriculating students and will
replace per-use fees for the ser
vices. Students currently en
rolled in Stanford will no longer
pay piece fees for official tran
scripts or CPPC services, nor
will they pay the document fee.
The fee for students of the
Medical, Law and Business
schools will be $55 for tran
script services only, because
those schools run their own
placement services.
For all students, the fee can
be waived in cases of financial
hardship.
Currently students have the
option to pay a $20 fee per acad
emic year to set up a reference
file and participate in on-cam
pus recruiting at the CPPC.
Alumni pay $75 to set up a ref

erence file. These fees will be
abolished beginning July 15.
Official transcripts now cost
$4 each. This fee will no longer
exist as of the start of the 1993-
94 academic year.
The document fee was ap
proved by the University cabi
net after making its way
through the Cabinet Commit
tee on Budget and Strategic
Planning. The new fee is expect
ed to raise $145,000.
Margaret Ann Fidler, direc
tor of administration for the
vice provost of student affairs,
said students, faculty and staff
participated in various commit
tees that discussed and recom
mended the new fee.
Fidler said the recommenda
tions were not made without
reservation, but added the fee
was seen as the best compro
mise — if the new document fee
was not approved, the older per
use fees would have been raised
for all students in order to meet
budget shortfalls. Other cuts in
services might also have been
necessary, she said.
"We had thousands of small
transactions that were expensive
to collect," Fidler said. "We are
eliminating the little fees and
putting into place this one-time
fee, so we don't nickel and dime
people later."
CPPC Supervisor of Records
Roger Kuhn said the new system
"will make us a lot more efficient,
because we won't have to process
so many checks. We can concen
trate on getting files sent out in a
timely manner."
However, Kuhn pointed out
that many students may not ben
efit from the fee because they do
not use the recommendation file
services of the CPPC.
According to Kuhn, the prima

ry users of the service are those
students who are applying to pro
fessional or graduate schools.
Alumni who use the service are
usually applying for jobs in teach
ing positions or to post-doctoral
scholar positions.
But most students and alumni
look for jobs in the private sector
and do not usually use the CPPC
recommendation services, Kuhn
said.
Fidler also acknowledged that
some students will not be heavy
users of the services covered by the
fee. "Every time you simplify,
some will get more than their
money's worth, some less," she
said, adding that a lot of the
income from the current system of
per-use fees comes from alumni.
David Bradfute, a fifth-year
graduate student in Biology, was
involved in the Cabinet subcommit
tee that looked at the new fee pro

posal. Bradfute said the subcommit
tee looked on the proposal favorably
because it didn't have a negative
impact on services provided.
One possible drawback of the
new fee, Bradfute said, is that
students could abuse free ser
vices.
"However, Stanford students
are responsible enough to know
whether or not they need a ser
vice," Bradfute said. "I think this
was a right call."
But junior Jason Snyder, a
Council of Presidents member
elect, said he did not share Brad
fute's excitement about the new
charge.
"It's another fee that is being
placed on students," said Snyder.
"The fee might not be as damag
ing as the trend is — which is to
lump costs on the students. It just
raises the overall cost of coming
to Stanford."
