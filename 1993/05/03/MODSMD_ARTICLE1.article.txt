# Fee hike
## New students in fall of '93 will pay $110 'document fee' 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Beginning fall quarter, new
undergraduates and most first
year graduate students will be
charged a $110 "document fee"
to cover official transcript and
Career Planning and Placement
Center expenses.
The new fee will only apply to
matriculating students and will
replace per-use fees for the ser
vices. Students currently en
rolled in Stanford will no longer
pay piece fees for official tran
scripts or CPPC services, nor
will they pay the document fee.
The fee for students of the
Medical, Law and Business
schools will be $55 for tran
script services only, because
those schools run their own
placement services.
For all students, the fee can
be waived in cases of financial
hardship.
Currently students have the
option to pay a $20 fee per acad
emic year to set up a reference
file and participate in on-cam
pus recruiting at the CPPC.
Alumni pay $75 to set up a ref

erence file. These fees will be
abolished beginning July 15.
Official transcripts now cost
$4 each. This fee will no longer
exist as of the start of the 1993-
94 academic year.
The document fee was ap
proved by the University cabi
net after making its way
through the Cabinet Commit
tee on Budget and Strategic
Planning. The new fee is expect
ed to raise $145,000.
Margaret Ann Fidler, direc
tor of administration for the
vice provost of student affairs,
said students, faculty and staff
participated in various commit
tees that discussed and recom
mended the new fee.
Fidler said the recommenda
tions were not made without
reservation, but added the fee
was seen as the best compro
mise â€” if the new document fee
was not approved, the older per
use fees would have been raised
for all students in order to meet
budget shortfalls. Other cuts in
services might also have been
necessary, she said.
