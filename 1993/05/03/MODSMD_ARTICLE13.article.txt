## Split Editorial Irish studies: classy

STANFORD IS YET again
coming up short in its cur
riculum offerings, as seen by
the student-recognized absence of
an Irish-American Studies class.
A class addressing Irish-Ameri
cans, their heritage or their immi
gration is not to be found in this
year's Courses and Degrees,
despite the existence of many
other classes offered through the
History Department exploring
topics and heritages such as "Mod
ern Jewish Identity," "History,
Gender, and Religion — Women in
Muslim and Zoroastrian Societies"
and"The American Character."
With the elimination of SWOP
SI programs which would be able
to fill such a void, the financial
burden of adding a class relating
to Irish-American issues may be
problematic. But as for the intel
lectual need, Stanford faculty and
staff members have a wide range

of backgrounds and expertise and
the University would not be hard
pressed to find at least one profes
sor interested in teaching this sub
ject.
Although budget cuts are obvi
ously of concern, the quality of our
education must not be affected by
administrative downsizing —
Stanford owes its students a wide
variety of classes that incorporate
different backgrounds, heritages
and viewpoints. The absence of an
Irish-American Studies class begs
the question whether or not this
obligation is being met.
It's not too much to ask — we
have majors formed around
African and Afro-American Stud
ies, East-Asian Studies and Amer
ican Studies — and the least the
University can do is to offer a sin
gle class that incorporates the
lives and history of at least 40 mil
lion Irish-Americans.
