WELL, IT SOUNDS like a
good idea. Somewhat odd,
perhaps, but good.
But as the road to hell is paved
with good intentions, the path to
fractionalization and isolation is
likewise often embarked upon by
people with only the best of pur
poses. The Irish-American Studies
class that has recently been pro
posed is a case of just such a diver
gence of idealism and reality.
In establishing a class designed
to inform students of the experi
ences and contributions of Irish-
Americans in the United States,
the proposed course would likely
accentuate the divergent aspect of
multiculturalism that has taken
root at the University. This is in
direct opposition to the more
benign ideal of the concept, which
declares that the forces that bind
people together are stronger and
more important than those that
drive them apart.
Those departments which have

already been created address eth
nicities which have unquestion
ably unique cultural and historical
backgrounds, with few elements
which overlap the European
focused mindset that has been
prevalent at universities.
To establish a Irish-American
studies class, outside the context
of a larger "European Immigra
tion" or similar course, would be
setting a dangerous precedent. If
Irish-American Studies is ap
proved, why not German-Ameri
can Studies? How about a Scot
tish-American class? Armenian-
American? Croatian-American?
What the existence of these classes
would imply is that even if you are
an American, you are, first and
foremost, a (fill-in-the-blank)-
American, not someone who can
identify yourself primarily with
other (fill-in-the-blank-with-a-dif
ferent-word)-Americans. This is a
dangerous path upon which to
embark.
