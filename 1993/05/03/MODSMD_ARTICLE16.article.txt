## Attention! Sex! Seinfeld! 
### 
ATTENTION! All I want is your
attention — a small piece of it for
a short time. If I can keep your
mind and eyes from wandering for just a
couple of minutes, I'll be satisfied.
I'm not the only one asking for your
attention. It's a valuable commodity, and
everyone wants a piece of it. But please,
give me a chance.
There are several ways I could try to
get and keep your attention. I could try
SEX!
Good, now that I've got your atten
tion, I'd like to talk about. ..
And then proceed to my "main point,"
which would be something decidedly less
interesting than sex but, because I
aroused your libido with those big, for
bidden letters, you would be so excited
that you couldn't help but read on.
Lots of fliers and posters around cam
pus use this eye-catching tactic. Not only
does it grab the attention of people who
stop to read billboards, it also draws in an
audience that wouldn't normally take the
time to read fliers, but who can't resist an
appeal to their primal urges. These are
the same people that respond to posters
reading "BEER!" or "FOOD!"
The problem is, the people whose
attention is captured by these monosyl
labic grunts are often the same ones that
have the most trouble reading. So, even if
"SEX" triggers an interest, there's no
guarantee that they'll get through the

fine print.
Still, lots of flier-makers prefer the
"SEX!" tactic. It's much more appealing
than
ATTENTION!
Good, now I'd like to talk a little bit
about sex. . .
Because "ATTENTION!" is what every
one is asking for — it's too common and
hence too unnoticeable.
Ironically, though, the tactic of allur
ing passers-by with the word SEX! has
become so popular that it has lost its
shock value.
People have started trying other
things. I saw a flier that read
JERRY SEINFELD
Has nothing to do with this.
This clever ad went on to give me
information about "great summer jobs."
I was so eager to read about Jerry Sein
feld that the flier was able to force-feed
me a bunch of information before my
excited attention wore off.
I couldn't help but feel a little cheated,
though, like I had put my trust in that
flier and it betrayed me.
And I understand if you feel the same
way — I have used a couple of cheap
tricks to lure you into my column. For
one, I've broken it into short paragraphs.
Supposedly, readers are turned off by
long paragraphs because big chunks of
text seem to require more attention to
"stick with it" to the end.

I reasoned that if my column looked
easier to read, I would capture more peo
ple's attention.
Also, there is an empty space where
my picture usually is. I hoped you would
think, "Oh no! Where did Rob go? Is he
OK?" or "Ohmygosh, he's invisible!" and
then read my column to discover the
mystery.
But I confess, it was a hoax . .. I'm OK.
And I'll admit, too, I was hoping that
when you saw my picture missing you'd
let out a little "Ooh" or an intrigued
"Hmm," and that would get other peo
ple's attention. And then maybe people
around you would ask what's wrong, or
even come over to look at what you're
reading.
And then, hopefully, other people
would see everyone standing around you,
and they'd want to see what the big fuss
was all about and why everyone was
standing around. And they would come
over, and this process would continue
until throngs of people surrounded you
and I had captured everyone's attention.
If this actually happened, I'm sorry.
All I wanted was a little attention.
