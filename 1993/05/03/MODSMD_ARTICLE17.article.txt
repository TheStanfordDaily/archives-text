Journalists must divorce personal beliefs from work

I THINK SUSAN FALUDI is a great
journalist. Actually, one of the great
est.
At her speech in Dinkelspiel auditori
um on Wednesday, "Backlash after the
year of the woman," she amply dis
played her skills of research and her
ability to build a story. What worried
me, however, was whether it was Faludi
the journalist or Faludi the feminist
who was speaking. The distinction is
important, I think, and not an example,
I hope, of the sexism she so powerfully
chronicles.
I get nervous when journalists, espe
cially the great ones, become so associat
ed with particular issues that they are
asked to become the spokespeople of
great causes. Because, when this hap
pens, journalists lose their power as
voices of public conscience.
As Stanford Knight Fellow Faludi
herself has said, she came to the profes
sion with the muck-raking, hard-fight
ing, ideals-driven journalists of the turn
of the century as her models. I believe
that often characterizes the best, the
most caring professionals in the coun
try's newsrooms.
What you write about usually does
reflect your passions. How you write
about it, though, and how you behave

on the field, even if it's the "field of
moral combat," reflects your profession
alism.
Otherwise, it isn't called journalism.
And when you're a journalist and
anyone asks you casually "what you
think" or "what they should do" about a
situation, there's only one truly profes
sional answer: "You can see my com
mentary when it's in print."
It's extraordinarily hard to do.
If you're Susan Faludi, recently
crowned champion by an eager nation
of one of the most important causes of
our time, it must be a thousand times
harder. On Wednesday evening, before
a cheering, adulating, crowded auditori
um, Faludi tried to wear the caps of
both journalist and activist at the same
time.
You do not renounce your citizen's
right to an opinion when you're given a
press pass. You do, however, have the
difficult responsibility of keeping the
two lives separate.
Even harder, you also have the
responsibility of making sure the public
sees you as such. "Caesar's wife must
not only do no wrong, she must also
appear to do no wrong."
If you don't, you compromise the
moral authority of both positions.

Faludi shocked America and the
world into a new awareness with
"Backlash." It may seem a pointless
waste of the power to make a difference
which her book has given her, if she
withholds her opinion from public plat
forms.
But the role of the pulpit and the role
of the observer, even the involved, sub
jective observer, are different from each
other.
It isn't possible to be both at the same
time, and it isn't possible to be both at
different times, without compromising
the only real and abiding strength of the
journalist: legitimacy.
In the first draft of this letter, I also
disagreed with much of what she said
last Wednesday. She seemed content to
jab at the ironies of media coverage of
feminism. She outlined nine basic meth
ods the media employs to hurt the femi
nist movement.
In so doing, she seemed to simplify
the issues. Evil men in boardrooms are
not the dangerous enemies of the femi
nist movement: The real evils are often
committed by nice people who don't
know better.
Her nine signs to watch for can be
misused to stall virtually all criticism of
the feminist movement â€” intolerance is

dangerous, even when practiced by the
side which is "right."
But the real issue, I think, is the
deeper one of the journalist's legitimacy.
That would stand even if she hadn't sim
plified so much, even if she hadn't,
unfairly, quoted George Bush when he
said he hoped that women would lose a
recent election.
Faludi may have more to offer to
America and the world than a re-awak
ening of purpose in the feminist move
ment.
She may yet change the way we think
about racism, about poverty, about
crime. She may even have much, much
more to offer in the realm of the femi
nist movement itself.
But she cannot hope to do so, she can
not hope to be seen beyond the title of a
"feminist-leader," as the voice of social
conscience, if she compromises her legit
imacy as a journalist.
By playing the role of spokesperson,
either competently or otherwise, Faludi
is throwing away her strength.
That isn't good news for journalists.
And that isn't even good news for femi
nists. And it isn't good news for me.
Because I'm both.
