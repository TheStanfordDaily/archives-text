# Nefarious ducknapper begged to return lawn pet to Theta Chi house
## 
### 
We at Theta Chi House want our
lawn duck back. As we are writing, three
motherless ducklings sit crying on our
lawn. Some time during the witching
hours of the night, dastardly malignants
ducknapped a valued member of the
Theta Chi community. Spring is a time
when baby ducklings need their mother,

and we at Theta Chi want our friend
back.
We do not want our duck to become
another Soto dog. This letter is not
intended to provoke some cheesy
human-interest story by The Daily. On
the contrary, it is a simple plea to the
guilty parties. Theta Chi residents are
not the only Stanford affiliates who
delight in our plastic lawn ornamenta
tion. The Stanford Bursar, the Housing
Center and Haas Center staffs and
numerous others have commented on
the pleasure they receive from being
greeted by our flock each morning on

their way to work.
We understand the envy which might
provoke such a heinous act. Many of us
know what it was like to grow up with
out lawn ornaments. We are not selfish
with our birds; a kindly neighbor will
soon be borrowing our flamingos for her
party with our blessing. We are a co-op,
and would like to cooperate with the
bad eggs who stole our duck. Please
return her, and no questions will be
asked. Call Theta Chi House with any
information.
