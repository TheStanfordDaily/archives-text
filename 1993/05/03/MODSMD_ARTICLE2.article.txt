# Combating crime
## Response team discusses assistance for East Palo Alto 
### Jake Dorman Staff writer 
Two Stanford staff representa
tives attended a meeting with local
and state politicians and law en
forcement officials recently as
part of an innovative effort to es
tablish East Palo Alto as a model
for reducing crime in other cities.
"We were there to listen and to
learn about the needs of East Palo
Alto and to share information
with the communities that are in
volved with Stanford," said Mary
Bartlett, the University's assis
tant director of public affairs.
The primary focus of the meet
ing was to coordinate state and
local law enforcement efforts and
utilize existing state agencies such
as the Bureau of Alcohol Control
to combat crime in East Palo Alto,
which had the highest rate of mur
ders per capita in the United
States last year. While Stanford
will not directly contribute money
or police, the University will offer
its time and ideas to the effort.
At the meeting, Bartlett in
formed the state and local officials
about Stanford's current efforts
in East Palo Alto. According to a
report on community involvement
released by Stanford's Office of
Public Affairs, 43 out of Stan

ford's 140 public service programs
— 31 percent — are aimed at East
Palo Alto.
San Mateo County Supervisor
Ruben Barrales reported that
there is also an effort on the part
of local officials to utilize Stanford
expertise in areas such as land
management.
"We're hoping that Stanford
will be able to take an even more
active role in these programs," he
said.
In particular, Barrales men
tioned a possible program to use
Stanford athletic facilities for a
summer youth camp for East Palo
Alto children.
According to both Bartlett and
Barrales, Stanford is not expected
to contribute officers or revenues
directly to East Palo Alto.
Andy Doty, Director of Com
munity Relations, explained that
Stanford lacks the tax-gathering
powers of a municipality.
Stanford commercial lands
which lie within Palo Alto city lim
its — such as the Stanford shop
ping center and the Oak Ridge
apartment buildings — earn that
city $29.7 million in tax revenue a
year, none of which goes to East
Palo Alto.
"The University's principal mis
sion is to serve the students who
are paying tuition, rather than to
aid distant areas," Doty said.
The unified effort is an
attempt to turn East Palo Alto
into a model for other communi
ties, according to Barrales.
Since last April, forty officers
from Palo Alto, Menlo Park, the

San Mateo Sheriffs Department
and the California Highway
Patrol have doubled the size of the
East Palo Alto Police Department.
It was announced at the meet
ing that the California Highway
Patrol will stay in East Palo Alto
indefinitely in order to bolster the
city's police department.
"What we're doing now is a
first," said Palo Alto Police Chief
Chris Durkin. "It's highly unusu
al that it's working so well."
A total of 41 people participat
ed in the meeting, including offi

cials from the U.S. attorney's
office, the governor's office and
California's Departments of Jus
tice, Corrections, Criminal Jus
tice and Health. The session was
also attended by mayors, city
managers, police chiefs and city
council members from the cities
of Palo Alto, East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park. Local officials expect
another meeting with the state
team on June 9 to follow up on
this meeting.
"It's going to be a long pro
cess," Barrales said.
