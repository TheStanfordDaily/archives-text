## Devils stage rally, take two of three 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — "We didn't
play well, but we won."
Arizona State baseball coach
Jim Brock knows the fine line
between winning and losing in
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division. The front-running
Sun Devils took two of three
games from last-place Stanford at
Packard Stadium this weekend.
However, the difference
between a series win for No. 2
ASU (40-17 overall, 17-10 Six-
Pac) and the unranked Cardinal
(23-22, 8-16) proved to be no more
than heads-up baserunning and a
few timely hits in the 10th inning
of yesterday's rubber match. The
Devils took the opener 7-1, and
Stanford won the second game 5-
3. Arizona State captured the
series with a come-from-behind 9-
8 victory yesterday.
In Friday's opener, Arizona
State's Marc Barcelo faced the
Cardinal's Willie Adams in a
matchup which, statistically
speaking, featured the two best
pitchers in the Six-Pac. Coming
into the weekend, both Barcelo
and Adams were ranked among
the top four in the conference in
earned-run average, wins, strike
outs and complete games.
Stanford struggled all night
against the hard-throwing Barce
lo. In the eighth, catcher A.J.
Hinch walked, stole second and
scored the Cardinal's only run on
a Rich Crowe pinch-hit single.
Barcelo, who won both of his
decisions against Adams this sea
son, said he enjoys the challenge
of facing the Cardinal
righthander.
"It's exciting to go against a
potential All-America," Barcelo
said. "He'll keep them in the game,
and I'll keep us in the game."
Andrew Lorraine certainly
kept Stanford in Saturday's
game. The lefty, who had never
won a game following an Adams
loss, pitched a complete-game
gem, allowing only two earned
runs against the Devils, who lead
the Six-Pac in runs scored.
ASU starter Dax Winslett had
limited the Cardinal to five hits
through eight innings and
appeared to be in control entering
the ninth with a 2-1 lead.
"I felt strong," Winslett said. "I
had been throwing strikes all day.
I had my stuff until the very end."
Winslett, who threw over 130
pitches, looked strong in the
beginning of the ninth. With one

out and Todd Laßocca on first,
Winslett worked Rod Meyer to an
0-2 count. But Meyer, who had
been hitless in three trips against
Winslett, stroked a two-strike
fastball into center field for a base
hit.
Second baseman Jeff Des-
Jardins stepped to the plate with
two outs and the bases loaded. It
was DesJardins' error that had
allowed the tying run to score two
innings earlier.
With a full count, DesJardins
lined a game-winning single to
left.
"That's almost the nature of
baseball," said Stanford assistant
coach David Esquer. "The guy
who makes a mistake often gets a
chance to redeem himself."
Lorraine, who lost a 3-1 deci
sion to Winslett at Sunken Dia
mond, held on in the ninth for his
seventh victory. "Andrew
deserved this win," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess.
The left-handed Devil bats of
Jacob Cruz, Doug Newstrom,
Antone Williamson and Cody
McKay entered the series with a
combined .334 average. They
went 1-for-17 against Lorraine.
Veteran Greg Mix took the
mound for the Cardinal yester
day, looking to lead Stanford to
its first Sunday Six-Pac victory of
the season.
With Stanford up 5-2, Mix
gave way to Dan Reed in the
fourth. Reed, who entered the
game in a bases-loaded, no-out
situation, responded with per
haps the best outing of his career.
The freshman lefty hurled five
solid innings, leaving the game
with a 7-4 lead after walking the
first batter he faced in the ninth.
But ASU tied the game at
seven without hitting the ball out
of the infield. The key to the Sun
Devils' three-run rally came with
two outs and Stanford holding a
slim 7-6 lead. With Newstrom
striding to the plate, Sal Carde
nale caught the Cardinal napping,
stealing third base before Cardi
nal reliever Matt Marenghi threw
his first pitch to Newstrom.
The play proved essential, as
Cardenale scored the tying run on
a Newstrom infield single. The
Devils won the game and the
series with two runs in the bot
tom of the 10th.
