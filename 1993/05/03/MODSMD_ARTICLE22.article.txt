The Stanford men's tennis
team couldn't have ended its reg
ular season on a higher note. The
eighth-ranked Cardinal (19-4)
dropped only one set as it demol
ished unranked Washington 8-0
on Friday. Saturday was a similar
story, as the Cardinal crushed
unranked California 7-2 at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
In less than 90 minutes, the
Cardinal seized a 4-0 lead over the
Huskies. At No. 4 singles, junior
Chris Cocotos put away Jason
Harnett 6-2, 6-2 in less than an
hour. Freshman Jeff Salzenstein
quickly followed suit at No. 5 with
an easy 6-1, 6-0 pounding of Ste
fano Rampazzo.
In quick succession, No. 2 hit
ter Robert Devens produced a
solid 6-4, 6-0 win over UCLA
transfer Robbie Wendell, and on
the back courts, Ricky Becker, at
No. 6, breezed by Matthias
Fritsch 6-0, 6-3.
"They looked pretty good in
Ojai (at the Pacific 10 Individual
Championships), and we were

ready to go against them today,"
Cocotos said of the Huskies.
"This is kind of shocking."
Junior Vimal Patel brought
home the next victory for the Car
dinal with a 6-1, 7-6 win over
Mark Tomandl in the third slot.
Second and third doubles
began next, while Stanford's top
hitter, sixth-ranked Michael
Flanagan, battled furiously on
Court 1 with No. 26 Chet Crile.
Patel and Devens were pulled
out of the doubles lineup, bump
ing Salzenstein and Jim Thomas
up to No. 2, where they cruised to
a 6-3, 6-1 win over Harnett and
Tomandl.
At third doubles, team captain
Roman Sydorak and junior Billy
Wright captured the team's seventh
"W" of the day with a 6-0, 6-1
trouncing of Fritsch and Rampazzo.
Finally, after 2 hours and 40
minutes, Flanagan prevailed over
Crile 7-6, 6-7, 6-3. "Michael did a
nice job once he settled down,"
said Stanford coach Dick Gould.
"He got better as the match went
on."
