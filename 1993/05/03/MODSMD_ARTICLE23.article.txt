# Spikers stopped short of Final Four shot

There will be no national championship
for the Stanford men's volleyball team this
year.
On Friday night, the Fifth-ranked Long
Beach State 49ers (18-13, 14-8 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) slammed the
door on Stanford's season, 15-13, 10-15, 15-
9, 15-11 in the MPSF semifinals. The sec
ond-ranked Cardinal (18-6, 16-5) needed to
defeat the 49ers and capture the tourna
ment championship Saturday in order to
advance to the NCAA Final Four in Los
Angeles next weekend.
In Saturday's Final, Cal State-Northridge
defeated the 49ers in four games, leaving
the four teams competing for the National
Championship as UCLA, Ohio State, Penn
State and the Matadors.
"Long Beach played outstandingly," said
Cardinal coach Ruben Nieves.
Olympian Brent Hilliard struck gold for
the 49ers. Held to sub-par outings in the
two regular-season meetings of the teams
(both of which Stanford won handily), last
year's National Player of the Year had a
match-high 43 kills on 78 swings to hit
.385. He also added three blocks, seven digs
and an ace to lead his team to victory.
Part of Hilliard's increased production
can be attributed to some 49er lineup-shak
ing. Hilliard began the season and started

both matches against Stanford at opposite
hitter, a position that gets most of its sets
in the outside lanes of the court. In Friday's
match, however, Hilliard played instead as
a middle blocker while in the front row,
returning to opposite hitter while in the
back row. This switch resulted in more
quick sets to the middle for Hilliard, which
he subsequently pounded away.
"I thought we slowed Hilliard down
enough," Nieves said. "But we could not
contain Holloway and Barr."
David Holloway and Travis Barr play the
two swing hitter positions for Long Beach
State and were on fire offensively. They
combined for 39 kills and only nine errors,
hitting .531 and .448, respectively. Hol
loway also chipped in three blocks and 10
digs.
The Cardinal, which had one of its poor
est showings of the season against UCLA on
Wednesday night, was unable to rebound
completely on the Bren Events Center floor
Friday. Statistically, several individual
players showed improvement, but the team
as a whole had several lapses that would
eventually cost Stanford a national title
shot.
"We made critical mistakes," Nieves
said.
One major lapse occurred on the defen
sive side of the net. In fact, the Cardinal
had more digs and more blocks than the
49ers, but the crucial defensive statistic is

the opposing team's hitting percentage. In
Friday's match, Long Beach State hit .407,
well above its season average. Stanford, on
the other hand, hit .370, 30 points below its
season average.
Individually, three Cardinal players
stood out: swing hitter Bob Hillman had 24
kills and only five errors to hit .432; middle
blocker John Hribar tallied 19 kills to hit
.593; and setter Canyon Ceman had 103
assists, his second-highest total on the year
and the fourth-highest mark in Stanford
history.
Cardinal opposite hitter Dave Goss
bounced back from one of his worst outings
of the year against UCLA to record a
match-high 14 digs. He also had 36 kills,
but took 84 swings to hit .262.
"Long Beach slowed Goss down at the
net," Nieves said. "Goss got frustrated and
made hitting errors."
In a bittersweet end to the season, the
American Volleyball Coaches Association
announced its All-American team yester
day, and the Cardinal was well-represented.
Ceman and Goss both became two-time Ail-
Americans; furthermore, Ceman was
named National Player of the Year, the
most prestigious individual award in the
country.
"I am very honored to be chosen,"
Ceman said. "Without our team success,
however, I would not have received the
award."
