### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
As the regular season nears its finish, the Stan
ford track and field team is beginning to come
alive. This weekend at the Chico Invitational, the
Cardinal qualified athletes in four more Pacific 10
Conference Championship events while compet
ing against a field of small schools.
Highlighting Stanford's achievements, senior
long jumper Jason Robinson reached a lifetime
best with a leap of 24 feet, 4 inches to run away
with first place and a Pac-10 qualifying mark in
that event.
"During my sophomore year, everyone thought
I should be a 25- footer," Robinson said. "After
three years of injuries and disappointment I'm
really happy to finally jump the 24-4, but I'm still
aiming for 25 feet at the Pac-lOs this year. That
would be an excellent way to end my career at
Stanford."
Joining him in Berkeley for the Pac-10 finals at
the end of the month will be hammer thrower
John Fowler, who hurled a lifetime best 190-6 to
take first place in the event. That throw also qual
ifies him as the fifth seed in the Pac-10 Champi
onships, only six inches off the No. 4 seed.
"The guy seeded before me is a notorious chok
er," Fowler said. "He's this guy from Cal, and I
think I can take him and probably finish fourth or
third at the Pac-lOs."
Fowler's throw also improved his all-time best
by an unheard-of 4 1-2 feet. "I had a so-so perfor
mance at Mt. SAC two weeks ago, and I really
worked hard on fine-tuning my technique all of
last week. The rest and the extra pointers on my
technique helped gain me those extra feet — next
I'll be aiming for the NCAAs."
Pole vaulter Jamie Marek also qualified for the
conference championship as he cleared the bar at
16-7, good for an automatic-qualifying mark and a
first-place finish in that event.
For the women, Christy Boyd became the
team's third two-event qualifier as she will be
running the 400-meter hurdles along with the 100
hurdles at the Pac-10 Finals.
A specialist in the 400 hurdles, Boyd has suf
fered a season-long frustration in that event, while
she ran several personal bests in her ofT-event, the
100. After sprinting to a lifetime best 61.21 sec
onds in the 400 hurdles at Chico, however, Boyd is

back among the fastest in the conference.
"That race really took a burden off of my shoul
ders," Boyd said. "I was close last year on a lot of
occasions, but I would always die at the end. This
time I went out hard and finished hard. My steps
were on, and everything fell into place."
In addition to the Pac-10 qualifiers, sprinters
Rhonda Oliver and Monica Hoggatt finished first
and third, respectively, in the flat 400. Oliver, who
has already qualified in this event, dropped her life
time best to 54.87, while Hoggatt finished in 56.97.
Laura Hayward outdistanced the field in the
3,000 by clocking a seasonal best 10:12.7. Dena
Dey, Pac-10 qualifier in the 800 and 1,500,
improved her 800 mark to 2:10.21 — a full second
faster than her previous best.
For the men, Eric Spayde took first place in the
1,500 with a 3:55.20 mark, and freshman sprinter
Rene Rodriguez set a blazing pace in the 400 to
win in a time of 47.97. Sophomore Travis Clark,
who has an NCAA provisional-qualifying mark in
the high jump, inched closer to the automatic
mark by clearing the bar at 7 feet, three-quarters
inches.
"We were definitely due for an great perfor
mance," Fowler said. "Everything clicked into
place on Saturday: good track, good weather and
good competition. Now our sights are set on Cal
and the Pac-10 Finals."
"The Chico meet served our purposes," coach
Vin Lananna said. "We qualified more people for
the Pac-lOs, and the overall outcome of the meet
gives us momentum going into the Big Meet this
week."
The Cardinal squad will face off against the
Golden Bears at home on May 9. While the Stan
ford women have raced California to a virtual
standstill over the years, the Cardinal men have
suffered a 20-year losing streak at the hands of
Cal.
"Right now they have a great team, and we have
the makings of a great team," Lananna said. "I
couldn't ask to be in a better position. We're just
very excited and enthusiastic about this young
team, and the rebuilding is working out perfectly."
"I wish I was a sophomore or a freshman so I
could come hack next year for a championship sea
son," said Robinson. "This year the team is final
ly uniting and gaining tremendous team spirit.
Stanford is definitely the team to watch in the
future."
