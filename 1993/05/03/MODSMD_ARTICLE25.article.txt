# Women's golf grabs third at home
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
In a windy weekend at the Stanford Golf
Course, the Cardinal women's golf team finished
third in a four-team field at the California Inter
collegiate Invitational this Saturday and Sunday.
Stanford's cumulative total of 625 placed it behind
powerhouse San Jose State, which won the tour
nament with a 609, and USC, which followed with

a 621. Washington finished fourth with a 650.
Stanford was led by senior captain and first
team All-Pacific 10 Conference selection Martha
Richards (73-74), who finished third among indi
vidual scorers. San Jose State's Lisa Walton (70-
74) took the individual title, while teammate
Tracy Hanson (72-74) finished second.
Other Stanford finishers included sophomore
Jamille Jose (76-79, seventh place), junior Melinda
Daniels (78-80, eighth), freshman Vicky Strada
(78-83, 10th) and sophomore Amy Lawrence (81-
84, 18th). Three additional Stanford golfers,
Kathryn Weber (75-79), Sara Hallock (81-91) and
Julie Bowen (83-81), played as independents.
San Jose State's team, considered by many
observers to be the best collection of amateur
women's golfers of all time, won the tournament
easily, outshooting USC by 12 and Stanford by 16.
"I would say this is the best team I've ever had, in
terms of depth and individual play," said San Jose
State coach Mark Gale. "It really shows itself in
the fact that we've won 15 out of our last 16 tour
naments."
Stanford was in second place after Saturday's
first round, behind strong individual performances
from Richards, Jose, Daniels and Weber, but shot a
team total of 317 on Sunday to fall to third. The
second day of the tournament was plagued by a
strong wind that made putting difficult. "As a
team, I didn't think we did that well," said
Richards. "The wind probably affected our play,
but wind or no wind, it's still our course, and we
need to play it well."
Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin felt that above all
else, the tournament was an educational experi
ence for his team. "This was just a small get
together of four excellent golf teams to help get
our games together, and keep the momentum that
we've had recently going," Baldwin said. "We
played well for 27 holes, but then when we hit the
back nine today, we just hit a wall and started
throwing away strokes "
Baldwin believes that the third-place finish will
help the team concentrate more in next week's
NCAA regional play, regardless of the weather
conditions present. "These kinds of things in golf
are very sobering to the players," Baldwin said.
"Wherever we go for regionals or NCAA Champi
onships, we'll have to play in rough weather condi
tions."
Richards and the Cardinal golfers are looking to
improve on their confidence and putting as they
head into the postseason. "We need to expect more
out of ourselves and believe that we can play good
golf, because we have all year," Richards said.
NCAA Western Regionals will be held at Tucson,
Ariz., May 12 through 14.
