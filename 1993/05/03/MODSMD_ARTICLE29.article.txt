John C. Shepherd, a former
chairman of the Hoover Institu
tion's board of overseers and for
mer head of the American Bar
Association died Friday at age 67.

Shepherd joined the board in
the late 19705, and was "a very
important board member," said
Hoover Assoc. Director and
Senior Fellow Thomas Henriksen.
"He was extremely courteous,
even courtly in his manner, very
friendly," he said.
Henriksen said Shepherd was

instrumental in helping the insti
tution land the $7 million-plus
Volker trust in about 1977. That
trust, used to study domestic
issues, is still the largest single
gift to Hoover, he added.
Shepherd was picked to head
the national attorney's group in
1984.
