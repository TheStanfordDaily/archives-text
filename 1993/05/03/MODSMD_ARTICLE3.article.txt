Many of the people who control education
at Stanford — the faculty — joined Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper this weekend in
calling for a reevaluation of undergraduate
education at Stanford, particularly the dis
tribution requirement system.
But as professors praised Casper's pro
posal in Thursday's "State of the Universi
ty" address to form a commission to evaluate
Stanford's undergraduate education, dis
sent arose among the faculty regarding just
how to change the system and Casper's ra
tionale for proposing the change.
During his address, Casper criticized the
distribution requirement system, saying "it
is still unclear what we as a university expect
the student to gain from this guided tour of
our many disciplines."
To formally investigate "undergraduate
curriculum in light of the changing needs of

our students," Casper announced a plan to
establish a 15-person Commission on Under
graduate Education.
Provost Gerald Lieberman said Casper's
proposal is analogous to the 1968 Study of
Education at Stanford — the last compre
hensive study of the undergraduate curricu
la to examine undergraduate education.
Such an evaluation process is important to
decide what is appropriate to emphasize in
today's learning, Lieberman said.
Assistant Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences Ellen Woods said this
reevaluation — especially of the distribution
requirements — is definitely needed.
According to Woods, the current system
which was established in 1980 is outdated,
having been amended only twice; first in
1988 with the addition of Cultures, Ideas
and Values and again in 1990 with the addi
tion of a gender studies requirement and a
renumbering of the requirements.
"A lot of things have to be taken into con

sideration that are different now from when
the system was put into effect," especially
the increase in undergraduate research and
honor theses, Woods said.
Classics Prof. Susan Treggiari, who says
she believes in the educational concept of
"depth rather than breadth," also agreed
with Casper's questioning of the useful
ness of the current distribution require
ment system.
Echoing Casper's call to focus on the es
sentials of undergraduate learning, Treggia
ri described the current system as being set
up in a such a way that it forces students to
delay serious work on their major.
However, Civil Engineering Prof. David
Freyberg said he disagrees with this reason
ing.
Freyberg, chairman of the Academic
Council Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, said he feels the distribution require-
