# Faculty agree with Casper's plans to reevaluate undergrad education
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Many of the people who control education
at Stanford — the faculty — joined Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper this weekend in
calling for a reevaluation of undergraduate
education at Stanford, particularly the dis
tribution requirement system.
But as professors praised Casper's pro
posal in Thursday's "State of the Universi
ty" address to form a commission to evaluate
Stanford's undergraduate education, dis
sent arose among the faculty regarding just
how to change the system and Casper's ra
tionale for proposing the change.
During his address, Casper criticized the
distribution requirement system, saying "it
is still unclear what we as a university expect
the student to gain from this guided tour of
our many disciplines."
To formally investigate "undergraduate
curriculum in light of the changing needs of

our students," Casper announced a plan to
establish a 15-person Commission on Under
graduate Education.
Provost Gerald Lieberman said Casper's
proposal is analogous to the 1968 Study of
Education at Stanford — the last compre
hensive study of the undergraduate curricu
la to examine undergraduate education.
Such an evaluation process is important to
decide what is appropriate to emphasize in
today's learning, Lieberman said.
Assistant Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences Ellen Woods said this
reevaluation — especially of the distribution
requirements — is definitely needed.
According to Woods, the current system
which was established in 1980 is outdated,
having been amended only twice; first in
1988 with the addition of Cultures, Ideas
and Values and again in 1990 with the addi
tion of a gender studies requirement and a
renumbering of the requirements.
"A lot of things have to be taken into con

sideration that are different now from when
the system was put into effect," especially
the increase in undergraduate research and
honor theses, Woods said.
Classics Prof. Susan Treggiari, who says
she believes in the educational concept of
"depth rather than breadth," also agreed
with Casper's questioning of the useful
ness of the current distribution require
ment system.
Echoing Casper's call to focus on the es
sentials of undergraduate learning, Treggia
ri described the current system as being set
up in a such a way that it forces students to
delay serious work on their major.
However, Civil Engineering Prof. David
Freyberg said he disagrees with this reason
ing.
Freyberg, chairman of the Academic
Council Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, said he feels the distribution require-
ment system was established to
achieve good ends but has been
hindered by faulty means.
"There is a purpose behind
the system and the language of
the requirements speaks specifi
cally to why we have them,"
Freyberg said.
Some faculty members, too,
called for increasing emphasis on
a broader-based education, espe
cially in areas of multicultural
ism and residential education.
Education Prof. Myra
Strober said multiculturalism
needs to be further incorporated
into the curriculum because
"the world is becoming more
internationalized by the
moment and we need to give

more people a real in-depth
understanding of [all aspects]
another culture."
She cited Casper's statement
that Stanford has "not gone far
enough in acquainting all of our
students thoroughly with at
least one other culture" as a
good first step.
Strober, a resident fellow in
Schiff from 1985-87, also said a
stronger emphasis should be
placed on the value of residen
tial education, including the
possibility of more dorm-based
programs as part of a new set of
requirements.
While there is faculty senti
ment that this call for a reevalu
ation is needed, some say the
proposed commission should
focus on issues beyond distribu
tion requirements.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who also believes

the distribution requirements
are a good part of a Stanford
education, said he thinks Casper
proposed conflicting ideas in his
address.
According to Abernethy,
Casper's suggestions will not
shorten the time needed for an
education — an idea Casper has
put forth in the past — unless
there are specific steps to elimi
nate some requirements.
Yet while Casper said he
would like to reevaluate the use
fulness of some of the require
ments, he also said he would like
a stronger emphasis placed on
some areas of learning, such as
foreign languages and American
civilization.
In response to Casper's sug
gestion that one way to help
ease the University's financial
burdens would be to eliminate
some majors, Lieberman said

this is not a definitive solution
but just one idea to examine.
Overall, Freyberg said more
emphasis is needed on the prod
uct of an education, rather than
the process. He said he believes
this can be accomplished by hav
ing the commission look at hin
drances to undergraduate edu
cation.
He said questions such as
why the faculty is not rewarded
more for outstanding teaching
or why there is such little inter
departmental communication
regarding the curriculum need
to be addressed.
Abernethy said while he
thinks it is "a good idea to [peri
odically] rethink what we are
doing and how we are doing it,"
he said he does not feel the pro
posals Casper made in his
speech will actually solve any
problems.
