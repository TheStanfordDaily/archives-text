Not only do they have jobs, but
they can field too.
For only the second time in
history, the Knight Fellows —
those sagging journalists who are
given a year off by their employ
ers in hopes of rejuvenating their
productivity — won the annual
Knight Fellow-Stanford Daily
softball game yesterday.
Led by a triathlete captain
who was only peripherally con
nected to the Knight Fellow pro
gram (marriage), the Knights
won a come-from-behind 11-10
victory in the final inning.
Knight Fellow and pop-femi
nist Susan Faludi was noticeably
missing, and the Knights looked
to capitalize on her absence. In
the final inning, Mr. Triathlon
attempted to put an all-male
squad on the field, until other
Kiiights, fearing the diminutive
Faludi would get word of the inci
dent, shoved a token woman in
right field. No balls were sent her
way by The Daily.
After the game, the Knights
looked happy, but incredibly tired
as signs of decrepitness showed
through their less-than-pulchri
tudinous grimaces.
Ah, the pen is mightier than
the Louisville Slugger.
Not only do they have jobs, but
they can field too.
