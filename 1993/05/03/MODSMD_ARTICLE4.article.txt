Gerardo Estrada aims his ball gun as his
friends wait their turns in one of numerous
booths at the Haas Center's Stanford
Community Carnival at the Florence
Moore fields last Saturday. Each booth
was sponsored by a dorm or other cam
pus groups. In another booth, Kristy
Devoe paints Diane Tuiaki's face as she
eats her cotton candy. The day-long event
brought dozens of Stanford students in
contact with hundreds of area children. In
addition to game booths, carnival-goers
could enjoy free sno-cones, popcorn and
cotton candy. Student performers, includ
ing several a capella groups and the im
provisational comedy troupe Sponta
neous Generation, entertained the tykes at
the carnival.
