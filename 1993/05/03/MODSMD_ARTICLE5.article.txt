Calling for self-sufficient leadership and self-ex

prominent Latina leader Antonia Hernandez told
an audience of 150 on Friday night that the initia

to stand blindly behind leadership without ques

She also emphasized the need for Latinos to "de

For example, Chicano/Latino parents "have the
right to demand a quality education. Language is a
large barrier [but] schools that are serious usually
have facilities for [communicating with) non-Eng
lish-speaking parents," she said in an interview
after the speech. "It's a matter of the schools mak

parents are there."
The first step in encouraging her community's
