### Nami Kim 
Calling for self-sufficient leadership and self-ex
amination within the Chicano/Latino community,
prominent Latina leader Antonia Hernandez told
an audience of 150 on Friday night that the initia
tive to raise the community's standard of living
must come from within.
Hernandez, president and general counsel of
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educa
tion Fund, was the keynote speaker for the eighth
annual Ernesto Galarza Lecture. Her national ad
vocacy group of 23 lawyers uses law, education and
research to protect the Chicano/Latino communi
ty's access to financial equity, public schools, high
er education and political activism.
"We have in our community the creativity, the
talent to be part of the solution, and it's within our
power to control our destiny," Hernandez said.
"The solution must come from us.
"I come about change from an entirely different
perspective," Hernandez said. "I see change as in
cremental and slow, because real change takes a lot
of work, a lot of commitment and a lot of time."

Hernandez cited her organization as an exam
ple, pointing out that the group stresses future-ori
ented projects and "looks for the long haul. Only in
this decade will we see the fruits of fmy group's 1
labor that we have worked for 25 years."
Hernandez struck out against what she sees as
a tendency within the Chicano/Latino community
to stand blindly behind leadership without ques
tioning its nature, stressing that such apathy re
tards the entire community's development.
She also emphasized the need for Latinos to "de
mand accountability and integrity" through par
ticipation in political and educational systems.
For example, Chicano/Latino parents "have the
right to demand a quality education. Language is a
large barrier [but] schools that are serious usually
have facilities for [communicating with) non-Eng
lish-speaking parents," she said in an interview
after the speech. "It's a matter of the schools mak
ing sure that the parents have priority and that the
parents are there."
The first step in encouraging her community's
active participation in the world
requires introspection, Hernan
dez said.
"We must face aspects of our
culture that are not so wonderful.
"I speak as a woman and as a
Latina. The machismo within our
culture needs to addressed," she
said.
This process will include the
empowerment of Chicano women
in the political world and as role
models for the Chicano family.
Hernandez pointed to her
group as an example of female
leadership and role models. The
legal fund is itself highly unique
because for 17 of its 25 years of
existence, it has been run by a
woman, Hernandez said, adding
that women also comprise most
of the staff.
Besides praising the growing
strength and unity of women,
Hernandez also embraced the
concept of both sexes combining

their efforts. "We must walk
hand in hand with our brothers,"
she said.
The Chicano/Latino communi
ty, she added, is still seen as a
group, and until all can be seen
collectively in a positive light,
"none can escape. We are all
painted with the same brush
stroke."
When asked if the prospect of a
Chicano population majority in
California will empower the com
munity, Hernandez replied that
"If we're poor, illiterate and une
ducated, it won't mean very
much."
Junior Victor Madrigal said he
was impressed by Hernandez's
emphasis on the role of Chicana
women in the community. "I
think it's about time for women
like her and many others to take
the lead," he said.
Senior Bianet Castellanos
called the speech "very empower
ing. I've noticed that through my
years here at Stanford that the
women have been the ones who
have fought and have been the
foundation."
