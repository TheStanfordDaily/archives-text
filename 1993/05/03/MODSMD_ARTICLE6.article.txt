# Combining markets and education
## Experts push solutions for America's failing schools 
### Neerad Lai Staff writer 
To rescue America's faltering schools, education
and capitalism might have to converge through pro
grams such as school choice and vouchers, several pan
elists said this weekend at a campus conference about
American education's future.
This new trend was one of many themes discussed
at the "Choice and Vouchers: The Future of American
Education," conference held Friday and Saturday at
the Hoover Institution.
Both government-sponsored and privately funded
educational vouchers were discussed, and one idea
proposed to strengthen the learning process in Ameri
ca was making schools competitive enterprises, similar
to businesses. Panelists framed this debate around the
Edison Project, an organization promoting the cre
ation of privately funded, for-profit schools.
Chester Finn, founding partner and senior scholar
of the project, said the concept raises some vital ques
tions.
"Is it legitimate to bring the profit motive into sec

ondary education?. .. And, is it necessary to start from
scratch" with a new school, as opposed to reforming
the status quo, Finn asked.
Senior Hoover Fellow Milton Friedman, a 1986
Nobel laureate in economics, argued that American
education has become a monopolized industry, just
like the post office and legislative assembly.
Since lower-income families cannot afford private
schooling, they must send their children to public
schools which can thus afford to be inefficient and in
effective, he said. Making schools compete for students
would cure this ill, he added.
"As long as costs are high for [good education], no
one will choose" that option said Friedman, who went
on to suggest that the privatization of K-12 education
would allow for "great variety and choice in the school
system."
However, School of Education Prof. Martin Conroy
argued that bringing in a choice for profit-oriented
schools would not attract students to one institution
more than another, because "parents want to send
their kids to a neighborhood
school."
Conroy advocated maintaining
and reforming the current system
of public education instead of pri
vatizing schooling.
Attendees said the conference

— which brought together officials
ranging from educational policy
makers to company executives
involved in reshaping American
education — generated much valu
able debate over how to help Amer
ica's children learn.
Linda Page, a school principal
for 17 years and presently manag
er of the Hughes Aircraft educa
tion program, said the debates in
the conference helped her to con

firm her stance on privately fund
ed education. "It was an incredible
conference," she added.
However, Mary Chambers, a
member of the board of trustees
for the Gateway School District in
Northern California, said she "was
disappointed that there weren't
enough educators in the panels.
"The people out there in the
field itself should have been here,"
she said.
