## Sec. of State Christopher skeptical of Bosnian peace plan 
### 
LONDON (AP) â€” Secretary of State
Warren M. Christopher was skeptical yes
terday that the signing of an international
peace plan by Bosnian Serbs would end
their ethnic cleansing campaign, but he fell
short of winning British support for mili
tary steps designed to force their hand.
At the start of a six-day European trip,
Christopher said the Serbs' signing of the
plan in Athens would not deter the United
States from trying to force an end to the
bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
"What really matters is what happens on
the ground," Christopher said, after speak
ing twice by phone to President Clinton.

"Whether the killing stops, whether the aid
is permitted to get into those who need it,
whether the heavy weapons are silenced,
whether the parties carry out their agree
ments."
Within hours of Christopher's remarks,
Bosnian Serb forces lobbed four shells into
Sarajevo, killing at least two people. Two of
the shells hit a police station near the presi
dency building.
Christopher then had dinner with
British Prime Minister John Major and
other British Cabinet ministers. He and
Pentagon officials outlined the air attacks
and lifting of the arms embargo against the

Muslims that Clinton tentatively has
approved.
The U.S. presentation elicited a joint
statement in which the British government
agreed to tiy to develop "a common position
with our partners and allies on stronger
measures to be taken if the Serbs fail to
implement the peace settlement."
Military steps are among the options
under consideration, the statement said. It
did not announce Britain's approval of Clin
ton's military strategy.
The statement began with an appeal to
the warring parties in the former Yugoslav
republic to come to a cease fire and imple

ment the peace agreement without delay.
In Washington, Clinton released a state
ment calling approval of the peace plan a
"positive step." But he said he will continue
planning for military force in case the Serbs
"do not act in good faith."
"We will judge intentions by actions,"
Clinton said in the statement.
Administration officials are concerned
that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadz
ic's signing of the international peace plan
in Greece was an empty gesture to avoid
military action from the West.
Christopher noted that the Serbs had
approved agreements in the past to end the

fighting but then went on with the war.
Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas said Clinton had decid
ed on allied aerial attacks on Serbian posi
tions and permitting weapons to get to the
outgunned Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegov
ina.
Dole said on ABC's "This Week With
David Brinkley" that Clinton had called to
tell him the two steps were the key elements
in the new strategy Christopher is pressing
the European allies and Russia to endorse.
Clinton decided on Saturday to take U.S.
strategy in a new and more forceful direc
tion, although he released few details.
