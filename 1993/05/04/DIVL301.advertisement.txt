SPECIES IN CRISIS:
POLITICS, LAW, SCIENCE, AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
Conservation groups, landowners, and industry representatives are now struggling with the highly contentious reauthorization
of the Endangered Species Act. Will the Act on its 20th anniversary emerge from the lobbying melee unscathed? Or will we
see significant changes in the numbers and kinds of species protected, in the protection of organisms on private lands, or in
the role of economics in the Act?

with a panel of the foremost experts on endangered species legislation and implementation:
Barry Noon, Phi), ecologist and director of the Redwood Sciences Laboratory, USDA Forest Service
Mark ohatfer, Phi), biologist and vice president for science ior The Wilderness Society
Victor Sher, managing attorney for the Sierra Gub Legal Defense Fund
