gladness and thanksgiving for Stegner's in
fluence and the works he left behind perme
ated the service. •

To sum up his feelings about the
writer's death, Stewart Udall, a for
mer Secretary of the Interior and
one of five men who paid tribute to
Stegner, borrowed a quote that
Stegner himself had penned years
ago in memory of photographer
Ansel Adams:
" 'He is not gone. We have him in
his works of art and later genera
tions will have him as well.' That is
the lecracv of this man." Udall said.

tribute of Wallace Stegner in Memorial Church yesterday.


Stegner
Wallace Stegner, but I've
learned even more about the
conduct of a human life," said
John Daniel, a former Stanford
writing student and current poet
and essayist.
Thomas Watkins, vice presi
dent of the Woodland Society,
said that he always felt Stegner's
presence while writing. "What I
wrote and how it appeared on the
page was influenced by his pres
ence. I will miss that more than I

can say.. . . Whom am I writing
for now?"
All five speakers praised Stegn
er as what Udall called an impor
tant interpreter of the American
West.
Because of his childhood on the
frontier, Udall said, Stegner was
able to accurately depict both the
harshness and the spirit of the
land.
"He saw the beauty of this
severe country and took it and
transmuted it later in his life into
his writing," he said.
Watkins said Stegner's work
had a great influence on Ameri
can life. "He gave us our history

— our true history. No one wrote
more effectively about the nature
of a life lived out on the land," he
said.
Because of his love for the land,
Stegner was also praised for being
an important figure in the environ
mental conservation movement.
"He kept reminding us that
without the land and the wild crea
tures in it, we were nothing,"
Watkins said.
Born in Lake Mills, lowa, on
Feb. 18, 1909, Stegner spent his
childhood moving around the fron
tier with his family as his father
searched for success.
He earned his bachelor's degree

from the University of Utah in
1930 and his master's and doctor
ate from the University of lowa.
Coming to Stanford in 1945, Steg
ner founded the Creative Writing
program in 1956. As a creative
writing teacher, Stegner helped
train a new generation of writers
including Ken Kesey, Larry
McMurty and Scott Turow. He
taught at Stanford until his retire
ment in 1971.
Stegner won several awards for
his writing, including the 1972
Pulitzer Prize in fiction for his
novel "Angel of Repose," and a
1977 National Book Award for his
novel "The Spectator Bird."
