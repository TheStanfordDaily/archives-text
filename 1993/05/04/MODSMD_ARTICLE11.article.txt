# Ignorance is not valid excuse
## Activist calls for military intervention in Bosnia 
### Lubna Qureishi 
When Nazis murdered six million Jews, the world
could say they did nothing from ignorance or disbe
lief; but according to William Sloan Coffin, today the
world can plead neither with respect to the "ethnic
cleansing" taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
"The media makes it impossible to hide what is
happening in Bosnia," said Coffin, president of Peace
Action, an organization that lobbies for decreased
military spending, nuclear disarmament and an end
to the international arms trade. "No one can say 'I
didn't know.' "
Speaking to an audience mainly comprised of area
residents at the Galvez House, Coffin — a former
chaplain at Yale University — supported multi
national intervention in Bosnia, saying that it would
be a moral tragedy if the world allows genocide to
occur as it did 50 years ago.
Urging military intervention in Bosnia, he criti
cized world inaction. "France and Britain are fearful
that air strikes would endanger lives. The United
States is also worried about the (human) cost of
sending ground troops," Coffin said.
Although Serb leader Radovan Karadzic signed an
international peace plan in Athens on Sunday, Coffin
said he was uncertain that this would bring peace to
the troubled area. He also feels that U.S. humanitar
ian aid is not an adequate way to resolve the situa

tion.
Deaths in the region are caused "far less from
starvation than by violence," Coffin claimed. "It
should be our primary goal to take up the gun to put
down the gun."
While acknowledging the complexity of U.S. inter
vention within the borders of another nation, Coffin
said that "averting the rights of a human catastrophe
should outweigh the consideration of national
sovereignty."
Coffin used the issue of domestic violence in the
United States to illustrate the necessity and urgency
for intervention.
"It used to be that domestic violence was accepted
in a paternalistic way," he said. "But the government
now intervenes; violations of law must be met with the
force of law." And therefore, he added, the America
must intervene in a sovereign state to stop its violence.
"Ethnic cleansing is worthy of international con
sideration," he said.
But in order for intervention to be effective,
nations must respect international law, Coffin said.
That, he said, means that violations of human rights
should equal violations of law.
Intervention "gives us a chance to do something
restricted and decent," Coffin said, even though he
does not think that the United States has a national
interest in Bosnia. "Our doing nothing says some
thing about the heart of who we are as a nation."
