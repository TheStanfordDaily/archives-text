No break for taxpayers
WASHINGTON (AP) - Overruling
objections by its own regulators, the
Bush administration agreed in its closing
days to shield accounting giant Ernst &
Young from lawsuits filed by officials of
failed thrifts.
As a result, future legal judgments
against the company in those cases will
be paid by taxpayers.
The recently discovered provision was
tucked into a settlement in which Ernst
& Young, while admitting no wrongdo
ing, agreed to pay the government $400
million to dispose of claims arising from
its work for three dozen failed banks and
savings and loans.
The government hailed the Nov. 23 set
tlement as a "tremendous achievement"
for taxpayers. But its announcement

excluded mention of the indemnification
clause.
German workers strike
BERLIN (AP) â€” Eastern German
steelworkers struck yesterday, clashed
with strikebreakers, drank free beer and
gathered at factory gates to demand their
promised pay after German reunification.
The strikes by 15,000 metal- and
steelworkers will test the resolve of labor
and business as Germany strains to
bring quick prosperity to the former
Communist eastern side.
Business organizations said they can
not pay the 26 percent wage increases
they promised steelworkers two years
ago. They warned that a prolonged strike
will lead only to more shuttered factories
in eastern Germany.
