# Europe resists force in Bosnia

### 
PARIS (AP) — Hesitant European
allies withheld approval of President
Clinton's strategy to use force in Bosnia
yesterday, pushing in the meantime for
peacekeeping troops to oversee the agree
ment signed Sunday by Bosnian Serbs.
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher said he was skeptical that the peace
agreement would hold up. But a senior
U.S. official on the trip said the United
States would support the plan if the
Serbs did follow through — and that U.S.
peacekeepers might be sent to Bosnia-
Herzegovina within days if the settle
ment is ratified by the Serbs' legislature.
The United States might commit
about 2,000 troops as part of a first
phase, diplomatic sources said.
Christopher, on a six-day trip seek
ing a consensus for Clinton's military
proposals in case the settlement fails,
got no assurances on stops in London

and Paris.
His task was shaping up as a test of
the Clinton administration's powers of
persuasion as well as of the strength of
the transatlantic alliance.
Christopher left Britain without spe
cific endorsement of either air strikes
against Serb artillery sites or the lifting
of a weapons embargo that has ham
pered outgunned Muslims in Bosnia-
Herzegovina.
And, arriving in Paris, Christopher
found the French government in a dis
sonant mood. Foreign Minister Alain
Juppe has described the division of tasks
in the U.S. strategy as unacceptable.
Juppe said that the planned U.S. air
role — while American ground troops
would be excluded from combat —
would mean "having some flying in
planes and dropping bombs and others,
the Europeans," searching for cover on

the ground.
France, with 5,000 troops in Bosnia
and Croatia on humanitarian missions,
is concerned that an allied assault on the
Serbs could expose them to new dangers.
The British and French prefer
putting the emphasis on such measures
as protecting civilians in Bosnian cities
and villages with "safe havens." The job
could require up to 50,000 troops.
But Christopher said he doubts that
the Bosnian Serbs intend to adhere to the
peace agreement their leader, Radovan
Karadzic, signed Sunday in Athens.
Already, other Bosnian Serb leaders
have questioned the plan, which calls
for a cease-fire, an interim government
in Sarajevo and establishment of 10
cantons along ethnic lines. They are
also hinting the Bosnian Serb assembly
would reject the plan tomorrow, as it
has rejected settlements twice before.
