## Editorial Opening the Cabinet 
### 
The University Cabinet
should be diversified by
rotation, outside input

WHEN THEN-University
President Donald Ken
nedy created the Univer
sity Cabinet in 1989, the purpose
was to streamline the decision
making process at Stanford. How
ever, as the foremost policy-mak
ing body in President Gerhard
Casper's administration, its lack of
diversity has to be questioned.
The Cabinet currently has its
collective hand in two very impor
tant and controversial policy deci
sions, one regarding the imple
mentation of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
and the other regarding the new
sexual-harassment policy.
The Cabinet consists of the
deans of the seven academic
schools, the provost, the directors
of the Hoover Institution and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and the dean of research. Of
these 12 individuals, only one is
female — Acting Dean of the
School of Education Nel Noddings
— and only one is a person of color,
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Ewart Thomas, who is stepping
down Aug. 31.
Although the Cabinet has appar
ently solicited outside input on both
policy matters, it seems ridiculous
that such a homogeneous body —
which doesn't come close to repre
senting the Stanford community —
should have the power to decide
such sensitive issues. It seems
rather ironic that while the Cabinet
tries to decide whether to use "tran
sculturalism" or "multicultural
ism" as the preferred term for Stan
ford's commitment to minority
issues, the same group can't claim
to have diverse and personal experi
ence on this topic.
The Cabinet was the correct
response to the bureaucracy that
was overrunning Stanford in the

late 1980s. The point is not that
Stanford should return to its
excessively bureaucratic ways; the
current system has been an effec
tive way to run the University.
However, those who are now part
of the Cabinet must address its
lack of diversity as a major issue.
One possibility would be to cre
ate a rotating system consisting of
four deans and three faculty mem
bers. If the positions were rotated
twice a year, there would be mini
mal disruption of the decision
making process.
The perspective of others not in
the administrative circle should be
included somehow. In addition,
with a rotating system, if deans
were only serving part-time this
would help pare down their
already hectic schedules. But most
importantly, it would allow for
fresh, and hopefully diverse, per
spectives on the multifarious
issues confronting Stanford.
If it would be too confusing to
rotate the deans, then the least
that should be done is to add one or
two permanent faculty positions.
The members could be elected for
one-year terms by the Faculty Sen
ate, giving that body — which has
been reduced to discussions of stu
dent housing and the passage of
bills reaffirming the current multi
purposefulness of oral-examina
tion chairpersons — more say in
University policies.
Most importantly, however, the
Cabinet should recognize its short
comings rather than pretending
the problem doesn't exist. Many
students have complained about a
lack of student input in the new
sexual-harassment policy. The Cab
inet must take complaints like this
even more seriously than they
might otherwise because of the
Cabinet's inherent lack of diversity.
The Cabinet's lack of women
and minorities puts its judgement
in question, whether it creates
thoughtful, adequate policies or
not. Such inherent doubt provides
a reason for reconsidering the
composition of the group.
"Multicultural." "Transcultural."
Neither describe the Cabinet. Yet.
