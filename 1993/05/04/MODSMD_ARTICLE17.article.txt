## Let's not get too personal 
### 
SOME THINGS just aren't right.
Nipple rings. Hostess "Sno-Balls."
Dwarf-tossing night at the local bar.
I could go on.
But I won't. I'll mention just one. more
of these things, but brace yourself 'cause
it's not a pretty one — the Personal Ad
section. Personal Ads, my friends, are just
not right and you know it. But they're not
as innocent as Hostess Sno-Balls or nipple
rings. Oh, that it could be so simple.
Personal Ads are human communica
tion gone wrong (as opposed to say, dwarf
tossing, which we might consider Pop-a-
Shot gone wrong), and that's what makes
them so scary. Real people write each one
of those ads. People so desperate for com
panionship that they're willing to adver
tise themselves not three column inches
away from "Vans and Trucks." Ouch.
People who find themselves lost in this
crazy I-live-in-a-city-with-umpteen-mil
lion-other-people-but-only-know-my-
dog, thank-God-my-VCR-will-never-be-
HIV-positive world.
I always wondered exactly who these
people are, these people who send in Per
sonal Ads. And for the most part, I've
been content to think they're the kind
prone to boiling pet rabbits as a way to
prove their love.
A quick look at the Bay Area Personal
Ad sections didn't exactly dispel this
notion either, especially when I got to the
SWM who longed for a woman "who can

count on one hand how many therapists
she's paid" or the less-than-poetic SHF
who — amid a longer mixed metaphor
which I won't get into — likened herself
to a cinnamon stick waiting to be licked.
But the more I read the personals, the
more I got the feeling that maybe at least
some of these people are just lonely folks
"who don't like the bar scene," as many
of them note. After seeing the ugly truth
at 42nd Street, well let's just say I can
sympathize. The woman who describes
herself as "the girl next door," for
instance — assuming she doesn't have in
mind some sexual fantasy involving a
naughty schoolboy — appears as though
she might be quite normal.
But for God's sake, I thought while
reading her personal, what is the girl next
door doing next to an ad for the "Let's Talk
Nasty" 1-900 number? Get out of there!
You're the girl next door, and you're ask
ing for phone calls and letters from people
who might ask you to the "Audio Fungus"
concert on your first date.
One wrong push of the telephone but
ton and I wouldn't get you, but the guy
who waxed poetic:
Extend your boundaries I Try some
thing new/A bisexual experience might
be I Just right for you."
Where did we go wrong, I was asking
myself. Weren't there simpler times
when sexual desperation or just plain
loneliness didn't necessarily lead to

phone calls charged at $1.49 per minute
(to respond to the ads you like) and white
lies about being an "outdoorsy" person
(seems to show up in a suspiciously large
number of ads). There's got to be a better
way than the personals.
But the problem is deeper than the
Personal Ads themselves. Personal Ads
are just another symptom of the discour
aging coupling of technological and cul
tural "advancement" with increasing iso
lation. VCRs, home-delivered pizza,
walkmans, Powerßooks, the indepen
dence of small Russian republics, you
name it. These things are good, of course,
but they pull us apart at the same time.
And then we find ourselves looking for
each other on pages 63 through 67 of
some weekly that has way too many ads
for hair-replacement systems. It's funny,
but its sad.
There's got to be a better way.

(But just in case) John Ford, SWM, is a
swimmer, closet poet and ardent Leslie
Nielsen fan seeking romance. If you like
the sound of waterfalls, walking the
beach at sunset or just the occasional
large bowl of macaroni and cheese send
