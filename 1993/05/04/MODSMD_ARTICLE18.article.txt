Commencement activities have no ethnic restrictions

IN RESPONSE TO the letter printed
on April 30 regarding the Com
mencement eating activities, I, as the
coordinator of the Chicano/Latino Grad
uation Committee along with other
members of the committee, would like to
respond. There was no typo. Yet you
need not worry.
None of your collective $240,000 went
to fund our Graduation activities. The
Chicano/Latino Graduation Committee
was founded and is organized and run
exclusively by students. We receive no
University funds and rely solely on out
side donations, fundraising and personal
contributions from the members to hold
our graduation ceremony and activities.
As students, we plan and organize all
of the events, including the fundraising,

and get no help from the University or
your tuition dollars. In fact, many frosh,
sophomores, and juniors volunteer to
pay tribute to the graduating seniors,
graduate students, and their families.
The entire community joins in helping
fundraise as well as setting up, waiting
on tables and cleaning up on the actual
days of the events.
The primary focus of our graduation
activities is not to "dine and dance until
1 a.m.," but rather to provide a gradua
tion ceremony honoring our families and
friends for their contributions to our
education. Many of the students who
choose to participate in our activities do
so because the bilingual ceremony pro
vides a very meaningful forum to
express to their loved ones all that their

support has meant in a language that
they can fully understand. The dinner
activities after the ceremony add to our
goal of providing an environment where
our family and friends can feel comfort
able by celebrating our shared culture.
Participation in our graduation
events is open to all students who wish
to take part and who are willing to assist
us in the fundraising and organization of
these activities. We realize that our
events may not be appropriate for all
students of this University, and would
encourage them to create their own
graduation activities with which they
feel more comfortable. Our organization
is very open to providing any informa
tion regarding the organization of such
activities and the work that it takes to

bring them to fruition.
It is unfortunate that we see our
selves in a position to have to legitimize
our graduation events. We do not, in any
way, wish to make our events exclusive
only to those students of Chicano/Latino
heritage, but it is true that the events
were created by students in our commu
nity who felt that the English-only grad
uation ceremonies did not give many of
our families a meaningful enough mes
sage of what their support has meant to
us these past four years. The events that
were created allow us to say Muchas
gracias por todo.
