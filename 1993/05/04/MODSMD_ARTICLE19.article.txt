# Issues of 'intruding' go beyond graduation
## 
### 
We were very disappointed to read the
letter last Friday concerning Commence
ment activities written by three senior
women. Because they are not African-
American, Chicano/Latino, Asian-Ameri
can, Native-American or Catholic, these
three women felt left out of the Com
mencement activities and lamented the
fact that there are no special dining activ
ities planned for them and their families.
We are writing to address their con
cerns from our perspective. Perhaps it
too was an oversight on their part that
they did not notice the President's
Reception and the dance at Tresidder,
both of which take place on Saturday.
We would also like to add that the so
called "ethnic" receptions/dinners are
events completely planned by students.
The University had little or nothing to
do with those events beyond printing
them in the Commencement calendar.
We would also like to emphasize that

these communities are not receiving spe
cial treatment. The Commencement
activities, as well as other events held by
ethnic groups throughout the year, are
the result of the hard work and dedicat
ed organizing of student volunteers.
Most importantly, however, the letter
showed a shallow and self-centered per
spective of the Commencement activities
and the realities of life in America.
Although it is obvious to us, we should
point out that the culture that permeates
our society is white, Euro-American cul
ture. Each day we all live in a world that
is oriented toward whites and which gen
erally disregards cultural differences.
We as non-whites have learned to live
and function in a society in which it has
been made clear to us that we are out
siders, if not outright intruders. Frankly,
we are frustrated that in one of the few
instances in which Euro-American cul
ture is not at the center of an event, peo
ple become defensive and intimate
reverse discrimination. It is also sad and
disheartening to think that the few
moments in which white Americans feel
discomfort carry much more weight than
the ever-present feeling of exclusion that

non-whites experience every day.
We are sorry that these students feel
left out. However, we are even sorrier
that after four years of being at Stan
ford, they have not taken the opportuni
ty to learn from those few experiences to
gain a deeper understanding of how it
feels to be a permanent outsider. Per
haps if more people, white and non
white, would attempt to overcome their
self-centered defensiveness, race rela
tions in this country would improve and
society at large would benefit.
