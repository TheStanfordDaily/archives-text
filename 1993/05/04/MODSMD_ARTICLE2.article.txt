# $27 M, 2 years later, indirect costs present long-term questions

### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
Two years and $27 million later, Stan
ford's wrangle with the federal govern
ment over indirect costs has resolved some
immediate cost-recovery problems. But as
government auditors have repeatedly
changed their accounting demands, Stan
ford has spent more than any other school
trying to negotiate an agreement on recov
ery rates and procedures.
And while the expense has secured Stan
ford a "reasonable" current rate of 60.3
percent, the University is still trying to
tackle the larger issue of reforming Stan
ford's indirect-cost reporting system,
which Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten says is one of the main causes of the
University's problems.
But as the negotiating process has faded
from headlines, resolving the issue is still
very much a foremost concern of Universi

ty administrators, who have become frus
trated with the drawn-out process; even
University President Gerhard Casper took
time in his State of the University speech
Thursday to criticize the government for
the lengthy process of investigating indi
rect costs, saying that enough hours have
been spent working on the issue to employ
one person, full time, for 125 years.
Nevertheless, Van Etten is optimistic
that a new, more efficient system is in the
works and may be implemented as soon as
next year.
"We're doing what we can to address im
mediate concerns, but we're also looking at
the future," he said.
Auditors and accountants
Dealing with the 1991 allegations that
Stanford overcharged the federal govern
ment by millions of dollars for research
overhead fees has cost the Univer
sity $27 million in auditors,
accountants, and consultants
hired to comply with government
inquiries. Legal costs have not
been calculated yet, but Van Etten
estimated that they would add
another few million to that figure.
Stanford did not have much
choice in how much money to
spend, Van Etten said. "We made
a commitment to provide whatev
er resources were needed to meet
what the government required."
And the government has
required quite a bit. First, extra
people had to be hired to deal with
the 24,000 requests for informa
tion from various government
agencies investigating the indi
rect-cost issue.
Second, outside auditors and
accountants were needed to go
over the years of papers that went
back to 1981, to recalculate and
respond to the government
audits. The results lie on a book
case in Van Etten's office: nearly
three-and-a-half feet of bound
reports that document those 10
years of the University's indirect
cost activity.
Third, studies — on everything
from utility costs, equipment
depreciation — that the federal
government asked the University
to conduct to replace the ones it
had originally done for past years
were big money-drainers.
Since the government had can
celed the original Memorandum
of Understandings, or contracts,
that it had with the University,
the studies conducted under
those memoranda were also

declared invalid. "We were sup
posed to do them all over in one
year," Van Etten said.
That was the area where the
most money was wasted, he said.
In one case, the government
required the University to survey
the administration four times a
year. After about $500,000 had
been sunk into the reporting
effort, the government changed
the regulations, in effect render
ing the surveys unnecessary.
At the height of the audits last
year, the University employed
more than 90 people in its indi
rect costs office, Van Etten said.
Most of the outside people have
since left, leaving a regular staff
of 45 — more than double the 20
staffers that worked in the office
before 1991.
More scrutiny, more money
While other universities were
subject to many of the same gov
ernment requirements, most did
not spend nearly as much as Stan
ford to redo their accounts.
At UC-Berkeley, for example,
the extra work was done by Uni
versity personnel. "We didn't
have to hire any outside audi
tors," said Gregg Carr, the man
ager of indirect-cost analysis.
While Berkeley's budget office
has not calculated the exact
amount the university has spent,
Carr said that it is not near the
$27 million mark.
The same is true at UC-San
Diego, another large research uni
versity that was audited by the
government. In an offhand esti
mate of the amount the universi
ty spent, Bill Brophy, the univer
sity's principal indirect-cost ana
lyst said it was unlikely the cost
even reached $1 million.
Part of the reason for the dif

ference in costs, Van Etten said, is
that the other universities were
not subject to the same scrutiny
and publicity that Stanford was.
Also, Stanford had to redo 10
years of files, many more than
other universities, he said. At
MIT, for instance, the govern
ment only questioned four years
of indirect-cost files.
A new system
Despite being able to solve
some immediate problems by
complying with government
requests, the University has yet
to resolve the larger issue of a
more efficient indirect-cost
reporting system.
The main challenge has been
trying to switch the current
adversarial — and extremely cost
ly and time-consuming —
method to the less troublesome
one already used by many other
universities which report to
Department of Health and
Human Services.
Under the proposed system,
the Office of Naval Research, the
federal agency which oversees
Stanford, will give the University
a pre-determined, multi-year
indirect-cost rate, rather than
negotiating a yearly rate.
In other words, rather than
going through the entire auditing
and documentation process every
year, the University would get a set
rate that would cover several years.
The plan would also benefit
Stanford because the government
would not re-audit the University
at the end of the year. Rather, if
the University goes over the pre
determined cost, it pays the dif
ference itself; if it ends up below
costs, it keeps the extra.
Universities such as Stanford
and CalTech that report to the

Office of Naval Research current
ly negotiate their indirect-cost
rate through a system of audits
and re-audits.
"Under the present system,"
Van Etten said, every year "[the
government] sets up the rules, we
file a proposal that's several hun
dred pages long, they audit it, set
a rate, and then (once the year is
over) we report our actual costs in
another hundred pages, and then
they audit that.
The Office of Naval Research
has "a defense-contractor mental
ity," Van Etten said. "They
approach indirect costs the same
way the Pentagon approaches
procurement issues."
Van Etten said that the agency
appears to be sympathetic toward
the new system. "It's hopeful," he
said, adding that in the new ver
sion of "A-21" — the government
memo that sets the guidelines for
indirect-cost recovery — the
Office of Management and Budget
"strongly encourages" a switch to
the multi-year, pre-set system.
Many other universities that
operate under the Office of Naval
Research are also pressing for the
new system, Van Etten said.
"We've been asked for our sug
gestions. Now, we're waiting to be
told what's going to happen," said
Hall Daily, the director of govern
ment relations and community
affairs at the California Institute of
Technology, which has also not yet
resolved its indirect-cost problems.
However, while the new sys
tem will be less troublesome, it is
not the perfect system. At the
University of Michigan, "the
[Health and Human Services
type] system has deteriorated to
the point where we are treated as
adversaries," said George
Schlecht, the director of finance.
