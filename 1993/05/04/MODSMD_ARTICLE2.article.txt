# $27 M, 2 years later, indirect costs present long-term questions

Two years and $27 million later, Stan
ford's wrangle with the federal govern
ment over indirect costs has resolved some
immediate cost-recovery problems. But as
government auditors have repeatedly
changed their accounting demands, Stan
ford has spent more than any other school
trying to negotiate an agreement on recov
ery rates and procedures.
And while the expense has secured Stan
ford a "reasonable" current rate of 60.3
percent, the University is still trying to
tackle the larger issue of reforming Stan
ford's indirect-cost reporting system,
which Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten says is one of the main causes of the
University's problems.
But as the negotiating process has faded
from headlines, resolving the issue is still
very much a foremost concern of Universi

ty administrators, who have become frus
trated with the drawn-out process; even
University President Gerhard Casper took
time in his State of the University speech
Thursday to criticize the government for
the lengthy process of investigating indi
rect costs, saying that enough hours have
been spent working on the issue to employ
one person, full time, for 125 years.
Nevertheless, Van Etten is optimistic
that a new, more efficient system is in the
works and may be implemented as soon as
next year.
"We're doing what we can to address im
mediate concerns, but we're also looking at
the future," he said.
