# Casper has not shown any moral leadership
## 
### 
As Gerhard Casper's first academic
year as president of Stanford ends, he
gets a "Dâ€”" in moral leadership.
The great moral test of Casper's pres
idency, as The Daily noted in its Feb. 12
editorial, "A Matter of Decency," was

Webb Ranch. Lamentably, President
Casper left the men, women and chil
dren at Webb Ranch in poverty.
The only reason Mr. Casper does not
deserve an "F" is that he did intervene
with the Webbs after the press reported
that several workers' families had been
living for months in run-down housing
without adequate heat. On ending
poverty at Webb Ranch, and getting
workers such benefits as health insur
ance, President Casper passed the buck
to United Stanford Workers. He claimed
that "the University is not the owner,
operator or employer at Webb Ranch"
(Feb. 25,1993 letter to Professors Man
ley, Rebholz and Fraga).
The University is the owner of the
land, its lessor and the recipient of
rental profits. Assigning the responsibili
ty for wages and benefits exclusively to
United Stanford Workers ensures the
perpetuation of poverty at Webb Ranch
because only extraordinary leadership by
the University can force the Webbs to
upgrade worker conditions. So far this
leadership has been shamefully absent.
