## Ceman makes volleyball another 'day at the beach' 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
For most college students, the
beach is a place to vacation, party
and have a good time. For Stan

ford men's volleyball star Canyon
Ceman, the beach is a place to
make a living.
Not that Ceman doesn't have
fun on the beach as well.
"If I feel for the rest of my life

how euphoric I felt in the three
beach tournaments I played last
summer, my life will be perfect,"
he said.
Beach volleyball has been
steadily growing in popularity

over the past 10 years. Played in
pairs, the sport has many big
name sponsors such as Miller Lite
and Ocean Pacific and has given
the regional sport of men's volley
ball national attention by becom
ing an ESPN staple. Many of the
best American collegiate spikers
go on to become affluent and
famous beach players.
But the sport does not trans
late directly from the six-on-six
hardcourt format of NCAA volley
ball. Some top collegians never
make an impact in the sand
because of a lack of versatility
that is more easily hidden with
five other teammates.
"In six-man you can specialize
at a skill or two and get away with
it," Ceman said. "On the beach
you need to have all the skills.
Karch Kiraly is a perfect example.
He's the best beach player in the
world because he can pass, set,
hit, block, dig and serve."
As this season has shown, ver
satility is one of Ceman's strong
points. An All-American setter
last year and considered by Cardi
nal coach Ruben Nieves as "the
best-setting setter in the coun
try," Ceman played some swing
hitter this year, where he had to
rely on his unproven passing and
hitting ability. His skill at these
two aspects of volleyball was
proven soon enough, and this ver
satility was a major factor in the
American Volleyball Coaches
Association's decision to award
Ceman National Player of the
Year honors, the Heisman Tro
phy of men's volleyball.
From Southern California,
Ceman started playing volleyball
on the beach at age 11. He
believes that such an early start
has helped his game tremendous
ly-
"Because I couldn't hit, I start
ed doing little shots," he said.
"That started me on the right
track towards learning the funda
mentals of volleyball . . . learning
where the defense was and not
always trying to hit the ball as
hard as you can, but trying to get

the ball to the sand."
Ceman went to Mira Costa
High School, one of the top vol
leyball high schools in the coun
try, started all four years and led
the team to an undefeated season

If I feel for the rest
of my life how euph
oric I felt in the three
beach tournaments I
played last summer,
my life will be perfect'
— Canyon Ceman

and a national title his senior
year.
"My coach, Mike Cook, who is
a big supporter of beach volley
ball, encouraged me to go out on
Marine Street, which is where
guys like Adam Johnson and
(Steve) Timmons play during the
summer every day, all day,"
Ceman said. "It was a place to see
the best players in the world and
it made me think, 'Wow, that
would be a real nice way to make
money."
The summer after his fresh
man year at Mira Costa, Ceman
paired up with high school team
mate David Swatik. Formerly a
swing hitter for UCLA, Swatik
has now quit the Bruins to play
full time on the pro beach tour.
This alliance was immediately
successful, getting their Triple-A
(the highest amateur ranking) at
age 16, a feat only two other male
players had accomplished.
"We won all the Triple A's we
played in, except for one, last
year," Ceman said. "We also got a
ninth and a 17th in pro tourna
ments."
One of Ceman's most exciting
beach moments was playing in the
Manhattan Open, in Ceman's
hometown, against the top
ranked duo of Kiraly and former

Cardinal Kent Steffes on the cen
ter court.
"It was like a dream come true.
We were tied 9-9," he said. "I got
an ace and Swatik got a huge
block against Karch. It was stuff
where you go, 'Wow, this is
gnarly!'
"Finally, the 'wow, this is
gnarly' hit us and we sort of said
'Wait, we're not supposed to be
out here' and we were dismissed
15-9."
The next pro tournament in
which Ceman played was the
Hermosa Open, where he and
Swatik superseded all expecta
tions by placing ninth in the
strongest beach tournament of
the year. To maintain his colle
giate eligibility, Ceman had to
turn down $4,000 in prize money
from that tournament.
Ceman and Swatik were the
wide-eyed new kids on the beach
last summer, constantly over
awed to be playing, scoring points
on, and sometimes even beating,
childhood idols. But Ceman real
izes that this naivete will fade
when he and Swatik turn their
energies to making a living on the
tour. Already, Ceman, an eco
nomics major who plans on grad
uating in four years with a mas
ter's degree in organizational
behavior, has begun to plan a pro
motional, profitable human-inter
est story around himself and his
teammate, utilizing the skills he
picked up as a coterminal student
at Stanford.
"There is something to be said
about creating a media story
around a team," he said. "What
you want to do to help your public
relations is to get some sort of
story around you. Like Karch is
the 'biomechanics graduate from
UCLA' and Timmons is 'the hair
guy-'
"As a team I'd like to focus on
that we grew up together playing
the sport at Mira Costa," he said,
formulating his own prediction
for the future, "and ended up by
dominating, or making a big
impact on, the pro-beach tour."
