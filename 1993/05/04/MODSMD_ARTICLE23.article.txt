# Women's ruggers can't measure up
## Fall to UConn, Penn State in Final Four 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
While a 47-0 margin of
defeat in a national tournament
would severely dishearten
almost any competitor, the
Stanford women's rugby team
took this weekend's losses at
the NCAA Championships in
Houston in stride.
After falling victim to a
blowout at the hands of Con
necticut in Saturday's semifinal,
the Cardinal returned the fol
lowing day to lose to Penn State
in the consolation game by the
much narrower gap of 7-0. Con
necticut went on to defeat Air
Force 17-0 in the championship
game to take the national title.
"I thought the team showed
real class," said coach Nancy
Breen. "It's hard to hold it
together when you're losing by
so much. They did a really good
job of that."
Senior co-captain Elizabeth
Bassett, who was named to the
all-tournament team along with
sophomore Karen Martin, agreed
that the Stanford squad did not
let Saturday's numbers affect its
performance on Sunday.
"I don't think we need to hang
our heads over anything about
that game (Saturday)," Bassett
said. "It was a very bad loss when
you look at the score, but I think
we took it pretty well."
Thunderstorms and tornado
warnings created extremely wet
fields which put both teams at a
disadvantage in Saturday's
match. Despite the mud, the
Huskies managed to dominate
throughout, keeping Stanford
in the defensive position a
nwyority of the time.
The Cardinal stayed much
closer in Sunday's consolation
game, allowing the Nittany
Lions to score only once.
"The team played much better
than on Saturday," Bassett said.
"We were much less intimidated
and were able to hold them until
35 minutes into the first half."
Sophomore co-captain Karen
O'Connell cited the strength of
the back players as one of the
keys to the close contest. She
saw the Cardinal's lack of expe
rience in rucking — when the

ball is on the ground and is put
back into play — as one of Stan
ford's two main weaknesses.
The other was an ineffective
defense against the opponent's
group game, when the forwards
run and hand off the ball.
"We didn't know how to pro
tect against Penn State's group
game," O'Connell said. "There
were more of them than there
were of us — that's how they
got by us."
Breen pointed out the contri
butions of Bassett in the for
ward eight-man position and
O'Connell, playing scrum half,
as keys to the Cardinal squad.
She also praised the efforts of
Martin in the flanker position
and freshmen forwards Emily
Shanklin and Jin-Sun Park as
well as backs Amanda Edwards
and Andrea Chartock.
Breen and Bassett also com
mended the skill with which
freshman Christine Fox han
dled the position of flyhalf, the
player responsible for organiz
ing the backs.
"She has an instinctive feel
for the game," Bassett said.
"Christine was exactly where
she needed to be when she need
ed to be there."
Admittedly matched against
much older and experienced
squads, the young Cardinal
focused on the educational
potential the weekend offered.
"These games doubled our
experience against college
teams," O'Connell said. "We
brought 13 rookies, something
which I'm sure nationals has
never seen before."
Breen agreed that Stanford's
weakness partially stemmed
from its lack of experience
against comparable teams, hav
ing faced mostly older club teams
while only playing two collegiate
games before the championships.
"Our technique and athletic
ability are both very good," Breen
said. "It was really just a matter
of who had more experience.
"As a team of mostly fresh
men, it was positive in a way to
get beaten by a lot," Breen
added. "They realized how much
better they could be, then, by
playing a close game, they real
ized just how far they had come."
