# Cardinal misses Ultimate destination

The Stanford men's ultimate frisbee team
played well last weekend at the Western Col
legiate Regional Tournament, but not quite
well enough to extend its season.
The Cardinal men posted a 6-3 record and
captured third place in the two-day competi
tion, held on Stanford's intramural fields, but
failed to gain a berth in the national champi
onships by virtue of an 11-9 loss to UC-Santa
Barbara in the loser's bracket final, which was
time-capped due to darkness.
The top two finishers, UC-Santa Cruz and
UCSB, will represent the West in the national
tournament, held later this month in Bethle
hem, Pa.
Stanford captain Wes Williams, a senior,
was pleased with the team's effort. "We
played much better than we had all year, with
the exception of the tournament in Hawaii,"
Williams said. "This weekend we were consis
tent throughout the entire tournament, not
just for a couple of games."
Stanford finished Saturday's pool play with
a 3-1 record, opening with an 11-5 victory over

Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. After beating the
Stanford B squad 11-0, the men lost to Hum
boldt State 11-9. The team wrapped up the day
with a solid 11-2 win over Occidental which
earned it a berth in Sunday's quarterfinals.
The Cardinal squad opened the second
day's play by defeating Las Positas College 13-
6. In a time-capped semifinal match against
Santa Cruz, the Stanford squad was narrowly
defeated 11-9. The team bounced back, how
ever, earning a chance to qualify for nationals
by moving through the loser's bracket with
victories over Oregon (13-9) and Las Positas
(13-5).
Williams pointed to the electrifying play of
sophomore rover Terry Cussen as a key to
Stanford's success against the Ducks. "In the
Oregon game, we were trading points, and
were even down a couple of points at one
time," Williams said. "Terry came up with two
or three layout biffs on defense and then made
outstanding catches to score at the other end.
"That kind of play turned the momentum
in our favor, and we were able to pull out the
match," Williams added.
Against UCSB, the Cardinal started out

slowly, falling behind 3-0. Stanford fought
back and had a chance to tie the game at 10,
but wound up losing 11-9 as the game was
shortened due to darkness.
"We were playing hard and felt we were in
a position to win," Cussen said. "Who knows
what would have happened if we had kept
playing."
Although the team came up just short of its
goal, Williams came away satisfied with his
squad's season. "We played really well this
year," Williams said. "Throughout the season,
we exceeded other people's expectations of
this team.
"As opposed to last year, when we also fin
ished third at regionals, this year we felt that
we played up to our potential," Williams con
tinued.
The team finished the season with a 16-5
record against collegiate competition.
Looking ahead, Cussen said, "We will be
losing a lot of experience and players who real
ly know how to teach the game. But we have
promising rookies and lots of potential. We
will definitely be competing for a spot at
nationals again next year."
