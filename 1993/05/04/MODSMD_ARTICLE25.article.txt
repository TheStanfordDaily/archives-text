# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
As we enter this "very merry month" of
May, our thoughts turn to breaking out
and discovering the very best that spring
has to offer. It is this quest for excellence
that leads the Daily to tab Canyon Ceman
and Christy Boyd as its Athletes of the
Week for their standup performances on
behalf of the Cardinal men's volleyball and
track and field teams in the last seven
days.
Ceman, a junior setter from Manhattan

Beach, Calif., must be experiencing noth
ing short of sensory overload, as individu
al honors and team shortfalls have taken
him on an emotional roller-coaster ride
recently. As he prepared for his third post
season in as many years at Stanford,
Ceman discovered on Tuesday that he had
been named Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Player of the Year, highlighting
his second appearance on the all-confer
ence squad. His joy was short-lived, how
ever, as the Cardinal dropped the MPSF
championship game to UCLA Wednesday
night.
Similarly, after Ceman amassed an
incredible 103 assists Friday night in a
heartbreaking four-game loss to Long Beach
State that ended Stanford's season, the
American Volleyball Coaches Association
named him National Player of the Year and
a first-team All-American for the second
time.
While he may have lost a shot at the Final
Four and the Cardinal's first-ever national
title, Ceman has reached the pinnacle of col
legiate volleyball and, unfortunately for
Stanford's 1994 opponents, has one more
year to shine.

Boyd, a sophomore from Pleasanton,
Calif., also has a bright future before her. By
virtue of her lifetime-best 1 minute, 1.21 sec
ond clocking in the 400-meter hurdles Sat
urday at the Chico Invitational, Boyd bet
tered the automatic-qualifying standard for
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships, to

be held in three weeks.
In qualifying, Boyd became the third
Stanford athlete to be invited to two events
at the conference meet this season. She had
previously topped her personal best in the
100 hurdles in order to receive a bid to
Berkeley.
Boyd and the rest of the Cardinal track
and field team will make their final home
appearance of 1993 in this Sunday's Big
Meet against California at 12:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium.
