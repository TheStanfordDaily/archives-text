# Tragedy befalls 'wide world of crew'
## Steger's injury in women's race offsets record-setting performance by men 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's crews
did their best job to display the thrill of vic
tory and the agony of defeat this weekend
at Redwood Shores.
The men's varsity and junior varsity
eight-man boats, racing UC-Davis on Satur
day, shattered the school record for a 2,000-
meter race. The varsity won the race with a
time of 5 minutes, 42 seconds and the
junior varsity, racing in the varsity divi
sion, came in second in 5:48. The old varsi
ty record was 5:55 and the junior-varsity
record approximately 6:05, according to
men's coach Wieslaw Kujda.
The Cardinal women's crew, still plagued
by injuries, did not have as successful a day.
Unable to put together a complete boat for
the third-consecutive week, Stanford's var
sity lost to UC-Davis by eight seconds as
the Aggies won the race in 6:52.
However, race results became secondary
in importance when varsity rower Kate Ste
ger felt her right leg lock up halfway
through the varsity eight race.
Steger, suffering from a season-long
back injury impinging on a nerve ending,
felt a slight tingling in her right foot during
warm-ups. After Steger's right leg quit
working, she stopped rowing. Rushed by
ambulance to a hospital, Steger felt her
back pop three hours after the race and
then felt fine, according to coach Wendy
Davis. Steger is scheduled for an MRI test
Monday to determine the nature and extent
of her injury.
"We are a legitimate nine seconds faster
than Davis," Davis said. "The injuries gave
us a reason for a poor performance, but we

should have dominated more in the first
half of the race before Kate was injured."
In an act which now seems like incredi
ble foresight, Davis rested Sarah Morse
because of a nagging back injury. Already
one rower short, the women's varsity eight
was also operating with several half
strength rowers such as Cara Larson, who
is still recovering from a back injury of her
own, and Kristin Hubbard, who is getting
over the flu.
"We'll rest Sarah Monday, but I hope by
Tuesday she'll be practicing," Davis said.
"She becomes a real animal when things
aren't going right, and when she's in there
she really ignites the boat. The other two
just need to recover as quickly as possible."
The junior-varsity eight edged Davis by
four seconds with a time of 7:07. The novice
four, despite a navigation difficulty around
a buoy which caused the boat to veer off
course, pushed hard and narrowly beat the
Aggies, much to their surprise.
"I think Davis was a little cocky in that
race," Davis said. "Our boat got off course,
but they came back hard. I think Davis had
written us off and didn't try very hard the
last part of the race."
The novice eight boat crossed the finish
line three seconds behind Davis' winning
time of 7:11, but Davis saw improvement
from the previous week. The novice eight
shaved four seconds off of its finish at the
California State Championships, when
Davis finished seven seconds ahead of the
Cardinal.
The women's crew will now gear up for
the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships
on May 22 and 23. Davis said practice will
be hard for the next week and a half, and
then the team will begin to taper. Davis

plans to keep the intensity high for all prac
tices, but if sacrificing intensity will get the
crew healthy again, said she will not push
her team too hard.
The men's crew continued its dominance
over both the Aggies on Saturday and Long
Beach State on Sunday. The varsity four
defeated Davis by four seconds with a time
of 6:54, and both the novice and freshman
eights showed improvement, falling to
Davis by two and seven seconds, respective
ly.
Against the 49ers, the varsity eight
couldn't improve on their record time, but
still won by 22 seconds, winning in 5:52.
The junior varsity also won with a time of
5:55, defeating Long Beach by 17 seconds.
"I have been predicting these times all
season," Kujda said. "Something always
kept the team from performing at their top
ability, but they finally came through."
Currently ranked third on the Pacific
Coast behind Washington and California,
the Stanford men plan to take it easy this
week and work on some minor adjustments
before the Pacific Coast Championships in
three weeks.
"We had a good, solid, professional race
on Saturday," Kujda said. "The team
showed a lot of courage. As Davis dropped
back, the junior varsity stepped up to chal
lenge the varsity, and both boats challenged
themselves."
The men's team participates in one final
warmup next week at the Newport Regatta
in Newport Beach, Calif. Kujda sees the
junior-varsity, novice and freshman boats
having difficulty with their counterparts
from Orange Coast College, whereas the
varsity's only trouble should come from
UCLA.
