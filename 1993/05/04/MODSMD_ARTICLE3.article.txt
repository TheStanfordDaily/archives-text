# Clinton's service plan elicits general approval
## Campus activists question specifics 
### Urmimala Sarkar Staff writer 
Community service-minded students
and staff say they are generally pleased
with the Clinton administration's new pro
posal allowing students to repay college
loans through public service, but many are
expressing concern about specific aspects
of the plan.
Stanford Program on National Service
chair David Kuhn, a sophomore, called the
proposal "encouraging," but added
"there's still a lot of work ahead" because
the plan has yet to pass Congress, and
some details remain to be ironed out.
Haas Center for Public Service Acting
Director Timothy Stanton agreed, saying
he finds the government's willingness to
encourage public service and tackle the ris
ing costs of higher education "wonderfully
exciting." However, he questioned several
of the plan's key elements.
For example, Stanton said, the proposal
makes "no effort" to target students with
greater financial need, since the public ser
vice positions will be open to all students.
"Who should we help? There are 4 mil
lion students and 150,000 positions,"
Stanton said. "Who gets to take advantage
of this opportunity?"
Another potential problem is identify
ing the plan's primary goal, Stanton added.
He said he is unsure whether the plan's
purpose is to help students repay
loans or to involve more students
in public service.
Stanton also worries that the
amount of the grants — $5,000
toward tuition per one year of
service — may not be substantial
enough to attract students who
are not already public service
minded, since there are jobs "on
Wall Street which would allow
them to pay back their loans
more quickly." The plan's effec
tiveness, he said, will be demon
strated by the numbers eager to
participate.
The question is a valid one
even among those already
involved in public service.
Although the plan does provide
health care and child care, "the
stipend is pretty low, and not
much of an incentive," said Linda
Cheu, the Haas Center Volunteer
Coordinator. She added that the
flat-rate minimum wage paid for
service does not recognize "diver
sity of location," such as differ

ences in cost of living.
Some criticized Clinton's last
minute reduction of funds (from
$7,500 per year to $5,000 per
year) in response to Pentagon
concerns that the national public
service program would compete
with military scholarship pro
grams.
"Military-type service is not a
viable option for everyone," said
SPONS archivist Mona Tekchan
dani, who said that a public ser
vice program simply provides
students with a financial alterna
tive.
Even the plan's designation of
which groups should receive aid
met with mixed reaction. For
instance, Anoop Prakash, publici
ty director for SPONS, lauded the
proposal's emphasis on funding
"direct service groups" as opposed
to advocacy groups. Prakash felt
the distinction will keep public
service "away from politics."
However, Cheu said that stu
dents might be useful in an indi
rect service like "grant-writing
and research" that would utilize
college students' skills.
Overall, however, students
seem to hold high hopes for the

plan. Tekchandani said she "lauds
Clinton's drive to encourage
national service." She added that,
as a recipient of student loans, the
program could allow her to com
bine her interest in community
work with her need to repay her
loans. She feels that Stanford stu
dents will "definitely" participate
in this program.
The general interest seems to
be high, freshman Sara Dewitt
noted. "There are a lot of stu
dents at Stanford who are inter
ested in community service any
way, but are on work-study pro
grams that don't allow time for
it," she said. "This would allow
them to do service and still pay
off their loans."
Stanton said the Clinton plan
involves several sites around the
nation where the public service
will be coordinated. However, he
said, "I don't know if it is wise for
us (at the Haas center) to get
involved, but it is possible. We'll
certainly be watching for new
opportunities for Stanford stu
dents."
