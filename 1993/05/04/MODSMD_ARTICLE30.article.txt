Alleged thieves trip up
Ignorance about Stanford's
Greek system landed three
alleged bike thieves in jail
Wednesday night.
The trio was first spotted by
Loro resident Blake Tucker,
who noticed them suspiciously
eyeing some bicycles parked at
the bike rack outside Florence
Moore Hall.
The alleged thieves
approached Tucker to ask for
directions to the "Phi Kappa
Alpha house." Tucker, a sopho
more, pointed them to the Row,
but then grew skeptical about
this question and hurried back
to his dorm to get "some people
to scare them off."
Stanford does not have a Phi
Kappa Alpha house.
After Tucker arrived with
friends from upstairs and con
fronted the trio in front of
Mirlo, the threesome fled, two
of them on stolen bikes and one
on foot.
Tucker then proceeded to
call the Stanford Police, who
caught up with the alleged
thieves by Toyon and Branner
Halls. Two of the suspects were
found hiding in the bushes next
to Toyon, while the other was
found hiding under a car in the
parking lot.
The suspects abandoned the
bikes when officers closed in on
them, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said.
All three suspects were
taken to Santa Clara County
Juvenile Hall and booked on
charges of possession of stolen
property. One of the suspects,
Kenneth Laverne Roberts, is
also being charged for attempt
ing to falsify public records; he
is an adult, but told police he

was a minor.
All three suspects deny the
charges, Niemeyer said.

Hammer killer gets the ax
Theodore Streleski, the for
mer Stanford graduate student
who murdered his math profes
sor with a hammer in 1978, will
not receive a job with Muni
Railway in San Francisco, the
San Francisco Chronicle
reported yesterday.
Two weeks ago, Muni had
said it would hire Streleski for
$45,800 per year as an electri
cian. However, The Chronicle
reported that the killer "failed
the background investigation"
he was given before hiring
because he still feels the blud
geoning was the best way to
solve a dispute with his then
advisor Karel deLeeuw. Stre
leski served 7 years in prison
for the crime.
