# How the plan would work

### 
The service plan proposed by Presi
dent Clinton Friday would allow Amer
ican students to pay for up to $10,000
of their post-secondary education by
working at public service jobs for up to
two years.
Pending congressional approval,
Clinton is hoping to get his program off
the ground by next year. Under the
proposal, the 1994 National Service
budget would be $400 million and in
volve 25,000 students. By 1997, the
budget would rise to about $3.4 billion
annually and 150,000 students would
be included. This is how the program
would work:
The federal government would set
up a National Service Corporation.
This corporation would allocate service
slots to individual states based on pop
ulation, who would in turn allot slots to
specific service groups and municipali
ties based on states' individual criteria.
Students could volunteer for these
slots either before, during or after they
attend a college or vocational school.
While working, the student would be
paid minimum wage, currently $4.25
an hour. The federal government
would pay about 85 percent of this
wage, or approximately $6,000
per student per year, and state
and local governments would pay
the rest. In addition, the Nation
al Service Corporation would
assist needy students with child
care and health care.
Participants would work any
where from one to two years, and
would earn $5,000 per year for
their effort, which the corpora
tion would send directly to the
student's college or the bank
holding the student's education
loan.
