# Clinton's first 100 days
## Hoover panel gives mixed reviews 
### Johnathon Briggs Staff writer 
It seems that the honeymoon is over for
President Clinton. At least, that's what a
panel of Stanford professors and Hoover
Institution fellows said last night.
An audience of about 300 alumni gath
ered in Annenberg Auditorium to hear an
informal discussion of Clinton's perfor
mance in his first 100 days as President.
Co-sponsored by the Stanford Alumni
Association and Hoover Institution, the
panel discussed the President's economic
plan, foreign policy and agenda. Overall,
the panelists were disappointed with Clin
ton's performance — particularly his eco
nomic plans — and felt he has been trying
to appeal to too many interest groups.
In a brief history of past presidential ad
ministrations, Hoover Senior Fellow John
Bunzel said Clinton's economic plan "rep
resents a fundamental reorientation of the
American budget. . . since Reagan and The
New Deal."
Bunzel said that Clinton's plan ofYers
the same thing Bush and Reagan promised
— economic security. The difference is

Clinton wants to use more government, not
less, Bunzel said.
"Reagan's coalition represented people
who had grievances against the govern
ment. . . . Clinton has an updated version
of the New Deal coalition where govern
ment is a problem solver, not just a
provider."
Hoover Senior Fellow Martin Anderson
also critiqued Clinton's economic ap
proach, comparing Clinton to previous De
mocratic leaders. Citing established eco
nomic laws, Anderson said that Clinton's
economic plans add up to a program of tax
increases and no spending cuts. He said
that Clinton, the "New Democrat," is gov
erning like an "Old Democrat."
Political Science Prof. David Brady pre
ferred more simplistic terms, saying the ad
vice he would give Clinton is: "It's the econ
omy stupid."
Brady painted Clinton's next major
challenge as figuring out how to reform
health care without hurting his economic
package. While Brady said this was possi
ble, he added, "it hasn't been a great 100
days."
John Ferejohn, chair of the
Department of Political Science,
said Clinton's economic plan will
not have a problem passing the
Democrat-controlled House of
Representatives. However, he pre
dicted the package will encounter
problems when it gets to the Sen
ate, which has a higher percentage
of Republicans.
To get his package through,
Clinton must "build a compro
mise" between Democrats and
Republicans, he said.
This will be difficult for two
reasons, according to Brady. First,
"the Republicans in Congress are
not obligated to him" and second,
"he needs public opinion in his
favor" to sway Republicans to his
side, Brady said.
Brady said Clinton's support
from Republicans who wanted to
give him a chance is waning and,
"even the Perot voters are 3-to-l
against him."

As his support disappears, Clin
ton is getting himself into deeper
trouble by simultaneously trying
to satisfy too many interest
groups, the panelists said.
Clinton — like Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin — represents
the beginning of populism, Bunzel
said. "People support them, not
their ideology.... No one knows if
their ideas will work."
Bunzel said he sees a "new style
of politics" emerging. "It is
marked by pragmatism, populism,
and personalism." Without his
popularity Bunzel feels that Clin
ton's ability to get his plans
through will be gone. "It doesn't
take much to go from hero to
bum," Bunzel said.
Clinton's populism has led
him to adopt special-interest
issues such as the ban on gays in
the military that got his presiden
cy "ofT to a rocky start," Bunzel
suggested.
Brady agreed that expectations
from women, minorities, gays and
the other interests who supported
Clinton's election filled his first
100 days in the Oval Office, and
have crowded his agenda.
