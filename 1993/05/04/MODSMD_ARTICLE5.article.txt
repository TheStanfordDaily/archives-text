It seems that the honeymoon is over for
President Clinton. At least, that's what a
panel of Stanford professors and Hoover

An audience of about 300 alumni gath
ered in Annenberg Auditorium to hear an
informal discussion of Clinton's perfor

Brady painted Clinton's next major
challenge as figuring out how to reform
health care without hurting his economic
