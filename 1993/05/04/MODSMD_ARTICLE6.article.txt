## Surplus store houses outdated equipments at bargain prices

In the market for a one-man
rocket designed to fly over the
Elvis Presley museum? How
'bout a bust of Nefertiti's
daughter, or even one of those
sporty three-wheel Cushman
go-carts the police use?
Look no further than the
conveniently located Universi
ty Surplus Property Sales store.
Tucked away in near-obscu
rity on Bonair Siding behind
Maples Pavilion, the green,
warehouse-like building is not
only a trading post for used and
donated equipment, but also a
veritable museum of odd and
antiquated relics.
Propped up on old desks and
among a motiey assortment of
chairs and couches are a wide

variety of computers, ranging
from laptops to Digital's "Mis
ter Computer."
A formidable specimen of an
early-model number-cruncher,
Mister Computer, with all of his
various modules and disk dri
ves — "Do not block," a sign on
the unit proclaims — stands
nearly five feet tall on a multi
level vertical stand. A bargain
at $200.
Joining the technological
nostalgia trip are a two-track
tape recorder, several mimeo
graph machines (just like the
ones that cranked out your pur
ple-inked elementary school
worksheets) and — for library
buffs — an assortment of mi
crofilm and microfiche readers.
Some of the more unusual
