## Surplus store houses outdated equipments at bargain prices 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
In the market for a one-man
rocket designed to fly over the
Elvis Presley museum? How
'bout a bust of Nefertiti's
daughter, or even one of those
sporty three-wheel Cushman
go-carts the police use?
Look no further than the
conveniently located Universi
ty Surplus Property Sales store.
Tucked away in near-obscu
rity on Bonair Siding behind
Maples Pavilion, the green,
warehouse-like building is not
only a trading post for used and
donated equipment, but also a
veritable museum of odd and
antiquated relics.
Propped up on old desks and
among a motiey assortment of
chairs and couches are a wide

variety of computers, ranging
from laptops to Digital's "Mis
ter Computer."
A formidable specimen of an
early-model number-cruncher,
Mister Computer, with all of his
various modules and disk dri
ves — "Do not block," a sign on
the unit proclaims — stands
nearly five feet tall on a multi
level vertical stand. A bargain
at $200.
Joining the technological
nostalgia trip are a two-track
tape recorder, several mimeo
graph machines (just like the
ones that cranked out your pur
ple-inked elementary school
worksheets) and — for library
buffs — an assortment of mi
crofilm and microfiche readers.
Some of the more unusual

artifacts are sure to appeal to the
pre-med set. Where else can a
"Colony Counter" — a large mag
nifying device with the "School of
Medicine" label still on it — be
purchased for only $30?
Even more substantial labora
tory devices are offered for sale
through a bidding system, much
like an extended silent auction.
Lucky high bidders may find
themselves the proud owners of a
four-unit blood analyzer system, a
laboratory glassware washer or
even a Sorvall general-purpose
centrifuge direct from Stanford
Hospital.
The centrifuge, which vaguely
resembles an overgrown washing
machine, comes complete with a
letter stating that it has been
kindly "properly decontaminated"
for the next user.
Surplus Property Sales obtains
its wares from three sources —
University departments, schools
or offices; donations to Stanford
or property bequest to Stanford on
people's wills, explained manager

John Pipkin.
The equipment is either sold
for a set price or put on a bid sys
tem, in which people submit
sealed bids up to a deadline, and
the highest bidder wins the con
traption, he added.
Pipkin said although "anyone
who has money" can buy the
equipment, the store can only sell
things that are University proper
ty. Once an item is sold, the money
goes back to the department from
which it was originally sent.
Students are frequent cus
tomers, usually looking for deals
on desks, chairs, sofas and the
like, Pipkin said. "We remember
what it's like to be a student, so we
usually try to give them a break on
the price," he added.
Surplus sales are not limited to
office and medical equipment,
Pipkin pointed out. There are reg
ular on-site sales of vessels — as
in boats — including a notable
yacht once owned by Sir
Lawrence Olivier and a more
notorious yacht "that caused
Stanford to get all that bad
press," Pipkin said.
Other interesting items that
have passed through surplus sales
include a one-man rocket designed

to fly over the Elvis Presley muse
um. "It was never flown, but
somebody wanted it," Pipkin said.
For those that are interested in
less extravagant modes of trans
portation, the store usually sells
used Cushman carts, the three
wheeled vehicles that carry Stan
ford cops safely through campus.
Unfortunately for Cushman afi
cionados, the carts are currently
out of stock.
Perhaps the most valuable
item sold was a small bust of
ancient Egyptian queen Neferti
ti's daughter, which Pipkin said
was worth $1 to 3 million. Howev
er, sufficient proof of the arti
fact's value and origins could not
be established, and the piece was
sold for the bargain price of
$5,000.
But true bargain hunters will
revel in the "free pile" in front of
the store. If an item is not sold in
90 days, it is sometimes placed
there, free for the taking.
"Ninety-nine point nine per
cent of the time, things in the free
pile are picked up — there are a lot
of junk junkies out there who just
like to take things apart or collect
parts," Pipkin said. "It's like recy
cling at its best."
