Research Assistant
At Failure Analysis, failure is our business. We are the largest and most experienced
engineering consulting firm in the nation specializing in the analysis and prevention of
mechanical, structural, and materials failure.

thousands of failures — from airplane crashes to building collapses, from power plant
failures to supertanker sinkings.
We're currently seeking a Research Assistant to work in the Executive Office of our Menlp
Park headquarters. Your responsibilities will include summarizing depositions, conducting
telephone and field surveys, investigating industry and government standards, performing
risk analysis, and editing reports. In doing so, you'll interact with clients and act as a liaison
with Project Engineers.
The candidate we seek is an organized and assertive self-starter with a BA, excellent
interpersonal communication skills, and exceptional telephone and research abilities. In
addition, strong computer aptitude is required, including knowledge of Macintosh word
processing, spreadsheet and graphics applications. A strong mathematical background is
desired. The ability to work well under pressure is essential.
In addition to a stimulating environment, Failure Analysis Associates, Inc.(FaAA) offers a
compensation and benefits package which exceeds industry standards. For immediate
consideration, please send your resume along with a copy of your college transcripts to:
Failure Analysis Associates, Inc., Attn: Mary Caughy, Human Resources, Job # 195, P.O.
Box 3015, Menlo Park, CA 94025 or FAX to (415) 328-3049. FaAA believes in a safe work

opportunity employer.
