# Squaring off on women's issues
## Ireland and Schlafly debate feminism, societal roles 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
If audience reaction to last
night's debate on feminism was any
indication, "what women want" is
not to be quiet and passive.
Speaking before a boisterous, re
active and sometimes rude crowd of
1,500 in Memorial Auditorium, Na
tional Organization for Women
President Patricia Ireland and femi
nist critic Phyllis Schlafly went
round-for-round on the state of the
feminist movement.

Although two of its three spon
sors were conservative organiza
tions, the debate, titled "What do
Women Want?: A Debate on the
Role and Validity of Feminism
Today," was attended by a mostly
liberal crowd. The program was sup
ported by the conservative Young
America's Foundation, the Stanford
Review and the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau.
The handful of pro-lifers distrib
uting pictures of fetuses to the in
coming crowd were outmatched by a
crowded table selling "If you can't

trust me with a choice, how can you
trust me with a child?" bumper
stickers.
Inside, the dichotomies were just
as clear, as the leaders of the liberal
and conservative women's move
ment traded jabs in an hour-and-a
half slugfest.
Presenting an optimistic view of
the future of the feminist move
ment, Ireland reviewed its agenda
— neglect of women's health care,
wage inequality, violence against

women and reproductive choice
— and urged an increased partici
pation of women and minorities
in policy-making roles.
"It's good to finally see fuchsia
and orange dresses in between all
those blue and grey suits."
Schlafly delivered a fiery but
by-the-book conservative argu
ment that American women —
"the most fortunate class of peo
ple on earth" — must take indi
vidual responsibility and not
depend on government to solve all
their problems.
Employing biology as a weapon
against feminism, Schlafly
arg ied, "Feminism is based on a
lift. It's based on the belief that
women and men are the same."
Trying to stem the implication
that feminism is unnatural, Ire
land walked a tight rope by dis
tancing feminism from the les
bian movement while embracing
the movement's goals.
"Some people try to character
ize us as ugly, hairy, man-hating
dykes-on-bikes," she said.
Schlafly, building on her bio
logical argument, provoked some
of the most inspired debate of the
evening about the recent contro
versies over women in the mili

tary. She argued that women are
given easier requirements to
enter combat roles for which they
are not qualified.
Ireland retorted, "I could tell
you after marching next to Marti
na Navratilova that there are
some women I'd rather not be in a

fight (against] ... I mean, who
would you rather get in a fight
with: Martina Navratilova or
Warren Christopher?"
To the jeers of the audience,
Schlafly gave her take on the now
infamous Navy Tailhook covention.
"It's the biggest non-sequitur
in history that the fact that
women couldn't defend them
selves in a hotel corridor with a
couple of drunk men means they
can defend themselves against the
Iraqis or the Serbs," she said.

And later, after being asked a
question about her stance on Tail
hook by a woman who identified
herself as a "non-hairy" lesbian,
Schlafly continued, "Didn't your
mother ever tell you not to go
around drunken sailors?"
The mostly pro-feminist crowd
seemed to calm down after the
speech, happy with the way Ire
land presented their views.
"I think Phyllis Schlafly is very
good at twisting the words of the
feminist movement," said senior
Marlena Byrne. "She uses pseu
do-feminist arguments to under
mine feminism."
But even among the Ireland
supporters, many felt that at least
some of Schlafly's arguments
were legitimate.
"It seems a shame that there a
few good points that Phyllis makes
amidst the rest of what she says,
and you have to throw out the baby
with the bath water," said recent
graduate Tony Glenning.
"I think you should acknowl
edge that men are better for some
jobs and that there are jobs
women are better for. Men and
women are better at different
things — like tall people are bet
ter for basketball."
Junior Alex Lustberg said that
although he didn't agree with
Schlafly he did not find her argu
ments offensive. "I was more
offended by people hissing," he said.
