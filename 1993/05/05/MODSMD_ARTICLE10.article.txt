SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Bosnian Muslim leaders report
ed that Bosnian Serbs attacked and set
the Muslim town of Zepa ablaze yester
day, killing or wounding as many as 100
people. But the Serbs said that Muslims
attacked the town to provoke interna
tional military intervention.
The reports come on the eve of a cru
cial meeting of the Bosnian Serbs' self
styled assembly, which is meeting to
reconsider a U.N. peace plan. The par
liament is the last holdout to the plan to
end the year-long war.
"(Zepa) is burning. It has been
attacked by artillery — all size calibers,"
said Zeljko Grubesik, a staff member at
the Bosnian army operations center.
Town official Fadil Heljic said over
ham radio to Zagreb, Croatia, that Serb
infantries were advancing and that the
area was shelled by heavy artillery.
The Bosnian Serbs, who have seized

about 70 percent of Bosnia in a year of
warfare, accused the Muslims of attack
ing Zepa to discredit Serbs on the eve of
the two-day parliament session. It was
not known when they intended to vote
on the plan.
The Bosnian Serb command, in a fax
to The Associated Press, suggested the
Muslims timed the attack to provoke
international military intervention.
President Clinton is considering military
action, such as bombing Serb artillery.
There was no independent confirma
tion of a new offensive. A U.N. peace
keepers' spokesman in Zagreb, Peter
Osborne, said U.N. military observers
would be sent to Zepa and the Muslim
enclave of Gorazde today.
The Bosnian government called for an
urgent meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to discuss Zepa, which reported
ly shelters up to 40,000 residents and
refugees and is one of only two Muslim-

held enclaves in eastern Bosnia. The
town has been under periodic fire for
months.
The council took no action on the
Bosnian request for an urgent session
on Zepa, although it did meet on other
related matters.
Bosnia's U.N. envoy in New York,
Mohammed Sacirbey, said his foreign
ministry had intercepted orders from a
local Bosnian Serb commander "to burn
down Zepa, to kill all alive and, regard
less of losses, take over Zepa."
The reported attacks came two days
after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic signed the U.N. peace plan —
already signed by the other warring fac
tions, Muslims and Croats.
A Bosnian Serb onslaught on Zepa
could be the work of Bosnian Serbs dis
gruntled at Karadzic's action or simply
a land grab before the peace plan takes
effect.
