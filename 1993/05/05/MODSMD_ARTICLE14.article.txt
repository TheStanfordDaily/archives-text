The foreign-language
requirement should be
based on equivalency

PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS?
espanol? — Can
Stanford students talk the
talk of the University's current
foreign-language requirement?
With the wide range of quality
educations (or lack thereof) stu
dents receive from high schools,
people are finding that fulfilling
the requirement means very differ
ent things for different students.
The existing inequities defeat
the purpose of having the require
ment at all, and essentially allow
students to graduate with widely
ranging levels of fluency in their
language of choice.
The current policy states that
students who have had three years
of high school study in a language
are exempted from the require
ment. Those who do not must pass
at least a first-year, third-quarter
course.
As University President Ger
hard Casper calls for a revalua
tion of undergraduate education,
the inconsistencies of the foreign
language requirement should be
one of the first areas addressed.
The requirement needs to be
much more equalized for all stu
dents, so that a certain level of flu
ency — rather than number of
years of high-school classes — con
stitutes a sufficient knowledge of a
foreign language.
While Stanford's relatively rig
orous and fast-paced programs
may provide a sufficient working
knowledge of a foreign language,
not all high schools can do the
same, even in three years.
Furthermore, as most high
schools face tight financial times,
foreign language is often one of the
first programs cut. This means
teachers are spread too thin, or
worse, higher-level classes or entire
languages get axed altogether.

The foreign-language require
ment, as it now stands, punishes
students from high schools with
weak foreign-language programs
in two ways: students who cannot
take third-year classes in the lan
guage of their choice lose the
opportunity to fulfill it, and stu
dents who do fill it do so with an
insufficient background.
Instead of assuming a certain
amount of knowledge based on
years in high schools, tests should
be administered at Stanford to
evaluate fluency. If a student can
demonstrate a skill level equiva
lent to first year, third-quarter —
or whatever the preferred level is
— then he or she is exempt from
the requirement.
College Board Advanced Place
ment tests, which are standard
ized, can continue to be a fair mea
surement of skill level as well. Stu
dents who score high enough to
exemplify the required level of
knowledge should be exempt from
taking the aforementioned tests.
Since the University's foreign
language departments already give
placement tests — which are cur
rently for the students' benefit
only — at the beginning of every
academic year, making these tests
slightly more extensive and
required of all students who do not
have Advanced Placement credit
should be feasible.
The added paperwork is a small
price to pay to make the require
ment fair for all students.
While Casper has expressed a
need to reexamine the level of flu
ency in a foreign language that
Stanford demands of its students,
whether or not this given level is
equally determined for all students
should be addressed first.
In a time when the world is
becoming increasingly internation
al, Casper's emphasis on foreign
language should be lauded, along
with the University's strong pro
grams — both at Stanford and
overseas.
In order to insure the success of
these goals, any requirement set
forth needs to promote equality as
well as fluency.
