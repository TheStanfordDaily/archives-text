## The
						real truth about sex 
### 
DOING THE NASTY. Songs are
written about it, careers are ruined
because of it and cult heroes are
born in the midst of it. Why is it that guys
like Wilt Chamberlain are idolized, yet
someone who is abstinent is laughed at?
Isaac Newton never had sex, which prob
ably has most of you thinking he was
some kind of nerd. Actually, he consid
ered it his "greatest triumph."
Sex is the greatest thing since the
invention of the mirrored ceiling. Every
one says so. And there are so many good
things about it.
For one, it's a good excuse to wash
your sheets. And you satisfy that weird
urge for a while. You know the urge I'm
talking about. That feeling you got
watching the substitute English teacher
in eighth grade who wore the skirt and
black pantyhose.
But people seem to forget about the
bad stuff. Sex can have some pretty un
fun consequences.
First off, sex might lead to an unwant
ed pregnancy, which brings us to the
abortion issue, which everyone pretty
much agrees is a bad scene. Pro-lifers and
pro-choicers both say that someone is
going to endure a lot of pain, whether it's
a viable fetus with a brain wave, or a
would-be mother that must deal with the
consequences by herself.
So we push contraceptives, unfortu
nately a little bit harder than we push

education. We talk of different ways of
preventing impregnation while still
enjoying the blissful moments of sex. I
remember reading an article in a maga
zine that rated different sodas in their
ability to kill sperm if used as a douche.
We will stick a Diet Dr. Pepper where it
was never intended to go, just so that we
can enjoy a little nookie here and there.
Secondly, sex can kill you. Kill. It used
to be that it was just a "social" disease
here and there. Get a shot, lay low for a
month or so, and everything got better.
But not any more. Ever since the HIV
virus reared its immune little head, it's
been causing a lot of problems. You catch
it, you die. End of story. The number one
method of transmittal is through sex,
which is bad news for today's sexually
promiscuous society.
Apparently a new strand of AIDS may
have been discovered one that goes
through condoms.
So what do we do now? Find a differ
ent type of protection, I suppose â€” until
that isn't sufficient any more, and so on
until a cure is found, if ever. Or else we
could have sex in full body armor until
the AIDS virus naturally develops tiny
blow torches.
But I know a better method. One that
is 100-percent effective against the trials
of abortion, sexually transmitted AIDS
and the sad morning-after feeling. It's
called abstinence.

So does that mean no sex? Yep.
I'm not saying sex is bad. I'm all for
the furtherance of the species. Yet absti
nence, celibacy and monogamy are excel
lent solutions to problems such as AIDS
and unwanted pregnancies, but are con
sidered "unrealistic." I'm just trying to
point out a sure-fire, and often over
looked, method to prevent a lot of pain.
Call it a super-contraceptive.
Sex is popularized because people
seem to alienate themselves from the
concept of delayed gratification. Get it
now, get it fast, get it while you can
because it might not be there for you
later. Don't worry about the conse
quences.
I don't know that this is a lack of edu
cation as much as it's a lack of maturity
and responsibility.
No, it's not easy, especially with soci
ety screaming at us to do the deed in
movies, music and beer ads. It's not a
solution that's commonly given a lot of
thought. Sex is just there, kind of like
taxes. Don't question it. But maybe it's
time we should.
No one ever died from abstinence.
