Daily unfairly stereotyped fraternities in recent editorial

Reading your editorial on
April 29, "When dry means dry,"
we felt it necessary to respond to
two points that you made. The first of
these is the condemnation of a punish
ment involving community service, and
the second is the allegation that fraterni
ties seek to "buy rushees with alcohol."
Regarding punishments, we would
urge you to concentrate on the effects of a
punishment as well as the causes for it.
Dealing out heavy, purely punitive pun
ishments creates no gain for anybody,
while sets of positive punishments at
least provide the opportunity for a group
in need to gain from a situation. Further
more, community service would prove
effective in getting individuals, or groups
of individuals, involved in constructive
activities, rather than merely forcing
them to go elsewhere to attend parties.

We would like to strenuously agree
with The Daily's main premise that "you
can't buy Rushees with alcohol." Keeping
this in mind, it is easy to see why the
argument that the presence of alcohol
could have created an "uneven playing
field" during Rush is ludicrous and
underestimates the integrity and individ
uality of Stanford undergraduates.
Furthermore, not only would it be
impossible to "buy" a Rushee in this
manner, it would contradict all of the
goals of our organization and the individ
uality and strength of character which
make Kappa Sigma unique not only in
the Greek System, but in the University.
The challenge and focus of Kappa Sigma
is to live with and develop strong rela
tions with a group of men. With this
group we interact as a self-directed set of
individuals. Each member plays a role in

shaping both the character and the func
tions of the house, and each member rep
resents the group each time he speaks or
acts outside the house.
This is the essence of collective respon
sibility; it is imperative that we carefully
select our membership, because Kappa
Sigma is responsible for the individual
actions and attitudes of its members —
unlike any non-Greek student residence.
Therefore, anyone who could be coerced
by a single beer to join a house is not the
individual who could contribute in this
atmosphere.
Admittedly, the role alcohol plays in
the social functions of fraternities is not
insignificant. Yet, it is unfortunate that
outside organizations such as The Daily
have chosen not to move beyond the
"Animal House" stereotype and recognize
that the real reasons why an outstanding

group of young men chose to become
pledges at Kappa Sigma this year had
nothing to do with alcohol.
If nothing else, the implication that
the isolated presence of alcohol could
have interfered with the decision-making
process of a rushee gives no merit to the
confidence, individuality and open-mind
edness of freshmen who decide to rush.
To stereotype individuals interested in
fraternities is as contradictor to the lib
eral, open-minded polity endorsed by The
Daily, the Greek system and the Univer
sity as stereotyping any other group of
individuals on campus.
