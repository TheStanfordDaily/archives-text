# Mai denies evidence of support for Asian-American Studies
## 
### 
We are writing to respond to Kenny
Mai's April 30 column, which included
criticism of Asian-American Studies.
Contrary to Mai's statement that the
"proposed Asian-American Studies
would have "dubious" populari
ty, we point out that the Independent
Survey on Asian-American Studies
reported that over 65 percent of 1,062
Stanford students surveyed support the
establishment of an Asian-American
Studies mqjor, along with 20 percent
who are strongly in favor of such a pro
gram.
Mai's attempt at humor about Stan
ford graduates driving forklifts fails to
understand the purpose of an Asian-
American Studies mqor. "Big Foreman

Jim" probably will not care if his fork
lift drivers have a diploma at all, much
less a degree in Asian-American Stud
ies. However, he may care about his
employees' ability to work in a diverse
environment; by the year 2000 the
mtyority of the workforce will consist
of women and minorities. A degree in
Asian-American Studies could promote
cultural understanding in the work
place.
Mai asks if Asian-American Studies
merits a Hundreds of students
say "yes." The ASSU Senate said "yes"
when they unanimously passed a bill
supporting the establishment of an
Asian-American Studies mtyor. Consid
ering that Asian-Americans are the
fastest growing ethnic group in the
United States, Stanford's handful of
Asian-American Studies courses is inad
equate. We believe that the process of
establishing an Asian-American Studies
would in itself facilitate the cre
ation of more courses. In addition, a
mÂ«yor is a formal recognition that a stu

dent has pursued a subject in depth.
Without a there is no guidance
for students who wish to focus in a par
ticular field of study. Mai inaccurately
stated that only 70 people attended the
recent rally for Asian-American Studies
and assumes that even fewer of that
group would in that discipline.
There is no direct correlation between
the attendance at the rally and the num
ber of students interested in an Asian-
American Studies mqjor. We refer again
to the Independent Survey, but also
assert that the merit of a mtyor lies not
only in the numbers of interested stu
dents, but also in its social and academic
worth.
Mai states that if there is so much
interest in Asian-American Studies, why
are there not "more student-initiated
seminars." Over the last two decades
there have been many student-initiated
seminars, including SWOPSIs, on Asian-
American Studies. These seminars arose
because of interest, but could not be sus
tained because of lack of institutional-

ized support. Currently, a group of stu
dents are establishing a course on Asian-
American community issues that will be
offered this fall. This initiative is a sign
of the ongoing interest in Asian-Ameri
can Studies.
Finally, we do not believe that the
movement for Asian-American Studies
at Stanford is "an idiotic game of one
upmanship between the various ethnic
and cultural groups on campus." The
students of color communities support
each other's efforts to improve their
respective ethnic-studies curriculum.
For example, members of the
Chicano/Latino community spoke at the
Asian-American Studies rally. Despite
one columnist's opinions, the communi
ties of color, hundreds of Stanford stu
dents and the ASSU Senate share simi
lar concerns about ethnic studies at
Stanford.
