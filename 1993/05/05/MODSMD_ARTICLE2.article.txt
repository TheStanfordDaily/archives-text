# Late-night competition
## New Toyon cafe to offer fro yo, coffee 
### Sandy Lee 
First there was late-night pizza. Then there
was Nick's Diner. Now the Toyon Eating Clubs
plan to join in the late-night residential dining
scene with next month's opening of the "Ter
race."
The Terrace will feature a frozen-yogurt
shop and cafe that will be cheaper than Tresid
der's Corner Pocket and other local yogurt
shops, its founders say. The student-run oper
ation will also be open for later than most cam
pus locations, from 10 a.m. to 1 a.m.
"Hopefully the combination of the price and
late hours will make it successful," said senior
Tracy Kim, one of the four Toyon residents
who have been working on this project.
"It fills a market hole," said Matt Pozos,
general manager of Toyon's eating clubs.
"There's nothing like this" on the east side of
campus.
Although he admits there are risks, "I think
it will be very successful," Pozos said. "I believe
we will at least break even. This is like a fund
raiser for the (eating) clubs, and it's something
people have wanted for a long time."

'We want people to feel
comfortable planting
themselves and just
hanging out'

Since the eating clubs are non-profit, earn
ings from the cafe will be used to finance phys
ical repairs to the clubs that the University
does not fund, Pozos said.
The Terrace will be located in what was for
merly the El Tigre eating club, which closed
last year. The four entrepreneurs plan to work
at the cafe during the summer and through the
next academic year.
For the past few weeks, they have been re
modeling the former eating club, painting and
installing new wallpaper and tile. The Terrace
will have a "natural" cafe setting — bright,
with green and creme hues, Kim said. Long ta

bles for studying will fill the main floor, while a
loft area will hold smaller tables.
"We want people to feel comfortable planti
ng themselves and just hanging out," said se
nior Jen Smith.
Kim said the cafe will offer a variety of
frozen yogurt flavors, fruit smoothies, baked
goods and fountain coffee drinks. The yogurt
flavors will change every couple of days like
other yogurt shops, Kim said.
Sophomores Kibo Kitahama and Nick Mang
developed the idea of serving a type of smooth
ie that is made of ice, fruit and sugar rather
than a milk or cream base. They had consid
ered opening up their own business before
being approached by Kim and Smith, who had
been working in a frozen yogurt shop.
Kitahama said he missed the smoothies,
which are extremely popular in his hometown
of New Orleans. He has been blending the
drinks with Mang since fall quarter, trying new
tastes and testing them out on eating club
members.
"After experimenting and playing around,
we came up with six to eight good
flavors," said Kitahama, adding
that his recipe is "similar to the

ones back home, but with a twist."
Before remodeling, the four
founders conducted market
research and evaluated prices in
area yogurt shops and cafes.
"With four people giving
everything they have, I'm sure
this is going to be a success,"
Kitahama said.
