## Playing with fire, honoring my loving mother 
### 
HONOR THY MOTHER. Yes, fel
low oblivious Stanford students, a
world-shaping event is snapping
at our heels. Bigger than national Rabbit
Droppings Day. Bigger than Take-Your-
Daughter-To-Work Day. Bigger than
Nibble Your Neighbor's Ear Day.
Bigger than a Casper big-hair day.
Good god, it's Mother's Day.
It's time to run out to Mills the Florist
and order the most loving, expressive,
utterly spontaneous coffee mug you can
find — filled with the smelliest, cheapest,
most repulsive flowers you can get away
with — and mail them off to your mother.
You shouldn't have.
And the mushy card, don't forget the
mushy card. Say something nice. "Thanks
for the years of mental abuse" or "thanks
for suddenly having to make a pot of coffee
in front of the kitchen window during
every post-date walk to the front door in
the high school," or even the succinct
"thanks for the big-feet genes" will do.
She carried you for nine months, it's
the least you can do.
I love Mother's Day. There's nothing

quite like taking a few weeks to plan the
oh-so-perfect gift for the light of my life,
the woman who made me what I am
today, the saint who smacked my elbow
with the flat edge of her knife every time
I held my fork wrong at the dinner table.
Sit up straight.
Somehow I always get all misty-eyed
and homesick in the process, and turn
immediately to the comfort of the heart
felt, yet witty and original, "Stanford
Mom" or "My kid and my money go to
Stanford" Bookstore sweatshirt in hip,
stylish pseudo-earth-tones.
It's so nice to know you care.
Ah, my mother. . . the stories I could
tell. How can an oversized sweatshirt she
can pull over her butt repay the woman
who laughed at me only occasionally dur
ing those awkward junior-high and early
high-school years? The years giggling at
my inheritance of her flat chest?
Puberty, the best revenge.
How can I not wax nostalgic about my
personal role model, the woman who
taught me the utter necessity of fancy
undergarments on dates with action

potential? Who taught me the power of
high heels? Who made me realize the
importance of a smooth bikini line?
Yes, sitting wide-eyed at the breakfast
table at age 14, an androgynous sprite
bereft of all sexual urges, my mother sat
me down to have The Talk. The horrors of
pregnancy. The inherent evil that was the
male species. Kick 'em in the Crotch 101.
You underestimate the power of the
maternal instinct.
Au contraire, my mother didn't want
to see the sniveling, prudish goody-goody
who sat before her. She wanted populari
ty, spunk, detention, a phone call or two
at 3 a.m. Oh, did my mother have a few
words of wisdom to impart.
"You know, Tishie, you don't have to
wait until you're married to have sex."
Thanks a million. She says this to me,
the hormone-less elf, devoid of any social
skills whatsoever; the one who couldn't
get a date even if she traded a whole box
of twinkies for it. My mother sat across
the table, smoking a cigarette, peering at
me with that "trust me, I'm your moth
er" look that brings grown countries into

the free market. A woman who was get
ting unlimited action from my dad, snick
ering at her sexually inactive daughter.
"It's a lot of fun," she grinned.
Let's work on the kiss thing first, Ma.
It would be impossible to stage a fitting
tribute to the woman who cut my hair
with an actual porcelain bowl just when
appearance was becoming so important to
me. Who wouldn't let me go to the Our
Lady of Guadalupe dance, even when my
friends called up to say that Frank "I drive
a Porsche in my freshman year" Zaluske
was asking for me. Who wrote my time of
arrival into our dead-end-street driveway,
as well as the time of departure of my date,
on the refrigerator every morning of the
summer after my senior year.
Mother knows best.
It brings tears to my eyes to think of all
the heart-to-heart talks we have had, at only
semi-offensive noise levels. All the week
ends spent out at the track running 4405,
with my mother's yells resounding over the
next 40 city blocks. All the read notes and
listened-in-on phone conversations.
Family Values R Us.

But, she was a woman who could
acknowledge defeat after preparing some
obscure, yet undoubtedly fatal, fish recipe,
breaking out the vanilla ice cream without
any hesitance. A woman who let me sit on
her lap through my senior year in high
school, calming down her little stress bun
dle so I could face the next day. A woman
who realized the empowerment a nice-look
ing, non-sale-rack prom dress could bring.
A woman who could bring high-school
principals to their knees.
Now, we've gotten the long-distance
thing down pat. She asks my lust-interest
du jour, and I ask about her gopher
killing exploits. She teils me about the
new kids she's gotten into college at my
old high school, and I tell her about
alleged class participation. Minimal
kvetching. Minimal advice. After all these
years, we got it right.
I love you, mommy dearest.

as well as the time of departure of my date,
on the refrigerator every morning of the
summer after my senior year.
Mother knows best.
It brings tears to my eyes to think of all
the heart-to-heart talks we have had, at only
semi-offensive noise levels. All the week
ends spent out at the track running 4405,
with my mother's yells resounding over the
next 40 city blocks. All the read notes and
listened-in-on phone conversations.
Family Values R Us.

But, she was a woman who could
acknowledge defeat after preparing some
obscure, yet undoubtedly fatal, fish recipe,
breaking out the vanilla ice cream without
any hesitance. A woman who let me sit on
her lap through my senior year in high
school, calming down her little stress bun
dle so I could face the next day. A woman
who realized the empowerment a nice-look
ing, non-sale-rack prom dress could bring.
A woman who could bring high-school
principals to their knees.
Now, we've gotten the long-distance
thing down pat. She asks my lust-interest
du jour, and I ask about her gopher
killing exploits. She teils me about the
new kids she's gotten into college at my
old high school, and I tell her about
alleged class participation. Minimal
kvetching. Minimal advice. After all these
years, we got it right.
I love you, mommy dearest.
