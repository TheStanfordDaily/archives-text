## Sleep scientists learn how biological clock works Discovery sheds light on the clock's mechanisms that keep us awake during the day and sleepy at night 
### Julie Sauer 
Stanford sleep researchers now
know why procrastinating students can
pull all-nighters and still have a surge
of early morning energy.
But more importantly, this new
research on the body's cycles of sleep
and wakefulness may lead to the cure of
sleep disorders.
Previously, scientists established
that the body's biological clock, two
tiny lobe-shaped areas in the brain,
controlled sleep patterns.
"We didn't know if the clock promot
ed sleep or wakefulness or both," said
Dale Edgar, a senior research associate
in the Psychiatry Department. He said
the new experimental evidence clarifies
how the body's clock works.
To determine the clock's function,
Edgar studied squirrel monkeys whose
biological clocks had been removed.
The animals behaved normally, but
exhibited irregular sleep patterns.
Instead of sleeping for eight hours
during a 24-hour period, they slept 12
hours — at random times — whenever
they were tired.
Using the results of the experiment,
Edgar concluded that in monkeys with
clocks, the clock had strong effects on
the monkeys.
It kept them awake for a period of 12
hours, out of a 24-hour period. Then,
the clock became quieter during the
next 12 hours — resulting in drowsy
and sleepy monkeys.
The monkeys without a clock had no
waking signal, so they slept whenever
they felt tired.
Edgar's experiment shows that the

body clock promotes wakefulness
through some sort of waking signal.
"This is a turning point," he said.
"Because for the longest time we didn't
know functionally how the body regu
lates sleep and wakefulness."
The mechanism of the waking signal
is unknown and is the subject of
Edgar's present research.
The regulating mechanism in squir-

regulates sleep and wake
fulness.'

rel monkeys is probably similar to the
human mechanism. Edgar explained
that cycles of sleep and waking consist
of two opponent forces. One is the wak
ing signal of the biological clock. The
opposing force is sleep homeostasis,
which is the increased need to sleep
after being awake.
During the day, the clock emits the
waking signal — the body stays alert
but accumulates a sleep deficit.
At night, the clock's signal subsides
and the effects of sleep homeostasis
dominate. Sleeping occurs since the
waking signal no longer resists sleep.
Each morning, the waking signal
activates at a regular time. So even if a
person goes to bed late, he or she will

still feel a surge of alertness at the
usual time in the morning.
This explains how a student can stay
awake all night writing a paper and still
be alert enough in the morning to bike
to class.
Although sleep loss occurs during
the night, the clock's signal is still on
cycle. It overcomes the drive to sleep
and allows the student to stay awake in
the morning.
The new research does more than
provide explanations about students
pulling all-nighters; it may also offer
hope for relieving sleep disorders asso
ciated with jet lag and night-shift work.
Edgar explains that these problems
are a result of an individual's inability
to sleep at certain times. "He or she
tries to sleep when the clock says 'no.' "
Jet lag ends when the clock resynchro
nizes with the new time schedule.
The research has also created
numerous opportunities for pharma
ceutical companies.
These firms could develop drugs that
induce the clock to activate or inhibit
the alert signal — depending whether
the person wanted to be awake or asleep.
The sleep experiment also offers a
glimmer of hope for victims of age
related sleep disorders. In older people,
their waking signal becomes less effec
tive. With a weaker signal, the person
will sleep during the day, resulting in
less of a drive to sleep at night because
of the reduced sleep deficit.
The disorder most relevant to Stan
ford students is probably sleep depriva
tion. The biological clock still operates
on a regular cycle, but students simply
attempt to ignore the need to sleep.
