/*V Vegetables are supposed to be healthy,
right? Then where do we get vegetable oil
from ? I mean, where are these oily vegetables
anyway?
— Unctuous and Concerned
A: Don't worry. Squeeze as hard as you
might, you'll never get an appreciable vol
ume of oil from a carrot. The vast majority of
vegetable lubricants (for example, Wesson™)
come from seeds grown specifically for pro
cessing into oil; the veggies in the produce sec
tion at the supermarket are, by and large,
safe.
The plants cultivated for their oil are
numerous and diverse: In a single Safeway,
you can find oils derived from corn, cotton
seed, olive, peanut, coconut, sunflower seed,
soybean, safflower, sesame, mustard, red
palm and the dubiously named (but probably
harmless) rape seed.
The oils are harvested from their parent
seeds by one of three methods. The simplest is
"rendering," in which the seeds are boiled and
the oil is skimmed from the top of the heating
vessel. In those cases where high tempera
tures are to be avoided, one can employ the
technique of "pressing" — in which the seeds
are crushed and squeezed in hydraulic presses
until the oil issues forth.
A more modern technique, solvent extrac
tion, involves immersion of the seeds in a liq
uid that leaches out the oil and leaves every
thing else behind (the remains are often
toasted and pelletized for use in animal
feeds).
As far as healthiness goes, vegetable oils
are indeed basically all triglycerides (read:
"fat"), and they have more calories per gram
than any other foodstuff. Furthermore, they
contain no protein and no vitamins save traces
of carotenes (precursors of vitamin A) and, to
be fair, reasonable amounts of the antioxi
dant vitamin E.
But heck, fat is fat. The average American

gets only 40 percent of dietary fat from isolat
ed oils; the rest comes from bulk food. Even if
calories are a worry to you, the effort it would
take to eliminate every last drop of Wesson
from your system (assuming, of course, that it
entered your body in the conventional way)
might be better spent jogging.

How do they make popcorn (you know,
Kvfrorn the fresh corn state to the unpopped,
hard little kernels state in the Orville Reden
bacher jar)? Also, is there a difference between
popcorn labelled "Popcorn" and popcorn
labelled "Hot Air Popcorn" (the little kernels
all look the same to me)?
— Ann N. and Erin G.
A : I love being from Nebraska, if only
xTLbecause once in a while you smug coast
huggers really do embarrass yourselves.
There seems to be a presumption in our
culture that all food — especially recreational
snacks — must be processed in some way.
Well, that presumption is wrong.
People grow popcorn — just like they grow
regular corn — in an irrigated field under an
open sky. When the ears look ready, someone
(the "farmer") drives a big machine (a "trac
tor") out into the field and harvests them.
Closer to an urban center, in a factory (an
artifact of technology with which you are
doubtless more familiar), the popcorn kernels
are taken out of their original packaging (the
"husk") and separated from the hard thing in
the middle of the ear (the "cob") and put in

jars bearing the picture of a foolish old white
man wearing suspenders.
Popcorn is a genetic variant of the domestic
corn plant Zea mays. It's been around for a
while: thousand-year-old popcorn kernels
have been found in archaeological digs in
locales as diverse as Peru and Utah. The first
European explorers (oops, sorry —
"invaders") of North America described
indigenous peoples toasting popcorn for food
and decoration.
All corn kernels contain a starchy, food
storage tissue known as the endosperm. In
seeds of popcorn, the hull and outer
endosperm are very hard and tough, with a
very small inner mass of moist, soft
endosperm in the center of the kernel.
Although Western science, in all its glory,
has not elucidated the exact mechanism by
which popcorn manages to pop, it has provid
ed a rough outline: Vapor trapped in individu
al grains of the soft central starch expands
when the kernel is heated. The resulting pres
sure increase ruptures the hull, and the inner
endosperm expands to around 30 times the
original seed volume.
There are two subvarieties of corn in com
mon use as popcorns, easily distinguished on
the basis of seed morphology. Kernels of rice
popcorn are pointed at the base and apex,
whereas the more popular pearl popcorn has
rounded, compact seeds.
There's not much distinction between
types of popcorn; hot-air, microwave and
conventional corn are all drawn from the
same crops. Any differences between pop
corns in these commercial categories are less
noticeable than differences between pop
corns from the same category made by differ
ent companies.
So, there it is. But next week, I'm sure, you
city folk will be asking me where they breed all
those non-fat cows.
