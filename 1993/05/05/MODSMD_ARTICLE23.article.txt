Students present paper
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands — week,
two Stanford students presented papers at
INTERCHI '93, an international meeting for
human-computer interface workers.
Jonathan Steuer, a graduate student in
communication, and Ellen Tauber, a graduate
student in computer science, reported on an
experiment they have been working on with
Communication Prof. Cliff Nass.
The experiment tests (to find out) which
computer characteristics generate social
responses from individuals during comput
er/hu-man interactions.
The Stanford paper was just one, among
hundreds, presented at the conference.
Approximately 15,000 scientists, computer
programers and designers gathered from all
over the world to show results of their work
concerning computer interaction.
Conferences like this one advance research
and encourage sharing of data to futher
empower technologies such as virtual reality.

New data on gamma rays
New findings from a NASA satellite indi
cate that gamma-ray bursts, one of the mys

teries of space, may be more energetic than
once thought.
At a press conference last week, NASA
scientists said that the new data dispells
previous gamma-ray theories and indicates
that these high-energy radiation bursts may
be caused by unknown objects or phenome
na in the universe.
The satellite, launched in April 1991,
observed the highest ever gamma-ray burst
on Jan. 31. NASA scientists dubbed it the
"Super Bowl Burst" because it was seen on
Super Bowl Sunday.
The "Super" burst was more than 100
times brighter at its peak than the brightest
steady source of gamma rays that come from
our galaxy. The data disproved previous
models explaining gamma-ray bursts.
A previous explaination described the
bursts as energy releases from neutron
stars, confined to the Milky Way galaxy and
a region, or "halo," surrounding it. A neu
tron star is a dense remnant core of a star
that has exploded in a supernova.
According to scientists, the new data
shows that gamma-ray bursts are not con
fined to one part of the galaxy, but are emit
ted from all directions and vary in intensity
and structure.
Others propose that the gamma rays are

the thermal energy released when two black
holes collide. Black holes are stars that have
collapsed to such high density that even
light cannot escape their huge gravitational
pull.
The "Super" burst dispelled this theory,
since the burst of gamma rays are not of the
thermal type.
Breast implant problems
WASHINGTON (AP) — Doctors said yes
terday that unusual immune disorders in chil
dren whose mothers have breast implants
indicate that silicone may be leaking into
mothers' breast milk or into the womb.
Several of these disorders appear in chil
dren as intestinal problems. Although the evi
dence is inconclusive as yet, two doctors
believe it merits further study.
Dr. Jeremiah Levine of Schneider Chil
dren's Hospital in New Hyde Park, and Dr. M.
Eric Gershwin of UC-Davis, have both started
to examine children who may have problems
related to their mothers' implants.
Dow Corning Corporation, the manufac
turer of the silicone implants, stopped produc
ing them in March 1992 after studies in rats
showed that silicone altered the immune sys
tems.
