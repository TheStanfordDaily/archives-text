# Learn why your nose itches and runs
## An allergy alert 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
It's a good time to buy stock
in Kleenex.
Why? Because spring quar
ter is allergy season and
chances are you've probably
seen a swell in the number of
people with itchy noses, watery
eyes and puffy cheeks lately.
Allergies effect about 40-50
million Americans annually,
and most of the resulting
sneezin* and wheezin' accom
panies the springtime bloom.
That's because spring is the
season when microscopic parti
cles from trees, flowers and
grasses are carried in the air as
part of the plant life-cycle.

Allergies effect
about 40-50 million
Americans annually,
resulting in sneezin'
and wheesin'.

While the new flowers that
spring up may look nice,
they're nothing but a problem
for a lot of people.
Not everyone has a bad reac
tion to inhaling particles like
pollen. Family history and
change of environments seem
to dictate who gets allergies
and who doesn't.
When a outside particle
called an allergen — for exam
ple, pollen, dust or mold —
enters a person's nose it meets
one of two fates. In many peo
ple, it will simply be moved
along by the mucus in the nasal
passages to the throat where it
is swallowed (yum!) or coughed
out.
But in the nose of an allergy
sufferer, when an allergen
touches down on the mucous
membranes it is not so gra
ciously received. Allergens get
handled in the same way the
body handles invaders like bac
teria or viruses: by firing up the
immune system against them.
In these people, the
immune-system attack on the
foreign invader immediately
causes cells in surrounding tis
sues known as mast cells to
release a powerful inflammato
ry chemical known as his
tamine.
Histamine, in turn, causes a
sequence of events aimed at
flushing the foreign particle
out of the body and that's
where the Kleenex comes in. A
sneeze is one way the body tries
to remove the allergen — by
hurling it back out from where
it came.
In addition, histamine caus

es the small blood vessels lining
the nose to enlarge, releasing
fluids to carry the invader away
— hence the runny nose and
swollen nasal passages that
characterize those with aller
gies.
Antihistamines, like Sel
dane, Hismanol and Sudafed
are drugs that work to counter
the effects of histamine. They
work by reducing nasal conges
tion and swelling. They also
relieve watery eyes and sneez
ing and itching noses.
But, antihistamines do not
treat allergies. They treat the
symptoms that are caused by
allergies. As a result, a person
must continue to take antihis
tamines to prevent these symp
toms from recurring or to stop
them when they do occur.
To actually treat allergies,
one must be sensitized to them.
In other words, the body must
be trained not to regard the
particular allergen as a foreign
attacker and to treat it like any
other particle.
Immunotherapy, a fancy
name for allergy shots, is the
process by which this is done.
Allergy shots are actually con
centrated mixes of an allergen.
By injecting a small amount of
the allergen into the blood
stream, the body increases its
line of defense, slowly produc
ing special antibodies.
Over time, enough antibod
ies are produced so that when
allergens enter the body again,
the immune system will not
send out an alert to create
more attackers. In other
words, the allergic reaction
won't occur.
Being able to identify and
avoid what you are allergic to
might save you from painful
allergy shots, but many aller
gens are hidden and difficult to
recognize. Dust, mold and plant
particles can hide in carpet,
blankets and in clothes.
Some allergies are too ran
dom to identify. For example,
many people are allergic to
pets. For a long time it was
thought that animal dander, or
dry skin, caused the allergic
response. But these people
actually are allergic to the pro
teins that are found in animal
saliva that becomes airborne
when animals lick themselves.
So, the next time you sneeze,
don't take it lightly. Think of
invading antigens engaging
against an army of antibodies,
in the immuno-war between
good and evil.
