## Salzenstein soars beyond expectations for netters 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Top junior-circuit tennis recruits are anything
but uncommon at Stanford. It is not surprising,
then, that despite his No. 2 U.S. Junior ranking, Jeff
Salzenstein stepped into Stanford Tennis Stadium
last fall as one of a handful of fresh young faces hop
ing to crack the prestigious Cardinal starting lineup.
But the Englewood, Colo, native is more than just
another top recruit.
Starting in every one of Stanford's matches this
season, mostly in the No. 5 spot, Salzenstein has
built up the best singles record on the team (18-4)
and claimed wins over USC's Andras Lanyi, a Hun
garian Davis Cup player, and UCLA's Fritz Bissell,
the current Pacific 10 Conference individual cham
pion.
Although he stands out among his teammates,
there are no big secrets behind Salzenstein's success
— he combines solid strokes, quiet self-confidence
and a genuine desire to be a team player in a sport
known for its individual focus.
"[Playing tennisl is a lot easier with teammates,"
Salzenstein said. "Just hearing them cheering for
you ... and if you have a bad day you can count on
the guys to pull you through."
Yet after years of individual play on the junior cir
cuit, Salzenstein also found that playing for a team
brought some added stress. "At first, I was really
worried about letting people down," he said. "I had
seen [the older players'] names on drawsheets for
years in the juniors. It was pretty intimidating to be
playing with them ... I think sometimes you fear
things you don't know."
The intimidation factor died quickly, however, as
Salzenstein began to assert his dominance. Others
began to recognize his value to the team as well. In
February, the Cardinal traveled to California, where
Salzenstein challenged a highly touted freshman,
Casey Louie, and won solidly, 6-3, 6-3.
"From the beginning I thought [Salzenstein] was
a solid, gritty player, but I wondered if he could step
it up for big matches," said teammate Chris Cocotos.
"When he beat [Louie] I finally realized that he
could put some zip in his game. He always bends, but
he never breaks."
Just as Salzenstein was gaining confidence and
becoming comfortable with his role on the team,
the Cardinal traveled to Los Angeles, where

Salzenstein and Stanford were crushed by No. 1
UCLA and No. 2 USC. Losing 6-0 in the third set to
the Bruins' Bissell on that trip was a big blow to
the freshman.
"I felt like I let the team down," Salzenstein said.
"And then the next day (at USC) I didn't even show
up. I just got blown off the court (by Adam Peterson,
6-2, 6-1)."
This low point set the stage for Salzenstein's
most triumphant performances of the season —
rematches with the Trojans and Bruins on Cardinal
turf. On a blazing Friday afternoon, in front of 900
cheering fans, the freshman battled for three sets
with the Trojans' Lanyi before eking out a win to
keep Cardinal victory hopes alive.
"I could just feel the excitement in the air," he
said. "That was definitely the high point of the
year."
Saturday's match with UCLA was equally
rewarding, as Salzenstein got "pretty sweet"
revenge against Bissell with a 6-4, 6-1 victory.
"He's the best five-man we could ever want,"
Cocotos said. "He can do the job against lesser play
ers, but he can step it up against better players. He's
always there for the team."
Coach Dick Gould been similarly impressed by
Salzenstein. "He doesn't worry about who he's play
ing — he just goes out and plays," he said. "He's
been a real bright spot on our team.
"He is well-schooled fundamentally and he's able
to understand what's going on in a match — what is
working for him and for the other guy."
But the key to Salzenstein's continued success
lies in his revamped serve. Earlier in the season,
opponents exploited Salzenstein's relatively weak
serve, a problem which was exacerbated by an
injured stomach muscle.
"Making that next big step will be determined by
how quickly he adapts to his new serve," Gould said.
"He's a good net player but he has to get up there
first."
Judging from his straight-set wins in singles and
doubles over both Washington and Cal last weekend,
Salzenstein is having little trouble adapting.
"Last weekend I served better than I have all
year," he said. "I'm a lot more confident and I'm
hitting out more ... I just hope I can carry this on
to Georgia (site of the NCAA Tournament)."
