# Valvano's vitality, vigor should be remembered
## 
### 
When metastatic adenocarcinoma
finally got the better of Jim Val
vano last Wednesday, I didn't know
quite what to feel. Looking for anything
that offered a viable perspective, I
for my desk, and, digging into the immense
stack of Sports Illustrateds being saved
there for God-knows-what reason, I found
it.
Nestled on top of the Arthur Ashe
"Sportsman of the Year" cover and
beneath the fabled "Swimsuit Issue," Val
vano's olive-complexioned caricature
smiled thinly against a brown background.
Under the words "High Tide in Alabama"
along with the Jan. 11 dateline, and super
imposed over the message "I'm Fighting to
Live," the weary face hit home. I remem
bered the accompanying story — Gary
Smith's "As Time Runs Out" — as one of
the greatest pieces of writing I had ever
seen, and eagerly awaited a chance to
reread the Valvano story in the wake of his
passing, but I couldn't stop staring at that
cover.
Without even opening the magazine, I
was struck with Valvano's presence and a
sense of loss. While bridging the vast gulf
between Ashley Montana and Ashe — the
"high tide" and the "fight" — Valvano

spoke of courage, of the all-too-fine line
between pleasure and pain, of the best life
has to offer and the worst, and, indeed, of
life and death.
I began to miss Jim Valvano, even
though I never had and never will meet
him. I mean, here, 10 years after a 37-year
old basketball coaching hotshot called
"Jimmy V." led North Carolina State to a
stunning upset , in the NCAA Champi
onship Game — one of the greatest tri
umphs in sports history — Jim Valvano
had run into an opponent with a fatal foul
to give, and could conjure up his magic no
more.
Ten years. It sounds like such a long
time in the short-attention-span world in
which we live, but it is just a fraction of a
person's life. Long enough to bring the

onus of an all-encompassing investigation
against his school and to force Valvano to
resign under pressure, a decade still did not
allow him get situated into life without
coaching, or to become re-acquainted with
the family he had all but abandoned in the
pursuit of his dreams.
It occurred to me that maybe Valvano's
sole purpose in life was to coach, to chauf
feur player-heroes like Lorenzo Charles
and Dereck Whittenburg into our living
rooms for "one shining moment," and
quickly exit the stage. That maybe as Val
vano coached — as he made an indis
putable impact on his players' lives — he
committed all the lofty infractions that
now will, thankfully, never be proven.
That maybe his early death is some sort of
twisted punishment for the way he
attacked life with every ounce of enthusi
asm he could muster, until he had no life to
give.
But what gives with taking away such a
beacon of vitality after just 47 years? I read
Smith's story for clues, and came again to
the place where he describes how Jimmy V.
first discovered his fate in 1992 while on a
golf course in Spain: "And then he felt an
ache in his testicles. That's how death
comes. A pang in the crotch when a man's

standing in the sun gazing across the green
hills and the bluest goddam sea in the
world, deciding between -a three-wood and
an iron." -» . 1 —
I still get tears in my eyes when I read
that passage. National championships, the
sound of sneakers squeaking on a gym
floor, the bands and cheerleaders and hype,
even the alleged rules violations — all that
is good and bad about college basketball
fades away when talking about Jim Val
vano, the man.
As a spokesman for cancer, Valvano's
true colors shone through. At an awards
banquet a month before his death, he joked
with the audience, "You want me to stop?
I've got tumors all over my body, and this
guy is telling me I've got 30 seconds left to
talk."
Throughout his illness, Valvano correct
ly lamented the amount of charity work
and funding devoted to AIDS research, rel
ative to that being directed to the search
for a cure for cancer. Cancer affects more
people and has been around longer, he
claimed, and thus should receive its fair
share of attention.
In the end, attention is what Jim Val-


Andy
Eiser
vano was all about. He wanted us
to stand up and take notice, to
speak out against the millions of
innocent victims of cancer that
don't own NCAA Championship
rings and who have far less people
following their every move. He
wanted us to remember him as
more than just a tumor-ridden
body that was laid to rest some
where in North Carolina last
weekend.
"Cancer has taken my body,"
Valvano once said, "but it will not
take my mind, it will not take my
heart and it will not take my
soul."
If we are careful, we can keep
Jimmy V.'s spirit alive, and work
toward stopping what killed the
rest of him.

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's
melodramatic sports editors, hates
to be the one to cast a shadow on
your "hump day." So cheer up!
