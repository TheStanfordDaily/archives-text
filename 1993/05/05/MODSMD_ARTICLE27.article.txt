## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
While they had been content with sim
ply qualifying for the national champi
onships in each of the last five years, Stan
ford's sailors took control last Friday at the

Pacific Coast Conference Team Racing
Championships and showed its challengers
that the Cardinal commands the Pacific
waters.
Stanford launched to an early lead and
took no stowaways as it cruised past six
other schools to a dominating victory in

Cabrillo Beach, Calif., and earned a berth
in the 16-team national regatta, to be held
June 4 through 6 in Norfolk, Va.
"It's nice to not just win, but to win in
such a convincing fashion after five years of
being second," said coach Blake Middleton
of barely advancing to nationals for the
past half-decade.
The winds were Stanford-friendly from
the beginning and the Cardinal took advan
tage to go undefeated in the first round,
eliminating USC, San Diego State and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo in the process.
With boats manned by senior skipper
John Emory with junior crewmate Kather
ine Chen, the all-sophomore crew of skip
per Charles Meade and crewmate Mary
Kussmaul, and junior skipper Scott Sellers
with senior crewmate Britt Johnson, Stan
ford turned in a performance worthy of a
national contender.
The team maintained its high-level sail
ing and lost only one race in the four-team
final round to finish with a 5-1 record. The
race they lost went to second-place Hawaii
(4-2), who also advanced to nationals. UC-
Irvine finished with a 2-4 record good for
third, while California brought up the rear
with a 1-5 mark.
Having proved themselves masters of
the Pacific, the sailors are optimistic that
they can make a serious run for the nation
al crown.
"If they can bring themselves to the
level that they sailed on Friday and stay at
that level, then they should be able to get
into the top four and even have a good
chance to win nationals," Middleton said.
With the victory, the team racers joined
the Cardinal women's team in national
competition.
The women clinched a berth in their
championship bracket by virtue of a Pacific
Coast win last month.
The Cardinal's hopes for a "triple
crown" in the Pacific were deflated Satur

day and Sunday, however, as the team fin
ished in a disappointing fifth place in the
Pacific Coast Dinghy Fleet Racing Champi
onship, also held in Cabrillo Beach.
Hawaii dominated the competition and
took first place and the fleet-racing crown.
UCI finished second and also advanced to
nationals.

It's nice to not just win, but
to win in such a convincing
fashion after five years of
being second.'
— Blake Middleton

In a close three-way race for third place,
Stanford was outscored by California,
which took third, and host USC, which
took fourth.
"We were seven or so points out of sec
ond when we started, but for the first five
races we came out and just got our clocks
cleaned," Meade said.
Though the team placed well in many
races throughout the weekend, it may have
been inconsistency that caused the team's
eventual demise.
"What you want to do in regattas like
this is high-percentage maneuvers. You
don't want to do things that may give you
first or second in a race, but may also put
you in ninth or tenth," Emory said. "You
always wan,, to do moves that will put you
in third or fourth. That's what Hawaii
was able to do and that's what did it for
them."
Middleton added that although the
defeat on Sunday was disappointing, the
Cardinal is still quite content with having
two out of its three teams remain alive in
the national-championship hunt.
