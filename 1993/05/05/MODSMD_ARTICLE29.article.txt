# Suns hang on, avert Laker sweep, 107-102
## 
### 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) - The
Phoenix Suns went cold in the closing
moments again Tuesday night. But this
time, they survived.
The Suns, the NBA's best team over the
regular season, held off the upstart Los
Angeles Lakers 107-102 last night to stay
alive in their playoff series. Phoenix still
trails 2-1 in the best-of-five series against
the Lakers, the only team in the playoffs
with a sub-.500 record.
The fourth game is tomorrow night at
the Forum, with a fifth, if necessary, in
Phoenix on Sunday.
The Lakers, who had outscored the Suns
18-1 in the closing moments of two upset
victories in Phoenix over the weekend, this
time went cold themselves, getting just two
points after they rallied from 14 points
behind to pull to 101-100 with 1:25 to play.
Oliver Miller, Richard Dumas and Kevin
Johnson each hit a pair of free throws in
the final 46 seconds to finally put the Lak
ers away.
Vlade Divac, who scored a career play
off-high 30 points for the Lakers, missed a

3-pointer that would have tied it with eight
seconds remaining, then Johnson closed
out the scoring with his free throws.
Charles Barkley scored 27 points and
had 11 rebounds for the Suns, who squan
dered most of an 80-66 lead they held with
two minutes to go in the third period.
"Tonight we played with enthusiasm
and emotion like we did all year," Barkley
said. "Now we have to take it game by
game because only our fans in Phoenix and
the 12 guys in this locker room believe we
can win it all."
Suns coach Paul Westphal, who after
losing the first two predicted flatly that his
team would win three in a row, said of yes
terday's game: "It wasn't easy; it wasn't
easy at all."
"I believe this was the Lakers' best
game of the series, but we played a little
better," Westphal said. "I think we got
back to the style we're comfortable with.
We were able to get our running game
going a little bit and I thought that was the
reason we were able to win the game."
Divac, who left the game briefly after a

collision in the third quarter to have five
stitches in his right eyelid, said he wished
he had taken more time with his final shot,
an air ball. He had made two of three from
3-point range before that.
"I felt I was in a groove, and maybe that
made me a little too confident," he said. "I
should have never shot that last shot. It
stunk; I take all the blame. I lost track of
the time and rushed it."
Dumas added 18 points and Johnson 17
for Phoenix.
Elden Campbell had 17 points, and A.C.
Green 14 points and 17 rebounds for the
Lakers.
After scoring just three points in the
opening 4 1/2 minutes of the final quarter,
the Suns let the Lakers pull to 90-89 with 6
1/2 minutes remaining. Los Angeles then
went almost two minutes without scoring,
but closed to 101-100 on consecutive 3-
pointers by Divac and Sedale Threatt, the
latter at 1:25.
The Suns' free throws in the closing
minute finally put the Lakers away.
The Suns, who finished the regular sea

son with an NBA-best record of 62-20, still
face an uphill battle against the Lakers,
who were 39-43 in the regular season and
are the only team in the playoffs with a sub
.soo record. No team in league history has
ever bounced back from a 2-0 playoff deficit
after losing the first two games at home.
The Lakers, on the other hand, are try
ing to become the first eighth-seeded team
to upset a No. 1 seed since the NBA began
its best-of-five format in 1984.
After falling behind by 15 early in the
second quarter, the Lakers chipped away at
the lead and closed the gap to 51-44 by half
time.
Phoenix moved ahead to stay when the
Lakers went scoreless for a five-minute
period that began with two minutes left in
the first quarter. Phoenix, trailing 24-23 at
that point, reeled off a 16-0 run, with
Danny Ainge scoring seven points and
Barkley five as the Suns pulled out front
39-24.
The Lakers won the opening game of the
series 107-103 last Friday, then came back
with an 86-81 win on Sunday.
