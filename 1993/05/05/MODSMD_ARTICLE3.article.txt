RENO, Nev. (AP) — In what has been
hailed by many environmentalists and scien
tists as a landmark study, researchers at Stan
ford and the University of Nevada at Reno will
work together to identify every living thing in
the state of Nevada and throughout the Great
Basin.
The two institutions will jointly operate an
environmental center based in Nevada whose
mission will be to catalogue every fish, plant
and animal in the state.
Dr. Dennis Murphy, who is taking leave
from his directorship of Stanford's Center for
Conservation Biology, will work as co-director
of the new environmental center, alongside Dr.
Peter Brussard, chairman of the biology de
partment at UNR.
"Some feel this is the most important scien
tific project going on in the country today,"
Nevada Sen. Harry Reid said yesterday.

"It's going to set the standards for the fu
ture," he said.
One of the study's key objectives, said Reid,
will be to identify endangered species before
they pose a threat to the state's economic de
velopment.
"The desert tortoise shut down a billion dol
lar construction business in southern Neva
da," said Reid.
With the data expected from the upcoming
study, he said, "No longer will we be forced to
choose between the economy and the environ
ment.
"This will provide the country with a clear
vision of the environmental scheme," he
added.
With about 150 threatened or endangered
species, Nevada ranks fourth in the nation —
behind Florida, California and Hawaii — in the
number of native species that are extinct or

threatened with extinction.
According to Brassard, the project will com
bine not only the joint research efforts but help
from other participants, including the Nation
al Park Service, the Bureau of Land Manage
ment, the U.S. Forest Service and other feder
al, state and local jurisdictions.
"Everybody's reading off the same page,"
said Brassard.
The study's co-directors will be joined by
three senior scientists, five postdoctoral-level
scientists and five graduate assistants.
Reid said he had discussed the initiative
with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and"it
has his full weight and authority."
The Nevada senator said that as a member
of the Appropriations Committee, he would
lead the quest for funding, which is expected to
cost about $2 million a year for the first five
years.
