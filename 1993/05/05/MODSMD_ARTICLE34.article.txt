Computers worth $4,000 stolen
About $4,000 worth of computer equipment
was stolen from an office in the High-Energy
Physics Laboratory Thursday.
Sometime between 5:30 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. the
next morning, thieves made off with a Macintosh
11, a color monitor, a disk drive and a keyboard,
according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
None of the equipment was locked down or
protected by any kind of security devices, he said.
There were no visible signs of a break-in at the
laboratory office, according to Niemeyer, and
there are currently no suspects in the theft.
"Being a lab, the door was probably left open," he
said. At first, it was thought that a student or facul
ty member had borrowed or moved the computer.
So far this year there have been 16 computer
thefts, said Niemeyer. Most of the computers
stolen were not locked down, he said.
"In previous years Stanford would have 50, 60,
70 thefts (each year) costing the university as
much as $250,000," he explained. "But better
precautions and security devices limited comput

er thefts to only 24 in '92."

Summer honors program offered
A summer "Residential Honors College" will
be launched this year for selected students in the
School of Humanities and Sciences who want to
get a head start on their honors theses.
About 20 students majoring in history,
human biology, mathematics and philosophy
wijl be able to enroll in the Honors College,
which will be held for a two-or-three week term
before fall quarter. Students will live in a single
residence and be advised by a graduate student
with experience in the Writing Across the Cur
riculum program.
The Residential Honors College is one of two
new pilot summer research programs initiated by
the ongoing "Teaching Initiative" in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Summer research fellowships in natural sci
ences will be available for students in physics,
chemistry and biology.
