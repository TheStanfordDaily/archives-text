# Separate special-fee rules for grads OK'd
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Precipitated by the defeat of graduate
student sponsored special-fee requests, divi
siveness between graduates and undergrad
uates has been mounting since last month's
election. But last night, the ASSU Senate
tried to resolve the question of who should
pay for what by approving a reform of the
fee-approval process.
The constitutional amendment, which
passed unanimously, would essentially
allow undergraduates and graduate stu
dents to decide separately whether to fund
special fees.
In addition, the senate passed the ASSU's
1993-94 operating budget, which eliminated
salaries for the Council of Presidents and
sharply cut compensation for the senate
chair. The senate also approved the Publica
tions Board's proposal to spend a total of

$16,500 to replace failing computer equip
ment and software in the student publica
tions office.
The senate's amendment on special fees
will be placed on the ballot in next spring's
general election. If approved by the student
body, the electorate will be divided in future
elections, with undergraduate and graduate
student votes for special fees tabulated sepa
rately.
"If the undergraduates say yes and the
graduates say no, then the undergraduates
foot the bill — all of it," explained graduate
senator Sanford Dickert.
If both groups accept a special fee, they
will split the cost — just as they do in the pre
sent system, he added. Currently, special
fees are divided among the entire student
body.
"As it stands, 90 percent of graduate stu-
dents don't know what these spe
cial fees groups do," graduate sen
ator Jerry Yang said. "They feel
that they shouldn't have to pay for
groups that do not affect them."
Graduate senators expressed
optimism that the amendment
would encourage student groups
to reach out to more graduate stu
dents. U I think that this is a fair
solution," graduate senator Kevin
Murdock said.
Dickert agreed, saying, "With
the exception of the Stanford Solar
Car Project and MEChA, I did not
see one organization reach out sig
nificantly to graduate students
this year."
The move to change the special
fee voting system was sparked by
the failure of the Graduate Stu
dent Association's fee request in
this year's election.
"The reality is that twice the
number of undergraduates vote as
graduates," Murdock said. "With
two-thirds of the voters voting no,
there is no way that a graduate
organization gets funded."
The senate also approved next

year's operating budget, which
totaled $287,591 — an increase of
5.5 percent from last year. Last
year, the budget had been cut by
17.6 percent.
Salaries for the Council of Pres
idents were not included in the
budget, following the request of
the victorious "Clean Slate" in
April's election.
The senate chair and deputy
senate chair will also take pay cuts
next year. The chair will receive
$500 and the deputy chair will be
given no compensation. Last year,
the two positions paid $3,000 and
$1,500, respectively.
The budget and finance com
mittee had initially proposed elim
inating the salaries of both posi
tions, which some senators strong
ly supported.
"I've attended every meeting and
nobody has given me money," grad
uate senator Brad Adelberg said.
Graduate senator James Vera
agreed. "The senate chair's posi
tion has enough prestige that it
may be valuable in later life I
don't think we will have problems
filling the position without a
salary," he said.
The ASSU anticipates a balanced
budget next year even though the
University has cut its subsidy from

$90,000 this year to $20,000.
"I think that should be our
main concern," said Yang. "It's
important that we don't have a
negative balance on the budget."
The senate also approved the
Publications Board's proposal to
spend $14,000 on new computer
equipment and $2,500 on software
for the student publications office.
The board supports such publica
tions as Release, the Stanford
Review and New Speak.
Senior Tammie Edwards, the
board's chairwoman, pointed out
that the proposal would signifi
cantly upgrade the capabilities of
campus publications.
Although financial manager
Christine Vargas noted that the
board spent $11,000 on computer
upgrades less than two years ago,
most senators agreed that the
money, which will be taken from
the board's reserve fund, would be
well spent.
"This is a real model for the
way bills should have gone this
year," said graduate senator Ralph
Ermoian. "We were in contact
with [the board] every step of the
process."
The senate made only minor
modifications to the amount of
software purchased.
