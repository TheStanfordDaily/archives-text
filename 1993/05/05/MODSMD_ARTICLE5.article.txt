## Top earners in Med School, land management 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper's
$250,000 salary this year is on par with the
compensation of presidents at other major
research universities, according to a survey
published in this week's Chronicle of High
er Education.
During the 1991-92 school year, the lat
est year for which figures were published,
Benno Schmidt, the former president of
Yale, earned $289,500, while Princeton
president Harold Shapiro pocketed
$257,500.
Casper also receives benefits — includ
ing health insurance and payments into a
pension plan — worth about 30 percent of
his salary, according to a University offi
cial.
The survey, which revealed the salaries

of top officials at 190 colleges nationwide,
also reported that Surgery Prof. John
Niederhuber received salary and benefits of
$1.29 million in 1991-92, a figure disputed
by University and Medical Center officials.
Don Gibbons, a Medical Center
spokesman, said Niederhuber's actual
salary was only $400,000. He also earned
$114,000 in benefits and received a housing
allowance of $25,000, according to Gib
bons.
The balance of the $1.29 million reflects
one-time relocation costs, said David
Mendelow, the School of Medicine's associ
ate vice president for administration.
Niederhuber worked at Johns Hopkins
University before Stanford hired him in
1991.
"Relocation costs basically include mov-
ing [him], his family and his labo
ratory out to Stanford, plus, in
[Niederhuber's] case, there were
some interim housing costs [as
well]," Mendelow said.
Mendelow added that Stanford
also compensates for the fact that
reimbursement for such expenses
is taxed like regular income.
Other high salaries reported in
the survey include Medical School
professors Norman Shumway
($480,815) and Edward Stinson
($443,743).
"At an academic medical cen
ter, the salaries are high," said
Peter Van Etten, the University's

chief financial officer. "But still
[they are] significantly less than
what one would earn in private
practice."
The high salaries are "related
to the amount of money that [the
doctors] bill and is in almost all
cases significantly less than the
actual charges which they gener
ate," Van Etten added.
"I doubt that [onej would find
much difference at any other
large medical school in the coun
try," said Mendelow.
The survey also singled out
Laurence Hoagland, the president
of the Stanford Management
Company, as the highest paid
non-medical university employee
in the country. He earned
$662,280 in salary and benefits
last year.

Van Etten explained that the
management company's board of
directors sets the salary.
The management company
was created three years ago as a
separate entity to manage the
University's real estate and
investment activities. These
include the Stanford Shopping
Center and the University's $2.2
billion endowment, Van Etten
said.
"The belief was that it was in
the best interest of the Universi
ty to hire professional manage
ment to run" these investments,
Van Etten said. He noted that
several other universities have
similar arrangements and that
the company's costs are paid by
endowment and real estate rev
enues.
