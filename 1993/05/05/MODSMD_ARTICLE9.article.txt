Tax proposal targets seniors
WASHINGTON (AP) - Millions of
the nation's wealthiest senior citizens
would pay an average of $1,000 more a
year under President Clinton's plan to
cut the deficit by raising taxes on Social
Security benefits, federal officials told
Congress yesterday.
In all, about 9 million middle- and
upper-income seniors would see their tax
bills rise, but for many the increase
would be relatively small.
The proposal targets seniors with
annual incomes of at least $25,000 for
individuals and $32,000 for married cou
ples. The maximum portion of their
Social Security benefits subject to
income taxes would be increased from 50
percent to 85 percent.
On average, the tax on benefits would

increase from $720 a year to about $1,270,
said Social Security Commissioner Louis
EnofT. That would raise $1.7 billion in 1994
and $23.3 billion over five years, EnofT said.
Growth indicator slides
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment's chief economic forecasting gauge
recorded its worst drop during March in
more than two years, signaling lethargic
growth this year.
The Index of Leading Indicators fell 1
percent, the sharpest decline since Novem
ber 1990, in the middle of the recession, the
Commerce Department said yesterday.
At the White House, President Clin
ton used the report to prod Congress to
enact his proposed budget-deficit cuts,
which he said would stimulate the econo
my by keeping interest rates low.
