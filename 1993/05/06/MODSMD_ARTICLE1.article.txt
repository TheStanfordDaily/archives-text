# Betas regain house at 557 Mayfield

After a year as an unhoused fraternity,
Beta Theta Pi has snapped up enough new
pledges to resume residence at 557 Mayfield
next fall.
The Betas needed a total of 34 members to
regain their house, but gained only five new
members through the formal rush process
and fell short of that number. However, after
the Row housing office gave them another
week, they accumulated the proper number
and then some through the distribution of
"snap bids."
"We have an overabundance of pledges, so

we're in great shape," said Beta President
Sloan Johnson. "I feel vindicated. It's unbe
lievable how great this is."
Johnson, a sophomore who rushed last
year, joined the Betas fully intending to live in
a fraternity house. "I knew we would get our
house back," he said. "I'm just glad it hap
pened so soon."
Johnson attributed the successful Rush to
a different attitude. "I see this as an indica
tion that people are tired of the old routine,"
he said. "I think people are ready to try some
thing new here."
Row director Diana Conklin said she was
amazed at the success of the Betas in gather
ing members. "Not only did they get the prop

er amount, but they went over that," she said.
"There's no question they will get their house
back now."
While the exact number of pledges has not
yet been tabulated, Johnson said it is certain
that they have more than the necessary 34
total members.
Jim Gombas, also a member of the frater
nity, said a few men are still wavering in their
decision to join. "That will not have an affect
on our housing status, however," he said,
"due to the incredible abundance of men who
have joined."
The reinvigorated fraternity will return to
spruced-up quarters, because
their house will be receiving a
face-lift this summer as part of
the 10-year capital improve
ments campaign which will also
renovate Wilbur Hall.
Among the renovations, the
Beta house will be receiving new
paint inside and out, new plumb
ing and a new balcony.
"The first thing I'm going to
do in the new house is go out on
the balcony," Johnson said.
