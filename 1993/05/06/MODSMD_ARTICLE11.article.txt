Tamils flee in fear
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) â€” Thousands
of Tamils fled the capital yesterday, fearing
violence during the state funeral today for Sri
Lanka's assassinated president.
Police have accused Tamil rebels, who have
been fighting for independence in northern Sri
Lanka for 10 years, of training the suicide
bomber who attacked President Ramasinghe Pre
madasa.
Premadasa was a member of the country's
Sinhalese majority, and many of its people hate
the Tamil rebels. That could cause riots today
when the funeral procession passes through
Tamil areas of the city.
Three thousand soldiers and 8,000 policemen
have been deployed in the city for the funeral.
He will be cremated inside a 20-foot-tall wooden
pyre in central Independence Square.
