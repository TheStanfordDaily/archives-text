# Serbs' parliament rejects U.N. peace plan

MOUNT JAHORINA, Bosnia-
Herzegovina (AP) — The Bosnian
Serbs' self-proclaimed parliament
effectively rejected a U.N. peace plan
to end the war in Bosnia early this
morning by voting instead for a refer
endum on the plan.
The vote defied pressure from the
Serbs' backers in Yugoslavia and
abroad, and heightened prospects of
military intervention to end Europe's
bloodiest conflict since World War 11.
The parliament's deputies voted
51-2 for a May 15-16 referendum by
Bosnian Serbs on the peace plan.
Twelve deputies abstained and 10
deputies present earlier in the day left
before the vote.
After the vote, the president of
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, Dobrica
Cosic said, "The (Bosnian) parliament
took the worst decision, and I don't
know what the next night will bring."

Cosic and the leaders of
Yugoslavia's two republics, Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and Mon
tenegran leader Momir Bulatovic,
angrily left the meeting after the vote.
In New York, Bosnia's U.N. mis
sion slammed the decision.
"It's pretty damn clear that the
Serbs have no intention of following any
directive from the West," said Miles
Ragusz, a Bosnian spokesman.
U.N. mediator Cyrus Vance, who
co-authored the peace plan, told PBS
television that the ball was now in the
Security Council's court. The council
had already scheduled consulations on
Bosnia on this morning. White House
officials had no immediate comment.
The vote past midnight came after
days of furious diplomatic efforts to
get the Bosnian Serbs to accept the
plan, already approved by Bosnia's
Muslims and Croats.

At the meeting, leaders from
Greece and Yugoslavia joined Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in
pleading with the lawmakers to accept
the plan to avert military intervention.
Karadzic, who accepted the plan
Sunday at a peace conference in
Greece, said, "Either we accept this
plan, or we can expect fierce attacks by
NATO forces."
President Clinton has called for
military measures, including air
strikes against Serb artillery, if the
Serbs back away from a settlement.
European allies and Russia have
not directly endorsed his calls, howev
er, despite overtures this week by Sec
retary of State Warren Christopher.
As Karadzic spoke, armed Serb
militiamen in camouflage milled about
the "Heavenly Valley" hotel where the
parliament was meeting, 20 miles
southeast of Sarajevo.

Despite such pressure, a hard-line
mood prevailed. Many deputies feel that
they would be giving up hard-fought
gains if they accept the peace plan.
The plan gives the Serbs 43 per
cent of Bosnia in three non-contiguous
provinces, but denies them land links
to Serbia and Serb-held areas of Croa
tia. The Serbs have captured 70 per
cent of Bosnia since the war began.
Hoping that the Serb assembly
would accept the plan, NATO had
been preparing plans to send up to
75,000 peacekeepers to Bosnia to
enforce a cease-fire.
Premier Constantine Mitsotakis
of Greece, Serbia's only Western
friend in the past two years, said,
"Don't commit suicide."
"At this moment you have two
roads: one is a confrontation with the
whole world and the other is peace,"
Mitsotakis said.
