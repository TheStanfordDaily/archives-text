## Streamlined elections 
### 
VOTING IN THE elections is
like standing in a Russian
bread line — a cumbersome
process with little reward.
But relief may be in sight.
A proposal, introduced at last
week's ASSU Senate meeting,
would radically streamline the
annual elections process by allow
ing students to vote at their
leisure at any computer on the
University network.
Instead of queuing up for what
often seems like eternity, students
could now vote at any dorm and
University cluster anjiime during
the two-day election. And for stu
dents with in-room connections,
casting their ballot would require
hardly any effort.
By removing complicated open
ing and closing times at polling
sites, the on-line system would
allow graduate students — who
have been concerned about being

disenfranchised from the election
— to more actively participate in
the process.
The new system would be a
good way to reverse a trend of
decreasing voter turnout. This
year, for example, participation
declined 5.9 percent from last year.
In addition to providing a sim
plified process, the system could
save the ASSU $6,500 a year after
a one-time start-up cost of $6,000.
The system would eliminate the
need for pollwatchers and many
other election-related expenses.
In light of the ASSU's funding
cutbacks from the University, such
streamlining would be a sensible
way to cut future costs.
The bill has yet to come up for a
vote, and although numerous pro
cedural details undoubtedly have
to be ironed out, the senate should
act to have this new system in
place for next year's election.
