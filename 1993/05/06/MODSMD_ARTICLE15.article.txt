# A 						meager service plan

### 
EVEN THE BEST intentions
sometimes run afoul. After
100 days in office, President
Clinton should know this more
than anybody else in Washington.
The defeat of both his jobs bill and
the plan to allow gays and lesbians
to serve in the military are sting
ing reminders of how campaign
promises usually never turn into
viable policy.
This conundrum was seen again
when Clinton unveiled his nation
al service proposal last week; it was
an attenuated version of his origi
nal plan and a far cry from what
students really need.
Bowing to last-minute pressure
from the Pentagon, the adminis
tration reduced the funding stu
dents participating in the program
would receive. The originally pro
posed $7,500 a year was trimmed
down to $5,000 per year, after mil
itary officials expressed fear that
the public service program would
compete with military scholarship

programs.
By paying students only $5,000
for each of two years of service,
many graduates may opt instead to
work in the private sector, under
mining Clinton's efforts to bring
more students into public service.
Participants will be paid a flat
rate, minimum-wage stipend of
$4.25 an hour — not much of an
incentive for graduates. In addi
tion, the universal wage does not
recognize cost-of-living differences
in various parts of the country.
Before the final plan is submit
ted to Congress, Clinton should
reduce the number of openings for
the program and raise the incen
tives. By paying fewer students
more, better-qualified graduates
would be encouraged to participate.
If Clinton is looking to foster
true changes in American atti
tudes toward national service, a
small program with some of the
nation's best students would be
better for all parties involved.
