## A 						closet conservative ?!? 
### 
££ TDON'T BELIEVE THAT anyone
I should label themselves as right-
JLists, leftists, or middleists. Just
be whatever you are and don't let anyone
else put labels on you and don't put labels
on yourself." — Malcolm X
I am in complete accordance with this
idea of the late Malcolm X. However, our
friends over at the Stanford Review have
hailed me as a closet conservative and
have challenged me to come out of the
closet.
Well, I am not much of a political-sci
ence student, but it would seem to me
that a conservative is one who conserves
something . .. like perhaps the status
quo!?! The status quo is destroying peo
ples lives, destroying the planet and car
rying out a program of genocidal propor
tions against black people on the local
and global level. Being a conscious black
person who understands what the status
quo represents to me, our generation and
to our children of the future, I am the last
person who would be trying to conserve
any of this.
And since we're on the topic of the
Review and labels, I have to say I am
tired of this ridiculous debate about
"minority self-segregation." Lisa Koven
and Samantha Martinez-Colson wrote a
piece in the Review this week in which
they boldly asserted that "IMinority
organizations] promote reverse racism."
To me a statement like this comes more

out of arrogance than ignorance. It is this
typical, whitewashed perception of reali
ty that says if any non-white group does
anything, they don't want to be with
white people. Are the Native Americans
who were quarantined by the U.S. gov
ernment on reservations and who are
suffering from unemployment and alco
holism self-segregationists? Are blacks
and Latinos in the inner cities, who are
suffering disproportionately from sys
temic joblessness, self-segregationists
because no whites live in their neighbor
hoods?
Koven and Martinez-Colson start
their piece by saying that "segregation
became passe, as well as illegal during
the 1950'5." Passe!?! Do they honestly
believe that a country whose social,
political and economic system has been
based on a racialized caste system for
400 years can somehow miraculously
change its mind with Brown vs. Board of
Education in 1954? You would think
that an American Studies and political
science mtyor would have a little better
grip on reality.
Crying about reverse racism, reverse
discrimination and self-segregation is a
typical, oversimplified view of reality. It
is a view that believes white (and opti
mally middle class) values and norms
are universal. In this view, a white per
son is absolved of all responsibility to
affect change simply because he/she is

not in the Ku Klux Klan and therefore
all the responsibility lies with the non
whites to assimilate into this "wonder
ful" land of the free and home of the
brave.
Now when I say a typical white way of
viewing the world, I am not saying it's a
perception that all whites have or one
that is a result of being Caucasian. I am
talking about a mainstream socialized
consciousness that leads many removed
whites to honestly believe that since slav
ery was abolished, things have gotten
better. It is a mentality that can not be
critical of itself or ask, "What am I doing
to contribute to this problem and what
can I start doing to make a difference and
make change?"
It is time to stop quibbling about polit
ical party lines and throwing around all
these "miracle cure" words like multicul
turalism, transculturalism and cultural
diversity. I would be happy to present any
of my ideas to anyone or any group that is
tired of what is going on and, more
importantly, is tired of inaction. Give me
a call and let's get started on some con
structive plans of action.
