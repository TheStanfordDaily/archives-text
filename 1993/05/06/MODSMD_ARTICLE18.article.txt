Stanford is hypocritically intolerant of smokers

Did YOU EVER HAVE TO sit next
to a really fat person on an air
plane? Get pissed because the land
mass to your right during the midterm
required all of the center arm rest, and
maybe some of your space too, just to fit
in a seat? Or watch an obese heart -
attack-waiting-to-happen load up on
donuts at Tresidder? How do you react
to these situations, and how do you react
to me asking these questions? I hope
you're finally upset, because I sure as
hell am. I smoke, and many of you just
can't deal with that.
I can't count the number of times
someone has insulted me because I
smelled like smoke, or made conspicuous
coughing sounds from a distance when
they saw a cigarette in my hands. I was
once told I would be "very attractive" if I
didn't smoke like a chimney. My person
al favorite was being asked (by a total
stranger standing across the street from
me) whether I was to hoping to get lung
cancer soon — at the same time that my
father was dying of lung cancer (and no,

he didn't smoke). All of this happened at
Stanford.
Do these reactions seem valid to you?
Would you ask a fat person not to sit
next to you because you don't want their
flabby arms intruding on your space?
Heckle them from across the street,
maybe ask when their next bypass was
scheduled for? Tell them how sexy they
would be if they weren't a pig? Seems to
me that would make you pretty unpopu
lar, especially at our oh-so-tolerant-and
sensitive university.
If you have a genetic disposition
which leads you to be overweight, or
addicted to alcohol or drugs, Stanford
labels that a "disease," and you're
offered sympathy and support services.
But if you're addictive personality turns
to cigarettes, you don't receive much
besides insults. I don't agree with blam
ing personal problems on genetics, but I
would at least like to see some consisten
cy from the general student population.
I don't criticize reasonable efforts to
protect the rights and comforts of non

smokers, but I am dismayed at the cal
lousness of many non-smokers on cam
pus who feel that it is acceptable to
attack smokers even when they are not
imposing on others' rights. So you think
smoking is disgusting? Well, I'm disgust
ed too, but not by the sight of someone
holding a cigarette. I'm disgusted by the
self-righteousness and hypocrisy of a
school full of sensitive, liberal people
(ha!) who have decided that any time a
smoker is targeted for an insult, it's OK.
What this community lacks in health
problems, it more than makes up for in
cruelty.
Smokers are already forced to huddle
outside many times a day, feeling like
some kind of leper colony, unless they
are fortunate enough to have roommates
who don't mind smoke. I am, of course,
ignoring those drinking situations where
the person with a pack of cigarettes is
suddenly everybody's best friend. Now,
the University may decree that students
can't smoke in their own rooms. Fur
ther, tobacco products won't be sold at

Tresidder. Theoretically, a strong breeze
could carry second-hand smoke into the
dorm hallways, causing the untimely
death of many residents. But the propos
al to refuse to have tobacco products
sold on campus doesn't offer even the
illusion of being enacted for the health
of "innocents." Banning tobacco sales is
a direct statement: we don't think you
should smoke or chew, so we'll do every
thing in our power to stop you. When
the University bans driving, because it
causes pollution, and the sale of fat-filled
foods in Tresidder, because they're just
plain unhealthy, and alcohol at the Cof
fee House, because it will destroy your
kidneys, and the students readily agree
that these are all decisions that Stanford
should make for them, then the tobacco
ban will make sense. Personally, I don't
see this paternalistic, sanctimonious
attitude as being very appropriate treat
ment for individuals who are viewed as
adults when tuition bills are due.
