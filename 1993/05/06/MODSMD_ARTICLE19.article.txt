# Article on Arbor Clinic contains inaccuracies
## 
### 
Thank you for covering the Arbor
Free Clinic in the April 7 issue. The clin
ic is an institution founded, organized
and run by Stanford University medical
students to serve the surrounding com
munity. We feel that Arbor needs public
ity both to spread awareness of the ser
vices we provide as well as stimulate
donations on which we depend.
Though we truly appreciated The
Daily's attempt to spark interest in Arbor,
the Steering Committee wanted to clarify
some inaccuracies. As a true health-care
facility, Arbor maintains a high degree of
professionalism in providing medical care.
Serving the health-care needs of the
underserved is a serious business that is

carefully planned and implemented at a
high level. As such, the Stanford medical
students who work each Sunday dress in
professional attire as they would in any
hospital, clinic or office. The people your
reporter observed "clad in jeans" were the
undergraduate volunteers.
Several vignettes contained errors in
interpretation and perspective. Though
a medical student did exit the clinic to
see a child, he "rushed out to the car"
not to "diagnose and treat her there,"
but merely to prevent the child from
infecting other patients inside. The med
ical student acted not in haste or eager
ness but in careful consideration of the
medical problems at hand. A later anec
dote quoted an undergraduate volunteer
recounting a suggestion to a patient that
a leg "might have to be amputated." Not
only is this out of context and incorrect,
it portrays the patient as receiving sub

standard medical advice. The faculty
members who work at Arbor are excel
lent physicians who donate time and
effort to serve the community. All deci
sions and diagnoses are made with the
best medical knowledge available.
Other errors in the article are factu
ally based. Our patient population, a
significant percentage of which is home
less, comes largely from Palo Alto, not
East Palo Alto and Redwood City as
stated. The vast majority of the supplies
used are purchased by Arbor, not donat
ed. Arbor is not "understaffed," though
our hours are dictated by a limited
number of volunteer physicians. The
clinic's funding sources include the
Peninsula Community Foundation
among many others (the ASSU, Stan
ford Medical Students Association, the
Haas Foundation and more). In addi
tion, the names of Brad Rabin, Sidney

Morss and Elsa Aguiniga were incor
rectly spelled.
These errors could have easily been
corrected by speaking to any of the eight
medical students present, one of the two
medical student clinic coordinators on
duty, any of the members of the Arbor
Steering Committee or Wendy Todaro,
the manager of Arbor. Rather than seek
a majority of quotes and information
from undergraduate volunteers, your
reporter should have asked medical stu
dents about medical diagnoses, deci
sions, procedures and policies, for we
better understand the workings of the
clinic. Adding a little drama and excite
ment is an understandable tool for a
reporter, but should not be employed at
the expense of an accurate portrayal.
