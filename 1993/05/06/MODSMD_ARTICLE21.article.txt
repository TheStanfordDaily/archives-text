## Willens brings legacy into final championship drive 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Whatever you do, don't mention the family.
Senior women's tennis team captain Heather Wil
lens does just fine on her own, thank you very much.
Forget the fact that grandfather Frankie Albert quar
terbacked Stanford football to victory way back when,
or that mom Jane Albert was a top tennis figure of her
own. This woman has done it all herself.
"I've gotten so used to being compared with them,"
Willens admits. "It's frustrating once in while, but I'm

actually pretty proud to be associated with them."
Willens needed no family help to establish her rep
utation on the tennis court, however. She is known
as a feisty ball-getter who wins more with pure deter
mination than overpowering swings. In a collegiate
field packed with big serves and bigger returns, Wil
lens possesses neither, relying on foot speed and com
petitive drive to overcome opponents.
How good does that make her? How about a Rolex
Indoors Singles Championship, a ranking of No. 1 or
No. 2 over the past two years and a current No. 4
national ranking? Regardless of her opponent, Wil

lens seems to find a way to win.
"I've been really happy with my game lately, not
because I've been playing good, but because I'm loose,"
Willens said. "I'm able to relax and hit out more."
The rest of the NCAA would hate to see her when
she is playing well.
Willens was always pushed toward athletics by her
mother and grandfather, who Willens says "kind of
expected" that she pick up some kind of sport. What
they might not have expected was that she would
pick it up at age seven.
"It was so natural — everyone in my family plays
some kind of sport," Willens said. "I was always
interested in playing, so I just picked up a racket and
really liked it."
By 11, Heather was following firmly in mom's foot
steps. That was the year of her first junior-national
tournament, a competition in which she participated
every year after that. By the time Willens reached high
school, she hardly had time to play No. 1 singles and
doubles for her high-school team.
"I think I played seven matches my senior year,"
Willens said. "I was so busy with juniors stuff that I
wouldn't be at practice much."
Willens had her eye set on Stanford even in those
early days, she says, but her first year on Stanford's
highly touted women's team was a bit of a wake-up
call from her juniors play.
"All my family and friends went to Stanford, so I
pretty much always knew I would be coming here,"
Willens said. "When I got here, it was kind of a shock,
playing No. 6 singles on what Frank [Brennan] con
siders the greatest women's tennis team ever."
That 1990 NCAA championship team boasted pro
player Teri Whitlinger at No. 1, and a solid singles
contingent that Willens says "would never lose." Wil
lens used that experience to forge her competitive
attitude for the rest of her stay at Stanford.
"I put myself in my niche on that team," Willens
said. "I said to myself, 'OK, I'm No. 6, just go out
there and win your matches.' What I learned the
most is that there's a fine line between you and most
of the other players."
This year, that experience has paid off for Willens.
She is ranked No. 4 in the country, but plays No. 2
singles behind teammate Laxmi Poruri, a position
she says is fme with her.
"I was just worn out from the pressure of being
No. 1," Willens said. "It was always very close

between Laxmi and I, but it took me about a week at
No. 2 to see how much better it was for me. I feel bet
ter in the underdog role."
That leaves Willens with nothing but support —
and sympathy — for Poruri. "You never have an easy
match at one, and I totally know how that feels," Wil
lens said. "But we're very close — the team counts on
her, and we fire each other up. We kind of feel naked
without each other."
Which means Willens has probably found it a bit
drafty lately. Poruri's elbow has kept her out of some of
the end-of-season matches, leaving Willens to pick up
the slack and take over the leadership role. That, how
ever, is an old familiar place for her, as she demonstrat
ed in adverse conditions at UCLA this year, defeating
the Bruins' Keri Phebus and a rowdy home crowd.
"UCLA was my biggest win in four years here,"
Willens said. "The situation with the fans there was
unbelievable — they were yelling on my double
faults, calling me fat, even yelling on the
changeovers. I've never seen anything like that in my
four years."
According to Willens, this year's team isn't the
"dream team" of 1990, but it's a lot more fun to play on.
"On the first year's team, the reason we worked
so well was because no one would lose — there was
no pressure to win your match," she said. "Not this
year — we can't always get a win, but we can pull
each other through when we need to."
The future holds some hard work for Willens, most
of it geared toward winning the NCAA title next week
in Florida. But she's also looking forward to a higher
goal.
"I never thought I'd say this, but, yes, I am going
to go pro," Willens confessed. "It really never
entered my mind until I moved up in the rankings —
plus I feel like I'm not ready for a real job."
Like the rest of us.
Nevertheless, Willens will content herself with
the task before her, and that is to come home from
the Sunshine State with a NCAA trophy.
"We're going to have to have everybody completely
focus on their individual match — it takes six to win,"
Willens said. "We can't wait to get to Florida and the
crowd there — we're confident we can win this time."
And what then for this graduating senior?
"I plan on doing all the things I haven't done here,"
says Willens. "Maybe I can be a normal Stanford student."
Don't bet on it.

Heather Willens smiles when looking back — and down — on her illustrious Stanford career. As the only
senior on this year's Cardinal squad, she hopes to lead the women's tennis team to yet another NCAA crown.
