# Can't we get along?

DON'T GET ME wrong. I like
a good fight like anyone else.
I thought it would be a good
idea to let Gerhard Casper and Don
Kennedy wrestle for the presiden
cy, winner take all. And I know I
wasn't the only one hoping Patricia
Ireland would whip out the Ever
last boxing gloves and go 15 with
Phyllis Schlafly to settle this debate
thing once and for all.
But it seems that fights are hap
pening with greater frequency and
intensity in the world of athletics,
and the results should be troubling

to all true lovers of sport. Take a
gander at some of the lowlights of
the current academic year:
• Stanford's glorious 41-21
thrashing of the Weenies in the
1992 Big Game is marred by a
postgame riot on the field, involv
ing some of the "smartest" stu
dents in the country throwing
paint, fruit and Jell-0 pudding at
each other.
• The New York Knicks and
Phoenix Suns erupt in a full-court
melee after the Knicks' Greg
Anthony comes off the bench to
sucker punch an unsuspecting
Kevin Johnson.
• On April 28, Dale Hunter
body-checks a celebrating Pierre
Turgeon after he put the Islanders
up 5-1 over the Capitals. Turgeon
leaves with a season-ending sepa
rated shoulder, and Hunter is
"punished" with a 21-game sus
pension.
•In the most recent incident,
New York Knicks forward John
Starks gets into a trash-talking
match with Indiana's Reggie
Miller, resulting in Starks' head
butting Miller and being ejected
from the game, to the disgust of his
own coach and teammates.
Can you say "unsportsmanlike
conduct?"
Athletics is being ravaged by a
rash of these sorts of violent inci
dents, not to mention countless
other cases of after-the-play jawing,
showboating and cheap shots. The
effect of this extracurricular action
is not only distracting the fans and
players from the game, it under
mines the fundamental purpose of
sports.
I can understand when players
get caught up in the emotion of the
game and feel like they have to do
something — anything — to take
the other team down. It's foolish to
think that professional sports these
days involve anything less than the
most intense, sometimes bitter,
confrontations between teams. But

when players and coaches start to
take matters into their own hands,
by resorting to personal confronta
tions and violence, the game ceases
to be a game.
Too often, the praise the media
and fans shower on our sports
heroes translates into a "warrior
mentality," a feeling that these
men are not just paid athletic com
petitors, they are soldiers, march
ing into war with fierce adversaries
to win fame, fortune and gloiy for
the city of Charlotte, New York or
whatever other metropolis cheers
them on. Offenses like those com
mitted by Hunter and Starks are
nothing more than desperate and
childish acts born out of the frus
tration of failing in competition —
of losing in battle.
Guys like Charles Barkley, Reg
gie White and Shaquille O'Neal
make a fortune on the idea that
they're mean, eat-nails-for-break
fast kind of players who would just
as soon put you in the hospital as
put in a winning performance.
More and more, however, players
are acting on that idea, and it's
quickly turning the sports world —
professional and otherwise — into
a big bar-room brawl.
Perhaps that's why it's impor
tant for players like Patrick Ewir.g
to express their outrage at that
kind of behavior right there on the
court. I felt like getting up and
applauding when Ewing shoved
Starks to the bench with a angry
look in his eye. Message: Take that
crap out of here, punk.
This is not to mention the fact
that many of these "warriors" we
see on the TV screen are real-life
sons, brothers, husbands and
fathers. Watching Dad blindside an
unsuspecting opponent is hardly
the kind of role-model experience a
seven or eight-year-old kid needs.
Sportsmen, however, are in
rarer supply. We can probably
learn a lot from watching the
sports women of this nation, of
which there seem to be plenty.
Women's competitive spirit is every
bit as healthy as men's, but there is
also a great deal of respect for oppo
nents no matter what the sport.
What's more, I've never seen a sin
gle fight break out at a women's
sporting event.
That is, if you don't count pro
fessional wrestling.
I get my violence fix paying
$34.95 to watch 650-pound, 72-
year-old George Foreman get beat
up on by a new guy every week. At
least those guys shake hands after
they fight. As far as I'm concerned,
sportsmanship belongs in every
sporting event, and violence
belongs only in the ring.
Wanna make something of it?

Mike McDonough is currently
serving a two-week suspension
from the Los Angeles Lakers after
having called Charles Barkley a
"wiener." He still predicts the
unbelievable 3-1 series win is com
ing tonight.
