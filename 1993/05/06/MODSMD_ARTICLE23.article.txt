Football
The Stanford football team showed some
punch as it concluded its four-week spring
practice season with the Cardinal-White
scrimmage last Saturday at Stanford Stadi
um. Highlights included two touchdown
throws by junior quarterback Steve Sten
strom and two scores on the ground by
senior running back Ellery Roberts.
Stenstrom, a two-time All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection, completed 10-of-13 passes
on the day for 185 yards, including scoring
plays to David Shaw (31 yards) and Ethan
Allen (29). Roberts carried seven times for 58
yards, and hit paydirt on runs of one and 30
yards.
Sophomore placekicker Eric Abrams
added to the offensive fireworks, connecting
on four-of-five field goal attempts from
between 25 and 42 yards out.
The Cardinal begins its 1993 regular sea

son Sept. 4 in Seattle when it takes on the
three-time defending Pac-10 champion
Washington Huskies.
Men's basketball
The Cardinal men's basketball team made
a move to fill the void left by three graduat
ing backcourt players, signing junior-college
transfer Frank Harris to a letter of intent.
Harris, a 6-foot-3, 170-pound left-handed
point guard, averaged 21 points and 7.3
assists a game in leading Connors State
Junior College in Warner, Okla., to a confer
ence title last season. He will enter Stanford
as a junior next fall and plans to major in
communication and political science.
Women's swimming
The two-time defending NCAA champion
Cardinal women's swim team took steps to
keep its dynasty intact, signing two top high

school prospects — Sarah Anderson of San
Ramon, Calif., and Michelle Jesperson of
Madison, Wis. — to letters of intent. Ander
son and Jesperson join Kerry O'Hanlon of
Richmond, Va., who signed with Stanford
last November, in the squad's 1993 recruit
ing class.
Men's lacrosse
Five representatives of the Cardinal
men's lacrosse team helped the Northern
Conference to a 14-13 victory in the Western
Collegiate Lacrosse League all-star game last
Sunday in La Jolla, Calif.
Senior attackman Erik Cetrulo, midfield
ers Alex Perkins (a senior) and Mike Todd (a
sophomore) along with senior defenseman
Joey Donahue combined for six of the
North's points, while junior goalie Eric
Grasser staved off a last-second shot attempt
to preserve the victory.
