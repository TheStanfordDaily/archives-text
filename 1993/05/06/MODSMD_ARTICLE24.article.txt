# Tennis teams get 'second season' seedings
## 
### Andy Eiser Editorial staff 
It was no secret that the Car
dinal men's and women's tennis
squads would be attending their
respective NCAA Championships
this season. However, yesterday's
postseason seeding announce
ments gave both Stanford clubs a
better idea of exactly what stands
between them and a national
title.
The verdicts: the men, seeking
to repeat as team champions, have
received the fourth seed in their
tournament, scheduled for May
14-23 in Athens, Ga.; the women,
champions in six of the last seven
years, are the No. 2 seed in their
bracket, slated to be played May
12-20 in Gainesville, Fla.
With Georgia on their minds,
the Cardinal men (19-4, 7-3 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) rose four places
above their most recent No. 8
ranking by virtue of escaping a
rough Pac-10 schedule with a
third-place finish. Conference
champion USC (18-2, 9-1), to
whom Stanford dropped a narrow
5-4 decision at Stanford Tennis
Stadium last month, received the
top seed in the national tourna
ment. UCLA (22-2, 8-2), ranked
No. 1 in Intercollegiate Tennis
Association poll for much of the
spring, dropped to No. 2, while
host Georgia (20-3) holds down the
third spot.
"We're delighted to be going to
Georgia and looking forward to
our first-round match," said Car
dinal coach Dick Gould.
Stanford, led by recent All-Pac
-10 selection Michael Flanagan,
actually sits out the first round of
championship play while awaiting
the winner of a May 14 match
between New Mexico (17-11) and
Colorado (23-6), both of whom are
seeded alphabetically in the 13 to
20 range. The Cardinal, who did
not face the Lobos or the Buffaloes
during the regular season, will

then take to the courts in the
round of 16 the following day.
Should Stanford survive its
first test, it will take on a Southern
opponent, either fifth-seeded Ten
nessee or ninth-seeded Texas, in
the quarterfinals. Not until the
national semifinals — where a
third showdown with the Trojans
could materialize — does the Car
dinal harbor the possibility of fac
ing a familiar foe.
"We hope to give a good account
of West Coast and Northern Cali
fornia tennis," Gould said. "We're
a team that's been continually
improving throughout the year,
and I see no reason why we need to
stop that trend. We're anxious to
begin the 'new' season and defend
our title."
While the Cardinal men seek a

postseason revival, the women
(23-2, 9-1) are looking to recover
from a string of injuries in time to
cruise to a title. Standing in their
way is Florida (24-1), with whom
Stanford split its two regular-sea
son meetings, and a string of five
Pac-10 rivals against which the
Cardinal amassed an impressive
10-1 head-to-head mark. All six
conference representatives are
among the top 11 seeds in
Gainesville.
"We're pleased to be seeded No.
2, and we're looking forward to
going to Gainesville," said Cardi
nal coach Frank Brennan, recently
named Pac-10 Coach of the Year.
"We hope we can live up to our
seeding, and more than that, we
hope to regain the national cham
pionship."

Led by conference Player of the
Year Laxmi Poruri and All-Pac-10
selections Kim Shasby and
Heather Willens, the women will
also await the winner of a first
round play-in — a May 12 match
between 18th-seeded Notre Dame
(17-7) and No. 15 Miami (F1a.)(14-
7) — and will challenge the winner
the following day in round-of-16
action. Should the Cardinal get
through to the quarterfinals, it
will take on either No. 12 Indiana,
the automatic qualifier from the
Midwest, or No. 7 Georgia.
The Cardinal could then exact
revenge on fourth-seeded Califor
nia, which upset Stanford in
Berkeley last month, in the semifi
nal round before facing either the
Gators or third-seeded Duke in the
national championship match.
