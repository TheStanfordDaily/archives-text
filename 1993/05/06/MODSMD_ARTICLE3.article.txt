## 
### Dina Updegraff 
In what is expected to be one of the largest
powwows on the West Coast, thousands of Native
Americans will gather on campus this weekend
for three days of dancing, music and celebration.
In recent years, more than 20,000 people
have attended the annual festival of Native
American culture and traditions. This year's or
ganizers are expecting a similar turnout, as peo
ple from across the United States and Canada
plan to attend the event.
Organizers chose the theme "Continuing
Our Heritage: Along Our Ancestors' Trail" be
cause they wanted to dedicate their accomplish
ments at Stanford to their ancestors, said

sophomore Travis Michael, a member of the
Powwow committee.
"We looked at where our ancestors had been
and what they did to make it possible for us to be
here at school, and for us to be alive," he said.
Michael said the organizers wanted this
year's Powwow to encompass more than just
themselves and attendees. "We wanted to in
clude the organizers, relatives and our ances
tors," he said.
The Powwow tradition began 22 years ago
with a small group of Native American students
who wanted to express their heritage, said Kim
ball Sekaquaptewa, another member of the
Powwow committee.
Each year, as the number of Native Ameri

can undergraduates, graduates and staff.' on
campus grew, so did the size of the Powwow,
said Sekaquaptewa.
The largest multicultural event at Stan ford,
the Powwow is organized by students and spon
sored by the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation. Funding for the $50,000 event is raised
through donations and rentals of booth space at
the fair, Sekaquaptewa said.
According to Michael, the biggest event at
this year's Powwow will be a dance competition.
Men will perform a grass-dance that began as a
social, religious and healingdance, while women
will compete in the fancy shawl, a fluid dance
with intricate footwork.
Activities begin tomorrow
night with the grand entry of
dancers and will continue until
Sunday. All events will be held on
the intramural fields adjacent to
Stanford Stadium.
There is no charge for admis
sion or parking. In addition to
the dance competition there will
be art, craft, souvenir, informa
tion and food booths, organizers
said.
