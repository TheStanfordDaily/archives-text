Summer officially starts this Friday.
Hollywood's summer film schedule,
that is. Four months of non-stop ac
tion, comedy and sex that's expected to rake
in 2.3 billion dollars — over six years worth
of Demi Moore's company.
Sch-wing.
With more than 60 titles slated for re
lease, how can those friendly marketing ex
ecutives help us make up our minds about
which movies we'll go see?

The trailers.
Yes, those 30 second to
two-minute previews of vis
ceral footage accompanied by

N'Gai Croal

pounding scores, ending with the promise
that they're "Coming Soon To A Gogolplex
Near You."
They're so arrogant.
Today's trailers have become works of art
— they're often much better than the actual
films they're promoting. The preview for
last summer's "Patriot Games" intercut
shots of an inexpressive Harrison Ford des
perately trying to save his family with shots
of a fraying American flag. At the end of
trailer, the film's title and credits appear be
hind the now shredded Old Glory.
So much promise. So little delivery.
A similar problem afflicted Eddie Mur
phy's "Boomerang." The trailer, scored with
Paula Abdul's infectious "Vibeology," fea
tured scenes of Eddie scamming on various
nubian goddesses, only to meet his match in
Robin Givens. The previews suggested a so
phisticated comedy, but the film just
churned out more of the gutter humor that
we've come to expect from the former King
of Comedy.
Dethroned.
Occasionally, a film is much better than its
trailer. That maxim holds true for many in
dependent or foreign films, whose distribu
tors hire Dan Rather-on-Valium sound
alikes to inexpressively narrate what the New
York Times critics had to say about the film.
Get me a restraining order.

This year's trailers also double as public
services for audiences. Why see Sylvester Stal
lone's upcoming "Cliffhanger" when we've
got the sneaking suspicion that all of the film's
stunts were packed into the two-minute pre
view? And doesn't the overly insistent use of
Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" as under
score suggest Sly's desperate attempt to pump
up his sagging career?
Adrian.
Other people direct their trailers more

suspensefully. John Singleton
wisely hitched the preview
for his upcoming "Poetic Jus

tice" to Spike Lee's "Malcolm
X." It didn't tell us much about the story, but
Janet Jackson in long braids walking by
brothers drinking malt liquor out of brown
paper bags in South Centra] said it all.
One picture. A thousand words. Got it?
And the O.G. of tough guys, Clint Eastwood
— whose 15,000 previews for "Unforgiven"
played a key role in that film's success — came
back strapped as a Secret Service agent for"In
the Line of Fire." In the trailer, the hands of a
clock tick as a crazed assassin promises to mur
der both Eastwood and the President. Cut to
Eastwood sitting at a desk. He slams a clip of
ammo into his gun, turns to the audience
and says, "That's not gonna happen."
Damn skippy.
But there's a more subversive trend going
on in today's previews — it's the music. How
many of us noticed that the trailer for last
year's pathetic Van Damme kickfest, "Uni
versal Soldier," stole its score from the vastly
superior "Terminator 2?" Or that the trailer
for the upcoming "Sliver" recycles the score
from "Basic Instinct," subliminally promis
ing to show us every nook and cranny of
Sharon Stone's beautifully toned body?
Money shot, indeed.
So when you make your next run for the
local movie theater, pay a little more atten
tion to those trailers. There's more going on
there than you might think.
Right. ■
