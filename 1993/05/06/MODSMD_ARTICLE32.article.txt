## Administrators, music they love 
### 
All this week, we're tooting every
whistle and ringing every bell to cel
ebrate the release of an exciting new
K-Tel/Sessions boxed CD set: The Associat
ed Press First-Team, All-Stanford Adminis
trators Collection, Volume I: "Soothing the
Savage Beast Within."
Our lead-off hitter is Sally Cole. Sally is a
5-foot-7 southpaw from America's Heart
land. As the University judicial affairs offi

cer, she has an unblemished
record and bats a strong .275
as a switch hitter.
In an exclusive Intermis
sion interview, Sally had this
to say: "My job is at the front
end, deciding if a student-con-

Pat Dote
Jim Haljun

duct problem requires a formal disciplinary
process.
"And I make these decisions without
benefit of music, being one of those unfor
tunates who can't both think and listen to
music simultaneously." So here's our
Power Users Tip: If you get in trouble, bring
a tape deck. Check the batteries.
Out of town, and out of rotation this
week, is Dean of Admissions James "You
killed my father" Montoya. Dean of admis
sions — the title sounds like a new Jackie
Collins kiss-and-tell book: "Dean was the
type of guy who drove a Camaro just to hear
the noise it made when it got h0t...," etc.
But, as his e-mail informed us, he was un
available for comment.
But not since the return of Bert Parks
have we as a community witnessed such a
triumphant moment as Jean Fetter coming
out of the dug-out to bat in the role of dean
of admissions one more time (sniff). We
asked her what she listened to while reject
ing students in her former role. She an
swered, "Mozart's 'Requiem.' "
As a bonus for reading this far, "The
Beast Within" comes with a very special
wall-mountable chart for the class of '93. It
features the exact hierarchy and class break
down of the personal notes former Dean

Jean used to write on acceptance letters.
You'll finally know the truth, whether "Ex
cellent" is better than "Bravo."
Gerhard "This is not my house, this is not
my car" Casper had this to say, "I always lis
ten to Kurt Weill's 'Three-Penny Opera'
when I am working on budget cuts." We
hope his public-relations staffhave tactfully
removed "Mack The Knife" from his ver
sion. At least he's not listening to "Sweeny
Todd."

We were going to ask
Edna in the Coffee House
what music de-stressed her
after taking away her 10th
fake ID, but we already

knew the answer: the
Frosh-English remix of "Me and Bobby
McGee" — "Robert McGee and I."
For our next contestant, we posed this
sticky scenario: Campus Crusade For
Christ, Hillel and Sanskriti have, through an
administrative error, all booked the White
Plaza Gazebo on the same day to celebrate
simultaneously occurring but mutually ex
clusive religious holidays.
But our man, Troy "Ba-Da-Bing, Ba-Da-
Boom" Gilbert, the program coordinator at
the Office of Student Activities didn't even
blink. He said, "Whenever I'm stressed out,
I listen to the Village People. Not the YMCA
song. 'Ready For The '80s' and 'San Francis
co' are my favorites."
Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe, recently called up from Triple-A ball,
Nebraska, listens to "Satisfaction (I can't get
no)" by the Rolling Stones while contem
plating disciplinary action against fraterni
ties.
We were going to ask Don "Boom-
Boom" Kennedy what his least favorite song
is, but we figured it was the theme song to
"60 Minutes."
Now, how much would you pay? We'll
throw in the Ginzu steak knives, Zildjian
drum sticks and a year's supply of Ronco
smokeless ash-trays for free. ■
