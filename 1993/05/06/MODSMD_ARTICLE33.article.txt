Has the recent spell of balmy weath
er made you a little bit too carefree?
Is your disposition just a tad too
sunny? Then go to the Drama Department
this weekend and check out their production
of David Mamet's "Edmond," one of the
darkest plays of a playwright who's never
been known for endearing, feel-good stories.
This 1982 work from the Pulitzer Prize
winning author of "Glengarry Glen Ross,"
"Sexual Perversity in Chicago" and most re
cently, the controversial off-Broadway play
"Oleanna," charts the torturous journey of a
white, middle-aged attorney named Ed
mond Burke.
Edmond flees his impeccably manicured
lifestyle for the underworld of New York
City, forcing him to confront the sexual
urges, the violence, the love and the hate that
he's repressed for years. A simultaneous de
scent into the terrifying and forbidden
depths of both the human psyche and our

society, "Edmond" has much to say about
both places.
Psychologically, the play functions as a
Nietzschean commentary on individuality
and, perhaps more importantly, individual
responsibility within society.
Director Andrew Shakman, a senior ma
joring in drama, says, "It's about what hap
pens to you when you confront the other,
when you step out into society and attempt
to empower yourself Once [Edmond]
has confronted the other, he has a clearer
idea of the self."
Edmond confronts "the other" directly
and physically as he stumbles through a se
ries of increasingly violent encounters with
the residents of a world that is foreign to him.
After an altercation with a black pimp, Ed
mond raves:
"I wanted to KILL him. In that moment 30
years of prejudice came out of me For
the first time I saw: THEY'RE PEOPLE,
TOO."
Zander Teller, who plays Edmond, be

lieves that this scene represents an interme
diate step in Edmond's self-realization, in
which he begins to ask of others what he
eventually asks of himself.
"I've come to think that it means he has
chosen to require [black people] to take re
sponsibility for their actions," Teller ex
plains, "but in that, not yet acknowledging
his role in their position."
It's ironic that Edmond struggles to em
power himself within an underclass that he
has indirectly oppressed throughout his life.
This paradox, Shakman believes, is one of
Mamet's major thematic elements.
"The sense is that in this world you can
not survive unless you oppress another, that
there's this sort of capitalist dynamic ... that
there are a lot of individuals basically existing
in society and not realizing, as [Mamet] says,
to what extent they are a cause and to what
extent they are an effect."
Shakman emphasizes this endless cycle of

oppression by staging the five-minute
Samuel Beckett playlet "What Where" both
before and after "Edmond." In this typically
abstract piece, five characters are forced to
interrogate each other in turn, as Teller's dis
embodied voice directs the proceedings.
" 'What Where' is kind of like a shrunken
head version of 'Edmond.' " Shakman says,
explaining the thematic connection between
the two pieces. "You reduce the society to five
people, and that's what you will get
'What Where' is all about power."
Shakman believes that "Edmond" will
have a different meaning at Stanford
than it has in the more urban settings
where the play has previously been per
formed:
"I think that it would be more resonant if
you walked off the street in New York after
just stepping over a bum or some homeless
guy asking you for money as you walked in
the door of this theater you just paid $80 for
.... In the Stanford environment I think it's

a little bit harder."
Shakman hopes that his straightforward,
unmediated presentation of Mamet's gritty
script will impact Stanford audiences as more
than just their "cultural event for the weekend."
"My hope is that this will be perceived as
a strong piece: one that doesn't pull any
punches, one that doesn't attempt to
preach," Shakman says. "You will go into this
and you will be confronted with people using
real language about blacks and gays, and it's
not pretty. It's not a pretty play about race or
a pretty play about urban decay I hope it
will liven things up a bit."
As with most Mamet plays — and any
other creative works that deal with such
volatile issues as violence and bigotry —
"Edmond" runs the risk of crossing some ill
defined line between exploring issues of
racism and sexism and simply venting white
male frustration. Shakman quickly acknowl
edges the subjective nature of the play:
"I'm a white guy and I'm directing it;
Mamet is a white guy and he wrote it; Edmond
is a white guy and he is it. It's most definitely a
white man's perspective. It's not objective."
This perspective manifests itself in the
stereotypical Southern black dialect that
Mamet has written for the two black charac
ters in the play. Tonka Cadoree, who plays both
roles, had trouble with the language at first:
"I was wondering, 'Why doesn't he say it
this way, how black people really speak now?'
I fought it at first, but then I just said 'He

must be trying to do something,' so I let my
self play the language just like it sounds."
As with any other playwright, Mamet's
perspective will ultimately be judged by what
he leaves the audience with by the end of the
play. Cadoree points out the importance of
listening carefully to Mamet's subtext:
"I think he's not a racist or a sexist. I think
he's really trying to say something here
You have to pay attention to the last scene,
because if you don't, you could come out of
it thinking that Mamet is just this racist, sex
ist bastard."
Because both Mamet and Shakman resist
the temptation to separate themselves from
Edmond by interjecting their personal ideol
ogy or deconstructing the play in perfor
mance, Shakman realizes the result won't suit
every audience member's taste. "Some of
them, I'm sure, will hate it and some of them
will like it and some will feel somewhat in be
tween."
In any case, it seems clear that it will be
difficult for anyone to leave the theater en
tirely unaffected by this striking and con
frontational production. ■

"Edmond" will be performed in the Eleanor
Prosser Studio on the second floor of the
Drama Department, Thursday and Friday
(May 6 and 7) at 8 pm and Saturday (May 8)
at 7pm and 10pm. Admission is $3 at the door
only, and no latecomers will be seated.

"Edmond" runs the risk of crossing some ill

racism and sexism and simply venting white
male frustration. Shakman quickly acknowl
edges the subjective nature of the play:
"I'm a white guy and I'm directing it;
Mamet is a white guy and he wrote it; Edmond
is a white guy and he is it. It's most definitely a
white man's perspective. It's not objective."
This perspective manifests itself in the
stereotypical Southern black dialect that
Mamet has written for the two black charac
ters in the play. Tonka Cadoree, who plays both
roles, had trouble with the language at first:
"I was wondering, 'Why doesn't he say it
this way, how black people really speak now?'
I fought it at first, but then I just said 'He

must be trying to do something,' so I let my
self play the language just like it sounds."
As with any other playwright, Mamet's
perspective will ultimately be judged by what
he leaves the audience with by the end of the
play. Cadoree points out the importance of
listening carefully to Mamet's subtext:
"I think he's not a racist or a sexist. I think
he's really trying to say something here
You have to pay attention to the last scene,
because if you don't, you could come out of
it thinking that Mamet is just this racist, sex
ist bastard."
Because both Mamet and Shakman resist
the temptation to separate themselves from
Edmond by interjecting their personal ideol
ogy or deconstructing the play in perfor
mance, Shakman realizes the result won't suit
every audience member's taste. "Some of
them, I'm sure, will hate it and some of them
will like it and some will feel somewhat in be
tween."
In any case, it seems clear that it will be
difficult for anyone to leave the theater en
tirely unaffected by this striking and con
frontational production. ■

"Edmond" will be performed in the Eleanor
Prosser Studio on the second floor of the
Drama Department, Thursday and Friday
(May 6 and 7) at 8 pm and Saturday (May 8)
at 7pm and 10pm. Admission is $3 at the door

Has the recent spell of balmy weath
er made you a little bit too carefree?
Is your disposition just a tad too
sunny? Then go to the Drama Department
this weekend and check out their production
of David Mamet's "Edmond," one of the
darkest plays of a playwright who's never
been known for endearing, feel-good stories.
This 1982 work from the Pulitzer Prize
winning author of "Glengarry Glen Ross,"
"Sexual Perversity in Chicago" and most re
cently, the controversial off-Broadway play
"Oleanna," charts the torturous journey of a
white, middle-aged attorney named Ed
mond Burke.
Edmond flees his impeccably manicured
lifestyle for the underworld of New York
City, forcing him to confront the sexual
urges, the violence, the love and the hate that
he's repressed for years. A simultaneous de
scent into the terrifying and forbidden
depths of both the human psyche and our

society, "Edmond" has much to say about
both places.
Psychologically, the play functions as a
Nietzschean commentary on individuality
and, perhaps more importantly, individual
responsibility within society.
Director Andrew Shakman, a senior ma
joring in drama, says, "It's about what hap
pens to you when you confront the other,
when you step out into society and attempt
to empower yourself Once [Edmond]
has confronted the other, he has a clearer
idea of the self."
Edmond confronts "the other" directly
and physically as he stumbles through a se
ries of increasingly violent encounters with
the residents of a world that is foreign to him.
After an altercation with a black pimp, Ed
mond raves:
"I wanted to KILL him. In that moment 30
years of prejudice came out of me For
the first time I saw: THEY'RE PEOPLE,
TOO."
Zander Teller, who plays Edmond, be

lieves that this scene represents an interme
diate step in Edmond's self-realization, in
which he begins to ask of others what he
eventually asks of himself.
"I've come to think that it means he has
chosen to require [black people] to take re
sponsibility for their actions," Teller ex
plains, "but in that, not yet acknowledging
his role in their position."
It's ironic that Edmond struggles to em
power himself within an underclass that he
has indirectly oppressed throughout his life.
This paradox, Shakman believes, is one of
Mamet's major thematic elements.
"The sense is that in this world you can
not survive unless you oppress another, that
there's this sort of capitalist dynamic ... that
there are a lot of individuals basically existing
in society and not realizing, as [Mamet] says,
to what extent they are a cause and to what
extent they are an effect."
Shakman emphasizes this endless cycle of

oppression by staging the five-minute
Samuel Beckett playlet "What Where" both
before and after "Edmond." In this typically
abstract piece, five characters are forced to
interrogate each other in turn, as Teller's dis
embodied voice directs the proceedings.
" 'What Where' is kind of like a shrunken
head version of 'Edmond.' " Shakman says,
explaining the thematic connection between
the two pieces. "You reduce the society to five
people, and that's what you will get
'What Where' is all about power."
Shakman believes that "Edmond" will
have a different meaning at Stanford
than it has in the more urban settings
where the play has previously been per
formed:
"I think that it would be more resonant if
you walked off the street in New York after
just stepping over a bum or some homeless
guy asking you for money as you walked in
the door of this theater you just paid $80 for
.... In the Stanford environment I think it's

a little bit harder."
Shakman hopes that his straightforward,
unmediated presentation of Mamet's gritty
script will impact Stanford audiences as more
than just their "cultural event for the weekend."
"My hope is that this will be perceived as
a strong piece: one that doesn't pull any
punches, one that doesn't attempt to
preach," Shakman says. "You will go into this
and you will be confronted with people using
real language about blacks and gays, and it's
not pretty. It's not a pretty play about race or
a pretty play about urban decay I hope it
will liven things up a bit."
As with most Mamet plays — and any
other creative works that deal with such
volatile issues as violence and bigotry —
"Edmond" runs the risk of crossing some ill
defined line between exploring issues of
racism and sexism and simply venting white
male frustration. Shakman quickly acknowl
edges the subjective nature of the play:
"I'm a white guy and I'm directing it;
Mamet is a white guy and he wrote it; Edmond
is a white guy and he is it. It's most definitely a
white man's perspective. It's not objective."
This perspective manifests itself in the
stereotypical Southern black dialect that
Mamet has written for the two black charac
ters in the play. Tonka Cadoree, who plays both
roles, had trouble with the language at first:
"I was wondering, 'Why doesn't he say it
this way, how black people really speak now?'
I fought it at first, but then I just said 'He

must be trying to do something,' so I let my
self play the language just like it sounds."
As with any other playwright, Mamet's
perspective will ultimately be judged by what
he leaves the audience with by the end of the
play. Cadoree points out the importance of
listening carefully to Mamet's subtext:
"I think he's not a racist or a sexist. I think
he's really trying to say something here
You have to pay attention to the last scene,
because if you don't, you could come out of
it thinking that Mamet is just this racist, sex
ist bastard."
Because both Mamet and Shakman resist
the temptation to separate themselves from
Edmond by interjecting their personal ideol
ogy or deconstructing the play in perfor
mance, Shakman realizes the result won't suit
every audience member's taste. "Some of
them, I'm sure, will hate it and some of them
will like it and some will feel somewhat in be
tween."
In any case, it seems clear that it will be

tirely unaffected by this striking and con
