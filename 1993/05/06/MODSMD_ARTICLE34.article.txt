QUEER

Two weeks ago, legions of queers
— lesbians, gays, bisexuals, etc. —
marched on Washington to assert
their humanity, their pride and
their power. It wasn't the first gay
pride parade. Nor was it the first such
March on Washington. But it was the
biggest and loudest one the world of politics
had ever seen.

Elsewhere, the same kinds of assertions
have appeared more and more in the last
few years — in the world of theater.
A new, self-assertive, yet sober brand of

queer drama is hitting the stage, and
the Bay Area is getting more than

its share. At least three such
shows are playing this

weekend in San Francisco
alone, each with a different

take on what it means to be queer today.
"The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,"
"Falsettos" and "Why We Have A Body"
each offer a thought-provoking and enter
taining perspective on the queer nation that
is still being built.
Of course, it would be naive to pretend
that the association between the theater and
gay men in particular is anything new. But
the relationship between homosexuality and
drama has evolved over the past several
decades.
Gay and lesbian issues in early modern
American drama were often obscured, with
the homosexuality being mouthed rather
than shouted. Plays like "Cat on A Hot Tin
Roof" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" were written by gay playwrights
and dealt with gay characters and relation
ships. But to the uninitiated, they were sim
ply entertaining or intriguing fare, though
perhaps a bit confusing in places.
Eventually, plays were written that dealt
with gays in a straightforward manner. But
even into the '80s, gays and lesbians were so
invisible to mainstream society that the
shock value of a gay character or relation
ship provided entertainment in and of itself.
That's not to deprecate plays like "Boys
in the Band" from the '60s and "Torch Song
Trilogy" from the early '80s. These plays,
and the films made out of them, effectively
conveyed tales of gay lives to American audi
ences. But too many such plays dealt with
various manifestations of the closet, and
how many coming-out stories must we hear?
Then came the plague.
With the death of thousands of great
minds, voices, hands and feet, AIDS has
been a curse on the arts in general. But
beginning in the mid-'Bos, gay theater in
particular began to spring back with power
ful plays — and later, musicals — that face
the devastation of AIDS squarely.
Larry Kramer's "The Normal Heart" is
widely recognized as the first major AIDS
play, but other shows such as "As Is" and
"Safe Sex" also broke the same ground.
But even the plays of this generation
that don't deal with AIDS have the same

self-assertion, the same brash lesbian and
gay characters who are living their out

lives, rather than spitting out varia
tions on a how-I-discovered-my

sexuality theme. These plays can be
appropriately called "queer drama" as

opposed to "homosexual plays" or "gay
and lesbian theater."
/he Night Larry Kramer
Kissed Me," a one-man
show playing through
Sunday in the City is one
such play. Performed by
New Yorker David Drake, who also wrote
the script, "Kissed Me" is a hauntingly on-

target portrayal of gay life in the '90s, deal
ing with growing up gay, maneuvering
through the gay heaven/hell of gyms and
nightclubs, and confronting losses of friends
and lovers to AIDS.
In his first vignette, Drake talks about
three Broadway shows, each of which corre
sponds to a generation of gay theater, that

he saw on his sixth, 16th
and 22nd birthdays.

The shows were,
respectively: "West Side

Story" (you have to look
hard, but it's there), "A Chorus

Line" (the scene with the gay dancer

made Drake cry) and"The Normal Heart"
(which was the night Kramer "kissed" him
and turned him into a queer activist).
As gay theater matured, so did Drake,
and he shares this by telling his coming-out
story in terms of the theater he watched on
his birthdays.
Commenting in an interview that his

show deals with "sissy-boy pain," it is
clear that for Drake, life didn't give
him much rest, between the pain of
being teased as a child and the pain
of losing loved ones to AIDS as an
adult.
Drake, 29, came out as a teenager,

which makes him among the youngest of
the first AIDS generation — gay men who
were out and active when the first men
started dying. "I began my adult life after
the epidemic was in full swing," Drake says.
"['Kissed Me'] is my coming-of-age story
whose context is the plague. What I'm really
asking is, 'How do I find hope and love and
laughs and truth through this overwhelm
ing sense of loss?"'
Indeed, the show's most powerful
moment comes at its end when, in the
ironically titled scene "A Thousand Points
of Light," Drake lights a candle for each
person close to him who died of AIDS.
The message is deliberate, Drake says.
"I don't want us to forget the epidemic.
It's not incidental to who I am that [impor
tant people in my life] have HIV or AIDS or
have died."

Currently playing at the Curran
Theatre in San Francisco,
William Finn's "Falsettos" is actu
ally two musicals — each written
to stand alone, one set pre-AIDS
and one smack dab in the middle of it.
The first musical, "March of the
Falsettos," tells the tale of Marvin, a gay man
who leaves his wife and son to move in with
his lover, while his psychiatrist moves in
with his wife and son. It's a high energy,
corny story which, despite its poignant

moments (Marvin being rec
onciled with his son

Jason in "Father to
Son") and its

hilarious
ones

a <*>
<~&\rP K cfi°
\C <■
°C° ,%<<*
x^ e <°
x> e

(Marvin's
wife Trina ner

vously "Breaking
Down") manages to say

very little.

Still, America could use more por
traits of gay men being fathers, and when

"March of the Falsettos" first came out in
1981, it was undoubtedly well-received by
the gay community for helping to break
down stereotypes.
But that same year, men started getting
sick with a rare form of cancer. And it's
"Falsettoland," set in 1981 but written nine
years later, that is the best part of the show,
and makes it a part of queer drama.
Marvin's lover, Whizzer, gets sick with
AIDS and we see Marvin, his family, and"the
lesbians from next door" care for Whizzer on
his deathbed. Like the first musical, there's

plenty of humor and fun in all the pain, but
"Falsettoland" loses the farce and

expresses the confusion and
loss AIDS brings.

But
"Falsettoland" is

no post-

AIDS

A J aO^
<o*T

musi
cal. It's set

right at the
beginning of the epi

demic, and as the artistic
director wrote in the liner

notes, "the audience knows more
about the illness than the characters do" —
which makes the show all the more terrifying.
"Falsettos" is currently playing on
Broadway, and here in the Bay Area it's part
of the "Best of Broadway" series that already
brought "Guys and Dolls" and will soon
bring "Evita" and eventually "Phantom of
the Opera" to the City. Because of its popu
larity, audiences are less queer than those
attracted to, say, "Kissed Me" would be.
The mixed nature of the audience is fas
cinating from just a people-watching per
spective. One woman — straight, no doubt
— sitting on the other side of my boyfriend
laughed when Marvin sang to Whizzer
"God, you're a pain in the ass!" She quickly
noticed that no one else was laughing and
shut her mouth.
One aspect of "Falsettos" that finds res
onance elsewhere in queer drama is how
Jewish much of it is. From the opening song
("Four Jews in a Room Bitching") to the
kosher caterer and impromptu bar mitzvah,

"Falsettos" is a very Jewish
play. Indeed, playwrights
" ,; th last names like

Kramer and Kushner
are the vanguards of

queer drama.
David Drake isn't

Jewish, but says he
admires both Kramer and

Tony Kushner (author of the
Pulitzer prize-winning "Angels in

America") and has a few theories that
may explain this phenomenon. Not

only do both Jews and queers have a

long history in the theater, but "there's a
cohesion in Jewish culture that puts a premi
um on ritual," Drake says. And in a culture
devastated by AIDS, Drake and others are des
perately searching for rituals to contextualize
and come to terms with the epidemic.
Drake also makes frequent references to
the Holocaust, which Kramer has made a
central metaphor for AIDS. For Drake,
plays like his own that deal with AIDS are
an attempt to come to grips with the

"Holocaust" of AIDS, which he says is per
fectly natural for a community faced with
destruction: "much like the Jews didn't say
'Let's forget about the Holocaust.' "
he Holocaust and slavery are the
W* favorite subjects of Mary, a men
tal-patient-turned-hold-up-artist
in Claire Chafee's "Why We Have
Hi a Body," playing through May 23
in the City. Mary, both the comic and tragic
fulcrum of the play, is an off-kilter, yet sym
pathetic character whose delusions are real
ly those of a society that tells women what
they can and cannot be.

Though clearly
part of the queer-drama

scene, "Why We Have a
Body" diverges from
the other two plays

in not dealing with
AIDS or gay men
— or men, for

that matter. It's diffi
cult to summarize the

plot, because there isn't much
of one. Rather, this play centers on

characters, specifically women exploring
femininity and lesbian identity.
I have to admit that I didn't get all the
jokes. I was one of maybe 10 men in a
packed house of women — many of them
with short hair and practical shoes — and I
felt sort of guilty for not understanding
some of the more obscure references to les
bians and how they basically have different
brain structures and all.
But that's a good thing. Queer drama is
about no longer stopping, apologizing and
explaining our sexuality to outsiders. Queer
drama is proud and unabashed and not
necessarily written so that our mothers
won't be embarrassed.
Mary's mother is one of the four women
portrayed in "Body," although she's the least
explored. She gets the best laugh line of the
show, however, when she talks of how she got
over her guilt for her daughter Lily being a
lesbian. Her guilt ended when Lily quipped:
"Why should you get all the credit?"
"Body" puts women in non-traditional
roles and professions — in addition to the
convenience-store robber, there's Lily the
private detective and Renee the paleontolo
gist. There's even a television screen when
you walk in that shows a movie about
women gladiators and knights.
The relationship between Lily and
Renee is hilariously explored. Renee is mar
ried, yet when she meets the openly lesbian
Lily on an airplane, she's intrigued and flirts
with her, and eventually the two go to a
hotel room together.
In a subsequent monologue, Renee
relates how the next day, in a grocery store,
all she noticed were the women there. She
made eye contact with everyone in the place
and the woman behind the check-out
counter even asked her if she wanted paper
or plastic in a "sexual" way.
True, Renee's tale is another coming-out
story, but in the context of "Body" it's defi
nitely queer drama. The characters in this play
deal with sexuality on their own terms, and
there isn't a single apology in the entire show.
And that's what queer drama is about. ■

(Marvin's
wife Trina ner

vously "Breaking
Down") manages to say

very little.

Still, America could use more por
traits of gay men being fathers, and when

"March of the Falsettos" first came out in
1981, it was undoubtedly well-received by
the gay community for helping to break
down stereotypes.
But that same year, men started getting
sick with a rare form of cancer. And it's
"Falsettoland," set in 1981 but written nine
years later, that is the best part of the show,
and makes it a part of queer drama.
Marvin's lover, Whizzer, gets sick with
AIDS and we see Marvin, his family, and"the
lesbians from next door" care for Whizzer on
his deathbed. Like the first musical, there's

plenty of humor and fun in all the pain, but
"Falsettoland" loses the farce and

expresses the confusion and
loss AIDS brings.

But
"Falsettoland" is

no post-

AIDS

A J aO^
<o*T

musi
cal. It's set

right at the
beginning of the epi

demic, and as the artistic
director wrote in the liner

notes, "the audience knows more
about the illness than the characters do" —
which makes the show all the more terrifying.
"Falsettos" is currently playing on
Broadway, and here in the Bay Area it's part
of the "Best of Broadway" series that already
brought "Guys and Dolls" and will soon
bring "Evita" and eventually "Phantom of
the Opera" to the City. Because of its popu
larity, audiences are less queer than those
attracted to, say, "Kissed Me" would be.
The mixed nature of the audience is fas
cinating from just a people-watching per
spective. One woman — straight, no doubt
— sitting on the other side of my boyfriend
laughed when Marvin sang to Whizzer
"God, you're a pain in the ass!" She quickly
noticed that no one else was laughing and
shut her mouth.
One aspect of "Falsettos" that finds res
onance elsewhere in queer drama is how
Jewish much of it is. From the opening song
("Four Jews in a Room Bitching") to the
kosher caterer and impromptu bar mitzvah,

"Falsettos" is a very Jewish
play. Indeed, playwrights
" ,; th last names like

Kramer and Kushner
are the vanguards of

queer drama.
David Drake isn't

Jewish, but says he
admires both Kramer and

Tony Kushner (author of the
Pulitzer prize-winning "Angels in

America") and has a few theories that
may explain this phenomenon. Not

only do both Jews and queers have a

long history in the theater, but "there's a
cohesion in Jewish culture that puts a premi
um on ritual," Drake says. And in a culture
devastated by AIDS, Drake and others are des
perately searching for rituals to contextualize
and come to terms with the epidemic.
Drake also makes frequent references to
the Holocaust, which Kramer has made a
central metaphor for AIDS. For Drake,
plays like his own that deal with AIDS are
an attempt to come to grips with the

"Holocaust" of AIDS, which he says is per
fectly natural for a community faced with
destruction: "much like the Jews didn't say
'Let's forget about the Holocaust.' "
he Holocaust and slavery are the
W* favorite subjects of Mary, a men
tal-patient-turned-hold-up-artist
in Claire Chafee's "Why We Have
Hi a Body," playing through May 23
in the City. Mary, both the comic and tragic
fulcrum of the play, is an off-kilter, yet sym
pathetic character whose delusions are real
ly those of a society that tells women what
they can and cannot be.

Though clearly
part of the queer-drama

scene, "Why We Have a
Body" diverges from
the other two plays

in not dealing with
AIDS or gay men
— or men, for

that matter. It's diffi
cult to summarize the

plot, because there isn't much
of one. Rather, this play centers on

characters, specifically women exploring
femininity and lesbian identity.
I have to admit that I didn't get all the
jokes. I was one of maybe 10 men in a
packed house of women — many of them
with short hair and practical shoes — and I
felt sort of guilty for not understanding
some of the more obscure references to les
bians and how they basically have different
brain structures and all.
But that's a good thing. Queer drama is
about no longer stopping, apologizing and
explaining our sexuality to outsiders. Queer
drama is proud and unabashed and not
necessarily written so that our mothers
won't be embarrassed.
Mary's mother is one of the four women
portrayed in "Body," although she's the least
explored. She gets the best laugh line of the
show, however, when she talks of how she got
over her guilt for her daughter Lily being a
lesbian. Her guilt ended when Lily quipped:
"Why should you get all the credit?"
"Body" puts women in non-traditional
roles and professions — in addition to the
convenience-store robber, there's Lily the
private detective and Renee the paleontolo
gist. There's even a television screen when
you walk in that shows a movie about
women gladiators and knights.
The relationship between Lily and
Renee is hilariously explored. Renee is mar
ried, yet when she meets the openly lesbian
Lily on an airplane, she's intrigued and flirts
with her, and eventually the two go to a
hotel room together.
In a subsequent monologue, Renee
relates how the next day, in a grocery store,
all she noticed were the women there. She
made eye contact with everyone in the place
and the woman behind the check-out
counter even asked her if she wanted paper
or plastic in a "sexual" way.
True, Renee's tale is another coming-out
story, but in the context of "Body" it's defi
nitely queer drama. The characters in this play
deal with sexuality on their own terms, and
there isn't a single apology in the entire show.
And that's what queer drama is about. ■

QUEER

Two weeks ago, legions of queers
— lesbians, gays, bisexuals, etc. —
marched on Washington to assert
their humanity, their pride and
their power. It wasn't the first gay
pride parade. Nor was it the first such
March on Washington. But it was the
biggest and loudest one the world of politics
had ever seen.

Elsewhere, the same kinds of assertions
have appeared more and more in the last
few years — in the world of theater.
A new, self-assertive, yet sober brand of

queer drama is hitting the stage, and
the Bay Area is getting more than

its share. At least three such
shows are playing this

weekend in San Francisco
alone, each with a different

take on what it means to be queer today.
"The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,"
"Falsettos" and "Why We Have A Body"
each offer a thought-provoking and enter
taining perspective on the queer nation that
is still being built.
Of course, it would be naive to pretend
that the association between the theater and
gay men in particular is anything new. But
the relationship between homosexuality and
drama has evolved over the past several
decades.
Gay and lesbian issues in early modern
American drama were often obscured, with
the homosexuality being mouthed rather
than shouted. Plays like "Cat on A Hot Tin
Roof" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" were written by gay playwrights
and dealt with gay characters and relation
ships. But to the uninitiated, they were sim
ply entertaining or intriguing fare, though
perhaps a bit confusing in places.
Eventually, plays were written that dealt
with gays in a straightforward manner. But
even into the '80s, gays and lesbians were so
invisible to mainstream society that the
shock value of a gay character or relation
ship provided entertainment in and of itself.
That's not to deprecate plays like "Boys
in the Band" from the '60s and "Torch Song
Trilogy" from the early '80s. These plays,
and the films made out of them, effectively
conveyed tales of gay lives to American audi
ences. But too many such plays dealt with
various manifestations of the closet, and
how many coming-out stories must we hear?
Then came the plague.
With the death of thousands of great
minds, voices, hands and feet, AIDS has
been a curse on the arts in general. But
beginning in the mid-'Bos, gay theater in
particular began to spring back with power
ful plays — and later, musicals — that face
the devastation of AIDS squarely.
Larry Kramer's "The Normal Heart" is
widely recognized as the first major AIDS
play, but other shows such as "As Is" and
"Safe Sex" also broke the same ground.
But even the plays of this generation
that don't deal with AIDS have the same

self-assertion, the same brash lesbian and
gay characters who are living their out

lives, rather than spitting out varia
tions on a how-I-discovered-my

sexuality theme. These plays can be
appropriately called "queer drama" as

opposed to "homosexual plays" or "gay
and lesbian theater."
/he Night Larry Kramer
Kissed Me," a one-man
show playing through
Sunday in the City is one
such play. Performed by
New Yorker David Drake, who also wrote
the script, "Kissed Me" is a hauntingly on-

target portrayal of gay life in the '90s, deal
ing with growing up gay, maneuvering
through the gay heaven/hell of gyms and
nightclubs, and confronting losses of friends
and lovers to AIDS.
In his first vignette, Drake talks about
three Broadway shows, each of which corre
sponds to a generation of gay theater, that

he saw on his sixth, 16th
and 22nd birthdays.

The shows were,
respectively: "West Side

Story" (you have to look
hard, but it's there), "A Chorus

Line" (the scene with the gay dancer

made Drake cry) and"The Normal Heart"
(which was the night Kramer "kissed" him
and turned him into a queer activist).
As gay theater matured, so did Drake,
and he shares this by telling his coming-out
story in terms of the theater he watched on
his birthdays.
Commenting in an interview that his

show deals with "sissy-boy pain," it is
clear that for Drake, life didn't give
him much rest, between the pain of
being teased as a child and the pain
of losing loved ones to AIDS as an
adult.
Drake, 29, came out as a teenager,

which makes him among the youngest of
the first AIDS generation — gay men who
were out and active when the first men
started dying. "I began my adult life after
the epidemic was in full swing," Drake says.
"['Kissed Me'] is my coming-of-age story
whose context is the plague. What I'm really
asking is, 'How do I find hope and love and
laughs and truth through this overwhelm
ing sense of loss?"'
Indeed, the show's most powerful
moment comes at its end when, in the
ironically titled scene "A Thousand Points
of Light," Drake lights a candle for each
person close to him who died of AIDS.
The message is deliberate, Drake says.
"I don't want us to forget the epidemic.
It's not incidental to who I am that [impor
tant people in my life] have HIV or AIDS or
have died."

Currently playing at the Curran
Theatre in San Francisco,
William Finn's "Falsettos" is actu
ally two musicals — each written
to stand alone, one set pre-AIDS
and one smack dab in the middle of it.
The first musical, "March of the
Falsettos," tells the tale of Marvin, a gay man
who leaves his wife and son to move in with
his lover, while his psychiatrist moves in
with his wife and son. It's a high energy,
corny story which, despite its poignant

moments (Marvin being rec
onciled with his son

Jason in "Father to
Son") and its

hilarious

story, but in the context of "Body" it's defi
nitely queer drama. The characters in this play
deal with sexuality on their own terms, and
there isn't a single apology in the entire show.
And that's what queer drama is about. ■

QUEER

Two weeks ago, legions of queers
— lesbians, gays, bisexuals, etc. —
marched on Washington to assert
their humanity, their pride and
their power. It wasn't the first gay
pride parade. Nor was it the first such
March on Washington. But it was the
biggest and loudest one the world of politics
had ever seen.

Elsewhere, the same kinds of assertions
have appeared more and more in the last
few years — in the world of theater.
A new, self-assertive, yet sober brand of

queer drama is hitting the stage, and
the Bay Area is getting more than

its share. At least three such
shows are playing this

weekend in San Francisco
alone, each with a different

take on what it means to be queer today.
"The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,"
"Falsettos" and "Why We Have A Body"
each offer a thought-provoking and enter
taining perspective on the queer nation that
is still being built.
Of course, it would be naive to pretend
that the association between the theater and
gay men in particular is anything new. But
the relationship between homosexuality and
drama has evolved over the past several
decades.
Gay and lesbian issues in early modern
American drama were often obscured, with
the homosexuality being mouthed rather
than shouted. Plays like "Cat on A Hot Tin
Roof" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" were written by gay playwrights
and dealt with gay characters and relation
ships. But to the uninitiated, they were sim
ply entertaining or intriguing fare, though
perhaps a bit confusing in places.
Eventually, plays were written that dealt
with gays in a straightforward manner. But
even into the '80s, gays and lesbians were so
invisible to mainstream society that the
shock value of a gay character or relation
ship provided entertainment in and of itself.
That's not to deprecate plays like "Boys
in the Band" from the '60s and "Torch Song
Trilogy" from the early '80s. These plays,
and the films made out of them, effectively
conveyed tales of gay lives to American audi
ences. But too many such plays dealt with
various manifestations of the closet, and
how many coming-out stories must we hear?
Then came the plague.
With the death of thousands of great
minds, voices, hands and feet, AIDS has
been a curse on the arts in general. But
beginning in the mid-'Bos, gay theater in
particular began to spring back with power
ful plays — and later, musicals — that face
the devastation of AIDS squarely.
Larry Kramer's "The Normal Heart" is
widely recognized as the first major AIDS
play, but other shows such as "As Is" and
"Safe Sex" also broke the same ground.
But even the plays of this generation
that don't deal with AIDS have the same

self-assertion, the same brash lesbian and
gay characters who are living their out

lives, rather than spitting out varia
tions on a how-I-discovered-my

sexuality theme. These plays can be
appropriately called "queer drama" as

opposed to "homosexual plays" or "gay
and lesbian theater."
/he Night Larry Kramer
Kissed Me," a one-man
show playing through
Sunday in the City is one
such play. Performed by
New Yorker David Drake, who also wrote
the script, "Kissed Me" is a hauntingly on-

target portrayal of gay life in the '90s, deal
ing with growing up gay, maneuvering
through the gay heaven/hell of gyms and
nightclubs, and confronting losses of friends
and lovers to AIDS.
In his first vignette, Drake talks about
three Broadway shows, each of which corre
sponds to a generation of gay theater, that

he saw on his sixth, 16th
and 22nd birthdays.

The shows were,
respectively: "West Side

Story" (you have to look
hard, but it's there), "A Chorus

Line" (the scene with the gay dancer

made Drake cry) and"The Normal Heart"
(which was the night Kramer "kissed" him
and turned him into a queer activist).
As gay theater matured, so did Drake,
and he shares this by telling his coming-out
story in terms of the theater he watched on
his birthdays.
Commenting in an interview that his

show deals with "sissy-boy pain," it is
clear that for Drake, life didn't give
him much rest, between the pain of
being teased as a child and the pain
of losing loved ones to AIDS as an
adult.
Drake, 29, came out as a teenager,

which makes him among the youngest of
the first AIDS generation — gay men who
were out and active when the first men
started dying. "I began my adult life after
the epidemic was in full swing," Drake says.
"['Kissed Me'] is my coming-of-age story
whose context is the plague. What I'm really
asking is, 'How do I find hope and love and
laughs and truth through this overwhelm
ing sense of loss?"'
Indeed, the show's most powerful
moment comes at its end when, in the
ironically titled scene "A Thousand Points
of Light," Drake lights a candle for each
person close to him who died of AIDS.
The message is deliberate, Drake says.
"I don't want us to forget the epidemic.
It's not incidental to who I am that [impor
tant people in my life] have HIV or AIDS or
have died."

Currently playing at the Curran
Theatre in San Francisco,
William Finn's "Falsettos" is actu
ally two musicals — each written
to stand alone, one set pre-AIDS
and one smack dab in the middle of it.
The first musical, "March of the
Falsettos," tells the tale of Marvin, a gay man
who leaves his wife and son to move in with
his lover, while his psychiatrist moves in
with his wife and son. It's a high energy,
corny story which, despite its poignant

moments (Marvin being rec
onciled with his son

Jason in "Father to
Son") and its

hilarious
ones

a <*>
<~&\rP K cfi°
\C <■
°C° ,%<<*
x^ e <°
x> e

(Marvin's
wife Trina ner

vously "Breaking
Down") manages to say

very little.

Still, America could use more por
traits of gay men being fathers, and when

"March of the Falsettos" first came out in
1981, it was undoubtedly well-received by
the gay community for helping to break
down stereotypes.
But that same year, men started getting
sick with a rare form of cancer. And it's
"Falsettoland," set in 1981 but written nine
years later, that is the best part of the show,
and makes it a part of queer drama.
Marvin's lover, Whizzer, gets sick with
AIDS and we see Marvin, his family, and"the
lesbians from next door" care for Whizzer on
his deathbed. Like the first musical, there's

plenty of humor and fun in all the pain, but
"Falsettoland" loses the farce and

expresses the confusion and
loss AIDS brings.

But
"Falsettoland" is

no post-

AIDS

A J aO^
<o*T

musi
cal. It's set

right at the
beginning of the epi

demic, and as the artistic
director wrote in the liner

notes, "the audience knows more
about the illness than the characters do" —
which makes the show all the more terrifying.
"Falsettos" is currently playing on
Broadway, and here in the Bay Area it's part
of the "Best of Broadway" series that already
brought "Guys and Dolls" and will soon
bring "Evita" and eventually "Phantom of
the Opera" to the City. Because of its popu
larity, audiences are less queer than those
attracted to, say, "Kissed Me" would be.
The mixed nature of the audience is fas
cinating from just a people-watching per
spective. One woman — straight, no doubt
— sitting on the other side of my boyfriend
laughed when Marvin sang to Whizzer
"God, you're a pain in the ass!" She quickly
noticed that no one else was laughing and
shut her mouth.
One aspect of "Falsettos" that finds res
onance elsewhere in queer drama is how
Jewish much of it is. From the opening song
("Four Jews in a Room Bitching") to the
kosher caterer and impromptu bar mitzvah,

"Falsettos" is a very Jewish
play. Indeed, playwrights
" ,; th last names like

Kramer and Kushner
are the vanguards of

queer drama.
David Drake isn't

Jewish, but says he
admires both Kramer and

Tony Kushner (author of the
Pulitzer prize-winning "Angels in

America") and has a few theories that
may explain this phenomenon. Not

only do both Jews and queers have a

long history in the theater, but "there's a
cohesion in Jewish culture that puts a premi
um on ritual," Drake says. And in a culture
devastated by AIDS, Drake and others are des
perately searching for rituals to contextualize
and come to terms with the epidemic.
Drake also makes frequent references to
the Holocaust, which Kramer has made a
central metaphor for AIDS. For Drake,
plays like his own that deal with AIDS are
an attempt to come to grips with the

"Holocaust" of AIDS, which he says is per
fectly natural for a community faced with
destruction: "much like the Jews didn't say
'Let's forget about the Holocaust.' "
he Holocaust and slavery are the
W* favorite subjects of Mary, a men
tal-patient-turned-hold-up-artist
in Claire Chafee's "Why We Have
Hi a Body," playing through May 23
in the City. Mary, both the comic and tragic
fulcrum of the play, is an off-kilter, yet sym
pathetic character whose delusions are real
ly those of a society that tells women what
they can and cannot be.

Though clearly
part of the queer-drama

scene, "Why We Have a
Body" diverges from
the other two plays

in not dealing with
AIDS or gay men
— or men, for

that matter. It's diffi
cult to summarize the

plot, because there isn't much
of one. Rather, this play centers on

characters, specifically women exploring
femininity and lesbian identity.
I have to admit that I didn't get all the
jokes. I was one of maybe 10 men in a
packed house of women — many of them
with short hair and practical shoes — and I
felt sort of guilty for not understanding
some of the more obscure references to les
bians and how they basically have different
brain structures and all.
But that's a good thing. Queer drama is
about no longer stopping, apologizing and
explaining our sexuality to outsiders. Queer
drama is proud and unabashed and not
necessarily written so that our mothers
won't be embarrassed.
Mary's mother is one of the four women
portrayed in "Body," although she's the least
explored. She gets the best laugh line of the
show, however, when she talks of how she got
over her guilt for her daughter Lily being a
lesbian. Her guilt ended when Lily quipped:
"Why should you get all the credit?"
"Body" puts women in non-traditional
roles and professions — in addition to the
convenience-store robber, there's Lily the
private detective and Renee the paleontolo
gist. There's even a television screen when
you walk in that shows a movie about
women gladiators and knights.
The relationship between Lily and
Renee is hilariously explored. Renee is mar
ried, yet when she meets the openly lesbian
Lily on an airplane, she's intrigued and flirts
with her, and eventually the two go to a
hotel room together.
In a subsequent monologue, Renee
relates how the next day, in a grocery store,
all she noticed were the women there. She
made eye contact with everyone in the place
and the woman behind the check-out
counter even asked her if she wanted paper
or plastic in a "sexual" way.
True, Renee's tale is another coming-out
story, but in the context of "Body" it's defi
nitely queer drama. The characters in this play
deal with sexuality on their own terms, and
there isn't a single apology in the entire show.
And that's what queer drama is about. ■
