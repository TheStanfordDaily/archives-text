Bodies, Rest & Motion

What is it about the desert that inspires
disillusioned twentysomethings to such ex
tremes of inanity?
Watching this phenomenon played out
in "Bodies, Rest and Motion" is like listen
ing in on someone else's conversation at 3
a.m.: it's obvious that something profound
is taking place, but we're never allowed to be
a part of it.
Loosely based on Newton's First I,aw of
Motion, "Bodies" is best described as an
anti-road movie. Characters drive aimlessly,
stop frequently and always end up right back
where they started. As one says, "when you
don't know where you're going, you drive on
the highway."
Nick (Tim Roth) knows where he's going
— to Butte, Mont., "the city of the future."
Tired of playing grownup in suburban En

field, Ariz., Nick quits his Mcjob at an appli
ance store and tells girlfriend Beth (Bridget
Fonda) to start packing their bags.
"We're movin'," Nick tells Carol (Phoebe
Cates), the couple's mutual best friend and
nearest neighbor. Alone in Carol's shady liv
ing room, they remain perfectly still.
Meanwhile, Beth packs and chats with
the painter, Sid (Eric Stolz), who has osten
sibly arrived to paint the house for its new
tenants, but actually comes to rescue Beth
— and the movie — from terminal ni
hilism. Sid has lived in Enfield all his life —
and likes it.
"If you stay in one place long enough,
then luck knows where to find you," he
chirps.
Unlike the other characters in the movie,
Sid has a history. Unfortunately, we never see
it. Instead, we see him perform oral sex on
Beth. In his form-fitting white coveralls, Sid
is a smug ingenue — the worst kind. I le even
lisps.
But, for all his faults, it's utterly incon
ceivable that Sid would be drawn to a cranky

bitch like Beth. And, for two people who are
living together in the real world, Stolz and
Fonda make an astoundingly boring couple
onscreen.
If Sid represents Rest and Nick is Motion,
then Carol and Beth are the Bodies. Cates is
obviously here to look pretty, and Fonda, de
spite her character's world-weary, blue-col
lar domesticity, can't escape her real-life rep
as the Molly Ringwald of the '90s. We'd like
to believe that she really does eat donuts and
wear peasant blouses and plastic barrettes,
but we just can't.

For better and for worse, the movie itself
is mostly interested in Rest. Static and dis
jointed, "Bodies" often feels like an artful
slide show of someone's Grand Canyon va
cation. Roger Hedden's script was originally
produced as a play, and his monologues are
glaringly obvious onscreen. The effect is
compounded by director Michael Stein
berg's decision to shoot the entire film in
closeups, desert landscapes included.
Slow as it is, the film's hardly subtle. Beth
wraps appliances in newspapers with head
lines like "Misery index soars" and puts
them in boxes marked "Handle with care."
Nick has a meaningful and mystical en
counter with a Navajo gas-station attendant,
as well as at least one near-death experience.
Long, ominous shots of cacti and gather
ing clouds portend piquant epiphanies
ahead. Unfortunately, those insights never
arrive. It's the cinematic equivalent of being
stranded in the middle of nowhere with an
empty tank and four angst-ridden rabbits in
the passenger seat.
