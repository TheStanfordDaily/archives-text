Bruce Homsby sans
the Range introduces
jazzy sophomore EP

Bruce Hornsby

If the musical project of the Grateful Dead
was to meld country and blues, then Bruce
Hornsby and the Range aimed to find the
connections between country and jazz.
And ever since Hornsby's first album,
"The Way It Is," the group has been taking
the jazz up notch by notch in order to find
that blend. This time, with the Range gone
and people like Branford Marsalis and Pat
Metheny sitting in their place, Hornsby may
have gone too far.
"Harbor Lights" is rich in snazzy piano
playing and cool rhythms, as well as guest

artists; what it lacks is the Virginia twang that
made his early projects so catchy. Bonnie
Raitt's background vocals and Jerry Garcia's
guitar don't replace the Range's constant
Carolina presence.
Musically, the album reaches for a more
complex vision than Hornsby has attempted
on his other works, and, though the lyrics
lack the didactically charming quality he's
become known for, they work well enough.
Like most Hornsby albums, there's not a
bad track, and his fans are not going to be
disappointed by the album. For singing abil
ity and piano playing, this very well may be
Hornsby at his best.
The parts (voice, piano, guest accompani
ment) may be better, but without the Range,
the whole seems to fall short. As with the
overall sound, the songwriting seems to step
down a notch, both in imagery and clever
ness. After serving as writing partner for the
last three albums, Hornsby's brother, John,
plays a minimal role, only writing the not

overly-impressive lyrics to "What a Time."
Although the strength of the jazz makes
the album enjoyable, Hornsby should go
back a half-step on the country side and re
turn to the Range.

In its long history, Aerosmith has been at
best truly inspired, and at worst a good rau
cous time. Their new album, "Get a Grip,"
contains a bit of each.
A study in the band's established styles, it
