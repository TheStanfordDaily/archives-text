Bruce Homsby sans
the Range introduces
jazzy sophomore EP

Bruce Hornsby

If the musical project of the Grateful Dead
was to meld country and blues, then Bruce
Hornsby and the Range aimed to find the
connections between country and jazz.
And ever since Hornsby's first album,
"The Way It Is," the group has been taking
the jazz up notch by notch in order to find
that blend. This time, with the Range gone
and people like Branford Marsalis and Pat
Metheny sitting in their place, Hornsby may
have gone too far.
"Harbor Lights" is rich in snazzy piano
playing and cool rhythms, as well as guest

artists; what it lacks is the Virginia twang that
made his early projects so catchy. Bonnie
Raitt's background vocals and Jerry Garcia's
guitar don't replace the Range's constant
Carolina presence.
Musically, the album reaches for a more
complex vision than Hornsby has attempted
on his other works, and, though the lyrics
lack the didactically charming quality he's
become known for, they work well enough.
Like most Hornsby albums, there's not a
bad track, and his fans are not going to be
disappointed by the album. For singing abil
ity and piano playing, this very well may be
Hornsby at his best.
The parts (voice, piano, guest accompani
ment) may be better, but without the Range,
the whole seems to fall short. As with the
overall sound, the songwriting seems to step
down a notch, both in imagery and clever
ness. After serving as writing partner for the
last three albums, Hornsby's brother, John,
plays a minimal role, only writing the not

overly-impressive lyrics to "What a Time."
Although the strength of the jazz makes
the album enjoyable, Hornsby should go
back a half-step on the country side and re
turn to the Range.

Wild sex, social ills,
wild sex, lost loves,
even more wild sex

Aerosmith

In its long history, Aerosmith has been at
best truly inspired, and at worst a good rau
cous time. Their new album, "Get a Grip,"
contains a bit of each.
A study in the band's established styles, it
displays everything from lead singer Steven
Tyler's patented strident hyper-rap to his fa
miliar growl, as he addresses social ills
("Livin' on the Edge"), losses in love
("Cryin'," "Crazy") and wild sex ("Flesh,"
"Shut Up and Dance," "Gotta Love It").
All the band is as versatile as Tyler on the
new album. From hard-hitting rockers like
"Eat the Rich" to the tasteful ballad, "Amaz
ing," the five members demonstrate that they
are a consummate team. Joe Perry's guitar re
frain on "Livin' on the Edge" is almost as in
fectious as the riff from "Walk This Way,"
which is included in the "Intro" to the album.
On the more introspective songs, Perry
plays it relatively nice, saving his harder edge
for tracks such as the title, where the guitar
matches Tyler's wail.
"Get a Grip" contains evidence of the
band's celebrated return from drug-induced
oblivion, without risking any praise from the
PMRC. ("The buzz you be gettin' from
the/Crack don't last/I'd rather be O.D.in' on
the/Crack of her ass") So without losing
sight of their identity as a hard-rock band, or
their interest in hard living, Aerosmith does
make a couple of rather serious statements
on their own history, as well as on current
racial violence, in "Livin' on the Edge."
They pull off the thoughtful pieces with
out sounding pretentious, because the music
is solid, fast and vivid in both guitars and per
cussion. Every voice, from Tyler's vocals to
that of Tom Hamilton's bass, is distinct and
adds materially to the effect.
All of which makes it forgivable, if not
downright graceful, when Tyler's voice rises
above the well-orchestrated din, to deliver
tawdry double entendre and mixed metaphor.
("The prince of lust has met his match/The
witch has brewed her baddest batch/His sword
is sharp and hard as stone/Her cauldron begs
for one more bone")
"Get a Grip" offers a surprising range of
style and theme from Aerosmith, who
emerge with metallic power and sense of
humor intact.

Seattle-based band
creates girl-pop punk,
covers Bee Gees hits

Fastbacks

Before bassist Duff McKagan found the
sweet smell of success with Guns N' Roses, he
played drums for the Seattle-based Fast
backs. Now Duff's gone on to make millions,
while his former bandmates continue to plug
away recording for Sub Pop. Their latest re
lease, "Ziicker," won't propel them into star
dom, but it does include the tempting lure of
a cover of a Bee Gees tune.
The Fastbacks brand of girl-pop, filtered
through punk sensibilities, suits the sweet
moniker of the album title. Female vocalists
Lulu Gargiulo and Kim Warnick sing har
monies in voices reminiscent of children's
campfire songs and girl-led bands like the
Go-Go's. Combine this with a thumping beat
and fast guitars, and you've got the Fastbacks'
own special brand of pop music, without the
Seattle grunge.
Their music is short and sweet. Songs bare

ly last long enough to establish a beat, melody
and chorus before the next song starts.
Short song lengths allow the band to tran
scend pop genres relatively quickly, moving
from punk to more mellow tunes. In "All
About Nothing," the drums stop their bang
ing at the same time as the guitars restrain
themselves, switching gears to play in an un
derstated fashion.
But the tracks where the guitars have free
reign outshine their quieter companions.
Guitars thrash about, almost bordering on
heavy metal in "Bill Challenger." Only the in
nocent-sounding voices of Gargiulo and
Warnick prevent the song from becoming a
full-blown metal song.
Judging by the Fastbacks cover of "Please
Read Me," the threat of a Bee Gees revival looks
doubtful. Mostly sung in a rather flat manner,
the singer doesn't quite reach the same highs
for which the disco demigods were famed.

Warnick and Gargiulo also play bass and
guitar, respectively, while guitarist Kurt
Bloch rounds out the group. However, the
band still lacks a permanent drummer.
Maybe Duff will consider giving up his
position at GNR and return to playing with
his old bandmates. Yeah right. The odds of
his giving up fame, fortune and women for
virtual anonymity are about the same as the
odds he has of getting into Harvard Law
School (a desire he once expressed).
But the Fastbacks don't really need him.
They've proven that they can stand on their
own, eschewing the recently popularized
"Seattle sound" in order to make their own
simple charming pop songs.

Copacetic debut EP
adds a happy twist
to Brit-band sound

Velocity Girl

Being on Seattle's Sub Pop label is like re
ceiving the stamp of quality, kind of like the
musical equivalent to what U.S.D.A. Choice
means to meat. Velocity Girl's debut album
"Copacetic," meaning excellent or first-rate,
boasts their superior rating in the title.
Velocity Girl's music instantly recalls the
sound of other bands like My Bloody Valen
tine, rather than the group from whose song
they took their name, Primal Scream. How
ever, this Washington, D.C.-based band dis

tances itself from its British contemporaries
by offering more upbeat pop songs soaked in
a guitar haze.
The group's early fascination with MBV
leaves its mark on "A Chang." A guitar twangs
over the noise of a cloud of guitar distortion.
Stripped of the vocals, the song could easily
be mistaken for one of the British sound
makers, but lead singer Sarah Shannon's vo
cals sound too happy to belong to the Brits.
Yet, the biggest fault with the album lies in
the difficulty that Shannon has cutting her
voice through the music. When faced with
dissonance, one can either mutter indeci
pherable lyrics as in My Bloody Valentine, or
sing indecipherable lyrics as in Lush. Shan

non averts either path, choosing to sing her
lyrics in a clear manner with mixed results.
Trained in opera, her voice retains a pure
quality which strains to be heard amongst the
sound, like a bird flying past smog — sink or
swim. Sometimes her voice does the former,
other times the latter.
"Here Comes," a song without the big
guitar sound, allows Shannon's voice to soar
above the tinkling of guitars. The softer
music frees her from the restrictions that
noisier songs make on her voice. It's a
dreamy, mesmerizing piece that also shows
the band's versatility in music that lacks the
wall of noise.
So while the music may be a bit derivative,
Velocity Girl manages to add their own take
on the sound. A bright, cheery feeling infus
es the album, helping distinguish this quintet
from the rest of the pack.

Experimental song
collection stands up
to all critical scrutiny

Neil Young

Throughout the 1980's Neil Young re
leased a series of albums that left his fans con
fused and often disappointed.
Instead of the familiar acoustic-folk or
electric-hard-rock, these albums featured
various stylistic experimentations — rocka
billy, country, blues and synthesizer-driven
(including one album in which Young
recorded all his vocals through a synthesizer).
Now that Neil Young is back on the charts
with his more familiar music, "Lucky Thir
teen" provides the opportunity to reevaluate
the 1980s genre chameleon. This compila
tion of live tracks, remixes and album cuts
stands up surprisingly well to the scrutiny.
Two opening tracks, "Sample and Hold"
and "Transformer Man," are from the voice
synthesizer album, "Trans."
What could easily have sounded like dated
early-80's synth music actually turns out to
be a fascinating pair of songs about the search
for romance in a Blade Runner musical land
scape.
"Depression Blues," the best of the pure
country songs, is a poignantly beautiful tune
about a family struggling through hard times.
The album's only shortcoming is that the
genre cuts (blues, country, rockabilly) tend to
sound a bit derivative.
Nevertheless, Young's always passionate
performances raise the songs above the or
dinary.

genre cuts (blues, country, rockabilly) tend to

Nevertheless, Young's always passionate
performances raise the songs above the or

Bruce Homsby sans
the Range introduces
jazzy sophomore EP

Bruce Hornsby

If the musical project of the Grateful Dead
was to meld country and blues, then Bruce
Hornsby and the Range aimed to find the
connections between country and jazz.
And ever since Hornsby's first album,
"The Way It Is," the group has been taking
the jazz up notch by notch in order to find
that blend. This time, with the Range gone
and people like Branford Marsalis and Pat
Metheny sitting in their place, Hornsby may
have gone too far.
"Harbor Lights" is rich in snazzy piano
playing and cool rhythms, as well as guest

artists; what it lacks is the Virginia twang that
made his early projects so catchy. Bonnie
Raitt's background vocals and Jerry Garcia's
guitar don't replace the Range's constant
Carolina presence.
Musically, the album reaches for a more
complex vision than Hornsby has attempted
on his other works, and, though the lyrics
lack the didactically charming quality he's
become known for, they work well enough.
Like most Hornsby albums, there's not a
bad track, and his fans are not going to be
disappointed by the album. For singing abil
ity and piano playing, this very well may be
Hornsby at his best.
The parts (voice, piano, guest accompani
ment) may be better, but without the Range,
the whole seems to fall short. As with the
overall sound, the songwriting seems to step
down a notch, both in imagery and clever
ness. After serving as writing partner for the
last three albums, Hornsby's brother, John,
plays a minimal role, only writing the not

overly-impressive lyrics to "What a Time."
Although the strength of the jazz makes
the album enjoyable, Hornsby should go
back a half-step on the country side and re
turn to the Range.

Wild sex, social ills,
wild sex, lost loves,
even more wild sex

Aerosmith

In its long history, Aerosmith has been at
best truly inspired, and at worst a good rau
cous time. Their new album, "Get a Grip,"
contains a bit of each.
A study in the band's established styles, it
displays everything from lead singer Steven
Tyler's patented strident hyper-rap to his fa
miliar growl, as he addresses social ills
("Livin' on the Edge"), losses in love
("Cryin'," "Crazy") and wild sex ("Flesh,"
"Shut Up and Dance," "Gotta Love It").
All the band is as versatile as Tyler on the
new album. From hard-hitting rockers like
"Eat the Rich" to the tasteful ballad, "Amaz
ing," the five members demonstrate that they
are a consummate team. Joe Perry's guitar re
frain on "Livin' on the Edge" is almost as in
fectious as the riff from "Walk This Way,"
which is included in the "Intro" to the album.
On the more introspective songs, Perry
plays it relatively nice, saving his harder edge
for tracks such as the title, where the guitar
matches Tyler's wail.
"Get a Grip" contains evidence of the
band's celebrated return from drug-induced
oblivion, without risking any praise from the
PMRC. ("The buzz you be gettin' from
the/Crack don't last/I'd rather be O.D.in' on
the/Crack of her ass") So without losing
sight of their identity as a hard-rock band, or
their interest in hard living, Aerosmith does
make a couple of rather serious statements
on their own history, as well as on current
racial violence, in "Livin' on the Edge."
They pull off the thoughtful pieces with
out sounding pretentious, because the music
is solid, fast and vivid in both guitars and per
cussion. Every voice, from Tyler's vocals to
that of Tom Hamilton's bass, is distinct and
adds materially to the effect.
All of which makes it forgivable, if not
downright graceful, when Tyler's voice rises
above the well-orchestrated din, to deliver
tawdry double entendre and mixed metaphor.
("The prince of lust has met his match/The
witch has brewed her baddest batch/His sword
is sharp and hard as stone/Her cauldron begs
for one more bone")
"Get a Grip" offers a surprising range of
style and theme from Aerosmith, who
emerge with metallic power and sense of
humor intact.

Seattle-based band
creates girl-pop punk,
covers Bee Gees hits

Fastbacks

Before bassist Duff McKagan found the
sweet smell of success with Guns N' Roses, he
played drums for the Seattle-based Fast
backs. Now Duff's gone on to make millions,
while his former bandmates continue to plug
away recording for Sub Pop. Their latest re
lease, "Ziicker," won't propel them into star
dom, but it does include the tempting lure of
a cover of a Bee Gees tune.
The Fastbacks brand of girl-pop, filtered
through punk sensibilities, suits the sweet
moniker of the album title. Female vocalists
Lulu Gargiulo and Kim Warnick sing har
monies in voices reminiscent of children's
campfire songs and girl-led bands like the
Go-Go's. Combine this with a thumping beat
and fast guitars, and you've got the Fastbacks'
own special brand of pop music, without the
Seattle grunge.
Their music is short and sweet. Songs bare

ly last long enough to establish a beat, melody
and chorus before the next song starts.
Short song lengths allow the band to tran
scend pop genres relatively quickly, moving
from punk to more mellow tunes. In "All
About Nothing," the drums stop their bang
ing at the same time as the guitars restrain
themselves, switching gears to play in an un
derstated fashion.
But the tracks where the guitars have free
reign outshine their quieter companions.
Guitars thrash about, almost bordering on
heavy metal in "Bill Challenger." Only the in
nocent-sounding voices of Gargiulo and
Warnick prevent the song from becoming a
full-blown metal song.
Judging by the Fastbacks cover of "Please
Read Me," the threat of a Bee Gees revival looks
doubtful. Mostly sung in a rather flat manner,
the singer doesn't quite reach the same highs
for which the disco demigods were famed.

Warnick and Gargiulo also play bass and
guitar, respectively, while guitarist Kurt
Bloch rounds out the group. However, the
band still lacks a permanent drummer.
Maybe Duff will consider giving up his
position at GNR and return to playing with
his old bandmates. Yeah right. The odds of
his giving up fame, fortune and women for
virtual anonymity are about the same as the
odds he has of getting into Harvard Law
School (a desire he once expressed).
But the Fastbacks don't really need him.
They've proven that they can stand on their
own, eschewing the recently popularized
"Seattle sound" in order to make their own
simple charming pop songs.

Copacetic debut EP
adds a happy twist
to Brit-band sound

Velocity Girl

Being on Seattle's Sub Pop label is like re
ceiving the stamp of quality, kind of like the
musical equivalent to what U.S.D.A. Choice
means to meat. Velocity Girl's debut album
"Copacetic," meaning excellent or first-rate,
boasts their superior rating in the title.
Velocity Girl's music instantly recalls the
sound of other bands like My Bloody Valen
tine, rather than the group from whose song
they took their name, Primal Scream. How
ever, this Washington, D.C.-based band dis

tances itself from its British contemporaries
by offering more upbeat pop songs soaked in
a guitar haze.
The group's early fascination with MBV
leaves its mark on "A Chang." A guitar twangs
over the noise of a cloud of guitar distortion.
Stripped of the vocals, the song could easily
be mistaken for one of the British sound
makers, but lead singer Sarah Shannon's vo
cals sound too happy to belong to the Brits.
Yet, the biggest fault with the album lies in
the difficulty that Shannon has cutting her
voice through the music. When faced with
dissonance, one can either mutter indeci
pherable lyrics as in My Bloody Valentine, or
sing indecipherable lyrics as in Lush. Shan

non averts either path, choosing to sing her
lyrics in a clear manner with mixed results.
Trained in opera, her voice retains a pure
quality which strains to be heard amongst the
sound, like a bird flying past smog — sink or
swim. Sometimes her voice does the former,
other times the latter.
"Here Comes," a song without the big
guitar sound, allows Shannon's voice to soar
above the tinkling of guitars. The softer
music frees her from the restrictions that
noisier songs make on her voice. It's a
dreamy, mesmerizing piece that also shows
the band's versatility in music that lacks the
wall of noise.
So while the music may be a bit derivative,
Velocity Girl manages to add their own take
on the sound. A bright, cheery feeling infus
es the album, helping distinguish this quintet
from the rest of the pack.

Experimental song
collection stands up
to all critical scrutiny

Neil Young

Throughout the 1980's Neil Young re
leased a series of albums that left his fans con
fused and often disappointed.
Instead of the familiar acoustic-folk or
electric-hard-rock, these albums featured
various stylistic experimentations — rocka
billy, country, blues and synthesizer-driven
(including one album in which Young
recorded all his vocals through a synthesizer).
Now that Neil Young is back on the charts
with his more familiar music, "Lucky Thir
teen" provides the opportunity to reevaluate
the 1980s genre chameleon. This compila
tion of live tracks, remixes and album cuts
stands up surprisingly well to the scrutiny.
Two opening tracks, "Sample and Hold"
and "Transformer Man," are from the voice
synthesizer album, "Trans."
What could easily have sounded like dated
early-80's synth music actually turns out to
be a fascinating pair of songs about the search
for romance in a Blade Runner musical land
scape.
"Depression Blues," the best of the pure
country songs, is a poignantly beautiful tune
about a family struggling through hard times.
The album's only shortcoming is that the
genre cuts (blues, country, rockabilly) tend to
sound a bit derivative.
Nevertheless, Young's always passionate
performances raise the songs above the or
dinary.

teen" provides the opportunity to reevaluate
the 1980s genre chameleon. This compila
tion of live tracks, remixes and album cuts
stands up surprisingly well to the scrutiny.
Two opening tracks, "Sample and Hold"
and "Transformer Man," are from the voice
synthesizer album, "Trans."
What could easily have sounded like dated
early-80's synth music actually turns out to
be a fascinating pair of songs about the search
for romance in a Blade Runner musical land
scape.
"Depression Blues," the best of the pure
country songs, is a poignantly beautiful tune
about a family struggling through hard times.
The album's only shortcoming is that the
genre cuts (blues, country, rockabilly) tend to
sound a bit derivative.
Nevertheless, Young's always passionate
performances raise the songs above the or
dinary.
