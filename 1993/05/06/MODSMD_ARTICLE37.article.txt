Any migration, whether involving wilde
beest, herons or student dancers, is opti
mally undertaken with drive, stamina
and a sense of direction. The Stanford Dance
Division's annual "Spring Migration" offers
students the opportunity to charge and soar
with these virtues — and, through the expe
rience, arrive at a better place.
Presented in Roble dance studio on two
consecutive weekends, May 7 through 8 and
14 through 15, "Spring Migration" will
showcase student-choreographed dances, as
well as some done by the dance faculty.
For some participants, this will be an op
portunity to experiment with their evolving
choreographic voices, or to be vessels for an
other's movement ideas. Others will be danc
ing before an audience for the first time, ap
plying their classroom training to the con
centrated, ensemble process of pulling to
gether and executing a dance.
The "Spring Migration" tradition origi

nated in 1979 as
a means of in
viting dance di
vision alumni
back to campus
to share a con
cert bill with
graduate and
undergraduate
modern dance
students. The

C r ,ih f Mitntbi,'

enterprise
proved to be a
vital and stimulating exchange among the
different "generations" involved.
More recent "Migrations" have tended to
exclusively feature the current crop of dance
students — hence the original show title has
necessarily undergone reinterpretation.
" 'Migration' used to mean people migrat
ing from far away to make a concert. Now,
people migrate their interests into the con
cert," explains Tony Morris-Kramer, senior

lecturer in dance and "Spring Migration" 's
production director.
As always, the theme will be variety. First
year medical student Pauline Terebuh
will present a short, zany trio piece enti
tled "Next Door" three times before the con
cert begins and twice during intermission in
Studio 42 (which adjoins Roble Dance Stu
dio). She is partnered by two men, one of
whom has had no dance training at all; the
other has one quarter of dance instruction to
his credit.
"Next Door" employs gymnastic rings
and an unconventional set piece, both of
which will be acrobatically manipulated by
the dancers. "It's one of the strongest pieces
movement-wise," says Morris-Kramer.
"[The dancers'] interactions are so well mo
tivated, so clearly done, that the fact that [the
men] don't have technique doesn't matter."
Although the dance division attracts and
nurtures serious dance students, those with
recreational interests are also heavily repre

sented in curriculum classes. According to
Morris-Kramer, many of the beginners go on
to develop a passion for dance.
Lea Wolf, a '92 graduate who was commis
sioned by the dance division to choreograph
a student piece for the occasion, reveals her
work's humorous angle in the title, "Those
Girls Who Dream of Rock N' Roll." Wolf re
ceived a Dean's Award last year for her under
graduate thesis, "The Evolution of the Fe
male Persona in Dance: Three Cases," and is
now dancing professionally with San Fran
cisco's Delia Davidson Dance Company.

Diane Frank, a member of the dance-divi
sion faculty, has created a quartet entitled "A
Branch from Bright Orchard," which is rooted
in the style of Merce Cunningham — one of

the most
promi
nent, in
fluential
artists of
modern
dance —
in whose

New York school Frank taught for 10 years.
Cunninghams movement is typically e
lastic and precise, his composition objective
ly abstract and spacially adventurous. "It's a
really great opportunity for modern students
to use their modern technique," says Morris-
Kramer.
Frank's Cunningham-based teaching
challenges her modern dance students to de
velop the control, speed and almost balletic
agility that characterize aspects of the tech
nique. Those invited to perform "Bright Or
chard" have doubtlessly worked hard to earn

the requisite technical competency.
Morris- Kramer is contributing "3 Ma
nias," a solo to saxophone jazz music
by Coleman Hawkins. Senior Heather
Hei-berger will perform the dance against a
video projection of an abstract painting by
Elizabeth Reid Maruska (whose artwork is
currently on exhibit in the upstairs Tresidder
lobby).
"3 Manias," which emphasizes strong
body lines, premiered in a March dance con
cert at the Mountain View Center for the Per
forming Arts.
A Master's candidate in dance education,
Stephanie Schaaf has tailored a three-part
piece to the four dancers with whom she
chose to work, aptly naming it "Four People."
Morris-Kramer describes it as a "finely
wrought, clear, beautiful" suite of dances.
Rounding out the collection of offerings is
a delicate fusion of modern dance and jazz
("IcARUS"), a piece about addiction using
music by Peter Gabriel and Miles Davis, along
with a powerfully synchronous jazz number.
To the uninformed, a Roble dance studio
performance might sound like a stark, claus
trophobic affair. Not so.
Roble dance studio, "Spring Migration" 's
regular site, has over the years been trans
formed into a fully functional performance
space, primarily through the acquisition of
theatrical lighting equipment and hidden in
stallation of stage cabling.
Dramatic interior space, with its soaring
ceiling and colossal windows spanning two
walls, accommodates an audience of 200 in
downstairs and balcony seating — yet still
retains the intimacy that decades of Stanford
dancers have valued. ■

"Spring Migration" will be presented May
7,8,14 and 15 at 8:30 p.m. in Roble dance stu
dio. Tickets are $5 for students and seniors, $7
general.
