# Toontown: Not just for kids
## 
### Michael G. Nichols 
Stanford has long been called the Dis
neyland of the North. Fun and sun all
day long. But which ride to go on first?
Let's see, SLAC... er, Space Mountain, then
Jasper Ridge... Thunder Mountain, and fi
nally EBF — Alice in Wonderland.
As good as these $25, 000-a-year rides
may be, at times we long for the real thing. So
this spring break I took my main squeeze to
Disneyland. And I got more than I expected
for my $29. There's now a new land to that
five-star childhood vacationing spot — and
it's like nothing you've ever seen before.
Strolling past the Matterhorn we start to
hear it. Countless sounds creep out from its

gates: giddy squeals of excited children ac
companied by big-band music and merry
melodies all blend to create a symphony of
101 Saturday morning cartoon scores.
Then we catch our first glimpse of it: a sea
of Crayola colors, brightly shimmering in
the noonday Anaheim sun. Strangely shaped
buildings with sagging bricks and tilted roofs
lie in all directions. Huge cartoon-like oak
trees, with giant Cheshire cat grins, branch
out across the town square.
And across the leaning skyline of slouch
ing pastel roofs and dancing Disney sculp
tures lies a rolling mountain range of forest
green, lava-textured hills, sporting a Holly

woodesque sign which crowns its name.
Welcome to the newest corner of Dis
neyland. Welcome to Mickey's Toon

town.
We experience total sensory
overload as we walk in. A lamp

post to our left loops in a cir
cle instead of standing up

straight. To the right, the
Beast, at seven feet tall no "Beau

ty" himself, lumbers forward, hold
ing out his enormous paw. And the

window of the gym in front of us is miss

ing part of its glass. But instead of being bro
ken into jagged shards, it perfectly outlines a
weightlifter's barbell — and a 10,000 pound
weight is half-sunk into the sidewalk below.
Face it. We're no longer in the world as we
know it. Straight lines don't exist here. The
buildings look like giant JELL-O molds,

puffed out at the sides and tilted at the top.
The cobblestone path wanders and zig-zags
right back to where it started.
Toontown's strangeness makes us uneasy,
but everyone under four feet tall is having a
great time. A small, curly-haired boy dressed
in a broadly striped shirt bolts past us. He
skids to a stop, looks around and spies a large
red TNT box. He zips over to it, pulls up the
t-bar, and gives it his best shot. Roman can
dles go off in all directions, blinding lights

flash and clouds of smoke spill out of
Mickey's Fireworks Factory. Our pro

tagonist jumps up and down. Pure
ecstasy.

Next, the little terror rushes
over to a pile ofboxes. Laugh
ing to himself, he grabs the

handle on the one marked "De

liver to: Thunder Mountain" and
yanks it open. The sound of a speeding

/ "I 1 O
steam train barks out at him, causing him

to leap back and lose his Mickey Mouse ears.

He scrambles after them, dusts off the seat ofhis
shorts and runs off to Goof/s Bounce House —
a small cottage packed with squishy, air-filled
furniture.
This kid seems to know what's up, so we
follow him, hoping that he'll be our personal

unpaid tour guide. But we're
stopped short on our way
into Goofys—the sign reads:
"You must be at least this
short to go on this ride!" Even
without our shoes, we're still
over four-foot-five. Denied.
As the day moves on, we
slowly realize that the normal
correlation between cause
and effect doesn't hold up
here. Pressing the doorbell to
the firehouse sets off the fire
alarm. Jolly brass bands, rau
cous roars and strange sound
effects bleed out of every cor
ner. Loony laughter, banging
bells and grinding gear noises
float out of buildings, mail
boxes and fishbowls. If it's
there, it's got a sound. And
before we know it, we've
spent half the day looking and
listening without going inside
any of the attractions or rid
ing "Gadget's Go Coaster."
The time has come to brave
the world's shortest roller
coaster. It's so short, in fact,

that the line of patient Disneyland patrons is
longer then the track of the ride. Ironically, its
supposed to be on a large scale — the cars are
large acorns powered by a giant bottle cap gears.
But that's just par for the course — in
Toontown, nothing is what it seems. Nada.
Zilch. Zippo. Not the buildings, not the
trees, not the paths, not even the railings
along the paths. Lining the trail leading to
the Go Coaster are a giant toothbrush held
up by matches, an enormous red comb and
an oversized pencil supported by twisting
rubber bands and paper clips.
There are so many bizarre elements to this
place that we could never notice them all.
Consequently, we don't even see most of the
surprises until we're right on top of them. It's
sort of like the rollercoaster. At 30 seconds
from start to finish, we practically didn't
even notice it until it was over. But that
doesn't mean it wasn't worth it.
Going to Disneyland brings back every
one's carefree days of childhood, but the
park's latest addition bridges the gap be
tween reminiscence and reality. Toontown is
a bizarre reversal of roles that puts the
youngest prince on a throne for a day. But
even if you're taller then most water foun
tains, you'll still feel like a king. ■
