Queer drama isn't limited to the stage — movies can be
queer too. So if you can't get to the city to see the queer
plays in our cover story, here's Phyllis Schlafly's list of
the Top Three Movies To Show At A Fundraiser.
When England's resident bad-boy filmmaker, Derek Jarman,
decided to adapt a classic British play, he bypassed Shakespeare
in favor of Christopher Marlowe's Edward 11. A tragic tale of lust
and avarice, the story centers on Edward, whose ascension to the
throne is brutally halted because he has a male lover. Jarman con
temporizes certain elements of the play, but retains its 16th-cen
tury setting, showing the eternal persistence of homophobia.
American videomaker Tom Kalin made an impressive '92
debut with Swoon. The film explores the murder of a child
committed by two upperclass gay Jewish men. The two avoid
ed execution because their lawyer argued that their homosexu
ality was proof of their insanity. Kalin refutes this in an
anachronistic, beautifully photographed, black-and-white
recreation of the murder and the subsequent trial.
Todd Haynes got the NEA into hot water with Poison,
which interweaves three separate stories with common
themes. The first, "Hero," takes a pseudo-documentary look at
the family, friends and community of an abused child who
"flew away." "Horror," shot like a '50s B-movie, focuses on a
scientist who distills the human sex drive — only to be turned
into a monster when he drinks it. Finally, "Homo," based on a
short story by Jean Genet, examines the the lust one man feels
for an old acquaintance in prison. Audacious, funny and ulti
mately, moving. ■
