No, Jane's Addiction hasn't potten back
together. Yes, you've heard Perry Ferrell in
heavy rotation on Live 105 lately, but he's
singing for a new band (sort of), Porno for
Pyros.
If you miss Jane's, go see Porno for Pyros
at the Warfield Friday and Saturday, May 28
and 29.
The opening band, Flaming Lips, kicks
off the shows (both of which begin at 9
p.m.), and general admission tickets maybe
purchased for $17.50 at either the Warfield
box office on the night of the show or any
time at the nearest BASS outlet.
