# The

One-third of women rarely or never have
orgasm during sex. This the latest from Mon
day's authoritative study—sponsored by the
Einsteins at "Mademoiselle" and "Details" —
which paints a dismal picture for the twen
tysomething and almost-20 generation.
Get this: a whopping 63 percent of the
men said they have sex less frequently (read:
less than 24 hours a day) and 43 percent said

they were dissatisfied with their sexual activ
ity (read: why can't my life mimic Mickey
Rourke's?).
My theory is that the first statistic ex
plains all the other data. If 33 percent of the
women would rather do laundry or vacuum
their car than have sex, then it seems clear
that more men will be scratching their heads
wondering, "Why's she got so much laundry
lately? And hey, why she vacuuming her car
again?"

So if we assume that most 20-year-old
women haven't been stricken by some sort of
orgasmic-disease pathology, this sobering
statistic may simply show that one-third of
you men feel like a fine-tuned performance
machine, but putt-putt along like a Yugo, if
ya catch my drift. I will close with Musashi:
these things must be considered deeply.
