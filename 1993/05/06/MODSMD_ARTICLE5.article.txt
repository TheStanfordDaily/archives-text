# Diversity in danger
## Experts discuss Endangered Species Species Act, recommend enforcement 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Five men gathered last night to
discuss the fate of 4,000 species.
Specifically at issue was the fu
ture of a potentially endangered
law — the Endangered Species Act
— which is up for reauthorization
this year, two decades after its
passage. The panel of two lawyers
and three scientists who work to
protect endangered species told a
crowd of about 80 in Fairchild Au
ditorium that the act was funda
mentally sound, but requires
stricter enforcement to be effec
tive.
"We're at a very special hinge of
history now in the United States
. . . where after 20 years the En
dangered Species Act is up for
reevaluation," said Biology Prof.
Paul Ehrlich, moderator of the de
bate. "There is essentially no issue
in the human predicament more
important that biodiversity,"
which the act is meant to preserve,
Ehrlich said.
More important than individu
ally saving species, however, is
saving ecosystems, according to
Mark Shaffer, vice president of
science for the Wilderness Society.

Shaffer said the original intent of
the act was to protect ecosystems
— which would hopefully keep
species from ever becoming en
dangered — but that the govern
ment, particularly under Presi
dents Reagan and Bush, has not
supported the act enough to carry
out this goal.
"The tenor of the government
at that time was really to trivialize
the environment," he said.
"We've dug ourselves a hole
with endangered species because
the government hasn't taken it se
riously," Shaffer continued.
"We've got about 4,000 species in
trouble in this country. . . . We're
not talking about one or two or
three things."
Victor Sher, a graduate of the
Law School who has worked with
the Sierra Club to help protect the
spotted owl's habitat in Oregon
and Washington, also stressed the
need for the government to pre
vent environmental emergencies
before they happen. Laws like the
Endangered Species Act should
only be used as "a safety net of last
choice," he added.
