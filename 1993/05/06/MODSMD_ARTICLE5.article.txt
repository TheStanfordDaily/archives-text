# Diversity in danger
## Experts discuss Endangered Species Species Act, recommend enforcement 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Five men gathered last night to
discuss the fate of 4,000 species.
Specifically at issue was the fu
ture of a potentially endangered
law — the Endangered Species Act
— which is up for reauthorization
this year, two decades after its
passage. The panel of two lawyers
and three scientists who work to
protect endangered species told a
crowd of about 80 in Fairchild Au
ditorium that the act was funda
mentally sound, but requires
stricter enforcement to be effec
tive.
"We're at a very special hinge of
history now in the United States
. . . where after 20 years the En
dangered Species Act is up for
reevaluation," said Biology Prof.
Paul Ehrlich, moderator of the de
bate. "There is essentially no issue
in the human predicament more
important that biodiversity,"
which the act is meant to preserve,
Ehrlich said.
More important than individu
ally saving species, however, is
saving ecosystems, according to
Mark Shaffer, vice president of
science for the Wilderness Society.

Shaffer said the original intent of
the act was to protect ecosystems
— which would hopefully keep
species from ever becoming en
dangered — but that the govern
ment, particularly under Presi
dents Reagan and Bush, has not
supported the act enough to carry
out this goal.
"The tenor of the government
at that time was really to trivialize
the environment," he said.
"We've dug ourselves a hole
with endangered species because
the government hasn't taken it se
riously," Shaffer continued.
"We've got about 4,000 species in
trouble in this country. . . . We're
not talking about one or two or
three things."
Victor Sher, a graduate of the
Law School who has worked with
the Sierra Club to help protect the
spotted owl's habitat in Oregon
and Washington, also stressed the
need for the government to pre
vent environmental emergencies
before they happen. Laws like the
Endangered Species Act should
only be used as "a safety net of last
choice," he added.
Shaffer said more resources
need to be pledged to biodiversity
if the United States wants to
avert the extinction of more
species.
Robert Thornton, a lawyer
who worked on the 1978 amend
ments to the act, agreed.
"There's nothing wrong with
the act that a few $100 million
wouldn't help," he said.
Panelists dismissed as

unfounded critics' fear that pro
tecting the environment means
losing jobs, and said it was not a
reason to make environmental
legislation more lenient.
"It's false to set it up as a case
of jobs versus the owl or jobs
versus the environment," Sher
said.
"The conflict in the North
west has never been the owl ver
sus jobs, it's always been jobs
versus jobs," he continued. In
other words, people in short
term lumber industry jobs are
battling people in longer-term

jobs who rely on the environ
ment, such as fishermen, Sher
said.
Overall, the panelists said envi
ronmental legislation like the
Endangered Species Act is neces
sary, but perhaps more important
is a willingness from the govern
ment to vehemently enforce such
legislation. And Sher said he had
"guarded hope, guarded opti
mism" that the Clinton adminis
tration will follow through on its
environmentalist image and
increase the government's com
mitment to biodiversity.
