# Stanford graduate to be among first female combat pilots
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
When Stanford alumna Jeannie
Flynn, a second lieutenant in the Air
Force, graduated first in her pilot-train
ing class this January, she hoped to fly a
F-15E Strike Eagle, an advanced fighter
plane.
However, because Flynn is female, she
had little choice but to abandon her com
bat aspirations and begin instructor
pilot training.
But that training was brought to an
early halt by last week's Pentagon direc
tive that the Air Force, as well as the

Army, Navy and Marine Corps, must
allow women to fly combat aircraft.
Now, Flynn, who received her mas
ter's in aeronautics and astronautics
from Stanford in December 1991, could
become the Air Force's first female com
bat pilot.
The 26-year-old aviator is one of only
seven women heading for a special com
bat-training course that will begin in
July. When she completes the course,
Flynn will be stationed at one of three F
-15 bases, flying a supersonic plane with
both air-to-ground and air-to-air combat
capabilities.
"This was something I wanted. I

hoped it would change. I just didn't ex
pect it to change so quickly," she said. "I
expected it in a few years because things
were changing in the military, but the
timing surprised me."
Flynn said she appreciates the oppor
tunity to train for combat aircraft.
"I really take this one assignment at a
time. I was training to be an instructor
pilot and I was training as hard as I
could," she said. "Now I'm just going to
train as hard as I can to be the best fight
er pilot I can."
Flynn said she anticipates some added
pressure from those who are skeptical of
a woman's ability to fly combat missions.

"Some people who may have resent
ment will be watching us," she said. "I
know I'm going to be watched really
closely, but I'm going to ignore it because
thc> training is hard enough without the
added pressure.
"As for the standards for flying com
ba.t, every type of training sets standards
and as long as the standards are the same
for men and women, everything should
bo fine," Flynn said.
However, she remains optimistic that
many male pilots will be accepting of her
new role. "I think any of the male pilots
who have flown with women will be fine
flying with us in combat," she said.

Becoming a pilot, and now a fighter
pilot, are dreams Flynn said she was able
to fulfill after graduating from the Re
serve Officers Training Corps program at
the University of Texas at Austin.
"I was always interested in flying and
I went through the ROTC . . . knowing I
would be a pilot," she said. "I never flew
until I was 18, but I'd always been inter
ested in planes."
But it was during her pilot training at
Moody Air Force base in Georgia, that
Flynn found her true inspiration.
"I got like five rides in the back of an F-
16 and then I just knew I wanted
to fly combat," she said.
Despite her desire to fly com
bat aircraft, Flynn said she is not
looking forward to her first bat
tle.
"I think anyone in the military
doesn't want to go to war because
we are the ones actually over
there getting shot at," she said.
"We train for it and prepare for it,

but we don't want to do it."
Although flying combat is dan
gerous, Flynn said that is not a
good reason for keeping women
out of the cockpit.
"I personally would rather be
on the front lines dropping the
bombs than in supporting roles,"
she said. "It's just my personality.
"They say 'now women can get
shot at,' but women were always
shot at. They were killed in
Desert Storm. They were miss
ing-in-action," Flynn said. "The
only difference is now we can
shoot back."
