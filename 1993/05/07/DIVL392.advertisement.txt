APPEAL AGAINST INTERVENTION
An Open Letter to President Clinton
It may be satisfying from inside the Beltway to demand a quick fix by bombers. For
those of us who live and work in the Balkans, things look a little different. We know
that a bombing of the Serbians will let loose a sea of blood in which southeastern
Europe will drown.
- Misha Glenny, award-winning BBC correspondent in former
Yugoslavia, New York Times, April 29, 1993.
We, the undersigned members of the faculty and staff of Stanford University, are
deeply troubled at the possibility that the United States may intervene militar
ily in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
What vital national interest is at stake? What is the objective of the proposed military
mission? How would it be achieved? For all their talk, the advocates of intervention have
yet to provide convincing answers to any of the most basic questions.
They most frequently cite a moral obligation to stop the slaughter. But far from bringing
peace to Bosnia or preventing the spread of war, the options you reportedly favor —
conducting air strikes and arming combatants — are likely, to increase the level of vio
lence, harden positions and encourage extremists on all sides, and precipitate a wider
and even more intractable conflict, in which the United States will have become directly
entangled.
Like you, we are appalled at the practice of ethnic cleansing, at the suffering of inno
cents, and at atrocities committed by Bosnian Serb forces, the target of our proposed
intervention. At the same time, the plight of over half a million Serb refugees and scenes
of recent Croat-Muslim fighting in central Bosnia remind us that no side has a monopoly
on either atrocities or suffering in this war.
There is no alternative to a political settlement among the parties to the conflict. No last
ing solution can be imposed from outside, in Bosnia or in similar ethnic conflicts around
the world.
Mr. President, do not be swayed by claims that opposition to military intervention
implies indifference, cowardice or appeasement. The choice is not between "doing noth
ing" and dropping bombs. The U.S. should actively engage in diplomatic efforts aimed
at bringing the parties together to negotiate a just and lasting peace, and at preventing
the outbreak of hostilities in regions such as Macedonia and Kosovo. We support
American leadership in providing civilian relief. And our opposition to military inter
vention does not extend to precluding U.S. participation in international peacekeeping
efforts after the actual conclusion of hostilities.
But any sober assessment of the causes and conduct of the Bosnian conflict will show
that it is neither in our interest nor in the interest of the suffering people of the region to
take sides or involve American forces in this ongoing civil war.
The Bosnian war is a terrible nationalist civil war, among ethnic cousins, for
land, minority rights and political control... The end to killing can come only through
a political settlement. That cannot be brought about by foreign bombs, foreign arms or
foreign presidents — just Bosnians, all kinds.
