Two post office rampages
(AP) â€” A fired postal worker wearing
a "Psycho" t-shirt walked into a Califor
nia post office and fatally shot a letter
carrier yesterday, hours after a disgrun
tled employee opened fire in a Postal Ser
vice garage in Michigan, killing one per
son, authorities said. The Michigan gun
man later killed himself.
Several hours after the California
shooting, a woman believed to be a rela
tive of the gunman and a dog were found
slain in a home.
The postal worker in Dearborn, Mich.,
was apparently upset that a female co
worker had gotten a job he wanted. He
was armed with at least two guns when
he began shooting up the garage.
Four hours later, a fired postal
employee calmly walked into a post office
in Dana Point, an exclusive seaside com
munity southeast of Los Angeles, and
shot two workers, killing one.
Health plan delayed
WASHINGTON (AP) - Long-term
care for the elderly likely will have to be
phased in under the Clinton administra
tion's health-care reform package, Hillary
Rodham Clinton acknowledged yesterday.
Meanwhile, White House officials said
it might be mid-June before the overall
health-care plan is submitted to Congress,
a delay Mrs. Clinton said the president

might need in order to garner support.
Postponing the health-care plan
from May until mid-June has been rec
ommended by Democratic congression
al leaders as recently as Wednesday,
and even by Clinton's own budget
director. They argue the postponement
would give Congress time to vote on
Clinton's mammoth deficit-reduction
bill first.
Mrs. Clinton, who heads the presi
dent's task force on health care, said that
the White House reform package would
seek to cover long-term care, with an
emphasis on home-based and community
care that would keep the elderly self-suf
ficient and independent as long as possi
ble.
$34 billion more for S&Ls
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
Banking Committee yesterday approved
what it hopes is the final funding needed
to clean up the savings and loan disaster.
The price tag: $34 billion.
If approved by Congress, it would
push the total of all money spent or
promised on S&Ls since 1988 to more
than $190 billion.
The money in the committee's bill
would pay for the final work of the Reso
lution Trust Corporation and would pro
vide initial capital for a new fund that
would insure deposits.
