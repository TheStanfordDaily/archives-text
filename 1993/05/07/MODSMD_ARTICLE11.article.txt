## Clinton urges European allies to consider military action

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Yugoslavia, the main backer of
Bosnian Serb fighters, said yesterday it
would sever all aid to the fighters
except food and medicine.
If implemented, the embargo could
deprive the rebels of their main source
of fuel, weapons and ammunition, leav
ing them virtually isolated in their
yearlong fight against Bosnia's Mus
lims and Croats.
Belgrade's move — the strongest
action yet in its recent turn away from
the Bosnian Serbs — came hours after
the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament
defied pleas by Serbian President Slo
bodan Milosevic and other Yugoslav
leaders to accept a U.N. peace plan to
end the war.
In Washington, President Clinton,
pressing for military action, con
demned the assembly's decision and
urged reluctant allies yesterday to
"act quickly and decisively" with the
United States against Serb forces in
Bosnia after their rejection of the
peace plan.
"America has made its position clear
and is ready to do its part," Clinton
said. "But Europe must be willing to
act with us. We must go forward
together."
Yet Secretary of State Warren
Christopher was unable to report much
support in Europe for bombing Serb

artillery or the arming of Bosnian Mus
lims.
"We have not developed a consen
sus," said a senior U.S. official travel
ing with Christopher. However, the
official said there were encouraging
conversations with German, French
and Turkish leaders.
Despite the continuing hesitation of
the allies, there were predictions that
force would be used, though not imme
diately. First, the United States will
seek a new resolution from the U.N.
Security Council and perhaps a vote
from Congress.
The administration hopes that the
Serbs' rejection of the peace plan will
build momentum for allied action.
Seeking support, Clinton called French
President Francois Mitterrand, whose
country has 5,000 troops in the former
Yugoslavia as part of peacekeeping
forces.
"Military strikes are much more
likely than they were even a few hours
ago, but not, I think, in the next few
days," said Rep. Lee Hamilton, the
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
In Bosnia, meanwhile, defiant
Bosnian Serb troops advanced on the
eastern Muslim enclave of Zepa. Sara
jevo radio said at least 130 civilians
were killed when Serb troops broke
through a defense line on the town's

western side.
In a statement issued in Belgrade
yesterday, the Yugoslav government
said it acted because of international
sanctions on the Yugoslav economy.
The sanctions, and the drain on
finances caused by supporting the
Bosnian Serbs, has been ruining the
Yugoslav economy. Yesterday's action
was seen as an attempt to persuade the
United Nations to lift the recently
toughened sanctions.
In its statement, the government
expressed great concern over the Bosni
an Serb parliament's rejection of the
peace plan, and ordered strict imple
mentation of its decision to cut off aid.
Bosnian Serb deputies rejected the
peace plan after 17 hours of debate
Wednesday. They voted 51-2, with 12
abstentions, to instead put the peace
plan to a vote in Bosnia's Serb-held ter
ritories on May 15-16.
The assembly's vote followed days of
furious diplomatic efforts to get Serbs
to accept the plan, already approved by
Bosnia's Muslims and Croats.
Bosnian Serbs have opposed the
peace plan because it gives them patch
work territories instead of contiguous
ones. They also complain that the plan,
which divides Bosnia into 10 provinces
largely along ethnic lines, gives Serbs
only 43 percent of the republic's territo
ry. They now control nearly 70 percent.
