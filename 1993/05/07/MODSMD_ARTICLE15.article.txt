New smoking proposal
reeks of hypocrisy and
violates student rights

THE UNIVERSITY'S AIR
soon may be smoke-free, but
its wallet is still lined with
tobacco leaves.
Apparently spurred by studies
demonstrating the health hazards
of second-hand smoke, the Univer
sity is considering prohibiting the
use and sale of tobacco on campus.
The ban would encompass sales at
Tresidder Express, as well as
tobacco use in all campus buildings
and at University-sponsored out
door events.
But as current campus residents
are pressured to "kick the habit,"
the policy raises serious questions
about the University's respect for
people's privacy, the impact on stu
dents and, most significantly,
Stanford's integrity.
While the proposed policy —
widely publicized in local newspa
pers and on television — espouses
the politically correct attitude
which states "smoking is bad," the
University quietly continues to
invest millions of dollars in tobacco
companies.
As of Dec. 31, 1992, Stanford
had invested over $28.6 million in
four tobacco companies: Ameri
can Brands, Hanson Trust PLC
(a British-based company),
Loew's Corp. and, of course,
Philip Morris.
Such "Not in My Backyard"
hypocrisy must cease. If Stanford
has decided second-hand smoke,
and, presumably, first-hand smoke,
is too dangerous for people on
campus, then it must be too risky
for those off-campus as well. It's
time for the University to put its
money where its mouth is and
divest from these corporations.
If, however, the University isn't
ready to make this moral (and
financial) leap, perhaps it should
take a step back and simply consid

er the troublesome ethical implica
tions of the proposed policy.
First, the new smoking policy
would suggest the presence of a
dangerous, "big-brother" mindset
among campus officials. The plan
would reduce student privacy to
nothingness. Stanford already pro
hibits smoking "in indoor locations
where smokers and non-smokers
occupy the same area," such as
classrooms, libraries and computer
facilities.
Now the University apparently
wants to tell people they can't
smoke in their own personal space
— such as a dorm room (even if it's
a single) — or during outdoor Uni
versity events.
This encroachment on personal
liberty is parental at best and
tyrannical at worst. Such a med
dling policy hardly belongs on a
college campus, where a wide
range of quirks and idiosyncrasies,
habits and preferences are tolerat
ed in an atmosphere of learning
and self-responsibility.
What's next? Calisthenics at 6
a.m.? Mandatory physical-educa
tion classes? Low-fat Food Service
food?
Beyond the patronizing nature
of it all, another distinct concern
raised by the policy is its potential
effect on the finances of Tresidder
Union.
Reportedly, tobacco comprises
up to 10 percent — approximately
$120,000 — of Tresidder Express'
sales. The forfeiting of such rev
enue will undoubtedly provoke the
Bookstore, which owns the conve
nience shop, into renegotiating the
shop's lease. This in turn means a
revenue loss for Tresidder. In such
times of fiscal austerity, it will be
the student union which will be
damaged by the University's
attempt at taking what it sees as
the moral high ground.
In this topsy-turvy moral quag
mire, Stanford must make consis
tent choices. A high-brow policy to
ban smoking on campus, var
nished with superficial concerns
for the health of people on campus,
is no substitute for responsible
investment.
