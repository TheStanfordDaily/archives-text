Basic analytical skills needed to grasp ethnic issues

IN KEN TAN, George McKinney and
Jon Chow's attack on my letter, in
which I asked for "reasonable stan
dards" to justify the University establish
ing a in Asian-American studies or
any other field of ethnic or gender stud
ies, they complain that although Stanford
students have duly presented their argu
ments for the mjyor through University
channels for 20 years, their request has
not been approved. Why is that? Did they
never receive a fair hearing, or did their
arguments simply fail to persuade? I do
not know, but I suspect those arguments
conveyed the same impotency of ideas
reflected in the letter to me.
My critics justify their political action
by asserting the need to "raise aware
ness." Awareness of what? What issues
of ethnicity do they want to explore?
They never address that matter.
Instead, they accuse me of wanting
to deny them their First Amendment
rights. Nonsense. I never stated that

political demonstrations outside the
University are improper. Without such
demonstrations, which prompted the
subsequent passage of new laws to pro
tect the rights of the disenfranchised
and ill-treated, the lot of many Ameri
cans would never have improved. What
I said was that political demonstrations
are out of place in the academia,
because they tend to produce irrational
behavior that threatens civil, rational
discourse.
My critics offer two feeble justifica
tions for creating a new major: they
claim that such a major could "educate
students about the issues we all must
face in today's multicultural world" and
would "contribute to the alleviation of
societal ills."
But what are the issues and societal
ills that merit such attention? Can we
reach a consensus about which issues
and ills deserve more study than the
rest? How are these to be analyzed and

understood? Is there sufficient objective
historical documentation for their
study? The authors only offer vague
standards and disregard two major ques
tions: what will all this cost the Univer
sity, and more important, how many
students really care?
My student critics surely must under
stand the purpose of the academy. Stu
dents should first learn basic analytical
skills before taking on such complex
studies as ethnic issues and societal ills.
It is illogical to hope to adequately study
these complexities without having first
mastered the methodology and tech
niques of information collection and ver
ification.
How does this rationale apply to the
demand for an Asian-American Studies
major? Specialized courses on such eth
nic issues and societal ills are already
offered at the departmental level. The
University can even offer certificates of
excellence to students who demonstrate

the ability to complete a core of special
ized courses. This approach would
encourage interdisciplinary training
and allow students to apply their
methodological skills to problems rele
vant to their particular interests. More
over, it would allow departments to uti
lize their human resources more effi
ciently and to develop innovative cours
es at the frontiers of the social sciences
and humanities.
But this approach is very different
from creating a new major and a sepa
rate department for Asian-American
Studies or any other ethnic- or gender
studies field.
My critics have not thought through
the complex issues they insist the rest of
us consider. I invite them to come down
from the clouds and have lunch with me
in the real world of the Hoover Institu
tion's East Asian Collection.
