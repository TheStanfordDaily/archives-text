						Mother's Day letter for a Stanford heroine
## 
### 
I called my mother at work the other
day, the last day of National Secretaries'
Week. She answered "Political Science" in
the same gentle tone that has identified
her office for 30 years, and it struck me
that in all her time here, Elizabeth RafTer
ty never really has fit her job description.
Her administrative duties have been only
an introduction to the legacy of kindness
and support she has given to generations
of the Stanford community.
If I were not her son, and did not take
her for granted as sons do, it might sur
prise me that she treats every student
who walks through her door with the
same respect and concern that she offers
her worldly professors. I suppose I could
marvel at the diligence with which she
regularly converts incomplete tran-

scripts to timely diplomas. Maybe it
would seem extraordinary to see a group
of students single her out at Commence
ment and christen her with a wreath of
flowers, or spontaneously give her a
standing ovation. Yet these things don't
surprise me at all.
If all secretaries were as gracious, as
informed and as crucial to so large and
diverse a contingency — faculty, staff,
graduate students and undergraduates
alike — then Elizabeth RafTerty would
not be unique. But she has always cho
sen warmth over indifference, which
alone leads me to conclude, impartially
of course, that she has been a rare and
precious asset to this place.
Go and see her before she retires this
August. Wander in around 4:55 p.m. on
any weekday, and ask her for directions
or something. You'll see what I mean.
But don't tell her I sent you.
