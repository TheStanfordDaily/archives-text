The Daily's approach to the recent
Irish studies initiative deserves some
comment.
The Daily's April 30 story begins
"Irish-American studies? While beer,
shamrocks and leprechauns may come to
mind ..
Readers of The Daily are invited to
undertake the following thought experi
ment: substitute for "Irish" other eth
nicities and humorous characterizations.
Could this experiment be safely conduct
ed orally?
How about on the front page of The
Daily?
Most students are probably unaware
that discrimination against Irish
Catholics in both social and work set
tings occurred as recently as the 1920s

and 1930s and was equivalent to the
level of discrimination against African-
Americans in the 1960s and 19705.
Racial defects were generaiiy cited as the
basis for this practice.
Many Irish-Americans are uncomfort
able with this historical fact and are
inclined to deny or dismiss its impor
tance.
They consider themselves assimilated
and are little inclined to discuss the
issue.
Whether this is a satisfactory end to
the matter — for Irish-Americans or any
ethnic group — is a question that may
be reopened to everyone's benefit.
Chip Curran's proposal does not
strike me as a joke at all. Rather it
seems to me that his efforts to introduce
the issue on campus are due the same
courtesies as similar proposals by other
groups.
