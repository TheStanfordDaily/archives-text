# Lesbian reservist returns to work
## Biz School student Zoe Dunning reinstated in Navy 
### Sandy Lee 
Navy Lt. Zoe Dunning, a Stanford
Business School student, returned to
Alameda Naval Air Station Wednesday
as the first openly homosexual officer to
be temporarily reinstated by the Navy
under President Clinton's interim
guidelines concerning gays in the mili
tary.
"This is what I've been fighting for,"
said Dunning, who had been seeking re
instatement since being removed from
duty in the Naval Reserve in February.
Dunning was placed in a "records re
view" category, with her discharge pro
cedure pending, after announcing that
she is a lesbian at a January rally.

The rally at MofTett Field was held in
support of Petty Officer Keith Mein
hold, who was discharged for openly ad
mitting his homosexuality last year on
national television. Meinhold was later
reinstated by a court order.
A court order did not prove necessary
in Dunning's case, as the Navy — fol
lowing Clinton's administrative guide
lines — reinstated her on their own.
But the reinstatement is only tempo
rary. Dunning's immediate future in the
military hinges on a May 26 administra
tive-board hearing that will determine if
she can permanently remain in the re
serves or whether procedures for her
dismissal will continue.
Despite the heightened media inter

est as she returned to work, Dunning
said her fellow service members "treat
ed me as they had before."
"All I ever wanted was to do my job,"
Dunning continued. "My hope is that
the Navy will recognize my performance
and realize what a tremendous waste of
the Navy's resources it will be to kick me
out."
Base officials said yesterday they are
still waiting for further directives from
Washington.
Clinton, who promised to lilt the ban
on gays in the military, is expected to
issue an executive order ending the re
striction by July 15. Until then, dis-
charge procedures for gay service
members will essentially be placed
into a "holding file," Navy
spokesman Keith McCartney said.
"We have no legislative leg to
stand on," he said. "We're waiting
for guidance." Even if the admin
istrative board decides to proceed
with Dunning's discharge, the
executive order would override the
board's verdict, he said.
"As the [Navy's] policy stands
now, since she's declared her
homosexuality, she's violating the
Navy's policy and is being submit
ted for separation," McCartney
said.
Dunning said she hopes her
temporary reinstatement indi
cates a "softening of the Navy's
previous stance against gays in the
military. . . . They're recognizing
that we should be allowed to
serve."
However, McCartney said the
Navy's action was "just an order
that came down from Washing
ton."
"We don't dictate policy; we
just follow policy," he said.

According to Dunning's lawyer,
Mary McNamara, the Navy did
not complete the proper adminis
trative procedures before remov
ing Dunning from her position as
a supply officer.
"We are quietly optimistic that
the board won't vote to separate
her and will allow her to stay in
the reserves," McNamara said.
She also stressed that the
board decision is only a recom
mendation that will be considered
by the secretary of the Navy and
Attorney General Janet Reno.
Even if the board chooses to pro
ceed with separation, McNamara
said, Dunning should be allowed
to remain on duty until a final
decision is reached.
Dunning, who said she has an
unblemished record, hopes she
can serve as an example for other
gays and lesbians in the military.
Dunning served as an active
Naval officer for six years before
joining the Naval Reserve in
1991 in order to attend the
Graduate School of Business.
During the Persian Gulf war,
she worked as a support officer,
receiving a Navy commendation
medal. As a reservist, she usual
ly reports for duty one weekend
each month.
