## Biz School student Zoe Dunning reinstated in Navy

Navy Lt. Zoe Dunning, a Stanford
Business School student, returned to
Alameda Naval Air Station Wednesday
as the first openly homosexual officer to
be temporarily reinstated by the Navy
under President Clinton's interim
guidelines concerning gays in the mili
tary.
"This is what I've been fighting for,"
said Dunning, who had been seeking re
instatement since being removed from
duty in the Naval Reserve in February.
Dunning was placed in a "records re

cedure pending, after announcing that
she is a lesbian at a January rally.

The rally at MofTett Field was held in
support of Petty Officer Keith Mein

lines — reinstated her on their own.
But the reinstatement is only tempo

military hinges on a May 26 administra
tive-board hearing that will determine if
she can permanently remain in the re
serves or whether procedures for her
dismissal will continue.
Despite the heightened media inter

est as she returned to work, Dunning
said her fellow service members "treat

"All I ever wanted was to do my job,"
Dunning continued. "My hope is that
the Navy will recognize my performance
and realize what a tremendous waste of
the Navy's resources it will be to kick me
out."
Base officials said yesterday they are
still waiting for further directives from
Washington.
Clinton, who promised to lilt the ban
on gays in the military, is expected to
issue an executive order ending the re
striction by July 15. Until then, dis-
