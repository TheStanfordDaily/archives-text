## Go out and spoil some fun 
### 
MY DOG IS not the most intelli
gent being on the face of the plan
et. I can fully admit that. He
thinks that frisbees are alive. This
explains the mangled state of my frisbees
at home. He enjoys simple pleasures —
eating, sleeping and barking at toads.
Early on, I learned that bothering him
while he was eating or gnawing on some
thing recently deceased was a bad idea.
He'd growl and yelp until I left him alone.
I didn't really blame him, since, after all,
he was a dog, and didn't know any better
than to think I was about to steal that sev
ered bird's head away from him. What I
learned from this is that all you have to do
is push the right buttons to get a growly,
snarly response from anything or anyone.
Later on, I noticed the same kind of
response could be elicited from small chil
dren by popping their bubbles. Small
children don't like it when you pop their
soap bubbles, since they love to blow bub
bles out of those bear-shaped soap con
tainers. When I popped their bubbles,
they'd yell, "Hey, you spam-head!"
accompanied by numerous blows to the
shins. Obviously no one had ever come by
and popped their bubbles while they were
playing before.
I tried this with older people too. If you
have any "90210"-junkie friends, try this:
Tell them that you've heard that on the
season finale, Donna's overly-modified
nose falls off, Brandon is taken hostage by

the Crips, a pack of rabid wolverines
devours Kelly, and Brenda wins the lot
tery and takes up with that Rick twit
again. If you're confused, move on to the
next paragraph. If not, do so anyway.
After annoying children and "90210"-
philes for a while, I decided that the
world needs spoilers, people who kick
down the sandcastles and collapse the
card houses. Spoilers are people who
push all the wrong buttons of other peo
ple, just to get a response. We are all too
afraid of challenging existing systems
and asking tough questions simply to see
if they can be answered.
This isn't a repeat of the "commit-pre
meditated-acts-of-evil" column. In that
one, the victims of the acts of evil learned
a lesson about human nature and the
seemingly random dangers that the
world holds. Here, I am advocating occa
sional full-scale assaults on established
institutions, in order to see if the institu
tions can withstand those assaults.
Look around you and you'll see that
everyone has little card houses made up of
cliches and unquestioned values built up
for themselves. Mine's just to the right of
my Plaza of Paranoia. Every once in a
while we need to tear down our little con
ceptions of the world and make new ones.
Hopefully the new ones will be a bit closer
to reality than the old ones. For the spoil
er, this is irrelevant, since he still has fun
mucking up other people's worlds,

whether or not they are any better for it.
I've moved from terrorizing children
to bigger and better victims. Witness the
Asian-American Organization for the
Promotion of Multiculturalism Among
Fork-lift Operators and Formal Boat-
Dances in the City. To include this in a
column about people who spoil other peo
ple's fun is very dangerous, since some
AASA-head could decide to spoil my fun
by planting his or her foot through my
face. Try this at your own peril.
When the world's clunking along as
usual, someone needs to throw a wrench
in the works. The world needs to get a
wake-up call once in a while, when it's
getting too set in its ways. The spoiler
kicks the world in the teeth, just to see
what will happen.
Spoilers keep things moving, make
people revise their values and re-examine
what they are doing and why they are
doing it. If I get to do the kicking, so
much the better. I'm truly not inherently
sadistic (it's taken many years of hard
work to reach this level of sadism).

Kenny doesn't want anyone getting the
idea that he torments his dog; actually,
he feeds him lots ofpopsicles anytime he's
at home.
