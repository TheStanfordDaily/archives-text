# Joel Stein: Aphorisms that Smudge

-JL AJSSING UP TO NATURE
is like sending fan mail to Oprah. Both
are enormous, evil influences who laugh
at your supplication while they devour
small mammals. Nature laughs at Earth
Day the same way Oprah laughs at candy
with the phrase "fun size."
This whole eco thing — which not long
ago meant colorful shirts, good music,
clever flavors of ice-cream and women
wearing sleeveless shirts with really big
arm holes — has gone way too far.
When people started pounding on the
bathroom door, telling me to get out of
the shower, even though no one was wait
ing to get in, I knew they had gone too
far. But when Norman Mailer — the kind
of guy who not only wrote misogynistic
stories about brutal wife-beatings, but

actually tried it out himself — chastised a
New York neighbor for putting normal
garbage in a recycling container, I knew
morality had gone askew.
The world of eco-nuts is divided into
two camps. The first holds meetings and
minds their own business and doesn't
create any pollution except for those little
tabs of paper they leave behind at Dead
shows. They should be sequestered in co
operative housing until they achieve that
funky "A Rose For Emily" smell.
The second kind, the trendy ones, the
ones who destroy trees with 100-page
Patagonia and L.L. Bean catalogues,
has made life unbearable for those of us
who choose not to tend our own tofu
gardens.
To us, one less species of lizard means
one less species of lizard — 10 minutes of
Carolus Lineaus' time down the tube if
you're feeling pessimistic. So there's no
more lizards. There's no more decent

one-hour television dramas either, but no
one is throwing a rock concert for "Moon
lighting."
And only cute animals, like lizards, get
protected. If the eco guys really cared
about all animals — gret and smalle as
Chaucer would say — they'd stop recy
cling and let landfills pile up so all those
flies won't be turned out into the cold.
But they don't think like that.
Instead, the "earth systems" majors
continue to buck empirical data and try
to make us healthier by eliminating pol
lution. Meanwhile, people in Los Angeles
and New York are indisputably much bet
ter looking than people in Louisiana.
God, I feel like Andy Rooney.
Only rich people think about the envi
ronment. People whose dads are senators
and go to Harvard and marry unattrac
tive women who don't believe in the First
Amendment. Poor people don't worry
about Styrofoam. They complain about

taxes and health care and people whose
dads are senators and go to Harvard and
marry unattractive women who don't
believe in the First Amendment.
Ecomania is the same kind of
destructive self-aggrandizement that
religion and newspaper columnists have
been practicing for years. That's why
children are so into the ozone. It's not
because they're really worried about
skin cancer, but because it's a way of
saying. "Hey, I'm a good person. And
I'm only three. I may bite, but, as far as
long-range humanitarianism goes, I'm
eons ahead of Dad." It's Freudian, it's
dangerous and it's the same sick think
ing that makes kids call 911 to report
their parents for possession of marijua
na. And drag their parents to Raffi con
certs.
Nature, as our ancestors knew all too
well, is an evil force to be dominated, con
trolled and extinguished, like this whole

"Buns of Steel" craze. Nature means
mosquito bites, porto-potties and getting
sent home for being caught in the girls'
bunk. A Porsche is much more attractive
than a tree. Boning in an apartment over
looking the New York City skyline is
much better than having Pepe LePeu
force you and a loved one to take a bath
full of tomato juice together. Maybe not.
Call it yonic, but I still get all choked
up when a cement-mixer passes by.
