## Oliver leads the track pack, runs past competition 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
When sprint specialist Rhonda Oliver first arrived
on the Stanford track-and-field scene as a promising
freshman from Tyler, Texas, she had no idea why
the Cardinal made such a big deal out of its annual
dual meet against the Golden Bears of California.
"Our team back then had a few standouts, but
overall we were not a very good team," Oliver said. "I
couldn't figure out why Cal wanted to beat us so
badly my freshman year.
"I stepped out onto the track during Big Meet and
the intensity level was incredibly high. There was
even one girl who was crying on TV because she was
so happy that Cal won that year. I didn't even know
what Cal-Berkeley was in Texas."
Since then, Oliver has been converted into a red
blooded Cardinal and a Weenie-hater in her own
right. This Sunday, she will represent the nucleus of
a Stanford women's squad that is looking to capture
its third consecutive title in this intense Northern
California rivalry. Meanwhile, the men will struggle
to break their 20-year losing streak against Cal.
For Oliver, the transition from being a wide-eyed
freshman to a veteran senior team captain has had
many bumps and setbacks along the way.
"I had extraordinary goals coming out of high
school that were way beyond the collegiate scope,"
Oliver said, in reference to her aspirations of nation
al, and possibly international, competition during
her four years at Stanford.
Before entering college, Oliver won the 200-
meters at the Golden West Invitational, the top
national competition for high-school runners. Upon
matriculating at Stanford, she captured a fifth-place
finish in the 400 at the 1991 Pacific 10 Conference
Finals and a fourth-place showing in last year's Pac
-10 Championships.
Despite these accomplishments, Oliver did not see
a marked time improvement from her high-school
days, until this season.
"I know Rhonda came here as a high-school phe
nom," said first-year Stanford coach Vin Lananna.
"She had some frustrations and disappointments
when she first arrived, and it took her some time to
deal with whatever adversities she had.
"But this year she has really cast all of that off.
She made up her mind very early during the season
that she was going to have a great year, and she's
doing just that."
This year, Oliver is the only Cardinal runner who

has qualified in three events at the Pac-lOs. She ran
a lifetime best of 11.97 seconds to qualify in the 100.
She repeated that same feat by running her high
school best of 54.88 in the 400, before rounding out
her achievements with a 24.28 in the 200.
Despite qualifying in three events, Oliver has
opted to concentrate solely on the 400 and produce a
championship performance from that race. Lananna
believes that if anyone can do it, it will be Oliver, his
top sprinter.
"Track is definitely an individual sport. When
you're running the 400 meters and you falter during
the last 100 meters, no one's going to take your place
or act as your substitute. You have to do it yourself,"
Lananna said. "When the gun goes off, Rhonda Oliv
er is clearly a champion in that aspect, whether she
comes in first or not."
In addition to experiencing personal success this
season, Oliver has also assumed the unquestionably
gratifying role of team captain for the young Cardi
nal squad. After the departure of Olympians Jackie
Edwards and Chryste Gaines from the team last
year, Oliver became the team's main motivational
figure.
According to Lananna, Oliver's pivotal role as a
team captain for his young group of runners has
translated into added responsibility and a mentor
role for the freshman sprinters.
"She goes out there and works hard everyday, and
you can't help but admire and try to emulate that,
because there are just some days when you don't feel
like practicing," said freshman runner Monica Hog
gatt. "Her work ethic affects the whole team and
keeps us going."
Never one to be loud or outspoken, Oliver pos
sesses what Lananna terms as a "quiet confidence."
"She's got a wonderful ability to put her finger
on what the tenor of the program is at a particular
time," Lananna said. "As a result, I think she
serves as a great leader; right now she is certainly
the pillar supporting the women's track-and-field
team."
According to Hoggatt, Oliver also inspires confi
dence on the 4 x 400 relay team, which the senior
anchors. "When we're in a close race, we're always
confident about the finish, because the last person
we hand the baton to will always be Rhonda."
Oliver will anchor the Cardinal team this Sunday
as well, as it hosts the Bears at Stanford Stadium.
The meet is slated to start at 12:30 p.m., with Oliver
racing in the 100, 200,4 x 100 and 4 x 400 during the
day.
