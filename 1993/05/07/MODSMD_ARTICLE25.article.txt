# Crew ends regular season in Newport
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Heading into its last regatta
before the Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships, the men's crew
team hopes to bolster its third
place standing in the Pacific 10
Conference at the Newport
Regatta in Newport, Calif., this
weekend.
Trailing only Washington and
California in the Pac-10, the 5-2
Cardinal had its best showing
this season during last week's
race against UC-Davis at Red
wood Shores. The varsity eight
finally put all the pieces together
and set a school record of 5 min
utes, 42 seconds for the 2,000-
meter course.
"Our 5-2 record is the best
we've had for a long time," Stan
ford men's coach Wieslaw Kujda
said. "The team was anxious
[last week] to row and put San
Diego and Cal behind them, and
they went out and set the
record."
Stanford's disappointing
eighth-place finish at the San
Diego Crew Classic last month
and the crushing defeat at the
hands of the Golden Bears three
weeks ago had put the team in a
bit of a tailspin. However, the
strong showing last weekend
reversed the fortunes of the
team.
This weekend's competition
looks to give Stanford another
chance to fatten its rccord before

the championships, as UCLA
appears to be the only challenge
for the Cardinal varsity. The
junior-varsity, novice and fresh
man boats may have some diffi
culty as they tangle with Orange
Coast College, one of the top
junior-college crew programs in
the country.
The women's team, still beset
with injuries, ended its regular
season schedule last week on a
disappointing note against
Davis, but will go into the cham
pionships with a probable fifth
seed and will face Cal in the first
heat.
The diagnosis of Kate Ste
ger's back injury, which caused
her to lose feeling in her right
leg last week, is still uncertain.
An MR! test showed that the
injury did not involve a ruptured
disc.
"I think we'll have her back
for championships in two
weeks," said women's coach
Wendy Davis. "We'll try her in
practice probably next Tuesday,
and see from there."
Sarah Morse is also still on
the shelf with a back injury and
Cara Larson is battling a
bronchial problem. Both are
expected back by early next
week.
"Sarah's ready to chew
through a metal bar or some
thing," Davis said, commenting
on the frustration of one of a
handful of injured Cardinal
rowers.
