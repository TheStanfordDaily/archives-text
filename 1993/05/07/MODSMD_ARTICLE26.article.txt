# Baseball hopes for change of fortune, lift from last in Six-Pac this weekend
## Stanford must win all three vs. California to keep postseason chances alive 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Stanford and California will do
battle on the baseball diamond
this weekend in a three-game set
that should determine last place
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division.
The Bears (25-29 overall, 11-
16 Six-Pac) are a ghastly 6-14
over their last 20 games, dropping
from second to fifth place in the
Six-Pac in the process. Despite
taking two of three from Cal ear
lier in the season, Stanford (23-
22, 8-16) sits a game-and-a-half

It's frustrating above
anything else. At
some point, you've
got to stop blaming
our play on youth.'

behind the Bears, with six confer
ence games remaining on its
schedule.
"We're in last place, but the
effort's been there," said Stan

ford coach Mark Marquess.
"We've played hard; we just
haven't played well. In some
ways, it'd be easier to accept this
all if we hadn't been playing
hard."
Last weekend perfectly exem
plified the young Cardinal's dis
appointing season. Facing No. 2
Arizona State on the road, Stan
ford split the first two games of
the series and took a three-run
lead into the ninth inning of the
rubber game, only to lose it in
extra innings.
"It's frustrating above any
thing else," said Cardinal catcher

A.J. Hinch, who picked up a
career-high five hits on Sunday.

blaming our play on youth/'
After facing a blistering Sun
Devil offense for three days, the
Cardinal pitching staff should
have an easier time against the
Bear lineup. California is last in
the Six-Pac with a .256 average,
and the team is averaging less
than five runs per game, two runs
below the conference average.
"They don't have a lot of power,
and they've had some trouble scor
ing runs," Marquess said. "Cal's
lineup is a lot like our own."
Indeed. While showing signs of
promise, the Cardinal offense has
been inconsistent. Against Ari
zona State, Stanford batted
almost .350, facing a pitching
staff widely considered to be the
best in the division.
The Cardinal coaching staff
has tinkered with the Stanford
lineup over the last few weeks in
an effort to increase run produc
tion. On Sunday, freshmen Brian
Dallimore and Hinch clicked
when put together in the first and
second slots, respectively, com
bining for eight hits.
"We don't have any set line
up," Marquess said. "But Hinch
and Dallimore have both been
having outstanding seasons."
When on base, the Bears
should challenge Hinch often —
five Cal players have hit double
figures in stolen bases, headed by
Six-Pac leader Nate Brown with
23.
"They will pressure us on the
basepaths more than any other Six-
Pac team," Marquess said. "While
an Arizona or an Arizona State will
sit back and wait for a big inning,
Cal will work to score runs."
Brown, one of the Bears' three
captains, is exciting both on the
basepaths and on the mound.
Brown has started 13 games on
the hill for Cal, amassing an
amazing 90 strikeouts in only 60
innings of work.
Which is not to say that the 6-
foot-4 junior is having a good year
as a pitcher. Brown, who will
start Sunday's game, is 0-6 with a
6.60 earned-run average, having
coughed up 67 walks and 18 wild
pitches in those same 60 innings.
But the Cardinal, which must
sweep its final six conference
games to keep any postseason
hopes alive, has more to worry
about than Brown alone.
"We've got to concentrate on
pulling all aspects of our game
together," Marquess said. "Hope
fully, the games will take care of
themselves."
