## Can 'B movies' save my zombie child? 
### Mike Noren 
Pablo Picasso once said, "The
chief enemy of creativity is 'good'
taste."
Picasso is dead now, but the
war against "good taste" contin
ues. One battlefront of that war
is the film industry, more specif
ically, the otherwordly territory
of B movies. In this limbo
dimension filled with sex, gore,
half-human monsters and amus
ing titles, filmmakers are
valiantly defending the uncon
taminated individuality that
Picasso held so dear.
These crusading filmmakers,
through such films as "The Inva
sion of the Bee Girls," "The Aveng

ing Disco Godfather" and"The
Incredibly Strange Creatures Who
Stopped Living and Became Mixed-
Up Zombies," sacrifice their own
chances for widespread success â€”
so that they may produce the sim
ple, creative entertainment they
truly enjoy making. This is artistic
integrity at its finest.
Whether we recognize it or not,
many of the most unique and
amusing films available in video
stores today are the fruits of the
dedication and integrity of low-bud
get filmmakers.
Even though the production of
bizarre films hit a zenith in the late
'60s and early '70s, in our age of
countless "Fatal Attraction" rip
offs, the B-movie industry still pro

vides us with fresh, imaginative
gems. A fine example is "Sorority
Babes In the Slimeball Bowl-O-
Rama." In this 1987 release, which
proves that a film doesn't have to
be old to be a classic, a sorority-ini
tiation prank in a bowling alley
accidentally disturbs an evil little
teenage-Yoda-looking spirit known
as "the imp," who "creates demons
and loves sexy women."
A light-hearted horror/action
adventure/comedy such as this
can offer just the refreshing
change of pace you need in order
to relax your mind for the second
half of the quarter.
For those interested in a set
ting perhaps more exotic than the
local lanes, "Cannibal Women In
the Avocado Jungle of Death"
could be an entertaining choice.
Here, we follow our heroes as they
make the dangerous journey into
the deadly Avocado Jungle in
search of captured people held
prisoner by a mysterious tribe of
savage women.
For those looking for a sci-fi
space adventure of somewhat ques
tionable taste, "2069: A Sex
Odyssey" might be a good selec
tion. This is the tale of a group of
friendly female aliens who come to
earth on a mission to collect a sup
ply of "the seed" to save their dying
all-female planet. If you liked
"E.T." and you liked "Bolero," you
should er\joy "2069."
And finally, for all those
Schwarzenegger fans out there,
the world of low-budget films
offers "Hercules Goes Bananas."
Arnold Schwarzenegger takes his
first step toward superstardom as
he portrays Hercules, causing lots
of trouble in New York City after
being sent down to earth from
Olympus. Apparently this was
before Arnold had polished up his
English-speaking skills, since a

strange un-Arnold voice is used in
place of his. If you're amused by
Bruce Lee movies or the "Paging
Mr. Herman" scene in "Pee-Wee's
Big Adventure," you'll just love
watching the words coming out of
Arnold's mouth in a strange, deep,
unaccented voice.
And if after you watch a bunch
of these films you still want more,
you can go to a bookstore and pick
up a copy of Re/Search No. 10:
Incredibly Strange Films. This
guide to weird movies includes
interviews with many of the
great, yet largely unappreciated,
directors of gore and sexploitation
films, and a variety of features on
many important B-movie stars,
such as Tura Satana, best known
for her stunning performance in
"Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!," and
David Bradley of "They Saved
Hitler's Brain" fame. The book
also presents overviews of the
basic genres of the industry,
including biker films, beach-party
films, women-in-prison films and
industrial-jeopardy films. Finally,
it provides a list of about 300
highly recommended but little
known films, including a subset of
six movies directly based on the
life of Charles Manson.
So if you're tired of watching
confusing movies that you don't
quite get, or if you need to rest
your brain with some good, mind
less entertainment, there's a
whole new world just waiting to be
explored. Go rent "Blood Orgy of
the She-Devils," "Beneath the Val
ley of the Ultra-Vixens" or maybe
"The Wrestling Women vs. the
Aztec Mummy." Then again,
there's always "Ilsa; She-Wolf of
the SS," "The Undertaker and His
Pals" or "Shriek of the Mutilated."
You'll be surprised with the things
you'll see.
Picasso would be proud.
