# Where CIV fails: a vital cultural quiz
## 
### 
CIV is often neglected by freshman who think
it's worthless, but you have to admit, there's
some good lessons to be learned there. Forget
Plato and Marx, we're talking about real skills
here, like flirting with attractive members of the
desired sex. You know, important things like
feigning knowledge through the use of large
words like "epistemological" and "consequen
tialism," and appearing to be thoughtfully con
templating philosophy while actually sleeping.
You can't survive Stanford without these basic
skills.
Yet, I think there's some down-to-earth real
ly meaty material missing here. You can quote
philosophy and discuss political ramifications of
historical events all day long, but it's not going to
get you a date. What do you need to know to sur
vive, darn it?
It's time to bring in the hardcore stuff now:
Smurfs.
Sure, they live in fungus. Yes, they're only
three apples tall (which means if they run into a
dog during that special season of the year, well
heck, they'd better run for their lives) And yes,
they have to share one woman between all of
them. But shoot, they're happy!
Of course, all you really need to know is that
they're blue and say "smurf' a lot. Maybe know
ing a few of their names is good too. But that's it
— you've just added a significant cultural icon to
your Rolodex-o-Knowledge.
What else? Well, I personally think Scooby
Doo is a MUST. You can't survive at parties
without knowing how to ask your date, "Let's go
explore the Mystery Machine." And if you know
about Land of the Lost (especially the
Sleestacks) it's an added bonus as well.
So, do you have what it takes to survive? Take
this quick quiz and see for yourself:
(1) What is really stupid about the people stuck

Do we care? Probably not, but now you'll see
how you stand against other members of mod
ern-day society.
