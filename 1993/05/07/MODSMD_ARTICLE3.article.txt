# Closed for a year, Teahouse finally reopens

In the daytime, it could be no more than an
old, battered door fading into woodwork of
the Wilbur complex, a nondescript storage
room tucked away in a dark corner adjacent to
Madera that hardly raises the eyebrows of
students passing by on the way to do their

people tell me they like the atmosphere better
than Stern Late Night."
The size of about two-and-a-half Wilbur
dorm rooms put together, the Teahouse, with
its open kitchen and five small tables resem

cafe.
"We don't try to impress people with a
restaurant atmosphere," said Tan, surveying
the 12-year-old establishment whose simple
