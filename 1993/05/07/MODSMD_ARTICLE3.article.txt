# Closed for a year, Teahouse finally reopens
## Ramen without a hot pot, spring rolls and more draw late-night crowds 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
In the daytime, it could be no more than an
old, battered door fading into woodwork of
the Wilbur complex, a nondescript storage
room tucked away in a dark corner adjacent to
Madera that hardly raises the eyebrows of
students passing by on the way to do their
laundry.
Come 10 p.m., however, the door swings
open and the deserted corner is transformed
into a colorful hub of east campus nightlife:
flocks of students weave in and out of the
thick aroma of spring rolls and ramen, while
deep blue tatami mats occupied by tea
drinkers barely eyeing their papers and prob
lem sets are drawn by the buzz of conversa
tion and familiar faces. At the counter a voice
calls, "One shrimp ramen! Hey, I said one

shrimp ramen!"
With all the late-night eateries that have
been recently cropping up on campus, the old
est alternative to University Food Service has
returned, much to the delight of the crowd
that prefers tea and ramen over coffee and
biscotti.
After being closed down for a year due to
increased competition from Kimball's late
night food service, the Teahouse reopened its
doors earlier this week, and has been serving
up its noodles with a vengeance.
"We realized that people were missing the
Teahouse," said senior Ken Tan, who has
been managing the student-run eatery for
two years now, making monthly trips to Chi
natown to buy its pre-cooked supply of dim
sum.
"The food is kind of secondary," he ex
plained. "Most people just come to hang out

and bump into people they know. I've had
people tell me they like the atmosphere better
than Stern Late Night."
The size of about two-and-a-half Wilbur
dorm rooms put together, the Teahouse, with
its open kitchen and five small tables resem
bles a cozy family room more than a yuppie
cafe.
"We don't try to impress people with a
restaurant atmosphere," said Tan, surveying
the 12-year-old establishment whose simple
decor consists of a few murals and some Chi
nese calligraphy.
"Other late-night places are too big and
impersonal," said Teahouse worker Lan
Phan, a freshman, as she hung a long swatch
of fuchsia silk across one of the walls. "Plus,
there aren't too many places where you can
get Asian food."
On any night from Sunday to
Thursday, one can find a steady
flow of customers milling in and
out from 10 p.m. to midnight, as
Teahouse volunteer Hanson Li
well knows.
The freshman has already
had to balance 20 orders at one
time.
"Right after house meeting,
on Wednesdays, that's when you
get the big crowds," said Li, as
he quickly took down orders
from a horde of ramen-grub
bers. "Why do people come here?
It's because it's cheap. Very
cheap."
Atmosphere and ethnic food
aside, "cheap" seems to be the
operative word at the Teahouse,
whose menu includes a selection
of spring rolls, ramen, pork
buns and steamed pork
dumplings, each for a mere 60
cents.
"What brought me here was
Stern," said freshman Heyning
Cheng, who has already been to
the Teahouse twice this week,

and condemned the notorious
prices of the point system over
his bowl of ramen. "Three bucks
for a sandwich? $2.25 for a slice
of pizza?"
Back in the Teahouse's
kitchen one can see the steam
ers and plastic plates filled with
the stuff that makes all
nighters bearable: the soft,
white bao (BOW) filled with
bits of barbecued pork; crispy
spring rolls sizzling with the
smell of deep-fried vegetables;
sui mai (SOW-MY) — a glob of
steamed pork trimmed with a
won-ton wrapper; and enough
ramen flavor packets to send
that exhilarating feel of MSG
pumping through the veins for
ever.
A quick survey of tables
reveals the most popular order of
the night to be, ironically, the
one dish customers could proba
bly make themselves: the all
purpose bowl of ramen.
So why pay 60 cents here
when they could make it them
selves for 35? "It's nice having it
made for you," said freshman
Joanna Selznick. "Besides," she
added, "It's lonely making
ramen with a little hot pot in
your dorm room."
