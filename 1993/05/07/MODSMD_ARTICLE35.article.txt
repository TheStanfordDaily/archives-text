# Law grad's recent book ignites conservation controversy
## 
### Matt Parsons 
Raymond Bonner is used to
criticism — both dishing it out
and taking it.
And while the Stanford Law
School graduate may not wel
come reproach with open arms,
he said he realizes that it's
inevitable when one writes about
controversial topics.
A journalist and author, Bon
ner has written books on topics
such as U.S. intervention in El
Salvador and American involve
ment in the Philippines under the
government of Ferdinand Marcos.
But his latest effort, titled "At
the Hand of Man: Peril and Hope
for Africa's Wildlife," has stirred
controversy in a different area —
the efforts to conserve African
wildlife.
"The book is about conserva
tion," explained Bonner, who
will be appearing at the Stanford
Bookstore today. "The bottom
line is that I want to save the
incredible African wild."
His efforts question current
Western animal-rights activists'
policies toward bans on ivory

poaching in Africa.
"Our conservation policies in
the past have been misguided,"
Bonner said. "They have been
based too much on emotions and
romantic views of the wildlife in
Africa and have ignored the
African people. There's more to
wildlife conservation than just
wildlife; there's also the African
people."
In the book, Bonner argues
that conservation organizations
such as the World Wildlife Fund
and the African Wildlife Federa
tion have formed an "eco-colo
nialism" that concentrates more
on highly publicized fund-raising
campaigns than with assisting
the African people most affected
by conservation efforts.
For example, Bonner writes
that the conservation organiza
tions' campaign to ban the sale
of ivory has cost African govern
ments over $50 million a year.
He also argues that in some
countries, there are already too
many elephants that are wreak
ing havoc on the African people
and ecosystems.
"I report about how within

the World Wildlife Fund, conser
vationists with any experience in
Africa are totally opposed to the
ban on ivory," he said. "Indeed,
the fund-raisers, the people who
are raising the money and want
new members, wanted a ban and
have prevailed."

'There's more to
wildlife conservation
than just wildlife;
there's also the African
people.'
— Raymond Bonner

Bonner explained that he first
became interested in African
wildlife conservation while he
was living in Nairobi. He said
that just after he arrived, he saw
a number of poached elephants
and was horrified.
"I began yelling and scream
ing about the ivory trade and
that it ought to be stopped," Bon
ner said. "I thought I would do

an ihvestigative book about the
ivory trade, but the longer I
looked at it, the more I began to
get outraged about the enlisted
conservationists working in
Africa."
To research his book, Bonner
stayed in Nairobi for four-and-a
half years and interviewed peo
ple from all over the continent to
compile evidence.
Although Bonner presents a
critical assessment of conserva
tion organizations, he said he
doesn't understand why people
are condemning his conclu
sions.
"I'm a reporter," he said. "I'm
just reporting what other people
are doing and saying. This book
is giving a voice to the voices that
are not always heard. It is these
people who are saying that the
ivory ban is a bad idea.
"I'm not making policy,"
Bonner added. "I'm not these
conservation * organizations
who are handing out millions of
dollars for programs and
imposing policies. I'm discover
ing it is OK to criticize the
American government, but

don't criticize these conserva
tion organizations because
somehow they are angels and
are above criticism."
Bonner, who graduated from
the Law School in 1967, gave up
his legal career to become a jour
nalist, traveling to Latin Ameri
ca as a reporter for The New
York Times.

He said he was first embroiled
in controversy when he reported
about a massacre of several hun
dred women and children by
right-wing death squads in El Sal
vador.
"I wrote about the death
squads and about this one partic
ular massacre," Bonner said.
"That is when The Wall Street
Journal wrote an entire editorial
blasting me, saying that what I
was doing in El Salvador was
delivering information to the
communists. That started the
right-wing and Reagan adminis
tration attacks."
Bonner said his reporting was
vindicated a few months ago
when mass graves were found in
El Mazote.
"I am happy that the truth
finally came out, but I never took
it as a personal thing," Bonner
said. "It goes with the territory. I
give a lot of lumps and I have to
take my lumps too.
"There's a parallel," he added.
"I was writing against the grain
then, and I'm writing against the
grain now, although I didn't
realize how much so."
