## New bill may decrease underage access to alcohol 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Party planners may have a tougher time
finding someone to buy their beer if a new
keg-regulating bill making its way through
the state Legislature is signed into law.
The proposed regulations, intended to
deter adults from purchasing alcohol for
minors, would force consumers to supply
their driver's license number, address and
name when purchasing kegs.
The state Assembly passed the bill earlier
this week. It now awaits final approval from
the Senate.
Under the proposed law, liquor stores
would also be required to keep information
on individuals who purchased full- or half
kegs for six months after the purchase,
according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.

'It would make me a little
more conscious of my respon
sibility as the provider of
alcohol if my name were on
the keg.'

"The bottom line, from our point of view, is
that if you elect to buy a keg, it would behoove
you to make darn sure that there are no peo
ple under 21 (drinking)," Niemeyer said.
And while some students said the bill
might make them think twice before volun
teering to buy beer, local liquor store man
agers don't seem too concerned.
"Sales wise, I don't think it will have much

of an impact," said Norton Scott, assistant
manager of Beltramo's Wine and Liquors.
Scott, who said he wasn't familiar with the
bill, added that keeping records of purchases
would not significantly increase the return
rate of kegs either, because "we almost never
have a big or serious problem (in getting kegs
back)."
Duncan Elkins, a senior who lives in
Robinson House, said he has bought kegs
before, but the bill might deter him from pur
chasing one for a dorm party. "I suppose it is
easy enough to see whose keg it is anyway,"
he said. "But it would make me a little more
conscious of my responsibility as the provider
of alcohol if my name were on the keg."
By requiring stores to keep records of keg
purchases, lawmakers would be provided
with a "more direct line" to find the persons
liable if an underage drinker is injured at a
party with a labeled keg, Fraternal Affairs

Adviser Heather Dunn said.
"In those types of lawsuits, Ithe plaintiffs]
are looking for the deep pocket," and will sue
not only the individual who purchased the
keg, but the sponsoring organization and the
University as well, she said.
But Dunn added that the bill may not
affect Stanford parties greatly, particularly
since the Greek system is already considering
phasing out the use of common liquor con
tainers and resorting to a "bring your own
beer" policy.
Brad Budney, a Phi Delta Theta resident
assistant, said the bill won't have a great
impact on his fraternity's parties because Phi
Delt officers sign University liability clauses at
the beginning of the year.
"I believe fraternities already have a good
policy," said Budney, adding that they check
IDs before allowing people to drink, and use
wristbands to identify legal drinkers.
