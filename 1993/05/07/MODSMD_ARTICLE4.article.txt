# Animal activists to target Stanford professor

Demonstrators from the group "In De
fense of Animals" plan to hold a rally in Palo
Alto's Lytton Plaza today to target a Stanford
professor who performs experiments with an
imals.
The noontime gathering will focus on Psy
chiatry Prof. Seymour Levine, who conducts
social behavioral experiments with monkeys
and other animals, organizers said.
Levine said he has no response to the
planned demonstration.
"I don't know what reaction I can give. . .
at this point, seeing as how [the protests]
have been going on so long," he said. "I'm not
sure I have any reactions anymore."
According to Levine, he has been harassed
by animal rights groups for more than 10

years. As a result of an article printed in the
Sacramento Bee last year about his research,
Levine began receiving hate mail from across
the country. Much of it, Levine said, has been
very anti-Semitic in nature.
A Stanford professor since 1962, Levine
has continuously come under attack for his
animal experiments. He contends, however,
his research has helped change the way that
scientists view child development.
"We're really interested in social interac
tion and lack of social interaction of stress
physiology [in squirrel monkeysl," said
Levine. His current research focuses on fami
ly relationships between squirrel monkeys
and their offspring, and is intended to in
crease the knowledge of the links between
child development and stress in the family.
But Eliot Katz, a veterinarian and presi

dent of In Defense of Animals, doesn't think
Levine's research deserves much merit. He
said the demonstration will focus on what he
calls "the waste, ludicrousness, senselessness
and cruelty in Seymour Levine's work."
Lise Giraud, co-director of education for
the animal-rights group, describes Levine's
work as "totally worthless . . . [It's] big
money going down an intellectual sink
hole."
She said that the demonstration is being
held close to Mother's Day to call attention to
government funding of Levine's work on "day
care." This research, according to Giraud,
consists of the "maternal deprivation" of
squirrel monkeys.
In these experiments, squirrel monkeys are
