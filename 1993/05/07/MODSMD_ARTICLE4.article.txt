# Animal activists to target Stanford professor
## 
### Sean Kennedy 
Demonstrators from the group "In De
fense of Animals" plan to hold a rally in Palo
Alto's Lytton Plaza today to target a Stanford
professor who performs experiments with an
imals.
The noontime gathering will focus on Psy
chiatry Prof. Seymour Levine, who conducts
social behavioral experiments with monkeys
and other animals, organizers said.
Levine said he has no response to the
planned demonstration.
"I don't know what reaction I can give. . .
at this point, seeing as how [the protests]
have been going on so long," he said. "I'm not
sure I have any reactions anymore."
According to Levine, he has been harassed
by animal rights groups for more than 10

years. As a result of an article printed in the
Sacramento Bee last year about his research,
Levine began receiving hate mail from across
the country. Much of it, Levine said, has been
very anti-Semitic in nature.
A Stanford professor since 1962, Levine
has continuously come under attack for his
animal experiments. He contends, however,
his research has helped change the way that
scientists view child development.
"We're really interested in social interac
tion and lack of social interaction of stress
physiology [in squirrel monkeysl," said
Levine. His current research focuses on fami
ly relationships between squirrel monkeys
and their offspring, and is intended to in
crease the knowledge of the links between
child development and stress in the family.
But Eliot Katz, a veterinarian and presi

dent of In Defense of Animals, doesn't think
Levine's research deserves much merit. He
said the demonstration will focus on what he
calls "the waste, ludicrousness, senselessness
and cruelty in Seymour Levine's work."
Lise Giraud, co-director of education for
the animal-rights group, describes Levine's
work as "totally worthless . . . [It's] big
money going down an intellectual sink
hole."
She said that the demonstration is being
held close to Mother's Day to call attention to
government funding of Levine's work on "day
care." This research, according to Giraud,
consists of the "maternal deprivation" of
squirrel monkeys.
In these experiments, squirrel monkeys are
separated from their mothers in
order to measure their stress level,
she said. Calling govern
ment funding of Levine's work a
"nugor social problem," Giraud
said that San Mateo County only
received $600,000 for day-care
spending last year while Levine got
$900,000 from a recent National
Institutes of Health grant.
Giraud's husband, Raymond
Giraud, a retired Stanford profes
sor, will also speak at the rally, as
will law student Nathan Wino
grad.
Animal testing at Stanford is
regulated by several strict guide
lines. Tests must be approved by
an "animal care" council com
posed of scientists, community
members, a veterinarian and oth
ers. Stanford facilities are also
subject to inspections by outside
authorities including the Nation
al Institutes of Health and the
Department of Agriculture.
Medical Center spokesman
Don Gibbons said Levine no
longer performs "maternal depri
vation" experiments. His work

'We're not expecting
anything bad and
they said they weren't
going to do anything
bad.'

now focuses on "family studies,"
Gibbons said.
Gibbons said the University
would be prepared to support
Levine if the demonstration hap
pens to make its way to the cam
pus. However, he said they have
no current plans to oppose the
demonstrators.
Levine said there will be "a lot
of security" around his facilities
just in case the demonstrators
decide to march onto campus.
But Palo Alto Police Officer Jim
Coffman said city officials do not
expect anything out of the ordi
nary to occur.
"It's a public plaza. They can
talk, they can hand out literature.
. . . We're not expecting anything
bad and they said they weren't
going to do anything bad," Coff
man said.
