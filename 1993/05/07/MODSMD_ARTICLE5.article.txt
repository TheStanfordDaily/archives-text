# Conflicting interests?
## Policy could require professors to maintain commitment to Stanford 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Faculty members will be required to
demonstrate a commitment to Stanford
and maintain a significant campus pres
ence, if a new University policy on conflict
of commitment and interest is approved.
Although the final draft of the policy still
has to be accepted by the Committee on Re
search and the Faculty Senate, it states
that faculty "owe their primary profession
al allegiance to the University, and their
primary commitment of time and intellec
tual energy should be to the education, re
search and scholarship program of the in
stitution."
The draft goes on to outline the obliga
tions of faculty members, the requirements
for disclosure of inventions, technological
achievements and other situations that

could present possible conflicts of interests.
According to Chemistry Prof. Steven
Boxer, a committee member, University
President Gerhard Casper asked the 11-
member committee in November to look
into these issues because of recent changes
in the faculty's role in outside projects.
Since there has been a long history of
"faculty entrepreneurship," Boxer said ad
vances in technology have forced the com
mittee question faculty members' commit
ment to the University and the conflicts
raised by excessive outside involvement.
If the current wording is retained by the
committee, the requirements would mark a
major change in University policy. Cur
rently, faculty guidelines do not state what
a professor is required to do, according to
the Office of the Dean of Research.
