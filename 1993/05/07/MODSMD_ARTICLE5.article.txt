# Conflicting interests?
## Policy could require professors to maintain commitment to Stanford 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Faculty members will be required to
demonstrate a commitment to Stanford
and maintain a significant campus pres
ence, if a new University policy on conflict
of commitment and interest is approved.
Although the final draft of the policy still
has to be accepted by the Committee on Re
search and the Faculty Senate, it states
that faculty "owe their primary profession
al allegiance to the University, and their
primary commitment of time and intellec
tual energy should be to the education, re
search and scholarship program of the in
stitution."
The draft goes on to outline the obliga
tions of faculty members, the requirements
for disclosure of inventions, technological
achievements and other situations that

could present possible conflicts of interests.
According to Chemistry Prof. Steven
Boxer, a committee member, University
President Gerhard Casper asked the 11-
member committee in November to look
into these issues because of recent changes
in the faculty's role in outside projects.
Since there has been a long history of
"faculty entrepreneurship," Boxer said ad
vances in technology have forced the com
mittee question faculty members' commit
ment to the University and the conflicts
raised by excessive outside involvement.
If the current wording is retained by the
committee, the requirements would mark a
major change in University policy. Cur
rently, faculty guidelines do not state what
a professor is required to do, according to
the Office of the Dean of Research.
Current policies, which fail to
address issues of commitment
head-on, provide "a great opportu
nity for misunderstanding and
exploitation," according to com
mittee member Barton Bernstein,
a professor of history.
The real issue, Bernstein said,
is determining whether the Uni
versity is the primary employer of
a faculty member, and what kind
of expectations should be imposed
regarding his or her loyalty or
commitment to the University.
Bernstein himself believes that
in many cases, faculty members
should be teaching more. This
idea is included in the proposal's
requirement that faculty mem
bers devote their primary energies
to University obligations.

Another part of the draft, deal
ing with faculty conflicts-of-inter
est, requires faculty to disclose to
the University any inventions cre
ated with Stanford resources or
gift funds.
These disclosures would ensure
that the credit for inventions is
properly assigned and that the
University meets all its obligations
to sponsors.
"It's good that the University is
considering these issues and ensur
ing that all parties involved in
research missions — including
industry and government sponsors
— are treated very well," said grad
uate student Todd Flynn, one of
three students on the committee.
The policy also includes a sec
tion that gives examples of possi
ble conflict-of-interest situations.
These situations include activ
ities that favor outside interests,
result in large financial gain or
put students in compromising

will not resolve problems,
it will raise problems,

and some prescriptions.'

positions. In an attempt to pre
vent any unnecessary conflicts,
the policy draft also includes a
section that would require the
faculty to give advance notifica
tion of any outside work that
would constitute a conflict.
The committee is also consider
ing requiring the faculty to submit
an annual certification of compli
ance with the policy.
According to Boxer, different
departments have different per
ceptions about the University's
role in both internal and exter

nal activities. "What makes
sense [in terms of time spent in
outside work] for the Medical
School may not make sense for
the Art Department," he said.
Because there are multiple aca
demic cultures with different expec
tations, the goal of the policy is to
raise discussion about universal fac
ulty expectations, Bernstein said.
Although Bernstein doubts
the policy will be adopted by the
Faculty Senate, he believes it will
focus discussion and analysis on
what the current problems are.
"Even though the policy will
not resolve problems, it will raise
problems, offer some diagnoses
and some prescriptions," Bern
stein said.
The committee, composed of
eight faculty members and three
students, is meeting today to final
