# SCLC to discuss repeal of student speech code
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
A proposal to repeal the Grey interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard, which
stipulates a speech code for Stanford stu
dents, will be presented at today's meeting
of the Student Conduct Legislative Council.
The Grey interpretation, passed in May
1990, made it a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard to use insulting or fighting
words of a discriminatory nature aimed di
rectly at an individual or a small group of in
dividuals.
The proposal recommends removing the
interpretation entirely without replacing it
with another speech code.
If the SCLC votes on the proposal today,
and it passes, it will have to be approved by
the ASSU and Faculty Senates, then opened
to the public for comment, before it can be
enacted.
"I think the .. . salient point here right
now is that the Grey interpretation hasn't
been particularly useful for Stanford," said
SCLC member Douglas Bone, a graduate
student in electrical engineering who au
thored the proposal.
Bone argues that the code specified by
the interpretation has not been used to
prosecute violators and therefore serves no

purpose.
"In the one case that it could have been
used, it didn't apply," said SCLC member
Beth Morgan, referring to an incident last
year in which two students hurled anti-gay
slurs at a resident fellow but couldn't be
charged because the epithets were shouted
at his cottage, not at him.
However, SCLC chair John Dupre, an as
sociate professor of philosophy, said he was
"not persuaded that there is really a case de
veloped yet to make a new policy decision."
Dupre believes it is "a little premature at
this point" to decide that the interpretation
is ineffective and useless.
To many groups, including ethnic-stu
dent organizations, the Grey interpreta
tion represents a protection against dis
crimination. And students who support
the speech code don't see why it has to be
repealed just because it hasn't been used.
"[The Grey interpretation] puts out a
message for what our standards are," said
Black Student Union co-chair Allyson Dick
son.
Bone and his supporters argue, however,
that Stanford shouldn't need to have an of
ficial code to show it has high standards
against discrimination.
"Just having a speech code sug
gests that there are people who
would engage in [discriminatory]
speech (and) the only reason they
are silent is that (there is a) law,"
Bone said.
Stanford would be "better off if
people could live in a community
where people don't say offensive
and hateful things bemuse they
don't harbor those beliefs," he said.
Repealing the interpretation
would show that Stanford is real
ly a tolerant community, he said.
Jason Snyder, a member of
next year's Council of Presidents,
supports the Grey interpretation
and said he believes it is not really
the anti-discriminatory speech
code people make it out to be.
Rather, it is a statement to show

how Stanford students are expect
ed to treat each other.
At today's meeting, the SCLC's
second gathering of the year,
Bone said he plans to bring up
other points against the interpre
tation, including that its legality is
"less certain" because of a
Supreme Court case that "seemed
to outlaw G fey-type codes," at
public universities.
Although Bone's proposal
brings the speech-code issue to
the floor in the SCLC, the student
population as a whole may not
know enough about the interpre
tation to respond to its proposed
repeal, Dickson said.
An April 1992 ASSU election
referendum asked students
whether the Grey interpretation
should be rescinded, to which 45.4
percent replied "no opinion," fol
lowed by 34.4 percent answering
"yes" and 20.2 percent responding
"no."
