# SCLC to discuss repeal of student speech code
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
A proposal to repeal the Grey interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard, which
stipulates a speech code for Stanford stu
dents, will be presented at today's meeting
of the Student Conduct Legislative Council.
The Grey interpretation, passed in May
1990, made it a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard to use insulting or fighting
words of a discriminatory nature aimed di
rectly at an individual or a small group of in
dividuals.
The proposal recommends removing the
interpretation entirely without replacing it
with another speech code.
If the SCLC votes on the proposal today,
and it passes, it will have to be approved by
the ASSU and Faculty Senates, then opened
to the public for comment, before it can be
enacted.
"I think the .. . salient point here right
now is that the Grey interpretation hasn't
been particularly useful for Stanford," said
SCLC member Douglas Bone, a graduate
student in electrical engineering who au
thored the proposal.
Bone argues that the code specified by
the interpretation has not been used to
prosecute violators and therefore serves no

purpose.
"In the one case that it could have been
used, it didn't apply," said SCLC member
Beth Morgan, referring to an incident last
year in which two students hurled anti-gay
slurs at a resident fellow but couldn't be
charged because the epithets were shouted
at his cottage, not at him.
However, SCLC chair John Dupre, an as
sociate professor of philosophy, said he was
"not persuaded that there is really a case de
veloped yet to make a new policy decision."
Dupre believes it is "a little premature at
this point" to decide that the interpretation
is ineffective and useless.
To many groups, including ethnic-stu
dent organizations, the Grey interpreta
tion represents a protection against dis
crimination. And students who support
the speech code don't see why it has to be
repealed just because it hasn't been used.
"[The Grey interpretation] puts out a
message for what our standards are," said
Black Student Union co-chair Allyson Dick
son.
Bone and his supporters argue, however,
that Stanford shouldn't need to have an of
ficial code to show it has high standards
against discrimination.
