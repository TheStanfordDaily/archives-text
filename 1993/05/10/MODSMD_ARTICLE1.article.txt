# Gray on the Grey
## SCLC close to rejecting plan to abolish code 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Three members of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
voted against a proposal to repeal
the University's speech code Fri
day, jeopardizing the measure's
chances for approval.
The SCLC is awaiting the
votes of five members who were
absent from Friday's meeting of
the 10-member committee. The
proposal, which would rescind
the Grey interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard, needs
the support of all the truant
members to pass.
The absent members will give
their votes to Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole over the phone.
"It is likely that the proposal is
dead," conceded electrical engi
neering graduate student Dou
glas Bone, the proposal's author.
Passed in May 1990, the Grey
interpretation stipulated that the
use of fighting and insulting
words of a discriminatory nature
directed at an individual or group
of individuals is a violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Bone proposed the SCLC rec
ommend a removal of the Grey
interpretation, without recom
mending a new code to replace it.
If the SCLC approves the propos
al, it still must be ratified by the
ASSU and Faculty Senates, then
offered for public comment be
fore it would be official.
"We need standards of con
duct, for certain," Bone said, "but
it is not clear whether they
should be promulgated by the
University.
"I don't see Stanford students
as being so mean and vicious that
the only reason they are deterred
from using fighting words is be
cause of judicial standards,"
Bone added.
But Law Prof. Tom Grey, who
authored the current interpreta
tion, argued that the code has not
hurt interactions between mem
bers of the Stanford community.
"For moral and legal reasons,
it wouldn't be right to say every
body can say whatever they like,"
Grey said. A repeal of the code
would be a public-relations fiasco
for the University, he added.
Bone maintained that the
small number of cases in which
the interpretation has been vio
lated proves that the speech code
is unnecessary and irrelevant.
"I'd like to see Stanford go
back to the Fundamental Stan
dard" without the Grey inter
pretation, Bone said. "I expect
the number of cases will be
very small, and if [a fighting
words case] does come up, a
public debate on it would be
Levine's experiments, which
have drawn criticism from ani
mal-rights groups for several
years, are intended to increase
understanding about stress and
child development.
In his current experiments,
Levine forces some female squir
rel monkeys to forage for food. As
the food becomes increasingly
hard to find, blood samples are
taken from the monkeys to mea
sure hormone levels that indicate
stress. These monkeys are then
observed to see how much time
they spend with their children.
However, law student Nathan
Winograd, who also spoke at the
event, cited several instances
when animal testing failed. Some
drugs that were proven safe on

animals have ended up causing
cancer and birth defects in
humans, he said.
"Animal tests are dangerously
unreliable," Winograd said. "Be
careful and look hard when some
body tells you it's good for kids."
The protesters consisted main
ly of community members and
representatives of In Defense of
Animals, most carrying large
signs denouncing Levine and his
work. After the fairly low-key,
hour-long rally concluded,
demonstrators remained in the
area to pass out leaflets.
Despite the strong opinions
voiced at the rally, one member of
the animal rights group said he
felt the protest was "somewhat of
a waste of time." He said that the
speakers were preaching to peo
ple who didn't need to hear the
group's message, since most of
the participants were members of
In Defense of Animals.
