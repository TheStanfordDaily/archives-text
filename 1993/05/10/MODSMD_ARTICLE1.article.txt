# Gray on the Grey
## SCLC close to rejecting plan to abolish code 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Three members of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
voted against a proposal to repeal
the University's speech code Fri
day, jeopardizing the measure's
chances for approval.
The SCLC is awaiting the
votes of five members who were
absent from Friday's meeting of
the 10-member committee. The
proposal, which would rescind
the Grey interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard, needs
the support of all the truant
members to pass.
The absent members will give
their votes to Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole over the phone.
"It is likely that the proposal is
dead," conceded electrical engi
neering graduate student Dou
glas Bone, the proposal's author.
Passed in May 1990, the Grey
interpretation stipulated that the
use of fighting and insulting
words of a discriminatory nature
directed at an individual or group
of individuals is a violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Bone proposed the SCLC rec

interpretation, without recom
mending a new code to replace it.
If the SCLC approves the propos

"We need standards of con

University.
"I don't see Stanford students
as being so mean and vicious that
the only reason they are deterred
from using fighting words is be
cause of judicial standards,"
Bone added.
But Law Prof. Tom Grey, who
authored the current interpreta
tion, argued that the code has not
hurt interactions between mem
bers of the Stanford community.
"For moral and legal reasons,
it wouldn't be right to say every
body can say whatever they like,"
Grey said. A repeal of the code
would be a public-relations fiasco
for the University, he added.
Bone maintained that the
small number of cases in which
the interpretation has been vio
lated proves that the speech code
is unnecessary and irrelevant.
"I'd like to see Stanford go
back to the Fundamental Stan
dard" without the Grey inter
pretation, Bone said. "I expect
the number of cases will be
very small, and if [a fighting
words case] does come up, a
public debate on it would be
