# Foreign doctors protest library fee hike
## General public to be charged for Lane Medical Library accesss 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Protesting a recently announced plan to
charge non-Stanford users for access to Lane
Medical Library, a handful of foreign doctors
who live in the local area gathered at the Med
ical Center on Friday.
The doctors, who are using the library to
study for federal licensing examinations that
will allow them to practice in the United
States, were opposed to what they believed
would be a $500 fee for access to the library,
scheduled to begin July 1.
But Medical Center spokesman Don Gib
bons, who met with the angry group, said that
all the publicity regarding the new fee is mis
information, and the access-only fee is actual
ly lower.
"There is a lower set of fees for access
only," Gibbons told the group, explaining that
without borrowing privileges, the fee would be
$200 a year, or $30 a month.
Nevertheless, the eight protesting doctors
stressed that because they are not yet practic
ing, they will be unable to afford any fee.
"Our families are depending on us. Some of

us can barely make it," said Dr. Richard
Mendieta.
Others added that, as foreigners, they are
ineligible for financial aid or loans that Stan
ford students receive, and must pay the fee
out of their own pockets.
Gibbons told the doctors that hospital offi
cials understand their concerns, but the
library cannot afford to remain open for free.
In-house use has doubled in the past few years
— increasing the need for reshelving — while
at the same time, the library's tight budget
has forced officials to cut staff.
"The Medical Center is in deep financial
straits right now. Even (providing) access is a
financial burden," Gibbons said.
In addition, Gibbons pointed out that
most other private hospitals already charge
outside patrons for use of their libraries,
with fees ranging up to $1,875 a year.
According to the spokesman, other Stanford
libraries have also instituted fees outside
users. "We were the exception because we
didn't charge," he said.
But during the meeting with Gibbons, the
doctors argued that it is against medical ethics
to charge any doctor for library use.

"When we graduated, we took an oath that a
medical community is a community. We are
all colleagues," said Dr. Naheed Mangi, the
group's leader. "No doctor should have to pay
to use a medical library — it doesn't matter if
they are foreign or American. That's the bot
tom line."
Although no formal resolutions came out
of the meeting, several suggestions were pro
posed by both sides. Possibilities included
designating a separate reading room for for
eign doctors, instituting a scholarship pro
gram, and beginning a program in which
each doctor would volunteer an hour a night
to shelve books to compensate for free library
use.
Gibbons agreed to take the doctors' sugges
tions to Korn and to Lane Library Director
Peter Stengel, who will make the final deci
sion.
"The people at the Medical School are not
closed" to suggestions, Gibbons said. "They
are willing to think about options."
But Gibbons also urged the doctors not to
be impatient. "We have six weeks (until July
1), and this institution moves slowly," he
said.
