â€” Fierce Croat-Muslim fighting broke out
in Mostar yesterday despite a general cease
fire in Bosnia, and U.N. officials accused
Croats of rounding up and expelling
hundreds of Muslims from the city.
Meanwhile, the first U.N. military
observers reached the embattled Muslim
enclave of Zepa on foot after their vehi
cles were blocked by a road barricade. A
company of Ukrainian U.N. troops was
reported blocked by Bosnian Serbs en
route to Zepa, where the peacekeepers
hope to begin implementing a plan
signed late Saturday to disarm the town.
The demilitarization of Zepa and
another eastern town, Srebrenica, was
part of a cease-fire agreement signed by
Muslims and Serbs. Bosnian Croats did
not sign the pact, which went into effect

at noon yesterday.
Some two dozen truces have broken
down in the war, which began a year ago
when Bosnian Serbs rebelled against
Muslims and Croats, who voted to
secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
More than 134,000 people have been
declared dead or missing.
The Croats are nominally allied with
Muslims in the war against the Serbs,
but dream of linking Croatian-held ter
ritory in southwestern Bosnia with
Croatia proper. The easternmost border
of such a Greater Croatia would be the
Neretva River, which runs through the
center of Mostar.
U.N. spokesman Jose Gallegos said
Bosnian Croats attacked the forces of
the Muslim-led Bosnian government in
Mostar, 45 miles southwest of Sarajevo,

at dawn yesterday.
The fighting was so intense it forced
a U.N. Spanish battalion based in
Mostar to pull back to surrounding hill
sides, officials said.
By mid-afternoon, U.N. military
observers reported anti-aircraft
machine gun and small-arms fire in the
city, which was shaken by regular mor
tar hits. Several buildings, including the
Bosnian army headquarters, were
reported on fire.
John McMillan, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Sarajevo, said several apartment buildings
in Mostar had been "ethnically cleansed"
of all Muslim inhabitants. The agency had
reports that Croatian forces were planning
to deport Muslims to the towns of Zenica
and Jablanica to the north.
