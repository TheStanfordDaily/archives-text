Altering the DR system
would create confusion
and accomplish nothing

IF IT AIN'T broke, don't fix it.
This simple motto applies to
cars, most household appliances
— and the University's distribution
requirements.
While University President Ger
hard Casper's commitment to
improving undergraduate educa
tion should be applauded, his
apparent urge to revamp the distri
bution requirement system is
unnecessary and misguided.
The current DR system may not
be perfect, but it underwent an
overhaul just two short years ago
and since then it has been a gener
ally effective system to encourage
exploration and impart general
knowledge. Given this, more atten
tion should be shifted to more
pressing and neglected areas of
undergraduate education.
With the complete renumbering
and renaming of the system as well
as the addition of another require
ment under then-University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, it would
seem more productive to address
other issues such as professor
accessibility, interdepartmental
communication and the undergrad
uate advising system.
The depth vs. breadth debate has
raged for eons, and the median
between these two poles is in a con
stant state of flux. Is it useful or
necessary to alter Stanford's sys
tem with every change in leadership
or whimsical educational trend?
Stanford currently has fewer dis
tribution requirements than many
universities, as well as a system
that allows far more academic free
dom than these other schools.
For example, small liberal arts
colleges on the semester system
often have anywhere from 10 to 15
required fields of study equivalent
to Stanford's DRs, and many public
universities only allow students to

take entry-level courses for their
breadth requirements.
In contrast, Stanford's quarter
system and nine distribution require
ments allow students to experiment,
pursue double majors and write hon
ors theses well within their natural
progress toward graduation.
Furthermore, Stanford students
can take a variety of courses —
from the most basic to the most
advanced classes — to fulfill DRs,
giving them the choice to challenge
themselves in all areas, not just
their majors.
While Casper has implied the DR
system only glosses over areas of
study and does not allow in-depth
study of any of the subjects, his
plans to make undergraduate edu
cation more intensive and special
ized have remained unspecific and
do not seem to directly address this
problem.
Comprehensive study in one area
or a few related areas of study is
important, but that is the intent of
major fields of study and graduate
schools. The value of experimenta
tion and exposure to new fields of
study during the undergraduate
years must not be overlooked.
Many students have expressed
gratitude toward the DR system for
allowing them to take a worthwhile
class they otherwise would have
never considered, or even for spark
ing their interest in a field they even
tually chose as their major or career.
Meanwhile, other areas in under
graduate education cry out for
attention. The distribution require
ment debate should not be allowed
to divert attention from these more
pressing issues.
For starters, with so many classes
that are largely teacher assistant
taught and underclassman advisors
that do nothing but dole out Axess
approval codes, there should be no
shortage of areas to examine.
While distribution requirements
are an important part of under
graduate education, too many fre
quent changes start to sound a little
too much like the "new and
improved!" claims in product adver
tisements. Different does not neces
sarily mean better.
