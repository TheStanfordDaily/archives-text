## The 						children of Sisyphus 
### 
THE KEY TO the gym experience,
somebody once said, is picking up
heavy things and putting them
back down again.
But that's not all. After the
weightlifter has picked up heavy things
regularly for a period of weeks or months,
he's able to pick up heavier things. And
so on, until he can pick up really heavy
things and put them back down again,
several times in a row.
Weightlifting is a circular process —
the weightlifter lifts weights simply to lift
more weights. There are even mirrors
for the weightlifter to look at herself so
she can notice that she needs to lift more
weights. If the weightlifter notices in the
mirror that her legs need work, she can
pedal on the exercise bikes. As hard as
she pedals, though, she will go nowhere.
She knows this, but she continues to
pedal furiously on her stationary bike.
The Greek myth of Sisyphus tells of
the cruel king who was condemned forev
er to roll a boulder up a hill in Hades,
only to have it roll down again when he'd
almost reached the top. Sisyphus may be
an example of eternal suffering, but he
may also be a role model for weightlifters.
Lots of gym-goers are probably inspired
by Sisyphus who, after so many "reps" of
rock-rolling, must have amazingly well
defined quads and HUGE triceps.
For many people, weightlifting is
rewarding because it's a nice contrast to

the inactivity of their regular work rou
tines. In modern industrialized society,
where machines have taken over many
basic physical tasks like lifting, hauling
and cutting, workers are more removed
from hard, physical labor. As a result,
they feel the need for a substitute "work"
experience, and they go to the gym to
"work out."
Probably, in the old days, when big,
sweaty men working on the railroad
strained under the blazing sun to lift iron
beams and slabs of wood, none of them
turned to their exhausted co-workers at
the end of the day and asked, "Hey —
anybody up for the gym?" They'd had
enough lifting for a day. But in an office,
where workers lift paper and staplers all
day, going to the gym after work is
refreshing — it allows them to feel like
they're doing some real work.
But this is a false sense of productivi
ty. Pumping iron is a way to make up for
the physical work that has been forgotten
in the modern workplace. But unlike the
work it has replaced, weightlifting gets
nothing done. Ironically, the weightlifter
will drive his car instead of walking or
running to the gym, letting a machine do
the "practical" work of getting him some
where, so he has enough energy to lift
things when he gets there.
And when he gets there, if his gym is
on the second floor, he'll most likely take
the elevator up to it. During his workout,

though, he'll be sure to do a "set" on the
Stairmaster, a machine that simulates
walking up stairs. When he's done with
his workout, the exerciser will take the
elevator back down to his car. The next
day he'll return to repeat the process —
just like Sisyphus.
We need to restore real work to our
lives. Instead of iron plates, weight
rooms should be full of sacks of grain.
Gym-goers could load these sacks onto
trucks and ship them off somewhere. In
the corner, there might be a grove of
trees for the "weightlifter" to chop down.
His workout could consist of building a
small log cabin. After he was done, he
could shower and put his suit back on
and feel like he'd accomplished some
thing "real."
For the die-hard weight fanatics who
still refused to acknowledge their exer
cise as a substitute for real labor, and
insisted on "weightlifting for weightlift
ing's sake," there could be a big hill in the
corner with a giant boulder at the bot
tom. The weightlifters could return, day
after day, to push it almost to the top and
let it fall back down again.
