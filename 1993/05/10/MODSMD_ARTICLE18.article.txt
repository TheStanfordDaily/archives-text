Teaching of students should be University's priority

OVER THE LAST few years, I have
been continually puzzled by the
ongoing discussions surrounding
the issue of the primacy of teaching and
undergraduate education at Stanford. I
guess I've never quite understood why
we needed a University commission or a
presidential dictum to ascertain what
seems to me to be a simple fact of uni
versity life — that teaching students
should be placed at the forefront.
This characteristic of university life
seems self-evident, not solely because of
the financial investment that students
have put on the line. Nor can it simply
be evidenced by the observation that
educating students is the reason the
University was originally conceived. The
primacy of a commitment to teaching
ultimately rests in the understanding
that what really constitutes the charac
ter of a university is not its claim to
Nobel-prize winning professors or cut
ting-edge discoveries, but is instead the
people that go forth from its classrooms.
Thus, when I read The Daily's May 7
article about a "new University policy on
conflict of commitment and interest," I

decided it was time I picked up my pen
and vented the frustrations that have
been teeming in my head over the last
three years. While the policy may address
perhaps needed "red tape" technicalities
about "the requirements for disclosure of
technological achievements," its signifi
cance runs deeper than such external
concerns. That Stanford needs a written
policy to remind faculty members that
their "primary commitment of time and
intellectual energy should be to the edu
cation ... of the institution" is disturb
ing, if not outright pathetic.
Perhaps my outrage is fueled by a
naive optimism which assumes that
when people are offered the esteemed
opportunity to teach at Stanford they
acknowledge and embrace the commit
ment to education accompanying such a
position. Naive or not, the expectation
that our teachers shouldn't need some
thing in writing to command their atten
tion seems far from unreasonable.
Some may say that my emphasis on
the primacy of undergraduate education
ignores the realities of what propels a
university such as Stanford that is

entrenched in scientific scholarship.
Indeed, the proposed policy seems as
concerned with a faculty member's com
mitment to research (and making sure
Stanford's name is stamped on it) as it is
with their commitment to undergradu
ate education. There is perhaps much
truth in the arguments that Stanford is
fueled financially from its contributions
to scientific advancements, and that pro
fessors' outside involvement is what
makes a Stanford education, particularly
in the sciences, a cut above the rest. Yet
the cogency of both claims is irrelevant
if monetary benefits and outside connec
tions are not transmitted back to under
graduates through first-rate education.
In The Daily's article we're told that
one aim of the policy is to "raise discus
sion about universal faculty expecta
tions." Personally, I'm tired of discus
sions that, aside from a few token stu
dent committee members, consist of fac
ulty members going 10 rounds on an
issue in some "open" meeting — result
ing in such illuminating policies as the
one before us — that comes to the earth
shattering conclusion that faculty "owe

their primary professional allegiance to
the University."
So much for raising discussion, it's
time to raise hell. The next time you find
yourself in a class in which the teacher
seems to put as much thought and
preparation into it as you would in pick
ing your breakfast cereal, say something.
When you get the impression that a
professor is giving as much attention to
teaching as you do to the over-21 drink
ing law, say something. And I don't
mean ranking on the teacher at the end
of the quarter on those waste-of-paper
evaluations that disappear into some
closet in Old Union and are only read by
professors who are giving us their due to
begin with. Say something bold, in class,
in person.
If there are faculty members whose
interests lie elsewhere, then tell them to
go. Say something, not just because we
deserve our money's worth, but because
something in our minds worthy of atten
tion is what got us here in the first
place.
