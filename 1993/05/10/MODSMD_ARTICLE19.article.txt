# 'Mandate' illusion the possible result of new Studies questionnaire
## 
### 
I am writing in response to two let
ters submitted by M. Harrison Hsieh in
regard to the proposed Asian-American
Studies mqjor and program.
My specific contention is Mr. Hsieh's
use of the word "mandate" (in the first
letter) and his subsequent use of the
results of the Independent Survey on
Asian-American Studies. I was one of
the 1,062 students who responded to
this questionnaire, and (although I am
not an expert in polling techniques) I do

feel that the phrasing of the questions
regarding the issue of Asian-American
Studies was partly responsible for this
apparently overwhelming support for
the program.
The survey asked me whether I sup
port a program in Asian-American stud
ies and whether I support the establish
ment of a degree in this mqjor. I, like
most of the respondents, answered in
the affirmative. To do otherwise would,
at least to me, imply some sort of racism
on my part, or (and even worse) a denial
of the academic importance of my cul
tural heritage.
Yet, I am under the strong impression
that the establishment of such a degree
program could not happen without the
expenditure on the part of the Universi
ty. The Daily, in an article on the rally

last month, quoted a supporter who said
that funds would come from "untapped
resources." But, given the current fiscal
crises of this University, I would assume
that most resources would have already
been sufficiently tapped.
If the survey had asked, "Would you
pay an extra $100 in tuition for the
establishment of an Asian-American
Studies program?" or perhaps "Would
you have your department give up two
classes to free up resources for Asian-
American Studies?" I, and probably
many of the other respondents would
not have answered "yes" so quickly.
My point is that this "mandate" may
be an illusion. We may all agree on the
principle, but do we agree on its costs?
