## Powwow brings together Native American tribes 
### Johnathon Briggs Staff writer 
A rainbow of colorful feathers
swept over the intramural fields
this weekend, as hundreds of
dancers from various Indian
tribes across the country
marched and stomped in spiritu
al celebration at the 22nd annual
Stanford Powwow.
Thousands participated in
and attended the second largest
powwow in the country, which
began Friday and ended yester
day.
Sponsored by the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
the powwow was a convergence
of representatives from more
than 400 Native American tribes
in recognition of their heritage
and culture.
The powwow is traditionally
"a coming together of different
tribes for tribal power," said

freshman Trisha Moquino, an
SAIO organizer and powwow
participant. Although some
tribes do not powwow, Moquino
said the event "encompasses
everybody and all are welcome.
We dance together and pray to
gether."
Dancing to songs that are

hundreds of years old, mem
bers of different tribes per
formed together and competed
in various competitions. These
forms included traditional,
straight, fancy and jingle-dress
dances.

Powwow. Over 400 Native American tribes from all over the conti
nent were represented in the colorful exchange of costumes,
music and dance (above). After the Grand Entry, the tribes shared
in many other events, including a united prayer.
Each dance was characterized
by unique movements and color
ful costumes. For example, in the
jingle-dress dances, performers
wore multiple layers of engraved
bells dangling from their gar
ments that jingled in unison to
the singing, shouting and pound
ing drumbeats.
For many of the dancers,
dancing is not only fun, but it's a
spiritual experience. "It keeps
me strong, keeps the tradition
going, and it's part of the spiritu
al ways of Indian people," one
Paiute tribe dancer said. "I feel
the power of Mother Earth when
I dance . . . It's a release for me."
In addition to the dancing, the
powwow featured traditional
foods such as tacos and fry
bread.
In a circle of about 60 booths,
Native American families from
around the country sold tradi
tional art such as as intricate
jewelry made of various materi

als, including abalone shells, col
orful beads, birch wood, rainbow
coral and colored stones.
Other booths sold books on
Native American tribes and cus
toms, paintings and handwoven
blankets.

Moquino, whose grandparents
operate a jewelry booth, said sell
ing Native American crafts are
not only a way to support her fam
ily, but also are a way to preserv
ing their culture.
This tradition is passed on
through the generations,
Moquino said, explaining that
when she graduates from Stan
ford and enters the profession
al world, she will be expected
to carry on the jewelry-making
customs of her family.

Performers wore
multiple layers of
engraved bells dan
gling from their gar
ments.
