### Johnathon Briggs Staff writer 
A rainbow of colorful feathers
swept over the intramural fields
this weekend, as hundreds of
dancers from various Indian
tribes across the country
marched and stomped in spiritu
al celebration at the 22nd annual
Stanford Powwow.
Thousands participated in
and attended the second largest
powwow in the country, which
began Friday and ended yester
day.
Sponsored by the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
the powwow was a convergence
of representatives from more
than 400 Native American tribes
in recognition of their heritage
and culture.
The powwow is traditionally
"a coming together of different
tribes for tribal power," said

freshman Trisha Moquino, an
SAIO organizer and powwow
participant. Although some
tribes do not powwow, Moquino
said the event "encompasses
everybody and all are welcome.
We dance together and pray to
gether."
Dancing to songs that are

hundreds of years old, mem
bers of different tribes per
formed together and competed
in various competitions. These
forms included traditional,
straight, fancy and jingle-dress
dances.

music and dance (above). After the Grand Entry, the tribes shared
in many other events, including a united prayer.
