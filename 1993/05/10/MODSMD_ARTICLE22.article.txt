# The 						legitimacy of the Honor Code
## Stanford needs a student judicial board 
### Sally Cole 
WHILE WE ALL HAVE
this opportunity to think
critically about Stan
ford's Honor Code, I hope we will
consider not only the strengths
and weaknesses of the policy
itself, but also the ways in which
it is learned and enforced. In par
ticular, we should be concerned
about the lack of student and
faculty involvement and seek
ways to change that fact.
The Honor Code is, after all, a
statement about how students
and faculty conduct academic
work; it's their business, not the
business of administrators. Yet,
the current practice at Stanford
is to leave to administrators the
task of informing students and
faculty of the rules, and then
enforcing the rules when they
are broken. While the Stanford
Judicial Council (an annually
appointed body of four faculty
members and seven students)
has a nominal role in enforce
ment, the reality is that the vast
majority of Honor Code cases are
not contested by students.
Rather, the accused choose to
request a hearing with the Dean
of Students or his designee, and
the dean grants those requests.
Although individual students
who go through this process typi
cally learn a lot and grow in visi
ble and important ways, they are
not held accountable to and eval
uated by those who are most
directly hurt by their dishonesty
— fellow students and faculty.
And the learning involved in eval
uating misconduct, the struggles
between equity and compassion,

punishment and rehabilitation,
trust and doubt — these powerful
experiences are felt only by a
handful of administrators .
We are missing a lot of oppor
tunities here. Many, many
schools, from private liberal-arts
colleges to large public universi
ties, rely on panels of students,
or students and faculty, to
review individual instances of
academic dishonesty — and then
to impose sanctions or recom
mend them to a dean, provost or
president. I've met with stu
dents, faculty and staff col
leagues at a good number of
these schools, and I've heard a
lot about their experiences with
student (or student-faculty) judi
cial boards. Typically, these
schools also leave to students
and faculty the responsibility of
educating others about their
codes of conduct and encourag
ing their help in enforcing these.
With no exceptions that I can
think of, these experiences have
been positive, frequently over the
span of many decades. The role
of administrators, where there is
one, is to provide historical conti
nuity, training materials, bud
getary and clerical support and,
occasionally, the initial collection
of evidence. The educational
roles are left entirely to students
and faculty.
I believe that we have much to
learn from these alternative mod
els, and I hope that in the current
flurry of concern, we recognize
that the ways in which the rules
are learned and enforced may be
as important as the content of
the rules themselves.
