# The 						Honor Code doesn't work
## 
### Bernie Luger 
IT IS TIME FOR THE Stan
ford community to come to a
realization: the Honor Code, in
its present form, simply does not
work. Although many will resist
this notion, the public evidence is
overwhelming. There has been a
rash of reports of students cheat
ing on finals this year. Every year,
reported violations number over
40, and I'm sure that many of us
can attest to other violations on
exams (Yes, I even know graduate
students who have claimed to
cheat on exams). Clearly, the
Honor Code is not discouraging
these students from cheating; in
fact, it is probably encouraging it,

since they know that the likeli
hood of them getting caught is
very close to zero.
I am recommending the elimi
nation of the Honor Code, or at
least a drastic change in its form.
As a student, I resent other stu
dents having the license to cheat
on exams, since there is no one
there to watch them. As a teach
ing assistant, I am frustrated and
ashamed that I cannot guarantee
my honest students a fair exam.
The only way I see to change this
situation is to allow the proctor
ing of examinations.
The University's first responsi
bility is to insure the integrity of
its exams and grades, not to
assume the honor of its students.
If the first responsibility cannot
be met, then the second must be
sacrificed. Some will argue that if
students simply reported all the
cases of cheating they come in
contact with, then the code would
work. This is simply not true.
Although it is painful to admit
it, there is little we can do as
instructors and teaching assis
tants when a student reports to
us that other students are cheat
ing on their homework by copy
ing answers from other students
or an answer book. The accused
student simply denies the charge,
and we have nothing we can do.
Of course, cheating on home
work is hard to control under any
system, but cheating on tests can
be effectively controlled by using
proctors. Under the Honor Code,
if a student is cheating on an
exam and a student reports it, we

may enter the testing room to ver
ify these reports. Of course, only
the densest students would con
tinue to cheat when the teaching
assistant enters the room and
starts to watch them, but they
have already gotten an advantage.
On the other hand, if the teaching
assistant or instructor is already
present, then the students are dis
couraged from cheating.
One might argue that this will
not prevent students from trying.
This is true. But it will increase
the likelihood of them getting
caught, which brings me to my
second point: the University
should expel any student who is
shown, beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of their peers, that he
or she was cheating on an exami
nation. Period. No exceptions.
Some will make the argument
that extenuating circumstances
caused the student to attempt to
cheat, such as extreme pressure
from parents. Frankly, I don't
care. Moral prerogatives should
always come first, no matter who
is putting the pressure on you (I
would never make it as a politi
cian).
Next, some would argue that
the University would expel stu
dents wrongly; that is, students
who were falsely accused. I doubt
that. In order to show that a stu
dent was cheating, beyond a rea
sonable doubt, one of two things
would need to be shown: that the
student had illegal notes or
access to a book during a closed
book exam, or that the student
has had a previous record of

cheating on exams.
The first is fairly cut and dry.
If a student has a set of illegal
notes, he or she is clearly cheat
ing, and nothing more needs to
be said.
The second is more complex.
Obviously, if a student is accused
of copying from another's paper
during an exam, and he or she
denies the charge, in absence of
other evidence, the student could
not be found to have been cheat
ing beyond a reasonable doubt.
But what if students come for
ward to testify that this student
had cheated on other exams? Or
what if the student has been
accused habitually? These areas
are obviously murky, but it would
be very difficult to expel students
with this evidence. In absence of
evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt, intermediate steps could
be taken. The student could be
made to take all exams in the
front of the testing room for the
rest of his career. This wouldn't
reflect in his or her transcript,
and if the student is in fact hon
est, no harm will come of it, to
the student or anyone else.
The details of what should be
done to those accused is unim
portant for my argument; the
main thrust of it is that the
Honor Code just simply does not
work. We, the students, asked
for this Honor Code, and we,
the students, should ask to get
rid of it.
