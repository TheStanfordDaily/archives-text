# Answering to students
## 
### Gabe Lucas 
IF YOU ASKED ME about the Honor Code, then
I'd ask you back, what is the Honor Code? It's
more than just words we adhere to as we sign an
exam.
A friend of mine who graduated this winter was
mistakenly mailed a spring Stanford ID. The regis
trar's office told him to tear it up. He would be vio
lating the Honor Code if he used it to get into the
library or to see a baseball game.
I recently learned that some professors prohibit
Lecture Notes in their classes. They feel that the
notes discourage attendance, a necessary "require
ment." It seems as if they are bypassing the unwrit
ten honor code that students will go to class.
This raises two interestiiig questions.
First, how far should professors go to enforce
their demands? I am disheartened by the policy to
ban lecture notes, when it clearly frustrates the
overall learning process. The only class for which I
have ever bought notes was one that I always went
to, because I wanted a backup whenever the lec
tures moved too quickly. It's sad when distrust of
students winds up hurting them.
And in general, is enforcement of attendance
the right step to take? Perhaps, if you do not con
sider it to be an "unusual and unreasonable"
measure.
On the other hand, we have an honor code,
which allegedly conveys the University's feeling
that students are responsible enough for their own
education. Unlike cheating, where innocent stu
dents are affected, if you don't go to class, that
won't hurt others. It's ironic that professors who
demand innovative, thought-provoking arguments

have no faith that the authors of these mature
papers would attend a discussion of the material.
It might seem as if I am unnecessarily complain
ing about a well-intentioned and effective policy.
But I hasten to point out that it stands out against
the winds of individualism on this campus. Stan
ford students are internally focused. From insis
tence on line-item fee-refunds to opposition of dis
tribution requirements, we disfavor affiliation with
a group and want to promote development of indi
vidual choices and freedom.
That is supposedly how the Honor Code fits com
fortably into our scheme of things. If you cheat, you
must deal with it yourself, for that is whom you've
always had to ultimately answer to, since your
arrival freshman year. For a section leader to lower
your grade because you missed two sections doesn't
make much sense. And as evidenced by its inability
to prosecute the publicized cheaters of last winter,
the University seems disinclined to assume any
responsibility for the behavior of its students.
But the Honor Code remains a vague reminder
of social condemnation. Students race by on the
tracks of pre-business, pre-med and pre-law so fast
that they overlook their role in the Stanford com
munity. As much as we favor internal conse
quences, we must not assume that our actions are
isolated events affecting only ourselves.
Unfortunately, it seems the only way to remind
someone of "the other people out there" is for those
other people to punish them, and thereby abandon
the principles of trust and individualism by which
we live day to day.
