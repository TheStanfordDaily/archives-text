# Keeping the code alive
## 
### John Bravman 
1 HAPPENED TO BE IN Washington, D.C. last
week and took the opportunity of a long lunch
break to visit the National Archives. I had
never been there before and wanted to see our
nation's founding documents: the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.
I dutifully waited in line outside, passed
through the metal detector (how ironic, I
thought), and then queued up to pass by the
glass cases. When there is a crowd, as there was
that day, you don't have much time to linger,
but I had enough of a chance to discover that all
three documents, and especially the Declaration,
are physically in very bad shape — so much so
that it is almost impossible to read them. I had
no idea that this was so (Turns out that they
were poorly cared for until 1952, with the Decla
ration once spending 35 years hanging in the
sunlight . . . brilliant!). Well, I thought, it's
quite sad that these parchments are so degrad
ed, but it really doesn't matter. What does most
emphatically matter, though, is the condition of
the freedoms they decl&re, the state of the gov
ernment they describe and, most importantly,
the condition of the people — us — that they
speak to. Unlike, say, a piece of art, it's not the
documents that are precious, it's the ideas con
tained within them that make them worthy of
our care.
In a similar fashion, so it is with Stanford's
Honor Code and Fundamental Standard. For me,
any discussion on these must start with an exami
nation of the ideas which motivated both their
authors (original intent) and successive genera
tions of Stanford's citizens, and must be followed
by a decision as to whether or not those ideas still
have the power to illuminate, to captivate and to
motivate.
It seems to me that the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standard articulate, at the deepest
levels, the Stanford ethos. "Students, we treat you
like adults. We don't send your grades to mom and

dad, neither do we send them your bills. Resident
Fellows are not live-in police. There is no campus
curfew. You have rights, and you have responsibili
ties. In short, we trust you."
What is our collective response? If the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard have fallen on
hard times, as I understand many to say they
have, then who is going to do what about it? We
can abandon them, as many have tried to aban
don the Declaration, or, worse, through cow
ardice, to subvert it; or we, as what I believe is
the vast majority, can firmly declare, through

word and deed, that we find in these documents
enduring value, and that we are ready to preserve
them for ourselves and for our posterity here on
the Farm.
Again, as with our nation's founding docu
ments, and all of the laws wh'ich proceed from
them, implementation is not trivial. Democracy,
after all, is often inefficient and messy. We are
all aware, for instance, of the mighty struggles
centered around agreeing upon, and then guar
anteeing, the codified rights of American citi
zens. So it will be here, at Stanford, with the
Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard. The
price may be high. Are you willing to pay it?
When, and only when, we can answer "yes," can
we move on to discuss the hows, whens and whos
of keeping the ideas in the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standard alive. If we do not, Stan
ford will be a far poorer place to study, to work
and to live.
