## Baseball kills playoff hopes, drops two in Cal series Stanford wins final game 6-4 behind Reed's pitching, Olmstead's hitting; Cardinal holds on to last place in Six-Pac 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It was just another up-and
down weekend for the excitingly
inconsistent Stanford baseball
team.
The Cardinal (24-24 overall,
9-18 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) dropped the
first two games of a three-game
set with California (27-30, 13-
17), putting to rest even the
most far-fetched hopes of a
Stanford NCAA playoff bid.

California needed a
sweep of the Cardi
nal to keep its own
slim playoff chances
alive. Three wins
against Stanford
would have given the
Bears a final Six-Pac
record of 14-16.

Yesterday, however, the
tables were turned on Cal. The
Cardinal won its first Sunday
Six-Pac game of the season, 6-4,
to spoil any Golden Bear post
season aspirations.
Coming into the weekend,
Stanford was a respectable 8-8
behind starting pitchers Willie
Adams, who starts on Fridays,
and Andrew Lorraine, who
starts on Saturdays. In Sunday
games, the Cardinal had gone 0-
8 using a score of hurlers.
They put that statistic to rest
this weekend.
On Friday, Cal got on the
board early. Third baseman
Andy Tarpley took advantage of
a two-out Cardinal error,
putting the Bears up 3-0 in the
third with a three-run shot to
left field.
Adams, who was stricken
with the flu last weekend at Ari
zona State, left Friday's game at
Sunken Diamond with the score
tied at five in the sixth inning. It
was the junior's shortest confer
ence outing of the season.

Later in the same inning, the
count was 10-6 Cal when Stan
ford's Dusty Allen hit a 2-0 Mike
Cather offering off the score
board in left field. Allen's two
run blast, his fifth of the season,
brought the Cardinal within
two. Nate Olmstead followed
Allen with a single, scoring two
batters later on a wild pitch and
narrowing the Bear lead to 10-9.
But Cal used the longball
again in the seventh. Tarpley
and first baseman Mark Palfalvi
both connected for two-run
home runs off Stanford reliever
Mario Iglesias in the inning, and
the Bears cruised to a 15-10 win.
Lorraine, coming off perhaps
his best start of the season last
weekend at Arizona State, took
the mound Saturday at Evans
Diamond in Berkeley. But five
Cardinal errors led to four
unearned runs, as Stanford lost
8-5.
Down 5-2 going into the sev
enth, Stanford scored three
times in the top of the frame,
with catcher A.J. Hinch's two
out, two-run home run provid
ing the brunt of the offense.
But the Bears retook the lead
in the bottom of the inning,
scoring a run when Stanford
second baseman Todd Laßocca
threw wide to second on a two
out fielder's choice. A pair of
eighth-inning doubles put the
icing on the Cal win.
California needed a sweep of
the Cardinal to keep its own
slim playoff chances alive. Three
wins against Stanford would
have given the Bears a final Six-
Pac record of 14-16 — the same
record they had last season
when Cal coach/NCAA Selection
Committee member Bob Milano
nominated his own team for a
bid.
Things looked good for the
Bears going into yesterday's
game. Freshman Dan Reed, win
less in three previous conference
starts, took the hill for Stan
ford.
For the past week, Reed has
been working with Cardinal
assistant coach Dean Stotz on
an adjustment in his follow
through which would enable
him to keep his body, and the
ball, lower in the strike zone.
"Like most sports, pitching's

a feeling thing," said Stotz.
"Things you try to change have
to come naturally. We just keep
tinkering with Dan."
"I've been a little inconsis
tent, so we made a few adjust-

ments," said Reed. "I did well
when I kept the ball down in the
strike zone."
The freshman got off to a
rocky start, giving up a pair of
runs in the first and an
unearned run in the second on a
Steve Carver error. Carver, who
started at third both Saturday
and yesterday after Dallimore's
injury, committed three errors
in the series.
"To be fair to Steve, we
haven't played him at third all

that much this year," said Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess. "He
came back and made some big
plays for us, too."
Carver got the Cardinal on
the board with a solo home run
in the bottom of the second, his
second blast of the series.
But the sophomore made his
biggest play in the third. After
Cal slugger Nate Brown tripled
to deep center field, Reed Aljian
bounced a sharp grounder to
Carver at third.
Carver froze Brown in his
tracks between third base and
home plate, nailing him with a
throw to Hinch.
Meanwhile, Hinch caught
Aljian in a rundown between
first and second base to com
plete an unlikely double play.
"That was the key to the
game for us," said Marquess.
Olmstead, moved to the
cleanup spot in the lineup yes
terday for the first time this sea
son, responded with three runs
batted in and his first home run
of the season.
"It felt really good to catch
one on the barrel," said Olm
stead, who has seen his average
rise almost 100 points to .294
over the past 12 games.

Olmstead, expected to be a
major cog in the Stanford
offense this season, sat out six
weeks with a severely sprained
ankle.
"We've missed Nate," said
Marquess. "We could have used
that power and that switch-hit
ting bat in the middle of our
lineup."
Reed, whose longest previous
outing was a seven-inning stint
against Fresno State, went the
distance yesterday, scattering
11 hits.
"Reed's performance was the
highlight of the day," said Mar
quess. "A win like this is so big
for him, in terms of the future."
