# Track and field lumps over Bears
## Women's team outdistances California, men shine individually 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Yesterday, the Stanford track
and field team showed all the pos
itive signs of its rebuilding year,
as the women narrowly defeated
visiting California 74-71 at Stan
ford Stadium. The men also had
an impressive outing, but fell to
the Golden Bears 103-60. The
Bears extended their Big Meet
winning streak to 21-consecutive
titles.
The highlight of the meet for
Stanford was the individual per
formance turned in by rookie
Rene Rodriguez in the 400 meters
and the 4 x 400 relay.
Running in scorching heat,
Rodriguez set a blistering 46.46
second pace in the 400 to take not
only the race, but the meet
record, the Cardinal freshman
record and an NCAA provisional
qualifying mark.
"I had nothing left at the end
of that race," Rodriguez said. "My
start was a little tight, but my
coach and I have been working on
relaxing through the last turn
and getting the hind-knee action
going. That's exactly what I did,
and it worked."
After that stellar performance,
Rodriguez came back to anchor a
team of Travis Clark, John Price
and Mike Hochstetler, who scored
an emotional victory in the 4 x
400. Handed the baton with a
seemingly insurmountable 15-
meter deficit, Rodriguez turned
on the after-burners in the last
quarter lap to catch Cal's anchor
Reggie Williams and leave him in
the dust, winning the race by 10
meters.
"I pride myself on affiliating
track with my religious beliefs,"
Rodriguez said. "With Jesus
Christ by my side nothing's
impossible, not even being behind
by 15 meters."
Nothing was impossible for the
Cardinal women either, as they
were led by the dominating per

formances of Jen McCormick,
Debbie Templeton and Jessica
Alderman in the javelin. The trio
swept the top-three places, with
McCormick leading the pack after
a lifetime best throw of 157 feet,
one inch on her first attempt.
Stanford also whitewashed its
Cal rivals in the 1,500 meters, as
Dena Dey, Melissa Freeburg and
Kay Luo raced to a one-two-three
finish in that event. Dey posted a
season best 4:34.30 seconds, fol
lowed by Freeburg at 4:35.81 and
Luo at 4:37.62. Luo's time signi
fies her first Pacific 10 Confer
ence qualifying mark of the sea
son.
Dey and Freeburg later teamed
up with freshman Marjorie Hsu
to blank the Cal runners in the
800 as well. Hsu ran a season best
2:16.06 behjnd Freeburg's
2:14.56 performance and Dey's
2:14.24 clocking.
When the women did not
sweep, they managed to hold
down the first- and third-place
finishes in their events. Junior
distance-specialist Louise Watson
outdistanced the field in the 3,000
with a 9:59.24 and was followed
by teammate Nicole Freedman in
third place (10:45.26).
"We had an awesome perfor
mance on the women's side
today," Watson said. "Every time
you turn around, Stanford is
occupying the top places in every
event. People were running really
competitively, which is what Big
Meet is all about."
The women's scoring deluge
continued in the 100 hurdles, as
Christy Boyd and Ann Lee
teamed up for a first-and third
place finish, with times of 14.40
and 15.26, respectively. Rhonda
Oliver (12.05) and Jackie Bridge
man (12.62) also turned in the
same first and third combination
in the 100 fiat.
Other outstanding perfor
mances included Kathy Unruh's

first-place finish in the high jump
with a leap of 5-7, and Oliver's blaz
ing 23.8 showing in the 200, an
NCAA provisional qualifying mark.
The men fared equally well on
the track, with Mike Reilly blowing
his opponents out of the water in
the 3,000 steeplechase. Reilly took
the lead for good with five laps
remaining and won by half a lap,
with a time of 9:10.53.
"For as long as I can remember
we have always won the
steeplechase in the Big Meet," Reil
ly said. "So it was nice to keep that
tradition going for the underclass
men on this team."
Sophomore Tovi Abello also
stretched himself to the limit as he
raced Cal's Peter Simmons to a
dead heat in the 110 hurdles. Mean
while, in the pit, pole vaulter Jamie
Marek cleared his final height at 16-
0 3/4 to take the gold in that event.
In the 5,000, senior Dave Scud
amore left the field behind, as he
sprinted to a 14:53.40 finish. Scud
amore's effort was then followed by
a valiant performance by Cardinal
freshman Mikel Jollett, who made
up a 20-meter deficit on the final

stretch to beat out the Bears' Mark
Douglas for the second-place posi
tion.

Stanford has been victorious in
the 5,000 for five-consecutive years
according to Scudamore. "It's the
third year in a row that I've won
this race at Big Meet, and Cal has
never had much of a distance team
to counter ours," he said. "Dis
tances is where we've been strong,
traditionally. In the future we'll
stay strong in the distances and
probably get stronger in other
events as well."
The Cardinal men and women
are definitely showing signs of
future championship teams with
yesterday's Big Meet performance.
"I had us projected as being
behind on the women's side by 12
points," coach Lananna said. "At
the beginning of the meet I saw us
as coming in four points behind
them. Our performance proved me
wrong, because our athletes exceed
ed expectations in every area of the
meet.
"For the men, Cal definitely has
the better team right now, but I
think Stanford will be the team of
the future. We gave all the indica
tions of it today, and we'll continue
to improve on what we have. Right
now we have great momentum
coming out of this meet."

men on this team."
Sophomore Tovi Abello also
stretched himself to the limit as he
raced Cal's Peter Simmons to a
dead heat in the 110 hurdles. Mean
while, in the pit, pole vaulter Jamie
Marek cleared his final height at 16-
0 3/4 to take the gold in that event.
In the 5,000, senior Dave Scud
amore left the field behind, as he
sprinted to a 14:53.40 finish. Scud
amore's effort was then followed by
a valiant performance by Cardinal
freshman Mikel Jollett, who made
up a 20-meter deficit on the final

stretch to beat out the Bears' Mark
Douglas for the second-place posi
tion.

Stanford has been victorious in
the 5,000 for five-consecutive years
according to Scudamore. "It's the
third year in a row that I've won
this race at Big Meet, and Cal has
never had much of a distance team
to counter ours," he said. "Dis
tances is where we've been strong,
traditionally. In the future we'll
stay strong in the distances and
probably get stronger in other
events as well."
The Cardinal men and women
are definitely showing signs of
future championship teams with
yesterday's Big Meet performance.
"I had us projected as being
behind on the women's side by 12
points," coach Lananna said. "At
the beginning of the meet I saw us
as coming in four points behind
them. Our performance proved me
wrong, because our athletes exceed
ed expectations in every area of the
meet.
"For the men, Cal definitely has
the better team right now, but I
think Stanford will be the team of
the future. We gave all the indica
tions of it today, and we'll continue
to improve on what we have. Right
now we have great momentum
coming out of this meet."
Yesterday, the Stanford track
and field team showed all the pos
itive signs of its rebuilding year,
as the women narrowly defeated
visiting California 74-71 at Stan
ford Stadium. The men also had
an impressive outing, but fell to
the Golden Bears 103-60. The
Bears extended their Big Meet
winning streak to 21-consecutive
titles.
The highlight of the meet for
Stanford was the individual per
formance turned in by rookie
Rene Rodriguez in the 400 meters
and the 4 x 400 relay.
Running in scorching heat,
Rodriguez set a blistering 46.46
second pace in the 400 to take not
only the race, but the meet
record, the Cardinal freshman
record and an NCAA provisional
qualifying mark.
"I had nothing left at the end
of that race," Rodriguez said. "My
start was a little tight, but my
coach and I have been working on
relaxing through the last turn
and getting the hind-knee action
going. That's exactly what I did,
and it worked."
After that stellar performance,
Rodriguez came back to anchor a
team of Travis Clark, John Price
and Mike Hochstetler, who scored
an emotional victory in the 4 x
400. Handed the baton with a
seemingly insurmountable 15-
meter deficit, Rodriguez turned
on the after-burners in the last
quarter lap to catch Cal's anchor
Reggie Williams and leave him in
the dust, winning the race by 10
meters.
"I pride myself on affiliating
track with my religious beliefs,"
Rodriguez said. "With Jesus
Christ by my side nothing's
impossible, not even being behind
by 15 meters."
Nothing was impossible for the
Cardinal women either, as they
were led by the dominating per

formances of Jen McCormick,
Debbie Templeton and Jessica
Alderman in the javelin. The trio
swept the top-three places, with
McCormick leading the pack after
a lifetime best throw of 157 feet,
one inch on her first attempt.
Stanford also whitewashed its
Cal rivals in the 1,500 meters, as
Dena Dey, Melissa Freeburg and
Kay Luo raced to a one-two-three
finish in that event. Dey posted a
season best 4:34.30 seconds, fol
lowed by Freeburg at 4:35.81 and
Luo at 4:37.62. Luo's time signi
fies her first Pacific 10 Confer
ence qualifying mark of the sea
son.
Dey and Freeburg later teamed
up with freshman Marjorie Hsu
to blank the Cal runners in the
800 as well. Hsu ran a season best
2:16.06 behjnd Freeburg's
2:14.56 performance and Dey's
2:14.24 clocking.
When the women did not
sweep, they managed to hold
down the first- and third-place
finishes in their events. Junior
distance-specialist Louise Watson
outdistanced the field in the 3,000
with a 9:59.24 and was followed
by teammate Nicole Freedman in
third place (10:45.26).
"We had an awesome perfor
mance on the women's side
today," Watson said. "Every time
you turn around, Stanford is
occupying the top places in every
event. People were running really
competitively, which is what Big
Meet is all about."
The women's scoring deluge
continued in the 100 hurdles, as
Christy Boyd and Ann Lee
teamed up for a first-and third
place finish, with times of 14.40
and 15.26, respectively. Rhonda
Oliver (12.05) and Jackie Bridge
man (12.62) also turned in the
same first and third combination
in the 100 fiat.
Other outstanding perfor
mances included Kathy Unruh's

first-place finish in the high jump
with a leap of 5-7, and Oliver's blaz
ing 23.8 showing in the 200, an
NCAA provisional qualifying mark.
The men fared equally well on
the track, with Mike Reilly blowing
his opponents out of the water in
the 3,000 steeplechase. Reilly took
the lead for good with five laps
remaining and won by half a lap,
with a time of 9:10.53.
"For as long as I can remember
we have always won the
steeplechase in the Big Meet," Reil
ly said. "So it was nice to keep that
tradition going for the underclass
men on this team."
Sophomore Tovi Abello also
stretched himself to the limit as he
raced Cal's Peter Simmons to a
