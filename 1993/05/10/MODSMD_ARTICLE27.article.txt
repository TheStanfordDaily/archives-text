# Track and field lumps over Bears
## Women's team outdistances California, men shine individually 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Yesterday, the Stanford track
and field team showed all the pos
itive signs of its rebuilding year,
as the women narrowly defeated
visiting California 74-71 at Stan
ford Stadium. The men also had
an impressive outing, but fell to
the Golden Bears 103-60. The
Bears extended their Big Meet
winning streak to 21-consecutive
titles.
The highlight of the meet for
Stanford was the individual per
formance turned in by rookie
Rene Rodriguez in the 400 meters
and the 4 x 400 relay.
Running in scorching heat,
Rodriguez set a blistering 46.46
second pace in the 400 to take not
only the race, but the meet
record, the Cardinal freshman
record and an NCAA provisional
qualifying mark.
"I had nothing left at the end
of that race," Rodriguez said. "My
start was a little tight, but my
coach and I have been working on
relaxing through the last turn
and getting the hind-knee action
going. That's exactly what I did,
and it worked."
After that stellar performance,
Rodriguez came back to anchor a
team of Travis Clark, John Price
and Mike Hochstetler, who scored
an emotional victory in the 4 x
400. Handed the baton with a
seemingly insurmountable 15-
meter deficit, Rodriguez turned
on the after-burners in the last
quarter lap to catch Cal's anchor
Reggie Williams and leave him in
the dust, winning the race by 10
meters.
"I pride myself on affiliating
track with my religious beliefs,"
Rodriguez said. "With Jesus
Christ by my side nothing's
impossible, not even being behind
by 15 meters."
Nothing was impossible for the
Cardinal women either, as they
were led by the dominating per

formances of Jen McCormick,
Debbie Templeton and Jessica
Alderman in the javelin. The trio
swept the top-three places, with
McCormick leading the pack after
a lifetime best throw of 157 feet,
one inch on her first attempt.
Stanford also whitewashed its
Cal rivals in the 1,500 meters, as
Dena Dey, Melissa Freeburg and
Kay Luo raced to a one-two-three
finish in that event. Dey posted a
season best 4:34.30 seconds, fol
lowed by Freeburg at 4:35.81 and
Luo at 4:37.62. Luo's time signi
fies her first Pacific 10 Confer
ence qualifying mark of the sea
son.
Dey and Freeburg later teamed
up with freshman Marjorie Hsu
to blank the Cal runners in the
800 as well. Hsu ran a season best
2:16.06 behjnd Freeburg's
2:14.56 performance and Dey's
2:14.24 clocking.
When the women did not
sweep, they managed to hold
down the first- and third-place
finishes in their events. Junior
distance-specialist Louise Watson
outdistanced the field in the 3,000
with a 9:59.24 and was followed
by teammate Nicole Freedman in
third place (10:45.26).
"We had an awesome perfor
mance on the women's side
today," Watson said. "Every time
you turn around, Stanford is
occupying the top places in every
event. People were running really
competitively, which is what Big
Meet is all about."
The women's scoring deluge
continued in the 100 hurdles, as
Christy Boyd and Ann Lee
teamed up for a first-and third
place finish, with times of 14.40
and 15.26, respectively. Rhonda
Oliver (12.05) and Jackie Bridge
man (12.62) also turned in the
same first and third combination
in the 100 fiat.
Other outstanding perfor
mances included Kathy Unruh's
