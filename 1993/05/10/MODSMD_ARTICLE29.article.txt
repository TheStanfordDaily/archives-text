# Men's crew sinks UCLA in Newport Beach race
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Fighting off changing tides and a
pesky UCLA boat in the varsity eight
race, the Stanford men's crew team
closed out its regular season with a vic
torious weekend of racing at the New
port Regatta in Newport Beach, Calif.
The Cardinal varsity eight, not
expected to be challenged this weekend,
was forced to row one of its best races
of the year to hold off the Bruins. Stan
ford won the race with a time of 6 min
utes, four seconds, edging UCLA by
four seconds.
"We didn't expect much [competi
tion] in the varsity race," said men's
coach Wieslaw Kujda. "Luckily, UCLA
gave us a good race. This sort of sur
prise can shake you up and test your
confidence."
Earlier in the season, Stanford had
difficulty rising to the occasion, as
shown by the disappointing eighth
place outing at the San Diego Crew
Classic. This weekend's strong finish
proves that the Cardinal rowers are
back on the right track.

"I knew we were going to have good
fast races," Kujda said. "We needed
good performances, and that's what we
got."
Competing at partial strength, the
varsity four came in sixth, 18 seconds
behind co-winners San Diego State and
Orange Coast College. Matt Weolburn,
suffering from a stomach virus all
week, was kept out of practice until Fri
day and still wasn't 100 percent for the
race.
The junior-varsity eight provided the
most exciting race of the weekend in its
one-length victory over Orange Coast
College. Slightly behind at the halfway
mark of the 2,000-meter course, the
Cardinal pulled ahead over the last
1,000 meters to win in 6:04.1. Orange
Coast crossed the finish line at 6:07.4
The novice and freshman eights did
not fare as well as the more experienced
rowers. The novice boat finished last,
30 seconds behind Orange Coast's win
ning time of 6:03. The freshman boat
was close for the first 1,000 meters but
couldn't keep up the pace, finishing 12
seconds behind Orange Coast.
"It was a pretty good effort,
but the freshipan haven't fig
ured out how to shift gears for
the last 1,000 meters," Kujda
said. "They have the potential
to go faster. I think they can
take anybody."
Kujda was pleased with
nearly every boat's effort over
the weekend.
UC-Santa Barbara also
raced in Newport this weekend,
and a comparison of race times
between the Cardinal and the
Gauchos shows a steady
improvement by Stanford.
Defeating Santa Barbara by
only five seconds earlier in the
year, the Cardinal pushed that
margin to 13 seconds at New
port.
Looking ahead to the Pacific
Coast Championships in two
weeks, Kujda is optimistic
about his team's chances to
advance to the finals. Going in
as the third seed, Stanford will
avoid top-seeded Washington
and California until later
rounds.
