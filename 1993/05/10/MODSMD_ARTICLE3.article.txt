# Stanford to pilot national service
## Haas Center to coordinate recruiting for local program 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Stanford has been chosen as
one of a handful of universities
nationwide to participate in a pilot
program for President Clinton's
recently unveiled national service
project.
The summer pilot program is
seen as a kick-off for Clinton's ser
vice plan, which would allow stu
dents to repay college loans by
performing community service
work.
"This is laying the groundwork
for the expansion of national ser
vice to help train future leaders
and teach the value of public ser
vice," said Catherine Milton, the
former director of the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service. She is now
the executive director of Clinton's
Commission on National Commu
nity Service.
A total of 1,500 students na
tionwide are expected to partici
pate in the pilot program.

Stanford's Haas Center for
Public Service and UC-Berkeley
will serve as the program's two
hubs in the Bay Area. Oakland's
East Bay Conservation Corps
spearheaded the effort to bring
the program to the two universi
ties.
The Bay Area program will be
the largest of the 11 trial pro
grams nationwide. It is slated to
receive the largest grant of any of
the pilot sites, and will recruit 250
youths, ages 17-25, to work in one
of six local health and education
service programs that serve at
risk children throughout Oak
land, Berkeley and East Palo Alto.
According to Joanna Lennon,
director of the East Bay Conserva
tion Corps, the amount of the
grant has not been finalized, but
the total budget is expected to be
$1-1.5 million.
The Bay Area effort includes
six small programs: three commu
nity-based and three that are run
through Stanford's Haas Center.
Learning Through Technology,
run by the Boys' and Girls' Club,
Center for a New Generation, and
Ravenswood City School District
are the community programs.
The three Stanford-based pro
grams are Stanford Upward
Bound, East Palo Alto/Stanford
University Summer Academy and
SOAR (Students Offering Alterna
tive Realities), which were all
developed by Stanford students.
Each of these local programs
participating in the "Summer of
Service" will receive a portion of
the grant to hire participants, who
will earn minimum wage and then
receive an extra $1,000 at the end
of the summer to go toward col
lege or vocational school.
"We were very happy" about
being able to participate in the
program, said senior Tracy Clay,
one of the SOAR organizers.
"We're a very new program and
don't have continual funding yet.
The funding and the donation of
time is really important for us."
The Haas Center will be
responsible for coordinating the
recruitment of all college student
participants. The program will be
open to Stanford students, as well
as students from East Palo Alto
and local community colleges.
Applications for the summer pro
gram are currently available at the
Haas Center and are due May 19.
Stanford's involvement in the
pilot service program will "be a
great thing," said Dave Kuhn,
director of the Stanford Project
on National Service.
"I'm very excited about it,"he
continued. "This summer itself
will provide ammunition for the
administration" in pushing the
service plan through Congress,
Kuhn said, adding that the suc
cess of this summer's program
will help give next year's initia
tive a boost.
The Bay Area grant proposal
was submitted by the conserva
tion corps. In order to receive a
grant, service organizations had
to identify an institution of high
er education it would work with.
Joanna Lennon, director of the
East Bay Conservation Corps,
said it was natural to invite the
Haas Center's participation when
designing the non-profit group's

proposal.
"I had a good relationship with
Catherine Milton," she said. "I
knew the folks at Haas really
knew the point of this, so when I
saw the requirement of working
with an institution of higher edu
cation, I immediately called
Haas."
Participating students will
make a nine-and-a-half week
commitment — one week of
training, eight weeks of service,
and a tentative national or
regional summit at the end of the
summer.
"I'm very excited about the
program," said Sue Gray, a pro
gram coordinator at the Haas
Center. "It will be an opportunity
for Stanford students to get
involved in community service
and to be guinea pigs and leaders
for this program."
She added that she thinks the
Haas Center was selected over
other Bay Area colleges and uni
versities because it has a strong
nationwide reputation as a leader
in public service.
Summer of Service will cost the
government $8.8 million, and will
serve as an test of Clinton's pro
posed nation service youth corps.
Next year, $400 million will be
spent to place 25,000 students in
community service work. By 1997,
an estimated 150,000 youths are
slated to become involved.
Participating students would
get $5,000 each year for tuition,
fees or loans for up to two years of
community service. In addition,
workers would get minimum
wage compensation for their sum
mertime labor.
"I think both supporters and
skeptics want to see the effect on
the community and on young peo
ple and whether it is cost-effec
tive," Gray said.
Milton stressed that she was
not involved in the decision to
include Stanford in the pilot pro
gram. She said outside peer
reviewers and the national com
mission's board of directors made
the selection.
"I'm very happy that Stanford
was chosen and I think it's a tes
tament to the work of the Haas
Center," she said.
Lennon said this summer's
outcome may determine the
future of the service program.
"We have the opportunity of a
lifetime now, and we're ready to
show how young people can deal
with social issues and be con
scious," she said.

tion Corps, the amount of the
grant has not been finalized, but
the total budget is expected to be
$1-1.5 million.
The Bay Area effort includes
six small programs: three commu
nity-based and three that are run
through Stanford's Haas Center.
Learning Through Technology,
run by the Boys' and Girls' Club,
Center for a New Generation, and
Ravenswood City School District
are the community programs.
The three Stanford-based pro
grams are Stanford Upward
Bound, East Palo Alto/Stanford
University Summer Academy and
SOAR (Students Offering Alterna
tive Realities), which were all
developed by Stanford students.
Each of these local programs
participating in the "Summer of
Service" will receive a portion of
the grant to hire participants, who
will earn minimum wage and then
receive an extra $1,000 at the end
of the summer to go toward col
lege or vocational school.
"We were very happy" about
being able to participate in the
program, said senior Tracy Clay,
one of the SOAR organizers.
"We're a very new program and
don't have continual funding yet.
The funding and the donation of
time is really important for us."
The Haas Center will be
responsible for coordinating the
recruitment of all college student
participants. The program will be
open to Stanford students, as well
as students from East Palo Alto
and local community colleges.
Applications for the summer pro
gram are currently available at the
Haas Center and are due May 19.
Stanford's involvement in the
pilot service program will "be a
great thing," said Dave Kuhn,
director of the Stanford Project
on National Service.
"I'm very excited about it,"he
continued. "This summer itself
will provide ammunition for the
administration" in pushing the
service plan through Congress,
Kuhn said, adding that the suc
cess of this summer's program
will help give next year's initia
tive a boost.
The Bay Area grant proposal
was submitted by the conserva
tion corps. In order to receive a
grant, service organizations had
to identify an institution of high
er education it would work with.
Joanna Lennon, director of the
East Bay Conservation Corps,
said it was natural to invite the
Haas Center's participation when
designing the non-profit group's

proposal.
"I had a good relationship with
Catherine Milton," she said. "I
knew the folks at Haas really
knew the point of this, so when I
saw the requirement of working
with an institution of higher edu
cation, I immediately called
Haas."
Participating students will
make a nine-and-a-half week
commitment — one week of
training, eight weeks of service,
and a tentative national or
regional summit at the end of the
summer.
"I'm very excited about the
program," said Sue Gray, a pro
gram coordinator at the Haas
Center. "It will be an opportunity
for Stanford students to get
involved in community service
and to be guinea pigs and leaders
for this program."
She added that she thinks the
Haas Center was selected over
other Bay Area colleges and uni
versities because it has a strong
nationwide reputation as a leader
in public service.
Summer of Service will cost the
government $8.8 million, and will
serve as an test of Clinton's pro
posed nation service youth corps.
Next year, $400 million will be
spent to place 25,000 students in
community service work. By 1997,
an estimated 150,000 youths are
slated to become involved.
Participating students would
get $5,000 each year for tuition,
fees or loans for up to two years of
community service. In addition,
workers would get minimum
wage compensation for their sum
mertime labor.
"I think both supporters and
skeptics want to see the effect on
the community and on young peo
ple and whether it is cost-effec
tive," Gray said.
Milton stressed that she was
not involved in the decision to
include Stanford in the pilot pro
gram. She said outside peer
reviewers and the national com
mission's board of directors made
the selection.
"I'm very happy that Stanford
was chosen and I think it's a tes
tament to the work of the Haas
Center," she said.
Lennon said this summer's
outcome may determine the
future of the service program.
"We have the opportunity of a
lifetime now, and we're ready to
show how young people can deal
with social issues and be con
scious," she said.
