# Suns eclipse Lakers, 112-104

PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) - Call
them cocky, call them lucky, call
the Phoenix Suns escapees from
the greatest upset in NBA playoff
history.
The Suns, pushed by Charles
Barkley's 31 points and 14
rebounds, slam-dunked the Los
Angeles Lakers 112-104 in over
time Sunday to become the first
team to rebound from two home
losses to win a best-of-five series.
The Suns escaped a winner
after scoring the first seven
points of overtime as Barkley and
center Oliver Miller grabbed
every loose ball in sight.
Barkley's strong finish after a
stuttering start would have
meant nothing without Miller's
monstrous overtime nine
points and five rebounds after
scoring only eight in regulation.
Miller finished with 14 rebounds
and seven blocked shots.
"I wasn't going to let anything
get in my way," said Miller, a 6-
foot-9, 300-pound rookie who
reached a peak of 340 pounds
before going to a weight-loss clin
ic in midseason. "If I had lost the
weight to begin the season, I

could have played this way all
year. I didn't do as much as I
could have in the first half, but I
came back in the second and
worked my butt off."
"The team was worried about
Miller's weight problems during
the season," Barkley said. "There
were a lot of times he wanted to
give up, but we stayed on him. All
the anxiety he caused us, he's
making up for now."
The Suns, who meet San Anto
nio in the second round starting
Tuesday, made good on coach
Paul Westphal's bold guarantee of
victory after they lost the first two
games at America West arena.
"They were fantastic and they
just showed what they were made
of," Westphal said of the Lakers.
"We are very fortunate to get past
them.
"I'm not gloating at all. I feel
very humble to be able to escape
with this win. The reason I said it
(the guarantee) was because I
believed we had a better team.
They didn't make it easy."
The Lakers, the only team in
the playoffs with a losing record,
had three chances to knock off the

team with the league's best
record and become the first No. 8
seed to beat a No. 1 seed.
Led by James Worthy's 24
points, the Lakers had a shot right
down to the end of regulation, but
Byron Scott's three-pointer with
the score tied 95-95 bounced off
the rim.
"I knew it was a little short.
Danny Ainge hit the palm of my
hand just when I released it,"
Scott said.

"The Lakers should have been
elated to have one shot to win the
game and win the series," said a
relieved Kevin Johnson, who
almost saw his 24-point, 13-assist
performance wasted. "I'm sure
they couldn't have imagined before
the series started to have one shot
with no time on the clock to win
the game. They didn't and we just
came out fired up in the overtime.
"I'm proud of our defense,
proud because we had our backs
against the wall the whole series,
proud because we had our backs
against the wall again in the
fourth quarter. But we showed
our tenacity, our desire, and we
never quit."
