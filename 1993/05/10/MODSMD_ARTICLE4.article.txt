# ASSU eliminates summer storage
## New storage solutions sought 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Fearing numerous problems,
the ASSU has decided to with
draw its plans to provide summer
storage in steel containers and
will look instead into off-campus
storage options.
In the meantime, many stu
dents have expressed frustration
with the ASSU's inability to solve
the storage problem in a timely
manner, opting to rent their own
outside spaces.
The ASSU had initially been
working with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson to create a plan
in which eight containers would
be placed on empty land near
Stanford Stadium.
The plan, which would have
cost an estimated $15,000, had to
be nullified when Jackson was
warned about the risks of using
the containers — including rust,
corrosion, heat damage and ro
dent attacks — by Electrical En
gineering Prof. Anthony Sieg
man.
ASSU senator Ying-Ying Goh,
a Council of Presidents member
elect, said that the ASSU is
scrambling for alternatives in the
last weeks of the school year, fo
cusing primarily on arranging
transportation to off-campus
storage facilities.

"We don't have very much
time, and we want to find stu
dents some way to store things
over the summer," Goh said.
"The only thing we can do now is
work with local storage."
Goh hopes the ASSU will be
able to convince local storage
companies to transport students'
belongings to and from their
warehouses. If not, the ASSU will
hire trucks themselves, she said.
The ASSU has not made offi
cial arrangements for off-campus
storage as of yet.
The original idea to purchase
metal containers was an attempt
to provide a storage option for
students after the University dis
continued summer storage last
year due to budget cutbacks.
Siegman notified Jackson
about the problems associated
with metal storage containers be
cause he had used such bins for
storing old lab equipment and
records. According to Seigman,
many of his stored objects rusted
or corroded.
"[The containers] bake in the
sun, so stuff in there gets very
hot. They're supposed to be wa
tertight, but they leak," he said.
"As they get hot and cold, mois
ture tends to condense in them.
The whole thing is a bad idea."
