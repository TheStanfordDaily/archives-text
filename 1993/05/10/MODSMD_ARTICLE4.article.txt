# ASSU eliminates summer storage
## New storage solutions sought 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Fearing numerous problems,
the ASSU has decided to with
draw its plans to provide summer
storage in steel containers and
will look instead into off-campus
storage options.
In the meantime, many stu
dents have expressed frustration
with the ASSU's inability to solve
the storage problem in a timely
manner, opting to rent their own
outside spaces.
The ASSU had initially been
working with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson to create a plan
in which eight containers would
be placed on empty land near
Stanford Stadium.
The plan, which would have
cost an estimated $15,000, had to
be nullified when Jackson was
warned about the risks of using
the containers — including rust,
corrosion, heat damage and ro
dent attacks — by Electrical En
gineering Prof. Anthony Sieg
man.
ASSU senator Ying-Ying Goh,
a Council of Presidents member
elect, said that the ASSU is
scrambling for alternatives in the
last weeks of the school year, fo
cusing primarily on arranging
transportation to off-campus
storage facilities.

"We don't have very much
time, and we want to find stu
dents some way to store things
over the summer," Goh said.
"The only thing we can do now is
work with local storage."
Goh hopes the ASSU will be
able to convince local storage
companies to transport students'
belongings to and from their
warehouses. If not, the ASSU will
hire trucks themselves, she said.
The ASSU has not made offi
cial arrangements for off-campus
storage as of yet.
The original idea to purchase
metal containers was an attempt
to provide a storage option for
students after the University dis
continued summer storage last
year due to budget cutbacks.
Siegman notified Jackson
about the problems associated
with metal storage containers be
cause he had used such bins for
storing old lab equipment and
records. According to Seigman,
many of his stored objects rusted
or corroded.
"[The containers] bake in the
sun, so stuff in there gets very
hot. They're supposed to be wa
tertight, but they leak," he said.
"As they get hot and cold, mois
ture tends to condense in them.
The whole thing is a bad idea."
Also, Siegman pointed out that
field mice tend to get into the bins
because they are drawn to clothes
with food stains.
Goh explained that ASSU
members has not been able to
respond to students' storage con
cerns as promptly as they would
have liked because of setbacks
caused by the failure of their stor
age-bin proposal.
"Our work has been delayed
because we decided not to go
along with the original proposal,"
Goh said.
Nonetheless, this last-minute
dilemma has left many students
dismayed as to why the ASSU
could not have dealt with the
issue earlier.
"(The ASSU] was really disor
ganized to leave this to the last
minute," said freshman Shehza
ad Nakhoda, an electrical engi
neering mqjor. "They could have
taken care of it from the begin
ning of winter quarter."
Some blame the ASSU ineffl

ciency In taking care of storage on
the organization's structure.
"The senate is not a good body
for this kind of a project. It's not
a day-to-day body, it only meets
every other week," said Derek
Miyahara, a graduate senator
who has been dealing with the
container-storage plan.
"This is a good example of why
we need a COP," he added.
Goh said another storage
option should be available in time
because most students don't
actually store things until a few
days before the end of finals.
"You need your stuff to live
day to day, so you can't pack
away most of your belongings till
you're leaving anyway," she
said.
But many students who travel
abroad or live out of state said
they have been forced to make
their own storage plans because
they were wary of relying on the
ASSU.
"I live really far away, so I had
to make arrangements," said
Shanthini Rajendram, a sopho
more from Bangladesh. "I didn't
know whether |the ASSU] was
going to have storage."
