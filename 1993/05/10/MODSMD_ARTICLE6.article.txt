Nearly 50 animal-rights demonstrators rallied in
Palo Alto's Lytton Plaza Friday to denounce Psychi
atry Prof. Seymour Levine's research involving ex
perimentation with monkeys.
According to organizers from the group In De
fense of Animals, the protest was deliberately sched
uled for the Friday before Mother's Day to call atten
tion to Levine's studies of mother-child relationships
in squirrel monkeys.
Speakers accused Levine of animal cruelty be
cause much of his work places monkeys in uncom
fortable situations to measure their stress levels.
Lise Giraud, co-director of education for the ani
mal-rights group and a former Stanford librarian,
denounced the purpose of Levine's work as "the in
fliction of pain, fear and anguish." Giraud detailed
some of Levine's past experiments, including giving
animals electroshock treatments and exposing mon
keys to a boa constrictor, their natural enemy.

"He and Stanford get multi-millions for it, while
many kids cannot afford day care," Giraud said, re
ferring to a $900,000 government grant Levine re
cently received.
Joyce Tishler, executive director for the Animal
Legal Defense Fund, reiterated this point, telling the
crowd that tax dollars were being spent "to find out
what any mother ... could tell you."
While no representatives from the Medical School
attended the rally, Levine's colleagues expressed
support for his work.
Joanne Blum, Stanford's associate director of
comparative medicine, said Levine has "full Univer
sity backing" for his experiments. According to
Blum, animal experiments must be authorized by a
University administrative panel, and Levine has re
ceived the panel's approval.
"It is unfortunate that Dr. Levine has been tar
geted," she added.
