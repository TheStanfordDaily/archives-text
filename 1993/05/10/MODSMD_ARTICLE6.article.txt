# 50 activists protest professor's use of monkeys in experiments

### Sean Kennedy 
Nearly 50 animal-rights demonstrators rallied in
Palo Alto's Lytton Plaza Friday to denounce Psychi
atry Prof. Seymour Levine's research involving ex
perimentation with monkeys.
According to organizers from the group In De
fense of Animals, the protest was deliberately sched
uled for the Friday before Mother's Day to call atten
tion to Levine's studies of mother-child relationships
in squirrel monkeys.
Speakers accused Levine of animal cruelty be
cause much of his work places monkeys in uncom
fortable situations to measure their stress levels.
Lise Giraud, co-director of education for the ani
mal-rights group and a former Stanford librarian,
denounced the purpose of Levine's work as "the in
fliction of pain, fear and anguish." Giraud detailed
some of Levine's past experiments, including giving
animals electroshock treatments and exposing mon
keys to a boa constrictor, their natural enemy.

"He and Stanford get multi-millions for it, while
many kids cannot afford day care," Giraud said, re
ferring to a $900,000 government grant Levine re
cently received.
Joyce Tishler, executive director for the Animal
Legal Defense Fund, reiterated this point, telling the
crowd that tax dollars were being spent "to find out
what any mother ... could tell you."
While no representatives from the Medical School
attended the rally, Levine's colleagues expressed
support for his work.
Joanne Blum, Stanford's associate director of
comparative medicine, said Levine has "full Univer
sity backing" for his experiments. According to
Blum, animal experiments must be authorized by a
University administrative panel, and Levine has re
ceived the panel's approval.
"It is unfortunate that Dr. Levine has been tar
geted," she added.
Levine's experiments, which
have drawn criticism from ani
mal-rights groups for several
years, are intended to increase
understanding about stress and
child development.

In his current experiments,
Levine forces some female squir
rel monkeys to forage for food. As
the food becomes increasingly
hard to find, blood samples are
taken from the monkeys to mea
sure hormone levels that indicate
stress. These monkeys are then

observed to see how much time
they spend with their children.
However, law student Nathan
Winograd, who also spoke at the
event, cited several instances
when animal testing failed. Some
drugs that were proven safe on
animals have ended up causing
cancer and birth defects in
humans, he said.
"Animal tests are dangerously
unreliable," Winograd said. "Be
careful and look hard when some
body tells you it's good for kids."
The protesters consisted
mainly of community members
and representatives of In
Defense of Animals, most carry
ing large signs denouncing
Levine and his work. After the
fairly low-key, hour-long rally
concluded, demonstrators
remained in the area to pass out
leaflets.
Despite the strong opinions
voiced at the rally, one member
of the animal rights group said
he felt the protest was "some
what of a waste of time." He said
that the speakers were preach
ing to people who didn't need to
hear the group's message, since
most of the participants were
members of In Defense of Ani
mals.

tended to increase un
derstanding about stress
