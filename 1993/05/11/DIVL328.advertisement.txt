Admissions Outreach Volunteer!
The Undergraduate Admissions Office and the Stanford Student Alumni Network (STAN)
are recruiting enthusiastic, dependable Stanford undergrads to serve as Admissions
Outreach Volunteers to high schools.
About the Admissions Outreach program.
You will be trained by an undergrad admissions officer on May 18, 1993 and provided with
general guidelines on how to give an admissions presentation. The point of the admissions
outreach program is to provide high school students with your personal perspective on
Stanford student life!
Then, before you return to Stanford this coming fall, you will contact your alma mater and/or
other high schools in your hometown and give your presentation.
How do I get Involved?
First, pick up a questionnaire at the front desk of the Bowman Alumni House (next to
Tresidder) and return it by Friday. May 14th. Second, mark the May 18th date on your
calendar as the training session is MANDATORY!
For more info, call Dana at 7-1411.
