ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM
WINTER '94
Open to juniors and seniors in all fields
The program consists of high-level internships,
tutorials, and seminars in environmental
science, policy, and law.
Comments from the 1993 SIW environmental students:
"The teaching in the seminar was clear, straightforward, and lively. The
format was great â€” the student presentations complemented the lectures and
discussions."
"I highly recommend my internship for future students. My supervisor is
working on the most current projects with market incentives for
environmental regulation."
"My internship supervisor was really great."
"My tutor was interested, supportive, fun, and a complete genius. Her writing
comments were the most instructive I've had."
"With only two students and an enthusiastic, intelligent professor, it was a
fantastic course."
