# Speaking out against war
## Stanford experts write letter against Bosnian intervention 
### Mary Anne McConnel 
Reflecting the opinion of a majority of Americans,
a group of Stanford scholars with a broad spectrum
of political views has united to publicly oppose Unit
ed States military intervention in Bosnia.
Conservative and liberal faculty members and
Hoover Institution fellows supported an open letter
to President Clinton, which appeared in Friday's
Daily. The letter was written in response to Clinton's
increasingly aggressive stance on U.S. involvement
in the Balkans.
Most polls show that the American public opposes
a significant commitment of troops to the war-torn
region. Clinton is currently considering limited air
strikes against Bosnian Serb forces.
The letter, signed by 35 individuals, states that U.S.
intervention in the civil war is likely to escalate the vi
olence. It argues that a military solution to the problem
would "directly entangle" the United States in a re
gional conflict which is "neither in our interest nor in
the interest of the suffering people of the region."
William Evers of the Hoover Institution, an out
spoken libertarian and anti-war proponent, believes
that the Bosnian government must solve its own
problems on a local level because the Bosnian people
ultimately will have to cope with the ramifications.
Evers said the letter was funded by the nascent
Balkan Peace Committee, a Palo Alto organization
without a stated political affiliation.
Hoover Senior Fellow Dr. Thomas Henrikson
agreed that a military solution would not stop the
civil strife. "The U.S. might again drift into war for
which there are not clearly defined ends," he said.
History Prof. Wayne Vucinich, another signer,
said he believes that U.S. involvement would cause
more unnecessary destruction to the infrastructure
of Bosnia as well as "the destruction of many human
beings totally innocent of the war."
Evers added that occupying Bosnia would be diffi
cult and "very bloody."
Because Bosnia is essentially landlocked with deep
terrains, unpaved roads and only a few air fields,
