# Speaking out against war
## Stanford experts write letter against Bosnian intervention 
### Mary Anne McConnel 
Reflecting the opinion of a majority of Americans,
a group of Stanford scholars with a broad spectrum
of political views has united to publicly oppose Unit
ed States military intervention in Bosnia.
Conservative and liberal faculty members and
Hoover Institution fellows supported an open letter
to President Clinton, which appeared in Friday's
Daily. The letter was written in response to Clinton's
increasingly aggressive stance on U.S. involvement
in the Balkans.
Most polls show that the American public opposes
a significant commitment of troops to the war-torn
region. Clinton is currently considering limited air
strikes against Bosnian Serb forces.
The letter, signed by 35 individuals, states that U.S.
intervention in the civil war is likely to escalate the vi
olence. It argues that a military solution to the problem
would "directly entangle" the United States in a re
gional conflict which is "neither in our interest nor in
the interest of the suffering people of the region."
William Evers of the Hoover Institution, an out
spoken libertarian and anti-war proponent, believes
that the Bosnian government must solve its own
problems on a local level because the Bosnian people
ultimately will have to cope with the ramifications.
Evers said the letter was funded by the nascent
Balkan Peace Committee, a Palo Alto organization
without a stated political affiliation.
Hoover Senior Fellow Dr. Thomas Henrikson
agreed that a military solution would not stop the
civil strife. "The U.S. might again drift into war for
which there are not clearly defined ends," he said.
History Prof. Wayne Vucinich, another signer,
said he believes that U.S. involvement would cause
more unnecessary destruction to the infrastructure
of Bosnia as well as "the destruction of many human
beings totally innocent of the war."
Evers added that occupying Bosnia would be diffi
cult and "very bloody."
Because Bosnia is essentially landlocked with deep
terrains, unpaved roads and only a few air fields,
"U.S. troops would be fighting on
the most horrifying terrain imag
inable."
The authors of the letter contend
that the situation must be resolved
diplomatically and advocate U.S.
participation in an international
peacekeeping effort. They agree
that the proposed Vance-Owen
peace plan, which divides Bosnia
into ten regions united by a weak
central government, is a good start.
Evers said he supports the
decentralization of the Bosnian
government, so that "people don't
feel that some alien central gov
ernment is telling them what to
do." He added that the Bosnian
government must "put power as
far down to the village and the
individual as they can" to decrease
the possibility of massive ethnic
persecution by a central power.
But according to Henrikson, a
better plan must be put forward.
"There aren't many countries with
ten peaceful enclaves," he said.
Vucinich said the Vance-Owen
plan has merit, but added that the
best solution may be to divide the
region into three states, seperating

the Muslims, Serbs, and Croats.
"Now that Bosnia is in a state
of warfare, it is doubtful that it
can be successfully reunited into a
harmonious community," said
Vucinich. "It is difficult to believe
that the aroused passions of the
three peoples would allow for a
lasting fraternal union."
According to Evers, even those
who favor intervention are dis
tressed that Clinton is not confer
ring with Congress.
Even if Clinton does only plan to
operate as an international police
man, "it is hard for me to believe
that the United States would like to
be the military protector of Bosnia
for the next 50 years," he added.
"The United States must have
a principle with which to differen
tiate between this conflict and
others besides the fact that TV
cameras are there," Evers said.
"Many ethnic conflicts are brutal
— there are at least ten in the
world at any time."
The Bosnian letter — an open
political statement independently
made by a group of Stanford aca
demics — is not without prece
dent. Last April, 700 faculty and
staff signed an advertisment in
the New York Times condemning
the first verdict in the Rodney
King-police brutality case.
