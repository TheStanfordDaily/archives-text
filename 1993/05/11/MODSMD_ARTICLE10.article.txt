Three members of the Student Conduct Leg
islative Council voted against a proposal to
repeal the University's speech code Friday, jeop
ardizing the measure's chances for approval.
The SCLC is awaiting the votes of five mem
bers who were absent from Friday's meeting of
the 10-member committee. The proposal, which
would rescind the Grey interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard, needs the support of all
the truant members to pass.
The absent members will give their votes to
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole over the
phone.
"It is likely that the proposal is dead," con
ceded electrical engineering graduate student
Douglas Bone, the proposal's author.
Passed in May 1990, the Grey interpreta
tion stipulated that the use of fighting and
insulting words of a discriminatory nature
directed at an individual or group of individu
als is a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
Bone proposed the SCLC recommend a

removal of the Grey interpretation, without rec
ommending a new code to replace it. If the SCLC
approves the proposal, it still must be ratified by
the ASSU and Faculty Senates, then offered for
public comment before it would be official.
"We need standards of conduct, for cer
tain," Bone said, "but it is not clear whether
they should be promulgated by the University.
"I don't see Stanford students as being so
mean and vicious that the only reason they are
deterred from using fighting words is because
of judicial standards," Bone added.
But Law Prof. Tom Grey, who authored the
current interpretation, argued that the code
has not hurt interactions between members of
the Stanford community.
"For moral and legal reasons, it wouldn't be
right to say everybody can say whatever they
like," Grey said. A repeal of the code would be
a public-relations fiasco for the University, he
added.
Bone maintained that the small number of
cases in which the interpretation has been vio
lated proves that the speech code is unneces
sary and irrelevant.
"I'd like to see Stanford go back to the Fun
damental Standard" without the Grey inter
pretation, Bone said. "I expect the number of
cases will be very small, find if [a fighting

words casej does come up, a public debate on it
would be very valuable."
Grey countered this argument, saying "an
intellectually charged debate with the lives of
individuals at its center would not be a good
idea."
In addition, Grey said he sees the small
number of alleged code violations as an affir
mation of both its deterrent value and its nar
row construction.
Cole also supported the interpretation, saying
that the University needs a specific standard to
handle fighting-words cases when they do arise.
"If there are no cases at all, then perhaps
people have outgrown [fighting words], but I
doubt it," Cole said. "It seems that everyone
agrees that we need some sort of understand
ing in this multicultural, very diverse setting."
Grey discounted the claim that the intellec
tual marketplace of ideas is being hindered by
the code. "I personally do not think there is a
chilling of orthodox speech," he said.
After approximately 30 minutes of debate on
Bone's proposal, the shorthanded committee
closed discussion and voted. Bone and sopho
more John Griggs voted in favor of the propos
al, while Grey, Pediatrics Prof. Ron Ariagno
and Philosophy Prof. John Dupre, the commit
tee's chair, rejected it.
