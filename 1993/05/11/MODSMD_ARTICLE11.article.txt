Female condom approved
WASHINGTON (AP) - Wisconsin
Pharmacal Co. said yesterday it has won
final regulatory approval for the first
female condom, which can protect
women against both pregnancy and sex
ually transmitted diseases, including
AIDS.
The Food and Drug Administration
said two weeks ago it was ready to license
the Reality condom but stressed that
male latex condoms remain the better
safeguard. The new condom, however,
affords women a chance to protect them
selves when their partners refuse to use
male condom.
The female condom had a 26 percent
failure rate in preventing pregnancy dur
ing a six-month trial. The company
attributed that to incorrect use or failure
to use the device at all.
Reality is a soft, loose-fitting plastic
pouch that lines the vagina and prevents
skin from touching skin during inter
course.
Mary Ann Leeper, Wisconsin Pharma

cal's senior vice president for develop
ment, said there are better contraceptive
methods for women to use if they are only
concerned about getting pregnant.
Kuwait refuses extradition
KUWAIT (AP) — Kuwait yesterday
ruled out extraditing suspects in an
alleged plot to assassinate former Presi
dent Bush during his visit to the emirate
last month.
Defense Minister Sheik Ali al-Sabah told
the daily newspaper Al-Anba that the 17
suspects, one of whom is still at large, will
be tried in Kuwait because that was where
they were going to carry out their plot.
In Washington, congressional leaders
said the United States should retaliate if
it was proven that Saddam Hussein's
government was behind the alleged plot.
Some urged the use of military force.
Sheik Ali's comment followed a Wash
ington Post report that some U.S. offi
cials advocated seeking the suspects'
extradition, even though the alleged plot
occurred on foreign soil.
