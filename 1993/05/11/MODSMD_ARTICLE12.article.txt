PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
(AP) — Attacks on U.N. peace
keepers trying to steer the coun
try to elections have this capital's
war-weary residents on edge.
The big fear is that the Com
munist Khmer Rouge, blamed for
most of the attacks, will return to
Phnom Penh, where it once held
sway during a radical regime in
which hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians died.
Large crowds are jamming gov
ernment offices for passports and
residents Eire stocking up on food.
Foreign tourists and business
men, who had begun filtering
back after the U.N. mission
arrived, have also grown wary.
"People are afraid the Khmer
Rouge will come back to Phnom
Penh," said Mrs. Boon Nareth,
who was waiting at the Foreign

Ministry to apply for passports for
her children. She already has her
passport.
The capital was seen as a
refuge from the turmoil of nearly
13 years of civil war, which ended
with a 1991 peace treaty that
called for U.N.-supervised elec
tions and demilitarization of
Cambodia's four factions.
But the Khmer Rouge is boy
cotting the May 23-28 elections
and is apparently trying to sabo
tage the vote with series of
attacks on U.N. peacekeepers and
civilian election volunteers.
Fifty-six members of the U.N.
mission have been killed or
injured in attacks over the past
year, including 10 dead and 30
injured since late March. The
Khmer Rouge is suspected in
most attacks, but it denies

responsibility.
Japan asked the United
Nations yesterday to transfer its
Cambodia personnel to safer
areas, after a Japanese policeman
was killed last week in northwest
ern Cambodia.
As the violence grows, so has
the tension in the capital.
University student Chim
Guanghui said his family.has
been stocking up rice and other
items in case roads to Phnom
Penh are cut off. "Most people feel
the situation is very uncertain,
that there might be another civil
war," he said.
While some say violent rob
beries may have increased, the
tree-lined boulevards of this beau
tiful riverside city remain rela
tively safe, and much of the coun
try is nearing peace, not war.
