# EC calls for 'safe zone' support

### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — The
European Community yesterday called
on the United States and Russia to sup
ply troops to help protect "safe zones" for
civilians caught up in the Bosnian war.
The request for small numbers of
American and Russian soldiers came as
an apparent response to U.S. canvassing
in Europe for support of a tougher policy
against Bosnia's rebel Serbs, including
air strikes and arming the mainly Mus
lim government.
European allies have given only luke
warm support to such requests.
"We invite other countries, especially
the United States and Russia, to con
tribute to efforts to secure safe areas,"
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen said after a meeting of foreign
ministers from the 12 EC nations. Den
mark currently holds the EC's rotating
presidency.
Helveg Petersen denied deploying
U.S. troops in Bosnia would neutralize
Washington's call for air strikes by mak
ing American infantrymen targets to
retaliation attacks.
In their own opposition to air strikes,
however, the Europeans have long cited

the safety of their soldiers working on
U.N. humanitarian and monitoring mis
sions. France has 5,000 troops in the for
mer Yugoslavia, Britain about 2,500.
Helveg Petersen said he had no indi
cation of how the United States will react
to the request. President Clinton has
ruled out committing U.S. ground forces
to the Bosnian conflict unless there is a
peace plan in operation.
Yesterday, the White House declared
its Bosnia policy "in a holding pattern."
White House press secretary Dee Dee
Myers said no decision would be made
before the weekend referendum in
Bosnia on the U.N.-sponsored peace plan
to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10
provinces — three each to Muslims,
Croats and Bosnian Serbs and a jointly
administered capital, Sarajevo.
In Brussels, the Danish minister said
the EC proposal would involve "a low
level of presence" of U.S. troops. He said
no figures were discussed.
The troops would be used to monitor
six "safe areas" declared by the United
Nations last week after Bosnian Serbs
once again rejected an international plan
to halt the war.

Small detachments of U.N. troops are
already moving to secure zones in two of
the areas — Srebrenica and Zepa —
which are Muslim enclaves besieged by
Serbs.
Canadian troops have reported suc
cess in Srebrenica, but U.N. forces that
arrived in Zepa yesterday found the town
almost deserted after days of Serb
shelling. It had housed some 40,000
refugees.
U.N. military observers who reached
the burned-out Muslim town discovered
a "humanitarian disaster" and sought to
evacuate 200 wounded people by heli
copter, officials said.
On a separate front in Bosnia's civil
war, the U.N. commander in former
Yugoslavia demanded to know the
whereabouts of hundreds of Muslim
civilians expelled from Mostar by their
erstwhile Croat allies. A U.N. aid official
predicted it was the start of a second
wave of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.
Zepa, a town of 6,000 before the war
that has convulsed Bosnia-Herzegovina,
was nearly deserted Sunday when the U.N.
team first arrived. About 50 civilians wan
dered through the ruins, the officials said.
