# Clinton lays out new strategy

### 
CLEVELAND (AP) â€” President Clinton opened
a campaign-style push to refocus attention on his
economic package yesterday, saying he may have
tried to tackle too many issues at once but would
rather "err on the side of effort."
He delivered a no-apologies defense for moving
on so many fronts, including tax increases he
acknowledged go beyond those he foresaw during
last year's campaign.
Clinton suggested his domestic-policy initiatives
on the economy, on health care, on overhauling the
college loan system and on campaign finance and
welfare reform are interrelated.
"I think most of you want us to do something
and I think you want us to be bold," Clinton said
after plunging into a crowd at a downtown shop
ping center. It was the first stop of a trip designed
to regain lost momentum.
Later, he told a luncheon with business leaders:
"The costs of the status quo are very, very high,
even if you don't see them on the ledger

sheets. . . .1 think we can do more than one thing
at one time."
Demonstrating a change of strategy from
recent speeches, Clinton also declined to blame
Republicans for seeking to block his programs,
charting a more populist course of blaming lobby
ists and other entrenched Washington interests
instead.
"The lobbyists are lining the corridors of Wash
ington as never before. There are 80,000 of them
there," he told the City Club of Cleveland. "And
unless all the American people speak out loud and
clear, it's going to be hard for us to hold this pro
gram together."
Taking advantage of a lull in the crisis in
Bosnia, Clinton also sought to turn the spotlight
away from his $16.3 billion jobs stimulus package,
defeated in the Senate by a GOP filibuster. He said
it was only a minor part of an economic program
calling for nearly $500 billion in deficit-reducing
tax increases and spending cuts over five years.
