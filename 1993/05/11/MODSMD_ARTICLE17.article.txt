## Indirect-cost battle 
### 
Federal zealotry diverts
University energy from
the interests of students

WASTE, INEFFICIENCY
and mind-numbing slow
ness — these are all words
commonly associated with the U.S.
government.
However, in a particularly
galling exhibition of its ongoing
quest to fully define the bound
aries of each of these terms, the
federal government has taken
extra steps to ensure that Stanford
will have to jump through hoops of
ever-changing size in the Universi
ty's pursuit to clear its name of
indirect-cost opprobrium.
When evaluating Stanford's
adherence to indirect-cost policies,
the government scrutinized the
University's records more vigor
ously than they did other universi
ties. UC-San Diego and UC-Berke
ley did not spend nearly as much as
Stanford was forced to in handling
governmental requests.
In its doggedness to uncover
indirect-cost violations, the govern
ment's motivation is questionable.
Stanford wants nothing more
than to resign the indirect-cost
matter to the dustbin of history. In
prolonging the investigation, the
government isn't exactly helping
the University to this end.
Instead, the government ap
pears to have created another self
perpetuating investigation that ties
up few loose ends and burdens tax
payers and the University both
financially and personally.
When it was revealed that Stan
ford had violated the govern
ment's indirect-cost funding stan
dards, both parties promised to
quickly get to the bottom of the
matter.
The University has largely ful
filled its part of the bargain, obedi
ently completing every form, con
tributing every iota of information
and hiring every auditor that the

government had requested.
Often times, these demands bor
dered on the absurd. As soon as
Stanford devoted $500,000 to sur
veys on their administration, the
government changed the rules
regarding such explorations and
ruled them invalid.
In other instances, Stanford has
been required to take steps —
such as hiring outside auditors —
that no other university has been
forced to follow. While this may be
due in some part to the Universi
ty's role as the most-notorious
abuser of indirect funds, it in no
way leads to healthy relations
between the University and the
government.
When such waste and abuse of
power occurs in Washington, it
takes on an almost humorous vein
— the government has managed
to find ways to run itself in circles
for generations. But when such
actions deprive a university —
and, more importantly, its stu
dents and faculty — of much
needed funds, they take on a dark
er tinge.
It is alarming that the govern
ment has chosen to divert Stan
ford's attention from its primary
purpose — the education of its stu
dents — and instead preoccupy its
thoughts, energy and finances
toward bean-counting and the per
petuation of charges that Stanford
has already accounted and paid
penance for in the past. No good can
come of this situation — only new
grudges and hard feelings will
result.
Of course, the argument can def
initely be made that had Stanford
been honest with its bookkeeping
in the past, then it would not be
undergoing trials at this time.
This is undeniably the case; yet
Stanford has shown evidence of
penitence for its indiscretions and
is willing to ensure that they will
not occur again.
There is a fine line between
prosecution and persecution. The
federal government, in its zealotry
to pursue the former, seems to
have crossed the boundary and
grown obsessed with the latter.
