## Thorns in a rose garden 
### 
I DON'T READ TV Guide regularly —
trust me. But when I do, I see this
strangely interesting feature called
"Cheers and Jeers." In that same spirit: I
present you with Roses ("Cheers") and
Thorns ("Jeers").
Thorns: To the two U.S. Post Office
workers, who last Thursday became the
11th and 12th postal workers in the last
decade to commit acts of tremendous vio
lence. All told, this strange vocational
side effect has taken the lives of 29 people
and — it drips with irony — one dog. If
the discontinuation of the Sears catalog
hasn't cheered these people up, nothing
will.
Roses: To John Ratzenberger for play
ing postman Cliff Clavin for the past 11
years.
Thorns: To Major League Baseball.
They've got no commissioner, big finan
cial problems, games that last forever,
George Steinbrenner, Marge Schott,
Barry Bonds and Rickey Henderson.
Roses: To the Colorado Rockies and
the Florida Marlins, baseball's expansion
teams which are playing more-than
respectable ball. These two teams — and
the 65,000-person crowds the Rockies are
drawing — make you feel like baseball
can be baseball again.
Thorns: To Barbra Streisand, for tak
ing her political act a bit too far. In the
past week, she has dined with Secretary
of Labor Robert Reich and Sen. Bob

Kerry, used a study in the White House
as an office, met with female House mem
bers and taken Janet Reno out to dinner.
Another Thorns for Barbra for making
that "Nuts" movie, too.
Roses: To Charlie Sheen, for playing
the lead in "Hot Shots" and "Hot Shots:
Part Duex." Streisand and Richard Gere
might take a lesson in lightening up from
Mr. Sheen.
Tall Thorns: To Bill Walton, for call
ing Michigan's men's basketball team
"underachievers" during this year's
NCAA basketball tournament.
Roses: To the Michigan, North Caroli
na and California men's basketball
teams. They proved that despite the
immaturity of television broadcasters,
coaches and alumni, there are still a
whole lot of 20-year-olds putting every
thing they've got into the game they love.
The Lifetime Roses Achievement
Award: To Jim Valvano, a bright spot for
ever in college basketball.
A Flaming Thorns: To the Universi
ty's proposed all-campus ban on smoking
and cigarette sales. One would be tempt
ed to make a serious argument against
this policy, if the University's large
investments in tobacco companies didn't
make it completely laughable.
More Thorns: To the Stanford Book
store, for not firing Elton Speed, one of
their most creative accountants.
Roses: To the Stanford post office,

which got a letter from the East Coast to
me in three days. Sure, I've got com
plaints about our post office, but would
you want to get those people angry?
Thorns: To Green Library hours.
Roses: To Green Library chairs.
Half-Thorns: To the University com
mittee that chose Sen. Dianne Feinstein
as the graduation speaker this year. I
know she's a senator, but she was year
book queen when she was a student at
Stanford. Yearbook queen?
Roses: To Janet Reno, Anna Quindlen
and Hillary Clinton, each of whom would
have been a better choice.
Thorns: To whoever started this whole
flannel shirt and wool cap thing.
Roses: To Alice in Chains. Their fans
might wear flannel shirts, but it's the
best new music in a while.
Thorns Unjust Punishment Award:
To $100-plus tickets for not having a bike
light.
Roses: To spring quarter, the pass/no
credit option and all seniors who have
written honors theses this year.
And for those fellow seniors,
Thorns: To graduating this June.
Roses: To graduating this June.
