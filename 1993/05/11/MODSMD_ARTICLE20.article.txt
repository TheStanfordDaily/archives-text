Humanity and compromise in the Bosnian conflict

I WOULD LIKE to call attention to
the open letter to President Clinton
signed by 35 Stanford professors,
which ran in last Friday's Daily. It urged
the president to refrain from using mili
tary force in the Bosnian "civil war,"
and instead, "engage in diplomatic
efforts aimed at bringing the parties
together to negotiate a just and lasting
peace."
If I may be presumptuous enough to
say so, I believe the professors who
signed this advertisement do not fully
understand the nature of the conflict.
What we are witnessing is not a civil
war. This is not a struggle between com
patriots vying for political supremacy. It
is a war of hate, murder, and revenge.
The Bosnian Serbs' main goal is to
exterminate the Bosnian Muslims, and
wipe them out completely.
Why else have the Bosnian Serbs

established ethnic internment camps?
Why else would Serbian snipers fire at
the inhabitants of Sarajevo who are
making their weekly excursion to fetch
well-water? Why else have Bosnian
Serbs destroyed mosques and hospitals?
The simple answer to these questions is
that the Bosnian Serbs hate the Bosnian
Muslims, want to destroy them and
their institutions and make it seem like
they never existed in the first place.
From the past year of fighting, it is
evident that the Bosnian Serbs will
accept no political settlement, short of
the removal of the Muslims from Bosnia.
They don't care if they are removed by
helicopter or by a round of machine gun
fire, as long as they are gone. Clearly,
this is an unacceptable solution.
The open letter claims that "there is
no alternative to a political settlement."
I would like to ask what has happened in

the past year of searching for a political
settlement? Nothing. Nothing, except
the deaths of tens of thousands of Bosni
an Muslims, combatants and non-com
batants alike. Nothing, except the cruel
siege of Sarajevo, which bring to mind
military tactics of the Middle Ages.
Nothing, except for the displacement of
1.5 million refugees from their homes.
1.5 million people could easily fill up
Stanford Stadium 20 times over. Do you
realize how many people that is?
As I have stated before, the Bosnian
Serbs are not looking for political gains.
Instead, they want to drive the Bosnian
Muslims from their land entirely. Thus,
there is absolutely no common ground
for negotiation. Negotiations only buy
Bosnian Serbs time.
The past year of trying to be diplo
matic and rational with an irrational
group, intent on mass extermination,

has utterly failed. The political process
has been a farce. Last week, when Clin
ton threatened the Bosnian Serbs with
air strikes, it was the first time they
emerged from their dream world to seri
ously consider a peace proposal, which
they ultimately rejected.
I agree that a political settlement
would be the best solution to this prob
lem. But the Bosnian Serbs have no rea
son to negotiate when they are making
military progress with impunity. In the
name of humanity, it is our responsibili
ty to prevent them from rolling over the
rest of Bosnia. If this requires American
tactical air strikes and the arming of the
Bosnian Muslims (as all else has failed),
then I can see no other alternative. Only
under these circumstances will a politi
cal settlement carry any significance.
