# Rebuttal in support of new studies proposals
## 
### 
In response to Melind Joseph John's
May 10 letter to The Daily, I assert that
the campus mandate for Asian-Ameri
can Studies is not an illusion. I believe
that when over three-fourths of approx
imately 1000 people respond positively
to a poll such as the Independent Sur
vey on Asian-American Studies, it is sig
nificant.
John argues that the Independent
Survey was poorly phrased because it
did not ask if those polled would "pay an
extra $100 in tuition for the establish
ment of an Asian-American Studies pro
gram" or have their "department give up
two free classes to free up resources for
Asian-American Studies. Ido not
believe that it was the Survey's role to
ask such hypothetical and particular
questions.

As for the legitimate concerns about
funding Asian-American Studies, the sit
uation is not a zero-sum game. The
Irvine Foundation, an independent, pri
vate organization committed to multi
cultural curriculum development, is one
example of the "untapped resources"
available to develop Asian-American
Studies. Several years ago, the Founda
tion donated a multimillion-dollar grant
expressly for developing Stanford's mul
ticultural curriculum.
In an April 28 letter to members of
the Asian-American community, Dean
Ewart Thomas and Associate Dean and
Director of Undergraduate Studies A 1
Camarillo stated that, "The development
of several excellent courses ... have
been supported by Irvine Multicultural
Curriculum Development grants and
other courses will be added in 1993-94.
The School of H&S is committed to
explore ways to expand further the num
ber of courses on Asian Americans. We
will make every effort to identify young

scholars who will come to Stanford and
contribute to curriculum development in
this area."
Based on the ASSU resolution on
Asian-American Studies, the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the Irvine
Foundation and the Independent Sur
vey, I believe that there is a clear com
mitment to Asian-American Studies on
the part of students and key members of
the administration.
