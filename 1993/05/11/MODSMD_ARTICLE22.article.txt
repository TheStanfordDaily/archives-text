# The
						ultimate in bias: a glass ceiling in frisbee
## 
### 
We read the May 4 Daily and were
shocked and offended. Included on
the sports page was a three-column
article about the men's ultimate fris
bee team and their success in the

regional tournament this weekend.
There was no mention made of the
women's team.
Our team has dedicated as many
hours of hard toork in preparation for
this final tournament as the men's team
has â€” and we have the broken bones
and torn ligaments to show for it. Why is
it, then, that we are completely over
looked in being recognized by our peers
for our success this weekend? We, like
the men's team, placed third in the
Western region.
In spite of recent attention given to
Title IX and to Stanford's commitment
to give more money to women's sports,
it is obvious that women athletes have
not achieved enough, if we still do not
receive equal respect.
