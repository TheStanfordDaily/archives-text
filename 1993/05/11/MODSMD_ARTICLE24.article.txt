## Chiminello perseveres with cunning, determination 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
If you're a fan of sizzling Laxmi
Poruri forehands and fiery Heather Wil
lens rallies, you might not notice anoth
er player quietly blazing her own trail on
a Cardinal women's tennis team chock
full of superstars. But to her fans, Amy
Chiminello is the newest rising star on
the Stanford tennis horizon, and her
play has been nothing but exciting.
Chiminello, a sophomore and Stan
ford's No. 6 singles player, has made it
her business to win — not an easy task
when playing in a position where you're
expected to win every match. Chiminel
lo, however, doesn't let the pressure get
to her.
"I don't really look at it in terms of
matches — I have game goals," she said.
"The goals are in terms of things like
winning, improving my serve, and
improving my forehand."
For a woman who works hard to
make winning look easy, Chiminello
takes pride in her ability to relax on the
court and keep her game focused, a tal
ent she's still refining.
"These days I'm playing well — I'm
calm, I don't get frustrated," Chiminello
said. "But I'm still playing as hard as I
can — I'm definitely not peaking yet."
Chiminello started playing tennis at
age five and, like many of her team
mates, credits her early start in tennis
to natural interest and a supportive
family.
"I had an older sister who played, so it
was kind of like monkey see, monkey do,"
Chiminello said. "My dad was a smart
man because he coached me and took me
around to all the tournaments, and that's
when I started playing seriously."
Growing up, Chiminello tried swim
ming, dancing and gymnastics as well,
but by age twelve she had found her per
manent home on the tennis court.
"When I was eleven, I went to my first
national and saw people there from Cali
fornia, Florida — all over," she said. "I
kind of decided that I liked the interaction
on the tennis court, and the next year I
decided I wanted to be competitive."
But Chiminello was far more than com
petitive. At age thirteen, she was ranked in
two different age groups — top 10 in the
14-and-under division and top 30 in the

16-and-under group. Her success on the
junior tour meant spending only one year
on her Melrose, Mass. high school team,
because by that time, Chiminello's mind
was set on greater goals.
"I came to Stanford for a summer
camp when I was 13 and just fell in
love with it," she said. "I looked up at
all the NCAA Championships and
champions and thought, 'I have to go
here. This is ideal.'"
Chiminello got a chance to live out
that dream when she was accepted to
Stanford last year, as one of the nation's
top recruits. She racked up two Nation
al Amateur tournament titles in the
summer of 1991, including the National
Amateur Clay Court title, and emerged
as New England's No. 1 player in her
age group.
During her freshman year, Chiminel
lo posted a 22-3 dual match record, play
ing most of her matches at No. 5 or No.
6 singles for the Cardinal. Despite her
success, however, Chiminello remem
bers being amazed at the wealth of tal
ent on the team that year.
"I was thinking, 'Oh my God, this is
reality, this is Stanford!'" she said. "It's
a nice experience playing here no matter
where you are (in the lineup), because
everyone is so good. You know that if
you're playing (No.) five or six here you
could be playing one or two at another
school."
Her freshman team was also the first
Stanford team to fail to win the NCAA
title since 1985, and Chiminello recalls
the disappointment both personally and
throughout the team.
"I wanted it so bad," she admitted.
"People underrated us, but we were
solid — we definitely had a shot. We
were just plagued by injuries."
This year, however, it's a different
stoiy.
"It's really great to play on the team
this year," Chiminello said. "You lose
comradery when you have injuries, so
not having those usuries helps our con
fidence and helps us work hard."
As for Chiminello, 1993 has been a
year of stepping it up — and cooling it
down — on the court.
"One of the things I've learned to do
is even my temper," she said. "As a
frosh, sometimes I would play to
impress Frank [Brennan], and it was

easy to get out of control in a hurry."
Control, however, has been
Chiminello's motto this year. Her solid
dual match performances this year have
ranked her among the most consistent
winners on the team, and she has been
able to move up in the singles lineup
without problem when teammates Kim
Shasby and Laxmi Poruri went down
with injuries.
Then came Ojai.
Chiminello capped off the 1993 regu
lar season with the most impressive per
formance of her career to date, upset
ting three higher-ranked players in the
Pacific-10 Championships before falling
in the semifinal round to defending Pac
-10 champ Alix Creek of Arizona. All
three players — Keirsten Alley of Cali
fornia, No. 28 Suzanne Italiano of USC,
and No. 6 Keri Phebus of UCLA — have
played No. 1 for their respective teams
in singles at some point this year.
Chiminello — Cinderella, hmmm, is
there a connection?
"That Phebus match was just the
epitome of how well I can play,"
Chiminello said. "I chose my shots,
stayed calm and stayed in complete con
trol. I always knew I could beat No. 1
players, I just needed a chance."
That Cinderella/Chiminello perfor
mance was good enough for Chiminel
lo's first-ever NCAA singles berth, but
chances are she won't think about that
until she steps on the court for her first
singles match. Now, there is only the
NCAA title.
"1 can't wait to go to Florida,"
Chiminello said. "We're all fired up for
the NCAA's."
Fired up to play in front of a crowd
that loves to boo Stanford, even on
changeovers?
"I loved it," Chiminello confessed.
"The crowd couldn't get on me, they
didn't heckle me. It's kinda fun — if you
win the point, you just want to turn
around and say, 'In your face!'."
For Chiminello, preparation for the
NCAA showdown in Gainesville, Fla.
means time on the court getting — what
else? — tired.
"Foot speed is the key to my game,
since there's so much humidity down
there," she said. "Nothing needs to be
overhauled, just refined. It just comes
down to hard work."

champions and thought, 'I have to go
here. This is ideal.'"
Chiminello got a chance to live out
that dream when she was accepted to
Stanford last year, as one of the nation's
top recruits. She racked up two Nation
al Amateur tournament titles in the
summer of 1991, including the National
Amateur Clay Court title, and emerged
as New England's No. 1 player in her
age group.
During her freshman year, Chiminel
lo posted a 22-3 dual match record, play
ing most of her matches at No. 5 or No.
6 singles for the Cardinal. Despite her
success, however, Chiminello remem
bers being amazed at the wealth of tal
ent on the team that year.
"I was thinking, 'Oh my God, this is
reality, this is Stanford!'" she said. "It's
a nice experience playing here no matter
where you are (in the lineup), because
everyone is so good. You know that if
you're playing (No.) five or six here you
could be playing one or two at another
school."
Her freshman team was also the first
Stanford team to fail to win the NCAA
title since 1985, and Chiminello recalls
the disappointment both personally and
throughout the team.
"I wanted it so bad," she admitted.
"People underrated us, but we were
solid — we definitely had a shot. We
were just plagued by injuries."
This year, however, it's a different
stoiy.
"It's really great to play on the team
this year," Chiminello said. "You lose
comradery when you have injuries, so
not having those usuries helps our con
fidence and helps us work hard."
As for Chiminello, 1993 has been a
year of stepping it up — and cooling it
down — on the court.
"One of the things I've learned to do
is even my temper," she said. "As a
frosh, sometimes I would play to
impress Frank [Brennan], and it was

easy to get out of control in a hurry."
Control, however, has been
Chiminello's motto this year. Her solid
dual match performances this year have
ranked her among the most consistent
winners on the team, and she has been
able to move up in the singles lineup
without problem when teammates Kim
Shasby and Laxmi Poruri went down
with injuries.
Then came Ojai.
Chiminello capped off the 1993 regu
lar season with the most impressive per
formance of her career to date, upset
ting three higher-ranked players in the
Pacific-10 Championships before falling
in the semifinal round to defending Pac
-10 champ Alix Creek of Arizona. All
three players — Keirsten Alley of Cali
fornia, No. 28 Suzanne Italiano of USC,
and No. 6 Keri Phebus of UCLA — have
played No. 1 for their respective teams
in singles at some point this year.
Chiminello — Cinderella, hmmm, is
there a connection?
"That Phebus match was just the
epitome of how well I can play,"
Chiminello said. "I chose my shots,
stayed calm and stayed in complete con
trol. I always knew I could beat No. 1
players, I just needed a chance."
That Cinderella/Chiminello perfor
mance was good enough for Chiminel
lo's first-ever NCAA singles berth, but
chances are she won't think about that
until she steps on the court for her first
singles match. Now, there is only the
NCAA title.
"1 can't wait to go to Florida,"
Chiminello said. "We're all fired up for
the NCAA's."
Fired up to play in front of a crowd
that loves to boo Stanford, even on
changeovers?
"I loved it," Chiminello confessed.
"The crowd couldn't get on me, they
didn't heckle me. It's kinda fun — if you
win the point, you just want to turn
around and say, 'In your face!'."
For Chiminello, preparation for the
NCAA showdown in Gainesville, Fla.
means time on the court getting — what
else? — tired.
"Foot speed is the key to my game,
since there's so much humidity down
there," she said. "Nothing needs to be
overhauled, just refined. It just comes
down to hard work."

Relaxing off the court, one of Amy Chiminello's strengths is doing the same on the
court.
If you're a fan of sizzling Laxmi
Poruri forehands and fiery Heather Wil
lens rallies, you might not notice anoth
er player quietly blazing her own trail on
a Cardinal women's tennis team chock
full of superstars. But to her fans, Amy
Chiminello is the newest rising star on
the Stanford tennis horizon, and her
play has been nothing but exciting.
Chiminello, a sophomore and Stan
ford's No. 6 singles player, has made it
her business to win — not an easy task
when playing in a position where you're
expected to win every match. Chiminel
lo, however, doesn't let the pressure get
to her.
"I don't really look at it in terms of
matches — I have game goals," she said.
"The goals are in terms of things like
winning, improving my serve, and
improving my forehand."
For a woman who works hard to
make winning look easy, Chiminello
takes pride in her ability to relax on the
court and keep her game focused, a tal
ent she's still refining.
"These days I'm playing well — I'm
calm, I don't get frustrated," Chiminello
said. "But I'm still playing as hard as I
can — I'm definitely not peaking yet."
Chiminello started playing tennis at
age five and, like many of her team
mates, credits her early start in tennis
to natural interest and a supportive
family.
"I had an older sister who played, so it
was kind of like monkey see, monkey do,"
Chiminello said. "My dad was a smart
man because he coached me and took me
around to all the tournaments, and that's
when I started playing seriously."
Growing up, Chiminello tried swim
ming, dancing and gymnastics as well,
but by age twelve she had found her per
manent home on the tennis court.
"When I was eleven, I went to my first
national and saw people there from Cali
fornia, Florida — all over," she said. "I
kind of decided that I liked the interaction
on the tennis court, and the next year I
decided I wanted to be competitive."
But Chiminello was far more than com
petitive. At age thirteen, she was ranked in
two different age groups — top 10 in the
14-and-under division and top 30 in the

16-and-under group. Her success on the
junior tour meant spending only one year
on her Melrose, Mass. high school team,
because by that time, Chiminello's mind
was set on greater goals.
"I came to Stanford for a summer
camp when I was 13 and just fell in
love with it," she said. "I looked up at
all the NCAA Championships and
champions and thought, 'I have to go
here. This is ideal.'"
