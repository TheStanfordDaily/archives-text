### 
SEATTLE (AP) — The most experi
enced of the Seattle SuperSonics, Ricky
Pierce and Eddie Johnson, were at their
best last night.
Pierce scored 19 of his 23 points in the
second half and Jo hnson came off the
bench to add 20 points, 11 in the fourth
quarter, as Seattle hold the Houston Rock
ets scoreless for the final 3:40 in a 99-90
victory in the opener of the Western Con
ference semifinals.
Hakeem Olajuwon scored 26 points,
grabbed 16 rebounds and had five blocks
for Houston but was just 8 for 22 from the
field and looked tir ed in the fourth quar
ter, playing 45 minutes.
"We wanted to jump on them in the
third quarter and I wanted to come out
aggressively offensively," said Pierce, an
11-year veteran who had 13 points in the
third quarter.
"I know what I'm out there for," added
Johnson, who was 9 for 16 from the field
in just 23 minutes. "When I feel it, I shoot
it."
Johnson, who just finished his 12th
NBA season, was the difference as Seat

tle's bench outscored Houston's reserves
29-12.
The Rockets made only four of 16 shots
from the field in the fourth quarter — 1
for 4 by Olajuwon — but still made a
strong run at the Sonics after Seattle took
a 91-77 lead with 7:07 left.
The Rockets had gotten back into the
game with a 13-2 run capped by Otis
Thorpe's tip-in and free throw with 3:40
left. That was it for the Rockets as Gary
Payton made two layups and Derrick
McKey added two free throws in the final
1:26.
Houston had their chances toward the
end, but Kenny Smith was called for a crit
ical charging foul with 1:03 left and he also
missed a 21-footer with 22 seconds to play.
"Seattle's defense scrambles so much
jiind it makes it so difficult to get it inside
that you have to hit the open 3-pointer,"
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
"We had two wide open 3s and missed
both. We make one and that changes the
complexion of the game."
Houston finished 3 for 13 on 3-pointers
with Vernon Maxwell, who had 18 points,

I for 7 from that range.
Game 2 of the best-of-7 series will be
Wednesday night in Seattle before the
series moves to Houston for Games 3 and
4 Saturday and Sunday.
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
the Sonics present a difficult defensive
matchup for Olajuwon.
"Just look at the wingspan of those
guys," Tomjanovich said of the group
assigned to stop the Rockets center. "It's
tough to get it in to Hakeem."
Olajuwon was knocked to the floor 20
seconds into the second half when he was
elbowed in the hip by Pierce on a drive to
the basket. But he stayed in the game.
"I was a little sore but I'd just finished
a series playing a 300-pound center, too,"
Olajuwon said, referring to Stanley
Roberts of the Los Angeles Clippers.
Seattle's Shawn Kemp scored 14 points
and had 11 rebounds while Sam Perkins,
the hero of the Game 5 first-round clinch
ing victory over Utah on Saturday, added
II points and nine rebounds.
Perkins had to leave the game with a
strained neck after he was knocked down

while taking a charge by Vernon Maxwell
with 42.3 seconds left in the third quarter.
Perkins returned to try to defend Ola
juwon after Kemp picked up his fifth foul
with 6:01 left. Michael Cage, another key
defender on Olajuwon, fouled out with
2:20 gone in the fourth quarter.
Perkins held an ice bag on his neck
after the game.
"It's a little stiff but I should be OK,"
he said.
Pierce was 6 for 9 from the field in the
third quarter as the Sonics took a 76-70
lead.
The Sonics led 49-47 at halftime on
Johnson's 3-pointer with 0.2 seconds left
in the second quarter. Perkins hit a 3-
pointer with 29.5 seconds left to give Seat
tle a 46-45 lead.
Houston had runs of 10-0 in the open
ing quarter and 8-0 in the second quarter.
The Rockets were ahead 22-19 after a first
quarter that ended on a 15-footer by John
son as time ran out.
Seattle and Houston each won 55 regu
lar-season games and the Sonics have
homecourt advantage in the series

because they went 3-1 against the Rockets
this year.

The Rockets had gotten back into the
game with a 13-2 run capped by Otis
Thorpe's tip-in and free throw with 3:40
left. That was it for the Rockets as Gary
Payton made two layups and Derrick
McKey added two free throws in the final
1:26.
Houston had their chances toward the
end, but Kenny Smith was called for a crit
ical charging foul with 1:03 left and he also
missed a 21-footer with 22 seconds to play.
"Seattle's defense scrambles so much
jiind it makes it so difficult to get it inside
that you have to hit the open 3-pointer,"
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
"We had two wide open 3s and missed
both. We make one and that changes the
complexion of the game."
Houston finished 3 for 13 on 3-pointers
with Vernon Maxwell, who had 18 points,

I for 7 from that range.
Game 2 of the best-of-7 series will be
Wednesday night in Seattle before the
series moves to Houston for Games 3 and
4 Saturday and Sunday.
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
the Sonics present a difficult defensive
matchup for Olajuwon.
"Just look at the wingspan of those
guys," Tomjanovich said of the group
assigned to stop the Rockets center. "It's
tough to get it in to Hakeem."
Olajuwon was knocked to the floor 20
seconds into the second half when he was
elbowed in the hip by Pierce on a drive to
the basket. But he stayed in the game.
"I was a little sore but I'd just finished
a series playing a 300-pound center, too,"
Olajuwon said, referring to Stanley
Roberts of the Los Angeles Clippers.
Seattle's Shawn Kemp scored 14 points
and had 11 rebounds while Sam Perkins,
the hero of the Game 5 first-round clinch
ing victory over Utah on Saturday, added
II points and nine rebounds.
Perkins had to leave the game with a
strained neck after he was knocked down

while taking a charge by Vernon Maxwell
with 42.3 seconds left in the third quarter.
Perkins returned to try to defend Ola
juwon after Kemp picked up his fifth foul
with 6:01 left. Michael Cage, another key
defender on Olajuwon, fouled out with
2:20 gone in the fourth quarter.
Perkins held an ice bag on his neck
after the game.
"It's a little stiff but I should be OK,"
he said.
Pierce was 6 for 9 from the field in the
third quarter as the Sonics took a 76-70
lead.
The Sonics led 49-47 at halftime on
Johnson's 3-pointer with 0.2 seconds left
in the second quarter. Perkins hit a 3-
pointer with 29.5 seconds left to give Seat
tle a 46-45 lead.
Houston had runs of 10-0 in the open
ing quarter and 8-0 in the second quarter.
The Rockets were ahead 22-19 after a first
quarter that ended on a 15-footer by John
son as time ran out.
Seattle and Houston each won 55 regu
lar-season games and the Sonics have
homecourt advantage in the series

because they went 3-1 against the Rockets
this year.
NBA NOTES
BYE, BYE BOBBY
The Atlanta Hawks fired coach Bob Weiss
on Monday, saying it's time to hire someone
who can take the team past the first round of
the playoffs.
"It's not that it's been a failure, it just
hasn't been successful enough," general man
ager Pete Babcock said at a news conference.
Weiss guided the Hawks into the playoffs
this season with a 43-39 record. But the Hawks
lost three straight to the Chicago Bulls in the
first round. The Hawks have not made it past
the first round of the playoffs since 1988.
Weiss' contract expired at the end of the sea
son. Babcock said Weiss was offered a job in the
organization Monday, when he was told he
would not return as coach, but did not immedi
ately accept.
Babcock said no timetable had been set to
find a successor, but he and team president
Stan Hasten would like to hire a coach by next
month, when the league's pre-draft camp
opens.
Babcock said he was looking for a coach with
strong leadership abilities.
