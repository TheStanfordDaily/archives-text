# Batters try to lasso Broncos, buck .500
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Success is relative, even for
the tradition-laden Stanford
baseball team.
With a 24-24 record and seven
games remaining on its schedule,
Stanford is in danger of finishing
with a losing record for the first
time in head coach Mark Mar
quess's 17-year reign.
That is exactly where Mar
quess expected his team to be.
"Before the season began, the
other coaches and I got together
and set a goal for our team,"
Marquess fiaid. "We said to finish
over .500 would be a good year
for us."
Fielding a lineup of as many
as five freshmen, the Cardinal
has taken its blows this season,
particularly in the talent-heavy
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division, where the squad has a
9-18 record.
But the future is bright for
the team, which wraps up its sea
son with non-conference games
against Santa Clara and UNLV
and a three-game home set with
UCLA.
"It's not that we're giving up
on the season," said freshman

pitcher Dan Reed after Stanford
defeated California 6-4 Sunday
at Sunken Diamond. "But we're
beginning to look ahead to next
year."
With ievery starting position
player slated to return to the
Farm ne xt season, the Cardinal
will have a plethora of experi
enced veterans contending for
playing time in both the infield
and outfield.
But Stanford will probably
lose its top two starting pitchers,
Willie Adams and Andrew Lor
raine, by way of the 1993 profes
sional dra ft.
That isi what makes the sea
son-ending performances of
hurlers like Reed important.
Reed, v/ho has had an up-and
down yeur in fulfilling both
starting i:ind long relief duties,
has put tc >gether two consecutive
impressive performances.
In the first, the left-hander
came on in the fourth inning of a
tight against powerful
Arizona State and held the Sun
Devils to ia single earned run in
five innings of work. On Sunday,
Reed goi. the starting nod
against the Bears and gave up
three runs, two earned, in his
first two innings.
But the freshman settled
down after that. Reed retired
nine consecutive batters in the
sixth, seventh and eighth
frames, and took a 6-4 lead into
the ninth.
The first two Cal batters
reached base safely in the final

inning. Yet Reed, whose longest
previous outing was seven
innings, remained in the game.
Thanks to a line-drive double
play and a fly out, Reed finished
out the inning and the contest,
picking up both his first com
plete game and first Six-Pac win
of the season in the process.
"After he got to the eighth, I
really wanted him to finish the
game," assistant coach Dean
Stotz said. "A complete game
sets the tempo for next year."
That is not to say that the

problem anymore.
Winning's the prob
lem.'

Cardinal has forgotten about this
year.
"The thing that disappoints
me is that we haven't gotten a lot
better," said Marquess. "We have
to get better by the end of the
season."

Today's game at Santa Clara
should go some way towards
showing just how much the Car
dinal has progressed. After
smoking the Broncos (24-28-1)
twice at home, 8-1 and 10-2,
Santa Clara crushed Stanford in
a 13-2 decision at Buck Shaw
Stadium.
Such inconsistencies can no
longer be blamed on youth,
according to Cardinal designated
hitter Nate Olmstead.
"Youth's not really a problem
anymore," said Olmstead, who
was 5-for-ll against Cal last
weekend. "Winning's the prob
lem."
