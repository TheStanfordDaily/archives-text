# Batters try to lasso Broncos, buck .500

Success is relative, even for
the tradition-laden Stanford
baseball team.
With a 24-24 record and seven
games remaining on its schedule,
Stanford is in danger of finishing
with a losing record for the first
time in head coach Mark Mar
quess's 17-year reign.
That is exactly where Mar
quess expected his team to be.
"Before the season began, the
other coaches and I got together
and set a goal for our team,"
Marquess fiaid. "We said to finish
over .500 would be a good year
for us."

as five freshmen, the Cardinal
has taken its blows this season,
particularly in the talent-heavy
Pacific 10 Conference Southern

pitcher Dan Reed after Stanford
defeated California 6-4 Sunday
at Sunken Diamond. "But we're

playing time in both the infield
and outfield.
But Stanford will probably
lose its top two starting pitchers,
Willie Adams and Andrew Lor
raine, by way of the 1993 profes
sional dra ft.
That isi what makes the sea
son-ending performances of
hurlers like Reed important.
Reed, v/ho has had an up-and
down yeur in fulfilling both
starting i:ind long relief duties,
has put tc >gether two consecutive
impressive performances.
In the first, the left-hander
came on in the fourth inning of a
tight against powerful
Arizona State and held the Sun
Devils to ia single earned run in
five innings of work. On Sunday,
Reed goi. the starting nod
against the Bears and gave up
