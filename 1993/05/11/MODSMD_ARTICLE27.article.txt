# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Beat Cal. From their first days on the
Farm, that axiom is pounded into fresh
men's heads. If all else fails, beating those
Bears back to Berkeley can help salvage an
unsuccessful season. This lesson has been
learned well by the two freshmen The Daily
has chosen as its Athletes of the Week. While
pitcher Dan Reed was blowing away Cal bat
ters from the mound, classmate Dena Dey

was blowing by Cal runners on the track,
both helping the Cardinal dominate its East
Bay rivals on Sunday.
A native of Mclean, Va., Reed has strug
gled through a difficult rookie year with the
Stanford baseball team. He yanked the
proverbial monkey off his back Sunday with
a complete-game victory over the Bears,
pushing his record to 4-4. Winless in his last
three conference starts, Reed scattered 11
hits over his nine innings of work, display
ing exceptional control by striking out five
while walking none. After giving up three
runs in the first two innings, Reed settled
down and didn't allow a ball out of the
infield after the sixth. The victory was
Reed's first as a starter since February 15
and the first conference win by a Cardinal
pitcher other than Willie Adams and
Andrew Lorraine.

Two-sport athletes are a rarity in colle
giate athletics, but those who do change uni
forms with the changing of the season tend
to be standouts in both sports. Dey, from
Mercer Island, Wash., fits this mold quite
nicely. As a starting forward on Stanford's
top-ranked woman's soccer team, Dey scored
11 goals-third best on the team.
Replacing the soccer cleats with track
spikes in the spring, Dey has been a top point
gatherer for the women's track team as well.
Her performance on Sunday typifies her
entire season. She began the day by leading a

Cardinal sweep of the 1500 meters, record
ing a season-best time of 4 minutes, 34.30
seconds in the process. Later in the after
noon, she came from behind to win the 800
in a blazing 2:14.24. Dey has already quali
fied for the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in both events.
All Dey needs to do now is find a winter
sport.
