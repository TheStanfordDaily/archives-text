### 
DENVER (AP) — Armando
Reynoso wasn't even on the Col
orado Rockies' roster when they
opened the season. Now, he has
accounted for half of the team's
four complete-game pitching per
formances.
Reynoso, consistently sidestep
ping disaster like a bullfighter in
his native Mexico, scattered 13
hits in leading the la;3t-place
Rockies over the NL West Divi
sion-leading San Francisco Giants
7-4 last night.
The win, which snapped a five
game losing streak as well as a
six-game skid at home, was wel
come relief for the Rockies, who
surrendered 46 runs in being
swept by Atlanta in a four-game
series that ended Sunday.
"This picks our bullpen up,"
manager Don Baylor said. "They
got a day off. We were 100 king for
a complete game, and now we're
looking for David Nied to go out
tomorrow and hopefulty follow
the same pattern."
The Rockies got to Trevor
Wilson (0-3) for three first
inning runs. Joe Girardi walked,
Jerald Clark was hit by a pitch
and Dante Bichette hit a three

run homer — his fourth of the
season but only his first at
homer-friendly Mile High Stadi
um.
Colorado got another run in
the second when Vinny Castilla
walked, went to second on a
groundout and scored on Nelson
Liriano's single.
Reynoso put the Rockies up 5-
l with his homer that just eluded
the leaping Bonds in left field. It
was the first-ever homer by a Col
orado pitcher.
Reynoso (2-1), giving the Rock
ies his third solid outing since
being called up from Triple-A Col
orado Springs on April 29, yielded
si ngle runs in the first and sixth
innings and worked out of jams
on two other occasions — both
times retiring Wilson on double
play grounders. Reynoso allowed
fouir runs, struck out eight and
wajlked two.
With a crowd of 50,705, the
Rockies have drawn 302,152 in
the first five games of their cur
rent homestand. That's more
fans) than five major-league teams
(Montreal, San Diego, Cleveland,
Detroit and Milwaukee) have
drawn all season.
