# Gender production looks for more input
## 'Sex in the 90s' recruiting, training for next year's production 
### Colleen Krueger Dina Updegraff Staff writers 
By recruiting student scriptwriters and
turning an ear to the opinions of males, stu
dents of color and those with disabilities, orga
nizers of next year's "Sex in the "90s" presen
tation hope to make "student input" a key ele
ment of the annual program.
More than 100 positions are now open for
actors, facilitators and scriptwriters to work on
the freshman orientation program, which ad
dresses sexual activity, assault and diseases in
the context of Stanford experiences.
Organizers of this year's "Sex in the '90s"
program said they will be working with stu
dents throughout the remainder of the school
year to produce a "believable and timely" 1993

program.
Sexual assault-prevention educator Caro
line Mitchell said she hopes that beginning the
process early will allow for more student input,
therefore producing a more believable, "in
touch" script.
"The students know what the issues are
here," said Mitchell, in an open invitation for
student ideas on script material. "By starting
this thing early, we're trying to really get to the
heart of the problem."
Although the basic structure and agenda of
the program will remain the same, changes will
also be made in the content of this year's pre
sentation.
The 1993 performance will include more of
a focus on abstinence as a viable option of both
birth control and "safer sex."
"We also need to include men and their

needs, and show men as positive role models,"
Mitchell said. "We need men's voices . . . that's
definitely not something I can really do alone."
Mitchell added that she would like to in
clude more students of color and students with
disabilities both on stage and as facilitators.
Without these two groups, a wide array of
views on sex would be impossible, she said.
"I'm not sure exactly how (these changes)
are going to be made," Mitchell said. "We're re
ally hoping that students will ultimately be the
ones to determine that."
Although the program has been entirely
funded by the ASSU in previous years, the fi
nancial burden for this year's "Sex in the '90s"
will be shared by the Office of Residential Edu
cation.
