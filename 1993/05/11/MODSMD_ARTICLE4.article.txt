# Two SAE pledges arrested for theft
## Toga party participants found with stolen sheets from Hyatt 
### Nick Kuritzky Staff writer 
Two Sigma Alpha Epsilon
pledges were arrested outside
Donner House by Palo Alto police
Saturday for stealing linen they
planned to sport at an SAE toga
party.
The two freshmen, Allen
Joseph Johnson and Douglas
Michel, were booked on one count
of petty theft each — a misde
meanor — and released on a cita
tion the same night.
Michel denied "any knowledge
or participation" in the incident.
Johnson said, "Actually, I don't
know anything about it."
Michel and Johnsaon allegedly
made off with bed sheets from the
Palo Alto Hyatt at 4290 El Camino
Real.
Hyatt employees became suspi
cious when they saw the two
quickly entering and leaving an
"employees only" storage facility.
The theft, which occurred at 6

p.m. Saturday, was immediately
reported by employees who de
scribed the suspects and the red
jeep they were driving.
According to Palo Alto Police
Sgt. John Costa, the pledges, still
in their jeep, were spotted on the
Stanford campus by an officer of
the Stanford Department of Pub
lic Safety.
A witness from the hotel was
called, immediately made a posi
tive identification and placed
Johnson and Michel under a citi
zen's arrest.
Sgt. Costa said that the two
were found in possession of six
linen sheets worth about $42.
Johnson told him that the sheets
were "taken for a toga party"
planned at SAE later that
evening.
When asked about the theft,
SAE house president Allan Hen
delman replied, "I don't think that
it is true. No comment."
This theft follows the
announcement of an Interfrater
nity Council investigation into
possible SAE violations of the
University's dry Rush policy.
Director of Student Affairs
Nanci Howe called the incident
"really stupid." She said the SAEs
could face "fines, community ser
vice, or special training."
"The SAEs will once again go
before the Board and once again
face scrutiny," said Heather
Dunn, coordinator and fraternal
adviser of the Greek Judicial
Board. "Unfortunately, this year,

the SAEs have had a number of
problems within their house."
Dunn said the fraternity
could face collective punishment
since more than one student
was involved and the incident
was related to a fraternity activ
ity.
"We have worked so hard with
the SAEs," Dunn added. "I really
thought the house was back on
track. The situation really sad
dens me."
Matt Moran of the Greek Judi
cial Board said that despite these
allegations, most fraternities
behave well.
"If the allegations were true, it
would be unfortunate if they
reflected badly on the entire
Greek system," he said.
