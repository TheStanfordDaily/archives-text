## University committee debates conflict of interests in research 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The University Committee on
Research affirmed yesterday that
faculty research could face new re
strictions under a recently pro
posed revision of the University's
conflict of interest policy.
Yesterday's two-hour open dis
cussion about the draft policy
under consideration by the com
mittee was held in an effort to elic
it input from students, faculty and
administrators. Approximately 20
people attended the session.
The revision more clearly delin
eates the limits imposed on faculty
commitments outside the Univer
sity. Current guidelines on con
flict of interest do not state what a
professor is required to do in case
of a potential conflict.
"It is time that we get some
input from members of the campus
community," said Biology Prof.
Craig Heller, the committee chair.
"It's important to me that we thor
oughly examine current policies
and guidelines and any necessary
alterations."
The element of the propos
al is its requirement that faculty
members submit information about
their activities to the deans of the re
spective schools on an annual basis.

This information would reveal
any conflicts of interest involved
in current research activities.
"The intent here is to give the
dean the basis to deal with com
plaints," said Heller.
"At the beginning of the year it
was expressed to me that our poli
cies on conflicts of interest were
fragmented and probably not ade
quate to deal with current situa
tions at Stanford," he added.
But during the debate yester
day, questions arose about the ef
fectiveness of the recommenda
tion — specifically addressing the
issue of how to ensure that faculty
members submit accurate infor
mation in their reports.
"I'm a fairly strong advocate of
personal privacy in things that
don't need to be looked into," ex
plained committee member Ken
neth Howard. "But this is differ
ent — this is in the spirit of the
honor code."
In addition to requiring activity
reports, the policy will require fac
ulty to spend more time on cam
pus. "We want to raise conscience
that there are obligations to the
University — many of which re
quire presence on campus," said
Heller.
Though there was some argu
ment at the meeting over the
specifics of how much time facul
ty would be required to spend on
campus, the committee defended
its recommendation that a "sig
nificant" amount of time be
spent.
But Heller said the exact
requirements on faculty involve
ment should not be universal.
"The standard we are establish
ing here is one that needs to be
set down by the individual
schools," he said.
The committee also argued
that its policy would not add to
the University bureaucracy.
"We don't want to establish a
new level of paperwork," said
Heller. "That hides the real
issues."
Because individual schools will
oversee the disclosure process
internally, the creation of addi
tional administration will be
unnecessary, he added.
The committee also presented
a plan to alter the process that
faculty members follow in receiv
ing patents for inventions.
"There are two issues," said
Associate Dean of Research Pat
Devaney. "One is disclosure of
inventions to the University
before the patent is applied for."
"The second option is whether
the University should change its
policy so that it receives rights to
inventions found with Stanford's
funds," sh added.
The committee's recommen
dation in its present form would
enact the former suggestion,
requiring full disclosure of activi
ties related to the invention.
"I don't know of any other
University. . . which does not
take ownership of inventions,"
said Devaney.
The general consensus was to
leave this part of the policy alone
and allow faculty members rights
over their own inventions —
mostly because, as one audience
member remarked, this is a
strong "selling point" for the Uni
versity.
When the committee com
pletes its review of the proposal,
it will be sent to a University
steering committee for approval
and final submission to the Fac
ulty Senate.
