# Stanford grads take off
## Astronauts Ochoa, Wisoff participate in NASA space shuttle missions

While the career plans of some stu
dents may seem up in the air, two Stan
ford graduates are using their degrees
to go into space â€” literally.
Both Dr. Ellen Ochoa and Dr. Jeff
Wisoff have launched nascent careers
as NASA astronauts: Ochoa has one
space shuttle expedition under her belt
already, and Wisoff is slated to fly on
the next shuttle mission.
Ochoa flew on her first flight April
8-17 as a mission specialist on the
Space Shuttle Discovery.
"We were not up there just to float
around the Earth; we had a job to do,"
she said. "However, it's an enjoyable
job and one that you never get tired of."
Ochoa said she first became inter
ested in being an astronaut during her
time at Stanford, where she received a
master's degree in science in 1981 and
a doctorate in electrical engineering in
1985.
"I knew some people who were ap
plying for the astronaut program at

NASA and I really didn't know much
about it," Ochoa said. "I got some in
formation from them. That's when I
became interested in becoming an as
tronaut."
Ochoa was selected for NASA's as
tronaut program in 1990 while she
was working at the Ames Research
Center, where she handled optical
recognition systems for space automa
tion.
Meanwhile, fellow Stanford alum
nus Wisoff is scheduled to fly on the
next space shuttle mission in June. He
could not be interviewed because of
NASA regulations.
Wisoff, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1982 with a master's in science
and a doctorate in applied physics in
1986, will be a mission specialist on
Space Shuttle Endeavor. While on the
mission, he and one other crew mem
ber will perform a space walk.
Ochoa said the objective of her
eight-day mission was to gather data
on the relationship between the sun's
energy and the chemical makeup of the

Earth's middle-atmosphere. NASA
then analyzed how these factors affect
the Earth's ozone level.
"It was a great trip," she said of the
exploration, which was the 16th flight
of the Discovery and the 55th flight of
the space shuttle program.
"It was really exciting, but of course
we were working hard too," she added.
Ochoa said she wasn't frightened
about the mission because she had
been training intensively for a year be
fore the flight.
"Nothing surprised me," she said.
"Because we were trained to overcome
many problems and we were concen
trating on looking at different meters
(on the control panel). . . and thinking
about the next step, I was not scared. In
fact, I was excited."
She said NASA hopes to schedule a
flight similar to her mission every year
over an 11-year solar cycle so it can
map out changes in solar energy and
see how these variations affect the at
mosphere.
Ochua was responsible for oversee

ing experiments which measured
chemicals in the ozone layer and those
contributing to its depletion.
She also operated the robotics arm
to deploy and retrieve the Spartan-201,
a free-flying payload designed to study
the velocity and acceleration of the
solar wind and observe aspects of the
sun's corona.
"Operating the robotics arm was not
nearly as difficult in flight as it was on
the ground because on the ground you
practice for every situation," Ochoa
said. "It was the part of the mission
that I was most on the spot for, so I fo
cused in on (robotics arm) activities
and they were fun."
She was assigned to the mission a
year before the flight and trained most
ly at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space
Center. During that year, she learned
about the shuttle systems and pre
pared for any in-flight problems.
Her instruction also included flight
specific training and learning how to

execute the various experiments
the astronauts would be perform
ing, for which Ochua learned how
to operate the robotics arm.
"It's a very busy year of train
ing," she added. "And the last six
months before the flight are espe
cially busy. NASA tries to make
it as flight-like as possible."
Ochoa explained that even
though the astronauts took
more than 8,000 pictures, she
never got tired of looking at the
Earth.
"We were able to see every con
tinent, most of them in good
weather," she said.
"The Earth is a beautiful
sight," she added. "It's fun look
ing at certain areas, especially if
you are familiar with them. [The
flight] is something that I've
wanted to do for a long time and
it was as good as I had hoped. I
am looking forward to doing it
again."
