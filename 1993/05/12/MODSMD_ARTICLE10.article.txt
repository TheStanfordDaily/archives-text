WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton said yesterday he is considering
sending U.S. troops to the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia as part
of a U.N. force to keep the war in Bosnia
from spreading.
The president discussed the possibil
ity of sending troops to Macedonia in a
two-hour meeting with senators after
returning from a trip to Illinois.
"It's certainly an option that is active
and being considered," Sen. Sam Nunn,
the chairman of the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee, told reporters after
ward.
Nunn also said Clinton was interest
ed in the possibility of putting U.N.
monitors on the Serbian border to mon
itor a promised cutoff of supplies to
Bosnia's Serbs.
Nunn said Clinton intends to pursue
the idea with European allies, who have
been reluctant to follow the president's

call for air strikes against Bosnian
Serbs and the lifting of an arms embar
go on Bosnian Muslims. Despite the
allies' hesitation, Nunn said, "I don't
think the president is backing off."
Questions about U.S. military
involvement in Bosnia confronted Clin
ton during a visit to the Chicago suburb
of Bensenville. Challenged by a high
school student to square his call for mil
itary action in Bosnia with his Vietnam
War opposition, Clinton said there is
"much more we can do" without getting
mired in a Vietnam-like conflict.
He said of the idea of peacekeeping
troops in Macedonia, "It's been dis
cussed but no final decision has been
made." The goal of such a deployment,
said White House press secretary Dee
Dee Myers, would be "to keep the war
from spilling over into other areas."
Clinton told a gymnasium audience
at Fenton High School in Bensenville:

"We want to try to confine that conflict
so it doesn't spread into other countries
like Albania, Greece and Turkey."
Clinton, shaking hands with a crowd
in Elk Grove, 111., before returning to
Washington, was asked about Bosnia
several times.
"The United States cannot go in
there and get involved in the civil war,"
he told one man. But he added that
there were other ways for the United
States and its allies to pressure the war
ring parties to end the fighting.
Several people urged him not to send
U.S. troops and one asked Clinton if sanc
tions would be enough. He said, "They're
working, but not quickly enough."
Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Biden, who
supports U.S. military force in Bosnia,
unleashed a scathing attack on Euro
pean allies, calling their lack of action to
stop the killing of Muslims there "moral
rape."
