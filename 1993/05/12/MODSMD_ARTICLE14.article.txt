## Storage nightmare 
### 
The ASSU Senate dealt
foolishly with summer
storage from the start

THE ASSU HAS outdone
itself again — this time at a
high price for students.
After realizing that large tin
bins would be an abysmal failure
as a summer storage option, the
ASSU has abandoned its plan to
spend $15,000 on the containers
and has left students scurrying for
options.
Even more amazing than the
ineptitude of this proposal is the
fact that no ASSU member realized
how problematic the plan would be.
Indeed, it took an electrical engi
neering professor's comments to
alert the ASSU to the idiocy of
large metal bins left outside in the
sunlight for three months, braving
the elements and potential theft:
most students would not have felt
comfortable storing their socks in
the bins — much less anything
remotely valuable.
But the ASSU's biggest failure
was not the decision to purchase
the bins; it was waiting until such
a late point in the year to act on the
issue.
The ASSU has known since last
year that the University would not
be providing summer storage for
students this year. Instead of
beginning immediately on the
problem, the ASSU sat around dis
cussing endless possibilities as
time marched on, and never took
any action.
Senators asked University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper during
meetings what the University was
doing about the issue; yet they
themselves seemed to be making
no plans for what they had been
told was the inevitable. Did they
think the problem was going to
remedy itself? Was Casper going to
decide one morning that Hoover
House would make a lovely storage
site for students? Wouldn't the

most intelligent response be to
plan for the worst and hope for a
pleasant surprise?
So now, with a month remaining
in the school year, the ASSU has
told the student body that it will
try to make some arrangements
with off-campus private storage
facilities. It doesn't take a genius
to realize that, with approximately
12,000 students looking for stor
age, off-campus storage facilities
are filling up quickly. Students
don't have time to wait for con
crete plans from the ASSU, and,
since the ASSU has failed to come
through so many times in the past,
who can trust them?
The summer storage issue is one
of such importance to the majority
of students that the ASSU should
have made it top priority. But in
the end, through the course of an
entire school year, 40 of the
school's leaders couldn't come up
with a better solution than the
abandoned steel-bin proposal.
Graduate senator Derek Miya
hara explained that this situation
highlights the need for a Council of
Presidents — because such a group
can work on issues like these daily,
as opposed to the Senate which
only meets every two weeks.
But the sad fact is that, with
more than 35 weeks between Ori
entation to Commencement,
there was more than enough time
to dream up and execute a pro
posal that would've helped stu
dents.
The summer-storage fiasco
should serve as a valuable lesson
about advance planning to every
senator. Hopefully, as senators see
their fellow classmates stuffing
their valuables into cars and head
ing off to storage spots at the end
of the year, they will be engulfed in
the guilt of knowing they let their
constituents down in a tremen
dous way.
And while students may think
they got nothing out of the entire
ordeal, they too learned a valuable
lesson: the ASSU cannot be count
ed on to serve even the most basic
student needs.
Thanks for nothing.
