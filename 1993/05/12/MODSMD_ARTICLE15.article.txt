Smokers 9 rights end when nonsmokers are harmed

I AM WRITING IN response to Stew
art Richardson's May 6 letter con
cerning the proposed changes to the
University policy on smoking. Richard
son writes that he is tired of the insults
and comments he attracts when smok
ing in public, claiming that these people
are "self-righteous" and
"hypocri[tical]."
I agree that a total stranger asking a
smoker from across the street whether
• he was hoping to get lung cancer is
• both rude and completely unconstruc
• tive. However, I cannot feel sorry for
! smokers who have to put up with com
; ments, stares or even (God forbid!)
coughing from strangers. Have smokers
• ever considered not only the inconve
• nience, but the downright harm they
' are doing to non-smokers around them
' when they smoke?
; If it were only that cigarette smoke
smelled bad, I am sure that most non

smokers, including myself, would
merely grin and bear it. Unfortunate
ly, studies have shown that second
hand smoke may be twice as unhealth
ful for the human body as primary
smoke. Thus, when someone decides to
smoke a cigarette, just to "relax," close
to me, even if it is outside, I get very
angry.
It is very difficult for me to have
respect for someone who is knowingly
and selfishly doing harm to my health.
The insults and comments, although
they are not in any way helpful, are
expressions of frustration by non
smokers who sometimes find it very
difficult to escape from cigarette
smoke.
The tobacco lobby and smokers'
rights groups have spent millions of
dollars fighting against smoking restric
tions, stating that it is an American's
constitutional right to smoke. I fully

agree, until that smoke enters my sys
tem. Then you are infringing upon my
right to breathe clean air, in addition to
causing me potential bodily harm. It is
not within anyone's rights to hurt or
assault another person, but that is
exactly what smokers are doing when
they smoke in front of others, without
asking if those others mind.
Richardson seems to be particular
ly concerned with the fact that the
University is considering banning
smoking in all dorm rooms as well as
forbidding sales of tobacco in Tresid
der Express. What he does not men
tion is that the University is in the
process of installing smoke detectors
in every room by the end of the year,
increasing considerably the effective
ness of our presently inadequate fire
alarms. Should this effort be halted
due to concerns over "smokers'
rights?"

Furthermore, if the University is to
make its policy consistent, it must ban
sales of tobacco in Tresidder. The fact
that Stanford is gaining revenue indi
rectly from the sale of cigarettes in
Tresidder Express undermines its cur
rent policy concerning smoking on cam
pus and should be stopped. I strongly
urge the University to adopt the
stricter smoking policy immediately,
and I am convinced that many other
non-smokers on campus feel the same
way.
I also encourage students to call or
write to Mary Edmunds at the Office of
Student Affairs, telling her how they
feel about the proposed changes in the
smoking policy. It is necessary that
non-smokers have a strong voice, in
order to be heard over the vocal tobacco
lobby.
