# Irish-American group defends its role and purpose at Stanford
## 
### 
* We would like to clear up some of the
* confusion about the recently proposed
I Irish-American Studies class by respond
• ing to the second half of opposing edito
• rials that appeared in the May 3 issue of
I The Daily.
! The editorial argues that not all eth
nic groups have a culture worth study
ing, citing Armenian-Americans and
Croatian-Americans as examples. We
believe that any cultural group has the
right to learn more about itself, provided
there is sufficient interest.
Moreover, the editorial claims that
the expansion of course offerings in eth
nic studies "would imply ... that even if
you are an American, you are, first and

foremost, a (fill-in-the-blank)-American,
not someone who can identify yourself
primarily with other (fill-in-the-blank
with-a-diflerent-word)-Americans." We
contend that having an intellectual
interest in Irish American studies, Afro-
American studies, Croatian American
studies or any
"fill-in-the-blank" American studies does
not prevent you from being able to inter
act with other groups.
Furthermore, studying the culture of
an ethnic group of which you are not a
member in any way lessens your attach
ment to your own ethnic group(s). For
example, Chip is a proud Irish-American
mqjoring in African and Afro-American
Studies.
The editorial opposes the establish
ment of an introductory seminar on
Irish-American studies, claiming that
Irish-Americans do not have an
"unquestionably unique cultural and
historical [background]." The author

demonstrates that some members of
the Stanford community are unaware
of the unique contributions of Irish
and Irish-American people in music,
prose, poetry, politics and other are
nas. Hopefully, the seminar we are
proposing will dispel some of this igno
rance.
Finally, we do not feel that the semi
nar in question, or the Irish-American
Student Association, will lead to "frac
tionalization and isolation" on campus.
Our desire to contribute to the intellec
tual and cultural life on campus will not
splinter the Stanford community. We
have already mailed letters to 18 of the
other ethnic/cultural organizations on
campus, and look forward to positive
relationships with them.
We are eager to hear from anyone
who has questions about or interest in
the Irish-American Student Association.
Our next meeting will be held at the
White Plaza Bird Cage on Thursday

from noon until 1 p.m.
