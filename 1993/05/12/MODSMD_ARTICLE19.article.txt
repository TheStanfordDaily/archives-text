## Thinking about religion 
### 
JESUS IS relevant. That's what all
these flyers and pins are telling me.
Apparently this is Jesus Awareness
Week. Seven glorious days of Christians
coming out of the closet to extoll their
"deep"-seeded beliefs. Seven glorious
nights of non-Christians indicting it all.
And another week for the rest of us to
ignore all the noise. Because that's all a
bunch of bunk. I still have no idea what
all this "faith" stuff really means any
way.
The "Christians" are the people I see
stumbling around drunk at parties,
proudly displaying the cross hanging
around their neck. They are the ones
who shun the loners for their Christian
buddies. They're the ones so caught up
in self-righteousness that they refuse to
see the log in their own eye (that's a Bib
lical allusion for you there, all ye descen
dents of Abraham). They're the "faith
ful" ones that are afraid to pray at meals
or speak up in section because of what
people might think. If this Christianity
thing is so great, then why don't they
live it? And why don't they want to tell
me about it?
Perhaps they aren't so sure them
selves why they believe the things they
do. There are people who are Christians
because they were raised that way, or
because their friends are, or because it
just makes them feel good. Reasons like
these just don't seem good enough. Why

should I listen when even they don't
sound all that convinced?
But I'm not so sure that the unbeliev
ers have it right, either.
Those who declare the Christians
wrong are equally dogmatic and close
minded. Why are they so sure of them
selves? They embrace science or materi
alism or acceptance as their own person
al gods, yet scoff at religion because it's
"not good to irrationally attach yourself
to anything." There seem to be plenty of
atheists that argue for the sake of argu
ing, and don't even hear what they're
saying.
The very mention of religion seems to
trigger defensiveness in shallow thinkers.
Don't say you disbelieve because it's
impossible — I'd wager a slice of Late
Night cardboard that there are lots of
things possible that you wouldn't believe.
Don't say you disbelieve because religion
embodies a lot of stuff you don't agree
with (I've heard sexism, racism and other
-isms), because that is completely imma
terial. If it's true, then what you think
you know about it doesn't amount to a
warm bucket of spit.
Dogmatic adherence to shallow belief
amounts to arrogance. What makes you
so right? There have been people more
intelligent than any of us that have
believed and not believed in God.
But is this close-mindedness so
wrong? Yes.

Shallow acceptance of any faith can
lead too easily to hypocrisy. We have all
seen the "convert" who acts exactly the
same — or in some cases even worse.
Shallow acceptance of non-faith can just
as easily lead to self-deception. Like the
people who exalt rationality, yet in their
hearts cling to an irrational belief in some
external truth, be it morality, or some
"life-force."
Bottom line is that both sides have to
know why they believe the things they do.
So I want to issue a challenge. Use this
week to think about what you believe,
and more importantly, why. Christians,
talk to atheists, not to proselytize, but to
understand. Atheists, talk to Christians,
or go to events, not to be contentious, but
to listen.
In the end, we all rely on some kind of
belief — in the existence or non-existence
of God. For those who refuse to even
think about this stuff, they tire merely
refusing to articulate, let alone examine
the beliefs they are living by. It's a pretty
important thing to know where our con
victions lie and why.
It might be worth a little thought.
