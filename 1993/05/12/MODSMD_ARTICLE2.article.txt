# COP to create new 9-member cabinet
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The new Council of Presidents plans to ap
point a nine-member executive cabinet to as
sist the four elected leaders in examining stu
dent concerns and communicating with the
University.
"The cabinet will wear a lot of different
hats," said COP member Jason Snyder. "They
will be lobbyists, advocates, researchers — in a
sense, they will help the COP perform a lot of
its functions." Cabinet members are currently
being selected.
But some ASSU senators expressed reserva
tions that forming a cabinet will erode the
power of the elected senate.
"I find the creation of a kitchen cabinet a lit
tle disturbing," said undergraduate senator

Peter Cousins. "The students already have 40
directly elected senators.... If you take the
kitchen cabinet idea and utilize that as a law
making body, then you become removed from
the interests of the students."
Six of the nine cabinet members — all of
whom, like the new COP, will work without
pay — will each help direct ASSU policy in one
specific area: campus services, financial aid
and tuition, graduate student issues, multicul
tural issues, residential life and undergraduate
education.
The remaining three officials will supervise
ASSU public relations and programming and
will review plans for restructuring the organi
zation.
Snyder said cabinet members will also form
a University relations committee, to be headed
by a COP member.

Snyder said he was pleased with the number
of students who expressed interest in the cabi
net positions. Thirty-eight students applied for
the positions.
According to Snyder, COP members real
ized the need for outside assistance in per
forming their duties, especially since they will
be governing without salaries. While the con
cept of a "cabinet" is new, he said, COPs have
traditionally maintained a support staff with
paid interns.
COP member Ying-Ying Goh said the value
of the cabinet will lie in its ability to examine
the intricacies of campus issues, many of which
the four-person COP might not discover.
"Four COP members cannot do every
thing," she said. "There is such a huge scope of
issues, so much to do, that you
need a team to be effective."
Snyder said the cabinet will
ensure that the COP "does not
have 20 meetings a week." He
said that while cabinet mem
bers will have considerable
license in conducting their
respective examinations, the
cabinet and COP will convene
frequently to "discuss and
advise."
The cabinet will be chosen
from outside the existing senate,
Snyder explained, because the
senate is a separate governing
body.
"They're on their own. Sena
tors are not accountable to the
COP," he said.
However, there is "still going

to be a lot of coordination with
the senate," he added. "We want
to work closely with them."
On the other hand, Cousins
said the cabinet's creation could
portend a power struggle
between the two bodies. "When
they start pulling stuff like, 'our
executive cabinet says we should
do this' then we may have a prob
lem," he said.
Cousins further argued that
adding new officials to the ASSU
will hinder its overall effective
ness. "Too many cooks spoil the
broth," he said.
Graduate senator Neil
Crellin said the cabinet creates
"the potential for a small group
of people to have too much
influence, representing not
what students want, but what a
small group of power-mongers
want."
"I'm a little afraid that this
could be just lip service. By creat

ing this cabinet, the COP says
they are increasing student
input, and then just pass the
responsibility on to someone
else," he said.
Other senators, though, were
not as skeptical. "The COP is try
ing to address a lot of issues, but
there are only four of them," said
graduate senator Sanford Dick
ert. "They can use all the help
they can get."
Snyder contended that the
ASSU will benefit from more stu
dent involvement.
"The ASSU is never criticized
for having too many people
working for it,"he said. "We'll
be working with the cabinet and
the senate, towards the same
end."
New graduate senator Cecil
Huang said the ASSU quite sim
ply has nothing to lose. "It's like
the COP — if it doesn't cost us
anything, then why not?"
