# COP to create new 9-member cabinet

### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The new Council of Presidents plans to ap
point a nine-member executive cabinet to as
sist the four elected leaders in examining stu
dent concerns and communicating with the
University.
"The cabinet will wear a lot of different
hats," said COP member Jason Snyder. "They
will be lobbyists, advocates, researchers — in a
sense, they will help the COP perform a lot of
its functions." Cabinet members are currently
being selected.
But some ASSU senators expressed reserva
tions that forming a cabinet will erode the
power of the elected senate.
"I find the creation of a kitchen cabinet a lit
tle disturbing," said undergraduate senator

Peter Cousins. "The students already have 40
directly elected senators.... If you take the
kitchen cabinet idea and utilize that as a law
making body, then you become removed from
the interests of the students."
Six of the nine cabinet members — all of
whom, like the new COP, will work without
pay — will each help direct ASSU policy in one
specific area: campus services, financial aid
and tuition, graduate student issues, multicul
tural issues, residential life and undergraduate
education.
The remaining three officials will supervise
ASSU public relations and programming and
will review plans for restructuring the organi
zation.
Snyder said cabinet members will also form
a University relations committee, to be headed
by a COP member.

Snyder said he was pleased with the number
of students who expressed interest in the cabi
net positions. Thirty-eight students applied for
the positions.
According to Snyder, COP members real
ized the need for outside assistance in per
forming their duties, especially since they will
be governing without salaries. While the con
cept of a "cabinet" is new, he said, COPs have
traditionally maintained a support staff with
paid interns.
COP member Ying-Ying Goh said the value
of the cabinet will lie in its ability to examine
the intricacies of campus issues, many of which
the four-person COP might not discover.
"Four COP members cannot do every
thing," she said. "There is such a huge scope of
