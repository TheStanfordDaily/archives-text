## Computer screens and vivid e-mail dreams 
### 
Blame it on the information age. I
scoff at 976 phone-sex numbers. I
giggle at the personal-ads section of
the newspaper. I mock mail-order brides,
late-night TV ads for party lines and peo
ple who put their names on the Tresidder
Board or tape little notes to the cash reg
ister at the Coffee House looking for a
date in return for a free cafe latte.
Peasants.
However, there is one trend that's got
me in a full nelson, sucking the living
marrow out of what used to be my living,
breathing social life.
I'm an e-mail slut.
What, you gasp, is she talking about?
Has she turned into a study nerd, tunnel
ing deep into the bowels of Term an toting
one of those full-body, I've-just-done-
Europe-on-$5,000-and-two-bread
crumbs-a-day backpacks — wearing a tan
button-up shirt, OP corduroy shorts and
tube socks with an ecstatic navy-blue
stripe — writing messages to the techie at
the computer next to her?
Living vicariously through such decep
tive pseudonyms as Hulkster, Vixen,
Pelvicthrusts and Bodacious? Weaving a
web of intrigue expansive enough to
cover up one's own social impotence?
Failing to face the real world, and instead
hiding in the imaginary land of Cardinal
and Elaine, skimming through messages
as normal humans would through friends
in their dorm?
Yeah,so?
I'm hooked. I can't stop. And it's self
perpetuating. Now that I've got e-mail, I
write a few people each day. Now, every
free second could be an opportunity to

browse my account; you never can tell, I
might have a new message. Can you wait
a second? I'm gonna go check.
Waiter, a straight-jacket for my com
panion, please.
Damn .. . nothing.
I'm sane, I swear. I can still relate in
person to mankind at large, I promise. I
just don't choose too. Yeah, I just don't
choose to. I'd rather delve into the amaz
ing electronic world that howls to me
from the other side of the computer
screen.
Just another step down that happy
trail to the carefree kingdom of pathetic
ness, I have become an e-mail fiend. I
don't watch "Class of '96," I wouldn't
think of going to Mazatlan over Spring
Break, and even in my most excruciating
nightmares, I couldn't imagine driving a
forest green, urban-assault path-explor
ing Fourrunner with an "I love Lake
Tahoe" license-plate holder. Yet, the rap
turous e-mail trend has left me in its
wake.
Auto-save me.
Denying my fuzzy roots, I have
learned to brave the horrors of the
treacherous world of MaclP, daring to go
where no history and Spanish has
gone before.
I am a computer geek.
In our Cyberwhatever computer age,
e-mail is the rational transition from the
icy tundra of the telephone. It's the
aphrodisiac of the paranoid, those who
can't express themselves in person,
through any easily identifiable media.
There is no squeaky voice, no Valley-girl
accent, no stuffy-head, fever, so-you-can

rest nasal tarp on the screen.
You can pour out your heart, or pour
out your friend's heart — if she gives you
her password — and no one will ever
know about your gland problem.
Sweet.
You can actually "talk" to people who
only know those precious morsels provid
ed on your "plan." Year, major, full name
— can be all they know, if you want. No
"Were you sucking helium?"; no "God,
did you just wake up?"; no "Is your
Mommy home?" phone vulnerabilities.
It's all you, sporto. Everyone's hand
writing looks the same up on the big
screen, and the person you are is the per
sona you create. No risk. No danger. In
case you sketch out, you can Quit. You
can be that sultry demon you've always
wanted to be, that sensitive male your
frosh draw-group wouldn't understand,
that pervert you put in the closet in third
grade.
Choose your illusion.
And as you, oh slayer of hearts, pillar
of strength, champion of the weak,
offender of the most tolerant, metamor
phosize into the brand-new you several
times each day — changing moods and
attitudes as you should normally change
feminine-hygeine products, you forge
your own world.
You can talk with only those whom
you choose. You reply to those who merit
your attention. You pursue those who
pique your interest. You are in control.
And most likely they'll write you back.
Even at Stanford.
In fact, e-mail is the social steroid this
campus needs to get people out and inter

acting with their fellow mail. Go for the
gusto. Ask someone out. Be sociable for
the first time in your atrophied college
career. Even tame things, like asking
your hum bio T.A. a question, can be
done painlessly, with no money down,
and at no risk of personal injury or life
and limb.
Make them all pay for what they've
done to you.
Why, just last week I got mail from a
very nice young man working in Palo
Alto, who decided to write on a whim.
Having no personal connection to the
message's author, in his late twenties, I
could ei\joy his accounts of life in a com
puter company in the cultural mecca that
is Stanford's neighbor — all in the inti
macy of my own computer cluster. And,
I'm happy to say, he seems like a very
nice person, whom I would otherwise
never have met.
As we discussed the subject of Moth
er's Day, he even decided to open up to
me and describe his relationship with his
loving mother, with whom he's been liv
ing for the last seven years, since he grad
uated from college.
I myself was touched.
We now share a common bond, a veri
table friendship, if you will, that tran
scends the modum connection. Whether
or not we ever meet, he will know of my
alleged "nice" alter ego, and I will cherish
tidbits concerning his alleged office.
Relationships like this spring up every
day. Some fizzle out, and others become
concrete, evolving into "real"-life meet
ings. Though a bit flustering at first, you
could possibly meet your e-mail partners

in person. They could be extremely hand
some, stylish men dressed in all black
with mysterious auras; they could be star
athletes trapped in techie majors, yearn
ing to be free; they could be potential per
manent friends with singles.
Hold me back.
Even those you know in person can be
contacted, giving you leeway to peruse
the dark recesses of your soul in writing,
giving glimpses of the true you, on a less
permanent backdrop than your Garfield
stationery.
Let yourself go in a way that your
sniveling little id wouldn't allow you to in
person, telling your sweet prince how
much he's changed your life, and how his
star in your sky seems to be outshining
the moon lately. C'mon, you can do it. I'll
hold your hand.
Take a chance.
This e-mail thing is the greatest thing
since no-clump mascara. There's no limit
to its potential. Discover new worlds,
make new friends, annoy the hell out of
new acquaintances. It's all there, at your
"fmger"s. A magical galaxy in black and
white, whisking you away, taking a five
star vacation from the reality you only
have a partial grasp on anyway.
Don't forget to write.

Tish Williams is a hopeless computer
geek, whether she admits it or not, who
*loves* bronze chameleons.
