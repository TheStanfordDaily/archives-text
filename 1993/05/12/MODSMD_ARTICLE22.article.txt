## Scientists discover method to speed genetic research 
### Troy Parkins Editorial staff 
A new technique developed by
Stanford researchers is speeding
up the tedious task of gene map
ping and may provide quicker
and cheaper answers for geneti
cists.

'Matches that consis
tently pop up .. are
likely to be associat
ed with the trait of
interest.'
— Dr. Patrick Brown

The technique, developed by
Patrick Brown, a professor of
biochemistry and pediatrics, and
postdoctoral fellow Stanley Nel
son, could drastically reduce the
millions of dollars spent on DNA
analysis for gene-mapping pro
jects.
It also will increase the speed
with which researchers can col
lect genetic information. "The
amount of information that
might have taken two to three
months to collect can be gath
ered in just a few days using this
technique," Brown said.
The current method scien
tists utilize during genetic
research is called gel elec
trophoresis, which uses an elec
trical field to move DNA frag
ments through a slab of gel.
This method sortß the frag
ments by size.
According to Brown, gel elec
tophoresis has its drawbacks.
Scientists using it can only look
at one genetic marker, or
sequence, at a time — proving to
be both costly and time consum
ing, especially when investigat
ing the genetics of complex dis

eases like mental illness or heart
disease.
Researchers investigating
these complex diseases must
test throughout the genome and
analyze hundreds to thousands
of genes.
Brown's technique, called
genomic mismatch scanning
(GMS), differs from elec
trophoresis in that it analyzes
the whole genome at once. This
will allow researchers to exam
ine large numbers of genes in
short periods of time.
The technique will help
genetic investigators who are
looking into complex diseases or
even for types of genetic traits.
Complex diseases, like
schizophrenia, involve many
genes, spread throughout the
genome.
Researchers examining genet
ics that may cause traits like
artistic temperament or sports
ability will also find Brown's
experiment useful. "In order to
map and identify those genes
you have to analyze large num
bers of genes and people," Brown
said. Before GMS, such experi
ments were both costly and com
plicated, he added.
Scientists using GMS can
directly determine, with a high
reliability, if two genetic
sequences are identical. This is
important when it comes to link
age inapping and determining
what genetic sequences cause a
specific trait.
For example, assume one
takes genetic samples from two
people who have heart disease.
The samples are tested and com
pared for matching sequences.
The shared sequences, aris
ing from more than just chance,
may be the sequences that cause
propensity for heart disease.
Once the scientists have found
these sequences they can pin
point the chromosomal locations
of the shared sequences.

People who are related have
perfectly identical sequences
over millions of base pairs, while
non-related individuals have
numerous differences. The
method is able to detect the sim
ilarities between two DNA sam
ples.
The GMS technique, pub
lished in the May issue Nature
Genetics, takes advantage of a
set of bacterial enzymes, from
the bacteriumEscherichia coli,
that function as a DNA proof
reader.
The enzymes, in their natu
ral environment, seek out newly

synthesized strands of DNA
that do not match their tem
plate (original) DNA. The
enzymes mark the errors on the
mismatched DNA by marking
the portion of the strand that
needs repair.
Researchers said they believe
they can use these same
enzymes to research complex
genetic diseases. Using GMS,
investigators may look at a trait
like schizophrenia by finding all
the genetic sequences that
match perfectly between two
related people, each with the
trait of interest.

"Matches that consistently
pop up in comparisons of affect
ed individuals are likely to be
associated with the trait of
interest," Brown said.
Thus far, the researchers
have tested the technique on
yeast, which are much simpler
organisms than humans.
In order for the technique to
work on people, Brown must
make a few modifications. His
team is currently adjusting the
method so it will work on mice
and humans.
"There are no obstacles we
can see to applying it to human

DNA," Brown said.
There is plenty of interest in
the new method, Brown said,
mentioning that his first goal is to
show that the technique works.
His second goal is simplifying the
process so that all laboratories will
be able to use it.
An accompanying article writ
ten by Eric Lander, the director
of the Center for Genome
Research at the Whitehead Insti
tute for Biomedical Research in
Cambridge, Mass., predicts that
Brown's technique "is likely to
find wide and novel application
throughout genetics."
