# Could there be life on Mars?
## Bug roams to the Red Planet, patiently looking for life

— Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Total Recall"
Q: Is then life on Mars ? I know this sounds like a
kind of stupid question, but I seem to recall
something about a test that one of the landers did
that suggested that there were living things in the
soil.
— Stargazer
A: Now, now. As I've always said, there are no
stupid questions, only stupid people. And, hey, I
kind of like your question.
Since our species has sent an extremely small
number oflanders to the Red Planet, I'll take a wild
guess and assume that the "tests" to which you are
referring were performed during the Viking expedi
tions, a series of unmanned probes that set down on
Mars back when most Stanford students were still

After sampling the dust, the
GC/MS sent its answer hurtling
through the void ... The results
were unambiguously negative.
Forget 'War of the Worlds';
nothing on the Martian surface
could even give you an
annoying rash.

watching Saturday morning cartoons.
Along with machinery intended to take mea
surements on atmosphere, soil composition and
radiation levels, the Vikings carried a few compact
instruments designed to explore the possibility
that there might be some form of life in the soil of
our spaceward neighbor, conducting experiments
in "xenobiology," the study of foreign or unfamiliar
life.
The investigations employed two separate
strategies to look for life.
The more general approach used a machine
called a GC/MS — "gas chromatograph/mass spec
trometer" — whose function was the detection and
identification of any large organic molecules in the
;Martian soil.
* The idea is that regardless of how different a
hypothetical Red Planet microbe might be from the
creatures that populate our lush green world, Mar
tian life would still employ large, complex
molecules to perform catalytic functions and store
genetic information — the way Terran organisms
:use proteins, RNA and DNA.
• Ailer sampling the dust, the GC/MS sent its
answer hurtling through the void. In lay person's
terms, it said, "Not." The results were unambigu
ously negative. Forget "War of the Worlds"; nothing
on the Martian surface could even give you an
annoying rash.
The second battery of experiments were a little
more interesting: The Viking added a mixture of
simple sugars to a soil sample, hoping to observe the
carbon dioxide production characteristic of Terran
sugar metabolism.

Surprisingly, the instruments registered a
burst of CO2 — but it went away almost immedi
ately, before the energy supply was gone. This
result suggests that some exotic oxidizing mineral
present in the Martian soil converted a bit of the
sugar to COo before itself being exhausted. A
microbe woula have been expected to use up the
entire sugar supply.
No one is sure what exactly caused the carbon
dioxide burst, and the guy who designed the
experiment is still claiming that it constitutes evi
dence of life. He might, however, be a trifle
biased. Nonetheless, xenobiologists find these
mysterious puffs of COo intriguing enough that
they're planning to sena experiments to test oxi
dizing soil chemistry on the next expedition to the
Red Planet.
By way of control, both techniques gave positive
results in the barren soils of Antarctica. Hence, the
first assays for life on Mars seem to be conclusive
ly negative. But several objections might be raised
to the methodologies employed.
First off, we might have been looking in the
wrong place. The Viking landers set down in vast
desert plains because it was easy to land there.
Future expeditions with more interest in discov
ering life might land closer to the polar ice caps,
where there is (frozen) water and more of a fight
ing chance for life as we know it.
Another objection is wider in scope: Martian life
would not necessarily be totally unlike Terran life,
but the assumption that the two are at all similar
is egregiously flawed.
Gerry Soffen, the Viking project's chief scien
tist, once pointed out that although we'd like to
design experiments that could give us an assur
ance of detecting life very unlike our own, the fact
remains that the only kind of life we've have to
calibrate our equipment is Terran life.
One might accuse the Viking xenobiology
experiments of looking for Earth-like life in a very
non-Earth-like environment. Mars is extremely
cold, for one thing. For another, it has very little
in the way of atmosphere, and what it does have is
almost all COo. Finally, because Mars (like the
Earth of the 22nd century, if we maintain the
excesses of the status quo) has no ozone layer,
surface radiation levels are ridiculously high.
To put it succinctly: If there were life on Mars,
the safest assumption would be that it is so dis
tinct from the type we're familiar with that we
could hold it in our hands and not even recognize
it.
