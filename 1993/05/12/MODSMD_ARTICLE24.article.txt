# Beer, fuzzy navels, ADH?
## Columnist scoops science story behind the booze 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
There are two types of alcohol: the kind you learn
about in Chem. 33 and the kind you drank last
weekend.
But what about the differences between the
types of alcohol that people consume? Does beer
affect you differently than wine? Will a Bud Light
have less effect than a regular Bud? Why are some
drinks called "hard"? . .. Why ask why?
Why? Because alcohol is one of the most common
"drugs of choice" in the world. Yet, despite its famil
iarity, there are a lot of misconceptions brewing
about alcohol — what it is, how it effects the body.
To begin with, beer and wine are not alcohol —
alcohol is the name of one of the ingredients in these
beverages. Actually it is called ethyl alcohol or
ethanol. But are semantics important? Well, it is
important to make this distinction: Alcohol is some
thing contained in alcoholic drinks and not all
drinks contain the same amount of alcohol.
The difference in how much alcohol a beverage
has depends on how it was made, and I don't mean
whether it was blended or frozen. The true variable
is whether or not the alcohol was fermented once, as
in the case of beer and wine, or a few times as in the
case of hard liquor.
Fermentation is the process in which carbohy
drates are metabolized into alcohol in the absence of
oxygen. Sorry to disappoint you, but the carbohy
drates in pasta aren't going to turn into alcohol if
they are put into an airless container. It is the car
bohydrates in plants that are generally used to pro
duce alcohol.
All plants contain carbohydrates. Some of the
more commonly chosen ones are berries and grapes
(for wine), apples (cider) and grains (for beer).
For example, grain products used to make beer
make whiskey when they are further distilled.
Bourbon, on the other hand, is made from corn,
rum is fermented from molasses and vodka can be
produced from potatoes.
Beer and wine have a lower percentage of alcohol
than hard liquors, roughly 4 percent and 5 percent,
respectively. Liquor has a higher percentage of alco
hol. "Proof is a number describing how strong a
liquor is — and is twice the percent of the alcohol in
the liquor. For example, if a liquor is 100 proof, it's
50 percent alcohol.
Despite their different strengths, the alcohol in
them is the same and gets handled by the body in
the same way.
The body treats alcohol differently than it treats
other things you consume. While food has to hang
out in the stomach waiting while the digestion pro
cess breaks it down into useable components, a lot
of the alcohol you drink gets absorbed right away,
through the stomach walls into the bloodstream.
Once in the bloodstream alcohol makes a bee line
to the brain — that's why the effects of drinking can
be felt in a short time. If there is little food in the
stomach the impact is even greater because food
buffers the absorption of alcohol.
The first response the body (and the drinker) has
to alcohol is euphoria. Alcohol sedates the inhibito
ry nerves — the ones responsible for, you guessed it,
inhibitions.
But the stimulating effects of alcohol are really
illusory. Excitement and stimulation occur initially
only because there are more inhibitory nerves than

there are excitatory nerves in the body, giving the
suppression of inhibitory nerves a greater impact.
Eventually though, all of the body's nerves get
suppressed, changing the effects of alcohol in the
nervous system from stimulation to depression.
The brain also gets anesthesized, beginning with
the area where alcohol enters first — the frontal
lobe. This is the part of the brain responsible for
judgment and reasoning. When too much alcohol is
present in the bloodstream, the ability of the frontal
lobe to function properly is lowered and conse
quently the ability to think clearly diminishes.

The greater the blood alcohol concentration, the
greater the dysfunction of the brain. Speech and
vision centers of the brain are the next to go, fol
lowed by the cells of the brain responsible for large
muscle control.
These effects are readily observable. Blurred
vision, slurred words and a staggered walk are not
uncommon effects of drinking.
At even higher concentrations, the conscious
brain becomes completely "under the influence"
and shuts itself down. In other words, the drinker
passes out. This last defense for the body protects
the deepest centers of the brain — those that con
trol heartbeat and breathing.
However, it is possible for alcohol to be con
sumed so quickly that the brain receives a lethal
dose of it before it stops conscious functioning.
In California, one is legally drunk when their
blood alcohol concentration is 0.08 percent. Most
people will pass out at levels between 0.30 and 0.35
percent. At 0.40 percent people can become
comatose and die.
But all drinkers experience one effect of alcohol
even if their blood alcohol concentration is well
below these levels and that is an increase in the need
to urinate. This is because alcohol suppresses the
production of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the
hormone that normally tells the kidneys to absorb
water and excrete less. As a result, the kidneys don't
get the proper message and end up increasing the
rate of urination— hence the need to pee, frequent
ly, while drinking.
Urine loss has its effects too, causing dehydra
tion and sometimes a "cotton mouth" after drink
ing too much. Yet, one might think urinating is a
good thing because it gets alcohol out of the system,
however, along with the alcohol, you are losing valu
able nutrients.
The only true way to clear the system is through
the liver. Liver cells contain the enzyme needed to
oxidize alcohol, ADH.
Why ask why? Because despite the commercials
that show bikini-clad women and studly-looking
men flirting with each other while drinking
brewskis on the sand, there's a lot more to drinking
alcohol — if you already knew that, at least now you
know why the bathroom is the place to be at a party!
