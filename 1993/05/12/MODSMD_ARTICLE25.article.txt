## Larson hits 'far side' of career 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Cara Larson could aptly be named the
James Brown of the rowing circuit,
because she is most definitely the hard
est working woman in the crew business.
Describing herself as "always clawing
my way in there," Larson has translated
this valuable work ethic into success in
her four years at Stanford. Breaking
into the varsity boat as a sophomore,
Larson, now a senior and team captain,
has had a large impact on the fortunes
of the crew team ever since.
Growing up in Washington, D.C.,

'Everybody has a lot of
confidence in her, that
she's not going to back
off, she's not going to be
afraid and she's not
going to lose her head.'
— Wendy Davis

Larson had no crew experience before
coming to Stanford. Active in soccer and
swimming at Woodrow Wilson High
School, she wanted to stay active in
sports. As a freshman, she noticed the
crew table set up in White Plaza with
the motto "5-foot-8 or tough enough to
make the difference.''
"I wanted the opportunity to play a
sport, and this just seemed like the per
fect thing," Larson said.
Larson had little difficulty fitting
into the crew scene as a freshman. Eas
ily overcoming the early morning prac
tices, she used her strength and deter
mination to make up for her lack of
technique, securing a spot on the novice
boat.
"There were 10 frosh guys on the

crew team in my freshman dorm, so I
really liked the social aspect of practices
and early mornings," Larson said.
"What I've always loved most about
participating is the people, so I look for
ward to going to practice."
In addition to her year-round commit
ment to the crew team, Larson is a
human biology major with a focus in
international health care. As a junior,
she spent fall quarter in Central Ameri
ca. She studied in Costa Rica for a month
and spent two months in Nicaragua as a
community health worker.
"I knew nothing about it, but it
sounded exciting and dangerous," Lar
son said. "My parents just about had
heart failure, but I just fell in love with
the country."
Recently awarded the William J. Ful
bright Foundation Scholarship to spend
a year in a foreign country, Larson
plans to return to Nicaragua next year.
The scholarship covers a year's expens
es and was started by Sen. Fulbright in
the 1940's to promote freedom of infor
mation and cultural exchange. The pro
gram is a reciprocal exchange in which
the United States sends people abroad
and accepts citizens from other coun
tries. Around 20 Stanford students,
from graduating seniors to doctoral stu
dents, are awarded scholarships each
year.
"I lived with a family from Mexico
who came to Nicaragua to help improve
the health system and health aware
ness," Larson said. "They were operat
ing a small clinic in the town, and I just
thought, 'Here are people who are out of
their own country and have come to
another country because they feel like,
even though they have almost nothing,
they have more than these people have.'
The exciting thing about being in
Nicaragua is there is so little, that any
thing you do felt to me like a big deal."
Unfortunately, Larson picked up a
intestinal parasite and dropped 20
pounds before her return in January of
1992. Although she did not return to
the varsity boat that year, she still

helped the team to a second-place finish
on the West Coast:
"Cara's a really hard worker and a
tough competitor," said coach Wendy
Davis. "She wasn't strong enough to get
back to the varsity, but she led by exam
ple. She would run from station to sta
tion in the weight room when we did
weight circuits, something I'd been try
ing to get the varsity to do all season.
When they saw Cara doing it, everybody
started running."
Davis notes that Larson, although
not possessing the technical ability of
other rowers, makes up for any flaws by
effort, adding that people are more than
happy to be in her boat.
"She's not a technical goddess, but
the team still feels very comfortable
with her in the boat," Davis said. "All
the stuff she's able to do, she does it.
Everybody has a lot of confidence in her,
that she's not going to back off, she's
not going to be afraid and she's not
going to lose her head."
Larson has been forced to overcome
adversity again this year, as she, along
with several other members of the crew,
has been plagued by a rash of injuries.
Her awkward technique and body
motion have foreshadowed back prob
lems ever since she took up the sport,
and she finally succumbed to a mild
strain earlier this season. She has also
been fighting bronchitis for the last two
weeks, but plans to be ready for the
Pacific Coast Racing Championships
next weekend.
"Our philosophy this year with all
our injuries has been 'What happened
now? Oh, well, who cares?' " Larson
said with laugh. "We've gotten to the
point where that doesn't work anymore,
because we have to accept that a lot of
things have happened to us.
"What we have to do now is to look
around and realize how hard we've
worked all year and realize everything
we have done right and compare that to
things that have gone wrong. My goal is
to get the bronze, and I'll be very disap
pointed if we don't do that."
