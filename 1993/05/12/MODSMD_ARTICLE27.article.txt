# Lacrosse readies for leap to varsity ranks

When Stanford's women's
lacrosse program gains varsity
status in two years, the team
must be prepared to face a new
level of collegiate competition.
While currently competing on the
club level, however, the Cardinal
got a good preview of this high
level competition two weeks ago,
as it placed second in the Western
Women's Lacrosse League Final
Four Tournament in La Jolla,
Calif. Stanford advanced to the
finals with a solid 17-5 semifinal
win over UC-Santa Barbara on
May 1, then fell to UC-Davis by a
12-8 margin in the championship
game the following day.
Co-coaches Cecilia Paglia and
Kay Cowperthwait will expect
such outstanding results from
their team again next season, in
preparation for its move to the
ranks of other NCAA Division I
programs the following year.
"Next year, we will regard our
selves as a varsity team," Paglia
said. "We will be practicing six
days a week and find field space
when we can't get it. The commit
ment from the athletes is already
here, so we need to be intense and
ready to step up our game."
When asked what varsity sta
tus will mean to the team, Paglia
and senior co-captains Jessica Bar
and Robyn Norris mentioned
legitimacy, increased funding and
a greater interest in Stanford
from East Coast high-school
lacrosse players as benefits. By
promoting women's lacrosse from
its club status, Stanford also
hopes to be a catalyst in the
growth of collegiate lacrosse in
the West.
Norris, a transfer from Rut
gers who hails originally from
Pennington, N.J., pointed to the
fact that Stanford's top squad is

composed mainly of East Coast
natives.
While not on par with the East
ern version of the sport, "Califor
nia lacrosse is growing very rapid
ly," Norris said. "The sport's gov
erning body is very interested in
continued development of this
region."
Although Stanford will have
no scholarships to offer initially,
recruiting is already on the
minds of Paglia and Cowperth
wait. The team has received let
ters of interest from high-school
athletes from New York and
Philadelphia, since the March
announcement of the anticipated
move to varsity.
The Cardinal may also find
more interest from women cur
rently on campus. "There are a lot
of people on campus who played
lacrosse on the East Coast before
coming to Stanford," Norris said.
"For some, the current lacrosse
program was not quite what they
were looking for, and so they
became involved with other com
mitments. The change may bring
some of those people out next
year."
"Sometimes it is hard to get
people motivated or committed,"
Bar added. "But lacrosse is a real
ly big sport throughout the coun
try, and with more money,
revamped facilities and equip
ment and trainers, we will
become a quality Division I pro
gram."
Paglia agreed, adding, "Right
now, we are at a solid Division 111
level. Because Stanford is such a
strong institution, we will get
greater interest and improve rapid
ly. We believe we can be a top-10
program within a few years."
It may not be long, then, before
yet another Cardinal squad rises
to the national prominence that
defines Stanford athletics.
