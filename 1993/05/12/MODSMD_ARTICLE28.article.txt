# Pay college athletes? It could be time
## 
### 
Like it or not, I get paid to write this col
umn. As a student journalist, I ei\joy the
opportunity to market my skills while
still in school, gaining a degree of economic
freedom in the present, while earning valu
able experience for an independent future.
Journalists do not stand alone in partici
pating in this important facet of collegiate life,
either. On this campus, for example, students
hold paid positions in laboratories, libraries,
food service and University offices. Some per
form their duties as part of a work-study
financial-aid program, others as a way to
make connections that could lead to future
employment and still others as a means of
acquiring spending cash and a reason not to
call home begging for money as often as they
would otherwise.
Whatever the reason for holding down a
job, though, the working student always con
trols his or her economic fate, to a greater or
lesser extent. If one feels that work encroach
es on their studies, they may quit at any time.
If one feels that their extracurricular occupa
tion impinges on a reasonable collegiate social
calendar, they may clear some or all of their
work days accordingly. In any case, these deci
sions involve more or less money in the stu
dent's pocket.
Imagine, however, that the description of
liberty found above did not apply to you.
Imagine having to maintain long hours, a
heavy travel schedule and a charming media
presence in the face of severe restrictions on
every other aspect of your collegiate life. Imag
ine making more money for your collegiate
employer than any of your classmates, but not
receiving any compensation for your services.

Imagine, in other words, that you are a stu
dent-athlete, representing your school on the
football field, basketball court or baseball dia
mond. In fact, it probably hasn't occurred to
most fans, or even to the participants them-,
selves, but big-time college athletes are mod
ern-day slaves to an outdated system based on
outdated ideals.

Consider that when the NCAA was orga
nized over a century ago, it accounted for a
way of life far removed from that which we
know today. Competitors played largely for
pride, looking to round out their sporting
careers while readying for other occupations
in a rapidly-industrializing economy. In an
age when a college diploma was considered a
luxury at best, athletics were simply a crude
extension of high-school sports as we know
them, a rough yardstick by which to compare
the physical prowess of students who hap
pened to attend one school, with that of stu
dents who happened to attend another. Pro
fessional baseball had just attained promi
nence, pro football had not yet been invented
and basketball was just a gleam in Dr. Nai
smith's eye.

As the years went by, however, an interest
ing pattern developed. After World War 11, the
United States adapted to its role as the
world's top political and economic superpow
on the responsibillies associated^with new
technological capability. However, as prosper
ity increased, a leisure class developed, one
that propelled professional sports into the
prominent position they occupy today. Thus,
institutions of higher learning were faced with
almost-conflicting needs — to produce more
degree-holders and to turn out more profes
sional athletic prospects.
Colleges then pumped more resources into
departments like aeronautics and engineer
ing, in order to prepare their graduates for the
realities of the modern world; simultaneously,
they invested in new athletic facilities, often
to the point of giving athletics departments
autonomy from the goings-on of the universi
ty at-large. Departments started to recruit
their own subsets of students — academic
areas sought students who could pilot indus
try to victory in the Cold War, while athletic
arenas sought gladiators who could pilot the
school to victory in its battles with conference
and national rivals.
The quality of collegiate sports improved,
and network television, merchandisers and
advertisers from a wide range of industries
came calling, seeking an investment both to
endorse and subsidize events like New Year's
Day bowl games, Final Fours and the College
World Series. Now, the focus of competition
was shifted for good — rather than playing for


Andy
Elser
pride, schools wanted a greater
share of the economic pie that came
with greater exposure. Athletes
became what they are today, name
ly "hired hands" to be exploited for
their ability to draw a crowd.
Don't get me wrong, a scholar
ship-funded education is an oppor
tunity unto itself, but for the ath
lete who merely attends college for
the chance to attain a professional

goal (something each one of us does
in our own way), there must be a
better way. If these honest gladia
tors, who still receive no portion of
the fruits of their labor, could be
legally reciprocated on a set pay
scale above and beyond the terms
of their scholarships, the current
"black market" situation — in
which competitors simply go to the
"highest bidder" in under-the-table
dealings — would be sharply
reduced, if not eliminated.
Athletes, especially those who
come from socioeconomically
deprived backgrounds, would use

this "salary" as an incentive to
attend college and to be introduced
to the benefits of a well-rounded
education. Meanwhile, they may
enjoy the simple freedoms their
classmates already take for grant
ed.
After all, only slaves don't get
paid for their help.

ship-funded education is an oppor
tunity unto itself, but for the ath
lete who merely attends college for
the chance to attain a professional

goal (something each one of us does
in our own way), there must be a
better way. If these honest gladia
tors, who still receive no portion of
the fruits of their labor, could be
legally reciprocated on a set pay
scale above and beyond the terms
of their scholarships, the current
"black market" situation — in
which competitors simply go to the
"highest bidder" in under-the-table
dealings — would be sharply
reduced, if not eliminated.
Athletes, especially those who
come from socioeconomically
deprived backgrounds, would use

this "salary" as an incentive to
attend college and to be introduced
to the benefits of a well-rounded
education. Meanwhile, they may
enjoy the simple freedoms their
classmates already take for grant
ed.
After all, only slaves don't get
paid for their help.

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's
"invisible-handed" sports editors,
believes in the Lucas miracle and in
the Suns getting what they deserve
for killing part of him last Sunday.
