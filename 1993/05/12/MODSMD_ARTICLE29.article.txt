Pitching problems? What
pitching problems?
For the second-consecutive
game, a Cardinal squad
maligned by a lack of pitching
depth received a stellar perfor
mance from a relatively unher
alded hurler.
While Willie Adams and
Andrew Lorraine have emerged
as possibly the best one-two
pitching combination in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division, the rest of the Stan
ford staff has been inconsistent.
But things have shown signs
of changing lately. On Sunday,
freshman Dan Reed hung tough
for a gutsy 6-4 complete game
win against California. Yester
day, it was Greg Mix's turn.
Making only his third start of
the season, Mix limited Santa
Clara (24-29-1) to two hits in
tossing a 6-1 gem at Buck Shaw
Stadium in Santa Clara. The
righthander struck out a
career-high eight Broncos in
winning his second game of the
season.
"He kept his pitches over the
plate all day," said Stanford
catcher A.J. Hinch. "I don't
think'you can ever expect some

thing like that out of a pitcher."
Mix, who saw limited action
in his first three seasons in a
Cardinal uniform, has come
into his own this year. The
senior has pitched his way into
a major bullpen role and is fifth
on the staff with 14 appear
ances.
But Mix put together a
career-topping performance
yesterday, allowing only a sec
ond-inning single to Randy
Ortega and a seventh-inning
James Eidam home run.
Mix's performance was not
the only encouraging sign for
Stanford (25-24). The Cardinal,
while last in the Six-Pac with 38
home runs, hit two yesterday
afternoon and has amassed
seven in its last four games.
With two outs in the second
inning of a scoreless ballgame,
Stanford second baseman Todd
Laßocca connected on a full
count Bob Pailthorpe offering
for his fifth home run of the
season.
Pailthorpe (6-4), the West
Coast Conference's strikeout
leader with 93, then held the
Cardinal in check until the
fifth. Cale Carter, who had
three hits overall, singled with
