# Playboy searching for 'model-students'
## Magazine recruiting Stanford women to pose in 'Pac-10' issue

To get a girl from
Stanford is kind
of like saying,
"No matter how
intelligent, there
are still women
out there who
[will] acquiesce.'"
— Simone Spearman

'To me
feminism
is being able
to do whatever
you want to do
and not being
criticized
for it.'
— Justine Mattera

Less than four hours after an ad soliciting mod
els appeared in yesterday's Daily, six women had
phoned Playboy magazine's suite in the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn. One called to complain. The other five
set up interviews for that afternoon.
In a small room adorned only with a handful of
school banners and a Stanford sweatshirt mas king
taped over a lamp, photographer David Chan, make
up artist Karen Lynn and a Polaroid camera con
ducted 15-minute interviews with potential models
in an effort to add to the "nearly 15,000 coeds coast-

to-coast" who
have posed
for Playboy's
college picto
rials.

The "Girls of the Pac 10" issue, due out Sept. 7,
will feature "two to three" Stanford women, Chan
said. They will be nude, semi-nude or clothed, de
pending on what box they checked on the simple,
easy-to-read application which also asked the size
of their bust, cup, waist, hips and shoes.
Applicants were told to come to the interview in
whatever they felt comfortable wearing. Those se
lected will have been given two-hour makeovers

and photographed on a yacht in Sausalito this
weekend. The women will be paid on a sliding scale
depending on their choice of garments: $500 for
complete nudity, $300 for knickers and signifi
cantly less for sweaters, jeans and a frilly hat.
