# Playboy searching for 'model-students'
## Magazine recruiting Stanford women to pose in 'Pac-10' issue

To get a girl from
Stanford is kind
of like saying,
"No matter how
intelligent, there
are still women
out there who
[will] acquiesce.'"

Less than four hours after an ad soliciting mod
els appeared in yesterday's Daily, six women had
phoned Playboy magazine's suite in the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn. One called to complain. The other five
set up interviews for that afternoon.
In a small room adorned only with a handful of
school banners and a Stanford sweatshirt mas king
taped over a lamp, photographer David Chan, make
up artist Karen Lynn and a Polaroid camera con
ducted 15-minute interviews with potential models
in an effort to add to the "nearly 15,000 coeds coast-

to-coast" who
have posed
for Playboy's
college picto
rials.

The "Girls of the Pac 10" issue, due out Sept. 7,
will feature "two to three" Stanford women, Chan
said. They will be nude, semi-nude or clothed, de
pending on what box they checked on the simple,
easy-to-read application which also asked the size
of their bust, cup, waist, hips and shoes.
Applicants were told to come to the interview in
whatever they felt comfortable wearing. Those se
lected will have been given two-hour makeovers

and photographed on a yacht in Sausalito this
weekend. The women will be paid on a sliding scale
depending on their choice of garments: $500 for
complete nudity, $300 for knickers and signifi
cantly less for sweaters, jeans and a frilly hat.

they do a women of the Pac-10
issue — which had not been done
since 1985. In the letter, she said
she wanted to rectify a stereotype
the magazine created several
years ago by characterizing Stan
ford women as unattractive.
Mattera, who posed yesterday
in a g-string bikini, said she want
ed to be in the magazine because
"I think I need a final scandal
before I graduate."
Although she expects people to
talk behind her back, Mattera
said that people had been very
supportive — "particularly people
in fraternities."
Mattera said she felt in control
during her interview with Chan,
which she described as profession
al and not at all demeaning.
"I don't think you can be objec
tified if you don't feel objectified
yourself," she added.
Nor did Mattera feel that
bringing Playboy to campus — or,
for that matter, baring her
breasts for the magazine (she is
still deciding between the semi
nude and nude options) — is in
any way anti-feminist.
"To me feminism is being able
to do whatever you want to do and
not to be criticized for it," Mattera
said.
Another student, who asked to

remain anonymous, said she was
initially shocked at Playboy's ad
but decided to arrange an inter
view with Chan even though she
had never seen the magazine.
I had "this weird feeling in my
stomach — and I've had this feel
ing before. And it means to go for
it, to take a risk, to feel very
alive," she said.
The woman, who said she con
siders herself a feminist, justified
her decision on the basis of Play
boy's focus on academia.
"I think it's kind of neat to
bring in women with degrees —
women with personalities. It's not
just these brainless, buxom blon
des."
But Rebecca Bliss, coordinator
of the Women's Center, objected
to the notion that the pictorial
would honor the beauty and intel
lect of Stanford women.
"They're not going to get into
why they're doing their honors
theses. If they want to honor
women they don't need to do it
with their clothes off."
Bliss said that although she
respects the women's decision to
pose for the magazine, she "won
ders about their judgement."
"The Women's Center will not
be buying a copy," she said.
Simone Spearman, co-editor
of the G-Spot, a feminist literaiy
journal that printed a silhouette
of a nude couple earlier this year,
also said she was concerned
about the "Girls of the Pac 10"

issue.
"They can't print high-school
girls, so the next best thing is col
lege.
"To get a girl from Stanford in
this is kind of like saying, 'No
matter how intelligent, no matter
what her future plans are, there
are still women out there who are
still going to acquiesce, who are
going to agree with having them
selves objectified,' " Spearman
said.
"Then men can use this as an
excuse for saying, 'You want it.
You want us to look at you. You
want us to make catcalls, to put
you up on our wall. Because look
at this girl. She's smart. She's got
a future. Still she chooses to pose
for Playboy.' "
Spearman said Playboy's deci
sion to use the word "girls" in
their title — "Girls of the Pac 10"
— instead of the word "women,"
as in the last several years, is a
part of their effort to make female
Stanford graduates seem less
threatening.
Playboy Public Relations Man
ager Bill Paige said the decision to
use the word "girl" was made
recently and with little controver
sy in the editorial office.
"We went with 'women' for a
couple of years and now it's back
to 'girls.' I think everyone liked it
better — the readers, the editors
and the girls. I think it more
accurately describes what's going
M
on.

school banners and a Stanford sweatshirt mas king
taped over a lamp, photographer David Chan, make
up artist Karen Lynn and a Polaroid camera con
ducted 15-minute interviews with potential models
in an effort to add to the "nearly 15,000 coeds coast-

to-coast" who
have posed
for Playboy's
college picto
rials.

The "Girls of the Pac 10" issue, due out Sept. 7,
will feature "two to three" Stanford women, Chan
said. They will be nude, semi-nude or clothed, de
pending on what box they checked on the simple,
easy-to-read application which also asked the size
of their bust, cup, waist, hips and shoes.
Applicants were told to come to the interview in
whatever they felt comfortable wearing. Those se
lected will have been given two-hour makeovers

and photographed on a yacht in Sausalito this
weekend. The women will be paid on a sliding scale
depending on their choice of garments: $500 for
complete nudity, $300 for knickers and signifi
cantly less for sweaters, jeans and a frilly hat.
Senior Justine Mattera got the ball rolling in
December when she wrote to Playboy suggesting

they do a women of the Pac-10
issue — which had not been done
since 1985. In the letter, she said
she wanted to rectify a stereotype
the magazine created several
years ago by characterizing Stan
ford women as unattractive.
Mattera, who posed yesterday
in a g-string bikini, said she want
ed to be in the magazine because
"I think I need a final scandal
before I graduate."
Although she expects people to
talk behind her back, Mattera
said that people had been very
supportive — "particularly people
in fraternities."
Mattera said she felt in control
during her interview with Chan,
which she described as profession
al and not at all demeaning.
"I don't think you can be objec
tified if you don't feel objectified
yourself," she added.
Nor did Mattera feel that
bringing Playboy to campus — or,
for that matter, baring her
breasts for the magazine (she is
still deciding between the semi
nude and nude options) — is in
any way anti-feminist.
"To me feminism is being able
to do whatever you want to do and
not to be criticized for it," Mattera
said.
Another student, who asked to

remain anonymous, said she was
initially shocked at Playboy's ad
but decided to arrange an inter
view with Chan even though she
had never seen the magazine.
I had "this weird feeling in my
stomach — and I've had this feel
ing before. And it means to go for
it, to take a risk, to feel very
alive," she said.
The woman, who said she con
siders herself a feminist, justified
her decision on the basis of Play
boy's focus on academia.
"I think it's kind of neat to
bring in women with degrees —
women with personalities. It's not
just these brainless, buxom blon
des."
But Rebecca Bliss, coordinator
of the Women's Center, objected
to the notion that the pictorial
would honor the beauty and intel
lect of Stanford women.
"They're not going to get into
why they're doing their honors
theses. If they want to honor
women they don't need to do it
with their clothes off."
Bliss said that although she
respects the women's decision to
pose for the magazine, she "won
ders about their judgement."
"The Women's Center will not
be buying a copy," she said.
Simone Spearman, co-editor
of the G-Spot, a feminist literaiy
journal that printed a silhouette
of a nude couple earlier this year,
also said she was concerned
about the "Girls of the Pac 10"

issue.
"They can't print high-school
girls, so the next best thing is col
lege.
"To get a girl from Stanford in
this is kind of like saying, 'No
matter how intelligent, no matter
what her future plans are, there
are still women out there who are
still going to acquiesce, who are
going to agree with having them
selves objectified,' " Spearman
said.
"Then men can use this as an
excuse for saying, 'You want it.
You want us to look at you. You
want us to make catcalls, to put
you up on our wall. Because look
at this girl. She's smart. She's got
a future. Still she chooses to pose
for Playboy.' "
Spearman said Playboy's deci
sion to use the word "girls" in
their title — "Girls of the Pac 10"
— instead of the word "women,"
as in the last several years, is a
part of their effort to make female
Stanford graduates seem less
threatening.
Playboy Public Relations Man
ager Bill Paige said the decision to
use the word "girl" was made
recently and with little controver
sy in the editorial office.
"We went with 'women' for a
couple of years and now it's back
to 'girls.' I think everyone liked it
better — the readers, the editors
and the girls. I think it more
accurately describes what's going
M
on.
