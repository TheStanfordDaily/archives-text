# ASSU stalemates over senate chair
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
In its first meeting, the newly
elected ASSU Senate failed last
night to choose a senate chair
after four consecutive ballots be
cause of a split between under
graduate and graduate senators.
On the final vote of the night,
10 senators voted for graduate
student Greg Waldorf and 10
voted for undergraduate Mork
Murdock. Senators hope to re
solve the deadlock at the next
meeting in two weeks.
Acting senate chair Ron Brown
said he has the authority to break
the tie. "I'll probably take a poll of
the non-voting graduate and un
dergraduate senators" and re
spect the wishes of the majority,
he said.
Four candidates initially ran
for the position of senate chair:
graduate students Waldorf and
Sanford Dickert, and undergradu
ates Murdock and Greg Gilchrist.
Before the meeting began, Wal

dorf removed his name from the
ballot, saying that he did not want
to create dissent within the sen
ate. After the first vote was dead
locked, he decided to re-enter the
race.
The other candidates gave
speeches to the body at the outset
and explained their goals for the
next year.
"I'm interested in doing this
because I have knowledge of how
to get things done," said Dickert,
noting in particular his experience
as a senator.
Gilchrist and Murdock echoed
this sentiment in discussing their
own candidacies. "There's a po
tential for us to address real stu
dent issues," said Murdock.
However, Murdock quickly
came under fire when senators
were offered the chance to ask
candidates questions.
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins asked him why he left a
previous senate meeting during a
discussion of the senate chair's
salary. After his departure, the
senate no longer had a quorum
and was forced to end the session.
"That was my right as a sena
tor," said Murdock, defending his
actions.."lt should be noted that
when (the matter] came up for a
vote, I abstained."
But graduate senator Kevin
Murdock said he was concerned
about Mork Murdock's decision to
affect the quorum in an area that
directly concerned him as a senate
chair candidate.
Mork Murdock was also criti
cized by senators for campaigning
before the senate meeting.
"When Mork told me that he
had talked to a majority of the
people on the senate, I was
shocked," said graduate senator

Jerry Yang. "What kind of gov
erning body makes its decisions
before the meeting even
begins?"
Senators also found flaws in
Dickert's qualifications for the
position, arguing that he would
not be able to run meetings quick
ly-
"l think that it's important for
the senate chair to be a good lis
tener," said undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas. "He might have a
hard time with that."
After the first deadlocked bal
lot, in which Murdock received 10
votes, Waldorf decided to re-enter
the race.
"What we need here is an expe
diter," he said. "I don't have
much knowledge of the ASSU,
but my experience with running
meetings could clear up this con
troversy."
Waldorf, a first year student in
the Graduate School of Business,
received 10 votes in the second

round of voting.
Graduate senator Edward
Sharp said, in support of Waldorf,
"We don't want a person who will
manipulate the senate. We want a
manager."
Cousins agreed, saying, "He
seems to carry none of the politi
cal baggage and all of experience
necessary to run the senate effec
tively."
After the third and fourth bal
lots still produced a tie between
Murdock and Waldorf — largely
split on graduate-undergraduate
lines — it became clear that the
issue would not be resolved in one
night.
Graduate senator Kevin Mur
dock expressed concern that the
lengthy voting process was work
ing to further divisiveness
between undergraduates and
graduates.
"I am worried that this is
becoming a graduate against
undergraduate issue," he said.
