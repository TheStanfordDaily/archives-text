# Jones picked to lead next year's Fac Sen
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones,
who last year actively represented
faculty views in the budget-cut
ting process, has been elected
chair of next year's Faculty Sen
ate,
Jones said she hopes the body
will continue focusing on a broad
er range of academic issues now
that budget cuts are almost com
plete. The senate, she said, should
once again be "a forum for faculty
discussion of important Universi
ty issues."
Jones added that she expects
much of the senate's discussion
until the end of next year to focus
on proposals from the new Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation. The commission, proposed
by University President Gerhard
Casper in his April 29 "State of
the University" speech, will re
evaluate all aspects of undergrad
uate education.
Pediatrics Prof. William

Northway, the senate's current
chair, said Jones' election shows
how well-respected she is by the
faculty.
Northway added that he also
expects the senate to spend much
of next year discussing the Com
mittee on Academic Achievement
and Appraisal's review of the
grading policy.
He said not having to deal with
financial issues has allowed sen
ate members and the faculty in
general "to return to what we are
here for — education and re
search."
Jones also said she is pleased
that the senate's time — and her
own — is no longer dominated by
the indirect-cost controversy. The
senate has instead been able to
spend much of its time analyzing
academic programs whose re
views had been delayed by budget
cutting issues.
Last academic year Jones
served as deputy chair of the sen
ate Committee on Education and
Scholarship, which represented
faculty views in the University's
$43 million budget-cutting pro
cess.
Although she was not on the
Faculty Senate this year because
she had previously served for two
consecutive terms, Jones was a
member of the senate's new Poli
cy and Planning Board.
Jones said she expects the
board will bring important
issues up for senate discussion

in the coming year. The board ia
charged with examining the
University's current budget pro
cess and its planning for the
future.
A faculty member since 1978,
Jones conducts research on the
immune system and its implica
tions for understanding disease
susceptibility. She received her
doctorate from Johns Hopkins
University in 1974.
Along with Jones, next year's
Faculty Senate Steering Commit
tee will include Russell Berman,
Donald Brown, Anthony Siegman
and Robert Simoni. All were
elected by a majority of next
year's 55 senators.
