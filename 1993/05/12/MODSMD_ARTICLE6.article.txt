### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Former U.S. Senator Alan Cranston stressed
the need to reform the United Nations so it can
deal more effectively with world problems in a
speech last night in History Corner.
"The role of U.N. peace-keeping forces must
be evaluated," Cranston told the audience of 50.
"I don't think the U.N. can be relied on as an in
strument of world peace if it has to rely on the
United States."
The former California senator advocated
strengthening U.N. military forces so that they
could be used more effectively to apprehend in
dividuals who have violated international law.
Other suggestions included imposing a 0.1
percent levy on international financial transac
tions to give the United Nations more reliable
funding and overhauling the current one na
tion-one vote system of representation.
Cranston also recommended an expanded
role for the International Court of Justice in me
diating disputes over international treaties.
On the situation in Bosnia, Cranston said he
supports President Clinton's moves, but is not
sure what the next step should be.
"We could get into a terrible quagmire ... if
we aren't prudent," he added.
Cranston, who graduated from Stanford in
1936, touched on his accomplishments in the
Senate, particularly his work on nuclear arms
reduction.
"My number one goal has been and is work
ing against nuclear war," he said. "If we wipe
ourselves out, nothing else is going to matter." *
He also mentioned his friendship with — and
admiration of — former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev,
with whom he has met many
times to discuss arms control.
In paving the road to democra
cy in the former Soviet Union,
Gorbachev "quite possibly will be
looked back upon as the man of
the century for what he accom
plished," Cranston said.
Cranston is now chairman of
the San Francisco-based Gor
bachev Foundation, which serves
as a U.S. center for Gorbachev's
activities. He called the founda
tion's recent move into the Pre
sidio a "beautiful example" of
how military bases can be used for
peaceful purposes.
Cranston also discussed why
he first entered the political arena
after he "rmyored in track, really
in English" at Stanford.
One influence was the first
hand look at fascism he gained
while working in Italy and Ger
many as a newspaper reporter in
the late 19305.

When he came back to the
United States, he published a new
translation of Hitler's "Mein
Kampf," whose official English
version had been toned down.
Hitler's agents sued him for
copyright infringement and won.
"We had to stop selling the book,"
Cranston said.
Cranston began his political
career when he was elected Cali
fornia's state controller in 1958.
He was elected to the Senate in
1968 and served for 24 years.
When asked about the role of
special interests in a question and
answer session after his speech,
the veteran politician stressed the
need for reform "to reduce the
role of money in politics."
"The only effective reform is
public financing of campaigns,"
he added, noting that his last
campaign cost $15 million.
"It takes an enormous amount
of time to raise that much
money," Cranston said.
Mike Turek, a law student,
said he was impressed by
Cranston. "I'm skeptical about
politicians, but he seemed like a
nice guy. . .He made me a little
more trusting."
