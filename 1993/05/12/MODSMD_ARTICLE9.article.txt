Colonel wants ban to stay
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Marine
colonel told senators yesterday that if
the military ends its ban on openly gay
members he will tell his sons — especial
ly the one who is homosexual — not to
join the armed forces. He said he would
fear for his gay son's life.
Col. Fred Peck, familiar to many
Americans as the spokesman for U.S.
forces in Somalia, described his son,
Scott, as the military's ideal — a strap
ping, 6-foot-1, blond, blue-eyed senior at
the University of Maryland. But he is
gay, the colonel said.
The senators also heard strong testi
mony from Gulf War commander H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, who said lifting
the ban would deeply harm morale, leav
ing listless troops like the Iraqis "who sat

in the deserts of Kuwait" as the allies
rolled through.
Whaling plan irks Japan
KYOTO, Japan (AP) — Japan yester
day threatened to quit the International
Whaling Commission after the group's
technical panel approved a French plan to
create a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic.
Environmentalists called the vote a
moral victory, but acknowledged the
whale sanctuary plan almost certainly
lacked the votes needed for approval by
the full commission.
The creation of a sanctuary would end
Japan's research-whaling program,
which lets it catch about 300 minke
whales a year. Japan says there is no sci
entific basis for the sanctuary plan,
which has U.S. backing.
