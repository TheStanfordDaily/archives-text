## Temporary cease-fire: Croats, Muslims retreat 
### 
MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— Bosnian Croat and Muslim comman
ders signed a regional U.N.-backed
cease-fire yesterday to end fierce fighting
between the sometime allies.
Gen. Milivoj Petkovic of the Croats
and Bosnian army chief Gen. Sefer
Halilovic signed the truce in Medjugorje,
12 miles southwest of Mostar. It took
effect at 6 p.m. (12 p.m. EDT) yesterday.
The U.N. commander in Bosnia, Gen.
Philippe Morillon, also signed.
The truce, which reportedly calls for
the release of hundreds of detainees
reported held around Mostar, covers
western and southwestern Bosnia, and
Muslim-held pockets in central Bosnia.
It was not immediately clear how well
it was holding.
The crumbling alliance between Mus
lims and Croats against Bosnia's Serbs
has led to fierce fighting. Since Sunday,
Croats have pressed a street-by-street
offensive of Mostar.
Earlier in the day, much of the east
ern, Muslim-held section of the city was

ablaze as Croat troops battled to break a
Muslim foothold on the west bank of the
Neretva River. Croats want the river,
which divides Mostar, to become the
easternmost boundary of their lands.
Yesterday's truce provides for:
• Freedom of movement of all U.N.
forces, international relief groups and
journalists in Croat- and Muslim-held
areas around Mostar and for joint road
controls by civilian and U.N. police,
reported Veso Vegar, a Croat army com
mand spokesman in Mostar.
• One unit of the U.N. Spanish battal
ion was to be deployed in Mostar yester
day and a British battalion will keep con
trolling the Pozor, Jablanica and Gornji
Vakuf areas in central Bosnia, Croatian
TV reported.
• The agreement calls for Croat and
Muslim forces to withdraw to barracks
in Mostar and for all civilian detainees to
be freed by today, the TV said. Both sides
are to free military men later, and must
give lists of POWs to Red Cross repre
sentatives by noon today.
