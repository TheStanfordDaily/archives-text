# Clinton calls for deficit 'trust fund'
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Saying he
doesn't blame Americans for distrust
ing Washington, President Clinton
yesterday proposed putting all money
raised from new taxes and spending
cuts into a trust fund dedicated solely
to reducing the nation's huge budget
deficit.
"The time has come to prove that
when we say we're going to do some
thing with the people's money, we
actually do it,"the president said.
"After 12 years of rising deficits and
Americans' feeling deceived about the
issue, I don't blame the people of this
country for being distrustful about
what they hear from Washington
when it comes to bringing down this
deficit."
But many Republican leaders yes
terday voiced skepticism of the plan.
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
called Clinton's proposal "just a gim
mick."
"The American people don't care
where new taxes go. They don't want
them, period," he said.
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, added, "You can
put it in a bushel basket. You can put

it in a box, and the truth of the matter
is . . . nobody should be fooled" that
actual deficit reduction will take place.
Responding in kind, Clinton said
later, "I think it's not a gimmick. . . .
The real question is whether our
friends in the Republican Party are
going to be ready to reverse the huge
tax increases because that's the only
way to really bring the deficit down,"
he told an audience whose members
shouted agreement with his remarks.
Clinton, trying to build support for
his economic plan by tapping into the
deficit-reduction theme popular with
Ross Perot and his followers, bor
rowed the idea from proposals already
circulating in Congress.
The president spelled out his plan in
a speech at the Great Hall of the Coop
er Union for the Advancement of Sci
ence and Art, which was the forum for
speeches by Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses
S. Grant, Grover Cleveland, Theodore
Roosevelt and William Howard Taft
before they became president.
Clinton also was the guest of honor
Wednesday night at a political dinner
expected to raise $3 million for the
Democratic National Committee.
He said his proposal would require

Congress to "put every penny of new
taxes and the budget cuts proposed in
my budget into the trust fund so the
American people know that it has to go
to deficit reduction."
Practically speaking, the trust fund
wouldn't do much more than is
already required under Congress*
complicated system of "budget recon
ciliation," which requires spending
and taxes to fall within agreed-upon
limits.
It also would not reduce the deficit
any more than is already planned —
about $500 billion over five years.
However, supporters hope taxpay
ers will view the trust fund as a legal
ly binding contract that locks in deficit
reduction.
"This is a legal guarantee on what
the budget reconciliation is supposed
to do," said Gene Sperling, the presi
dent's deputy assistant for economic
policy. He said the message from
Americans is, "We don't mind the
tough medicine (of higher taxes and
spending cuts) if you guarantee that
every penny of it is going for deficit
reduction."
The proposal would have to be
approved by Congress.
