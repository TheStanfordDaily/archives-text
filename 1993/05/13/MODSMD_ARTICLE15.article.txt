# Rabin battling public dissatisfaction
## Cabinet shuffle reflects Israeli leader's fight for control 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — A cartoon in
an Israeli newspaper yesterday depict
ed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at
the helm of a ship, grappling with a
detached steering wheel.
Behind him, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef,
a spiritual leader of the ultra-religious
Shas party, wields the rudder.
The message: Rabin is losing con
trol over his fractious ruling coalition
only 10 months after taking office.
This week's Cabinet crisis precipi
tated by Shas comes as Rabin faces
growing public nervousness over
prospects of withdrawing from war
won land in exchange for a peace set
tlement with the Arabs.
A failure to show leadership within
the Cabinet could undermine public
confidence in his moves toward a ter
ritorial compromise with the Syrians
over the disputed Golan Heights.
Rabin's government is also negoti
ating the sensitive issue of the charac
ter of Palestinian autonomy in the
occupied lands, and he will need pub
lic backing for whatever deal his nego
tiators conclude with the Palestini
ans.

Shas said it could no longer live in a
government in which the influential
education portfolio was held by Shu
lamit Aloni, the leader of the liberal
Meretz party.
Finding it difficult to patch up the
feud between Shas and Meretz, Rabin
chose an unprecedented compromise
Tuesday of suspending for a week
Aloni and Aryeh Deri, the Shas leader
and Interior Minister.
A poll published yesterday in the
Maariv daily showed Rabin's Labor
party has lost 6 percentage points of
public support, dropping from 36 to
30, since unseating the right-wing
Likud party in national elections last
June.
Likud, meanwhile, has gained 4
percent and is now about even with
Labor, up from 27 percent in June to
31 percent now, the survey showed.
The poll of 1,000 Israelis by respected
pollster Hanoch Smith had a 3 per
cent margin of error.
The survey was taken before the
Cabinet crisis that erupted Sunday
over Deri's demand that Rabin fire
Aloni for her liberal views. But the

crisis certainly hasn't boosted public
confidence in Rabin.
This isn't the first time an Israeli
government has been held ransom by
a religious party, as most cabinets
have relied on these small factions to
stay in power.
But many have criticized Rabin,
who campaigned on a pledge for clean
er government, for failing to take a
clear stand on this conflict.
"His handling of the Shas-Meretz
crisis does not exactly stir admira
tion," wrote Amnon Dankner in the
Hadashot tabloid.
Deri resigned Sunday, alleging that
Aloni has repeatedly insulted Jewish
religious values. Aloni refused to step
down, explaining that the bickering
was really over a cultural chasm
between Israel's majority of nonob
servant Jews and the religious minor
ity.
Aloni offended religious Jews when
she was photographed gazing at a
plate of Arab bread in a restaurant
near the Arab town of Nazareth dur
ing the Passover holiday, when the
observant abjure leavened products.
