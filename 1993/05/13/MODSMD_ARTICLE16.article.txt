Clinton to forgive debt
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Pres
ident Clinton plans to forgive hun
dreds of millions of dollars in African
debt, a senior U.S. official said yester
day — a major departure from the
stand taken by Republican administra
tions.
Lawrence Summers, undersecretary
of state for international affairs, said
18 low-income African countries may
have half of their debts owed to the
U.S. government written off.
"It's a valuable first step," Summers
said in an interview. He didn't give any
time frame for such a move.
The Bush and Reagan administra
tions were strongly opposed to forgiv
ing debts.
Such debt relief, however, would
only make a small dent in the $255 bil
lion that Africa owes its donors.
U.S. debt relief is conditional on the
countries opening their economies to
the free market on lines approved by
the International Monetary Fund.
Africans blame the stringent reforms
imposed by the Western fund for

unprecedented poverty on the conti
nent.
Loan plan supported
WASHINGTON (AP) - A House
committee yesterday approved Presi
dent Clinton's proposal to replace the
existing college loan program with one
under which students borrow directly
from the government.
Proponents argue that direct lend
ing would reduce defaults, which cost
the government an estimated $3 billion
a year, because the Internal Revenue
Service would track down deadbeats.
Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., chair
man of the House Education and Labor
Committee, said the program would
"reduce the cost of getting an educa
tion for millions of young Americans."
But a coalition of lenders said it was
a "dangerous experiment" and "far too
risky to simply accept without more
thoughtful consideration."
The measure now goes to the House
Budget Committee, which will present
it to the full House as part of the fed
eral budget reconciliation package.
