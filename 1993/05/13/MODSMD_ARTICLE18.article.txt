## Editorial Segregating the vote

The ASSLPs attempt at
splitting special fees is a
contempt of the system

Rights and responsi
bilities are hand-in-hand
components of any democra
cy. But judging by recent attempts
to segregate the special-fee elec
tions process into graduate and
undergraduate voting pools, this
fact has long been forgotten by
some in the ASSU.
Last week, the ASSU Senate
unanimously approved an amend
ment that would essentially allow
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents to decide separately whether
to fund special fee requests. The
amendment will be placed on next
spring's general election ballot. If
approved by voters, the electorate
will be divided in future elections,
with undergraduate- and graduate
student votes for special fees tabu
lated separately.
"Graduate students are both
taxed for programs that do not
affect them and penalized for not
voting on those two obscure days in
April," graduate senator-elect Neil
Crellin has argued. Graduate sena
tor Jerry Yang later concurred, say
ing, "Ninety percent of graduate
students don't know what these
special fees groups do. They feel
that they shouldn't have to pay for
groups that do not affect them."
Perhaps Crellin, Yang and oth
ers like them who support this
amendment have forgotten that on
the first Tuesday of each Novem
ber — however obscure that day
may appear — the American public
has the opportunity to vote, both
for representatives in government
as well as certain laws, ordi
nances,and yes, even taxes.
Moreover, most taxes are
assessed on a larger group — i.e. all
taxpayers — for the benefit of a sig
nificantly smaller subsection of the
populace. For instance, school
levies, it could be argued, benefit

only school children. Other taxes
pay for roads only certain people
use, services upon which only cer
tain people depend, and (gasp!)
activities in which only certain peo
ple participate.
People who do not vote in these
elections — for whatever reason,
be the day too obscure or the trip to
the voting booth too much of a
bother — still pay the taxes decided
upon by the general electorate. And
even people who voted in the elec
tion, but who voted against a tax
which will not directly benefit
them in any way, pay the taxes.
In the ASSU, the system is more
lenient: thanks to an amendment
approved by the electorate this
year, any student, whether he or
she voted or didn't, can get a fee
request refund.
Why, then, is it necessary to fur
ther dissolve the power of the elec
torate and segregate graduate-stu
dent approval from undergraduate
approval? Students who care
enough to get their fee-request
money back simply fill out a form.
Thus, minimal initiative is reward
ed. Under the proposed system,
students will be only further
awarded for apathy.
Graduate senators say the move
will encourage groups to "reach
out" to graduate students next
year, but the net result of these
shenanigans is that student groups
will be unnecessarily impacted,
simply for the convenience of a
handful of self-interested people.
The fact is, there are an equal
number of graduate and under
graduate students. If grads — or
undergrads — don't want a tax, the
simplest solution is to vote as part
of the electorate.
If graduate students are the
way-too-busy-to-vote, don't-care
anyway-this has-nothing-to-do
with-me adults they claim to be,
certainly they understand the con
cept of democratic decision mak
ing. If not, now's a perfect time to
learn the system.
That's the way this country
works, so everyone better get used
to it.
