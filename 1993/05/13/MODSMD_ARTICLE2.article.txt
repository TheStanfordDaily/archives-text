# Finding the truth in history
## Conquest delivers prestigious humanities lecture 
### Vivien Wang 
To find the truth, a historian must be more of a
detective than a scientist, Hoover Institution Se
nior Fellow Robert Conquest said last night.
Conquest, a renowned historian, delivered the
1993 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, one of
the highest national honors awarded for study in
the humanities. Conquest first delivered his speech
— entitled "History, Humanity and the Truth" —
on May 5 in Washington, D.C.
"Historical verification requires attention to de
tail, common sense reasoning, familiarity with
human nature and judgment," like detective work,
he told an almost-packed Kresge Auditorium audi
ence. "It is not a mechanical act," like science, he
added.
By its very nature, Conquest declared, history is
not scientific. "The mere fact that we still differen
tiate between humanities and sciences demon

strates that these are different areas of thought,"
he said.
Conquest also tried to break down the popular
notion that a good historian must be objective.
"Historians write from different points of view," he
said.
"Accuracy and good faith" are more important
than merely concealing personal opinions to main
tain apparent objectivity, according to Conquest. Of
course, reasonable objectivity is not beyond grasp,
he said, but in history the "accidental and unpre
dictable is totally decisive."
Conquest also warned that many people alive
today are ignorant of their history.
"Our feeling for the past is weaker and vaguer
than it ought to be," he said. Conquest singled out
flaws in the educational system as one reason for
people's historical ignorance.
