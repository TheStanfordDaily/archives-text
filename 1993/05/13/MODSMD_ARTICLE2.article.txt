# Finding the truth in history
## Conquest delivers prestigious humanities lecture 
### Vivien Wang 
To find the truth, a historian must be more of a
detective than a scientist, Hoover Institution Se
nior Fellow Robert Conquest said last night.
Conquest, a renowned historian, delivered the
1993 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, one of
the highest national honors awarded for study in
the humanities. Conquest first delivered his speech
— entitled "History, Humanity and the Truth" —
on May 5 in Washington, D.C.
"Historical verification requires attention to de
tail, common sense reasoning, familiarity with
human nature and judgment," like detective work,
he told an almost-packed Kresge Auditorium audi
ence. "It is not a mechanical act," like science, he
added.
By its very nature, Conquest declared, history is
not scientific. "The mere fact that we still differen
tiate between humanities and sciences demon

strates that these are different areas of thought,"
he said.
Conquest also tried to break down the popular
notion that a good historian must be objective.
"Historians write from different points of view," he
said.
"Accuracy and good faith" are more important
than merely concealing personal opinions to main
tain apparent objectivity, according to Conquest. Of
course, reasonable objectivity is not beyond grasp,
he said, but in history the "accidental and unpre
dictable is totally decisive."
Conquest also warned that many people alive
today are ignorant of their history.
"Our feeling for the past is weaker and vaguer
than it ought to be," he said. Conquest singled out
flaws in the educational system as one reason for
people's historical ignorance.
A lack of knowledge about his
tory can blur the line between
true and false, Conquest cau
tioned.
For example, people have lost
interest in the Soviet past
because of a iong experience with
false historical theory, he said.
Because of this, "history became
fantasy," and the disjunction
between truth and reality grew
stronger.
Gaps therefore had to be
filled solely by foreign writers.
But Western delusions of the
former Soviet Union persisted,
Conquest said, so, "The coun
try appeared as a home of
mythical beasts," like the
socialist organization and the
worker's party.
Nevertheless, he said, seri
ous political research on the
Soviet Union has helped to
bring about such developments
as glasnost.
Conquest himself epitomizes
the ultimate political researcher
of the Soviet Union with his 15

painstakingly researched books
on Soviet history and politics.
They include "The Great Terror:
A Reassessment" and"The Har
vest of Sorrow: Soviet Collec
tivization and the Terror
Famine," underground editions
of which were published, read
and widely praised in the former
Soviet Union.
Conquest has been the cura
tor of Hoover's Russian collec
tion since 1981. His life's work
has been, in the words of Hoover
Director John Raisian "to tell the
truth about the Soviet regime . . .
and to pose his Anglo-American
values against the horrors of
communism."
Although Conquest has devot
ed years to caring for Russian
documents, the papers them
selves "give only part of the pic
ture. [They don't] describe the
circumstances of their composi
tion," he said.
The Jefferson Lecture in the
Humanities is selected by the
National Council on the Human
ities, and appointment is consid
ered the nation's highest official
award for intellectual achieve
ment in the humanities.
