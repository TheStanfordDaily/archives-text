## A
						fear of the unknown? 
### 
I RECENTLY SPOKE to Corey Glover,
lead singer of the rock group Living
Colour, and I thought I would share
one of his thoughts about the state of
America.
A good friend of mine had asked him
how he and the group have been able to
reconcile the success factor with a still
less-than-receptive, racist America. He
then went on to tell us a grim story of
how earlier in the day he couldn't get a
cab to get to the Haight. He said every
cab driver turned on the "on-call" light
and drove right by when they saw him
raise his hand to signal the cab.
I was thinking to myself, "Here is a
guy who is in one of the most successful
groups in music today and has won
Grammys, International Rock Awards,
American Music Awards and numerous
MTV Video Music Awards and he
couldn't get a cab in the middle of the
day in San Francisco!?!" All I could
think of is Malcolm X's biting, but
painful critique â€” What is a black per
son with a Ph.D. in America? A nigger.
In the eyes of the mainstream, no
matter how embarrassed they are to
admit it, there is an inherent fear of
black people.
Where does this fear come from? How
have blacks come to embody the walking
personification of the negative? And to
bring the question closer to home, what
are we doing in the educational system
to socialize a perception of reality that

legitimizes this fear?
Being black in America has always
been a half-and-half contract. You are
an American, because you were born
here and have no where else to go, but
you are not fully an American, because
you are never fully accepted as one. This
is a reality that non-black opponents
consistently criticize, although it is a
reality they have never experienced and
consequently couldn't begin to under
stand.
People always tell me "Kwame, it is a
fact that more blacks commit crimes and
do drugs more than anyone else. People
are not beings racists, it's just that if
blacks didn't do such bad things, people
would accept them and not be judgmen
tal." Unfortunately, this just isn't true.
What is a fact is that blacks and Latinos
are sent to jail more frequently, and for
longer sentences, than whites who com
mit the same crimes. It is a fact that
more whites are in jail than blacks, and
it is a fact that more white adolescents
use drugs than black adolescents.
Be that as it may, why is it that
Corey, me, or any black person is per
ceived by the mainstream as a threat or
someone to be feared? Hell, I'd be more
afraid of the inside traders on Wall
Street, the masterminds behind the S &
L scandal, and the outright thiefs in that
Housing and Urban Development mess
that collectively robbed "the tax-paying
American public" of tens of billions of

dollars, than a young brother walking
down the street with baggy jeans and an
"X" Cap.
Too often, we get wrapped up in intel
lectual analyses and political debates
about race, but rarely do people talk about
it in a candid and open way. Take a minute
for personal reflection. Get some people
together in your dorm and bounce ideas
off one another. Put down your statistics,
political party membership cards and eco
nomic theories and just think. How do you
feel about all of this? Where did you learn
your own perceptions of reality? Is your
education fostering or deconstructing
your previously held beliefs about these
issues and "-isms"?
To deal with any of the problems our
generation faces in the future, we have
stop running away and living in denial.
Facing reality means asking difficult
questions and changing conventional
modes of thinking, since it is these
modes that have led us to racism, sex
ism, homophobia, global poverty and the
destruction of the environment, while
basking in the sun here in the Garden of
Eden.
