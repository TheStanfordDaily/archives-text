Changes to the distribution requirement system are needed

IN RESPONSE TO THE editorial on
the distribution-requirement system,
I think there are a lot of things
"broke" here that need some fixin'. I do
agree with the central ideology of the
current system as a means of adding
breadth to one's college curriculum, but
there are some serious problems in the
current system which must be addressed
in order for distribution requirements to
reasonably serve their purpose.
There is much disparity and inconsis
tency, particularly among different disci
plines. As a mechanical engineer, it has
been my experience that technical
mEyors benefit from this breadth
requirement, balancing out the heavy
problem-set load with a literature or his
tory class (and relishing in the novelty of
a FIVE-unit class). Sometimes extra
classes are a necessity, as three hard
core engineering classes in a given quar
ter account for only nine units, and 12

are required.
Despite the heavy class load and rigid
class schedules, however, there is little
flexibility to fit an appropriate class into
one's schedule or be allotted a substitu
tion. Such efforts are further hampered
by the unavailability of some classes.
Consider the non-western requirement
(under the "old" DR system): of the 56
classes listed with an asterisk in "Cours
es and Degrees," 27 of them are not
offered this year. With additional restric
tions on those remaining (i.e. foreign
language requirements or other course
prerequisites), it can be quite a challenge
to find a class to fit your schedule . . . yet
the University seems quite inflexible to
possible deviations from its divine plan.
Non-technical majors, on the other
hand, seem to be losing out on the
breadth. Certainly, they may expand
their liberal-arts courses over many dis
ciplines, but the allowed science and

technical electives are so inadequate and
glossed over it is difficult to see this as a
fully rounded education. For instance,
Psychology 60 (yes, a Psychology course)
can fulfill the math requirement. I do
not think it is unreasonable to require
students to take at least one real physics
(not for poets) or calculus course, and
some equivalent liberal-arts course on
the other side as well. (I cannot speak
for what problems may exist within lib
eral-arts majors, but I am sure there are
similar disparities that bear attention).
I have enjoyed the Russian literature
or philosophy courses intermingled with
physics and fluid dynamics, and indeed
think that distribution requirements can
provide a unique opportunity to expand
one's education. But when, more often
than not, students take a class pass/no
credit, do the minimum work to get that
C-plus, and get nothing out of a class but
spite for having taken it, what is the

point? It defeats the purpose of distribu
tion requirements if classes are avoided
and glossed over.
The thought of remodeling the distri
bution-requirement system again is not
pleasant, but the inconsistencies in its
current state need to be mended. In
part, I think the system needs some
strict guidelines for a small core of class
es to bridge the disparity between liberal
arts and technical disciplines, so that
both get a bit of the other (not just a lit
tle taste, but a whole mouthful). The
remaining cross-section needs a bit more
flexibility, however, so that students will
take classes they want to take and will
actually get something out of them.
Finally, whatever the requirement might
be, there had better be reasonable avail
ability if the University expects you to
fulfill it.
