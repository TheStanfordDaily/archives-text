# CS 105A is not the joke class John Ford made it out to be in his column
## 
### 
In the April 20 issue of The Daily,
John Ford's column, "The sad plight
of the frosh," made a number of high
ly critical comments about one of my
department's courses, Computer Sci
ence 105 A. In the editorial, Ford
called the class "oddly reminiscent of
high school in its quality of teaching
and student interest," and implies
that most of the course is just busy
work for those people who want to
meet a distribution requirement.
Unfortunately, Ford's views of the
course are distorted and far from the
truth.
CS 105 A is one of the department's
most important courses, since for
many students it may be their only

formal computer course in college.
The current instructor of the course,
Julie Zelenski, therefore makes a spe
cial effort to make sure that the class
is not only well taught and interest
ing, but also teaches students what
they need to know in an increasingly
computerized world. Her efforts have
paid off, as students have consistently
praised the course and her teaching in
evaluations.
It is true that CS 105 A is not the
most technically rigorous course, but
that is not its intent. The true test of
how "good" any introductory course
like CS 105 A is whether or not it can
convey to students what is important
about its subject matter, and why they
should care about it. By this test, CS
105 A has succeeded admirably. Ford's
mean-spirited attack on the course
does nothing but discourage people
from exploring our computer-science
curriculum and mock the efforts of
those who work hard to ensure hat

our courses are of high quality.
