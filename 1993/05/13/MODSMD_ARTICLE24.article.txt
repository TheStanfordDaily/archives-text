# Playboy recruit puts every Stanford woman at risk of harassment
## 
### 
I am writing this letter because I
want to bring to the attention of the
Stanford community the absurdity of
inviting Playboy to exploit Stanford
women. Certainly there will be women
from Stanford who wish to be models,
and I am not condemning them.
But for those of us who choose not
to engage in these activities, we suffer
additional harassment as a result of
the Playboy recruit. Eating lunch with
several of my coworkers who happen
to be male, I was suddenly singled out
as they suggested poses I should use

to try to get into the Pac-10 spread.
These men know I would do no
such thing, and they are generally
well-meaning. However, they see
nothing wrong with suggesting they
would like to see me naked. I have
spent many years fighting for a voice
that would be taken seriously, only to
be objectified over lunch and remind
ed that often women are valued only
for their sexuality. It wasn't so long
ago that women who worked for Old
Milwaukee Brewing Co. sued based on
additional harassment they received
as a result of the company's commer
cials that included the Swedish bikini
team.
How many women have to be
harassed how many times before Stan
ford will sit up and take notice? I
encourage others who have been
affected by this recruit, either posi
tively or negatively, to write in.
