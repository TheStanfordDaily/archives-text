## Poruri carries Cardinal torch for tennis' title run 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Far removed from the computerized
rankings and the big name tourna
ments of women's collegiate tennis,
there still exists a small but dedicated
group of players who step onto the court
day in and day out for nothing more
than the pure rush of competition.
Laxmi Poruri might be their
spokesperson.
"I like it when we go into a match
and the odds are against us," she said.
"That's what competition is all about —
that's when character comes in."
Character has been Poruri's trade
mark at Stanford. A two-time All-Amer
ican, she racked up a combined 47-5
dual match record during her freshman
and sophomore years, including a Nor-
Cal Rolex Singles title. This season,
Poruri went 16-3, even though a sore
elbow — an injury similar to Joe Mon
tana's —■ sidelined her for the season's
last two matches.
Poruri, a junior from Claremont,
Calif., was named the Cardinal's top
singles player at the beginning of this
season and has occupied the No. 1 spot
ever since. That might have been a dif
ficult move for Poruri, who replaced
doubles partner and best friend
Heather Willens at the top position, but
Poruri said that their friendship was
the key to a smooth transition for both
veterans.
"It's exhausting [at No. I], but chal
lenging," Poruri said. "Heather and I
were always so close in ability — even if
she played No. 1 I'd feel confident that
she would win.
"We're like best friends on the court
— we give each other a little boost. Both
of us encourage each other in the pres
sure matches, since our courts are usu
ally right next to each other."
Poruri got her start in tennis at the
age of six and played in numerous
junior tournaments, including the
Junior Nationals, where she first played
at age 11 and then every year until col
lege. It was on a trip to a national junior
tournament in Mountain View that she
saw the Stanford campus for the first
time.
"It was funny — our family was
always in awe of Stanford more aca
demically than athletically," Poruri
said. "When we visited here, my dad
thought they wouldn't let us in the
gates."
But in the end, Poruri would do more
than get in the gates. With a national
junior singles championship and wins
over Aranxta Sanchez and Monica Seles
in her pocket, Poruri was the nation's
top recruit as a senior in high school.
But even with that list of accomplish
ments behind her, Poruri had her share
of struggles when she finally arrived at
Stanford.

"By that time, I kind of reached a
burnout stage," Poruri admitted. "I
almost quit — as it was, I took two
months off of tennis to figure out
whether I wanted to play any more. I
was generally worried about life. It was
a tough time."
Poruri emerged from that struggle
stronger for the wear, playing No. 5 sin
gles on the 1991 NCAA Championship
team. She played as high as No. 2 that
year, and captured All-America doubles
honors behind an 11-1 doubles match
record with teammate Teri Whitlinger.
She and Whitlinger missed the NCAA
doubles title by a scant two matches.
Still, Poruri wasn't satisfied.
"At the beginning I played terrible,"
Poruri said. "I really did poorly that
year — in terms of my experience, I was
disappointed."
The summer of 1991 was a rebuild
ing time for Poruri, as she attempted to
put everything — tennis, school and her
life — in perspective.
"That summer I worked my ass off,"
she said. "I did a lot of thinking about
life, and when I came back something
clicked — suddenly I was a threat. Then
I knew I was ready to take it on again."
Poruri returned for her sophomore
year on fire. Ranked No. 62 in presea
son polls, she quickly vaulted up the
rankings after winning the Rolex Sin
gles Championship over Willens in the
winter of 1992. Poruri played No. 2 sin
gles behind Willens, turning in a siz
zling 23-2 dual match record and gar
nering All-American honors for the sec
ond year in a row, this time in singles
and doubles. In the 1992 NCAA Tour
nament, Poruri reached the semifinals
of the singles competition before falling
to the nation's No. 1 player, Shannan
McCarthy of Georgia. By the end of the
season, she was arguably the second
best player in the nation.
But all of those accomplishments
were obscured for Poruri when Stan
ford lost in the NCAA semifinals to
Texas, ending a 53-match winning
streak at home and a six-year lock on
the NCAA title. But despite the disap
pointment, Poruri noted that the team
learned a lesson from the loss.
"We didn't play confident tennis
against Texas — that day, we just didn't
have it," Poruri said. "Taking teams too
lightly is something we will not do this
year."
What the Cardinal has done this
year, however, is make it clear to the
rest of the NCAA field that they are
back, and if Poruri has anything to say
about it, they're going to be the team to
beat.
"This team is a lot more confident
than last year's," Poruri said. "We're
excited, but we're not anxious and tight.
We're ready to fight our hearts out.
"There's a great team spirit and
ambiance around Stanford," she said.

"The feeling is, 'We are Stanford,' and
there's high expectations if you play for
Stanford. A lot of it is pride."
Poruri has made that pride obvious
in her play. At No. 1 this year, she has
lost only three matches, including two
to Lisa Raymond of Florida, the
nation's No. 1 collegiate player who is
ranked in the top 100 in the world. Still,
Poruri is considered the country's No. 2
collegiate player, a position where she's
very comfortable indeed.
"I think I've proved I belong there,"
Poruri said. "The losses are more men
tal absences than anything else."
So will the third time be a charm for
Poruri against Raymond?
"With her, it's like the pro tour —
it's all mental," Poruri said. "If you get
a break point you better get that damn
point because it's not coming again.
"There are no weaknesses with Lisa
— none," Poruri said. "I just have to get
out there, force the points, and project
an image that I'm in total control."
This year has been, without ques
tion, Poruri's most successful, but a
nagging elbow injury threatened to
change all that. Tendonitis has plagued
Poruri for most of the season and
according to coach Frank Brennan,
she's frequently plays through the pain.
To be on the safe side, Brennan kept
Poruri home while the team finished its
regular season in Los Angeles April 16
and 17. The time off from competition
allowed Poruri to rest the elbow and
focus solely on preparing for NCAAs.
"I've been working on leg strength
and footwork, which is very important
whenever you play in Florida," Poruri
said. "I've also been working on improv
ing my intensity — when I have it, I
play real good tennis and slow it down.
"Strategy is also going to be key," she
continued. "I used to play real well on a
few points, then go into outer space and
give up three or four. Now I'm better at
calming myself and considering point by
point."
As for life after college, Poruri hopes
to take her game to the next level on the
professional circuit, but according to
this Modern Thought and Literature
major, tennis will not always dominate
her life.
"I want to give myself a chance as a
pro — I don't want to be 30 and look
back wishing I had given it a try,"
Poruri said. "But there's so many other
interests for me, too — I want to be a
professor in literature someday, and
that'll be a lot of fun for me."
Now, however, the task at hand for
Poruri is getting the job done in the
NCAA Tournament in Gainesville,
Florida.
"On any given day someone can beat
you — there's always a lot of snakes in
the grass," she said. "I have to go in
with the attitude that I'm going to win,
no matter what."

Laxmi Poruri has been a hit on campus since her freshman year. Now a junior, she

have it," Poruri said. "Taking teams too
lightly is something we will not do this
year."
What the Cardinal has done this
year, however, is make it clear to the
rest of the NCAA field that they are
back, and if Poruri has anything to say
about it, they're going to be the team to
beat.
"This team is a lot more confident
than last year's," Poruri said. "We're
excited, but we're not anxious and tight.
We're ready to fight our hearts out.
"There's a great team spirit and
ambiance around Stanford," she said.

"The feeling is, 'We are Stanford,' and
there's high expectations if you play for
Stanford. A lot of it is pride."
Poruri has made that pride obvious
in her play. At No. 1 this year, she has
lost only three matches, including two
to Lisa Raymond of Florida, the
nation's No. 1 collegiate player who is
ranked in the top 100 in the world. Still,
Poruri is considered the country's No. 2
collegiate player, a position where she's
very comfortable indeed.
"I think I've proved I belong there,"
Poruri said. "The losses are more men
tal absences than anything else."
So will the third time be a charm for
Poruri against Raymond?
"With her, it's like the pro tour —
it's all mental," Poruri said. "If you get
a break point you better get that damn
point because it's not coming again.
"There are no weaknesses with Lisa
— none," Poruri said. "I just have to get
out there, force the points, and project
an image that I'm in total control."
This year has been, without ques
tion, Poruri's most successful, but a
nagging elbow injury threatened to
change all that. Tendonitis has plagued
Poruri for most of the season and
according to coach Frank Brennan,
she's frequently plays through the pain.
To be on the safe side, Brennan kept
Poruri home while the team finished its
regular season in Los Angeles April 16
and 17. The time off from competition
allowed Poruri to rest the elbow and
focus solely on preparing for NCAAs.
"I've been working on leg strength
and footwork, which is very important
whenever you play in Florida," Poruri
said. "I've also been working on improv
ing my intensity — when I have it, I
play real good tennis and slow it down.
"Strategy is also going to be key," she
continued. "I used to play real well on a
few points, then go into outer space and
give up three or four. Now I'm better at
calming myself and considering point by
point."
As for life after college, Poruri hopes
to take her game to the next level on the
professional circuit, but according to
this Modern Thought and Literature
major, tennis will not always dominate
her life.
"I want to give myself a chance as a
pro — I don't want to be 30 and look
back wishing I had given it a try,"
Poruri said. "But there's so many other
interests for me, too — I want to be a
professor in literature someday, and
that'll be a lot of fun for me."
Now, however, the task at hand for
Poruri is getting the job done in the
NCAA Tournament in Gainesville,
Florida.
"On any given day someone can beat
you — there's always a lot of snakes in
the grass," she said. "I have to go in
with the attitude that I'm going to win,
no matter what."

Laxmi Poruri has been a hit on campus since her freshman year. Now a junior, she
hopes to lead the Cardinal to its sixth NCAA championship in seven years this weekend.
Far removed from the computerized
rankings and the big name tourna
ments of women's collegiate tennis,
there still exists a small but dedicated
group of players who step onto the court
day in and day out for nothing more
than the pure rush of competition.
Laxmi Poruri might be their
spokesperson.
"I like it when we go into a match
and the odds are against us," she said.
"That's what competition is all about —
that's when character comes in."
Character has been Poruri's trade
mark at Stanford. A two-time All-Amer
ican, she racked up a combined 47-5
dual match record during her freshman
and sophomore years, including a Nor-
Cal Rolex Singles title. This season,
Poruri went 16-3, even though a sore
elbow — an injury similar to Joe Mon
tana's —■ sidelined her for the season's
last two matches.
Poruri, a junior from Claremont,
Calif., was named the Cardinal's top
singles player at the beginning of this
season and has occupied the No. 1 spot
ever since. That might have been a dif
ficult move for Poruri, who replaced
doubles partner and best friend
Heather Willens at the top position, but
Poruri said that their friendship was
the key to a smooth transition for both
veterans.
"It's exhausting [at No. I], but chal
lenging," Poruri said. "Heather and I
were always so close in ability — even if
she played No. 1 I'd feel confident that
she would win.
"We're like best friends on the court
— we give each other a little boost. Both
of us encourage each other in the pres
sure matches, since our courts are usu
ally right next to each other."
Poruri got her start in tennis at the
age of six and played in numerous
junior tournaments, including the
Junior Nationals, where she first played
at age 11 and then every year until col
lege. It was on a trip to a national junior
tournament in Mountain View that she
saw the Stanford campus for the first
time.
"It was funny — our family was
always in awe of Stanford more aca
demically than athletically," Poruri
said. "When we visited here, my dad
thought they wouldn't let us in the
gates."
But in the end, Poruri would do more
than get in the gates. With a national
junior singles championship and wins
over Aranxta Sanchez and Monica Seles
in her pocket, Poruri was the nation's
top recruit as a senior in high school.
But even with that list of accomplish
ments behind her, Poruri had her share
of struggles when she finally arrived at
Stanford.

"By that time, I kind of reached a
burnout stage," Poruri admitted. "I
almost quit — as it was, I took two
months off of tennis to figure out
whether I wanted to play any more. I
was generally worried about life. It was
a tough time."
Poruri emerged from that struggle
stronger for the wear, playing No. 5 sin
gles on the 1991 NCAA Championship
team. She played as high as No. 2 that
year, and captured All-America doubles
honors behind an 11-1 doubles match
record with teammate Teri Whitlinger.
She and Whitlinger missed the NCAA
doubles title by a scant two matches.
Still, Poruri wasn't satisfied.
"At the beginning I played terrible,"
Poruri said. "I really did poorly that
year — in terms of my experience, I was
disappointed."
The summer of 1991 was a rebuild
ing time for Poruri, as she attempted to
put everything — tennis, school and her
life — in perspective.
"That summer I worked my ass off,"
she said. "I did a lot of thinking about
life, and when I came back something
clicked — suddenly I was a threat. Then
I knew I was ready to take it on again."
Poruri returned for her sophomore
year on fire. Ranked No. 62 in presea
son polls, she quickly vaulted up the
rankings after winning the Rolex Sin
gles Championship over Willens in the
winter of 1992. Poruri played No. 2 sin
gles behind Willens, turning in a siz
zling 23-2 dual match record and gar
nering All-American honors for the sec
ond year in a row, this time in singles
and doubles. In the 1992 NCAA Tour
nament, Poruri reached the semifinals
of the singles competition before falling
to the nation's No. 1 player, Shannan
McCarthy of Georgia. By the end of the
season, she was arguably the second
best player in the nation.
But all of those accomplishments
were obscured for Poruri when Stan
ford lost in the NCAA semifinals to
Texas, ending a 53-match winning
streak at home and a six-year lock on
the NCAA title. But despite the disap
pointment, Poruri noted that the team
learned a lesson from the loss.
"We didn't play confident tennis
against Texas — that day, we just didn't
have it," Poruri said. "Taking teams too
lightly is something we will not do this
year."
