# And the winner is... 'Spike' Awards honor best, worst

### 
YES, HERE WE ARE, winding down
another sports year just chock full o'
the most exciting stories you've ever
heard. In fact, 1992-93 will surely go down
in history as one of the most exciting
hyphenated years in all of sports.
But Mike, you ask, how can we sort out
ALL these oh-so-exciting sporting events
so that we can return to them at a later
date for convenient reference? Xerox every
USA Today sports graph, in color, on what
percentage of student-athletes score more
than triple-digits on the SAT? Call that 1-
900, $4.95-a-minute New York Times
number with up-to-date sports scores and
clues to the crossword puzzle? E-mail Tish
Williams and ask her?
Get real.
You need an authority, which is why I
proudly present to you . . .
THE 1993 MIKE "THE SPIKE"
Mcdonough annual sports
AWARDS
(As if you didn't kind of know this was
coming.)
•The Irrelevant Series Award — To

Stanford and Cal, in their gripping life-and
death struggle last weekend for last place
in the Six-Pac. Even the Band got up and
left.

•The Most-Innovative-Use-for-Jello-
Pudding Award — To Cal football fans,
who graciously shared their picnic lunch
desserts with Stanford fans after their
Weenies were pummeled in the Big Game.
Once again, Cal's crack field security unit
comes through.
•The Golden Spike Award — To Wendy
Hromadka, who made the kill of her life in
Albuquerque, N.M. and drove the final nail
in UCLA's coffin, winning Stanford its

first-ever national volleyball title.
•The Joe Montana Underappreciation
Award — A tie, between Stanford's swim
ming teams and tennis teams, who bring
home NCAA title after NCAA title, com
prise the most dominant dynasties in all of
collegiate sports and get much less atten
tion and fan support than basketball or
football, which usually don't even get close
enough to smell a national title. Even on a
windy day.
•The Dallas Mavericks Silver Head
(Beating Against a Wall) Award — To Stan
ford men's basketball, for trying, and try
ing, and trying and ensuring that Stan
ford's losingest basketball team in history
still beat USC.
•The Stroke, Stroke, Stroke Award —
To men's and women's crew, for devoting
blood, sweat, toil, tears and valuable home
work time to being "6'3" or tough enough
to make the difference" and giving Cal good
competition every year before losing.
•The Most Inspirational "D" Award —
To women's basketball forward Chris Mac-
Murdo, who demonstrated that good

defense is 1% natural ability and 99% old
fashioned hard-work. A class act, Mac, to
the end.
•The Pepto-Bismol Upset Award — To
women's tennis player Amy Chiminello,
who pulled off three upsets in a row at the
Pac-10 Championships, including one of
the nation's No. 7 player. Steffi Graf is
next.
•The We-May-Not-Be-The-U.S.-Volley
ball-Team-But-We-Look-Like-Them
Award — To the Stanford men's volleyball
team, for shaving their heads and wreaking
havoc on opponents, only to fall short of
the Final Four. Next hairstyle: the Hare
Krishna ponytail look.
•The It's-About-Time Golden Stop
watch Award — To the NCAA, for finally
expanding women's sports championships
to look more like men's. That one goes with
•The Women-Are-Finally-On-Top
Award — To Stanford's women's basket
ball team, for outdrawing the men at


Mike
McDonough
Maples Pavilion this season.
Showtime vs. Slowtime — you
make the call.
•The Pro-Choice Award — To
John Lynch, whose pro choice
was the right one. I'd rather
watch Lynch lay bone-crushing
hits on opposing quarterbacks
than stand on a mound and hurl
all day. Baseballs, that is.
•The Kids-Are-Alright Award
— To freshmen hoops players
Dion Cross and Darren Allaway,
who picked up an ailing Stanford
team and made up two-fifths of
the starting lineup this year.
Nowhere to go but up for these
guys.
•The Lords-of-the-Rings (and
Other Apparati) Award — To Jair
Lynch and the Stanford men's
gymnastics team, which picked
up Stanford's second NCAA title
in Albuquerque this year. Stan
ford should play all its sports at
the Pit.
•The Less-is-More Award — A
tie between J.J. Lasley and Jenny
Thompson, for baring it all
(almost) for Daily photographers.
Honorable mention goes to Steve
Bait, who proved nudity in
academia can also be beautiful,
and that there's more than one
use for that Courses and Degrees
book.

Thanks to all of you that par
ticipated — I know not everyone
was represented in this illustri
ous/infamous group, but to you
athletes who were left out, I say
to you: keep on striving, fight
ing, battling and trucking, for
one day you too may join the
ranks of the elite, or at least be
able to spot them on the weight
bench one day. I know it's a
dream of mine.

Mike McDonough is a three-time
recipient of the Heisman, as well
as the Roger Clemens IM Soft
ball Award for pitching a no-hit
ter for the Daily softball team
and still losing 9-8 on 23 errors.
He plans to take John Lynch's
place pitching for the Florida
Marlins.
