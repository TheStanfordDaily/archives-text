### 
YES, HERE WE ARE, winding down
another sports year just chock full o'
the most exciting stories you've ever
heard. In fact, 1992-93 will surely go down
in history as one of the most exciting
hyphenated years in all of sports.
But Mike, you ask, how can we sort out
ALL these oh-so-exciting sporting events
so that we can return to them at a later
date for convenient reference? Xerox every
USA Today sports graph, in color, on what
percentage of student-athletes score more
than triple-digits on the SAT? Call that 1-
900, $4.95-a-minute New York Times
number with up-to-date sports scores and
clues to the crossword puzzle? E-mail Tish
Williams and ask her?
Get real.
You need an authority, which is why I
proudly present to you . . .

AWARDS
(As if you didn't kind of know this was
coming.)
•The Irrelevant Series Award — To

Stanford and Cal, in their gripping life-and
death struggle last weekend for last place
in the Six-Pac. Even the Band got up and
left.

•The Most-Innovative-Use-for-Jello-
Pudding Award — To Cal football fans,
who graciously shared their picnic lunch
desserts with Stanford fans after their
Weenies were pummeled in the Big Game.

in UCLA's coffin, winning Stanford its

first-ever national volleyball title.
•The Joe Montana Underappreciation
Award — A tie, between Stanford's swim
ming teams and tennis teams, who bring
home NCAA title after NCAA title, com
prise the most dominant dynasties in all of
collegiate sports and get much less atten
tion and fan support than basketball or
football, which usually don't even get close
enough to smell a national title. Even on a
windy day.

ford men's basketball, for trying, and try
ing, and trying and ensuring that Stan
ford's losingest basketball team in history

competition every year before losing.
•The Most Inspirational "D" Award —
To women's basketball forward Chris Mac-
Murdo, who demonstrated that good

defense is 1% natural ability and 99% old
fashioned hard-work. A class act, Mac, to
the end.
•The Pepto-Bismol Upset Award — To
women's tennis player Amy Chiminello,
who pulled off three upsets in a row at the
Pac-10 Championships, including one of
the nation's No. 7 player. Steffi Graf is
next.

ball-Team-But-We-Look-Like-Them
Award — To the Stanford men's volleyball
team, for shaving their heads and wreaking

expanding women's sports championships
to look more like men's. That one goes with
•The Women-Are-Finally-On-Top

ball team, for outdrawing the men at
