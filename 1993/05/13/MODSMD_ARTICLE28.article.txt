They've waited all season, and now they
have their chance.
The Stanford women's golf team will
finally vie for one of 10 available spots in
the NCAA Women's Golf Championship
when it tees off at the West Regional at the
Randolph Park North Golf Course in Tuc
son, Ariz, this weekend. The eighth-ranked
Cardinal, one of 18 teams selected to com
pete in the regional, is expected to earn the
right to advance to Athens, Ga. later this
month.
Stanford is coming off of a somewhat
disappointing third-place finish at the
warm-up California Intercollegiate which
it hosted earlier this month, and hopes to
rebound and turn in a solid performance in
this qualifying tournament.
This year, the NCAA Committee has
instituted a regional format in women's
golf. In previous years, the NCAA has sim
ply selected 17 teams from around the
nation to participate in a single champi
onship tournament. Now, a total of 204
golfers will participate in the West and East
Regionals, the latter of which also takes

place this weekend in Baton Rouge, La. Of
those, 95 will advance to the nationals.
Stanford will be led by senior captain
Martha Richards, who most recently fin
ished third among individuals at the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate. Richards, a first
team All-Pacific 10 Conference player this
season, has finished 40th in each of the last
two NCAA Championships. Junior Melin
da Daniels and sophomore Jamille Jose,
both recipients of All-Pac-10 honorable
mention honors, will join freshmen Vicky
Strada and Julie Bowen to round out the
Cardinal's starting squad.
The team played a practice round at
Randolph Park North Golf Course yester
day and will kick off the first round of the
three-round qualifying tournament today.
Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin was opti
mistic about the Cardinal's chances of
qualifying for the NCAA Championship.
Last year, Stanford had its highest nation
al finish ever at Arizona State's Karsten
Golf Course, placing fourth overall.
"I'm pleased we've been selected to com
pete in the Regionals," Baldwin said. "I'm
hoping we'll be one of the 10 teams to
emerge from Tucson and head on to
Athens. I think we'll do it."
