# Shedding shyness
## Group helps combat self-consciousness, self-criticism 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
Stanford has groups for the
happy, the grumpy and the dopey.
But few know there's one for the
bashful.
Confronted with the Farm's
competitive atmosphere and a
plethora of new faces, some stu
dents find it difficult to speak up
in class or talk to strangers at par
ties.
But a support group, which has
grown out of a long history of
Stanford psychological research,

offers many shy students a chance
to change their behavior.
"Stanford definitely intensified
my shyness," said "Amy," a
sophomore. "When I came as a
freshman, I was so overwhelmed
with the bigness of Stanford and
how smart everyone else was. I be
came really self-conscious and
self-critical."
When Amy noticed a flyer for
Lynne Henderson's "Shyness
Group" at Cowell Student Health
Center, she decided to attend one
of the meetings.
During the first session, Hen

derson asked the students to learn
as much as possible about each
other and then left for 10 minutes
to encourage conversation, ex
plained Amy. When Henderson re
turned, she asked the group mem
bers what they had discussed.
Although there are only three
students participating this quar
ter, Henderson, a psychologist at
the Palo Alto Shyness Clinic, said
that in the past there have been as
many as a dozen regular partici
pants.
"It is very difficult for shy people to
come in," she said. "They drop out
often."
Blaming themselves
Henderson's group meets once a week
on campus to talk about shyness, partici
pate in role playing and learn strategies
for dealing with social situations out of
class.
"People who are shy often blame
themselves, rather than their behavior,"
Henderson said. "They say to them
selves, 'There's something wrong with
112 H
me.
The group uses several techniques to
overcome shyness. For one session, the
members videotaped themselves in a
social situation and later watched the
tape to see differences between their per
ceived and actual behavior.
In addition, group members keep a
personal journal of their daily conversa
tions, including their feelings and anxiety
level during social encounters, explained
Amy.

"Students tell me their own goals —
sometimes it's being able to speak up in
class or keeping a conversation going at
parties," Henderson said. "The group
helps people to think differently about
situations. People who are shy think you
have to socially act like a movie star."
According to Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo's research with the Stanford
Shyness Project in the 19705, more than
80 percent of the general population has
been shy at some point in their lives. Of
these, more than 40 percent considered
themselves shy at the time they were sur
veyed.
"Shyness is a much bigger problem
than anybody recognizes," Henderson
said.
According to Zimbardo, American val
ues — especially the overemphasis on
competition and individual achievement
— may be partly responsible for the
prevalence of shyness.
"I thought about everything that
other people knew rather than what I
knew," Amy said. "You start to wonder if
you're really as good as all of these peo
ple."

But she added that the techniques the
group uses are effective. "I've learned
conversational techniques and how to
keep my self-image up."
A history of shyness
Although the group is the main
resource for shy students, research on
shyness at Stanford originally developed
out of a "prison study" conducted by Zim
bardo in the summer of 1971.
Twenty-four male, paid volunteers
were randomly assigned roles as either
guards or prisoners. Although the volun
teers were chosen because they appeared
normal on psychological tests, they
behaved in strange, pathological ways
once placed in a simulated prison setting.
"The study essentially was aimed at
studying the effects of being imprisoned
in a psychological prison," Zimbardo said.
The guards moved from being initially
authoritarian to acting in mean, sadistic
ways. The prisoners responded by com
plying to the guards' demands, feeling
emotionally distressed and helpless.
The study was terminated on the sixth
day rather than being allowed to run for

the planned two-week period because
both the guards and prisoners had
become unable to distinguish themselves
from their roles.
"The obvious connection between the
prison study and shyness is the subjective
construction of reality," Zimbardo said.
"The shy person surrenders their free
dom of speech and action in anticipation
of being rejected in a social situation."
Zimbardo and about a dozen students
then began to meet informally to discuss
shyness, eventually meeting as the
"Undergraduate Seminar on Shyness."
The class conducted experimental
research on shyness, surveying and inter
viewing more than 10,000 people in nine
countries.
Later, the Stanford Shyness Clinic
was officially formed to test different
techniques in treating shyness. "The
approach is behavioral-cognitive — we
try to change people's behavior in social
situations, as well as making them think
differently about social situations," Zim
bardo said.
While she was a graduate student,
Margaret Marnell, a clinical psychologist

in the Department of Behavioral
Medicine, worked with Zimbardo and the
shyness project to create the.first campus
shyness group.
"We started the pilot group with an
advertisement," Marnell said, adding
that members' shyness often made group
discussion difficult. "We used silence to
make them talk about what was bother
ing them. The therapist just sits there
until somebody talks."
Patients were able to change their
behavior by applying situational tactics
learned in class to the real world as well
as talking about their shyness problem
within a group, explained Zimbardo. "We
were able to make a difference," he
added.
The shyness project also stimulated
other social psychologists to research
shyness among adults. In 1980, Zimbardo
joined forces with Henderson, who began
the shyness group at the Cowell.
Since then, she has offered shy people
a place to learn and deal with shyness in
Stanford's competitive environment.
"It definitely helped me a lot, it's real
ly worthwhile," said Amy.
