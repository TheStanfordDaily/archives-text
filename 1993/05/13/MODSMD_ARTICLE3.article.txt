# Shedding shyness
## Group helps combat self-consciousness, self-criticism 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
Stanford has groups for the
happy, the grumpy and the dopey.
But few know there's one for the
bashful.
Confronted with the Farm's
competitive atmosphere and a
plethora of new faces, some stu
dents find it difficult to speak up
in class or talk to strangers at par
ties.
But a support group, which has
grown out of a long history of
Stanford psychological research,

offers many shy students a chance
to change their behavior.
"Stanford definitely intensified
my shyness," said "Amy," a
sophomore. "When I came as a
freshman, I was so overwhelmed
with the bigness of Stanford and
how smart everyone else was. I be
came really self-conscious and
self-critical."
When Amy noticed a flyer for
Lynne Henderson's "Shyness
Group" at Cowell Student Health
Center, she decided to attend one
of the meetings.
During the first session, Hen

derson asked the students to learn
as much as possible about each
other and then left for 10 minutes
to encourage conversation, ex
plained Amy. When Henderson re
turned, she asked the group mem
bers what they had discussed.
Although there are only three
students participating this quar
ter, Henderson, a psychologist at
the Palo Alto Shyness Clinic, said
that in the past there have been as
many as a dozen regular partici
pants.
