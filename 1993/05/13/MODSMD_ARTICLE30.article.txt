# For the record

A story in yesterday's Daily
reported that the Faculty Senate is
likely to discuss recommendations
of the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education until the end of
next year. Actually, the commis
sion's report won't be released
until June 1994, and the senate
will not discuss the commission's
work until after that date.
In addition, the article stated
that the Policy and Planning
Board is charged with examining
the University's budget process.
Actually, the charge of the board
is to discuss whatever issues are
of interest to the faculty.
An article in Tuesday's Daily
about the University Committee
on Research incorrectly attributed
the following quote to a Kenneth
Howard: "I'm a fairly strong advo
cate of personal privacy in things
that don't need to be looked into.
But this is different â€” this is in
the spirit of the honor code." The
quote should have been attributed
to Chemistry Prof. Stephen Boxer,
a committee member.
