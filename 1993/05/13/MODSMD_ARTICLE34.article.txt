# Co-ops cop student interest
## 
### Michael Green Staff writer 
The combined efforts of the seven campus co-ops
have once again proved that advertising can breed
popularity.
In order to bolster interest in the co-op alterna
tive — which appeared abysmally unpopular in last
year's Draw — representatives from each of the co
ops plugged their cause at several dormitories and
held informational meetings before this week's
housing lottery.
And judging by the number of students who
obtained priority standing, their efforts were suc
cessful: The Enchanted Broccoli Forest issued an
estimated between 50 and 100 priorities; whereas
Columbae, Synergy, Kairos and Terra doled out
approximately 80, 90, 200 and 250 priorities, respec
tively.
This signals a huge upturn from last year, when
Bill Georges, acting director of the Housing Center,
said there was "a significant problem" with many
co-ops and Row houses attracting residents. EBF,
for example, drew at about 4,600 for men without
priorities last year. Because of this, Georges sug
gested the dorm visits to stimulate interest in co-op
living.
Many co-op residents said they were excited by
the upsurge in interest: "I think it's neat that new
faces are coming into the co-op community," said
senior Arin Trook, Columbae's house manager.

However, some residents suspect there may be a
down side to the resurgent popularity of the houses
— that this heightened interest might prevent cur
rent residents from being able to draw back into the
co-ops themselves.
"I'm kind of tentative about it The only way
to tell is when the numbers come in," said Carl
Goldschmidt, EBF's house manager and a motiva
tor of the co-op outreach. "You want more people to
get interested, but the returning residents want to
live there too."
Still, others remain thankful, like John Ott,
Terra's resident assistant.
"If you're going to have problems, that's one of
the better ones to have," he said.
The increased number of preferences comes
despite the requirement that students perform a
house job at a co-op to obtain a priority. Chores
ranged from cleaning and cooking to painting and
mowing the lawn. In doing so, residents said, stu
dents would be "forced" to get a feel for co-op life.
"This house stays a lot cleaner when people care.
If people are willing to do house jobs, they'll feel bet
ter about doing them next year," said Jena Hickey,
house manager of Kairos.
The large number of students who agreed to do a
job dispelled concerns of some current co-op resi
dents that open slots in their houses would be
stuffed with dissatisfied Draw victims — people pre
sumably not committed to the communal atmo
sphere and obligations.
