Hundreds of birds invade home
PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) - Hundreds of
birds flew down a chimney and into a family's
home, leaving a mess of soot and fallen feathers
layered over by bird droppings.
Chris Thomas, her husband and their son were at
home Sunday when a roar suddenly came from the
chimney. Firefighters were called, but before they
arrived the source of the noise broke through the glass
panes of a fireplace cover and flew into the house.
"It was exactly like 'The Birds,' except they
didn't attack people," Thomas said, referring to
the Alfred Hitchcock film.
Firefighters arrived and collected the birds
with their hands, feet, brooms and other imple
ments and released them outdoors. The birds cir
cled the house a few times and then flew right
back down the chimney. Firefighters returned
and covered the chimney with a board.
The species couldn't immediately be deter
mined, but the birds were small and — at least
after they came through the chimney — black.
"I had just — just — completed redoing the
whole downstairs," Thomas said. "You cannot
imagine what hundreds and hundreds of loose
birds can do in your house."

"The feathers were really flying there," fire
fighter Tom Schiedermayer said.
Town renamed Joe, Montana
HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Now that the people
of Montana's smallest incorporated town have
decided to change its name to Joe in honor of
quarterback Joe Montana, the people of Ismay
aren't sure how they'll refer to themselves.
. Joeans? Maybe Joeites? Or Joeys? Joe-ettes?
"We haven't quite decided what you call people
from Joe," said city clerk Wayne Rieger.
There should be enough time for the eastern
Montana town's 22 residents to decide.
An official proclamation formalizing last
night's name-change decision isn't scheduled
until July 3. The switch won't take effect until
football season starts in late summer.
Rieger called a special city council meeting at
his house and it was decided to put the issue to an
immediate vote. It didn't take long.
"We've taken a canvass of the town and every
body with the exception of one, who's not here,
voted yeah," Rieger said. Adoption later of a reso
lution declaring Ismay as Joe during the football
season will be a mere formality.
