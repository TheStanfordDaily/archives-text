## Picking the best of summer's pix 
### 
I've gone an entire volume without making
any predictions. No Oscar, Golden Globe,
not even Razzie picks. But as deadlines
creep closer, a simple, mindless no-brainer
of a column — like handicapping this sum
mer's blockbusters — starts to look awfully
good. Here goes:
No. 1: Last Action Hero
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Can you say mo'
money? An 11 year-old action-movie buff
gets transported into a film where he meets

his favorite hero, d la "Purple
Rose of Cairo." Expect lots of
explosions, but little carnage
— after all, PG-13 is the rating
du jour.
No. 2: Jurassic Park

How, you ask, could I have bet against
this summer's most hotly anticipated flick?
Simple. "Jaws" was rated R, "Jurassic" is
rated PG — and they still turned down Bar
ney's request for a starring role.
Low gore quotient won't satisfy Crichton
fans who made the book a bestseller. And if
the effects don't have that "T2" gotta-see-it
quality... well, there's always the merchan
dising.
No. 3: Made in America
Last summer, many a media maven mis
takenly maligned Whoopi Goldberg's "Sis
ter Act." Not this year — TV terrors Ted
Danson and Will "Fresh Prince" Smith, and
this tale of artificial insemination gone
astray promise a secure cash flow.
N0.4: Hot Shots! Part Deux
Gives you that "Naked Gun" feeling,
doesn't it? Charlie Sheen, now a kickboxing
celibate monk in Thailand, sheds his robes
to make the world safe for truth, justice and
sequel number three. Iraqis, beware.
No. 5: Sliver
Not since Hitchcock's "Rear Window"
has there been such an insightful examina
tion of the twisted psychology underlying
voyeurism and... wait, that's the press re
lease. Sharon Stone plays a recent divorcee
who moves into a new apartment and gets

N'Gai Croal

more than she bargained for — more men
(two, to be exact), more death (a string of
murders) and more inequity (rumored full
frontal shots of William Baldwin were cut to
avoid the dreaded NC-17).
No. 6: The Firm
WARNING: John Grisham, author of the
original novel, is an atrocious writer. Even
by page-turner standards, he falls short —
we only turn the pages to see how he resolves
his mildly intriguing premises. That said,

Tom Cruise is all this vehicle
needs to cash in at the box of
fice.
No. 7: In the Line of Fire

Like Kevin Costner in"The Bodyguard,"
Clint Eastwood plays an angst-ridded Secret
Service agent out to prevent another assassi
nation. Admittedly, the President of the
United States won't sing "I Will Always Love
You," but Clint's return to Dirty Harryesque
action bodes well for us all.
No. 8: The Fugitive
After the bombulous "Regarding Henry,"
Harrison Ford returned to action, which
paid off with "Patriot Games." This big
screen adaptation of the TV series — about
a man on the run from the police, who be
lieve he murdered his wife — should reward
him again.
No. 9: Poetic Justice
John Singleton's name will pull in the se
rious moviegoer, while Janet Jackson will
bring in the rest. Michael's baby sister plays
Justice, a homegirl/poet from South Central
L.A. who comes of age on a roadtrip to Oak
land. Maya Angelou's writing the poetry —
can a Bill Clinton cameo be far behind?
No. 10: True Romance
The Cast: Christian Slater, Rosanna Ar
quette, Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Sam Jack
son, Val Kilmer and Dennis Hopper. The Di
rector: Tony "Last Boy Scout" Scott. The
Writer: Quentin "Reservoir Dogs" Taranti
no. The Rating: R (almost NC-17) for vio
lence. I'm sure Joe Bob would say "Check it
out." ■
