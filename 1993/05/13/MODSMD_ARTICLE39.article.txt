## Shock of the new or just shock value 
### 
Avant garde. Literally translated from
the French, the phrase means "artsy
and incomprehensible."
Well, maybe not, but in this Age of Prag
matism there seems to be a general disdain
for literature, or any other sort of art that
willfully rejects the structural, thematic or
cultural norms of the past. It reminds the
baby boomers of all of their bad acid trips,
and the twentysomething generation just
doesn't have the time to deal
with it. ————

Even vocal proponents of
artistic freedom during the
NEA debates assumed the air

of indulgent parents, winking
and shrugging at the work of Karen Finley
and Robert Mapplethorpe. We kept hearing
things like "He also has beautiful pictures of
flowers? as if Mapplethorpe needed some
one to make excuses for him.
In his stern and impassioned acceptance
of the National Arts Club medal of honor a
few months ago, even Aleksandr Solzhenit
syn — a man whose name is almost synony
mous with revolution —lambasted what he
called the "cult of novelty, with its assertion
that art need not be good or pure, just so
long as it is new, newer and newer still." Is
this the same Solzhenitsyn? What's going on
here?
Of course, the question of the inherent
value of "newness" is a problematic one. Art
can't communicate to its audience without a
language of cultural icons and structural
conventions. Discard them completely, and
the artists are left helpless in an artistic
Babel — expressing themselves vehemently
to no one but themselves.
On the other hand, art which satisfies all
of our expectations is fundamentally inca
pable of changing us. No matter how divert
ing the literary jaunt may be, it will always
take us back to where we started. The power
of art to change us, to make us question our
established ideas, either consciously or sub
consciously, should be the litmus test which

separates important art from harmless driv
el.
One other thing: literature which isn't
new, which disappoints none of our expec
tations, is boring as hell.
The compromise authors must strike is
perhaps more evident in the abstract but
analogous art form of music. The succes
sion of notes in a musical piece must fol
low fairly strict conventions of rhythm,

melody and harmony, in
order to distinguish itself
from mere cacophony. It
must limit itself even fur
ther to gain admittance to

a particular genre: jazz,
blues, opera, etc. Yet, a composer who
doesn't work any innovation into his work
will not only bore his audience to death,
but might even get slapped with a copy
right lawsuit.
Therefore, all music must maintain a deli
cate tension between expected and unexpect
ed notes, between rules and randomness.
It is the same in literature, but all too
often the writers who attempt to free their
writing from the shackles of literary tradi
tion eschew any sort of structure or control
over their work. Once freed, their writing ei
ther collapses in a heap and whines or cele
brates its liberation by running around in
circles, spouting gibberish.
There will always be a place for this sort
of extreme avant-gardism, but it will never
be mainstream and it will continue to make
a bad name for the truly innovative, yet res
onant work out there, the literature which
assimilates the literature of the past and the
icons of our culture and then goes on to
break new ground.
Hence, we will always have the question:
How many avant garde novelists does it take
to change a light bulb?
Answer: Two. One to describe the task
using only expletives, prepositions and the
color names from Crayola crayons and an
other to take out all of the punctuation. ■
