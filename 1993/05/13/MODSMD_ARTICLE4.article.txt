# Asian-American studies classes face uncertain future next year

### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences has announced a commitment to
adding more Asian-American studies
classes, but a combination of budgetary
and faculty problems may make the
progress toward an Asian-American stud
ies major slow and somewhat uncertain.
According to Assoc. Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences Albert Camarillo, the
school — partly in response to student de
mand — is making efforts to increase the
number of Asian-American class offer
ings, and as many as four courses could be
added for the next academic year.
"We have a commitment to augment
the number of classes," Camarillo said.
"There is currently a small number of
classes, about five, and there need to be
additional classes."
However, Camarillo added that recent
budget cuts have limited the possibilities.
"There's no question that we're in a much
more constrained financial position than

we were several years ago," he said.
In addition, a fewer faculty than ex
pected will be on campus next year to
teach Asian-American courses, meaning
the number of classes offered in the sub
ject could be about the same as this year.
Assoc. Histoiy Prof. Gordon Chang is
taking a leave of absence next year, leav
ing Comparative Literature Asst. Prof.
David Palumbo-Liu as the only Humani
ties and Sciences professor teaching
Asian-American studies courses.
In addition, to expand the Asian-Amer
ican offerings, the University had invited
two Asian-American studies post-doctor
al fellows to teach at Stanford in positions
funded by the Irvine Foundation for mul
ticultural curriculum development. How
ever, only one person accepted the offer.
So — although other parts of the Uni
versity, such as the Anthropology Depart
ment and the Law School, sometimes
offer Asian-American studies classes —
only two people will be teaching Asian-
American courses in Humanities and Sci
ences next year. Thus the number of

teachers will not expand and only four
classes will be taught, similar to the num
ber already offered.
And if money and personnel considera
tions have combined to hinder rapid ex
pansion of course offerings, the possibility
of promptly creating a degree-granting
major in American Studies may be even
slimmer.
"I don't think [the chance of getting a
degree-granting program] looks very
good," said Chang, who was brought to
Stanford with Palumbo-Liu in 1990 to
teach Asian-American studies classes.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter
stressed that a degree program would
need to go through the "proper channels."
A proposal must be presented to the facul
ty, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the school's dean and the Faculty
Senate.
As for University President Gerhard
Casper's stance on the issue, Fetter said
he "is very judicious about when he voices
