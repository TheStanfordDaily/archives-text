# Asian-American studies classes face uncertain future next year
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences has announced a commitment to
adding more Asian-American studies
classes, but a combination of budgetary
and faculty problems may make the
progress toward an Asian-American stud
ies major slow and somewhat uncertain.
According to Assoc. Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences Albert Camarillo, the
school — partly in response to student de
mand — is making efforts to increase the
number of Asian-American class offer
ings, and as many as four courses could be
added for the next academic year.
"We have a commitment to augment
the number of classes," Camarillo said.
"There is currently a small number of
classes, about five, and there need to be
additional classes."
However, Camarillo added that recent
budget cuts have limited the possibilities.
"There's no question that we're in a much
more constrained financial position than

we were several years ago," he said.
In addition, a fewer faculty than ex
pected will be on campus next year to
teach Asian-American courses, meaning
the number of classes offered in the sub
ject could be about the same as this year.
Assoc. Histoiy Prof. Gordon Chang is
taking a leave of absence next year, leav
ing Comparative Literature Asst. Prof.
David Palumbo-Liu as the only Humani
ties and Sciences professor teaching
Asian-American studies courses.
In addition, to expand the Asian-Amer
ican offerings, the University had invited
two Asian-American studies post-doctor
al fellows to teach at Stanford in positions
funded by the Irvine Foundation for mul
ticultural curriculum development. How
ever, only one person accepted the offer.
So — although other parts of the Uni
versity, such as the Anthropology Depart
ment and the Law School, sometimes
offer Asian-American studies classes —
only two people will be teaching Asian-
American courses in Humanities and Sci
ences next year. Thus the number of

teachers will not expand and only four
classes will be taught, similar to the num
ber already offered.
And if money and personnel considera
tions have combined to hinder rapid ex
pansion of course offerings, the possibility
of promptly creating a degree-granting
major in American Studies may be even
slimmer.
"I don't think [the chance of getting a
degree-granting program] looks very
good," said Chang, who was brought to
Stanford with Palumbo-Liu in 1990 to
teach Asian-American studies classes.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter
stressed that a degree program would
need to go through the "proper channels."
A proposal must be presented to the facul
ty, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the school's dean and the Faculty
Senate.
As for University President Gerhard
Casper's stance on the issue, Fetter said
he "is very judicious about when he voices
opinions so as not to put undue
pressure on staff when it hasn't
been discussed yet."
"Many things would have to be
considered, such as academic priori
ties and financial priorities," Fetter
added.
Palumbo-Liu, however, said: "I
don't think that [a program 1 would
be that expensive. The faculty's
here; it's just a matter of adminis
trative support."
Some students who support the
establishment of an Asian-Ameri
can studies major expressed frustra

tion with slower progress toward
the major than they had hoped for.
"It's been moving at a slow
pace," said Asian American Student
Association issues co-chair Ken
Tan. "We're not articulating final
goals like how many classes there
will be, but what kind and how
many possible faculty members."
Freshman Asian-American stud
ies supporter Mike Choo said the
administration needs to demon
strate more commitment. "I know
of only two faculty members of
Asian-American studies. It's very
hard for them to do everything."
He said more hiring of professors
is needed. "I don't know the specific
needs of a degree program," Choo
said, "but the need for qualified

teachers of Asian-American studies
is great."
But Camarillo said his school is
listening to students and added that
the recent push for more Asian-
American studies within the admin
istration can be attributed to the
efforts of students.
There is "an ongoing commit
ment to multicultural studies, and
we're paying attention to the
requests of students," he said.
"We're sensitive to the students,
and we acknowledge the students'
desires."
M. Harrison Hsieh, chair of the
Asian and Pacific Islanders for Edu
cation and Change at Stanford, said
he sees the University response as a
direct result of student action.

According to Hsieh, Casper had
Camarillo and Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas write to
students in response to a recent sur
vey measuring interest in an Asian-
American studies major. "The state
ment of support from the School of
Humanities and Sciences was explic
itly for expanding programs, and
that letter was prompted from the
rally," Hsieh said.
Palumbo-Liu said that students
are formulating proposals for a
degree-granting program. "I think
that the survey that was publicized
gave momentum to the movement,"
he said. "The students are the driv
ing force behind this. The faculty
are just here to consult."
And students said they don't

want to lose the momentum they've
created for Asian-American studies,
as has happened in years past.
"Every couple years there are
some students who become active
with this, there's some nominal sup
port, and then a lull," Choo said.
"The student body doesn't under
stand the historical perspective.
We're very frustrated with the lack
of support from the top."
Chang, too, pointed to the histo
ry of Asian-American studies at
Stanford. "Students now aren't the
only ones who have been commit
ted to this issue," he said. "Stu
dents were very vocal in the '70's;
there was a lot of interest. Stanford
has been confronted by this many
times.

versity, such as the Anthropology Depart
ment and the Law School, sometimes
offer Asian-American studies classes —
only two people will be teaching Asian-
American courses in Humanities and Sci
ences next year. Thus the number of

teachers will not expand and only four
classes will be taught, similar to the num
ber already offered.
And if money and personnel considera
tions have combined to hinder rapid ex
pansion of course offerings, the possibility
of promptly creating a degree-granting
major in American Studies may be even
slimmer.
"I don't think [the chance of getting a
degree-granting program] looks very
good," said Chang, who was brought to
Stanford with Palumbo-Liu in 1990 to
teach Asian-American studies classes.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter
stressed that a degree program would
need to go through the "proper channels."
A proposal must be presented to the facul
ty, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the school's dean and the Faculty
Senate.
As for University President Gerhard
Casper's stance on the issue, Fetter said
he "is very judicious about when he voices
opinions so as not to put undue
pressure on staff when it hasn't
been discussed yet."
"Many things would have to be
considered, such as academic priori
ties and financial priorities," Fetter
added.
Palumbo-Liu, however, said: "I
don't think that [a program 1 would
be that expensive. The faculty's
here; it's just a matter of adminis
trative support."
Some students who support the
establishment of an Asian-Ameri
can studies major expressed frustra

tion with slower progress toward
the major than they had hoped for.
"It's been moving at a slow
pace," said Asian American Student
Association issues co-chair Ken
Tan. "We're not articulating final
goals like how many classes there
will be, but what kind and how
many possible faculty members."
Freshman Asian-American stud
ies supporter Mike Choo said the
administration needs to demon
strate more commitment. "I know
of only two faculty members of
Asian-American studies. It's very
hard for them to do everything."
He said more hiring of professors
is needed. "I don't know the specific
needs of a degree program," Choo
said, "but the need for qualified

teachers of Asian-American studies
is great."
But Camarillo said his school is
listening to students and added that
the recent push for more Asian-
American studies within the admin
istration can be attributed to the
efforts of students.
There is "an ongoing commit
ment to multicultural studies, and
we're paying attention to the
requests of students," he said.
"We're sensitive to the students,
and we acknowledge the students'
desires."
M. Harrison Hsieh, chair of the
Asian and Pacific Islanders for Edu
cation and Change at Stanford, said
he sees the University response as a
direct result of student action.

According to Hsieh, Casper had
Camarillo and Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas write to
students in response to a recent sur
vey measuring interest in an Asian-
American studies major. "The state
ment of support from the School of
Humanities and Sciences was explic
itly for expanding programs, and
that letter was prompted from the
rally," Hsieh said.
Palumbo-Liu said that students
are formulating proposals for a
degree-granting program. "I think
that the survey that was publicized
gave momentum to the movement,"
he said. "The students are the driv
ing force behind this. The faculty
are just here to consult."
And students said they don't

want to lose the momentum they've
created for Asian-American studies,
as has happened in years past.
"Every couple years there are
some students who become active
with this, there's some nominal sup
port, and then a lull," Choo said.
"The student body doesn't under
stand the historical perspective.
We're very frustrated with the lack
of support from the top."
Chang, too, pointed to the histo
ry of Asian-American studies at
Stanford. "Students now aren't the
only ones who have been commit
ted to this issue," he said. "Stu
dents were very vocal in the '70's;
there was a lot of interest. Stanford
has been confronted by this many
times.
