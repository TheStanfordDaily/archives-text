# hAngin' with the homies where to go when you're out on the town

### 
the new year has brought sweeping
changes to the cuisine of the Trat
toria Romana, now renamed the
Nouveau Trattoria.

Annie Nunan, a nationally recog
nized French restaurateur from San
Francisco, has elevated the Italian cui
sine and nearly doubled the menu op
tions by adding an assortment of clas
sic French hors d'oeuvres, salads,
soups and entries.
Her distinctive sauces mark the
most profound change in the menu:
she uses reductions of flavorful stocks
that are made daily.
Using reductions obviates the need
for butter or roux to thicken the sauce,
thus the sauces are lighter and do not
mask the natural flavor of the meat or
fish.
The grilled sea bass bursts with fla
vor through the light beurre blanc

sauce and the natural gaminess of the
duck is enhanced by her delicate or
ange sauce. Even the sauces for the pas
tas have been lightened to allow the

dinin'

herbs and vegetables to titillate the
palate.
After supper, treat yourself to
dessert. The dessert cart has some
thing for everyone, with choices
ranging from tiramisu to fresh rasp
berries.
