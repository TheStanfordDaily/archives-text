everybody goes to Jose's for a dif
ferent reason. Some go for the
taste of Caribbean and South
American cuisine, others for the exot
ic fruit drinks, but now with an ex
panded interior, Jose's is the place for
live music and dancing.
Thursday through Saturday, live
music begins at 9:30 p.m. and contin-

dancin'

ues until 1:30 a.m. — somehow Jose's
has broken free of the strict Palo Alto
ordinances that state explicitly that no
one should have fun after midnight.

Thursday night Jose's features a
Brazilian band, Friday is salsa, and
Saturday they go all out with Ja
maican reggae. After Sunsplash, this is
the only place to go for live reggae.
The crowd tends to be older (35-45
years old), so if you go in a group you
may feel more comfortable. Chances
are your group will dominate the
dance floor. After 9:30 p.m. there is a
cover charge of $5, but you can arrive
at 9:00 and order some drinks to es
cape the cover.
Whether you are looking to party it
up to live reggae or to satisfy a raging
appetite, Jose's will do you right.
