People at the Empire Tap Room looked
like they were a support group for recover
ing Epstein-Barr patients.
Beer selection is overwhelming, and reason
ably priced at $3 a pint. Although well rounded,
the wine list sports a cryptic "Other Reds" cate
gory.
The five of us got to Pearl's Oyster Bar right
at last call (1 l:lsish). We asked the owner when
Pearl's closes.

He said
"When I've
had enough."
So we suggest

drinkin'

calling first and asking politely "Have you had
enough yet? And if you haven't, do you have any
idea when you might?"
Pearl's is cool because they have nightly drink
specials, carry cider by the pitcher and also have a
raspberry lambic that puts Sam Adams' cranber
ry version to absolute shame. Plus in the Dopple-
Bock section had the Celebrator from Munich
and Optimator by Spaten — these are truly the
Pro-Gainers of beers.
By the time we reached Island Food & Grog,
we were pretty rocked. They have four flavors of
Miller, three flavors of Bud and two flavors of
Coors.
Island also has two pool tables, electronic darts
and a foosball table with a caustic urine smell.
Avoid the foosball table at all costs.
