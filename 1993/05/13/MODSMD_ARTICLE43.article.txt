# Director Matthew Causey at it again with his latest avant-garde production,
## 'DEATH' 
### Story by Angie Chuang 
Dimly lit figures gyrate to pounding
music on an elaborate, three-tiered
set. A couple in front-center stage
embrace, swaying and caressing seductively.
A rotating stairway spins across the stage as
actors step off the tiers. Stuffed mannequins
are passed down the tiers. Suspended televi
sion sets show images of bare feet walking
through water. A woman eats a stuffed bird. A
man, connected to the set by giant elastic
bands, wrestles violently with another. Lights
flash from a spinning disco ball.

Episodes from Drama doctoral student
Matthew Causey's latest production, "Death
(Henry IV: The Uncanny)," these scenes are
all part of the "collision" of clashing ideas and
sensory experiences that constitute his world
of avant-garde theater.
The final chapter in Causey's trilogy, "The
History of the Avant-Garde," "Death" contin
ues the tradition of "Kill the Dog" (1991) and
"The Laboratory of Hallucinations" (1992)
with its enigmatic, bizarre images and lack of
a traditionally linear plot.
However, while "Kill" and "Laboratory"
were characterized by harsh, rapid-fire and
often shocking images — "like turning the
volume up to 10 and yelling, 'Get out of the
way!' — 'Death' slams on the brakes,"
Causey says, explaining the difference be
tween his latest production and the first two
chapters of the trilogy.
Departing from its predecessors, with
longer dialogues and a more rhythmic than
jolting pace, "Death" caps off the trilogy with
what Causey describes as "a movement toward
stasis, but with an unspeakably grim ending."
While the production incorporates the
writings of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein
and psychologist Sigmund Freud, the prima
ry take-off point for "Death" is "Henry IV," a
play by Luigi Pirandello about a man who
has gone mad and believes he is the medieval
emperor of Germany.
However, Causey's play veers dramatically
from Pirandello's text and, on the surface, ap
pears to have little to do with it. In the spirit
of avant-garde, viewers will be hard-pressed
to find a storyline in "Death."
Like much cutting-edge theater, "Death"
may seem elusive and random to some.
Causey says that, while those who embrace
the form are enraptured by his work, he has
also met with many reactions of confusion,
frustration and even disgust.
Causey offers a paradoxical answer to the
question of what audiences should do with
avant-garde—how it should be interpreted or
not interpreted. While he says the experience
of watching itself should not require decipher
ing larger meanings, he admits there are deep
er messages that render the medium elitist.
Causey insists that avant-garde liberates
theater from storylines and narratives and,
much like abstract art, calls attention to the
medium rather than a cohesive theme.
people look at a Jackson Pollack

painting, they don't complain about not get
ting it,"he says. "They appreciate the way the
paint has been thrust across the canvas."
Similarly, "Death" is a sensory encounter
that is meant to disturb, provoke and enter
tain the viewers outside of a "habitual" re
sponse pattern, Causey says.
Describing its experiential nature, Drama
graduate student Rich Schoch, who plays Dr.
Dionisio Genoni, compares "Death" to a ten
nis match.
"There is nothing outside the moment of
watching [the play] and soaking it all in for
what it is," Schoch says. "There is no under
standing involved. No one ever watches a ten
nis match and then says, 'I don't get it.' "
With its multi-media format that includes
often-simultaneous dance, music, lip-synch-

ing and pre-recorded and live video clips,
"Death" does provide the sensory titillation
— and often overload — that Causey says he
tries to achieve.
However, there are "secret codes" in the
play, meant for the audience to think
through, Causey says, referring to the numer
ous abstract symbols within the work. "It's a
lot like a crossword puzzle that you have to
piece together."
Causey says he prefers to thinks of avant
garde's enigmatic nature as respectful to the
audience.
"I find traditional theater insulting, because
it gives the audience the easiest interpretation
possible. Instead, I'm giving them some tough
stuff," he says. "If it is elitist, let's accept it as
that and manipulate it to our advantage."

But even if his work is esoteric to some,
Causey personally is accessible and receptive
to his audience and actors, hardly fitting the
notorious mold of the avant-garde director.
Schoch describes Causey as the antidote to
the stereotypical, despotic "enfant terrible."
After acting and directing in the profes
sional theater for more than 10 years, Causey
returned to a university setting because he
wanted to experiment on a stage that was not
ruled by box-office sales.
The decision to teach and direct also was
motivated by Causey's paternal instincts. He
not only wanted to mentor and work with as
piring actors, but decided that teaching was a
more stable profession to pursue for his wife
and two children.
Appropriately, Causey is also somewhat of
a father figure to his troupe of actors, who
were carefully chosen based on "a certain
charisma and receptiveness to the medium,"
rather than by traditional auditions.
While he admits he can be "dictatorial"
about the "generalized vision" of his plays at
times, Causey says he tries to be receptive to
students' suggestions. "Death" has been
shaped and reshaped as the actors have ex
perimented, he adds.
Schoch praises Causey's teamwork-orient
ed style, saying that he has felt "safe and com
fortable [improvising]. Matthew (Causey) is
the most collaborative and generous director
I've ever worked with."
Just-graduated senior Marya Murphy, who
also acted in "Laboratory of Hallucinations,"
says she appreciates the fact that Causey takes
his actors seriously. "He's insane," she adds.
"But I don't hold that against him."
Like many who have worked with Causey,
sophomore Julie Arnall says she was initially
"taken aback by the strangeness" of his plays,
but because working with him is enjoyable,
the style grew on her. "Now I think of doing a
regular show as strange," she says.
And while much of "Death" is meant to
shock and disturb, fun is very much a part of
the experience for both actors and audience
members.
" 'Death' is meant to be very humorous,"
Causey says."I hope audiences find it very
funny."
Murphy says the fact that Causey "doesn't
take the whole thing completely seriously"
rubs off on the actors and allows them to cut
loose and enjoy themselves.
To illustrate this point, Schoch describes a
game of "drawing straws" that the male ac
tors play, to decide which of them will pro
vide the "revealed penis" one scene calls for.
"It's a very sexual show," he points out,
laughing. "The rotating penile exposure and
masturbatory aphrodisiac dancing alone is
worth the price of admission."

"Death (Henry IV: The Uncanny)" will play in
the Little Theater, next to Memorial Auditori
um, at 8 p.m. on May 12 through 15 and May
22; and at 11 p.m. on May 14 and 21.

Causey says, explaining the difference be
tween his latest production and the first two
chapters of the trilogy.
Departing from its predecessors, with
longer dialogues and a more rhythmic than
jolting pace, "Death" caps off the trilogy with
what Causey describes as "a movement toward
stasis, but with an unspeakably grim ending."
While the production incorporates the
writings of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein
and psychologist Sigmund Freud, the prima
ry take-off point for "Death" is "Henry IV," a
play by Luigi Pirandello about a man who
has gone mad and believes he is the medieval
emperor of Germany.
However, Causey's play veers dramatically
from Pirandello's text and, on the surface, ap
pears to have little to do with it. In the spirit
of avant-garde, viewers will be hard-pressed
to find a storyline in "Death."
Like much cutting-edge theater, "Death"
may seem elusive and random to some.
Causey says that, while those who embrace
the form are enraptured by his work, he has
also met with many reactions of confusion,
frustration and even disgust.
Causey offers a paradoxical answer to the
question of what audiences should do with
avant-garde—how it should be interpreted or
not interpreted. While he says the experience
of watching itself should not require decipher
ing larger meanings, he admits there are deep
er messages that render the medium elitist.
Causey insists that avant-garde liberates
theater from storylines and narratives and,
much like abstract art, calls attention to the
medium rather than a cohesive theme.
people look at a Jackson Pollack

painting, they don't complain about not get
ting it,"he says. "They appreciate the way the
paint has been thrust across the canvas."
Similarly, "Death" is a sensory encounter
that is meant to disturb, provoke and enter
tain the viewers outside of a "habitual" re
sponse pattern, Causey says.
Describing its experiential nature, Drama
graduate student Rich Schoch, who plays Dr.
Dionisio Genoni, compares "Death" to a ten
nis match.
"There is nothing outside the moment of
watching [the play] and soaking it all in for
what it is," Schoch says. "There is no under
standing involved. No one ever watches a ten
nis match and then says, 'I don't get it.' "
With its multi-media format that includes
often-simultaneous dance, music, lip-synch-

ing and pre-recorded and live video clips,
"Death" does provide the sensory titillation
— and often overload — that Causey says he
tries to achieve.
However, there are "secret codes" in the
play, meant for the audience to think
through, Causey says, referring to the numer
ous abstract symbols within the work. "It's a
lot like a crossword puzzle that you have to
piece together."
Causey says he prefers to thinks of avant
garde's enigmatic nature as respectful to the
audience.
"I find traditional theater insulting, because
it gives the audience the easiest interpretation
possible. Instead, I'm giving them some tough
stuff," he says. "If it is elitist, let's accept it as
that and manipulate it to our advantage."

But even if his work is esoteric to some,
Causey personally is accessible and receptive
to his audience and actors, hardly fitting the
notorious mold of the avant-garde director.
Schoch describes Causey as the antidote to
the stereotypical, despotic "enfant terrible."
After acting and directing in the profes
sional theater for more than 10 years, Causey
returned to a university setting because he
wanted to experiment on a stage that was not
ruled by box-office sales.
The decision to teach and direct also was
motivated by Causey's paternal instincts. He
not only wanted to mentor and work with as
piring actors, but decided that teaching was a
more stable profession to pursue for his wife
and two children.
Appropriately, Causey is also somewhat of
a father figure to his troupe of actors, who
were carefully chosen based on "a certain
charisma and receptiveness to the medium,"
rather than by traditional auditions.
While he admits he can be "dictatorial"
about the "generalized vision" of his plays at
times, Causey says he tries to be receptive to
students' suggestions. "Death" has been
shaped and reshaped as the actors have ex
perimented, he adds.
Schoch praises Causey's teamwork-orient
ed style, saying that he has felt "safe and com
fortable [improvising]. Matthew (Causey) is
the most collaborative and generous director
I've ever worked with."
Just-graduated senior Marya Murphy, who
also acted in "Laboratory of Hallucinations,"
says she appreciates the fact that Causey takes
his actors seriously. "He's insane," she adds.
"But I don't hold that against him."
Like many who have worked with Causey,
sophomore Julie Arnall says she was initially
"taken aback by the strangeness" of his plays,
but because working with him is enjoyable,
the style grew on her. "Now I think of doing a
regular show as strange," she says.
And while much of "Death" is meant to
shock and disturb, fun is very much a part of
the experience for both actors and audience
members.
" 'Death' is meant to be very humorous,"
Causey says."I hope audiences find it very
funny."
Murphy says the fact that Causey "doesn't
take the whole thing completely seriously"
rubs off on the actors and allows them to cut
loose and enjoy themselves.
To illustrate this point, Schoch describes a
game of "drawing straws" that the male ac
tors play, to decide which of them will pro
vide the "revealed penis" one scene calls for.
"It's a very sexual show," he points out,
laughing. "The rotating penile exposure and
masturbatory aphrodisiac dancing alone is
worth the price of admission."

"Death (Henry IV: The Uncanny)" will play in
the Little Theater, next to Memorial Auditori
um, at 8 p.m. on May 12 through 15 and May
22; and at 11 p.m. on May 14 and 21.

A scene from Director Matthew Causey's avant-garde play "Death." The play promises
to be more accessible than previous Causey performances.
Dimly lit figures gyrate to pounding
music on an elaborate, three-tiered
set. A couple in front-center stage
embrace, swaying and caressing seductively.
A rotating stairway spins across the stage as
actors step off the tiers. Stuffed mannequins
are passed down the tiers. Suspended televi
sion sets show images of bare feet walking
through water. A woman eats a stuffed bird. A
man, connected to the set by giant elastic
bands, wrestles violently with another. Lights
flash from a spinning disco ball.
What do these scenes have in common?
Episodes from Drama doctoral student
Matthew Causey's latest production, "Death
(Henry IV: The Uncanny)," these scenes are
all part of the "collision" of clashing ideas and
sensory experiences that constitute his world
of avant-garde theater.
The final chapter in Causey's trilogy, "The
History of the Avant-Garde," "Death" contin
ues the tradition of "Kill the Dog" (1991) and
"The Laboratory of Hallucinations" (1992)
with its enigmatic, bizarre images and lack of
a traditionally linear plot.
However, while "Kill" and "Laboratory"
were characterized by harsh, rapid-fire and
often shocking images — "like turning the
volume up to 10 and yelling, 'Get out of the
way!' — 'Death' slams on the brakes,"
Causey says, explaining the difference be
tween his latest production and the first two
