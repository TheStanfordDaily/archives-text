# RUNNING UP THAT HILL
## student musicians strive for stardom

It is a warm, balmy April evening. The
Coffee House, as is the case on most
spring Thursdays, overflows with
restive patrons. On the CoHo stage, the
band Occam's Razor performs
"unplugged," banking the show's success
simply on voices, acoustic guitars and the
audience's appetite for gentle, lilting pop
music.
After drawing from its considerable
original repertoire in the early portion of
the show, the band tackles familiar rock
standards. When they return to the stage
for an encore, the group breaks into Lou
Reed's classic, "Walk on the Wild Side." By
now spectators are swaying to the band's
every crescendo, and soon the song's
soothing restraint gives way to an emo
tional, rousing chorus. Reed's lyrics, "I
guess she had to crash/ Valium would have
helped that bash" have never sounded so
heartfelt.

The crowd responds appreciatively, a
signal of approval that the band members
receive grudgingly. While Occam's Razor,
like any other young band, will take all the
support it can get, they know that only the
appeal of their own, original songs can
vault them out of Stanford social events to
their desired place in popular-music's
bright lights.
Still seeking to establish a distinctive
voice, Occam's Razor — as well as solo
artists like Rachael Sage and Kwame Yao
Anku — struggles to set itself apart in a
Stanford musical landscape dotted with
Spin Doctors cover bands, and marked by
students' tastes for the familiar. And
though vastly different rays of light along
the rock spectrum, all three homegrown
acts share similar aspirations — and frus
trations — while they wait patiently for
the great leap forward.

Senior Rachael Sage has been writ
ing music since she was three. She
received her first four-track when
she was 11, her first synthesizer as
a seventh-grader. She was nearly
given a recording contract at the ripe old
age of 15.
Why, then, is she at Stanford, com
pleting a degree in drama, instead of din
ing at Spago with big-shot producers?
"Initially, I didn't have much faith I
would stay," she says recently. "But when I
came here, I did a complete 180." Whereas
Sage's precocious creative energy was ear

lier directed at writing "real pop music —
Debbie Gibson stuff," her arrival at college
was marked by a broadening of intellectu
al and artistic awareness.
"I came here and discovered acoustic,
folk, CoHo kind of music," Sage says. "My
emphasis shifted to lyrics.. . I started to
listen to the Indigo Girls, Elvis Costello —
people who tell stories a lot more than just
sing words that sound good together. And
I started to write that kind of music
more."
Sage's growing sense of the poetic
possibilities for her music was further
heightened by her trip to Ireland two
summers ago, an excursion originally
intended as an electronic music-based
project. But instead of MIDI computers
and drum machines, she became intoxi
cated with the Irish folk tradition.
"In Ireland I found so much music to
be inspired by — Irish music has a real

lyrical honesty, a lyrical and melodic
emphasis that is lacking from the
American music scene," she says. "[Being
in Ireland] gave me a more firm idea of
what kind of music I wanted to do."
While she reconsidered her musical
foundations, Sage discovered personal
avenues through which her songs could
travel. "When I was young, I didn't have
much of an idea of what 'women's music'
and its subject matter was," she says. "But
my involvement with the Women's Center
Collective (and other female organiza
tions) definitely informed a lot of my
songs."
Sage's musical and lyrical visions con
verged on her recently produced five-song
demo tape, one half a CD she hopes to
finish this summer. Sage's sound combines
warm, affecting melodies with intricate,
poignant stories of love and pain.
The tape opens with the evocative
lyrics of "Rain So Hard," approaching love
from the perspective of a prostitute:
"When I was warm and heaven-blessed I
blew apart my Sunday dress/ It fell like
mud onto the clouds and a deafened plan
et earth with sounds of sorrow and holy
bliss." On the tongue-in-cheek
"Gravedancing," Sage sings "I will set fire
to him, he who isn't human/1 will dance
upon the grave of his impersonality."
Echoes of Sage's musical influences
resound through the five songs. Sage's
pure soprano and combination of acoustic
guitar with synthesized sound recalls Tori
Amos and Kate Bush, while the Celtic feel
and plaintive words of "Begin To Stop"
nod to Van Morrison. The hopeful "Land
of Plenty" contains all the well-crafted
pop sensibilities of a song like the Indigos'
"Galileo."
Although Sage still relies heavily on
arrangement-heavy "production" — the
use of keyboards, synthesizers and drum
machines — she says her "goal is less to
highlight that equipment, and try to make
the music as live, as acoustic as possible."
Indeed, Sage has started to prefer her
music live, normally with only guitar
accompaniment, and admits that live per
formance "has become addictive. It can be

really therapeutic — you put a lot on dis
play when you're on a stage."
But finding a place on campus to
reach a large audience, aside from the
Coffee House, has been difficult. "The No.
1 problem for original musicians has to do
with the lack of venues, organization and
ability of students to have access to
venues," Sage says.
"If your music doesn't have a dance
beat, and can't be played at a party, you
won't have as many opportunities as a
cover band," she says. Still, Sage maintains
that she has received plenty of positive
response to her music, based on her live
concerts.
This summer, Sage, in between com
pleting her CD and shopping her demo to
record companies, will perform at the
Cottonwood Club in Greenwich Village.
Eventually, she hopes to form a band, con
tinue songwriting and pursue her interest

in musical arrangement for other lively
arts. "I'd like to be someone like Peter
Gabriel or Phillip Glass — someone who
performs their own music, and works with
other artists in dance, theater and film,"
she says.
Ambitious? Perhaps, but Sage is ready.
"It's a 24-hour job," she says of life as a
professional musician. "But I'm perfectly
willing and excited to do it when I get the
chance."
Junior Kwame Yao Anku tells the
story of how last summer, while
shopping for furniture, a homeless
man approached him outside one
store. The man promised to wash
Anku's car windshield for a dollar. Struck
by his ebullience, Anku agreed. As the

man washed the car, Anku observed, his
face bespoke so much enjoyment it was as
if "he were cleaning a Rolls-Royce."
But even as the man laughed and
sang, Anku quickly realized that there was
a sad resignation in the man's joy. "It hit
me — here's a guy who has no home, no
money, which is most people's greatest
fear," he says."For his disposition to be
one of happiness and laughter... it was
the idea that it's the same old shit, that
shit isn't getting any better."
That episode became the context of
"Same Old Song," one of four tracks on
