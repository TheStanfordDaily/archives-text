# RUNNING UP THAT HILL
## student musicians strive for stardom 
### story by romesh ratnesar artwork by alicia padron 
It is a warm, balmy April evening. The
Coffee House, as is the case on most
spring Thursdays, overflows with
restive patrons. On the CoHo stage, the
band Occam's Razor performs
"unplugged," banking the show's success
simply on voices, acoustic guitars and the
audience's appetite for gentle, lilting pop
music.
After drawing from its considerable
original repertoire in the early portion of
the show, the band tackles familiar rock
standards. When they return to the stage
for an encore, the group breaks into Lou
Reed's classic, "Walk on the Wild Side." By
now spectators are swaying to the band's
every crescendo, and soon the song's
soothing restraint gives way to an emo
tional, rousing chorus. Reed's lyrics, "I
guess she had to crash/ Valium would have
helped that bash" have never sounded so
heartfelt.

The crowd responds appreciatively, a
signal of approval that the band members
receive grudgingly. While Occam's Razor,
like any other young band, will take all the
support it can get, they know that only the
appeal of their own, original songs can
vault them out of Stanford social events to
their desired place in popular-music's
bright lights.
Still seeking to establish a distinctive
voice, Occam's Razor — as well as solo
artists like Rachael Sage and Kwame Yao
Anku — struggles to set itself apart in a
Stanford musical landscape dotted with
Spin Doctors cover bands, and marked by
students' tastes for the familiar. And
though vastly different rays of light along
the rock spectrum, all three homegrown
acts share similar aspirations — and frus
trations — while they wait patiently for
the great leap forward.

Senior Rachael Sage has been writ
ing music since she was three. She
received her first four-track when
she was 11, her first synthesizer as
a seventh-grader. She was nearly
given a recording contract at the ripe old
age of 15.
Why, then, is she at Stanford, com
pleting a degree in drama, instead of din
ing at Spago with big-shot producers?
"Initially, I didn't have much faith I
would stay," she says recently. "But when I
came here, I did a complete 180." Whereas
Sage's precocious creative energy was ear

lier directed at writing "real pop music —
Debbie Gibson stuff," her arrival at college
was marked by a broadening of intellectu
al and artistic awareness.
"I came here and discovered acoustic,
folk, CoHo kind of music," Sage says. "My
emphasis shifted to lyrics.. . I started to
listen to the Indigo Girls, Elvis Costello —
people who tell stories a lot more than just
sing words that sound good together. And
I started to write that kind of music
more."
Sage's growing sense of the poetic
possibilities for her music was further
heightened by her trip to Ireland two
summers ago, an excursion originally
intended as an electronic music-based
project. But instead of MIDI computers
and drum machines, she became intoxi
cated with the Irish folk tradition.
"In Ireland I found so much music to
be inspired by — Irish music has a real

lyrical honesty, a lyrical and melodic
emphasis that is lacking from the
American music scene," she says. "[Being
in Ireland] gave me a more firm idea of
what kind of music I wanted to do."
While she reconsidered her musical
foundations, Sage discovered personal
avenues through which her songs could
travel. "When I was young, I didn't have
much of an idea of what 'women's music'
and its subject matter was," she says. "But
my involvement with the Women's Center
Collective (and other female organiza
tions) definitely informed a lot of my
songs."
Sage's musical and lyrical visions con
verged on her recently produced five-song
demo tape, one half a CD she hopes to
finish this summer. Sage's sound combines
warm, affecting melodies with intricate,
poignant stories of love and pain.
The tape opens with the evocative
lyrics of "Rain So Hard," approaching love
from the perspective of a prostitute:
"When I was warm and heaven-blessed I
blew apart my Sunday dress/ It fell like
mud onto the clouds and a deafened plan
et earth with sounds of sorrow and holy
bliss." On the tongue-in-cheek
"Gravedancing," Sage sings "I will set fire
to him, he who isn't human/1 will dance
upon the grave of his impersonality."
Echoes of Sage's musical influences
resound through the five songs. Sage's
pure soprano and combination of acoustic
guitar with synthesized sound recalls Tori
Amos and Kate Bush, while the Celtic feel
and plaintive words of "Begin To Stop"
nod to Van Morrison. The hopeful "Land
of Plenty" contains all the well-crafted
pop sensibilities of a song like the Indigos'
"Galileo."
Although Sage still relies heavily on
arrangement-heavy "production" — the
use of keyboards, synthesizers and drum
machines — she says her "goal is less to
highlight that equipment, and try to make
the music as live, as acoustic as possible."
Indeed, Sage has started to prefer her
music live, normally with only guitar
accompaniment, and admits that live per
formance "has become addictive. It can be

really therapeutic — you put a lot on dis
play when you're on a stage."
But finding a place on campus to
reach a large audience, aside from the
Coffee House, has been difficult. "The No.
1 problem for original musicians has to do
with the lack of venues, organization and
ability of students to have access to
venues," Sage says.
"If your music doesn't have a dance
beat, and can't be played at a party, you
won't have as many opportunities as a
cover band," she says. Still, Sage maintains
that she has received plenty of positive
response to her music, based on her live
concerts.
This summer, Sage, in between com
pleting her CD and shopping her demo to
record companies, will perform at the
Cottonwood Club in Greenwich Village.
Eventually, she hopes to form a band, con
tinue songwriting and pursue her interest

in musical arrangement for other lively
arts. "I'd like to be someone like Peter
Gabriel or Phillip Glass — someone who
performs their own music, and works with
other artists in dance, theater and film,"
she says.
Ambitious? Perhaps, but Sage is ready.
"It's a 24-hour job," she says of life as a
professional musician. "But I'm perfectly
willing and excited to do it when I get the
chance."
Junior Kwame Yao Anku tells the
story of how last summer, while
shopping for furniture, a homeless
man approached him outside one
store. The man promised to wash
Anku's car windshield for a dollar. Struck
by his ebullience, Anku agreed. As the

man washed the car, Anku observed, his
face bespoke so much enjoyment it was as
if "he were cleaning a Rolls-Royce."
But even as the man laughed and
sang, Anku quickly realized that there was
a sad resignation in the man's joy. "It hit
me — here's a guy who has no home, no
money, which is most people's greatest
fear," he says."For his disposition to be
one of happiness and laughter... it was
the idea that it's the same old shit, that
shit isn't getting any better."
That episode became the context of
"Same Old Song," one of four tracks on


Anku's new demo tape, "A New Day."
And it goes a long way in explaining the
kind of experience that infuses Anku's
artistic vision.
"A lot of times, the realistic picture of
what's happening isn't always pleasur
able," he says. "I'd rather see society for
how it is, rather than pretend problems
don't exist."
Songs on "A New Day" do not shy
away from addressing such ills. The title
track depicts American culture as static
and Orwellian: "I know you've been
searching hard but you'll/ never find the
key if you stay in this paradigm... they
conceal all that's real/ and control every
thing you know."
But while "A New Day" ends with a
message of black empowerment, the
other three songs express a greater sense
of emptiness and desolation. "From the
Other Side" tells a tale of personal and
societal isolation, "Without a Name"
laments over lost love and "Same Old
Song" suggests the pain behind the wind
shield washer's laughter: "When the
church bells ring and/ all the people sing/
you sittin' there all alone/ just singing
your damn song."
"It's not easier to write darker songs,
because they are always very personal,"
Anku says. "As a type of cathartic
process, it's always painful. But once that
experience is out, you feel a sense of
relief, as if you've lost a burden you've
been carrying around."
Anku perceives the "socio-political"
element of his songs as a theme that ties
together his often-eclectic music. "I try
to make my songs colorful," he says. "I'm
very into the idea of themes — if you
give people something they can hang on
to, then you can take them anywhere."
Indeed, Anku's musical whims are as
disparate from song to song as his lyrics
are consistently pointed. On three of the
four songs on "A New Day," Anku han
dles all the instruments, from lead guitar
to drum machine, with bassist Joshua
Loftus backing on "Without a Name"
and "A New Day."
Yet even the moods of these songs

Before ever playing together live, the band

vary. "A New Day" is a straight-ahead
rocker, reminiscent of Living Colour or
even Van Halen. "Without a Name,"
begins as a bluesy, understated ballad,
and rises to an inspired Anku guitar solo.
For "Same Old Song," Anku employs a
relaxed fimk beat behind a simple chord
progression, with guitar hooks and syn
thesizers doodling in the background.
"[The songs' differences] are defi
nitely a consequence of what I like to lis
ten to," Anku says. "I'm bored with any
kind of specific style."
Anku hopes to form a band this sum
mer to record the balance of a full-length
album. The acoustic, pop groove of
"From the Other Side," the only song on
"A New Day" played with a live band,

seems to match Anku's soulful, breathy
vocals well.
He admits that his particular situa
tion is not necessarily applicable to other
aspiring Stanford musicians: Anku's work
has been showcased at campus events
since, as a freshman member of the pop
ular funk band The Seven Principles, he
played before a sold-out Memorial
Auditorium. In addition, he says that as a
black musician playing rock music, he
immediately was accorded a unique
niche. But he does not think an audience
for original music at Stanford is lacking.
"If you give people something different,
they will like it,"he says.
Anku hopes to have his debut album
completed by next winter, when he plans

to perform a multi-media presentation
that "takes everything I've learned acad
emically, and presents it musically and
visually. I want to take complex issues
like the origins of race and racism, and
translate them from the theoretical to a
language that's accessible.
"I want to be a professional musician
and a professional educator," Anku con
tinues. "I can't think of one artist out
there who is doing the things I want to
do, who has an agenda to wake kids up."
But isn't the world of popular music,
no matter how lofty an artist's goals,
risky and unpredictable? "People always
say, 'What's your backup plan?' I think if
you have a backup plan, you're setting
yourself up to fail," Anku says, in a fine
rush. "It's like saying, 'I can swim, but
I'm still going to jump into the pool
with this lifejacket.' If you can swim,
then jump into the pool, and go all out.
Go for gold."

Spinal Tap Studios is tucked
among office buildings and
empty warehouses near Marsh
Road in Menlo Park. On a given
night, the studio's several prac
tice rooms fill up with metal bands, jazz
combos and Michael Jackson sounda
likes. It is from these quaint confines that
Occam's Razor hopes to launch its pro
fessional career.
That the band has made it as far as it
has — a full-length CD already released, a
burgeoning fan base and solid live perfor
mances — is itself a testament to the
group's persistence. It was formed when
Stanford graduates Greg Loos and Jay
Middleton met during a company fire drill
outside Oracle Systems Corporation in
February of 1991. By October of that year,
the two had written 35 songs; by the fol
lowing March, Occam's Razor added
bassist David Wu, another Stanford grad,
37-year-old Dallas drummer Pete Falcone
and sophomore James Nash on lead guitar.
In April, without so much as having
played together live, the group decided to
record an entire album. "It's pretty
unorthodox for a band to immediately go
into the studio — most people develop a
sound and camaraderie first," Loos says.
"The reason we decided to record was
because Jay and I had material ready for a
couple of years, and we were looking to
put it down on tape."
"You can't call yourself a band until
you have a product," says Falcone, who
already had considerable professional
experience before joining Occam's. "Until
you have something to show, it's hard to
define yourself." And so it was that

April 1, 1992 and emerged 17 days later
with an 11-song album — a little harried
but wiser for the wear.
It's hard to know what to make of the
album. "Occam's Razor" has the requisite
guitar-rock melodiousness of most col
lege-band recordings, but aside from
Nash's virtuosic guitar licks and
Middleton's airy voice, a definitive musical
"sound" is missing from the work.
And yet the strength of Loos and
Middleton's songwriting is hard to repress
— or ignore. Lyrically, the songs are hon
est and searching: on the brooding, Pink
Floyd-like "Darkness," Middleton croons,
"Passion was the root of our creation/ But
once it's gone you can never replace it."
Meanwhile, a folksy warmth emerges
from the album's best songs, especially
"Air," and the undeniably sweet ballad
"Ghost of Love."
Perhaps it was inevitable, though, that
the maturity of the duos' songwriting
would spawn cynical, even depressing
lyrics. "For myself, I had a lot more dark
thoughts (when the songs were com
posed)," Middleton says."I was right out
of college, I didn't have any direction, and
I felt kind of 105t... let's face it, it's a dark
world."
"I Wanna Be Free" suggests such a
thrown-into-the-workplace disillusion
ment: "The shiny gleam of corporate
smiles, give the illusion of security all the
while." Even the ostensibly romantic
"Ghost of Love" is a heartbreaker:

Middleton confesses, "When you're
around me, your love surrounds me,"
though regretting that "she told me that
she'd love to stay, but my baby's gone
away."
Nash maintains that the mood con
veyed by a certain song "depends on what
happens in that moment. We keep throw
ing new stuff out, giving new approaches

to the same old songs."
With one album behind them,
Occam's Razor has taken to the local club
scene. Not long after their successful
Coffee House performance, the band
played to a receptive audience at the
Cabaret, a much larger San Jose arena.
"We want to start a buzz, because
once you do, the word spreads like wild
fire," Loos says. Finding that base of sup
port on campus, for Occam's Razor, has
been difficult. Though their CD is avail
able at the Bookstore, few students are all
that familiar with the band. Part of the
difficulty is that Occam's Razor is not
wont to appear at say, Sigma Chi on a
Friday night.
"The music scene at Stanford is not
much different from the music scene in
high school," Nash says. "People at a party
don't want to hear music they don't know,
and original music requires an audience."
Still, as the Coffee House perfor
mance evinced, Occam's Razor has rea
son to be giddy about the future. The
ragged wandering of the album's direc
tion has given way to simpler, straight
forward rock grooves. At a recent
Monday rehearsal, Occam's tore through
three new songs, "Such is All," "Why
Don't You Tell Me?" and "Mr. Moon."
The band displayed its better-honed pop
craftsmanship, with three-part har
monies and Nash's engaging, if more
restrained, guitar hooks calling to mind
mid-'Bos R.E.M.
While it may be presumptuous to
expect Occam's Razor to eventually enjoy
R.E.M.'s mainstream popularity, it won't
be for a lack of trying. "We're going to go
as far as we can go, explore every avenue

t's like saying, 1 can
swim, but I'm still
going to jump into the
pool with this lifejacket/
If you can swim, then
jump into the pool,
and go all out. Go
for gold.

open to us," Wu promises. "And the only
reason we would fail is if the public
doesn't like us."
And so it is for countless other young
artists seeking to strike the delicate bal
ance between embracing the musical tastes
of the listening public, without sacrificing
the integrity of their art.
But Occam's Razor, Kwame Anku and
Rachael Sage all exude a quiet confidence
in their chances, and faith that there is an
audience that will appreciate their respec
tive originality.
As Sage sings on "Land of Plenty": "I
have canvassed America/ Deep in search of
a sacred trust and more,/ And I have real
ized that I cannot homogenize/ Myself to
be like everyone else " ■
