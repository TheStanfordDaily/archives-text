Much Ado About Nothing

Take a stunningly handsome band of
heroic young nobles on charging stallions,
add a host of beautiful, full-chested virgins
and proceed to show the two groups tearing
their clothes off and leaping feverishly into
crystal-dear fountains.
Sound good? So opens Kenneth
Branagh's adaptation of William Shake
speare's comic escapade "Much Ado About
Nothing."
Never seen the play? OK, here's the low
down on the plot: dashing prince has virtu
ous followers. Prince's evil, bastard brother
has scheming followers. Wealthy governor
has a beautiful, virgin daughter. Too good
to be true?
Wait, there's more. Prince's friend falls in
love. Prince's brother vows to ruin it. What
will happen to our Hero — that's the
daughter (played by the scrumptious Kate
Beckinsale) — and her naive suitor Claudio
(prettyboy Robert Sean Leonard)?
Hint: it's a comedy.
And comic dialogue has never been bet
ter — Shakespeare must have been on fire
when he wrote this play. Under Branagh's
direction, the actors deliver their lines
without the pompous overkill so character
istic of Shakespearian stage productions.
The result: a delightful combination of
satire and wit, most obvious in the hilarious
banter between Beatrice (Emma Thomp
son) and Benedick (Branagh). Like kids in
grade school, these two are so nasty to each
other that you know they'll end up togeth
er.
Michael Keaton makes a triumphant re-

turn to the brilliant physical comedy he dis
played in "Beetlejuice." As the boorish con
stable Dogberry, Keaton is a deranged, yet
lovable slob. When he gallops around the
screen on his make-believe horse, you can't
help but laugh yourself into a state of in
jury.
Alas, would that one could vouchsafe
unto all the players such a blithe critique!
Unfortunately, some surprisingly poor
acting and casting creeps into this near
masterpiece. Most unexpectedly is Denzel
Washington's portrayal of Don Pedro,
Prince of Aragon. Washington's delivery
leaves you with the inescapable feeling that
he's reading his lines from a TelePrompTer.
Worse is Keanu Reeves' tepid performance
as Don Pedro's brother Don John — he
simply doesn't fit the role of the villainous
bastard.

The movie redeems itself not only with
the many stronger performances, but also
with its careful attention to detail, reflected
in the costuming, dialogue and production
design. Still, viewers knowledgeable about
medieval musical instruments will note a
faux pas: the use of the six stringed, small
bodied, deep waisted classical guitar of the
early 18th century, instead of the five
coursed Baroque instrument of Shake
speare's day.
Minor faults aside, "Much Ado About
Nothing" is a juggernaut of a comedy. Fast
paced and laughter packed, the film is a
magical trip of jolly good fun and de
bauchery.

Billy's buck-naked
but still can't save
this tired comedy

Three of Hearts

Not even William Baldwin's buttocks
can save "Three of Hearts," a forgettable
film that attempts to entice us with a
story of a lesbian relationship, giving us
new reason to marvel at Hollywood's

ability to conventionalize and cram clich
es into potentially fresh and enlightening
material.
After being dumped by her mousy girl
friend Ellen (Sherilyn Fenn), Connie
(Kelly Lynch), a wild and wooly nurse
who wears leather jackets and bandanas,
befriends one of New York's finest gigo
los, the big-eared Joe Casella (William
Baldwin), who disrobes and dresses with
alarming frequency throughout the film.
Being such a nice gigolo, Joe endeavors
to get Ellen back by romancing her and
then breaking her heart, hoping to drive
her back into Connie's arms.
From that point on, the film begins to
sicken as poor acting and stock plot de
vices rear their ugly heads. Baldwin ex
udes intelligence and some charisma as a

There's only one good
scene: Joe's pimp —
named "Mickey," of course
— interviews a potential
phone-sex operator for his
900 line. "You gotta make
me come," he says, com
pletely serious.

male prostitute, but above all he radiates
boredom; his relationships with both
Connie and Ellen seem indifferent.
However, his smirk-filled, husky
voiced attempts to make rich menopausal
matrons feel beautiful are often laugh
able. Hopefully, that's what the director
intended.
Kelly Lynch looks beautiful and man
ages to say her lines clearly in "Three of
Hearts," which is about all we can say
about her performance. People who lose
keychains show more depth of feeling
than Lynch does in this film, which un
dermines its major premise: Will Connie
get Ellen back? We don't really care.
Sherilyn Fenn — in an amazing con
trast to Connie — plays a nerdy literature
T.A. Ellen's feelings for Connie also seem
tepid at best, but she seems so prissy,
reading cheesy love poems in her class,
that it's hard to believe anyone would
want her.
Stock plot devices whizz by fast and fu
riously in the film. An ugly guy named
"Harvey" wants to pummel Joe for no ap
parent reason. A protective loudmouth
sister of Ellen's constantly gives her un
welcome advice about men. A distraught
Joe runs through dark city streets, trying
desperately to escape his life of prostitu
tion and kinky sex. By this time, we want
to escape the theater ourselves.
There is one good scene: Joe's pimp —
named "Mickey," of course — interviews
a potential phone-sex operator for his
900 line. "You gotta make me come," he
says, with complete seriousness. Tough
test, yes, but the logic is impeccable. Too
bad similarly rigorous standards weren't
applied to the film itself.

Three's company.. .or is It a crowd? In "Three of Hearts," a tale of trl-sexual lust, It's
pretty hard to tell the difference.
