Much Ado About Nothing

Take a stunningly handsome band of
heroic young nobles on charging stallions,
add a host of beautiful, full-chested virgins
and proceed to show the two groups tearing
their clothes off and leaping feverishly into
crystal-dear fountains.
Sound good? So opens Kenneth
Branagh's adaptation of William Shake
speare's comic escapade "Much Ado About
Nothing."
Never seen the play? OK, here's the low
down on the plot: dashing prince has virtu
ous followers. Prince's evil, bastard brother
has scheming followers. Wealthy governor
has a beautiful, virgin daughter. Too good
to be true?
Wait, there's more. Prince's friend falls in
love. Prince's brother vows to ruin it. What
will happen to our Hero — that's the
daughter (played by the scrumptious Kate
Beckinsale) — and her naive suitor Claudio
(prettyboy Robert Sean Leonard)?
Hint: it's a comedy.
And comic dialogue has never been bet
ter — Shakespeare must have been on fire
when he wrote this play. Under Branagh's
direction, the actors deliver their lines
without the pompous overkill so character
istic of Shakespearian stage productions.
The result: a delightful combination of
satire and wit, most obvious in the hilarious
banter between Beatrice (Emma Thomp
son) and Benedick (Branagh). Like kids in
grade school, these two are so nasty to each
other that you know they'll end up togeth

turn to the brilliant physical comedy he dis
played in "Beetlejuice." As the boorish con
stable Dogberry, Keaton is a deranged, yet
lovable slob. When he gallops around the
screen on his make-believe horse, you can't
help but laugh yourself into a state of in
jury.
Alas, would that one could vouchsafe
unto all the players such a blithe critique!
Unfortunately, some surprisingly poor
acting and casting creeps into this near
masterpiece. Most unexpectedly is Denzel
Washington's portrayal of Don Pedro,
Prince of Aragon. Washington's delivery
leaves you with the inescapable feeling that
he's reading his lines from a TelePrompTer.
Worse is Keanu Reeves' tepid performance
as Don Pedro's brother Don John — he
simply doesn't fit the role of the villainous
bastard.

The movie redeems itself not only with
the many stronger performances, but also
with its careful attention to detail, reflected
in the costuming, dialogue and production
design. Still, viewers knowledgeable about
medieval musical instruments will note a
faux pas: the use of the six stringed, small
bodied, deep waisted classical guitar of the
early 18th century, instead of the five
coursed Baroque instrument of Shake
speare's day.
Minor faults aside, "Much Ado About

paced and laughter packed, the film is a
magical trip of jolly good fun and de

Three of Hearts

Not even William Baldwin's buttocks
can save "Three of Hearts," a forgettable
film that attempts to entice us with a
story of a lesbian relationship, giving us
new reason to marvel at Hollywood's

ability to conventionalize and cram clich
es into potentially fresh and enlightening
material.
After being dumped by her mousy girl
friend Ellen (Sherilyn Fenn), Connie
(Kelly Lynch), a wild and wooly nurse
who wears leather jackets and bandanas,
befriends one of New York's finest gigo
los, the big-eared Joe Casella (William
Baldwin), who disrobes and dresses with
alarming frequency throughout the film.
Being such a nice gigolo, Joe endeavors
to get Ellen back by romancing her and
then breaking her heart, hoping to drive
her back into Connie's arms.
From that point on, the film begins to
sicken as poor acting and stock plot de
vices rear their ugly heads. Baldwin ex
udes intelligence and some charisma as a

There's only one good
scene: Joe's pimp —

— interviews a potential

male prostitute, but above all he radiates
boredom; his relationships with both
Connie and Ellen seem indifferent.
However, his smirk-filled, husky
voiced attempts to make rich menopausal
matrons feel beautiful are often laugh
able. Hopefully, that's what the director
intended.
Kelly Lynch looks beautiful and man
ages to say her lines clearly in "Three of
Hearts," which is about all we can say
about her performance. People who lose
keychains show more depth of feeling
than Lynch does in this film, which un
dermines its major premise: Will Connie
get Ellen back? We don't really care.
Sherilyn Fenn — in an amazing con
trast to Connie — plays a nerdy literature
T.A. Ellen's feelings for Connie also seem
tepid at best, but she seems so prissy,
reading cheesy love poems in her class,
that it's hard to believe anyone would
want her.
Stock plot devices whizz by fast and fu
riously in the film. An ugly guy named
"Harvey" wants to pummel Joe for no ap
parent reason. A protective loudmouth
sister of Ellen's constantly gives her un
welcome advice about men. A distraught
Joe runs through dark city streets, trying
desperately to escape his life of prostitu
tion and kinky sex. By this time, we want
to escape the theater ourselves.

Chinese bad boy
Yimou strikes out
with tragicomedy

The Story of Qiu Ju

"The Story of Qiu Ju," acclaimed Chinese
director Zhang Yimou's latest effort, bares a

striking resemblance to the children's story
"The Little Engine that Could."
In this case, the Little Engine is none other
than heroine Qiu Ju (Gong Li), a peasant
woman who is determined to gain justice for
her husband after he has been kicked "be
tween the legs" by the chief of their village.
Qiu Ju departs on a trip into the bureau
cracy of Communist China, appealing each
decision to a higher authority, in hopes of
finding someone who will force the chief to
apologize to her husband. Each consecutive
appeal for justice becomes more elaborate
and difficult for Qiu Ju, a stereotypically
rural peasant who isn't familiar with the de
mands and costs of city life.

While each trip has its humorous mo
ments, the film could clearly be condensed to
increase its appeal. By Qiu Ju's fifth trip, the
mere sight of the road to town elicits a silent
groan of resignation and the hope that this
will be her last appeal. Even though the film
has been labeled a "revenge comedy," the
spurts of humor remain incidental to the
more thought-provoking question of what
constitutes justice.
The few genuine chuckles come from
some incongruous visual images, such as the
decidedly pregnant Qiu Ju balancing on the
back of her sister-in-law's bicycle on an icy
road leading to town, and the constant refer
ences to the impact of her husband's unfor
tunate injury.
All in all, "The Story of Qiu Ju" demon
strates that Zhang would be better off follow
ing his own tradition of serious drama, as in
his previously Academy Award-nominated
films "Raise the Red Lantern" and "Ju Dou."
Qiu Ju definitely provides a refreshing de
parture from the stereotypical quiet, obedi
ent Asian woman — blatantly defying her
husband in her desire to see right done. Any
one who has ever dealt with the IRS or finan
cial-aid forms will appreciate the monumen
tal task Qiu Ju faces and empathize with her
frustration. But in the end, her quest seems
trivial, and definitely not worth the effort.
Perhaps in this case, the Little Engine
would do better to question whether or not
she really wants to climb the mountain.

King's latest flick
is DOA thanks to
hack filmmaking

The Dark Half

"The Dark Half," director George
Romero's screen adaptation of Stephen
King's spooky novel, should have been
called "The Dull Half." Dull acting, dull di
alogue, dull characterization — even the
straight-razor killings are dull, and there's
nothing worse than a dull razor.
Lifted straight from the book, the plot
tells the gruesome tale of writer Thad Beau
mont (Timothy Hutton), a university pro
fessor and an unappreciated novelist who

writes ultra-violent crime novels under the
pseudonym George Stark to pay the bills.
Unfortunately for Beaumont, an extor
tionist discovers his double-identity, and
forces him to go public, "killing off" Stark.
Then things get nasty.
People involved in the revelation of Stark's
real identity start dying in gruesome ways,
generally being slashed to death by a razor,
and all clues point to Beaumont. Of course,
the protagonist can't be guilty, and it turns out
that the pseudonym, the ultra-macho George
Stark, has come to life—and is killing to force
Beaumont to continue writing.
With lots of bodies and little imagina
tion, the film lumbers along toward a cli
max where Stark and Beaumont face off,
knowing only one can survive (which is —
guess who? — Beaumont!). An enormous
flock of sparrows (4,500 finches were used
in filming the movie) — which the audi
ence is told are "psychopomps," birds that
ferry souls to and from Earth and Hades —
waits to dispose of the loser like a giant
suet ball.
King's author-forced-to-write theme
also formed the core of his earlier movie,
"Misery." While "Misery" succeeded with
suspense and well-developed characters,
"The Dark Half" fails on both points. Sel
dom required to show more than one emo
tion, and hampered by flat dialogue (i.e.
"Who knows [how psychopomps work]?"
"Only the almighty, and I think he's on sab
batical"), the actors look as bored as the au
dience.
Romero always manages to destroy any
suspense he has built up, apparently con
cerned that an audience member might get
scared. His favorite tactic is to cut to shots of
Beaumont's infant twins during suspense
scenes to show their imminent danger. Un
fortunately, one baby or the other always gig
gles, as does the audience. Even a scene of a
baby crawling toward a straight razor, which
should be nerve-wracking, is simply silly.
"The Dark Half" does have a few brief
bright spots: Romero's use of light and shad
ow spooks effectively, as does a dream se
quence. The bird effects, too, are generally
realistic.
Overall, though, the silly suspense, som
nambulistic acting and psychopompous
plot lead one to wonder why some clever ed
itor couldn't have taken a razor to the film
and left it — like Stark's victims — on the
cutting-room floor.

The Dark Half

"The Dark Half," director George
Romero's screen adaptation of Stephen
King's spooky novel, should have been
called "The Dull Half." Dull acting, dull di
alogue, dull characterization — even the
straight-razor killings are dull, and there's
nothing worse than a dull razor.
Lifted straight from the book, the plot
tells the gruesome tale of writer Thad Beau
mont (Timothy Hutton), a university pro
fessor and an unappreciated novelist who

writes ultra-violent crime novels under the
pseudonym George Stark to pay the bills.
Unfortunately for Beaumont, an extor
tionist discovers his double-identity, and
forces him to go public, "killing off" Stark.
Then things get nasty.
People involved in the revelation of Stark's
real identity start dying in gruesome ways,
generally being slashed to death by a razor,
and all clues point to Beaumont. Of course,
the protagonist can't be guilty, and it turns out
that the pseudonym, the ultra-macho George
Stark, has come to life—and is killing to force
Beaumont to continue writing.
With lots of bodies and little imagina
tion, the film lumbers along toward a cli
max where Stark and Beaumont face off,
knowing only one can survive (which is —
guess who? — Beaumont!). An enormous
flock of sparrows (4,500 finches were used
in filming the movie) — which the audi
ence is told are "psychopomps," birds that
ferry souls to and from Earth and Hades —
waits to dispose of the loser like a giant
suet ball.
King's author-forced-to-write theme
also formed the core of his earlier movie,
"Misery." While "Misery" succeeded with
suspense and well-developed characters,
"The Dark Half" fails on both points. Sel
dom required to show more than one emo
tion, and hampered by flat dialogue (i.e.
"Who knows [how psychopomps work]?"
"Only the almighty, and I think he's on sab
batical"), the actors look as bored as the au
dience.
Romero always manages to destroy any
suspense he has built up, apparently con
cerned that an audience member might get
scared. His favorite tactic is to cut to shots of
Beaumont's infant twins during suspense
scenes to show their imminent danger. Un
fortunately, one baby or the other always gig
gles, as does the audience. Even a scene of a
baby crawling toward a straight razor, which
should be nerve-wracking, is simply silly.
"The Dark Half" does have a few brief
bright spots: Romero's use of light and shad
ow spooks effectively, as does a dream se
quence. The bird effects, too, are generally
realistic.
Overall, though, the silly suspense, som
nambulistic acting and psychopompous
plot lead one to wonder why some clever ed
itor couldn't have taken a razor to the film
and left it — like Stark's victims — on the
cutting-room floor.

Take a stunningly handsome band of

crystal-dear fountains.
Sound good? So opens Kenneth

Three of Hearts

Not even William Baldwin's buttocks
can save "Three of Hearts," a forgettable
film that attempts to entice us with a
story of a lesbian relationship, giving us
new reason to marvel at Hollywood's

ability to conventionalize and cram clich
es into potentially fresh and enlightening
material.
After being dumped by her mousy girl
friend Ellen (Sherilyn Fenn), Connie
(Kelly Lynch), a wild and wooly nurse
who wears leather jackets and bandanas,
befriends one of New York's finest gigo
los, the big-eared Joe Casella (William
Baldwin), who disrobes and dresses with
alarming frequency throughout the film.
Being such a nice gigolo, Joe endeavors
to get Ellen back by romancing her and
then breaking her heart, hoping to drive
her back into Connie's arms.
From that point on, the film begins to
sicken as poor acting and stock plot de
vices rear their ugly heads. Baldwin ex

male prostitute, but above all he radiates
boredom; his relationships with both
Connie and Ellen seem indifferent.
However, his smirk-filled, husky
voiced attempts to make rich menopausal
matrons feel beautiful are often laugh
able. Hopefully, that's what the director
intended.
Kelly Lynch looks beautiful and man
ages to say her lines clearly in "Three of
Hearts," which is about all we can say
about her performance. People who lose
keychains show more depth of feeling
than Lynch does in this film, which un
dermines its major premise: Will Connie
get Ellen back? We don't really care.
Sherilyn Fenn — in an amazing con
trast to Connie — plays a nerdy literature
T.A. Ellen's feelings for Connie also seem
tepid at best, but she seems so prissy,
reading cheesy love poems in her class,
that it's hard to believe anyone would
want her.
Stock plot devices whizz by fast and fu
riously in the film. An ugly guy named
"Harvey" wants to pummel Joe for no ap
parent reason. A protective loudmouth
sister of Ellen's constantly gives her un
welcome advice about men. A distraught
Joe runs through dark city streets, trying
desperately to escape his life of prostitu
tion and kinky sex. By this time, we want
to escape the theater ourselves.
There is one good scene: Joe's pimp —

a potential phone-sex operator for his

Three's company.. .or is It a crowd? In "Three of Hearts," a tale of trl-sexual lust, It's
pretty hard to tell the difference.
Chinese bad boy
Yimou strikes out
with tragicomedy

The Story of Qiu Ju

"The Story of Qiu Ju," acclaimed Chinese
director Zhang Yimou's latest effort, bares a

striking resemblance to the children's story
"The Little Engine that Could."
In this case, the Little Engine is none other
than heroine Qiu Ju (Gong Li), a peasant
woman who is determined to gain justice for
her husband after he has been kicked "be
tween the legs" by the chief of their village.
Qiu Ju departs on a trip into the bureau
cracy of Communist China, appealing each
decision to a higher authority, in hopes of
finding someone who will force the chief to
apologize to her husband. Each consecutive
appeal for justice becomes more elaborate
and difficult for Qiu Ju, a stereotypically
rural peasant who isn't familiar with the de
mands and costs of city life.

While each trip has its humorous mo
ments, the film could clearly be condensed to
increase its appeal. By Qiu Ju's fifth trip, the
mere sight of the road to town elicits a silent
groan of resignation and the hope that this
will be her last appeal. Even though the film
has been labeled a "revenge comedy," the
spurts of humor remain incidental to the
more thought-provoking question of what
constitutes justice.
The few genuine chuckles come from
some incongruous visual images, such as the
decidedly pregnant Qiu Ju balancing on the
back of her sister-in-law's bicycle on an icy
road leading to town, and the constant refer
ences to the impact of her husband's unfor
tunate injury.
All in all, "The Story of Qiu Ju" demon
strates that Zhang would be better off follow
ing his own tradition of serious drama, as in
his previously Academy Award-nominated
films "Raise the Red Lantern" and "Ju Dou."
Qiu Ju definitely provides a refreshing de
parture from the stereotypical quiet, obedi
ent Asian woman — blatantly defying her
husband in her desire to see right done. Any
one who has ever dealt with the IRS or finan
cial-aid forms will appreciate the monumen

boredom; his relationships with both

However, his smirk-filled, husky

Kelly Lynch looks beautiful and man
ages to say her lines clearly in "Three of
Hearts," which is about all we can say
about her performance. People who lose
keychains show more depth of feeling
than Lynch does in this film, which un
dermines its major premise: Will Connie
get Ellen back? We don't really care.
Sherilyn Fenn — in an amazing con
trast to Connie — plays a nerdy literature
T.A. Ellen's feelings for Connie also seem
tepid at best, but she seems so prissy,
reading cheesy love poems in her class,
that it's hard to believe anyone would
want her.
Stock plot devices whizz by fast and fu
riously in the film. An ugly guy named
"Harvey" wants to pummel Joe for no ap
parent reason. A protective loudmouth
sister of Ellen's constantly gives her un
welcome advice about men. A distraught
Joe runs through dark city streets, trying
desperately to escape his life of prostitu
tion and kinky sex. By this time, we want
to escape the theater ourselves.
There is one good scene: Joe's pimp —
named "Mickey," of course — interviews
a potential phone-sex operator for his
900 line. "You gotta make me come," he
says, with complete seriousness. Tough
test, yes, but the logic is impeccable. Too
bad similarly rigorous standards weren't
applied to the film itself.

Chinese bad boy
Yimou strikes out
with tragicomedy

The Story of Qiu Ju

"The Story of Qiu Ju," acclaimed Chinese
director Zhang Yimou's latest effort, bares a

striking resemblance to the children's story
"The Little Engine that Could."
In this case, the Little Engine is none other
than heroine Qiu Ju (Gong Li), a peasant
woman who is determined to gain justice for
her husband after he has been kicked "be
tween the legs" by the chief of their village.
Qiu Ju departs on a trip into the bureau
cracy of Communist China, appealing each
decision to a higher authority, in hopes of
finding someone who will force the chief to
apologize to her husband. Each consecutive
appeal for justice becomes more elaborate
and difficult for Qiu Ju, a stereotypically
rural peasant who isn't familiar with the de
mands and costs of city life.

While each trip has its humorous mo
ments, the film could clearly be condensed to
increase its appeal. By Qiu Ju's fifth trip, the
mere sight of the road to town elicits a silent
groan of resignation and the hope that this
will be her last appeal. Even though the film
has been labeled a "revenge comedy," the
spurts of humor remain incidental to the
more thought-provoking question of what
constitutes justice.
The few genuine chuckles come from
some incongruous visual images, such as the
decidedly pregnant Qiu Ju balancing on the
back of her sister-in-law's bicycle on an icy
road leading to town, and the constant refer
ences to the impact of her husband's unfor
tunate injury.
All in all, "The Story of Qiu Ju" demon
strates that Zhang would be better off follow
ing his own tradition of serious drama, as in
his previously Academy Award-nominated
films "Raise the Red Lantern" and "Ju Dou."
Qiu Ju definitely provides a refreshing de
parture from the stereotypical quiet, obedi
ent Asian woman — blatantly defying her
husband in her desire to see right done. Any
one who has ever dealt with the IRS or finan
cial-aid forms will appreciate the monumen
tal task Qiu Ju faces and empathize with her
frustration. But in the end, her quest seems
trivial, and definitely not worth the effort.
Perhaps in this case, the Little Engine
would do better to question whether or not
she really wants to climb the mountain.

King's latest flick
is DOA thanks to
hack filmmaking

The Dark Half

"The Dark Half," director George
Romero's screen adaptation of Stephen
King's spooky novel, should have been
called "The Dull Half." Dull acting, dull di
alogue, dull characterization — even the
straight-razor killings are dull, and there's
nothing worse than a dull razor.
Lifted straight from the book, the plot
tells the gruesome tale of writer Thad Beau
mont (Timothy Hutton), a university pro
fessor and an unappreciated novelist who

writes ultra-violent crime novels under the
pseudonym George Stark to pay the bills.
Unfortunately for Beaumont, an extor
tionist discovers his double-identity, and
forces him to go public, "killing off" Stark.
Then things get nasty.
People involved in the revelation of Stark's
real identity start dying in gruesome ways,
generally being slashed to death by a razor,
and all clues point to Beaumont. Of course,
the protagonist can't be guilty, and it turns out
that the pseudonym, the ultra-macho George
Stark, has come to life—and is killing to force
Beaumont to continue writing.
With lots of bodies and little imagina
tion, the film lumbers along toward a cli
max where Stark and Beaumont face off,
knowing only one can survive (which is —
guess who? — Beaumont!). An enormous
flock of sparrows (4,500 finches were used
in filming the movie) — which the audi
ence is told are "psychopomps," birds that
ferry souls to and from Earth and Hades —
waits to dispose of the loser like a giant
suet ball.
King's author-forced-to-write theme
also formed the core of his earlier movie,
"Misery." While "Misery" succeeded with
suspense and well-developed characters,
"The Dark Half" fails on both points. Sel
dom required to show more than one emo
tion, and hampered by flat dialogue (i.e.
"Who knows [how psychopomps work]?"
"Only the almighty, and I think he's on sab
batical"), the actors look as bored as the au
dience.
Romero always manages to destroy any
suspense he has built up, apparently con
cerned that an audience member might get
scared. His favorite tactic is to cut to shots of
Beaumont's infant twins during suspense
scenes to show their imminent danger. Un
fortunately, one baby or the other always gig
gles, as does the audience. Even a scene of a
baby crawling toward a straight razor, which
should be nerve-wracking, is simply silly.
"The Dark Half" does have a few brief
bright spots: Romero's use of light and shad
ow spooks effectively, as does a dream se
quence. The bird effects, too, are generally
realistic.
Overall, though, the silly suspense, som
nambulistic acting and psychopompous
plot lead one to wonder why some clever ed
itor couldn't have taken a razor to the film
and left it — like Stark's victims — on the
cutting-room floor.
