Hip-hop's biggest
phenom 'unplugs'
but keeps funky

Arrested Development

Somebody really digs overkill. At least
that's what the 18 tracks of "Arrested Devel
opment Unplugged" suggest. But that
doesn't keep the MTV-produced album
from being a better-than-average listening
experience. What's more, it captures the dy
namism of the A.D. sound better than the
studio produced "3 Years, 5 Months & 2
Days In the Life 0f..."
The same numbers — "Give A Man A
Fish," "Fishin' 4 Religion" and "Mama's Al

ways On Stage" — that sound pretty good
fresh from the studio, kick with tremendous
force and integrity when unplugged. This
gives the group's "dedication" to uniting the
loose ends of the African-American musical
diaspora (hip-hop, jazz, blues, etc.) a valid
ity that often falters on the '92 debut.
We can thank the "Extended Family
Band," directed by Kundalini Mark Batson,
for the improvements. The ensemble, an as
sortment of standard (piano, acoustic bass,
drums and guitar) and not-so-standard
("Quaker Oats Horn," "Box of Grits" and
"Hose Horn") instruments, lay down tight
R & B covers that bag the flavor of the Ar
rested originals without being overtly exces
sive.
The "Extended Family Band," however,
stays where a back-up group ought to: in the
background. At the heart of the recording
are Speech's skat-influenced rhymes, Head

liner's "turntable instrumental," the
Arethaesque vocals of Aerie Taree, Montshu
Eshe and Nadriah Ali, Rasa Don's percussive
skill and Baba Oje's spiritual advice. And
they handle this key position with verve.
But what steers the recording away from
the norm is the spontaneity of the live
recording. Aside from making us feel as if
we've got the best seat in the house, the
group's sincerity suggests they'd put as
much energy into a concert at a sold-out
arena as they would into a jam at a club the
size of a Lagunita single with an audience of
one.
Unfortunately, this also explains why the
last seven tracks of "Arrested Development
Unplugged" — the live recordings we've al
ready heard, minus the vocals — are so dis
appointing: they don't go any place we
haven't already visited. The average Sue or
Greg is hip enough to realize that the con
cert recording concludes with track 11. It's a
pity that Arrested Development, MTV and
EMI didn't.

One-hit-wonders L.A.
Style have the ravers
dancing, but that's it

L.A. Style

L.A. Style isn't Even when their big sin
gle, "James Brown Is Dead" started cutting up
club doors across the United States more than
a year ago, L.A. raves were already splitting be
tween the House sets of deejays like Doc Mar
tin and Steve Loria, and the Hardcore sets of
people like Ron D. Core.
The hard techno of L.A. Style kind of fell
through the cracks, being more popular on
modern-rock radio stations like Live 105 and at
venues like the Edge, than with people fre
quenting real raves. But like Quadrophonia's
"Wave Of The Future," "James Brown Is Dead"
went a long way in pulling people previously
unfamiliar with the range and quality of house
music into an enjoyment of the whole spec
trum.
Just to clarify the difference: house music
tends to be around 120 beats per minute, with
a consistent four beats to the measure. It began
with deejays spinning old R & B cuts over the
techno-pop beats of Kraftwerk, and ever since
house artists have continued to try to bridge the
the space between hardware and soul. Hard
core, however, spans the 145 to 180 and up
BPM range and sounds like someone playing
the flamenco on your head with a ball-peen
hammer.
Hard techno is one of the styles spanning the
BPMs in between. It uses repetitive, almost
grungy electronic sounds and keeps the drums
pounding hard. From this hybrid comes L.A.
Style.
If you're interested in House, don't buy this
album. Take the money, buy a round trip Cal-
Train ticket or a full tank of gas up to San Fran
cisco and visit either BPM or Star Music. Ask a
bunch of questions, listen to the store deejays,
bring some headphones and start diving
through the crates.
Many of L.A. Style's tracks would be pass
able — the types of songs really good deejays
can take a strong 24 bars from and mix them
into a three-turntable collage. But on the
whole, L.A. Style fumbles, plagued by such an
noyances as a grating rapper who keeps coming
in songs with a Pro-Gainer™, testosteroned
voice saying witty things like "L.A. Style: In
your face!"
Not that rapping and techno are incompati
ble, and not that every rapper must have the tal
ent and wit of someone like Funkdoobiest, but
if you're going to bring in someone on lyrics, at
least take the time to write something worth the
effects-box they're looped through.
L.A. Style is adolescent pecking-order
music, music to play Street Fighter II to.
Although, having just been an adolescent, I
have to admit a certain liking for the track "Bal
loony," but only because it is a particularly ac
curate musical depiction of the effects of ni
trous-oxide, obtainable legally as whipped
cream at many of the finer grocers across the
United States, in case you want to play along.
Ultimately, what saves L.A. Style from being
a complete waste of time and petroleum by
products is that they have a CD out and I don't.
They're making people dance, and doing it

with a sense of humor, even if they're just more
one-hit wonders, arm-chair musicians and
artists with big toys.

P.J. Harvey assaults
sexism and machismo
with punk sensibilities

P.J. Harvey

Hell hath no fury like the new Polly Jean
Harvey. In her debut album of last year,
"Dry," Harvey begged her lover to stay saying,
"You can love her/You can love me at the
same time." Since then, she's grown stronger,
and, now, she'll be damned if she's reduced to
sharing her lover. "You're not rid of me/I'll
make you lick my injuries," she threatens.
Her latest album "Rid of Me," featuring
her band PJ Harvey, explores gender rela
tions. Not content to simply portray the fe
male point of view, Harvey appropriates
male stereotypes and tries them on for size in
"50Ft Queenie." Here, she's a male rock star
bragging about her cock size. "You come and
measure me," she boasts. "I'm 20 inches
long."
Getting hurt by relationships leaves men

tal scars, and Harvey constantly conjures up
blood imagery to signify the emotional dam
age. In "Me-Janeshe plays Jane to her seem
ingly dim-witted Tarzan of a boyfriend — as
she bleeds, he's totally oblivious to her pain.
"Can't you stop your fuckin' screaming!" she
yells to the tree-swinging idiot.
In the title track, Harvey sings softly ask
ing her lover to come back until she erupts in
rage, her words flowing in an angry torrent.
No more begging for this woman.

To any man who has ever
felt threatened by the
power of a woman, Polly
Jean is his worst fear come
to life — she'll leave him
quivering in his grungy
boots.

The band bases its sound on the minimal
ism of folk music, then explodes with the
mad energy of punk. They use just three
pieces — a guitar, bass and drums — and
bash the hell out of them, making as much
noise as they can.
Harvey's vocal range takes rollercoaster

rides from low whispers to furious screaming
— conveying a range of feeling from sorrow
to fiery anger — in a confession of emotions
that scorch and burn the ears. She easily
matches Sinead O'Connor or Patti Smith in
emotional intensity.
But by no means should Harvey only be
compared to female artists. Her loud guitar
proves that she's well-equipped to play with
the big boys. She aggressively tackles Bob
Dylan's "Highway 61," infusing it with all the
energy she can possibly muster.
To any man who has ever felt threatened
by the power of a woman, Polly Jean is his
worst fear come to life — she'll leave him
quivering in his grungy boots. For women,
she represents an invigorating force that
brings validity to the female power. Hear her
roar.
— Daphne Kwong

There is nothing
to fear but a band
ditching its roots

The Kinks

The Kinks' best-known songs, like "Lola"
and"The Stars on Hollywood Boulevard,"
remain timeless by utilizing a mildly synco
pated guitar-percussion medley and a lilting
melody from lead-singer Ray Davies. Their
new album, "Phobia," has only a few scat
tered songs with this sound, which works
much better than does the grittier material
making up the rest of the album.
Of the 16 tracks comprising the 72-
minute disc, fewer than half are in familiar
Kinks style. The others possess a much heav
ier, bass-driven beat and much harsher gui
tars and vocals. Some, such as the apocalyp
tic "Wall of Fire" and the title track, have
heavy-metal strains to them, while others —
"Drift Away", "Hatred (A Duet)" — sound
more like watered-down Clash out-takes.
Thematically, the song "Surviving" offers
a synopsis for much of the album: "Look at us
here today/Lots of talking with nothing to
say/And if I seem somewhat vague/It's be
cause I'm somewhat afraid."
Unfortunately, many of the songs' mes
sages are all too hazy, going on about various
forms of anguish complemented by volumes
of flat, ambiguous, disjointed images of
modern city life. Keeping your attention span
up for the entirety of the album's lengthy
songs generally goes unrewarded — and by
the third-to-last track, it's difficult to care
overly about the details surrounding, the im
plications of, or the metaphorical value be
hind the fact that "Somebody Stole My Car."
Songs that do act cohesively either tell a
story ("Only a Dream," "Don't") or admit to
a sense of confusion ("Still Searching," "The
Informer") without forcing a painful
demonstration of it. These tracks also con
tain more acoustic parts, harmony from the
band and melodic vocals from Davies.
On one song that works, "The Informer,"
Dave Davies backs up his brother on a tender
ballad about a meeting between separated
lovers. Acoustic lead guitar and unobtrusive
keyboards form a sympathetic backdrop for
the emotional stand.

Arm-chair musicians L.A. Style may have hit the charts with "James Brown is Dead," but
the techno-band soon may be flipping hamburgers in a neighborhood near you.
Unlike the majority of "Phobia," the
emotion on this track seems genuine and
honest. Honesty is what gives it the feel of
the Kinks' classic songs, an honesty the rest
of the album could use.

Raging rap icon
might be melting
in media spotlight

Ice-T

WARNING: If you are a right-wing
extremist or a feminazi, stop reading this
review.
Unfortunately, hardcore hip-hoppers
also need to keep their 15 bones in their
pockets and come out with their Maxells™
if they want to listen to Ice-T's latest album.
This pimp, actor, gang-banger, teenage
father, Stanford speaker and MC comes
back on "Home Invasion" with surprisingly
punk-ass gangsta-rap, influenced by his
ghetto-bastard upbringing in South Central
LA.
Ice backs up his urban folk tales with hard
edged bass and lead guitars, forcefully por
traying the anger of an inner-city lifer who's
trying to "invade" the minds of white subur
ban teens with hip-hop counter-culture.

But the innovation and growth we'd
expect from one of raps seminal figures is
severely lacking. This release sounds too
raw and rushed — almost as if Ice were
freestyling non-stop in the studio.
"Ice M.F. T" showcases this artist's arro

gance, as he attacks the white power struc
ture that tried to shut him up. But his faith
ful underground following doesn't need to
hear how bad he is. They want to hear Ice
lyrically destroy Charlton Heston and
Time-Warner, whom he lets escape without

True hip-hoppers will feel

even a paper cut.
In "G Style," Ice plays the role of a gangsta
in da hood, assuming the mentality that
leads to senseless killings caused by drug
deals, gang power struggles and blighted
inner-city neighborhoods. But any rapper
can spout off about the problems facing
Black America. Ice-T ought to show us more.
The first — and worst — single, "Gotta
Lotta Love," raps about the changing cli
mate of L.A., in which Crips and Bloods all
just get along, Rodney King-style.
Unfortunately, Ice can't muster the irony of
fellow South Central dweller Ice Cube's "It
Was A Good Day." Not only are the rhythm
tracks on this cut weak as hell, but Ice sells
out with a dream of the ghetto that's
straight out of a white liberal fantasy.
This disappointing album has no direc
tion, no unity and only a few decent cuts.
True hip-hoppers will feel robbed. But shel
tered white kids can joyfully go slumming
in stereo with those black people they never
see in suburbia. Ice made a wise choice to
promote Body Count's upcoming CD on
the inside cover — he must have known this
was a pathetic effort.

tween the House sets of deejays like Doc Mar
tin and Steve Loria, and the Hardcore sets of
people like Ron D. Core.
The hard techno of L.A. Style kind of fell
through the cracks, being more popular on
modern-rock radio stations like Live 105 and at
venues like the Edge, than with people fre
quenting real raves. But like Quadrophonia's
"Wave Of The Future," "James Brown Is Dead"
went a long way in pulling people previously
unfamiliar with the range and quality of house
music into an enjoyment of the whole spec
trum.
Just to clarify the difference: house music
tends to be around 120 beats per minute, with
a consistent four beats to the measure. It began
with deejays spinning old R & B cuts over the
techno-pop beats of Kraftwerk, and ever since
house artists have continued to try to bridge the
the space between hardware and soul. Hard
core, however, spans the 145 to 180 and up
BPM range and sounds like someone playing
the flamenco on your head with a ball-peen
hammer.
Hard techno is one of the styles spanning the
BPMs in between. It uses repetitive, almost
grungy electronic sounds and keeps the drums
pounding hard. From this hybrid comes L.A.
Style.
If you're interested in House, don't buy this
album. Take the money, buy a round trip Cal-
Train ticket or a full tank of gas up to San Fran
cisco and visit either BPM or Star Music. Ask a
bunch of questions, listen to the store deejays,
bring some headphones and start diving
through the crates.
Many of L.A. Style's tracks would be pass
able — the types of songs really good deejays
can take a strong 24 bars from and mix them
into a three-turntable collage. But on the
whole, L.A. Style fumbles, plagued by such an
noyances as a grating rapper who keeps coming
in songs with a Pro-Gainer™, testosteroned
voice saying witty things like "L.A. Style: In
your face!"
Not that rapping and techno are incompati
ble, and not that every rapper must have the tal
ent and wit of someone like Funkdoobiest, but
if you're going to bring in someone on lyrics, at
least take the time to write something worth the
effects-box they're looped through.
L.A. Style is adolescent pecking-order
music, music to play Street Fighter II to.
Although, having just been an adolescent, I
have to admit a certain liking for the track "Bal
loony," but only because it is a particularly ac
curate musical depiction of the effects of ni
trous-oxide, obtainable legally as whipped
cream at many of the finer grocers across the
United States, in case you want to play along.
Ultimately, what saves L.A. Style from being
a complete waste of time and petroleum by
products is that they have a CD out and I don't.
They're making people dance, and doing it

with a sense of humor, even if they're just more
one-hit wonders, arm-chair musicians and
artists with big toys.

P.J. Harvey assaults
sexism and machismo
with punk sensibilities

P.J. Harvey

Hell hath no fury like the new Polly Jean
Harvey. In her debut album of last year,
"Dry," Harvey begged her lover to stay saying,
"You can love her/You can love me at the
same time." Since then, she's grown stronger,
and, now, she'll be damned if she's reduced to
sharing her lover. "You're not rid of me/I'll
make you lick my injuries," she threatens.
Her latest album "Rid of Me," featuring
her band PJ Harvey, explores gender rela
tions. Not content to simply portray the fe
male point of view, Harvey appropriates
male stereotypes and tries them on for size in
"50Ft Queenie." Here, she's a male rock star
bragging about her cock size. "You come and
measure me," she boasts. "I'm 20 inches
long."
Getting hurt by relationships leaves men

tal scars, and Harvey constantly conjures up
blood imagery to signify the emotional dam
age. In "Me-Janeshe plays Jane to her seem
ingly dim-witted Tarzan of a boyfriend — as
she bleeds, he's totally oblivious to her pain.
"Can't you stop your fuckin' screaming!" she
yells to the tree-swinging idiot.
In the title track, Harvey sings softly ask
ing her lover to come back until she erupts in
rage, her words flowing in an angry torrent.
No more begging for this woman.

To any man who has ever
felt threatened by the
power of a woman, Polly
Jean is his worst fear come
to life — she'll leave him
quivering in his grungy
boots.

The band bases its sound on the minimal
ism of folk music, then explodes with the
mad energy of punk. They use just three
pieces — a guitar, bass and drums — and
bash the hell out of them, making as much
noise as they can.
Harvey's vocal range takes rollercoaster

rides from low whispers to furious screaming
— conveying a range of feeling from sorrow
to fiery anger — in a confession of emotions
that scorch and burn the ears. She easily
matches Sinead O'Connor or Patti Smith in
emotional intensity.
But by no means should Harvey only be
compared to female artists. Her loud guitar
proves that she's well-equipped to play with
the big boys. She aggressively tackles Bob
Dylan's "Highway 61," infusing it with all the
energy she can possibly muster.
To any man who has ever felt threatened
by the power of a woman, Polly Jean is his
worst fear come to life — she'll leave him
quivering in his grungy boots. For women,
she represents an invigorating force that
brings validity to the female power. Hear her
roar.
— Daphne Kwong

There is nothing
to fear but a band
ditching its roots

The Kinks

The Kinks' best-known songs, like "Lola"
and"The Stars on Hollywood Boulevard,"
remain timeless by utilizing a mildly synco
pated guitar-percussion medley and a lilting
melody from lead-singer Ray Davies. Their
new album, "Phobia," has only a few scat
tered songs with this sound, which works
much better than does the grittier material
making up the rest of the album.
Of the 16 tracks comprising the 72-
minute disc, fewer than half are in familiar
Kinks style. The others possess a much heav
ier, bass-driven beat and much harsher gui
tars and vocals. Some, such as the apocalyp
tic "Wall of Fire" and the title track, have
heavy-metal strains to them, while others —
"Drift Away", "Hatred (A Duet)" — sound
more like watered-down Clash out-takes.
Thematically, the song "Surviving" offers
a synopsis for much of the album: "Look at us
here today/Lots of talking with nothing to
say/And if I seem somewhat vague/It's be
cause I'm somewhat afraid."
Unfortunately, many of the songs' mes
sages are all too hazy, going on about various
forms of anguish complemented by volumes
of flat, ambiguous, disjointed images of
modern city life. Keeping your attention span
up for the entirety of the album's lengthy
songs generally goes unrewarded — and by
the third-to-last track, it's difficult to care
overly about the details surrounding, the im
plications of, or the metaphorical value be
hind the fact that "Somebody Stole My Car."
Songs that do act cohesively either tell a
story ("Only a Dream," "Don't") or admit to
a sense of confusion ("Still Searching," "The
Informer") without forcing a painful
demonstration of it. These tracks also con
tain more acoustic parts, harmony from the
band and melodic vocals from Davies.
On one song that works, "The Informer,"
Dave Davies backs up his brother on a tender
ballad about a meeting between separated
lovers. Acoustic lead guitar and unobtrusive
keyboards form a sympathetic backdrop for
the emotional stand.

Arm-chair musicians L.A. Style may have hit the charts with "James Brown is Dead," but
the techno-band soon may be flipping hamburgers in a neighborhood near you.
Unlike the majority of "Phobia," the
emotion on this track seems genuine and
honest. Honesty is what gives it the feel of
the Kinks' classic songs, an honesty the rest
of the album could use.

Raging rap icon

Ice-T

WARNING: If you are a right-wing
extremist or a feminazi, stop reading this
review.
Unfortunately, hardcore hip-hoppers
also need to keep their 15 bones in their
pockets and come out with their Maxells™
if they want to listen to Ice-T's latest album.
This pimp, actor, gang-banger, teenage
father, Stanford speaker and MC comes
back on "Home Invasion" with surprisingly
punk-ass gangsta-rap, influenced by his
ghetto-bastard upbringing in South Central
LA.
Ice backs up his urban folk tales with hard
edged bass and lead guitars, forcefully por
traying the anger of an inner-city lifer who's
trying to "invade" the minds of white subur
ban teens with hip-hop counter-culture.

But the innovation and growth we'd
expect from one of raps seminal figures is
severely lacking. This release sounds too
raw and rushed — almost as if Ice were
freestyling non-stop in the studio.
"Ice M.F. T" showcases this artist's arro

gance, as he attacks the white power struc
ture that tried to shut him up. But his faith
ful underground following doesn't need to
hear how bad he is. They want to hear Ice

even a paper cut.
In "G Style," Ice plays the role of a gangsta
in da hood, assuming the mentality that
leads to senseless killings caused by drug
deals, gang power struggles and blighted
inner-city neighborhoods. But any rapper
can spout off about the problems facing
Black America. Ice-T ought to show us more.
The first — and worst — single, "Gotta
Lotta Love," raps about the changing cli
mate of L.A., in which Crips and Bloods all
just get along, Rodney King-style.
Unfortunately, Ice can't muster the irony of
fellow South Central dweller Ice Cube's "It
Was A Good Day." Not only are the rhythm
tracks on this cut weak as hell, but Ice sells
out with a dream of the ghetto that's
straight out of a white liberal fantasy.
This disappointing album has no direc
tion, no unity and only a few decent cuts.
True hip-hoppers will feel robbed. But shel

Controversial rapper and rocker Ice-T prepares to invade the minds of white subur

Hip-hop's biggest
phenom 'unplugs'
but keeps funky

Arrested Development

Somebody really digs overkill. At least
that's what the 18 tracks of "Arrested Devel
opment Unplugged" suggest. But that
doesn't keep the MTV-produced album
from being a better-than-average listening
experience. What's more, it captures the dy
namism of the A.D. sound better than the
studio produced "3 Years, 5 Months & 2
Days In the Life 0f..."
The same numbers — "Give A Man A
Fish," "Fishin' 4 Religion" and "Mama's Al

ways On Stage" — that sound pretty good
fresh from the studio, kick with tremendous
force and integrity when unplugged. This
gives the group's "dedication" to uniting the
loose ends of the African-American musical
diaspora (hip-hop, jazz, blues, etc.) a valid
ity that often falters on the '92 debut.
We can thank the "Extended Family
Band," directed by Kundalini Mark Batson,
for the improvements. The ensemble, an as
sortment of standard (piano, acoustic bass,
drums and guitar) and not-so-standard
("Quaker Oats Horn," "Box of Grits" and
"Hose Horn") instruments, lay down tight
R & B covers that bag the flavor of the Ar
rested originals without being overtly exces
sive.
The "Extended Family Band," however,
stays where a back-up group ought to: in the
background. At the heart of the recording
are Speech's skat-influenced rhymes, Head

liner's "turntable instrumental," the
Arethaesque vocals of Aerie Taree, Montshu
Eshe and Nadriah Ali, Rasa Don's percussive
skill and Baba Oje's spiritual advice. And
they handle this key position with verve.
But what steers the recording away from
the norm is the spontaneity of the live
recording. Aside from making us feel as if
we've got the best seat in the house, the
group's sincerity suggests they'd put as
much energy into a concert at a sold-out
arena as they would into a jam at a club the
size of a Lagunita single with an audience of
one.
Unfortunately, this also explains why the
last seven tracks of "Arrested Development
Unplugged" — the live recordings we've al
ready heard, minus the vocals — are so dis
appointing: they don't go any place we
haven't already visited. The average Sue or
Greg is hip enough to realize that the con
cert recording concludes with track 11. It's a
pity that Arrested Development, MTV and
EMI didn't.

P.J. Harvey assaults
sexism and machismo
with punk sensibilities

P.J. Harvey

Hell hath no fury like the new Polly Jean
Harvey. In her debut album of last year,
"Dry," Harvey begged her lover to stay saying,
"You can love her/You can love me at the
same time." Since then, she's grown stronger,
and, now, she'll be damned if she's reduced to
sharing her lover. "You're not rid of me/I'll
make you lick my injuries," she threatens.
Her latest album "Rid of Me," featuring
her band PJ Harvey, explores gender rela
tions. Not content to simply portray the fe
male point of view, Harvey appropriates
male stereotypes and tries them on for size in
"50Ft Queenie." Here, she's a male rock star
bragging about her cock size. "You come and
measure me," she boasts. "I'm 20 inches
long."
Getting hurt by relationships leaves men

tal scars, and Harvey constantly conjures up
blood imagery to signify the emotional dam
age. In "Me-Janeshe plays Jane to her seem
ingly dim-witted Tarzan of a boyfriend — as
she bleeds, he's totally oblivious to her pain.
"Can't you stop your fuckin' screaming!" she
yells to the tree-swinging idiot.
In the title track, Harvey sings softly ask
ing her lover to come back until she erupts in
rage, her words flowing in an angry torrent.
No more begging for this woman.

To any man who has ever
felt threatened by the
power of a woman, Polly
Jean is his worst fear come
to life — she'll leave him
quivering in his grungy
boots.

The band bases its sound on the minimal
ism of folk music, then explodes with the
mad energy of punk. They use just three
pieces — a guitar, bass and drums — and
bash the hell out of them, making as much
noise as they can.
Harvey's vocal range takes rollercoaster

rides from low whispers to furious screaming
— conveying a range of feeling from sorrow
to fiery anger — in a confession of emotions
that scorch and burn the ears. She easily
matches Sinead O'Connor or Patti Smith in
emotional intensity.
But by no means should Harvey only be
compared to female artists. Her loud guitar
proves that she's well-equipped to play with
the big boys. She aggressively tackles Bob
Dylan's "Highway 61," infusing it with all the
energy she can possibly muster.
To any man who has ever felt threatened
by the power of a woman, Polly Jean is his
worst fear come to life — she'll leave him
quivering in his grungy boots. For women,
she represents an invigorating force that
brings validity to the female power. Hear her
roar.

There is nothing
to fear but a band
ditching its roots

The Kinks

The Kinks' best-known songs, like "Lola"
and"The Stars on Hollywood Boulevard,"
remain timeless by utilizing a mildly synco
pated guitar-percussion medley and a lilting
melody from lead-singer Ray Davies. Their
new album, "Phobia," has only a few scat
tered songs with this sound, which works
much better than does the grittier material
making up the rest of the album.
Of the 16 tracks comprising the 72-
minute disc, fewer than half are in familiar
Kinks style. The others possess a much heav
ier, bass-driven beat and much harsher gui
tars and vocals. Some, such as the apocalyp
tic "Wall of Fire" and the title track, have
heavy-metal strains to them, while others —
"Drift Away", "Hatred (A Duet)" — sound
more like watered-down Clash out-takes.
Thematically, the song "Surviving" offers
a synopsis for much of the album: "Look at us
here today/Lots of talking with nothing to
say/And if I seem somewhat vague/It's be
cause I'm somewhat afraid."
Unfortunately, many of the songs' mes
sages are all too hazy, going on about various
forms of anguish complemented by volumes
of flat, ambiguous, disjointed images of
modern city life. Keeping your attention span
up for the entirety of the album's lengthy
songs generally goes unrewarded — and by
the third-to-last track, it's difficult to care
overly about the details surrounding, the im
plications of, or the metaphorical value be
hind the fact that "Somebody Stole My Car."
Songs that do act cohesively either tell a
story ("Only a Dream," "Don't") or admit to
a sense of confusion ("Still Searching," "The
Informer") without forcing a painful
demonstration of it. These tracks also con
tain more acoustic parts, harmony from the
band and melodic vocals from Davies.
On one song that works, "The Informer,"
Dave Davies backs up his brother on a tender
ballad about a meeting between separated
lovers. Acoustic lead guitar and unobtrusive
keyboards form a sympathetic backdrop for
the emotional stand.

Arm-chair musicians L.A. Style may have hit the charts with "James Brown is Dead," but
the techno-band soon may be flipping hamburgers in a neighborhood near you.
Unlike the majority of "Phobia," the
emotion on this track seems genuine and

the Kinks' classic songs, an honesty the rest
of the album could use.

Raging rap icon

in media spotlight

Ice-T

WARNING: If you are a right-wing
extremist or a feminazi, stop reading this
review.
Unfortunately, hardcore hip-hoppers
also need to keep their 15 bones in their
pockets and come out with their Maxells™
if they want to listen to Ice-T's latest album.
This pimp, actor, gang-banger, teenage
father, Stanford speaker and MC comes
back on "Home Invasion" with surprisingly
punk-ass gangsta-rap, influenced by his
ghetto-bastard upbringing in South Central
LA.
Ice backs up his urban folk tales with hard
edged bass and lead guitars, forcefully por
traying the anger of an inner-city lifer who's
trying to "invade" the minds of white subur
ban teens with hip-hop counter-culture.

But the innovation and growth we'd
expect from one of raps seminal figures is
severely lacking. This release sounds too
raw and rushed — almost as if Ice were
freestyling non-stop in the studio.
"Ice M.F. T" showcases this artist's arro

gance, as he attacks the white power struc
ture that tried to shut him up. But his faith
ful underground following doesn't need to
hear how bad he is. They want to hear Ice

Time-Warner, whom he lets escape without

even a paper cut.
In "G Style," Ice plays the role of a gangsta
in da hood, assuming the mentality that
leads to senseless killings caused by drug
deals, gang power struggles and blighted
inner-city neighborhoods. But any rapper
can spout off about the problems facing
Black America. Ice-T ought to show us more.
The first — and worst — single, "Gotta
Lotta Love," raps about the changing cli
mate of L.A., in which Crips and Bloods all
just get along, Rodney King-style.
Unfortunately, Ice can't muster the irony of
fellow South Central dweller Ice Cube's "It
Was A Good Day." Not only are the rhythm
tracks on this cut weak as hell, but Ice sells
out with a dream of the ghetto that's
straight out of a white liberal fantasy.
This disappointing album has no direc
tion, no unity and only a few decent cuts.
True hip-hoppers will feel robbed. But shel

Controversial rapper and rocker Ice-T prepares to invade the minds of white subur
ban children with his new album, "Home Invasion."
Hip-hop's biggest
phenom 'unplugs'
but keeps funky

Arrested Development

Somebody really digs overkill. At least
that's what the 18 tracks of "Arrested Devel
opment Unplugged" suggest. But that
doesn't keep the MTV-produced album
from being a better-than-average listening
experience. What's more, it captures the dy
namism of the A.D. sound better than the
studio produced "3 Years, 5 Months & 2
Days In the Life 0f..."
The same numbers — "Give A Man A
Fish," "Fishin' 4 Religion" and "Mama's Al

ways On Stage" — that sound pretty good
fresh from the studio, kick with tremendous
force and integrity when unplugged. This
gives the group's "dedication" to uniting the
loose ends of the African-American musical
diaspora (hip-hop, jazz, blues, etc.) a valid
ity that often falters on the '92 debut.
We can thank the "Extended Family
Band," directed by Kundalini Mark Batson,
for the improvements. The ensemble, an as
sortment of standard (piano, acoustic bass,
drums and guitar) and not-so-standard
("Quaker Oats Horn," "Box of Grits" and
"Hose Horn") instruments, lay down tight
R & B covers that bag the flavor of the Ar
rested originals without being overtly exces
sive.
The "Extended Family Band," however,
stays where a back-up group ought to: in the
background. At the heart of the recording
are Speech's skat-influenced rhymes, Head

liner's "turntable instrumental," the
Arethaesque vocals of Aerie Taree, Montshu
Eshe and Nadriah Ali, Rasa Don's percussive
skill and Baba Oje's spiritual advice. And
they handle this key position with verve.
But what steers the recording away from
the norm is the spontaneity of the live
recording. Aside from making us feel as if
we've got the best seat in the house, the
group's sincerity suggests they'd put as
much energy into a concert at a sold-out
arena as they would into a jam at a club the
size of a Lagunita single with an audience of
one.
Unfortunately, this also explains why the
last seven tracks of "Arrested Development
Unplugged" — the live recordings we've al
ready heard, minus the vocals — are so dis
appointing: they don't go any place we
haven't already visited. The average Sue or
Greg is hip enough to realize that the con
cert recording concludes with track 11. It's a
pity that Arrested Development, MTV and
EMI didn't.

One-hit-wonders L.A.
Style have the ravers
dancing, but that's it

L.A. Style

L.A. Style isn't Even when their big sin
gle, "James Brown Is Dead" started cutting up
club doors across the United States more than
a year ago, L.A. raves were already splitting be
tween the House sets of deejays like Doc Mar
tin and Steve Loria, and the Hardcore sets of
people like Ron D. Core.
The hard techno of L.A. Style kind of fell
through the cracks, being more popular on
modern-rock radio stations like Live 105 and at
venues like the Edge, than with people fre
quenting real raves. But like Quadrophonia's
"Wave Of The Future," "James Brown Is Dead"
went a long way in pulling people previously
unfamiliar with the range and quality of house
music into an enjoyment of the whole spec
trum.
Just to clarify the difference: house music
tends to be around 120 beats per minute, with
a consistent four beats to the measure. It began
with deejays spinning old R & B cuts over the
techno-pop beats of Kraftwerk, and ever since
house artists have continued to try to bridge the
the space between hardware and soul. Hard
core, however, spans the 145 to 180 and up
BPM range and sounds like someone playing
the flamenco on your head with a ball-peen
hammer.
Hard techno is one of the styles spanning the
BPMs in between. It uses repetitive, almost
grungy electronic sounds and keeps the drums
pounding hard. From this hybrid comes L.A.
Style.
If you're interested in House, don't buy this
album. Take the money, buy a round trip Cal-
Train ticket or a full tank of gas up to San Fran
cisco and visit either BPM or Star Music. Ask a
bunch of questions, listen to the store deejays,
bring some headphones and start diving
through the crates.
Many of L.A. Style's tracks would be pass
able — the types of songs really good deejays
can take a strong 24 bars from and mix them
into a three-turntable collage. But on the
whole, L.A. Style fumbles, plagued by such an
noyances as a grating rapper who keeps coming
in songs with a Pro-Gainer™, testosteroned
voice saying witty things like "L.A. Style: In
your face!"
Not that rapping and techno are incompati
ble, and not that every rapper must have the tal
ent and wit of someone like Funkdoobiest, but
if you're going to bring in someone on lyrics, at
least take the time to write something worth the
effects-box they're looped through.
L.A. Style is adolescent pecking-order
music, music to play Street Fighter II to.
Although, having just been an adolescent, I
have to admit a certain liking for the track "Bal
loony," but only because it is a particularly ac
curate musical depiction of the effects of ni
trous-oxide, obtainable legally as whipped
cream at many of the finer grocers across the
United States, in case you want to play along.
Ultimately, what saves L.A. Style from being
a complete waste of time and petroleum by
products is that they have a CD out and I don't.
They're making people dance, and doing it

with a sense of humor, even if they're just more
one-hit wonders, arm-chair musicians and
artists with big toys.
