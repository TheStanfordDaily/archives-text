Hip-hop's biggest
phenom 'unplugs'
but keeps funky

Arrested Development

Somebody really digs overkill. At least
that's what the 18 tracks of "Arrested Devel
opment Unplugged" suggest. But that
doesn't keep the MTV-produced album
from being a better-than-average listening
experience. What's more, it captures the dy
namism of the A.D. sound better than the
studio produced "3 Years, 5 Months & 2
Days In the Life 0f..."
The same numbers — "Give A Man A
Fish," "Fishin' 4 Religion" and "Mama's Al

ways On Stage" — that sound pretty good
fresh from the studio, kick with tremendous
force and integrity when unplugged. This
gives the group's "dedication" to uniting the
loose ends of the African-American musical
diaspora (hip-hop, jazz, blues, etc.) a valid
ity that often falters on the '92 debut.
We can thank the "Extended Family
Band," directed by Kundalini Mark Batson,
for the improvements. The ensemble, an as
sortment of standard (piano, acoustic bass,
drums and guitar) and not-so-standard
("Quaker Oats Horn," "Box of Grits" and
"Hose Horn") instruments, lay down tight
R & B covers that bag the flavor of the Ar
rested originals without being overtly exces
sive.
The "Extended Family Band," however,
stays where a back-up group ought to: in the
background. At the heart of the recording
are Speech's skat-influenced rhymes, Head

liner's "turntable instrumental," the
Arethaesque vocals of Aerie Taree, Montshu
Eshe and Nadriah Ali, Rasa Don's percussive
skill and Baba Oje's spiritual advice. And
they handle this key position with verve.
But what steers the recording away from
the norm is the spontaneity of the live
recording. Aside from making us feel as if
we've got the best seat in the house, the
group's sincerity suggests they'd put as
much energy into a concert at a sold-out
arena as they would into a jam at a club the
size of a Lagunita single with an audience of
one.
Unfortunately, this also explains why the
last seven tracks of "Arrested Development
Unplugged" — the live recordings we've al
ready heard, minus the vocals — are so dis
appointing: they don't go any place we
