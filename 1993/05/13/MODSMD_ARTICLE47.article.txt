■ Benny & Joon
Hip Seattle grunginess meets 1920s slap
stick in this tale of misfit romance. Benny is a
mechanic who cares for his eloquent, but
schizophrenic sister, Joon. Enter Sam, a
charming weirdo who falls in love with Joon
to her brother's dismay. Johnny Depp pulls
off the physical-comedy scenes with a style
and grace that's truly Keatonesque. PG
Bodies, Rest & Motion
Possibly the world's first anti-road movie, this
film stars Phoebe "Mrs. Kevin Kline" Cates,
Bridget "Why doesn't it run in the family?"
Fonda, Tim "Master of 1,000 accents" Roth
and Eric "My face isn't really deformed"
Stottz as late-twentysomethings stuck in Ari
zona McJobs waiting for Godot — or a better
script. Pretentious and inane. R
Indecent Proposal
The Brat Packer, The TV Veteran and The
Sundance Kid can't save this bomb. Desti
tute couple wants money. Billionaire wants
wife. Billionaire offers a million dollars for one
night with wife. Couple agonizes over it. Wife
does it. Husband can't deal with it. Wife en
joyed it. What's next? Pain, angst and above
all, a happy ending. What's the moral?
Pimpin' ain't easy? Avoid. R
■ Like Water For Chocolate
In Mexico, hot chocolate is prepared by
adding cocoa to boiling water. So when a

person is sexually aroused, they are termed
"like water for chocolate." The youngest
daughter of ranching family is forced to stay
at home with her mother despite the atten
tions of a virile suitor. But her passion can't
be contained, so she releases it in the food
that she painstakingly prepares. A delec
table banquet of love, magic and food
served up by Mexican director Alfonso
Arau. Not Rated
■ Last Days of Chez Nous, The
Strong women dominate this unique Aus
tralian film on the residents Chez Nous, a
cramped Sydney cottage. An offbeat if-you
love-someone-set them free story, "Last
Days" explores the subtle intricacies of gen
der and family relationships. Cinematogra
phy compliments the storyline as ominous
angular shots exacerbate spatial tensions
and shots of the endless red deserts of the
New South Wales outback provide release. A
quiet celebration of family and femininity. R
Map of the Human Heart
Part WWII melodrama, part "Dances With
Seals," this Eskimo epic sinks in sap, despite
the presence of the adorable Jason Scott
Lee and dashing Patrick Bergin, stuck here
playing an affable sicko named Walter. Au
teur Vincent Ward manages to trivialize war,
racism, sex and disease in this disastrous hy
brid of art film, period piece and National Ge
ographic wildlife special. R
