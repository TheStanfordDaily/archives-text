Say it ain't so. Prince Rogers Nelson, unar
guably the most talented musician at work
today, has decided to retire from studio
production, so it's time to start that video shrine.
Doves cried and women screamed as Prince
brought his aggressively androgynous brand of
sexuality to the big screen in Purple Rain. Mor
ris Day of The Time fame co-stars in this time
worn tale of a misunderstood musician who wows
the Minneapolis scene with his uncompromising
style. One of the world's best concert movies...
... until Prince released Sign o' the Times,
which captured the energy of his European tour.
Alternating live numbers with witty vignettes
about male-female relationships, the film serves
as a showcase for Prince's prodigious showman
ship.
Prince's second, and perhaps best film Under
The Cherry Moon, actually had a plot. The Pur
ple One played Christopher "Tricky" Tracy, an
American gigolo working the south of France with
his pal Jerome (The Time's Jerome Benton). Tricky
falls in love with an heiress whose father schemes
to keep them apart. Not the most original idea in
the world, but cinematographer Michael Ballhaus
("Goodfellas") captures the action in pristine
black-and-white, while Prince and Jerome's en
gaging presences transcend the story. ■
