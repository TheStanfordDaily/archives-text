# BYOB regulations spark Greek debate
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Responding to pressure from
national chapters and insurance
worries, leaders of Stanford's fra
ternities and sororities met last
night to chart their course down
the seemingly inevitable road to
Bring-Your-Own-Beer parties.
Convening to discuss two pos
sible additions to the Greek Lead
ership Circle's social policy, ap
proximately 30 students debated
a suggestion warning against
common containers of alcohol
such as kegs, and another oppos
ing the use of chapter funds to
purchase alcohol.
Likened by some to the kiss of
death for fraternities, the new
BYOB requirements raised a spir
ited debate among the group
members, as a decision for a
sweeping recommendation was
advocated and opposed by differ
ent participants.
Adoption of such recommenda
tions would have no technically

binding consequences for Stan
ford's Greek organizations, be
cause actual policy of each individ
ual sorority and fraternity would
be decided internally.
The discussion was spurred by
demands from several fraterni
ties' and sororities' national chap
ters that local chapters imple
ment BYOB policies. Such pres
sure comes in response to new al
cohol-provision regulations of the
Fraternity Insurance Purchasing
Group — which insures many
Greek organizations.
These rules, if disregarded, can
place full liability on the Stanford
chapter and its members for acci
dents that occur at its social func
tions. Such responsibility could
result in lawsuits and the garnish
ing of future wages of the frater
nity or sorority's officers.
"Fraternities and sororities
are a large insurance risk," ex
plained Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Heather Dunn. "They are the
sixth-largest risk, in front of
asbestos removal and toxic
waste."
In response to this risk, the
national chapters of three of
Stanford's six sororities, as well
as a handful of fraternities, have
required their local groups to
implement a BYOB policy.
The Theta Xi and Delta
Upsilon fraternities have already
mandated a switch to a BYOB
policy, and Sigma Phi Epsilon is
expected to follow suit in
September. Other groups' char
ters only require adherence to
federal and University guide
lines, which do not yet disallow
the use of kegs.
Many members, mostly those
belonging to organizations
required to adhere to BYOB
standards, argued that their obli
gatory switch to the non-keg sys
tem would hinder, if not cripple,

their ability to remain competi
tive with other organizations'
social functions. They urged the
creation of a broad Greek com
munity agreement bent on bridg
ing the inequities between
groups.
"Some people say, 'I'm not
gonna have as much fun,' " said
Intersorority Council President
Jessica Schulman. "But I don't
think things are really going to
change that much (with BYOB). .
. but it's important that we work
together and support each other,
because nationally Greek organi
zations are declining, but here at
Stanford the system is expand
ing."
Interfraternity Council mem
ber and Sig Ep John Lucero
voiced similar sentiments: "I
strongly encourage easing into a
new policy; the situation presents
a lot of inequities among the
Greek community.
"It's feasible, the key is to
implement a policy where certain
weekends are BYOB and certain
fraternities, who are allowed to
have keg parties, only have BYOB

parties (on those weekends). Or
that groups must have one BYOB
party for every two they throw, so
they're not set apart because they
seem more social. But we can't

'I don't think things
are really going to
change that much
(with BYOB)'
—Jessica Schulman

jump into this."
Although most of the present
members agreed that the move to
the BYOB system would come in
the next 10 years, not all were
ready to succumb to a campus
wide Greek BYOB policy volun
tarily. Those whose national
chapters were not yet requiring
the move were in opposition to
the proposed additions to the
social policy.
While the circle could only

suggest that all fraternities and
sororities adhere to the two new
recommendations, and would
have no power to enforce the pol
icy, some protested that formal
policy additions could be drawn
upon by the Greek Judicial
Board and unfairly used against
them.
For example, when passing
judgement on Greek organiza
tions under investigation, the
board might use the recommen
dations as community standards
of safety and responsibility at par
ties. Subsequently, debate arose
as to whether or not these addi
tions could be the yardstick by
which individual groups, whether
BYOB mandated or not, would be
measured, and eventually penal
ized.
The two points were not for
mally recommended as additions
to the circle's social policy. The
suggestions are pending the for
mulation of formal written policy
examples, to be submitted to the
Office of Student Activities. They
may be voted on at the next meet
ing of the circle May 27.
