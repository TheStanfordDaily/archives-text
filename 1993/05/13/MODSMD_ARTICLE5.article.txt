# BYOB regulations spark Greek debate
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Responding to pressure from
national chapters and insurance
worries, leaders of Stanford's fra
ternities and sororities met last
night to chart their course down
the seemingly inevitable road to
Bring-Your-Own-Beer parties.
Convening to discuss two pos
sible additions to the Greek Lead
ership Circle's social policy, ap
proximately 30 students debated
a suggestion warning against
common containers of alcohol
such as kegs, and another oppos
ing the use of chapter funds to
purchase alcohol.
Likened by some to the kiss of
death for fraternities, the new
BYOB requirements raised a spir
ited debate among the group
members, as a decision for a
sweeping recommendation was
advocated and opposed by differ
ent participants.
Adoption of such recommenda
tions would have no technically

binding consequences for Stan
ford's Greek organizations, be
cause actual policy of each individ
ual sorority and fraternity would
be decided internally.
The discussion was spurred by
demands from several fraterni
ties' and sororities' national chap
ters that local chapters imple
ment BYOB policies. Such pres
sure comes in response to new al
cohol-provision regulations of the
Fraternity Insurance Purchasing
Group â€” which insures many
Greek organizations.
These rules, if disregarded, can
place full liability on the Stanford
chapter and its members for acci
dents that occur at its social func
tions. Such responsibility could
result in lawsuits and the garnish
ing of future wages of the frater
nity or sorority's officers.

are a large insurance risk," ex
