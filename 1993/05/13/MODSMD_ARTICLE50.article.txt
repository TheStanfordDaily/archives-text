They should be banned.
How many times have you stood in line
and watched someone — latitudinally over
present or not — order enough food to feed
an entire Somali village, then say, "Oh, and a
diet [insert name of offending beverage]
please."
These drinks by themselves won't help
shed or keep off those excess sacks of cellulite.

Yet so many of you consume them as though
they were diet pills or Ultra Slim-Fast.
It begs the question: what's the point in
drinking them as part of a diet when the
pounds you shed will come back with a
vengeance in the form of unsightly cancerous
tumors anyway?
And isn't it ironic that you diet drinkers
define yourselves by what you're not drink
ing. You don't drink Coke, you drink Diet
Coke — in a pathetic attempt to keep the

prestige of the real thing.
Consequently, there's a certain
masochism in consuming these diet drinks.
They forever remind you of what your fool
ishly imposed limits prevent you from savor
ing— the clear, calorific and caffeinated taste
of the original formula.
Follow the leader. Accept no substitutes.
