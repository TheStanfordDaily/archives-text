# Waiting for the changes
## Health-care reform worries Med students 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Like an anxious father pacing outside a ma
ternity ward, Stanford's medical students and
administrators are waiting nervously for the
delivery a new, national health-care plan that
may dramatically effect their futures.
"It's an uncertainty right now. People won
der what doctors will be doing, who will control
things, what it will do to me — no one really
knows what it is going to be," said Lennox
Hoyte, president of the Stanford Medical Stu
dents Association.
A complete overhaul of the health-care sys
tem was one of President Clinton's cam
paign promises. Clinton pledged to create a
program that would hold down the skyrocket-
ing costs of medicine and make
health care available to all
Americans.
Currently, the White House
Task Force on Health Reform
— headed by Hillary Rodham
Clinton — is trying to iron out
the new plan's details, which
should be sent to Congress next
month.
Although no final informa
tion has been released about the
cost or scope of the plan, the
president has said that he favors
a "managed competition"
approach, in which doctors and
patients join large health-care
conglomerates that would com
pete over price and quality.
Some students fear, however,
that reforms could lean too far
toward socializing medicine. If
health care becomes socialized,
pay for doctors will be restricted,
making it harder for students to
pay back their debts, Hoyte said.
"Students are concerned
about salaries, especially since it
takes so much time to chase
down a career in medicine,"
added Hoyte.
In 1991, doctors made an
average yearly salary of
$170,600. However, medical stu
dents can graduate with
upwards of a $100,000 debt.
At the same time, many stu
dents support the idea of health
care reform.
"I'm a strong believer that
society should provide health
care for everyone — that's my
primary goal. The system needs
change," said first-year medical
student Dorothy Sipkens.
Others added that being in
medical school has made them
look more closely at the health
care system as a whole.
"As a medical student, I can
see how inefficient health care is
now," said Michael Kay, a sec
ond-year medical student. "I def
initely favor socialized medicine
in concept, though I want to see
the details of the plan."
According to Hoyte, a trend
toward socialized medicine is
already apparent in the rising
number of people going into the
community-oriented side of

medicine.
Increasing numbers of stu
dents, he said, are going into
things like family practice on
their own initiative.
Medical School administra
tors also expressed uncertainty
about what Clinton's plan will
bring, as any change in health
care policies may also affect the
future of medical education.
"Our concerns are for the stu
dents and for educating them,"
said Dr. Charlotte Jacobs, senior
associate Dean for Student
Affairs at the Medical School.
"I'm anxious to see what the
plan is because we then must

make sure we're training stu
dents appropriately."
But as students wait with
uncertainty to hear the new pol
icy's details, some have
expressed excitement and sug
gestions of possible reforms.
"I'd like to see [Clintonl
address some of the difficult
issues, like care for the terminal
ly ill or expenses of high-risk
procedures," suggested Kay,
adding that he also believes the
plan should examine another
current concern of many stu
dents — the issue of malpractice
suits, which have driven up
health-care costs.
