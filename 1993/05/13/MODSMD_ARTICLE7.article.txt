# Food Service feasts for a day
## But some students question Faire's extravagance 
### Lenora Chu Staff writer 
Six tents boasting everything from bratwurst to
dim sum sprouted on Wilbur Field last night as
University Food Service hosted its first Spring
Food Faire.
The fair's purpose was "to show students that
our staff cooks are talented and can cook different
types of food from all over the world," said Saul
Cardienas, Jr., a student manager for Stern Food

Service.
The event, which promised "a culinary tour of
the world," offered six different international
menus ranging from Hawaiian to Tex-Mex. The
tents were adorned with such props as merry-go
round horses, Chinese arches and wooden cacti.
"The hashers have been really into it, coming up
with theme ideas and decorations on their own,"
said Board Plan Operations Manager Melanie
