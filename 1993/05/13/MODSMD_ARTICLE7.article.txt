# Food Service feasts for a day
## But some students question Faire's extravagance 
### Lenora Chu Staff writer 
Six tents boasting everything from bratwurst to
dim sum sprouted on Wilbur Field last night as
University Food Service hosted its first Spring
Food Faire.
The fair's purpose was "to show students that
our staff cooks are talented and can cook different
types of food from all over the world," said Saul
Cardienas, Jr., a student manager for Stern Food

Service.
The event, which promised "a culinary tour of
the world," offered six different international
menus ranging from Hawaiian to Tex-Mex. The
tents were adorned with such props as merry-go
round horses, Chinese arches and wooden cacti.
"The hashers have been really into it, coming up
with theme ideas and decorations on their own,"
said Board Plan Operations Manager Melanie

Jones-Carter. "Some of the staff
even brought their families with
them."
Some students, however, had
less positive reactions.
"Everything's a little extrava
gant for Food Service," said sopho
more Gigi Gano, "and it's ridicu
lous that they can charge so much
for food during the year, and then
spend it on carousel horses and

matching Chinatown hats."
Shirley Everett, Food Service's
associate director, declined to com
ment on the cost of the event but
did say that some of Food Service's
vendors funded the decorations.
Each dining hall generated their
own themes, centering on their
stairs specialties. For example,
Roble's theme was an "Amuse
ment Park," serving burgers and
corndogs.
"The amusement park was first
named Disneyland, but Disney
land was recruiting on campus, so
there was a last minute change" to

avoid advertising for the company,
said Everett.
Since all University-operated
dorms participated, all but one din
ing room was closed for dinner.
Lagunita Hall was the only option
for "students who wanted to eat
inside and avoid the trip out here,"
Everett said.
Sophomore David Himelfarb, a
Florence Moore Hall resident,
expressed his irritation at having to
traverse campus to get his dinner.
"I think it's obscene that we had to
go all the way to Wilbur Field to get
the same bad food that we usually

go downstairs to get," he said.
However, Tyler Talbot, another
sophomore, said the fair offered
some tasty morsels.
"I think it was better than the
usual food service. I attended the
Santa Fe booth and I had the
smoked Santa Fe chicken," he said.
"They had little Santa Fe tour
guides sitting there, for the sake of
authenticity I guess. It must have
been an extravagant cost."
Besides the culinary attractions,
the fair hosted entertainment,
including performances by a hula
club and Dixieland band.

Decorations were also an attrac
tion. Beach balls covered the center
of the field before the event for
"color and to kick around, but they
either blew away by the time the
fair started," said Everett.
Food Service hunted for special
items for each theme, including
"flying in pralines from New
Orleans for (the) 'Mardi Gras'
(booth)," said Craig Mitchell, man
ager of a la carte operations.
The fair is a "real social event
for people to see each other, as well
as a uniting experience for the
staff," Jones-Carter added.
