basic tips we

essential when

interview.
Conservative
styling is best.

single breasted in
solid dark colors —
navy, grey or navy
or grey pinstripe.
• Your dress shirt
should be white
with long sleeves,
button-down,
straight or tab collar.
• Ties should be con
servative. Choose a
basic regimental
stripe, micro-neat or
foulard print in bur
gundy or red shades.
• Shoes should be
black or cordovan —
pull-on or wing tip.
• Make sure your
interview outfit is
clean and well pressed
to give a well polished
business look.

two or three outfits

"call-back" interviews.
