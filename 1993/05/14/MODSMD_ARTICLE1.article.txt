# Protesting Playboy
## 25 students picket Holiday Inn during interviews of potential models for 'Girls of Pac 10' issue 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
About 25 students protested Playboy magazine
yesterday in front of — and at times, inside — the
Palo Alto hotel where Stanford women were being
interviewed for a special "Girls of the Pac 10"
issue.
"We are women, not girls! Stop objectifying us!"
read one of the posters displayed by picketers, who
sat on the curb in front of the Holiday Inn despite
a hotel manager's request that they move off the
property.
No arrests were made during the hour-and-a
half protest, although security officers twice es
corted groups of students from the building as
they attempted to talk with the Playboy photogra
pher and crew.
Approximately 60 Stanford women have been
interviewed and photographed over the last three

days, according to Karen Lynn, a Playboy stylist.
"I came up to ask if they would be willing to
have a dialogue," said sophomore Sara Skinner,
one of the protest organizers, as she left the maga
zine's hotel suite.
She said she posed as a potential model to get
into the room, but then spent almost a half hour
debating Playboy's representatives and hearing
their side of the issue.
Despite Skinner's efforts, however, photogra
pher David Chan refused to confront the students
outside. "He's busy right now," Playboy lighting
technician Hubert van Stephens said before call
ing hotel security.
Calling Skinner an "infiltrator," van Stephens
said, "I've been in all kinds of demonstrations and
this is the weirdest demonstration I've ever seen. I
just don't think it's appropriate for one to intrude
on an interview. It's not profes
sional."
When Holiday Inn manager
Andres Elkozi appeared a
moment later with two uniformed
security officers, Skinner and the
other students in the hail left
without resisting.
Two more Stanford students,
senior Mary Lembke and fresh
man Rachel Katz, emerged from
Playboy's suite a few minutes
later. Like Skinner, they initially
said they wanted to model and
then began a discussion on
whether the magazine objectifies
women.
"We had a really good, pretty
calm talk," Katz said, estimating
that they spent about 45 minutes
in the room.
"They didn't know a lot of the
things we brought up," Lembke
added. She said she quoted statis
tics on violence and discrimina
tion against women that sur
prised the Playboy representa
tives. "They said, That's the way
it used to be.' I said, 'Honey,
that's that way it is.' "
The magazine's representa
tives told the group that the
women who tried out for the mag
azine said they wanted to change
the perception that Stanford
women are ugly, Lembke said.
Meanwhile, the rest of the
protesters sat in front of the Holi
day Inn with their signs and flyers
— spending much of their time
responding to media questions.
Palo Alto police officers arrived in
three cars and spent about 15

minutes near the demonstration,
but did not take any action.
The point of the protest was
not so much to convince Playboy
that they are wrong but to show
that "most Stanford women are
not interested in 'having the time
of their lives' by being a Play
mate," Skinner said, quoting the
advertisement soliciting models.
Shortly after the protest began
at around 3:30 p.m., Elkozi asked
the students to move away from
the hotel. The protestors briefly
discussed whether they should
allow themselves to be arrested,
but the demonstration ended
without any mtyor confrontations
as students drifted off before 5
p.m.
While Chan would not com
ment, Lynn said the discussion
with the three protesters who got
into the suite was very rational. "I
understand both sides," she said.
"Playboy is not for everyone."
The Polaroid pictures will be
sent to the magazine's Chicago
headquarters and three women
will be selected for the Pac 10
issue, due out Sept. 7, Lynn said.
Those selected will be pho
tographed on a yacht in Sausalito
this weekend. Lynn said most of
the women who applied chose the
semi-nude or clothed options,
while approximately 20 percent
said they were willing to be pho
tographed completely nude.
"We had a lot of pretty girls
here," Lynn said.
The protest came together late
last night when several Columbae
residents discussed their objec
tions to Playboy and its recruiting
techniques, Skinner said. Adver
tising for the protest was limited
to phone calls and word-of

mouth.
"I'm actually really impressed
that this many people were will
ing to drop everything on such
late notice on a Thursday after
noon," she said.
Protests are quite common
when the magazine interviews at
universities, according to Playboy
spokesman Bill Paige. "It's gener
ally a very small group of people
and generally the protest is very
short-lived," he added. "There
just aren't that many people
opposed to Playboy — men or
women."
He refuted arguments that
Playboy objectifies women, saying
that to readers, the models "are
veiy real, the girl next door." The
women may be shown with broth
ers, sisters or even parents in
spreads that include information
about their personalities, he
added.
Playboy is popular not just
because of the beautiful women
but because it is "a real magazine
with journalistic integrity," Paige
said, and protesters may not even
have read the magazine before
they decide it denigrates women.
"Because they have a magic
marker and a piece of poster
board, you give them credibility,"
Paige said.
But Skinner argued that the
magazine's content is mostly pho
tos of women, rather than articles
focusing on the minds or interests
of the models.
"I think it's very ironic that
Playboy comes to a university set
ting, which is supposed to focus
on academics and intellectual
achievement, and they choose to
portray women's bodies rather
than emphasize their talents and

abilities."
"We do talk about a student's
hobbies and activities," Paige
countered, "but there's only so
much you can say in a photo cap
tion."
Censorship of erotic material
could lead to "some George
Orwell 1984 world" where not
just Playboy, Penthouse and Hus
tler are banned but also soap
operas, gay and lesbian literature,
and women's erotica, Paige said.
But Skinner said she does not

think pornography — which she
views as part of a continuum from
"the bikini-clad women hugging
cars you see in dorm rooms" to
"25-cent movies where women
are tied up and beaten and raped"
— should be censored. The pur
pose of the protest was to make
people think, she said.
Junior Josh Correll was one of
about seven or eight men to par
ticipate in the picketing. "It's
demeaning to everyone," Correll
said. "It's not just a women's

issue."
While she said the protesters
had some good points, Lynn also
had some criticisms. "They're
almost exploiting us for their own
purposes to get in the press," she
said.
"Being an American and being
a woman, you should have the
right of choice," Lynn added. She
defended Playboy as a very liberal
magazine that donates money to
schools, art foundations and
AIDS research.

Calling Skinner an "infiltrator," van Stephens
said, "I've been in all kinds of demonstrations and
this is the weirdest demonstration I've ever seen. I
just don't think it's appropriate for one to intrude
on an interview. It's not profes
sional."
When Holiday Inn manager
Andres Elkozi appeared a
moment later with two uniformed
security officers, Skinner and the
other students in the hail left
without resisting.
Two more Stanford students,
senior Mary Lembke and fresh
man Rachel Katz, emerged from
Playboy's suite a few minutes
later. Like Skinner, they initially
said they wanted to model and
then began a discussion on
whether the magazine objectifies
women.
"We had a really good, pretty
calm talk," Katz said, estimating
that they spent about 45 minutes
in the room.
"They didn't know a lot of the
things we brought up," Lembke
added. She said she quoted statis
tics on violence and discrimina
tion against women that sur
prised the Playboy representa
tives. "They said, That's the way
it used to be.' I said, 'Honey,
that's that way it is.' "
The magazine's representa
tives told the group that the
women who tried out for the mag
azine said they wanted to change
the perception that Stanford
women are ugly, Lembke said.
Meanwhile, the rest of the
protesters sat in front of the Holi
day Inn with their signs and flyers
— spending much of their time
responding to media questions.
Palo Alto police officers arrived in
three cars and spent about 15

minutes near the demonstration,
but did not take any action.
The point of the protest was
not so much to convince Playboy
that they are wrong but to show
that "most Stanford women are
not interested in 'having the time
of their lives' by being a Play
mate," Skinner said, quoting the
advertisement soliciting models.
Shortly after the protest began
at around 3:30 p.m., Elkozi asked
the students to move away from
the hotel. The protestors briefly
discussed whether they should
allow themselves to be arrested,
but the demonstration ended
without any mtyor confrontations
as students drifted off before 5
p.m.
While Chan would not com
ment, Lynn said the discussion
with the three protesters who got
into the suite was very rational. "I
understand both sides," she said.
"Playboy is not for everyone."
The Polaroid pictures will be
sent to the magazine's Chicago
headquarters and three women
will be selected for the Pac 10
issue, due out Sept. 7, Lynn said.
Those selected will be pho
tographed on a yacht in Sausalito
this weekend. Lynn said most of
the women who applied chose the
semi-nude or clothed options,
while approximately 20 percent
said they were willing to be pho
tographed completely nude.
"We had a lot of pretty girls
here," Lynn said.
The protest came together late
last night when several Columbae
residents discussed their objec
tions to Playboy and its recruiting
techniques, Skinner said. Adver
tising for the protest was limited
to phone calls and word-of

mouth.
"I'm actually really impressed
that this many people were will
ing to drop everything on such
late notice on a Thursday after
noon," she said.
Protests are quite common
when the magazine interviews at
universities, according to Playboy
spokesman Bill Paige. "It's gener
ally a very small group of people
and generally the protest is very
short-lived," he added. "There
just aren't that many people
opposed to Playboy — men or
women."
He refuted arguments that
Playboy objectifies women, saying
that to readers, the models "are
veiy real, the girl next door." The
women may be shown with broth
ers, sisters or even parents in
spreads that include information
about their personalities, he
added.
Playboy is popular not just
because of the beautiful women
but because it is "a real magazine
with journalistic integrity," Paige
said, and protesters may not even
have read the magazine before
they decide it denigrates women.
"Because they have a magic
marker and a piece of poster
board, you give them credibility,"
Paige said.
But Skinner argued that the
magazine's content is mostly pho
tos of women, rather than articles
focusing on the minds or interests
of the models.
"I think it's very ironic that
Playboy comes to a university set
ting, which is supposed to focus
on academics and intellectual
achievement, and they choose to
portray women's bodies rather
than emphasize their talents and

abilities."
"We do talk about a student's
hobbies and activities," Paige
countered, "but there's only so
much you can say in a photo cap
tion."
Censorship of erotic material
could lead to "some George
Orwell 1984 world" where not
just Playboy, Penthouse and Hus
tler are banned but also soap
operas, gay and lesbian literature,
and women's erotica, Paige said.
But Skinner said she does not

think pornography — which she
views as part of a continuum from
"the bikini-clad women hugging
cars you see in dorm rooms" to
"25-cent movies where women
are tied up and beaten and raped"
— should be censored. The pur
pose of the protest was to make
people think, she said.
Junior Josh Correll was one of
about seven or eight men to par
ticipate in the picketing. "It's
demeaning to everyone," Correll
said. "It's not just a women's

issue."
While she said the protesters
had some good points, Lynn also
had some criticisms. "They're
almost exploiting us for their own
purposes to get in the press," she
said.
"Being an American and being
a woman, you should have the
right of choice," Lynn added. She
defended Playboy as a very liberal
magazine that donates money to
schools, art foundations and
AIDS research.

Approximately 25 students protested Playboy magazine in front of the Palo Alto Holiday Inn yesterday.
The magazine is interviewing potential models for its "Girls of the Pac 10" issue.
About 25 students protested Playboy magazine
yesterday in front of — and at times, inside — the
Palo Alto hotel where Stanford women were being
interviewed for a special "Girls of the Pac 10"
issue.
"We are women, not girls! Stop objectifying us!"
read one of the posters displayed by picketers, who
sat on the curb in front of the Holiday Inn despite
a hotel manager's request that they move off the
property.
No arrests were made during the hour-and-a
half protest, although security officers twice es
corted groups of students from the building as
they attempted to talk with the Playboy photogra
pher and crew.
Approximately 60 Stanford women have been
interviewed and photographed over the last three

days, according to Karen Lynn, a Playboy stylist.
"I came up to ask if they would be willing to
have a dialogue," said sophomore Sara Skinner,
one of the protest organizers, as she left the maga
zine's hotel suite.
She said she posed as a potential model to get
into the room, but then spent almost a half hour
debating Playboy's representatives and hearing
their side of the issue.
Despite Skinner's efforts, however, photogra
pher David Chan refused to confront the students
outside. "He's busy right now," Playboy lighting
technician Hubert van Stephens said before call
ing hotel security.
Calling Skinner an "infiltrator," van Stephens
said, "I've been in all kinds of demonstrations and
this is the weirdest demonstration I've ever seen. I
just don't think it's appropriate for one to intrude
on an interview. It's not profes
sional."
