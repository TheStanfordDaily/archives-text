About 25 students protested Playboy magazine
yesterday in front of — and at times, inside — the
Palo Alto hotel where Stanford women were being
interviewed for a special "Girls of the Pac 10"
issue.
"We are women, not girls! Stop objectifying us!"
read one of the posters displayed by picketers, who
sat on the curb in front of the Holiday Inn despite
a hotel manager's request that they move off the
property.
No arrests were made during the hour-and-a
half protest, although security officers twice es
corted groups of students from the building as
they attempted to talk with the Playboy photogra
pher and crew.
Approximately 60 Stanford women have been
interviewed and photographed over the last three

days, according to Karen Lynn, a Playboy stylist.
"I came up to ask if they would be willing to
have a dialogue," said sophomore Sara Skinner,
one of the protest organizers, as she left the maga
zine's hotel suite.
She said she posed as a potential model to get
into the room, but then spent almost a half hour
debating Playboy's representatives and hearing
their side of the issue.
Despite Skinner's efforts, however, photogra
pher David Chan refused to confront the students
outside. "He's busy right now," Playboy lighting
technician Hubert van Stephens said before call
ing hotel security.
Calling Skinner an "infiltrator," van Stephens
said, "I've been in all kinds of demonstrations and
this is the weirdest demonstration I've ever seen. I
just don't think it's appropriate for one to intrude
