'Star Wars 5 era ends
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ten years and
nearly $30 billion after President Reagan
declared his vision of a leak-proof shield
against Soviet nuclear attack, the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars" pro
gram, is officially dead.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin said yes
terday the Clinton administration would
press ahead with work on anti-missile
weapons, but the centerpiece of the Rea
gan vision — weapons in space — is being
relegated to small-scale research.
"Today we are here to observe another
point of passage, which is the end of the
Star Wars era," Aspin told a news confer
ence at the Pentagon.
The Reagan-inspired program, official
ly called the Strategic Defense Initiative,
explored a dazzling array of exotic possi
bilities for destroying long-range missiles
in flight, including zapping missiles with
X-ray lasers in space. The program was
quickly dubbed Star Wars after the popu

lar movie 01 that name.
Star Wars spending peaked in 1992 at
$4.15 billion. It is $3.8 billion this year.

NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France (AP)
— A masked gunman claiming to have a
bomb took a nursery school class hostage
yesterday in a wealthy Paris suburb,
using a fax machine to dicker over his
demand for $18.5 million.
"This is a hostage-taking," he said in a
note to police. "Avoid a tragedy."
He later summoned a television jour
nalist and stressed that his sole motiva
tion was the ransom. But some reports
said he turned down an offer for more
than $9 million.
Officials said 20 children — mostly 3-
and 4-year-olds — were taken captive in
mid-morning, and 13 were freed over the
next 13 hours. At midnight (3 p.m. PDT),
the captor still held seven children and
their teacher, officials said.
