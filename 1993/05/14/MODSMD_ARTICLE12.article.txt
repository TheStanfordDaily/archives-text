# House panel approves tax hikes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House
taxwriters gave final approval yesterday
to one of the biggest increases in histo
ry, including higher rates for the rich,
an energy tax and higher levies for
many corporations.
The Ways and Means Committee
made only minor changes in President
Clinton's plan, which is aimed at reduc
ing the huge federal budget deficit.
The Democratic-controlled House
could consider the entire deficit-cutting
package next week. That would clear
the way for action by the Senate, where
there is considerably less taste for a tax
increase.
The bill that passed yesterday
includes a broad new energy tax, a boost
in the portion of Social Security benefits
subject to tax and a major increase in
income taxes paid by couples and indi
viduals earning more than about
$115,000 a year.
At a five-year cost of about $246 bil
lion, the tax increase would be one of
the biggest ever, although it would take
a smaller share of national income than

one signed by President Reagan in
1982.
The increase would provide half the
$500 billion, five-year deficit reduction
that is at the core of Clinton's economic
program. The rest is to come from
defense cuts and restraints on other
federal spending.
Although endorsing most of Clin
ton's plan without change, the commit
tee voted energy-tax relief for farmers
and the aluminum industry, accepted
only half the waterway-fuels tax the
president wanted, raised the 34 percent
maximum rate on big corporations to
only 35 percent, rather than 36 percent,
and junked his investment tax credit for
business.
The White House signaled Clinton's
endorsement of the changes. He told
reporters the change in the corporate
tax rate is acceptable because the bill
does not "reduce the overall contribu
tion from the business sector."
Whatever the effect on the deficit,
the bill would roll back some of the tax
cuts upper-income Americans were

given during the 1980s. More than 60
percent of the total tax increase would
fall on those earning more than about
$115,000 a year.
Major elements of the plan:
• A new tax on most forms of energy,
which would raise the price of gasoline
about 8 cents a gallon and boost a typi
cal monthly electric bill by about $2.25.
• The maximum portion of Social
Security retirement and disability
checks subject to income tax would be
raised from the current 50 percent to 85
percent. This would affect only the best
off 23 percent of beneficiaries, generally
couples with incomes over $32,000 and
singles over $25,000.
• The nominal 31 percent top tax
rate on couples and individuals would
increase to 36 percent. That would
affect couples earning more than about
$180,000 and singles above $140,000.
Taxable income above $250,000 would
be taxed at 39.6 percent.
• All wages would be subject to the 1.45
percent Medicare tax, which now does not
apply to earnings above $135,000.
