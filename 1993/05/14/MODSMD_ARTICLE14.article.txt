## Publish and perish 
### 
Teaching, rather than
research, should be the
first task for professors

PUBLISH OR PERISH.
Hmmm. Where does "teach"
fit into this equation?
Well, perhaps it will soon be
added to this age-old axiom of pro
fessors' prerogatives. Faculty
Senate approval of the conflict of
commitment and interest policy
currently under debate would at
once clarify many rules regarding
patents and research and, more
importantly, refocus the Universi
ty's attention toward the educa
tion of its students.
Along with clarifying points on
patent titles, the policy restates a
professor's duty to his university
— and vice versa. The new policy
proposal declares that faculty
"owe their primary professional
allegiance to the University, and
their primary commitment . . .
should be to the education,
research and scholarship pro
gram." By encouraging a greater
campus presence on the part of
the professors, the policy draft
goes far in addressing the need for
a clear commitment to education,
as well as to research.
Professors at an institution
such as Stanford are compensated
well enough to make student edu
cation their primary objective.
Faculty posts at the University
carry enough responsibility and
prestige that professors should
not find the need to turn the posi
tions into side jobs.
A corollary to this statement is
that research, while still, of
course, an important aspect of the
University, should also be subordi
nate to classroom ability and expe
rience. Professors wanting to
focus on non-classroom research
should announce that as their pri
mary goal and proceed to take sab
baticals. After all, isn't that what
sabbaticals were originally intend-

Ed for? Though research is a nec
essary element of any university, it
was never designed to be the axis
around which the institutions
revolve.
However, to render a policy of
commitment to education effec
tive, the University must elimi
nate, as well as it can, the pressure
to produce and publish research
findings. Easier said than done,
since much of the prestige of a
teaching faculty is dependant
upon the fruits of its research
labors. "Publish or perish" is great
for professor reputation, great for
that of his or her department,
great for the prestige of the Uni
versity — but utterly lousy for
neglected students.
While it is recognized that fac
ulty research and university pres
tige are inexorably linked in a
vicious circle, it is imperative to
the quality of student education
that students not be sacrificed —
as is too often the case today —
for the sake of empty honor.
Honor is generally a symbol of
past glory; the teaching of stu
dents will lead to triumphs in the
future.
Standardizing the status of its
faculty, whether in research or
teaching, can only help the Uni
versity and will enable faculty to
pursue their interests without
undue distraction. It should also
increase the quality of the teach
ing since those in the ranks of edu
cators will have a stronger, class
room-focused imperative.
As far as titles and information
to research, the new policy would
merely bring Stanford in line
with what other universities are
doing in taking title to inven
tions. The concept of informing
the University of all inventions is
also legitimate, as it would
remove the burden of determin
ing conflicts of interest from the
inventor.
To this end, Stanford should
demonstrate a commitment to
teaching through the approval of
the conflict of interest policy.
"Publish or perish or teach."
Now that's more like it.
