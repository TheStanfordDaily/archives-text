Negative attributes of anti-smokers appear in rebuttal

Having considered the
points made in Amanda Breen's
reply to my letter regarding the
treatment of smokers at Stanford, I
wonder — based on her refutations of
positions which I did not actually sup
port — if she ever took the time to read
my letter. Her anti-smoking diatribe in
no way addresses my statements, but
because she labels it a "response," I will
treat it as such.
My examples were very carefully
selected: in each case, a non-smoker
who was not infringing on anyone else's
rights — who was far away from them,
or whose clothes smelled like smoke or
who was known to be a smoker. The
issue then is not whether a non-smoker
should speak out when they are dis
turbed by second-hand smoke, but
whether they should feel justified in
their "comments, stares and (God for
bid!) coughing" which are motivated
simply because the other person is a
smoker. In this circumstance, those peo

pie offer obnoxious condemnations of
someone else's personal lifestyle, when
that lifestyle does not harm others. This
is sufficient evidence to support my
claim that they are "self-righteous."
I stated such people are "hypocriti
cal," based on the fact that they will not
make similar attacks under similar cir
cumstances. A person who is overweight
jeopardizes his own health but not that
of others. Yet this person will not be
subject to socially-accepted insults and
hurtful comments; rather, most people
would condemn anyone who crudely
expressed their disgust with an over
weight person's lifestyle.
Breen asks if smokers have ever con
sidered the "inconvenience" and "down
right harm they are doing to non-smok
ers around them when they smoke." It
would seem that my statement that I
have no problem with "reasonable
efforts to protect the rights and comfort
of non-smokers" would address that
issue quite clearly.

Breen states that "if it were only that
cigarette smoke smelled bad, I am sure
that most non-smokers, including
myself, would merely grin and bear it."
Then why does she implicitly support
someone who insults me for smelling
like smoke? And why does she call for
the ban on all tobacco sales at Tresidder
— which will restrict even considerate
smokers, and which obviously includes
chewing tobacco as well as cigarettes?
Heard of any deaths caused by "second
hand chew" lately?
Rather than protecting the health of
non-smokers — for which the Universi
ty and the city of Palo Alto have already
passed some of the strictest laws in the
nation — these measures are being
enacted to stop individuals from making
personal choices which Stanford and
Amanda Breen deem unwise. Who is
intruding now? So again, I ask why simi
lar choices are not also restricted?
What's the difference between a person
who buys chewing tobacco at Tresidder

and one who buys fattening foods? If
you're willing to support the individual
case, be aware of what will happen when
the underlying principle is consistently
applied.
Finally, I am amazed that Breen seri
ously contends that I would try to halt
the installation of necessary fire sys
tems in students' rooms to preserve
smokers' rights. First, it is abundantly
clear that smokers have no rights at
this school. Also, was anyone losing
sleep over the fact that they had no per
sonal fire alarm in their dorm room
prior to this new policy — did Breen
initiate a student movement to remedy
this extreme hazard? Most importantly,
how is it that hotels around the world
have hundreds of individual rooms with
hundreds of functional individual fire
alarms that aren't triggered by smoke?
Answer: they try to prevent fires, not
personal choices.
