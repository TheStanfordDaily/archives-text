# A
						warning to would-be models to consider the aftereffects of Playboy
## 
### 
I don't know whether to be appalled
that five Stanford women want to pose
for Playboy, or to be relieved that it's
not more. I do know, however, that
they don't understand what they're in
for.
Ten years ago, I came home to New
York from a vacation to find my phone
machine literally full of obscene phone
calls. Getting a real person didn't dis
suade anyone. The calls kept coming,
even in the wee hours of the morning,
until I had my number removed from
information listings. Some of the calls
were ludicrous — imagine someone

breathing loudly enough for a voice
activated tape recorder for three min
utes. Others were scary. Some threat
ened to come find me in my home.
They knew my name. Once I calmed
down a bit, I questioned a few callers
before hanging up on them. One, a
young man from a big East Coast uni
versity, said he and his friends had
seen my picture in Playboy, and they
were all calling.
My name is a common one. I've
received calls for other Deborah John
sons all my life. And sure enough, in the
then-current issue of Playboy, there was
a (mostly) naked woman named Deborah
Johnson, of New York City.
The experience drastically changed
my feelings about commercial pornogra
phy. I no longer believe that it is a pas
sive, victimless activity. In my case, it
led to action — harassing, scaring

action. Since I was not the person pic
tured, I'll never know if anyone came
looking for me — or what they would
have done if they'd found the woman in
the magazine. I don't think they would
have cared if she held a degree from
Stanford, or if she'd dropped out of high
school.
What they saw was a woman (not
even the centerfold) whom they owned.
They'd bought the magazine, and that
gave them the right (in reality as well as
fantasy) to do what they wanted with
the women in it.
So to the Stanford women who think
they're upholding the intellectual
integrity of the University by selling
their bodies to Playboy, I say, use your
brains. Think about how you're being
used. Think about who you're inviting
to come look you up on campus. And
unlist your phone numbers before the

magazine hits the newsstands
