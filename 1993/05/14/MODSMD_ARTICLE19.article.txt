## Summertime (job) blues 
### 
IN LIEU OF TODAY'S regularly
scheduled column about honor soci
eties, which would have prominently
contained the word "breasts," (as sug
gested by a source which will remain
anonymous) and would have discussed
the relative merits of black-market exotic
animal peddling, I bring you the follow
ing public service message:
Summer is coming. If you don't have a
job yet, you're screwed.
You'll be condemned to live at home and
work for your mother's best-friend's
cousin's company. Your job will consist of
threading pieces of wire through the ver
tebrae of deceased rodents for export as
necklaces to Honduras (no offense meant
to Hondurans who own such products;
additionally, The Daily absolves itself of
responsibility for any and all acts of vio
lence that directly or indirectly result
from this column). Aside from the work,
living at home has its up and down sides
as well.
On the up side, you get free room and
board (granted that you are forced to
eat the same meals that your mother [or
father, depending on who does the cook
ing . . . see, I'm conducting myself in a
thoroughly egalitarian way] has been
cooking for the past 20 years; or, worse
yet, to her culinary experiments like
tofu waffles). You get access to a TV. I
don't have to explain to you how key
this is for summer enjoyment. For the

small price of letting your parents think
that they have an influence in your life,
you can also get some gas money to
boot.
On the down side, you're subject to,
"Where have you been all night, during
which I have been waiting up for you
reading this exceedingly long and poorly
written Tom Clancy novel?" You have to
answer inane questions about school, rel
evant to college life in the early '60s, to
which you give the answer of least resis
tance. "Yes, Mom, I'll stay away from the
hippie drug heads. This is grunge fash
ion, not hippie fashion, I swear." To the
list of hazards of living at home, I add
high-school friends who say things like,
"Yeah, I mostly agree with that Rush
Limbaugh guy." Creepy.
Some people plan to do nothing for the
summer. I tried this for a month after
high school, and it was horrendous. I
slept until afternoon. Ate dinner.
Watched TV. Slept more. This sounds
more like a CIA mind-control experi
ment, but it was my vacation, once.
Whatever you do this summer, don't do
nothing. The sleep may sound good now,
but believe me, doing nothing bit big
dachshunds. At the very least, pull that
electric guitar you bought during fresh
man year (or maybe you wanted to be a
soft-spoken sensitive type and got an
acoustic) out from under your bed, and
give it a few strums. After your cat

attacks you, and your dog howls for a
while, stop strumming, and decide that
you should sell it to an unsuspecting
freshman who thinks a guitar will make
him cool.
On the flip-side, some people spend
the summer saving the planet. "Oh, I just
went to India, fed thousands of impover
ished people with Mother Teresa, then
when the infrastructure broke down, I
hand-built a road with bat guano for the
food trucks." "That's great, I, uh, went to
this great kegger and ..." These service
oriented people always bring me down, so
steer clear of them.
If you have a job, and can't or won't
live at home, this means you should find
an apartment or live on campus with
the cheerleading camp (a blessing for
some, a curse for many others). Other
wise you could be like me, with a job and
no viable plan for housing. A tent by the
stadium sounds livable. A burned-out
car maybe. If you see me wandering
around campus this summer, take me in
and give me a hot meal, then turn me
back out onto the cold, uncaring streets
of Palo Alto.

Kenny would like everyone to know that
ermines are a kind of weasel.
