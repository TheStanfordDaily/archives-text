## ASSU shuts down Beat the Bookstore 
### Eomesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
After three consecutive years
in the red, the ASSU will cancel its
Beat the Bookstore project at the
end of this quarter.
The project, created in the late
1980s, offered an alternative to
the Stanford Bookstore for stu
dents selling unwanted books.
The ASSU did not purchase the
books from students, as the Book
store does, but paid them for each
text sold.
Beat the Bookstore officials
would customarily accept books
with consignments from students
at the beginning of each quarter,
and attempt to sell the books dur
ing the term's first few weeks.
Students were paid for their pur
chased books, with the ASSU col
lecting a 15 percent commission.
On average, Beat the Bookstore
sold 200 books a day.
But in recent years, the pro
gram has failed miserably, sad
dling the ASSU with a $1,500 loss
in 1990-91, $4,500 last year and
about $1,000 this year, according
to ASSU financial manager Chris
tine Vargas.
"It just is not a good idea for us

to continue this project," Vargas
said. "It loses money, and doesn't
profit students that well." Beat
the Bookstore was designed "to be
a business project, not a service,"
she added.
Beat the Bookstore director
Reid Conway said the agency lost
money "because we didn't have
enough people bringing in books.
If we don't have books, we can't
sell them."
But whether an increase in
books could be accommodated by
the ASSU is doubtful in itself.
"Tresidder has no place to store a
large amount of books," Conway
said. "While we needed more
books, there really was no way for
us to enlarge."
Yet sales were slow even dur
ing periods of "good business."
"There's a big turnover in edi
tions," Conway said, explaining
one of the problems Beat the
Bookstore confronted. "The big
(engineering and mathematics)
textbooks, which make the most
money, go out of date because new
editions come out."
Conway added that students
tend to keep these texts, leaving
