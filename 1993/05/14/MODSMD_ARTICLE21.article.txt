# Joel Stein: Aphorisms that Smudge
## 
### 
T'S BECOME TOO DAMN HARD
to get thrown out of Stanford. Food fights
won't do it. Smuggling flappers back to your
dorm room won't do it. Not even switching
the labels on your Resident Fellow's bottles
of Rogaine and body oil will do it.
Odds are, Belushi would have gotten his
degree without ever landing himself in
Diana Conklin's office — although, come
to think of it, he probably would have
wanted to be there very, very badly.
Seems like the only way to get any
attention around here is to do something
unmentionably horrific, like hiring a really
bad accountant. But most of us wouldn't
know what to do with incredibly expensive
sheets anyway. Maybe that's the problem.
College has indeed lost some of its fun.
As it was explained to me in movies, televi
sion and Brett Easton Ellis books, college is
supposed to be fun — for the same reason
high school would have been fun, if both

your parents had overseas jobs that
required a lot of travelling to places with
out telephones.
It was supposed to be a place to get into
really big trouble. Trouble that would force
you to learn important rhetorical skills you
could use when appearing on "60 Minutes"
with your wife. Trouble that starts with
capital "T," which rhymes with "P." The
kind of trouble that people like Raoul
Niemeyer don't think is so funny.
Not only aren't your parents here to
stop you, but a bigger campus should
translate into the excitement of a bigger
principal's office. But it doesn't.
There's no rule book, no curfew checks
and no one-foot-on-the-floor rule —
although that might very well improve sex.
Even Residential Education is too cautious
to make a statement about Playboy's
recruiting of our finest, um, minds. If the
PC-police are afraid to offend someone who
would allow themselves to be referred to as
a "Playmate," then chewing gum in class
isn't going to throw anyone.
With no authority to rebel against,

streaking becomes nothing more than
dumb fraternity pledges who should
switch the labels on their own Rogaine and
body oils.
Not only is it too difficult to get the Uni
versity's attention, but it's become too dif
ficult to get anybody's attention around
here. Without a sounding board for those
innate countercultural instincts we
learned about in seventh-grade health
class, none of us are sure exactly what it is
we're supposed to be rebelling against. So
we unilaterally refuse to be shocked by
anything.
Therefore, nothing is ever fully
embraced. The kind of cultural naivete
which made the '60s and '70s fun and
exciting and dangerous is dead ("Not only
will buying this Buffalo Springfield album
improve my chances of getting Suzie into
bed, but it just might stop the war in Viet
nam too").
Everything has become so socially
acceptable that no one even thinks to ask
the guy at the Coffee House if it's tough to
French kiss with that tongue-ring. It's too

difficult to be different, and far too physi
cally painful to attempt it without any
guarantee of success with the babes.
So we slowly drink our Zima and
become reactionaries without a cause. Go
buy a wardrobe at the GAP and settle
down for a nice, relaxing four years on a
sundeck behind a Powerßook. Tell your
parents to keep their old college bong as a
family heirloom and send you off to school
with a Blockbuster card.
No, college isn't fun in the way the
paunchy alumni at football games like to
think it should be. And to be honest, there
isn't all that much of an adrenaline rush to
be had in swallowing live goldfish. Protest
ing nuclear war has become far too com
plex. And, given the way things are going,
moving to Seattle and joining a rock band
— even if you have little to no talent — may
actually be a safer career choice than inter
viewing for jobs on Wall Street.
Yes, we're more responsible than our
parents. We can justify the "real-world"
utility of our major before anyone even
asks ("Well, eveiyone, in every business,

has to COMMUNICATE, don't they?").
We use subtle forms of peer pressure to
goad friends into not drinking, so they'll
drive. And we use latex to do things medi
cal science once thought it was completely
unnecessary for.
Today, fun means dressing up in a suit
and tie and working for Goldman Sachs.
It's hip, it's cool and it pays $40,000 a year.
And that may just be more fun than spend
ing weekends vomiting in a moat in the
basement of a fraternity house. Maybe not.
But it's got to be a hell of a lot better than
getting one of those tongue-rings.
