## Flanagan follows footsteps of greats in leading role

Michael Flanagan WHO?? The Stan
ford men's tennis team has an unending
list of legendary players. However,
Michael Flanagan is definitely not one of
them — yet.
"He's not the best No. 1 we've had, but
he's compiled a darn good record," said
Dick Gould, Stanford's head coach of 27
years.
With a No. 5 national ranking and a 12-
7 record, junior Flanagan has done a very
respectable, if not impressive, job at the
top of the Cardinal lineup. After playing at
No. 2 last year, in the shadow of the now
graduated Alex O'Brien, Flanagan had his
sights set on the top spot this year. But
first, he had to beat out three other juniors
— Chris Cocotos, Rob Devens and Vimal
Patel — who also aspired to hold the cov
eted position.
"That round of challenge matches was
their way of proving that nothing was
handed to me," Flanagan said. "It was my
spot to lose after that."
Yet, he has hung on tenaciously, feeling
the weight of Stanford's tennis legends as
he battles with the nation's best players.
"There is a lot of pressure at No. 1, not
even with your teammates, but it's like
you're playing against ghosts of the past
... all those great names," Flanagan said.
"Even if you're winning matches, there is
pressure to be playing as well as those guys
did."
Gould feels that part of Flanagan's suc
cess lies in the fact that playing No. 1 has
not skewed his perceptions of his ability.
"Some guys think they are better than
they are, and they play mind games with
themselves," he said. "Michael just goes
out and plays."
In addition, Flanagan is quick to recog
nize his weaknesses and improve on them.
"He takes his losses as learning experi
ences," Gould said. "He's not above realiz
ing that he has weaknesses, and working
at them. It is a nice example for the
younger guys."
Flanagan's role as a team leader is not

currently clear cut. Although he plays at
the top of the lineup, he is one of four
upperclassmen, all of whom have impres
sive records and credentials. To compli
cate matters, the team's captain, senior
Roman Sydorak, has not played in the
starting lineup during the latter half of the
season.
"Last year and freshman year, when I
played lower in the lineup, I felt like the
tempo of the team match was dictated by
the match on Court 1. I've done my best to
create a positive feeling this year," he said.
"I want to steer the team in the right
direction, but I don't have the (match)
record to back it up."
Regardless of his record, Flanagan's
consistency — a weakness in the past —
has improved greatly. He attributes much
of this to the talent of his opponents.
"When you play No. 1, every day is
going to be a good match, because every
player is a good player. At No. 2, maybe
you can get away with playing a bad match
and still win," he explained. "This has
made my consistency much better. I can
string three or four days of good tennis
together now. I haven't had any real down
streaks this year — last year I played well
in the beginning, then I was down for
awhile and then I played well again at the
end."
This consistency has enabled him to
knock off strong opponents, day after day,
in tournament play. At the Intercollegiate
Team Championships in February, the
unranked Flanagan defeated then-No. 5
Tamer El Sawy of LSU, No. 12 David Hall
from Duke and Kentucky's Mahyar
Goodarz.
"Those were three good matches where
I led the team. I proved that I could lead at
No. 1," Flanagan said.
Another component of his success has
been what some might call becoming inde
pendent. As the youngest of three siblings,
Flanagan always had someone watching
out for him. After his brother Chris grad
uated from Stanford last spring, Michael
found himself, for the first time in his life,
with no one to lean on except himself.
"Not having my brother around as a
sounding board made a big difference this
fall. I had to learn to deal with (personal

and family) problems myself," Flanagan
explained.
"It is actually similar to being on the
court: you analyze the problem and find a
solution. [Depending on myself) really
increased my self-confidence, and I think
that transcended onto the court."
Along with self-confidence and consis
tency on the court came the realization
that Flanagan was competitive with the
best collegiate players in the country.
"Looking around at every tournament,
and knowing that I have a legitimate shot
at winning, is pretty exciting," he said.
Gould agreed: "I couldn't be more pleased
with Michael... he's come a long way. He
can hold his own against anyone."
Confidence and consistency will be in
high demand in the upcoming days, as the
Cardinal fights its way through the draw
of the NCAA Championships in Athens,
Ga., in search of a second-consecutive
team title. Although Stanford is seeded
fourth, Flanagan feels that the squad has
a legitimate shot at winning.
"If there's one thing I've learned over
the last three years (going to NCAAs), it's
that the winner is just the team that
comes up with the best tennis over that
four-day span," Flanagan said. "There are
no real dominant teams this year... We
have the ability; it is more a question of
can we use it on the right days, and I think
we can."
