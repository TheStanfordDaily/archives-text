Sailing
So much for fair play and tradition.
For last Saturday's annual Stanford/Califor
nia Sailing Challenge Series in Berkeley, the
Golden Bears must have borrowed a vessel
from Cal alumni. Violating the spirit of the
best-of-five match series, the donors of the
technologically superior Cal boat specified that
it not be loaned to the Cardinal every other
race, as had been the custom for over a centu
ry.
Not surprisingly, the Golden Bears went on
to blank the Cardinal in three-straight races,
though Stanford did manage to get the early
jump and win the start on two occasions.
