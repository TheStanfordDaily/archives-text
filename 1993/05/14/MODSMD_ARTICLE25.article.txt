# Track winds up regular season
## Hosts Pre-Pac-10 meet Sunday 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Stanford will provide one last chance for athletes to
track down a Pacific 10 Conference Championship
qualifying mark this Sunday, before the Pac-10 teams
head to Berkeley for the conference finals next Friday.
Though playing host at Stanford Stadium, the Car
dinal will have a hard time warding off some of the
best competitors on the West Coast on their home
turf. Representatives from traditional track-and-field
powerhouses Arizona, California and Washington
State will be on hand, in addition to any walk-ons who
cover the $2 entry fee.
The added competition will give those Stanford ath
letes already slated to compete in Berkeley a final reg
ular season tune-up â€” while giving others a last-ditch
effort to reach their Pac-10 qualifying standards.
Having already qualified eight men and eight
women for the Pac-lOs, Stanford is still looking to field
two 18-member teams before the regular season ends
next week.
"We have the luxury of entering one person in each
event with wild-card entries," said coach Vin Lananna.
"So, in addition to those who have an automatic time,
we'll probably also take our top performers in each
event."
For the Cardinal athletes who have already quali
fied, their main objective will be to work on refining
racing skills and timing up for the Pac-10 meet.
"Almost everyone's moving to a different event,"
said freshman Kay Luo, who qualified in the 1,500-
meters last week, but will be racing in the 800 this
weekend.
"This week everything is focused on the individual
and their qualifying times," said senior long-jumper
Jason Robinson, who has already hit the automatic
mark. "Last week, it was team, team, team and we
came out of that with a lot of emotions riding high. So
we need a little rest now before the Pac-lOs."
Sprint-specialist Rene Rodriguez, who set the
freshman school record in the 400 last week at Big
Meet, will take an emotional and physical breather by
running a conservative 200 this weekend.
"I'm definitely not going to run the 400 again,"
Rodriguez said. "The body gets worn out with the
same race every week. My mqjor goal is to not get hurt
