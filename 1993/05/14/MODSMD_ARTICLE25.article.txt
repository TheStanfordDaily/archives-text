# Track winds up regular season
## Hosts Pre-Pac-10 meet Sunday 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Stanford will provide one last chance for athletes to
track down a Pacific 10 Conference Championship
qualifying mark this Sunday, before the Pac-10 teams
head to Berkeley for the conference finals next Friday.
Though playing host at Stanford Stadium, the Car
dinal will have a hard time warding off some of the
best competitors on the West Coast on their home
turf. Representatives from traditional track-and-field
powerhouses Arizona, California and Washington
State will be on hand, in addition to any walk-ons who
cover the $2 entry fee.
The added competition will give those Stanford ath
letes already slated to compete in Berkeley a final reg
ular season tune-up — while giving others a last-ditch
effort to reach their Pac-10 qualifying standards.
Having already qualified eight men and eight
women for the Pac-lOs, Stanford is still looking to field
two 18-member teams before the regular season ends
next week.
"We have the luxury of entering one person in each
event with wild-card entries," said coach Vin Lananna.
"So, in addition to those who have an automatic time,
we'll probably also take our top performers in each
event."
For the Cardinal athletes who have already quali
fied, their main objective will be to work on refining
racing skills and timing up for the Pac-10 meet.
"Almost everyone's moving to a different event,"
said freshman Kay Luo, who qualified in the 1,500-
meters last week, but will be racing in the 800 this
weekend.
"This week everything is focused on the individual
and their qualifying times," said senior long-jumper
Jason Robinson, who has already hit the automatic
mark. "Last week, it was team, team, team and we
came out of that with a lot of emotions riding high. So
we need a little rest now before the Pac-lOs."
Sprint-specialist Rene Rodriguez, who set the
freshman school record in the 400 last week at Big
Meet, will take an emotional and physical breather by
running a conservative 200 this weekend.
"I'm definitely not going to run the 400 again,"
Rodriguez said. "The body gets worn out with the
same race every week. My mqjor goal is to not get hurt
and run the 200 like the first half
of my 400 race. This is really only a
preparatory meet for the Pac-lOs."
Sophomore Tovi Abello, who
has secured one of Stanford's
wild-card spots after running a
14.46 seconds in the 100 hurdles,
missing the automatic standard
by .02 seconds, considers the
upcoming meet as another chance
to improve his time.
"We're all trying to get better
and move up in the Pac-10 rank
ings before we get there," Abello
said. "We're feeling pretty confi
dent after the good performance
last week against Cal, but we still
have areas of our races to tune up

and sharpen."
As a young team in its first
year under Lananna, Stanford
has no delusions about being the
Cinderella team at this year's
Pac-108. During last week's Cal
meet, the squad showed some of
its inexperience in both the men
and women's 4 x 400 relays. The
two teams were disqualified after
Cardinal runners fumbled the
baton on the third and anchor
legs, respectively.
"We've improved tremendous
ly from last year, but we're not
there yet," Lananna said. "We've
been down on the men's side for a
long time, and this season is
geared towards climbing our way
back up into the middle, same for
the women. So far, I am very
pleased with how many people we
have qualified for the finals."
