# Cardinal slams door on Irish to open NCAAs

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Laxmi
Poruri won her first point at the
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onships by slamming the ball so hard,
it hit the court and bounced over the
back fence for an unreturnable win
ner.
And so it went for the Cardinal yes
terday in its first appearance in this
year's tournament, as Stanford defeat
ed Notre Dame 5-0 in a second-round
match to advance to the quarterfinal
round against Georgia today.
Stanford (23-2 overall, seeded No. 2
in the tournament) appeared to be in
fine form against the Fighting Irish
(17-7, No. 18) after sitting out the first
round with a bye and waiting through
a two-hour rain delay before taking to
the courts yesterday.
Poruri, the Cardinal's No. 1 player,
pushed past freshman Wendy Crab
tree, 6-3, 7-5. Using an arcking slice
backhand and touch volleys to change
up the pace of the match, Poruri —
ranked No. 2 by the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association — frustrated the
Midwest's rookie-of-the-year, causing
Crabtree to continually make mis
takes. Although Poruri suffered from
a concentration lapse in the second set

that put her down 0-3 and 2-4, she
came back with three-consecutive ser
vice breaks to clinch the match.
"[My concentration] is one of the
things I have trouble with some
times," Poruri explained. "I started off
really well . . . This was my first
match, and I haven't played [competi
tively] for a month because of injuries,
so I was just getting used to every
thing."
Heather Willens, playing in the No.
2 slot for Stanford, had no such trou
bles as she pounded through Notre
Dame's Sherri Vitale, 6-2, 6-1. Vitale's
father Dick, of ESPN and ABC basket
ball-commentary fame, was not on
hand to witness the match.
Perhaps the most interesting story
of the day, however, involved No. 3
Kim Shasby. While chewing gum and
waiting for her match, she loosened a
filling in her tooth and was rushed to a
dentist. Thanks to the weather delay,
she was able to make it back in time to
dispense of junior Christy Faustmann,
6-2, 6-4.
Shasby, who redshirted last year
and has shot up to a No. 6 national
ranking, found her first NCAA Cham
pionship appearance to be more than
she expected. "It's so exciting . . .
there's an aura around here," she said.
"I didn't think I'd be as nervous as I

was, but there was more to it than a
normal tenuis match."
In the No. 4 slot, junior Kristine
Kurth played a somewhat unusual
match. After grabbing the first set
from Lisa Tholen, 6-1, Kurth found
herself down 0-3 in the second. After
some words of wisdom from coach
Frank Brennan, however, she zoomed
to a 5-3 lead, but then faltered to 5-5
before closing out the set and match,
7-5.
Sophomore Amy Chiminello
clinched Stanford's victory with a 6-4,
6-3 win over Notre Dame's Laura
Schwab. Using her drop shot as a
deadly weapon, Chiminello caught
Schwab standing flat-footed on the
baseline on several occasions and
exhibited more patience in long rallies
to prevail.
Freshman Beth Berris had her
NCAA Championship debut cut short,
thanks to Stanford's quick 5-0 deci
sion. She took the first set from Holyn
Lord 6-4, but dropped the second 2-6.
It was 4-4 in the third when the match
was called off.
"I was nervous," Berris admitted.
"It was a different atmosphere. Our
team spirit was magnified by about
100, and it was just a really neat, excit
ing feeling."
Commenting on some of his play

ers' anxiety, Brennan seemed uncon
cerned. "This is the NCAAs; I'd be dis
appointed if we went out there sort of
blas6 and just breezed through it,"he
said. "The girls are thoroughbreds,
and they were kicking the barn door
down this morning trying to get out
and beat up on somebody ... I told
them, 'If you're not excited, you're not
alive.' "
As it turns out, Brennan had pre
dicted the win in a telepathic sort of
way. "I had a dream two weeks ago
that we were going to play Notre
Dame, and this was before they even
announced who was in the tourna
ment," he said.
Stanford should receive more com
petition from the Bulldogs today.
Georgia (19-5) is seeded No. 7, and
defeated No. 12 Indiana 5-3 yesterday
to advance.
This will be the sixth time in seven
years that the two teams have met in
the NCAAs, with Stanford winning
each time. In February, the Cardinal
defeated the Bulldogs 5-1 in the semi
finals of the USTA/ITA Nationals in
Madison, Wis.
"We've been pretty lucky with
them," Brennan admitted.
