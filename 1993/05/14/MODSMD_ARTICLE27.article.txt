# Desert storm: Rebels hit town for three-game set
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The kid from Las Vegas didn't play his cards
well at the end of the year.
Stanford third baseman Brian Dallimore, son
of Nevada-Las Vegas head coach Fred Dallimore,
broke his hand three games ago, dashing any

hopes of a father-son showdown this weekend.
The younger Dallimore will watch from the side
lines as UNLV comes to Sunken Diamond this
weekend, wrapping up its season with a three
game set at Stanford.
But this doesn't take anything away from what
has been a spectacular season for the freshman.
Dallimore leads the squad with a .344 average

and 14 stolen-bases, numbers which go beyond
even the most lofty expectations he brought with
him this year.
"I was hoping Brian would hit around .300 and
play somewhere in the infield," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess. "He has had an unbeliev
able season."
Dallimore, A.J. Hinch and Cale Carter formed
the backbone of a freshman class considered by
many to be the best in the nation heading into the
season. But while Hinch grabbed early headlines
with a ninth-inning home run at Cal State-Fuller
ton and Carter opened the year with a 14-game
hitting streak, Dallimore struggled both at the
plate and in the field at the start of the season.
A shortstop at Clark High School in Las Vegas,
Dallimore was shifted to third base at Stanford,
as the Cardinal began the year with two experi
enced shortstops, Jed Hansen and Todd Laßocca.
Dallimore struggled early at the hot corner, com
mitting six errors in his first nine starts. Howev
er, he made only 10 the rest of the season, playing
"some really solid third base," according to Mar
quess.
Dallimore experienced a similar turnaround at
the plate. After moving up and down the lineup
during the first half of the season, Dallimore set
tled into the leadoff slot at the end of March —
and immediately embarked on an 11-game hitting
streak. He hit .400 over 80 at-bats as the leadoff
man, swiping 10 bases in those 21 games.
"He has real good baseball instincts," Mar
quess said. "We could tell he knew how to play,
but he did more than what we expect out of fresh
men."

Brian Dalllmore has powered his way past expectations this season. Unfortunately, a broken hand
will keep the Cardinal freshman out of his first matchup with father Fred, the head coach at UNLV.
