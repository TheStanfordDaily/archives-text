Stanford University's 10th president,
Gerhard Casper, is more than a
mere administrator. While juggling
budget problems, rising costs and
the maintenance of Stanford's
increasingly innovative academic
programs, his leadership has helped
Stanford remain one of the brightest
stars in the galaxy of higher
education. Casper is, indeed, our
Renaissance Man.


Casper, the "Grunge King." At a recent campus
address, Casper dives into the arms of his
adoring student populace.


Casper, Man of the Earth. A Wild West
afficionado, Casper makes well of his
stay here on the Farm.


Casper, expert martial artist. The key to
karate is defense, which Casper himself
strives for — defense of academic
prowess, defense of liberty, defense of the
glory of this fine institution.


Casper, supermodel. Showing his impeccable taste
and dedication to fashion, Casper maintains not only a
stalwart sense of style but a profound photogeneity.


Casper, athlete extraordinaire. Always in top physi
cal condition, Casper is a man who not only rows
gently, but merrily, merrily, merrily as well.
