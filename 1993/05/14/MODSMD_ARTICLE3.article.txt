## Faculty Senate discusses importance of obeying environmental regulations 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate spent
much of yesterday's meeting dis
cussing Environmental Protec
tion Agency regulations and how
they apply to University work.
According to Lawrence Gibbs,
the director of Environmental
Health and Safety, EPA regula
tions must be addressed and
taken seriously by all members of
the Stanford community.
Last December, the California
Environmental Protection
Agency, a state agency similar to
the federal EPA, found Stanford
guilty of 28 violations involving
hazardous waste storage and dis
posal.
According to Gibbs, the
agency's concern stemmed from
what it perceives as a history of
Stanford violations. The Univer
sity is currently working with the
state to resolve problems cited in
the 1988, '89, and '92 inspections.
Gibbs pointed out that the vio
lations were all of a technical na
ture and involved procedural is
sues such as container labeling.
He said Stanford has made opera
tional changes to ensure that no
more than a minimal amount of
these violations reoccur.

EPA regulations also require
all University employees to know
what to do in the event of an emer
gency on campus.
"We need to ensure that all
(members of) the faculty and ad
ministration are aware of the laws
and regulations," Gibbs said after
the meeting.
The biggest problem in dealing
with the EPA regulations, Gibbs
said, is that they are written with
industry, and not a university, in
mind.
The general regulations —
which apply to both industry and
research institutions — are de
signed for large amounts of indus
trial waste, and do not particular
ly apply to the small amount of re
search-related waste generated by
institutions like Stanford, Gibbs
said.
Echoing Gibbs' point, Chem
istry Prof. Steven Boxer said after
the meeting that the EPA's regu
lations make great sense for big
industries that work every day
with large amounts of waste.
Stanford labs, on the other hand,
deal with microscopic amounts of
material, he said.
During the meeting, Gibbs
called for Stanford to help lead a
