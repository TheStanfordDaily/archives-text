# Blamin' it on my genes: a fuzzy's story
## 
### 
Foam core, PVC pipe, duct tape and glue guns
— these are alien objects in my life. I am not an
engineer, and the realization hit me as I walked
past the Physics tank, just as the ME 101 pro
jects were being presented: I never will be.
It was more than a mere realization, it was
pure enlightenment. And it didn't just hit me. It
bowled me over with the force of a two-ton
Chevy truck — ran over me in reverse and
dragged me a few miles before depositing my
worthless body back at my semi-self-op doorstep.
Since the fateful day when I opted to be a lin
guistics mtyor, I have never regretted the deci
sion to be fuzzy as much as I did on Monday.
Mom said be an English Dad said the
same. After all, they were, and so was one of my
older sisters. The other sister was a Communi
cation mqjor. She claimed that the mass media
was controlling the mind of every person in
America through the airways; and with all the
ham radio transmissions, we'd never know for
sure which signals come from other planets.
Thanks for the input.
Thus, I had no high expectations for technical
mastery when I came to Stanford, and I clearly
had liberal-arts chromosomes.
But now I fear. On the grand fear scale, it
would be somewhere between the fear I have
that when I'm in a department store dressing
room there are people making videos of me to sell
on the porno black-market, and the fear I have of
suddenly developing lactose-intolerance after
moving to Wisconsin.
At times it's not just a fear fear, but a wonder
and-awe type of fear. It's equivalent to that of a

small Palo Alto child when he or she encounters
the giant statue couple sitting on the bench
along Embarcadero Road. Two things, and only
two things, run through that kid's head. Either:
"They're out to get me" or "Will I ever be like
that someday?"
Engineers are out to get me.
They're making my degree worthless. They'll
go to Stanford for four years and come away with
job offers, company cars and damn-good salaries.
I'll come out of Stanford in four years wondering
what a job offer is. "If you can handle a spatula
like a pro and deep fry with the best of them,
Foster's Freeze wants you and is willing to pay
$5 an hour!" comes to mind.
Oh lord, why me... Why not me?
It's all because of my fuzzy genes. The only
job I can think of that has more perks than an
engineer is that of Jesus Christ. But David Kore
sh pretty much ruined that for the rest of us.
How many more bozos in the United States
would be willing to believe that / was the Lord
and they should give their money to me? (If you
know any, don't hesitate to send 'em my way.)

How I have wished that, on that terrible day
a year ago when in a dazed and frenzied state I
ran into the Registrar's Office to declare my
major, with my "Undeclared Junior" letter in
one hand and "Courses and Degrees" and a coin
to flip in the other, I could have met some sort of
savior. I'm not thinking of Jesus, or even Kore
sh. I envision an Obi Wan type of man, in a dark
robe and maybe Birkenstocks.
As I nervously approach Old Union, he would
reach out for my "Courses and Degrees" and
avow in a striking baritone, "This is not the
mtyor you are looking for."(And I, not being a
linguistics major yet, would never deign to
remind him that 18th-centuiy grammarians
would not have agreed with his gutsy choice to
end a sentence with a preposition.) Then he
would turn to page 86, where — in glorious 18-
point font, boldfaced, all caps — would be my
future: "SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING."
It could have been so beautiful. .. and painful.
I snapped out of my Obi Wan fantasy long
enough to realize that I don't want to be an engi
neer. Ever. I hate vectors; it's as simple as that.
I may not come home every day to an answer
ing machine full of job offers, but I am graduat
ing in under four years. And at least I, like my
older sister, broke the wicked chain of English
majors that has plagued my family. No doubt, in
five years I'll feel like Noam Chomsky is control
ling the minds of Americans everywhere
through the airways, but what the hell!
And, like a wise man once told me, "You don't
need a degree to be a drug dealer." So at least I've
got that going for me. Which is nice.
