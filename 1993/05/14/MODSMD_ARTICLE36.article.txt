# Looking forward with hope, looking back with pride
## Campus braces for the deluge Preparations underway for three-day graduation extravaganza 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
The University's Events and Services
staff has been working since January to
prepare for the nearly 30,000 parents,
faculty and students that will flood the
Farm during Commencement weekend.
Margarita Ibarra, an Events and Ser
vices administrative assistant, said that
between 25,000 and 30,000 people are
expected to attend the graduation cere
mony.
Commencement celebrations will
begin with campus tours on Friday, June
11 and end with the graduation ceremony
on Sunday, June 13.
To help compensate for the dearth of
local hotels and housing, dorm rooms in
Branner, Florence Moore and Stern Halls
will be used to house visiting family mem
bers, at a cost of $35 to $70 per night.
Residential Education is offering grad
uation housing as a "convenient alterna
tive" for visiting relatives, said Branner
Residence Office Coordinator Jody
Nyberg.
Although the deadline for room reser
vations has passed, Nyberg is still taking
names for the waiting list.
Departmental ceremonies will be held
at campus locations "where there is an
appropriate space to accommodate the
number of nonnle attending." said Ibarra.
For example, civil engineering mcyors
will receive their diplomas in Memorial
Auditorium and chemistry majors will
receive their diplomas in Braun Music
Center. The Graduate School of Business
will hold their ceremony in Frost
Amphitheater.

Events and Services will hire 60 stu
dents to help set up for commencement
activities. The temporary staff will per
form technical preparations and janitori
al tasks.
The Saturday morning Baccalaureate
service will feature Roy I. Sano, a United
Methodist bishop from Los Angeles. The
service will be held in Frost Amphithe
ater.

Commencement celebra
tions will begin with cam
pus tours on Friday, June
11 and end with the grad
uation ceremony on Sun
day, June 13.

The senior class presidents will speak
at Class Day, the Saturday afternoon lun
cheon held at Bowman Alumni house.
The luncheon will provide a "look into the
future," senior class President Tina Hua
said.
Donald Kennedy, Jean Fetter and Con
doleeza Rice have also been invited to
speak at the luncheon because these indi
viduals were "really influential" while the
class of 1993 attended Stanford, Hua said.
The presidents haven't yet chosen a
senior gift because the"budget could
range so much," depending on the profit
or loss from the Senior Formal, she said.
Hua added that the presidents are "really

open to suggestions. '
• The presidents plan to include ID
cards, newspaper clippings and a piece of
a building damaged in the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake in a time capsule that
will be buried in the Inner Quad. Gradu
ating classes have been placing such cap
sules under the Quad's tile walkways
since 1896.
At the commencement ceremony, a
doctoral student in the Music Depart
ment will conduct America the Beautiful
and the Stanford Mendicants will per
form the Stanford Hymn.
The Commencement address will be
delivered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Her
speech will be followed by the presenta
tion of awards. Provost Gerald Lieber
man and the deans of each of the gradu
ate schools will confer degrees, presenting
their candidates to University President
Gerhard Casper.
This year's Commencement is Stan
ford's 102 nd. The first Commencement
ceremony was held in 1892, in the half
completed Roble Gym. As the student
body grew, the ceremony moved from
Roble to Memorial Church to Frost
Amphitheater.
Commencement was held in Frost
Amphitheater from 1938 until 1983. In
1984, the ceremony was held in Sunken
Diamond, moving to Stanford Stadium in
1985. Until the move to the stadium,
thousands of ticket requests were denied
each year due to lack of seating space.
Until the 19705, the University presi
dent presented diplomas during the Com
mencement ceremony. When the ceremo
ny grew too long, diplomas were awarded
in departmental ceremonies.
