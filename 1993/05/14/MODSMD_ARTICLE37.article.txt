# Communities plan Commencement events
## Food, folks and fun 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Stanford's various ethnic communi
ties are in the process of planning sever
al upcoming Commencement-weekend
activities, including dinners, dances and
cultural programs to honor the achieve
ments of 1993 minority graduates.
Organizers agree that Commence
ment celebrates not only the students'
accomplishments, but also those of their
immediate and extended families.
All events are open to the public,
though tickets to some festivities must
be purchased in advance.
The Chicano/Latino community's
main event will be an awards ceremony
from 1 to 4 p.m. on June 12. Edward
James Olmos will be the keynote speak
er at the presentation to be held in Kres
ge Auditorium, according to junior Ser
gio Reyes, who is in charge of organizing
the event.
Reyes said students as well as parents
will receive certificates, and some stu
dents will be rewarded for service and
leadership in the Chicano/Latino com
munity.
"Particularly for our community, this
is really appropriate because some of the
parents don't speak English," he said.
"Through a ceremony like this, they get
the meaning of graduation — they're not
just going through the motions."
After the awards ceremony, the com
munity will host a banquet at Ford Cen
ter featuring music, entertainment from

Ballet Folklorico de Stanford and a dance
afterward, Reyes said. The price of tick
ets for the dinner will depend on how
much money is raised between now and
the end of the year, he added.
A reception is tentatively planned for
Sunday, June 13 outside El Centro Chi
cano, from 2 to 4 p.m., but Reyes said
that because of budget constraints, the
reception may be cancelled.
The African-American community is
planning a graduation program in
Memorial Church, at 7 p.m. on June 12.
Alumnus Tracy Lawrence, director of
marketing for MTV, will be the keynote
speaker, joined by student and adminis
trative speakers.
After the celebration, the community
will host a reception in the Castano din
ing hall, complete with food and enter
tainment. No ticket purchases are
required.
"I'm very excited, as all the black
seniors are," said Lydia Jones, one of the
event's organizers. "We all look forward
to meeting one another's families before
graduation."
Jones said this type of celebration
has been held for many years, adding
that the events try to involve the stu
dents' families as much as possible,
while honoring the achievements of the
seniors.
"The events are to celebrate the stu
dents, but it is a time for the families to
be proud too," she said. "The two
aren't completely separate."
Also on June 12, the Native
American community will host a
dinner for graduates and their
families. Native American grad
uates will be honored for their
accomplishments and presented
with thick wool Pendelton blan
kets, which have been signifi
cant in Native American tribes
for many years, according to
Myra Parker, co-chair of the
Stanford American Indian Orga

nization.
Tickets are $5 for the dinner,
which will be held at the Old
Union Clubhouse at 6 p.m.
Jim Larimore, director of the
Native American Cultural Center,
will likely speak at the dinner,
along with a keynote speaker to be
announced, Parker said. Family
members of graduates will also be
invited to speak, Larimore said.
Parker stressed the impor
tance of the involvement of the
family in the festivities. "When
one is honored, the whole family
is," she said.
Larimore said the program has
evolved from a small reception to
a larger dinner as the number of

Native American graduates has
increased. He attributed the suc
cess of the dinners to a feeling of
closeness within the community.
Stanford's Asian-American
community will hold a commence
ment dinner June 12 at 5 p.m. in
Christine Ricker Dining and Per
formance Center.
The dinner, which usually
attracts several hundred people,
has been held for the past four
years, said Cindy Ng, the event's
coordinator.
The evening will include a
speaker, presentation of awards
to seniors and a cultural perfor
mance, she said, with tickets cost
ing $10.
