# Parker, head of multicultural development, quits abruptly
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, resigned yesterday and was
immediately replaced by Judith
Little, an associate director in the
Office of Development.
According to a University state
ment, Parker resigned for person
al reasons, including the fact that
she has been commuting between
Stanford and the Washington,
D.C., area, where her family lives,
since coming to the University in
1990.
Parker would not comment on
her resignation.
In order to evaluate the Multi
cultural Development Office's fu
ture and the qualifications desired
in a new director, University Pres-

ident Gerhard
Casper has com
missioned Assoc.
Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences
A 1 Camarillo to
form a committee
that will evaluate
the goals and
functions of the
office.

Casper told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that Parker's "resigna
tion has nothing to do with my
changing the Office of Multicul
tural Development," and that she
was leaving to be with her family.
"It was a bit of a surprise," said
Clare Phillips, associate director
of the Office of Multicultural De
velopement. "We got information
that Sharon resigned and I guess
we have to take it at that."

Camarillo said
he would miss
Parker. "I valued
her as a friend,"
he said. "It's a
question of a de
cision on her part
and I don't know
the details, but it
definitely leaves
a void."

Vice President for Faculty and
Staff Services Barbara Butterfield
said she understands the pres
sures of commuting between a job
and family, adding that she real
izes many commuters reach a
"breaking point."
But Butterfield said she hoped
Parker's departure would not af
fect the University's emphasis on

multicultural issues. "I don't
want to see us lose our commit
ment to multiculturalism," But
terfield said. "I haven't heard
anything that makes me think
we will, but I just think we need
to re-emphasize that commit
ment.
"Sharon got so many things
done. I just don't want to lose that
momentum," she added.
However, Butterfield added
that she looks forward to working
with Little, whom she described
as "action-oriented."
Little, who will serve as acting
director until a permanent
replacement is chosen, said she is
bringing "about 20 years of expe

rience in the Stanford community
to this job."
Her experience includes work
as the associate dean of graduate
studies and an associate affirma
tive action officer. She also served
as chair of the African-American
Staff Group at Stanford in 1991-
92.
She has earned master's
degrees in both drama and psy
chology from Stanford, as well as
a doctorate in psychology from
Cornell University.
"I'd like to evaluate where
things are before deciding on any
goals," Little said. "When I talked
to Mr. Casper, the first thing he
said was he wasn't clear how long
this acting directorship would
last."
However, she added that she
was committed to improving the
University's stance on multicul

tural issues.
"The minority communities, as
well as the gay, lesbian, bisexual
and disabled communities are
eager to see some advancements
in career opportunities and affir
mative action as well as full par
ticipation in the University," she
said.
Although the advisory group is
still in its early stages and its
members have not been named,
Camarillo said it will look at the
role and future of the Office of
Multicultural Development.
The group "is to look at the
office, the roles and duties of the
office," he said, adding that it is
too early to pinpoint specific
issues.
"It'll be an assessment ... of
the historical role of that office,"
said Camarillo. "What I see as my
first role is to see the origins and

changes of that office and to see
where that office is now in 1993
and where it should go in the
future as far as issues such as
affirmative action."
Camarillo said Casper asked
him to head the group because of
his role as chair of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
and his interest in multicultural
affairs.
Phillips said she felt the group
provides a good opportunity for
the Stanford community. "We
really haven't had much direction
over the last couple years. I think
it's the right time to evaluate,"
she said.
"I think a lot will hinge on the
outcome of Camarillo's commit
tee."
