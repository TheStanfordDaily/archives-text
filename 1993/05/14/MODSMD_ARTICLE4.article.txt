# Parker, head of multicultural development, quits abruptly
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, resigned yesterday and was
immediately replaced by Judith
Little, an associate director in the
Office of Development.
According to a University state
ment, Parker resigned for person
al reasons, including the fact that
she has been commuting between
Stanford and the Washington,
D.C., area, where her family lives,
since coming to the University in
1990.
Parker would not comment on
her resignation.
In order to evaluate the Multi
cultural Development Office's fu
ture and the qualifications desired
in a new director, University Pres-

ident Gerhard
Casper has com
missioned Assoc.
Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences
A 1 Camarillo to
form a committee
that will evaluate
the goals and
functions of the
office.

Casper told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that Parker's "resigna
tion has nothing to do with my
changing the Office of Multicul
tural Development," and that she
was leaving to be with her family.
"It was a bit of a surprise," said
Clare Phillips, associate director
of the Office of Multicultural De
velopement. "We got information
that Sharon resigned and I guess
we have to take it at that."

Camarillo said
he would miss
Parker. "I valued
her as a friend,"
he said. "It's a
question of a de
cision on her part
and I don't know
the details, but it
definitely leaves
a void."

Vice President for Faculty and
Staff Services Barbara Butterfield
said she understands the pres
sures of commuting between a job
and family, adding that she real
izes many commuters reach a
"breaking point."
But Butterfield said she hoped
Parker's departure would not af
fect the University's emphasis on


Little
