# Sen. Feinstein to address graduates
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one of
California's first two female U.S.
senators and a Stanford alumna,
has been chosen as this year's
commencement speaker.
"Sen. Feinstein combines all
the qualities of an ideal com
mencement speaker," University
President Gerhard Casper said in
a statement. "She is a leader in
many senses of the word: a pio
neer, a person of authority and
influence. She possesses both
high intellect and down-to-earth
realism. And she is, we can be
proud to say, a Stanford gradu
ate."
Feinstein, who graduated from
Stanford in 1955, was selected as
speaker for the University's
102 nd commencement by Casper
from a long list of candidates
drawn up by the four senior class
presidents.
"It was a significant list .. .
not as large as the Stanford appli
cant pool or the freshman class,
but enough to give Casper some
choice," said Jean Fetter,
Casper's special assistant.
According to senior class presi
dent Jason Dicks, the list includ
ed a "broad-based" group of peo
ple, many of whom were minori
ties and women from all different
fields and political circles.
Students, faculty and adminis

trators alike were enthusiastic
about the choice of Feinstein.
"We're really pleased. This is
definitely a choice that will be
well received by the senior class,"
Dicks said. He added that in
informal surveys of the class,
Feinstein was a favorite for
commencement speaker.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said the senator was an
ideal choice. "She's someone who
holds high political office and she
should have some interesting
things to say."
After Feinstein graduated
from Stanford, her work as an
intern specializing in criminal
justice led then-Gov. Edmund
Brown to appoint her to the Cali
fornia Women's Board of Terms
and Parole. In 1969, she was
elected to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and eventu
ally became board president.
After the assassination of
then-Mayor George R. Moscone
on Nov. 27, 1978, the board voted
to make Feinstein mayor of San
Francisco. She was re-elected
twice.
In the 1990 race for California
governor, Feinstein, the demo
cratic nominee, narrowly lost to
then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, cur
rently governor of the state. But
last November she was elected as
a California representative to the
U.S. Senate, becoming one of the
first two women ever to hold that
position. Feinstein now occupies a
seat on the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee.
Brody also noted that, as Stan
ford has had more male speakers
than female in the past, "it's good
to get a gender balance."
Past commencement speakers
have included modern art authori
ty Kirk Varnedoe in 1992, Haas
Centennial Professor of Public
Service founder John Gardner in
1991 and "Doonesbury" cartoonist

Garry Trudeau in 1989.
Many say that Feinstein's posi
tion as a successful woman in poli
tics makes her a good role model
for students.
"Having a woman speaker is
important," said Britt Wahlin, a
sophomore who was active in
Anna Eshoo's campaign last fall.
"Now that the elections are over,
people think that women have
made their gain. This is a good
reminder that women have a long
way to go and to recognize some
one who's doing well."
But Deborah Castler, president of
Stanford Democrats said Feinstein
"is a role model for both men and
women," regardless of political affili
ation. "She exemplifies the heights

we can attain in public service."
Many say they are also pleased
because Fein stein is a well-known
personality. Students in previous
years have complained that com
mencement speakers were not
prominent figures.
In addition, many say Feinstein
is an especially appealing choice
because she is a Stanford graduate.
In her time here, Diane Goldman
was a history major and was elect
ed president of Roble Hall, 1953
Quad yearbook queen and the 1954
vice-president of the ASSU.
"I think it's wonderfully appro
priate. Feinstein is a pioneer in
what she's done, and a nice role
model for Stanford students as a
Stanford alum," Fetter said.
