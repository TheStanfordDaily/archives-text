# Diplomas shed skins for paper
## Cheaper cardboard sleeves to replace traditional 'leather' covers 
### John Ford 
Leather diploma covers, a traditional
standard on graduation day, will never
touch the hands of the graduating class
of 1993.
At a savings of $3 per student, the
University will replace the covers,
which are actually made of vinyl, with a
textured cardboard sleeve this year.
"It will be quite presentable, and it
will save about $13,000," said Acting
Registrar Jack Farrell. "It's not tacky or
anything — it will have an embossed
seal on the outside."
The cut will make up only a fraction
of the Registrar's Office's $329,000 tar
geted budget reduction, Farrell said.
Most of the office's cuts so far have
come in the area of classroom improve

ment, where it has begun trimming
expenditures by $140,000.
Farrell said the office considered two
other options to replace the diploma
covers, but decided the textured card
board sleeve was the most logical choice.
One option would have replaced the
covers with "a really cheap paper enve
lope — we can get those free," Farrell
said. "But that's just a little too tacky."
The other option would have been to
use "leather," as in the current covers,
eliminating the padding and satin lin
ing, Farrell said. "But that really
wouldn't save us enough."
The Registrar's Office has already
reduced its staff in the budget-cutting
process. The cost of the diploma covers
is roughly equivalent to the salary of
one part-time employee, Farrell said.

Farrell said he believes the covers were
simply "the most logical thing to cut,"
noting that most diplomas eventually end
up in frames or stored in an attic.
Farrell added that if the University
could also save a significant amount of
money by waiting until after graduation
to distribute the actual diplomas,
instead of during the ceremony.
The current procedure requires the
Registrar's Office to rush the prepara
tion of diplomas, including those of stu
dents who do not actually graduate.
By distributing diplomas later, the
registrar could also avoid this "huge
logistical undertaking," Farrell said.
However, the Registrar's Office ulti
mately decided that giving students fake
diplomas would take more away from the
ceremony than replacing the vinyl covers.
