# Taking the campus tour sitting down
## A 						guide's-eye view of what visitors to Stanford hear about the Farm 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Hello and welcome to Stanford. I'm your
tour guide, and I'll be leading you on a no
stress, no-effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk backwards
through most of the tour, and while I've got
ten good at avoiding large, non-moving things
like buildings, I have trouble with small chil
dren, bicycles, animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me when I'm
about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the front of the
Quad, at Memorial Court. Directly behind you
is Palm Drive, the main entrance to the Uni
versity. It's lined with 150 palm trees, which
incidentally aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial Court
toward the center of the the Main Quad, I'd
like to give you a quick refresher on Stanford
history.
Jane and Leland Stanford founded the Uni
versity in 1885 in memory of their only son,
Leland Stanford, Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th birthday.

Contrary to popular belief, the Stanfords
never offered the president of Harvard or Yale
a suitcase full of money in exchange for a
building in little Leland's name.
They built their school on the site of their
8,200-acre Palo Alto Stock Farm, where they
had raised championship trotters, a type of
race horse. In their founding grant, the Stan
ford decreed that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and, indeed, much of "The Farm" still
remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the center of the
Quad. Surrounding you are the 12 original
buildings of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the school
opened in 1891. The 16 Outer Quad buildings
and Memorial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house many of the
departments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences. Most of the technical divisions, like
physics, engineering and biology, moved west
of the Quad as their need for larger research
facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in front of you,
was built by Jane Stanford in memory of her
husband, who died in 1893, only two years
after the University opened. The church orig

inally had a 90-foot spire atop it, housing a
large clock and four bells. During the 1906
San Francisco earthquake, the spire crashed
down into the center of the church, blowing
out the front wall and destroying most of the
building. Miraculously, the bells and clock
survived the fall. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and continue to
chime today.
Unfortunately, when the church was
rebuilt and reopened in 1913, the original cen
tral support system was left intact. During the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the keystone,
the central supporting stone of the church's
main arches, slipped an inch out of place. Four
years and $10 million went into the recon
struction of the church, which reopened its
doors last October. The 7,777-pipe organ, the
sparkling gold leaf and the California Red
wood ceilings are now a part of the many reli
gious services, weddings and visitor walk
throughs that take place in Memorial Church.
Let's skirt our way around the church and
head for the cornerstone, located at the corner
of Building 60. The Stanfords insisted on lay-

ing this first stone of the University on
May 14, 1887, which would have been
their son's 19th birthday.
You're probably wondering what all
these numbered plaques are at your
feet; this is the one question that just
about every tour group asks. These
plaques actually begin in front of the
church, and each one is dedicated by the
senior class the day before Commence
ment. The class of 1896 started the tra
dition, but '92 through '95 didn't want
to be left out, so they placed theirs
retroactively. The plaques will continue
around the Inner Quad until they once
again reach the front of the church in
2403, 512 plaques later. Former Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy person
ally counted the spaces when he was
provost in 1980.
Each plaque covers a time capsule
containing memorabilia chosen by the
senior class. The contents include
things like Stanford IDs, newspapers,
record albums and even cans of soda,
commemorating the change in Coca-
Cola's formula.
We'll head for White Plaza now,
where much of the social activity on

campus takes place. Notice all the tables
set up by various student groups pro
moting plays and concerts, political
causes, clubs, sports and countless
other activities. Sometimes rock bands
play in White Plaza or up on the Tresid
der Union patio, which you can see to
your right.
Behind me is Braun Music Center,
constructed in 1982 to house the
Department of Music. Behind you to the
left is Old Union, formerly the student
union, but now the student services cen
ter. Old Union was built with funds pro
vided by former U.S. President Herbert
Hoover, a Stanford alumnus.
As we exit White Plaza, the way we
came, you'll notice White Memorial
Fountain on your left. Actually, I didn't
even know it was named that until I
became a tour guide, since everybody
(and I do mean everybody) here calls it
"The Claw." The Claw is the ultimate
fountain for fountain-hopping, since it
sprays water in all directions and it's
very easy to climb.
Every year during Big Game Week, a
stuffed bear (usually of the teddy vari
ety) is impaled upon the top spike of The
Claw by the drum major of the Stanford
Band. The "Bearial," held on a Monday
in late November, is the kickoff event of
the spirit activities leading up to Big
Game.

On your right is the Stanford Book
store, a newly renovated facility that
claims to be one of the largest college
bookstores in the nation. The main level
contains nothing but books, books and
more books. This doesn't even include
the textbooks section in the basement.
A computer store, a cafe, a photo lab,
school and office supplies, plus every
thing that's ever had the Stanford name
stamped on it can also be found in the
Bookstore.
Curving between the Bookstore and
the Career Planning and Placement
Center (which used to be the Book
store), we head for the front of the
Meyer library, one of Stanford's numer
ous libraries. Stanford holdings include
over 5.7 million volumes housed in 40
special libraries. Most libraries contain
specialized holdings — physics, art,
law, etc. — but Meyer and Green (the
library over there on the left) are two
general reference libraries.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin col
lection, the second largest in the world.
While most of the Rodins are in the B.
Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden,
next to the Art Museum, "The Thinker"
was placed in front to Meyer for, I sup
pose, inspirational purposes.

After curving around Green,
we conclude our tour at the foot of
Hoover Tower, one of the build
ings of the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, a
major research center for social,
political and economic change in
the 20th century. The Tower is
primarily a library, separate from
the University's holdings. Stand

ing 285 feet tall, the Tower fea
tures an observation platform
that provides an aerial view of the
campus and a substantial portion
of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memori
al Hall, a large auditorium built in
1936 to honor students and faculty
who died in World War I. The lobby
is inscribed with their names, as
well as the names of those who died
in World War 11, the Korean War
and the Vietnam War.
Mem Aud, as it is commonly
called, features a 200-seat Little

Theater for major Drama Depart
ment productions and a large,
1,700-seat auditorium used for
lectures, religious services, special
performing arts events and the
weekly Sunday Flicks, a tradition
that involves movies, paper fights
and shouting at the screen.
If there are no more questions,
I'd like to conclude the tour and
wish you a pleasant stay at Stan
ford. I'm walking back to our
starting point to get my bike, so if
you're completely lost, feel free to
follow me.

play in White Plaza or up on the Tresid
der Union patio, which you can see to
your right.
Behind me is Braun Music Center,
constructed in 1982 to house the
Department of Music. Behind you to the
left is Old Union, formerly the student
union, but now the student services cen
ter. Old Union was built with funds pro
vided by former U.S. President Herbert
Hoover, a Stanford alumnus.
As we exit White Plaza, the way we
came, you'll notice White Memorial
Fountain on your left. Actually, I didn't
even know it was named that until I
became a tour guide, since everybody
(and I do mean everybody) here calls it
"The Claw." The Claw is the ultimate
fountain for fountain-hopping, since it
sprays water in all directions and it's
very easy to climb.
Every year during Big Game Week, a
stuffed bear (usually of the teddy vari
ety) is impaled upon the top spike of The
Claw by the drum major of the Stanford
Band. The "Bearial," held on a Monday
in late November, is the kickoff event of
the spirit activities leading up to Big
Game.

On your right is the Stanford Book
store, a newly renovated facility that
claims to be one of the largest college
bookstores in the nation. The main level
contains nothing but books, books and
more books. This doesn't even include
the textbooks section in the basement.
A computer store, a cafe, a photo lab,
school and office supplies, plus every
thing that's ever had the Stanford name
stamped on it can also be found in the
Bookstore.
Curving between the Bookstore and
the Career Planning and Placement
Center (which used to be the Book
store), we head for the front of the
Meyer library, one of Stanford's numer
ous libraries. Stanford holdings include
over 5.7 million volumes housed in 40
special libraries. Most libraries contain
specialized holdings — physics, art,
law, etc. — but Meyer and Green (the
library over there on the left) are two
general reference libraries.
Right next to us is Rodin's "The
Thinker," part of Stanford's Rodin col
lection, the second largest in the world.
While most of the Rodins are in the B.
Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden,
next to the Art Museum, "The Thinker"
was placed in front to Meyer for, I sup
pose, inspirational purposes.

After curving around Green,
we conclude our tour at the foot of
Hoover Tower, one of the build
ings of the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, a
major research center for social,
political and economic change in
the 20th century. The Tower is
primarily a library, separate from
the University's holdings. Stand

ing 285 feet tall, the Tower fea
tures an observation platform
that provides an aerial view of the
campus and a substantial portion
of the Bay Area.
Finally, to your right is Memori
al Hall, a large auditorium built in
1936 to honor students and faculty
who died in World War I. The lobby
is inscribed with their names, as
well as the names of those who died
in World War 11, the Korean War
and the Vietnam War.
Mem Aud, as it is commonly
called, features a 200-seat Little

Theater for major Drama Depart
ment productions and a large,
1,700-seat auditorium used for
lectures, religious services, special
performing arts events and the
weekly Sunday Flicks, a tradition
that involves movies, paper fights
and shouting at the screen.
If there are no more questions,
I'd like to conclude the tour and
wish you a pleasant stay at Stan
ford. I'm walking back to our
starting point to get my bike, so if
you're completely lost, feel free to
follow me.

Hello and welcome to Stanford. I'm your
tour guide, and I'll be leading you on a no
stress, no-effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk backwards
through most of the tour, and while I've got
ten good at avoiding large, non-moving things
like buildings, I have trouble with small chil
dren, bicycles, animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me when I'm
about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the front of the
Quad, at Memorial Court. Directly behind you
is Palm Drive, the main entrance to the Uni
versity. It's lined with 150 palm trees, which
incidentally aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial Court
toward the center of the the Main Quad, I'd
like to give you a quick refresher on Stanford
history.
Jane and Leland Stanford founded the Uni
versity in 1885 in memory of their only son,
Leland Stanford, Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th birthday.

Contrary to popular belief, the Stanfords
never offered the president of Harvard or Yale
a suitcase full of money in exchange for a
building in little Leland's name.
They built their school on the site of their
8,200-acre Palo Alto Stock Farm, where they
had raised championship trotters, a type of
race horse. In their founding grant, the Stan
ford decreed that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and, indeed, much of "The Farm" still
remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the center of the
Quad. Surrounding you are the 12 original
buildings of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the school
opened in 1891. The 16 Outer Quad buildings
and Memorial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house many of the
departments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences. Most of the technical divisions, like
physics, engineering and biology, moved west
of the Quad as their need for larger research
facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in front of you,
was built by Jane Stanford in memory of her
husband, who died in 1893, only two years
after the University opened. The church orig

inally had a 90-foot spire atop it, housing a
large clock and four bells. During the 1906
San Francisco earthquake, the spire crashed
down into the center of the church, blowing
out the front wall and destroying most of the
building. Miraculously, the bells and clock
survived the fall. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and continue to
chime today.
Unfortunately, when the church was
rebuilt and reopened in 1913, the original cen
tral support system was left intact. During the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the keystone,
the central supporting stone of the church's
main arches, slipped an inch out of place. Four
years and $10 million went into the recon
struction of the church, which reopened its
doors last October. The 7,777-pipe organ, the
sparkling gold leaf and the California Red
wood ceilings are now a part of the many reli
gious services, weddings and visitor walk
throughs that take place in Memorial Church.
Let's skirt our way around the church and
head for the cornerstone, located at the corner
of Building 60. The Stanfords insisted on lay-

ing this first stone of the University on
May 14, 1887, which would have been
their son's 19th birthday.
You're probably wondering what all
these numbered plaques are at your
feet; this is the one question that just
about every tour group asks. These
plaques actually begin in front of the
church, and each one is dedicated by the
senior class the day before Commence
ment. The class of 1896 started the tra
dition, but '92 through '95 didn't want
to be left out, so they placed theirs
retroactively. The plaques will continue
around the Inner Quad until they once
again reach the front of the church in
2403, 512 plaques later. Former Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy person
ally counted the spaces when he was
provost in 1980.
Each plaque covers a time capsule
containing memorabilia chosen by the
senior class. The contents include
things like Stanford IDs, newspapers,
record albums and even cans of soda,
commemorating the change in Coca-
Cola's formula.
We'll head for White Plaza now,
where much of the social activity on

campus takes place. Notice all the tables
set up by various student groups pro
moting plays and concerts, political
causes, clubs, sports and countless
other activities. Sometimes rock bands
play in White Plaza or up on the Tresid
der Union patio, which you can see to
your right.
Behind me is Braun Music Center,
constructed in 1982 to house the
Department of Music. Behind you to the
