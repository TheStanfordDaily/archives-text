# Taking the campus tour sitting down
## A
						guide's-eye view of what visitors to Stanford hear about the Farm 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Hello and welcome to Stanford. I'm your
tour guide, and I'll be leading you on a no
stress, no-effort tour of the campus. I have
only one request to make: I walk backwards
through most of the tour, and while I've got
ten good at avoiding large, non-moving things
like buildings, I have trouble with small chil
dren, bicycles, animals, vehicles and the like.
Please help me out by warning me when I'm
about to hurt myself.
We'll begin our tour at the front of the
Quad, at Memorial Court. Directly behind you
is Palm Drive, the main entrance to the Uni
versity. It's lined with 150 palm trees, which
incidentally aren't indigenous to the region
and must be imported.
As we move through Memorial Court
toward the center of the the Main Quad, I'd
like to give you a quick refresher on Stanford
history.
Jane and Leland Stanford founded the Uni
versity in 1885 in memory of their only son,
Leland Stanford, Jr., who died of typhoid
fever one month before his 16th birthday.

Contrary to popular belief, the Stanfords
never offered the president of Harvard or Yale
a suitcase full of money in exchange for a
building in little Leland's name.
They built their school on the site of their
8,200-acre Palo Alto Stock Farm, where they
had raised championship trotters, a type of
race horse. In their founding grant, the Stan
ford decreed that no Stanford land could ever
be sold, and, indeed, much of "The Farm" still
remains open land.
We'll stop for a minute in the center of the
Quad. Surrounding you are the 12 original
buildings of the Inner Quad, the part of the
University that existed when the school
opened in 1891. The 16 Outer Quad buildings
and Memorial Church were added by 1903.
Today, these buildings house many of the
departments of the School of Humanities and
Sciences. Most of the technical divisions, like
physics, engineering and biology, moved west
of the Quad as their need for larger research
facilities grew.
Memorial Church, directly in front of you,
was built by Jane Stanford in memory of her
husband, who died in 1893, only two years
after the University opened. The church orig

inally had a 90-foot spire atop it, housing a
large clock and four bells. During the 1906
San Francisco earthquake, the spire crashed
down into the center of the church, blowing
out the front wall and destroying most of the
building. Miraculously, the bells and clock
survived the fall. They now stand at the
southwest corner of the Quad and continue to
chime today.
Unfortunately, when the church was
rebuilt and reopened in 1913, the original cen
tral support system was left intact. During the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the keystone,
the central supporting stone of the church's
main arches, slipped an inch out of place. Four
years and $10 million went into the recon
struction of the church, which reopened its
doors last October. The 7,777-pipe organ, the
sparkling gold leaf and the California Red
wood ceilings are now a part of the many reli
gious services, weddings and visitor walk
throughs that take place in Memorial Church.
Let's skirt our way around the church and
head for the cornerstone, located at the corner
of Building 60. The Stanfords insisted on lay-
