# Welcome to reality, now go home
## 
### 
I know exactly where you're going to
be this summer. And it ain't pretty.
Your alarm clock will go off at about
the same time Willard Scott is choosing
between a cruller and a fritter. Maybe
"choosing" is the wrong word. Anyway,
you'll slowly turn around in your big,
empty bed and reach for the snooze but
ton like a defeated, Pavlovian Ferris
Bueller.
At this point in the story, your new,
high-powered corporate job and my
tranquil finish-the-degree-over-the
summer existence seem pretty similar,
if financially dichotomous.
But the difference between you and I
is that when I tell those annoying Lam
ont and Tennelli guys to shut up, they'll
shut up. Meanwhile, you'll be dragging
yourself out of bed and blow-drying
your hair for a 9 o'clock you're not
allowed to skip.
I know what you're thinking: "Joel,
people don't really blow-dry their hair
any more, do they?"
Yes, my little Horatio Algers, people
do blow-dry their hair in the real world.
They also shower instead of trying to
get by with that deodorant-and-a-base
ball-cap excuse for avant-guard fashion.
And they make meaningless, disenfran
chised, kiss-up small talk about their
bosses' hair.
While I'm out frolicking with my
friends, enjoying an afternoon of Intra
mural Hot-Oil Wrestling, you'll be with
your fellow workers — meekly volleying

lines from last weekend's "Saturday
Night Live" over your tiny cubicle walls.
Because as much as you promise
yourself not to, you will watch televi
sion. And I'm not just talking about
"Studs" and "David Letterman." I'm
talking the whole big, ugly, hour-long,
morality-play-influenced ball of wax.
I'm talking "Melrose Place."
And eventually, you'll come to the
frightening realization that it's cheaper
and less embarrassing to subscribe to
TV Guide. And not too long after that,
you'll start skimming the articles. And
you'll relate to your parents a whole lot
better than you have in a long, long
while:
"But Mom, I thought Cathy Lee

should of actually been given a 'cheer'
for self-promoting her new album."
"Me too, son. I love you."
"I love you too."
Sure, you'll try to stem the tide.
You'll begin doing things on a regular
basis that you've only seen in James
Spader movies. You'll "go dancing" in
the city or "hang out" at a bar or "exper
iment" with Stuart Reges.
But deep in your heart, you'll know
that all this while, you're getting old.
Your Blockbuster bills will increase
substantially. You'll know who Conan
O'Brien is having on several days in
advance. And in your desperate attempt
to build a social life, you'll invite people
over for "dinner parties."
You will go to garage sales. You will
notice other people's wallpaper when
you visit their homes. You will read
local papers and consider joining
"clubs." You will eat pasta at an uncom
fortably regular rate.
Worst of all, you will go to your
friends' weddings. And your parents
will start to nag you about getting into a
serious relationship. And you'll grab the
safest partner you can, call it love, buy a
cake and send fancy, engraved invita
tions to all your relatives with the all
too-obvious subtext: "I'd like you to
meet the person I am having sex with on
a regular basis."
But not me, babe. I'll be free. No wife

Joel Stein
to worry about, no boss to report
to, no handiwipes to run over
small, unsanitary bottoms. The
only thing on my mind will be per
fecting my already-impressive
clarinet skills. And volleyball.
Lots of volleyball.
No landlords to deal with, no
refrigerator shelves to divvy up
and no undue excitement over
double coupon days.

I'll be living in a dorm room,
surrounded by people my own
age, people who are hip to the
whole college scene.
So while you're at some bar,
searching for an excuse not to
give your phone number to mid
dle-aged, single parents with a lit
tle too much Dep in their notice
ably too-young haircut, I'll be
enjoying EANABS at a party con
veniently located just a couple of
blocks away.
But deep inside I'll be jealous.
You'll be making money. You'll be
in control of your lives. You'll

redefine the word autonomy and
not worry about having to get the
spelling right. Your free time will
be completely yours. And you'll
finally have the time to dedicate
to finding out what's going on in
the real word, and how "Hard
Copy" feels about that issue.
Should have gone to grad
school, eh?
