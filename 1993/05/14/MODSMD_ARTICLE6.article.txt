# Bigger Draw groups for disabled students
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Disabled students are applauding the Hous
ing Center's recent decision to allow them to
draw for housing with up to seven other
friends, instead of just one as in previous years.
But now some non-disabled students in
smaller houses are worried that the new rules
will preclude them from redrawing into their
current residences.
The decision to allow students with disabil
ities to have eight-person Draw groups is part
of an overall University effort to increase hous
ing equity for disabled students.
"This is quite a breakthrough," said Molly
Sandperl, director of the Disability Resource
Center.
According to DRC program coordinator
John Asheim, disabled students in the past
"had to go so far as to justify the one roommate
that they wanted to bring to the Draw — they
could only have one friend."
Students with a disability now can petition
the DRC for priority housing assignments with
a full Draw group. Applicants must fill out a
form listing their top eight housing prefer
ences as well as past residences and special
needs.
Sophomore Muffy Davis, who uses a wheel
chair, said she is pleased with the change. "I
think it's great and long overdue," she said.

"Last year I ended up drawing with two others,
which was unusual. . .. We had to fight to be
able to do that."
Housing Center Director Bill Georges said
about 35 undergraduates received some sort of
priority because of their disabilities this year.
Twenty-five of these avoided the Draw entirely
and received their assignments last Friday; the
rest had to enter the spring housing lottery but
will receive some priority in their in-house
room assignments.
Only a fraction of petitions involved stu
dents in wheelchairs, according to Asheim. Al
lergies, sleep disorders and other medical con
ditions comprise many of the other exemp
tions, he said.
Right now, there is no set policy on what
kind of disabilities qualify, but petitioners
must have a "very specific letter" from a doc
tor, Asheim said.
The decision to allow disabled students to

draw with seven other persons, instead of only
one, came out of suggestions from a group with
the Dean of Students Office that is working on
ways to improve housing options for disabled
students.
But the move to increase housing equity for
these students also ended up filling a greater
number of housing slots before the Draw actu
ally began. And some non-disabled students
have expressed concern that they listed houses
on their Draw cards that have already been
partially filled by an exempt group.
Some residents in 675 Lomita, for instance,
were worried that they couldn't draw back in
to their house because many slots had been
filled by a group exempt from the Draw.
Kevin Smith, a resident assistant at 675
Lomita, explained that the house, which drew
around 1,200 for women last year, would be
difficult to draw into if large groups were as
signed to it early.
Georges explained that since the special
housing assignments were made last Friday,
there was not enough time to inform students.
Freshman Eryn Brown's draw group, which
has been assigned to Lomita, will take up seven
of the house's 26 slots for women. She ex
plained that she needs a house with a nearby
parking lot and a place to park her golf cart,
which she uses to get around campus.
"I wear full-length leg braces
because I don't have enough leg
muscle to support myself," she
explained, adding that she want
ed to live on the Row so she could
"meet a variety of people."
According to Sandperl, there
are only three disabled-accessible
houses on the Row: Lomita,
Xanadu and Storey.
"We're not out to beat the sys

tem," said Davis, who has been
assigned to Storey. "If the Uni
versity is willing to make all the
houses accessible, I'd be willing to
join the Draw."
Georges explained that the
Housing Center makes every
effort "to emulate how Draw
assignments are made. In a guar
anteed or preferred year, stu
dents get better housing."
Petitioners, who "have to
make a compelling case," may be
turned down if the disability can
be handled by most houses on
campus, Sand perl said.
