# Posters criticize Casper

Numerous copies of an anony
mous flier accusing University
President Gerhard Casper of un
dermining multiculturalism were
posted in the Quad Friday.
The flier charged that Sharon
Parker, former director of the Of
fice of Multicultural Develop
ment, was forced to resign and
Asst. History Prof. Gordon Chang
was denied tenure although his
department recommended him.
In addition, the flier men
tioned Casper's announcement
that a committee will look at un
dergraduate education next year.
"Undergraduate education (read
CIV) is being 'reevaluated,' " it
read.
The flier also stated that Dean
of the Law School Paul Brest
"asks for 'wholly internal review
panels' dealing with multicultur
al issues."
At the end, the flier read, "Wel
come to the New Stanford where
the winds of freedom blow." Mis
spelling the president's name, it
adds in larger letters, "!!! Heil
Caspar!!!"
Casper's response, issued Fri
day, stated, "While the flier leads
to a false conclusion, the winds of
freedom give each of us the right
to put an individual slant on mat
ters — true or false.
"And we can be thankful that
the author confined his or her eth
nic slurs to the president," he
added.
According to the flier, Parker
was forced to resign last week "for
sharing non-confidential infor
mation with students." A state
ment issued by the University
Thursday said that Parker re
signed for personal reasons.
"I haven't seen the flyer. ... I
am constrained to say anything
but I've resigned for personal rea
sons," said Parker. "There's a
wide range of personal reasons,
and I'm very grateful for the sup
port my family has given me while
I have been at Stanford."
Chang, one of Stanford's two
professors currently teaching
Asian-American studies classes,
is taking a leave of absence next
year. He was out of town over the
weekend and could not be
reached for comment.
History Department Chair
David Kennedy, however, con
firmed the details in the flier. "The
facts are that the History Depart
ment did recommend him and the
Dean (of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas) was not persuaded
by our case," Kennedy said.
Instead, according to
Kennedy, Chang has been offered
a four-year promotion to an asso
ciate professor without tenure.
Some members of the History
Department are writing to
Thomas in an effort to change his
mind, Kennedy added.
Brest criticized the flier for
discussing the internal multicul
tural review panels before any
official decision on them had been
reached. "I think the Stanford
community ought to wait and see
what the (University) Cabinet
does," before offering criticism,
Brest said.
The quotation about the
review panels in the flier comes
from a draft, authored by Brest,
of the University Cabinet's
response to the 1991 University
Committee on Minority Issues
review. The unofficial draft was
anonymously photocopied and
distributed to ethnic community
centers before cabinet discussion.
Students reacting to the
anonymous fliers said that while
they don't necessarily agree with
their tone, they understand the
reasoning behind them.
"I disagree with how [the accu
sation] was presented, but I think
it is substantially true," said senior
Harrison Hsieh, chair of the
Asian/Pacific Islanders for Educa
tion and Change at Stanford.
"To quite an extent I do agree
these things are happening, and
added up, they are not good for
Stanford."
In addition, freshman Vanessa
Alvarado said that she perceives
the frustration among those
responsible for the fliers.
"It just doesn't feel like this
administration is really paying
attention. They don't want to
hear what we have to say," she
said. "These things aren't a coin
cidence. It just feels like a move
ment within this administration.
It's frightening.
"Maybe [the flyer is] not the
best way to get to the administra
tion, but it doesn't seem like
[Casper] wants to listen to us any
other way," she continued.
"Maybe this way we'll catch his
attention — if he reads one."
