# 'Forcing the Stanford community to do some hard thinking'
## Events to examine barriers blacks face 
### Dina Updegraff 
Stanford students, staff and faculty will
have the chance to explore the social and eco
nomic barriers that confront black Ameri
cans during Malcolm X Week, which began
yesterday.
"Malcolm X Week 1993 will be dedicated
to forcing the Stanford community to do
some hard thinking," said junior Jason
Ambrose, a Black Student Union member
who is helping organize the event.
This year's theme, "To Marry Our

Thought to the Plight of the Poor and Job
less: By Any Means Necessary," was chosen
by the BSU to help spotlight some of the bar
riers that blacks face, Ambrose said.
Ambrose said the week's main event will
be a speech by Harold Cruse, former chair of
the Center for Afro-American and African
Studies at the University of Michigan,
Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Cruse's speech, titled "Aspects of Malcolm
X's Legacy Today," will confront questions
such as, "Why has 20th-century black leader
ship failed to achieve its goal of complete inte

gration, elimination of poverty and severe
underemployment, and is black leadership
capable of ameliorating the worsening condi
tion of underprivileged black Americans?"
On Thursday, a discussion lead by Sylvia
Wynter, professor of Spanish and Por
tuguese at Stanford, will explore "Poverty,
Joblessness, the Black Diaspora and the
Institution of Knowledge."
Wynter will specifically address the plight
of the poor and jobless and the role of knowl-
edge, Ambrose said. She will
speak at 7 p.m. in the Toyon Hall
lounge.
The poor and jobless, Ambrose
said, are victims of a "color-line"
that exploits them for material gain
by those who are more affluent.
Ambrose stressed that, "Mal
colm X Week is not a week of cel
ebration. It is a week, to use the
words of Prof. Cruse, of 'hard

thinking' as to how we can, in
Prof. Wynter's words, 'undo the
condemned states of the poor and
jobless.' "
Tomorrow night in the Uja
maa lounge, a video, "The Issue is
Race," will be followed by a dis
cussion titled "But It's the Black
One That's Dying: Revisiting the
Multicultural, Multiracial
Democracy."
The week's events conclude
Friday with a performance by the
Seven Principles singing group at
noon in the Lagunita Hall court
yard.
