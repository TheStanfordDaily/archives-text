Bringing his coaching prowess
from the locker room to the
lectern, Stanford football coach
Bill Walsh described the changing
role of the coach as "a facilitator
rather than a dictator" during his
address at this weekend's campus
sports psychology symposium.
The four-day long symposium,
"Toward the Further Reaches of
Sport Psychology," stressed an
exchange of coaching philoso
phies with Russian coaches. The
event featured familiar campus
faces such as Walsh, Stanford
swimming coach Skip Kenney
and athletic director Ted Leland,
as well as expert sport psycholo
gists and coaches from around
the nation.
Adding a different perspective
was a large contingent of Russian
coaches, athletes and psycholo
gists who discussed the practice
and theory of sports in the former
Soviet Union. The Esalen Insti
tute Russian-American Exchange
Center initiated the symposium.
Referring to a new trend in
coaching during his hour-long
Saturday address, Walsh said,
"We must give more latitude to
individual skills and personali
ties. No longer does the dictatori
al position get the response it did
in the past. You have to be a bet
ter coach."
During his Friday appearance,
Kenney focused on the environ
ment coaches must create to get
Lop performances from their ath
letes.
Widely recognized was one of
the top swimming coaches in the
world, Kenney has never swum
competitively and attributed
much of his success to the cre
ation of an intimate team atmo
sphere where the mind is free and
unafraid of failure.
"If we can free the mind, the
human body can do magnificent
things," said Kenny, speaking on
Friday's panel with John Dun
ning (head women's volleyball
coach at University of the Pacific)
and Pete Carroll (defensive coor
dinator for the New York Jets).

Walsh reiterated Kenny's com
ments on team atmosphere, as he
advised coaches to work on "con
ditioning the athletes to care and
depend on one another." He
noted that from childhood on,
athletes watch and emulate their
sports heroes, entering the higher
echelons of the sport with a more
individualistic outlook.

'If we can free the
mind, the human
body can do
magnificent things.'

The "new wave of coaches"
must work with this individuali
ty, rather than trying to fit all
the players in the same mold, he
said.
Turning to the challenge of
combating the fear of failure,
Walsh said, "the challenge of the
new wave of coaching is to talk
about failure." The coach must
not disregard athletes who fear
failure, but help them to work
through their fear, he added.
Walsh stressed the develop
ment of a "standard of perfor
mance" on any successful squad.
A standard of performance is
established by hard work, com
mitment and constant repetition
in which skills are recognized,
honed and ultimately thrived
upon, he said.
Contrary to popular belief,
great performances are not due to
pre-game motivational talks,
which last about 10-15 minutes,
Walsh said, but to this high stan
dard of performance developed
over the period of a year.
Amid the symposium's focus
on new coaching techniques that
give the individual latitude and
emphasize team community and
caring, Carroll speculated on the
reaction of more traditional, dic
tatorial coaches.
"Wouldn't Woody Hayes and
Bo Schembechler just puke if they
heard this talk?" Carroll quipped.
