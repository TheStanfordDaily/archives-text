Seven killed in bar shooting
FRESNO, Calif. (AP) â€” A man who
had been kicked out of a rural nightclub
returned yesterday with a friend and
opened fire, killing seven people and
wounding two, authorities said.
One of the suspects being sought had
been thrown out of Carrillo's Club after
a disturbance Friday night, then was not
allowed into the club Saturday night,
Sgt. Daryl Green said.
After he was turned away, he
returned again and"the second time was
the shooting," Green said.
The second suspect being sought had
been in the club at some point Saturday
night, and returned at the time of the
shooting, Green said.
Two handguns were used to shoot the
nine people, but police did not say if both
men fired the shots.
"A lot of shots were fired," said
Green, the homicide officer in charge of
the crime scene. "There's a lot of evi
dence in there when you shoot that
many people."
The dead were identified as club
owner, Reyes "Ray" Carrillo; his mother,
Rachel Carrillo; his half-brother, Alfredo
Carrillo; the club's cook, Mariano Perez;
his wife, Alicia Duenas Perez; and
employees Mary Ruiz and Rudy Sanchez,
police said.
One wounded woman was treated for
a gunshot to the leg and released, while

the other underwent surgery and was
expected to live, Green said.
Kevorkian arrested again
DETROIT (AP) - Dr. Jack
Kevorkian was arrested yesterday after
witnessing a cancer patient kill himself,
in apparent defiance of a new state law
against assisted suicide.
A 54-year-old man committed suicide in
Kevorkian's presence at a real estate office
by breathing carbon monoxide through a
mask, said Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey
Fieger. Police said he was 44.
Ron Mansur, who suffered from lung
and bone cancer, was the 16th person to
die in Kevorkian's presence.
Kevorkian was arrested and released
into his attorney's custody, police said. He
wasn't immediately charged.
"There's no way they can find any jury
that will convict him. It's not a crime to be
present when someone commits suicide,"
Fieger said.
Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor
George Ward said prosecutors were await
ing word from police before deciding
whether to prosecute Kevorkian under the
new law against assisted suicide.
Before yesterday, Kevorkian had assist
ed in 15 suicides since June 1990. The last
two occurred Feb. 18. A week later, Gov.
John Engler signed legislation making it a
felony punishable by up to four years in
prison to assist in a suicide.
