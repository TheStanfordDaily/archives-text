— Outgunned Muslim forces fought
off Serb and Croat attacks at opposite
ends of Bosnia yesterday. Bosnian
Serbs, meanwhile, voted on an inter
national peace plan they seemed cer
tain to reject.
With the plan apparently doomed,
the powerful Serbs and Croats —
who between them control most of
Bosnia-Herzegovina — are poised to
squeeze the weak Muslim-led govern
ment forces and carve up most of the
state.
Bosnian Serb commander Gen.
Ratko Mladic and his Bosnian Croat
counterpart, Gen. Milivoje
Petkovic, signed a truce pact yester
day as Croats stepped up attacks on
Muslim forces in southwestern
Bosnia.
But the accord, scheduled to take
effect tomorrow, is similar to others
that have quickly collapsed.
"We don't have a chance," said
Kemal Muftic, an aide to Bosnia's
Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic,
in Sarajevo. "They have decided to go
to the end. They feel how weak we
are."
The two-day referendum on the
U.N.-backed peace plan ended yester
day. Bosnia's Serbs appeared certain
to rebuff the plan, since it would

require them to give up much of the
territory they gained in 13 months of
civil war. Results are expected to be
announced today.
The plan would divide Bosnia into
largely autonomous provinces among
the three warring factions: Muslims,
ethnic Serbs and ethnic Croats. Sara
jevo, the capital, would be jointly gov
erned.
Recognizing the threat of an even
greater three-way conflict, European
Community mediator Lord Owen
appealed for thousands more peace
keepers to protect Muslims in U.re
designated safe areas.
Bosnian Serb forces, ignoring a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire, attacked
sparse government forces for the
fourth consecutive day around Brcko
in northeastern Bosnia.
Backed by howitzer and heavy
machine-gun fire, the Serbs tried to
broaden a corridor linking their ter
ritories in eastern and western
Bosnia, said Cmdr. Barry Frewer, the
U.N. peacekeepers' spokesman in
Sarajevo.
Frewer said Serbs reinforced
their positions yesterday. The
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, citing
Bosnian Serb military sources, said
Muslim-led forces had launched an
offensive, inflicting heavy Serb

casualties.
Meanwhile, some of the most
intense fighting in nearly a week
raged around Mostar in southwestern
Bosnia between Muslims and ethnic
Croats, whose alliance against the
Serbs has fractured.
Frewer said Croat troops hurled
artillery, mortars and rockets at the
town's strategic Tito bridge, prevent
ing Spanish peacekeepers from reach
ing the city.
Several buildings were ablaze in
Muslim-held areas.
In a deserted Muslim village north
of Sarajevo that came under Croat
control in fighting last month, U.N.
monitors found three graves, includ
ing one with seven badly burned bod
ies, Frewer said.
This weekend, the Bosnian govern
ment issued its strongest denuncia
tion yet on neighboring Croatia,
accusing it of sending troops into
Bosnia.
The allegation could not be inde
pendently confirmed.
But suspicion was mounting in
Sarajevo of a Serb-Croat deal.
Bosnia's Muslims and Croats are
battling mostly over traditionally
Muslim-dominated towns awarded to
Croats under the international peace
plan.
