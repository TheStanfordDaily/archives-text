## Food Faire's follies 
### 
Food Service's festivity
reflected meal iniquity,
other dining difficulties

AS FOOD SERVICE'S Spring
Food Faire aptly demon
strated, even the best-laid
plans of mice and men often go
awry.
At its best, the Food Faire
showed students a glimpse of
interesting cuisine and gave cam
pus chefs a rare opportunity to
show off their skills. At its worst,
it showed Stanford students the
type of food the outside world is
allowed to indulge in, but which
they are frequently denied.
Furthermore, it added insult to
injury by requiring them to wait in
long lines and traverse campus in
order to capitalize on this opportu
nity.
Finally, and most annoyingly,
Food Service sank large sums of
money into the Food Faire, money
which rather obviously would
have been better spent toward
improving the quality of the food
that Stanford students must eat
every day, not just one Wednesday
in May.
The disorder apparent in the
Food Faire — the depletion of cer
tain foodstuffs and the lengthy
waits for certain items being the
most notable such aggravations —
suggests that perhaps Food Ser
vice should have more modest
ambitions for next year's extrava
ganza.
A scaled-down, by-dorm festivi
ty should allow for a somewhat
less grandiose, but still-interest
ing, opportunity to show Stanford
students Food Service's culinary
capabilities.
Having experienced such deli
cacies, one can't help but wonder
why Food Service can't give its
students several exceptional
meals or numerous above-aver
age dinners, instead of one time
consuming, prop-requiring, over

ly decorous affair. To show stu
dents great food, then deny them
anything remotely comparable
for the remainder of the year, bor
ders on cruel-and-unusual pun
ishment.
A second, more nettlesome,
issue is the question of the cost of
the entire affair and that of simi
lar "special" dinners that are held
approximately once each quarter
in each dining hall. These con
sume Food Service workers' time
and students' meal points, while
providing reasonably small results
in return.
Sure, it's nice to have prime rib
or salmon once a quarter, but it's a
whole lot nicer to be able to eat
during finals week. To eliminate
these "special" meals and direct
the savings toward either lessen
ing the cost of regular breakfasts,
lunches and dinners, or to im
proving the overall quality of Food
Service meals, would be prefer
able.
Students generally do not
express a sincere longing for hula
dancers, carousel horses and mari
achi bands. But a clamor for good
food is frequently within earshot.
With the money spent on these
various Food Faire frills, Food Ser
vice could easily have found a less
leathery substitute for the peren
nial "herb-baked chicken" cur
rently on display.
Stanford chefs generally do
good, hard work; the main flaws in
Food Service seem to lie in their
pricing and administrative depart
ments. Last week's Food Faire
demonstrated both the strengths
of the former group and the weak
nesses of the latter.
Admittedly, students may very
well remember one great meal
before 10 merely good ones.
But for the sake of their health,
general well-being and contented
ness, there is no doubt that the
latter course would result in hap
pier students, less-aggravated
Food Service workers and a
refreshing drop in the number of
on-campus hula dancers.
Then, we can really celebrate
with a Spring Faire.
