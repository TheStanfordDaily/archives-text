Daily columnist stereotypes the beliefs of atheists

I WOULD LIKE to respond to Mike
Langford's May 12 analysis of athe
ism. First off, there is no dogma in
atheism. Atheism is characterized by the
lack of belief in a god, nothing more. An
atheist is free to do, think and believe
whatever he or she wishes. Let's define
two degrees of atheism: weak and
strong. The strong atheist believes with
out a doubt that God does not exist.
Weak atheists believe that God does not
exist; however, he or she concedes that it
is impossible to prove absolutely that
God does not exist.
An example will clarify a weak athe
ist's viewpoint. Let's consider what is
necessary to prove or disprove the exis
tence of some object. I say living, fuzzy
pink unicorns exist on this planet. Do
you believe me? If not, can you prove
they do not exist? Well, for you to prove
they do not exist, you would have to
search every single spot on this planet
and show that there are no fuzzy pink
unicorns anywhere. However, I just have
to produce one fuzzy pink unicorn to
prove they exist. The latter is far easier
to accomplish than the former, assum
ing they actually exist. Therefore, we
believe that fuzzy pink unicorns do not
exist until someone offers absolute proof
that they do.
The same is true with God. In order

to prove that God does not exist, I would
have to search every location in the uni
verse . . . but that does not seem too rea
sonable. I am willing to listen to others'
proof for the existence of God; however,
to date, no-one has produced anything
sufficient to indicate that God does ex .
Let's examine Langford's statement
"[Athiests] embrace science or materi
alism or acceptance as their own per
sonal gods yet scoff ..." Let's go back
to the definition: atheism is the lack of
belief in any God. Atheists, as well as
other groups, see science and rationali
ty as tools for arriving at the truth.
Materialism is not an exclusive part of
atheism since all religions, genders and
cultures will have members who are
materialistic.
Finally, everyone wants to be accept
ed by his or her peers. I do not see Lang
ford's point in stereotyping atheists as
individuals taking up the above causes
in lieu of a God, since any person of any
religion, culture or society could possess
any one or combination of these proper
ties. No atheist would define these char
acteristics as divine. Remember the defi
nition of atheism.
There are atheists who argue for the
sake of arguing. There are people who
argue about foreign policy for the sake of
arguing. There are people who argue

about economics for the sake of arguing.
There are people who argue about. . .
What is the point? People have discus
sions about a wide range of topics, one of
which is theology. When I discuss theol
ogy with people, I do so with an open
mind — and look for justification and
proof for the assertions they make. I, in
return, offer proof for the assertions I
make. If their proof is not sufficient, or I
find flaws in it, I don't believe them. The
goal of any discussion should be the
search for truth.
I am sure Langford could tell me
many things that I would not intuitively
believe; however, if he offers document
ed proof, I would be inclined to believe
what he says.
Twice in Langford's discussion he
asks what makes me think that I am
right. I was brought up in a Gatholic
household. In late high school and
early college, I realized the many
errors and inconsistencies in the
Catholic church and organized religion.
Therefore, I essentially became a Deist.
Without going into details, I was con
tent with my deistic beliefs, until I
again confronted the issue of the exis
tence of God and essentially became
agnostic. Upon finding no proof for the
existence of God, discovering flaws in
those ideas of mine which indicated

that God might exist and realizing
proving existence was far easier that
proving non-existence, I became an
atheist.
I know of other atheists who went
through many different religions, includ
ing but not limited to Christianity,
Islam, Hinduism, Taoism, etc. These
other atheists could not find proof for
the existence of God in any area, and
determined atheism was the only ratio
nal alternative.
In conclusion, before stereotyping
atheists, one should research atheism. I
am sure there are atheists as Langford
describes; however, I have not met any
one like that. If you would like to discuss
atheism and learn more, you can read
books, talk to people about atheism or
join internet news discussion groups on
religion.
The main point of Langford's column
was to encourage people to talk openly
about religion. I agree totally with that
viewpoint. I disagree with the way athe
ists were stereotyped in the article. It
showed a distinct lack of research by the
author. I hope this letter clears up those
misconceptions and encourages those
interested to examine the topic more
intently.
