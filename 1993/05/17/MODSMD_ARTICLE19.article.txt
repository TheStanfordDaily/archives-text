# Playboy not solely at fault for violent crime
## 
### 
As a habitual smoker, I am familiar
with the role of antagonistic Stanford
Student. So when a friend dared me to
call David Chan and be interviewed for
Playboy, I figured it was another chance
for me to do something everybody could
be unhappy about.
Yes, I am a feminist. But I think this
whole Playboy fiasco is bringing up

issues which reach beyond feminism.
This is just another excuse for we Stan
ford students to put on our moral out
rage wear and make some noise, then
make more noise because nobody in the
real world cares what we think.
I have a picture of Billy Baldwin on
my wall. I am obsessed with Billy Bald
win. Not for his incredible mind. Not
even because I think he's a good actor. I
think he's incredibly good-looking, and I
like to look at good-looking people. Sure,
I'm objectifying him, but that doesn't
mean that if — by some grace of God —

I were to meet Billy Baldwin, I would tie
him down and have my way with him.
I know that men have seen women in
Playboy and had the impulse to commit
violent crimes. But these men obviously
had some other psychological problems
to begin with; they could have just as
Easily seen a woman in Vogue or Elle
who was scantily clad or completely
clothed, and decided to rape the next
woman passerby. The fact is, stable peo
ple, regardless of their sex, will not com
mit violent crimes just because they saw
a spread in Playboy. Sixty intelligent and

self-confident women decided they might
want to appear in a magazine represent
ing Stanford. Insulting their decision is
not going to eliminate rape or pornogra
phy, it's just going to make them feel bad
for doing what they think is right.
We are underestimating men. Not
every man who looks at Playboy has a
score to settle with the female sex. And
if some pimply faced geek wants to beat
off in the bathroom with next October's
centerfold, I say we let him.
