ALL I'M SUPPOSED to do is type
a bunch of words here — about
700 of them, or approximately
3600 letters. But there are so many
words that it's hard to choose just 700
— and even after I do, I'm not sure if
the words I choose are the right ones.
I'm not sure if they say what I mean.
Choosing the wrong words can be
embarrassing. Once, while I was living
in Indonesia, I chose the wrong word.
An American friend and I had just fin
ished eating a dinner that some of our
Indonesian friends had cooked for us. I
wanted to say to them, "Oh boy, that
was good. I'm really full." But I chose
the wrong Indonesian words. I said,
smiling and rubbing my belly, "Oh, boy,
that was good. I've got a huge erection."
Even in English, it's tough to put the
right words in the right place. Late at
night, when you're trying to type a
paper, it's easy to confuse simple words.
If you become a bit tired and care
less, you might misplace an apostrophe,
or switch a letter or two. You might
write "it's" where you meant to write
"its." Where you wanted to type "is it?",
you might unintentionally type "it's-it!"
One is a simple question with the neu
tral pronoun "it,"the other is a popular
"ice cream treat" that originated in San
Francisco in 1906.
But the visual difference between the
two typed words is minute, and at a late

hour, fine distinctions can escape your
attention.
As insurance against this kind of
carelessness, many computers have
"spell-checkers," which point out typos
and even politely suggest alternatives for
misspelled words. The spell-checker is
helpful, but there is something about it
that smacks of a smug, patronizing
smart-ass. The spell-checker seems to
smile condescendingly and say, "You
typed 'teh.' Um, that's not a word? Did
you mean 'the'?"
Spell-checkers do have a tough job,
though. It's hard to let somebody know
they've used the wrong word, especially
if it's in front of a big crowd. After John
F. Kennedy proudly proclaimed to tens
of thousands of Germans, "Ich bin ein
Berliner," someone must have had the
tough job of breaking the news to him.
By including the article "ein" in his sen
tence, Kennedy had said something
completely different than what he
meant. And one of his staff members
probably had to smile politely and say,
"Um, Mr. President, you just said 'I am
a jelly donut.' Did you mean 'I'm a
Berliner?' "
And even a spell-checker is powerless
to point out correctly spelled words used
in the wrong place. I recently wrote an
essay where I wanted to say of a charac
ter in a novel: "he hurries toward his
inevitable death." What I typed (and

turned in) instead was: "he hurrays
toward his inevitable death."
Hurray! Hurray!
The spell-checker didn't catch that
one.
Neither did the professor, who might
have just been too embarrassed for me
to point out the error. Besides, the word
was close enough — he understood what
I meant. He probably also understood
that when I typed "hurrays" instead of
"hurries," I was just a little phonetically
disoriented.
After all, the wrong word often
sounds like the right one. When a friend
from out of town was visiting my dorm
and wondered if it was a coed residence,
he asked, "Is this a . . . bisexual dorm?"
"I'm not completely sure," I said.
But I understood what he meant, just
as my Indonesian friends understood my
post-meal excitement and those cheering
Germans got the gyst of JFK's mis
worded message. They all knew how
easy it is to confuse a few letters or
sounds. With so many words out there,
it's nearly impossible to always chews
the rite won.
