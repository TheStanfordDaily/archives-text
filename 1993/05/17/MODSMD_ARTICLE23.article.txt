## Cardinal can't lasso Longhorns, falls short of title 
### Amy Howard Editorial staff 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. - The
Stanford women's tennis team
entered yesterday's NCAA Cham
pionship final against Texas with a
hunger for revenge, but they left
unsatiated with a 5-2 loss and a
runner-up trophy for the first time
ever.
The loss to the Longhorns
proved a bitter deja vu for the
Stanford squad, as it was Texas
who last year prevented the
defending champion Cardinal
from even reaching the final
match. Prior to yesterday, the two
teams had not met since that 5-3
upset in the 1992 NCAA semifi
nals at Stanford.
No. 2-seeded Stanford entered
yesterday's final having won the
NCAA title in each of its previous
eight appearances in the finals, but
the No. 5 Longhorns (25-4) took
this year's field by surprise, run
ning through No. 9 Southern Cali
fornia, No. 3 Duke and No. 1 Flori
da en route to becoming the low
est-seeded team ever to capture
the crown.
Saturday's semifinal win over
defending national champion
Florida in front of a rowdy Gator
crowd was especially inspiring for
the Longhorns. The match was
tied 4-4 with only the No. 3 dou
bles teams left on the court. Texas'
Jill Craybas and Ashley Johnson
clinched the Longhorns' second
consecutive NCAA finals berth
with a tight 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win.
Texas entered the finals riding
a wave of emotion, but Stanford
(25-3) was still favored to win.
"I thought we could do it," said
Stanford coach Frank Brennan.
"This morning (before the match)
I felt about as confident as I ever
have before a championship team
match ... In my estimation, we
didn't lose to anybody, we got beat
en. I think the better team won
today, and that's the way it goes."
At the top singles spot, Texas
senior Susan Gilchrist upset
Laxmi Poruri, 6-3,4-6,6-3. Poruri,
ranked second in the country
behind Florida's Lisa Raymond,
could not get into the rhythm of
her game against Gilchrist's hard
driving serves.
"Obviously it's very disappoint
ing, but personally I feel I tried my
hardest, and I think the team did
too," Poruri said. "If you get down
a break against her, you're in trou
ble."
"I felt like I was controlling the
match the whole time," Gilchrist
said. "I felt pretty comfortable out
there, because I was controlling

how the points were going to hap
pen, and the only reason I was los
ing (in the second set) was because
she would come out with an unbe
lievable shot."
At No. 2 singles, senior Heather
Willens made her last NCAA
appearance a memorable one. She
gave Stanford a critical singles
point by taking out Longhorn
sophomore Kelly Pace, 6-2, 7-6 (7-
3), with fiery baseline play and
smoking service returns.
Stanford's other singles win
came from No. 6 Amy Chiminello,
who easily handled Johnson, 6-2,
6-2. The rest of the Cardinal lineup
could not follow suit, however, and
suffered straight-set losses.
Kim S? lasby was bested by Vick
ie Paynter (3-6, 0-6) in the third
slot, Kristine Kurth fell to Jackie
Moe (4-6, 1-6) at No. 4, and No. 5
Beth Berris was defeated by Cray
bas (2-6, 4-6).
Up 4-2 after singles play, the
Longhorns needed only one win
from any of their three doubles
teams to clinch the title. Stanford,
on the other hand, needed to take
all three to come out on top.
Although the odds weren't in
their favor, the Cardinal came
onto the courts looking aggressive
and emotionally pumped. Stan
ford's top doubles team of
Poruri/Willens (No. 2 in the
nation) faced the No. 1 tandem of
Gilchrist/Paynter, but Stanford
immediately went up a break to 2-
0 in the first set. Meanwhile, the
Cardinal teams of Kurth/Berris at
No. 2 and Shasby/Chiminello at
No. 3 both rose to 5-1 leads in their
first sets.
A comeback was in the making,
but Gilchrist/Paynter proved to be
the spoilers. Willens/Poruri man
aged to win just one more game in
the course of their match, falling 3-
6, 0-6 in under an hour.
"First doubles just ran into a
buzzsaw," Brennan said. "There's
no doubt in my mind that when
Gilchrist and Paynter are at their
best, they're one of the best college
doubles teams that I've ever seen."
Pace explained how fitting it
was for the two Longhorn seniors
to clinch the win. "We've counted
on them for two years now to pull
us through every tight situation,"
she said. "I think today was a good
example of their leadership; they
just kept fighting for everything."
Texas won its first NCAA
championship without coach Jeff
Moore, who left Friday to be with
his ill father.
"I think the saddest thing for all
of us is that Jeff couldn't be here
with us," Pace said. "He works so
hard for every one of us so that we

can all be the best . . . it's his tro
phy."
Brennan, who in his 14th year
as Stanford's head coach has eight
titles under his belt, put the loss in
perspective. "This year I was
happy to be there (in the finals),"
he said. "I've got no complaints
about anything. I really think we
had a great season, and I thought
we played a great tournament."
Here is a look at Stanford's trip
to the finals of the NCAA Champi
onships:
Quarterfinals: Stanford 5,
Georgia 1
Stanford advanced to the semi
final round by virtue of a 5-1 deci
sion over the seventh-seeded Geor
gia Bulldogs (20-6) on Friday.
However, the lopsided final score
did not do real justice to the match,
which Brennan described as a "gut
check."
Three singles matches were
stretched to three sets, but Stan
ford staved off an upset by display
ing gritty determination in all of
them. The finest example of gutsy
play was seen at the No. 4 spot,
where Kurth battled to a 3-6, 6-4,
7-6(7-4) victory over Georgia
junior Angela Lettiere. Finding
herself down 4-5 and 5-6 in the
third, Kurth served herself out of
trouble both times.
"That was good tennis," Bren
nan said of the match. "Kristine
played very, very well, and I thought
she was very tough mentally."
At No. 1, Poruri played an
equally tough match to take out
Anne Chauzu, 6-3, 7-5. Up 2-0 in
the second, Poruri twisted her
ankle at the net and, after walking
off the injury, plummeted to 3-5.
She managed to shake off the
setback, however, by charging her
self up. Pumping her fist after her
winners, she took the next four
games and gave Stanford its first
win of the day.

Commenting on her uncharac
teristic display of emotion, Poruri
said, "My teammates were really
surprised . . . They had never seen
me like that before. I'm [usually]
very mellow on the court. . . but it
was such a close match, and I was
getting a little nervous. I had to get
it out and the only way I could do it
was by really screaming."
On the other end of the spec
trum, No. 6 Chiminello was a
study in patience as she outlasted
Marianna Land in a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2
decision that clinched the win for
Stanford.
The No. 6 singles match was
the last one on the court because
Land's game strategy involved
moonballing every shot 25-35 feet
in the air, regardless of Chiminel
lo's efforts to pick up the pace.
Although Chiminello later admit
ted that her frustration level was
at an eight on a scale of 10 during
the match, she appeared unfazed
on the court.
According to Brennan, this is
exactly what makes her such a
strong competitor. "Amy Chimi
nello is the one you want playing
the clinching match in the NCAAs
in the third set," he said. "She's
just real gutsy, and she's a win
ner.
Her words after the match
seemed to back this up. "I'd rather
die than lose," she said only half
jokingly. "I'll play lefty if I break
my right arm. I'm going to try
until the last ball is rolling, until 7-
6 in the third (set)."
No. 2 Willens tried until she
won 7-6 in the first set, then
cruised to a 6-3 second-set victory
over Georgia's Stacy Sheppard.
Berris won her first complete
NCAA singles match at the No. 5
slot with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 effort
against fellow freshman Brooke
Galardi.

So close, yet...
Clockwise (from upper right):
Kristine Kurth rifles a return
en route to a grueling three
set triumph in Saturday's 5-1
semifinal win over Arizona;
Heather Willens and Amy
Chiminello, who scored the
Cardinal's only points in yes
terday's 5-2 loss to Texas,
spur teammates on to victory
over the Wildcats; Laxmi
Poruri, the second-ranked
player in the nation, finds that
her reach exceeds her grasp
in downing No. 3 Alix Creek of
Arizona; Beth Berris looks for
help — and a service toss —
from above, but doesn't need
it in completing a straight-set
slaughter Saturday.

Stanford's sole setback came at
the hands of No. 3 freshman Tina
Samara, who bested redshirt
freshman Shasby 6-2, 6-4 with an
aggressive net game.
Overall, Georgia fielded an
extremely young team, with four
freshmen, one sophomore and one
junior in its lineup, earning them
the nickname "Diaper 'Dogs."
Semifinals:
Stanford 5, Arizona 1
The eighth-seeded Arizona
Wildcats (16-9) made their first
ever appearance in an NCAA semi
final match on Saturday, while the
Cardinal made its 11th semifinal
showing in the tournament's 12-
year history.
Experience triumphed over
emotion in the semis, as a sea
soned Stanford squad squelched
Arizona's dreams of a title that
arose from a 5-2 upset of No. 4 Cal
ifornia in the quarterfinals.
Stanford had met Arizona twice
during the regular season and pre
vailed easily both times, 7-2 and 5-
1.
"We've gotten killed every time
we play Stanford," Alix Creek, Ari
zona's No. 1 player, said. "But this
time we actually believed we could
do more than just stay in there.
Our team is a very emotional
team; we were up, we were
psyched, and we were on a roll, and
Stanford just played well under
pressure. They always do."
According to Brennan, the piv
otal match was Poruri's 6-1, 2-6,
6-3 win over Creek, who is
ranked No. 3 behind Poruri
nationally and has announced
that she will join the professional
circuit next year. Creek has not
beaten Poruri in any of their four
meetings this year.
"I think any time you can beat
Alix Creek, it sets Arizona back a
little bit," Brennan said. "I told
Laxmi that. I said, 'If you can beat

Alix Creek in a three-set match
with that emotion she has and that
fire, that's a hell of a win.' That, I
felt, was really the key."
The most decisive victory of the
afternoon was Willens' 49-minute,
6-0,6-1 spanking of Miko Hemsiat
No. 2. Willens was on her game,
pounding her groundstrokes from
corner to corner and running
Hemsi off the court.
No. 5 Berris had little trouble
disposing of Angela Bernal (6-3, 6-
4), and Chiminello made short
work of Allison Grace at No. 6 (6-2,
7-5). Stanford's only loss came at
No. 3, where Shasby fell to Celine
Verdier, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3.
After the other players had
cleared the courts, all eyes were
once again focused on Kurth's No.
4 match. After taking the first set
6-3 from Michele Oldham, Kurth
fought from a 2-4 deficit in the sec
ond to 6-6, forcing a tiebreaker.
Stanford had advanced to an over
all 4-1 lead over the Wildcats, so
only one more Cardinal singles
win was needed to clinch the
match.
In the tiebreaker, Kurth had
three match points at 6-4, 6-5, and
7-6. She could not convert on any
of them, however, and was pushed
into a third set.
"Kristine has an interesting
nervous system," Brennan
explained. "I almost think she's
more comfortable when she's in a
state of chaos."
Just in case it became neces
sary, Shasby and Chiminello start
ed playing Stanford's first doubles
match of the tournament while
Kurth battled on. Finally, after
three hours and 22 minutes, she
pulled out a 7-5 victory in the third
to seal the Stanford win.
The individual NCAA singles
and doubles tournaments will
begin today in Gainesville. All six
Stanford singles players will be
competing, with Poruri seeded
No. 2 and Willens seeded No. 4.
The Cardinal will also be repre
sented by all three of its doubles
teams, with Poruri/Willens seed
ed No. 3.
