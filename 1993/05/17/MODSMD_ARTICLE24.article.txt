# Texas two-steps to men's tennis quarterfinal upset

ATHENS, Ga. — Don't mess
with Texas.
Like the Cardinal women, the
Stanford men's tennis team
learned a tough Texas lesson yes
terday as the Longhorns knocked
off the fourth-seeded Cardinal
men in a quarterfinal match, 5-2.
After easing their way into
NCAA competition with a 6-0

trouncing of unseeded Colorado
on Saturday, the Stanford men
could not come back from a 4-2
deficit after singles play yester
day against Texas.
Coach Dick Gould could not
have been more pleased with the
Cardinal's 1 hour, 45 minute dis
missal of the Buffaloes, who were
making their first appearance at
NCAAs. The six straight-set victo
ries were especially noteworthy
since Stanford had been known to

fall behind early and struggle
back to win, even against weak
teams.
"This is about as well as we
can play," Gould said after Satur
day's play. "We did a real good job
of focussing. . . It was nice to get
ahead in these matches."
Junior Chris Cocotos notched
the first win for the team with an
easy 6-2, 6-1 victory over Stefan
Figley at No. 4. After breaking
Figley's serve in the first game,
Cocotos held serve and then
broke again to go up 4-1.
As Cocotos clinched his match,
junior Robert Devens served for
the first set at No. 2, and Vimal
Patel at No. 3 and Ricky Becker at
No. 6 were about to break their
opponents' serves to win their first
sets.
Becker was the second player
off of the court. The freshman
from Roslyn, N.Y., showed no
rookie anxiety as he breezed by
Scott Davidoff 6-2, 6-2.
But classmate Jeff Salzenstein
felt the heat on Court 5. Losing
serve several times in the first
set, Salzenstein fell behind 1-2
and then 3-4. After that, howev
er, he turned the tide and won
nine out of the next 10 games and
clinched the 6-4, 6-1 match with
an ace.
"I was really nervous," he said.
"This is an event unlike any
other. . . I just had to get the jit
ters out and then I was okay."
Next, 57th-ranked Patel
defeated Jeff Spiers 6-2, 7-5 on
Court 3. After moving to an early

lead in the second set, Patel let up
and almost forced a third. "I
knew I could put him away,"
Patel said. "I just had a mental
lapse."
After an unexciting first set,
25th-ranked Devens fought off
Jasper Witt with delicate drop
volleys and perfectly executed
lobs in the second set. He also
notched a 6-2, 7-5 win, despite a
warning from the umpire to
watch his long shoelaces, which
touched the line as he served and
could have been grounds for a
foot-fault citation.
"I thought he was joking,"
Devens said. Nevertheless, Gould
promptly tied triple-knots in
Devens' shoelaces.
As Devens clinched the team
match, Witt angrily hit a ball over
the fence and was cited for ball
abuse. Normally, a free point
would be given to the other team.
In this case, however, the point
was given to seventh-ranked
Michael Flanagan, who was at
deuce on Court 1. This put Flana
gan at match point. He then
broke Marc Leclair on the next
point to win, 6-3, 6-3.
Throughout his match, Flana
gan wore down Leclair, a baselin
er, by rushing the net over and
over again. Leclair managed to
pull out a number of effective
passing shots in the first set, but
eventually started mishitting.
"I knew he couldn't keep hit
ting the passing shots because if
he could he'd be ranked a lot
higher," Flanagan said. Leclair is

currently unranked.
Proving much more arduous
than Saturday's walk in the park
was the Cardinal's task against
Texas, which sports a lineup quite
similar to Stanford's: there are no
big names and the team is very
strong at the bottom of the lineup.
The match was a dogfight from
the start, for while Cocotos quick
ly nailed his first set over Ernesto
Ponce and Salzenstein gritted out
a tiebreaker to win his first set,
their teammates all fell behind
early and struggled to catch up.
Flanagan came back from five
break points to hold serve at 3-3.
He finally broke Anders Eriksson
to take a 6-5 lead in the first set.
The Swede broke him back and
then won the first set in a
tiebreaker (7-5). Flanagan fell
apart in the second set, losing 6-7,
0-6.
As Flanagan's tiebreaker start
ed, Patel won his second set
against No. 42 lan Williams and it
appeared that the Cardinal was
still in the match. But the momen
tum soon changed as Becker lost
his match to Chad Clark, 5-7, 5-7.
Meanwhile, Cocotos split sets,
Flanagan was being creamed in
his second set and Devens lost his
match to Trey Phillips.
Devens used deadly lobs
against the 6-foot-4 Phillips but
could not pull out a win. The
Texas sophomore gave the
Longhorns a 2-0 lead with his 7-
5, 7-6 (7-4) victory.
Within the next few moments,
Flanagan lost and Patel followed

suit, 4-6, 6-4, 4-6. The Cardinal
was 0-4, and on the verge of los
ing everything.
Cocotos broke Ponce to go up 5-
4 in the third set and then broke
again to give Stanford its first point
of the day with a 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 win.
Tossing off his Saturday jit
ters, Salzenstein came through
cool and composed as he held
serve at 5-5 and then fought
through a tiebreaker to give Stan
ford one last breath of hope. His
7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-5) victory gave
the Cardinal a chance to make
the biggest NCAA comeback ever.
"I was really pumped up
(because) I'd been able to keep
the team in but I knew we had a
tough chore ahead of us," Salzen
stein said.
Yet winning three doubles
matches against a team which is
determined to pull out an upset is
a tall order for any squad, and
despite winning the first sets on
Court 1 and 2, the Cardinal was
not up to the task.
Salzenstein and classmate Jim
Thomas were outplayed by
Williams and Ponce at No. 3 dou
bles. Williams, a six-foot-eight
junior, dominated the match with
thunderous overheads and equal
ly big serves. The Texas pair,
playing only their third match
together, clinched the Long
horns' victory 6-3, 6-2.
"We had some chances but we
weren't good enough to take
advantage of them," Gould said.
"We've been struggling all year
with doubles."
