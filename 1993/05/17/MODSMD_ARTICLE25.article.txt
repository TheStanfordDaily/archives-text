# Clark soars, sews up Pac-10 bid
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After a month of frustration, Cardinal high
jumper Travis Clark finally bested his provisional
mark of 7 feet, 1 3/4 inch by clearing 7-3 yesterday at
the Stanford Pre-Pac-10 Meet.
Waiting outside the pit before his final attempt at
7-3, Clark felt the weight of his recent disappoint
ments looming over his performance. "Time was
running out for me, and I kinda lost faith in myself,"
he said. "I really didn't think I could do it."
However, on his final approach to bar, Clark ran
"more aggressively" and — according to him —
"somewhat out of control," as he cleared the elusive
mark with inches to spare.
And once he was over the bar, Clark continued
bouncing and flipping on the mat, unable to contain
his excitement. "My jumps today renewed my faith,"
he said.
Clark's final jump of the regular season moved
him up to the No. 2 seed for next week's Pacific 10
Conference Finals, behind Gabe Beechum of Ari
zona State, who cleared 7-3 1/4.
But Clark wasn't the only Cardinal who turned in
an outstanding performance, as the day proved suc
cessful for many Stanford competitors.
Senior Rhonda Oliver had an outstanding meet,
registering a first-place showing in the 100 meters
(12.13 seconds) and a second-place finish in the 200
with a time of 23.8.
Besting Oliver in the 200 was none other than
former Stanford standout and Olympian Chryste
Gaines. Running unattached, Gaines smoked her
competitors with a 23.3 clocking. However, like last
year, she has her sights set on bigger meets and big

ger medals.
"I am training now with the goal of winning gold
medals in the 100 and 200 at Atlanta in '96," Gaines
said. "But it's always good to come back and race on
your home track and with people you know. This is
where it all started."
In a less serious race, Marcus Hickerson, Class of
'91, leaped his way to a victory in the 400 hurdles,
after completing that event for only the third time
ever. A long-jump standout in his collegiate days,
Hickerson approached every hurdle with a slower
vertical leap. But despite his awkward style, Hicker
son crossed the line uncontested.
In the field events, junior Jen McCormick had a
record-setting day in the javelin competition, as she
demolished her old lifetime best with a throw of 162-
6, good for third place in the star-studded field. The
winner of that event, Erica Wheeler of the Mizuno
Track Club, set a new Pacific Association record
with a mark of 183-6.
Melissa Freeburg also provided a highlight for the
Cardinal by posting a Pac-10 qualifying time in the
800. Freeburg took the lead in that race for good at
the quarter-lap mark and edged out Arizona State's
Rachel Brennen for the victory (2:12.65).
Freeburg's mark ensured her a spot on the Cardi
nal Pac-10 team as the 17th automatic qualifier.
Overall, Stanford will field a team of 36 members,
comprised of automatic and wild-card entries, at the
conference finals in Berkeley this weekend.
"The week's meet may have been one of the bet
ter meets of the season," said coach Vin Lananna.
"We're getting some fine individual performances,
and that is what we're basically looking for next
week as well.
"Right now we're in no position to contend for the
