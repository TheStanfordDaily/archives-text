# Golfers take third in regional
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The best finish ever. That's what the Stanford
women's golf team came away with this weekend
after three rounds of spectacular golf in sun
drenched Tucson, Ariz., at the NCAA Western
Regional Championships.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal, which needed a
top-10 finish to clinch a berth in next week's
NCAA Championships, placed third in a field of
18 teams west of the Mississippi with a team
score of 861. The squad fell one stroke short of
second-place USC and 10 strokes shy of tourna
ment champion Arizona State.
Leading the Cardinal once again was senior
captain Martha Richards, who shot a 4-under
par 71-70-71—212 to finish tied for third among
individual competitors.
The low score gave Richards, a First Team All-
Pacific 10 Conference selection, her seventh top
-10 finish and her fourth top-5 finish in her last
10 tournaments.
Pleased with Richards' outstanding placing,
coach Tim Baldwin went as far as saying, "If
she's not a first-team All-American, something is
the matter with the voting."
Also enjoying an excellent tournament was
sophomore Jamille Jose (78-70-70—218, tl9th).
Jose's scores of 70 in the second and third
rounds were her finest two rounds of golf during
this spring season. Junior Melinda Daniels (72-
77-71—220) and freshman Vicky Strada (72-81-

71 — 224) both recovered from subpar second
rounds to post impressive overall scores.
Perhaps the surprise of the tournament, how
ever, was freshman Julie Bowen (73-73-73—
219), who finished 23rd with the finest scoring
rounds of her career.
"Part of the problem during our previous
tournaments was that we didn't have a solid fifth
player, so it put a lot of pressure on our starting
four golfers," Baldwin said. "Julie just came
through for us."
Bowen's 73s in all three rounds greatly
improved the Cardinal's scoring, since the best
four scores of the five golfers were used to calcu
late the team score.
The standout showing by the Cardinal
marked the first time in 10 years that Stanford
has beaten local powerhouse San Jose State. The
Spartans had easily won the last three tourna
ments in which both teams had participated,
including the California Intercollegiate, which
Stanford hosted on May 1.
"It was kind of nice to beat San Jose State,
since they had done so well in earlier tourna
ments," Daniels said. Stanford also finished
ahead of four other teams with better national
rankings — Texas (by 10 strokes), UCLA (by 15),
Arizona (by 18) and Oklahoma State (by 36).
Baldwin was very impressed with the Cardi
nal's consistent overall play. "This is the finest
golf ever shot by Stanford University women,"
Baldwin said. "They've really
applied themselves, to the
point where they're a great
team."
The Cardinal's gradual
improvement can be traced by
their rise in national ranking.
At the end of the fall season,
Stanford was ranked 26th
nationally. But after 10 solid
spring tournaments, the Cardi
nal's ranking had risen to
ninth, and Baldwin figures
that this third-place finish will
vault the Cardinal into fifth or
sixth place before the NCAA
Championships May 26-29 in
Athens, Ga.
"I think we've peaked at the
right time," Daniels said. "As
long as we keep working on the
fundamentals, we should be in
great shape at the NCAAs."
At the Championships,
Stanford can expect to face the
likes of Eastern qualifying
teams such as Georgia, Fur
man and Ohio State, as well as
familiar Western qualifying
teams such as the Spartans,
Trojans and Sun Devils. Based
on this weekend's showing,
however, the Cardinal appears
to be up to the task.
