# Batters get even odds, split pair with Rebels
## 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
"Are you going to be in the
pros?" a small boy, still in his
freshly soiled Little League out
fit, asked freshman baseballer
Rich Crowe after yesterday's
game.
"Not next year," Crowe
replied.
But yesterday, Crowe (four
for-four, one HR) played like he
was gunning for Rickey Hen
derson's job, even though he
was well aware that the results
of the game — a 10-5 Cardinal
victory over the UNLV Runnin'
Rebels »— weren't going to
mean much.
In a nonconference series
between two teams without a
glimmer of hope for postseason
play, this weekend should have
made for boring baseball. But
with the pro draft less than a
month away, and next season's
lineup as undefined as Carlton
Fisk's upper body, the series
proved a backdrop for individual
performances.
Andrew Lorraine, who
pitched a complete game yester
day, was certainly showing off
for the pros. His control (he sur
rendered just one walk) was
impressive, as was his consistent
speed.
"He had good stuff, a good live
fastball," said Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess. "He was strong
throughout."
Marquess even sounded
pleased about the three homers
Lorraine gave up.
"When you're a hard thrower
like Andrew is, you're going to
give up the longball."
Unlike Crowe, Lorraine, a
junior, said he was hoping to get
drafted next month, though he
would be happy to spend another

year at Stanford.
"Mostly it would be a financial
decision," he said. "Plus it's pret
ty exciting."
Saturday's game, a 12-inning,
7-6 loss, didn't prove quite as
pretty for sophomore Dusty
Allen.
Allen, who, at .255, has not
lived up to his freshman promise
this season, hit a two-run homer
in the fifth inning to put the Car
dinal up 5-1. But in the 12th,
Allen committed a critical error
when a ground ball by the Run
nin' Rebels Nick Degerinis
bounced over his glove and into
right field.
Not only were the players hyp
ing themselves and their stats for
the scouts, but they were also
playing for the coaching staff,
who has stated that no one —
except freshman catcher A.J.
Hinch — is a shoe-in for next
year's lineup.
"It's a very competitive situa
tion, even though it's the end of
the year and we're not really
going anywhere," Marquess said.
"Everything is wide open. I
don't think anyone has done a
good enough job to say they're
right in there — that they're
anchored in."
Marquess did ascertain that
little-league hero Crowe would
probably land himself a place in
Stanford's batting order, if not
the Oakland A's.
"He's really come a long way.
He's one of our hottest hitters
right now. He's going to be a big
help to us during his career at
Stanford."
And, though not as intimidat
ing as the scouts or Marquess,
the players were out to impress
third baseman Brian Dallimore's
father, Fred, the manager of the
UNLV squad.
The younger Dallimore —

who according to Lorraine had
been talking about the match
up all season with his team
mates — was unable to play in
the series after breaking his
hand last weekend against Cali
fornia.
Lorraine, however, said he
didn't think about the father-son

rivalry once he hit the mound.
"If I were playing my dad, I
wouldn't think about it. I played
UCLA and I had three friends
from my high school and I didn't
feel anything different."
