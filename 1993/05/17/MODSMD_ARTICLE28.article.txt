(AP) — Seattle and Phoenix had the big man
blues after their lost weekend in Texas.
Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson had big
games yesterday as Houston and San Antonio
pulled even 2-2 in the Western Conference semifi
nals with homecourt victories. Both Texas teams
also won at home on Saturday.
Olajuwon had 24 points, 12 rebounds and eight
blocked shots in the Rockets' 103-92 win over the
SuperSonics after Robinson's playoff career-high
36 points and 16 rebounds carried the Spurs past
Phoenix 117-103.
"I hate to give up any easy baskets," said Ola
juwon, who had four blocks in the first period,
when Houston opened a 29-19 lead, the fourth
time in five quarters it held Seattle under 20. "If
they're going to shoot, I'm going to make sure
they work for what they get."
In yesterday's other NBA playoff game, New
York took a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference by
defeating Charlotte 94-92.
Chicago, leading Cleveland 3-0, goes for a
sweep tonight at Richfield Coliseum. On Tuesday
night, Charlotte is at New York, San Antonio at
Phoenix and Houston at Seattle.
Shawn Kemp had 23 points and 18 rebounds
and Ricky Pierce scored 15 of his 19 points in the
second half for Seattle. Otis Thorpe, who was 20
of 25 from the field in the two weekend games,
had 16 points on 8-for-ll shooting for the Rock
ets.
Spurs 117, Suns 103
Robinson, held to 13 points on 4-for-16 shoot

ing in the Spurs' win in Game 3 on Saturday, led
the way when San Antonio outscored the Suns 65-
47 in the second half. His 16 rebounds led a 52-36
advantage on the boards by the Spurs.
"I think that adrenalin just took over," Spurs
coach John Lucas said. "We had great play from
everyone. David Robinson was awesome."
The Spurs pulled away early in the fourth
quarter with a 15-6 run keyed by 3-pointers from
Lloyd Daniels and Willie Anderson, giving them a
100-86 lead four minutes into the period.
San Antonio held the Suns' Charles Barkley to
five points in the second half. He finished with 18
points on 7-of-20 shooting and 12 rebounds.
"We played hard, but it wasn't meant to be,"
Barkley said. "We have struggled all year
rebounding. We've got to get everybody on the
boards when we're playing such an active team."
Kevin Johnson led Phoenix with 26 points.
Sean Elliott scored 19 points for San Antonio,
which lost Antoine Carr with a sprained ankle in
the first quarter.
Knicks 94, Hornets 92
New York wanted to go to Patrick Ewing, but
Rolando Blackman made the game-winning 20-
footer with 5.4 seconds left as the 24-second clock
wound down.
"The play was to find Patrick," Blackman said.
"And then when Patrick can't get it, then he finds
all the rest of us helpers."
Blackman, shooting 31 percent in the playoffs,
took a pass from Hubert Davis at the top of the
key and swished a high-arching jumper.
