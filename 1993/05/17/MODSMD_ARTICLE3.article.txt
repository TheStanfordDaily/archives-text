Emphasizing job creation and personal re
sponsibility for welfare recipients, Gov. Pete
Wilson spelled out his ideas for welfare reform
to a group of economic experts on campus Sat
urday night.
"We all recognize that the system doesn't
work ... It has become unaffordable in human
terms," Wilson said to an audience of about 150
in the Stanford Barn's banquet room. "What

works is work itself."
Wilson's speech painted a picture of liberals
and conservatives around the country coming to
"remarkably common conclusions" about wel
fare reform.
The governor's keynote speech concluded
the weekend's "Welfare Policy in California"
conference, sponsored by the Hoover Institu
tion, the Public Policy Program and the Center
for Economic Policy Research.
Promoting jobs, acknowledging the reciprocal
obligation between welfare families and society

and breaking the welfare dependency cycle are
national priorities, Wilson said. But he expressed
concern that many welfare families may see gov
ernment assistance as an alternative to work.
"We've got to change a system that teaches
generation after generation that welfare is a
perfectly acceptable career choice," Wilson said.
Instead, Wilson urged the creation of more
jobs for welfare recipients. Jobs could be added
both by lifting "artificial restraints" on California
