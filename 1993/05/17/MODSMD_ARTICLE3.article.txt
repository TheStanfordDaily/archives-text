# Gov. Wilson speaks on reforming welfare
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Emphasizing job creation and personal re
sponsibility for welfare recipients, Gov. Pete
Wilson spelled out his ideas for welfare reform
to a group of economic experts on campus Sat
urday night.
"We all recognize that the system doesn't
work ... It has become unaffordable in human
terms," Wilson said to an audience of about 150
in the Stanford Barn's banquet room. "What

works is work itself."
Wilson's speech painted a picture of liberals
and conservatives around the country coming to
"remarkably common conclusions" about wel
fare reform.
The governor's keynote speech concluded
the weekend's "Welfare Policy in California"
conference, sponsored by the Hoover Institu
tion, the Public Policy Program and the Center
for Economic Policy Research.
Promoting jobs, acknowledging the reciprocal
obligation between welfare families and society

and breaking the welfare dependency cycle are
national priorities, Wilson said. But he expressed
concern that many welfare families may see gov
ernment assistance as an alternative to work.
"We've got to change a system that teaches
generation after generation that welfare is a
perfectly acceptable career choice," Wilson said.
Instead, Wilson urged the creation of more
jobs for welfare recipients. Jobs could be added
both by lifting "artificial restraints" on California
businesses and by providing incen
tives for industiy to hire additional
workers, he said.
Wilson also advocated the idea
that any work is "a thousand times
more honorable than choosing
welfare as a profession."
Beyond job creation, the gover
nor outlined "reasonable and real
istic obligations to society" his
plan would ask welfare recipients
to fulfill.
"America's welfare system is
caught in a time warp," Wilson
said. "We administer this program
as if it were still the widows and
orphans fund it started out as in
the 19305, a time when working
mothers were the the exception,
not the rule."
The reality that more than half
the women in the United States
work outside the home is not
reflected in California's welfare
policy, he added.
As part of his proposed expecta
tions for welfare recipients, Wilson
asked welfare families to refrain
from having children while on
public assistance.
"It's not fair that a young work
ing couple who put off having chil
dren until they can afford it are
required to pay for one child after
another of the non-working wel
fare recipient," he said.
Wilson's proposed Maximum
Family Grant provision would cut
off per-child cash grants for wel
fare families.
"The welfare system allows
recipients, by giving them a cash

grant, to have kids without worry
ing about the financial conse
quences," Wilson said. "The
expanding welfare grant should
end."
In addition to family planning,
Wilson said he expects teen moth
ers to finish high school.
Wilson proposed a program that
would increase a teen mother's
stipend by $50 each month if she
stayed in school, and decrease it by

the same amount if she did not.
In another attempt to encour
age self-sufficient families, Wilson
said he plans to target absentee
fathers through an aggressive sys
tem of child-support collection.
Although he acknowledged
proof of paternity would be a prob
lem, Wilson said he "does not
shrink from putting the thumb
screws to [absentee fathers]... .
They deserve it."

Pointing optimistically to Cali
fornia's 27 freshmen state sena
tors, the governor said that party
affiliation would not be a factor in
finding legislation that works for
the state. "What's important is
that we get the job done," he said.
While he hopes for legislative
cooperation, Wilson said he may
resort to a reform initiative and
will "continue pushing for welfare
reform, however long it takes."
