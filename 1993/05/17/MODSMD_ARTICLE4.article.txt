# What time is it? Time to fix clock
## Leaky roof, faulty transmission cripple Clock Tower 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
At first it lagged a few minutes behind and made
people late for class. Then it chimed at 4:37 and made
them wonder whether their watches were wrong.
Now its hands rest apathetically at noon, and it's
clear that the Clock Tower just plain isn't working.
And it hasn't been functioning for a long time
now. The slow onslaught of the clock's illness —
caused by a leaky roof and faulty transmission —
began early winter quarter.
"It was a slow deterioration," said David Beach, a
professor of mechanical engineering who was com
missioned to look into the problem. "When the rains
started it began to stop intermittently, and it became
more and more unreliable."
Time will start again at Stanford as soon as the
custom-designed transmission — which is worn to
the point of failure — is removed, "thoroughly over
hauled" and replaced, a process that could take any
where from one week to one month, and could cost
anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000, Beach said.
But before the transmission, which is a set of gears
that drives the clock's hands, is reworked, the

tower's roof must be repaired to avoid a reocurrence
of the problem. This project is slated to be executed in
conjunction with the repair of all the other roofs on
campus that were damaged during this year's heavy
rains.
"The Clock Tower is very important," said Bruce
Wiggins, a Facilities special projects manager. "But
the repair of roofs is a major expense."
The money to finance the roof repairs is being for
warded through various University channels and
must eventually be approved by the Board of
Trustees, Wiggins said.
Roof repairs do not mix well with classes, so they
cannot take place until after Commencement. But
ideally the roofs should be repaired before the next
rainy season, Wiggins said, adding that he hopes the
job can begin sometime this summer.
In addition to the roof, the entire building housing
the clock could use a little refurbishing, he said. Ac
cording to Wiggins, the whole structure suffered
from the wet winter, including the gutters and tiling.
"When you get a South wind and a driving rain, it
really runs it in,"he said.
The Clock Tower was built in
1901, and the original mecha
nism, which is visible through
the glass at the tower's base, is
still functioning "beautifully"
Beach said. It is the relatively
modern transmission, built in
1983, that is causing all the
problems.
