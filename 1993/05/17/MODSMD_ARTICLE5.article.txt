# Motives for ending storage questioned
## Problems with fire codes, theft disputed by students, officials 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
As the scramble for summer
storage heats up, some University
officials are joining students in
questioning the reasons the Uni
versity has given for severing
storage â€” including compliance
with fire codes, the possibility of
theft and the demands of summer
conference housing.
Last year, Director of Housing
and Food Service Keith Guy and
Assoc. Director of Residential Ed
ucation Diana Conklin issued a
memo to all residence staff ex
plaining that the University was
discontinuing summer storage
primarily because Stanford did
not have the means to address
problems presented by fire codes,
summer conferences and theft.
"Because of budget cuts, we
don't have resources the right now
to respond (to these problems),"
Guy said.
Summer storage "becomes a
very difficult service to offer and
many schools are moving in the
same direction" as Stanford, he said.
No fire problem?
But Deputy University Fire

Marshal Alison Phena said that,
While complying with fire codes
presents certain logistical prob
lems, it does not hinder the Uni
versity's ability to provide stor
age.
Fire Marshal Ray Gamma ex
plained that the only major con
flict with fire codes is that all base
ment rooms, including those for
storage, must have two exits if
they are larger than 300 square
feet.
"Generally, it's costly to put in
second exits because you have to
excavate" walls, Phena said, but
she added that the fire depart
ment has found a viable alterna
tive to meet the regulation.
"We are trying something
called 'restricted use and
access,' " Phena said. "In lieu of
another exit, we're allowing only
the [facilities supervisors] to have
access" to storage areas.
By keeping the number of peo
ple who enter the storage rooms
low, "it can work," she said, ex
plaining that exceptions can be
made to the fire code.
Restricted-access storage is al
ready being practiced in a number
