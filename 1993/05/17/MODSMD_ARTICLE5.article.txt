# Motives for ending storage questioned
## Problems with fire codes, theft disputed by students, officials 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
As the scramble for summer
storage heats up, some University
officials are joining students in
questioning the reasons the Uni
versity has given for severing
storage — including compliance
with fire codes, the possibility of
theft and the demands of summer
conference housing.
Last year, Director of Housing
and Food Service Keith Guy and
Assoc. Director of Residential Ed
ucation Diana Conklin issued a
memo to all residence staff ex
plaining that the University was
discontinuing summer storage
primarily because Stanford did
not have the means to address
problems presented by fire codes,
summer conferences and theft.
"Because of budget cuts, we
don't have resources the right now
to respond (to these problems),"
Guy said.
Summer storage "becomes a
very difficult service to offer and
many schools are moving in the
same direction" as Stanford, he said.
No fire problem?
But Deputy University Fire

Marshal Alison Phena said that,
While complying with fire codes
presents certain logistical prob
lems, it does not hinder the Uni
versity's ability to provide stor
age.
Fire Marshal Ray Gamma ex
plained that the only major con
flict with fire codes is that all base
ment rooms, including those for
storage, must have two exits if
they are larger than 300 square
feet.
"Generally, it's costly to put in
second exits because you have to
excavate" walls, Phena said, but
she added that the fire depart
ment has found a viable alterna
tive to meet the regulation.
"We are trying something
called 'restricted use and
access,' " Phena said. "In lieu of
another exit, we're allowing only
the [facilities supervisors] to have
access" to storage areas.
By keeping the number of peo
ple who enter the storage rooms
low, "it can work," she said, ex
plaining that exceptions can be
made to the fire code.
Restricted-access storage is al
ready being practiced in a number
of Row houses, including Delta
Kappa Epsilon and Haus Mit
teleuropa, Phena pointed out.
However, even if a restricted
access plan is established, sum
mer conference plans may
require second exits to be
installed in many residences'
storage rooms anyway.
Summer renovations in
Wilbur and four Row houses,
along with upcoming building
construction, may force the
University to use many storage
rooms as bedrooms for summer
conferences. However, the use
of these rooms as bedrooms
would require them to be in
compliance with fire regulations
for inhabited rooms — includ
ing the installation of second
exits.
Phena said there are currently
17 second exits being installed in
dorms such as Stern Hall and
Lagunita Court.
All in all, fire-code violations

in storage rooms are "not an out
standing problem," Phena said.
And according to Phena, any
other fire-code violations that
summer storage might pose
would not be major.
"Basically, storage must be
neat and orderly," she said. "I
have a liberal view of 'order
ly.' . . . You should be able to
walk through some sort of a
pathway."
As long as she doesn't "have to
climb over stuff to get in and out
of storage rooms," Phena said she
sees no problem with fire codes.
Few thefts reported
According to residence office
staff, another reason the Univer
sity has cited for stopping storage
— the potential theft of students'
belongings — is not a major con
cern.
In the four years she has head
ed the Stern Hall office, Janet
Wright said she never had any
problems with theft from storage
rooms.
And J.R. Kang, the office assis
tant at Lagunita Court, also said
theft has not been a "huge prob

lem."
The only case of theft from
summer storage in the last two
years at Lagunita was one stereo
that was reported missing after
being placed in storage, Kang
said.
And the few reported thefts
could be attributed to staff care
lessness and not the existence of
storage rooms themselves.
For example, Kang said, "We
don't know how many people
have keys to the storage rooms.
The [resident assistants] may
have handed their keys to unau
thorized people."
Kang said she believes control
ling key circulation would help
solve any possible problems with
theft.
However, Guy said that some
residence staff had complained
of missing items after last sum
mer and said dealing with the
cases had been a "hassle" for his
office.
But according to Robert Beth,
Stanford's director of risk man
agement, theft is at most a has
sle, and not a financial burden.
Even if students file complaints

of damages from fire or theft, the
University cannot be held liable,
Beth said.
Stanford "has no real prob
lems with insurance for storage
rooms," Beth said, stressing that
University policy has always been
to warn students that they store
at their own risk.
Converting storage rooms?
In addition to citing fire codes
and theft worries, the University
has hoped to secure many current
storage areas as bedroom substi
tutes for conferences and youth
camps that rent dorms during the
summer.
"We want to use every room
that we can possibly get," said
Carol Leynse, manager of the
Conference Office.
But many students are sur
prised the University would even
consider using storage areas for
sleeping areas, mainly because of
the poor quality of the rooms.
"Our outside storage room is a
shed with no windows," said
BethAnn Katz, a junior who lives
in Terra. "You can't live in it. You
can't put a bed in it. I don't know

how you can house people in stor
age rooms."
Guy and Conklin said in their
memo that student rooms used
for storage over the summer can
not be accessed for repair or
cleaning. But according to Guy,
only Row houses use student
rooms for storage.
In the absence of University
sponsored summer storage, Guy
said he will rely on the ASSU to
find a solution to the lack of stor
age on campus.
"I hope the creativity of others
will come up with [ways to
respond] to students' needs," he
said.
But the ASSU has not been
able to find a solution. An effort to
provide alternative summer stor
age by buying steel storage con
tainers to place near the stadium
was proposed. However, when
numerous potential risks were
brought to the ASSU's attention,
the plan was discarded.
Currently, the ASSU is in the
process of finding means to rent
off-campus space and provide
transportation for students who
plan to use it.
