# Wanted: new logo
## University seeks new design to spark paraphernalia sales 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
In an effort to boost retail sales
of Stanford paraphernalia, the Of
fice of Technology Licensing is
looking for a more dynamic logo to
complement the University's tree
symbol.
Deemed too static and boring,
Stanford's currently trade
marked logos soon will be supple
mented by newer, more animated
icons, said Jon Sandelin, a licens
ing associate in the Office of Tech
nology Licensing.
Licensing officials hope the
new designs will generate addi
tional revenue for the University.
According to Maria Gladfelter,
the licensing office's manager of
emblematic ware, proceeds from
logo licensing fund undergradu
ate scholarships, including athlet
ic scholarships.
Sandelin emphasized that the
office is searching for a new design
to supplement, not replace, the
current logo of the tree superim
posed on the block "S."
"We're looking for a design
that's new and creative,"
Sandelin said, "something that

has a linkage to the history of the
University in a favorable way."
To get new ideas, the licensing
office is holding a contest, open to
all Stanford staff, faculty and stu
dents, to elicit sketches of poten
tial new logos.
The contest "is a test to see
how much interest is out there,
what the faculty, staff and stu
dents think," Gladfelter said.
In addition to the tree, current
ly registered trademarks are the
University seal and the words
"Cardinal" and "Stanford," which
show up on a variety of products
ranging from towels to license
plate rims, and particularly on ap
parel.
The licensing office hopes a
more eye-catching design will
stimulate licensees to create and
sell more products.
"We're kind of boring" now,
and that shows in the licensees'
lack of enthusiasm to bring new
products out on the market,
Sandelin said.
"It's hard to come up interest
ing designs when all they (the li
censees) have to work with are
these few designs. It's hard to be
creative with these limitations," he
said. "We're a color and that makes
it real difficult."
The University of Alabama,
whose Crimson Tide mascot is also
associated with a color, overcame
that difficulty by using a more ani
mated elephant logo on sports-pro
motion material and licensed prod
ucts.
The licensing office already has
one new design to propose to
licensees, Sandelin said. Along
with the ideas that contest
entrants will contribute, the office
will submit the trotter-horse
design that was widely used during
the Stanford Centennial celebra
tion in 1991.
Cindy Hill, a licensing adminis
trator at Logo 7, an Indianapolis
based company that is licensed to
produce Stanford and other colle
giate apparel, said adding a more
dynamic logo is a good idea that
should stimulate more interest in
the retail market.
"Mascots — animal mascots —
seem to sell really well. And we
want something that will sell," Hill
said. "We can't do a whole lot with
a tree."
Not only is it hard for Stanford
product licensees to be creative
with the tree and cardinal mascots,
but these logos also seem to con
fuse consumers, said Jillian
Smider, an assistant manager at
the Track House.
"People come in and ask,
'Where are all your cardinals?' "
she said. "They think the tree is

really dumb. People don't under
stand where the tree ties in."
Not everyone likes the search
for new logos, however. Freshman
Charles Goodan, who will be the
Stanford Band's tree mascot next
year, said the tree motif suits him
fine.
"I think it's ridiculous," said
Goodan. "We're the only school
that has something so standstill
like the tree. That's what's so fun
about it. It's something that
doesn't move in real life but it's the
most moving part of the Band.
"There's been a long tradition of

trees," he added. "The spirit of the
Palo Alto tree should live on."
Historically, the most popular
mascot among alumni has been the
Indian, which represented Stan
ford over 20 years ago, Smider said.
In 1923, the University's ath
letic teams were unofficially called
the Indians, and in 1937, for the
first time, Stanford was identified
with "Li'l Injun," a cartoon char
acter.
After protest over the mascot's
ethnically offensive nature, the
student body voted in 1972 to dis
continue association with the Indi

an, and Stanford resumed its earli
er identity as the Cardinal.
Since its inception in 1987,
Sandelin said, Stanford's active
program in licensing trademarks
has generated $2 million in royal
ties. The establishment of a licens
ing office allows the University to
collect a larger share of the royalties
from sales of items with the logos.
However, sales of Stanford
products have remained "fairly
constant over the past three
years," Sandelin said.
Gladfelter hopes Stanford can
capitalize on having a successful

football program, which will poten
tially generate more sales. "Lots of
t-shirts and sweatshirts are geared
for action figures — something
that moves, rather than a tree,"
she pointed out.
"I don't know how everyone will
respond," she said. "I think [the
Athletics Department] will be very
receptive to whatever we come up
with. We've been looking for some
thing new for a while."
Suggestions for a new must be
submitted to the office by July 15.
Several $500 prizes will be awarded
for ideas that are used.

"Mascots — animal mascots —
seem to sell really well. And we
want something that will sell," Hill
said. "We can't do a whole lot with
a tree."
Not only is it hard for Stanford
product licensees to be creative
with the tree and cardinal mascots,
but these logos also seem to con
fuse consumers, said Jillian
Smider, an assistant manager at
the Track House.
"People come in and ask,
'Where are all your cardinals?' "
she said. "They think the tree is

really dumb. People don't under
stand where the tree ties in."
Not everyone likes the search
for new logos, however. Freshman
Charles Goodan, who will be the
Stanford Band's tree mascot next
year, said the tree motif suits him
fine.
"I think it's ridiculous," said
Goodan. "We're the only school
that has something so standstill
like the tree. That's what's so fun
about it. It's something that
doesn't move in real life but it's the
most moving part of the Band.
"There's been a long tradition of

trees," he added. "The spirit of the
Palo Alto tree should live on."
Historically, the most popular
mascot among alumni has been the
Indian, which represented Stan
ford over 20 years ago, Smider said.
In 1923, the University's ath
letic teams were unofficially called
the Indians, and in 1937, for the
first time, Stanford was identified
with "Li'l Injun," a cartoon char
acter.
After protest over the mascot's
ethnically offensive nature, the
student body voted in 1972 to dis
continue association with the Indi

an, and Stanford resumed its earli
er identity as the Cardinal.
Since its inception in 1987,
Sandelin said, Stanford's active
program in licensing trademarks
has generated $2 million in royal
ties. The establishment of a licens
ing office allows the University to
collect a larger share of the royalties
from sales of items with the logos.
However, sales of Stanford
products have remained "fairly
constant over the past three
years," Sandelin said.
Gladfelter hopes Stanford can
capitalize on having a successful

football program, which will poten
tially generate more sales. "Lots of
t-shirts and sweatshirts are geared
for action figures — something
that moves, rather than a tree,"
she pointed out.
"I don't know how everyone will
respond," she said. "I think [the
Athletics Department] will be very
receptive to whatever we come up
with. We've been looking for some
thing new for a while."
Suggestions for a new must be
submitted to the office by July 15.
Several $500 prizes will be awarded
for ideas that are used.
