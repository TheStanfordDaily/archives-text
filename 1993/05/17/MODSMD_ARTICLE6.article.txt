# Wanted: new logo
## University seeks new design to spark paraphernalia sales 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
In an effort to boost retail sales
of Stanford paraphernalia, the Of
fice of Technology Licensing is
looking for a more dynamic logo to
complement the University's tree
symbol.
Deemed too static and boring,
Stanford's currently trade
marked logos soon will be supple
mented by newer, more animated
icons, said Jon Sandelin, a licens
ing associate in the Office of Tech
nology Licensing.
Licensing officials hope the
new designs will generate addi

According to Maria Gladfelter,
the licensing office's manager of
emblematic ware, proceeds from
logo licensing fund undergradu

Sandelin emphasized that the
office is searching for a new design
to supplement, not replace, the
current logo of the tree superim
posed on the block "S."
"We're looking for a design
that's new and creative,"
Sandelin said, "something that

has a linkage to the history of the
University in a favorable way."
To get new ideas, the licensing
office is holding a contest, open to
all Stanford staff, faculty and stu
dents, to elicit sketches of poten
tial new logos.
The contest "is a test to see
how much interest is out there,
what the faculty, staff and stu
dents think," Gladfelter said.
In addition to the tree, current
ly registered trademarks are the
University seal and the words
"Cardinal" and "Stanford," which
show up on a variety of products
ranging from towels to license
plate rims, and particularly on ap
parel.
The licensing office hopes a
more eye-catching design will
stimulate licensees to create and
sell more products.
"We're kind of boring" now,
and that shows in the licensees'
lack of enthusiasm to bring new
products out on the market,
Sandelin said.
"It's hard to come up interest
