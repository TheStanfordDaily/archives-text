SIMCHA JACOBOVICI
AND HIS CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED DOCUMENTARY
"Balanced and Powerful!
The best film I've seen on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
Bob Simon, CBS News
Wednesday, May 19th at 7:00 PM
Cubberly Auditorium, Stanford University
Free with Student I.D. / $5 all others
THE SCREENING OF THE FILM WILL BE FOLLOWED BY
A DISCUSSION WITH MR. JACOBOVICI
As the optimism of the Washington-based peace talks gives way
to bloody realities on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza,
Deadly Currents is the only film that provides insight
into the ongoing cycle of violence.
