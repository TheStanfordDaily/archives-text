## Union feels upset about University's process in creating new benefit plan 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
While some University staff
members are applauding the ver
satility of the new employee bene
fits plan unveiled last week, the
United Stanford Workers union,
unhappy at being left out of the
process, plans to file a grievance
against the University this Friday.
The new flexible benefit plan,
called "Educated Choices," gives
staff and faculty members a set
number of "credits" for medical
care and lets them choose from
different items in a menu of op
tions, which include life insurance
and long-term care foraged par
ents.
The plan replaces the currently
used "one-size-fits-air benefit
package, which gives all sub
scribers the same basic benefits.
It will not increase employees'
costs, because it converts the indi
vidual cost of the current package
into a number of credits worth the
same amount. Individuals can
then distribute their credits be
tween a host of benefit options.
Employees who choose to receive
fewer benefits can get up to $50 a
month in cash.
Although some Stanford
workers embraced the new plan,
the USW is objecting to the
process by which the benefits
package was created, and will file
a grievance against the University
for not consulting with the union
regarding the new package, ac
cording to Sammy Brooks, a field
representative for the USW.
"The University should not
have made a statement without
negotiating with the union," he
said.
According to Brooks, the Uni
versity is supposed to submit all
new proposals or changes in poli
cies to the union for acceptance or
refusal. The University will have
10 working days to respond, once
the grievance is filed.
In developing the package, the
University did consult with over
100 employees, who took part in
"focus groups" that examined a
flexible-benefits option.
The committee for staff and
faculty benefits that recommend
ed the plan has been toying with
the new benefits options for al
most 18 months, and the plan will
be implemented in 1994, accord
ing to Barbara Butterfield, vice
president for faculty and staff
service.
While the union objects to the
process by which the plan was
made, individual staffers said they
thought the content of the flexible
benefits program is a boon.
"I like the idea," said Diane
Coward, assistant director of the

Haas Center. "Overall, I think it
is great that the University is
going to be giving us some choices
in our benefits. ... I'd like to see
what it is they are going to let us
choose (the options) from."
Although the University sent
each faculty and staff member a
copy of a "Total Compensation
News" newsletter which unveiled
a general outline of the new plan,
full details on the plan won't be

available until September.
Susan Kalter, a secretary in
the planning department, said,
"Without seeing exactly what the
plan is, it is probably a good idea.
. . . It all depends on the number
of credits."
The union was unable to com
ment on specific contents of the
benefits plan, as it has yet to
secure factual information
describing the plan.

In addition to the new benefits
plan, the Office of Total Compen
sation is changing one of its four
health-care packages from Blue
Shield to Triple Option. If Butter
field's projections are correct, the
new Triple Option will save the
University $2 million each year,
because it gives incentives for
individuals who are double-cov
ered with health insurance to
cash-out, Butterfield said.
