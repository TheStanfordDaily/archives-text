## Union feels upset about University's process in creating new benefit plan 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
While some University staff
members are applauding the ver
satility of the new employee bene
fits plan unveiled last week, the
United Stanford Workers union,
unhappy at being left out of the
process, plans to file a grievance
against the University this Friday.
The new flexible benefit plan,
called "Educated Choices," gives
staff and faculty members a set
number of "credits" for medical
care and lets them choose from
different items in a menu of op
tions, which include life insurance
and long-term care foraged par
ents.
The plan replaces the currently
used "one-size-fits-air benefit
package, which gives all sub
scribers the same basic benefits.
It will not increase employees'
costs, because it converts the indi
vidual cost of the current package
into a number of credits worth the
same amount. Individuals can
then distribute their credits be
tween a host of benefit options.
Employees who choose to receive
fewer benefits can get up to $50 a
month in cash.
Although some Stanford
workers embraced the new plan,
the USW is objecting to the
process by which the benefits
package was created, and will file
a grievance against the University
for not consulting with the union
regarding the new package, ac
cording to Sammy Brooks, a field
representative for the USW.
"The University should not
have made a statement without
negotiating with the union," he
said.
According to Brooks, the Uni
versity is supposed to submit all
new proposals or changes in poli
cies to the union for acceptance or
refusal. The University will have
10 working days to respond, once
the grievance is filed.
In developing the package, the
University did consult with over
100 employees, who took part in
"focus groups" that examined a
flexible-benefits option.
The committee for staff and
faculty benefits that recommend
ed the plan has been toying with
the new benefits options for al
most 18 months, and the plan will
be implemented in 1994, accord
ing to Barbara Butterfield, vice
president for faculty and staff
service.
