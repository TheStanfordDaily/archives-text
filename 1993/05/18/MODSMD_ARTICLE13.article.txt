SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — An international peace plan was
declared dead by Bosnia's Serbs yester
day and ignored by Croats and Muslims
battling for the strategic southern city of
Mostar.
Radovan Karadzic, president of the
breakaway Serbian Republic, told The
Associated Press that preliminary results
of a weekend vote on the plan indicated
"a vast majority" of "no" votes. Bosnian
Serb radio said 95 to 99 percent of votes
tallied by yesterday from seven munici
palities had rejected the plan.
In Washington, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said now that the
peace plan has been rejected, the United
States will talk with European allies
about using force or new diplomatic
approaches to try to end the war in

Bosnia.
The State Department also endorsed
placing monitors on the Bosnian border
to see if Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic makes good on his pledge to
stop the supply of arms to Bosnian Serb
rebels.
The most powerful Bosnian Serb com
mander warned of retaliation against any
outside force.
"If they bomb me, I'll bomb Ixmdon,"
boasted Gen. Ratko Mladic, commander
of the Serbian Republic Army.
Montenegro and Serbia are all that
remain of the former Yugoslavia since
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina
and Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia,
sparking a war that has left more than
138,000 people dead or missing the past
13 months.

Pearlier this month Mladic convinced
the parliamentarians who had been lean
ing toward accepting a U.N. peace plan
advocated by Karadzic to instead reject it.
Serbs continued yesterday to breach a
nearly two-week truce with the Muslims
around the northern city of Brcko, by try
ing to oust outgunned Muslim troops.
Muslim-Croat fighting for Mostar con
tinued for the eighth day, further under
scoring the difficulties of ending the war
— both Muslims and Croats have signed
the peace plan rejected anew Sunday by
their Serb foes.
The U.N. peace plan calls for the cre
ation of 10 provinces in Bosnia-Herzegov
ina along ethnic lines: Three each for the
Muslims, Serbs and Croats and a 10th,
the capital, Sarajevo, to be jointly admin
istered.
