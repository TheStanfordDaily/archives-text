The demise of Beat the
Bookstore reveals the
ASSU's self-absorption

The recent decision to
close down Beat the Book
store is yet another example
of the ASSU's pattern of coming up
with good ideas and never follow
ing through in the best way for stu
dents.
Between summer storage and
renovating the basement of Tresid
der, the ASSU seems to talk a lot
about the great things it can do for
students, and then either acts in an
irresponsible way or doesn't act at
all. The ASSU needs to focus its
actions and goals; but most of all, it
must realize that its inaction is
hurting students.
For example, by discontinuing
Beat the Bookstore, students are
now forced to deal with the
monopoly of The Bookstore on
their own. They have no options
but to sell their books back to The
Bookstore, unless they happen to
be lucky and stumble upon some
one who needs a book they have.
The ASSU should not just let the
whole concept of "Beat the Book
store" die, but should instead real
ize its mistake and try to remedy it.
By the beginning of next year,
the ASSU should work to find a
way for students to still sell their
books to one another, even though
it may not necessarily be with a
profit to the association. The
ASSU's pattern of either trying to
do everything by itself, or doing
nothing at all, must end.
For example, the costs of main
taining Beat the Bookstore were
mostly salaries and maintenance
costs, such as renting tables and
chairs. At the same time, students
received only 85 percent of every
book they sold, with the other 15
percent going to the project.
The ASSU should have realized
that all it needed to create —rather
than another business project of its

own — was a way for students to
get in touch with one another, such
as a computerized system.
The best way to help students is
to eliminate the middleman — as
President Clinton is trying to do
with the student-loan program.
With a computerized system for
students to contact one another
about books, there would be no
maintenance costs or salaries for
the ASSU to worry about, and stu
dents would benefit even more, by
receiving 100 percent of what they
sold the book for.
In the same way, the ASSU tried
to do too much with summer stor
age. Instead of trying to completely
solve the problem on its own by
buying the storage bins, the best
solution would probably have been
to obtain a contract with an off
campus facility and subsidize the
costs for students. That way, stu
dents could still obtain secure and
reasonable storage, but not at the
cost incurred had they rented the
storage on their own.
Like so many politicians of the
day, many ASSU senators got elect
ed on promises of actions that
would be of great benefit to stu
dents — including storage, Tresid
der and cable television in stu
dents' rooms. However, once elect
ed, they either realize that their
promises were impossible to keep
or they think of the profits possible
for the ASSU first. There are cur
rently only a few student services
provided by the ASSU, and it's time
that remedying this situation
became the group's top priority.
Certain student services provid
ed by the ASSU do need to have
paid managers or maintenance
costs — such as Lecture Notes.
However, the ASSU needs to real
ize that the group is the students'
only form of representation. If, in
order to help students, the ASSU
must help students help them
selves, by merely planning and cre
ating ways for students to sell
books or obtain storage, then that
is what the ASSU must do, regard
less of profit potential.
It's time the ASSU proves exact
ly where its priorities lie.
