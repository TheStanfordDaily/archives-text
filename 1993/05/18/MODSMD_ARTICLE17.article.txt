## A 						real, live horror show 
### 
IT WAS THE BEST of times, it was
the worst of times. That just about
sums it up perfectly, if you take out
the "best of times" part. It was the
"Rocky Horror Picture Show," and I
wanted to leave.
I should have known I wouldn't like
the "Rocky Horror Picture Show." And
as a matter of fact, if "C'mon. 'Carpe,'
dude" wasn't such a strangely effective
instrument of peer pressure, I probably
never would have gone.
But I've always liked Robin Williams,
and didn't really stop to think that in
going to the "Rocky Horror Picture
Show" I would be "Carpe"-ing an
evening of entertainment with the Paly
High Class of 1995's most unsavory ele
ments.
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
plays at midnight every weekend at the
aters around the country. And for those
of you unfamiliar with this phenomenon,
a cult following regularly attends these
showings and acts out the campy, per
verse drama as the real thing plays on the
screen.
As I say, I should have known I
wouldn't like it. Anyone who can better
identify with Andrea than Dylan should
stay away from events where cross-dress
ing is encouraged.
Without getting into the whole thing
too deeply, let's just say that within 15
minutes of entering the theater, I had a

healthy amount of lipstick applied to my
forehead. Too much lipstick. Way too
much. The kind of lipstick that Andrea
would want nothing to do with.
After a while, I started to feel sorry for
the regulars at the Varsity Theater. I felt
sorry for them, because I thought they
probably had nothing to look forward to
each week aside from this "Rocky Horror
Picture Show." Then I started thinking
about next week's "Melrose Place." Then
I started to feel a little hypocritical.
Somehow, though, I knew there was a
difference.
The people at the Varsity Theater's
performance of "The Rocky Horror Pic
ture Show" were, how can I say, malad
justed and a bit scary. Being from
Detroit, for a couple moments there I was
thinking, "Ahhh, it's good to be home."
But I was at Stanford, in Palo Alto.
And in a strange kind of way, it made
me feel kind of good inside to know that
Palo Alto had people like this. It gave me
the same feeling as seeing Palo Alto's 7-
II convenience store for the first time.
It's the feeling you get when you eat a
ballpark frank or read USA Today: "I'm
sharing this experience with America.
There might be something twisted, shal
low or unsanitary about it, but this is
America."
The people at "The Rocky Horror Pic
ture Show" didn't give me good enter
tainment, but they did give me comfort.

They assured me that just a couple blocks
from this pristine campus — in a town
that shuts down with a vengeance at 10
o'clock — there lurks a real America. An
America not too unlike the one in
Detroit, Philadelphia or Montana. All
right, maybe not Montana.
It's an America I've seen precious lit
tle of since I've been at Stanford, and one
I'm going to see a whole lot of for the rest
of my life. And although my stay here has
been a nice one, it's time I face the facts.
We can only delay reality here so long
amid the palm trees, over-present vale
dictorians and conversations chock full of
Nietzsche references.
I didn't like "The Rocky Horror Pic
ture Show" that much, but it was
refreshing in a way. It reminded me of a
world I used to know back in high school.
A world that had little to do with palm
trees and even less to do with the Norton
Critical Edition series. It's time to enter
that world again, ugly as it may be.
Give me a Slurpee, for that is the
essence of America.

John Ford prefers Slurpees to Icees, but
thinks the Icee polar bear is really cool.
You can see him hanging out at 7-11 any
Saturday night.
