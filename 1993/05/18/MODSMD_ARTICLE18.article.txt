BSU member explains background of Malcolm X week

lAM WRITING IN response to article
which appeared in yesterday's Daily,
for I believe more clarification is
needed to adequately represent the
Black Student Union's intentions in
presenting the week.
Throughout this week, the BSU is
holding Malcolm X Week '93. The
theme for this year's week is "To Marry
Our Thought to the Plight of the Poor
and Jobless: By Any Means Necessary."
The theme is taken from a quote by
Zygmunt Bauman in his text Legisla
tors and Interpreters: On Modernity,
Post-Modernity and Intellectuals in
which he argues, . . The 'mass of
unemployed and precarious casual
workers'; the new poor, . . . whom the
latest technological revolution, the ulti
mate triumph of rationality, has
deprived (some think permanently) of
an economic role. They suffer. Intellec
tuals feel and express their pity, but
somehow refrain from proposing to
marry their thought with this particular
variety of suffering."
This week is an attempt to "marry
our thought" to this "particular variety
of suffering," particularly to that of the
"reserved army of poor and jobless,"
blacks of the inner cities of the First

Worlds and those of the Third and
Fourth Worlds, a variety of suffering
that must be confronted head-on, in
order to fully emancipate humanity. In
"visibilizing" the plight of this popula
tion group (which necessarily visibilizes
the poor and jobless of all "races" —
whose suffering is inextricably linked to
theirs') we shall explore ways in which,
in the words of Prof. Sylvia Wynter, we
can "undo their . . . condemned status."
Wednesday night's main program, in
line with the goal of the week, welcomes
Prof. Harold Cruse of the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor. Starting at 7
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium, Prof. Cruse
will address, as he has consistently
maintained, the necessity of doing some
"hard thinking" in order to offset the
"poverty, underemployment," and social
pathologies stemming from the inability
of our present "mode of rationality" and
its concomitant institutions, to provide
an "economic role" for the Black under
class — which since the '60s has been
made into the new pariah . . as a
result of the relatively improved condi
tions that have impelled many blacks
out of the ghettos and into the sub
urbs," according to Sylvia Wynter. Pro
fessor Cruse's brilliant historical analy

sis "produces a critical framework for
an understanding of the civil rights
movement of the past and a potential
agenda for the civil rights movement of
the future," as related by the L.A.
Times Book Review.
In 1903, W.E.B. Dubois noted that
"the problem of the twentieth century
is the problem of the color line— the
relation of the darker to the lighter
races of men [and womenj in Asia and
Africa, in America, and the islands of
the seas." Fifty years later, he would
note that there exists a connection
between the "color line" and the distri
bution of "resources" — i.e., food,
wealth, jobs, etc. — at a global level.
Thursday nights' discussion — which
starts at 7 p.m. in the Toyon Lounge,
and is entitled, "We're Dying Under the
Weight of the Evidence: Poverty, Job
lessness, the Black Diaspora, and the
Institution of Knowledge" — will look
at poverty and joblessness in the black
diaspora, as it functions at the world
systemic level, as opposed to at the
level of the nation. Prof. Sylvia Wynter
will join us in a discussion on the func
tioning of our present "mode of ratio
nality" at the global level and the role
of our present order of knowledge in

"creating" and "maintaining" this par
ticular rationality — a rationality that
condemns four-fifths of the world's
inhabitants to only one-fifth of its
resources, while the other one-fifth
makes use of four-fifths (and emits 70
percent of the earth's pollution). The
questions she will pose, then, are —
unlike the biologists who are attempt
ing to address the AIDS epidemic —
why are we unable to undo the prob
lems of poverty and joblessness? What
are the limits of our present organiza
tion of "social" knowledge? What is the
solution?
Tonight, join us in the Ujamaa TV
Lounge at 7 p.m. for a discussion enti
tled "But It's the Black One That's
Dying: Revisiting the Multicultural,
Multiracial Democracy." The discussion
will be prefaced by the video "The Issue
is Race," featuring activists and policy
makers from Cornel West to Sharon
Pratt Dixon to Sistah Souljah.
The Black Student Union hopes that
everyone comes out to partake in these
events, because for the first time in
human history, we can honestly say
that we have a collective destiny.
