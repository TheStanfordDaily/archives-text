# Jump in cost of bicycle storage is much larger than any fair increase
## 
### 
Several days ago I saw a flier posted
for student bike storage this summer —
a service I took advantage of last sum
mer that was convenient, hassle-free and
affordable at a cost of $10 for my bike. I
was astonished to the point of writing
this letter to see that the cost of bike
storage has ballooned to $30 for this
summer.

I contacted the Office of Student
Housing Operations, which is responsi
ble for the price increase, and the
explanation I received was that the
cost of bike storage hasn't increased in
10 to 15 years. Definitely some
increase is justified here, but a tripling
of price?
The consumer price index for the
past 10 to 15 years justifies an
increase of 40 to 80 percent, depending
on exactly how long ago it was that the
price was set at $10. Certainly the Stu
dent Housing Operations' 200 percent
jump is a far reach from this (unless,
of course, they are using the same

numbers the University uses for
tuition hikes).
The truth is that there is an
exploitative element in all of this; the
powers that be believe they can get
away with this, due to the recognition
that bikes left out over the summer
most likely will be stolen and the fact
that the rest of summer storage has
been cut would likely lead to an infla
tion of local storage rates, thereby
enabling the cost of bike storage to be
artificially inflated. As it stands now,
the University is adding insult to
injury with this exorbitant increase;
on top of the $150-plus dollars that

many students will have no choice but
to pay for summer storage, comes this
latest expense. It is especially unfair to
do this at a time in the year when
most students' funds are severely
depleted.
I urge the Office of Student Housing
Operations to reconsider their price
increase, to a level somewhere in the $15
to $20 range, and until then, I would
encourage students to seek out alterna
tive means for summer bike storage,
such as leaving bikes at local friends'
houses.
