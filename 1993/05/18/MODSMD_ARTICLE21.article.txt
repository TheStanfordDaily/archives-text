Professor clarifies his
remarks in article on
Asian-American studies
I'm writing to give a fuller and more
accurate account of my conversation
with your reporter on May 12, part of
which was represented in your article on
May 13, "Asian-American studies classes
face uncertain future next year." In gen
eral, in that conversation I emphasized
that in order for any reasonable and
intelligent proposal for an Asian-Ameri
can Studies major to go forward, discus
sion of the issue must take place among
students, staff, faculty, administrators
and community members. No group in
isolation can put forward a proposal that
would have any chance of being taken
seriously.
When consulted by students, I sug
gested a one- or two-day workshop be
convened, inviting participation from all
the above constituencies. Those who are
interested in such a major need to know

the proper procedures for such a propos
al and the issues involved in any such
institutional change, those skeptical
about the need for such a program need
to have their questions addressed, and a
sense of curricular goals and institution
al resources must be developed. The arti
cle completely left out any mention of
that key element, and my subsequent
remarks thus lost the proper context.
I stressed to your reporter that, at
this stage, we need to think creatively
and critically, and that we should not
assume anything before we convene the
workshop. For instance, when asked
about possible costs for the program, I
said that we simply do not know what
curricular goals would be most desirable;
therefore, one cannot tell if, and how
many, new faculty would be needed.
This means the costs could be relatively
low or rather significant. Your article
only mentioned the first ("Palumbo-Liu,
however, said, 'I don't think that [a pro
gram] would be that expensive. The fac
ulty's here; it's just a matter of adminis
trative support.' ")
While support from the administra-

tion is obviously crucial to the proposal,
the "administrative support" referred to
in the quote refers to staff support for
the program, not moral or financial sup
port from the University administration.
Second, I mentioned this as one possibil
ity; I also mentioned in the same breath
the possibility that we would need to
hire other faculty, which would make
the enterprise more expensive.
The whole point is that we need to
have wider and more concrete discus
sions before any proposal can be credi
ble, otherwise an important possibility
for educational studies at Stanford
might be sunk by ill-informed opinion. I
agree with Prof. Chang that the chances
of getting a degree-granting program do
not look good in the immediate future
(and I believe that is what Prof. Chang
meant). However, it is not at all impossi
ble that one could be established, if a
well thought-out and persuasive propos
al is written — and a workshop such as
the one I have suggested would seem a
good start.

Article on abolishing
Honor Code misses the
essence of the problem
I am writing in response to Bernie
Luger's article concerning the value of
the Honor Code. Although I can appreci
ate his frustration with those who violate
the code, his moralizing is way off base.
Luger states, "Frankly I don't care"
about why students feel pressured into
cheating. Maybe if he took a less combat
ive attitude towards his students, and
took the time to consider their situation,
he might find out just what is going on
in the classes he teaches. Most of the
students at this school suffer under the
ambiguous message that the university
experience is both for growing and learn
ing and for getting good enough grades
for further pursuits such as medical
school. Many of the students that Luger
and I teach are stuck in a grade-inflated
scholastic environment where the
emphasis is on learning what chemistry

will be on the test, and not on learning
chemistry. Indeed, just when a bright
young mind thinks they have finished
the drudgery of jumping through aca
demic hurdles, and they have reached an
institution of higher learning, they
encounter Luger, who seems more con
cerned with watching them take a test
than teaching them the material on it.
As to his criteria for proving an inci
dence of cheating, having a previous
record of academic violations is not near
ly sufficient proof. Does Luger intend to
"blacklist" students who have been
merely accused of cheating? He suggests
that a student who has been suspected
of cheating "be made to take all exams
in the front of the testing room for the
rest of his career . . . and if the student
is in fact honest, no harm will come of it
.. . Luger seems to think turning up
the pressure on students will make mat
ters better — that they only need a little
more discipline. Maybe a better idea
would be to attach less of a stigma in
getting a B.
