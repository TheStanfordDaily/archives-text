## Runnin' Rebels stage late rally, down Cardinal 6-4 Batters fall to 26-26 despite Reed's solid showing, will host UCLA this weekend to close out season 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
On a cold and blustery day at Sunken
Diamond, the Cardinal baseball team
slopped its way to a 6-4 loss, dropping
the rubber match of a three-game series
against Nevada-Las Vegas.
In sliding back to the .500 mark at
26-26, Stanford limps into their season
ending home set with UCLA without a
series win in over a month.
The Rebels (24-25) took a 2-1 lead
into the bottom of the fourth. Then,
with two outs, freshman Rich Crowe
drilled a two-out double to left-center
field and scored on a Steve Carver single
to center.
Crowe, used only in spots for most of
the season, started in left field last
weekend against California, and has
shown no signs of leaving. In his five
starts, the Huntington Beach native
has gone 10-for-19 to raise his season
average over 200 points to .350.
But the Cardinal could do no further
damage in the fourth, as Dusty Allen
fanned with the bases loaded to end the
inning. On the afternoon, Stanford
managed only nine hits, while leaving
17 men on base.
However, the Cardinal came right
back and jumped to a 4-2 lead in the
fifth. With two outs, Cale Carter got hit

in the foot by a Derek Cotton pitch. The
next batter, A.J. Hinch, stroked a 1-2
pitch well over the trees in left field.
The freshman catcher, one of Stan
ford's most consistent offensive per
formers, had two extra-base knocks in
extending his hitting streak to eight
games.
Cardinal starter Dan Reed, coming
off a complete-game win against Cal last
weekend, looked sharp against UNLV
as well. He did squander a two-run dou
ble to Lino Diaz in the first, but Diaz
had punished Cardinal pitching all
weekend, finishing the series with five
hits.
However, Reed began to lose his con
trol in the seventh. After whiffing Steve
Niermann on three pitches, the left
hander walked Desmond Thompkins
and Jon Poison. Thompkins then stole
third and scored on a sacrifice fly to
bring the Rebels within one at 4-3.
Reed's troubles continued in the
eighth. John Coats opened the frame
with a fly ball well over the head of cen
terfielder Carter. Carter turned,
appeared to have a beat on the ball,
turned again and the ball sailed over his
head for a double.
Diaz then ripped a hard grounder to
third. Jimmy Noriega — who came in as
a defensive replacement after a Carver
error earlier in the game — couldn't

handle the smash, and Diaz was safe at
first on an infield single. Another
grounder to third scored Coats, and the
game was tied, 4-4.
The score remained knotted as Reed
pitched into the ninth. With one out, the
speedy Poison picked up an infield sin
gle. The Rebels' stolen base leader and
the go-ahead run, Poison was, to say the
least, a threat to steal. Reed threw high
to first on his first pickoff attempt, and
threw wildly on the second, allowing
Poison to advance to third.
But in the end, it didn't matter.
Coats hammered his fourth home run
of the series, a two-run shot to left
which put UNLV up 6-4, the final mar
gin of victory.
Reed (4-5) went 8 2-3 innings to
reach the final frame for a second
straight time in a valiant effort. Over
his last three outings, Reed has a very
respectable 3.52 earned-run average.
Stanford threatened one final time in
the ninth. Carter singled to deep short
stop and advanced to third on a Hinch
double into the left field corner. But
with one out and two runners in scoring
position, Crowe lined out to center and
Hansen struck out to end the rally and
the game.
The Cardinal wraps up its season
this weekend with a three-game home
series against UCLA.
