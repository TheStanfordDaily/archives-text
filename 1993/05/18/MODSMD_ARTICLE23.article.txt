## 
### Andy Eiser Editorial staff 
Team competition concluded Sunday at the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships in Gainesville, Fla.,
but the Cardinal's six singles players and all three of its
doubles teams received a second chance at a national
title as the individual championships began yesterday.
However, only two Stanford representatives —
junior Laxmi Poruri and senior Heather Willens —
managed to survive a grueling three-match schedule
(two singles and one doubles) and keep their champi
onship dreams alive, advancing to the second day of the
four-day tournament.

Poruri, the No. 2 seed in the singles draw, took on a
dominant aura in taking 24 of 26 games from her two
opponents. She crushed Oklahoma State's Cristina
Sirianni, 6-1, 6-0, then handled Rebecca Jensen of
Kansas, 6-0, 6-1, to qualify for the round of 16. Up next
for Poruri is North Carolina's Cinda Gurney, an alpha
betical (ninth to 16th) seed who needed three sets to
defeat freshman Beth Berris, the Cardinal's No. 5 play
er, in the second round.
Willens, the tournament's fourth seed, did not make
the same immediate impact as Poruri, but nevertheless
soundly won a pair of straight-set matches to run her
record in Gainesville to a perfect 6-0. In the first round,
Miko Hemsi of Arizona played the part of Willens' vic-

Tim for the second time in three days, falling by the
same 6-0,6-1 score with which Willens dismissed her in
the team semifinals on Saturday. Willens then topped
Southern Methodist's Kelli-Ann Johnston 6-3, 6-4,
earning the right to face Cammie Foley of UCLA in the
round of 16 tomorrow.
In addition to their individual accomplishments,
Poruri and Willens teamed up to tag a 6-2, 6-2 loss on
Wisconsin's Amanda Gregory and Marija Neubauer
and advance to the second round of the 32-team dou
bles draw.
In other singles action. Kim Shasby, the Cardinal's
No. 3 player, had earned an alphabetical seed in the sin
gles draw, but was outlasted by Notre Dame's Wendy

Crabtree 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 in the first round. At No. 4, Kris
tine Kurth drew into an imposing situation and could
not stop the nation's No. 1 player — Florida's Lisa Ray
mond — in a 6-3, 6-1 first-round loss. Rounding out
Stanford's delegation, No. 6 Amy Chiminello downed
Sonya Olejar of Pepperdine (6-4,6-2) before bowing out
to Arizona State's Kori Davidson (6-2, 6-3) in the sec
ond round.
In other doubles action, Chiminello/Shasby drew
top-seeded Keirsten Alley and Pam Nelson of Califor
nia and dropped straight sets, 6-4, 6-2. Meanwhile,
Kurth/Berris faced Indiana's fourth-seeded tandem of
Deborah Edelman and Rachel Epstein and fell in three
sets, 6-4,6-7, 6-3.
