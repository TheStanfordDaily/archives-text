# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Defeat, while always painful, can some
times bring out the best in a competitor. In
fact, in the face of adversity — with all else
being equal — the athlete who can summon
the most character and heart above their nat
ural abilities will prevail. This week, two Car
dinal netters — Chris Cocotos and Heather
Willens — showed their true colors at the
NCAA Tennis Championships, preserving
Stanford pride in the face of a pair of Texas
Longhorn stampedes. Their bold efforts may

go unrecognized when noting who wins the
national titles, but they have not escaped our
attention, earning The Daily's Athlete of the
Week honors.
Cocotos, a junior from West Palm Beach,
Fla., tallied Stanford's first point in both of its
matches at the Men's Championships in
Athens, Ga. Saturday, he summarily dis
missed Colorado's Stefan Figley 6-2, 6-1 at No.
4 singles as the Cardinal disposed of the Buf
faloes 6-0 in under two hours. On the heels of
that convincing victory in the round of 16,
hopes ran high that Cocotos and the fourth-
Cardinal could repeat their amazing
1992 national-championship run.
However, those hopes evaporated as quick
ly as they arose, as a 5-2 ouster at the hands of
Texas on Sunday eliminated Stanford in the
quarterfinal round, three victories shy of its
title dreams. Cocotos could certainly not be
blamed for the shortfall, though, as he gutted
out a 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 win over the Longhorns'
Ernesto Ponce. While his win staved off the
inevitable, giving the Cardinal a brief respite
after falling behind 4-0, it was not good
enough to turn the tide.

Willens, a senior from Los Angeles, com
pleted her Stanford team career in disappoint
ment, as the Cardinal fell to a surprising Texas
squad by an identical 5-2 score in the final
match of the Women's Championships in
Gainesville, Fla. However, the undoing of Wil
lens' team does not reflect the desire of its No.
2 player, who was seeking the third national
crown of her Stanford career.

After notching a straight-set win over Notre
Dame's Sherri Vitale in the Cardinal's 5-0
pasting of the Fighting Irish on Thursday, Wil
lens pulled out a 7-6,6-3 victory over Georgia's
Stacy Sheppard in quarterfinal play on Friday.
Willens then proved her durability in the
semifinal and final rounds, as she demolished
Arizona's Miko Hemsi 6-0, 6-1 on Saturday,
before taking her fourth win in as many days
by bettering the Longhorns' Kelly Pace 6-2, 7-
6 on Sunday.
