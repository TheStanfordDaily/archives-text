# Bowl Coalition to stay

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP)
— The college football bowl coali
tion was essentially a success
after its first season and will
retain its format at least until
1995, one of its chief architects
said yesterday.
"Three years is a pretty good
look," Atlantic Coast Conference
Commissioner Gene Corrigan
said of the agreement, which runs
through 1995. "There is no need
for anybody to do anything until
that third year is up because I
think you'll see a pretty good
average of what should happen."
However, Corrigan said at the
ACC's spring meeting there were
problems with the coalition,
which involves the champions
from the ACC, the Big East and
Notre Dame facing champions of
other conferences in bowls.
One problem involved an ACC
team. The Cotton Bowl passed
over then-No. 4 Florida State in
favor of lower-ranked Notre
Dame, a national drawing card
for television, to play No. 3 and
undefeated Texas A&M. That
sent the Seminoles to the Orange
Bowl to play Nebraska with no
chance of winning the national
title.
"That was a glitch that should
not have occurred and they ended
up paying a big price for that,"
Florida State athletic director
Bob Gojn said.
Notre Dame beat the Aggies in
a lopsided game.
Corrigan also said Stanford

had to play its tier-two coalition
bowl game in Florida, some 3,000
miles from home. Few fans
attended.
"As with anything in the first
year there could have been things
that went better," he said. "What
we always find out is that you
have to have regional teams in
your bowls."
Interestingly, the dream
matchup of No. 1 Miami vs. No. 2
Alabama for the national champi
onship in the Sugar Bowl — cre
ated by the coalition — wasn't all
good, Corrigan said.
"One of the problems ... is we
ended up with No. 1 vs. No. 2 and
that kind of relegated all the
other bowls to a position that just
happens every once in a while.
While it was great for the fans
and the media to have No. 1 vs.
No. 2 and everybody got fired up
about it, it certainly didn't help
the Orange Bowl or the Cotton
Bowl or the Rose Bowl or any of
them. We know that is not going
to happen every year," he said.
Overall, the ACC has benefitted
from the coalition, Corrigan said.
"What's happened because of
the coalition is we're getting our
two, three and four teams set in
bowls and it makes it a whole lot
more orderly and a whole lot less
stressful."
Corrigan also said an agree
ment is in the works with three
other bowls that are interested in
securing a fourth team from the
ACC.
