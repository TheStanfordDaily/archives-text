# Racial slur greets SLAC employee
## Knife found stuck on door with anti-Japanese message 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
A Japanese-American worker at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter arrived at his office yesterday
morning to find a knife buried in
his door and the words "Go home
Jap" written on a chalkboard.
Chuck Taniguchi, a storeroom
manger in SLAC's Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory,
says he has endured harassment
— including racial jokes — in the
past. But after this incident,
Taniguchi said, "I start to become
aware that the joke is not so much
game-playing anymore."
In addition to the racist mes
sage, which Taniguchi said was
"clearly written in bold letters,"
someone had plunged a knife into
Taniguchi's door, just above his
nameplate. Someone had also spit
on the knob of the door to his office,

taken down a picture of Cesar
Chavez he had posted as a memor
ial to the late labor leader and
sliced through documents he had
posted on the board.
San Mateo County sherifFs offi
cials and SLAC security personnel
are investigating the event.
Taniguchi said that, while he
has been the target of smaller inci
dents of harassment in the past
few years, yesterday's attack was
the most serious and disturbing.
"I'm starting to realize that this
comes more now as personal retal
iation, it comes down to race,
rather than a personal conflict
which I wasn't even aware of," he
said. "I'm very emotionally upset
about this."
In past harassment incidents,
Taniguchi found mucus smeared
on his doorknob and two nails
stuck in each of his car's right-side
tires, which he said caused both
tires to blow out while he was driv
ing home on Interstate 280 in
March of this year.
SLAC officials expressed dis
may at the racist episode.
"This is really ugly and unac
ceptable behavior, and we're not
tolerating it," said Lee Lyon, per
sonnel director at SLAC. Lyon said
the center is "talking to everybody
who might know what is going on"
to try and find the culprit.
Rick Yeager, a security officer at

SLAC who is investigating the
occurrence, said he worked on the
case all day yesterday, but did not
know exactly how long the investi
gation would take. San Mateo
County sheriff's officials said they
could not comment on the case
until tomorrow, after the filing of
an official report.
Although other SLAC employ
ees have experienced smaller inci
dents of harassment in the past,
"this is the first time we've had
something as repulsive as this,
where they use racial epithets,"
said Suevon Gee, who deals with
affirmative-action questions at
SLAC. "The person involved in
(harassing Taniguchi] is not the
kind of employee we want on our

staff."
While the investigation goes on,
Taniguchi has taken an adminis
trative leave of absence for a few
days. After that time, he said, he
will decide whether to return to
SLAC or not.
"I just want to report to work
and put in my eight hours and be
productive. I really love my work,"
Taniguchi said. However, he
added, "I don't even know if I want
to return back to my work now,
because of this.
"What's next? Do I need to start
worrying about driving down the
road and possibly have shots taken
at me?" Taniguchi asked. "I don't
know what to do. I really don't
know."
