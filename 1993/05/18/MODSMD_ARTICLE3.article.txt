# Racial slur greets SLAC employee
## Knife found stuck on door with anti-Japanese message 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
A Japanese-American worker at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter arrived at his office yesterday
morning to find a knife buried in
his door and the words "Go home
Jap" written on a chalkboard.
Chuck Taniguchi, a storeroom
manger in SLAC's Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory,
says he has endured harassment
— including racial jokes — in the
past. But after this incident,
Taniguchi said, "I start to become
aware that the joke is not so much
game-playing anymore."
In addition to the racist mes
sage, which Taniguchi said was
"clearly written in bold letters,"
someone had plunged a knife into
Taniguchi's door, just above his
nameplate. Someone had also spit
on the knob of the door to his office,

taken down a picture of Cesar
Chavez he had posted as a memor
ial to the late labor leader and
sliced through documents he had
posted on the board.
San Mateo County sherifFs offi
cials and SLAC security personnel
are investigating the event.
Taniguchi said that, while he
has been the target of smaller inci
dents of harassment in the past
few years, yesterday's attack was
the most serious and disturbing.
"I'm starting to realize that this
comes more now as personal retal
iation, it comes down to race,
rather than a personal conflict
which I wasn't even aware of," he
said. "I'm very emotionally upset
about this."
In past harassment incidents,
Taniguchi found mucus smeared
on his doorknob and two nails
