# Author Vonnegut speaks to 1,200 on family, meditation
## 'We've been put on Earth to fart around'

"You have been put on Earth to fart
around," sermonized author Kurt Vonnegut
to an audience of about 1,200 last night in
Memorial Auditorium.
And fart around he did. Ranting against
the advent of computers, the death of the ex
tended family and the limited scope of West
ern literary criticism, Vonnegut presented
himself as a likeable curmudgeon without a
plan of attack.
Although the speech was titled "How to
Get a Job Like Mine," Vonnegut, the author
of best-selling books like "Cat's Cradle" and
"Slaughterhouse Five" felt no responsibility
to address this topic — or any other.
After warning the audience that writing
books is a lonely profession losing out to an
increasingly illiterate audience controlled by
his ex-son-in-law Geraldo Rivera, Vonnegut
told his audience to go into the arts.
"If you really want to hurt your parents —
and you don't have nerve enough to be a ho
mosexual — the least you can do is go into the
arts."
Vonnegut also commented on another
popular way in which Stanford students hurt
their parents: "I heard what the tuition was
here and I must say that's a very strong ar
gument in favor of birth control"
The 70-year-old Vonnegut spouted out his
self-made brand of '60s rhetoric in a catchy,
Arlo Guthrie style urging the audience to

practice transcendental meditation.
Optimistic about the future of race rela
tions and censorship, Vonnegut looked for
other reasons for the imminent decline and
fall of the American empire.
The main problem with this country, the
honorary president of the American Human
ist Society explained, is the disintegration of
the extended family.
"I think we can do without extended fami
lies about as well as we can do without vita
min C. The nuclear family is too small to sur
vive. If anyone gets sick, the whole thing is
over."
Vonnegut also suggested that the audi
ence should read more, because "it puts you
in a cool, trance-like state." And, he suggest
ed, in deference to fellow Hoosier and fellow
socialist Eugene V. Debs, that the audience
try to become saints by "behaving decently in
an indecent society."
Behaving decently, Vonnegut said, in
cludes a heavy dose of "farting around." Al
though he owns a computer — Apple gave
him a Macintosh and then put him in their
annual report two days later — he only uses it
to play chess, he said.
The computer, he explained, should not be
celebrated.
"Don't you know the only purpose of the
machine is to knock you down to minimum
wage, no matter how smart you are."
Instead, he explained, avoiding the com-
