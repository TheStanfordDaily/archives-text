# Conception of 'Conceptions'
## Two seniors produce lasting literary journal 
### Joel Stein Senior staff writer 
Early in December, in a bout of childlike exu
berance, seniors Miranda Hope and Bob Fitzger
ald gathered late one night in their Casa Italiana
hallway to design their own literary magazine.
Weighing in at 112 pages, Conceptions is lit
erally one of the largest literary journals to hit
campus in recent years. Hope said the main goal
of the project was to create an artistic forum that
"students would keep on their shelf instead of
throwing out or recycling."
The magazine will be sold in White Plaza this
week for "one or two dollars."
With no previous publishing experience,
Hope and Fitzgerald were able to garner $1,700
without ever soliciting funds at a dorm meeting:
$1,200 came from the ASSU Publications Board
and the rest from the English and Art Depart
ments.
"It was surprisingly easy to get money. I
didn't think we'd get near that much," Hope said

Submissions, she said, were no more difficult
to drum up than the cash.
Through fliers, invitations and a whopping
$50 prize to the best submission, Hope and
Fitzgerald received over 100 pieces of writing
and 50 photographs. The prize went to Stegner
