## Only non-profit businesses allowed

Students craving a late-night
burger and milkshake will now
have to consider footing it to the
nearest McDonald's, sampling
Stern or other midnight alterna
tives.
In the midst of the recent re
opening of the Toyon Terrace and
the Okada Teahouse, there is one
student-run, late-night campus
eatery that recently had to close
its doors. Nick's Diner, an eatery
formerly operated out of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house by several
fraternity members, officially
shut down last month under Uni
versity pressure.
According to senior Nick
Weber, the brainchild and name
sake of the student-run business,
the diner violated a tax law stating
that students could not run a
business for profit on campus.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder Union, said that
Nick's Diner had been operating
without a California sales tax per
mit, as well as using University

property for personal gain, both
of which are prohibited So —
only months after it had opened
— Nick's Diner had to close its
doors.
Both Weber and senior Doug
Bruha, another student who
worked at the Diner, expressed
disappointment over the budding
business' abrupt demise.
"I think it's really a shame, be
cause we've worked really hard to
build up a good reputation," said
Bruha. "There's a definite de
mand for a late-night hangout."
Weber remarked that he felt
"discouraged" at the enforcement
of such a policy, just as the Diner
was becoming well-established.
"We fought very hard to keep it
going."
When told they had to shut
down, the group of four entrepre
neurs running the eatery — which
included senior Alix Thompson
and junior Larry Montelibano, as
well as Weber and Bruha — tried
to negotiate alternatives to keep
the eatery running.
According to Bruha, one of the
main concerns of the University
was that, unlike the French
House or Casa Italian a — which
also run late-night food services
— Nick's Diner was not affiliated
with a theme house, and its prof
its did not go back to the house.
"Personally, I don't under
stand the difference between
what the French House does and
what Nick's Diner does," said
Bruha, adding that it was a "pret

ty fuzzy distinction." Although he
understood that the University
might be in a "tough spot," he
thought that "something really
positive like this shouldn't be dis
couraged."
The four students tried to
arrange some kind of theme for
the fraternity house in order to
keep the business, and even went
so far as to suggest some sort of
collaboration with the American
Studies house, but were denied
these alternatives. Weber's sug
gestion to divert all profits direct
ly to the house was also rejected.
Despite his disappointment at
the Diner's closing, Weber said
that "we'd like to express our

thanks to the students who kept
us running."
He added that potential cus
tomers were still calling and com
ing to the house looking for a late
night meal, after the Diner's clos
ing.
Although it was not especially
lucrative at first, both Weber and
Bruha indicated that the Diner
had been garnering more and
more regular customers through
out winter quarter.
Both Bruha and Szczesiul said
the eatery had run without prob
lems from the University until
The Daily and another local news
paper published articles about the
operation.
