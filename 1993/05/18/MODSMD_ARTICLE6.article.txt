Students craving a late-night
burger and milkshake will now
have to consider footing it to the
nearest McDonald's, sampling
Stern or other midnight alterna

In the midst of the recent re
opening of the Toyon Terrace and
the Okada Teahouse, there is one
student-run, late-night campus

of which are prohibited So —

doors.
Both Weber and senior Doug
Bruha, another student who
worked at the Diner, expressed
disappointment over the budding
business' abrupt demise.
"I think it's really a shame, be

of such a policy, just as the Diner
was becoming well-established.
"We fought very hard to keep it
going."
