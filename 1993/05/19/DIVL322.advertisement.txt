"... the 'mass of unemployed and precarious casual workers'; the new p00r,... whom the
latest technological revolution, the ultimate triumph of rationality, has deprived (some
think permanently) of an economic role. They suffer. Intellectuals feel and express
their pity, but somehow refrain from proposing to marry their thought with this
particular variety of suffering."

leadership capable of ameliorating the worsening condition of underprivileged Black Americans? These are among the major
questions addressed by Professor Cruse's brilliant historical analysis."
The most important theoretical analysis of Black life ever written by an
American, and one of the most important pieces of social analysis ever
produced about American society."
