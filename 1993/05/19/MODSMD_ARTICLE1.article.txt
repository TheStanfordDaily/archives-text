Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice,
nationally known for her stint on the Na
tional Security Council, has been named as
Stanford's new provost.
As the University's chief academic and
budget officer, she will rank second only to
University President Gerhard Casper when
she takes office Sept. 1., replacing Acting
Provost Gerald Lieberman.
"I obviously am just tremendously
pleased," Casper said. "This completes the
reorganization of the administration I
began my first day in office."
Rice, who was special assistant to Presi
dent Bush for national security affairs from
1989 to 1991, is currently assistant director

of the Center for International Security and
Arms Control.
David Holloway, the center's director,
said he thinks her extraordinary problem
solving abilities will greatly benefit Stan
ford. In addition, Holloway said "the ap
pointment of a woman — and a black
woman — is a good signal for the impor
tance of diversity at the University."
But Casper said it was not Rice's race and
sex, nor her national reputation, that
gained her the position. "I have been im
pressed by what Ms. Rice has to bring to the
job ever since I met her a year and a half ago
in Chicago," Casper said.
Rice was a member of Stanford's presi
dential search committee when she visited
Casper at his previous university in Febru
ary 1992.
While the high-profile choice may garner

positive attention for the University,
Casper said such attention is only short
lived. "My decisions are completely made on
the basis of what I thought would be best for
Stanford," he added. "What matters is the
person."
Rice could not be reached for comment
last night, but in a statement, she said she is
looking forward to joining Casper's team.
"Just as I was fortunate to be given a chance
to help shape America's response to the ex
traordinary events that ended the Cold
War, I am honored that President Casper
has placed faith in my judgement and abili
ty to meet Stanford's challenges," she said.
Lieberman expressed confidence that
Rice and Casper will be be a good pair. "I
think they'll get along exceedingly well," he
said. "They're both able to quip, enjoy a
laugh, and I think that's terribly impor

tant."
Casper agreed, saying Rice will be willing
to listen and voice her disagreements. "She
will be truly my deputy. We will work as a
team," he said. "She will have my complete
confidence."
He said Rice's experience in government,
which included two years as senior director
of Soviet affairs for the National Security
Council, has taught her to deal with com
plex issues.
"Now the University is, thank God, not
the National Security Council," Casper
said, but he added that the listening ability
Rice was able to practice in Washington will
aid her as provost.
Rice's colleagues were also quick to
praise her abilities. Richard Reis, executive
