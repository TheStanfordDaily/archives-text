# Casper names Condoleezza Rice as new provost
## Political science prof. and former Bush adviser will succeed Lieberman 
### Angie Chuang Miranda Doyle Senior staff writers 
Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice,
nationally known for her stint on the Na
tional Security Council, has been named as
Stanford's new provost.
As the University's chief academic and
budget officer, she will rank second only to
University President Gerhard Casper when
she takes office Sept. 1., replacing Acting
Provost Gerald Lieberman.
"I obviously am just tremendously
pleased," Casper said. "This completes the
reorganization of the administration I
began my first day in office."
Rice, who was special assistant to Presi
dent Bush for national security affairs from
1989 to 1991, is currently assistant director

of the Center for International Security and
Arms Control.
David Holloway, the center's director,
said he thinks her extraordinary problem
solving abilities will greatly benefit Stan
ford. In addition, Holloway said "the ap
pointment of a woman — and a black
woman — is a good signal for the impor
tance of diversity at the University."
But Casper said it was not Rice's race and
sex, nor her national reputation, that
gained her the position. "I have been im
pressed by what Ms. Rice has to bring to the
job ever since I met her a year and a half ago
in Chicago," Casper said.
Rice was a member of Stanford's presi
dential search committee when she visited
Casper at his previous university in Febru
ary 1992.
While the high-profile choice may garner

positive attention for the University,
Casper said such attention is only short
lived. "My decisions are completely made on
the basis of what I thought would be best for
Stanford," he added. "What matters is the
person."
Rice could not be reached for comment
last night, but in a statement, she said she is
looking forward to joining Casper's team.
"Just as I was fortunate to be given a chance
to help shape America's response to the ex
traordinary events that ended the Cold
War, I am honored that President Casper
has placed faith in my judgement and abili
ty to meet Stanford's challenges," she said.
Lieberman expressed confidence that
Rice and Casper will be be a good pair. "I
think they'll get along exceedingly well," he
said. "They're both able to quip, enjoy a
laugh, and I think that's terribly impor

tant."
Casper agreed, saying Rice will be willing
to listen and voice her disagreements. "She
will be truly my deputy. We will work as a
team," he said. "She will have my complete
confidence."
He said Rice's experience in government,
which included two years as senior director
of Soviet affairs for the National Security
Council, has taught her to deal with com
plex issues.
"Now the University is, thank God, not
the National Security Council," Casper
said, but he added that the listening ability
Rice was able to practice in Washington will
aid her as provost.
Rice's colleagues were also quick to
praise her abilities. Richard Reis, executive


Condoleezza Rice
director of the Stanford Integrat
ed Manufacturing Association, said
she is "very much in tune" with
research and funding interests.
"I think she'll be the next presi
dent of Stanford — it'll be a little
while, but I think she will," he added.
Senior Hoover Fellow Edward
a member of the provost
search committee, said Rice has
"an incredible amount of maturi
ty," and that she "will be superb at
being provost."
Rice and Casper will be an effec
tive president-provost team,
Lazear said. "They have different
backgrounds and different per
spectives, but they will work
together very well," he said.
Of the issues currently affecting
the University, Lazear said that
"multiculturalism is the obvious
one" that Rice will be effective in

addressing.
Rice "has a better grasp on
[multiculturalism] than anyone at
the University," Lazear said.
"Because of not only her personal
experience, but also her interna
tional academic interests, I can't
imagine a better person to deal
with these kind of issues."
Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker, another search committee
member, said Rice will be particu
larly effective in addressing the
issues in undergraduate education
that Casper has raised recently.
"She is one of the most superb
teachers given to undergradu
ates," Barker said. Rice teaches
several classes and is the author of
two books, with a third on the
way.
Both Rice and new Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven were chosen in part for
their teaching experience, Casper
said. "What was very impressive to
me," he added, "is that both people
are very much committed to teach

ing in general and especially
undergraduate teaching."
Age was also a factor. "I wanted
to have a younger generation rep
resented in the leadership of Stan
ford," Casper said. Rice is 38, while
Shoven is 45.
Although Rice and Casper's aca
demic backgrounds are rooted in
the humanities — Rice in political
science and Casper in law — mem
bers of the scientific community
say they are not concerned about
the University's commitment to
the sciences and related research.
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Director Burton Richter
said he felt having an effective
president-provost team is more
important than filling "disciplinary
quotas," and that he thinks "very
highly" of Rice and Casper.
Chemistry Prof. Stephen Boxer
said that because he knows that
Casper is "a strong supporter of
the sciences," he is not concerned
about the future of the balance
between science and humanities.

Although Rice's demanding
schedule has included frequent
trips away from campus for con
sulting and advising roles, Barker
said he is confident that Rice will
be able to dedicate enough time to
her duties as provost.
Rice first arrived at Stanford in
1981, as an assistant professor of
political science. She is also a
Hoover fellow by courtesy, and has
served on numerous search com
mittees. Rice also gained national
prominence last summer when she
was chosen to speak at the Repub
lican National Convention.
Her conservative affiliations
may earn criticism from some at
Stanford, but Casper dismissed
the possibility. "Her politics were
completely irrelevant," he said.
As for the interim provost, he
will return to teaching next year.
"I'll go back to being a mere mor
tal," Lieberman said.

was chosen to speak at the Repub
lican National Convention.
Her conservative affiliations
may earn criticism from some at
Stanford, but Casper dismissed
the possibility. "Her politics were
completely irrelevant," he said.
As for the interim provost, he
will return to teaching next year.
"I'll go back to being a mere mor
tal," Lieberman said.

Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice,
nationally known for her stint on the Na
tional Security Council, has been named as
Stanford's new provost.
As the University's chief academic and
budget officer, she will rank second only to
University President Gerhard Casper when
she takes office Sept. 1., replacing Acting
Provost Gerald Lieberman.
"I obviously am just tremendously
pleased," Casper said. "This completes the
reorganization of the administration I
began my first day in office."
Rice, who was special assistant to Presi
dent Bush for national security affairs from
1989 to 1991, is currently assistant director

of the Center for International Security and
Arms Control.
David Holloway, the center's director,
said he thinks her extraordinary problem
solving abilities will greatly benefit Stan
ford. In addition, Holloway said "the ap
pointment of a woman — and a black
woman — is a good signal for the impor
tance of diversity at the University."
But Casper said it was not Rice's race and
sex, nor her national reputation, that
gained her the position. "I have been im
pressed by what Ms. Rice has to bring to the
job ever since I met her a year and a half ago
in Chicago," Casper said.
Rice was a member of Stanford's presi
dential search committee when she visited
Casper at his previous university in Febru
ary 1992.
While the high-profile choice may garner

positive attention for the University,
Casper said such attention is only short
lived. "My decisions are completely made on
the basis of what I thought would be best for
Stanford," he added. "What matters is the
person."
Rice could not be reached for comment
last night, but in a statement, she said she is
looking forward to joining Casper's team.
"Just as I was fortunate to be given a chance
to help shape America's response to the ex
traordinary events that ended the Cold
War, I am honored that President Casper
has placed faith in my judgement and abili
ty to meet Stanford's challenges," she said.
Lieberman expressed confidence that
Rice and Casper will be be a good pair. "I
think they'll get along exceedingly well," he
said. "They're both able to quip, enjoy a
laugh, and I think that's terribly impor

tant."
Casper agreed, saying Rice will be willing
to listen and voice her disagreements. "She
will be truly my deputy. We will work as a
team," he said. "She will have my complete
confidence."
He said Rice's experience in government,
which included two years as senior director
of Soviet affairs for the National Security
Council, has taught her to deal with com
plex issues.
"Now the University is, thank God, not
the National Security Council," Casper
said, but he added that the listening ability
Rice was able to practice in Washington will
aid her as provost.
Rice's colleagues were also quick to
praise her abilities. Richard Reis, executive


Condoleezza Rice
director of the Stanford Integrat
ed Manufacturing Association, said
she is "very much in tune" with
research and funding interests.
"I think she'll be the next presi
dent of Stanford — it'll be a little
while, but I think she will," he added.
Senior Hoover Fellow Edward
a member of the provost
search committee, said Rice has
"an incredible amount of maturi
ty," and that she "will be superb at
being provost."
Rice and Casper will be an effec
tive president-provost team,
Lazear said. "They have different
backgrounds and different per
spectives, but they will work
together very well," he said.
Of the issues currently affecting
the University, Lazear said that
"multiculturalism is the obvious
one" that Rice will be effective in

addressing.
Rice "has a better grasp on
[multiculturalism] than anyone at
the University," Lazear said.
"Because of not only her personal
experience, but also her interna
tional academic interests, I can't
imagine a better person to deal
with these kind of issues."
Political Science Prof. Lucius
Barker, another search committee
member, said Rice will be particu
larly effective in addressing the
issues in undergraduate education
that Casper has raised recently.
"She is one of the most superb
teachers given to undergradu
ates," Barker said. Rice teaches
several classes and is the author of
two books, with a third on the
way.
Both Rice and new Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven were chosen in part for
their teaching experience, Casper
said. "What was very impressive to
me," he added, "is that both people
are very much committed to teach

ing in general and especially
undergraduate teaching."
Age was also a factor. "I wanted
to have a younger generation rep
resented in the leadership of Stan
ford," Casper said. Rice is 38, while
Shoven is 45.
Although Rice and Casper's aca
demic backgrounds are rooted in
the humanities — Rice in political
science and Casper in law — mem
bers of the scientific community
say they are not concerned about
the University's commitment to
the sciences and related research.
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Director Burton Richter
said he felt having an effective
president-provost team is more
important than filling "disciplinary
quotas," and that he thinks "very
highly" of Rice and Casper.
Chemistry Prof. Stephen Boxer
said that because he knows that
Casper is "a strong supporter of
the sciences," he is not concerned
about the future of the balance
between science and humanities.

Although Rice's demanding
schedule has included frequent
trips away from campus for con
sulting and advising roles, Barker
said he is confident that Rice will
be able to dedicate enough time to
her duties as provost.
Rice first arrived at Stanford in
1981, as an assistant professor of
political science. She is also a
Hoover fellow by courtesy, and has
served on numerous search com
mittees. Rice also gained national
prominence last summer when she
was chosen to speak at the Repub
lican National Convention.
Her conservative affiliations
may earn criticism from some at
Stanford, but Casper dismissed
the possibility. "Her politics were
completely irrelevant," he said.
As for the interim provost, he
will return to teaching next year.
"I'll go back to being a mere mor
tal," Lieberman said.
