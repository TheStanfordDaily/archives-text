## Gay congressman suggests compromise on military ban 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A homosexual
congressman offered a compromise yester
day to allow homosexuals to serve in the
military and do as they please off base so
long as they keep their sexual orientation
secret while on duty.
Asserting that President Clinton lacks
the votes in Congress to end the ban, Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., proposed his solu
tion that makes a distinction between a
service member's actions on and off duty.
"It's a policy that says 'don't ask, don't
tell, and don't listen, and don't investi
gate,' " Frank told a Capitol Hill news con

ference. "Basically the policy ... is 'don't
start, don't get into the whole thing.' "
Under the plan, a gay service member
would keep sexual orientation hidden
while in uniform but be allowed privately
and off duty to engage in homosexual
activities.
If someone finds out about off-duty
behavior and turns the individual in, the
military's answer should be "we, don't
want to hear about it," Frank said.
The congressman acknowledged that,
under this plan, a gay service member on a
submarine would have less of an opportu

nity to express his or her sexuality than
someone working as an Army clerk in an
office.
Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who also is
homosexual, disagreed with Frank's offer
of a compromise, saying the issue is a ques
tion of civil rights. "I don't think this is any
time to raise the white flag," he said in an
interview.
Studds, who has served in Congress for
21 years, said Frank was correct in saying
Clinton lacks the votes to lift the ban but
argued that the country is still wrestling
with the issue.

Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee and a
proponent of the ban, has suggested a com
promise of not questioning recruits about
their sexual orientation, imposing a strict
code of conduct and not ferreting out
homosexuals.
The plan would retain the ban on those
who openly assert their homosexuality.
White House spokeswoman Dee Dee
Myers said she hadn't heard about the
Frank proposal and wasn't sure Clinton
would agree with it.
"The president believes we have to go

further than 'don't ask, don't tell,' that the
standard ought to be conduct," she said.
Myers was traveling with Clinton in Los
Angeles.
But other aides said they hoped Frank's
compromise could help resolve the contro
versy without upsetting the gay communi
ty, which supported Clinton in the presi
dential race.
A White House official, speaking on con
dition of anonymity, said he thought Clin
ton would be willing to accept the Frank
compromise, especially if Nunn agreed to
it.
