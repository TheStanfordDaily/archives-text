### 
COP should do what it
can on its own before it
creates a new cabinet

WHILE THE COUNCIL of
Presidents may very well
need assistance next year,
the creation of a nine-member cab
inet is taking things a little too far.
A Clean Slate campaigned on a
platform declaring inspired dedica
tion to campus political legitimacy.
Its ideals were big — bigger than
the necessity for any monetary
compensation. The sacrifice would
be great, but its members were
willing to do it, for the sake of the
students.
But now that the thrill of their
victory has worn off, A Clean Slate
says the demands are too great for
just four people. In fact, its mem
bers need nine helpers to help
lighten the load.
This unpaid cabinet would help
direct ASSU policy in campus ser
vices, financial aid and tuition,
graduate-student issues, multicul
tural issues, residential life, and
undergraduate education. TJie
members would also supervise
ASSU public relations, program
ming and restructuring, as well as
compose a University relations
committee to be headed by a COP
member.
All of which begs the question:
what would be left for the COP to
do?
COP-elect member Ying-Ying'
Goh has said that the scope of
issues to be covered was too wide
for a four-person COFJ and that the
cabinet could examine intricacies
which might not have been discov
ered by the COR
However, with such a plan, the
cabinet may very well be usurping
power from the Senate. Why would
administration members go to a
voting Senate member with no
title, when they could go to a COP
cabinet member who is directly
responsible for a certain area? Also,

the value of such intricate knowl
edge is in doubt when the Cabinet
is non-voting and plays only an
advisory role to the COR
With the institution of another
level of bureaucracy, the potential
for passing off responsibility looms
large. While the present COP
alleges that this will help increase
student input, it is only the input of
unelected cabinet members. It is
difficult to see what advantages the
proposed cabinet holds over elected
ASSU senators for sampling stu
dent sentiment.
In addition, since the cabinet
members do not have to be con
firmed by the Senate, as is the case
with the federal government, the
group of nine would be a body com
pletely detached from the elec
torate. Such a system of appoint
ment is open for abuse when the
students have no say in their
appraisers, and the COP term runs
only the course of a year, with no
concern of reelection.
And it's quite ironic that the
COP feels that there is too much
work for four unpaid people in rep
resenting the student voice; it
should remember this was one of
its key campaign planks. Its mem
bers persuaded a significant por
tion of the voting student body that
it was to their benefit to have a
COP at no financial cost. Now, even
before the COP has demonstrated
its worth, it wishes to augment the
bureaucracy.
The COP should first divide
amongst itself aspects of student
life in which to gain fluency. Then,
if $ie four members still need a
couple of extra hands, they could
create a much smaller cabinet in
the future.
And while it is a positive sign
that the COP shows a desire to find
some no-cost method of addressing
student needs, the answer is not
necessarily additional bureaucracy.
The key to addressing student
needs is the identification of ASSU
responsibilities by elected ASSU
members.
So before creating this addition
al body of government, Clean Slate,
show us what you can do.
