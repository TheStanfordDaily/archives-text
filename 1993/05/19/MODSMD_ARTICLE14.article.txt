Playboy models affect every women, not just themselves

I SUSPECT THAT most feminists
would disagree with the interpreta
tion of feminism voiced in the May
12 article on Playboy searching for
'model-students': "To me feminism is
being able to do whatever you want to
do and not being criticized for it."
Rather, many would likely contend
that women should be able to act
freely and not be judged based on their
gender.
But to argue that a woman should
be able to do anything she wants, with
out receiving any criticism for it, is
another issue entirely. It implies that
no one has a right to criticize anyone
else â€” that we live in a society of
detached individuals; our actions are
not susceptible to anyone else's opinion
but our own.
Clearly, this is not the society we live
in. In fact, this is not even an ideal to
which to aspire. Criticism, I would

argue, is a necessary component of a
healthy society. It serves to remind us
that our behavior does have conse
quences which extend past our own per
sonal experience. Therefore, the freedom
to act carries with it a responsibility that
we need to assume. If we choose to
ignore it, others may find ways to
remind us. And they have every right to
do so.
And so, I would like to take the liber
ty to criticize the women who have invit
ed Playboy to come to Stanford, as well
as those who chose to support Playboy
by posing for them. The explanations
expressed in the May 12 article conveyed
a complete lack of concern for the possi
ble ramifications, beyond those of people
talking behind backs.
As intelligent women, we should be
aware that consequences are not limited
to direct "cause-effect" relationships;
while effects are sometimes immediate

and easily recognizable, they are perhaps
more often immeasurable, subtle and
hidden. Our actions do affect our envi
ronment by contributing to a pool of
experiences that make up the values and
ideas by which we live.
So, when a woman in the May 13
issue of The Daily expressed her frustra
tion at having to sit through jokes dur
ing lunch, this represented one of the
many unanticipated consequences of
Playboy coming to campus. Freedom to
act, when it is taken without responsibil
ity, is potentially destructive.
How could a picture in a magazine,
while seemingly insignificant to some,
nevertheless contribute to the broader
framework of sexism in society?
Let me try to illustrate how this pro
cess might occur.
The attempt to "rectify a stereotype
the magazine created several years ago
by characterizing Stanford women as

unattractive" by means of a "Girls of
the Pac 10" issue will most certainly
contribute a brand-new stereotype:
Stanford 'girls' are fun! Flirtatious!
Easy! Yippeee! (But never "threaten
ing," no! no!) We aren't being objectified
by Playboy, because we want to do it!
We have all the choices in the world,
and still we choose to pose nude. Why?
Because it's fun! It's thrilling! There's
no greater feeling in life than to have a
man think we're sexy! To be the subject
of thousands of anonymous men's plea
sures! That's why all women do it!
Because we all really love it! So no one
can say any woman is forced to do
pornography. We choose it of our own
free will and so we have no right to com
plain. Who would want to anyway?! It's
a great deal! Big Bucks for Big Boobs!
Thank God we have 'em!
