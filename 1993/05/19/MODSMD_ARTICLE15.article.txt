# Casper's commission must include a diverse collection of students
## 
### 
We are writing in response to Presi
dent Casper's State of the University
address. We are pleased that President
Casper has proposed a "radical question
ing" of undergraduate education, and we
are encouraged by the potential of the
yet-to-be-formed Commission on Under
graduate Education to begin a process of
positive change.
At the same time, we are concerned,
based upon the few details on the
Commission available so far, that the
full range of opinions of current stu
dents might not be heard in the pro
cess. President Casper stated in his
speech that he had no "concrete
model" as to the form the Commission
would take. According to his speech,

the Commission is scheduled to com
mence hearings this summer, which
would severely limit the ability of the
majority of students, who are not at
Stanford during this time, to both
serve on the Commission and con
tribute their insights to its inquiries.
If the general community is not
involved in this questioning, how valu
able can the process really be? The
experiences of the students and profes
sors should be central in this question
ing.
In his speech, President Casper also
expressed concern as to how he would
garner student interest in serving on
the committee. According to a member
of his staff, there has been a "deluge"
of student interest following his
speech. In light of this, we want to
know both how students will be select
ed and what steps will be taken to
ensure that the students and faculty
selected for the committee represent a
diversity of perspectives, paradigms

and backgrounds.
In addition, the final report of the
Commission is scheduled to be deliv
ered on July 1, 1994. Again, the choice
of a summer date raises questions
about the ability of current students
to participate in the discussion period
that must follow the issuance of the
Commission's final report. If there are
any reasons why this process needs to
take place during the summer, then
we would like an explanation of those
reasons.
While we understand the process is
still being developed, we feel that, with
the academic year rapidly drawing to a
close, it is important these central issues
be addressed. This letter is intended to
suggest that the interests of current stu
dents be given sufficient weight in the
development of the Commission. This
letter invites an open response, in the
hopes that the entire Stanford commu
nity can be involved in this fundamental
questioning.
