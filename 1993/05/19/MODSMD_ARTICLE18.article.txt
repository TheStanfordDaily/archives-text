## A 						changing of the guard 
### 
DAK IS GETTING married. Dak
Kalisuch — the guy I used to have
belching contests with in Mr.
Nagaran's class. The guy with whom I
used to go toilet papering on Friday
nights. The guy whose house we used to
decorate with his brother's underwear.
The guy with whom I grew up.
We were inseparable. Me, Dak and
four others used to spend just about
every hour together, waking or sleeping.
We were very good at making meaning
less excuses for being with each other.
And slowly, almost imperceptibly, they
became an integral part of who I am.
We learned together, and we learned
from each other, about life. During the
good times, college and the real world
seemed a million weekends away. And
during the bad times, we were quick to
remind each other that tears could be
dried up with the same old jokes. At a
time when I had no home, they were the
ones I would go to when I needed securi
ty and a refuge. At a time when I had no
family, they became the ones I would go
to for support and love. They were there
for me in so many ways, and they defined
friendship to me.
It's talking about nothing for no rea
son, like when Scott and I used to discuss
the Teela/He-Man paradigm ever the
phone in seventh grade. It's Dave tying
me up in my sleeping bag at a sleep over.
It's driving from Jordan's house to mine

countless times — in reverse. It's Aaron
and I skipping class to get a real lunch.
It's Tim and I finally destroying that
stupid speed bump.
Sure, it's laughing together and hav
ing fun, but it's a lot more, too. It's
unconditional love: a friend is a person
who will go in on a pizza even if they're
not hungry, and will go with you to the
movie, even if they've seen it before. It's
the person who will risk their friendship
with you to tell you something you need
to know: "you're being a jerk," or "you
need to stop that" or "you have waxy
build-up in your ear." It's expecting a call
on the weekend to see what "we" are
doing.
And now Dak's getting married. And
"we" are going to include one more per
son. Or perhaps more accurately, one
less. It's an end to an era. Or the begin
ning of an era. At any rate it is a change.
My family is changing, and I'm not sure
how to react.
I'm scared. If this marriage thing can
happen to Dak, then it can happen to the
rest of us.
And it's not just the marriage thing,
it's the growing up thing. And just like
the weekends in high school, wherever
one of us goes, the others are sure to fol
low. But we're not caravaning to the
beach this time. One by one, we are help
lessly following Dak into a new life.
But it upsets me that "grown-up" has

to mean wh*;t it does. Someone, some
where mac* che rule that grown-ups
can't spend so much time with each
other. It used to be that a simple phone
call would bring the whole flock together
in a few minutes; now we're together
maybe once a year, if our schedules allow.
And grown-ups aren't supposed to get in
huge hour-long wrestling matches. And
grown-ups aren't supposed to cry with
their problems to each other. Grown-ups
don't have enough time to love each other
with so much intensity and honesty.
I know that it's gone, but that doesn't
mean I have to like it. And it doesn't
mean that I have to just sit back and
wordlessly accept what other people tell
me is the right way to have a relationship
with my friends. I'll still run up huge
phone bills laughing with them for hours
about absolutely nothing. I'll still go to
their houses for no good reason, though
they may be across the country. I'll still
love them. No matter what.
And don't think that at the wedding
I'm not going to challenge Dak to a belch
ing contest with the champagne.

Mike Lang ford wants to thank 'the guys'
for being there. He loves the little bit of
John in all of you!
