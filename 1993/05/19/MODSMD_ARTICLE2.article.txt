### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Michael Roster, a Stanford
alumnus and senior partner in
one of the nation's largest law
firms, has been appointed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
to be the University's next gener
al counsel.
Roster will take over the posi
tion Aug. 1 from Acting General
Counsel Michael Hudnall. Hud
nall replaced John Schwartz, who
left Stanford in September to
serve as general counsel at Sys
temix, Inc., a Palo Alto-based
biotechnology company.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the chairman of the selection
committee, said Roster is "a
lawyer of awesome skill and expe
rience."
After spending the past 20
years in private practice, Roster,
48, said he is looking forward to
the challenge of dealing with the
diversity of legal issues con
fronting the University.
According to Roster, his job as
general counsel will be to oversee
the 20 lawyers in his office, who
deal with issues ranging from hos
pital claims and real estate negoti
ations to labor relations and acad
emic matters. He said he will also
be a senior adviser to the presi
dent and the administration, pro
viding legal input on other Uni
versity issues.
Serving as general counsel of a
university is one of the most chal
lenging legal jobs an attorney can
take, Roster added.
Roster predicts the University
will be confronted in the next few
years with issues related to indi
rect costs, President Clinton's
medical reforms and the forth
coming sexual harassment policy.
William Stone, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association and
a former classmate of Roster's,
believes Roster "will be a terrific
addition to the Stanford scene."
"He will bring a broad-minded
ness and a breadth of experience
to the administration," Stone
said.
According to Weisberg, the
search committee was especially
interested in providing "a good,
fresh look at legal services."
In dealing with University is
sues, Roster said he wants to
make more of a distinction be
tween legal and social issues.
Roster said he believes the
United States is currently over
regulated, and so one of his jobs
will be to point out the legal
boundaries of social policy-mak
ing.
Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest said Roster's appointment
is exciting, and said she thinks
Roster "will bring a new perspec-
