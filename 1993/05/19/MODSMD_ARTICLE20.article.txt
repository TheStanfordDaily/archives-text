## Making love to the camera, the joys of Playboy 
### 
YOU KNOW YOU WANTED me to
do it. You saw the ad, right to the
side of the genital warts one, and
you hoped I'd do it.
You naughty cat.
Perhaps you're a pervert. Maybe
you're a curious, yet offended onlooker.
Quite possibly you would dance a jig on
your mother's grave before admitting
any interest in anything Hugh Hefner
had his hands in, so to speak.
But whether you're morally opposed,
unconditionally supportive, or flounder
ing on the issue, you still wanted to know
about the whole Playboy thing.
You should be ashamed.
I was.
As friends and co-workers pushed me
to go find out about the Playboy inter
view process, I was distraught. Suddenly,
I was some bastion of baseness — devoid
of morals, allegedly unoffendable,
infinitely comfortable with deviance.
Mmmmmmaybe.
But Playboy? Gimme more credit than
that. Like I want herds of eighth graders

in baggy corduroy pants flocking to 7-11
to flip through pictures of me and my
nipples in between sips of Cactus Cooler.
Like I'd want thousands of drooling
college men pinning me up on their
walls, gawking at my image, daring to
guess my GPA based on my bra size.
Perish the thought.
It would be so easy to put on a scan
dalously short skirt, a studded bustier,
my best pair of spike heels, a little vase
line on my breasts, head on down to
Playboy, and thrust myself at them.
But what about self-respect? I
couldn't fathom the magnitude of my
parents' rapture on having all the dirty
old men in town complimenting them on
their daughter's artfully placed tatoos.
Couldn't imagine my Stanford career
highlights condensed into a quarter-page
glamour shot; a fold away from Arizona
State's finest airhead.
Pat the Bunny.
But I am weak, fair reader, and I gave
in. I called their probably-prancing
around-smeared-with-motor-oil secretary

and made an appointment. I had gotten
an interview, and they'd take pictures.
Breasts, don't fail me now.
I'd take the fully-clothed option, I swore.
And I wouldn't care. It was all about jour
nalism. Telling you, the timid audience,
what horrors and venerial-disease-infested
lingerie were present in the Playboy Suite. It
was a duty, a responsibility. I owed it to you.
Then I curled up into the fetal position.
Maybe Playboy, of all wicked institutions,
would like me. Maybe they'd want my
good looks and charm to grace their pages.
Mediocre, I meant mediocre.
This was my big chance, I decided,
and in a matter of minutes my self
respect went down the toilet. Suddenly I
was picking out the right tight shirt. I
was applying eye-shadow base and blush.
I put on my biggest of big earrings.
I rifled through my snapshots, looking
for a good one to give these people who
could tell me I really was attractive, eras
ing all my feelings to the contrary. I
found a picture, at my frosh Flo-Mo boat
dance — the best picture I have ever

taken in my life. A picture my parents,
grandparents or friends would be proud
to have. A picture I was proud to have.
Don't do it.
I walked through the door and vowed
that if I gave them that picture, I'd never
speak to myself again. Never have any ounce
of self-pride again. Didn't I understand that
these people who wanted to know my shoe
size, who called me "honey," who never
asked to see a Stanford I.D. or proof that I
was 18, who told me to arch my back and to
lean over a nearby coffee table (instead of the
more direct, "take it all off, baby") — didn't I
understand they didn't care?
I wasn't some perky coed, with aca
demic credentials in tow, amazingly
enough, able to prove that women aren't
just smart because they inherited ugly
genes and were forced by Darwin to com
pensate with brains to survive.
Believe it, or not.
I was the "girl" of that 15-minute slot,
the interviewee who was only asked one
question, "Did you bring a bathing suit?"
— and upon answering in the negative,

was quietly skirted out the door. It
wasn't about beauty. It wasn't about
acceptance. It was about use.
I was not to be used.
Back to normal, I thought about get
ting into the Phi Delt house, about find
ing some svelte CS major dressed all in
black, about watching the sun rise with
the male of my choice. I had survived.
No porn shots. No sleeze. I took my
polaroids, watched other Stanford women
nervously avoid eye contact, watched oth
ers change into lingerie and left.
Free as a bird.
I was intact. And I didn't get called
back. I'll never grace the pages of Playboy.
Thank god. And I'll never know whether
I'm attractive or not. Double thank god.
But I did it. I lived to tell about it. Best of
all, I still have my boat-dance picture.
That's my girl.
