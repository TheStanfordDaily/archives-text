## Drowsy dogs help scientists understand narcolepsy 
### Jennifer Cho Staff writer 
Man's best friend is keeping rather
busy these days. When he's not fetching
newspapers or chasing cars, he's helping
researchers understand sleep disorders.

Dogs at the Stanford Center for Nar
colepsy Research are leading scientists to
new insights into narcolepsy, a sleep dis
order characterized by symptoms such as
excessive daytime sleepiness, muscle
paralysis, sleep hallucinations and disso
ciated REM sleep events. Narcolepsy has

no known cure.
But now a Stanford research team has
discovered that narcolepsy, long believed
to be a purely genetic disease, can be
induced in carrier dogs by environmental
factors — drugs, in the case of this exper
iment. The findings of the Stanford

research team, led by Visiting Asst. Psy
chiatry and Behavioral Sciences Prof.
Emmanuel Mignot, could have important
implications for future research and
treatment of the disease in humans.
Typically, people fall into a deep sleep
every night known as REM, which is
characterized by jerky eye movements,
paralysis and intense brain activity. The
increased brain activity enables people to
remember REM dreams.
Similar to REM sleep, cataplexy is the
primary condition of narcolepsy. During a
cataplexic attack, Narcoleptics experience
REM brain activity even though they are
awake, resulting in hallucinations.
"Cataplexy is a state in which a person
can dream without losing conscious
ness," Mignot explained. "Those afflicted
with narcolepsy have this abnormal ten
dency to be sleepy all the time without
falling completely into sleep.
"It has the same characteristics as
REM sleep, like paralysis, but occurs dur
ing the day, so when a narcoleptic wakes
up in the morning or after a nap he may
not be able to move."
In humans, the gene that causes nar
colepsy is dominant, so a person who has
only one copy of the gene will exhibit
symptoms such as cataplexy. In Dober
mans, however, the closest known
human model, scientists believe the gene
to be recessive, requiring two copies of
the gene for narcoleptic symptoms to
arise.
But new insights pioneered by
Mignot's team have shown that trans
mission of narcolepsy in dogs is more
similar to that in humans than previous
ly believed.
Dogs who are carriers — those who
have only one gene — are not narcoleptic
under normal conditions. But when
treated with combinations of two drugs,
however, they can exhibit narcoleptic or
cataplexic symptoms.
"We have shown that under certain
environmental conditions, we can push
the dogs to exhibit narcolepsy," Mignot

explained.
Because narcolepsy is functionally
similar to REM sleep, Mignot's group
searched for a connection between neuro
transmitters that are active in REM sleep
and narcolepsy.
They found one combination of drugs
that worked in mimicking REM brain
activity. The drugs consisted of those
that stimulate acetylcholine, a neuro
transmitter whose level increases during
REM sleep. Other drugs depress the
activity of monoamines — which are sim
ilarly depressed during sleep.

'We have shown that
under certain environmen
tal conditions, we can
push the dogs to exhibit
narcolepsy.'
— Emmanuel Mignot

In combination these drugs were
found to be successful narcoleptic induc
ers.
Currently, only about 15 percent of
Americans who carry the gene have been
diagnosed with narcolepsy. The others
are often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed
at all. A potential danger, therefore, is
that undiagnosed patients may be
unknowingly worsening their condition
by taking medications that trigger the
onset of cataplexic attacks.
"There are a lot of drugs for colds and
allergies that have the same properties
[as the drug combination used to induce
cataplexy in the dogs," said Mignot.
"In humans, we know there are envi
ronmental factors, such as drug side
effects" that can enhance a person's
genetics and aggravate a condition,
Mignot said. "This is something we
should explore further."
