# Making and testing Trojans: a dippy yet electrifying experience
## 
### 
What are the details of elec-
KYlronically testing a condom
and what exactly does an electron
ic penis look like?
— Randal Burns
A: Randal, let's talk latex. A con
dom is made by dipping a glass
mold of the appropriate shape into
a vat of liquid latex. The suitable
proportions for such a mold are
more or less phallic, with small
deviations — e.g., ribs ("for your
pleasure and hers"), or the more
conventional reservoir "enz."
The repeated plunging of the
rigid form into the hot, silky liq
uid is reminiscent of — no, that
comes later — candle making,
only you don't have to dip the
condom as many times (imagine
a condom as thick as a candle is
wide: "Ooh, Randal, what . . .
girth you have!" "I can't feel a
damn thing.").
Prior to packaging, the new
born prophylactic is tested for
defects. Different companies
have their own idiosyncratic
testing protocols — some mea
sure tensile strength, others fill

the condoms with 15 to 30 liters
of air, and one local company
even cooks a few from each
batch in an oven to simulate on
the-shelf aging — but the most
common and accurate way to
test a condom's reliability is the
world-famous "individual elec
tronic test."
The test is actually quite sim
ple: After an initial rolling, the
condom is transferred to a metal
mold. If anything in the factory
resembles the "electronic penis"
mentioned in this week's ques
tion, this is it. Since you asked,
Randal, I will tell you that this
instrument would put even a
strapping young American like
you to shame. It intimidated me,
to be sure — but then again, I'm
Asian.
The condom is then sub
merged in a saline solution and
a weak voltage difference is set
up between an electrode in the
solution and the metal penis —
which, in this milieu, also acts
as an electrode. Were no condom
present, a current would flow
between steel phallus and elec
trode.

Latex, however, has a low
electrical conductance and is
therefore a good insulator.
When a fault-free latex condom
has been rolled onto the Iron
John, very little current can

flow between the electrodes, and
the condom is deemed worthy of
sale. If defects (small holes, or
even weak spots that might
wear through in a moment of
passionate friction) are present,
however, current flow goes up
and the useless love glove is dis
carded.
The individual electronic test
is a valuable one because sue

cessfully tested condoms can be
rolled up and packaged after
testing — ergo, every single con
dom that comes off the line can
be tested. Other reliability
assays (like airburst pressure

measurements) are destructive
and can be used only to test
samples from each batch.
Now that I've done my paying
job, I want to spend my last sev
eral inches exposing a condom
related fiction perpetuated a
couple of weeks ago by Daily
columnist Mike Langford. In the
midst of a fervent call to absti
nence, Mike told you an

untruth.
He said, "Apparently a new
strand of AIDS may have been
one that goes
through condoms."
First of all: It's "strain,"
Mikey, not "strand."
Second: This is a lie, intended
(perhaps not by Langford, who
probably just accepted it the way
he wants you to — thoughtless
ly) to have the same effect on
sexually active people that
threats of blindness and hairy
palms are supposed to have on
masturbators. (Side note: Didn't
work.)
This particular bogeyman
story comes in a couple different
flavors. One goes like this:
"Condoms were created to be a
barrier to sperm. HIV, the virus
which causes AIDS, is smaller
than sperm. Therefore, it can
cross a latex condom."
This is a lot like saying that
since a bee is smaller than a
deer, a bee can fly through a
concrete wall. Even if HIV
evolved into a smaller form
(which it can't, really — it's
down to the bare minimum right

now), it wouldn't make a differ
ence. To convince yourself of
this, consider how small a water
molecule is. Now go make water
balloons with condoms.
Another version of the tale is
more insidious: "Somehow, an
HIV virus has evolved to the
point that it can somehow magi
cally cross latex barriers."
Simply put, there has been no
reputable scientific study
demonstrating such transport. I
even looked for disreputable
studies and came up empty
handed.
Sure, sex with a condom isn't
100 percent safe, but we're not
going to work the revolution and
beat this disease by talking bad
science and trying to scare peo
ple with irrational claims about
killer "strands" of HIV.
