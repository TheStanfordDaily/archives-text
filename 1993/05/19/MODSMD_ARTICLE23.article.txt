## Lorraine steps into key pitching role for Stanford Left-handed junior hurler gets nod as starter; leads team with 4.15 ERA 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Andrew Lorraine knows all
about control.
"When I'm on the mound, I
like to control the situation," he
said. "I know that the game is
mine to win or lose. If I go out
there and lose, I'm going to take
the blame. And if I win, I'm
going to take some of the cred
it."
Lorraine, a 6-foot-3, 195-
pounder, deserves a lot of credit
for what has been an amazing

If you don't take
charge and have con
fidence in yourself,
you're not going to
win.'

year. A potential question mark
entering the season, Lorraine
has developed into one of the
finest left-handed starters in
the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division.
"Developed" is the key word.
In his first two seasons on the
Farm, the book on Lorraine was
simple: talented pitcher, has
good stuff, throws hard, but
lacks control.
"We didn't know what to
expect with Andrew coming into
the year," said Stanford coach
Mark Marquess. "The key to his
game has always been his con
trol."
That is, the key to Lorraine's
baseball game. If Lorraine had
his way, the key to his game
might well have been his dribble
or jump shot. Basketball was
the first true love of the Valen
cia, Calif, native, who played
the sport almost exclusively
until attending Hart High
School. "•*
."In-high school, I realized I
wasn't very good at basketball,"
Lorraine said. "So I tried base
ball."
In his first two seasons at

Hart, Lorraine wasn't very good
at baseball either. He spent his
freshman year maligned in the
outfield as a reserve, barely
making the cut on the junior
varsity team. He didn't make
the varsity squad until his
junior season.
"I was a late bloomer," Lor
raine said. "I never thought I
would make it this far."
After putting up some
impressive numbers his last two
years in high school, Lorraine
experienced that post-high
school status reduction which is
familiar to all types of Stanford
students.
In 1991, Lorraine's freshman
season, the Cardinal pitching
staff was loaded. Two hurlers,
John Reid and Brian Sackinsky,
had College World Series wins
under their belt. A slew of tal
ented upperclassmen — Steve
Worrell, Aaron Dorlarque, Greg
Mix, Tim Moore and Jamie
Sepeda, to name a few — were
waiting in the wings. Scott
Weiss was a lock as the Stanford
closer.
Lorraine went from being the
Los Angeles Times High School
Pitcher of the Year and a mem
ber of the USA Junior National
Team to just another talented
arm.
"We had so much pitching
depth his first two years that he
never really got a chance to
develop any kind of a rhythm,"
Marquess said.
Which is not to say that he
wasn't thrown right into the
fire. Lorraine was put into cru
cial situations almost immedi
ately as a freshman.
"We were playing Arizona
State in the first Six-Pac game I
pitched my freshman year,"
recalled Lorraine. "One of the
first guys I ever faced was (for
mer Golden Spikes winner)
Mike Kelly. On a 2-0 pitch, he
hit a foul ball that was the hard
est line drive I've ever seen.
"I decided to walk him."
This was one of several good
decisions made that' year by
Lorraine, who gave up no
earned runs in his first season
against Six-Pac competition.
But with so many pitchers

vying for time, Lorraine's role
was limited to short relief and
an occasional start in his first
two seasons at Stanford.
That all changed this season.
Sackinsky, Sepeda, Dorlarque,
et al were replaced by a staff on
which only Lorraine and Willie
Adams had more than 25 colle
giate innings under their belts.
Lorraine went from being a
bullpen man to the Cardinal's
first full-time lefit-handed start
ing pitcherSince'Jeff Ballkrtt in
1985.
Which suited him just fine.
"You always want to start, to
have a set pattern," Lorraine

said. "I knew I would be throw
ing a lot more, so I set some big
goals for myself. I wouldn't say
that it's been a bad year."
Nor would anyone else, for
that matter. Lorraine, who will
be named today to the Six-Pac
All-Conference Team, ranks
among the division leaders in
every major statistical category.
He leads the Cardinal with a
4.15 earned-run average, and is
tied with Adams for the team
lle&d in Wins with eight.
More importantly, he has
been a stabilizing force on a
team which has had its ups and
downs. Lorraine has lasted at

least five innings in each of his
15 starts. On a club with a lack
of relief pitching depth, such a
statistic is vital.
"Andrew's been so darned
consistent all season," Mar
quess said. "There have been
several games he could have
easily won that he didn't
because we didn't give him the
support. He's progressed so
much this season."
That progress is seer> when
looking at Lorraine's walk
totals. As a freshman, Lorraine
squandered an average of one
walk per inning pitched. This
year, he averages less than

three free passes per complete
game pitched.
"He was placing his pitches
as good as anyone we've faced
all season," Arizona State out
fielder Sal Cardenale said after
Lorraine tossed a six-hitter in
Tempe. "His command is excel
lent."
Which is the way Lorraine
likes it. "If you go out to the
mound, you've got to think
about where ypu, re v going, or
what you're going to do in par
ticular situations.
"If you don't take charge and
have confidence in yourself,
you're not going to win."
