# Don't lament mediocre May: Spring sports will bounce back

### 
AT FIRST GLANCE, May 1993
blanked Stanford athletics. After
all, the men's volleyball team failed
even to advance to the Final Four, which
took place the first week of the month.
What's more, the men's and women's
tennis teams each traveled 3,000 miles
last weekend, only to come away 0-2 in
the NCAA-championship-trophy depart
ment, for the first time in nearly a
decade. Add to that the woes of the bare
ly .500 baseball team, and a not-too-pret
ty picture of Stanford spring sports
begins to take shape.
But a closer look at the situation
reveals not a tragic finale to the Cardi
nal's usual warm-weather dominance,
but rather a brief respite from it. While
the spikers, netters and batters could
not bring an elusive fifth national title
to campus this year, they provided
every indication that they will not fade
from the scene. In fact, set your watch
es, as it should be around next May
when Stanford's late-year programs
reassume their traditional spot at cen
ter-stage.
Take the "Bald Eagles" of men's vol

leyball, who spent much of this season
ranked second or third in the national
polls, before falling apart in the postsea
son. While the loss of Ail-American

Dave Goss and five other seniors would
leave most squads exposed like the tops
of the Cardinal's shaven heads, Stan
ford can boast of the return of junior
setter Canyon Ceman, the 1993 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation and
National Player of the Year.
Underclassmen like Mike Lambert
and Brian Garrett figure to bring all the
skills of their graduating predecessors
to the hitting positions, and Ceman, as
the "quarterback" of the Cardinal's

offense, can make up for his teammates'
lack of experience with good decision
making in big matches. It still adds up
to a relatively outside shot at what
would be Stanford's first title, but
Ceman's motivation to wear a champi
onship ring before joining the pro beach
tour could make the difference come
crunch time.
As for the tennis teams, well, you
know the story all too well by now. The
1993 results: a championship-match
loss for the women and a quarterfinals
ouster for the men; both at the hands of
Texas, both by 5-2 scores.
However, of the squads' 12 regular
starters, exactly one — Heather Willens
— picks up a diploma in next month's
Commencement ceremonies. The
women return junior Laxmi Poruri to
the top singles spot, and below that
sport a core lineup of Kim Shasby, Kris
tine Kurth, Beth Berris and Amy
Chiminello that should stay in place for
two more seasons. The men, on the
other hand, can claim a heady four
seniors — Michael Flanagan, Robert
Devens, Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel

— atop a deep roster next year. The
1994 prospectus: good news for Stan
ford fans, bad news for the rest of the
collegiate-tennis world.
Then there's the Cardinal baseball
team, which lost would-be senior Jef
frey Hammonds to the professional
draft and the Baltimore Orioles before
it started losing games on the diamond
this season. Fielding an everyday lineup
of as many as eight freshmen and
sophomores, the squad has been
plagued by a pitching staff that goes
just two-deep. With three games
remaining, Stanford must take two in
order to keep coach Mark Marquess'
streak of winning seasons intact.
But this year's freshmen and sopho
mores, including future stars Dusty
Allen and A.J. Hinch, will mature by
next January and should provide offen
sive fireworks throughout the 1994
campaign. While standout junior pitch
er Willie Adams will be throwing in a
major-league farm system by then,
classmate Andrew Lorraine should
return — and if freshmen Dan Reed and
Todd Bartels can harness the flashes of

brilliance they displayed this year, the
Cardinal could have a solid rotation on
the mound and qualify for postseason
play once again.
Why the unbridled optimism? The
fact that all four programs experienced
slightly "down" years can be traced to
many factors, such as a bad recruiting
year, injuries, scheduling and fatigue.
All setbacks create the shades of grey
that lie between the two extremes of
winning a national championship and
coming up empty, and all make looking
back on any given season an ambiguous
process at best.
So go ahead and call this a "rebuild
ing" year if you must. But if you look
back in two years and see that this May
leads to four more additions to Stan
ford's trophy case next season, don't say
I didn't tell you so.

Speaking of "1 told you so," Andy Eiser,
one of the Daily's flailing sports editors,
would like to remind all "true NBA fans "
out there of David Robinson, Hakeem
Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing. Thank you
for playing.
