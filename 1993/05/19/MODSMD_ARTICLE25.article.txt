And then there was one.
After two days of individual competi
tion, there is one Cardinal team left alive
in the NCAA Championships, which will
conclude tomorrow in Gainesville, Fla.
The doubles team of junior Laxmi
Poruri and senior Heather Willens,
seeded No. 3 in the tournament,
advanced to the quarterfinals yesterday
with a 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 win over San Diego
State's No. 10 team of Susheel Gulati
and Nicole Storto.
They will face Florida State's Audra
Brannon and Laura Randmaa today,
who were ranked No. 31 in the latest
Intercollegiate Tennis Association poll.
The Poruri/Willens tandem was
ranked No. 2 in that poll behind Texas'
team of Susan Gilchrist and Vickie
Paynter. If both of these duos win their
quarterfinal matches today, they will
meet in the semifinals. The Cardinal
pair lost in straight sets to the
Longhorns in Sunday's team champi
onships, 6-3, 6-0.

In singles competition, Poruri — who
is Stanford's No. 1 player and was seed
ed No. 2 in the tournament — fell in the
round of 16 to North Carolina's Cinda
Gurney. Gurney, who was placed in the
nonspecific No. 9-No. 16 alphabetical
seeding bracket, pulled off the upset
with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Poruri yester
day.
Willens made it past the round of 16
with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over UCLA's
Cammie Foley yesterday, then played
her last collegiate singles match in the
quarterfinals against Texas' Kelly Pace.
No. 4 seeded Willens had defeated
Pace on Sunday, 6-2, 7-6, but could not
repeat the feat in their second meeting.
She fell to the alphabetical seed, 6-3, 6-4,
in a match that lasted one hour and 27
minutes.
Joining Pace in the semifinals are
Gurney and Florida's Lisa Raymond and
Andrea Farley. Raymond is the No. 1
seed and heavy favorite to win the NCAA
singles title. She is undefeated this year
and has not dropped a set in the tourna
ment, taking out No. 6 seed Pam Nelson
in the quarterfinals 6-1, 6-3.
