# Senate chair will vote for successor to end deadlock
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
After discussing the issue of how to se
lect the next senate chair and rubber
stamping various general-fee budgets, the
23rd ASSU Senate concluded its final meet
ing last night.
In an effort to resolve last week's dead
locked senate chair election, current chair
Ron Brown set forth guidelines for electing
the 24th senate's leader.
After four successive ballots last week, the
new senate was unable decide on a chair and
suspended the issue until its next meeting.
"If, after two more ballots, a new chair
has not been elected, I will break the tie,"
Brown said, adding that he will make his
decision based on a poll of the non-voting
senators.
But graduate senator James Vera op
posed Brown's authority to decide the mat
ter, pointing out that Brown pledged at the
beginning of his term never to cast a vote in
senate business.
"I don't think it's right for you to go back
on your promise at this point," Vera said.
According to the ASSU bylaws, however,
the chair does have the right to break ties in
the senate — a privilege to which many sen
ators object.
In response to Vera's argument, Brown
admitted that he would be going back on his
pledge by casting a vote.
"At such a time, I would gladly resign my
position," he added.
The mtyor part of the senate's final busi
ness included passing the 1993-94 budgets
for the groups funded by the Program,

Community Service and Publications
Boards. In addition, the senate approved
the Nominations Commission's student
appointments to University committees.
The Program Board budget, which pro
vided money for all but two of the 33 groups
funded by the board, was slashed by the
senate from $103,298 to $44,845 to fit the
ASSU's scaled-down budget.
Graduate senator Kevin Murdock at
tempted to return some funding to the
Stanford Wilderness Educational Active
Orientation Trip's budget — asking the
senate to allocate $1,680 for food.
However, his amendment failed when
undergraduate senators Gabe Lucas and
Peter Cousins pointed out that the ASSU
has set a precedent of not funding food for
such groups.
Except for minor adjustments, the bud
get was passed in its original form.
All nine groups that requested funding
from the Publications Board — including,
among others, theG-Spot, the Stanford Re
view and the Chaparral — were accommo
dated, although not by the full amount they
requested.
According to the senate's budget, 70 per
cent of the total funds solicited by the pub
lications — or $14,758 — was awarded.
Also, 17 of the 18 groups requesting
money from the Community Service Board
were granted funding for next year. A total
of $46,292 — 85 percent of the amount re
quested — was allocated.
According to Financial Manager Chris
tine Vargas, unfunded groups can still re
ceive money during the year by making
quarterly requests.
