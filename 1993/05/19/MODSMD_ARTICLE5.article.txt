Economics Prof. John
Shoven, a veteran facul
ty member who often
testifies before Congress
on public policy issues,
has been appointed Dean
of Humanities and Sci
ences.
"I'm going to be look
ing for how to maintain
the strengths we have,"
Shoven said. "The cen
ter of the University —
what I sometimes call
the crown jewel — is
H&S."

On Sept. 1, he will succeed current Dean Ewart
Thomas, who will return to teaching after five years
as an administrator.
Shoven, who has spent the last four years directing
the Center for Economic Policy Research, chaired the
Economics Department from 1986 to 1989.
He said he accepted the new position on Monday.
"I found it an agonizing decision, not so much
