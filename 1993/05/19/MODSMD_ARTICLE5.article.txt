## John Shoven selected to head largest school 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Economics Prof. John
Shoven, a veteran facul
ty member who often
testifies before Congress
on public policy issues,
has been appointed Dean
of Humanities and Sci
ences.
"I'm going to be look
ing for how to maintain
the strengths we have,"
Shoven said. "The cen
ter of the University —
what I sometimes call
the crown jewel — is
H&S."

On Sept. 1, he will succeed current Dean Ewart
Thomas, who will return to teaching after five years
as an administrator.
Shoven, who has spent the last four years directing
the Center for Economic Policy Research, chaired the
Economics Department from 1986 to 1989.
He said he accepted the new position on Monday.
"I found it an agonizing decision, not so much


John Shoven
whether to take the job but leav
ing behind the direct interaction
with students," Shoven added.
Hut a "true love of Stanford"
and an interest in higher educa
tion issues drove him to accept
the job, he said.
Shoven said he is eager to par
ticipate in Casper's recently
announced re-evaluation of
undergraduate education and to
help the president and new

provost Condoleezza Rice choose a
full-time leader for the committee.
"I don't have any particular
agenda there, but that will clearly
be a big part of my first year," he
added.
Acting Provost Gerald Lieber
man, co-chair of the search com
mittee, said he is pleased that
Shoven accepted the position.
"I don't think there was any
body that was more highly
regarded," he said. Lieberman
called Shoven an "imaginative
person" who will "infuse H&S
with lots of new ideas."
Shoven said he wants to work

closely with the other deans. "My
first instinct will be to listen," he
added.
He said he agrees with "the
fundamental principles" of the
January reorganization of
Humanities and Sciences, when
three full-time deputy deans were
appointed.
"Even though it is decentral
ized, I still want to keep a sense of
teamwork in the dean's office,"
Shoven said, adding that he
hopes to see the social sciences,
humanities and sciences working
together.
Casper chose Shoven from a

short list presented by the search
committee, according to commit
tee co-chair Amos Tversky, a psy
chology professor.
"I think he's an excellent can
didate and had all of the qualifica
tions that we were looking for,"
Tversky said. "I am happy that he
has agreed to undertake such a
difficult job."
At Stanford since 1973,
Shoven has been involved in the
recent budget-cutting process, the
faculty retirement policy and the
startup of the Stanford in Wash
ington campus.
He has done extensive research

on taxes — "a boring subject to
most," he admitted — Social
Security, stock market perfor
mance and the economics of the
elderly.
His experiences include fre
quent testimony in Washington,
D.C., including a presentation
on Social Security in March in
front of the Senate Finance
Committee.
Shoven has also served on sev
eral University advisory commit

tees, including the one that rec
ommended Casper last year. He is
also a member of the Faculty Sen
ate.
He said he is eager to take over
as dean. "It's exciting, it's daunt
ing, but I'm looking forward to
it," Shoven said. "I'll be looking
forward to working with Condi
and Gerhard."
