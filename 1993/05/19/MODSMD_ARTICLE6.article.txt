### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
The few remaining weeks in the acad
emic year will be a crucial time for the
movement to institute an Asian-Ameri
can studies program at Stanford, UC-
Berkeley Prof. Ronald Takaki said in a
speech last night.
A well known professor of ethnic
studies and the author of several books
on race and culture issues, Takaki told
a crowd of about 50 students in History
Corner that prompt action is needed in
the fight for an ethnic-studies pro
gram.
"There are only about two weeks left
before the end of the quarter," Takaki
said, "and you will miss an opportunity if
something doesn't happen in those two
weeks."
Takaki offered this advice to students
in a question-and-answer session follow
ing the speech, titled "A Different Mir
ror: Asian Americans in the Curriculum
of the 21st Century."
. The speech dealt with the need for
multicultural education in America,
while a question-and-answer session af
terward specifically focused on the drive
to establish an Asian-American studies
program at Stanford.
"I think many people were inspired

this evening" by Takaki's exhortations,
said sophomore June Fang, who invited
him to speak at Stanford.
Takaki criticized Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas for recently
denying the History Department's rec
ommendation to grant History Prof. Gor
don Chang tenure — a move that has
sparked controversy in the Asian-Ameri
can community.
Takaki, the former chair of UC-Berke
ley's Department of Ethnic Studies, told
students that there is hope, however, in
pressuring a new dean who will have sev
eral years to satisfy students' needs.
Much of Takaki's speech addressed
the need for multiculturalism in educa
tion to improve race relations in the Unit
ed States.
"We won't be able to 'get along' unless
we learn more about each other," he said,
in a reference to Rodney King's famous
plea. "And if we don't do it in the curricu
lum, how will we ever learn about each
other?"
Takaki cited UC-Berkeley's ethnic
studies program, which consists of five
departments with 250 undergraduate
and 85 graduate students, as a model
that is "light-years ahead" of other uni
versities, including Stanford.
"The time has come for Stanford to
make a commitment," he said.
