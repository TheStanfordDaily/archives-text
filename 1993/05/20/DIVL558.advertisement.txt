Malcolm X Week '93
TO MARRY OUR THOUGHT TO THE
PLIGHT OF THE POOR AND JOBLESS:
By Any Means Necessary
"... the 'mass of unemployed and precarious casual workers'; the new p00r,...
whom the latest technological revolution, the ultimate triumph of
rationality; has deprived (some think permanently) of an economic role.
They suffer. Intellectuals feel and express their pity, but somehow refrain from
proposing to marry their thought ivith this particular variety of suffering."
[Zygmunt Bauman, Legislators and Interpreters:
On Modernity, Post-Modernity and Intellectuals]
THURSDAY, MAY 20TH
■ Discussion: "We're Dying Under the Weight of the Evidence:
Poverty, Joblessness,
the Black Diaspora, and the
Institution of Knowledge".
A look at poverty and joblessness in the Black diaspora and a
discussion with Sylvia Wynter, Professor of African and Afro-
American Studies and Spanish and Portuguese at Stanford

"If the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws
of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin."
[Charles Darwin, Voyage of the Beaglell
"The starving 'fellah', (or the jobless inner city
N.H.L., the global new poor, or les damn£s) Fanon
pointed out, does not have to inquire into the truth.
They are the truth. It is we who institute this
"truth." We must now undo their narratively
condemned status."

Letter To My Colleagues"]
