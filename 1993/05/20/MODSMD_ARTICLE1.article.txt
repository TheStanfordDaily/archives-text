## Sheriff, SLAC officials still investigating 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
About 40 Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center workers and admin
istrators met yesterday to both dis
cuss a racist attack on a SLAC em
ployee and question whether the
incident is indicative of deep-seed
ed problems at the center.
Meanwhile, the San Mateo
County Sheriffs Department, the
Department of Energy and SLAC
officials are still investigating the
incident and will wait the until
probe's conclusion before issuing
an official response to the attack.
On Monday, Chuck Taniguchi,
a storeroom manager in SLAC's
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, found a knife stuck in
his door and the words "Go home
Jap" written on a chalkboard.
At yesterday's meeting, employ
ees expressed "a certain amount of
horror" at the incident, and some
said they felt the attack was indica
tive of a larger problem, according

to meeting organizer Jack
Truher, a friend of Taniguchi's
and physicist at SLAC. The meet
ing is a weekly event where
employees come to talk about
their work-related problems, but
usually no more that six workers
attend, Truher said.
Truher said that he felt the
incident was "a manifestation . . .
of a pathology. Basically the
whole organization from top to
bottom, along its length and
breadth is in deep trouble."
The incident, Truher said, is a
display of an "us/them" mentality
he sees at SLAC, where people
divide into hostile cliques instead of
working together. He said he feels a
kind of "family counseling" is need
ed to help heal the "injury to us all."
Taniguchi said the meeting
allowed some employees to bring
out concerns "about ongoing
racism and anti-union sentiment"
at SLAC. Taniguchi is a member
of the United Stanford Workers
union that represents some SLAC

employees, and said he thinks
that might be one motive behind
the attack.
In a memo sent to all employ
ees, SLAC Director Burton
Richter said Monday's incident
involved "anti-union sentiment,"
and said it showed "unacceptable
behavior in our workplace and
will not be tolerated.
"I regret the necessity of writ
ing this memo but I truly want
the SLAC work environment to be
a positive one for everyone and I
am counting on everyone to do
their part in making it happen,"
said Richter in the memo.
Despite Richter's memo and
the sentiments expressed at the
meeting, others said they don't
feel there is any long-running
problem with racism at SLAC and
the attack on Taniguchi is unfor
tunate but unique.
"The workers aren't racist,"
said Susan Strubbe, a USW repre
sentative, although she said some
people were concerned that Mon
day's incident reflected a "perva
sive climate of hostility."
Lee Lyon, SLAC's personnel
director, said that while "any big
organization is going to have

some problems with people that
have racist beliefs," the incident
was an abberation.
"This is the only overt incident
of ugly racism we've had at
SLAC," he said.
SLAC security officials and the
San Mateo County sheriff s office
are "actively pursuing" the inves
tigation into the attack, Lyon said.
John Belluardo, a spokesman
for the Department of Energy,
which funds SLAC, said the
department is also watching the
investigation and may take some
type of action once the probe is
complete.
Until the investigation ends,
Lyon said there are no formal
plans for dealing with the incident
outside of talking with employees
and managers at the center.
Taniguchi — who is currently on
administrative leave — said he
doesn't know yet whether he will
return to his job. "One thing that I
was concerned about and I am con
cerned about today is what my posi
tion is as far as protection," he said.
Lyon said he has not yet had a
chance to discuss personal safety
concerns with Taniguchi but
plans to soon.
