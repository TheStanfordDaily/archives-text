# Peace plan dead, Bosnia Serbs say

MOUNT JAHORINA, Bosnia-
Herzegovina (AP) — The Bosnian Serb
assembly proclaimed the U.N. peace
plan dead yesterday and threw the
question of Bosnia's fate back to the
world community.
The self-proclaimed parliament
announced that voters overwhelmingly
rejected the peace plan to divide Bosni
an among the three warring factions.
And Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic proposed ending the violence
by forming a Bosnian confederation, in
which ethnic groups would occupy
autonomous, but allied, states.
The meeting, held in the hills outside
the battered capital of Sarajevo, began
with the singing of a Serb nationalist
anthem. Soldiers fired- weapons in the
air to celebrate.
"The Vance-Owen plan is dead,"
Karadzic proclaimed as the meeting
opened. "Long live the peace process."
The parliament's statement came as
no surprise. The assembly, which has
already rejected the plan, said 96 per
cent of voters opposed the accord and 96
percent voted to form their own state
within Bosnia.
Turnout among Bosnian Serbs was

at 1.2 million people, or 92 percent of
eligible voters, it said.
The plan — drafted by envoys Lord
Owen and Cyrus Vance — would give
territorial zones to the warring parties:
ethnic Croats, Muslims and ethnic
Serbs. Sarajevo would be jointly held.
"The Serb people have not voted for
war. We are calling on all politi
cians. . .to come up with new ideas, new
peace initiatives,"he said.
A resolution called on "all prominent
personalities of the international com
munity to get involved in the Bosnia-
Herzegovina conflict by offering new
peace initiatives" and declared an end to
Serb military operations.
But many such declarations past
have led only to more fighting.
Serb intransigence and Western
indecision have stoked the 13-month
old war, which has left 138,000 people
dead or missing and 70 percent of
Bosnian territory overrun by Serbs.
Karadzic signed the peace plan on
May 2 in Greece on condition that the
assembly ratify his signature. It
refused, and kicked the question to the
referendum.
Bosnian Serbs objected to parts of

the plan that require them to give back
territory and refused them the right to
form their own state — which would
block the goal of eventually joining
Serbs in Yugoslavia and Croatia.
Karadzic yesterday raised the
prospect of settling the conflict by form
ing a Bosnian confederation. There "is
still a chance of some sort of a Bosnian
confederation if the Muslims are ready
for that. . .but if they are not ready, I
believe there will be separate Serb and
Croat states in Bosnia," he said.
Serbs say they can no longer live
with Bosnian Muslims and Croats, and
that a confederation would entail sepa
rate boundaries — something interna
tional mediators have specifically
refused to grant the Serbs.
The Bosnian Serbs' maneuvers'over
the past few weeks have incurred the
wrath of their mentor, Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, the most powerful
man in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia is suffering under U.N.
sanctions for helping the Bosnian
Serbs, and it responded to Bosnian Serb
rejection of the plan by saying it was
sealing its border to all but humanitari
an aid to the Serbs in Bosnia.
