# White House sacks travel staff
## Mismanagement of funds cited; FBI to investigate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House abruptly fired the
entire staff of its travel office yes
terday, accusing them of shoddy
accounting practices, mismanage
ment and possible overbilling. A
distant cousin of President Clin
ton was named to oversee travel
arrangements.
White House press secretary
Dee Dee Myers said the FBI prob
ably would be called in to investi
gate, "given the kind of informa
tion and the amounts of money
involved."
The travel office books flights
and accommodations for White
House employees traveling com
mercially and also charters jets
for the press corps that accompa
nies the president on every trip.

Over a 17-month period exam
ined by auditors, it handled about
$11 million in a press cash
account.
In all, seven employees were
fired and told to clear out by the
end of the day. The workers —
having been employed at the
White House between 10 and 30
years — were dismissed with two
weeks' severance pay. Two of the
seven were not given a chance to
tell their side of the story, officials
said.
President Clinton deflected
questions about the firings, say
ing merely he was told that an
investigation had turned up "seri
ous problems" and that "there
was no alternative."
Myers said that large sums of

money could not be accounted for
in a travel office account. "We
think that there has been some
serious overbilling of the press,"
she said, although a senior offi
cial later told reporters there was
no documentation of over
charges.
Myers also said the travel
office did not follow procedures
for competitive bidding in char
tering aircraft.
The firings provoked an uproar
at the daily White House news
briefing as reporters repeatedly
demanded an explanation of the
firings. The travel office staff gen
erally is warmly regarded by the
press and credited with doing a
good job looking after reporters'
needs.
