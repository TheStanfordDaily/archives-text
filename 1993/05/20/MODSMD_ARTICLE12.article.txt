# Clinton recognizes Angola

WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Clinton reversed
almost two decades of U.S. poli
cy yesterday and recognized
Angola's democratically elected
government, promising efforts
to end that nation's long-run
ning civil war.
Clinton said the United
States would work with the
African nation's government
and UNITA rebels as well to
stem the bloodshed that has left
400,000 Angolans dead and 2
million others on the verge of
starvation.
Clinton's decision drew fire
from the rebels, once allies of
the United States, who warned
it could derail peace talks.
"This decision reflects the

high priority our administration
places on democracy," Clinton
said as he began a meeting with
South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu.
Tutu, emerging later from
the Oval Office, hailed Clinton's
"wonderful announcement,"
saying it was "important for
those who are trying to democ
ratize to be rewarded for it."
Angola's formerly Marxist
government held elections in
September after a peace agree
ment with the rebel National
Union for the Total Indepen
dence of Angola (UNITA) was
ushered in with help from
Washington, Lisbon and
Moscow.
But fighting erupted again in

October after rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi accused the govern
ment of rigging the election.
International observers said the
voting was fair.
Clinton said he had tried to
use the prospect of recognizing
Angola as "leverage" to end the
renewed fighting but decided to
recognize the government after
the rebels refused to accept a
peace plan.
The United States was
UNITA's biggest supporter in
the 1980s, secretly supplying
weapons and money to help the
group fight the Soviet-backed
government. But since Savimbi
returned to the battlefield last
October, the United States has
soured on him.
