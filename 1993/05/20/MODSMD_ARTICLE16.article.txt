## Dodging the Draw 
### 
A surplus of extraneous
positions at some dorms
lets many avoid drawing

IN THE CORPORATE world,
it's called title inflation. The
dog-eat-dog prizefight known
as the Draw drives students to
scramble for priorities, plot intri
cate ranking strategies and pray
fervently as their fateful number is
removed from the cardboard box.
It shouldn't come as a surprise
that taking assorted "service"
positions at residences that guar
antee spots to their holders has
become an attractive alternative
to relying on the statistical
whims of the Draw, especially the
relatively limited options of the
dreaded unguaranteed year.
Of course, not all students who
take such jobs are just searching
for an easy-way-in to coveted
houses and dorms, but the sheer
number of guaranteed-housing
positions in some residences,
especially Row Houses, can sig
nificantly reduce drawing stu
dents' chances of landing a spot.
To insure fairness to those who
undergo the trials of the Draw,
residences — especially smaller,
more popular ones — need to
reevaluate whether all their stu
dent staff positions are really
necessary.
Resident assistant, kitchen
manager, house manager, social
manager, financial manager, pro
gram assistant, computer manag
er — six to eight positions are
reserved for student staff in
many of the Row Houses, which
average a mere 40 or 50 residents
each.
In addition, three Residence
Computer Coordinators for "Row
Zones" are given spots in certain
Row Houses.
In Xanadu, one of the most
popular draw choices last year,
guaranteed student-staff spots
occupy eight of the 55 available

spots. That's over one-seventh of
the house. Many other Row
Houses follow the same pattern.
While a self-op house does
require a slightly larger staff
than traditional dorms, a small,
all-upperclassman community
should not require six students to
coordinate student affairs.
Houses should consider consol
idating some of the positions into
ones that would require a larger
time commitment, but also
attract truly committed students
— not just those looking to beat
the Draw.
Given that most student staff
members are returning residents
of their houses, a multiplicity of
guaranteed spots for them cuts
down on the number of new resi
dents that are offered a chance to
join the house's community.
Row Houses are not the only
residences who seem to be engag
ing in the top-heavy student
staffing system.
In Yost House next year, a
focus assistant position will be
added in addition to its resident
assistants.
A fine idea — except that Yost
doesn't have a focus.
Something is amiss with this
picture.
In upperclass residences, when
resident assistants' roles and
responsibilities are already limit
ed, compared to four-class and
all-freshman dorms, a focus
assistant in a focus-less house
seems somewhat extraneous.
If an extra hand in planning
programs and activities is really
needed, residents should be
encouraged to pitch in through
dorm government.
By involving individual resi
dents, a greater sense of commu
nity in often-disjointed upperclass
houses could also be nurtured.
Instead of creating position
after position for guaranteed
housing spots, residences should
consider the potential benefits of
placing more responsibility on
the fewer staff members and on
their residents as well.
