## The 						wisdom of Malcolm X 
### 
DURING MY freshman year I was
accosted by a white woman in my
dorm and interrogated as to why I
was wearing a Malcolm X T-shirt. Feeling
that I didn't have to defend my choice of
personal expression, I returned her ques
tion with a question.
I asked,"ls that a problem?"
She said, "Well, he hates white people
and he really scares me and I can't see
why you would be wearing a shirt with
him on it."(I actually think she was
afraid that by wearing the shirt it meant
that I hated her.)
I tried in vain to explain that he was
more than the distorted media represen
tation of him. She wasn't buying it. She
said, "I don't care what anybody says, he
was a racist."
Since Stanford's illustrious multicul
tural curriculum hasn't done a very good
job on educating students about the ori
gins of race and racism, or teaching about
important figures who fought against
social ills, I have decided to use this col
umn to share some of Malcolm X's wis
dom and insights:
"With skillful manipulating of the
press, they are able to make the victim
look like the criminal and the criminal
look like the victim."
"To accuse [the black muslims] of
being violent is like accusing a man who
is being lynched — who is being hung on
a tree — simply because he struggles vig
orously against his lyncher, the victim is

accused of violence but the lyncher is
never accused of violence."
"There are already enough laws on the
law books to protect an American citizen.
You only need additional laws when you
are dealing with someone who is not
regarded as an American citizen."
"We only mean vigorous action in self
defense."
"The press says that if we try to
defend ourselves, we are practicing vio
lence in reverse. If a criminal comes to
rob your house with his gun Just because
he's got a gun and he's robbing your
house, it doesn't make you a robber
'cause you grab your gun and run him
out."
"It is criminal to teach a man not to
defend himself when he is the constant
victim of brutal attacks."
"The Black man in America is the only
one who is encouraged to be non-violent.
Never do you find white people encourag
ing other whites to be non-violent. They
encourage the so-called Negro to get his
desires fulfilled with a sit-in strike, or a
passive approach or a love-your-enemy
approach, or pray for those who despite
fully use you. This is insane."
"When the Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor, the American white man didn't
say pray for the Japanese; let them now
go bomb Manhattan or Staten Island. No.
They say praise the lord, but pass the
ammunition."
"As long as you fight it on the level of

civil rights, you are under Uncle Sam's
jurisdiction. You are going to his court to
correct the problem. He created the prob
lem. He's the criminal. You don't take
your case to the criminal, you take your
criminal to court."
"If I were in the South, and a South
erner didn't want me in his restaurant
and I forced my way in and then let him
go back in his kitchen and prepare some
coffee for me to drink, I'd consider myself
insane to drink it."
"Civil rights is supposed to mean citi
zenship. When you have civil rights you
have citizenship. When you have citizen
ship you have civil rights. And if the 22
million Afro-Americans were actually cit
izens of this country, it wouldn't be nec
essary to pass any more legislation to
include us in the Constitution."
"I don't believe in violence, that's why
I want to stop it. .. but you can't stop it
with love."
"You can't ever reach a man if you
don't speak his language. If a man speaks
the language of brute force, you can't
come to him with peace . . . he'll break
you in two, as he has been doing all
along."

through 21. His birthday was May 19.
