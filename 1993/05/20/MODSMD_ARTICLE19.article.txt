University's 'highest law' must not be taken lightly

IT WAS NOT MY intention to start of
war of words over the Honor Code in
The Daily's letters section, but I feel
Ben Schwartz has (unintentionally, I am
certain) taken what I had written con
cerning the Honor Code and misinter
preted my intentions and my approach
to teaching.
As I had stated previously, I am
opposed to cheating on exams, and do
feel that any student who is found to
have been doing so should be expelled
from the University, no matter what
extenuating circumstances exist. Cheat
ing is effectively plagiarism, which is the
highest academic crime one can commit;
a university cannot
tolerate it to any extent. This does not
mean that I do not feel a concern for my
students' situations, but no matter what

their situations may be, I cannot justify
allowing that person to remain in an
academic environment when they violat
ed its highest law.
As to my attitude toward my stu
dents, I do not feel that I am in a posi
tion suitable to judge it, since I would
obviously be biased. I leave that to the
students whom I have taught, and to the
head TAs and instructors under whom I
have taught. I do not feel it is fair (or
logically consistent) for my position on
the Honor Code to be translated into my
attitude toward my students — that is
something that is to be measured in the
classroom and in office hours, which
Schwartz has never been present to
observe. I will not pass judgement on
Schwartz's attitude, either, but from
what I have heard, he is a very good TA.

As Schwartz has pointed out, previ
ous records of accusations of cheating
are not, by themselves, sufficient proof
beyond a reasonable doubt that a stu
dent has cheated.
I made this same observation in my
original article. However, universities
must take steps to protect the integrity
of academic work, and an individual who
has a record of multiple accusations of
cheating may be a risk to that integrity.
I would suggest that some sort of inter
mediate sanction is not only appropriate,
but consistent with the responsibility
which falls upon the University. More
over, the University's first responsibility
is to ensure that its highest law, integri
ty in academic work of all kinds, is fol
lowed, and the Honor Code is simply not
consistent with that law.

Finally, I agree wholeheartedly with
Ben that there is a stigma in getting a
grade less than an A, especially among
students who are pursuing professional
careers and the professional schools
themselves. It is unfortunate that we
have developed systems of admission
and employment in this country which
rely so heavily on something so arbitrary
as grades; however, there is very little
which most of us can do about it. The
challenge of reforming these systems
falls primarily on those who are in a
position to admit and employ. Neverthe
less, this does not lessen the responsibili
ty of every student not to cheat, nor is it
an acceptable excuse for a university to
treat violations of its highest law lightly.
