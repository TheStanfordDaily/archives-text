# Speaker encourages African-American unity

Harold Cruse admits he's not a dedicated Malcolm X
follower. In fact, he and Malcolm X once "had some
words."
Nevertheless, Cruse delivered the keynote address
for Malcolm X Week '93, emphasizing that he was not
speaking to commemorate or glorify Malcolm X the
man, but pass on his ideas.
Addressing the topic, "Aspects of Malcolm X's Lega
cy Today," Cruse said that people should learn to un
derstand the messages that Malcolm X was trying to
communicate, especially the later visions which "he

projected but could not attempt to pursue because he
was assassinated."
He also described his personal relationship with the
late leader. "Malcolm X didn't like intellectuals," Cruse
said. "I was not one of those Ph. D.'she didn't like, but
I looked like one and talked like one. That was too much
for Malcolm."
Cruse, former chair of the Center for Afroamerican
and African Studies at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor, stressed Malcolm X's unrealized vision of
an Organization of Afro-American Unity.
Although he contends that the organization was one
of the main points in Malcolm X's agenda, Cruse said

many of Malcolm's followers do not know of its impor
tance.
It "was an important organizational idea. In fact, it
was a crucial idea that remains crucial today," Cruse
said.
The organization was a proposed national group
that would unite blacks under a single banner. Cruse
stressed its importance although it never had a coher
ent ideological agenda, since the plans were still being
formed when Malcolm X was assassinated.
The OAU was never organized because "few blacks
outside of Malcolm X's followers
really wanted such an organiza
tion," Cruse said. He attributed this
to what he sees as the socialization
of the Afro-American population
into believing that they do not want
any new kind of organization.
"Ideologically, we (Afro-Ameri
cans) are a divided people," said
Cruse, adding "we have got to stop
deceiving ourselves." He proposed to
solve the "deception" by projecting
Malcolm X's vision into the future.
The solution Cruise proposed is
the formation of a national student
group that would embody the ide
als of the Organization of Afro-

American Unity and resemble the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, which was active in
the 19605.
Cruise said he focused on stu
dents because today, the only
group with the potential for pro
viding black unity — and hence
promoting black social and political
issues — is the black student popu
lation of the United States.
His proposed organization — to
be called the National Black Stu
dents Political Organization —
would alleviate the "leadership
organizational impasse" present in
the Afro-American community
today, Cruse said.
Cruse was speaking as part of
Stanford's "Malcolm X Week '93,"
which began Sunday and finishes
tomorrow.
