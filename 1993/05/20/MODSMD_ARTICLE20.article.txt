# Hula dancers add life to Stanford; were only dancing to fulfill debt
## 
### 
According to Monday's editorial,
"Food Faire's Follies," it was stated that
students would be happier with a
"refreshing drop in the number of on
campus hula dancers." I have to respond
by saying that a drop in hula dancers
would be quite disappointing for me.
Although the editorial's statement
was probably not meant to be derogato
ry, I felt that it was quite inconsiderate
and rude. Needless to say, I doubt that
the editorial would have made the same
remark about Ballet Folklorico or any
other cultural student dance group on
this campus, but for some reason many
people have a misconception about hula
dancing. People view this type of dance
as "touristy" when, in fact, it is an inte
gral part of the history and culture of
Hawaii.
The hula group on campus does not

go around advertising its dancing abili
ties. Its focus is to preserve this campus
story-telling. It has done shows for the
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital and
the Bechtel Center's International Day.
It does not do shows for money, publicity
or parties. In fact, the performance at
the fair was done because Wilbur Food
Service had asked for a rental fee for the
utensils that Hawaii Club had used for
cooking in their annual luau, but instead
wanted a performance to promote their
Maui Beach Club booth. These dancers, I
am sure, did not want to be in the middle
of Wilbur Field without a stage, with a
mariachi band playing over their music,
people walking through their perfor
mance area and nobody even watching.
They did it because they felt that they
were obligated to fulfill Wilbur Food Ser
vice's wishes.
It would be sad, indeed, to reduce the
number of hula dancers on this campus
not only for myself, but also for the
countless number of people who have
ei\joyed the annual luaus, the patients at
the Children's Hospital, the spectators at
the Bechtel Center and the people of

Hawaii.
