# Proposal for all ASSU senators to vote for the chair killed by senate
## 
### 
I have only one remark concerning
the inability of the new ASSU senate to
pick its senate chair. I proposed initially
to have all senators vote on this deci
sion, not just the 20 "voting senators."
This idea was turned down because it
violated the constitution.
If there were ever a need to think
practically for once, now is the time. I
guarantee you that this would break the
tie, and would do so in a fair manner.
But more importantly, it's a sad com
mentary on the ASSU to let only half
the senate pick its chair, who is sup
posed to serve the entire Senate. Until
we better distinguish the roles of non
voting and voting senators, it should be

painfully obvious that this crucial vote
must be cast by everyone who plans to
participate in the ASSU senate, and not
just the 20 elite, deadlocked senators.
