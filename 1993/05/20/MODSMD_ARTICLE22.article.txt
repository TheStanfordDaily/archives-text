# Letters Policy
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes letters from
its readers. Letters will be published
at the editor's discretion and are
subject to editing. All letters must
include the author's name, phone
number and Stanford affiliation, if
any. Submissions with more than
five signatures must designate a
representative.
Letters should be turned in on a
Macintosh disk with a paper copy of
the submission.
Submissions are published on a
space-available basis at the discre
tion of the Opinions editors.
