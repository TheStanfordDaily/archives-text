## Adams' hot arm fires up team 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It's a classic split personality.
In many ways, Willie Adams plays the
part of the team joker to a tee. "He's got
kind of a quirky personality," said Stan
ford outfielder Nate Olmstead. "Willie's
one of the guys that keeps the team
loose."
"I'm two different people," Adams
said. "When I'm off the mound, I like to
joke around. But when I'm out on the
mound, it's different.
"I'm real intense out on the mound."

In my mind, Willie's one
of the best pitchers in the
nation. I wouldn't trade
him for anybody.'
— Mark Marquess

Adams will be remembered more for
his performance on the mound than off
it. With a Friday start against UCLA, the
6-foot-7, 215-pound junior puts the fin
ishing touches on a spectacular collegiate
career, before heading off to the pros.
Adams leaves with his name peppered
across the Cardinal record books in
career innings pitched, wins, strikeouts
and countless other categories.
"It's been a great experience, and I've
never regretted a minute of it," said
Adams, a 1990 draft choice of the Detroit
Tigers, who chose Stanford over the pro
fessional system. "I've played with a
great bunch of guys, and a coach whom I
consider to be the best in college base
ball."
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess never
regretted Adams' decision either. "Willie
pitches more like a junior than a fresh
man," Marquess said after seeing Adams

throw in the fall practice season of his
freshman year. "To be such a complete
pitcher at his age is remarkable."
Adams was a starting pitcher the
moment he set foot on the Farm. "I
always knew I'd get the innings when I
came here," he said. "It was kind of
intimidating at first. You look at a team
like Arizona State that has something
like a .330 batting average and say,
'Wow, they must have some pretty good
hitters.' But I was always confident of
my abilities."
With good reason. Adams came to
Stanford with the ability to throw three
pitches — a fastball, breaking pitch and
split-fingered fastball — for strikes. The
right-hander won the first four starts of
his freshman campaign and established
himself by the end of the year as the top
starter on a team overburdened with
pitching talent.
Last season, Adams was the youngest
pitcher named to the All-Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division Baseball
Team, leading the Cardinal in earned-run
average (3.91) and complete games (5).
But Adams, who was one of several
effective Stanford starters his first two
seasons, was forced into a different role
this year. The team lost seven pitchers to
either the major league draft or gradua
tion. At the start of the season, only
Adams and Andrew Lorraine had any
significant previous collegiate experi
ence.
"We knew we lost a lot of innings from
last year," Adams said. "I didn't know
what was going to happen."
If Adams was a solid pitcher his first
two seasons, he emerged as one of the
most dominant pitchers in collegiate
baseball this year. Knowing that relief
help has tended to be an oxymoron on
the 1993 Cardinal squad, Adams has
gone the distance seven times. He and
Lorraine have combined to pitch a phe
nomenal 51 percent of Stanford's total
innings this year.

"The team may be having a tough
year, but Adams and Lorraine are proba
bly the best combination of starting
pitchers in the Six-Pac," Arizona out
fielder Jason Thompson said after a
series at Sunken Diamond earlier in the
season.
Which is small consolation to Adams,
who pitched in the NCAA Regionals fol
lowing both his freshman and sopho
more years.
"This season has been a big disap
pointment," the pitcher said. "We gelled
really well together at the beginning of
the season, but we never really seemed to
put things together, to get on a streak.
It's tough to feel good about a year (with
less wins), even if you can personally
accomplish what you set out to do."
With an 8-5 record and a 4.17 earned
run average, Adams' numbers are
respectable, but not eye-popping.
They're more impressive when put into
perspective. Because of the team's
bullpen problems, Adams would throw
well over 100 pitches in each start
before Cardinal coaches would even
consider replacing him. In addition,
opposing batters collected 15 unearned
runs against Adams, as Stanford has
struggled all season in the field. Finally,
Adams has pitched well in some games
where the Cardinal bats have been
lethargic.
"In my mind, Willie's one of the best
pitchers in the nation," Marquess said,
after Adams tossed back-to-back
shutouts earlier in the season. "I
wouldn't trade him for anybody."
Barring some unforeseen disaster,
Adams will give up his final year of col
legiate eligibility and enter the profes
sional ranks via the draft this June.
"It's for a variety of reasons," Adams
said. "I've got to take financial consid
erations into account, and I feel I've
proven I can pitch at this level. Unless
something really odd happens, I don't
think I'll be back."

Right after turning down a draft offer from the Tigers, junior Willie Adams turned
in three phenomenal seasons for the Cardinal.
