# Women's tennis involves more than meets the eye
## 
### 
The cover picture on Monday's Daily said it
all. There sat Laxmi Poruri and Heather Wil
lens, best friends, leaders of the nation's most
respected collegiate women's tennis program.
The towels over their faces hid the emotion,
the frustration, the "what-ifs" of a near
championship season come to a bitter end.
The Stanford women's tennis team fought,
as they say, the good fight, but this year it just
wasn't meant to be. The Cardinal came one
match short of recapturing the NCAA title it
lost last year, but the Texas Longhorns were
the team of destiny this time, stopping Stan
ford in the NCAA Final in Gainesville, Fla.
Ironically, this was supposed to be the big
showdown between Stanford and Florida —
No.l vs. No. 2, for all the marbles. Willens was
"looking forward" to the rowdy Florida fans,
Poruri was ready for another shot at No. 1-
ranked Lisa Raymond. Some observers of
women's collegiate tennis paid lip service to
the idea of a lower-ranked upset, but few actu
ally expected No. 5 Texas to pull off the coup
de grace in Florida's backyard.
The No. 2 Stanford Cardinal certainly
didn't.
As the beat reporter for the women's ten
nis team this year, I have eiyoyed a special
perspective on the team. I have seen the per
sonalities behind the team, the rankings, the
history of excellence and the pressures of con
tinuing a tennis "dynasty." What casual fans
of the sport often forget is that these women,
like so many other winning Stanford athletes
we take for granted, have worked for every
victory, every set, every point that comes their
way. No win comes easy, nor does any loss.
At their level, there is little room for error
— games are decided by inches at the line and

the net. Many of them have told me that com
peting successfully requires more mental
than physical endurance. Often, they include
emotion as a key ingredient to consistently
high performance — and judging from the
way they play on the court, I don't doubt them
one bit.
For that reason, losses like the one the Car
dinal suffered Sunday sting indeed. These
women poured their precious time, their
physical and mental effort, and their feelings

into the game, making incredible sacrifices in
their lives to pursue the elusive championship
title. Most of them have played since grade
school, many dedicated the early part of their
lives to training, forgoing the life of a "nor
mal" adolescent or teen-ager in a quest for a
pro career, placement at a good tennis college
or the sheer joy of competition.
Amy Chiminello summed up her dedica
tion succinctly: "I'd rather die than 105e... I'll
play lefty if I break my right arm. I'm going to
try until the last ball is rolling, v she said after
defeating Georgia's Marianna I.and last Fri
day.
Despite tennis' individual character, the
Stanford team this year was not only an asso

ciation of competitors but a close-knit group of
friends. Beth Berris plays a better game
because her team is behind her. Willens and
Poruri "feel naked" when they're not playing
next to each other, pulling each other through
the difficult matches. One cannot help but
conclude that Stanford women's tennis this
year has been much more than the sum of its
parts.
All this should help remind us that Sun
day's loss in Florida was more than a disap
pointment to Cardinal fans hoping to add one
more title to the 1992-93 collection. It shows
us why winning the NCAA Championship is
such a significant accomplishment, but it also
forces us to recognize the value of coming in
second place. Stanford's women tennis play
ers — Laxmi Poruri, Heather Willens, Kim
Shasby, Kristine Kurth, Beth Berris, Amy
Chiminello, Emma Woodhouse, Sonya
Cotero, Wendy Sacks and Mario Carruth —
should be nothing but proud of their 25-3 sea
son record and a No. 2 national ranking. Few
teams ever see those kind of numbers, let
alone see them every year.
Woodhouse played a key role in the Cardi
nal lineup this year after Shasby and Poruri
were sidelined with injuries, winning match
after match at No. 6 singles, and proving her
self as one of the nation's best seventh play
ers. She can look forward to starting on this
squad in the near future.
Chiminello turned in a solid season at No.
6, capped off with incredible upset wins en
route to the Pacific-10 Championship semifi
nals in April. She ranks as one of the most
dangerous, most surprising players in all of
collegiate tennis, as well as one of its fastest
rising stars.

Be iris was the last Stanford player with an
undefeated match record in duals this season,
and played with a stubborn determination
reminiscent of a player named Willens. Her
likeable personality, ever-present baseball cap
and work ethic will surely lead the team into
its next three years of NCAA competition.
Kurth battled through early season ail
ments to become one of Stanford's imposing
— and exciting — players. Her name will
become better known and more feared
throughout the Pac-10 next year.
Shasby overcame a painful foot injuiy to
establish herself as one of the nation's top
players. If she stays healthy, she will join
Poruri in building on Stanford's success next
year, and will likely be called on to shoulder
the No. 2 chores.
Poruri, once again, has proven herself as
the consummate competitor, dominating like
few other could at Stanford's top spot. The
image she will leave with her teammates and
fans this year will surely be her gutsy fist
pumping performance against Georgia's
Anne Chauzu in the quarterfinals, a rare
show of emotion from an otherwise internal
ly-driven player. Next stop: No. 1 in the
nation.
Finally, there is Heather Willens, who fin
ished her Stanford singles career with charac
teristic class. To the end, Willens played the
game that made her successful — fierce, driv
ing baseline shots and aggressive service
returns. She will leave a rich legacy at Stan
ford, and a piece of Stanford Women's Tennis
will depart with her.
Gone are the days of Stanford's — or any
