# Stanford netters still alive in NCAA individual tourney
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
After a disappointing quarterfinal exit
from the NCAA team tournament in
Athens, Ga., members of the men's tennis
team bounced back and gutted out tough
first-round wins in the individual tourna
ment.
Due to early-morning thunderstorms, all
three of the Cardinal's singles entries played
indoors.
No. 7-ranked Michael Flanagan breezed
by Miami's Tonny van de Pieterman 6-4, 6-
0. "That was one of Michael's best matches
of the year," said Cardinal coach Dick
Gould. "He got in a nice groove and had a
steady rhythm going."
No. 25-ranked Robert Devens had a long,
tight match with Virginia Commonwealth's
Isidro Lledo, with each player breaking the
other's serve only once in the entire match.
Devens broke the Spaniard's powerful serve
to take an early 2-0 lead, clinching his 6-3
win in the first set.
Despite several break points in the sec
ond set, Devens failed to capitalize on any of
them. Instead, Lledo broke Devens at 3-2.
Devens could not return the favor and lost
the second set 3-6.
In the third set, the two were neck-and
neck with both holding their serves stub
bornly. At 3-3 in the tiebreaker, Devens
leaped into action and captured the next
four points for a 7-3 victory and a first

round win.
Devens felt that the indoor basketball
court on which the match was played affect
ed his play. "The court was really fast. I felt
uncomfortable throughout the whole
match," he said. "I've never played on that
surface before."
Vimal Patel stepped onto the basketball
court after Devens exited. His victim was
lan Williams of Texas — the same Williams
who had defeated Patel three days earlier in
the team quarterfinals.
With revenge on his mind, Patel matched
Williams serve for serve in the first set until
the score was 5-5. A controversial line call
was awarded to Williams, giving him a ser
vice break over Patel and a 6-5 lead. The
Texas junior served out the set, 7-5.
Patel came roaring back in the second
set, breaking Williams several times and
nabbing a 6-3 win. The third set was a simi
lar story, as Patel dominated play, winning
6-2.
"Patel played a lot better than he did the
other day (against Williams)," Gould said.
"He moved better and played more
assertively. He stayed in the match really
well."
Today, Patel faces UCLA's top hitter,
Sebastien Leblanc. Devens' and Flanagan's
opponents have not been determined yet.
Doubles action begins today, with Flana
gan and Chris Cocotos playing after Flana
gan's singles match. Devens and Patel will
also team up for Stanford.
