# L.A. evens up Campbell finals

### 
TORONTO (AP) â€” Once was
indeed enough for the Los Ange
les Kings.
On Monday night in Game 1, a
third-period collapse led to a 4-1
loss. In Game 2 Wednesday night
the Kings played tight, defensive
hockey in the final 20 minutes,
beating the Toronto Maple Leafs
3-2 and evening the Campbell
Conference finals.
"We played very hard in a hot,
muggy building," Kings coach
Barry Melrose said. "I'm very
proud of our hockey club.
"We wanted to show them how
we play. They haven't seen us play
the way we can, but a lot of that
has to do with Toronto. They're
big and strong and plug up the
holes."
Tomas Sandstrom won it for
the Kings, scoring with 7:40
remaining. He took a pass from
Wayne Gretzky, made one stride
into the left-wing circle and
snapped a high wrist shot. The
puck was in the top corner of the
net before goal tender Felix Potvin

could stretch the mitt on his left
hand to cover the opening.
"Gretzky gave me a nice pass
and I just tried to hit the net,"
Sandstrom said. "I was as sur
prised as anyone when it went in. I
just tried to hit the net. Sometimes
you don't have time to think. You
just try to do what comes by
instinct."
Mike Donnelly and Tony
Granato also scored for the Kings.
Doug Gilmour and Glenn Ander
son scored for the Leafs, who out
shot Los Angeles 29-28.
"We all seemed to sit back and
wait for the Doug Gilmour show,"
Leafs coach Pat Burns said.
"There were too many guys riding
the bus tonight."
Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-7
series will be at Inglewood, Calif.,
on Friday and Sunday.
The game got off to a mercurial
start with three goals in the first
3:59.
Gilmour connected on a power
play 2:25 into the game. He took a
great setup pass from Nik

Borschevsky, induced goaltender
Kelly Hrudey to go down on a fore
hand fake, then pulled the puck to
his backhand and slipped it into
the open side of the net.
Donnelly tied it 31 seconds later
by lifting a rebound past Potvin.
Anderson put Toronto up 2-1.
Wendel Clark passed out of a cor
ner and Anderson, unchecked
while dashing toward the crease,
stuck out his stick blade to redirect
the puck past Hrudey.
Anderson's goal was his 86th in
playoffs, tying him with Mike
Bossy for fourth on the all-time
list.
The Kings squandered a two
man advantage for 32 seconds in
the 15th minute and Toronto
defenseman Jamie Macoun nearly
made it 3-1 after emerging from
the penalty box.
In the second period, Granato
tied it 2-2 with Dave Andreychuk in
the penalty box. He was parked at
the side of the crease to take a pass
from Corey Millen and sweep a shot
between Potvin's legs at 13:00.
