# Mets reshuffle:
## Torborg gets the axe 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Jeff
Torborg, whose New York Mets
had the worst record in baseball
except for the expansion Col
orado Rockies, was fired as man
ager Wednesday night and
replaced by Dallas Green.
Torborg, signed to a four-year
contract after the 1991 season,
was the first manager dismissed
this year. He was 85-115 in his 1
1/4 seasons, and had lost 18 of his
last 23 games.
General manager A 1 Harazin
fired Torborg minutes after the
Mets rallied for a dramatic, 6-4
victory over Pittsburgh. New
York had lost five straight and 18
of 22 before the victory.
New York was fifth last year
in Torborg's initial season with a
72-90 record, and this year was
even worse. New York's 13-25
start was only one game better

than that of the 1962 expansion
Mets — the worst team in mod
ern major league history.
"I'm sorry I couldn't get them
to play," Torborg said after talk
ing to his team. "We didn't play
well. We earned where we are."
"We all share the blame for
the start of the ballclub this
year," Harazin said. "We have all
let Jeff down."
In addition, the Mets fired
first-base coach Barry Foote and
bullpen coach Dave Laßoche.
Darrell Johnson, a former major
league manager, will fill one of
the two vacancies.
Green, 58, was working for
the Mets as a scout. He has a
225-195 career record as a man
ager, leading the Philadelphia
Phillies from 1979-1981. In
1980, he led the Phillies to their
only World Series title.
