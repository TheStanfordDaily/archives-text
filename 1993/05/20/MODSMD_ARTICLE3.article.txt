# Bike storage cost to triple
## Extended student access hours reason for change 
### Nicolas Kuritzky Staff writer 
Promptingyet more student outcry about Univer
sity storage, the cost of on-campus bicycle storage
has been tripled to compensate for extended storage
access hours that began last year.
The price to store a bike for the summer will triple
from $10 — a fee that has been constant for several
years — to $30 this year.
Hours of operation for campus bike-storage loca
tions were extended last year because students com
plained about not having enough time to check in and
retrieve their bikes from storage, according to Roger
Whitney, a Student Housing operations manager.
Justifying the cost increases, Whitney explained
that "a cost reassessment found that the service was
losing money for Student Housing" last year when
bike storage hours were expanded without charging
students more.
The price reflects more than just the space to park
a bike, Whitney said. "You don't just place a bike in
storage and that's the end. You have to stack and tag
all the bicycles, provide security and deal with aban
doned bicycles."
Faced with options of either a price increase or re
duced hours, Whitney said he felt most students
would prefer to pay more for longer check-in and re
trieval hours.
Some students, however, are unhappy with the
price hike. Freshman Greg Martellotto called the in
crease, "another example of University price profi
teering. I will definitely try to find an an alternative
storage facility."
Sophomore Gerald Chen echoed this sentiment,
saying, "I think the increase is unwarranted and
ridiculous."
But Whitney noted that if Housing Operations
loses money from this service, then all students are
indirectly forced to share the losses.
Whitney said even with the fee increase, students
would be hard pressed to find a better deal off cam
pus.
But sophomore Christian Beckner said he has felt
a "general sense of frustration about how the Uni
versity is trying to nickel and dime students to
death."
This price hike follows the University's discontin
uation of summer storage for all other personal prop-
erty and the ASSU Senate's diffi
culties in providing alternative
storage facilities.
Many students say that if they
have to rent an off-campus storage
facility anyway, they might as well
throw their bicycle in with the rest

of their stuff — as Chen plans to do.
However, Whitney said stu
dents may find this option a has
sle. "Students may think differ
ently of their bicycle than their
other possessions. A bicycle is
bulky and may be hard to get into
a car or storage facility."
"You are not forced to store your
bicycles here over the summer,"
he added. "You can store it at a fii
end's house and that would be fine."
