## 
### Sean Kennedy Staff writer 
Few people have their messy desks displayed in
a special exhibit.
But Former Secretary of State George Shultz
does.
A display commemorating the life of Shultz,
also a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, was unveiled this week in the Herbert
Hoover Exhibit Pavilion.
The exhibit, which opened Tuesday, is meant
to coincide with the publication of Shultz's new
autobiography, "Turmoil and Triumph: My Years
as Secretary of State."
Comprised of photos, personal-and official papers
and other memorabilia relating to Shultz's life, the
exhibit's documents emphasize his years in Presi
dent Reagan's cabinet and as secretary of state.
Among the artifacts on display is a replica of
Shultz's desktop as it appeared in his days as sec
retary of state, scattered with papers and other
documents. Shultz held the position from 1982 to
1989.
Shultz attended a private reception with about
50 close friends and colleagues Monday afternoon
to officially open the exhibit.

Assoc. Hoover Archivist Elena Danielson, who
attended the reception, said Shultz was "excited"
about the display.
"It's a beautiful tribute to a man who con
tributed a lot to public service," said Danielson,
who helped put together the exhibit. "He's done a
great deal to enrich the lives of students here at
Stanford," she added.
The first part of the exhibit details Shultz's
early life. Among the documents is a letter his
father wrote to him in 1932, admonishing the
young Shultz to stick to his values. His father
writes, "I pray that you grow up a real man, a
pride to your family and a credit to yourself."
As the display continues, the vast array of
awards, honors and contributions makes clear
that he has stayed true to his father's wishes.
The Presidential Medal of Freedom that Shultz
received from Reagan in 1989 is also shown.
Shultz also served as secretary of labor from
1969 to 1970 and secretary of treasury from 1972
to 1974. He has served in some capacity under
every U.S. president from Dwight Eisenhower to
Reagan.
The exhibit, put together by Shultz and Hoover
archivists, will be open to the public weekdays
through July 31, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
