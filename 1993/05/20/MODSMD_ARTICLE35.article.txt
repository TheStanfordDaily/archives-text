## A
						peek at the weird — Reservoir Dogs 
### 
In the early days of film, directors came
from the theater world, like Orson Welles.
Next, they came from the ranks of studio
craftsmen, like Alfred Hitchcock. Later,
they came from film schools, like Martin
Scorsese.
Now they come from video stores. Like
actor-writer-director Quentin Tarantino.
His 1992 debut film, "Reservoir Dogs,"
immediately caused a stir at last year's U.S.
Sundance Film Festival. At the Cannes Film

Festival, walkouts prompted
by the films harrowing tor
ture scene didn't prevent him
from walking off with the In
ternational Critics Prize.

"Reservoir Dogs" was released to general
audiences last fall to great acclaim. Though
it grossed just under $3 million, which is re
spectable for an independent film, it ended
up on many critics' Top-10 lists — including
my own.
Now it's coming to this Sunday's Flicks.
Combine the dialogue of "Glengarry
Glen Ross" and the kinetic violence of "The
Killer" with the tough-guy antics in "Good
fellas" and you've got "Reservoir Dogs" in a
nutshell — Tarantino's take on white male
paranoia.
The film opens with eight L.A. lowlifes
eating breakfast in a diner. Tarantino tips his
hand early — they're discussing the true
meaning of Madonna's "Like A Virgin,"
which his character claims is a "metaphor
for big dicks."
As he puts it, "When this cat fucks her, it
hurts. It hurts just like it did the first time.
Hence. . . Like A Virgin." Apparently,
Madonna inspires fear in men on L.A.'s
mean streets, as well as in America's heart
land.
Having successfully deconstructed the
Material Girl's seminal text, they move on to
talking about cheap Jews and the merits of
tipping waitresses. Afterwards, the hoods —
identically dressed in their neo- noir apparel
of black suits, white shirts, black shades and

skinny black ties — head out to rob a jewel
ry store.
After the credits roll, we cut straight to
the post-heist insanity. One of the thieves is
bleeding profusely, the others are nowhere
to be found, and someone sold out to
the cops.
"Reservoir Dogs" proceeds like a care
fully structured novel, shifting efficiently
between the past and present to explain
the heist's origins while heightening the

suspense, fcven when we
learn the squealer's identity,
the tension continues to
mount.

There's more going on here than" just a
high body count, though. The all-white,
eight man crime wave spews out invective
against orientals, niggers, spies, bitches
and faggots — "others" who aren't repre
sented in the film — with alarming fre
quency.
These tough guys, or "real men," see
themselves as a dying breed. They define
themselves as what they're not — not fe
male, not black, not gay. Everyone's out to
get them, so they've got to stick together. All
they've got is each other.
But it isn't that easy. These men are ob
sessed with black and female icons, like Pam
"Cleopatra Jones" Grier and Madonna. And
they don't really like or trust each other that
much.
Tarantino seems to be saying that in the
absence of the "other," these white men will
turn on themselves. Indeed, it's not long be
fore each of the thieves suspects the other of
being the rat — and will use any means nec
essary to find out the truth.
Don't go to this flick expecting a deep
socio-political statement, however. A prod
uct of the late '80s, Tarantino's vision is fun
damentally nihilistic Don't trust anyone —
green, hermaphrodite or omni-sexual —
you can only trust yourself, is his insistent
refrain.
Maybe he's got a point, hmm? ■
