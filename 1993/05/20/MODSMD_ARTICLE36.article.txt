## Smash producer of new jazz swing 
### 
The following is based on an exclusive
interview with NYC's Smash Hunter.
The Chronicle covered hip-hop and
jazz, but they couldn't get this — nor could
the New York Times — and when the SF
Weekly runs a similar story, they won't have
this either.
Buy as many of the Smash-produced
Newßreed records as possible. The sound
blends the intensity of rap's dopest rhythms

with the complexity of bebop.
It takes both jazz and hip-hop
to a new pinnacle, remaining
true to its funk underpin
nings, without faking its me
anders into house.

A DJ, producer, mixer, label
exec and A & R man, Smash
remixed the first dance-oriented single for
the seminal jazz label Bluenote, Greg Osby's
"Man-Talk." He's the one who did the pro
duction work on GangStarr rapper Guru's
past two singles. And Digable Planets cred
its Giant Step in Manhattan, Smash's club,
on their latest single.
Although Greg Osby is no Miles Davis,
Easy Mo Bee is no Smash Hunter — and
Miles was sleeping large when he worked
with Mr. Mo Bee on "Doo-Bop."
So go to Giant Step, see the man spin live
— it's an evening of hip-hop, some dance
hall, but mostly Smash, some beat tracks
and a live band kickin' it with the people
weaving improvisational skills, from the
voice to the flute, to the two 1200s. Giant
Step's sole drawback? It's in New York. If you
think you'd be interested in the jazz/hip
hop hybrid you can check out Brass in LA.,
or Nickie's, School, and Mr. Fives in San
Francisco.
Smash describes the vibe at Giant Step as
neither hip-hop nor reggae nor jazz, but the
intersection of all three. He's right — the
crowd was easily the most diverse we've par
tied with, yet there did seem to be a defini
tive style emerging somewhere in the
clothes or the attitude. A commitment to

finding entertainment that, as Smash sug
gests, can't be fueled by hype — Giant Step
is quality control.
It's not an already-established groove
you can buy into. Smash describes it as an
"organic thing," where everyone has to work
to understand what's going on and how to
keep it going.
He scorns the "this is for this group and
that's for that group" mentalities. For him,

the '90s will be about
"wholism" and building
bridges in order to break
the strangleholds of media
hype machines. He was
around for the '60s and
holds a lot of what was

going on then as dear, yet
unfinished and people need to know how to
have fun together while they're learning to
respect each others' rights.
Smash suggests that people get over their
"purist attitudes" about what belongs where,
or how, because that breeds separation. As a
DJ and producer, he's proud of his ability to
bring diverse people together and help get
exposure for the unique trips of talented
people who wouldn't normally get exposed.
However, he sometimes worries that
when material leaves his studio, the scene
he's helped create becomes "wallpaper
music" in the open market. He's heard some
of his tracks on commercial radio used as a
sound bed for Red Alert to chat over.
For the larger crowds this hybrid music
often doesn't make sense. Instead of hearing
dope rhymes, they hear phat solos; instead
of hearing synthesized house, they hear the
same rhythms performed by a live quartet.
Smash's palette and pastiche aren't hard
to get with, but they do demand an open
mind. It's not like listening to an early Monk
track with an untrained ear — it's more like
hearing the sounds you like all blended up,
pushing the envelope of the accepted and
expected out to other galaxies while keeping
it friendly and inviting. ■
