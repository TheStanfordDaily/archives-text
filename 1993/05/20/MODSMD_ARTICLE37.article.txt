# Van Peebles’
## ’POSSE’ the
						director's take on his revisionist western 
### Victor Baseman 
When director Melvin Van Peebles decid
ed to try his luck at filmmaking some 30 years
ago, about the only thing brothers and sisters
could do while a camera rolled was coon or
sing ol' negro spirituals. So Van Peebles head
ed for France, hoping he'd find that country's
film scene more nurturing.
Ten years later, he returned to the States as
the French delegate to the San Francisco In
ternational Film Festival. "My return was a
major embarrassment to the Hollywood es
tablishment," he muses. "The Hollywood es
tablishment's posture was that 'When you've
learned the intricacies of filmmaking, we will
let one of you people direct.'
Van Peebles' foreign credentials helped
change all that. So when Hollywood opened
its doors for him, things got easier for other
black filmmakers as well.
Today, Van Peebles is seen by contempo
rary black directors as the godfather of mod
ern black cinema. "With 'Sweet Back's Bad
Ass Song,' I wanted to prove to black people
that they could make films themselves."
Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding.
Everyone from Spike Lee, to the Hudlin
Brothers, to John Singleton, to Melvin Van
Peebles' son, actor-turned-director Mario
point to him as the inspiration for their own
work in film. And in the case of his son,
they've collaborated on a number of projects,
including "Sweet Back's Bad Ass Song"
(Mario plays Sweet Back as a child).
Recently, the elder Van Peebles put on the
familiar actor's cap to participate in his son's
latest undertaking, "Posse," the story of a
group of black, 19th-century ex-soldiers' re
turn from the Spanish-American War.
Just as the elder Van Peebles wished to
show black audiences of the '70s a hero who
wins, the younger Van Peebles attempts to

show black audiences of the '90s a story taken
from a traditionally ignored segment of
American history.
"Posse" never has a problem being differ
ent. Of course, different isn't always better,
particularly when it jeopardizes the general
quality of a film. From the Sy
Richardson/Dario Scardapan screenplay, to
the acting, to the direction, there's hardly an
aspect of "Posse" that isn't inferior to "New
Jack City." It's really unfortunate, because the

X didn't know that of the first 44
settlers, 2G were Afro-Amerloan;
that the slaves who handled the

cowboys/

director's motivations feel as noble as Spike
Lee's did for "Malcolm X."
"One of the first plays I did," recalls the
younger Van Peebles, "was called 'the Legend
of Denver Dick,' the story of a black cowboy.
Up 'til then, like most folks, I was pretty igno
rant about our involvement. I didn't know
that of the first 44 settlers, 26 were Afro-
American; that the slaves who handled the
cows and horse were called 'damn cowboys.'
"The New York Times points out that
there were black heroes and personalities in
the West who were played as white in Holly
wood westerns."
"I began to realize," he continues, "that
Hollywood's (portrayals) never told us we
were there. Then I saw an old western with
Woody Strodes. He was the first brother I saw
in a western that didn't shuffle, that didn't

roll his eyes. 'Ok,' I said. 'Don't let me get in
the house...' "
Well, Van Peebles is in the house... but he
just doesn't realize how dangerously close he is
to being crushed like a flea. It's as if the film
making smarts that trailed behind him during
the making of "New Jack City" desert him the
way the central character of "Posse," Jessie Lee
(Mario Van Peebles), deserts his commanding
officer, Colonel Graham (Billy Zane).
As an action film, "Posse" is only fair, even

with it's Spanish-American War and Wild
West back-drops. Somehow, we're never
made to feel as if we're standing in the middle
of a vicious struggle, the way Van Peebles sug
gests we should:
"History tells us that during the Spanish-
American War in Cuba, Teddy Roosevelt's
rough riders took the San Juan Hill. But there's
a little paragraph that says, 'after the black
troops cleared the way.' They put the brothers
on the front line as cannon fodder. So some of
your baddest Fighters were brothers who
learned how to shoot in the white man's army."
But in shoot-out after shoot-out, stunts
that are supposed to remind us of these
brothers' toughness fail to solicit so much as
a blink. For instance, in one scene, Jessie Lee
confronts the racist sheriff of an all-white
town near his birth place, Freemanville.

In the time it takes the sheriff to pull his
weapon, Jessie's already fired, and we're being
treated to a campy close-up tracking shot of
the bullet as it heads for the sheriff's gut.
Nothing could be duller. Furthermore, the
action choreography often shirks originality,
as if to say "gripping violence" just isn't ap
propriate in a black history lesson mas
querading as an action flick.
Also disappointing are Van Peebles' indif
ference to continuity and detail, as manifest
ed in faulty photographic props, dialects and
accents, and show tunes that make no at
tempt to match the era. But casting himself as
Jessie Lee as well as a random sex scene with
actress Salli Richardson (Lana) are by far the
director's most unforgivable goofs.
Though he may physically look the part,
Van Peebles just can't cut the mustard as the
film's withdrawn and vengeful lead. His idea
of a western screen presence is a 12-pack of
hang-dog expressions strapped to a couple of
six shooters. And the situation only deterio
rates once he beds the attractive Richardson.
It's hard to give a guy the benefit of the doubt
when his ego is shifted into triple over-drive.
"Regardless of whether or not I make an
other movie, it says something to Hollywood.
Yes we're interested in our own history and
we're ready to step outside of the 'hood."
Fortunately, the Richardson/Scardapane
screenplay suggests that the blame shouldn't
rest solely on Van Peebles. These guys don't
write characters, they write character shad
ows, which explains why even the film's bet
ter performances bare a close resemblance to
cardboard.
Though it tries earnestly to meet the lofty
promises of its filmmakers, like a drunken
partier, "Posse" would be better off driving
home in the morning after a nice crash on the
sofa. ■
