McMillan loves to teach, though her own career
didn't begin with multitudinous creative-writing

classes, writing

Her story reads
like the dream
of every work
ing stiff aspiring
to be the next
great American
author.
Born in
1951 in Port

Huron, Mich, to
a working class family, she moved to Brooklyn at an
early age and eventally wound up at Berkeley major
ing in journalism. Thereafter, she returned to New
York and while working as a secretary, McMillan
wrote her first novel, "Mama" — a tale of a single
mom struggling to keep her family intact — in 1987.
McMillan generated her own publicity for "Mama,"
sending out hundreds of letters she typed up after
hours, encouraging bookstores to stock her book and
offering to do readings. That same year, she left New
York for Wyoming to teach creative writing. In 1989,
she followed up "Mama" with "Disappearing Acts," an
urban love story.
"Waiting to Exhale" hit the bookstores one year ago
almost to the date and appeared on the New York
Times Bestseller list in its first week of printing. By
week three, the book was already in its 10th printing,
and by week six, Viking had sold the publishing rights
for "Waiting to Exhale" for $2.64 million — not a
record, but second only to Scott Turow's "Presumed
Innocent," which netted $3 million.
All this for a tale of four minority women trying to
find a decent date.
Qn the blackboard in Kimball conference
room, McMillan scrawls in big letters:
"Whose story is it?" while everyone in class
nervously clutches four pages, their first
attempt at beginning a short story. She
picks a name from the attendance list when
nobody volunteers to read.
"Is everybody clear on how we give our com

ments?" she asks. "Listen for your emotional reac
tion. Do you care at all what happens to these char
acters?"
When the opening has been read, each person
offers constructive criticism. McMillan sets out the
main issues: Was the character interesting? What is
the writer striving for in this passage? Whose story is
this, and what's at stake for the characters?
Someone reads a story set in the deep South that
focuses on a strange tree visited by the spirits of
hanged slaves. In addition to the classes' reaction,
McMillan adds her own comments, a furious mixture
of practical advice and unadulterated bluntness. She
will often get up, read over a student's shoulder, and
point out a memorable image, clever diction or areas
that should be chopped out en masse.
"Don't populate it with too many characters, espe
cially when they're all potentially interesting," she
says, leaning forward from her chair. "Make the time
frame clearer. Time is an issue in this story. Why cut
down that tree now? And who is doing it? Why don't

Ms. Ruby cut the fuckin' tree down now?
And don't tell me how blue her eyes are.
Just let me [visualize] it by setting up the
contrast so that I do the work."
You might think that listening to
novices' attempts at fiction offer few
epiphanies, especially for an established
writer like McMillan, but she claims that it
gives her a perspective on her own writing.
"It's refreshing and sobering to see peo
ple and remember myself in their position,
even though I only took two workshops,"
she says during her "office" hours, which
are held in a cramped conference room

immediately after class.
Cheo Coker, a junior and an English major taking
seminar, says:"I think it's a very positive class. It's
not the kind of class where she's going bestow this
gift on you. She shows you the basics. It's not the sort
of class where they coddle you. It's a self-motivated
class. And she's pretty frank when it comes to com
ments. I do think she should have kept the class
smaller, though."
McMillan enjoys expending energy in her class,
and she keeps a quick tempo. Luckily for her stu
dents, her weakness for chocolate products
encouraged her to release some of those watts at
Stanford:

"I came here to read in January, over in Branner.
[Branner Resident Fellow] Kennell Jackson was
hounding me for a long time. Last summer he came
to a reading and gave me these chocolate chip cook
ies, and so I came and read. After the reading, [Prof.]
Horace Porter of African and Afro-American studies
said to me: 'Terry, would you ever consider teaching
here?' And I said sure, sort of off the cuff. And to
make a long story short, he followed it up."
McMillan has been on leave from the University of
Arizona for two years, and after all the commotion
from "Waiting to Exhale," she jumped at the chance to
get back into teaching:
"I was going through a very strange period where I
hadn't really started a new book yet and I was really
exhausted with all the hoopla over this last book. I
needed to do something that would ground me in
reality. 1 was thinking that teaching would do that."
With a packed schedule of more interviews and
book tours, McMillan got an offer from Porter to
teach spring quarter — even though it was already
March. She immediately accepted.
With about five years of teaching creative writing
under her belt, McMillan has developed a clear notion
of how her classes should work. She says she strives for
a laid-back atmosphere in her classes, dispensing with
some of the more common instructional methods
found in fiction-writing classes — such as photocopy
ing a student's story, passing it out and having every
one criticize it at home. McMillan staunchly advocates
reading orally, and relying on spontaneous feeling to

drive the class:
"All literature isn't meant to be read out loud, but
you can catch a lot of things that don't work: when it's
phony, when it's forced, if they use too many adverbs
or adjectives or if they use flashback in the beginning,
or too much narrative, or if it's too expository."
And how do the sons and daughters of Stanford
rate as pupils? "The students were a little dead at
first," she says. "Everybody was so serious, and I think
it may have something to do with the place we're in.
They were all out with their little pens ready to take
notes."
Part of that, says McMillan, also may have stemmed
from the notoriety she received from "Exhale," adding
that the media attention might have created an unwel
come distance between her and her students, one that
she has tried to bridge.
"Some [students] wanted to take the workshop, I
think, for the wrong reasons," she says. To the disap
pointment of some of her pupils, she possesses no
magic formula that will transform them into superb
writers:
"There are some students who don't think I have a
magic formula, but some variation of it, so that if they

pay close attention, something will click. I've basically
dispelled all of that shit by letting them know there's
no magic.
"I've tried to get them to understand that there's no
right or wrong thing you can say, and that this is not
literary criticism. I don't deal with a lot of elements
that most people discuss in an English class —
metaphor, symbolism and all that — these students
have already studied that stuff." Indeed, overattention
to device is one of the obstacles McMillan strives to
dismantle.
Finding one's voice, she claims, is the most impor
tant thing a beginning writer can do. Though anyone
can learn the mechanics of writing — by reading
how-to books, attending workshops or simply imitat
ing your favorite author — only honest, personally
involved writing will unearth one's voice:
"There are a lot of good technicians out there. You
can imitate Proust, Hemingway, Faulkner — all these
motherfuckers. And you read enough of them in the
literature classes. But some of it doesn't work any
more. It's not our voice, it's not our time and even the
language is different."
Many young writers focus on some romantic

notion of what being a writer means, says McMillan,
rather than concentrating on the stories that drive
them to write.
"Most of those," says McMillan, "are the ones who
don't have as much talent. Those are the ones who usu
ally are the best technicians, but their stories are usually
flat. The ones who are usually the most ambitious, the
ones who want to be a writer, they're more interested in
being a writer than they are in telling stories."
McMillan's own back-to-the-basics teaching style
may reflect her own voice, one which doesn't restrain
tart language and rarely delights in magic realism,
weirdly shifting points of view or surreal plotting.
"A lot of young writers are preoccupied with sym
bolism," she says with exasperation. "What does the
fence mean? And there's the door closing and open
ing, closing and opening. Who gives a fuck? Open the
door and close the door. What people want is just a
plain old fucking story, where they can identify with
what these people are going through."
McMillan's Zen-like approach extends to her own
day-to-day grind when she's hammering out sen
tences on her computer. Rather than constantly edit
ing herself as she writes, she sometimes writes 100
pages at a stretch before going back and unleashing
the red pen.
"I think it's the most dangerous thing any writer
can do," she says, speaking about the constant pruning
that many writers inflict upon themselves. "You get
more preoccupied with the words on the page than
with the people in the story. The people are more
important, and when you're not thinking about it,
that's when you're writing a lot more honestly. And
that's usually when your voice comes out."
Now that we know all these techniques and
exercises, can we give up that day job and
be the toast of the New York publishing
world? McMillan doesn't think so. "What
it takes to be a good writer is compassion,
and not everybody is all that compassion
ate," she says. "If you only care about yourself — and
you can't really put yourself in somebody's else's
shoes or you don't care to spend the energy — you'll
have a tough time. Part of writing is not being so
self-absorbed. There are some people who can't get
past that."
"Waiting to Exhale" features four pairs of shoes: all
of which are filled by thirtysomething black women
trying to find a. decent man and a decent life apart
from the house, the car and the steady job they already
have.
The language, simple and streetwise, doesn't aim to
be lyrical — but in a world of disastrous dates, out-of
shape lovers and desperate attempts to beat the bio
logical clock, it effectively conveys the desperation and
exasperation many women probably feel.
Desires and conflicts, however, often are too easily
drawn ("Like a fool you acquiesced too soon and gave
up too much. You fell right into the blueprint of his
life and gave up your own") and the men are so straw
filled they simply ask to be kicked in the teeth.
Set in Phoenix, "Exhale" establishes little sense of
place, a common problem in novels that emphasize
long stretches of monologue and dialogue. Lack of
place might explain why some of the scenes in
"Exhale" seem suspended in mid-air, like episodes in a
soap opera. The book is at its best when the scenes
seem grounded, such as at a hair salon where the char
acters converge to chat and have a good time, or at the
small party that the women throw for themselves.
There are no epistemological meditations here, no
themes that shed light on the depths of racism or sex
ism. But with the explosive popularity of "Exhale,"
McMillan tapped a rich vein of readers whose person
al concerns have not, until now, been properly
addressed. But with interviewer after interviewer wild
ly clamoring about her book, McMillan is tired of
talking about "Exhale" and ready to move on:
"After this book, a lot of publishers just woke up

and said, 'Gee whiz, black people do read,' " she says.
"And a lot of people have tried to make it seem that
I'm responsible for this, and I don't like to take credit
for that. I think what publishers were thinking is that
black people don't buy books, so now they are scram
bling, hoping that they can find the next Terry
McMillan or somebody whom they hope can write
contemporary black fiction and whom they can make
a trillion dollars off of."
The millions of which McMillan speaks come with
a price, however. Though vaulted into the stratosphere
of popular fiction and packing in mob-like crowds at
bookstore readings, McMillan hasn't received the kind
of critical applause that surround writers such as Toni
Morrison and Alice Walker, whose works tend to be
less commercial and less widely read by black audi-

'What does the fence
mean? And there's
the door closing
and opening,closing
and opening. Who
gives a fuck?'

ences. In addition, McMillan has noted that Morrison
and Walker have been fairly indifferent towards her
work.
Calling McMillan "a mediocre novelist whose work
is consecrated to the spirits of women and blacks," the
New Republic and other critics disparage her work as
being dialogue-driven and populated with simple
characters. Some have even called McMillan, without
rancor, "the black Judith Krantz."
"That really pisses me off," McMillan says."The
attitude is: since so many people are reading it, it can't
be serious or it can't be that good.
"A lot of black people can't read Alice Walker or
Toni Morrison, because they don't understand what
they're trying to say. That's not to take away from how
they write, because I think they're brilliant writers,
particularly Toni," she says.
"I'll put it this way: their work is intimidating for a
lot of black people. There's a lot of things going on in
these stories that's just not touching their world.
Magic realism? It's not happening in the projects nor
in the 'hood. If they want to be carried away, they
want to be carried away to a place that at least is
familiar."
Though professional respect is an important issue
for McMillan, as it would be for anyone in the high
brow world of fiction, she feels she gets her respect,
and from an audience she is proud to have. "I am no
Judith Krantz," she says firmly. "They're not studying
Judith Krantz in Berkeley or other major universities.
Critics can label me anything they want, but the bot
tom line is that the people who read me take me seri
ously. And you do get punished when you sell a lot of
books. There's a price you pay.
"I'll take the high-school-dropout reader who is
affected by my story any day. I'll take a million of
those, more than 5,000 who expect something else.
I've done thousands of readings with thousands of
people that say, '1 haven't read a book in years,' or
'This is the first book I've ever finished,' or even 'This
is the first book I've ever read' — and that means
something to me. That means more to me than what
critics say... a whole lot more." ■

"I'll take the high-school-dropout reader who is
affected by my story any day. I'll take a million of
those, more than 5,000 who expect something else.
I've done thousands of readings with thousands of
people that say, '1 haven't read a book in years,' or
'This is the first book I've ever finished,' or even 'This
is the first book I've ever read' — and that means
something to me. That means more to me than what
critics say... a whole lot more." ■

McMillan loves to teach, though her own career
didn't begin with multitudinous creative-writing

classes, writing
fellowships or
an MFA degree.
Her story reads
like the dream
of every work
ing stiff aspiring
to be the next
great American
author.
Born in
1951 in Port

Huron, Mich, to
a working class family, she moved to Brooklyn at an
early age and eventally wound up at Berkeley major
ing in journalism. Thereafter, she returned to New
York and while working as a secretary, McMillan
wrote her first novel, "Mama" — a tale of a single
mom struggling to keep her family intact — in 1987.
McMillan generated her own publicity for "Mama,"
sending out hundreds of letters she typed up after
hours, encouraging bookstores to stock her book and
offering to do readings. That same year, she left New
York for Wyoming to teach creative writing. In 1989,
she followed up "Mama" with "Disappearing Acts," an
urban love story.
"Waiting to Exhale" hit the bookstores one year ago
almost to the date and appeared on the New York
Times Bestseller list in its first week of printing. By
week three, the book was already in its 10th printing,
and by week six, Viking had sold the publishing rights
for "Waiting to Exhale" for $2.64 million — not a
record, but second only to Scott Turow's "Presumed
Innocent," which netted $3 million.
All this for a tale of four minority women trying to
find a decent date.
Qn the blackboard in Kimball conference
room, McMillan scrawls in big letters:
"Whose story is it?" while everyone in class
nervously clutches four pages, their first
attempt at beginning a short story. She
picks a name from the attendance list when
nobody volunteers to read.
"Is everybody clear on how we give our com

ments?" she asks. "Listen for your emotional reac
tion. Do you care at all what happens to these char
acters?"
When the opening has been read, each person
offers constructive criticism. McMillan sets out the
main issues: Was the character interesting? What is
the writer striving for in this passage? Whose story is
this, and what's at stake for the characters?
Someone reads a story set in the deep South that
focuses on a strange tree visited by the spirits of
hanged slaves. In addition to the classes' reaction,
McMillan adds her own comments, a furious mixture
of practical advice and unadulterated bluntness. She
will often get up, read over a student's shoulder, and
point out a memorable image, clever diction or areas
that should be chopped out en masse.
"Don't populate it with too many characters, espe
cially when they're all potentially interesting," she
says, leaning forward from her chair. "Make the time
frame clearer. Time is an issue in this story. Why cut
down that tree now? And who is doing it? Why don't

Ms. Ruby cut the fuckin' tree down now?
And don't tell me how blue her eyes are.
Just let me [visualize] it by setting up the
contrast so that I do the work."
You might think that listening to
novices' attempts at fiction offer few
epiphanies, especially for an established
writer like McMillan, but she claims that it
gives her a perspective on her own writing.
"It's refreshing and sobering to see peo
ple and remember myself in their position,
even though I only took two workshops,"
she says during her "office" hours, which
are held in a cramped conference room

immediately after class.
Cheo Coker, a junior and an English major taking
seminar, says:"I think it's a very positive class. It's
not the kind of class where she's going bestow this
gift on you. She shows you the basics. It's not the sort
of class where they coddle you. It's a self-motivated
class. And she's pretty frank when it comes to com
ments. I do think she should have kept the class
smaller, though."
McMillan enjoys expending energy in her class,
and she keeps a quick tempo. Luckily for her stu
dents, her weakness for chocolate products
encouraged her to release some of those watts at
Stanford:

"I came here to read in January, over in Branner.
[Branner Resident Fellow] Kennell Jackson was
hounding me for a long time. Last summer he came
to a reading and gave me these chocolate chip cook
ies, and so I came and read. After the reading, [Prof.]
Horace Porter of African and Afro-American studies
said to me: 'Terry, would you ever consider teaching
here?' And I said sure, sort of off the cuff. And to
make a long story short, he followed it up."
McMillan has been on leave from the University of
Arizona for two years, and after all the commotion
from "Waiting to Exhale," she jumped at the chance to
get back into teaching:
"I was going through a very strange period where I
hadn't really started a new book yet and I was really
exhausted with all the hoopla over this last book. I
needed to do something that would ground me in
reality. 1 was thinking that teaching would do that."
With a packed schedule of more interviews and
book tours, McMillan got an offer from Porter to
teach spring quarter — even though it was already
March. She immediately accepted.
With about five years of teaching creative writing
under her belt, McMillan has developed a clear notion
of how her classes should work. She says she strives for
a laid-back atmosphere in her classes, dispensing with
some of the more common instructional methods
found in fiction-writing classes — such as photocopy
ing a student's story, passing it out and having every
one criticize it at home. McMillan staunchly advocates
reading orally, and relying on spontaneous feeling to

drive the class:
"All literature isn't meant to be read out loud, but
you can catch a lot of things that don't work: when it's
phony, when it's forced, if they use too many adverbs
or adjectives or if they use flashback in the beginning,
or too much narrative, or if it's too expository."
And how do the sons and daughters of Stanford
rate as pupils? "The students were a little dead at
first," she says. "Everybody was so serious, and I think
it may have something to do with the place we're in.
They were all out with their little pens ready to take
notes."
Part of that, says McMillan, also may have stemmed
from the notoriety she received from "Exhale," adding
that the media attention might have created an unwel
come distance between her and her students, one that
she has tried to bridge.
"Some [students] wanted to take the workshop, I
think, for the wrong reasons," she says. To the disap
pointment of some of her pupils, she possesses no
magic formula that will transform them into superb
writers:
"There are some students who don't think I have a
magic formula, but some variation of it, so that if they

pay close attention, something will click. I've basically
dispelled all of that shit by letting them know there's
no magic.
"I've tried to get them to understand that there's no
right or wrong thing you can say, and that this is not
literary criticism. I don't deal with a lot of elements
that most people discuss in an English class —
metaphor, symbolism and all that — these students
have already studied that stuff." Indeed, overattention
to device is one of the obstacles McMillan strives to
dismantle.
Finding one's voice, she claims, is the most impor
tant thing a beginning writer can do. Though anyone
can learn the mechanics of writing — by reading
how-to books, attending workshops or simply imitat
ing your favorite author — only honest, personally
involved writing will unearth one's voice:
"There are a lot of good technicians out there. You
can imitate Proust, Hemingway, Faulkner — all these
motherfuckers. And you read enough of them in the
literature classes. But some of it doesn't work any
more. It's not our voice, it's not our time and even the
language is different."
Many young writers focus on some romantic

notion of what being a writer means, says McMillan,
rather than concentrating on the stories that drive
them to write.
"Most of those," says McMillan, "are the ones who
don't have as much talent. Those are the ones who usu
ally are the best technicians, but their stories are usually
flat. The ones who are usually the most ambitious, the
ones who want to be a writer, they're more interested in
being a writer than they are in telling stories."
McMillan's own back-to-the-basics teaching style
may reflect her own voice, one which doesn't restrain
tart language and rarely delights in magic realism,
weirdly shifting points of view or surreal plotting.
"A lot of young writers are preoccupied with sym
bolism," she says with exasperation. "What does the
fence mean? And there's the door closing and open
ing, closing and opening. Who gives a fuck? Open the
door and close the door. What people want is just a
plain old fucking story, where they can identify with
what these people are going through."
McMillan's Zen-like approach extends to her own
day-to-day grind when she's hammering out sen
tences on her computer. Rather than constantly edit
ing herself as she writes, she sometimes writes 100
pages at a stretch before going back and unleashing
the red pen.
"I think it's the most dangerous thing any writer
can do," she says, speaking about the constant pruning
that many writers inflict upon themselves. "You get
more preoccupied with the words on the page than
with the people in the story. The people are more
important, and when you're not thinking about it,
that's when you're writing a lot more honestly. And
that's usually when your voice comes out."
Now that we know all these techniques and
exercises, can we give up that day job and
be the toast of the New York publishing
world? McMillan doesn't think so. "What
it takes to be a good writer is compassion,
and not everybody is all that compassion
ate," she says. "If you only care about yourself — and
you can't really put yourself in somebody's else's
shoes or you don't care to spend the energy — you'll
have a tough time. Part of writing is not being so
self-absorbed. There are some people who can't get
past that."
"Waiting to Exhale" features four pairs of shoes: all
of which are filled by thirtysomething black women
trying to find a. decent man and a decent life apart
from the house, the car and the steady job they already
have.
The language, simple and streetwise, doesn't aim to
be lyrical — but in a world of disastrous dates, out-of
shape lovers and desperate attempts to beat the bio
logical clock, it effectively conveys the desperation and
exasperation many women probably feel.
Desires and conflicts, however, often are too easily
drawn ("Like a fool you acquiesced too soon and gave
up too much. You fell right into the blueprint of his
life and gave up your own") and the men are so straw
filled they simply ask to be kicked in the teeth.
Set in Phoenix, "Exhale" establishes little sense of
place, a common problem in novels that emphasize
long stretches of monologue and dialogue. Lack of
place might explain why some of the scenes in
"Exhale" seem suspended in mid-air, like episodes in a
soap opera. The book is at its best when the scenes
seem grounded, such as at a hair salon where the char
acters converge to chat and have a good time, or at the
small party that the women throw for themselves.
There are no epistemological meditations here, no
themes that shed light on the depths of racism or sex
ism. But with the explosive popularity of "Exhale,"
McMillan tapped a rich vein of readers whose person
al concerns have not, until now, been properly
addressed. But with interviewer after interviewer wild
ly clamoring about her book, McMillan is tired of
talking about "Exhale" and ready to move on:
"After this book, a lot of publishers just woke up

and said, 'Gee whiz, black people do read,' " she says.
"And a lot of people have tried to make it seem that
I'm responsible for this, and I don't like to take credit
for that. I think what publishers were thinking is that
black people don't buy books, so now they are scram
bling, hoping that they can find the next Terry
McMillan or somebody whom they hope can write
contemporary black fiction and whom they can make
a trillion dollars off of."
The millions of which McMillan speaks come with
a price, however. Though vaulted into the stratosphere
of popular fiction and packing in mob-like crowds at
bookstore readings, McMillan hasn't received the kind
of critical applause that surround writers such as Toni
Morrison and Alice Walker, whose works tend to be
less commercial and less widely read by black audi-

'What does the fence
mean? And there's
the door closing
and opening,closing
and opening. Who
gives a fuck?'

ences. In addition, McMillan has noted that Morrison
and Walker have been fairly indifferent towards her
work.
Calling McMillan "a mediocre novelist whose work
is consecrated to the spirits of women and blacks," the
New Republic and other critics disparage her work as
being dialogue-driven and populated with simple
characters. Some have even called McMillan, without
rancor, "the black Judith Krantz."
"That really pisses me off," McMillan says."The
attitude is: since so many people are reading it, it can't
be serious or it can't be that good.
"A lot of black people can't read Alice Walker or
Toni Morrison, because they don't understand what
they're trying to say. That's not to take away from how
they write, because I think they're brilliant writers,
particularly Toni," she says.
"I'll put it this way: their work is intimidating for a
lot of black people. There's a lot of things going on in
these stories that's just not touching their world.
Magic realism? It's not happening in the projects nor
in the 'hood. If they want to be carried away, they
want to be carried away to a place that at least is
familiar."
Though professional respect is an important issue
for McMillan, as it would be for anyone in the high
brow world of fiction, she feels she gets her respect,
and from an audience she is proud to have. "I am no
Judith Krantz," she says firmly. "They're not studying
Judith Krantz in Berkeley or other major universities.
Critics can label me anything they want, but the bot
tom line is that the people who read me take me seri
ously. And you do get punished when you sell a lot of
books. There's a price you pay.
"I'll take the high-school-dropout reader who is
affected by my story any day. I'll take a million of
those, more than 5,000 who expect something else.
I've done thousands of readings with thousands of
people that say, '1 haven't read a book in years,' or
'This is the first book I've ever finished,' or even 'This
is the first book I've ever read' — and that means
something to me. That means more to me than what
critics say... a whole lot more." ■

familiar."
Though professional respect is an important issue
for McMillan, as it would be for anyone in the high
brow world of fiction, she feels she gets her respect,
and from an audience she is proud to have. "I am no
Judith Krantz," she says firmly. "They're not studying
Judith Krantz in Berkeley or other major universities.
Critics can label me anything they want, but the bot
tom line is that the people who read me take me seri
ously. And you do get punished when you sell a lot of
books. There's a price you pay.
"I'll take the high-school-dropout reader who is
affected by my story any day. I'll take a million of
those, more than 5,000 who expect something else.
I've done thousands of readings with thousands of
people that say, '1 haven't read a book in years,' or
'This is the first book I've ever finished,' or even 'This
is the first book I've ever read' — and that means
something to me. That means more to me than what
critics say... a whole lot more." ■

McMillan loves to teach, though her own career
didn't begin with multitudinous creative-writing

classes, writing
fellowships or
an MFA degree.
Her story reads
like the dream
of every work
ing stiff aspiring
to be the next
great American
author.
Born in
1951 in Port

Huron, Mich, to
a working class family, she moved to Brooklyn at an
early age and eventally wound up at Berkeley major
ing in journalism. Thereafter, she returned to New
York and while working as a secretary, McMillan
wrote her first novel, "Mama" — a tale of a single
mom struggling to keep her family intact — in 1987.
McMillan generated her own publicity for "Mama,"
sending out hundreds of letters she typed up after
hours, encouraging bookstores to stock her book and
offering to do readings. That same year, she left New
York for Wyoming to teach creative writing. In 1989,
she followed up "Mama" with "Disappearing Acts," an
urban love story.
"Waiting to Exhale" hit the bookstores one year ago
almost to the date and appeared on the New York
Times Bestseller list in its first week of printing. By
week three, the book was already in its 10th printing,
and by week six, Viking had sold the publishing rights
for "Waiting to Exhale" for $2.64 million — not a
record, but second only to Scott Turow's "Presumed
Innocent," which netted $3 million.
All this for a tale of four minority women trying to
find a decent date.
Qn the blackboard in Kimball conference
room, McMillan scrawls in big letters:
"Whose story is it?" while everyone in class
nervously clutches four pages, their first
attempt at beginning a short story. She
picks a name from the attendance list when
nobody volunteers to read.
"Is everybody clear on how we give our com

ments?" she asks. "Listen for your emotional reac
tion. Do you care at all what happens to these char
acters?"
When the opening has been read, each person
offers constructive criticism. McMillan sets out the
main issues: Was the character interesting? What is
the writer striving for in this passage? Whose story is
this, and what's at stake for the characters?
Someone reads a story set in the deep South that
focuses on a strange tree visited by the spirits of
hanged slaves. In addition to the classes' reaction,
McMillan adds her own comments, a furious mixture
of practical advice and unadulterated bluntness. She
will often get up, read over a student's shoulder, and
point out a memorable image, clever diction or areas
that should be chopped out en masse.
"Don't populate it with too many characters, espe
cially when they're all potentially interesting," she
says, leaning forward from her chair. "Make the time
frame clearer. Time is an issue in this story. Why cut
down that tree now? And who is doing it? Why don't

Ms. Ruby cut the fuckin' tree down now?
And don't tell me how blue her eyes are.
Just let me [visualize] it by setting up the
contrast so that I do the work."
You might think that listening to
novices' attempts at fiction offer few
epiphanies, especially for an established
writer like McMillan, but she claims that it
gives her a perspective on her own writing.
"It's refreshing and sobering to see peo
ple and remember myself in their position,
even though I only took two workshops,"
she says during her "office" hours, which
are held in a cramped conference room

immediately after class.
Cheo Coker, a junior and an English major taking
seminar, says:"I think it's a very positive class. It's
not the kind of class where she's going bestow this
gift on you. She shows you the basics. It's not the sort
of class where they coddle you. It's a self-motivated
class. And she's pretty frank when it comes to com
ments. I do think she should have kept the class
smaller, though."
McMillan enjoys expending energy in her class,
and she keeps a quick tempo. Luckily for her stu
dents, her weakness for chocolate products
encouraged her to release some of those watts at
Stanford:

"I came here to read in January, over in Branner.
[Branner Resident Fellow] Kennell Jackson was
hounding me for a long time. Last summer he came
to a reading and gave me these chocolate chip cook
ies, and so I came and read. After the reading, [Prof.]
Horace Porter of African and Afro-American studies
said to me: 'Terry, would you ever consider teaching
here?' And I said sure, sort of off the cuff. And to
make a long story short, he followed it up."
McMillan has been on leave from the University of
Arizona for two years, and after all the commotion
from "Waiting to Exhale," she jumped at the chance to
get back into teaching:
"I was going through a very strange period where I
hadn't really started a new book yet and I was really
exhausted with all the hoopla over this last book. I
needed to do something that would ground me in
reality. 1 was thinking that teaching would do that."
With a packed schedule of more interviews and
book tours, McMillan got an offer from Porter to
teach spring quarter — even though it was already
March. She immediately accepted.
With about five years of teaching creative writing
under her belt, McMillan has developed a clear notion
of how her classes should work. She says she strives for
a laid-back atmosphere in her classes, dispensing with
some of the more common instructional methods
found in fiction-writing classes — such as photocopy
ing a student's story, passing it out and having every
one criticize it at home. McMillan staunchly advocates
reading orally, and relying on spontaneous feeling to

drive the class:
"All literature isn't meant to be read out loud, but
you can catch a lot of things that don't work: when it's
phony, when it's forced, if they use too many adverbs
or adjectives or if they use flashback in the beginning,
or too much narrative, or if it's too expository."
And how do the sons and daughters of Stanford
rate as pupils? "The students were a little dead at
first," she says. "Everybody was so serious, and I think
it may have something to do with the place we're in.
They were all out with their little pens ready to take
notes."
Part of that, says McMillan, also may have stemmed
from the notoriety she received from "Exhale," adding
that the media attention might have created an unwel
come distance between her and her students, one that
she has tried to bridge.
"Some [students] wanted to take the workshop, I
think, for the wrong reasons," she says. To the disap
pointment of some of her pupils, she possesses no
magic formula that will transform them into superb
writers:
"There are some students who don't think I have a
magic formula, but some variation of it, so that if they

pay close attention, something will click. I've basically
dispelled all of that shit by letting them know there's
no magic.
"I've tried to get them to understand that there's no
right or wrong thing you can say, and that this is not
literary criticism. I don't deal with a lot of elements
that most people discuss in an English class —
metaphor, symbolism and all that — these students
have already studied that stuff." Indeed, overattention
to device is one of the obstacles McMillan strives to
dismantle.
Finding one's voice, she claims, is the most impor
tant thing a beginning writer can do. Though anyone
can learn the mechanics of writing — by reading
how-to books, attending workshops or simply imitat
ing your favorite author — only honest, personally
involved writing will unearth one's voice:
"There are a lot of good technicians out there. You
can imitate Proust, Hemingway, Faulkner — all these
motherfuckers. And you read enough of them in the
literature classes. But some of it doesn't work any
more. It's not our voice, it's not our time and even the
language is different."
Many young writers focus on some romantic

notion of what being a writer means, says McMillan,
rather than concentrating on the stories that drive
them to write.
"Most of those," says McMillan, "are the ones who
don't have as much talent. Those are the ones who usu
ally are the best technicians, but their stories are usually
flat. The ones who are usually the most ambitious, the
ones who want to be a writer, they're more interested in
being a writer than they are in telling stories."
McMillan's own back-to-the-basics teaching style
may reflect her own voice, one which doesn't restrain
tart language and rarely delights in magic realism,
weirdly shifting points of view or surreal plotting.
"A lot of young writers are preoccupied with sym
bolism," she says with exasperation. "What does the
fence mean? And there's the door closing and open
ing, closing and opening. Who gives a fuck? Open the
door and close the door. What people want is just a
plain old fucking story, where they can identify with
what these people are going through."
McMillan's Zen-like approach extends to her own
day-to-day grind when she's hammering out sen
tences on her computer. Rather than constantly edit
ing herself as she writes, she sometimes writes 100
pages at a stretch before going back and unleashing
the red pen.
"I think it's the most dangerous thing any writer
can do," she says, speaking about the constant pruning
that many writers inflict upon themselves. "You get
more preoccupied with the words on the page than
with the people in the story. The people are more
important, and when you're not thinking about it,
that's when you're writing a lot more honestly. And
that's usually when your voice comes out."
Now that we know all these techniques and
exercises, can we give up that day job and
be the toast of the New York publishing
world? McMillan doesn't think so. "What
it takes to be a good writer is compassion,
and not everybody is all that compassion
ate," she says. "If you only care about yourself — and
you can't really put yourself in somebody's else's
shoes or you don't care to spend the energy — you'll
have a tough time. Part of writing is not being so
self-absorbed. There are some people who can't get
past that."
"Waiting to Exhale" features four pairs of shoes: all
of which are filled by thirtysomething black women
trying to find a. decent man and a decent life apart
from the house, the car and the steady job they already
have.
The language, simple and streetwise, doesn't aim to
be lyrical — but in a world of disastrous dates, out-of
shape lovers and desperate attempts to beat the bio
logical clock, it effectively conveys the desperation and
exasperation many women probably feel.
Desires and conflicts, however, often are too easily
drawn ("Like a fool you acquiesced too soon and gave
up too much. You fell right into the blueprint of his
life and gave up your own") and the men are so straw
filled they simply ask to be kicked in the teeth.
Set in Phoenix, "Exhale" establishes little sense of
place, a common problem in novels that emphasize
long stretches of monologue and dialogue. Lack of
place might explain why some of the scenes in
"Exhale" seem suspended in mid-air, like episodes in a
soap opera. The book is at its best when the scenes
seem grounded, such as at a hair salon where the char
acters converge to chat and have a good time, or at the
small party that the women throw for themselves.
There are no epistemological meditations here, no
themes that shed light on the depths of racism or sex
ism. But with the explosive popularity of "Exhale,"
McMillan tapped a rich vein of readers whose person
al concerns have not, until now, been properly
addressed. But with interviewer after interviewer wild
ly clamoring about her book, McMillan is tired of
talking about "Exhale" and ready to move on:
"After this book, a lot of publishers just woke up

and said, 'Gee whiz, black people do read,' " she says.
"And a lot of people have tried to make it seem that
I'm responsible for this, and I don't like to take credit
for that. I think what publishers were thinking is that
black people don't buy books, so now they are scram
bling, hoping that they can find the next Terry
McMillan or somebody whom they hope can write
contemporary black fiction and whom they can make
a trillion dollars off of."
The millions of which McMillan speaks come with
a price, however. Though vaulted into the stratosphere
of popular fiction and packing in mob-like crowds at
bookstore readings, McMillan hasn't received the kind
of critical applause that surround writers such as Toni
Morrison and Alice Walker, whose works tend to be
less commercial and less widely read by black audi-

'What does the fence
mean? And there's
the door closing
and opening,closing
and opening. Who
gives a fuck?'

ences. In addition, McMillan has noted that Morrison
and Walker have been fairly indifferent towards her
work.
Calling McMillan "a mediocre novelist whose work
is consecrated to the spirits of women and blacks," the
New Republic and other critics disparage her work as
being dialogue-driven and populated with simple
characters. Some have even called McMillan, without
rancor, "the black Judith Krantz."
"That really pisses me off," McMillan says."The
attitude is: since so many people are reading it, it can't
be serious or it can't be that good.
"A lot of black people can't read Alice Walker or
Toni Morrison, because they don't understand what
they're trying to say. That's not to take away from how
they write, because I think they're brilliant writers,
particularly Toni," she says.
"I'll put it this way: their work is intimidating for a
lot of black people. There's a lot of things going on in
these stories that's just not touching their world.
Magic realism? It's not happening in the projects nor
in the 'hood. If they want to be carried away, they
want to be carried away to a place that at least is
familiar."
Though professional respect is an important issue
for McMillan, as it would be for anyone in the high
brow world of fiction, she feels she gets her respect,
and from an audience she is proud to have. "I am no
Judith Krantz," she says firmly. "They're not studying

be serious or it can't be that good.
"A lot of black people can't read Alice Walker or
Toni Morrison, because they don't understand what
they're trying to say. That's not to take away from how
they write, because I think they're brilliant writers,
particularly Toni," she says.
"I'll put it this way: their work is intimidating for a
lot of black people. There's a lot of things going on in
these stories that's just not touching their world.
Magic realism? It's not happening in the projects nor
in the 'hood. If they want to be carried away, they
want to be carried away to a place that at least is
familiar."
Though professional respect is an important issue
for McMillan, as it would be for anyone in the high
brow world of fiction, she feels she gets her respect,
and from an audience she is proud to have. "I am no
Judith Krantz," she says firmly. "They're not studying
Judith Krantz in Berkeley or other major universities.
Critics can label me anything they want, but the bot
tom line is that the people who read me take me seri
ously. And you do get punished when you sell a lot of
books. There's a price you pay.
"I'll take the high-school-dropout reader who is
affected by my story any day. I'll take a million of
those, more than 5,000 who expect something else.
I've done thousands of readings with thousands of
people that say, '1 haven't read a book in years,' or
'This is the first book I've ever finished,' or even 'This
is the first book I've ever read' — and that means
something to me. That means more to me than what
critics say... a whole lot more." ■
