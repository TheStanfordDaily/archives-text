Infamous NC-17
adds no depth to
shallow romance

Wide Sargasso Sea

WARNING: The sexual activity in this
film will not revolutionize your nocturnal
practices. And don't get fooled by the NC-17
rating, since it stems from a three-second
shot of a man's penis — another example of
the hypocritical mentality that dominates the
Motion Picture Association ratings board.
That said, "Wide Sargasso Sea" is a shal
low film that never traps us in its story. Like
the Jean Rhys novel it's based on, it explains
how Mrs. Rochester from Charlotte Bronte's
"Jane Eyre" ended up in the attic. Unfortu
nately, shoddy scripting and over-the-top
direction should drag this flick to the bot
tom of the box-office ocean.
Set in tropical 1840s Jamaica, "Sargasso"
dooms itself from the start with its credits se
quence — cheesy underwater shots of long
strands of seaweed that look as though they

were filmed through a kaleidoscope (the title
refers to seaweed that frequently trapped
and drowned divers in the Atlantic Ocean).
Antoinette Cosway (Karina Lombard) is
raised in a convent after some "lazy" black
workers get off their butts and burn down
her mother's plantation, driving poor mom
insane. When she comes of age, her step
uncle marries her off to Rochester
(Nathaniel Parker), a bloodless Englishman
that she's never met.
At first, the marriage seems to be made in

travelogue heaven. As uptight as Rochester
may seem, he loosens up considerably at
night, quickly introducing Antoinette to the
joys of soft-focus missionary sex. But her
family secrets, Rochester's inability to adapt
to Jamaican life and their insolently seduc
tive maid (Rowena King) conspire to destroy
their happiness.
Sadly, once the Cosway plantation is
burned to the ground, any hopes of a well
told story go up in smoke along with it. Di
rector John Duigan ("Flirting") overly ob
sesses with the Gothic nature of the source
novel, packing it with symbols and portents
— like the family parrot trying to take flight
while ablaze, only to come crashing down to
earth.
This pseudo-powerful symbolism re
places character development, to little effect.
Despite a relatively short running time of
100 minutes, the film seems to drag on inter
minably. Yet we never understand why An
toinette desperately tries to save her mar
riage — and Lombard's obvious lack of act
ing experience doesn't help.
Duigan attempts to sketch their relation
ship through several sex scenes, ranging
from timid exploration to cruel violence.
But viewers will have to play "connect-the
dots" to find any emotional resonance—the
actors don't seem to enjoy their overly
choreographed naked thrashings. When
Rochester urges Antoinette to "Die, die, die,"
at the height of his orgasm, we wonder if the
actor isn't speaking directly to the three
screenwriters who've put him through this
torture.
There are countless beautiful shots of the
Jamaican scenery, but cinematographer
Geoff Burton hasn't got a clue when it comes
to lighting the many black actors, giving all
of them the same ugly, overexposed look.
Former member of "The Police" Stewart
Copeland, like Duigan, eschews all subtlety

with a score reminiscent of Vangelis at his
pompous worst.
Curl up in bed with the book — and a
good friend.

Unlike Glengarry,
Yonkers doesn't
survive on stage

Lost In Yonkers

Ce».. plays work better on Masterpiece
Theater. "Death of a Salesman," for in
stance, will never overwhelm the box office;
Schwarzenegger would make an atrocious
Willy Loman.
Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers" is one of
those plays. Although the performances are
powerful, the production loses its punch
when taken off the stage and put on the
screen.
Even on Broadway, this wasn't one of Neil
Simon's best works. Yes, it did garner him
his only Pulitzer, but the characters aren't as
subtly shaded as those in "Brighton Beach
Memoirs," the plot isn't as gripping as
"Barefoot in the Park" and the lines aren't as
funny as "The Odd Couple."
The story, told in "Wonder Years" format
from the point of view of two teenage boys,
concerns itself with a dysfunctional Jewish
family during World War 11.
The two boys are sent to live with their
grandmother while their father becomes a
travelling scrap-iron salesman, in order to
pay for his dead wife's hospital bills. In the
play, this sappy opening became one of its
most gripping scenes, as the family mem
bers build up the formidable Grandma Kur

nitz — an iron-tough German emigre who
could have scared Hitler out of Czechoslo
vakia — for almost 30 minutes before she
makes her entrance.
In the movie, the audience only has to
wait about 15 minutes, and the suspense is
mostly lost. From there, the wild, wacky and
always disturbed members of the extended
family permanently impinge upon these
boys' lives.
The acting is just as superb as it was in the
Broadway play, as the original cast has re
turned virtually intact. Irene Worth recreates
the incredible level of empathy which won
her a Tony Award for portraying the unlik
able Grandma Kurnitz in New York. Mer
cedes Ruehl, as the emotionally-retarded
Aunt Bella, performs a difficult part with as
much energy and pathos as she did in the
play.
Richard Dreyfuss, the lone newcomer,
adds a dimension of energy and spectacle to
Uncle Louie which almost succeeds in tak
ing the movie out of the play and into the
world of Hollywood.
But although Uncle Louie's role has
been expanded from the play, Dryfuss isn't
on screen long enough to save it. The
movie never escapes the stage, so what was
good on Broadway becomes touching, but
boring. Jokes that were once passable fall
flat in the movie theater; Aunt Gertie's
overplayed habit of sucking in the second
half of her sentences — merely annoying in
the play — is almost offensive in the movie
version.
The melodrama of "Lost in Yonkers" is
saved only through Simon's honesty and di
rectness. And by separating the actors from
the audience through a movie screen, he
loses the benefit of the doubt. "Lost in
Yonkers" simply isn't a cinematic experi
ence. Catch it on cable.

'Harry Met Sally'
clone won't meet
too much success

The Night We Never Met

"The Night We Never Met" could have
been funny. It could have been a searing
drama about prejudgement, or an insightful
look of how much our belongings define us.
Instead, it's a stereotype-ridden, half-devel
oped, marginally funny movie.
Brian (Kevin Anderson) is getting married
and has to give up his bachelor pad. Then he
hits on the brilliant idea of retaining it two

nights a week, and sub-letting it the other five
nights to two other tenants. Enter Sam (Math
ew Broderick), the Sensitive Cook, and Ellen
(Annabella Sciorra), the Unhappy Housewife
Seeking To Rejuvenate Her Marriage.
Ellen and Sam, who never meet, fall "in
love" after she eats his scrumptious leftovers
and he views her romantic oil paintings.
Only, Ellen thinks Brian is Sam, and when
she sleeps with the chauvinist slob, well, you
know the rest.
Potential for comedy — yes. Delivery —
no. Brian, the frat-boy-unable-to-handle
commitment-to-his-conservative-fianc£
stereotype gone mad, tells Ellen after they
make love, "You're a great fuck. Don't cry,
honey, it's true."
Like Brian, Ellen's problems are straight
from the textbook: when she tries to create a

romantic evening at the shared flat, her hus
band is unresponsive. And it's later revealed
that she is a 29-year-old married virgin, a
strange fact that goes completely unmen
tioned throughout the rest of the film.
Only through Broderick does the movie
have any character. He makes fun of the
spoiled patrons of the cheese shop where he
works, and in one scene wishes for a fling
with a Norwegian tourist — and guess who
bumps into him carrying a map.
In another, his ex-girlfriend Pastel — a
performance artist with an unidentifiable ac
cent (the sexy Jeanne Tripplehorn) — se
duces Sam, only to push him away, ripping
off her shirt and saying, "Please, don't make
this any harder for us."
"The Night We Never Met" is advertised
the next "When Harry Met Sally." But unlike

that classic couple, the basis for Sam and
Ellen's love is tenuous at best — they've never
even spoken.
And though director Warren Leight tries
to make New York the idyllic place it was in
"Harry and Sally," it just turns into a bizarre
diorama in which to place stuck-up women,
weirdos and nudists who crash at Sam's
apartment.
This could make a great HBO movie in the
summer, when everyone has slight heat
stroke. Its laughs should go over better when
the audience has a lemonade sugar-high and
the viewing alternatives are "Lost in Space"
and "Body By Jake."
Barring those circumstances, however,
make sure you never meet "The Night We
Never Met."
