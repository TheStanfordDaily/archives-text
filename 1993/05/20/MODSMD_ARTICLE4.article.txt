# Poisonous gas leak clean-up finshed

### Urmimala Sarkar Staff writer 
An abandoned cylinder leaking poiso
nous gas near the old Chemistry Building
was finally removed last nignt, after a
complicated three-day clean-up process.
A passer-by observed a brown gas leak
ing from a metal cannister around 11:30
a.m. Monday, according to Assoc. Direc
tor of Environmental Health and Safety
Harvey Chock.
Chock said personnel from his depart
ment arrived "within 15-20 minutes" and
found a poisonous substance called nitro
gen tetroxide escaping from the canister.
The gas leaked through a faulty valve
because the sun's heat had raised the cylin
der's contents well above its boiling point
of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, increasing the
pressure within the cylinder, he added.
The department "could not stopper
the leaky valve," Chock said, but they at
tempted to reduce the temperature by

placing ice and cold towels around the
cylinder.
Because the department "is not
equipped to deal with this type of situa
tion," Chock said University safety offi
cials immediately contacted a Hayward
based firm that "specializes in managing
pressed-gas cylinders."
Workers from California Advanced En
vironmental Technology corporation ar
rived at 9:30 p.m. and sealed the valve. The
technicians then began to transfer the
cooled liquid out of the cylinder and neu
tralize it with a solution of sodium hydrox
ide — commonly known as lye — in water.
They secured the cylinder and completed
the neutralization process last night.
The staff used gas masks and monitors
to check gas levels when dealing with the
materials, according to AETC regional
manager Mike Murphy.
The leak — which was contained with
in a fenced-off area — posed little threat
to passers-by, Chocjc said. Monitors

"weren't picking up anything but trace
amounts of material outside a 15-foot ra
dius," he said, which was well inside the
fence. He added that "less than a pound of
gaseous material" escaped.
"If it had to |leak| anywhere, it was in
a good place," Murphy said, referring to
the open space that allowed the gas to dis
sipate.
The team waited to deal with the ma
terials until the "foot traffic in the area"
was minimized, Chock said, and Murphy
noted that cooler nighttime temperatures
made the substance easier to handle.
Chock could not explain where the
cylinder came from or whom it belonged
to. According to Murphy, "the cylinder
showed obvious signs of use," and only
five gallons remained in the 30-gallon
tank when the technicians arrived.
Chock and Murphy surmise that the
container was already close to empty
when it was abandoned. No injuries or
damages were reported.
