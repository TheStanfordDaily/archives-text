Janet goes for a
new look, keeps
same tired sound

Janet Jackson

Janet Jackson's belly button did nothing
for me.
Not that her "inny" is unattractive — it's
very adorable... especially on the back cover
of her latest release "Janet." It compliments
the album's front cover: an attractive close
up of the Nubian Princess of Pop, with a head
full of bouncy girlish curls.
Cute.
Ditto for the album. That's really too bad,
since the first single off the album, "That's
the Way Love Goes," is a pleaser. One part
James Brown, two parts Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis, and the rest Miss Jackson's light
vocals, the track supposedly heralds the ar
rival of a provocative, more sexually alluring
black woman for the '90s.
But that enchanting sister never gets off
the IRT — we get variations on the same ol'
crackers from '89 instead. Weighing in at 27
tracks — roughly 12 tunes — Jackson's
fourth effort feels like a "couples" ride at an
amusement park, and that's no compliment.
Each ditty only does what it's supposed to.
Dance songs like "You Want This" and "Be
cause of Love," are suitable for rump-shakin',
while slower numbers like "The Body That
Loves You," can underscore more intimate

moments. But why bother when 20 to 30 other
albums in your collection make you wanna
zoom-a-zoom-zoom longer and stronger.
Even though the soulfully folksy "What'll
I Do" and the techno-influenced "Throb"
yield some of the album's better listens, too
many tracks cling to the status quo. An artist
of Jackson's staying power and commercial
appeal should innovate more than she does
on this album.
As for sex appeal, belly buttons and half
unzipped jeans might whip her adolescent
fans into a sexual frenzy, but it's a borderline
insult for anyone else. What's more, Jackson's
concept of erotica as expressed in the upbeat
"If" and the slow jam "Any Time, Any Place"

seem more intent on shock than titillation.
Either way, her lack of sincerity is blatant.
In "If," she propositions, "If you like, I'll
go down da down down down da down
down/ I'll hold you in my hand and baby
your smooth and shiny feels good against my
lips, sugar."
On "Any Time, Any Place" she declares, "I
can feel your hands moving up my thighs/
skirt around my waist, wall against my
face... I don't wanna stop just because peo
ple walkin' by are watchin' us... I want you
now."
Sure you do, Janny-baby.
While no one's expecting Jackson to pose
spread-eagled or bare-chested, mature and

intelligent listeners will hope for something
other than the moan fests on her last two al
bums. Save the silly kid's-stuff for Shanice...
and the lyrics too.

The kings of rap
from Queens are
making a return

Run D.M.C.

Run D.M.C. is back. But it wasn't easy.
Their last album bombed. Joey Simmons
was charged with rape. Darryl McDaniels'
liquid diet of eight 40 ounces of malt liquor a
day put him in the hospital with diabetes.
And Jason Mizell just disappeared from the
rap scene.
Still, that isn't anything a top-notch
lawyer, a couple of skilled doctors and a team
of hip-hop's best producers can't cure. Lyrical
masters D.J. Run and D.M.C., along with
super-DJ Jam Master Jay come back strapped
with phat tracks that recall their glory days.
Run D.M.C.'s latest, "Down With The King,"
effectively recreates the urban sound and
crossover appeal that made them the hypest
hip-hoppers on the East Coast. But they've
changed up their image. Gone are the top hats,
gold chains, track suits and unlaced Adidas
sneakers that were their trademarks. Now the
trio sports shaved heads, black threads and
combat boots — but they still deliver hype
lyrics with a hard-core feel, backed by the vinyl
spinning wizardry of Jam Master Jay.
The Pete Rock-produced title track pays
tribute to God, who the group believes got
them through the recent hard times and their
10- year hip-hop career. A sample of "Where
Do I Go" from the musical "Hair" is support
ed by keyboards, dope percussion and guest
raps by both CL Smooth and Pete Rock. But
the kicker is an added sample from "Run's
House" — a Run D.M.C. classic.
"Can I Get It, Yo" — produced by the
now-defunct EPMD — has an overwhelm
ing bass line that could blow your speakers,
and powerful raps that will keep your head
bobbing up and down at the crib — or force
you to jump around on the dance floor. This
ultimate house-party song will surely get shy
suckers off the wall to freak any female in
their vicinity.

The most well-adjusted Jackson, Janet, prepares to light up the music world like a
newly-activated jheri-curl with her fourth album, "Janet."
"Get Open" is a pure hip-hop jam that
innovates on a jazz tip. With help of hot rap
group Onyx, they deliver rapid lyrics with
precision and style, showing a positive pro
gression of rap from the tired world of
eight-balls gangsta-bitches and drive-bys.
It ain't yet Christmas time in Hollis,
Queens — this isn't their best album. But
Run D.M.C. has cooked a solid release that
will complete the comeback of one of hip
hop's first and greatest acts.

Rap debut places
lyrical skills over
hype of hardcore

Freestyle Fellowship

Even at their worst, there's something
refreshing about Freestyle Fellowship's brand
of hip-hop that lifts them head and shoulders
above many of their b-boy contemporaries.
And that something makes their recent
release, "Innercity Griots," one of the most
eagerly anticipated debuts of the season.
The reason for the hype is simple. Long
before Fellowship was signed to Island,
group members Mikah Nine, Aceyalone,
Mtulazajl. PeAce and Self Jupiter were busy
blowin* minds and raisin' cain in L.A.'s
underground venues with a crowd-pleasing
mixture of vertiginous rhymes, live instru
mentation and a new school sound reveling
in old-school conventions.
But does the album live up to the myth?
Not in a manner that most enthusiasts
would imagine. Although the puzzle's
pieces are all present and accounted for,
commercial aesthetics are virtually ignored
for large chunks of the album — particular
ly the first half.
"Innercity Griots" explodes from the start
ing blocks with surprising moxie on "Blood,"
a rousing a cappella rhyme that hits with the
force and conviction of a Southern baptist
orator. .. until we realize that the lone,
anonymous rapper isn't really calling for a
confession of sins in exchange for the right
hand of fellowship, but a union with the beat.
The bass-driven "Bullies of the Block,"
with it's four frenzied lyrical intros, follows
suit convincingly, but in between the coun
trified-funk and light-hearted misogyny (if
that's possible) of "Shammy" and the ultra
violent phantasmagoria of "Six Tray," we
feel as if we've been submerged in a goulash
of over-indulgent narcissism, complete with
lyrics that only the rappers understand and
odd loops that we couldn't care less about.
But just when it all seems unbearable,
Fellowship drags us away from the light at
the end of the tunnel with the '84-ish
"Cornbread," the pleasantly alternative
"Hot Potato" and the live jazz tracks "Inner
City Boundaries" and "Park Bench People."
The two jazz tracks alone make
"Innercity Griots," a must for any hip-hop
collection. In one fell swoop, these cats
bridge the gap between the jazz "vocalese" of
singers such as King Pleasure, Jon Hendrix
and more recently Bobby McFerrin, con

necting it with rap's readily acknowledged
forefathers, the Last Poets, Gill Scott Heron,
etc. What's more, they make the Brand New
Heavies, "Heavy Rhyme Experience" and
several other jazz/rap contenders, look
downright sophomoric.
You won't find the next "Hip-Hop
Hooray" on "Innercity Griots." But
Freestyle Fellowship is a reaffirmation —
cross-hairs, ill-tempered happy faces, chain
saws and flamethrowers notwithstanding —

that hip-hop has always been about four or
five brothas standing on a corner trading
impromptu "hood-stories" that rhyme.

Farrell breaks his
addiction to Jane
with a new band

Porno for Pyros

Thought you heard a new Jane's song on
the radio? Don't be fooled. For the still clue
less, the former lead singer of Jane's
Addiction, Perry Farrell's got a new band.
Same grooves, same punk, same attitude,
different name: Porno for Pyros. Actually
inspired, if you will, by a firework flyer
tucked away in an S & M mag, the name
itself soon became a double entendre —
the group announced their existence just as
the Los Angeles riots ignited.
In fact, much of the self-titled album res
onates with the fviry and frustration evoked
by the crude home-video footage and the
controversial Simi Valley verdict. "Packin'
25," an exploration of the vigilante mindset,
starts with a cat-like twang of the bass

strings and eases into a mellow verse, before
crescendoing to a funky, guitar-riddled cho
rus and Farrell's distinctive screaming.
Spanish guitar riffs and a simple bass line
give the song a predatory feel as Farrell's
grainy wail sings of putting a gun in a man's
face, crooning, "show respect to me/1 don't
care what you're thinkin'/ I'll wipe that
thought away."
While "Packin' 25" asks, "why not be the
hero?" "Black Girlfriend" tries to resolve

urban tensions in Farrell's somewhat twist
ed, black-fetish way. A slow but playful bass
line underlies a crawling guitar, while
Farrell fantasizes about going with a girl
from the 'hood.
As "Black Girlfriend" breaks into a har
monica-driven funk bridge, Farrell flaunts
their relationship, boldly taunting, "people on
the corner and in the crowd wanna do me in
'cause I won't give back that little black girl."
Singles already in heavy rotation on Live
105, such as "Porno for Pyros," "Pets" and
"Cursed Male," suggest that the new group
will have no trouble pushing songs up the
charts. And a solid debut album with sever
al strong tracks (i.e. "Packin* 25," "Orgasm,"
"Black Girlfriend") guarantees their success.
Porno for Pyros' psychedelic, funk
infused punk strays very little from the
sound that jettisoned Jane's Addiction into
stardom and Farrell into rock legend.
Though Jane's did split up, fans may rejoice
at the similarities between the bands.
Only taking drummer Stephen Perkins
with him, Farrell enlisted bassist Martyn Le
Noble (formerly of Thelonious Monster)
and guitarist Peter DiStefano to complete
Porno for Pyros.
One can only conclude that Farrell lent
Jane's more than just his unique vocal style.

It's a Jazz Thang
from Deep South
to way up North

SNIPPETS

Various Artists: Deep Blues
"Deep Blues" is small-club, down-home,
deep-fried, emotion-filled food for the soul.
All the tracks were cut on a single take —
recorded live either at small clubs and
lounges or at the artists homes.
This isn't a George Thurougood blues
album. It's pure and untainted. Tracks like
"Jumper On The Line" and "Long Haired
Doney" are more like Muddy Waters and
8.8. King — the kind of blues that gets
played in clubs, not on the radio. So if you
like the smokey atmosphere, and musical
play that are a part of deep blues, then sit
back, close your eyes and go for a little trip
to where the blues was born.

Marlon Jordan: The Undaunted
Young jazz trumpeter Marlon Jordan has
created a fast-paced album with his latest
release "The Undaunted." It has a classy feel
to it — it's lyrical, somber and reflective,
without being slow or sad. For those who
enjoy a smoother style of jazz, more like
early Miles Davis, this release won't do.
Although tracks like "Village Blues" are
calm throughout, most break away into
loose improvisation, with a lot of quick
scaling trumpet and piano to it.
The strongest member of the ensemble,
after Jordan, is Eric Reed. His work stands
out enough to give the album a dual trum
pet and piano focus, a successful feat with
Jordan's boisterous playing. On "That's
Gone," he even overshadows Jordan when
his classy improvisation takes over the
backbone of the song. With the soul of the
album in New Orleans — where Jordan
received his training — and its body in
New York — where he learned modern
experimentation — "The Undaunted" is
worthy of a place in all jazz collections.
■
Rachel Z: Trust The Universe
Rachel Z has more going for her than
just her name. She's a talented and attrac
tive pianist who's just released her first
album, "Trust the Universe." Her smooth,
contemporary jazz differentiates itself from
other releases by resisting the kitschy pop
influence found on many "easy
listening/Kenny G" releases.
"Trust the Universe" is true jazz with an
unmistakably modern feel — the perfect
album for a candle-light rendezvous. The
first track, "Nardis," has a haunting melody
that seduces the listener with a delicate
piano and mirrored bass work.
Another noteworthy track, "Monk's
Other Woman," strays a bit from the rest
of the album — it's minor blues mimicry
of Thelonious Monk's jazz style. With a
very controlled, melodic piano and lots of
saxophone, Rachel Z produces a relaxing
work that uses interesting contemporary
elements to create a unique body of
music.

The kings of rap
from Queens are
making a return

Run D.M.C.

Run D.M.C. is back. But it wasn't easy.
Their last album bombed. Joey Simmons
was charged with rape. Darryl McDaniels'
liquid diet of eight 40 ounces of malt liquor a
day put him in the hospital with diabetes.
And Jason Mizell just disappeared from the
rap scene.
Still, that isn't anything a top-notch
lawyer, a couple of skilled doctors and a team
of hip-hop's best producers can't cure. Lyrical
masters D.J. Run and D.M.C., along with
super-DJ Jam Master Jay come back strapped
with phat tracks that recall their glory days.
Run D.M.C.'s latest, "Down With The King,"
effectively recreates the urban sound and
crossover appeal that made them the hypest
hip-hoppers on the East Coast. But they've
changed up their image. Gone are the top hats,
gold chains, track suits and unlaced Adidas
sneakers that were their trademarks. Now the
trio sports shaved heads, black threads and
combat boots — but they still deliver hype
lyrics with a hard-core feel, backed by the vinyl
spinning wizardry of Jam Master Jay.
The Pete Rock-produced title track pays
tribute to God, who the group believes got
them through the recent hard times and their
10- year hip-hop career. A sample of "Where
Do I Go" from the musical "Hair" is support
ed by keyboards, dope percussion and guest
raps by both CL Smooth and Pete Rock. But
the kicker is an added sample from "Run's
House" — a Run D.M.C. classic.
"Can I Get It, Yo" — produced by the
now-defunct EPMD — has an overwhelm
ing bass line that could blow your speakers,
and powerful raps that will keep your head
bobbing up and down at the crib — or force
you to jump around on the dance floor. This
ultimate house-party song will surely get shy
suckers off the wall to freak any female in
their vicinity.

The most well-adjusted Jackson, Janet, prepares to light up the music world like a
newly-activated jheri-curl with her fourth album, "Janet."
"Get Open" is a pure hip-hop jam that
innovates on a jazz tip. With help of hot rap
group Onyx, they deliver rapid lyrics with
precision and style, showing a positive pro
gression of rap from the tired world of
eight-balls gangsta-bitches and drive-bys.
It ain't yet Christmas time in Hollis,
Queens — this isn't their best album. But
Run D.M.C. has cooked a solid release that

Rap debut places
lyrical skills over
hype of hardcore

Freestyle Fellowship

Even at their worst, there's something
refreshing about Freestyle Fellowship's brand
of hip-hop that lifts them head and shoulders
above many of their b-boy contemporaries.
And that something makes their recent
release, "Innercity Griots," one of the most
eagerly anticipated debuts of the season.
The reason for the hype is simple. Long
before Fellowship was signed to Island,
group members Mikah Nine, Aceyalone,
Mtulazajl. PeAce and Self Jupiter were busy
blowin* minds and raisin' cain in L.A.'s
underground venues with a crowd-pleasing
mixture of vertiginous rhymes, live instru
mentation and a new school sound reveling
in old-school conventions.
But does the album live up to the myth?
Not in a manner that most enthusiasts
would imagine. Although the puzzle's
pieces are all present and accounted for,
commercial aesthetics are virtually ignored
for large chunks of the album — particular
ly the first half.
"Innercity Griots" explodes from the start
ing blocks with surprising moxie on "Blood,"
a rousing a cappella rhyme that hits with the
force and conviction of a Southern baptist
orator. .. until we realize that the lone,
anonymous rapper isn't really calling for a
confession of sins in exchange for the right
hand of fellowship, but a union with the beat.
The bass-driven "Bullies of the Block,"
with it's four frenzied lyrical intros, follows
suit convincingly, but in between the coun
trified-funk and light-hearted misogyny (if
that's possible) of "Shammy" and the ultra
violent phantasmagoria of "Six Tray," we
feel as if we've been submerged in a goulash
of over-indulgent narcissism, complete with
lyrics that only the rappers understand and
odd loops that we couldn't care less about.
But just when it all seems unbearable,
Fellowship drags us away from the light at
the end of the tunnel with the '84-ish
"Cornbread," the pleasantly alternative
"Hot Potato" and the live jazz tracks "Inner
City Boundaries" and "Park Bench People."
The two jazz tracks alone make
"Innercity Griots," a must for any hip-hop
collection. In one fell swoop, these cats
bridge the gap between the jazz "vocalese" of
singers such as King Pleasure, Jon Hendrix
and more recently Bobby McFerrin, con

necting it with rap's readily acknowledged
forefathers, the Last Poets, Gill Scott Heron,
etc. What's more, they make the Brand New
Heavies, "Heavy Rhyme Experience" and
several other jazz/rap contenders, look
downright sophomoric.
You won't find the next "Hip-Hop
Hooray" on "Innercity Griots." But
Freestyle Fellowship is a reaffirmation —
cross-hairs, ill-tempered happy faces, chain
saws and flamethrowers notwithstanding —

that hip-hop has always been about four or
five brothas standing on a corner trading
impromptu "hood-stories" that rhyme.

Farrell breaks his
addiction to Jane
with a new band

Porno for Pyros

Thought you heard a new Jane's song on
the radio? Don't be fooled. For the still clue
less, the former lead singer of Jane's
Addiction, Perry Farrell's got a new band.
Same grooves, same punk, same attitude,
different name: Porno for Pyros. Actually
inspired, if you will, by a firework flyer
tucked away in an S & M mag, the name
itself soon became a double entendre —
the group announced their existence just as
the Los Angeles riots ignited.
In fact, much of the self-titled album res
onates with the fviry and frustration evoked
by the crude home-video footage and the
controversial Simi Valley verdict. "Packin'
25," an exploration of the vigilante mindset,
starts with a cat-like twang of the bass

strings and eases into a mellow verse, before
crescendoing to a funky, guitar-riddled cho
rus and Farrell's distinctive screaming.
Spanish guitar riffs and a simple bass line
give the song a predatory feel as Farrell's
grainy wail sings of putting a gun in a man's
face, crooning, "show respect to me/1 don't
care what you're thinkin'/ I'll wipe that
thought away."
While "Packin' 25" asks, "why not be the
hero?" "Black Girlfriend" tries to resolve

urban tensions in Farrell's somewhat twist
ed, black-fetish way. A slow but playful bass
line underlies a crawling guitar, while
Farrell fantasizes about going with a girl
from the 'hood.
As "Black Girlfriend" breaks into a har
monica-driven funk bridge, Farrell flaunts
their relationship, boldly taunting, "people on
the corner and in the crowd wanna do me in
'cause I won't give back that little black girl."
Singles already in heavy rotation on Live
105, such as "Porno for Pyros," "Pets" and
"Cursed Male," suggest that the new group
will have no trouble pushing songs up the
charts. And a solid debut album with sever
al strong tracks (i.e. "Packin* 25," "Orgasm,"
"Black Girlfriend") guarantees their success.
Porno for Pyros' psychedelic, funk
infused punk strays very little from the
sound that jettisoned Jane's Addiction into
stardom and Farrell into rock legend.
Though Jane's did split up, fans may rejoice
at the similarities between the bands.
Only taking drummer Stephen Perkins
with him, Farrell enlisted bassist Martyn Le
Noble (formerly of Thelonious Monster)
and guitarist Peter DiStefano to complete
Porno for Pyros.
One can only conclude that Farrell lent
Jane's more than just his unique vocal style.

It's a Jazz Thang
from Deep South
to way up North

SNIPPETS

Various Artists: Deep Blues
"Deep Blues" is small-club, down-home,
deep-fried, emotion-filled food for the soul.
All the tracks were cut on a single take —
recorded live either at small clubs and
lounges or at the artists homes.
This isn't a George Thurougood blues
album. It's pure and untainted. Tracks like
"Jumper On The Line" and "Long Haired
Doney" are more like Muddy Waters and
8.8. King — the kind of blues that gets
played in clubs, not on the radio. So if you
like the smokey atmosphere, and musical
play that are a part of deep blues, then sit
back, close your eyes and go for a little trip
to where the blues was born.

Marlon Jordan: The Undaunted
Young jazz trumpeter Marlon Jordan has
created a fast-paced album with his latest
release "The Undaunted." It has a classy feel
to it — it's lyrical, somber and reflective,
without being slow or sad. For those who
enjoy a smoother style of jazz, more like
early Miles Davis, this release won't do.
Although tracks like "Village Blues" are
calm throughout, most break away into
loose improvisation, with a lot of quick
scaling trumpet and piano to it.
The strongest member of the ensemble,
after Jordan, is Eric Reed. His work stands
out enough to give the album a dual trum
pet and piano focus, a successful feat with
Jordan's boisterous playing. On "That's
Gone," he even overshadows Jordan when
his classy improvisation takes over the
backbone of the song. With the soul of the
album in New Orleans — where Jordan
received his training — and its body in
New York — where he learned modern
experimentation — "The Undaunted" is
worthy of a place in all jazz collections.
■
Rachel Z: Trust The Universe
Rachel Z has more going for her than
just her name. She's a talented and attrac
tive pianist who's just released her first
album, "Trust the Universe." Her smooth,
contemporary jazz differentiates itself from
other releases by resisting the kitschy pop
influence found on many "easy
listening/Kenny G" releases.
"Trust the Universe" is true jazz with an
unmistakably modern feel — the perfect
album for a candle-light rendezvous. The
first track, "Nardis," has a haunting melody
that seduces the listener with a delicate
piano and mirrored bass work.
Another noteworthy track, "Monk's
Other Woman," strays a bit from the rest
of the album — it's minor blues mimicry
of Thelonious Monk's jazz style. With a
very controlled, melodic piano and lots of
saxophone, Rachel Z produces a relaxing
work that uses interesting contemporary
elements to create a unique body of
music.

Janet goes for a
new look, keeps
same tired sound

Janet Jackson

Janet Jackson's belly button did nothing
for me.
Not that her "inny" is unattractive — it's
very adorable... especially on the back cover
of her latest release "Janet." It compliments
the album's front cover: an attractive close
up of the Nubian Princess of Pop, with a head
full of bouncy girlish curls.
Cute.
Ditto for the album. That's really too bad,
since the first single off the album, "That's
the Way Love Goes," is a pleaser. One part
James Brown, two parts Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis, and the rest Miss Jackson's light
vocals, the track supposedly heralds the ar
rival of a provocative, more sexually alluring
black woman for the '90s.
But that enchanting sister never gets off
the IRT — we get variations on the same ol'
crackers from '89 instead. Weighing in at 27
tracks — roughly 12 tunes — Jackson's
fourth effort feels like a "couples" ride at an
amusement park, and that's no compliment.
Each ditty only does what it's supposed to.
Dance songs like "You Want This" and "Be
cause of Love," are suitable for rump-shakin',
while slower numbers like "The Body That
Loves You," can underscore more intimate

moments. But why bother when 20 to 30 other
albums in your collection make you wanna
zoom-a-zoom-zoom longer and stronger.
Even though the soulfully folksy "What'll
I Do" and the techno-influenced "Throb"
yield some of the album's better listens, too
many tracks cling to the status quo. An artist
of Jackson's staying power and commercial
appeal should innovate more than she does
on this album.
As for sex appeal, belly buttons and half
unzipped jeans might whip her adolescent
fans into a sexual frenzy, but it's a borderline
insult for anyone else. What's more, Jackson's
concept of erotica as expressed in the upbeat
"If" and the slow jam "Any Time, Any Place"

seem more intent on shock than titillation.
Either way, her lack of sincerity is blatant.
In "If," she propositions, "If you like, I'll
go down da down down down da down
down/ I'll hold you in my hand and baby
your smooth and shiny feels good against my
lips, sugar."
On "Any Time, Any Place" she declares, "I
can feel your hands moving up my thighs/
skirt around my waist, wall against my
face... I don't wanna stop just because peo
ple walkin' by are watchin' us... I want you
now."
Sure you do, Janny-baby.
While no one's expecting Jackson to pose
spread-eagled or bare-chested, mature and

intelligent listeners will hope for something

innovates on a jazz tip. With help of hot rap
group Onyx, they deliver rapid lyrics with
precision and style, showing a positive pro
gression of rap from the tired world of
eight-balls gangsta-bitches and drive-bys.
It ain't yet Christmas time in Hollis,
Queens — this isn't their best album. But
Run D.M.C. has cooked a solid release that
will complete the comeback of one of hip
hop's first and greatest acts.

Rap debut places
lyrical skills over
hype of hardcore

Freestyle Fellowship

Even at their worst, there's something
refreshing about Freestyle Fellowship's brand
of hip-hop that lifts them head and shoulders
above many of their b-boy contemporaries.
And that something makes their recent
release, "Innercity Griots," one of the most
eagerly anticipated debuts of the season.
The reason for the hype is simple. Long
before Fellowship was signed to Island,
group members Mikah Nine, Aceyalone,
Mtulazajl. PeAce and Self Jupiter were busy
blowin* minds and raisin' cain in L.A.'s
underground venues with a crowd-pleasing
mixture of vertiginous rhymes, live instru
mentation and a new school sound reveling
in old-school conventions.
But does the album live up to the myth?
Not in a manner that most enthusiasts
would imagine. Although the puzzle's
pieces are all present and accounted for,
commercial aesthetics are virtually ignored
for large chunks of the album — particular
ly the first half.
"Innercity Griots" explodes from the start
ing blocks with surprising moxie on "Blood,"
a rousing a cappella rhyme that hits with the
force and conviction of a Southern baptist
orator. .. until we realize that the lone,
anonymous rapper isn't really calling for a
confession of sins in exchange for the right
hand of fellowship, but a union with the beat.
The bass-driven "Bullies of the Block,"
with it's four frenzied lyrical intros, follows
suit convincingly, but in between the coun
trified-funk and light-hearted misogyny (if
that's possible) of "Shammy" and the ultra
violent phantasmagoria of "Six Tray," we
feel as if we've been submerged in a goulash
of over-indulgent narcissism, complete with
lyrics that only the rappers understand and
odd loops that we couldn't care less about.
But just when it all seems unbearable,
Fellowship drags us away from the light at
the end of the tunnel with the '84-ish
"Cornbread," the pleasantly alternative
"Hot Potato" and the live jazz tracks "Inner
City Boundaries" and "Park Bench People."
The two jazz tracks alone make
"Innercity Griots," a must for any hip-hop
collection. In one fell swoop, these cats
bridge the gap between the jazz "vocalese" of
singers such as King Pleasure, Jon Hendrix
and more recently Bobby McFerrin, con

necting it with rap's readily acknowledged
forefathers, the Last Poets, Gill Scott Heron,
etc. What's more, they make the Brand New
Heavies, "Heavy Rhyme Experience" and
several other jazz/rap contenders, look
downright sophomoric.
You won't find the next "Hip-Hop
Hooray" on "Innercity Griots." But
Freestyle Fellowship is a reaffirmation —
cross-hairs, ill-tempered happy faces, chain
saws and flamethrowers notwithstanding —

that hip-hop has always been about four or
five brothas standing on a corner trading
impromptu "hood-stories" that rhyme.

Farrell breaks his
addiction to Jane
with a new band

Porno for Pyros

Thought you heard a new Jane's song on
the radio? Don't be fooled. For the still clue
less, the former lead singer of Jane's
Addiction, Perry Farrell's got a new band.
Same grooves, same punk, same attitude,
different name: Porno for Pyros. Actually
inspired, if you will, by a firework flyer
tucked away in an S & M mag, the name
itself soon became a double entendre —
the group announced their existence just as
the Los Angeles riots ignited.
In fact, much of the self-titled album res
onates with the fviry and frustration evoked
by the crude home-video footage and the
controversial Simi Valley verdict. "Packin'
25," an exploration of the vigilante mindset,
starts with a cat-like twang of the bass

strings and eases into a mellow verse, before
crescendoing to a funky, guitar-riddled cho
rus and Farrell's distinctive screaming.
Spanish guitar riffs and a simple bass line
give the song a predatory feel as Farrell's
grainy wail sings of putting a gun in a man's
face, crooning, "show respect to me/1 don't
care what you're thinkin'/ I'll wipe that
thought away."
While "Packin' 25" asks, "why not be the
hero?" "Black Girlfriend" tries to resolve

urban tensions in Farrell's somewhat twist
ed, black-fetish way. A slow but playful bass
line underlies a crawling guitar, while
Farrell fantasizes about going with a girl
from the 'hood.
As "Black Girlfriend" breaks into a har
monica-driven funk bridge, Farrell flaunts
their relationship, boldly taunting, "people on
the corner and in the crowd wanna do me in
'cause I won't give back that little black girl."
Singles already in heavy rotation on Live
105, such as "Porno for Pyros," "Pets" and
"Cursed Male," suggest that the new group
will have no trouble pushing songs up the
charts. And a solid debut album with sever
al strong tracks (i.e. "Packin* 25," "Orgasm,"
"Black Girlfriend") guarantees their success.
Porno for Pyros' psychedelic, funk
infused punk strays very little from the
sound that jettisoned Jane's Addiction into
stardom and Farrell into rock legend.
Though Jane's did split up, fans may rejoice
at the similarities between the bands.
Only taking drummer Stephen Perkins
with him, Farrell enlisted bassist Martyn Le
Noble (formerly of Thelonious Monster)
and guitarist Peter DiStefano to complete
Porno for Pyros.
One can only conclude that Farrell lent
Jane's more than just his unique vocal style.

It's a Jazz Thang
from Deep South
to way up North

SNIPPETS

Various Artists: Deep Blues
"Deep Blues" is small-club, down-home,
deep-fried, emotion-filled food for the soul.
All the tracks were cut on a single take —
recorded live either at small clubs and
lounges or at the artists homes.
This isn't a George Thurougood blues
album. It's pure and untainted. Tracks like
"Jumper On The Line" and "Long Haired
Doney" are more like Muddy Waters and
8.8. King — the kind of blues that gets
played in clubs, not on the radio. So if you
like the smokey atmosphere, and musical
play that are a part of deep blues, then sit
back, close your eyes and go for a little trip
to where the blues was born.

Marlon Jordan: The Undaunted
Young jazz trumpeter Marlon Jordan has
created a fast-paced album with his latest
release "The Undaunted." It has a classy feel
to it — it's lyrical, somber and reflective,
without being slow or sad. For those who
enjoy a smoother style of jazz, more like
early Miles Davis, this release won't do.
Although tracks like "Village Blues" are
calm throughout, most break away into
loose improvisation, with a lot of quick
scaling trumpet and piano to it.
The strongest member of the ensemble,
after Jordan, is Eric Reed. His work stands
out enough to give the album a dual trum
pet and piano focus, a successful feat with
Jordan's boisterous playing. On "That's
Gone," he even overshadows Jordan when
his classy improvisation takes over the
backbone of the song. With the soul of the
album in New Orleans — where Jordan
received his training — and its body in
New York — where he learned modern
experimentation — "The Undaunted" is
worthy of a place in all jazz collections.
■
Rachel Z: Trust The Universe
Rachel Z has more going for her than
just her name. She's a talented and attrac
tive pianist who's just released her first
album, "Trust the Universe." Her smooth,
contemporary jazz differentiates itself from
other releases by resisting the kitschy pop
influence found on many "easy
listening/Kenny G" releases.
"Trust the Universe" is true jazz with an
unmistakably modern feel — the perfect
album for a candle-light rendezvous. The
first track, "Nardis," has a haunting melody
that seduces the listener with a delicate
piano and mirrored bass work.
Another noteworthy track, "Monk's
Other Woman," strays a bit from the rest
of the album — it's minor blues mimicry
of Thelonious Monk's jazz style. With a
very controlled, melodic piano and lots of
saxophone, Rachel Z produces a relaxing
work that uses interesting contemporary
elements to create a unique body of
music.

Janet goes for a
new look, keeps
same tired sound

Janet Jackson

Janet Jackson's belly button did nothing
for me.
Not that her "inny" is unattractive — it's
very adorable... especially on the back cover
of her latest release "Janet." It compliments
the album's front cover: an attractive close
up of the Nubian Princess of Pop, with a head
full of bouncy girlish curls.
Cute.
Ditto for the album. That's really too bad,
since the first single off the album, "That's
the Way Love Goes," is a pleaser. One part
James Brown, two parts Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis, and the rest Miss Jackson's light
vocals, the track supposedly heralds the ar
rival of a provocative, more sexually alluring
black woman for the '90s.
But that enchanting sister never gets off
the IRT — we get variations on the same ol'
crackers from '89 instead. Weighing in at 27
tracks — roughly 12 tunes — Jackson's
fourth effort feels like a "couples" ride at an
amusement park, and that's no compliment.
Each ditty only does what it's supposed to.
Dance songs like "You Want This" and "Be
cause of Love," are suitable for rump-shakin',
while slower numbers like "The Body That
Loves You," can underscore more intimate

moments. But why bother when 20 to 30 other
albums in your collection make you wanna
zoom-a-zoom-zoom longer and stronger.
Even though the soulfully folksy "What'll
I Do" and the techno-influenced "Throb"
yield some of the album's better listens, too
many tracks cling to the status quo. An artist
of Jackson's staying power and commercial
appeal should innovate more than she does
on this album.
As for sex appeal, belly buttons and half
unzipped jeans might whip her adolescent
fans into a sexual frenzy, but it's a borderline
insult for anyone else. What's more, Jackson's
concept of erotica as expressed in the upbeat
"If" and the slow jam "Any Time, Any Place"

seem more intent on shock than titillation.
Either way, her lack of sincerity is blatant.
In "If," she propositions, "If you like, I'll
go down da down down down da down
down/ I'll hold you in my hand and baby
your smooth and shiny feels good against my
lips, sugar."
On "Any Time, Any Place" she declares, "I
can feel your hands moving up my thighs/
skirt around my waist, wall against my
face... I don't wanna stop just because peo
ple walkin' by are watchin' us... I want you
now."
Sure you do, Janny-baby.
While no one's expecting Jackson to pose
spread-eagled or bare-chested, mature and

intelligent listeners will hope for something
other than the moan fests on her last two al
bums. Save the silly kid's-stuff for Shanice...
and the lyrics too.

The kings of rap
from Queens are
making a return

Run D.M.C.

Run D.M.C. is back. But it wasn't easy.
Their last album bombed. Joey Simmons
was charged with rape. Darryl McDaniels'
liquid diet of eight 40 ounces of malt liquor a
day put him in the hospital with diabetes.
And Jason Mizell just disappeared from the
rap scene.
Still, that isn't anything a top-notch
lawyer, a couple of skilled doctors and a team
of hip-hop's best producers can't cure. Lyrical
masters D.J. Run and D.M.C., along with
super-DJ Jam Master Jay come back strapped
with phat tracks that recall their glory days.
Run D.M.C.'s latest, "Down With The King,"
effectively recreates the urban sound and
crossover appeal that made them the hypest
hip-hoppers on the East Coast. But they've
changed up their image. Gone are the top hats,
gold chains, track suits and unlaced Adidas
sneakers that were their trademarks. Now the
trio sports shaved heads, black threads and
combat boots — but they still deliver hype
lyrics with a hard-core feel, backed by the vinyl
spinning wizardry of Jam Master Jay.
The Pete Rock-produced title track pays
tribute to God, who the group believes got
them through the recent hard times and their
10- year hip-hop career. A sample of "Where
Do I Go" from the musical "Hair" is support
ed by keyboards, dope percussion and guest
raps by both CL Smooth and Pete Rock. But
the kicker is an added sample from "Run's
House" — a Run D.M.C. classic.
"Can I Get It, Yo" — produced by the
now-defunct EPMD — has an overwhelm
ing bass line that could blow your speakers,
and powerful raps that will keep your head
bobbing up and down at the crib — or force
you to jump around on the dance floor. This
ultimate house-party song will surely get shy
suckers off the wall to freak any female in
their vicinity.
