Janet goes for a
new look, keeps
same tired sound

Janet Jackson

Janet Jackson's belly button did nothing
for me.
Not that her "inny" is unattractive — it's
very adorable... especially on the back cover
of her latest release "Janet." It compliments
the album's front cover: an attractive close
up of the Nubian Princess of Pop, with a head
full of bouncy girlish curls.
Cute.
Ditto for the album. That's really too bad,
since the first single off the album, "That's
the Way Love Goes," is a pleaser. One part
James Brown, two parts Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis, and the rest Miss Jackson's light
vocals, the track supposedly heralds the ar
rival of a provocative, more sexually alluring
black woman for the '90s.
But that enchanting sister never gets off
the IRT — we get variations on the same ol'
crackers from '89 instead. Weighing in at 27
tracks — roughly 12 tunes — Jackson's
fourth effort feels like a "couples" ride at an
amusement park, and that's no compliment.
Each ditty only does what it's supposed to.
Dance songs like "You Want This" and "Be
cause of Love," are suitable for rump-shakin',
while slower numbers like "The Body That
Loves You," can underscore more intimate

moments. But why bother when 20 to 30 other
albums in your collection make you wanna
zoom-a-zoom-zoom longer and stronger.
Even though the soulfully folksy "What'll
I Do" and the techno-influenced "Throb"
yield some of the album's better listens, too
many tracks cling to the status quo. An artist
of Jackson's staying power and commercial
appeal should innovate more than she does
on this album.
As for sex appeal, belly buttons and half
unzipped jeans might whip her adolescent
fans into a sexual frenzy, but it's a borderline
insult for anyone else. What's more, Jackson's
concept of erotica as expressed in the upbeat
"If" and the slow jam "Any Time, Any Place"

seem more intent on shock than titillation.
Either way, her lack of sincerity is blatant.
In "If," she propositions, "If you like, I'll
go down da down down down da down
down/ I'll hold you in my hand and baby
your smooth and shiny feels good against my
lips, sugar."
On "Any Time, Any Place" she declares, "I
can feel your hands moving up my thighs/
skirt around my waist, wall against my
face... I don't wanna stop just because peo
ple walkin' by are watchin' us... I want you
now."
Sure you do, Janny-baby.
While no one's expecting Jackson to pose
spread-eagled or bare-chested, mature and

intelligent listeners will hope for something
other than the moan fests on her last two al
bums. Save the silly kid's-stuff for Shanice...
and the lyrics too.

The kings of rap
from Queens are
making a return

Run D.M.C.

Run D.M.C. is back. But it wasn't easy.
Their last album bombed. Joey Simmons
was charged with rape. Darryl McDaniels'
liquid diet of eight 40 ounces of malt liquor a
day put him in the hospital with diabetes.
And Jason Mizell just disappeared from the
rap scene.
Still, that isn't anything a top-notch
lawyer, a couple of skilled doctors and a team
of hip-hop's best producers can't cure. Lyrical
masters D.J. Run and D.M.C., along with
super-DJ Jam Master Jay come back strapped
with phat tracks that recall their glory days.
Run D.M.C.'s latest, "Down With The King,"
effectively recreates the urban sound and
crossover appeal that made them the hypest
hip-hoppers on the East Coast. But they've
changed up their image. Gone are the top hats,
gold chains, track suits and unlaced Adidas
sneakers that were their trademarks. Now the
trio sports shaved heads, black threads and
combat boots — but they still deliver hype
lyrics with a hard-core feel, backed by the vinyl
spinning wizardry of Jam Master Jay.
The Pete Rock-produced title track pays
tribute to God, who the group believes got
them through the recent hard times and their
10- year hip-hop career. A sample of "Where
Do I Go" from the musical "Hair" is support
ed by keyboards, dope percussion and guest
raps by both CL Smooth and Pete Rock. But
the kicker is an added sample from "Run's
House" — a Run D.M.C. classic.
"Can I Get It, Yo" — produced by the
now-defunct EPMD — has an overwhelm
ing bass line that could blow your speakers,
and powerful raps that will keep your head
bobbing up and down at the crib — or force
you to jump around on the dance floor. This
ultimate house-party song will surely get shy
suckers off the wall to freak any female in
their vicinity.

newly-activated jheri-curl with her fourth album, "Janet."
