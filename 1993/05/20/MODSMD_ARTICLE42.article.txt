San Jose is like the LC computer,
no matter how many new fea
tures it gets, people just won't
buy it.
All that aside, there are times to
saddle-up a carpool and coast down
the diamond lane to, as the locals call
it, "downtown" — and by down
town, I do mean both streets.

The San Jose Oasis offers dancing
Wednesdays through Sundays.
Wednesdays have local favorite, DJ
Julius Papp spinning house in the

main room with Bernard Cabignon
and occasional guest appearances by
Live 105 deejays spinning modern
rock in the back.
Fridays are Student Night: no
cover charge with any valid student
ID and $2 drinks all night long.
The music is a nice blend of house
and modern with DJ Richard G.
In addition, the Oasis does live
shows at extremely discounted rates
like $5. Everyone from Diggable
Planets to Negativland to The Plea
sure Barons have been there.
If you're 21 or over, the Oasis is
always worth a phone call to find
out what's going on and what drink

specials they're having.
