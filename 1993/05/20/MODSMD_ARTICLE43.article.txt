While you're waiting for one of the attractive
hostesses to find a free table in the dining
room, check out the bar at Sundance
Mine Company. Small, cozy and complete with
Stanford sports memorabilia, it's a cool place to
gulp down a S3, 25-ounce Heiniken and watch a
game before dinner.
For you yuppie gonna-bes and wanna bes, there's
The Gatehouse—very hip in a suit-and-tie-with
unbuttoned-

collar kind of
way. The pa
tio, with flo
wing foun

tains and well groomed flora, is especially nice. Low
lighting, cool tunes and artsy decor produce a com
fortable, intimate get-together type of ambience.
Thursday through Saturday, The Gatehouse
features live bands. Hot blues and cool jazz add
another dimension to this otherwise quiet place.
For a different kind of change, try the British
Bankers Club (BBC) in Menlo Park. This place
has a bit-o-brit smoking-room feel. Brass Chan
deliers, stained-glass lamps, velvet drapes and red
leather settees give it a rather opulent look, de
lightfully overdone.
BBC also has live music. While excellent local
blues and jazz bands are routinely featured, famous
musicians have been known to drop in and jam.
Last Saturday night, legendary blues man John Lee
Hooker made an impromptu stop, and brought the
house down. Definitely worth the $5 cover.
