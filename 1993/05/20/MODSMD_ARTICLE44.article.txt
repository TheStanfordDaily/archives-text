■ Benny A Joon
Hip Seattle grunginess meets
1920s slapstick in this tale of misfit
romance. Benny is a mechanic
who cares for his eloquent, but
schizophrenic sister, Joon. Enter
Sam, a charming weirdo who falls
in love with Joon, to her brother's
dismay. Johnny Depp pulls off the
physical-comedy scenes with a
style and grace that's truly
Keatonesque. PG
Indecent Proposal
The Brat Packer, The TV Veteran
and The Sundance Kid can't save
this bomb. Destitute couple wants
money. Billionaire wants wife. Bil
lionaire offers a million dollars for
one night with wife. Couple ago
nizes over it. Wife does it. Husband
can't deal with it. Wife enjoyed it.
What's next? Pain, angst and
above all, a happy ending. What's
the moral? Pimpin' ain't easy?
Avoid. R
Map of the Human Heart
Part WWII melodrama, part
"Dances With Seals," this Eskimo
epic sinks in sap, despite the pres
ence of the adorable Jason Scott
Lee and dashing Patrick Bergin,
stuck here playing an affable sicko
named Walter. Auteur Vincent

■ = Recommended

Ward manages to trivialize war,
racism, sex and disease in this dis
astrous hybrid of art film, period
piece and National Geographic
wildlife special. R
■ Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you. Kenneth
Branagh whips out a Bardful of
tricks to bring this Shakespearian
comedy to the screen. Two sets of
couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and
fall in love in a picturesque 18th
century Italian villa. Though the
American actors (Keanu Reeves
and, surprisingly, Denzel Washing
ton) can't really hang, the largely
British cast pulls off a bawdily mag
ical comedy. PG-13
Three of Hearts
Three's company ... or is it a
crowd? In this tale of tri-sexual lust
— a lesbian, a bisexual woman
and a straight-male hustler — it's
hard to tell. Kelly Lynch, jilted by
Sherilyn Fenn, hires William "Stan
ford Sophomores Love My Butt-
Baldwin to break her heart so she'll
come back. Don't expect anything
fresh, original or entertaining, tt's
been conventionalized and clich6-
ified in Hollywood's quest for the
box-office. R
