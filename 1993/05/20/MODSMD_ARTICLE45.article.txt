So you just read the Terry McMillan interview. "Hey," you
say to yourself, "/ could do that." Think again — these
three flicks expose the dangers inherent in putting pen
to paper.
Before "The Day of The Locust" or "The Player," there was
Sunset Boulevard, an incisive look at Hollywood filmmak
ing. Joe Gillis, an amoral screenwriter, hitches his fortunes to
aging silent-film star Norma Desmond. When he tries to es
cape her gilded clutches, the consequences prove deadly. Di
rector Billy Wilder successfully matches the bleakness of his
earlier classic Double Indemnity.
They said it couldn't be done. They said a film of the William
S. Burroughs book would cost more than $400 million and be
banned in every country. It took a Canadian director, David Cro
nenberg, to bring in Naked Lunch for $15 million with an "R"
rating. The result? A blackly comic look at Bill Lee, a writer whose
book takes the form of a secret agent s reports to his Control —
written on insectoid typewriters that talk back. Mugwump jism
bars, sex blobs, bug powder that gives a Kafka high—it's all there
in Cronenberg's trademark antiseptically ironic style.
The bad boys of black comedy, les frtres Coen, swept the '91
Cannes awards for picture, actor and director with Barton
Fink, which featured John Turturro as the title character, a '40s
New York playwright who goes to Hollywood to write a screen
play. But he's overcome by writer's block — and the studio's
unrelenting pressure isn't helping. As usual, the Coens display
brilliant direction and design. But the story can't rise beyond
their insufferable string of cryptic in-jokes. Worth a look. ■
