Wouldn't it just be great if, say, in the mid
dle of a boring lecture, you became em
broiled in a gunfight or perhaps a duel with
chopsticks? Well, 1 can't promise that any of
these particular action scenes are part of the
new Fearless Productions film "Phobia," but
I'm sure it'll be more exciting than CIV.
"Phobia" is a 67-minute film produced,
edited and written entirely by Stanford stu
dents.
Our hero, Henry Huxley, awakens in the
Santa Cruz mountains, and returns to cam
pus, only to realize there are people on cam
pus who want him dead. Sort of like Green
Library when you have overdue books.
Tickets are $3 and will be sold at the door.
"Phobia" will premiere Friday, May 21 in
Kresge Auditorium at 7 and 9 p.m.
