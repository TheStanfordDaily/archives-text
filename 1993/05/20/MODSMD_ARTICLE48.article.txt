## ...Nutrasweet™

Thanks to the miracles of modern tech
nology and chemical engineering, caloric
filching is no longer the stuff of dreams.
Who would have imagined that it would
take more calories to chug down a Diet Coke
or chomp on sugarless gum than you actual
ly ingested?
One calorie, a whole can of carbonated
bliss? It's too good to be true. Well, actually it is.

A single diet soda can is listed as two serv
ings under the "nutritional" information on
the label. Therefore, one can is actually two
calories.
But I digress.
Aside from having negative calories, Equal
is even sweeter than sugar, and doesn't have
that nasty saccharine aftertaste.
Anyway, when they say Nutrasweet™
"causes cancer in laboratory animals," they
are talking mass quantities.

Call me ignorant, but I don't think anyone
could possibly consume the equivalent of 300
packets of Equal per day for 10 years.
So let the non-believers pump more sugar
into their bodies. Let them live in their an
tedeluvian dreams of the past.
Meanwhile, the future looks like one awe
some calorie — or two.
