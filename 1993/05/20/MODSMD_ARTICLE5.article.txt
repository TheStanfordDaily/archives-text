# A 						life of service
## Senior Priya Haji organizes East Palo Alto outreach 
### Amanda Beacom 
Priya Haji is proud of her time in San
Quentin.
A senior majoring in religious studies
who transferred from Vassar after her
sophomore year, Haji's resume outlines
a life of service, with numerous fellow
ships and counseling work at places in
cluding the maximum-security state
prison.
And as her three years at Stanford
draw to a close, Haji — like many other
seniors — is looking toward law, busi
ness or medical school. But unlike most
students, she plans to take a few years
ofT to live and work in East Palo Alto
first.
Haji hopes to continue her service as
she organizes the development of "Free
at Last," a residential drug rehabilita
tion program scheduled to open next

Haji considers herself part
of the community. She car
ries around some of the
same emotional baggage
as the clients she counsels.

July in East Palo Alto. Then — after a
few years of running the program — it's
off to law, medical or business school —
whichever proves most useful to fulfill
her goals for the community, Haji said.
But if Haji sounds like some patron
saint rushing to save East Palo Alto, she
says she'd rather not be thought of that
way. Hfyi considers herself part of the
community — and she carries around

some of the same emotional baggage as
the clients she counsels.
Haji's community-oriented career
began in her mostly African-American
hometown in Texas where she worked
with her father on numerous programs
designed to help people.
Now, she has graduated to, among
other projects, working on her own as a
substance-abuse counselor at the Links
to Positive People-Center for Communi
ty Change in East Palo Alto.
Friend and fellow activist Tracy Clay,
a senior, explained Haji's connection to
the community. "Priya's down-to-earth.
She's more happily flawed than anyone I
know."
Many of the recovering drug abusers
and sexual-abuse victims Haji has
worked with over the past three years
would probably agree. Two fac
tors seem to explain Haji's suc
cess in avoiding what she terms
the "me better than, you less
than" mentality common to com
munity activists.
As a victim of sexual abuse her
self, Haji said she feels her own
continuing process of recovery
provides insight into her clients'
problems and serves as a common
link upon which to build a sense
of trust.

'People (in East Palo
Alto) have been hurt
and stepped on by
power structures.'
— Priya Haji

In addition to her personal
experience, Haji said her work
with East Palo Alto activist David
Lewis, has given her additional
understanding of the community.
Haji's first encounter with
Lewis occurred on the street as
she handed out condoms and
bleach to clean needles for the
San Mateo AIDS Program. Lewis
walked up to Haji and asked her
what she — a college student —
was doing trying to solve the
problems of a community to
which she didn't belong
Lewis, having spent time both
in prison and in the community,
Lewis questioned the validity of
Haji's presence. And Haji said she
simply felt intimidated by this
"big, black man" with a beard

worn in the style common to
prison inmates.
But after that less-than-auspi
cious first meeting, Haji said, her
work "took on a different dimen
sion." She and Lewis became a
team, taking advantage of one's
connections to education and
institutional resources and the
other's connections to the East
Palo Alto community.
"People (in East Palo Alto)
have been hurt and stepped on by
power structures," said Haji,
pointing to the University as one
of the culprits. "For me, the
important part is that I stepped
outside that system right away.
"East Palo Alto has become a
pet project, a mascot for Stan
ford," said Haji. "It's good that we
want to help, but there's very
much we don't know, and don't
understand."
Now, with a Stanford educa
tion under her belt, Haji is using
her practical experience — every
thing from designing health edu
cation curriculums to providing
life skills development counseling
— to develop a working definition
of what she feels "community ser
vice" should entail.
According to Haji, instead of
the visiting tutor and education
programs that Stanford students
typically become involved in for a
few hours each week, community
programs need to forge a true
partnership with East Palo Alto
residents, soliciting the aid and
input of the community when
developing a course of action.
"We need to become receptive
to needs, instead of to our own
agenda as do-gooders," said Haji.
While she finds fault with the
current construct of social ser
vice, Haji by no means idealizes
her own work. "I don't fix lives,"
she said, "I just reveal choices."
