## Senior Priya Haji organizes East Palo Alto outreach

Priya Haji is proud of her time in San
Quentin.
A senior majoring in religious studies
who transferred from Vassar after her
sophomore year, Haji's resume outlines
a life of service, with numerous fellow
ships and counseling work at places in
cluding the maximum-security state
prison.
And as her three years at Stanford
draw to a close, Haji — like many other
seniors — is looking toward law, busi
ness or medical school. But unlike most
students, she plans to take a few years
ofT to live and work in East Palo Alto
first.
Haji hopes to continue her service as
she organizes the development of "Free
at Last," a residential drug rehabilita
tion program scheduled to open next

Haji considers herself part
of the community. She car
ries around some of the
same emotional baggage
as the clients she counsels.

July in East Palo Alto. Then — after a
few years of running the program — it's
off to law, medical or business school —
whichever proves most useful to fulfill
her goals for the community, Haji said.
But if Haji sounds like some patron
saint rushing to save East Palo Alto, she
says she'd rather not be thought of that
way. Hfyi considers herself part of the
community — and she carries around

some of the same emotional baggage as
the clients she counsels.
Haji's community-oriented career
began in her mostly African-American
hometown in Texas where she worked
with her father on numerous programs
designed to help people.
Now, she has graduated to, among
other projects, working on her own as a
substance-abuse counselor at the Links
to Positive People-Center for Communi
ty Change in East Palo Alto.
Friend and fellow activist Tracy Clay,
a senior, explained Haji's connection to
the community. "Priya's down-to-earth.
She's more happily flawed than anyone I
know."

and sexual-abuse victims Haji has
