Indictment imminent
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Troops
guarded the Supreme Court and police
patrolled the capital yesterday as the court
neared a decision on whether it would
indict President Carlos Andres Perez.
The ruling, expected today, has led to
widespread fears of political upheaval in
Venezuela, where two coup attempts were
staged last year.
The Supreme Court is expected to
indict Perez on charges of embezzling
$17.2 million.
In a nationally broadcast speech, Perez
said yesterday he would abide by the
court's decision, but implored that it be
based on "juridical fact," not politics. He
vowed not to resign, quashing rumors that
he was about to give up his post and put
one of his allies in power.
Police patrols in Caracas were
increased from 2,000 to 5,000 this week.
News reports said up to 12,000 national
guard troops were on alert.
