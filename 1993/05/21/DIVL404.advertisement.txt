Some people say that service today is never like it was in the past.
That is not true at J.J. & F. where our family owned and operated
business has been providing quality service for 45 years to the
Stanford and Palo Alto area.
We provide quality produce by dealing with local peninsula growers
directly for many of our fruits and vegetables. Our produce buyer
looks in the produce market every day to find the freshest, highest
quality produce.
