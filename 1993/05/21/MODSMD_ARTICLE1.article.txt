# Investments in S. Africa, tobacco will be discussed

University officials will meet today to discuss the
issues surrounding Stanford's considerable financial
holdings in South Africa and tobacco companies.
The Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility
will address findings from a multi-university sympo
sium held last week on both investment areas, and
will examine whether Stanford should continue its
policy of "selective divestment."
Last Friday, panel members, along with represen
tatives from about 25 other schools, participated in
the annual meeting of the South Africa Research
Consortium in Washington D.C., examining universi
ty investment policies toward the strife-torn nation.
Stanford is a member of the consortium's executive
steering committee.
In addition, Stanford solicited information from
six other institutions on their stance on investment in
tobacco companies.
Gary Malone, director of investment responsibili
ty at the Stanford Management Company, said the
conference was primarily an exercise in "information
sharing . . . learning what other universities are
doing, and what they're not doing."
"I don't foresee any (policy) change coming out of
either one of these issues," he said. "I can't say
whether the trustees will decide on a new policy."
After the panel meeting, a report on both invest
ment issues will be prepared and presented to the
Board of Trustees in June.
According to Malone, the University has financial
interests in about 40 domestic and several interna
tional companies that directly invest in South Africa.
In addition, at the end of 1992, Stanford had $28.6
million invested in the America Brands, Hanson
Trust PLC, Loew's Corp. and Philip Morris tobacco
companies.
The controversy surrounding investment by
American universities in South Africa reached its
peak in the mid-'Bos, when students across the coun
try organized mass demonstrations protesting per
ceived support of South Africa's discriminatory poli
cies.
"Although interest [in South African investment]
has died down among the student community," the
issue is "still of great interest" to Stanford's financial
advisers, Malone said.
The consortium — in which the University has
participated for the past seven years — was briefed
Friday on the most recent developments in South
Africa's movement toward the abolition of apartheid,
