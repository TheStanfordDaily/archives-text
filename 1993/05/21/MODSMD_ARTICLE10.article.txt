### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A bipartisan
group of four senators pledged yester
day to fight to replace President Clin
ton's proposed taxes on energy and
some sectors of the rich with cuts in
benefits like Social Security, but House
and Senate leaders predicted his pack
age would pass almost intact.
The White House and top congres
sional Democrats moved swiftly against
the latest challenge to Clinton's budget
cutting plan. They attacked the maver
ick senators' alternative in a series of
news conferences, to prevent it from
snowballing into a political menace.
The president and leading
Democrats said the new proposal would
hurt the poor and would be defeated.
"It's basically a $40 billion shift away
from wealthy Americans right onto peo
ple just above the poverty line, the elder
ly and the working poor," Clinton said of

the proposal, which Sens. John Danforth,
R-Mo., and David Boren, D-Okla., intro
duced with Sens. Bennett Johnston, D-
La., and William Cohen, R-Maine.
Despite conservative complaints in
both chambers that the president's plan
is top-heavy with taxes, House and Sen
ate leaders predicted it would soon be
approved with little change.
The House Budget Committee for
mally approved the heart of Clinton's
plan on a party-line 26-17 vote. The full
House is scheduled to vote next Thurs
day on the measure, a $340 billion mix
of tax increases and spending reduc
tions over five years.
The senators' proposal would elimi
nate Clinton's proposed energy tax,
which would apply to various fuels
according to their heat content. It
would be felt significantly by middle
income taxpayers and Boren said such a

tax would hurt businesses.
The alternative also would eliminate
Clinton's plan to impose the Medicare
tax on all of the wages of the richest
Americans delay for six months the
higher taxes Clinton wants to impose on
corporations and well-to-do individuals,
and ease the yearly increases in the cap
ital gains tax caused by inflation.
The senators would more than com
pensate for those changes, imposing an
annual spending cap on Medicare and
Medicaid by limiting the annual cost-of
living increases that go to Social Securi
ty recipients, federal retirees and others
receiving government benefits.
Overall, the proposal would shift the
$500 billion savings Clinton wants from
its roughly 50-50 mix of tax increases
and spending cuts to 2-1 in favor of
spending reductions. It would also boost
the total savings to $542 billion.
