## Editorial Springing a big leak 
### 
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE taken a
passer-by to notice that some
thing wasn't quite right about a
metal cannister leaking a mysteri
ous, poisonous brown gas outside
the Chemistry building on Monday.
However, it was only through
this coincidence that a potentially
dangerous situation was narrowly
avoided.
University officials do not know
who to blame for dumping the can
nister near the abandoned build
ing, but they can certainly blame
themselves for not identifying and
removing the hazardous cylinder
sooner.
While it is obviously impossible
for the University to monitor
every square inch of the campus
every day, it is curious that none of
the roving Stanford police officers
or other maintenance or facilities
supervisors noticed that, one day,
there was suddenly a large, suspi

cious container resting outside of
the Chemistry building, closed
since 1989. It wouldn't appear to
require a tremendous amount of
observation and deduction to con
clude that the new cylinder was
probably not just someone's sci
ence-fair project.
The University acted ad
mirably once the cannister was
identified as a potential risk,
quickly and efficiently ensuring
that its contents would not be
fully released. But it is neverthe
less apparent that someone,
somewhere, fell asleep at their
watch in allowing this threat to
remain in our midst.
Occasional, thorough patrols of
somewhat remote, yet heavily tra
versed areas, such as near the
Chemistry building, would help
ensure that, in the future, it
doesn't take a stroke of luck to
prevent disaster.
