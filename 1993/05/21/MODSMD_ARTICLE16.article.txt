						bike storage slap

### 
NOT ONLY ARE Stanford
students losing out on cam
pus storage for their other
personal effects this summer, but
the administration now says it will
cost three times as much to store
bicycles.
This continues the University's
irksome trend of cutting many stu
dent services, while hiking the
prices of the remaining ones.
To charge $30 for storage of a
bicycle is a ridiculous cost to assess
on students. Student Housing
Operations manager Roger Whit
ney has said that students are not
just paying for storage; they are
also paying for the cost of having
someone stack, tag, provide securi
ty for and help retrieve their bicy
cles.
This may very well be true, but
with a campus wage averaging
approximately $7 an hour, Hous
ing is saying that each bicycle will
need, on average, more than four

hours worth of "care."
Whitney has also stated that
even at $30, students would be
pressed to find a better deal off
campus. This "If you don't like it,
get lost" attitude is both typical of
the University recently and
uniquely galling. University offi
cials realize that without an orga
nized effort, Stanford students do
not have the bargaining power to
obtain fair prices. The University
takes advantage of this by charg
ing close to, but not quite at, this
unfair price level.
However, this attitude may
haunt Student Housing, because
many students who are already
paying to store their belongings off
campus will just throw their bicy
cle into their storage space as well.
Why should they pay $30 on top of
other storage charges? Of course,
if Housing doesn't wish to store
bikes at all, this would merely be
fulfilling their plan.
