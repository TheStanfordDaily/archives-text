## The 						perils of pop humor 
### 
IMADE MYSELF a promise that I
would stop mentioning television in
my column. I made this promise after
reading John Ford's column in which he
mentioned that he was more akin to "Bev
erly Hills 90210" 's geeky Andrea than the
rebellious Dylan. Then I noticed a strange
thing. It didn't strike me as funny. Not a
chuckle, not a smirk, just a sigh.
In the best of all possible worlds,
where Little League players didn't smash
in each other's heads, it would have been
funny. This joke's failure wasn't John
Ford's fault, but the blame lies in the
leech school of humor he employed. If
something that is already funny gets
mentioned, then with only a slight
amount of tweaking the mention ef-iike
funny thing can also be funny. When
"90210" is mentioned, all those closet
watchers chuckle quietly to themselves,
or at least they're supposed to do so. My
column about David Letterman and
Conan O'Brien is another prime example
of this school of humor.
This doesn't work anymore, because
the readership has been so saturated
with jokes that range from "Three's
Company" to "L.A. Law" that no one
thinks anymore, "Gee, what an interest
ing and humorous reference to my
pubescent years when I was still develop
ing my social skills and various bovine
based perversions." The observant ones
out there will have noticed a variant of

the leech school in the reference to sexu
ality, but I digress.
Not a word, not a peep about
"Cheers." Huzzah, huzzah.
Now that that's off my chest, I'll
engage in a full-fledged digression.
Underclassmen can stop reading here.
Graduation is coming. Some are glad.
They are glad to leave behind obnoxious
sophomores whose egos can hardly fit
inside of their stereo-packed dormrooms,
endless house meetings, small children
selling candy and magazine subscrip
tions, 3 a.m. conversations about mastur
bation, ("Let the hate flow through you,
Luke.") and the inability of students to
keep assault weapons under their beds.
For some, this'hiyttrc place-is a pus-fllled
Hell pit. They are elated to leave it
behind.
Others are sad. They will miss the
comraderie, the friends, the dorm trip
fiascoes and the 3 a.m. conversations
about masturbation. I suspect that most
of these people are the ones who are still
without jobs. If they ever do find jobs, the
cold realization will overtake them that
these could quite possibly be the jobs they
hold for the rest of their natural lives.
They are the same dreamy-eyed people
who have their high-school yearbook on
the shelf, and truly believe that these
were the best years of their lives.
Most are simply done, finished with
this place. True, there will always be

some things they will wish they had tried
(kosher food service at the Elliot Pro
gram Center, walking into the Jackson
Business Library, taking an exam
drunk), but that desire is not enough to
keep them here. Greener pastures, wild
geese and other hackneyed metaphors
beckon them onward.
Sometime last week, in the middle of
the night, a bit prematurely, my room
mate finished with this place. No fan
fare, no diploma, classes still to complete,
he subtly crossed over into that land
beyond the Taco Bell architecture. While
discussing my prospects for housing next
year, he said, "At least you get to live
with grad students instead of undergrad
uates." He was gone, gone, gone. He was
no longer the same kid who came to Stan
ford with delusions of changing the world
and falling in love. All that was left was a
nearsighted, dateless old man, who will
end up rocking on his front porch, curs
ing passers-by and listening to country
songs that bemoan the passing of a way
of life that he never knew. Stick a fork in
him and turn him over. He's done.

Kenny wishes good luck to all those
seniors who have yet to finish their hon
ors theses.
