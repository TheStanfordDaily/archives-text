Daily article on female pilot contained factual errors

I WANTED TO share a few of my
observations and point out a few
"mistakes" concerning The Daily's
May 6 article entitled "Stanford gradu
ate to be among first female combat
pilots." First, I like (not really) how the
author concludes that Jeannie Flynn
will be among the first female combat
pilots. I'm not sure if she is aware that
not every military pilot that is selected
to go into fighters makes it, nor does
every fighter pilot fly in combat.
Becoming a fighter pilot is a tough
program. Not every student in Under
graduate Pilot Training makes it
through the program and becomes a
pilot. Of those that do, less than 1 per
cent are selected to train to become
fighter pilots. Those that are selected
must go through Lead-in Fighter Train
ing, Receiving Training Unit upgrade
into their particular aircraft and Mission
Ready (MR) upgrade before they will
even be considered to fly in combat. The
entire process takes about two years
(one of which Flynn has completed).
Along the way, many candidates will
"wash out."
Even if Flynn does make it through
the program and become MR in a fight
er, there is no guarantee that she will
fight in combat. During Operation
Desert Storm, less than half of the
State-side active fighter units and only
about one-quarter of the overseas units
were deployed. Of those, most only took
their most experienced pilots; others
kept their experienced pilots south of

the border and let their most experi
enced pilots go north into Iraq. To
assume, one year ahead of time, that any
candidate, male or female, will become
MR in a Fighter, let alone fly in a war —
which generally does not happen but for
every 20 years — is simply naive.
Second, it sounds like Flynn is well
aware of the possibility and pitfalls of
women being treated differently when
going through such a program: "|A|s
long as the standards are the same for
men and women, everything should be
fine." But the article suggests that the
initial seven female fighter pilot candi
dates will be attending a "special" com
bat training course in July. What does
that mean? I hope the author meant the
standard program for upgrading all
fighter-pilot candidates. If there is a
"special" training program for these
seven women, it is a slap in the face of
all fighter pilots and a disservice to those
seven women. Women being treated as
"special" is exactly what male fighter
pilots and female fighter pilot candidates
fear. Women who want to become fight
er pilots do not want to be treated differ
ently! That would only perpetuate the
stigma attached to them by many males
— that women would have to be treated
differently in order to "hack the pro
gram."
To be accepted into the world of fight
ers, women will have to prove them
selves in the air over a period of time,
without special treatment. But, I fear, in
the interest of political expediency, there

will be preferential treatment of women
going into fighters. It is possible, if not
probable, that instructors will be told, in
so many words, to give this initial cadre
of female Tighter-pilot candidates the
"benefit of the doubt" if they have prob
lems during their upgrade training. I
was not given that latitude and I am cer
tain that these women do not want it
either. They would probably prefer to
"show the boys that they can play ball."
The last comments I have concern
Flynn's statement: "They say 'now
women can get shot at,' but women were
always shot at. They were killed in
Desert Storm. They were missing-in
action .. . The only difference is now we
can shoot back." I beg to differ that the
only difference is that women can now
shoot back. Being shot at by Anti-Air
craft Artillery, Surface-to-Air Missiles
and Iraqi fighters every day for two
months is quite a bit different than a
possibility of being killed in a Scud mis
sile attack 240 miles south of the border.
Certainly, women have been killed in
war, and have served their country with
a distinction equal to men. But the issue
of women in combat goes far beyond just
being able to "shoot back." It goes into
our nation's perception of women in
combat. How will women being killed in
large numbers, raped and tortured as
prisoners of war affect the national psy
che and our armed forces' capability to
fight and win? These are heart-felt con
cerns for many people, and of great con
sequence for the security of our nation,

not just ancillary issues.
None of what I have said is to take
anything away from Flynn or any of the
other women who want to go into fight
ers. Flynn is probably an excellent pilot
and will probably make it if she works
hard. And, personally, I think women
should be given the opportunity to fight
and die for their country in combat if
they meet the same exacting standards
as men. But this is an issue that I feel
strongly about, because it was my pro
fession and I do not think it should be
assumed that everybody who flies will
become a fighter pilot and fly in combat.
Why is the distinction important to
me? Because I was there and I led 35
combat missions over the skies of Iraq,
and I lost one of my college buddies and
a couple of other friends during the war.
Being a fighter pilot and flying in com
bat are honors that are both given and
earned. Not a single fighter pilot I know
who did not fight in the war would ever
go so far as to label themselves a "com
bat pilot." Before anyone joins the ranks
of fighter pilots, he or she should learn
that lesson. In fact, each and every one
of them would be embarrassed, as I am,
that someone else could use the term
"combat" in such a flippant and conclu
sory manner. Out of respect for those
who have fought, and in consideration of
the importance of the issue, I feel that
the article deserved more careful word
ing, or at least a better understanding.
