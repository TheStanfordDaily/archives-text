# There is nothing at all hypocritical in talking negatively of smoking

There ia nothing hypocritical about
telling people who emoke that they smell
"like a chimney," and not telling people

who are fat that they are "an obese
heart-attack-waiting-to-happen."
There's a real distinction between the
two.
A person who smokes cigarettes is a
smoker. They smoke.
A fat person is fat. They aren't a fat
ter. They don't engage in fatting.
Catch the difference?
Smoking is disgusting, smells like

crap, stains clothing and causes disease.
But if Mr. Richardson wants to smoke,
that's fine. Just don't do it near me.
Why The Daily decided to print a
four-column diatribe smashing fat peo
ple and bemoaning the rights of smokers
is beyond me. Quit wasting print and
use it for something important.
