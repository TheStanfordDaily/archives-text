# Joel Stein: Masquerading Iconoclast

class. Do something constructive. Write a
letter. Read a book. Draw that little tur
tle guy from the TV Guide ads until you
win the $50 prize. Just don't go to class.
Because it will poison your mind.
Early in your life, before you knew the
word "cursive" was never part of com
mon parlance, someone slipped an extra
Twinkie in your lunch box and said that
if you were quiet and took notes — even
if you didn't have the slightest intention
of ever looking at them again — you
would be a good student.
And you blindly listened to them
because, well, because you were in second
p-ade and they had a Twinkie. But
instead of a scholar, you became the kind
of person who gets good grades, writes
boring papers and displays the kind of
intellectual curiosity which causes you to
read "The Firm" in your free time.
But — like that guy in the Rogaine
commercial coming to give an utterly

confusing, but nonetheless inspirational,
speech to a Little League team — I've
come to save your soul.
Which, in '90s fashion, equates to
telling you it's not your fault. Yes, I've
come to abscond you from guilt by spin
ning a conspiracy theory so obtuse and
complex that not even Oliver Stone could
make a mini-series about it. A conspiracy
which will make you a Wagnerian-sized
hero just for annoying your TA.
Nota benerThe following applies only
to humanities students. The engineering
and science departments are doing fine
and need not be fixed. They attract top
students and researchers from all over
the world. The humanities only attract
people from New York and Los Angeles.
This says almost as much about the decay
of the humanities as it does the decay of
New York and Los Angeles.
The humanities are dying like a Prince
album on its third week of release. It is
dying a slow, painful death from a mix
ture of starvation, junk food and Bridge
trained TAs who say things like "But how
does the Spanish-American War make
you feel?"

There are four prongs to the death of
the humanities. This is mostly because
I've always wanted to make a four-prong
argument, especially where death is con
cerned. It would be highly inappropriate,
however, for me to tell you what a
"prong" is in this sentence.
Prong one: Words have usurped
ideas. The rule of modern scholarship
holds that the more complex and over
wrought your language and more inac
cessible and arcane the references, the
better the argument. Kind of like in this
column, or a Dennis Miller guest
appearance on MST 3K. See what I
mean? Anyway, in class, it would go
more like this: "This is merely Der
ridean construction of a topoi without
any agency." Yeah.
Prong two: Departments are obsessed
with the incessant need to overspecialize.
In high school we had classes like history
and art. Since college began, I have been
told to read Henry James' "Turn of the
Screw" three times. I don't know enough
about art to pick up a woman at a muse
um, although this was my original justifi
cation for going to college.

Prong three: The University fashions
itself a social worker. How we feel is more
important than how we think. I don't
want to know how the Peggy Eaton affair
reminded the girl in my section of her
own parent's painful divorce. Unless a
historically-situated sympathy will score
me points.
Prong four: Distance from reality.
Used to be, when they taught the cave
sequence in Plato, they related it to
Nixon's rise to power or the sexual revo
lution or something. Then I learned it
was just a guy in a cave. Students feel so
divorced from real life that most of us
don't read the newspaper and are no
more useful to our democracy than Cliff
Clavin.
No, the purpose of the university is
not to find "the truth." But it's certainly
not to make yourself feel important
either. It's to expand your boundaries
and get you to think in ways you never
considered before.
And the only way you or your progeny
are going to be able to do that is if you
take on the system now. And the easiest
place to do this is in class sections.

First of all, stop writing the kind of
papers they taught you to write in junior
high. Write a paper in first person.
Descartes did it. And write about some
thing you really think. Write an intelli
gently argued paper about why Henry
James is boring. Write a paper stating,
categorically, that Immanuel Kant is a
horrible writer. It'll be better than any
thing you've written in a while.
Education, at its root, has become a
nullifying factor being administered by
careerist opportunists.
All is vanity and striving after women.
Or something like that. I don't think
we got to that in CIV.
