## Rodriguez shakes off past, reaches new levels of speed 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Heading into this weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship meet — to be held today and
tomorrow in Berkeley — Rene
Rodriguez is on top of the world.
At Big Meet two weeks ago,
Rodriguez shattered the freshman
school record and set an NCAA pro

visional mark by blazing through
the 400 meters on a 46.46 second
pace.
Last week, Rodriguez again
reached new heights, this time in
the 4 x 400 relay, pulling the Stan
ford squad from dead last to the
leader of the pack in 45.9 seconds,
during the second leg.
When he's not racing, the self
described goofball is pulling sopho

moric pranks on his fellow team
mates and thoroughly enjoying his
freshman year. His close friends
have affectionately nicknamed him
the Latino Lover for his good looks
and easy-going personality, and
Rodriguez has come to accept this
image as an on-going joke with the
team.
Despite his contentment with his
present situation, running has not

been all fun and games for
Rodriguez. After a disappointing
high-school career, the phenomenal
speedster from Edinburg, Texas,
began to doubt his abilities, and
even contemplated quitting track.
"High school was probably one of
the most disappointing times I had
in my career, because as a 14-year
old I had broken the national record
for my age-group which was 51.36,
and I ran 48.28," Rodriguez said. "I
thought, after that, I was on my way
to world-record times."
The next year Rodriguez did
improve to 47.50, but he was not
able to drop more than .32 seconds
off of his time during high school. "I
stagnated from 15 all the way up to
18, and I thought my track career
was over," he said.
People started speculating that
Rodriguez had burned himself out
by peaking at such a young age. He
was always picked by track watch
ers to win the Texas state champi
onship, but the gold medal was
never his.
"It wasn't anything physical,
because I believe that I have always
had the physical abilities all my
life," Rodriguez said. Collegiate
coaches across the nation seemed to
agree, as the Texan was offered
track scholarships from many pres
tigious schools.
Even upon entering Stanford,
Rodriguez continued to doubt him
self, because of his lackluster perfor
mances.
"After going to practice and get
ting beat three consecutive times, I
turned into a big baby," Rodriguez
said. "I balled up in my little cubby
hole and just cried up a storm At

that moment, I knew I was broken
down and ready to give up track, but
I said a little prayer for God to show
himself and help me in my faith.
"I thought it was all over. I was
considering packing my bags and
going home. I was down and com
pletely out. I always thought I had
something within me, but I didn't
think I was good enough to bring
that out."
Rodriguez believes that his Bap
tist faith renewed his strength and
confidence. "Now I like to think of
myself as God and me, and that
combination has made me able to
run and feel the way I do now."
The new Rene Rodriguez is more
hungry and more competitive, eager
to visualize every race as a war.
"(Assistant) coach (George)
Walcott taught me to use that
analogy to overcome my mental
blocks," Rodriguez said. "When
you're out there running, it's like
a war. The 400-meter race is a
race that demands aggressiveness.
You can't go in there with a weak
mentality — because you know
you're going to hurt and everyone
else is going to hurt — but it's a
matter of who wants it more at the
end."
In another break from high
school, Rodriguez is not setting any
lofty goals for himself, either.
"So many athletes put a lot of
pressure on themselves to be
world-class, and it just becomes a
big mental thing," Rodriguez
said. "Coach Walcott told me not
to worry about my times and
relax, bemuse the times will come
eventually."
Indeed, the seconds have been

dropping faster than anyone dared
anticipate, as Rodriguez is presently
the fourth-fastest man in the Pac
-10. However, despite his immense
natural talent, he and his coach rec
ognize several aspects of his tech
nique that can be improved.
Sprinters agree that in addition
to natural speed, strength is one of
the factors that account for a fast
race. "A human being accelerates
from 0 to 40 meters," Rodriguez
explained. "From 40 to 60 meters he
hits his top speed, and from 60 to
100 he decelerates. What makes a
good sprinter is one who can hold
his top speed from 60 meters and
on. That comes from strength and
technique."
The freshman sprinter and his
coaches don't believe he has reached
his maximum speed yet, indicating
the possibility of more improve
ments and records in the future.
"I definitely have not reached my
maximum speed yet. The thing hin
dering me from reaching it right
now is my inflexibility. I can't even
get past my shins on a toe-touch,
but I'm going to take ballet over the
summer to help me overcome that,"
Rodriguez said jokingly.
For now, the Latino Lover's past
problems have no place in the post
season races, as he hopes to moti
vate and inspire his team with his
solid performances.
"You know when you see
Michael Jordan making a shot at
the buzzer and you immediately
pick up the ball and go shoot hoops,
hoping to play like him? That's
what I want to do in the future,
motivate people to do better than
they ever expected."
