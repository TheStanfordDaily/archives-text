# Crews compete in Pacific Coast race
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
After a turbulent regular
season for both the men's and
women's crews, the Cardinal
rowers enter this weekend's
Pacific Coast Rowing Champi
onship in Sacramento, Calif.,
with high hopes.
Controversy accompanies
Stanford's men's crew into the
regatta. Predicting a third seed,
men's coach Wieslaw Kujda
was surprised to find the Cardi
nal seeded fourth, behind
Washington, California and
Oregon State.
Stanford and Oregon State
never raced head-to-head this
year, but in races against the
same competition, the Cardinal
had consistently faster times
than the Beavers. The only race
result tipping the scale in favor
of Oregon State was Stanford's
loss to Cal, as Oregon State did
not lose by as large a margin.
"The seedings are not accu
rate," Kujda said. "We had big
ger margins of victory and had
faster times all year. Our goal
all season was to be the third
seed at Sacramento.'*
The seeding does not create
much of a problem, however.
Stanford will face Oregon State
and Long Beach State in one of
three qualifying heats Satur
day. Two boats advance from
each heat to form the six-boat
final on Sunday.
"We plan to take it easier
Saturday and peak for Sun
day's race," Kujda said. "You
only have your best race once in
the season, and it is my job as
coach to prepare the team to
produce their best race when it
counts."
Washington appears to be
the clear favorite after its
impressive victory at the San
Diego Crew Classic last month
and its sweep of Cal two weeks
ago. However, Kujda remains
optimistic about Stanford's
chances.
"Washington has been good
all year, and you expect them to
be good, because they have four
rowers who competed in
Barcelona last summer," Kujda
said. "But you can't keep as
high a speed as they showed in
San Diego all year. Also, a lot of
ugly things can happen in 2,000
meters."
Kujda expects four boats to
be competing for the champi
onship. Washington and Cal
have been strong all year, and
Stanford's progress in the past
three weeks has moved them
back into contention. He is also
worried about UCLA, who
rowed very well against the
Cardinal at the Newport Regat
ta two weeks ago.
He also sees a good chance

for the junior varsity to sur
prise the field and take home
the championship, as this
year's Cardinal squad is the
fastest junior-varsity
Kujda has everTTad.
"The whole team is really
psyched," Kujda said. "The var
sity, JV and freshmen all know
this is the regatta that counts."
The women's crew enters
the championships with a
lower seed than it expected in
the 11-boat field. Because of
its loss to UC-Davis two weeks
ago, the Cardinal received the
fifth seed, behind Washing
ton, Cal, Washington State
and UC-Davis. Two heats will
race Saturday, with the top
three boats from each heat
moving on to Sunday's six
boat final.
Stacked up against the Car
dinal on Saturday will be Wash
ington and Davis — and, like its
male counterpart, the Husky
women's boat looks to be the
decisive favorite.
"I think Washington is out
to show everybody how good
they are this year," said
women's coach Wendy Davis.
"Last year their women's crew
went undefeated in the regular
season and then came in fifth
at Nationals. They don't want
that to happen again."
The Cardinal still is without
the services of junior Kate Ste
ger, who is sidelined with a
back injury. Steger has been
receiving acupuncture for
relief, but she will not be row
ing this weekend.
"Kate not rowing definitely
hurts us," Davis said. "But
everybody who is rowing now is
healthy, which is a change for
us this season."
Davis said this weekend's
outcome has been difficult to
predict. Washington State
remains the unknown, as Stan
ford has only seen the squad
once this year in San Diego.
"Normally going into a race
I'm 90 percent sure we'll win or
90 percent sure we'll lose,"
Davis said. "I really don't know
about this weekend, and for
Washington State I have no
clue."
The women's junior-varsity
boat is in position to secure
third place in its seven-boat
field. Although Davis sees little
hope of beating Washington or
Cal, the Cardinal junior varsity
has defeated every other boat
in its field. The only trouble
may come from UC-Santa Bar
bara, although Stanford defeat
ed them earlier this season by a
sizable margin.
The top two boats in both
the men's and women's races
go on to the Cincinnati Regatta
on June 11 and 12 for the
National Championship race.
