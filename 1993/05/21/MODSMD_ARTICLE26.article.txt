# Last home stand:
## Cardinal meets Bruins in season finale 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Cardinal wraps up its sea
son tliis weekend, facing UCLA in
a three-game series at Sunken Dia
mond.
With a 26-26 record, Stanfohl
must win at least two of three
games to keep the school streak of
28 consecutive winning seasons
alive.
Throughout the year, coach
Mark Marquess stressed the need
for his team to "get hot," some

thing the squad was never quite
able to accomplish.
After racing to a 10-3 record and
a national ranking as high as No. 8
on Feb. 21, the Cardinal has only
managed to string together one
winning streak of more than two
games since then, slumping to 9-18
and last place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
Stanford closes out against the
No. 18 Bruins (32-20 overall), a
squad that knocked the wind out of
the Cardinal's sails earlier in the
season.
Way back in April, Stanford
travelled to Jackie Robinson Stadi
um in Los Angeles very much in
the Six-Pac and NCAA playoff
hunt. After series wins over Cali
fornia and then-division-leading
USC, the Cardinal could have
vaulted into the divisional race
with a successful series against
UCLA.
The Bruins swept the games,
winning two extremely close con
tests to open the series, and finish
ing off with a rather convincing 6-2
victory. Stanford has not won a con
ference series since that weekend.
UCLA, second to Arizona State
in the Six-Pac race, needs to sweep
the Cardinal this weekend to keep
its slim chance at a No. 1 NCAA
regional seed alive.
Postseason thoughts are far
from the minds of the several Car
dinal baseballers who close out
their collegiate careers. Willie
Adams, an Honorable Mention All-
Six-Pac pick and Stanford's series
opening pitcher all season, will
throw on Sunday instead of today.
It is a fitting tribute to a pitcher
who was the Cardinal's top starter
for most of his three years on the
Farm.
Andrew Lorraine, Saturday's
starting pitcher, will also end his
Stanford career against the Bruins.
Lorraine and Adams, both juniors,
are both eligible for the
league draft in June. It is extreme
ly unlikely that either will return
for his senior season.

Amazingly enough, Adams and
Lorraine may well be the only two
Cardinal lettermen who do not
return next season. The team's
other five juniors will most likely
be wearing a Stanford uniform in
1994. Greg Mix, a right-handed
senior who gets the start today,
also has another year of NCAA eli
gibility remaining.
Which will make for a much dif
ferent team next year. Stanford
returns at least one experienced

player at every position, including
an infielder, a plethora of outfield
ers and a catcher — freshman A.J.
Hinch — who started 47 games
this season.
"I'd like to say that we're all
set (in our position assignments)
for next season, but we're not,"
Marquess said about next year's
starting lineup. "I've played
about 10 to 12 guys pretty regu
larly, and they're all coming back
next year."
