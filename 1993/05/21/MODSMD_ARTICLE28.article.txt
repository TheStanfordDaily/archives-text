After two days of play, only one member of
the Cardinal men's tennis squad has been elimi
nated from NCAA Championship singles action.
White juniors Michael Flanagan and Vimal
Patel both advanced to the round of 16 in singles,
classmate Robert Devens was not so fortunate.
No. 7-ranked Flanagan had a solid, almost
routine, win over No. 35 Mark Weaver of
Texas A&M. Flanagan had an early service
break to take a 2-1 lead and then broke
Weaver again to go up 5-2. After losing serve
in the next game, he rallied back to clinch the
first set 6-4.
In the second set, Flanagan broke Weaver's
serve twice, taking a comfortable 3-0 lead. The
players each held serve for the rest of the
match, with Flanagan winning 6-3.
"[Weaver] has a big serve," Flanagan said.
"I tried to get to it before it played me. I was

seeing the ball well off of his racket."
Today, Flanagan starts off with a match
against David Draper of Texas. In team com
petition last week, Stanford freshman Jeff
Salzenstein defeated Draper in two sets.
If Flanagan's match was routine, Patel's was
anything but. Patel created one of the biggest
upsets of the tournament by defeating UCLA's
No. 1 player, Sebastien Leßlanc, 6-4,6-3.
By virtue of reaching today's round of 16,
Patel will receive All-American honors from
the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. Flana
gan garnered the honor earlier due to his No.
7 ranking entering the tournament.
"Leßlanc really didn't play that well," Patel
said. "He had a rough day and opened a lot of
opportunities for me. Fortunately, I was able
to take advantage. Every match is tough —
any win in this tournament is big."
This morning, Patel will square off against
USC's tough No. 2-man, David Ekerot, who is
currently nationally ranked No. 12.

» Devens did not fare well against the Tro
jans' Wayne Black yesterday. The No. 10-
ranked Zimbabwe Davis Cupper took an early
lead over Devens and held on, despite a close
second set. He eliminated Devens from the
tournament with a 6-2, 7-5 win.
In doubles action, Flanagan and partner
Chris Cocotos easily defeated Idaho State's
Mike Castrilli and Omar Rashid 6-3, 6-4.
At the end of the day, Devens and Patel's
first shot at doubles competition ended in
heartbreak. Squaring off against Tennessee's
Christopher Haggard and top-seeded singles
player Chris Woodruff, the Stanford pair lost
the first set 3-6 but rebounded to take the sec
ond 6-4.
In a gruelling third set, Stanford held serve
at 5-6 to enter a tie-breaker. After squander
ing three match points, the Cardinal found
itself tied at 9-9, but could not break Ten
nessee's serve. The Volunteers won the set
and the match, 11-9 in the tiebreaker.
