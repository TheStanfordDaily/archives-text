## The 						Diversions Cereal Review 
### Michael Green Joshua Walker Staff writers 
Cereal was never meant to be a
breakfast food. It's more like a sta
ple — the kind that'll keep you alive
when Wilbur serves Chicken Tar
ragon. Again.
Hut in this day, new cereals
burst into the market every few
minutes like cheap, flannel-toting
grunge rockers from the Pacific
Northwest's finest trailer parks.
So, in order to update all the
uninformed members of our slack
er generation, we ventured forth to
meet some of the newer occupants
of the cereal aisle and tell you what
we think.
Rice Krispie Treats Cereal,
Kellogg's, "Wholesome, crispy clus
ters
Woo-wee — everyone is excited
about this one. After all, who
doesn't like Rice Krispie Treats?
Just imagine all the wonderful pos
sibilities:Will sticky, yet remark
ably crispy globs of goop accumu

humid day, will it all stick togeth-

giant Rice

Krispie Treat? Does it still talk —
or do Snap, Krackle and Pop sound
like they're in a chubby-bunny con
test?
We just couldn't resist trying
them first. But sadly, after a few
mouthfuls, we hobbled back,
spoons limp, to our regular Rice
Krispies.
They were not sticky. They were
not chewy. They were dry.
As milk was added, the Krispie
Treats rapidly lost their appeal.
They were way too marshmallowy,
and a strange sugar film appeared
at the top of the milk.
As time wore on, and our
mouths were less and less able to
endure the now overly mallow
ness, the film got thicker and thick
er. When done we both felt the need
to shave our tongues.
Our advice: stick with tradition.
Add sugar to the plain, old cereal or
pour milk on the homemade
Krispie Treats mom sends.
Cinnamon Mini Buns, Kel
logg's, "A Cyclone of Cinnamon in
Every Mini Bun ... Now! Maxi
mum Sweet Cinnamon
The last time you had cinna
mon, it was probably not very
sweet — it was sort of, well, cinna
mony. So why some geek decided to
add even more to Cinnamon Mini
Buns — just to call them "New!" —
we'll never know.
Besides that obvious tip-off, a
visual investigation of the cereal
offers another clue that something
is afoot. Mini Buns look like little
swirls of cat doodie. Really.
Dry, they could be snackable for
about five or six turds — until the

processed taste eases
it's way into

your molars.
But once
that milk

buns, the
experience is
never quite
the same.

tom a bowl,

the appearence of, say, chocolate
filtered stuff doesn't irk a bit. It's
logical: chocolate milk, chocolate
cereal milk — it works. But Quik
never came up with cinnamon mix
for milk, and for good reason.
And after a brief soak, the whole
thing turns into a Mini Bun Mush
that might be fine if you need mor
tar, but for cereal, no thanks.
Where is that shrunken guy
from the commercial so we can flick
his head?
Rainforest Crisp, Rainforest
Products, Inc., "Help Save the
Rainforest
Ahhh, cereal with a message.
While the selfless intentions of
this cereal's creators (its ingredi
ents are used to raise the value of
rainforest land, and a percentage of
its profits are donated to ecological
causes) are quite generous, its
manifestation is a bit on the
weighty side.
Rainforest Chunk is more like it.
The main problem here is that
the cashews and brazil nuts, so phi-
Lanthropically cultivated, are cut
into slabs about the size of your
middle finger, which is assumed to
be extended towards the bastard
industrialists who cut down all
those precious trees.
This — combined with the
grainy bark meant to pass for
flakes — only comes to make
this the most dense of all break
fast cereals. When milk is
poured on, the only ingredients
which come close to floating are
the puffed rice and the little
blades of grass that made it
through the sifter.
All in all, if you threw in some
M&M's and gummy bears, this
stuff might be considered a viable
trail mix. But otherwise keep it out
of the reach of small children.
Banana Nut Crunch, Post,
"Delicious taste of Home-Baked
Banana Nut Bread"
The name doesn't lie. Banana
Nut Crunch resonates with one fla
vor only: bananas.
It smells of bananas. It tastes of
bananas. It'll turn your clothes yel
low.
In a crispy medley of quick-to
sog flakes, high-quality granola,
walnut chunks and banana flakes,

Banana Nut Crunch, succeeds at
what it sets out to do: capture the
taste of banana-nut bread in a cere
al.
The nut-to-cereal ratio was well
within appropriate proportions,
although the walnuts could only be
identified by their texture. They,
like the milk, the bowl and your
tongue, become embodied with the
spirit of — you guessed it —
bananas.
Basically, the only draw
back was this overwhelming
bananiosity which so flagrantly
reminds everyone within a 30-foot
radius that they are indeed being
exposed to Banana Nut Crunch.
Wheaties Honey Gold, Gener
al Mills, "If you like frosted flakes,
try Wheaties Honey Gold!"-.
We both ate Wheaties full-time
as a kid. We ate them before play
ing, we ate them while watching
cartoons, we ate then in a box, we
ate them with a fox. We even ate
Wheaties before the SATs. The
"Breakfast of Champions," right?
So when a new Wheaties prod
uct hit the market, one has to ask,
"Is it possible? Can anything ever
come close to the satisfaction that
Air Jordan's breakfast of choice
could offer?"
The answer: yes and no.
Wheaties Honey Gold will never
be able to beat out good ol'
Wheaties, but it does offer a new,
yummy taste. First of all, it's corn.
That means crispy and tasty, with
flakes much thicker than your
average corn flake. And because it's
corn, it's yellow; that means no
more scab-brown wheat flakes.
Sadly, the honey-ness .of the
cereal makes the flakes appear
shiny, if not laquered. Good to
check your hair in, but otherwise
disconcerting.
But once the milk gets splashed
on, Honey Gold showed us the
temptation that made Mary Lou
gain those few extra pounds.
In sum, they're good — good
enough to finish the whole bowl
after trying four other cereals first.
Now, they'll never hit the same
nirvanic plateau as Kellogg's Frost
ed Flakes, but at the same time
they defy the comparison. They
create a whole new genre.
