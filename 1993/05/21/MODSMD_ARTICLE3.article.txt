## Rice to apply Cold War lessons to new position as provost 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
She'll trade Russian revolutions for cam
pus controversies when she takes over as
provost next year, but Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice isn't worried about the
transition.
"The University is going through a lot of
changes very rapidly, some of them hostile,
some supportive," she said in an interview
yesterday.
But her experience advising former presi
dent George Bush on the Soviet Union as the
Cold War ended — "when every assumption
about the international system seemed to be
just falling away before our very eyes, and
where we had to develop policies really with
out a compass" — may serve her well in
dealing with the changes.
In her Galvez House office, autographed
photographs of world leaders, including
Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, hang as per
manent testimony to her two-year tenure as
the White House specialist on the Soviet
Union.
She exudes a quiet self-confidence — "I've
got a steep learning curve. I think I'm a pret
ty quick learner," she says — and proves her
self a veteran diplomat when she skillfully
sidesteps questions on controversial issues
such as next year's re-evaluation of under
graduate education.
"Well, I have ideas," she says, "but I don't

want to circumscribe the conver
sation and the debate we might
have by putting those ideas on the
record."
Rice, 38, who goes by the nick
name "Condi," punctuates her
words with a quick smile and gen
tle humor as she speaks about
everything from her personal life
to her decision to take the Univer
sity's second-highest position.
Rice said she was "a little sur
prised" when University President
Gerhard Casper offered to make
her the provost, the University's
chief budget and academic officer.
"I was delighted, and my only
reservation was not about the job,
or working with him, or what I
want to do at Stanford, but about
leaving research and teaching at
this historic junction," she
recalls. "I had a fairly long trip to
Russia and Kazakhstan planned
in July that I think is now down
the drain."
It was her admiration for
Casper that cinched the decision,
says Rice, who was on the search
committee that recommended
him for the presidency.
After meeting Casper in Chicago
for the first time last year, Rice says
she remembers "coming back and
saying to some of the other people
at dinner that night that his pas
sion for what we do as academics
just came through so much."
Her own passion resonates as
she speaks about the commitment
to teaching she shares with Stan
ford's president. "I just think that
every day we have to get up as a
faculty and justify to ourselves
that we're doing absolutely the
best and most committed job that
we can do as teachers," Rice says.
While some in the sciences might
worry about an administration
run by a lawyer and a political sci
entist, Rice is effusive in her praise
for the techie side of Stanford.
"It's remarkable to walk
around this campus and see the
innovation in biochemistry or
physics. You see what it's meant
for the march of human knowl
edge as well as the progress of the
country. You can't help but be
respectful of that."
'I'm a part of diversity'
Although she had much to say
about academics generally, Rice
declined to take a position on spe

cific multicultural issues such as
the campaign for Asian-American
studies, saying she wants to listen
to varied views first.
But Rice says she has no
doubts that "America and indeed
the international system is
stronger from the recognition of
the value and contribution of lots
of different cultures."
"I'm a part of diversity and I'm
proud to be," she says, adding
that she has "never understood
why there are some who would
link issues of diversity to issues of
compromising standards."
"I think it is an insult to the
university to suggest that you
should compromise standards, or
that you would compromise stan
dards, for diversity," she says.
Growing up in Birmingham,
Ala., Rice remembers prejudice
there was "pretty blatant."
"I'm certain that I've encoun
tered discrimination from time to
time," she says, but adds that she
has always believed in keeping
her eye on her goals and making
sure she does not "fall into a
sense of powerlessness."
Reading the operating budget
Rice first arrived at Stanford in
1981 as a 25-year-old assistant pro
fessor and is currently assistant
director of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
In preparation to assume office on
Sept. 1. Rice says she plans to read
extensively and talk to students,
administrators and faculty.
"I'm already reading the oper
ating budget," Rice says.
She also hopes to talk to facul
ty and other members of the Uni
versity community frequently
during her tenure in the adminis
tration to avoid losing contact
with campus opinion.
"When I was in government, I
became all too aware of how you
could get distanced from how what
you were doing was actually being
perceived," Rice says. "You were
working 16 hours a day, you were
just sure you were doing the most
important work, and then you
read a headline — 'Bush adminis
tration slow in response.' "
She describes her management
style as an open one. "I don't like
to be surprised," she says."I like
people to talk things out with me
before it's necessary to make a
decision, not after it's too late to
do something about it."
Working with Casper will be a
highlight of her new job, accord

ing to Rice. "I think we share
across the board a whole set of
values and beliefs."
However, their similarities will
not prevent her from voicing dis
sent. "I think I owe it to him to
tell him if I think he's making a
mistake. When I served in govern
ment, you could tell the success
ful cabinet secretaries because
the people they had around them
were willing and able to deliver at
key times a useful critique."
A chance to serve Bush
Along with serving in the Bush
administration, Rice delivered a
speech at last summer's Republican
National Convention. However, she
says she has never given much
thought to her party affiliation.
"I had a chance to serve Presi
dent Bush at a time when what I
did was very, very critical to the for
eign policy agenda," Rice says."I
remember that it was not even
until after I was offered the job that
they asked if I was a Republican."
While Rice says she does not let
her politics intrude on teaching
and research, she admits that she
gets some teasing.
"It's a source for my colleagues
of some joking. You know, 'If the
two Republicans in the political
science department are absent, do
you have a quorum?' and things
like that."
Already busy, Rice says she's
prepared to make sacrifices for
her new job. "When I went to
Washington I did the same
thing," Rice says."I ofT-loaded
everything and worked full-time
and I expect to do the same thing
in this job."
Despite her hectic schedule, Rice
enjoys playing tennis, bridge and
the piano. She says she once figure
skated "competitively and badly,"
but adds, "I haven't skated in eight
years. It's a young person's sport."
"I'm a rabid, committed foot
ball and basketball fan," she adds.
"I love spectator sports. I'll watch
almost anything with a score at
the end."
When things get rough, Rice said
she often turns to her father — a
retired Presbyterian minister who
lives in Palo Alto — and good friends
she's known as long as 14 years.
Never married, Rice says she
has never made a conscious deci
sion to concentrate on her career
over marriage and a family. "I
haven't ever found anyone I
wanted to live with yet," she said.
"I have a full and wonderful life."
