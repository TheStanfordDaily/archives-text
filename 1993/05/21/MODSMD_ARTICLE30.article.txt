I-ast Saturday morning, at a quarter 'til three,
I found myself driving south on 280. At three, I
was driving north again. And at a quarter after, I
headed back south. It was at this point that I real
ized that I wanted to go to Disneyland.
But, being the reliable, superego-driven kind of
guy I am, I had no trouble coming up with a whole
bunch of excellent reasons why flitting off to Dis
neyland would be less than good. The fact that it
was not my car that I was driving figured promi
nently, but the idea of returning it to my dad by
eight that morning was becoming increasingly
unrealistic, and so this turned into a lesser issue.
I did not want to miss the Bridge's camping
"advance" (OK, OK, I mean retreat, though I
wonder about the habit of applying military
terms to daily life. Of course both "ambush" and
"flanking" seem apropos, as does "multi-theater
bacterial warfare." But enough about love and
laundry). However, the camping trip seemed
more unlikely with each passing exit sign.
The usual stress suspects were all there:
research in the library, chemistry lab to finish
and various papers to think about — all of which
would murder me if left until Monday morning.
Finally, the thing that kept me rooted in my
Daly routine was this, the budding relationship
in my life: yeast.
I n a locked room deep in the Stanford campus,
10 8 yeast were waiting for me, replicating fer
vently in the anxious expectation of 10 a.m. Sat
urday morning and of my loving care.
At three o'clock I was less than interested in
the number of the yeast — but the diabolical

things required counting that morning.
After all this class work, this was objective inves
tigation — this was Science! Admittedly, the class
was pass/fail, and six other groups would produce
the same results, but hey ... Science!
I did not go to Disneyland.
If I may quote our gifted speaker from earlier
this week, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., "Peculiar travel
suggestions are dancing lessons from God." One
tends to remember such quotes after yanking out
2940 in the draw, and these words of wisdom
stayed with me, solely as impetus to relate my
thoughts of my driving experience to a drawmate
on Sunday night.
He answered with a story about a friend of his
who had participated in a study of fruit-fly genet
ics. Having to count flies every day for three years
had taken its toll, and in the last month of the
trial he snapped, decorating the microscope with
fly legs.
The carnage, though scholastically immense,
was gravitationally negligible; he and his girl
friend took off for the French Riviera. Lest we

think he suffers now, he is a movie producer in
Hollywood. Fidelity to yeast isn't looking so hot.
I did some serious thinking, after talking to
my drawmate — not just about what he said, but
also about the fact that he had gone skydiving at
nine that morning (If Josh Davis' parents read
this, it was NOT him). Considering the heavy
work loads most of us carry, I think he may be
more effectively dealing with gravity.
One night last week, my roommate dreamt
that he was submerged in water, suffocating,
until he remembered that he could breathe water
and then simply inhaled. This reminded me of
how stress is dealt with in my dreams.
Work, it seems, is something dropped to the
floor with the anxiety-laden squeal of breaking
glass, and sometimes in my dreams I can fly just
by letting go of work and realizing I am lighter
than the medium in which I exist.
Enough, 1 say to myself, of my Robin Williams
impression: "Fly, be free" (or is it, "Be free of
flies?"). This is the Diversions column, and by the
end of these 4,500-odd characters, I should have
neatly wrapped up what I was trying to say,
thereby necessitating action on no one's part
(least of all my own). After all, finals are coming
up. Anything longer than two sentences is either
self-depreciating or self-righteous, and so I had
better choose the former before you choose the
latter.
So, we're done. Just remember, Stanford is an
institution people are sent to only if they are com
mitted.
See you all in the lab tomorrow.
