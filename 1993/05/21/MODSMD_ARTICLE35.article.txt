# Chandrasekaran elected editor

### Tish Williams Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
After narrowly evading the
grasp of fellow Howard Libit fan
David Schwartz, Rajiv Chan
drasekaran was named The
Daily's editor in chief for Volume
204 last night.
In an orgiastic frenzy, Daily
staffers celebrated the crowning
of the Moraga, Calif., native,
chanting his name and begging to
nibble at his belly button.
"I slept with the Editor to get
this job," said the beaming Chan
drasapien, noticeably slurring his
words after a sip of champagne.
"And I was good."
Despite a troubled childhood in
which he was allowed to eat only
peanut butter and mint jelly
sandwiches, forced into child
labor on his parents' giant-poodle
farm, Chandraganowski claims
his mental stability is at a high
point.
Chandra was led from the
Medical School by security guards
last year because of rumored
insanity.
"I like fuzzy purple dino
saurs," Chandowitz explained.
"So sue me."
Although known to have a ten
dency to be extremely lax and
low-key in his dealings around
the office, the Grand-Poobah-to
be promised to work on his slop
py, lethargic manner during his
tenure.
Chimera was elected on a plat
form promising Robin Williams at
happy hours, N'Gok beer ads and
"use of one spot color on the
front/center spread will be incor
porated into the"
"I figured I'd only make those
claims which I could back up," he
mused.
Described as "ethnic," Chang
is rumored to have a sincere
interest in maintaining the high
sexual activity level of the Edit
Board, planning to add Brady
Bunch love beads in the doorway
to the editor-in-chief s office and

mirrors on his new horne-away
from-home's ceiling.
"Listen to these numbers:
3:15, 2:40, 2:53, 3:25, 2:37, 3:10
and 3:40," Chewbaca said.
Upon his election, Chandrenev
immediately tried to kill Joel
Stein.
"Badges? We don't need no
stinkin' badges!" the swarthy
lothario was heard to mutter
through ample swigs of Maison
Deutz's $3.50 finest.
He quickly switched from

dockers and a polo shirt into plat
form shoes and a stylish Laura
Ashley creation, made by the
renowned designer especially for
the event, to the horror of his co
workers.
Chandrabaumenheimer
declared his first action in office
would be establishing good rela
tions with University President
Gerhard Casper, stating that long
back-rub sessions and scalp mas
sages would play an integral role
in this process.
