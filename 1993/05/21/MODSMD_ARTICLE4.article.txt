Marlon Brando didn't get it, but
Harvey Keitel will. ASSU Flicks will fi
nally be in Surround Sound this Sun
day.
After a year of work, setbacks and
more work, the Memorial Auditorium
sound system is complete. And today,
once the final wires are connected,

graduate student Sanford Dickert —
the ASSU senator who coordinated the
entire project — will test out the
$97,500 system.
"It's been interesting learning how
to deal with the University and its bu
reaucracy," said Dickert, commenting
on the lengthy process that led up to the
system's completion.
M I saw this as a perfect project that
could benefit a large number of people,"

he added. "That's what the ASSU is
supposed to do."
The idea to improve the sound sys
tem developed a year ago when the
ASSU found itself with an excess of re
serve funds, totalling about $300,000.
"At first, senators toyed with ideas
like refunding the money directly to
students," Dickert said. "Then we came
up with this idea — it just seemed to me
that the sound at Flicks could be im

proved dramatically with Surround
Sound," he said.
The addition of Surround Sound to
the old system substantially augments
its capabilities — giving it five channels
of sound instead of the two employed in
more traditional stereo sound systems.
"The extra channels make the sound
more precise and realistic," Dickert said.
The system marks the ASSU's
largest single expenditure of the
year — a fact that caused conster
nation among some senators ear
lier this year.
With the help of a 15-year loan
from the ASSU, Sunday Flicks
contributed $77,000 toward the
new system, the majority of its
pricetag, Dickert said. The
remaining $20,500 was paid by
contributions from the The Lively
Arts at Stanford and alumnus Ray
Dolby, Class of '57, among others.
