# A 						history of Asian-Americans
## Project traces Stanford's Asian community 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Asst. History Prof. Gordon Chang and others
working to document the history of Asian-Americans
at Stanford gave a presentation on their progress yes
terday, relating some of the personal accounts that
comprise their project.
About 20 students have been digging through
archives and contacting alumni to piece together the
Stanford Asian-American experience for this ongo
ing volunteer project.
Noting the growing interest in multiculturalism,
Chang anticipates interest among Asian-American
students who have little sense of their connection to
Stanford's history.
Chang, who began this project two years ago,
called the rising number of Asians on college cam
puses a "remarkable evolution," noting that the cur
rent Stanford student body is 24 percent Asian and
Asian-American, compared to the five Asians in his
undergraduate class at Princeton.

"It's important that Asian students feel connected
with the past," said Rick Yuen, assistant dean of stu
dents. "Most people don't know that there were six
Asian students in the first class of 1881. They don't
know that Asians weren't allowed to live in integrat
ed housing at Stanford (in the early 19005]."
Yuen is collaborating on a project about the first
Chinese clubhouse, established by the Chinese Stu
dents Association in 1924 — the first year Asian stu
dents were allowed to live on campus.
Another project underway is the Japanese-Ameri
can Reunion project, which recognizes the experi
ences of the 24 students who were sent to internment
camps in 1942. A ceremony in October and the reded
ication of Okada House, the Asian-American theme
house, will "show true appreciation for these individ
uals," said freshman David Tanaka.
"What did it feel like to be one quarter away from
graduating and not be able to finish?" asked Tanaka.
"What did it feel like to be pulled out of their school
for no apparent reason other than
[race]? . . . There are so many
questions I want answered."
Lisa Park has been looking into
Asian-American women's history at
Stanford. In the past, these women
had no outlet for self-expression,
said Park, whose research covers
the period 1945-1965.

Chang has been studying the
diaries of retired History Prof.
Yamati Ichihashi, who received
notice of his tenure while
detained in a World War II intern
ment camp. The assessment of
Ichihashi's work and a biographi
cal account of his life should be
published by the end of the year.
"There's so much interesting
material out there to be uncov
ered," said Chang. He said he hopes
this project will "show the potential
of Asian-American studies."
