# Students issue fake citations Motorists cited for 'gas guzzling violations'
## 
### Nicolas Kuritzky Staff writer 
Commuters entering Stanford
yesterday morning were amused
— and sometimes agitated — to
find 10 students passing out fake
tickets citing them for such "gas
guzzling violations" as driving
alone or driving fuel-inefficient
sports or luxury cars.
At 8:30 a.m. the group of stu
dents, who are concerned about
environmental issues, gathered at
a stop sign at the intersection of

Palm and Campus Drives to hand
out "citations" and pamphlets.
The Student Coalition for Al
ternative Transportation issued
about 250 tickets in approximate
ly 35 minutes before Stanford Po
lice asked them to stop because
they were backing up traffic.
The group's organizer, junior
Mike Brylawski, said the students
were trying to raise public aware
ness about the detriments of ex
cessive gasoline consumption and
pollution.
"People just get in their cars

and become isolated to the reali
ties around them," said Brylaws
ki. "We are not trying to be sancti
monious — we are just trying to
bring these issues to the attention
of the motorists and inform them
of other alternatives."
Citing the figures that say 60
percent of commuters to Stanford
drive alone and that 40 percent
live within five miles of campus,
the students were specifically try
ing to emphasize the need for
more carpooling and bicycling.
According to Brylawski, 90 per
cent of the motorists the students
encountered were driving alone.
"The protest was very
impromptu," explained Brylaws
ki. "We saw something needed to
be done and just did it."
The group even passed out tick
ets to three police cars. "The cops
thought it was great," said Bry
lawski. But when traffic got backed
up, the police asked themto stop.
While Brylawski noted that
most of the commuters were sup
portive of the students' cause, a
few motorists complained to Stan
ford Transportation Programs —
whose number was written on the

tickets, even though it was not
involved with the students' effort.
Jeffrey Tumlin, special projects
coordinator at Transportation
Programs, emphasized that his
department was "in no way a spon
sor" of the students' activities.
"I didn't mind our number
being on there as a resource, but it
led people to believe that we were
the sponsors," Tumlin said. "It
was a potential public-relations
disaster for us."
According to Tumlin, his office
had to deal with three irate callers,
and one who wanted more informa
tion about carpooling and bicycling.
Brylawski estimated that the
delay caused by any back-up was
about 10 seconds and apologized
for any public-relations damage
done to Stanford Public Trans
portation Programs.
