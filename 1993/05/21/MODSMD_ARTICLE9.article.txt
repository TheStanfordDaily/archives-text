'Cheers' airs final episode
NEW YORK (AP) — A nation of view
ers honored not just "Cheers," but the
passing of a television era last night.
The airing of episode No. 275, and the
weeks of hoopla leading up to it, likely
brought to a close a dynasty of great sit
coms that began with "I Love Lucy" and
"The Honeymooners" four decades ago.
In the unruly new TV world, a broad
cast series may never enjoyed win the
wide and long-term favor "Cheers"
enjoys. One-hundred million viewers
were expected to tune in the movie-length
finale, which capped 11 seasons of misad
ventures at a Boston bar.
Premiering in September 1982,
"Cheers" finished last in the ratings its
first season — and took eight years to

reach the top. It has been at or near it
every since, snagging a record 111 Emmy
nominations in that time.
Jet crash investigated
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Teams
using mules struggled yesterday to reach
a rugged Andes mountainside covered
with debris and bodies from a Colombian
jet crash that killed all 132 people aboard,
including seven Americans.
The SAM airline Boeing 727 slammed
into the nearly vertical slope of a 12,300-
foot peak on Wednesday, about 50 miles
northwest of Medellin, as it was prepar
ing to land on a flight from Panama.
Two pilots speculated that the crash
might have been caused by the loss of
radio-navigation sites blown up by leftist
guerrillas last year.
