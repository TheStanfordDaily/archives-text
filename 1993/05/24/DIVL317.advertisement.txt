AFRICAN AMERICAN
TISSUE TYPING DRIVE
Attention African American Students, Faculty and Staff:
Tlii Problem:
Hundreds of African Americans are dying from leukemia; aplastic anemia and
other blood diseases..
The Reason
They are dying because they cannot find a matching bone marrow donor.
Statistically, the chances of rinding a life-saving donor are significantly greater if
the donor is another African American. Sadly, the current pool of potential African
American marrow donors is less than 5%. As a result, only 20 African Americans
have received matching marrow transplants since 1987. In comparison, over
1,200 Caucasian Patients have received transplants.
The Solution
More African Americans need to register with the National Marrow Donor
Program. By doing so, we increase the chances of finding potentially life-saving
matches for those African Americans who are now dying.
Please do your part and give a blood sample. Remember, you can make a
difference in someone's lire!
