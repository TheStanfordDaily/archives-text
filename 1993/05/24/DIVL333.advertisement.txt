TELL US WHAT YOU THINK
SURVEY: PURCHASING OF AND PAYMENT FOR
GOODS AND SERVICES
The purpose of this survey is to gather information about how you are buying and paying for goods and services at
Stanford and to obtain your evaluation of the effectiveness of the various processes you use. The results will be
used to focus our initial activity.
Why should you take the survey:
To be successful at improving these sets of business practices, we need your input. As the primary users of these
systems, only you can tell us what's important to you, what's working well, what's not working, and where you'd
like to see improvements made. Wc will maintain the confidentiality of your responses.
The prize:
All completed surveys will be entered in a drawing. The prize: Lunch with the Business Practices Initiative
sponsor of your choice. Sponsors include: Barbara Butterfield, Vice President for Faculty and Staff Services;
Joanne Coville, Controller; David Mendelow, Associate Vice President, School of Medicine; Mike Spence, Dean,
Graduate School of Business; and Peter Van Etten, Chief Financial Officer. The five award winners will be
notified June 7th.
Taking and returning the survey:
We've designed the survey so that it will only take about 10 minutes to complete. If you've received an electronic
copy of the survey, to fill it out, simply place it in your active file by typing "active" on the action line, complete,
and return to e-mail account cr.new(a)forsythc. You can also print it locally into a hard copy form.

SECTION 1: METHOD EVALUATION
Below are several lines describing different ways that we at Stanford buy and pay for things. As a requestor, an
originator, an approver or other user, we'd like you to evaluate each method according to:
• USE: how often are you involved (scale: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Rarely, Never);
• IMPORTANCE: whether this is an important method for you
(scale: 4=Couldn't live without it,
l=Didn't know it existed); and
• SATISFACTION: your evaluation of how well this method currently works for you (scale: 4=Works great for
me, l=Does not work for me)
We've left a few blank lines for you to add any method you'd like to comment on but which we omitted.
