# Bosnia denounces new peace plan
## Region's leader says it would segregate Muslims in ethnic ghettos 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Bosnia's president slammed
Washington's peace formula yesterday,
calling it "absolutely unacceptable" and
predicting it would leave Muslims seg
regated in ethnic ghettos.
The rejection by President Alija
Izetbegovic was sure to scuttle the plan
announced in Washington on Saturday
by Secretary of State Warren M.
Christopher and the foreign ministers
of Russia, Britain, France and Spain.
The formula called for safe havens to
be set up to protect Bosnian Muslims
and for monitors to be deployed along
Bosnia's border with Serbia.
Izetbegovic said it was an attempt to
herd his people into "reservations."
"This new plan is absolutely unac
ceptable for us," said Izetbegovic, who
has seen Bosnian Serbs capture 70 per
cent of his country since Muslims and
Croats voted to secede from Yugoslavia
last year.
Croats, the Muslims' nominal allies,
have occupied much of the rest of the
country in the war, which has left more
than 138,000 people dead or missing
and 2 million homeless.
Izetbegovic called on his forces "to
use all means available to defend the
independence and sovereignty of
Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"We are not going to waste any more
time ... in futile negotiations," he said.
But some of his front-line troops in

Sarajevo, which has been besieged by
Bosnian Serbs since the war began 13
months ago, are so short of ammunition
that they are given only 12 bullets a day.
Objection to the plan also emerged
yesterday in the United States.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
said he was "deeply disappointed"
because the plan "amounts to writing
off Bosnia as a state by ratifying the sta
tus quo on the ground."
Bosnia's Muslim-led government
prefers an international peace plan
drafted by mediators Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen that would divide Bosnia
among the three warring parties —
Serbs, Muslims and Croats. Christo
pher said the Vance-Owen plan was a
blueprint to be used later.
The Muslims and Croats have
approved the Vance-Owen plan. The
Bosnian Serbs have rejected it because
it would force them to relinquish some
territory and their dreams of linking up
with Serbia, the larger of the two
remaining Yugoslav republics.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic called the latest proposal — to
be sent to the U.N. Security Council for
adoption next week — "a more realistic
approach."
Karadzic told the British Broadcast
ing Corp. that his forces would "fully
comply with the new decisions and the
resolutions of the United Nations, pro
viding that our sovereignty is respected."

A spokesman for Owen and Thorvald
Stoltenberg, who has replaced Vance as
mediator, said they accept the concept
of safe havens as long as the Vance-
Owen plan is eventually implemented.
Owen and Stoltenberg do not want to
carve out islands for the Muslims while
the rest of the country remains occu
pied by Croats or Serbs, said the
spokesman, who spoke to The Associat
ed Press in Geneva on condition of
anonymity.
The proposals made Saturday also
call for:
• the delivery of humanitarian aid;
• continuation of U.N. sanctions on
Yugoslavia until Bosnian Serb troops
withdraw from occupied territories;
• maintenance of the "no-fly" zone
intended to keep Serb planes away from
Bosnia;
• expansion of the U.N. peacekeeping
force in Macedonia, another former
Yugoslav republic, and attempts to get
peacekeepers into Serbian-adminis
tered Kosovo province, another trouble
spot in the Balkans.
On the battlefronts yesterday, there
was sporadic shelling in Sarajevo. Sara
jevo radio said three people were killed.
The radio also reported a major
artillery attack on Maglaj to the north,
but that could not be confirmed. It also
said fighting continued around Brcko
near a strategic northern corridor link
ing Serb-occupied areas.
