## Editorial Breaking deadlock 
### 
BEING A LEADER involves
making difficult choices and,
occasionally, alienating and
angering others. ASSU Senate
Chair Ron Brown will be faced with
one of these decisions this week.
In attempting to break the
deadlock over next year's chair,
Brown has attempted to broker a
compromise by stating that if,
after two more ballots, no chair
has been chosen, he will use his
tiebreaker vote to effect a decision.
While this will involve reneging on
a previous promise not to cast
such a vote, Brown's choice is a
wise choice, one which places the
goal of effective government over
pride and rigid adherence to obso
lete guidelines.
If Brown were to withhold his
vote, he would plunge the senate
into chaos (imagine that!), due to
further infighting and gridlock
among the candidates' partisans.
This would in turn cause the

already-slow operations of the
body to grind to a halt.
True, at the start of his term,
Brown did pledge never to cast a
vote in senate business. But the
procedural nightmare which has
been instigated by the recent elec
tions has left Brown no choice.
Furthermore, Brown is effectively
upholding his promise — his vote
will reflect the will of nonvoting
senators, not his own personal
choice. Therefore, Brown is mere
ly attempting to allow the full sen
ate a voice in the election of its
chair, a goal fully in accord with
the democratic process.
Brown's decision to represent
his fellow senators, and help them
resolve what could otherwise
become a festering issue, bodes
well for his Council of Presidents
tenure. Effective leadership car
ries with it personal risk, but
should also be recognized as a
benevolent force.
