# A 						pledge to brevity

### 
IN THE PAST FEW years, sever
al sororities on campus — and
across the nation — have experi
mented with shorter pledge periods.
Although there are both pluses
and minuses to shortening the time
between the end of Rush and initia
tion, one benefit clearly outshines
all negative aspects — it reduces
the amount of time in which there
could be possible hazing.
Traditional pledge periods at
Stanford vary, with most spanning
10 to 12 weeks. However, since
Rush takes place in April, this
means that initiation does not take
place until fall quarter of the fol
lowing year.
Hazing has rarely been a prob
lem among Stanford sororities,
but that does not mean that it does
not occur, or that there are not
incidences that go unreported. If
the possibility of hazing can be
reduced at all, a change should be

made. Shortening the pledge peri
od to six or eight weeks would
seemingly still allow time for
pledges to learn about the organi
zation, while also reducing the
possibility of hazing.
At the very least, sororities
should spend a year or two exper
imenting with different pledge
periods. Kappa Alpha Theta has
switched to a shorter pledge period
this year, and other sororities have
tried it in the past.
In reality, though, it is usually
fraternities which experience the
majority of hazing problems. These
groups should investigate switch
ing to a system which minimizes
the risks to its pledges as well.
Stanford's Greek system has
always had few problems com
pared to most colleges. The system
should do its best to lead the way
toward a safer, more sensible
pledging process.
