Rice's appointment to provost post a matter of concern

I FEEL AMBIVALENT about the
appointment of Condoleezza Rice as
our new provost. On the one hand, I
enthusiastically greet the appointment
of an accomplished African-American
woman to the second-highest adminis
trative position in the University.
On the other hand, I am concerned to
see a former key advisor of an adminis
tration unprecedented in its contempt of
the democratic process in foreign policy,
an administration that coined the term
"deniability" (George Bush's reference
to an essential quality of his actions in
the Iran-Contra scandal).
I am concerned to see in this key
University position an advocate of that
improbable synthesis of free markets,
"family values" and militarism which
has characterized 12 years of Republican

politics and whose devastating social,
economic, and environmental effects
we'll be reckoning with for some time to
come.
Unfortunately, when I look at Rice's
recent appointment in relation to
Sharon Parker's recent resignation as
director of the Office of Multicultural
Development, and the dismissal of the
History Department's recommendation
that Asian-American history professor
Gordon Chang receive tenure, a disturb
ing pattern begins to emerge.
Any doubts I may have had earlier
about the new administration's vision of
Stanford's future have been erased. Ger
hard Casper has made much of his inter
est in Stanford's history, and more recent
ly in the importance of American history
in general, but whose history is he refer

ring to? An article in the July-August edi
tion of the Stanford Observer provides a
clue, noting Casper's admiration of Fred
erick Terman, who became the provost of
Stanford after World War 11.
Terman used his "top-down" leader
ship style to get government money
flowing into Stanford again, after a peri
od in the 1930s and 1940s when the
University had attempted to minimize
its dependence upon government funds.
Furthermore, an article from Septem
ber of 1992 in the German newspaper
Die Zeit noted that the politicization of
UC-Berkeley in the mid-'6os, where
Casper was teaching political science,
"irritated him so violently" that he left,
accepting a position in the law school of
the University of Chicago.
Is it any surprise, then, that Casper

seems to want us to forget about the
hard-won progressive struggles of the
past 30 years, some of the fruits of
which, 5.W.0.P.5.1. for example, are
already gone?
I know that many of us do not want
to see Stanford return to the days prior
to institutionalized women's, ethnic and
environmental studies, or before affir
mative action and need-blind admis
sions.
Even though we are busy preparing
for finals, we must refuse the passive
role allotted to us and demand that we
be included in the decision-making pro
cess and that the present administration
clearly articulate to us its vision of the
future.
