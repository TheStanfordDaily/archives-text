# Commission may need summer to finish work, wants students' input
## 
### 
Four students have written to express
their concerns about student involve
ment in the work of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education which I
announced in my State of the University
address.
As I said in my speech, the Com
mission will involve students, togeth
er with faculty, academic staff and
alumni. As I also said, I will announce
the membership of the Commission
after consulting with the present and
incoming provosts and deans of
Humanities and Sciences, and with
the Dean of the School of Engineer
ing. Since appointments of the new
provost and dean have only just been
made, consultations could not take
place until now. The Commission will
be named before the end of the aca-

demic year. Students who are inter
ested in participating may write to me
or notify the ASSU Nominating Com
mittee, which has been asked to sub
mit recommendations for the Com
mission.
In their open letter, these four stu
dents also express their concerns about
the fact that the Commission will
undertake its work during the summer.
T do hope that some preliminary work
can begin this summer, realizing that
it will be a difficult time for both stu
dents and faculty. But if the Commis
sion's work will take a full year, as I
anticipate, a summer cannot be avoid
ed.
The bulk of the work will necessarily
take place during the academic year. I
hope to have a report issued by July 1,
1994, precisely so that it will be available
for comment and debate with the begin
ning of the new academic year. It will
not be the kind of report which should
or could be implemented immediately
without extensive campus-wide discus
sion.

The Commission presents an oppor
tunity for all members of the University
to join in an open and lively debate
about the central purposes of the insti
tution. Every effort will be made to
structure the Commission in a way that
encourages wide participation.
