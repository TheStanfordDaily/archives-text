# COP cabinet will help, not hinder, Stanford's students, government
## 
### 
On our first day in office, the Daily
editorial board criticized our first
action — the creation of an Executive
Cabinet.
The ASSU has been criticized for
many things, but never before for get
ting too many people involved.
We would like to clarify some mis
conceptions about the Cabinet. The
purposes of the Cabinet are the follow
ing:

• To increase two-way communication
between the ASSU student government
and the students. For example, the com
munications director will be organizing
town meetings in dorms, producing cur
rent ASSU updates, and running polls
and focus groups.
• To expand outreach to administra
tors at all levels of the University. The
residential life director, for example, will
be meeting with housing officials to help
us create a viable solution to summer
storage.
We are creating a Cabinet today to
help us better serve the campus
throughout the year.
Past precedent for this exists. Former
COPs hired full-time interns, paid on an
hourly salary. Instead of hiring paid
interns, we searched for committed vol
unteers who share our passion for
improving student life.
