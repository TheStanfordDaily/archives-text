# COP: chances are slim for reduced-cost bike storage
## Practical solution sought for summer storage 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
With summer vacation rapidly appo
raching, the Council of Presidents admit
ted yesterday that chances are slim for a
quick remedy to the recent bicycle storage
price hike.
The COP hopes to "work out some solu
tion" about the price of bike storage, which
has tripled this year to $30, said COP mem
ber Ying-Ying Goh.
Bike storage "is something that is over
whelmingly used by almost every student,"
Goh said. "I don't think students will find
I the new pricel acceptable."
However, having learned about this de
cision only last week, Goh hinted that it
may be difficult for the COP to change the
new policy so quickly.
"The problem is that the decisions were

made, and we didn't know about it. It's
hard to influence decisions after they're
made," she said, adding that the COP
"hopefs] to learn more about the details of
the changes" through upcoming meetings
with University administrators.
"We're going to try to talk to people and
find out exactly what happened and why
there's a $30 change," Goh said.
She said she was unsure about the likeli
hood of changing the price of campus bike
storage this year since the COP has not had
a chance to speak with administrators on
this issue yet.
But so far, according to COP member
Jason Snyder, the chances that students will
have to pay $30 this year "are pretty high."
Several students who have already rent
ed off-campus storage space for their other
belongings said they now intend to
store their bicycles there as well,
in order to avoid the price hike.
The COP is making bike stor
age "just as high a priority" as
other summer storage, Goh said.
The ASSU has been trying — so
far unsuccessfully — to find a
place for students to store their
belongings since the University
announced it will no longer
allow students to leave items in
dorm storage because of budget
cuts.
The ASSU has also explored
the option of renting trucks for
students to drive and transport

their belongings to off-campus
storage facilities. But "we can't
have students driving trucks
(rented by the ASSU). ... There's
too much liability — it just
wouldn't work."
Goh is working on a storage
plan for next summer with a
warehouse owner in San Francis
co who is willing to provide trans
portation to and from his facility,
but so far, she said, "it just
doesn't seem very practical."
Sophomore Jim Ho said he
doubted the ASSU would be effec
tive in decreasing the price of bike
storage.
"The ASSU had no involve
ment with the regular storage
issue, and their only proposal was
canned," he said.
