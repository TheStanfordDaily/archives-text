## Cut, fade out to frisbee dog 
### 
WHEN I WAS a camp counselor
last summer, I met a three year
old kid named Nathaniel who
would confuse the words "you" and"I."
This made it difficult to understand him.
"You have to go the bathroom," he'd cry.
"No, no, Nathaniel," I'd answer, "I'm
fine. It's 0.K."
And then Nathaniel would end up wet
ting his pants, because what he really
meant was, "/ have to go to the bath
room."
I've written a one-act play with
Nathaniel as the main character. Here it
is:
SCENE: A summer camp in the moun
tains. A counselor is talking to a little kid.
The counselor is unaware of a giant griz
zly bear towering behind him.
NATHANIEL, (pointing.) There's a bear
behind me! There's a bear behind me!
COUNSELOR, (reassuring.) There,
there, Nathaniel, it's O.K. There's no
bear behind you.
NATHANIEL, (terrified, screaming)
There's a bear behind me!
COUNSELOR. Come on, N-
Bear devours counselor.
Curtain.
I mention Nathaniel as the sun goes
down on my career as a columnist,
because it suddenly strikes me: What if

no one has understood my "message" all
these weeks?
What if I, like Nathaniel, have failed to
get the right meaning across? What if,
after seeing my column several times,
readers are still wondering, "What's up
with this guy?"
So I'll lay my cards down on the table
and reveal my hidden project. Here goes:
The first letters of all my columns this
year, when arranged chronologically by
the date that each column appeared,
spell out the name of a hidden location
where I've buried a box full of money and
jewels.
Had everyone figured that out
already?
That's what I've been "up to" this
whole time.
Of course, there's more. But I'm wary
of reflecting on my experience as a colum
nist because I've seen too many colum
nists fall into the trap of nostalgia. At the
end of their stints, at the end of the year,
they picture themselves, as it were, at the
edge of a lake.
The sun is going down, and the sky is
awash with the golden hues of pensive
reflection. They remember the good
times and the bad times, they wax senti
mental on their brief journalistic
careers.
This is an end for me, and you may be
approaching an end as well. The school
year is over. Perhaps you are graduating.

You might start feeling sentimental and
reflective, too. But I won't get nostalgic
on you. I don't want to turn your head to
the past — I want to compel you forward.
In good nostalgic fashion, I'll go ahead
and stand on the edge of the lake with
you at sundown.
But instead of getting misty-eyed as
the last rays of light glint of the water,
imagine a Frisbee whizzing toward the
horizon.
The Frisbee represents the spinning
activity of the school year— it hovers, it
slows, it descends toward the lake.
But then, just as that Frisbee is almost
in the water, a great, panting, black
Labrador bounds into the lake, splashing
apart this serene, nostalgic picture.
The dog smothers the plastic disc in
his great, slobbery jaws.
He huffs and puffs and bulldozes back
out of the lake, and shakes the water
from his shiny coat. Then he sprints into
the sunset.
And here is my final message to you:
Don't look back. Follow that dog!
Go get 'im!
Go get 'im!
