## Kurth focuses on tennis success 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
She might speak softly, but
beware. She carries a big stick.
Actually, it's a stick with a
wide face and a Wilson emblem
on it, which makes Kristine
Kurth particularly intimidating
in the confines of Stanford Ten
nis Stadium. Kurth rolled over
opponents this year with a combi
nation of blistering ground
strokes and a knack for waiting
for her opponent to make all the
mistakes. Patience, they call it.
"I used to be a very impulsive
player," Kurth admits. "I would
just want to get the point over
with, so I would make error after
error. Now, I'm a lot better at
waiting for good shots and I stay
in the game mentally, and that's
definitely helped my game."
Kurth began playing tennis at
the "late" age of eight, after mim
icking her parents' play on family
vacations. She remembers that
she never made a conscious deci
sion to play tennis seriously, but
just enjoyed the game.
"I think senior year of high
school was the first time I
thought, 'Hey, maybe I can play
this in college,' " Kurth said.
"Before that I played for fun — if
it wasn't fun, I wouldn't have
kept playing."
Kurth attended William and
Mary in 1990-91, her freshman
year of college, but found that she
was not happy there and trans
ferred to Stanford last year. The
change made all the difference in
the world for Kurth.
"I was like, 'Wow, I'm playing
at Stanford,' " Kurth said.
"Everyone here plays great ten
nis, so I was kind of intimidated
when I first got here."
Her fear didn't last long, how
ever, as Kurth rose as high as No.
9 in the national rankings in her
first year with the Cardinal.
Kurth's future seemed bright,
until a back injury sidelined her
midway through the season.
"I was having muscle spasms
on both sides of my back, and no
one could figure out what it was,"
Kurth said. "They took MRIs and
X-rays and couldn't find any
thing."
Kurth recalls playing through
the pain for the latter half of the
1991-92 season. "It was really bad
for a while — I would have to

serve underhand sometimes," she
said. "I couldn't do anything."
Eventually, doctors deter
mined that Kurth had suffered a
hairline fracture in one of her
vertebrae as a result of a bad
twist on a serve. Though a poten
tially serious injury, Kurth's frac
ture was away from the spinal
cord and did not pose further
problems after healing.
This year, Kurth was back at
full strength and started at the
No. 4 singles position for the Car
dinal. She has climbed back up to
No. 33 in the national rankings,
and is happy to be somewhere
other than the doctor's office.
"I've been improving a lot this
year — I'm happy with how my
play has come along," Kurth said.
"Now I've been able to concen
trate on improving my footwork
and speed at the net/'
In addition to working on her
foot speed, Kurth spent this year
refining her serve, an area in
which her game has sometimes
suffered.
"Serving has always been a
problem for me," Kurth said. "I
definitely need to keep working
on it next year, since it's not
where I want it to be yet."
The mental aspect of Kurth's
game also took strides this year,
guided along by coach Frank
Brennan.
"He [Frank] always empha
sizes the mental part — the
aggression, composure and atti
tude," Kurth said. "They're
important in helping me win
matches."
Although Kurth steadily
improved in dual-match play this
season, she notes that her best
performance of the year, by far,
came exactly when she wanted it
to — at the 1993 NCAA Champi
onships.
"The NCAAs were a big jump
for me, in terms of my play,"
Kurth said. "I was hitting with a
lot more topspin, and my serve
just clicked."
Unfortunately for Kurth and
the Stanford women's tennis
team, however, the Cardinal
returned home without a NCAA
title for the second year in a row,
upended in the final match for
the first time ever by upstart
Texas. Kurth admits the team
had a difficult time dealing with
the premature end of its season.
"It's hard — it's very hard,"

Kurth said. "When you win so
many titles [at Stanford], every
one expects you to win. When we
heard that this was the first time
Stanford had lost a final match, it
made us feel even worse."
Overall, however, Kurth car
ries with her many positive mem
ories from this season. "It was
definitely a success — we were
dominating teams below us in
the tournament, and we only lost
by a couple matches against
Texas."
Among the positive images

Kurth will bring out of 1993 are
the close friendships between
team members on this year's ver
sion of the Cardinal tennis squad.
"It's been really tight on the
team — we're all real close,"
Kurth said. "This year, everyone
contributes — it's a good atmo
sphere to play in."
As for Kurth, there are profes
sional aspirations, even as a
junior. "Of course I'd like to go
pro someday — it would be silly
to devote this much of my life to it
and not even try," Kurth said.

Kurth recalls playing through
the pain for the latter half of the
1991-92 season. "It was really bad
for a while — I would have to

serve underhand sometimes," she
said. "I couldn't do anything."
Eventually, doctors deter
mined that Kurth had suffered a
hairline fracture in one of her
vertebrae as a result of a bad
twist on a serve. Though a poten
tially serious injury, Kurth's frac
ture was away from the spinal
cord and did not pose further
problems after healing.
This year, Kurth was back at
full strength and started at the
No. 4 singles position for the Car
dinal. She has climbed back up to
No. 33 in the national rankings,
and is happy to be somewhere
other than the doctor's office.
"I've been improving a lot this
year — I'm happy with how my
play has come along," Kurth said.
"Now I've been able to concen
trate on improving my footwork
and speed at the net/'
In addition to working on her
foot speed, Kurth spent this year
refining her serve, an area in
which her game has sometimes
suffered.
"Serving has always been a
problem for me," Kurth said. "I
definitely need to keep working
on it next year, since it's not
where I want it to be yet."
The mental aspect of Kurth's
game also took strides this year,
guided along by coach Frank
Brennan.
"He [Frank] always empha
sizes the mental part — the
aggression, composure and atti
tude," Kurth said. "They're
important in helping me win
matches."
Although Kurth steadily
improved in dual-match play this
season, she notes that her best
performance of the year, by far,
came exactly when she wanted it
to — at the 1993 NCAA Champi
onships.
"The NCAAs were a big jump
for me, in terms of my play,"
Kurth said. "I was hitting with a
lot more topspin, and my serve
just clicked."
Unfortunately for Kurth and
the Stanford women's tennis
team, however, the Cardinal
returned home without a NCAA
title for the second year in a row,
upended in the final match for
the first time ever by upstart
Texas. Kurth admits the team
had a difficult time dealing with
the premature end of its season.
"It's hard — it's very hard,"

Kurth said. "When you win so
many titles [at Stanford], every
one expects you to win. When we
heard that this was the first time
Stanford had lost a final match, it
made us feel even worse."
Overall, however, Kurth car
ries with her many positive mem
ories from this season. "It was
definitely a success — we were
dominating teams below us in
the tournament, and we only lost
by a couple matches against
Texas."
Among the positive images

Kurth will bring out of 1993 are
the close friendships between
team members on this year's ver
sion of the Cardinal tennis squad.
"It's been really tight on the
team — we're all real close,"
Kurth said. "This year, everyone
contributes — it's a good atmo
sphere to play in."
As for Kurth, there are profes
sional aspirations, even as a
junior. "Of course I'd like to go
pro someday — it would be silly
to devote this much of my life to it
and not even try," Kurth said.
