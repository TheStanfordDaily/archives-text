# Cocotos, Flanagan drop doubles final
## Unseeded pair falls short of NCAA title 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team
had a surprisingly successful
weekend at the NCAA Men's
Tennis Championships in
Athens, Ga. "If you'd have asked
me last week if we'd still be here
on Sunday, I'd have laughed,"
said coach Dick Gould.

'We knew we could
beat anyone in the
tournament if we
caught 'em on an off
day. We weren't really
expecting too much
or too little.'

But there they were, juniors
Chris Cocotos and Michael
Flanagan, playing for the
national doubles title. Although
they lost in three sets (7-5, 2-6,
1-6) to Florida's David Blair and
Mark Merklein, the Stanford
pair have nothing to be upset
about.
In the three rounds prior to
the final, the pair lost serve only
once in seven sets, and neither is
known for his outstanding
serves. "In championship com
petition that is pretty remark
able," Gould said.
The weekend actually began
with singles competition on Fri
day. In the third round, junior
Vimal Patel was defeated by
USC's No. 2 player, David
Ekerot, 2-6, 4-6.
Flanagan also lost in the third
round to David Draper of Texas.
After Flanagan grabbed an early
lead, Draper picked up the
momentum and split sets.
Flanagan was up 4-0 in the third
set but lost serve. This gave
Draper a bit more confidence,
enough to win the match 1-6, 6-
2, 6-4.
In doubles, Cocotos and
Flanagan notched a solid 6-3, 6-
4 win over Ekerot and the Tro
jans' Andras Lanyi in the third

round on Friday.
The following day, the tan
dem scored a big victory over an
upstart Pepperdine pair, Cary
Lothringer and Ari Nathan, who
had eliminated top-seeded Juan
Carlos Bianchi and Rick Witsken
of Alabama in the first round.
The Cardinal captured the
first set against Pepperdine, 6-4,
but the Waves came storming
back to capture the second set,
6-2. At 1-1 in the third set, Coco
tos was serving at 0-40 and Pep
perdine was still on a roll.
"Somehow we pulled that one
out," Cocotos said. "We played a
few real good points, and then
they missed a shot." Cocotos
held serve and Stanford rolled to
a 6-4 third-set victory.
"They were definitely one of
the better unseeded teams in the
tournament," Cocotos said.
Moving through the draw on
Saturday afternoon, Stanford's
next victim was host Georgia's
Jamie Laschinger and Albin
Polonyi. The Bulldogs were "big,
monster guys with big serves,"
according to Gould, but the Car
dinal prevailed again, 7-6, 7-6 to
capture a spot in the champi
onship match.
"We knew we could beat any
one in the tournament if we
caught 'em on an off day," said
Cocotos, who won the NCAA
Doubles Championship last year
with Alex O'Brien. "We weren't
really expecting too much or too
little."
The top three doubles seeds
had all made early exits with
various ailments due to the heat
or injuries incurred during sin
gles play. This paved the way for
Stanford and Florida (both
unseeded) to reach the final.
"Everything seems to be
clearing the way," Cocotos said
Saturday night. "We're two
teams, fresh and ready to play."
And play they did, for three
tough sets. After a big first set
victory, the Cardinal's serve
began to waver and the Gators
seized the opportunity.
"Their strength is service
return," Gould said. "They
started steamrolling and just
really took it to us. Our strength
is moving a lot, and that's hard
to do on second serves."
