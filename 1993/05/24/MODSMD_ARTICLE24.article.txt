# Track takes eighth at Pac-10 Championships

Championship teams are not created
overnight â€” and as the Cardinal
humbly bowed out to its stronger rivals
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships this weekend in Berkeley, it
quickly came to understand this fact.
The two-day conference finals saw
perennial track powerhouse UCLA
crowned as both the men's and
women's Pac-10 team champion, with
scores of 170 and 146, respectively.
Stanford did not fare nearly as well, as
the Cardinal garnered eighth place in
both categories with scores of 26 and 23.
No one doubted the eventual out
come, as the Cardinal squad had
focused on individual rather than team

performances during this rebuilding
season.
"Sometimes you have to take a cou
ple of steps backwards before you can
take steps forward," said coach Vin
Lananna. "Right now, we're competing
at these championship meets, looking
for strong individual performances,
because those are going to be the foun
dations of our future."
Despite the overall results of the
meet, Stanford did impress with its
abundance of young talent. On the first
day, veteran Dave Scudamore gave the
Cardinal its first points with a strong
second-place finish in the 10,000
meters, crossing the line at 30 min
utes,l3.B9 seconds. Scudamore, the
favorite to win the event, was edged out
by Arizona's Jimmy Rodriguez, who ran

to a 30:08.68 finish.
Long jumper Jason Robinson also
suffered a near miss, as he leaped to a
lifetime-best mark of 24-feet-5 3/4 and
a solid third-place finish. "I jumped that
on my fourth try and ended up fouling
my last two attempts, which could have
cost me the title," Robinson said.
Other highlights for the men includ
ed Jamie Marek's third-place perfor
mance in the pole vault with a final
clearance at 16-8 3/4, and John Fowler's
fourth-place showing in the hammer,
where he threw 187-9.
"I was not happy with the distance,
but I'm very happy with my standing,"
Fowler said. "I came into the meet
ranked fifth in the conference, and a
fourth-place finish is a personal victory
forme."

On Saturday, the Cardinal expected
to garner more individual medals with
Travis Clark and Rene Rodriguez com
ing up to bat. However, despite the fact
that both athletes were expected to fin
ish in the top three in their events, race
day results proved otherwise.
High jumper Clark finished in a dead
heat with five other competitors for sec
ond place (6-10 3/4), but was awarded
sixth as the jumpers were ranked on the
basis of total misses.
Rodriguez, a freshman, succumbed
to a case of inexperience and nerves as
he ran to an eighth-place fmish in the
400. His time of 48.10 was well off his
seasonal best 0f46.46, which he had run
against California two weeks ago.
