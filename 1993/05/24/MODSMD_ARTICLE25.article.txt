# Bruins take two of three, end Cardinal season
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
closed out what has largely been a
disappointing season by dropping
two of three to UCLA at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
With a 27-28 mark, the Cardinal
finished with its first losing record
since the 1964 squad went 20-24.
"Going into the season, I
thought we had a .500 team," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"But it would have been better to
start out lousy and finish strong
than to do what we did."
After winning 13 of its first 19
games, the Cardinal slumped
through the second half of the sea
son, going 13-17 after Spring
Rrpak
"It's frustrating," said Stanford
shortstop Jed Hansen. "I'd obvi
ously rather be in [UCLA's] shoes
at this point."
With postseason seed ings being
announced tomorrow, the No. 18
Bruins (35-21) are in good position
to land a high seed in the NCAA
Tournament. UCLA won 10 of its
final 12 contests and finished a
solid second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division with a
17-13 record.
The series opened promisingly
enough for the Cardinal on Friday.

Catcher A.J. Hinch led off the
home first by bouncing a triple just
inside the left field foul line and
scored when Rich Crowe doubled to
the left-center-field gap. Hinch had
five hits in the game, his second
five-hit performance of the season.
He finished the year with a team
high .350 average.
The Cardinal extended its lead
to 5-0 in the second on a pair of
two-out hits by Steve Carver and
Nate Olmstead. Stanford added
two more in the third on a Cale
Carter single and a sacrifice fly off
the bat of Hinch. Jed Hansen
tripled to open the fourth, crossing
the plate with the Cardinal's eighth
run when Olmstead doubled to
deep right field.
But Stanford starter Greg Mix,
who had allowed only a hit and a
walk through four innings, made
his exit in the fifth. After David
Ravitz led off with a clean single to
center, Mix walked the next three
Bruins he faced.
With the score 8-4 Cardinal and
Bruin runners at the corners,
freshman Todd Bartels took the
mound. After inducing cleanup
man Adam Melhuse to ground out,
Bartels gave up a two-run single to
Mike Mitchell. UCLA closed the
gap to 8-7 when Matt Schwenke

from losing two of three and enduring its first losing season In nearly 30 years.
walked with the bases loaded.
Schwenke, the best defensive
backstop in the Six-Pac, is also the
worst offensive catcher in the
league. But the junior, who brought
a paltry .232 batting average into
the weekend, acquired three free
passes in Friday's game alone.
The Bruins took a 9-8 lead with a
pair of runs in the sixth, and scored
three more in the seventh when
Ryan McGuire hit his conference
leading 24th home run of the sea
son.
But Stanford, the victim of sev
eral late-inning comebacks this sea
son, put together a comeback of its
own. Dusty Allen led off the seventh
by golfing an 0-1 pitch over the left
field fence. With the bases loaded,
Hinch made the score 12-11 with a
two-run single to left. Two batters
later, Hansen tied the score with
another single.
But it was third baseman Steve
Carver who emerged as the hero.
Carver, who committed two critical
errors earlier in the game, won the
game with an opposite-field three
run home run.
The Cardinal made it 18-13
when Hansen smacked his second
triple of the game, a bases-clearing
shot in the eighth. Hansen finished
the season with eight triples, second
on the all-time Cardinal single-sea
son triples list.
UCLA closed to 18-14 in the
ninth, but could do no further dam
age, as Dan Reed picked up his first
save of the season.
The series turned sour for Stan
ford after that. On Saturday,

Andrew Lorraine pitched in what
was probably his final collegiate
game. The team leader in both
earned-run average (4.15) and com
plete games (9), Lorraine will most
likely exit via the major-league
draft next month. His 8-6 record
reflects the poor run support he
received throughout most of the
season.
This weekend's game was no
exception. The lefty pitched well
enough to win, allowing only four
earned runs in a complete game
effort. But Stanford could manage
only a bases-loaded, two-out single
by Olmstead in the eighth, dropping
the contest 6-2. Hinch and Olm
stead each collected three hits for
the Cardinal in the game.
With the score 1-0 Bruins in the
sixth, Allen muffed an inning-end
ing ground ball, allowing two crucial
runs to score.
"We haven't played a lot of
defense all season," Marquess said.
The Cardinal committed 12 errors
on the weekend, including a season
high six yesterday.
Yesterday's game was ugly. The
pregame festivities honoring long
time Stanford pitching coach Tom
Dunton for his 22 years of service
were the one shining moment on an
otherwise dreary afternoon of base
ball.
It was an up-and-down game for
Willie Adams, who probably closed
out his Stanford career as well.
Adams lasted seven innings in a 10-
1 defeat, striking out a career-high
14 Bruins but allowing 10 hits,
including a pair of home runs.
Stanford managed few serious
scoring threats, putting across its
only run in the sixth on a Carter
double. Carter, a freshman who
slumped at the plate and was rele

gated to part-time duties in the sec
ond half of the season, finished the
year with a six-game hitting streak.
Despite the imminent departure
of Adams and Lorraine, next season
looks promising for the Cardinal.
Carter, Hinch and third baseman
Brian Dallimore, Stanford's top
three freshman prospects at the
start of the season, each finished
with a batting average over .300.
But next year's promise is hardly
consoling to Stanford, which fin
ished last in the Six-Pac with a 10-
20 mark. "It's depressing — we
know we underachieved," Hinch
said. "The big question will be
whether we can find some stuff to
build on for next season."

UCLA closed to 18-14 in the
ninth, but could do no further dam
age, as Dan Reed picked up his first
save of the season.
The series turned sour for Stan
ford after that. On Saturday,

Andrew Lorraine pitched in what
was probably his final collegiate
game. The team leader in both
earned-run average (4.15) and com
plete games (9), Lorraine will most
likely exit via the major-league
draft next month. His 8-6 record
reflects the poor run support he
received throughout most of the
season.
This weekend's game was no
exception. The lefty pitched well
enough to win, allowing only four
earned runs in a complete game
effort. But Stanford could manage
only a bases-loaded, two-out single
by Olmstead in the eighth, dropping
the contest 6-2. Hinch and Olm
stead each collected three hits for
the Cardinal in the game.
With the score 1-0 Bruins in the
sixth, Allen muffed an inning-end
ing ground ball, allowing two crucial
runs to score.
"We haven't played a lot of
defense all season," Marquess said.
The Cardinal committed 12 errors
on the weekend, including a season
high six yesterday.
Yesterday's game was ugly. The
pregame festivities honoring long
time Stanford pitching coach Tom
Dunton for his 22 years of service
were the one shining moment on an
otherwise dreary afternoon of base
ball.
It was an up-and-down game for
Willie Adams, who probably closed
out his Stanford career as well.
Adams lasted seven innings in a 10-
1 defeat, striking out a career-high
14 Bruins but allowing 10 hits,
including a pair of home runs.
Stanford managed few serious
scoring threats, putting across its
only run in the sixth on a Carter
double. Carter, a freshman who
slumped at the plate and was rele

gated to part-time duties in the sec
ond half of the season, finished the
year with a six-game hitting streak.
Despite the imminent departure
of Adams and Lorraine, next season
looks promising for the Cardinal.
Carter, Hinch and third baseman
Brian Dallimore, Stanford's top
three freshman prospects at the
start of the season, each finished
with a batting average over .300.
But next year's promise is hardly
consoling to Stanford, which fin
ished last in the Six-Pac with a 10-
20 mark. "It's depressing — we
know we underachieved," Hinch
said. "The big question will be
whether we can find some stuff to
build on for next season."

The Stanford baseball team
closed out what has largely been a
disappointing season by dropping
two of three to UCLA at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
With a 27-28 mark, the Cardinal
finished with its first losing record
since the 1964 squad went 20-24.
"Going into the season, I
thought we had a .500 team," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"But it would have been better to
start out lousy and finish strong
than to do what we did."
After winning 13 of its first 19
games, the Cardinal slumped
through the second half of the sea
son, going 13-17 after Spring
Rrpak
"It's frustrating," said Stanford
shortstop Jed Hansen. "I'd obvi
ously rather be in [UCLA's] shoes
at this point."
With postseason seed ings being
announced tomorrow, the No. 18
Bruins (35-21) are in good position
to land a high seed in the NCAA
Tournament. UCLA won 10 of its
final 12 contests and finished a
solid second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division with a
17-13 record.
The series opened promisingly
enough for the Cardinal on Friday.

Catcher A.J. Hinch led off the
home first by bouncing a triple just
inside the left field foul line and
scored when Rich Crowe doubled to
the left-center-field gap. Hinch had
five hits in the game, his second
five-hit performance of the season.
He finished the year with a team
high .350 average.
The Cardinal extended its lead
to 5-0 in the second on a pair of
two-out hits by Steve Carver and
Nate Olmstead. Stanford added
two more in the third on a Cale
Carter single and a sacrifice fly off
the bat of Hinch. Jed Hansen
tripled to open the fourth, crossing
the plate with the Cardinal's eighth
run when Olmstead doubled to
deep right field.
But Stanford starter Greg Mix,
who had allowed only a hit and a
walk through four innings, made
his exit in the fifth. After David
Ravitz led off with a clean single to
center, Mix walked the next three
Bruins he faced.
With the score 8-4 Cardinal and
Bruin runners at the corners,
freshman Todd Bartels took the
mound. After inducing cleanup
man Adam Melhuse to ground out,
Bartels gave up a two-run single to
Mike Mitchell. UCLA closed the
gap to 8-7 when Matt Schwenke

Jed Hansen makes a nice play against UCLA this weekend, but can't stop Stanford
from losing two of three and enduring its first losing season In nearly 30 years.
walked with the bases loaded.
Schwenke, the best defensive
backstop in the Six-Pac, is also the
worst offensive catcher in the
league. But the junior, who brought
a paltry .232 batting average into
the weekend, acquired three free
passes in Friday's game alone.
The Bruins took a 9-8 lead with a
pair of runs in the sixth, and scored
three more in the seventh when
Ryan McGuire hit his conference
leading 24th home run of the sea
son.
But Stanford, the victim of sev
eral late-inning comebacks this sea
son, put together a comeback of its
own. Dusty Allen led off the seventh
by golfing an 0-1 pitch over the left
field fence. With the bases loaded,
Hinch made the score 12-11 with a
two-run single to left. Two batters
later, Hansen tied the score with
another single.
But it was third baseman Steve
Carver who emerged as the hero.
Carver, who committed two critical
errors earlier in the game, won the
game with an opposite-field three
run home run.
The Cardinal made it 18-13
when Hansen smacked his second
triple of the game, a bases-clearing
shot in the eighth. Hansen finished
the season with eight triples, second
on the all-time Cardinal single-sea
son triples list.
UCLA closed to 18-14 in the
ninth, but could do no further dam
age, as Dan Reed picked up his first
save of the season.
The series turned sour for Stan
ford after that. On Saturday,

Andrew Lorraine pitched in what
was probably his final collegiate

earned-run average (4.15) and com
plete games (9), Lorraine will most
