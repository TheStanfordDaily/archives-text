# Bruins take two of three, end Cardinal season
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
closed out what has largely been a
disappointing season by dropping
two of three to UCLA at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
With a 27-28 mark, the Cardinal
finished with its first losing record
since the 1964 squad went 20-24.
"Going into the season, I
thought we had a .500 team," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"But it would have been better to
start out lousy and finish strong
than to do what we did."
After winning 13 of its first 19
games, the Cardinal slumped
through the second half of the sea
son, going 13-17 after Spring
Rrpak
"It's frustrating," said Stanford
shortstop Jed Hansen. "I'd obvi
ously rather be in [UCLA's] shoes
at this point."
With postseason seed ings being
announced tomorrow, the No. 18
Bruins (35-21) are in good position
to land a high seed in the NCAA
Tournament. UCLA won 10 of its
final 12 contests and finished a
solid second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division with a
17-13 record.
The series opened promisingly
enough for the Cardinal on Friday.

Catcher A.J. Hinch led off the
home first by bouncing a triple just
inside the left field foul line and
scored when Rich Crowe doubled to
the left-center-field gap. Hinch had
five hits in the game, his second
five-hit performance of the season.
He finished the year with a team
high .350 average.
The Cardinal extended its lead
to 5-0 in the second on a pair of
two-out hits by Steve Carver and
Nate Olmstead. Stanford added
two more in the third on a Cale
Carter single and a sacrifice fly off
the bat of Hinch. Jed Hansen
tripled to open the fourth, crossing
the plate with the Cardinal's eighth
run when Olmstead doubled to
deep right field.
But Stanford starter Greg Mix,
who had allowed only a hit and a
walk through four innings, made
his exit in the fifth. After David
Ravitz led off with a clean single to
center, Mix walked the next three
Bruins he faced.
With the score 8-4 Cardinal and
Bruin runners at the corners,
freshman Todd Bartels took the
mound. After inducing cleanup
man Adam Melhuse to ground out,
Bartels gave up a two-run single to
Mike Mitchell. UCLA closed the
gap to 8-7 when Matt Schwenke

Jed Hansen makes a nice play against UCLA this weekend, but can't stop Stanford
from losing two of three and enduring its first losing season In nearly 30 years.
