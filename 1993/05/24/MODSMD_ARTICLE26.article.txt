Men's golf
Cardinal sophomore Steve Burdick fin
ished in a fifth-place tie at the NCAA Western
Regional this weekend in Provo, Utah, and
earned the right to advance to the NCAA
Championships June 2 - 5 in Lexington, Ky.
Burdick, who competed individually
because the Stanford team failed to qualify for
the Regional, placed first among golfers
whose teams did not make the cut for the
championships. He shot a three-under-par 69
in the morning round Thursday and followed
up with one-over rounds of 73 that afternoon
and Friday morning.
Burdick's total of 215 strokes put him four
back of Arizona's Manny Zerman, whose team
won the Regional. Zerman was followed by Joe
Acosta of Fresno State, Pepperdine's Jeff Gove
and teammate David Berganio in a three-way
tie at 212.
However, as the Wildcats, Bulldogs and
Waves all qualified for Lexington, Burdick's
score stood up to NCAA standards. He will be
joined in the individual championships by
Nevada's Robert Walton, who finished one
stroke behind Burdick at 216.
Crew
Rowing in up to 30 mile-per-hour head
winds, Stanford's men's and women's crews
finished off a memorable season at the Pacific
Coast Rowing Championships in Sacramento,
Calif.
The men's varsity eight-man boat sur
prised the competition, finishing second with
a time of 6:14, four seconds behind first-place
Washington. Stanford upset California by one
second, gaining revenge after an early-season
loss at the hands of the Bears.
The junior-varsity eight struggled against
a strong headwind and came in fourth in its
final, 27 seconds behind the first-place
Huskies. The freshman eight also had diffi
culty with the conditions, finishing in sixth
place, 28 seconds off the pace of first-place
Orange Coast College.
Stanford's second-place finish earned them
a berth in the National Championships, to be
held at the Cincinnati Regatta June 11 and
12.
The women's varsity eight overcame a sea
son of injuries to place fourth with a time of
7:07, behind Washington, Cal and Washing
ton State. The Huskies crossed the finish line
in 6:50, with the Golden Bears and Cougars
finishing in 6:55 and 7:00, respectively.

and women's crew championships in tomor
