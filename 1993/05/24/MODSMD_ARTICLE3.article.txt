# Stanford operators offer more than numbers, handle crises

"I talked to Dudley Moore!" exclaimed
Stanford operator John Land. "He wanted
to know about a performance, and I was so
flustered I almost connected him to the
Athletics Department."
Although talking to movie stars is not a
regular part of their job, the University's
operators are more than just human phone
directories. They provide a paging service
for Stanford Hospital, arrange for heli
copters to respond to medical emergencies,
handle housing crises and even talk to lone
iy people stranded in elevators across cam
pus.

While one caller may ask for a number of
someone without providing a last name, di
rections to University buildings or even
just the time, the next inquiry may be a life
or-death matter.
The switchboard for the hospital is lo
cated in the same room, and all the opera
tors alternate between working the regular
public-information lines and the Medical
Center's paging service.
The paging system serves to notify doc
tors of any messages — some of which are
urgent in nature — by beeping them.
"You have to be fast and precise," said
Matt Trujillo, another operator.
"I think I enjoy helping. ... I feel
like I'm being of use."
Operators also coordinate com
munication for Life Flight, a
Stanford-based helicopter used to
transport the critically injured to
nearby hospitals.
This hustle and bustle is
tucked away in a corner of
Forsythe Hall behind a soda vend
ing machine. The calm and order
ly workplace of the operators
betrays the intense nature of
their job.
Twelve operators work the
day shift, processing about 600
calls each between 8:30 a.m. and
5 p.m. Fewer operators work
during the night hours, but each
call must still be answered effi
ciently.
The line comes in for heavy use

during September, before the
year's Directory is published,
explained Operator Services
supervisor Sharon Lalor.
Although it involves less pres
sure, the information line can
also be quite frustrating, especial
ly when the requested informa
tion is readily accessible in the
phone book.
"People don't realize we have
all these outside calls from
around the world," Phillips said.
"It's hard to tell the (Stanford)
callers to try and search for num
bers themselves."
Other times, students "don't
really know what they're asking
for. The questions are phrased
poorly, and you have to weed
through them," Land said.
"People seem to have the
impression that we know every
thing," explained operator April
Perez. "They'll ask, 'Hey, you
know that building between so
and so? How do you get there?' "

Then there are the people who
just want numbers and numbers
and more numbers. . . .
"I don't think people realize
that you've got a million calls
coming in. There's also a limit of
three numbers (to be given out),"
Perez said.
Often, the help the operators
provide goes unappreciated. "I
don't like dealing with people who
aren't very nice. Because we're
not seen, people tend to let out
their frustrations on us," Perez
said.
Trujillo added that his least
favorite thing about the job is
hang-ups. People will "take the
number and 'click,' " he said,
with a twinge of regret.
Picking up the phone when
stuck in an elevator also puts you
in contact with a Stanford opera
tor.
"The calls just never quit,"
Land said, "but that's part of the
way it works."
