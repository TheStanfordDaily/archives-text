# Draw defies common rules; Wilbur, co-ops fare better

In a Draw that seemed to break all the rules of
logic and predictability, Granada and Robert Moore
South took the top positions this year for men and
women, respectively, while many traditionally unde
sirable houses also made strong showings.
In particular, co-ops and Wilbur Hall drew consid
erably better than last year. Focus and theme hous
es, on the other hand, were relatively unpopular.
About 94 percent of students who participated in
the Draw were assigned housing, a slight dropoff
from last spring's number.
Of the 3,989 students who entered the Draw, 222
students have not been assigned to a residence — 63
more than last year. But Acting Director of the Stan
ford Housing Center Bill Georges expects all unas
signed students to receive housing by next fall.
The popularity of Robert Moore South, which
went at 200 for women and 576 for men, contrasted
sharply with Murray's weak showing, which as
sumed Robert Moore South's American Studies
focus.

Murray dropped from 2,288 for men and 1,932 for
women, to 4,665 and 4,569, respectively. Housing of
ficial Bethany Schmid said only six slots at American
Studies this year are occupied by students with a pri
ority, while all priority slots were filled last year.
Of the other focus and theme houses, Adams, Pot
ter, Schiff and Slavianskii Dom all drew worse than
last year, with Slav Dom filling just one priority
opening. In addition, new focus houses Castano and
Lantana were less popular than last year. Robinson,
which switched its focus from gender issues to envi
ronmental issues, was also less popular.
Neither Castano nor Lantana cracked 1,000 this
year, even though they both drew below 800 as new
residences last year. "Initially, at a new residence,
there's a great deal of interest," Georges explained.
According to Schmid, "After a year or two ... it
falls into place with the others."
Georges said he was not sure if many of the theme
houses, which fared poorly this year, had advertised.
"Maybe it's a one-year lull — it might be a cycle, just
like last year for co-ops."
