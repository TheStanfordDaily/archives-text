# Draw defies common rules; Wilbur, co-ops fare better
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
In a Draw that seemed to break all the rules of
logic and predictability, Granada and Robert Moore
South took the top positions this year for men and
women, respectively, while many traditionally unde
sirable houses also made strong showings.
In particular, co-ops and Wilbur Hall drew consid
erably better than last year. Focus and theme hous
es, on the other hand, were relatively unpopular.
About 94 percent of students who participated in
the Draw were assigned housing, a slight dropoff
from last spring's number.
Of the 3,989 students who entered the Draw, 222
students have not been assigned to a residence — 63
more than last year. But Acting Director of the Stan
ford Housing Center Bill Georges expects all unas
signed students to receive housing by next fall.
The popularity of Robert Moore South, which
went at 200 for women and 576 for men, contrasted
sharply with Murray's weak showing, which as
sumed Robert Moore South's American Studies
focus.

Murray dropped from 2,288 for men and 1,932 for
women, to 4,665 and 4,569, respectively. Housing of
ficial Bethany Schmid said only six slots at American
Studies this year are occupied by students with a pri
ority, while all priority slots were filled last year.
Of the other focus and theme houses, Adams, Pot
ter, Schiff and Slavianskii Dom all drew worse than
last year, with Slav Dom filling just one priority
opening. In addition, new focus houses Castano and
Lantana were less popular than last year. Robinson,
which switched its focus from gender issues to envi
ronmental issues, was also less popular.
Neither Castano nor Lantana cracked 1,000 this
year, even though they both drew below 800 as new
residences last year. "Initially, at a new residence,
there's a great deal of interest," Georges explained.
According to Schmid, "After a year or two ... it
falls into place with the others."
Georges said he was not sure if many of the theme
houses, which fared poorly this year, had advertised.
"Maybe it's a one-year lull — it might be a cycle, just
like last year for co-ops."
Indeed, cooperative houses,
benefitting from an aggressive
"outreach" campaign, "did very
well in the Draw," Georges said.
The Enchanted Broccoli Forest,
for example, vaulted from a "cate
gory 006" residence — one filled
with students who did not even
request it — to the low 2,0005,
with priority.

The undergraduate
Draw was also
marked by a surge in
popularity for Wilbur
Hall, previously the
ugly duckling of
campus residences.

Likewise, Columbae rose from
3,483 for men and 2,873 for
women to 2,480 and 1,920.
The graduate student lottery
saw demand for housing decline
in all resident categories — sin
gles, couples and families —
despite the University's increase
in graduate spaces.
Georges said all graduate stu
dents willing to accept on-campus
housing have been assigned resi
dences, yet there are still gradu
ate vacancies. It's the first time
since 1988 that there have been

vacancies in graduate housing, he
said.
The drop in demand, though,
should be a boon for some stu
dents who accepted housing in
Escondido Village. One bedroom
doubles in the East Campus high
rise have been converted to sin
gle-occupancy apartments, Geo
rges said.
The undergraduate Draw was
also marked by a surge in popu
larity for Wilbur Hall, previously
the ugly duckling of campus resi
dences. All of the houses except
Okada drew below 3,000, with
Soto rocketing from 3,680 to
2,122 for men, and from 4,688 to
2,297 for women.
The demand for Wilbur was no
doubt spurred by a planned $8
million renovation this summer,
and a new "points" board plan
option.
Alpha Sigma, a self-op, was the
least popular residence among
women, at 4,747 — a position
which Okada held last year. Bur
bank was the cutoff for men, at
4,694.
Other popular residences
include La Casa Italiana, which
jumped from 3,694 for men to a
stunning 346, and Lambda Nu, a
self-operated residence that
improved by over 1,000 spots for
both men and women with priori
ty.
The highest number drawn
was 4,998, Georges said. The low
est, 0002, was picked by junior
Rajiv Chandrasekaran.
