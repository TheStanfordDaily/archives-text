# Campus groups work to raise awareness of Bosnian conflict

While the strife-torn nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina
may be thousands of miles away from Stanford, many
students are trying to bring an awareness of the
Balkan crisis a bit closer to home.
Several student organizations such as the Balkan
Peace Committee, the Jewish Student Association
and Hillel are working to promote discussion among
the student body by sponsoring speakers and other ac
tivities.
History graduate student Kecia Albright, one of
the Balkan Peace Committee's three core members,
said the recently formed group hopes to promote bal
anced debate about the Yugoslav crisis and intends to
encourage discussion of alternatives to U.S. military
intervention in Bosnia.
"There's intense urgency on the part of the media
and government to intervene militarily," Albright
said. "Had we taken an active diplomatic role from
early on ... we wouldn't be in this situation now."
The group recently published an open letter to
President Clinton signed by 35 Stanford professors
and Hoover Institution fellows, arguing against U.S.
intervention.

History graduate student Dusan Djordevich, an
other committee member, said the group hopes to
sponsor a talk next month on the situation in Eastern
Europe by Sir Alfred Sherman, a British journalist.
The peace committee also intends to stay active
over the summer. "The problem's not going to go
away," Djordevich said.
Members of Hillel are also planning to tackle issues
surrounding the situation in Bosnia, focusing on
human rights violations.
Tonight the group will sponsor a program titled,
"Women, Children and War Crimes in Bosnia," which
will feature Muhamed Sacirbey, ambassador to the
United Nations from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Uni
versity of Michigan Law Prof. Catharine MacKinnon.
While she is widely known for her crusade against
pornography, MacKinnon is also co-founder of the
Rape-Genocide Law Project and has filed a lawsuit
against Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on be
half of two Bosnian women's groups.
The program, sponsored jointly by the Jewish Stu
dent Association and Hillel, will be held tonight in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Hillel Program Director Rebec
ca Schwartz said Hillel is sponsor
ing the forum in part because peo
ple have consistently referred to
the conflict with words like "geno
cide" and "ethnic cleansing."
"It rings a lot of bells for Jews,"
she said.
Education graduate student
Brad Blitz, who helped organized
the event, said, "We're aware of
how political decisions are made
and are not made.. .. We all share
a personal moral imperative on
this issue."
The forum coincides with a

number of demonstrations and
other events by Jewish student
groups in Britain, France and Bel
gium. Organizers will read a
statement jointly written with
these groups.
Organizers will also try to solic
it donations for relief efforts
through a UNICEF-affiliated
group, Caring for Children, to
help traumatized children in
Bosnia. The program will concen
trate on delivering teddy bears
and other toys to children.
Blitz said his organization was
not aligning itself with any par
ticular side in the Bosnian con
flict.
The peace committee also
plans to pass out literature at
tonight's forum.
