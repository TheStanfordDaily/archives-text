# Lifetime of dedication to vitamin C
## Nobel laureate Pauling seeks to prove healing properties of vitamins

Rather than depending on a blanket, like
Charles Schultz's cartoon character of the same
name, Stanford's own Linus finds security in
large doses of Vitamin C.
At age 92, Linus Pauling, a professor emeritus
of chemistry and two-time Nobel laureate, is cel
ebrating this month the 20th anniversary of his
private research institute which researches the
benefits of vitamins.
In addition to winning a Nobel prize in the '60s
for urging peace at the height of the Cold War,
Pauling is best known for his discovery of the
chemical bond that holds atoms together in mol
ecules.
But these days, Pauling has moved his scien
tific work from a University laboratory to the
Linus Pauling Institute in Palo Alto and to his
home, where he is concentrating on proving the
healing properties of vitamins.
"I'm working on another paper on vitamins
and cancer," said Pauling, adding that although
his correspondence has sometimes suffered laps
es since his retirement, his work hasn't.
He has been particularly strong in his en
dorsement of vitamin C as a means of preserving
health — a claim that many in the medical field
dispute. He credits the vitamin with helping him
overcome a bout with prostate cancer last year.
"If you want to be in good health, you'd better
take more (vitamin C) than the [recommended
daily allowance]," Pauling said, explaining that
large doses of the vitamin prevent sickness, with
out. side effects.
The scientist follows his own advice, taking
