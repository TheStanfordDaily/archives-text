# Lifetime of dedication to vitamin C
## Nobel laureate Pauling seeks to prove healing properties of vitamins 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Rather than depending on a blanket, like
Charles Schultz's cartoon character of the same
name, Stanford's own Linus finds security in
large doses of Vitamin C.
At age 92, Linus Pauling, a professor emeritus
of chemistry and two-time Nobel laureate, is cel
ebrating this month the 20th anniversary of his
private research institute which researches the
benefits of vitamins.
In addition to winning a Nobel prize in the '60s
for urging peace at the height of the Cold War,
Pauling is best known for his discovery of the
chemical bond that holds atoms together in mol
ecules.
But these days, Pauling has moved his scien
tific work from a University laboratory to the
Linus Pauling Institute in Palo Alto and to his
home, where he is concentrating on proving the
healing properties of vitamins.
"I'm working on another paper on vitamins
and cancer," said Pauling, adding that although
his correspondence has sometimes suffered laps
es since his retirement, his work hasn't.
He has been particularly strong in his en
dorsement of vitamin C as a means of preserving
health — a claim that many in the medical field
dispute. He credits the vitamin with helping him
overcome a bout with prostate cancer last year.
"If you want to be in good health, you'd better
take more (vitamin C) than the [recommended
daily allowance]," Pauling said, explaining that
large doses of the vitamin prevent sickness, with
out. side effects.
The scientist follows his own advice, taking

Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, professor emeritus of chemistry,
knows first-hand the benefits of vitamin C. He credits the vitamin
for helping him overcome a bout with prostate cancer.
18,000 milligrams of the vitamin
each day — 300 times the recom
mended daily allowance.
"I suppose it's responsible for
me still being alive and kicking at
age 92. I can't be sure. People die
at different ages," Pauling said.
"I am sure vitamin C is at least
partly responsible for me being
alive."
Pauling said critics of his
beliefs in the medical community
are merely uninformed.
"It's just ignorance. They
don't know the facts concerning
vitamin C," Pauling said. He
added that the studies he and his
associates at the institute are con
ducting on the relationship
between vitamin C and diseases,
including cancer and AIDS, will
help prove him correct.
A traditional background
While Pauling today preaches
about the benefits of vitamin C, he
began his scientific career on a
much more traditional foot at
Oregon State Agricultural Col
lege, focusing on chemistry,
physics and mathematics — what
he calls "a broad scientific educa
tion."
Later, he earned a doctorate in
chemistry and mathematical
physics.
Before coming to Stanford in
1969, Pauling taught at Oregon
State College and the California
Institute of Technology where,
he fondly remembers, freshman
chemistry was his favorite
class.
Pauling is most proud of the
research that earned him his first
Nobel Prize in 1954. "The most
important work I've done, from a
scientific nature, is the work I did
around the 1930s with the chemi
cal bond," he said.
He was the first scientist to
determine the nature of the
chemical bond which holds atoms
together in molecules, and since
that discovery, he hasn't stopped
researching.
He also discovered the molecu
lar basis of sickle-cell anemia and
a general theory of anesthesia,
before moving on to study crystal
structures, metallurgy and even
superconductivity.
But Pauling's activities
haven't been limited to the lab
and classroom.

Experimenting with peace
Since World War 11, Pauling
has been a strong advocate of
world peace and disarmament.
"Up to 1945,1 couldn't see any
way for the world to get rid of the
evil, the immorality of war," he
said. "It just seemed to me we
were stuck with it. When nuclear
weapons were created, with their
terrible destructive power, it
seemed to me a chance to get rid
of war."
During the McCarthy era,
Pauling became a leading oppo
nent of atmospheric testing of
nuclear weapons and war. Despite
accusations that he was a commu
nist, Pauling published a book
titled, "No More War!" and circu
lated a petition calling for a test
ban treaty.
"At first, I just talked about
how devastating nuclear war
would be, but then it became clear
that damage was coming just
from testing," he said.
For these efforts, he received
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962.
And Pauling contends that
even today, despite the end of the
Cold War, disarmament is not
proceeding quickly enough.
"We have gotten rid of world
wars, but we still have to deal
with the small wars between long
standing antagonists," he said,
adding that the United States
should take a leading role in pro
moting peace.
"Even President Clinton has
only decreased the military bud
get by a percentage or two," he
noted. "With the world situation
as it is and the collapse of the
Soviet Union, we should be cut
ting the budget by 10 percent or
more, not just by a few billion
here or there."
Advice for students
Although his scientific accom
plishments and his efforts toward
peace are important, Pauling said
his most important achievements
are his children, grandchildren
and great-grandchildren.
At this point in his life, Paul
ing said he has lots of advice for
students. "I say to young people,
'Think about what you like to do
and then check up to see if you
can make a living at it,' " he said.
"I recommend that young peo
ple not be too specialized," he
added. "I recommend that young
scientists learn one field compre
hensively and then familiarize
themselves with other fields."
