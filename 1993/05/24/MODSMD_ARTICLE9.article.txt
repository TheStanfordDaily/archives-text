Student killer not guilty
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - A man
who mistook a Japanese exchange stu
dent for a burglar and fatally shot him as
he approached his house looking for a
Halloween party was acquitted of
manslaughter yesterday.
The jury deliberated for 3 1/4 hours
before acquitting Rodney Peairs, 31, in a
case that drew widespread interest in
Japan.
In closing arguments yesterday, the
defense said that the way the student,
Yoshi Hattori, was acting made it reason
able for Peairs to think his life was in
danger.
Peairs acknowledged he fired the gun
but said he had no choice because he
feared for his family. Under Louisiana
law, homicide can be justified under a
variety of reasons, including what's
known as the "shoot the burglar" law
that allows a resident to protect himself
from an intruder.
Outside the courtroom, Peairs said he
would no longer use guns and, in remarks
intended for the teen's father, said, "I'm
very sorry that any of this ever hap
pened."
Hattori, of Nagoya, and his American
host were invited to a party, but got lost
and went to Peairs' door because the
address was similar and the house was
already decorated for Halloween, which

was two weeks away.
Peairs came to the door with his .44-
caliber Magnum revolver. When he saw
the teen, Peairs yelled "Freeze!" but Hat
tori kept coming. Hattori was not wear
ing his contact lenses and with his limit
ed English may have misunderstood the
word as "Please," according to testimony.
When Hattori was 4-to-8 feet away,
Peairs fired, hitting him in the chest.
Protesters target San Jose
SAN JOSE, (AP) â€” The national
leader of Operation Rescue says San Jose
will be one of seven cities targeted for
anti-abortion protests this summer.
Rev. Keith Tucci told abortion oppo
nents gathered at Family Bible Church
on Saturday that a demonstration would
begin on July 9 as part of a "Cities of
Refuge" campaign.
The 10-day campaign, expected to
focus on clinics and doctors who perform
abortions, is similar to Operation Rescue
protests that led to hundreds of arrests
in Wichita, Kan., in 1991 and Baton
Rouge, La., in 1992.
Operation Rescue organizers said
they picked San Jose because of two ordi
nances approved last year by the City
Council. One bans protests within 100
feet of a health care facility and the other
prohibits demonstrators from picketing
outside a residence.
