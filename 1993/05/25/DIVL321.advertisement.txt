The Daily welcomes letters from its readers. Letters will be published at the editor's discretion and are subject to editing. All letters must include the author's
name, phone number and Stanford affiliation, if any. Submissions with more than five signatures must designate a representative.
Letters should be turned in on a Macintosh disk in Microsoft Word format with a hard copy of the submission. Drop them at The Daily, ID Mail #2240.
