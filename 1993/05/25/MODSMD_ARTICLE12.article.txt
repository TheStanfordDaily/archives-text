Penn drops racial charges
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania dropped charges
of racial harassment against a white stu
dent who called a group of black women
"water buffalo" when they made noise
outside his dormitory.
University President Sheldon Hack
ney informed 18-year-old Eden
Jacobowitz that the school's charges
against him were being dropped because
the women withdrew their complaints
yesterday.
Jacobowitz, a freshman who has denied
the comment was racial, could have been
expelled from the Ivy League school of
22,000 students if he were found guilty.
The women, in dropping their

charges, said the judicial process had not
allowed them to tell their side of the
story, while Jacobowitz attracted a
national media audience.
Cambodians free to vote
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) - In
a surprise move, some Khmer Rouge
leaders let guerrillas and villagers in the
areas they control vote yesterday in
U.N.-organized elections despite threats
to disrupt balloting.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas in other areas
prevented people from voting, but that
did not keep Cambodians from flooding
polling stations again on the second day of
the nation's first free election in 21 years.
The election ends Friday.
