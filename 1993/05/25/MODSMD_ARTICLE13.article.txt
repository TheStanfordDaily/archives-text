# U.S. may exert force in Bosnia
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S.
commitment to protect U.N. peacekeep
ers in Bosnia suggests the use of Air
Force and Navy ground-attack jets, tak
ing American involvement a step
beyond merely policing the skies, mili
tary officers said yesterday.
Air Force F-15C fighters, equipped
for air-to-air combat but not for bomb
ing, already are helping enforce the
United Nations-imposed "no-fly" zone
over Bosnia. But the proposed U.S. role
in the new allied plan would suggest the
use of warplanes, such as the F-15E
Strike Eagle, specializing in ground
attack, officers said.
U.S. commanders in Europe also
could call on A-10 Thunderbolt ground
attack planes, the AWACS command and
control aircraft as well as a variety of
electronic warfare planes that could jam

radar signals from Serb anti-aircraft
emplacements.
At the Pentagon, officials said details
of the U.S. role are yet to be worked
out.
"They've still got to decide what it is
they agreed to," one officer said in refer
ence to the action plan announced Satur
day by Secretary of State Warren
Christopher. The officer discussed U.S.
involvement on condition of anonymity.
The U.N. Security Council must vote
on the plan worked out by the United
States, France, Britain, Russia and
Spain. It would create safe areas, or
havens, for Bosnian Muslims through
the use of U.N. peacekeepers.
The arrangement commits the Unit
ed States to use its air power to protect
the peacekeepers should they come
under attack. What has not been spelled

out is how U.S. warplanes would carry
out that mission. President Clinton has
ruled out the use of U.S. ground forces
in Bosnia.
The State Department spokesman,
Richard A. Boucher, said "we are pre
pared to protect and rescue" endangered
peacekeepers in the safe areas.
It is not clear how substantial an oper
ation the U.S. forces would be prepared
to carry out or under what circumstances
they might act.
The NATO operation, code-named
Deny Flight, that is enforcing the "no
fly" zone over Bosnia would not be ade
quate for protecting U.S. peacekeeping
forces in the proposed safe areas.
The Navy planes available for use as
part of the new U.S. role are capable of
staging about 150 bombing sorties, or
missions, a day.
