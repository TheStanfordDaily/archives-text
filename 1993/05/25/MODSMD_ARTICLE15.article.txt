## The Draw's disguise
### 
WELL, THE DRAW has
once again come and
gone. And, if one lesson
can be drawn from this year's land
rush, it's that the collective gulli
bility of the Stanford student body
has never been greater.
Wilbur — Wilbur! — Hall drew
significantly higher than resi
dences such as Murray, Stern Hall,
the Cowell Cluster houses and sev
eral other options. Undoubtedly,
the University's promises to
upgrade both Wilbur and its food
service weighed heavily in its sud
den, stunning burst of popularity.
Memo to freshmen: don't
believe everything you hear.
Wilbur will not become a paradise
come fall quarter. Or even a purga
tory. Instead, the new coating of
paint and new, "stylish" desks will
be ensconced in what still is the
most dated, poorly aged building
on campus (with apologies to the
old Chemistry Building). Modular
furniture won't increase the size
of anyone's room.

The other draw prerogatives of
students were oftentimes equally
befuddling. The success of the self
ops and co-ops in the Draw, how
ever, is not entirely a negative
result; perhaps students are final
ly realizing the financial and culi
nary advantages of fleeing Food
Service and striking out on their
own.
Of course, students probably
had fine reasons for choosing as
they did, but these choices should
be kept in mind when the mildew
starts to creep in Wilbur showers
this coming January.
Optimistically, perhaps stu
dents who drew fine numbers and
will be spending their time in
Wilbur chose to live there because
of the sense of community provid
ed by small rooms, dark corridors
and the lovely earth-tone decor.
Perhaps this sense of community
outweighed other factors such as
quality of life, living conditions
and superior food.
Nah. They just got conned.
