# Cleaning up campus
## 
### 
IT'S ALMOST Commencement
time, when proud parents will
be arriving on the Farm and
treated to a spruced-up campus,
complete with newly planted flow
ers in the Oval.
However, to Stanford's year
round residents, the campus' pre-
Commencement beautification
seems a bit reminiscent of the kid
who throws his dirty clothes
under the bed before Mom's room
inspection.
Why is it that the University
can't give its students — who have
to deal with the campus' eyesores
of weed infestation and dry, patchy
lawns year-round — the same con
sideration as their parents?
Sure, Commencement is a spe
cial time — and there's nothing
wrong with impressing the proud
parents of graduating students.

After financing a Stanford educa
tion for four years, maybe parents
need to see the pretty cardinal and
white flowers in the Quad to justi
fy the $100,000-plus they've
poured into tuition.
However, chances are by the
time parents stop and smell the
flowers, the painfully bumpy and
uneven ride down Palm Drive has
already put a damper on their first
impressions.
Perhaps the University is trying
to project a sense of Stanford tra
dition by emulating the unpaved
dirt roads that Leland Stanford,
Sr. must have traveled on.
The landscaping money the
University uses each year for Com
mencement might be better spent
on day-to-day maintenance, or —
even better — painfully necessary
repairs, such as Palm Drive.
