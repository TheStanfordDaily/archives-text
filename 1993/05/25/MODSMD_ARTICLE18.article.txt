## Graham and graduation 
### 
I'LL BE THINKING of my family at
graduation, of course. But I'll be
thinking of Gary Graham, too. He's
alive right now, but Gary Graham won't
be when we graduate on June 13. His exe
cution is planned for June 3.
I have never met Mr. Graham, and
probably never will. None of my profes
sors or classmates have ever talked to me
about him. But Mr. Graham has a lot to
do with our graduation.
Mr. Graham never had a chance to go
to Stanford, not a prayer. He didn't want
to come here. He didn't spend his high
school years — like many of us did — on
"The Crucible" or the Pythagorean theo
rem. He didn't spend them — like many
of us did — on sports, parties or Sadie
Hawkins dances, either.
He was what we were not — a bad kid.
He robbed. And then one day, a jury con
victed him of murder, even though four
people are willing to testify to his inno
cence.
The jury never heard the stories of
those four people. His death sentence was
based on the testimony of one person —
one — who said he did it. She witnessed
the crime from nearly 40 feet away and
couldn't even identify his mug shot out of
a group.
Mr. Graham went to death row. We
went to college. We sang "All Right Now"
and just last Friday at the Senior Formal,
played young aristocrats at San Francis

co's Westin St. Francis. We looked good.
As we danced at the St. Francis, Mr.
Graham saw one of his last 13 nights go
by. He now has nine left. His ending, our
beginning.
His ending is a message. A message
that might be more useful than the mes
sage to "change the world" coming from
well-intentioned politicos, authors and
television personalities at commence
ments around the nation this year. Lis
tening to those speeches about changing
the world makes me feel like the one of
the monks in "Hot Shots! Part Duex,"
who took the same oath of celibacy as his
father and his father before him. People
have been told to change the world
before.
They've been told to change the world
each and every June — and then you find
out that someone thinks humanitarian
ism means killing a doctor in Pensacola,
Florida.
You read in the paper that one Little
League player just killed another in a
post-game brawl.
If history is any lesson, we, too, will
create a world worth changing. Because,
quite simply, there are some bad kids out
there.
So maybe we should take a lesson from
a bad kid who has turned good — Gary
Graham has become a writer in jail —
and just be thankful that we're alive.
Mr. Graham's unfortunate experience

should remind us to value our own selves
first, even before we think about the rest
of the world. Because that's what should
be most important.
And if valuing ourselves means stay
ing late at the office, so be it.
If it means eating those marshmallow
bunnies during Easter, so be it. If it
means watching Jerry Lee Lewis movies
or taking a lot of religious studies class
es, fine, but get ready for the funny
looks.
And if it means changing the world —
or changing the laws of this country for
the better — I'm sure Mr. Graham would
be thankful.
College — Stanford — didn't teach us
what to value in our lives. But it sure was
a nice place for us to discover it on our
own.
So when we graduate and take the
important memories, some, like the
memory of a good advisor, will have a lot
to do with Stanford.
And others, like a mental picture of
Gary Graham, won't.
I don't think Leland would mind.

John Ford, as does Sam Malone, feels
like "the luckiest son of a bitch in the
world. " Thank you all.
