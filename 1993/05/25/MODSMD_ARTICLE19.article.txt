Daily article misrepresents nature of community efforts

THIS LETTER IS written as a com
mentary on your article "A life of
service: Senior Priya orga
nizes East Palo Alto Outreach."
When we were informed that an arti
cle about our work in East Palo Alto was
to be featured in The Daily, we were
honored and excited about the prospect.
We are currently counselors at Links to
Positive People-Center for Community
Change, an out-patient substance abuse
treatment program, and we are in the
process of founding Free at Last, a resi
dential treatment program to be based
in East Palo Alto.
When we read the article, although
we felt honored by the recognition, we
also were disappointed, frustrated and
angry. The article was an example of
poor journalism in its incorrect facts,
misquotes and a lack of accurate tran
scription; however, more importantly,
the article misrepresented the philoso
phy of our work. We do not feel it was an
intentional or calculated affront, but
rather a systemic problem.
First, there are several technical
errors in the article, including misquotes
and quotes out of context. The most
glaring is the description of our first
encounter: Haji bcir.g intimidated by a
"big, black man." This quote was taken
out of a portion of the interview where
contrasted the discrimination expe
rienced by a minority with "light skin,
long hair and a standardized education"
with that of a "big, black man who has a
non-traditional education."
This description was spliced into the
story of our first meeting, inaccurately

representing of the dynamics of race and
gender in our work. The emotion of
"intimidation" is the writer's projection.
This dangerous stereotyping of race
dynamics jeopardizes the integrity of our
work.
A few more points: Clay's quote was
also taken out of context, Haji's home
town is not primarily African American,
but also Hispanic and white; it's point
less to continue listing them. Why did so
many errors occur in one relatively
short article? The interviewer did not
use a tape recorder and did not take
adequate notes. Consequently, the facts
were represented inaccurately and out
of context. The article was no longer a
reflection of the interview, but of the
writer's memory.
This is poor journalism, and some
thing that The Daily is accused of all too
often. To eliminate such poor journal
ism, perhaps The Daily should enforce
more stringent journalistic techniques.
Further, the article perpetuated a
destructive and inaccurate model of infe
riority and superiority. There are several
different ways that this thinking operat
ed in the article.
The writer established a hierarchy
established between the "community
person" (Lewis) and the "university per
son" (Haji). The "big black man" com
munity person has "spent time in both
prison and in the community"; he brings
the contribution of "connections to the
East Palo Alto community." The writer
flippantly depicts the institutional per
son as a "patron saint rushing to save
East Palo Alto," bringing "connections

to education and institutional
resources."
This false representation ignores that
we both bring community connections,
our own educations and access to insti
tutional resources. The traditional con
ceptions of "education" and "contribu
tion" become dysfunctional over-simpli
fications in the context of community
recovery.
This concept of superiority pervades
the description of Haji's participation in
Free at Last. "After a few years of run
ning the program — it's off to law, med
ical, or business school — whichever
proves most useful to fulfill her goals for
the community." First, one person could
not do this, not even a Stanford super
student. Free at Last is run by a seven
member board. Second, it's not about
"her goals for the community." It's
about the community's goals for the
community, and then, get-in where you
fit-in. The paradigm of the capitalist
education — accumulating titles for the
resume, making A's — is not applicable.
This is community recovery, not individ
ual progress.
The writer's superiority and inferior
ity framework also misrepresented our
personal and professional struggles.
She labels our clients as "drug abusers
and victims of sexual abuse," Haji as "a
victim of sexual abuse" and Lewis as
"having spent time in prison." This
focuses on where people have been, cat
egorizing them as pitiful, social cast
aways.
Reconsider. We are in recovery, fac
ing, walking through the struggles. It is

not so simple. The safe hierarchy falls
apart. What part of each of us is strug
gling, and how few have the courage to
enter recovery?
This framework of superiority and
inferiority is common in The Daily. It
was apparent in the "Night and Day"
photo spread, in the common articles
about "service to East Palo Alto." As
Prof. Sylvia Wynter says, as long as we
operate in a colonial paradigm where
the superior —educated, wealthy,
employed, white — are defined in
opposition to the inferior — unedu
cated, poor, unemployed, non-white —
we are trapped. In this logic there is
no community recovery. How do we
deconstruct this and build a new logic
that gives us a future with room for
everyone?
It is necessary to recognize that this
hierarchical and destructive logic over
laid the article. We may look like the
convict and the college student, but we
challenge you to realize that there's
much more to it. We take this article as
a sign that we are doing our job. The
language and the logic of the system no
longer accurately describe our work; we
have begun to create change through
action.
This does not absolve the press of
responsibility. If The Daily wants to
report accurately on issues of social
change, they need to become aware of
their own biases and realize the destruc
tive consequences of misrepresentation.

reflection of the interview, but of the
writer's memory.
This is poor journalism, and some
thing that The Daily is accused of all too
often. To eliminate such poor journal
ism, perhaps The Daily should enforce
more stringent journalistic techniques.
Further, the article perpetuated a
destructive and inaccurate model of infe
riority and superiority. There are several
different ways that this thinking operat
ed in the article.
The writer established a hierarchy
established between the "community
person" (Lewis) and the "university per
son" (Haji). The "big black man" com
munity person has "spent time in both
prison and in the community"; he brings
the contribution of "connections to the
East Palo Alto community." The writer
flippantly depicts the institutional per
son as a "patron saint rushing to save
East Palo Alto," bringing "connections

to education and institutional
resources."
This false representation ignores that
we both bring community connections,
our own educations and access to insti
tutional resources. The traditional con
ceptions of "education" and "contribu
tion" become dysfunctional over-simpli
fications in the context of community
recovery.
This concept of superiority pervades
the description of Haji's participation in
Free at Last. "After a few years of run
ning the program — it's off to law, med
ical, or business school — whichever
proves most useful to fulfill her goals for
the community." First, one person could
not do this, not even a Stanford super
student. Free at Last is run by a seven
member board. Second, it's not about
"her goals for the community." It's
about the community's goals for the
community, and then, get-in where you
fit-in. The paradigm of the capitalist
education — accumulating titles for the
resume, making A's — is not applicable.
This is community recovery, not individ
ual progress.
The writer's superiority and inferior
ity framework also misrepresented our
personal and professional struggles.
She labels our clients as "drug abusers
and victims of sexual abuse," Haji as "a
victim of sexual abuse" and Lewis as
"having spent time in prison." This
focuses on where people have been, cat
egorizing them as pitiful, social cast
aways.
Reconsider. We are in recovery, fac
ing, walking through the struggles. It is

not so simple. The safe hierarchy falls
apart. What part of each of us is strug
gling, and how few have the courage to
enter recovery?
This framework of superiority and
inferiority is common in The Daily. It
was apparent in the "Night and Day"
photo spread, in the common articles
about "service to East Palo Alto." As
Prof. Sylvia Wynter says, as long as we
operate in a colonial paradigm where
the superior —educated, wealthy,
employed, white — are defined in
opposition to the inferior — unedu
cated, poor, unemployed, non-white —
we are trapped. In this logic there is
no community recovery. How do we
deconstruct this and build a new logic
that gives us a future with room for
everyone?
It is necessary to recognize that this
hierarchical and destructive logic over
laid the article. We may look like the
convict and the college student, but we
challenge you to realize that there's
much more to it. We take this article as
a sign that we are doing our job. The
language and the logic of the system no
longer accurately describe our work; we
have begun to create change through
action.
This does not absolve the press of
responsibility. If The Daily wants to
report accurately on issues of social
change, they need to become aware of
their own biases and realize the destruc
tive consequences of misrepresentation.
