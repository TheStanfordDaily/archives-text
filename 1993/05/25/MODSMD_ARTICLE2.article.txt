# Speakers call for action in Bosnia
## Bosnian ambassador decries lack of U.S. intervention 
### Jake Dorman Staff writer 
Drawing parallels to the Holocaust,
speakers at a forum last night focused on
the mass rape and genocide in Bosnia and
the international community's apathy
toward the ongoing war.
Bosnian Ambassador to the United
Nations Muhamed Sacirbey, University
of Michigan Law Prof. Catherine MacK
innon and Philip Cohen of the Bosnian
mission to the U.N. spoke at the event, ti
tled "Women Children and War Crimes
in Bosnia."
"We must emphasize that what is at
stake in Bosnia is the concept of a multi
cultural, diverse, democratic state,"

Sacirbey told the audience of about 200
people by way of a live telephone hookup.
An emergency meeting of the Organiza
tion of Islamic Countries kept him in
New York.
All the speakers stressed that the
Bosnian conflict is not a civil war.
Rather, they said they feel the war is a
Serbian campaign of mass rape and geno
cide, in which the primary targets are
civilian men, women and children.
Sacirbey said foreign governments
have been willing to define the conflict as
a civil war or a religious war because they
do not want to be compelled to take
stronger steps to stop it.
"The victims have their ethnicity used
as a weapon against them. It is not the

reason for the conflict," he said, adding
that although Bosnia is a multiethnic
country, the world would not be as hesi
tant to intervene if there were predomi
nantly Christian rather than Muslim vic
tims.
"There's no doubt whatsoever that
aggression comes expressly from one
side," said MacKinnon, co-founder of the
Rape-Genocide Law Project. She has
filed a lawsuit against Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic on behalf of
Bosnian women and children who have
been subjected to Serbian rape camps
and other war crimes.
"This rape is to everyday rape what
the Holocaust was to anti
semitism," she said.
MacKinnon described the first
hand accounts of women sur
vivors of "rape-death camps" who
were raped by Serbian soldiers in
order to produce allegedly ethni
cally Serbian babies.
"The idea is the radicialization
of culture," MacKinnon said. "It
is a further step in what the Nazis
had in mind.
"In other words," she contin
ued, "now politics are genetic.
There's the idea that through the

sperm ... the baby is going to be
a Serb baby, when in fact to be a
Serb is only cultural."
Sacirbey criticized the lack of
international support for a
peace plan and called the U.S.
plan to provide air support for
U.N. peacekeeping troops "short
term in nature," saying that it
fails to confront Serbian aggres
sion.
"It is ironic that in this
instance it seems it's more impor
tant to protect the protectors
than to protect the people the pro
tectors are supposed to protect,"
he said.
The ambassador predicted that
the Vance-Owen plan to designate
safe areas for specific ethnicities

in Bosnia would create ethnic
ghettos and "make the status quo
a longer-term reality."
Hillel, a Jewish student organi
zation, and the Jewish Student
Association sponsored the forum.
Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun said the
Jewish groups hosted the speech
because the situation in Bosnia
contains "echoes of the Holo
caust."
"The Bosnian situation res
onates for Jews," Cartun said.
In addition to the discussion,
the forum included a reading of a
Bosnian woman's description of
her experience in a Serbian rape
camp and a 15-minute video pre
sentation entitled "Bosnia: The
Untold Story."
