Food Service and Facilities waste money while pleading poverty

IT WAS GOOD TO SEE The Daily
question how Food Service was
spending student money on the lav
ish Spring Food Faire.
Unfortunately, it appears that this is
not an isolated case. During this aca
demic year, Food Service management
has indulged itself by using University
funds frivolously. This can also be said
of Facilities management, of which Food
Service is a subordinate part. This over
spending has occurred at the same time
that Food Service, backed by facilities
management, is slashing student ser
vices and justifying the cuts by pointing
to the bad budgetary situation. The com
bination of over-spending on manage
ment projects and reductions in student
services threatens to make Food Service
— and Facilities — management lack
credibility.

Where is this over-spending occur
ring? For one, on public-relations gim
micks like the Food Faire. But, sizable
sums of money were also spent this year
on an ultra-expensive holiday party for
Food Service employees at the Faculty
Club; on providing fancy dinners and
food for various housing directors meet
ings; and on attendance by many Food
Service and facilities managers at a wide
range of conferences (with super-expen
sive registration and sometimes costly
travel, lodging and meals). If every staff
unit or faculty cluster traveled as much
as these, there would be no one here
doing the work of the University. In
addition, Food Service is adding to its
management, at a time that administra
tive ranks should be shrinking.
Next year, as part of the cuts made
necessary by University budget deficits,

Food Service and Facilities management
are closing Branner Food Service on Fri
days. This will mean that Brannerites
would eat far fewer meals in our own
facility than any other group on campus
— only eight meals: no breakfasts, no
Friday meals, no weekend meals. (It is
now known that nothing much will be
saved doing this, owing to the fact that
workers must still be used elsewhere.)
Other Food Service locations are being
forced to reduce their services as well.
Last year, during the budget crisis,
we proposed the cutting of Branner Food
Service Friday meals in order to help
Food Service with their budget prob
lems. The idea was that we had to do
something to keep Food Service from
eliminating the Branner Food Service
entirely. Looking back at that idea, I
now realize that Food Service was bluff

ing and did not have the clout to achieve
such a drastic solution. But, we were
most naive in thinking that Food Service
and facilities really had a commitment to
cutting budgets, all budgets, even their
own internal budget. That was not true.
In the process of discussing the Bran
ner issue with others, it came to my
attention that Food Service and Facili
ties were not sacrificing anywhere near
to the degree that they are asking us and
other students to. This is horrible. Last
year, it was stressed continually that the
budget cuts would be shared. This is still
the standard, as far as I know.
These days, when I hear the Facilities
management talk about the need for
cuts in student services, owing to budget
problems, I simply do not believe what is
said. It is all deception. The Facilities
and Food Service management need to

learn how to cut the expenses among
management before it goes ahead with
more slashing of student services, like
the present Branner food schedule. For
every dollar cut in student services, a
proportional cut should be made in man
agement budgets, especially in hidden
internal discretionary funds.
Management should not live high
while student services are treated
severely. If the present management
cannot police itself, and practice real fru
gality, then it should move along to
make room for new managers who
would allow the students to be the pri
mary consumers of their Food Service
dollars. Is there anyone in the upper
administration, supervising Food Service
and Facilities, worried about this issue?
