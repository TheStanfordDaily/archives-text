# Daily's views on staff superfluity at Yost are not in accord with fact
## 
### 
I share The Daily's concern for the
proliferation of student staff positions
within the housing system, and the
effect it has on the availability of spaces
for the student body at large. As the res
ident fellow in Yost, however, I need to
point out two factual errors in The
Daily's editorial — "Dodging the Draw"
— found in the May 20 edition. First,
Yost House is adding a "program assis
tant," not a "focus assistant." The two
are different. Given that The Daily

found inconsistency in having a "focus
assistant" in a non-focus house, I
believe it is reasonable to expect a higher
standard of accuracy. Secondly, The
Daily makes reference to Yost's "resi
dent assistants," when in fact we have
only a single RA position.
Other information bears on this situ
ation, and should, I think, clear up what
The Daily sees as something "amiss with
this picture." Firstly, Yost House, with
its 60 residents, has one of the highest
student-to-RA ratios on campus.
Further, while many of the duties of
the RA scale with the size of the house,
thus highlighting this ratio, many other
RA tasks are independent of the house
size; when there is only one RA to carry
all of them out, the problem becomes

one of simply having the RA over
whelmed with the sheer number of
things that must be done, often by
virtue of what residents themselves
expect. One of my prime concerns in
requesting a program assistant for next
year, then, was to spread the burden of
these chores over two individuals, free
ing up time for both to focus more on
imaginative and creative programming
within the house - programming that is
not limited to focus or theme dorms, and
which may lead to the eventual designa
tion of Yost as just such a house.
Lastly, it would have been helpful
for The Daily to have looked a bit closer
at the specific details of the staffing at
Yost. While living in the RF cottage
alone, it is also my privilege to serve

this University and its students in a
fairly large number of ways. If the
Daily thinks these activities disqualify
me for service as an RF, I would ask
only that it contact the residents in
Yost and seek their opinions, and per
haps that of Alice Supton, the Director
of Residential Education. For no extra
funds, the addition of a PA position to
Yost will allow me and my staff to pro
vide a still more enriching environment
for its residents. I hope that will be
judged a worthwhile expenditure of a
spot in our house.
