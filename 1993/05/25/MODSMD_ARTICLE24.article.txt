## Clark elevates Cardinal with high-jumping ability 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
When Travis Clark takes off,
Air Travis can make Michael Jor
dan's vertical pale in comparison.
Two weeks ago, at Big Meet
against California, Clark high
jumped a lifetime-best mark of
seven feet, three inches to place
him in the ranks of elite collegiate
jumpers.
The sophomore's NCAA provi
sional mark currently places him
15th in the nation. If he main
tains that standing until tomor
row, Clark will receive his first
ever invitation to the NCAA
Championships, held June 2 - 5 in
New Orleans.
However, his list of talents
does not stop there. Last year, in
the off-season, Clark declared an
interest in becoming Stanford's
first decathlete this decade.
"I seriously thought about
doing it last year, and I talked to
(former head) coach (Brooks
Johnson) about it," Clark said.
"In the end, we decided to put it
off or forget it completely, because
I wanted to maximize my poten
tial in the high jump first."
Clark's urge to compete as a
multi-faceted athlete resurfaced
this year as the season neared its
finale. "I talked to coach (Vin)
Lananna and he's excited about
letting me try the new events over
the summer."
Clark is already a member of
Stanford's 4 x 400-meter relay
team, and believes that his
"decent" speed in that event will
carry over and help him with the
running aspect of the decathlon.
Pole vaulting and long jumping
are other specialized fields that he
has dabbled in as well, but Clark
has no experience in the throwing
events as of yet.
Despite being a rookie in the
decathlon field, Clark is confident
that he has a head start on most
beginning decathletes. "I ran the

200 and 400 in high school, and I
run in the relay here — but most
high jumpers don't run and most
runners don't high-jump. It's a
good combination, though. If you
can get high jump out of the way,
that eliminates one of the more
difficult events to learn."

'You either miss or
make in high jump,
there's no in between,
and that makes the
sport really intense
and stressful.'
— Travis Clark

According to Lananna, Clark
has the ability to succeed in any
athletic endeavor he undertakes,
due to his tremendous physical
talent.
"Travis can be anything he
wants to be," Lananna said. "If he
wants to be a decathlete, I have all
the confidence in the world that
he will succeed. Based on what
I've seen this year, I don't think
I've encountered many athletes
who are as physically prepared to
compete as Travis. He's just phe
nomenal."
Even before his exploration
into decathlon and other areas of
track and field, this high-jumping
star almost signed on to play foot
ball for the Cardinal.
Recruited by Stanford as a
senior in high school in 1991,
Clark was not offered a scholar
ship but was "strongly encour
aged to join the team as a walk
on."
The second-team all-Missouri
player and winner of the Most
Valuable Player award in Mis
souri's Southeast Conference,
Clark refused football scholar

ships from other schools, as well
as Stanford's walk-on offer, in
favor of a collegiate track
career.
Coming out of high school,
Clark had reigned as Missouri's
state high-jumping champion for
three consecutive years. As a
sophomore, he cleared 6-10,
before improving to 7-1 his junior
year. During his senior season, he
leaped to a personal-best 7-2
before settling for 6-8 in the state
meet.
Clark set his collegiate best at
7-1 3/4 earlier this year at the
Stanford All-Comers Meet
before leaping into his personal
record books in Big Meet two
weeks ago.
"That definitely is the high
light of this season," Clark said.
"I'm not completely satisfied
with all my other jumps,
because it's hard to be satisfied
with your own performances. I
actually had bigger hopes for
the season. Instead, there were
a lot of inconsistencies in my
jumps."
One of his greatest disappoint
ments this year was his lackluster
showing at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, held in
Berkeley last weekend.
After missing his first two
attempts while clearing the bar at
6-8 and 6-10, Clark lost confi
dence in his performances and
failed to soar higher than 6-10
3/4.
"You either miss or make in
high jump, there's no in
between, and that makes the
sport really intense and stress
ful," Clark said. "When you're
running, you can be off by a
tenth of a second and still do
fine, but in the high jump, if
you're off at all you won't make
it. Besides that, you have to
have total confidence, or else
you won't make it, either. You
can't pysch yourself out of a
jump, and that's what I did at

the Pac-lOs."
While Clark awaits his NCAA
fate, Cardinal teammates Dave
Scudamore (10,000 meters), Rene
Rodriguez (400), Louise Watson
(3,000), Jen McCormick (javelin)
and Rhonda Oliver (400) are also
looking for possible invitations to

this year's national championship
meet.
Regardless of whether he com
petes again this year or not, or
how well he does, Clark figures to
play an important role on Cardi
nal teams of the future.
"Everyone's excited to see

him compete next year, because
even if he does not take up
decathlon, Travis will compete in
new events to help out the
team," Lananna said. "Any
coach would love to have that
type of an all-around athlete on
the team."

The sophomore's NCAA provi
sional mark currently places him
15th in the nation. If he main
tains that standing until tomor
row, Clark will receive his first
ever invitation to the NCAA
Championships, held June 2 - 5 in
New Orleans.
However, his list of talents
does not stop there. Last year, in
the off-season, Clark declared an
interest in becoming Stanford's
first decathlete this decade.
"I seriously thought about
doing it last year, and I talked to
(former head) coach (Brooks
Johnson) about it," Clark said.
"In the end, we decided to put it
off or forget it completely, because
I wanted to maximize my poten
tial in the high jump first."
Clark's urge to compete as a
multi-faceted athlete resurfaced
this year as the season neared its
finale. "I talked to coach (Vin)
Lananna and he's excited about
letting me try the new events over
the summer."
Clark is already a member of
Stanford's 4 x 400-meter relay
team, and believes that his
"decent" speed in that event will
carry over and help him with the
running aspect of the decathlon.
Pole vaulting and long jumping
are other specialized fields that he
has dabbled in as well, but Clark
has no experience in the throwing
events as of yet.
Despite being a rookie in the
decathlon field, Clark is confident
that he has a head start on most
beginning decathletes. "I ran the

200 and 400 in high school, and I
run in the relay here — but most
high jumpers don't run and most
runners don't high-jump. It's a
good combination, though. If you
can get high jump out of the way,
that eliminates one of the more
difficult events to learn."

'You either miss or
make in high jump,
there's no in between,
and that makes the
sport really intense
and stressful.'
— Travis Clark

According to Lananna, Clark
has the ability to succeed in any
athletic endeavor he undertakes,
due to his tremendous physical
talent.
"Travis can be anything he
wants to be," Lananna said. "If he
wants to be a decathlete, I have all
the confidence in the world that
he will succeed. Based on what
I've seen this year, I don't think
I've encountered many athletes
who are as physically prepared to
compete as Travis. He's just phe
nomenal."
Even before his exploration
into decathlon and other areas of
track and field, this high-jumping
star almost signed on to play foot
ball for the Cardinal.
Recruited by Stanford as a
senior in high school in 1991,
Clark was not offered a scholar
ship but was "strongly encour
aged to join the team as a walk
on."
The second-team all-Missouri
player and winner of the Most
Valuable Player award in Mis
souri's Southeast Conference,
Clark refused football scholar

ships from other schools, as well
as Stanford's walk-on offer, in
favor of a collegiate track
career.
Coming out of high school,
Clark had reigned as Missouri's
state high-jumping champion for
three consecutive years. As a
sophomore, he cleared 6-10,
before improving to 7-1 his junior
year. During his senior season, he
leaped to a personal-best 7-2
before settling for 6-8 in the state
meet.
Clark set his collegiate best at
7-1 3/4 earlier this year at the
Stanford All-Comers Meet
before leaping into his personal
record books in Big Meet two
weeks ago.
"That definitely is the high
light of this season," Clark said.
"I'm not completely satisfied
with all my other jumps,
because it's hard to be satisfied
with your own performances. I
actually had bigger hopes for
the season. Instead, there were
a lot of inconsistencies in my
jumps."
One of his greatest disappoint
ments this year was his lackluster
showing at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, held in
Berkeley last weekend.
After missing his first two
attempts while clearing the bar at
6-8 and 6-10, Clark lost confi
dence in his performances and
failed to soar higher than 6-10
3/4.
"You either miss or make in
high jump, there's no in
between, and that makes the
sport really intense and stress
ful," Clark said. "When you're
running, you can be off by a
tenth of a second and still do
fine, but in the high jump, if
you're off at all you won't make
it. Besides that, you have to
have total confidence, or else
you won't make it, either. You
can't pysch yourself out of a
jump, and that's what I did at

the Pac-lOs."
While Clark awaits his NCAA
fate, Cardinal teammates Dave
Scudamore (10,000 meters), Rene
Rodriguez (400), Louise Watson
(3,000), Jen McCormick (javelin)
and Rhonda Oliver (400) are also
looking for possible invitations to

this year's national championship
meet.
Regardless of whether he com
petes again this year or not, or
how well he does, Clark figures to
play an important role on Cardi
nal teams of the future.
"Everyone's excited to see

him compete next year, because
even if he does not take up
decathlon, Travis will compete in
new events to help out the
team," Lananna said. "Any
coach would love to have that
type of an all-around athlete on
the team."

Travis Clark can leap tall obstacles in a single bound. The sophomore high-jumper stands next to a
bar set at seven feet, three inches, the height to which he soared in Big Meet earlier this month.
