Cycling
The Cardinal women's team trial squad
rode away with the title last weekend as the
Stanford cycling team took sixth place overall
at the Collegiate National Championships in
the Boston area.
Challenging a 14 1/2-mile course in Con
cord, Mass., the five team trial squad mem
bers finished in 32 minutes, 51 seconds, more
than a minute ahead of 1991 winner UC-
Davis (34:06) and 1992 champion Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo (34:37). Rounding out an
undefeated season, Stanford was represented
by Bettina Romer, a chemistry graduate stu
dent, sophomore Tracy Timms, organization
al behavior graduate student Martina
Lauchengco, senior Anne Blanche Adams
and Medical School doctoral candidate Nicole
Calakos. The Cardinal team trial members,
bestowed with stars-and-stripes jerseys
awarded to the national champion each sea
son, will wear their prize in every team trial
event for the next year.
In other events, Romer took third as Stan
ford placed five cyclists in the first 22 in the
multi-lap criterium held in Cambridge,
Mass., Sunday. The same five Cardinal
cyclers also pedaled to top-20 finishes in the
road race, held Saturday in Arlington, Mass.

Stanford's men did not meet with the
same good fortune as the women, as they
mustered only a sixth-place finish in the
team trial (29:51), crossing the line more
than a minute behind leader UC-Santa Bar
bara (28:30).
Colorado won the overall team title, while
Davis took second, leading a group of five Cal
ifornia schools in the top eight.

Women's basketball
Five current and former Cardinal
women's basketball players were named
among 36 finalists for the USA Women's
World Championship Qualifying Tourna
ment Team and the USA World University
Games Team at the 1993 USA Basketball
Women's National Team Trials in Colorado
Springs, Colo., last weekend.
Jennifer Azzi, a guard, and Katy Steding,
a forward, two of the leaders of Stanford's
1990 NCAA championship squad, are among
17 potential Women's World Championship
Qualifying Tournament team members par
ticipating in a minicamp at the U.S. Olympic
Training Center in Colorado Springs this
week. The 12 American representatives — to

be led by Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer in
the Tournament of the Americas in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, from June 26 to July 4 — will
be selected during a training camp at Stan
ford next month. The squad will vie for a
berth in the 1994 FIBA Women's World
Championship in Melbourne, Australia.
The World University Games squad
tapped Cardinal guards Molly Goodenbour, a
senior, and junior Christy Hedgpeth to com
plement former Stanford center and 1992
graduate Julie Zeilstra among its 19 potential
members. The team, which will be trimmed
to 12 members in Colorado Springs next
month, looks to defend its 1991 gold medal at
the 1993 incarnation of the World University
Games July 7 - 17 in Buffalo, N.Y.
Men's swimming
Dan Kanner, a sophomore on the Cardinal
men's swim team, has been named to the
United States Maccabiah team, according to
U.S. Maccabiah swimming chairman Henry
Alpert.
Kanner, who hails from Salem, Ore., has
helped the Cardinal to NCAA titles in each of
the last two seasons. The three-time Ail-
American took fourth in the 200-yard
freestyle at the 1992 NCAA Championships.
