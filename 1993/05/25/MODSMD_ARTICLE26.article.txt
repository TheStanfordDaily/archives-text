# Athletes of the Week

### 
As The Daily's Athletes of the Week aptly
demonstrate, Cardinal competitors often
come to occupy a level above that of their
rivals at other schools, and even to exceed the
accomplishments of their own Stanford
teammates.
This week's picks, golfer Steve Burdick
and sprinter Rhonda Oliver, reward the
efforts of individuals who couldn't buy a little
help from their friends, rising above other

members of their Cardinal squads in
admirable displays of talent. With their team
mates away in the former case and heading
for defeat in the latter, our honorees still
came out to play last weekend, leaving in their
wake a pair of pleasant springtime memories.
Burdick, a sophomore from Rocklin,
Calif., punctuated an outstanding season
with a fifth-place finish at the NCAA West
ern Regional in Provo, Utah. Despite the
absence of his Cardinal teammates, who
failed to qualify for the competition, Bur
dick's one-under-par, three-round total of
215 earned him a spot in the NCAA Champi
onships, June 2 - 5 in Lexington, Ky. The
four golfers who placed ahead of him all
advanced with their teams, leaving Burdick
with the first of two at-large individual
berths in the national championships.
Burdick has been a wonder for Stanford
all year, serving as the squad's lone shining
star while four of its starters redshirted the
1992-93 season. For his efforts, he became
the only Cardinal golfer to garner All-Pacific
10 Conference honors, making the first team
in coaches' balloting last month.

Oliver, a senior from Tyler, Texas,
earned an NCAA provisional qualifying
mark in the 400 meters at the Pac-10
Championships in Berkeley as part of a
four-part finale to her conference career. In
what could have been her final collegiate
track meet, Oliver represented the Cardinal
in the 200, where she grabbed sixth place,

and in the 4 X 100 and 4 X 400 relays.
Should her 54.47-second time in the 400
hold up through Wednesday, Oliver's career
will be extended with an invitation to the
NCAA Championships June 2 - 5 in New
Orleans.
Invitation or not, however, Oliver's many
talents, which allowed her to become the
only Stanford athlete to participate in four
events at the Pac-10 meet in each of the last
three years, will not soon be forgotten.
