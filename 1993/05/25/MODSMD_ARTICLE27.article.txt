# Men's crew surprises, advances to nationals
## Rowers take second at Pacific Coast meet 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
For Stanford men's crew, it is
true that good things come in
small packages.
The undersized Cardinal row
ers overcame a tough headwind
to capture second place at the
Pacific Coast Rowing Champi
onships in Sacramento, Calif.,
last weekend, giving Stanford's
varsity eight-man boat an invita
tion to the national champi
onships for the first time in over
20 years. After clocking the sec
ond-fastest qualifying time in
Saturday's heats, the Cardinal
had revenge on its mind, as Sun
day's final gave Stanford a
chance to get back at California
and Washington for early-season
defeats.
After the final's first 500
meters, the Huskies had a one
boat-length lead on the Cardinal
and the Golden Bears. Keeping up
with Washington over the next
1,000 meters, Stanford was able
to pull ahead of Cal by one-half of
a second. The Cardinal then
extended its advantage over the
Golden Bears through the last
500 meters to finish to the 2,000-
meter course in 6 minutes, 14 sec
onds, four seconds behind the
first-place Huskies. Cal finished
one second behind Stanford in
third place.
"This was a very successful
weekend," coach Wieslaw Kujda
said. "The success of the varsity
[boat] can be attributed to the
effort of the whole team. Unfortu
nately, the conditions made luck
the limiting factor for many of the
races."
The windy conditions made it
difficult for Stanford's boats. The
strong headwind affected the Car
dinal more than other teams
because Stanford's smaller row
ers, averaging only 175 pounds
per person, were pushed around
more than the Huskies or Golden
Bears, who go at 200 pounds
each. However, the Cardinal
made up the difference with "a lot
of courage," according to Kujda.
Unlike the varsity, Stanford's
junior-varsity eight fell victim to
the severe conditions, finishing
fourth in the finals. Washington
won the race in 6:28, 12 seconds
ahead of second-place Orange
Coast College and 13 seconds
ahead of third-place Cal. The Car
dinal crossed the finish line in
6:55.
"The fourth-place finish was
disappointing," Kujda said. "Our
JV boat only averages 165

pounds, so the winds really affect
ed them. In fair conditions, we
would have been second."
The freshman eight also suf
fered from the windy conditions,
as it finished sixth, 28 seconds
behind first-place Orange Coast
College. Orange Coast edged
Washington by three-hundredths
of a second in the closest race of
the day.
The men's crew now moves on
to the national championships at
the Cincinnati Regatta June 11-
12. The field of boats for that
event has not yet been officially
determined, but Kujda expects
Brown, Pennsylvania and the
winner of the Harvard-Yale race
to join Washington and Stanford.
"With the right conditions, we
can take on anybody," Kujda said.
"The guys are really brave and
have the speed to beat anyone."
However, the women's crew
did not fare as well as the men in
Sacramento. The varsity eight,
finishing the season without Kate
Steger, cruised through its heat
race Saturday, but was well off
the pace in Sunday's final, finish
ing fourth.
Aiming for a third-place finish,
the Cardinal was unable to get
past Washington State, the wild
card crew which surprised every
one this year with their rapid
climb into respectability. The
Cougars, by far the biggest team
per person at the championships,
used their strength to overcome
the elements. Washington won in
6:50, with Cal coming in second in
6:55 and Washington State third
in 7:00. Stanford crossed the fin
ish line in 7:07.
"We were hoping to get WSU,
but the race was pretty much a
blowout," women's coach Wendy
Davis said. "Washington pulled
away, and in the screaming head
wind we couldn't catch up.
"After beseeching God for
about five hours for the wind to
let up, I decided it wasn't going to
change and just lived with the
tough conditions. The winds were
very uncommon for this course."
The women's junior varsity
finished fifth in its final, far
behind the leader, Washington.
Although the fifth-place finish
was a mild disappointment, the
boat moved from sixth to fifth
over the last 500 meters.
"The JV had a hard time, but
they pushed hard at the end,"
Davis said. "They didn't lose to
any teams they beat earlier this
year."
Rounding out Stanford's wom
ens' boats were the novice eight,
which finished 12th, and the
novice four, which provided some

excitement with its fourth-place
finish in the petite final by over
coming a near-collision with
another boat, a full stop during
the race, a seat falling off its
tracks and a collision with a float
ing advertisement.
Despite the setbacks the

women incurred this season,
Davis is optimistic about next
year's crew. Losing just two
seniors to graduation, Davis'
squad should feature a solid core
of good varsity rowers if some of
the bigger novice athletes follow
a strict summer regimen.
