# SLAC hit with second possible racial incident

Police are investigating two recent break-ins at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, including a
burglary with possible racial undertones.
Technician George Husek walked into work Fri
day to find the padlock on his office door pried open
and his equipment vandalized. Although Husek
does not believe the incident is related to a May 17
incident in which racial slurs were written on the
door of a fellow worker, he said the burglary might
have its own racial motive.
"I'm the only person here with an accent," Husek
said. "I'm not sure if that might have something to
do with it."
In the previous incident, Chuck Taniguchi — a
storeroom manager in SLAC's Stanford Synchro
tron Radiation Laboratory — came to work last
Monday to find an anti-Japanese message scrawled
on his office chalkboard and a knife imbedded in his
door.
Husek arrived at his disheveled office space to
discover some of his drafting equipment gone and
his personal files in disarray. No messages were
found in connection with the most recent inci
dent.
The break-in was apparently accomplished with
a crowbar, which was then left in Husek's office.
In addition to the office burglary, all of the jani
tor's assistants' lockers were broken into on Friday,
according to SLAC worker Lon Warneke.
All three incidents are currently under investiga
tion by SLAC security and the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Department. "We don't know yet if there is
a connection between the three incidents," said
SLAC Personnel Director Lee Lyon.
After two incidents potentially motivated by
racism in as many weeks, Warneke said his fel
low workers are sensing "a growing climate of
fear."
"We hope we can get to the bottom of this soon.
Workers are really getting tired of it,"he said.
