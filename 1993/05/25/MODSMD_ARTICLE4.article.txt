# New accounting rules could cost $15 million
## But two-thirds of liability will be 'on paper 
### Andy Dworkin Matthew Gregory Staff writers 
New accounting rules dealing with re
tirement benefits to be implemented in
1993-94 will cost Stanford about $15 mil
lion annually on paper but will actually
only result in an additional $5 million cash
outlay.
Passed by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board — a national group that
sets guidelines for accountants — the new
rules require businesses to report money
set aside to fund certain retirement bene
fits — even for employees who have not yet
retired — as a liability.
"Just about all" of the benefits covered
by the new rule are retirees' medical bene
fits, according to University Controller
Joanne Coville.

Until now, the University has simply re
ported the money they have actually paid to
retired employees for health care — about
$4 million this year — not the money
pledged for potential care for retirees and
current Stanford workers, said Chief Fi
nancial Officer Peter Van Etten.
The change will give Stanford a new $15
million liability on paper, Coville said.
But the regulation does not require that
institutions actually set aside the money
like pensions, although Coville said the
University hopes to be able to fund a por
tion.
"We do intend to fund some of it. The
question is whether we're going to fund
just the current service [costs] or
whether we're going to fund a little
more," she said. "We're really studying
all of the options."
Van Etten said the actual new
cash outlay the University will
have to make is only one-third
the apparent liability. The Uni
versity will actually begin fund
ing the "current service costs" —
the costs of providing for the
eventual retirement benefits of
current employees — which will
amount to about $5 million, he
said.
Coville said the $5 million
charge will be added into the gen
eral fringe-benefit pool, which
includes charges for other bene
fits such as employee health
insurance.
She said that the new rule did
not influence the University's
new "Educated Choices" flexible
benefits plan, introduced two
weeks ago. The charge will not
mean any reduction in salaries,
she added.
"It's a huge liability" on paper,
said Coville of the accounting
change.
"To the extent that it will
make our financial position look
worse, this is an outright recogni
tion of a liability that has always
existed but has been unrecorded

up until now."
But Van Etten pointed out
that the new rule "does not repre
sent a significant new unfunded
liability."
Although the rules were
passed in December 1990, most
colleges won't change their
accounting until the 1993-94 fis
cal year — the deadline for the
change.
Many major corporations like
General Motors and Ford have
already made the accounting
change, Van Etten said, and have
had to write off billion-dollar loss
es because of the rule.
Coville and Van Etten both
said the University must comply
with the change to maintain good
financial standing.
"The FASB sets the financial
standards for all entities that
publish financial statements and
they set what's called 'generally
accepted accounting principles,' "
said Coville. "If you're going to
get an audit, to get a clean opin
ion you must follow [these
rules]."
Coville said there are two other
board rules expected to be
released July 1 that could also
mean significant paper changes to
the University.
One rule, which will only affect
non-profit organizations, will
change the required format for

financial statements, giving them
a "very different" look, Coville
said.
The second new rule could
mean millions of dollars in —
again — paper gains for the Uni
versity. The new rule will man
date that the University record as
revenue some contribution
pledges that have not yet been
received.
Currently the University only
records gifts after receiving the
cash, not the pledge, Coville
said.
"It's a gain on paper, but try to
spend it," she said.
At the end of last fiscal year,
Stanford had $154 million in
outstanding pledges, Coville
said.
Some part of this would be
reflected as gains under the new
rule — which will not be in
effect for several years — but
the University has yet to
account for what percentage,
she added.
Coville said none of the finan
cial changes will mean a very sig
nificant change in the way the
financial world sees Stanford,
because financial rating institu
tions know such things as how
much benefit liability and not
yet-received pledges the Universi
ty has even if not yet recorded on
the balance sheet.
