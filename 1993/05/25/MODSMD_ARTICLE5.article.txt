# Kappa Sig admits serving alcohol during dry Rush
## SAE waits for ruling on two violations 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
After a five-week investigation, the
Kappa Sigma fraternity has admitted to
serving alcohol to minors and violating
regulations banning drinking at Rush
events.
The penalty for the infractions has not
been revealed, although Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said the fraterni
ty's members will be required to do a
"number of things."
Dunn said the penalty, enforced by the
University, will be "fair and tame."
"Since they did admit to the violation,
it made our decision process easier and
quicker," she said.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon members, who
were also accused of serving alcohol at
Rush parties, are still awaiting a Judicial
Board decision combining this violation
and the theft of several sheets from the
Palo Alto Hyatt hotel, allegedly taken for
a toga party.

Two freshmen, Allen Johnson and
Douglas Michel, were booked May 8 on
one count of petty theft each for the sheet
incident and released the same night.
"It's much easier for us to just bunch
the two violations together under the
same decision," Dunn said. "They made
violations twice, and our decision shall
fall accordingly."
Kappa Sig's penalty will be kept confi
dential because the decision was made by
the Greek Judicial Board, according to
Kappa Sig president Kevin Efrusy.
"Because this is a judicial decision,
we'd rather not disclose exactly what we
are having to do as compensation," he
said. "However, I can say that our frater
nity has been happy to have had the op
portunity to work this closely with the
University and reach a constructive solu
tion for all those concerned."
The Judicial Board received two writ
ten complaints against Kappa Sig; one
was made by an IFC member
and the other by a monitor at
one of the fraternity's parties.
This year marked the first
year the University enforced a
policy of a totally dry Rush.
Last year, Rush was dry only
from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. on week
days.
