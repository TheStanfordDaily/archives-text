# Wanted: leadership
## Shultz says a guiding hand will be needed in new world order 
### Grace Kim 
Emphasizing the importance
of creative leadership in the global
environment, former Secretary of
State George Shultz spoke about
world trade, savings and diversity
yesterday evening in Kresge Audi
torium.
"The fact that the Cold War
has ended lifts a burden," he told
a capacity crowd. "We have a gold
en opportunity in this time of
more economic and political open
ness. The question is whether we
take advantage of it."
Shultz said he sees tremendous
hope ahead for the world, but also
problems that will require good
leadership. "If they are not han
dled well, we can miss our oppor
tunity," he said. Ideally, he said,
"I see a 40-year effort of free coun

tries standing up to the commu
nists and succeeding."
He mentioned three vital is
sues currently "hanging in the
balance" — world trade, savings
and diversity.
Regarding world trade, Shultz
warned that countries could take
up dangerously protectionist
trade stances unless they come to
terms with one another to pre
serve free trade.
On the problem of savings, he
said, "As I noticed in the election
campaign, people are taking the
issue seriously." Ross Perot
brought the issue to the forefront,
Shultz said.
"Personally, I can't imagine
Ross Perot as president," he
added. "Can you imagine him in

charge of the CIA or FBI?"
Shultz said Americans need to
take responsibility for the state of
the U.S. economy and increase
their savings. "If we want the
returns |the Japanese are earn
ing], it's got to be our savings."
And Shultz gave a nod to the
importance of international diver
sity, which he said is at the root of
some troubles in the world today.
"We are not doing very well
now, I'm sorry to say. We face
increasing diversity in ethnic, lin
guistics, religious and national
aspirations. We must learn to
govern over that diversity."
Shultz then focused his scrutiny
on America's new leader. Remark
ing on President Bill Clinton's first
100 days, Shultz said, "The pro
gram didn't come anywhere near
matching the rhetoric."
He said, however, that Clinton
has a chance to take bold new
steps to end the Bosnian-Serb
conflict in divided Yugoslavia,
despite his shifting policy about
using U.S. firepower.
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is
the end of an era," Shultz said.

"Nothing has ever been handled
by the U.S. in such a fashion. . . .
We must have a clear view, say
what we are going to do, what we
think they should do, etc.
"I can't say the Europeans
would have responded, but they
always did in the past."
Amid his serious talk, howev
er, Shultz showed his lighter side.

evening, he recounted a funny
incident on a trip he took with
then-President Reagan to Brazil.
During a farewell dinner, Rea
gan — giving an extemporaneous
speech — ended with the toast of
"how wonderful it is to be in
Bolivia." The Brazilians, "who
are a humorous people," respond-

Ed to the president's faux pas the
next day with a banner saying the
"People of Bolivia Welcome the
President of Canada."
In discussing a potential run
for the presidency, Shultz again
used levity. "It would be a catas
trophe, and let me explain why,"
he said. "It is alleged that I have a
tiger tattooed to my rear end.
"We would never get to the real
issues. If it were found to be true,
there would be a great scandal. I
would never want to subject the
nation to that."
Shultz last night had just
returned from the last leg of his
publicity tour for his recently
published book, "Turmoil and
Triumph," his memoirs as Rea
gan's secretary of state.
Shultz's speech was the third
and final installment of the
Hoover Lecture series sponsored
by the Hoover Institution, the
Stanford Alumni Association and
former Ambassador to Australia
Bill Lane and his wife Jean.
Personally autographed copies
of his book, now No. 9 on the New
York Times best-seller list for
nonfiction, sold at a brisk pace in
the lobby. An exhibit of Shultz's
years as Secretary of State is on
display in Hoover Pavilion until
the end of July.
