# Like to get naked? Celebrate 'Nudity Day' at Lake Lag
## 
### Kris McNeil Staff writer 
Berkeley had the"The Naked Guy."
Synergy has quite a few who are will
ing to take it all off at the right occa
sion — or any occasion. And judging
by the occasional topless sunbather,
Lake Lagunita may be becoming the
next bastion of on-campus nudity.
But Stanford has never seen nudity
on the level being proposed by the or
ganizers of "Nudity Day," an after
noon of skinny dipping and sun
bathing without worrying about those

pesky tan lines.
Former Lake Lag lifeguard Steve
Matthews, a senior, and some of his co
workers are organizing the project,
which will take place Thursday after
noon between 2 and 5 p.m.
"This is my big project this year,
kind of like my senior project — the
culmination of four years of social lib
eration, and my last hurrah at Stan
ford," Matthews said. "It's my way of
saying, 'It's time we lighten up and
enjoy ourselves for who we are.' "
Matthews and junior Xanthe Jory,
a lifeguard at the lake, said the festivi

ties will be held on a Thursday after
noon, because during weekends the
lake is usually popular with families.
Matthews said the organizers would
post signs warning families about the
abundance of skin on the lake that
day.
"Tanning is the big issue here,"
Matthews said. "How often do you get
the opportunity to tan those hard-to
reach areas?"
But Nudity Day won't be the first
time the lifeguards have seen bare
bodies on the lake's sandy shores.
Matthews said that he often noticed

topless sunbathers while at work.
"We're supposed to discourage nu
dity. If women are laying out topless,
we're supposed to tell them to put
their tops back on," he said. But, ac
cording to Matthews, it is a loosely en
forced regulation.
Head lifeguard Polly Brown, a
sophomore, said she "probably
wouldn't do anything unless someone
came up and told me they were offend
ed."
The day is still in the planning
stages, but Jory and Matthews already
have organized some activities
for those who enjoy fun and
games in the buff. They hope to
organize a campus celebrity
dunking booth.
They stressed that everyone is
welcome, but individuals who
attend need to be supportive of
the effort.
"We want to discourage gawk
ers," Jory said.
And, according to Matthews,

"The most flexible people will
definitely have the best time."
He said they are hoping for a
big turn-out from Synergy.
"I get naked with the Synergy
people, I just don't know who
they are," he said, recalling a
recent Synergy party where he
and several residents sponta
neously stripped. "Unfortunately
I left my wallet there and had to
return to the scene of the crime.
They were very cordial, though
— even with their clothes on."
Matthews said he believes that
there is a strong nudity under
ground on campus. "We just don't

know where it is," he added.
He said he is also looking into
inviting Andrew Martinez, "The
Naked Guy," who was expelled
from UC-Berkeley earlier this
year for refusing to wear clothes
in class.
Matthews said he's disgusted
when he sees Big Game t-shirts
that put down Cal, with state
ments like "At least we wear
clothes."
"The bottom line is we're all
just a bunch of repressed people
who are too wrapped up in our
own lives and our own image to
ever take off our clothes and just

have some fun," he explained.
Some individuals have criti
cized the organization of Nudity
Day, arguing spontaneity is a key
aspect of nudism.
"There are different types of
nudity," Jory pointed out.
"Spontaneous nudity definitely
has its time and place, but some
times you need to make more of a
statement."
She described the event as a
"celebration of the body," and is
hoping that a cross-section of
campus will attend.
"It should be a multicultural
experience," Matthews added.
