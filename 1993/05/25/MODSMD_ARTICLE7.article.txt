Berkeley had the"The Naked Guy."
Synergy has quite a few who are will
ing to take it all off at the right occa
sion — or any occasion. And judging
by the occasional topless sunbather,
Lake Lagunita may be becoming the
next bastion of on-campus nudity.
But Stanford has never seen nudity
on the level being proposed by the or
ganizers of "Nudity Day," an after
noon of skinny dipping and sun
bathing without worrying about those

pesky tan lines.
Former Lake Lag lifeguard Steve
Matthews, a senior, and some of his co
workers are organizing the project,
which will take place Thursday after
noon between 2 and 5 p.m.
"This is my big project this year,
kind of like my senior project — the
culmination of four years of social lib
eration, and my last hurrah at Stan
ford," Matthews said. "It's my way of
saying, 'It's time we lighten up and
enjoy ourselves for who we are.' "
Matthews and junior Xanthe Jory,
a lifeguard at the lake, said the festivi

ties will be held on a Thursday after
noon, because during weekends the
lake is usually popular with families.
Matthews said the organizers would
post signs warning families about the
abundance of skin on the lake that
day.
"Tanning is the big issue here,"
Matthews said. "How often do you get
the opportunity to tan those hard-to
reach areas?"
But Nudity Day won't be the first
time the lifeguards have seen bare
bodies on the lake's sandy shores.
Matthews said that he often noticed

topless sunbathers while at work.
"We're supposed to discourage nu
dity. If women are laying out topless,
we're supposed to tell them to put
their tops back on," he said. But, ac
cording to Matthews, it is a loosely en
forced regulation.
Head lifeguard Polly Brown, a
sophomore, said she "probably
wouldn't do anything unless someone
came up and told me they were offend
ed."
The day is still in the planning
stages, but Jory and Matthews already
