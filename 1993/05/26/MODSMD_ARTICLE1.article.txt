# Former student recalls internment
## Students of Japanese ancestry sent to camps 51 years ago today 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
In 1942, Wat Takeshita was like any other
Stanford student on campus, playing intra
mural basketball, going to classes and writing
for The Daily in his spare time.
Then came Executive Order 9066.
On Feb. 19, 1942, in what the Carter Com
mission would later call an act of "race preju
dice, war hysteria and a failure of political lead
ership," President Franklin Roosevelt ordered
all persons of Japanese ancestry to be "evacu
ated" and imprisoned in "relocation camps,"
where the majority remained until the end of
World War 11.
Today marks the 51st anniversary of the day
when Takeshita, along with six other Japanese-
American students, was forced to pack up his
belongings and leave campus — just two weeks
before graduation. They were the last of 24 stu
dents at Stanford to have their education dis
rupted by the race hysteria that was consuming
the country.

'The worst thing was you didn't know
k what the future was going to be. You couldn't
112 say you'd be back in five years.'

Stanford alumnus WatTakeshlta was awarded his bachelor's degree from Stanford In
1942 via the mall while he was detained in a WWII internment camp for people of Japan
ese ancestry. The day prior to his deportation from campus, Takeshlta wrote his final
story for The Daily: a matter-of-fact prophecy of his own life that appeared on the front
page. He returned to Stanford In 1951 and received his master's in communication in
1952.
