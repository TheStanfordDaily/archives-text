# Former student recalls internment
## Students of Japanese ancestry sent to camps 51 years ago today 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
In 1942, Wat Takeshita was like any other
Stanford student on campus, playing intra
mural basketball, going to classes and writing
for The Daily in his spare time.
Then came Executive Order 9066.
On Feb. 19, 1942, in what the Carter Com
mission would later call an act of "race preju
dice, war hysteria and a failure of political lead
ership," President Franklin Roosevelt ordered
all persons of Japanese ancestry to be "evacu
ated" and imprisoned in "relocation camps,"
where the majority remained until the end of
World War 11.
Today marks the 51st anniversary of the day
when Takeshita, along with six other Japanese-
American students, was forced to pack up his
belongings and leave campus — just two weeks
before graduation. They were the last of 24 stu
dents at Stanford to have their education dis
rupted by the race hysteria that was consuming
the country.

'The worst thing was you didn't know
k what the future was going to be. You couldn't
112 say you'd be back in five years.'



Vincent Ho — Dally
Stanford alumnus WatTakeshlta was awarded his bachelor's degree from Stanford In
1942 via the mall while he was detained in a WWII internment camp for people of Japan
ese ancestry. The day prior to his deportation from campus, Takeshlta wrote his final
story for The Daily: a matter-of-fact prophecy of his own life that appeared on the front
page. He returned to Stanford In 1951 and received his master's in communication in
1952.
"They told us all we had to
pack everything we had in suit
cases and go to the Palo Alto train
station where we would be
shipped to internment camps,"
recalled Takeshita, then a senior
mqjoring in journalism. "A lot of
us had held out to get our diplo
mas, which were mailed to us
while we were in the camps."
Newspapers from the months
of April and May of that year
reveal a campus shaken by the
realities of the war, and yet oddly
sequestered from the world by
palm trees and the usual campus
concerns.
Headlines of "British take over
Madagascar to Prevent Jap inva
sion" and "Russian forces retreat
to New Crimean lines" run along
side "Branner to dance to Tahi
tian Theme," "Bookstore Rebate
Slips due Friday," and "Rugby
seeks mcyor sport recognition."
Occasional blurbs update the
toll of each new evacuation: April
6. . . 660 Japanese removed from
the San Francisco district; April
2. . . 2,000 from the Los Angeles
district; May 8.. . 9000 more from
Sacramento and Stockton. By the
end of the war, more than
120,000 Japanese-Americans had
been interned.
"Our attitude was fatalistic,"
Takeshita explained. "I guess
over the days or weeks we knew
something was coming, but
thought, 'It can't be helped.'
There wasn't much we could do.
It was the government against a

certain race."
Despite the sense of impending
calamity, Takeshita remembers
his time at Stanford with a warm
nostalgia. "It was the time when
Frank Albert and Gordon Stanley
led the T-formation for the first
time and surprised the whole
West Coast football league," the 5
foot-5 Takeshita recalled, fondly
noting the time he had to guard
the six-foot, 250-pound Stanley in
a game of IM basketball.
"You'd think wartime experi
ence would be bitter or unpleas
ant. But the kids at Stanford were
awful nice to us, even at the time
of Pearl Harbor," Takeshita said.
"I would be standing around the
Quad, listening to stories about
the war with the rest of the stu
dents, and they wouldn't even say
we looked Oriental or Japanese.
We were just like any other stu
dent listening in on the news."
It wasn't until he went down
Palm Drive into Palo Alto that
Takeshita said he began to sense
the wartime hostility. Once while
on a journalism assignment in
Redwood City, Takeshita was
about to ring the doorbell of a
house when he happened to look
up and notice the sticker, "WE
ISSUE JAP HUNTING LICENS
ES HERE."
"I just backed out and said,
'Gee, I got the wrong house,' " he
recounted. "There was a lot of
bias and hostility in society as a
whole, but the Stanford campus
was just completely tolerant and
understanding."
Three days after the attack on
Pearl Harbor, then-University
president Ray Lyman Wilbur
asked the campus for tolerance

toward Japanese-American stu
dents during an emergency
speech on the war, emphasizing,
"They are just as good Stanford
people as we are."
Wilbur later interceded with
the Army to delay evacuation of
the Santa Clara County district,
which included the campus.
Even pleas for tolerance, how
ever, could not completely pre
vent the race hatred generated by
the war from seeping onto cam
pus. A Daily editorial that ran
April 9 called for the rounding-up
and shooting of all "possible fiflh
columnists," noting that "effi
ciency, not humaneness wins the
war."
"My dad kept saying, 'All of us
are going to be jailed or put into
camps pretty soon,' and I'd say,
'Well, maybe you guys are,
because you're aliens, but they
can't touch us. We've got our
rights,' " the American-born
Takeshita recalled. "He got the
last laugh."
After leaving campus, Takeshi
ta, his fellow students and Yama
to Ichihashi, a professor in the
History Department, were
shipped to the Santa Anita race
track. Takeshita remembers shar
ing a tar-papered barrack with
five other Stanford students while
other internees had to settle for
converted horse-stalls.
Although they were distrusted
to the point of being imprisoned,
the internees were ironically
assigned the job of making cam
ouflage nets for the U.S. Army.
After three months at Santa
Anita, Takeshita was sent to a
permanent camp in Heart Moun
tain, Wyo., and then reunited with

his family at another camp in Gila
River, Ariz., where he remained
during the rest of the war.
The picturesque landscape of
the Arizona desert, with its sage
brush and sand, was blighted by
the barbed wire fence and a
watchtower manned with armed
guards. "One person tried to walk
out and was shot. After that
nobody tried to walk out,"
Takeshita said. "Later on at least
we could go out to the sagebrush
and walk around."
Documents from the Universi
ty's archives compiled by Prof.
Gordon Chang's "History of
Asian-Americans at Stanford"
project reveal a poignant corre
spondence between Stanford and
the camps.
A copy of a Western Union
Telegram dated Nov. 20, 1942,
reads "Dear President Wilbur: On
THIS EVE OF BIG GAME WE
ARE WITH YOU IN SPIRIT IF
NOT IN BODY. (Signed)
Japanese Alumni and Stan
fordites of Topaz, Utah." In addi
tion, a Faculty Club invitation
addressed to Ichihashi is marked
for forwarding to Santa Anita and
then to the camp in Tule Lake,
where the instructor of Japanese
history became a professor emeri
tus.

"The worst thing was you
didn't know what the future was
going to be. You couldn't say
you'd be back in five years,"
Takeshita said, describing the
struggles of families who were
forced to sell everything before
they were forced to evacuate.
"Your pets had to go some
where; your car, your house, all
your furniture just had to go
somewhere else," he said. "You
didn't know how long the war was
going to last, or if it was ever
going to end. We sold everything
not knowing what was going to
happen or when it was going to
happen."
After the war, Takeshita
taught Japanese at the University
of Minnesota to Army soldiers
and later served as a translator
for Mac Arthur's troops in Japan.
It wasn't until 1951 that he
returned to California to find that
he "no longer had roots."
"It was hard to get back where
you left off, because there was
nothing left from where you start
ed ofT," he explained.
"Families were scattered and
many didn't know where to start.
In my case it was easier because I
came directly back to Stanford,"
added Takeshita, who returned to
receive his masters in journalism

and began working for the Marin
Independent Journal in 1952.
Although the war was over, it
wasn't until August 1988 that the
U.S. government would offer a
formal apology as well as mone
tary sum to each of the intern
ment victims.
"It took so long we never
expected reparations. We figured
it happened, it couldn't be helped,
so it was water under the bridge.
We owe it all to the younger gen
eration who fought for it," said
Takeshita. "It won't pay for all
our losses, since $20,000 is maybe
only a brand-new car. But it's a
nice gesture. No other country
would probably do it."
While the days of internment
are long gone, Takeshita empha
sized the importance of remaining
vigilant of racial witch-hunts, not
ing the race hostility directed
toward Iranian-Americans during
the embassy takeover in 1979.
"There were people saying,
'Send the Iranians back to Iran.'
There was resentment against
people who were just trying to be
good citizens," Takeshita said. "It
was just like the old days when we
were sent to camp. Even for us it
seems like a dream now. Unless
we're careful it could happen
again."

The Japanese Students' Association posed for this picture in May 1940 with then-University President
Ray Lyman Wilbur (center). Two years later, the last of the group were "evacuated" to internment
camps. In October, Stanford will sponsor a reunion for the 17 Japanese-American students who
enrolled at Stanford during the 1941-42 academic year.
