Immigrants discovered
JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Not far
from the Statue of Liberty, 57 illegal
aliens from China were kept in a cramped
warehouse, let out only to go to jobs each
day.
Their discovery in the steamy building,
where flies buzzed around spoiled food
and bamboo mats littered the floor, came
on the day that 240 Chinese immigrants
were dumped at the foot of the Golden
Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
Economic hardship and fears of perse
cution in China make people desperate to
leave, and ripe for abuse, immigration
experts say.
Hundreds of illegal Chinese immi
grants, believed transported by smugglers,
have entered California ports in recent

months and have turned up in Australia,
Puerto Rico and the Marshall Islands.
EPA measures toxic waste
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. factories
produced at least 37.8 billion pounds of
chemical waste in 1991 and released about
9 percent of it directly into the environ
ment, the government reported yesterday.
While industry reported a decrease in
the amount of toxic chemicals directly
released into the land, water and air, the
Environmental Protection Agency
expressed concerns about the amount of
hazardous waste produced by factories is
increasing.
EPA Administrator Carol Browner cited
projections that in 1992 and 1993, figures
could increase by about 200 million pounds.
