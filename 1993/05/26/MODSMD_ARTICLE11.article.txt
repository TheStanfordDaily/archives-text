# Fired White House staff will be paid

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House put five fired travel employees on
indefinite leave with pay yesterday, back
ing off after nearly a week of accusations
that it had dismissed them to make room
for its friends and then pressed the FBI to
justify the action.
Admitting the White House mishan
dled the situation, spokesman George
Stephanopoulos said the five will be kept
on paid administrative leave pending an
internal investigation into accusations
that money was mishandled in the office.
Chief of Staff Mack McLarty accepted
responsibility for administration's mis
steps and will conduct the internal
inquiry "to see what went wrong and
what went right and what we can do bet
ter," Stephanopoulos said.
The travel office issue has added to a
string of controversies — from embar
rassments over Cabinet nominees to a

furor over Clinton's gays-in-the-military
policy to his pricey hair cut aboard Air
Force One — that have pulled attention
away from the economic program the
president wants to emphasize.
Seven employees were abruptly dis
missed last week and the FBI was asked
to investigate accusations of financial
wrongdoing. Yesterday's reprieve did not
cover the office's two most senior employ
ees: director Billy Dale, who resigned to
avoid a formal firing, and his deputy,
Gary Wright.
Stephanopoulos said Dale and Wright
were singled out because they had finan
cial responsibility for the office. Placing
the other five employees on leave keeps
"the door open to some sort of federal
employment" if they are cleared, he said.
Clinton distanced himself, saying he
was not involved in the decision to get the
FBI to release a statement that a criminal

investigation of the office was warranted.
"I had nothing to do with any decision,
except to save the taxpayers and the press
money," Clinton said.
Stephanopoulos said it was a mistake
to release the FBI statement.
Traditionally, the FBI does not com
ment on matters under investigation.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
accused the administration of strong
arming the FBI, and said it was reminis
cent of Watergate. He asked the Senate
Judiciary Committee to conduct a full
hearing.
Aides said Clinton was disturbed about
the way his communications staff had
handled the situation, but they insisted
no personnel changes were imminent.
The travel office employees are Dale,
Wright, Barney Brasseaux, John
McSweeney, John Dreylinger, Robert
Van Eimeren and Ralph Maughan.
