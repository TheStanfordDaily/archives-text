## Editorial Honoring the queen 
### 
THE QUEEN OF Thailand
will visit campus today, to
accept the first Woman of
the Year Award from Stanford's
Institute for Research on Women
and Gender.
Her Megesty Queen Sirikit is
being honored for her work in
bringing economic self-sufficiency
to rural Thai areas by encouraging
cottage industries in doll-making,
weaving and traditional arts and
crafts. She declared 1992 the Year
of the Woman in Thailand, and has
been the president of the Thai Red
Cross Society for over 35 years.
The establishment of such an
award seems long overdue. And
undoubtedly, the queen has
"inspired and stimulated cultural
ly relevant strategies for improv
ing the well-being of the world's
women" â€” the criteria for the
award.
But while the queen's efforts

should not be overlooked, the
plight of many women in Thailand
must not be either.
Bangkok, in particular, is note
worthy for its prostitutes, some of
who are pre-pubescent 10-, 11-,
and 12-year old girls. Thanks to
the city's healthy sex industry and
perhaps less-than-wholehearted
prevention efforts, AIDS has
reached epidemic proportions in
the city.
Now that the queen has made
inroads in her country's agricultur
al areas, she should focus her
efforts on the plight of the urban
women and girls who are impover
ished, abused and denied education.
But in the meantime, congratu
lations to the queen for her efforts
to improve the status of Thai
women. And to the institute, a
salute for recognizing achieve
ments in the struggle for women's
rights and women's quality of life.
