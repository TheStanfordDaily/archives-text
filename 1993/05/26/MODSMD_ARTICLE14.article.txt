CARS, CARS everywhere
That's a problem, say some
Stanford students who last
week gave out fake citations for
gas guzzling and fuel inefficiency.
And indeed, they may have a
point.
Sixty percent of people who
commute to Stanford drive
alone. And 40 percent live within
five miles of campus. In an age of
shrinking energy resources,
increasing pollution and conges
tion, and an ever-shrinking
number of campus parking
spaces, such figures are inexcus
able.
For many years, Stanford has
promoted carpooling by offering
these environmentally conscious
people free parking, and even pre
ferred parking spaces.
Such efforts should continue in
full force. But given the apparent
plateau in their efficacy, new mea
sures must be undertaken to
reduce the traffic on campus.
Perhaps the University could

offer employees who agree to bike,
walk or take the bus to work 20
days of free parking, for the occa
sional times these people must
drive to work. The cost of such a
program would certainly be less
than constructing more spaces in
parking garages at a cost of more
than $10,000 a piece.
The University could also offer
convenient shower facilities, lock
ers and perhaps free towel service
for bikers and walkers, to make it
more attractive to come by bike or
on foot. Covered bike lockers may
also be a good incentive for com
muters to leave their cars at
home.
The fact is, as the demand for
space for buildings increases, the
availability of campus parking is
bound to decrease. Stanford must
continue to be innovative in its
programs to promote alternative
means of commuting.
A small sacrifice for such an
important cause is not unreason
able.
