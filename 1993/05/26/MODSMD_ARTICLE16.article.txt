## The 						making of memories 
### 
00-RAH! MY FIRST impression of
Stanford was a week of yelling
stufTlike that with a bunch of peo
ple I didn't know. I found myself in a
community of fellow clueless high school
grads, looking for anything in common,
to make ourselves feel comfortable. And
when we didn't have anything in com
mon, we created experiences to bond us
together. We painteid ourselves for foot
ball games, went fountain-hopping in the
rain and sang songs at the Dish.
I had landed myself in Donner.
And thus began my freshman year. I
was a naive college freshman who had no
idea what I was getting into — but what
ever it was, I was going to do it with 95
other people who didn't know, either.
Flicks, classes, midterms, Stern pre
point-system food, that roll-out phe
nomenon; we all discovered it together,
and we grew closer through the adversi
ty. Even the Loma Prieta earthquake a
month into the year bonded us together,
in a catastrophic kind of way.
We sat in the hallways for hours and
talked about everything from racism to
Chuang Tzu to professional wrestling.
Inside jokes developed and became part
of the dorm vocabulary.
It wasn't all good. I can remember
wondering if anyone would really get to
know me like my friends at home, and if
these people were really my friends. I
remember feeling out of place because I

was in the non-drinking minority. I
remember sometimes being intimidated
by the quality of people around me. But
even the bad times were good; they made
the experience more real.
That year was one of the best I'd ever
had, and it went by entirely too fast. I
never thought going home for the sum
mer could be so sad. Despite the strong
ties and indelible memories that were
made, eventually Donner became just
that — a memory. Soon I forgot how
much I loved it and how much it meant to
me. Until this year.
I have spent the last eight months as a
Branner RA. And loved it. Yes, I con
formed find ignorantly chanted "Branner
Sucks" along with the rest of the campus
for three years, without even really
knowing where Branner was. But I've
gotten to know it for what it really is — a
place with a sense of community as
strong as the one I had in Donner. My
year in Branner has brought smiles to my
face at least as big as those I had three
years ago.
On Sunday, I went to a Donner
reunion. While I had seen many of them
around campus, it was the first time we'd
all been together in a long time. It was
great: rehashing old jokes, seeing faces
that look exactly the same, dusting off
memories and exaggerating most of them.
And as I left, I realized I had that
weird feeling again. It was the same feel

ing I got at the end of freshman year. It
was the same feeling I got at high school
graduation. And it was the same feeling
that I'm sure I will feel at the end of this
year.
It was a feeling of loss. Like I missed
something that won't come back. As I
walked out of the Donner lounge, I real
ized that I most likely won't see most of
these people again. It feels so strange;
these people were my freshman year, and
now they're no more than simple
acquaintances. It's just not the same.
And now, in a week or so, I'm gonna
have to face the same stuff again. I will be
saying goodbye to members of my class,
and saying goodbye to what was an excit
ing and meaningful part of my life. I will
probably not see most of them ever again.
And I'll be saying goodbye to my frosh,
thanking them for the priceless relation
ships and moments they've given me. For
the incredible year I've had. And I'll give
them a bit of advice. Make the friends
and enjoy the moments now. Because
before you know it, they'll just be ...
memories.

Mike Langford will never forget the peo
ple of Donner '89-'9O and Branner '92-
'93. Thanks for the memories.
