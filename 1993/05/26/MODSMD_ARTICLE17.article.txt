USWpresident speaks out on discrimination, improprieties

THIS UNION WILL NOT tolerate
any form of assault in the work
place, any display of prejudice or
any act of discrimination. This includes
any assault given the race or ethnicity of
our members.
We demand that management be held
accountable at every level for establishing
and enforcing a decent and respectful
work environment, free from acts and
expressions of hostility against any minor
ity or personal orientation.
The Union has received many expres
sions of outrage, sometimes mixed with
feeling√ü of grief, loss and despair that the
Stanford workplace can contain such a
personally hurtful expression as was made
recently against USW Steward, Chuck

Taniguchi.
The Union has turned full attention to
assure that Taniguchi is protected and his
well-being re-established. We are insisting
that a complete and factual investigation
reveals the entire details of the most
recent offense, that the details of this
investigation be fully available to the
Union, and that there will be no diver
sions or cover-up tactics by management.
Taniguchi has been victimized by many
retaliations over a period of years for his
efforts to expose management and super
visory misconduct at the Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL).
The Union expects that responsibility
for this most recent event can only be
found by complete disclosure and exami

nation of the total workplace environment
at SLAC and SSRL. We believe that such
an inquiry will reveal senior management
negligence and inattention to various
abuses of long standing, to include and
undercurrent of favoritism, patronage,
dishonesty and occasional nepotism. Inci
dents of petty corruption and abuse of
power have been protected by a climate of
fear and routine retaliation. Non-supervi
sory employees are sometimes goaded into
acting as retaliatory enforcers.
Taniguchi's efforts to report and cor
rect these abuses have been met by undis
ciplined insults and displays of prejudice.
The latest offense can only be understood
as part of a pattern of management abuse
and negligence.

United Stanford Workers is not pre
pared at this time to comment in detail to
what extent such offenses against our
workers are widespread. We can say that
such problems are worsening and have
reached an unacceptable level.
We are beginning our own evaluation
of events, both in the most recent case
and in general. We intend to gather and
review reports thoroughly within the
Union and with experts.
We want to keep the membership
informed and involved. Anyone with
information on the SLAC/SSRL situation
should call Susan Strubbe at the United
Stanford Workers office, (415) 723-3680.
Fred Harris
President, United Stanford Workers
