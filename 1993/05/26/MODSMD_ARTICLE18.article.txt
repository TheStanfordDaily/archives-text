# Daily editorial on the Spring Food Faire did not include all facts
## 
### 
This letter is written in response to
the editorial that appeared in the May
17 issue of The Daily regarding "The
Spring Food Faire" special event held
on May 12 by University Food Service.
The editorial did not provide an ade
quate description of the event and also
failed to give credit to the Food Service
department for its efforts in planning
and executing such a unique and suc
cessful event.
The "Administration" that The
Daily spoke of is made up of human
beings who care about students. With
student and staff input, our goal was to
give students a change from their nor
mal routine with the close of the school
year approaching. This was an oppor
tunity for the entire community we
serve to come together and ei\joy food
and entertainment. The Daily editorial
stated that students were only able to
ei\joy good food at this event and not

on a normal, daily basis, while simulta
neously presenting that "Stanford
chefs do good, hard work." There is an
inconsistency here, as these are the
same hard-working staff that produce
and serve a variety of over 12,000
meals per day throughout the academic
year. These meals require careful fore
casting, planning and preparation.
It is indeed a tremendous challenge
to satisfy over 3,700 different student
palates and eating habits from all over
the world who compare us to mom's
home cooking.
We are also very sensitive to cost,
and this matter was also erroneously
addressed in the editorial. When we
consolidate special events such as the
Food Faire, the costs are significantly
less, due to the fact that we normally
operate 14 food service operations.
Labor was reduced on that evening
because we only needed to staff six sta
tions on the field and Lagunita Dining
Hall. There was not the cost of normal
cashiering, checking and dishroom
staffs, which ultimately reduced
expense to enable us to upgrade the
menu and provide decorations and
entertainment to make the evening

truly special. We received vendor, stu
dent and management support in pro
viding, as well as making, some decora
tions and signs- The hula dancers are
members of a Stanford student group
that was a welcome addition to the fes
tivities.
University Food Service had a rate
increase last year that was lower than
inflation, in order to allow general
tuition rates to increase higher than
usual to support the academic pro
grams. This was done while meeting
all of our normal operating expenses,
without any subsidy from the Univer
sity.
University Food Service will contin
ue to work to improve food quality and
analyze and refine pricing and cost. It
is very disheartening to plan events
only to be criticized without an
attempt to learn and present all rele
vant facts. It was evident that many
students, resident fellows and staff
enjoyed the event by their positive
communication of appreciation to the
Food Service department.
I trust this letter makes you aware
and sensitizes you to the efforts and
challenges that are made by University

Food Service and that this will reflect
in your future reporting.

Services
