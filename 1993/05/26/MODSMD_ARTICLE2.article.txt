# Grad student wins senate chair race
## Deadlock broken, Waldorf picked 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
In a move that will likely give
graduate students a stronger
voice in student government, the
ASSU Senate elected graduate
senator Greg Waldorf as senate
chair, breaking the deadlock
reached at its first meeting.
Two weeks ago, the new senate
adjourned after four consecutive
ballots in which the vote was tied
between Waldorf and undergrad
uate senator Mork Murdock.
But the senators were able to
make up their minds in the first
vote last night on a 12-8 ballot,
electing Waldorf, who almost
withdrew from the race at the pre
vious meeting.
"I think both candidates were
well qualified and would have
done a terrific job," said graduate
senator Kevin Murdock. "I was
personally surprised at the result,
but I am happy with Waldorf s ex

perience and ability."
Prior to the vote, both candi
dates addressed the senate and
answered questions about their
platforms. Both said technical as
pects of bills should be handled in
committees rather than before
the full senate, and both ex
pressed a desire to expedite meet
ings and remain impartial in de
bates.
"I have a great deal of experi
ence in organizations," said Wal
dorf, a first-year student in the
Graduate School of Business. "I
think I can be a very impartial fa
cilitator."
Mork Murdock stressed creat
ing unity in the senate, saying,
"We need a forum where we can
discuss graduate-undergraduate
issues in small groups."
Waldorfs election, the first
senate-chair victory for a gradu
ate senator in five years, will like
ly help graduate-student issues
gain momentum in the senate.
Graduate senator Sanford
Dickert said he was impressed
with Waldorf's abilities. "I hope
that he provides the graduate stu
dent viewpoint in the SSU," he
said.
Because the Council of Presi
dents is composed only of under
graduate students this year, Wal
dorf is expected to be the
representative for graduate stu
dents in the ASSU administra
tion.
Waldorf, however, opted to
look at the bigger picture last

night. "By and
large, I see my
job as getting the
senate going,"
Waldorf said.
"It's not just a
matter of push
ing projects
through the sen
ate — it's a mat
ter of keeping

them going."
After his election, Waldorf said
that he hopes the senate will
effectively deliver projects and
information to the student body.
"The increasing divisiveness in
the senate causes me to be less
inclined to inject my own opinions
into the debate," he said. But that
will not limit his involvement, he
added.

"I think it's important for the
senate to get things done," he
said.
Undergraduate senator Peter
Cousins said he was "pleased that
the senate has selected someone
with experience in managing a
body with efficiency." He added
that Mork Murdock would have
"excessively, I believe, politicized
the office."
Mork Murdock, who had been
criticized earlier in the election
for resorting to unfair measures
— such as contacting senators
before the meeting — in order to
win election, had little comment
on his loss.
"It's basically a done deal," he
said, adding that he is unsure
whether he will run for the
deputy senate chair position.
