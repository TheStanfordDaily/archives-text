## What is love? Untangling an achy-breaky heart 
### 
I love you. I swear on the grave of all my
childhood pets, I do. A love as deep as
Term an Pond. A love as big as my
course load. A love as wonderful as an end
of the year screw-your-roommate to which
you wear excruciatingly high heels.
Would I lie to you?
It's spring, and love is in the air. Love...
jumping down people's throats, making
them gag and choke in terrorizing spasms.
Love... getting in people's faces, screaming
at them to believe in another member of this
sick, sweaty, deranged mosh pit we call the
human race. Love... immaturely assuming
such feeble people even have the ability.
Hide your children.
The sight of actual people I actually
respect holding hands while walking to
actual classes. Decent hook-ups that
should be ignored with the dawn of the
new day, valiantly recycled into somewhat
stable relationships. A veritable break
down in what is normally a deliriously bit
ter social atmosphere, a degeneration
which spawns formals, rose deliveries and
obnoxiously spontaneous picnics.
I feel ill.

Maybe it's the time of year. Maybe
everyone wants to go home and have just a
little more on their romantic repertoire
than a Full Moon on the Quad swapping of
cold sores. Maybe they want to go home
saying they have dated someone at Stan
ford — so their love history is not limited
to La Habra High's most-likely-to-rob-a
convenience-store, whose eyes match his
Chevron uniform.
In some frantic realization of their
patheticness, students have cast aside
their infinitely high standards, their con
tempt for men with love handles and
women who wear baseball hats, their
dreams for the discovery of a true soul
mate with job-market potential, their shot
at an A- grade point average for the quar
ter. And for what?
She's not buying it.
I don't love. I don't even like. Love is the
ultimate sign of internal weakness, the
inability to make do on your own and tell
others you don't give half a damn what they
care. I don't believe in it. I don't even con
sider it. The thought makes me nauseous.
I could not even crawl out of the little

corner of the back of my psyche long
enough to actually express a less-vulnera
ble feeling such as, say, repugnance, dis
dain, contempt. But love? Yeah, sure. I
think I'd die.
Hope you look good in black.
But I have to wonder what my problem
is. Why am I so afraid of others? Why can't
I give anyone a chance, for once in my piti
ful life? Why can't I buy that special some
one an inexpensive pair of Garfield boxers
in a fit of unbridled emotion?
I am constantly reminded of the poten
tial for love and caring we humans have.
By ruthless bicyclists who crash into
unsuspecting pedestrians. By people who
take my laundry out of the dryer sopping
wet and leave it crumpled up in a dirty cor
ner. By TAs who write "good job" as the
only comment on a B+ 20-page research
paper. Yet, I still can't scrounge up faith in
my fellow man.
Heart of stone.
I should be drawing wall-sized murals
in ball point pen for my Sweet Babboo. I
ought to be organizing a romantic poison
oak fest with Bunny Tummy in the

foothills. I owe it to myself to live a little
and take the Light O' My Life to the Cof
fee House for a double mocha in an easily
stealable glass.
Instead of tripping the light fantastic,
staying up all night uncovering my deep
est, darkest secrets — the thoughts I fear
will make others vomit at my sight — I
close myself off. No gazing deep into some
one else's eyes, looking for the enchanted
path the realm of their thoughts. No bar
rage of phone calls to them, praying to the
AT&T god they'll be home. No buying a
bag of Bookstore candy to give as an over
whelming display of affection.
Just do it.
Yet, believe it or not, I can see myself —
in a decade or two — developing the ability
to trust others. It would make me happy to
be able to spend every day and every night
in the presence of another person, happy to
be with them, expressing an occasional feel
ing or two in between insecurity attacks.
I used to be able to do it, before I face
planted on the barbed-wire strewn path of
life. I said "I love you" to my hometown
honey. I said I'd wait for Hometown

Honey, Part 11. But somewhere in between
the $200 phone bills and seeing another
girlfriend making out on the porch with
the man I should've been making out on
the porch with, I chose to forget about love
as an option. True feelings swapped for a
lifetime of tap dancing, entertaining and
lively dinner conversation.
Burning down the house.
I gave it all up. Forfeited the chance to
play in the Game of Love because I
couldn't recruit enough desire to take the
field. Riding the pine would be just as
good, less painful and lighter on my dad's
credit card.
Will I be happy this way? Will I ever lay
formica on roach-infested shelves, eating
cat food for dinner with someone who
shares my morbid penchant for Clockwork
Orange? Will I ever accept the fact that I
might want to love — and it scares me?
I'm not quitting my day job.
