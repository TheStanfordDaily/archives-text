## Eat broccoli and live longer? Old theories dispelled about environmental factors and aging 
### Delia Garigan 
According to a Stanford biologist, eat
ing vegetables or shying away from sun
bathing may not automatically keep one
looking young.
One of a host of scientists who has
been investigating what makes humans
and other organisms age, Biological Sci
ences Prof. Phil Hanawalt has struck a
major blow to existing theories on
aging.
The answer 112 iems to be tied to DNA,
the double helix of sugars and acids that
contains the genetic code. DNA not only
gives a person brown eyes and their
mother's smile, but it may also directly
determine how long they can potentially
live.
DNA that makes up the chromosomes
contains regions known as genes, which
code for specific proteins in the body.
The historical belief is that aging
results from environmental damage to
the genes, which the body eventually
becomes unable to repair efficiently. Cer
tain substances have been shown to
cause mutations that damage or alter the
DNA strand.
For example, ultraviolet light — the
wavelengths of sunlight that give one a
tan — is often used to study DNA repair
mechanisms. It causes a specific type of
damage known as pyrimidine dimers,
which is harmful if not repaired.
Scientists have hypothesized that an
accumulation of damage from environ
mental factors such as ultraviolet light
makes it harder for the body to synthe
size proteins from genes efficiently and
currently.
As a result, the tissues of the body
slowly lose their integrity and aging
occurs.
However, recent research by
Hanawalt's group helps disprove this
theory.

Hanawalt and his team of
researchers, found that DNA is repaired
more quickly in regions that code for
genes whose products are actively being
manufactured and used, than in "silent"
regions — which are not being read or
used.
His findings show that errors in genes
that are actively used get repaired no
matter how old the gene.
"The main impact of this work,"
Hanawalt said, "is that it's not adequate
to look at overall responses to damage."
Rather, he suggested that the genes play
a significant role in determining how fast
people age.
Cells already have internal clocks that
determine when and how frequently
they will divide in two. It seems likely
that cells in the body are also pre-pro
grammed to age. "Little is left to
chance," Hanawalt said. "Cells control
their own destiny."
An example of cells controlling their
own level of youthfulness is found in
cells called fibroblasts that have been
cultured — grown in the laboratory.
Fibroblasts taken from a young person
will divide vigorously in the culture dish,
while fibroblasts from an older person
will divide much more slowly.
Furthermore, cells create their own
mutations in DNA, changes that are not
repaired as readily as environmental
damage mutations. As cells age, they
accumulate more self-imposed damage
until they may no longer be able to man
ufacture the proteins needed to function
properly.
The speed of one's internal aging
clock may have a lot to do with the genes
they inherit. Certain genes may manu
facture enzymes that react with carcino
gens, making some people more suscepti
ble to cancer.
Other genes may control how well the
body can repair damage caused by the

free radicals they produce. "It's certainly
true that your genetic makeup deter
mines your intrinsic life span,"
Han a wait said.
While it seems as though people have
been living longer and longer as medical
technology advances, Hanawalt points
out that everyone has more or less the
same "intrinsic life span." Our intrinsic
life span — the number of years we're
genetically "destined" to live— is pro
grammed into our genes, he said.
Rather, the number of people who
reach their maximum life span is
increasing, helped along by modern tech
nology.
Hanawalt also rejects the notion that
science could come up with a wonder
drug or a treatment that would allow
people to live forever. "If you look at life
spans over the last 100 years, you find
that it's approaching a maximum. Maxi
mum life span is not increasing," he said,
adding that humans can live to nearly
115 years before their biological clock
shuts down.
The things that prevent people from
reaching their maximum age include
infectious diseases or smoking, which
actively inhibit life span by causing
irreparable damage to the body. Once
such environmental causes are removed,
however, people will live to old age and
die of old age problems.
The greatest old age problem,
according to Hanawalt, is the incidence
of cancer caused by cell-controlled
mutations. Regardless of our lifestyle,
cells will eventually come up with
mutations in crucial genes that will
cause cancer.
Healthy lifestyle or not, there is noth
ing we can do if our cells' clocks decide
it's time. "If people live long enough,
they'll die of cancer, and it won't be
because they did or did not eat their
broccoli," he said.
