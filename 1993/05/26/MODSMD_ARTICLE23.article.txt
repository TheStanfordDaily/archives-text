# Slimy, soggy snot— The Bug gives a scientific explanation
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: What is the composition of
snot, and why does the body
produce it?
— A cold sufferer
A: In addition to serving as a
dietary supplement for some
of the less civilized folk among us
— as well as being the likely
source of those weird stains on
the overstuffed chairs at Green
Library — "snot," as it's known
in the preschool vernacular,
serves the body in a largely pro
tective capacity.
(Just so no one gets confused,
let me tell you right now that
for the remainder of this col
umn I will be referring to nasal
mucus by its grown-up name.)
Nasal mucus prevents
mechanical injury to the deli
cate membranes that line the
nose, such as might occur when
you blow your nose, pick it (con
fess!), or insert one of those
strange objects like pencils,

beans or pretty bugs — that lit
tle kids seem to like putting in
their noses and ears so much.
The mucus simply provides a
lubricant coating that protects
these membranes from such
potential sources of abrasion.
The nasal mucus is secreted
by specialized "goblet cells,"
which are so named because
their overall shape — wide at
the secretory surface that faces
the nostril cavity, narrow at the
basal surface that touches the
underlying connective tissue —
roughly resembles a wine glass.
If you are healthy, your nasal
epithelia are producing mucus
at low levels just about all the
time.
Mucosal secretion can be
accelerated by irritation of the
nasal passages.
Small particles, like ash, fine
sand or sawdust, are especially
good at provoking mucosal
eruptions.
Upper respiratory infections
and allergies also increase
mucus production, resulting in
the clogged airways and post

nasal drip so familiar to allergy
victims (excuse me — "Allergy
Survivors") and cold sufferers
like yourself.
I'm not really sure why this
happens; every medical tome's
description of the common cold

just seems to take this annoying
response for granted — the
"characteristic pathology" of
the disease.
Clearly, the irritation caused
by blowing one's nose could
induce mucus production, but
why the overproduction hap

pens in the first place, I don't
know. I invite any readers "in
the know" to drop me a line.
Mucus itself is composed
mostly of the appropriately
named mucopolysaccharides,
long chains of slightly modified

simple sugars. (For all you
Chem 131 buffs out there, every
other monomer or so has had
particular hydroxyl, -OH,
replaced by an amine, -NH2.)
The special structure of
mucopolysaccharides makes
them retain water, and thus

swell slightly, in a moist envi
ronment like the one found in
your nostrils.
By trapping water, the
mucopolysaccharides found in
the nasal cavity prevent dehy
dration of the mucous mem
branes.
Absorption of water also
gives the mucopolysaccharides
their characteristic slimy, glis
tening appearance.
Along with the mucopolysac
charides, nasal mucus (and, for
that matter, all kinds of mucus,
such as the kinds found in the
lung or gut) contains various
proteins.
Many of these proteins mere
ly add to the familiar viscosity
of mucosal secretions, but oth
ers perform enzymatic func
tions.
Notice that mucus, as secret
ed by the goblet cells, does not
contain anything inherently
dangerous — just polysaccha
rides and proteins, along with
water and some basic salts.
Assuming you could get around
the bland flavor, it would be

perfectly safe to eat.
If you would like, try some
now.
Ha! Fooled you. There is a
reason behind our culture's
taboo against eating boogers —
other than the obvious aesthetic
one — but it doesn't have any
thing to do with the inherent
composition of mucus as such.
Mucus serves to trap micro
scopic particles that would oth
erwise end up in the lungs.
When air is pulled through the
nose during inhalation, it pass
es through the turbinate bones,
whose structure imparts a
swirling motion to incoming air.
Dust motes, bacteria, small
insects and the like smack into
the walls of the airways and get
trapped in the mucus.
Yum, yum.
