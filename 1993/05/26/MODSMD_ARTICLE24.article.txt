# The 						science of nutrition, power drinks and Wheaties
## To carb up or not to carb up 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
If your idea of sports food is
beer and pretzels, think again.
Sports nutrition is a science.
Maybe it's not physics, but it is
complex. Understanding how and
what foods allow an athlete to per
form at peak performance is essen
tial if you take your own athletic
endeavors, varsity or not, serious
ly-
Sorry, but despite what some
product labels may say, there is no
quick and easy way to achieve suc
cess in the sporting world through
your diet. "Power" diets, amino
acid supplements and liquid pro
tein concoctions are unnecessary,
ineffective and no substitute for a
well-balanced diet.
Worse still, they can be down
right dangerous to your health: A
few years ago, very low-protein liq
uid diets resulted in the death of
numerous users, causing the Food
and Drug Administration to warn
against such a diet without medi
cal supervision.
The real key to achieving peak
performance through food is to eat
a balanced diet, and to think of
food as energy. Just as your car
responds to the type of fuel you
give it, so does your body.
Carbs and more carbs
The "high-octane" equivalent
for your body is undoubtedly the
carbohydrate group. You probably
know the carbos by taste: cereals,

whole-grain breads, pasta, pota
toes, bagels, muffins, rice,
bananas, raisins, yogurt, juices —
are all rich in complex carbohy
drates.
Carbohydrates (mono, di, and
poly- saccharides) are those little
molecular combinations of sugars
you probably memorized for a high
school biology class. But just
because they are made up of sugar,
don't write them off as "fattening"
— unless you eat too many of them.
The sugars found in carbohydrates
are essential to providing your
muscles with the energy they need.
In order to work properly, mus
cles need an available supply of
fuel. Only carbohydrates can be
stored in muscles; proteins and
fats are stored elsewhere. Carbs
are stored in the form of glycogen.
During strenuous exercise, it's
glycogen that gets converted into
glucose for energy.
The more you exercise, the
more glycogen you need to have
stored in your muscles. If you
deplete your storage of glycogen,
sometimes called "hitting the
wall," your body will start to burn
up muscle in its place.
In order to avoid exhausting the
body's fuel supply, one must main
tain adequate levels of it in the
body. "Carbo loading," once
thought to be the key to peak per
formance, has largely been dis
credited, because it violated this
rule. The idea behind it was to
increase workouts while decreas
ing carbohydrates intake for a few

days before big competitions.
Then, just before the event,
decrease exercise while dramati
cally increasing carbohydrates
intake.
This renders an athlete's mus
cles more vulnerable to breakdown
and fatigue — muscles take much
longer to recover once they've
exhausted glycogen supplies.
A high-carbo intake is still
encouraged prior to athletic com
petition, especially for endurance
events — those lasting more than
90 minutes. Carbo athletes, how
ever, are encouraged to make car
bohydrates a significant part of
their daily diet.
Breakfast of champions
Scoff if you want, but breakfast
really is for champions. Many ath
letes (and others) skip their morn
ing Wheaties because they are
"not hungry," they "don't have
time," or they're "on a diet." Yet
breakfast can be a high carbohy
drate energy booster for athletes
who need to fuel their muscles.
Without it athletes generally train
less effectively, suffer needless
fatigue and perform below their
optimum.
Breakfast skippers also suffer
from decreased concentration,
slowing down efficiency in the
morning. Gating a "good" break
fast in the morning prevents this
and provides more energy during
an afternoon workout.
Breakfast doesn't have to be
fancy in order to get you revved for

a workout. High-carbohydrate
choices include: cold or hot cereal,
pancakes, waffles, toast, muffins,
bagels, fruit, juice, banana bread
and yogurt.
Eat after you pump-up
Eating after you exercise is just
as important as eating before.
Again, timing of food intake is
important — there is a "window of
opportunity," zero to four hours
after working out, during which
muscles need to be re-fueled and
are most receptive. A recommend
ed intake of carbos to replenish
what was burned is a half gram per
pound of body weight.
Fluid intake is another vital
contributor to sport performance.
It's true you won't starve to death
during competition but you can
easily become dehydrated.
Body fluids have important
jobs: They transport glucose to the
working muscles and carry lactic
acid from the muscles. Sweating is
important too: It dissipates heat
through the skin. If too much
sweat is lost, the body looses the
ability to provide both adequate
circulation to the muscles and
cooling to the body's surface.
Sweating also causes you to lose
small amounts of sodium, potassi
um and electrolytes necessary for
keeping the body in fluid-balance.
Sports drinks, like Gatorade,
aren't really gimmicks — they pro
vide a quick carbohydrate source
and essential fluid. But, they do
not rehydrate better than water.
