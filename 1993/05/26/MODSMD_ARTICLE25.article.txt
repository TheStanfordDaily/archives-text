# The 						spin on tennis

A rhythmic series of "pops"
echo through the Tennis Stadi
um as each player's shot draws
an answering fire from the
opponent across the net. Mus
cles flex, lungs strain and sweat
flies; rackets are weapons as the
competitors engage in deadly
combat.
It may seem like war, but
tennis today is a game of spin.
Spin determines the ball's flight
path and dictates how it
bounces off the court.
A tennis ball curves more
than a baseball. Where a base
ball pitcher uses his shoulder
and arm to impart spin to the
ball, a tennis player uses the
racket stroke. A pitched base
ball can be a fastball, a slider or
a curveball, depending on its
spin. Most tennis shots use
either top-spin or under-spin to
help the ball work with the play
er and against gravity.
According to Stanford tennis
coach Dick Gould, a ball with
top-spin rotates clockwise from
top to bottom and turns away
from the hitter. A player creates
top-spin by swinging the racket
up or over the top of the ball.
Many competitors choose
top-spin for forehand and back
hand groundstrokes, because
the spin has a bell-shaped curve
that drops the ball quickly into
the court. The player can hit the
ball harder and higher over the

net, and it will still fall down
into the court. The rotation also
causes the ball to bounce higher
off the court, often making it
difficult to return.
Under-spin, an alternate
spin for groundstrokes and vol
leys, turns the ball counter
clockwise from bottom to top.
The tennis ball's trajectory flat
tens as the ball spins.
The advantages of under
spin emerge on a faster court
surface like grass. The ball skips
off the court and stays low to
the ground.
Gould says under-spin works
well on approach shots, and it can
also be used to change the pace of
a match. A shorter racket swing
creates under-spin, making it a
defensive technique if the player
is on the run or out of position.
Top-spin and under-spin are
common for groundstrokes and
volleys. For the serve, players
often choose side-spin, one of
many service spins.
Shoulder rotation, leg action
and wrist snap influence the
speed and power of a serve; but
while the tennis ball is in the
air, spin directs the ball.
Side-spin, says Gould, is a
basic service spin that rotates the
tennis ball on one side, depending
if the player is right or left- hand
ed. The ball bounces off the court
and spins away from the receiver.
The effects of side-spin, cou
pled with the player's strength
and power, make the serve an
offensive weapon.
