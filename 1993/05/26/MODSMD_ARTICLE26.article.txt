# THE 						SCIENCE OF SPORTS
## It's baseball, hot dogs apple pie and physics 
### Jim Morris Staff writer 
Sitting in the stands during a
baseball game, most spectators
usually think about hot dogs,
beer or whether the batter is
going to hit the next pitch out of
the park. Physics, however, isn't
on most people's minds.
But science, and more specifi
cally, physics, plays an integral
role in baseball — one that most
spectators never think about.

'As a pitcher, Arizona
ranks as one of the
worst places to throw
because the high alti
tude, high tempera
ture, and low humidity
could change a
Sunken Diamond pop
fly into a home run.'
— Todd Bartels

Arguably, the most difficult
act in sports is to hit a baseball.
In two-tenths of a second — the
time it takes to swear at your
professor under your breath —
the batter must have begun and
ended a 70 mph swing and con
nected with an 80 mph pitch.
It is no wonder that a baseball
player, swinging a two-and-a
half-inch diameter, 32-ounce
piece of wood or aluminum, has
such an arduous task.
If you thought making con
tact with the ball is difficult,
once contact is made — that lit
tle piece of yarn-wrapped cork
only returns a maximum of 35
percent of the total energy
applied to it. In contrast, a golf
ball offers up to a 75 percent
return. This is why a golf ball
hit by John Daly easily travels
300 yards (900 feet), while a
mammoth Jose Canseco home
run travels a mere 500 feet.
Numerous baseball players
have been frustrated at trying to
turn their pop-ups into doubles.
Some even try to doctor a wood
en bat by drilling a hole into the
barrel end and filling it with
cork. Although the lighter bat
gives the feeling of hitting
longer balls, the procedure is
both futile and illegal in the
majors.
In his book "The Physics of
Baseball," Robert Adair writes
that the, "cork, rubber, or what
ever stuffed into holes drilled in
bats certainly does not increase
the distance the ball can go
when hit by the bat."
Redshirt freshman baseball
player Troy Kent supported this
view, adding, "The cork in the
bat gives the effect of longer dis
tance due to the lightness of the

cork, not its added resilience. In
fact, an empty hole would
achieve the lightness effect bet
ter, but the drilling itself can
cause the bat to be more suscep
tible to breakage."
Finding the "sweet spot"
Corked or not, the batter's
ultimate goal is to hit the ball on
the "sweet spot" of the bat.
On a uniform bat, according
to Physics Prof. Robert Wag
oner, the sweet spot lies two
thirds down the length of the
stick from the handle. Here, the
rotational and translational
forces caused by impact of the
ball cancel each other out.
When the ball hits the bat,
there is a force exerted upon the
bat that causes it to move back
wards uniformly — similar to
when an entire car jolts back
ward when just a portion of the
bumper is impacted.
The second, but equal force
causes the barrel to move back
wards but the handle to move
forward — a rotation around
the bat's center of mass. The
first force causes both the barrel
and the handle to move back
wards.
When the ball strikes off the
bat's sweet spot it will travel
farther, since there is no jolt at
the handle where the batter's
hands grip the wood and there
fore, less energy is lost though
vibration.
Swung at an average of 70
mph, a bat will propel a ball at a
rate consistent with the speed of
the pitch. A squarely hit 40 mph
knuckle ball will travel 340 feet;
whereas, a crushed 98 mph
Nolan Ryan fast ball flies a
whopping 390 feet.
A wooden bat, according to
Adair, returns the incoming
pitch to the field with 35 percent
of its original energy. Thus, a
fast ball leaves the bat with a
higher speed than would a curve
ball because it has a greater
original velocity.
Even if the batter has the
best intentions in the world of
hitting the ball squarely on the
sweet spot, the world of pitching
does not resemble the straight
fastballs served up at Malibu
Grand Prix.
The floating knuckler
Pitching complicates the idea
of batting to an almost mystify
ing degree. Knuckle balls, curve
balls, sliders and even fastballs
that rise can twist the best of
the best into the chalky dirt of
the batter's box.
Various pitches employ dif
ferent aspects of physics. The
key to the movement — left,
right, up, down or whatever —
of the ball depends on the speed
and the spin the pitcher chooses
to throw the pitch.
A knuckle ball, currently used
by Charlie Hough of the Florida
Marlins, wins the most confus
ing pitch award. Its unpre
dictability baffles the batter, the

pitcher and the catcher as well.
This is why catchers of knuckle
ball pitchers, not knowing where
the ball will end up, wear gloves
three or four times the size of a
normal glove.
Thrown at low speeds,
between 40 and 50 miles per
hour, the knuckle ball will only
turn one-half rotation before it
crosses the plate from the pitch
er's hand.
The slow speed allows a tur
bulence to build up, while the
lack of spin causes the air to
remain at the front of the ball
and wreak havoc on the direc
tion it can go.
"Air turbulence can build up
during the flight of the pitch at
any point on the ball and cause
it to bounce any direction,"
Wagoner said. He added that as
the spin on the pitch increases
the turbulence smooths out.
How does the ball curve?
More frequently tossed than
the knuckle ball, however, is the
curveball. The curveball is
somewhat of a misnomer. If you
were to draw a straight line
from the pitcher's hand to the
catcher's mitt, the baseball
would only deviate from it, at
most, approximately three-and

a-half inches.
However, from the right
handed batter's point of view, a
right-handed pitcher's curve
would seem to move over 14
inches from left to right. The
batter's perception often counts
more than the actual physics of
the matter.
Some pitchers such as Stan
ford's Todd Bartels choose to
throw a curve focusing on the
vertical, not horizontal move
ment. "I throw a 12-to-six
curveball that spins from top to
bottom creating a drop. The
harder I throw it, the later it
will break and the harder for the
batter to recognize that it's com
' - )»
ing.
The curveball "breaks" on
account of two physics princi
ples. The first one is the spin —
whatever spin the pitcher
applies makes the ball curve and
determines its direction of cur
vature.
The spinning ball causes the
air directly surrounding it to
move in the direction of the
spin. If a right-handed pitcher
hurls a curveball in the 12-to
six fashion, the air on top of the
ball will be moving with the air
close to the ball, while on the
other side, the air close to the

ball moves opposite to the air
the ball is moving through.
The effect causes the top side of
the ball to spin faster than the bot
tom side, which induces a small
pressure beneath the ball and a
large pressure on top — resulting
in a downward moving ball.
The second and more encom
passing idea about the curvature
of a baseball shows the ball itself
generating a "wake" directly
behind the spin axis of the
curve.
"There is an equal and oppo
site force applied to the ball as a
result of the 'wake,' according to
Newton's Third Law of Motion,
that causes the ball to curve in
the specified direction," said
Wagoner, a high-school pitcher
himself.
These two principles, mainly
the second one, also govern the
flow of air over the wing of an
airplane that enable the plane to
fly-
The fastball, not unlike the
curveball, does move a bit side
to-side or up-and-down depend
ing on the throwing angle. This
small movement could be up to
four inches, according to Adair.
But can a fastball really rise?
Without gravity, a fastball leav
ing the pitcher's hand at high

speeds will indeed rise. But as
Wagoner pointed out, "No pitch
can escape the pull of gravity.
However, to the batter, a fast
ball that "rises" will approach
the plate at a higher trajectory
than a normal one, thus the
effect would be a relative rise,
and it works."
Even if the batter can choose
the right bat, can smack the ball
on the sweet spot, and can hit
whatever pitch is thrown, ele
ments of nature also play a role.
Variations in wind speed, air
temperature, humidity, and alti
tude all affect the distance a
baseball travels.
Adair's theoretical musings
about the effect of certain fac
tors on the flight of the ball were
confirmed by the real life obser
vations of Bartels.
"As a pitcher, Arizona ranks
as one of the worst places to
throw because the high altitude,
high temperature, and low
humidity could change a Sunken
Diamond pop fly into a home
run,"he said.
But the next time you're sit
ting in the cheap seats and watch
ing a ball fly out of the park, you
can comment on the science and
the humidity, for that matter, to
explain the home run.
