# Bo may know Diddley, but does Bo know the Sci of golf?
## When hitting a ball at Pebble Beach or at the community course, science affects your game more than you know 
### Nicholas Strauss Staff writer 
The golfer thinks about birdies and
bogies; about nature when traipsing
through bushes looking for a lost ball;
however, golfers seldom think about the
effect science has on the game.
Science is impacted in this game that
depends on ball spin, club angles and tra
jectory. The golfer's science begins with
club selection.
Different clubs cause the ball to fly dif
ferent distances for the same swing.
This is accomplished by altering the

angle of the club's face and therefore the
angle at which the ball rises after being
hit.
The long range clubs, like the one
wood (driver), hit the ball on a very flat
trajectory, whereas the short range
clubs, like a nine iron, send the ball on a
high arcing trajectory.
This may sound odd to some alumni
of Physics 51, but the aerodynamics of a
golf ball are such that it flies farthest
when "launched" at a fairly low angle,
about 12 degrees up from the ground. It
then flies a long gentle rise for perhaps
as many as 250 or 300 yards before

slowing and dropping to earth quite
suddenly.
The wide selection of clubs allows a
golfer to maintain a constant swing
style, and vary range and ball trajecto
ry through club selection. Different
clubs have evolved for these differing
needs.
Woods are, as their name suggests,
clubs with large, heavy, wooden heads.
Intended for long ranges, they launch
the ball on a low arcing trajectory, which
makes them a poor choice for clearing
close obstacles — so they are usually
used to start from the tee.

The golfer's utility clubs are the irons,
ranging from one to nine, plus a few spe
cialty varieties, irons are used for middle
range shots. The one iron has a range
almost as great as the shorter ranged
four wood. At the other end of the spec
trum, the specialty sand iron kicks the
ball steeply up for escape from a bunker,
but sends it less than thirty yards down
range.
For very short ranges, and very high
accuracy, the golfer chooses a putter, the
club familiar to every one who has ever
spent Friday at Malibu Fun Center's
mini-golf course. The putter's face is per
pendicular to the ground, keeping the
ball flat and in contact with the earth for
maximum precision and control.
Clubs alone do not determine the
nature of a shot, special techniques can
varies angle and range.
Chip shots are low powered, short
range, low angle hits with great accura
cy. Using one of the nominally • longer
ranged irons, a golfer can chip the ball
twenty or thirty yards with remarkable
accuracy and great control over its spin.
Pitches have a range similar to chip
shots, but use the higher numbered,
high angle, irons to lob the ball over a
final obstacle to the green.
Control of backspin is a key technique
for a golfer to master. Backspin exerts
little effect in flight, but great impact
once the ball in on the ground. A back
spinning ball spins in the direction oppo
site to the direction it will roll when it
hits the ground.
Once the ball hits the ground, the
backspin slows its roll. To give a ball
backspin, it is hit early, with the club still
moving somewhat downwards. A little bit
of this downward movements carries
over into the ball's reverse spin.

Probably the most obvious bit of sci
ence in golf is the dimples on the ball.
The 366 little dimples on a golf ball actu
ally make it fly farther, and aren't just to
keep the ball from rolling off the table.
The dimples create little eddies which
help keep the airflow along the back of
the golf ball attached, reducing the drag
of the ball in flight and extending the
range over which it can be hit.
Normally, as the air flows from the
front of a moving golf ball to the back, it
starts to detach from the ball. Instead of
following the contours of the ball, the air
pulls away, creating a region of vacuum
behind the ball. This creates a lot of
drag, slowing the ball and shortening the
distance it can be hit.
The turbulence created by the dim
ples helps to keep the air attached to the
golf baii. This shrinks the size of the vac
uum region, reducing the drag and
increasing the distance of the shot.
On top of all this, there is consider
able technology involved in the clubs a
golfer uses. Once nothing but hollow
metal shafts with wooden or metal
heads, modern golf clubs are marvels of
aerospace technology.
Materials such as carbon fiber and
titanium are appearing in the shafts of
golf clubs as manufacturers seek a club
with optimum weight distribution and
flexibility. The flexibility of a club is very
important, since it acts as a spring to
increase the power of a golf stroke.
As the stroke begins, the club flexes
back, the head trailing behind. This
places tension in the shaft, just like a
wound up spring. Just about at the bot
tom of the stroke, at the point of contact
with the ball, the shaft starts to un-bend,
accelerating the head and increasing
power.
