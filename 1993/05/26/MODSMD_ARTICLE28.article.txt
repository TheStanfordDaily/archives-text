## Richards hits long off tee to lead Cardinal linksters 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
From 26th to fifth.
That's how much the Cardinal
women's golf team has improved this
spring season in the national rankings.
And a driving force behind this tremen
dous success has been senior captain
and first team All-Pacific 10 Conference
selection Martha Richards.
Richards, a fifth-year senior from
Hudson, Wis., came to Stanford in 1988
as a highly touted two-sport athlete. As a
high-school basketball player, she was
the third all-time leading scorer in Wis
consin's history. During her senior sea
son at Hudson High school, she was the
AP and UPI Player of the Year. She was
named to Street and Smith magazine's
All-American first team, averaging 26.6
points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 3.9
steals.
Richards went on to play three sea
sons for the Cardinal women's basket
ball team, and was a member of the
national-champion squad in 1990.
After redshirting in golf her fresh
man year, Richards played both basket
ball and golf during her sophomore and
junior seasons. She became a stand out
linkster in little time, developing a rep
utation for her long drives.
"I think I probably decided to play
two sports since being a complete ath
lete is very important to me," Richards
said.
During the 1990-91 season, after
playing in only a few golf tournaments
during the year, Richards placed 40th
at the NCAA Championships at Ohio
State, helping the Cardinal to a sixth
place finish.

Following that showing, Richards
made the decision to play only golf.
"It was a decision that Tara [Van-
Derveer] and I made," Richards said.
"It was tough, since I had been play
ing basketball since I was about six or
seven."
Richards consequently started focus
ing exclusively on her golf game, a move
which began paying dividends the next
spring, as she captured three top-10
tournament finishes. Her best perfor
mance came at the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Tempe, Ariz., where she fin
ished seventh at the notoriously diffi
cult Karsten Golf Course. At the NCAA
Championships, held on the same
course, Richards once again finished
40th, while Stanford took a school
record fourth.
This spring, Richards has taken her
golf game to another level, leading the
Cardinal in individual scoring in all but
two tournaments. She finished in the
top-10 in seven of her last 10 tourna
ments, and broke into the top-five on
five different occasions.
Her greatest accomplishment this
spring was winning the PING/Arizona
State Invitational at Karsten Golf
Course with an amazing two-over-par
218. Other noteworthy finishes includ
ed a seventh-place showing at the Pac
-10 Championships in Walla Walla,
Wash., and third-place honors at the
California Intercollegiate, held at Stan
ford earlier this month.
Most recently, Richards finished tied
for third at the NCAA Regionals in
Tempe, Ariz. Her marked improve
ments in all aspects of her game
prompted coach Tim Baldwin to declare
last week, "If she's not a first team All-

American, something is the matter with
the voting."
Baldwin will have to wait until after
the NCAA Championships to find out if
his predictions come true. In the mean
time, Richards has kept her success in
perspective, constantly looking for ways
to improve her game. "Playing golf, I
learn something new every day," she
said.
Richards is also optimistic about the
Cardinal's chances at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Athens, Ga., a four-round
tournament which starts today. Seven
teen teams will compete for the NCAA
title, and Richards believes that San
Jose State, Georgia, Arizona State and
Stanford all have a chance to come
home champions.
"Our goal is a top-10 finish. I think
to win it, we all have to play well and
put in a great tournament," she said.
"We have plenty of talent to be a con
tender."
