### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
In her first trip to the Bay Area
in 33 years, Queen Sirikit of Thai
land will visit Stanford today to re
ceive the 1993 Woman of the Year
award from the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender.
Chosen "because she has given
visibility to issues that confront
women in the world," Queen
Sirikit is also being honored for
the work she has done in improv
ing women's education and eco
nomic status in Thailand, said Iris
Litt, institute's director.
The award will be given for the
first time this year. While it was
not specially created for the
queen, her accomplishments gave
an added impetus to the insti
tute's plans for establishing the
award.
"It was the queen's naming
1992 the 'Year of the Woman' in
Thailand that galvanized it," Litt
said.
Invitations to the ceremony
were sent out to some faculty and

affiliates of the institute, as well as
various members of the Bay
Area's Thai community.
Because some people did not re
spond to the invitations, the event
— which was originally closed to
the public — is now open to any
one who obtained leftover tickets
given out at the Tresidder Ticket
Office yesterday.
About 400 Thais from around
the Bay Area are expected to at
tend, said Phisak Chakkapak, the
head of a local Thai organization
that has helped the institute orga
nize the event.
"We're very excited," Chakka
pak said, especially since the
queen has not been to the United
States since 1985. The queen, who
with her husband heads Thai
land's constitutional monarchy, is
widely revered in the country.
Litt will present the award in a
ceremony beginning at 4 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. After opening
remarks made by Litt and Univer
