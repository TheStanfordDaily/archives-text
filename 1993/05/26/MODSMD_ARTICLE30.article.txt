# Three seasons on the brink: how I spent my junior year
## 
### 
TF YOU DON'T know where you're going,
i you '11 probably end up somewhere."
— Yogi Berra
In the existential framework of baseball's resi
dent philosopher, I guess I've ended up here, with
some 30-odd column-inches to close one of the
most enriching chapters of my life to date — my
two volumes as a Daily sports editor.
But how can I possibly encapsulate the thou
sands of hours spent developing a new generation
of sportswriters in just a few hundred words?
What about the time invested forging relation
ships with Stanford's immense sporting commu
nity, from athletes to coaches to support staff?

Where do I pay tribute to my editorial colleagues,
who supported me through eight and a half
months of joyous ecstasy, painful agony and the
whole spectrum of emotions in between?
Just as when I accepted this position last May,
I find that now I don't know where I'm going. In
what has become a familiar position — staring at
a computer screen and waiting for the right
words, all the while retaining the fantasy that my
deadline lies far in the future — I want to do the
impossible, relating all that I have learned as an
editor about sports, about people, about myself,
about life.
I wish I could convey in a concise manner how
to make the leap from contributing to a sports
page to creating one. Or how to tiptoe around a
one-room double at 2 a.m. without waking up a
light-sleeping roommate.
Or how to live on the edge, minimizing the
number of inevitable crises that arise on an any
given night. Or how every person above and below
an editor in the chain of command can hold a
unique place in his heart.
The task is too monumental, though, and I pre
fer to talk about what goes on in brightly-lit are
nas between end zones, baskets and goals, not my
struggles between 4 p.m. and God-knows-when in
the dank cubicle that serves as my office.
I also realize my limitations — that I write
largely for the serious sports fan and don't have
the flair for the dramatic of others who have
graced my page.
I am not Kevin Jeffery, with the power to:
• share my thoughts on one topic,
• bounce effortlessly to another, or
• bullet-point at will.
I cannot be David Schwartz, somehow inter
spersing tales from ill-fated days at the race track
or all-you-can-eat barbecues in the Washington
Palouse into my sports parlance. Mike
McDonough I am not either, as I lack the ability to
make-nifty-hyphenated-words-that-create-extra
long-uncuttable-paragraphs, or to come up with
the right pithy saying to fit any situation. And,
alas, try as I might, Tish Williams has it all over
me with her unmistakable style, following a
McDonoughian long paragraph with a short, sup
plementary quip.
Shoot me now.
So, in my own manner, I will give a glimpse of
what it was like to take in a bittersweet 1992-93

season for Stanford sports behind the editor's
desk.
For example, no one will soon forget the conse
quences of the night of Nov. 5, 1992. At least any
one who remembers J.J. Lasley won't. My deci
sion (and the subsequent approval of my editor
in-chief) to allow Cardinal fans the opportunity to
see all of the senior running back broke ground in
football coverage.
This is not to mention, of course, the commo
tion created when guests arrived on campus for
Parents' Weekend; is that what they mean by lib
eral education?
The night of Dec. 19, 1992 brings pleasant
memories to mind as well. There I was, in the
middle of my longest stretch off, delaying my fam
ily's Hanukkah celebration so that I could pick up
the faint radio call of our women's volleyball tri
umph in the NCAA Championships. The ghost of
UCLA Bruins past broke free from the Cardinal's
conscience that night, but I might need to enlist
the help of Bev Oden (the spiking goddess herself)
if I want to extract the ghosts of Hanukkah future
from mine.
Then there's the Blockbusting conclusion to
Bill Walsh's first season after reassuming Stan
ford's athletic throne. When Jeffery, my football
writer, could not make the trip to Florida, I "came
to the rescue," truncating my winter vacation for
five days in paradise.
Chalk up a Pacific 10 Conference co-champi
onship, a victory over Penn State, the vaulting
into national prominence of cornerback Darrien
Gordon and a No. 9 national ranking to cap off a
remarkable 10-3 year.
Things could only get worse, though, and that
they did. First, there was men's basketball, a 7-23,
injury-riddled travesty. Had anyone even heard of
Chaminade before we lost to them? At least there
was the 20-point win over USC and Marcus Lol
lie's fist-pumping jumper to put us up at the half
against Arizona. After the swim teams repeated
their NCAA titles with Swiss-clock-like precision,
the women's basketball team added a down note to
Spring Break when it fell disappointingly short of
the Final Four, right before my ESPN-filled eyes.
Val Whiting, Molly Goodenbour, Chris MacMurdo
and Angela Taylor — my hat goes off to you for a
valiant final effort, even if Molly hasn't yet signed
my victory ball.
Jair Lynch made April a little easier by leading
Stanford to a fourth national title, this one in
men's gymnastics. But the men's volleyball squad
fell shy of a Final Four berth, despite the heroic
efforts of Player of the Year Canyon Ceman and
everybody's Ail-American, Dave Goss. As for the
Cardinal baseball and tennis teams — well, you
know the story.
My worst night on the job, however, probably
came just last Sunday, May 15. To make a
loooooooong story short, I ended up overseeing
Monday's page until the sun was ready to peek
back over the horizon at 4:20 a.m. My first fleeting
thought, honestly, was to resign my post with just
two weeks left; after all, I didn't have time for the
pain.
It was just as I was waking my beleaguered
roommate at five o'clock in the goshdarn morn
ing, however, that it all came to me — I had time
for the pain, because I felt the twinge of responsi
bility that goes with being a leader.
What had started as a mild interest in getting
ahead at the Daily (after all, I do get to come back
next year, don't I?) had become an iiber-fulltime
passion. I loved my job. It might have driven me
crazy, but I loved my job. And I guess I ended up
somewhere.

ford's athletic throne. When Jeffery, my football
writer, could not make the trip to Florida, I "came
to the rescue," truncating my winter vacation for
five days in paradise.
Chalk up a Pacific 10 Conference co-champi
onship, a victory over Penn State, the vaulting
into national prominence of cornerback Darrien
Gordon and a No. 9 national ranking to cap off a
remarkable 10-3 year.
Things could only get worse, though, and that
they did. First, there was men's basketball, a 7-23,
injury-riddled travesty. Had anyone even heard of
Chaminade before we lost to them? At least there
was the 20-point win over USC and Marcus Lol
lie's fist-pumping jumper to put us up at the half
against Arizona. After the swim teams repeated
their NCAA titles with Swiss-clock-like precision,
the women's basketball team added a down note to
Spring Break when it fell disappointingly short of
the Final Four, right before my ESPN-filled eyes.
Val Whiting, Molly Goodenbour, Chris MacMurdo
and Angela Taylor — my hat goes off to you for a
valiant final effort, even if Molly hasn't yet signed
my victory ball.
Jair Lynch made April a little easier by leading
Stanford to a fourth national title, this one in
men's gymnastics. But the men's volleyball squad
fell shy of a Final Four berth, despite the heroic
efforts of Player of the Year Canyon Ceman and
everybody's Ail-American, Dave Goss. As for the
Cardinal baseball and tennis teams — well, you
know the story.
My worst night on the job, however, probably
came just last Sunday, May 15. To make a
loooooooong story short, I ended up overseeing
Monday's page until the sun was ready to peek
back over the horizon at 4:20 a.m. My first fleeting
thought, honestly, was to resign my post with just
two weeks left; after all, I didn't have time for the
pain.
It was just as I was waking my beleaguered
roommate at five o'clock in the goshdarn morn
ing, however, that it all came to me — I had time
for the pain, because I felt the twinge of responsi
bility that goes with being a leader.
What had started as a mild interest in getting
ahead at the Daily (after all, I do get to come back
next year, don't I?) had become an iiber-fulltime
passion. I loved my job. It might have driven me
crazy, but I loved my job. And I guess I ended up
somewhere.

TF YOU DON'T know where you're going,
i you '11 probably end up somewhere."
— Yogi Berra
In the existential framework of baseball's resi
dent philosopher, I guess I've ended up here, with
some 30-odd column-inches to close one of the
most enriching chapters of my life to date — my
two volumes as a Daily sports editor.
But how can I possibly encapsulate the thou
sands of hours spent developing a new generation
of sportswriters in just a few hundred words?
What about the time invested forging relation
ships with Stanford's immense sporting commu
nity, from athletes to coaches to support staff?

Where do I pay tribute to my editorial colleagues,
who supported me through eight and a half
months of joyous ecstasy, painful agony and the
whole spectrum of emotions in between?
Just as when I accepted this position last May,
I find that now I don't know where I'm going. In
what has become a familiar position — staring at
a computer screen and waiting for the right
words, all the while retaining the fantasy that my
deadline lies far in the future — I want to do the
impossible, relating all that I have learned as an
editor about sports, about people, about myself,
about life.
I wish I could convey in a concise manner how
to make the leap from contributing to a sports
page to creating one. Or how to tiptoe around a
one-room double at 2 a.m. without waking up a
light-sleeping roommate.
Or how to live on the edge, minimizing the
number of inevitable crises that arise on an any
given night. Or how every person above and below
an editor in the chain of command can hold a
unique place in his heart.
The task is too monumental, though, and I pre
fer to talk about what goes on in brightly-lit are
nas between end zones, baskets and goals, not my
struggles between 4 p.m. and God-knows-when in
the dank cubicle that serves as my office.
I also realize my limitations — that I write
largely for the serious sports fan and don't have
the flair for the dramatic of others who have
graced my page.
I am not Kevin Jeffery, with the power to:
• share my thoughts on one topic,
• bounce effortlessly to another, or
• bullet-point at will.
I cannot be David Schwartz, somehow inter
spersing tales from ill-fated days at the race track
or all-you-can-eat barbecues in the Washington
Palouse into my sports parlance. Mike
McDonough I am not either, as I lack the ability to
make-nifty-hyphenated-words-that-create-extra
long-uncuttable-paragraphs, or to come up with
the right pithy saying to fit any situation. And,
alas, try as I might, Tish Williams has it all over
me with her unmistakable style, following a
McDonoughian long paragraph with a short, sup
plementary quip.
Shoot me now.
So, in my own manner, I will give a glimpse of
what it was like to take in a bittersweet 1992-93

season for Stanford sports behind the editor's
desk.
For example, no one will soon forget the conse
quences of the night of Nov. 5, 1992. At least any
one who remembers J.J. Lasley won't. My deci
sion (and the subsequent approval of my editor
in-chief) to allow Cardinal fans the opportunity to
see all of the senior running back broke ground in
football coverage.
This is not to mention, of course, the commo
tion created when guests arrived on campus for
Parents' Weekend; is that what they mean by lib
eral education?
The night of Dec. 19, 1992 brings pleasant
memories to mind as well. There I was, in the
middle of my longest stretch off, delaying my fam
ily's Hanukkah celebration so that I could pick up
the faint radio call of our women's volleyball tri
umph in the NCAA Championships. The ghost of
UCLA Bruins past broke free from the Cardinal's
conscience that night, but I might need to enlist
the help of Bev Oden (the spiking goddess herself)
if I want to extract the ghosts of Hanukkah future
from mine.
