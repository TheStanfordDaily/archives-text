# Walsh apologizes to Huskies

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Stanford coach Bill Walsh, saying
he felt foolish and embarrassed,
apologized yesterday to the Uni
versity of Washington for charac
terizing the rival school's football
program as a rogue operation.
Walsh, speaking by telephone
from Stanford, said he called
Washington coach Don James and
apologized during a five-minute
conversation.
The Stanford coach said he also
would call Washington athletic
director Barbara Hedges "to
restate my apology."
"I was in error. I was out of
line with my remarks," Walsh
said. "What they do is their busi
ness and I have no right to remark
on it as a sister institution."
Hedges, reached by phone by
The Associated Press, declined to
comment on whether Walsh had
contacted her. James was not
immediately available.
Walsh's remarks about Wash
ington were made last week in a
speech to Stanford alumni and
reported Tuesday by the Sacra
mento Bee. Walsh, according to

the newspaper, said Washington
ran an outlaw football program
that relied on athletic "mercenar
ies" and cared very little about
the players' academic develop
ment.
Those allegations were flatly
denied by Washington officials.
"Bill Walsh has a right to say
what he wants, but maybe he
should be better informed before
he calls people mercenaries,"
said Jim Daves, Washington's
sports information director. "Is
Lincoln Kennedy a mercenary?
Is Mark Brunell a mercenary?
We spend $670,000 a year on
tutoring athletes. We have a pro
gram that allows athletes to
return for their degrees after
they finish their eligibility. Does
that sound like we don't care
about them?"
Walsh said he never thought
his remarks to the alumni group
would be publicized.
"I thought I was in a setting
where I wouldn't have to concern
myself with the media," he said.
"But that's not a very good
answer. Whatever the setting, it

was foolish, out of line. I was
wrong, let's face it."
He said he hopes his apology
helps to smooth out any bitter
ness his earlier remarks engen
dered.
"I hope it doesn't continue. If it
does, I'm going to have to live
with it,"he said.
But he didn't totally back off of
his remarks, either.
"My rather unfortunate
remarks in no way represented
Stanford University or its
thoughts on this matter. They
were my feelings solely," Walsh
said.
The two schools meet in a sea
son-opening Pacific-10 Confer
ence game at Husky Stadium on
Sept. 4.
Walsh, a former San Francisco
49ers coach and network analyst,
also has admitted he made some
"mistakes" in recruiting since
returning to Stanford last year.
The list includes a photo of
Walsh taken at a recruit's news
conference and a "coincidental"
visit by Joe Montana while Walsh
was courting future talent.
