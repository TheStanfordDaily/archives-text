# Reunion for internees planned
## 
### Carrie Chang Staff writer 
In an effort to recapture history, a group of stu
dents, staff and faculty is planning a reunion for
the Japanese-American Stanford students who
were interned 61 years ago, to be held at the
beginning of Alumni Week in October.
"Recognition of these alumni is long overdue,"
said Assoc. History Prof. Gordon Chang, whose
research on the history of Asian-Americans ini
tially sparked the Japanese-American Reunion
Project. "These students went through something
no other Stanford alumni has ever had to endure,
that their own government had forced them into
detention camps and disrupted their lives in fun
damental ways."
The three-day event will feature a ceremony
hosted by University President Gerhard Casper,
the presentation of a plaque honoring the alumni
at the rededication of Okada House, as well as a
series of panels and films on the internment-camp

experience.
Invitations have been extended to 17 Japanese-
American students who were enrolled at Stanford
during the 1941-42 academic year.
"The reunion will not be so much a
Japanese-American event as a historical
event which involves the whole university,"
said graduate student Ron Nakao, a member
of the project. He added that Casper had per
sonally extended invitations to the alumni to
attend.
Nakao hopes the reunion will "bring out the
links that Stanford has as an institution to the
history of the internment camps, as well as show
the state of "democracy in America in times of
stress and in times of war."
Freshman David Tanaka, another project
member, described the reunion's possibilities for
heightening historical awareness. "You can talk to
them and learn first-hand what it was like, and
not just through a book or film," he explained.
"It's like living history."
