# 14 employees laid off after Development reorganization
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Fourteen employees have been laid off in
a reorganization of the Office of Develop
ment that will free up around $1 million for
new fund-raising programs.
Three senior managers are among those
who lost their jobs May 18, said Vice Pres-

ident of Development
John Ford. The decision
came after the Develop
ment Office received only
a tenth of the money Ford
had requested for new
programs.
"A lot of what you invest
in today doesn't pay off for
five, 10, 25 years," Ford
said, explaining why it is
important for the office to

put more money into the "absolutely cru
cial" areas of donor relations, market re
search, information systems and annual
funds.
Development Assoc. Vice President
Stephen Peeps also emphasized the need to
keep programs current. "On a personal
level, I obviously feel a great deal of sadness"
for those being laid off, he said. "On an or
ganizational basis, I think this is something
the Development Office must do to invest in
new initiatives."
Hard decisions had to be made, Peeps
said. "We, like everyone else, have had to

live with budget constraints."
The employees who were let go include
the directors of services and systems, the
annual fund and communications. After the
layoffs the department will have 216 em
ployees.
Ann Bilodeau, the director of services
and systems, said the reorganization in
her area did not come as a surprise to her.
It makes sense, she said, and she is hope
ful it will allow the office to obtain more
temporary help and new computer tech
nology.
Much of the $1 million freed by the reor
ganization will pay for annual-funds pro
grams that solicit donations from alumni
and friends of the University. "We just have
to do better in broadening our base of sup
port," Ford said.
He expressed concern that the Universi
ty's base funding is currently too narrow,
with just 23 percent of alumni making gifts
annually. At other institutions such as Yale
and Princeton, Ford said, 40 to 50 percent
donate annually to the schools.
The possibility of personnel cuts was
raised when Provost Gerald Lieberman an
nounced last month that the University had
budgeted only $2 million in incremental
funds for new programs, Peeps said.
Ford said he had requested more than $1
million for his office but received only
$100,000 from the pool of incremental funds.
Lieberman "was not in a position to allot
much," Ford added.
