## Scientists plan to conduct nuclear waste tests at SLAC this summer 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
A series of experiments designed to
help find safer ways of processing and
storing nuclear waste will be conduct
ed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center this summer.
In July, a team of scientists from the
Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico will bring a small amount
of neptunium and plutonium for a
study using specialized equipment
only available at SLAC and two other
facilities in the United States.
The main purpose of the experiments,
said SLAC Assoc. Director Arthur Bi
enenstock, is to study how radioactive
materials "bond and react" with other
material around them. This will allow
scientists to design better ways of storing
and processing such material.
"The Department of Energy has a
major problem cleaning up weapons
complexes, and the nation has a prob
lem with storing nuclear waste pro
duced by power plants," he said. "We
hope to provide information to assist
[cleaning upl such sites and assessing
the [viability] of storage areas."

One experiment, for example, will
examine how neptunium, a nuclear
byproduct, bonds with clay found at
Yucca Mountain, Nev., a proposed nu
clear waste storage site, Bienenstock
said.
The radioactive material — a total of
about two-tenths of a gram — will be re
turned to Los Alamos immediately after
the experiment, which should take about
two weeks. SLAC officials stressed that
adequate safety precautions will be
taken in handling tne material.
Steven Conradson, who will head
the team from Los Alamos, said the re
sults from the experiments could even
tually make nuclear waste safer for the
environment. "These experiments will
hopefully give us a handle on the chem
ical reactions that will occur during the
processing of nuclear wastes."
This knowledge also would make it
more difficult for a terrorist group to
fashion a crude weapon, Conradson
said.
The team will use SLAC's Positron-
Electron Asymmetric Ring to direct in
tense X-rays at small samples of the ra
dioactive materials to see how they
bond in solution or with other sub

stances, such as clay.
Bienenstock said the powerful X
rays generated by the equipment — up
to 10 million times as intense as those
from a normal X-ray tube — permits
detailed analysis of complex atomic
bonding.
Though no scientists at SLAC will
be directly involved, Bienenstock said
that SLAC personnel will be used to
maintain the equipment. In addition,
the techniques involved were devel
oped at SLAC, and "We can also pro
vide advice and high-level expertise,"
Bienenstock said.
The material will be kept inside
three separate containers at all times,
Bienenstock said. He said that two re
view panels studied the safety of the
experiment before concluding that it
would not pose a significant risk.
"I know people are worried about
this, but they also have to worry about
what we're leaving behind for our chil
dren. ... It is critically important to
clean up this nuclear waste and learn
to contain it safely," he said.
"If we can do something that con
tributes significantly to that endeavor,
I want to do it."
