An excited and adoring
crowd greeted Queen Sirikit of
Thailand yesterday afternoon
in Kresge Auditorium as she ac
cepted the 1993 Woman of the
Year Award from Stanford's In
stitute for Research on Women
and Gender.
Honoring her work in im
proving women's economic and
educational status in Thailand,
the relatively short award cere
mony highlighted the queen's
accomplishments while pre
senting a picture of life in Thai
land.
The audience that nearly
filled the auditorium — com
posed mostly of Thai people who
had been explicitly instructed
on protocol for the ceremony —
craned their necks to see the
queen as she entered, with some
bowing and others clasping
their hands in the traditional
Thai greeting as she passed by.
In his opening remarks, Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper praised the queen —
who is widely revered in Thai
land — for being a model of
"royal leadership" who had cho
sen to be of service to her people

rather than sitting back to enjoy
a "fairy-tale life."
Referring to the phrase
"happy as a king," Casper said
that "in reality, a king or
queen's happiness probably
rarely amounts to more than
the fleeting satisfaction that
stems from work well done."
"Stanford seizes the moment
of your visit to honor you for
leadership and for work well
done," he said.
After Casper's welcome,
Marjorie Shaevitz, chair of the
California Commission of the
Status of Women, read a procla
mation recognizing the queen's
work as head of several public
service foundations and her
promotion of native Thai
crafts.
The gender institute's
award, which is in its first year,
"was established by the insti
tute to recognize women of sig
nificant achievement and those
who have made significant con
tributions to improving the
lives of women," said Iris Litt,
the institute's director. "It is
our hope that this award will
serve to focus international at
tention on women leaders who
