### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
An excited and adoring
crowd greeted Queen Sirikit of
Thailand yesterday afternoon
in Kresge Auditorium as she ac
cepted the 1993 Woman of the
Year Award from Stanford's In
stitute for Research on Women
and Gender.
Honoring her work in im
proving women's economic and
educational status in Thailand,
the relatively short award cere
mony highlighted the queen's
accomplishments while pre
senting a picture of life in Thai
land.
The audience that nearly
filled the auditorium — com
posed mostly of Thai people who
had been explicitly instructed
on protocol for the ceremony —
craned their necks to see the
queen as she entered, with some
bowing and others clasping
their hands in the traditional
Thai greeting as she passed by.
In his opening remarks, Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper praised the queen —
who is widely revered in Thai
land — for being a model of
"royal leadership" who had cho
sen to be of service to her people

rather than sitting back to enjoy
a "fairy-tale life."
Referring to the phrase
"happy as a king," Casper said
that "in reality, a king or
queen's happiness probably
rarely amounts to more than
the fleeting satisfaction that
stems from work well done."
"Stanford seizes the moment
of your visit to honor you for
leadership and for work well
done," he said.
After Casper's welcome,
Marjorie Shaevitz, chair of the
California Commission of the
Status of Women, read a procla
mation recognizing the queen's
work as head of several public
service foundations and her
promotion of native Thai
crafts.
The gender institute's
award, which is in its first year,
"was established by the insti
tute to recognize women of sig
nificant achievement and those
who have made significant con
tributions to improving the
lives of women," said Iris Litt,
the institute's director. "It is
our hope that this award will
serve to focus international at
tention on women leaders who

inspire and stimulate."
The queen accepted the award
from Litt on behalf of Thailand.
"Stanford University and the
institute are stretching out their
hands overseas to affirm friend
ship with a whole nation in a dif
ferent part of the globe," she
said.
In the speech that followed, the
queen told the audience she
would try to "bring you a picture
of my country Thailand so that
Stanford will know what we are

living like."
She went on to describe some of
Thailand's problems, which range
from low food production to ram
pant local diseases, but maintained
that she does not feel pessimistic
about her country's future.
"This is because I feel that we
in Thailand also have many
things going in our favor which
will help us to overcome all diffi
culties and see us through," she
said. "The Thai people have an
innate sense of artistry and pos
sess creative minds which are
revealed in the many beautiful
and artistic pieces of handicraft
that I have encouraged them to
produce."

The audience rose again as the
queen exited, with a few shouting
Thai cheers and exclamations of
celebration as the Thai national
anthem came to an end.
After the queen's exit, the
crowd lingered outside the audito
rium, taking pictures and ardent
ly discussing their admiration of
the monarch.
"Her speech was very moving.
She doesn't take any credit and
instead gives it all to the peo
ple," said Neeracha Tay
chakhoonavudh, a second-year
Business School student and
one of several Thai students
who volunteered to usher for
the event.

"I think she's very professional
and deserves the award. We
would have had a hard time see
ing her if we were in Thailand,"
said Jarurin, a Bay Area Thai
woman who had brought her fam
ily to campus for the rare occa
sion.
A few others travelled longer
distances to see the queen.
"Twenty-two of us in the Thai
Association of Southern Califor
nia came from Los Angeles,"
said Podjanee Suwanpanich,
who, like all the other members
of her group, was dressed up in a
traditional Thai silk outfit. "We
don't get much chance to see
her."
