# House to vote on tax hike today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - On the eve
of a critical vote, House leaders bar
gained with conservative Democrats
over curbs on federal spending yester
day in an effort to shore up support for
President Clinton's deficit-reduction
tax increase.
"We'll have the votes" to pass the
plan today, House Speaker Thomas
Foley told reporters after a party cau
cus and another round of arm-twisting.
"There is no other credible, effective
plan to deal with this problem."
Clinton sounded the same message,
saying his plan — even with an unpop
ular energy tax that would be felt by
the middle class — "is far fairer and
better for the economy" than a substi
tute awaiting consideration in the Sen
ate.
The bill nearing a House vote is the
very core of Clinton's economic pro

gram and the biggest part of his plan to
reduce the $300 billion annual deficit
by about $100 billion a year over the
next five years. The bill includes $250
billion in tax increases and $87 billion
in spending restraints.
It anticipates — but does not guar
antee — that Congress will find anoth
er $100 billion or so in spending cuts to
pass later this year. The remainder of
deficit reduction would result from less
borrowing.
Tough as it was for House members
to support one of the biggest tax
increases in history, it was conserva
tives' demand for tighter controls over
spending that kept leaders busy on the
eve of the vote.
The issue was how to write into the
bill some assurance that if mandatory
spending for such programs as Social
Security, Medicare and food stamps —

the "entitlements" that consume half
the budget — exceed annual targets,
the president and Congress will take
some action.
However, the agreement would not
impose strict limits on those programs.
Clinton also opposes rigid limits,
said White House spokesman George
Stephanopoulos, but favors a mecha
nism that would "clearly force an annu
al review" when entitlement spending
exceeds the targets.
At the closed caucus of House
Democrats, leaders and committee
chairmen pleaded for support for Clin
ton's program if, for nothing else, to
show that the party can lead.
Even though 30 of the 256 House
Democrats were said to have deep reser
vations about the bill pending agree
ment on spending restraints, Foley said
no one spoke against it at the caucus.
