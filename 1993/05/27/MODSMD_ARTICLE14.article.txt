University should mind
student concerns during
summer policy making

AT NOON today, students
will gather in White Plaza
and ask a very important
question: will students be fully rep
resented in upcoming University
decisions?
While most students are at
home over the summer, the Uni
versity will be conducting prelimi
nary research on undergraduate
education, so as to begin the ques
tioning of its structure. And given
the recent upheaval in the Office of
Multicultural Development and
the discussion surrounding the
review of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues report,
action on several fronts is conceiv
able.
University President Gerhard
Casper has assured students their
voices will be heard on these and
similar issues. However, the Uni
versity should ensure that no
unalterable steps are taken in
issues with critical importance to
students until they have once
again returned to campus and are
allowed to fully address their con
cerns or approval regarding the
various appointments and deci
sions. To heavy-handedly declare a
certain policy as already "imple
mented," and thereby set in stone,
would be a mistake.
Student involvement is impor
tant with regard to most concerns
within the University and particu
larly those issues that will have a
profound affect on the student
body.
Currently, there is a general
sense of confusion about what
decisions and appointments will be
made during the summer. Stu
dents must be informed about
what will go on and told how to
make their voices heard in these
processes.
For the University to attempt

an end-run around students, by
pushing through various
immutable changes over the sum
mer, would certainly evoke a spirit
of bitterness toward the adminis
tration.
This would only further the
widespread belief that the adminis
tration is, in many ways, an entity
that is more concerned with its
internal affairs than those of stu
dents or faculty.
President Casper has given his
word that students will have oppor
tunities to comment on policies and
appointments.
And while the University should
not merely close its doors over the
summer and do nothing, it should
also ensure students are fully
informed — at all intervals — of
the various changes to be made.
On a different note, today's
teach-in is an indication that stu
dents are growing more conscious
of their lack of involvement with
Stanford policy and governance.
This event appears to be a step in
the right direction on the part of
students to ensure their voices are
heard.
After years of relative apathy,
gatherings such as today's are cer
tainly welcome.
It is encouraging to see students
mobilizing to be more involved
with policy, rather than wishing to
be unfettered from the responsibil
ities inherent in being a part of a
community.
Furthermore, instead of merely
criticizing, complaining and con
demning the University for real or
imagined slights, today's event also
has the goal of organizing students
— a positive move proving a com
mitment to student participation
and involvement in forming Uni
versity policy, rather than just the
ability to garner cheers at an isolat
ed rally.
President Casper has consistent
ly offered to include students in
policy making, but it is up to the
students to rise to his challenge
and get involved.
And in turn, the administration
should be receptive to student con
cerns and interests.
