## Where are disability rights at Stanford? 
### 
I HAVE BEEN personally involved in
about 150 Disabled Students' Speak
ers Bureaus, and at nearly every one
someone has asked, "How does Stanford
deal with disability?"
Those of you who have attended a
speakers bureau have probably heard me
say that disability is largely a social/cul
tural construction. This just really
means that you, as a cog in this culture,
are responsible for helping to change the
devaluation, discrimination and systemic
injustice that oppress disabled people
every day. The best way to do this prob
ably involves some profound soul
searching and reflection on how you and
this culture view and represent disabili
ty-
But I imagine that this can be quite
time consuming if you do it right, and
therefore I provide a list of questions
you can get involved in answering:
Why are many disabled students sys
tematically excluded from many events
on the second and third floors of our
dorms, classrooms and inaccessible cul
tural centers?
Why were Kimball, Lantana and Cas
tario built inaccessible to disabled stu
dents?
Why, until this year, could disabled
students only draw with one other per
son?
Why are there no classes taught from
a minority-group perspective?

Why do the faculty members who
teach classes concerning disabilities
insist the obstacles disabled people con
front are intrinsic to us as people, rather
than socially imposed?
Why is there no apparent commit
ment to hiring disabled faculty?
Why are there no disabled role models
and mentors among the faculty?
Why has only one "out" disabled stu
dent become a resident assistant in the
last five years?
Why did disability only become part
of the University's definition of multi
culturalism in 1990?
Is it sufficient for the prestigious and
diverse Stanford University to assume
merely a compliance stance on the
Americans with Disabilities Act, or
should we take proactive actions that
ensure the physical, social and cultural
participation of people with disabilities
in our multicultural community?
Why do many disabled people (and
other marginalized students) fear identi
fying with their community? How bad
does the problem need to get before we
cease blaming the individuals and start
taking personal and institutional respon
sibility?
Why do the Disabled Students of
Stanford still lack a community space,
after five years of lobbying?
Why is only 1 percent of Stanford dis
abled while at least 10% of 18-25 year

old Americans are disabled?
I challenge you: what are you and
Stanford going to do to answer these
questions? Are we included in Stanford's
definition of multiculturalism or not?
The disabled community demands an
answer.
