Rice is qualified to be provost, regardless of politics

WE TAKE EXCEPTION TO John
Abromeit's letter in the May 24
issue of The Daily in which Con
doleezza Rice is delineated as "an advo
cate of that improbable synthesis of free
markets, 'family values' and militarism
which has characterized 12 years of
Republican politics and whose devastating
social, economic, and environmental
effects we'll be reckoning with for some
time to come."
While we feel that this is not the prop
er forum to respond to the latter half of
such a misrepresentative statement, we
do believe that any such characterization
of our new provost is grossly inaccurate.
Condoleezza Rice has made a name for
herself that is heard in the lecture halls
and political discussions of every universi
ty across America. Growing up in Birming
ham, Alabama in the 19605, she had the

vision, intelligence and strength to rise
from improbable surroundings, and elevat
ed herself to a critical position on the
White House staff. Rice is now recognized
across the country as one of the leading
experts on Russian affairs. She has proven
herself both as an impeccable stateswom
an and professor.
We are proud to have Professor Rice as
our provost, not because of the color of
her skin, nor because of her gender or
political affiliation, but because of the
exceptional accomplishments and qualifi
cations which she brings to the job.
By stereotyping Rice as a staunch con
servative just because she is a Republican,
Abromeit might as well classify us all in
that way. Let us assure you, we are not
that easy to classify.
The Republican Party consists of peo
ple from all backgrounds and all lifestyles.

Perhaps Abromeit was unaware that one
of the floor leaders at the national conven
tion was a homosexual delegate from San
Francisco. And, most importantly, we are
represented by people throughout the ide
ological spectrum: reactionary, moderate,
liberal and, believe it or not, we recently
met someone who classified herself as a
"radical Republican."
Perhaps, while assiduously researching
President Casper's alleged remarks in the
19605, Abromeit has failed to uncover
what just about every other Stanford stu
dent has witnessed since Casper has taken
office: numerous justifications of the Grey
Interpretation of the Speech Code and a
continued commitment to Affirmative
Action. Hardly the actions of a man who
Abromeit claims "wantfsl us to forget
about the hard-won progressive struggles
of the past 30 years".

Instead of unsubstantiated fearmon
gering, perhaps Abromeit would be better
advised to base his assumptions on con
crete evidence, such as that in the May 21
issue of The Daily, in which Rice said,
"I'm a part of diversity and I'm proud to
be," as she later went on to chide those
who associate diversity with compromised
standards. Quite clearly, Rice's appoint
ment to provost does not portend a return
to the days of institutionalized women, as
Abromeit would have us believe, but
rather the administration's new dedica
tion to diversity and excellence.
