# Postal Service needs to respond to complaints about late mail arrival
## 
### 
I am sorry to revive a tired issued
that has practically become a legend on
the Stanford campus — the inefficiency
of the post office.
I was slightly annoyed when letters
from my parents came three weeks late.
It was more of a hassle when a letter of
recommendation did not arrive until a
week after the due date. In the mean
time I had to hunt down a fax machine
and trouble my former employer to fax
me a copy of the letter. Even worse,
when I had not received my absentee
ballot for the November election a week
and a half before it was due, I was forced
to call the election commission. They
mailed me a new one (this time to my
dorm, not my P.O. Box). The original
ballot arrived in my box three days after
the election.

What finally prompted this letter was
the Official Sample Ballot I received
today for an election that takes place
today. Since this is a special election, I
was unaware of the exact date and didn't
have the chance to call and make sure I
received an absentee ballot. Now, I will
not be able to vote
Stanford Post Office, I challenge you
to finally respond to the numerous com
plaints Stanford students have made over
the years. What do you do with our mail?
