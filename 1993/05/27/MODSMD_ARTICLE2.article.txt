# Administrator nabbed in $75K forgery scam
## Physics assistant faked expense forms, tickets 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Stanford Police arrested a former
Physics Department office assistant Tues
day evening after uncovering a $75,000
scam involving forged University travel-ex
pense forms and plane tickets.
Earceal Dorris Scott, 46, was booked on
felony charges of grand theft and forgery
after allegedly arranging phony trips for
physics graduate students to places such as
the East Coast and England, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Police believe Scott, who had access to
the signatures of graduate students and
professors, was able to successfully forge
travel-expense forms and purchase plane
tickets the students and faculty members
never actually used.
Niemeyer said Scott would return the
tickets to the American Express Travel
Service at Tresidder Union and ask for a re
fund. She also allegedly endorsed expense
checks made out to students and then
cashed them herself.
"Her forgeries weren't really that good,
but were good enough for a lay person" not
to notice, Niemeyer said. "My guess is she
used [the money] to go on trips or for
clothes or furniture."
The plane-ticket refunds and travel-ex

pense checks amounted to $66,000, and
Scott allegedly forged $8,800 in traveller's
checks as well, Niemeyer said. These funds
were deposited into Scott's bank account at
the Stanford Federal Credit Union, he said.
Police believe Scott — who has a previous
criminal record of embezzlement, theft and
forgery — stole as much as $85,000 from
the University during the two-year scam.
Stanford Police Sgt. Del Bandy is still in
vestigating whether Scott illegally used an
other $9,900 in American Express travel
er's checks. Police are still looking for other
possible thefts, Niemeyer added.
"This could be the middle of the ice
berg," he said. "There could be a lot of stuff
under the surface that we haven't uncov
ered yet.
Police first suspected something was
amiss when a $1,200 personal check Scott
wrote to American Express bounced. The
check was written from a closed bank ac
count at the Credit Union used to cover
flight-cancellation fees.
Physics Prof. Emeritus Arthur
Schawlow, for whom had Scott worked as a
secretary for the past few years, expressed
regret about the arrest.
"I'm awfully sorry this happened to her
because I really liked her — she was very
obliging and willing to do anything for us,"
Schawlow said.
