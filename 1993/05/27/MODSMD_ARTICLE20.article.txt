# Religion of victims in Bosnia is not the only reason for persecution
## 
### 
You report in your May 25 issue that
the Bosnian ambassador to the United
Nations, Muhamed Sacirbey, said at a
recent meeting on campus that "the
world would not be as hesitant to inter

vene if there were predominantly Chris
tian rather than Muslim victims." Per
haps this is poor paraphrasing on the
part of the reporter and not a quote from
Sacirbey. I want to be fair and leave open
the possibility that he has been misre
ported because the statement is a factual
error and a moral provocation.
At present in the Sudan, a Muslim
government is waging war on its Chris
tian and animist subjects and the casual
ties are as high or higher than in
Bosnia-Herzogovina to date. The inter
vention of the international community
in the Sudan has been much less vigor
ous than in Bosnia-Herzogovina.
I do not cite the Sudan example to
show that Islam is as callous as Chris
tianity, but to point out that the religion
of the victims and victimizers is only one
variable amongst several, and that the
kind of remark Sacirbey made is igno
rant and self-serving.
The whole meeting in question causes
me concern because it seems to have
been a propaganda exercise. I did not
attend for that reason. The diplomatic

and security issues are complicated, and
one would have valued a balanced con
sideration. We surely have enough indig
nation and horror, what we need now is
clear thinking and resolute action.
I am disappointed to note that Hillel,
whose director I respect greatly, spon
sored such an exercise, since its mem
bers have protested in the past about
"one-sided" meetings on campus at
which Palestinian speakers were not
were not balanced by Zionist advocates. I
sympathize with its motivations for the
meeting as I read of them in the press,
but I wonder if the memory of the Holo
caust might not have pushed them from
morality to moralizing. Might I share
this quote from Joseph Nye's "Nuclear
Ethics," "Moral virtue would consist in
the care, the quality of moral reasoning,
and the procedures that went into weigh
ing such choices, rather than an arbi
trary assignment into one or the other
philosophical tradition."
