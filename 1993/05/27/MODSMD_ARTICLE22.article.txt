## Chyung earns taekwondo black belt in four years 
### Toby Gwak 
You could call Laura Chyung a
fast learner.
When she attended her first
taekwondo class at Stanford as a
white belt, she never dreamed of
competing against the nation's
best for a shot at the U.S. Olympic
team. Yet that is exactly where
she finds herself now, just four
short years later.
Under the instruction of Mas
ter Woo Kon Kim, founder of the
Stanford Taekwondo Club,
Chyung's natural abilities have
developed at a rapid pace. After
recently capturing first place at
the California state tournament,
she will be competing at the
World Taekwondo Federation's
national tournament today
through Saturday in St. Paul,
Minn.
Qualifying for the national
tournament involved a long and
rigorous process — one stage of
which saw Chyung, a 26-year-old
graduate student in Materials
Science and Engineering, win
ning the women's lightweight
black belt division for those aged
17 to 35 at the state champi
onships.
The top four finishers from
this competition were then
selected to move on to the
national level. Eight others were
also added to the pool: the top
four competitors from the colle
giate nationals and the top four
from last year's nationals, who
automatically qualified.
When the dust settles this
weekend, four women will advance
to the Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, Colo. They will
be joined by two wild cards, includ
ing last year's national champion.

These six will fight it out, round
robin style, and the individual with
the best record at the end will
become an Olympic athlete.
Thus Chyung, with only four
years of training under her belt,
has a shot to represent the U.S.
Olympic team in Atlanta in 1996.
Her accomplishments are magni
fied by the fact that initially she
did not even approach taekwondo
as a competitive sport.
"The reason I started taek
wondo was to learn self-defense.
I certainly feel more able to pro
tect myself now than I did before
taking taekwondo," she
explained.
According to Chyung, the self
defense aspect of taekwondo does
not come from learning how to
kick hard or break boards,
although she can do both. It
comes from preparing the mind
for a possible attack.
"Sparring is really helpful,
because it places you in a situa
tion where you must defend your
self," she said. "It prepares you
physically and mentally for an
attack.
"If you spar long enough,
you're going to get kicked in the
head or in the gut, but you get
used to it — in the sense that you
know what it's like. After taking
taekwondo, panic factors a lot less
into that kind of situation."
Besides the self-defense and
exercise benefits gained from
taekwondo, Chyung was also
attracted to the purely fun,
almost aesthetic, elements of the
sport.
"There's something to be said
about the satisfaction that comes
from perfecting skills," she
explained. "Taekwondo is a contin
uous learning process. There are

always challenges on the horizon."
Although she started with
modest expectations, Chyung
soon discovered that she had a
natural talent for the sport. Last
year, she had the opportunity to
train with Dana Hee, who tasted
Olympic gold in 1988. The time
spent with Hee exposed Chyung
to the subtle points of tourna
ment training.
"While training with Dana, my
skills improved rapidly. I learned
some strategy and how to improve
my speed and techniques as well,"
Chyung said. "I must say that
Dana's experience really helped
me learn about what it's like to
compete in tournaments."
The most unusual aspect of
Chyung's success is the fact that
she has achieved it with relatively
little tournament experience. In
fact, including the recent state
championships, she has only com
peted in seven tournaments to
date.
Generally, taekwondo is con
sidered to be such a complex sport
that it cannot be mastered in such
a short time. Physically, tourna
ment sparring requires endur
ance, quickness, balance, swift
reaction time, flexibility and some
strength. In addition, the mental
aspect becomes increasingly
important at higher levels of com
petition.
"Sparring, though it can look
chaotic, demands concentration
and mental focus," Chyung said.
"You need to be calm and relaxed.
If you get frustrated or angry,
you'll be out of control and easy
pickings for an experienced fight
er."
Although she may be tough
and competitive in the ring,
Chyung is quite soft-spoken and

approachable outside of it. One of
the responsibilities of a black belt
is to help the teacher with
instructing taekwondo classes,
and Chyung fulfills this role will
ingly.
"She's a wonderful teacher,
and is always willing to provide a
little extra attention and instruc
tion," said fellow black belt Chris

Wagner.
If Chyung emerges from the
national tournament this week
end with a ticket to Colorado
Springs, she will have accom
plished in four years what most
people spend a lifetime pursuing.
Even if her Olympic dreams are
not realized, however, she will
have come further than she ever

expected to.
"It's a great honor for the
Stanford Taekwondo Club to
have one of its members qualify
for the nationals, with a shot at
the Olympic team," Wagner said.
"It's simply amazing to consider
what she's done . . . and how
quickly she has learned the
sport."

you're going to get kicked in the
head or in the gut, but you get
used to it — in the sense that you
know what it's like. After taking
taekwondo, panic factors a lot less
into that kind of situation."
Besides the self-defense and
exercise benefits gained from
taekwondo, Chyung was also
attracted to the purely fun,
almost aesthetic, elements of the
sport.
"There's something to be said
about the satisfaction that comes
from perfecting skills," she
explained. "Taekwondo is a contin
uous learning process. There are

always challenges on the horizon."
Although she started with
modest expectations, Chyung
soon discovered that she had a
natural talent for the sport. Last
year, she had the opportunity to
train with Dana Hee, who tasted
Olympic gold in 1988. The time
spent with Hee exposed Chyung
to the subtle points of tourna
ment training.
"While training with Dana, my
skills improved rapidly. I learned
some strategy and how to improve
my speed and techniques as well,"
Chyung said. "I must say that
Dana's experience really helped
me learn about what it's like to
compete in tournaments."
The most unusual aspect of
Chyung's success is the fact that
she has achieved it with relatively
little tournament experience. In
fact, including the recent state
championships, she has only com
peted in seven tournaments to
date.
Generally, taekwondo is con
sidered to be such a complex sport
that it cannot be mastered in such
a short time. Physically, tourna
ment sparring requires endur
ance, quickness, balance, swift
reaction time, flexibility and some
strength. In addition, the mental
aspect becomes increasingly
important at higher levels of com
petition.
"Sparring, though it can look
chaotic, demands concentration
and mental focus," Chyung said.
"You need to be calm and relaxed.
If you get frustrated or angry,
you'll be out of control and easy
pickings for an experienced fight
er."
Although she may be tough
and competitive in the ring,
Chyung is quite soft-spoken and

approachable outside of it. One of
the responsibilities of a black belt
is to help the teacher with
instructing taekwondo classes,
and Chyung fulfills this role will
ingly.
"She's a wonderful teacher,
and is always willing to provide a
little extra attention and instruc
tion," said fellow black belt Chris

Wagner.
If Chyung emerges from the
national tournament this week
end with a ticket to Colorado
Springs, she will have accom
plished in four years what most
people spend a lifetime pursuing.
Even if her Olympic dreams are
not realized, however, she will
have come further than she ever

expected to.
"It's a great honor for the
Stanford Taekwondo Club to
have one of its members qualify
for the nationals, with a shot at
the Olympic team," Wagner said.
"It's simply amazing to consider
what she's done . . . and how
quickly she has learned the
sport."

Olympics if she shows well at this weekend's national championship tournament.
