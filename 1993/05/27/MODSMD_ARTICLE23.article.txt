# Thanks for the memories: a tribute to Stanford's greats
## 
### 
Stanford is a great place to be a
sportswriter. Forget about the
NCAA titles and perennial Pacific
10 Conference dominance for a moment.
I'm talking individuals. In my four years
at the Farm, I've had the unique oppor
tunity to watch some of the most talent
ed athletes in the country do their stuff
for the old alma mater. Some had their
brief moment in the spotlight, others qui
etly made their way as a team's unsung
hero.
And some were unforgettable.
Here, then, is a tribute to the names and
faces I will carry with me after my Stanford
days are through. They are not always the
most talented or most recognized, but they
brought life to Stanford sports in a way no
one before them did, and no one after them
will. In one way or another, they are the best
of the best.
• Julie Foudy — Even though the Cardi
nal missed its bid for an NCAA soccer title
this year, Foudy had a lot to do with the
team making it to the championships in the
first place. She regularly dazzled Stanford
fans and opposing teams with precision
footwork, gritty determination and a knack
for finding the open teammate at just the
right time. With any luck, the Olympics will
be in her future.
•Andrew Vlahov — He was Stanford
basketball's premier bruiser in the low post,
and what he couldn't achieve with muscle
he got with intimidation. His play served as
a model for all future Cardinal big men.

• Bev Oden — After establishing herself
as Stanford's undisputed Queen of Kill,
Oden finished her four-time All-American
Stanford volleyball career the way she'd
always wanted to — with a national cham
pionship. Nobody has a more imposing
swing or inviting smile, and Oden was good
at using both to become one of the school's
most admired athletes. She will likely join
the U.S. team in Atlanta in 1996.
• Dave Garnett — Look at Stanford foot
ball's leading tackier for many of its games
over the past two years, and Garnett's name
will come up more than once. His quiet
intensity inspired all of his teammates to
put in the extra effort, and no one could
have made a better captain. If you saw Ron
George coming at the quarterback from one
side, chances are Garnett was coming from
the other. No greater crime was perpetrated
on draft day than the failure to pick up this
talented linebacker.
• Val Whiting — If other players reduced
women's basketball to a science, Whiting
elevated it to an art form. She will finish her
four years on Stanford's women's basket
ball team as its greatest center, and perhaps
its best player of all time. Maples Pavilion
crowds were thrilled by Whiting's post play,
her undeniable moves to the hoop, and her
unswerving will to win. For years, fans will
talk about "the days when Val played here."
• Jair Lynch — Lynch helped turn Stan
ford men's gymnastics up several notches
this year, leading the team to an NCAA title
and appearing in the Olympic games in

Barcelona. People attended Stanford gym
nastics meets in droves this year, and many
of them came to see Lynch work his magic
on the apparati. Nothing but applause for
this man.
•Heather Willens — Stanford tennis'
leading lady took her final bow this year,
and she can count two NCAA Champi
onships and a Rolex Indoors title among her

many accomplishments. More importantly,
she leaves a tradition of excellence for the
six women who will carry Cardinal tennis
into the '90s and beyond. The Force runs
strong in her family...
• Jeffrey Hammonds — When Ham
monds was maintaining a 15-game hitting
streak last year, one regular at Sunken Dia
mond remarked to me, "Best I ever seen
here." Hammonds finished his career at
Stanford with a .380 average and a Stanford
single-season record 48 stolen bases, and is
widely regarded as one of Stanford's best
clutch hitters. He now plays for the Balti

more Orioles and has a promising future in
professional baseball.
•Bonnie Baker — Every morning at
Redwood Shores last year, you could see Ms.
Baker and her partner rowing their scull
smoothly through the waters. Her training,
however, was anything but tranquil, as
Baker established herself as the Stanford
women's crew team's leader and inspira
tion. She was one of the hardest-working
women in all of Stanford athletics, and she
set a standard for hard work that exists in
many on the team today.
• Adam Keefe — What can be said about
Stanford's No. 1 big man of all time? Keefe
made mincemeat of Stanford basketball
opponents inside, in a way that made it all
look easy. Quite simply, he could not be
stopped in the paint, an incredible achieve
ment for any post player. He helped guide
the team to a NIT championship and a 1992
NCAA berth, and players like Bart Lam
mersen and Jim Morgan use Keefe as the
model of what good inside play is.
•Jennifer Azzi — While we're on the
subject of basketball... Azzi was the origi
nal deliverer of showtime in Stanford
women's hoops, and while she's three years
gone, she certainly isn't forgotten. She gar
nered the Naismith Award as the nation's
top player, as well as the Stanford women's
hoops squad's first-ever NCAA title. Azzi
and teammate Sonja Henning were respon
sible for helping to start the Stanford
women's basketball dynasty, and time and
again, they brought Maples Pavilion to its

feet.
• Marcus Lollie — They call him "The
General" for a reason. Lollie took over a
Keefe-less squad this year and helped
mold the Cardinal into a faster, more
aggressive perimeter-shooting team. Even
when the team suffered through loss after
loss, Lollie was there to take responsibili
ty. Though the season itself might be a
memory better off forgotten, Lollie is a
class player who has made his mark on
Cardinal basketball.
• Rhonda Oliver — In her four years at
Stanford, Oliver has been widely regarded
as one of the Cardinal's greatest sprinters,
and is the only Stanford track-and-field ath
lete to compete in four separate events in
the Pac-10 Championships three years run
ning. If her NCAA qualifying time holds up
in the 4 X 400 relay, she will finish her col
legiate career in New Orleans at the NCAA
Championships. There would be no better
way for this remarkable woman to go out.
These are not, by any means, all the best
athletes Stanford has seen over the past
four years — Chris MacMurdo, Molly Good
enbour, Michael Flanagan, Laxmi Poruri,
Carrie Feldman, Ron George and Dion
Cross are just a few names that come to
mind. Nevertheless, their accomplishments
have made watching Stanford sports excit
ing, and my hat's off to them.

Mike McDonough can't be happier about
the Knicks, and can't wait for Da Bulls to
get Da Sweep. Bring on the Suns, baby.
