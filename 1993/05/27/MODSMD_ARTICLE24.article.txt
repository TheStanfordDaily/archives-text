## 
### Kay Hong Staff writer 
Last weekend the Stanford
women's cycling team clinched
the national title in the Team
Time Tria event at the National
Collegirte Cycling Champi
onships, headquartered in
Barlington, Mtiss. Hosted by the
MIT cycling team, the race week
erd featured competition between
16 wo nen'3 ard 19 men's colle
giate teams.
Kicking off the competition on
a 11.47 kilometer road race
course, the Stanford cyclists were
led by Tracy Timms' seventh
place finish. Top-20 Cardinal per
formances also came from Nicole
Calakos Bettina Romer
(13th), Martina Lauchengco
(16th) and newcomer Anne
Blanche Adams (20th).
Timms, Romer, Lauchengco,
Calakos and Adams combined the
next day to clinch the national
title in the team time trial compe
tition, earning the privilege of
wearing stars-and-stripes jerseys
for the next season. Challenging
the 23.48 km course with a quick
time of 32 minutes, 51 seconds,
the Cardinal squad put the icing
on an undefeated time-trial sea
son, finishing more than a minute
ahead of second and third-place
challengers UC-Davis (34:06) and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo (34:37).
The Cardinal men's time-trial
squad also fared well, placing

sixth in a deep field of 19 teams.
"The men had a good ride. . . .
This race was actually the first
time that all five team members
had ridden together," said coach
Art Walker.

.. everybody really
gelled together at the
most important race
of the season.'

"I thought our women's squad
had a real good chance to win
before the race," he continued.
"We had some concerns about the
Davis team — one of their
strongest riders had broken her
collarbone, missed most of the
season and was just returning to
good form.
"But our squad definitely had
its best ride of the year. Earlier
this year it was often a case of
winning the event without having
a great ride, but everybody really
gelled together at the most impor
tant race of the season. When
they finished, they just looked at
each other and said, 'It doesn't
matter if we won — that was per
fect.' "
Later that afternoon, Romer, a
chemistry graduate student, fin
ished a strong third in the criteri
um competition. Held in the

streets of Cambridge and centered
around Harvard Yard, the 0.7-
mile, 43-lap criterium course fea
tured cobblestone crosswalks and
an especially nasty turn onto Mas
sachusetts Avenue.
Though placing behind Univer
sity of New Mexico's Janelle
Parks (winner of the road race
competition) and Davis' Helen
Drumm, Romer's stiffest competi
tion may have been a week-long
illness before the race.
However, Homer recovered suf
ficiently enough to lead all Cardinal
finishers in the event. Other top-20
finishers included time trials cham
pions Calakos (14th), Adams (15th)
and Lauchengco (16th).
Walker was "pleasantly sur
prised" by Cardinal women riders
that weren't expected to place in
the top-20, such as Adams, a
cyclist who began competing less
than three months ago.
Despite all the awards, the
stars-and-stripes jerseys and the
satisfaction of a national champi
onship, Walker wants to improve
the team by increasing the depth
of his women's squad.
"Two years ago when Davis
won the national time trial title, it
renewed a lot of interest in their
program," he said. "Those novice
riders who didn't have a lot of
experience two years ago are the
ones who helped Davis get second
place at Nationals this year.
Hopefully, we can get some new
riders at Stanford."
