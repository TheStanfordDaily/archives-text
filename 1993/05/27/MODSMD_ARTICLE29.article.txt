Short shrift at the Co Ho
If you're short, you may need a license to Hip
Hop at the Co Ho.
Four freshman women — all less than 5 feet 2
inches tall — were kicked out of the Coffee House
Friday evening during "Hip Hop Night" because
they could not prove that they were over 18, even
though they were carrying their Stanford IDs.
While waiting in line to purchase coffee, a Co
Ho employee approached the group and said,
"Girls, there is a 10 o'clock curfew for people
under 18," said Rachel I^evin.
"I thought it was just a really bad pick-up line,"
said Asma Dilwari, another member of the petite
posse. The employee then asked if they had Stan
ford IDs to prove their age, she added.
Levin produced her Stanford ID, and the girls
were then referred to the manager, who asked
them to produce additional identification to con
firm their age. Since none of the women were car
rying a driver's license, they were asked to leave.
Damir Zekhster, the Friday night manager,
insisted he had not discriminated against the
women because of their height. "They came in a
pack and looked young to me, and I questioned
them. If they look young, I have a right to ques
tion age.
"If a 50-year-old man who was under five feet
came in here, I wouldn't ask for ID," Zekhster
continued. "In their case I was wrong, and I hope
they come back."
But the women are still angry about the inci

dent. "We don't drive to the Co Ho, we don't even
have cars at Stanford," said Angela Chu. "We just
came to get coffee. Since when was a Stanford ID
not good enough?"
But Zekhster said many Palo Alto High School
students have recently tried to get into Hip Hop
Night with Stanford IDs. "We could not run the
risk of having minors consume alcohol."
Chu noted that the flyers advertising "Hip Hop
Night" do not say that a Stanford ID is required.
She suggested that next time, the flyers should
request that people bring identification, and also
say, "If you are under five feet please bring your
birth certificate, your passport and any other
form of identification."

The naked truth
Organizers of today's Nudity Day festivities
say participants have little to fear from the police.
According to senior Steve Matthews, police will
only come to the event if an upset individual
makes a complaint against a specific (naked) per
son. Even then, Matthews said, the police will give
the offending sun-worshipper a warning before
any arrests are made.
Barring rain, the clothes are scheduled to come
off today at Lake Lagunita, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Because the event is being held at the lake —
which is on University property — Matthews said
only faculty, staff and students will be allowed to
moon the sun.
