# Fac Sen to debate revised sexual harassment policy
## 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
A newly updated draft of the Universi
ty's sexual harassment policy — including
an added confidentiality clause — will go
before the Faculty Senate this afternoon
for discussion and a possible endorsement.
The latest version of the draft reflects ad
justments made by the policy''s work group in
response to faculty, staff and student com
ments submitted after the draft's official re
lease last month. The proposed policy is await
ing approval from the University Cabinet.
The most significant changes are the ad
dition of a confidentiality section and the
creation of a committee to review the poli
cy one year after its implementation.
The new privacy clause states that,
"Every reasonable effort will be made to
protect the privacy of the complainant, and
the person being charged, in the investiga
tion and resolution process, subject to the
need to conduct a full and impartial inves
tigation, remedy violations, monitor com
pliance, and administer this policy."
The draft that was released for public
comment last month did not have an ex
plicit confidentiality statement.
Several students and staff members
submitted comments to the work group in
the past few weeks expressing concern
about what they perceived as a weak
promise of confidentiality in the policy.

The latest draft also outlines a new dis
tinction between "concerns" — a "question
or problem" regarding sexual harassment
in which "every effort will be made to pro
tect confidentiality and no records will be
kept" — and "charges" — specific claims
against a named individual in which the
complainant "must consent to being iden
tified to the person being charged."
An added section of the adjusted draft calls
for the vice president for faculty and staff ser
vices and the vice provost for student affairs
to "establish a committee that includes facul
ty, staff and students" to evaluate the policy
and make recommendations after the policy
has been in effect for one year.
In addition, a section of the plan dealing
with informal complaints of harassment
has been condensed from a three para
graphs in the first draft to a two-sentence
statement.
Otherwise, the adjusted draft does not
appear to be drastically altered. The work
group did make some organizational
changes, such as moving the definition of
sexual harassment from the policy section
to the implementation section.
At today's meeting, the Faculty Senate
will discuss the policy and vote on a resolu
tion endorsing the draft's principles and
strongly supporting the policy's adoption.
Work group members declined to com
ment on the policy until after the senate
meeting.
