## Black filmmakers: Lost in the 'hood? 
### 
If you ain't never been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
'Cause you wouldn't understand the ghetto
So stay the fuck out of the ghetto
— "Ghetto Bastard," Naughty By Nature
Will the increasing ghettoization of
black film — by filmmakers, critics
and audiences — destroy the
movement?
This week, twin brothers Albert and

Allen Hughes made their
screen-directing debuts with
"Menace II Society," the story

N'Gai Croal

of a teenager trying to survive
the mean streets of Watts, L.A.
Set in the inner city, featuring rappers in
key roles and boasting a hip-hop sound
track, the film is poised for success. It's a
'hood film — like "New Jack City," "Boyz 'N
the Hood" and "Juice," "Menace" trades on
hip-hop culture to pull in an audience.
The decay of the inner city is one of
America's most pressing problems. Unfor
tunately, most filmmakers don't address this
decay—they simply use the 'hood as a back
drop for action-thrillers ("Trespass"), com
edy ("CB4") or crime dramas ("Juice"),
without shedding any new light on the situ
ation.
These films glamorize the very lifestyles
the filmmakers ostensibly preach against.
"Boyz" is Tre's story, yet the film follows
Doughboy as he shoots down the men who
killed his brother. Ice-T's character in "New
Jack City" is supposed to uphold law and
order, yet he racks up a higher body count
than do the criminals.
Ironically, the most honest 'hood movie
to date — Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing"
— bucks this trend. As in each of his six
films, Lee uses a jazz score and professional
ly trained actors, confronting the issues of
racism, economic deprivation and police
brutality head on. His integrity isn't always
rewarded — "Malcolm X" might have made
more money if he'd cast rapper Ice Cube as

Malcolm and hired Doctor Dre to do the
soundtrack.
These films have also garnered an inor
dinate amount of praise from critics.
"New Jack City" boasted a brilliant perfor
mance by Wesley Snipes, but the film was
just a shoot-'em-up flick. John Singleton
was the first black person ever nominated
for Best Director. But his direction of
"Boyz" was unspectacular, and the screen
play bore the simple structure of a recent

film-school grad — rapper
Eazy-E called it "an After
school Special with cussin'."

"Menace II Society" is the
latest recipient of this critical outpouring.
Siskel & Ebert gave it "Two thumbs up, way
up." Entertainment Weekly called it "bril
liant ... a full-scale vision of the madness
that is tearing up the black inner city."
Sounds plausible — but the directors are
only 21 years old. What's going on here?
Films by black directors, including such
stinkers as "Straight Out Of Brooklyn" and
"Just Another Girl On the IRT," prompt crit
ics and audiences to check their critical fac
ulties at the door. They're so busy praising
the "realism" — a requisite for any ethnic
filmmaker — that shoddy direction, acting,
writing or direction go unnoticed.
These glowing reviews are essentially
backhanded compliments — the critics have
clearly lowered their standards. Black film
makers have little reason to set their sights
higher when everyone's frantically applaud
ing their work.
Filmmakers, critics and audiences all
contribute to the ghettoization of black cin
ema. Directors churn them out, critics rave
about them and we pack the theaters to see
them, so directors make more of them —
saying less and less about the same tired sub
ject.
It's high time to break the cycle. And if
these filmmakers don't have anything new to
say about the ghetto, they too should stay the
fuck out. ■
