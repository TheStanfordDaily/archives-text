## The
						movie is never as good as the book 
### 
If a picture's worth a thousand words, then
120 minutes at 24 frames a second should
be able to pack the punch of a whole li
brary of bestsellers.
In practice, though, this formula never
seems to work out. Seriously. When's the
last time you heard anybody say, "Hey, I saw
that movie last night — it was much better
than the book."
It just doesn't happen. Well, maybe it
happens occasionally. One

example that jumps to mind
is "Blade Runner," which
completely transcends the
boundaries of the somewhat

Ted Quinn

pulpy Philip K. Dick novella it was taken
from, "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep?" This is a rare exception, though. In
fact, the notion that a film adaptation
never lives up to the book that inspired it is
such a truism in our culture that we will
put off seeing even a lavishly praised film
until we've read the book, so as not to di
minish our reading experience.
Of course, it's not a matter of one art
form being inherently superior to the
other. The process of translating a story
from paper to celluloid is problematic at
best. Unless directors make excessive use
of narrators — A la David Lynch's multi
million dollar catastrophe, "Dune" — the
inability to get inside the heads of the
characters, or step outside the story for
commentary, forces them to squeeze every
ounce of meaning from the dialogue and
find creative ways to editorialize the ac
tion.
Also, some authors lend themselves to
movie adaptation more than others. The
sparse and visually-oriented style of Stein
beck comes across beautifully on film, as ev
idenced most recently by Gary Sinise's
heartfelt rendering of the classic "Of Mice
and Men."
On the other hand, one can hardly imag
ine trying to capture the self-conscious and
narratively chaotic work of an author like

Milan Kundera in this way, although Philip
Kaufman made a valiant effort with "The
Unbearable Lightness of Being."
It's not simply a problem of translation,
though. When people say, "The book was
better," and everyone nods sagely in agree
ment, there's always an unspoken acknowl
edgment that the entire experience of read
ing a book is more satisfying than watching
a screen.

Reading is simply a bigger
experience: longer, slower
and more detailed than sit
ting in a theater and pop
ping Milk Duds for a cou

pie of hours. But that's only part of it.
The real difference has to do with the
way the two art forms speak to our own life
experiences. When we're sitting on the sofa
reading a book, it's up to us to find the lo
cation, cast all of the roles and direct the
reading of every line in the scene. We're di
rectors, producers and actors all at once,
creating a film in our heads. The story we
end up with is personally tailored to our
own lives and the meaning we're searching
for.
No matter how well professional actors
bring the characters to life, they just can't
hold a candle to our personalized version
— where our father plays the Dad, the kid
who used to beat us up in junior high is the
villain and that beautiful woman in our
chemistry lecture stars as the femme fa
tale.
This aspect of literature will never allow
the story of words to be replaced by what
ever spectacular media experience the ex
perts come up with next. When it comes to
telling a story that really hits home, there
just isn't much that can rival our own imag
ination.
So instead of renting "The Princess
Bride" for the umpteenth time this week
end, stop by Kepler's and grab the book. It's
by William Goldman.
Don't forget the Milk Duds. ■
