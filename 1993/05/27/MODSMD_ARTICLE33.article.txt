# 10,000 MANIACS
## making sense of an insane world through their music 
### JANAR STEWART 
It's hard to believe the mainstream alterna
tive band 10,000 Maniacs began with two
kids beating out the Rolling Stones' "Sym
pathy for the Devil" on their homeroom
desks.
At least that's the story bassist Steve
Gustafson tells from a static-filled phone in
Memphis, Tenn., explaining how he and key
boardist Dennis Drew first met: "We both
knew the drum parts [to the song], and that's
how we got together."
Describing Drew as a "jock" and himself
as the "wimpy" kid, Gustafson says the two of
them attended the same high school — after
which, they went on to start up a radio sta
tion at their community college in
Jamestown, New York.
Their playlist, which included now-rock
legends Neil Young and the Grateful Dead,
attracted the attention of guitarist Rob Buck,
who called in from a nearby factory where he
worked. After an invitation from Buck, the
twosome decided to join Buck's band, a move
that encouraged Gustafson to pick up the
bass on the spot: "I didn't know how to play
it, but I said, 'it can't be that hard, it only has
four strings.'"
That same nonchalance first surfaced
back when Gustafson developed an interest
in a wide array of innovative bands, includ
ing Gang of Four, Elvis Costello and The
Clash. He says these artists convinced him
that "you do not have to be a virtuoso to play
an instrument."
In fact, the beauty of 10,000 Maniacs'
music stems from the combination of simple
piano runs, drum patterns and guitar riffs —
with the unusual accompaniment of accor
dions, bassoons and the electric sitar.
Yet, while their music remains simple,
10,000 Maniacs' lyrics always deal with com
plex emotions and subject matter. Their
newest album, however, carries a less-dog
matic tone, wandering more often into the
realm of the inner self. "I'm Not the Man," a
song about a person wrongly convicted of a
crime that warrants death, is one of the few
tracks on "Our Time in Eden" that contains
social commentary.
The newer cuts depart significantly from
lead singer and songwriter Natalie Mer
chant's scathing chastisement of coloniza
tion in "Hateful Hate" (off the album "Blind
Man's Zoo"), adamant disapproval of child
abuse in "What's the Matter Here?" ("In Our
Tribe") and deep distrust of the U.S. govern
ment's explanation of Vietnam war casualties
in"The Big Parade" ("Blind Man's Zoo").
In regard to Merchant's tendency to
preach, Gustafson agrees that her songs on
"Our Time in Eden" reflect a definite turn in
ward: "She's writing songs more about her-

self than the rest of the world."
Fortunately, Merchant still churns out
powerful lyrics, despite her change of topics
and direction. In "Jezebel," she sings softly,
yet conveys a relentless verbal self-punish
ment — "I feel like the thief who is raiding
your home/ entering and breaking and tak
ing in every room" — before bursting into a
full-throated cry — "How I wish that we
never had tried to be man and his wife/ to
weave our lives into a blindfold over both our
eyes."
Merchant's songwriting ability becomes
even more impressive when one realizes she
writes her lyrics after the music already has
been created, a difficult task for a songwriter

looking to match the message with the mood
of the music.
And to confuse things further, the Mani
acs never decide how a piece will sound be
forehand. According to Gustafson, the band
experiments quite a bit. Explaining one of
10,000 Maniacs techniques, he says, "We had
flash cards with major and minor keys on
them. We'd pick one and start jamming."
The group then listened to "hours and
hours of jams" before choosing material that
worked, Gustafson adds. Collaboration like
this succeeds because of a maturity that
comes from playing together for more than
12 years, he says.
"We've all become good friends," he says.

So good that each of them feels they have 10
parents, and are almost a part of other band
members' families, Gustafson continues.
In addition to maintaining strong family
ties, group members display incredible ma
turity when it comes to music. The band
doesn't possess the self-righteous attitude
that many younger bands do.
Their maturity also emerges in the form of
social responsibility, which radiates from
10,000 Maniacs' songs. Merchant un
abashedly rags on TV addicts and the media
alike in the deceivingly upbeat "Candy
Everybody Wants."
"If lust and hate is the candy/ if blood and
love taste so sweet/ then we give 'em what
they want/ So their eyes are growing hazy 'cos
they wanna turn it on/ so their minds are soft
and lazy/ Well ... who do you want to
blame?"
"Natalie has a real distaste for television,"
Gustafson says, laughing. "There's a lot of trash
out there. I only turn on the TV for 'Seinfield'
and the news."
But, as cheesy as it sounds, the members of
10,000 Maniacs do practice what they
preach. While on tour, the group allows two
guys from Greenpeace to follow them from
city to city, setting up their booths at each
concert and addressing environmental issues
particular to that town, Gustafson says.
And, he adds, "We never take any money
for our own pockets when we play in
Jamestown."
Although some listeners and critics may
pigeon-hole 10,000 Maniacs as a message
band, Gustafson doesn't seem to mind:
"My whole vision of the role this band
plays for me has been a job, an education. We
don't think too much about other [people's
opinions]. We think about ourselves wherev
er critics put us."
But he is quick to add, "We have to be
aware of what we're doing and what were say
ing, because people are listening. Certain
musicians, I hung on their every word (when
I was younger)."
With such a sense of responsibility— es
pecially since he sees the media as a manipu
lative force — Gustafson regrets that 10,000
Maniacs haven't been more involved in the
video-making process. "We have a lot less
control over the videos. We're always doing
videos when we don't have time."
Fortunately, he doesn't lose sleep over it:
"It took us 12 years to get recording right.
We're not in a hurry." ■

10,000 Maniacs will appear at the Greek The
atre in Berkeley on Saturday. Tickets can be

worked, Gustafson adds. Collaboration like
this succeeds because of a maturity that
comes from playing together for more than
12 years, he says.
"We've all become good friends," he says.

So good that each of them feels they have 10
parents, and are almost a part of other band
members' families, Gustafson continues.
In addition to maintaining strong family
ties, group members display incredible ma
turity when it comes to music. The band
doesn't possess the self-righteous attitude
that many younger bands do.
Their maturity also emerges in the form of
social responsibility, which radiates from
10,000 Maniacs' songs. Merchant un
abashedly rags on TV addicts and the media
alike in the deceivingly upbeat "Candy
Everybody Wants."
"If lust and hate is the candy/ if blood and
love taste so sweet/ then we give 'em what
they want/ So their eyes are growing hazy 'cos
they wanna turn it on/ so their minds are soft
and lazy/ Well ... who do you want to
blame?"
"Natalie has a real distaste for television,"
Gustafson says, laughing. "There's a lot of trash
out there. I only turn on the TV for 'Seinfield'
and the news."
But, as cheesy as it sounds, the members of
10,000 Maniacs do practice what they
preach. While on tour, the group allows two
guys from Greenpeace to follow them from
city to city, setting up their booths at each
concert and addressing environmental issues
particular to that town, Gustafson says.
And, he adds, "We never take any money
for our own pockets when we play in
Jamestown."
Although some listeners and critics may
pigeon-hole 10,000 Maniacs as a message
band, Gustafson doesn't seem to mind:
"My whole vision of the role this band
plays for me has been a job, an education. We
don't think too much about other [people's
opinions]. We think about ourselves wherev
er critics put us."
But he is quick to add, "We have to be
aware of what we're doing and what were say
ing, because people are listening. Certain
musicians, I hung on their every word (when
I was younger)."
With such a sense of responsibility— es
pecially since he sees the media as a manipu
lative force — Gustafson regrets that 10,000
Maniacs haven't been more involved in the
video-making process. "We have a lot less
control over the videos. We're always doing
videos when we don't have time."
Fortunately, he doesn't lose sleep over it:
"It took us 12 years to get recording right.
We're not in a hurry." ■

atre in Berkeley on Saturday. Tickets can be

Amid a sea of Nirvana-sound alikes, 10,000 Maniacs manage to create good music with
out compromising lyrical quality.
It's hard to believe the mainstream alterna
tive band 10,000 Maniacs began with two
kids beating out the Rolling Stones' "Sym
pathy for the Devil" on their homeroom
desks.
At least that's the story bassist Steve
Gustafson tells from a static-filled phone in
Memphis, Tenn., explaining how he and key
boardist Dennis Drew first met: "We both
knew the drum parts [to the song], and that's
how we got together."
Describing Drew as a "jock" and himself
as the "wimpy" kid, Gustafson says the two of
them attended the same high school — after
which, they went on to start up a radio sta
tion at their community college in
Jamestown, New York.
Their playlist, which included now-rock
legends Neil Young and the Grateful Dead,
attracted the attention of guitarist Rob Buck,
who called in from a nearby factory where he
worked. After an invitation from Buck, the
twosome decided to join Buck's band, a move
that encouraged Gustafson to pick up the
bass on the spot: "I didn't know how to play
it, but I said, 'it can't be that hard, it only has
four strings.'"
That same nonchalance first surfaced
back when Gustafson developed an interest
in a wide array of innovative bands, includ
ing Gang of Four, Elvis Costello and The
Clash. He says these artists convinced him
that "you do not have to be a virtuoso to play
an instrument."
In fact, the beauty of 10,000 Maniacs'
music stems from the combination of simple
piano runs, drum patterns and guitar riffs —
with the unusual accompaniment of accor
dions, bassoons and the electric sitar.
Yet, while their music remains simple,
10,000 Maniacs' lyrics always deal with com
plex emotions and subject matter. Their
newest album, however, carries a less-dog
matic tone, wandering more often into the
realm of the inner self. "I'm Not the Man," a
song about a person wrongly convicted of a
crime that warrants death, is one of the few
tracks on "Our Time in Eden" that contains
social commentary.
The newer cuts depart significantly from
lead singer and songwriter Natalie Mer
chant's scathing chastisement of coloniza
tion in "Hateful Hate" (off the album "Blind
Man's Zoo"), adamant disapproval of child
abuse in "What's the Matter Here?" ("In Our
Tribe") and deep distrust of the U.S. govern
ment's explanation of Vietnam war casualties
in"The Big Parade" ("Blind Man's Zoo").
In regard to Merchant's tendency to
preach, Gustafson agrees that her songs on
"Our Time in Eden" reflect a definite turn in
ward: "She's writing songs more about her-

self than the rest of the world."
Fortunately, Merchant still churns out
powerful lyrics, despite her change of topics
and direction. In "Jezebel," she sings softly,
yet conveys a relentless verbal self-punish
ment — "I feel like the thief who is raiding
your home/ entering and breaking and tak
ing in every room" — before bursting into a
full-throated cry — "How I wish that we
never had tried to be man and his wife/ to
weave our lives into a blindfold over both our
eyes."
Merchant's songwriting ability becomes
even more impressive when one realizes she
writes her lyrics after the music already has
been created, a difficult task for a songwriter

looking to match the message with the mood
of the music.
And to confuse things further, the Mani
acs never decide how a piece will sound be
forehand. According to Gustafson, the band
experiments quite a bit. Explaining one of
10,000 Maniacs techniques, he says, "We had
flash cards with major and minor keys on
them. We'd pick one and start jamming."
The group then listened to "hours and
hours of jams" before choosing material that
worked, Gustafson adds. Collaboration like
this succeeds because of a maturity that
comes from playing together for more than
12 years, he says.
