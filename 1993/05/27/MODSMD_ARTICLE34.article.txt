have gazed in awe at the
Ikllooming, palatial, brick-colored build-
Mfrr ing on Lomita, wondering what sort of
P mysteries it houses.
The edifice's ornate architecture and
gothic presence render it an anomaly in
Stanford's world of tawny stucco and red tile
roofs. Fitting to its elusive personae, the
main entrance faces away from the center of
the University, preceded by a grassy court
yard that punctuates the grandeur of its
arches, balconies and scrollwork.
The building itself is a relic of Stanford
history — originally built at the turn of the
century to Jane Stanford's specifications,
modeled after a Spanish palace — serving as
the University president's home in pre-
Hoover House days.
But today, the Knoll houses the Center
for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA) — regulars call it
"karma" — bringing together musicians,
composers, computer programmers, engi
neers, psychologists and acousticians who
break through the conventional boundaries
of music through its creation and synthesis
with computers.
While this large, angular, "C-shaped
mansion known as The Knoll exudes an anti
quated feel, past meets future within its walls.
Inside, computers, synthesizers, mixers and
equipment-filled recording studios reside in a
myriad of rooms connected by maze-like
hallways, spiral staircases and even an old
style elevator with a sliding metal gate.
While many of the futuristic sounds that
are engineered at CCRMA may seem more
like sound effects for a hallucinogenic sci
ence-fiction movie than what most hear on
the radio, other forms of computer-generat
ed music are übiquitous in Stanford stu
dents' lives.
Computer music has shaped everything
from pop music's use of synthesizers and
sampling to the very definitions and genera

tion of "intellectual" — also known as clas
sical — and avant-garde music
Pop music in the computer era
It's hard to imagine that New Order and
Public Enemy would have any connection
with Stanford's enigmatic research center.
However, almost all modern musicians
— from techno to rap artists — use com
puters in the recording process, and many
bands already sample non-instrumental
sounds a la Depeche Mode, according to
junior Chris Otto, a music, science and tech
nology major who is one of a few under
graduates involved with the center.
Otto himself has incorporated computers
in pop music beyond the familiar, while
"keyboarding and programming" in a local
band whose sound he describes as "techno
industrial, the Nine-Inch-Nails genre" —
quite a departure from Stanford's typical
aspiring rock stars, who would cringe at the
idea of using computers to "tamper" with
their Zeppelin-esque guitar riffs or impas
sioned Hendrix-inspired vocals.
As he sits in one of CCRMA's studios,
Otto explains that, although his music starts
out with the traditional guitar, keyboards
and voice, the final result is largely produced
by the digital synthesizers and computers
that surround him.
In fact, it seems computers call so much
attention to their own presence in the music
that the instrumental art becomes secondary
to experimentation. Otto's music, which
gives techno a grunge feel with its intense
distortion, exemplifies this.
"Most all of what we actually play — like
hitting the keys on the keyboard — you'll
never hear that," Otto says. "It's all been
edited into the computer — sampled,
manipulated and played back."
Otto acknowledges that this near-obliter
ation of an instrumental musician's tradi
tional skills and expression produces some

trade-offs. "I played piano for 11 years, but
now that I've been able to use computers to
edit everything, my actual playing has
become dreadful," he says, shrugging and
smiling wryly.
As Otto matter-of-factly describes the
incorporation of "random" non-musical
samples into his music, images flash to mind
of mad-scientist musicians tinkering within
the building's ominous walls — dropping
marbles, clicking keys and playing lines from
movies into computers, all in a frenzied
search to push the envelope of pop music.
New sounds vs. artistic expression?
As exuberant as computer-music affi
cionados are when exploring the outermost
limits of traditional music, their quest pre
sents conflicts in defining music itself.
Reflected in mainstream pop's backlash
against overly synthesized sounds, the engi
neered and manipulated nature of computer
music has some purists up in arms.
In a time when everyone from Arrested
Development to Midnight Oil are "unplug
ging" their amps to perform acoustical ren
ditions, either for albums or in concert, the
tension between the two currents has
become increasingly apparent.
Understandably, it is difficult to imagine
Eric Clapton shedding tears for his departed
son as he programs "Tears In Heaven" into a
NeXT, but supporters of computer music
claim that the intent is to supplement what
already exists, not to undermine it.
"If our goal was to produce the exact
same sound as say, a violin, then we might
as well just stick with the actual instrument,
because the violin will always sound better,"
says doctoral student R.J. Fleck, who is pur
suing a degree in computer-based music

theory and acoustics.
However, Fleck adds, "There is so much
computers can do that you can't do any
other way," enthusiastically describing musi
cal hackers' passion for innovating beyond
the norm, always striving for new sounds
and modes of creation.
Redefining music performance
Marco Trevisani, a visiting professor from
Rome, sits in one of the Knoll's stark, expan
sive classrooms, diligently typing away at a

says, punching in a coded sequence of num
bers and symbols into the computer that
will generate sounds. Eventually, these tones
will fit in a score for a performance piece
Trevisani describes as "a small opera."
While watching him plug away, one defi
nitely gets the sense that little is sacred to the
far-reaching arms of technology, as images
of Mozart programming "The Marriage of
Figaro" via machine language flash to mind.
"Basically, there's two ways to generate
sounds from the computer," Trevisani
explains, motioning toward the screen. "You
can program sinusoids (sine waves at specif
ic frequencies) that alternate together, or
take sounds that have been created before —
sampling."
The music itself, which generally falls
into the avant-garde category, also is reshap
ing the way people define what is music.
Space-age, often distorted or unrecognizable
sounds have brought the "intellectual"
realm of music many evolutionary cycles
beyond Bach and Beethoven.
Computer musicians claim the "strange
ness" of the music is all a matter of acceptance
— once people acclimate themselves to the
new range of sounds that computers have cre
ated, these eventually will become part of the
norm, rather than the exception, in music.
In the 20th century, as "intellectual"
music has been testing the boundaries of the
musical — from the dissonant harmonics of
Copland and Stravinsky to John Cage's "4'
33" " (a performance piece in which a
"pianist" sits at a piano, but does not play,
for four minutes, 33 seconds of silence) —
these computer composers' speculations
may not be far off.
Perhaps reflective of a transition stage in
music, the relatively young field of com
puter music is still trying to bridge the
schism between computers and traditional
instruments.
Trevisani points out one of the key differ
ences between traditional instruments and

computers, the question of "real time." To
create a single sound, a complex set of com
mands and codes have to be programmed
into the computer — multiply that by the
number of tones in a full-length composi
tion, and the process becomes extremely
time-consuming.
And even the gap between the premedi
tated, carefully engineered computer sounds
and the spontaneous, "live" quality of tradi
tional instruments seems potentially irrecon
cilable, especially regarding the realm of per
formance. "The idea of giving a live concert
is a little strange sometimes," Otto admits.
New advancements in computer music

also have created a whole new realm of per
formance music, based on motion as well as
sound. Several years ago, CCRMA Prof. Max
Mathews — who pioneered the concept of
computer music while working for Bell
Laboratories in the late 19505— invented the
radio batons, which exemplify this concept.
Two drumstick-like batons with foam
balls at the end, hooked up to a high-pow
ered Macintosh in another one of CCRMA's
many rooms, are tapped and stroked, work
ing like a keyboard to produce computer
generated sounds.
The musician who holds the batons can
create effects with his or her gestures — for
example, increasing the intensity of a tone
with a stronger motion, says Mathews,

known as the father of computer music.
Also, the wider range of movement available
to the musician creates more possibilities in
visual performance.
Employing similar concepts, sensors that
control music, based on muscle and brain
waves, can be attached to a person's arms
and legs — known as Biomuse — adding an
entirely new dimension to dance perfor
mances.
Even with MTV already killing the radio
star, the possibility of Madonna voguing or
Michael Jackson thrusting his pelvis to
"play" a guitar solo may still seem a bit over
whelming, but closer to the present than

most imagine.
In fact, Trevisani and Fleck both arc
working on multi-media performance
pieces that will debut at a computer-music
concert next October. According to Fleck,
these performances will integrate dance,
drama and music, utilizing the concepts of
motion-created music, as well as merging
"real time" — live performances — with
programmed sounds.
Of course, one of the drawbacks of inte
grating music and motion is that the most
graceful movements for the dancers do not
necessarily create the desired musical effects,
Mathews says. In other words, Michael
Jackson may have to thrust his elbow instead
of his pelvis to hit that perfect beat.

Artist or technician?
One of the consequences of using com
puters in music is the blurring of the dis
tinctions between the creative process and
more technical, research-oriented program
ming issues.
Reflective of this crisis, the white boards in
the classrooms of CCRMA, filled with the
mad scribblings of calculus equations, seem a
far cry from emotion felt from Whitney
Houston's rendition of "One Moment in
Time." A musician programming long
sequences of numbers and codes in search of
engineering new sounds can lose sight of the
big picture — the overall composition as well
as the psychological effect, Trevisani says.
"When you are too technical and you
become obsessed with the perfection of
sound, you can forget you are a musician,"
he explains. "It's a big risk to take" when
working with computers.
Although this tug-of-war between tech
nology and art can create conflicts, it also
can have positive side effects, encouraging
scientists to explore their more artistic sides,
and vice versa.
To Fleck, the Knoll building itself reflects
the innovative risk-taking CCRMA engages
in as it straddles the gulf between expressing
the soul of the musician and engineering
sinusoids. "I like to think of the building as a
symbol, an outlet where science and engi
neering can be directly applied to the artis
tic,"he says.
And even if the new tensions that have
accompanied computer music are never
resolved, they create unique territory for
exploration, as does the incongruous match
of the antiquated palace on Lomita with the
cutting-edge technology it houses. ■
