have gazed in awe at the
Ikllooming, palatial, brick-colored build-
Mfrr ing on Lomita, wondering what sort of
P mysteries it houses.
The edifice's ornate architecture and
gothic presence render it an anomaly in
Stanford's world of tawny stucco and red tile
roofs. Fitting to its elusive personae, the
main entrance faces away from the center of
the University, preceded by a grassy court
yard that punctuates the grandeur of its
arches, balconies and scrollwork.
The building itself is a relic of Stanford
history — originally built at the turn of the
century to Jane Stanford's specifications,
modeled after a Spanish palace — serving as
the University president's home in pre-
Hoover House days.
But today, the Knoll houses the Center
for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA) — regulars call it
"karma" — bringing together musicians,
composers, computer programmers, engi
neers, psychologists and acousticians who
break through the conventional boundaries
of music through its creation and synthesis
with computers.
While this large, angular, "C-shaped
mansion known as The Knoll exudes an anti
quated feel, past meets future within its walls.
Inside, computers, synthesizers, mixers and
equipment-filled recording studios reside in a
myriad of rooms connected by maze-like
hallways, spiral staircases and even an old
style elevator with a sliding metal gate.
While many of the futuristic sounds that
are engineered at CCRMA may seem more
like sound effects for a hallucinogenic sci
ence-fiction movie than what most hear on
the radio, other forms of computer-generat
ed music are übiquitous in Stanford stu
dents' lives.
Computer music has shaped everything
from pop music's use of synthesizers and
sampling to the very definitions and genera

tion of "intellectual" — also known as clas
sical — and avant-garde music
Pop music in the computer era
It's hard to imagine that New Order and
Public Enemy would have any connection
with Stanford's enigmatic research center.
However, almost all modern musicians
— from techno to rap artists — use com
puters in the recording process, and many
bands already sample non-instrumental
sounds a la Depeche Mode, according to
junior Chris Otto, a music, science and tech
nology major who is one of a few under
graduates involved with the center.
Otto himself has incorporated computers
in pop music beyond the familiar, while
"keyboarding and programming" in a local
band whose sound he describes as "techno
industrial, the Nine-Inch-Nails genre" —
quite a departure from Stanford's typical
aspiring rock stars, who would cringe at the
idea of using computers to "tamper" with
their Zeppelin-esque guitar riffs or impas
sioned Hendrix-inspired vocals.
As he sits in one of CCRMA's studios,
Otto explains that, although his music starts
out with the traditional guitar, keyboards
and voice, the final result is largely produced
by the digital synthesizers and computers
that surround him.
In fact, it seems computers call so much
attention to their own presence in the music
that the instrumental art becomes secondary
to experimentation. Otto's music, which
gives techno a grunge feel with its intense
distortion, exemplifies this.
"Most all of what we actually play — like
hitting the keys on the keyboard — you'll
never hear that," Otto says. "It's all been
edited into the computer — sampled,
manipulated and played back."
Otto acknowledges that this near-obliter
ation of an instrumental musician's tradi
tional skills and expression produces some

trade-offs. "I played piano for 11 years, but
now that I've been able to use computers to
edit everything, my actual playing has
become dreadful," he says, shrugging and
smiling wryly.
As Otto matter-of-factly describes the
incorporation of "random" non-musical
samples into his music, images flash to mind
of mad-scientist musicians tinkering within
the building's ominous walls — dropping
marbles, clicking keys and playing lines from
movies into computers, all in a frenzied
search to push the envelope of pop music.
New sounds vs. artistic expression?
As exuberant as computer-music affi
cionados are when exploring the outermost
limits of traditional music, their quest pre
sents conflicts in defining music itself.
Reflected in mainstream pop's backlash
against overly synthesized sounds, the engi
neered and manipulated nature of computer
music has some purists up in arms.
In a time when everyone from Arrested
Development to Midnight Oil are "unplug
ging" their amps to perform acoustical ren
ditions, either for albums or in concert, the
tension between the two currents has
become increasingly apparent.
Understandably, it is difficult to imagine
Eric Clapton shedding tears for his departed
son as he programs "Tears In Heaven" into a
NeXT, but supporters of computer music
claim that the intent is to supplement what
already exists, not to undermine it.
"If our goal was to produce the exact
same sound as say, a violin, then we might
as well just stick with the actual instrument,
because the violin will always sound better,"
says doctoral student R.J. Fleck, who is pur
suing a degree in computer-based music

theory and acoustics.
However, Fleck adds, "There is so much
computers can do that you can't do any
other way," enthusiastically describing musi
cal hackers' passion for innovating beyond
the norm, always striving for new sounds
and modes of creation.
