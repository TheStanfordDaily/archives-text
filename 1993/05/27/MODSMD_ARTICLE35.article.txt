Even if you like to
watch, Sharon &
Billy ain't all that

Sliver

A mannequin-like young woman drops
limply through the air, after being pushed off
a 20th-story balcony by a mysterious killer.
Like its opening, "Sliver" — hyped as the
erotic thriller of the summer — falls flat on
its face, and doesn't even do so spectacularly.
Newly divorced 35 year-old Carly Norris
(Sharon Stone), a dumb broad who leaves us
longing for the relative wit of "Basic In
stinct" 's Catherine Tramell, moves into a
"sliver" — a tall, narrow Manhattan apart
ment building.
There, she meets two new neighbors:
young, sexy Zeke Hawkins (William Bald
win) and older, slimy Jack Landsford (Tom
Berenger). After two or three days of deliber
ation, she jumps into the sack with Zeke and
gives Jack the big dis.
Meanwhile, someone (Is it Jack? Is it
Zeke? Is it behind door No. 3?) watches the
intimate lives of the apartment's residents
through an intricate system of hidden cam
eras and video screens as the unfortunate in
habitants mysteriously drop off like flies.
Director Phillip Noyce attempts to ex
plore the dark side of voyeuristic tendencies,
while unfolding a "Basic Instinct"-wannabe
murder-thriller plot. Key word — attempts.
Sure, the whole video camera/voyeurism
idea is somewhat interesting—for about the
first 15 minutes. Unfortunately, we're so
mercilessly bombarded with the secret
"thrills" of being a peeping Tom that they
quickly lose their appeal.
And what we as voyeurs see is nothing to
get off on. The much-hyped sex scenes do
push the barriers — of how boring sex can
be. They not only lack sexiness, but also their
choppiness screams out, "I was cut for an 'R'
rating!"
Baldwin's famed frontal-nudity scene is
among the many that were left on the cut
ting-room floor to avoid the dreaded NC-17.
Sloppy editing makes the trims all too obvi

ous as viewers are treated to the übiquitous
"butt shot" as Zeke gets out of bed. Howev
er, the lack of male nudity is made up for by
generous displays of female skin.
More disturbing than the exposural in
equity is the way the film presents Carly in
the sex scenes. In one tryst, a naked Zeke
jumps out of nowhere, pounces on Carly
and pins her against a pole — a scene too
reminiscent of rape.
The film's overall sloppiness reflects its
much-publicized production problems.
Zeke's dildo-like volcano sculpture remains
a recurring motif in the film — even though
a final scenc that involved the main charac
ters flying into a volcano was cut after being
panned at test screenings.
The new ending, meant as a plot twist ex
traordinaire, leaves us laughing — the at
tempt to salvage this doomed movie only
makes the failure more obvious. The film
makers should have taken a cue from the
woman on the balcony and gone for the
quick-and-painless route.

No matter bad or
worse, the 'hood
comes first in L.A.

Menace II Society

When making a film about a jaded anti
hero at odds with his violent world, do your
self a favor: keep the gentleman and his story
out of the 'hood.
Why? A few positive reviews and compar
isons to Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets" or
Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange,"
can't insure that a cast of black characters'

subnormal regard for life — closer to fact
than fiction — won't upset the delicate
palates of mainstream movie-going audi
ences.
Then again, nothing about the directorial
debut of twin brothers Albert and Allen
Hughes, "Menace II Society," suggests any
thing as grand as a sumptuous, gourmet
meal. It's strictly fast food, like Jack in the
Box — the kind that turns the stomach.
Eighteen-year-old Caine Lawson (Tyrin
Turner) just finished high school and anx
iously awaits the beginning of summer, even
though his 'hood and life haven't noticeably
changed. His boys — O-Dog (Larenz Tate),
Sharif (Vonte Sweet), A-Wax (Compton's
Most Wanted's MC Eiht) and Stacy (Ryan
Williams) — still have his back. He still
hasn't stopped helping Ronnie (Jada Pin
kett), the young mother whose boyfriend's
on the lock-down. And slingin' 'caine is still
more profitable than a legitimate job.
Caine munches his barely edible piece of
the American pie, served fresh from the
ovens of Watts — L.A.'s survival kitchen —
until a trip to a liquor store sparks an explo
sive orgy of violence. While our hero never
condones the the powder keg's lighting, his
proximity to the events and their instigators
force him to participate.
"Menace II Society" tries with all its
might to be an unflinching presentation of
both the highs and lows of a young black
male's last summer in the 'hood. And on a
gut level the film works surprisingly well.
But that feeling can't convince us to take the
leap of faith that its slip-shod screenplay and
occasionally dull acting call.
Ironically, the concept behind Tyger
Williams' screenplay shows promise. Writ
ten as a series of flashbacks, strung together
by Caine's narration, the film provides as
many reasons to despise Caine as to sympa
thize with him. Williams gives plenty of both

— at the expense of the subtlety and
poignancy needed to take us to a higher level
of consciousness.
Ultimately, what makes the film worth
while is the directors' shooting style, repleie
with handheld camera shots, fades, long
takes and action scenes taken straight from
our favorite gangsta rhyme scenarios. These
scenes are the film's most consistent aspect
of production.
The direction gives "Menace II Society" a
gritty realism that makes John Singleton's
"Boyz 'N the Hood" — an equally valid depic
tion of the inner city — look like "State Fair."
Williams' screenplay and the twins' overzeal
ous staging suggests that their talent and com
mon sense will increase with maturity.

Bruce Lee biopic
doesn't capture
his complex life

Dragon

To most Americans, Bruce Lee was some
Chinese guy who emitted odd noises as he
beat the crap out of villains in low-budget
'70s action movies.
Few realize that Lee represented much
more: he was the first Asian man who broke
through the roles of servile cooks, laundry
men and effeminate Fu Manchu villains,
lighting up the screen with his extraordinary
grace and power. A complex, driven man
who devoted his life to achieving the highest
possible excellence in his chosen vocation —
fighting — he influenced every action film
since "Enter the Dragon" in the process.
