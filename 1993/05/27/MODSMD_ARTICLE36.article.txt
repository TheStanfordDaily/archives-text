Neo-hippies sing
the blues about
what's goin' on

World Party

Listening to the new World Party album,
the possibility of the world partying seems
grim.
"Bang!" — the group's effort — pes
simistically calls attention to the ills of the
world and our confused inability to do any
thing about them.
Karl Wallinger, singer, songwriter and
"multi-instrumentalist," has long been con
cerned with social and environmental issues.
On World Party's first album, he was per
ceived as a "neo-hippie," singing about
"making love to the world."
Somewhat appropriately, World Party
continues to draw on influences from artists
of the '60s: the Rolling Stones, Sly and the
Family Stone and Bob Dylan. Wallinger owes
a vocal debt to Mick Jagger and a lyrical debt
to Dylan, whose social consciousness seems
to have rubbed off on him.
"Read the morning papers/Seems like
nothing turns out right/Take a deep breath
yeah/It knocks out your lights," he sings, crit
icizing air pollution in the song "Give It All

Away."
But as the subjects in his songs puzzle over
methods to change the world, they never
seem able to answer their own questions. "But
all I see is chaos and understandingAVhy
don't you turn it off/Leave the world
alone/Cos you don't know," Wallinger con
cedes in the funk-derived "Radio Days."
Without a doubt the strangest song on the
album, "And God Said," represents the kind

of downbeat wavelength Wallinger's operat
ing on. An operatic voice intones, "And God
said 'Look after the planet'/ But Man said
'Fuck you!' "
While Wallinger unfortunately doesn't
offer any solutions to the problems he sings
about, he at least offers some good music —
which, even in light of its roots, manages to
put a new twist on the old.

The laughter that
CB4 missed gets
made up for here

CB4

Even if you didn't laugh during "C 84,"
you'll cry when you hear the album.
To enjoy the movie, which parodied hard
core rap and its artists, the viewer needed a
deep understanding of hip-hop culture.
Thus, to most people, "CB4" presented little
more than a sporadically funny, overextend
ed "Saturday Night Live" skit.
Luckily, the soundtrack thumps and
grooves enough for even the ignorant to
comprehend its flavor. With the exception of
two well-performed R&B tracks, slamming,
hardcore bass lines unify the album, daring
us to bob our heads for over 30 minutes be
fore the first break.
Appropriately, Chuck D and the Public
Enemy crew kick off the hardcore parade,
rhyming and bumping away on "Livin' in a
Zoo," a vintage P.E. track replete with Chuck's
heavy politics and Flavor Flav's comic relief.
Boogie Down Productions follows their
lead with another hype street beat on the
track "Black Cop." However, KRS-ONE can
not keep the lyrical pace that hard rhymer
Chuck D began. It sounds as if KRS-ONE is
trying to parody hardcore rap, exaggerating
the anger and determination in his voice.
Alternating between newcomers and
heavyweights not known for hardcore, Hur
ricane (featuring Beastie Boys writing and
production), Fu-Schnickens, Lifeline and
P.M. Dawn surprisingly keep the beats hard
and the rhyming fresh.
Teddy Riley and Blackstreet break the
hardcore chain with a pleasant New Jack
track "Baby Be Mine." Tracie Spencer follows
the R&B tip with "It's Alright," another
smooth, satisfying song.
Only funny in the context of the movie,
the last three songs feature faux-rappers CB4,
and are all appropriately buried at the end of
the album. Though comedy was sprinkled
sparsely throughout the movie, flavor
drenches this release.
Don't let the title fool you.
