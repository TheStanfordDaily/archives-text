Unlike some of his fellow literary story
tellers, Mark Twain has yet to be asso
ciated with a successful Broadway
musical — a situation the Stanford Drama
Department may have a hand in reversing.
The department's workshop production
of the virgin musical "The Prince and the
Pauper" — based on Twain's novel and
largely crafted by visiting New York theater
professionals — is the auspicious first step
in Twain's calculated waltz to Broadway.
Continuing its Stanford performances
through Saturday in the Nitery, "The Prince
and The Pauper" is a cocktail of collabora

tion. The director, book (script) writer,
composer-lyricists and producers — all
New York-based — are sharing the agony
and exhilaration of hammering out a
brand-new musical featuring Stanford stu
dents and two Bay Area child actors.
A comic tale of mistaken identity, "The
Prince and The Pauper" revolves around
two young boys in 16th-century England —
Prince Edward, heir to the English throne,
and penceless urchin, Tom Canty — who
find themselves captive in each other's lives.
Muddling through ticklish situations until
their predicament is resolved, they each gain
firsthand knowledge of life at the opposite
socioeconomic extreme.
Since "Pauper" is still being fine-tuned
— and the Stanford production is its first
incarnation — an orchestra, as well as elab
orate sets and costumes, are conspicuously
absent. Still, the workshop production is far
from a bland business. Choreographed

fights embroider the action, the bountiful
score (rendered on two live pianos) travers
es a range of rhythms and the book — once
again referring to the script, not Twain's

novel — is brisk and witty.
A bit of polish and a hefty dose of specta
cle will be applied to the musical in August,
when it transfers to the Peninsula Civic
Light Opera in San Mateo. The boys along
with five student cast members will join the
new performing ensemble, while students
among the artistic staff will be replaced by
veteran professionals.
Should the PCLO production take flight,
"Pauper" is expected to play in Asia — the
land of crucial financial backing. Through
possible subsequent bookings elsewhere in
the United States, the musical will undergo

farther refinements until, at some indeter
minate future time, it will be just a puddle
jump away from Broadway.
When director Michael Montel was
approached with the project last
year, "Pauper" s superior script
impressed him outright. "In most musicals
that one encounters — even some that are
produced — the book is the weakest ele
ment," remarks Montel, who has directed
plays and musicals on and off Broadway as
well as in opera houses, in regional theaters
and for television.
Musical theater tends to attract compos
er-lyricists more than playwrights, says
Montel, because "quite properly, the motor
of a musical is really the music." Hence a
shortage of strong, clever books.
"Pauper" was conceived by composer
lyricists Marc Elliot and Judd Woldin,
whose creative collaboration has exceeded

five years — not an inordinately long time,
given that the development of a new musi
cal can easily take 10 years from inception
to opening night. They crafted a score, "but

it didn't coalesce, until they found the right
book writer (playwright Richard Holland),"
reveals Montel.
Early on, Holland insisted their musical
couldn't feasibly be a faithful translation of
the novel. Elliot and Woldin were reluctant
to stray much from the original material,
but Holland continued to champion his lib
eral plan for the adaptation.
Because musical theater demands total
clarity, the author team transformed the
novel into a theatrical piece of resonant con
ceptual clarity, borrowing only the characters
and basic premise.
Like much of Twain's work, "Pauper" has
pessimistic undertones — which the
production, says Montel, doesn't ignore.
Nevertheless, the show accents the novel's
fund of humor and spirit of exploit.
"It's a lighthearted story in that it's an
adventure. The adventures that one used to
see Saturday afternoon in the movies were
very lighthearted in their total effect, but they
sometimes dealt with very dark subjects. All
the great adventure pictures do: Ivanhoe,
most of Errol Flynn's movies — which is very
much to the purpose here, because there's
that wonderful dash about ('Pauper')."
This Stanford workshop production of
"Pauper" is the brainchild of Simone Genatt,
a New York theater producer and '88
Stanford graduate. She arranged for Montel
and the author trio of Holland, Elliot and
Wold«n to join forces with the Drama
Department on this musical-in-progress.
The four also have been resident artists at
Stanford for most of spring quarter.
Workshops like the one at Stanford are
designed to investigate the promise of a
new, untested theatrical piece and provide a
basis for honing it, before it reaches a wider,
critical audience. Because the early empha
sis is on the raw material rather than pro
duction value, workshops call upon the
audience's visual imagination.
"There's that old joke (in theater)," relates
Montel, "that when something isn't work
ing, you say, 'Well, it'll all be right when we
have the scenery, the lighting, the costumes.'
Well, it really isn't. [Decoration] can divert
attention, and if the piece is staged lavishly,
it can mask something — but that's all it can
do. It won't solve the problem of what's not
working with the story."
According to Montel, the "Pauper"
undertaking is not typical of most contem
porary theater workshops. He claims many
workshops resort to "showcasing" pieces for
marketing purposes.
Montel describes the Stanford workshop as
"a good deal more pure than what you'd find
happening around the theater these days. You
know you're making a decision or exploration
because it's an artistic one — not because
you've got to go out there and sell the show."
Montel says he feels that the collaboration
he and his three "Pauper" colleagues have
forged is relatively rare in theater today. "It
seems to me, reading about it and talking to
people who did work in the older days on
Broadway, there used to be more of a com
munity of craftsmen and artists working
together in the theater," Montel reflects.
"It's very compartmentalized these days
— theater life. So, in a way, this is a little bit
unconventional — the writer, director, com
posers, all put down in a place that isn't their
home, making a home for the show." ■

"The Prince and The Pauper" plays tonight
through Saturday in the Nitery.
