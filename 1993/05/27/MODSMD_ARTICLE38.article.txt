Indecent Proposal
The Brat Packer, The TV Veteran
and The Sundance Kid can't save
this bomb. Destitute couple wants
money. Billionaire wants wife. Bil
lionaire offers a million dollars for
one night with wife. Couple ago
nizes over it. Wife does it. Husband
can't deal with it. Wife enjoyed it.
What's next? Pain, angst and
above all, a happy ending. What's
the moral? Pimpin' ain't easy?
Avoid. R
Lost In Yonkers
The transition from stage to screen
of Neil Simon's Pulitzer prize-win
ning play exposes its considerable
weaknesses. Two boys are sent to
live with their authoritarian grand
mother, who has oppressed her
childlike daughter (Mercedes
Ruehl) for each of her thirtysome
years. Despite an excellent ensem
ble cast, the film sinks further into
melodramatic sap with each pass
ing moment. Catch it on cable. R
Map of the Human Heart
Part WWII melodrama, part
"Dances With Seals," this Eskimo
epic sinks in sap, despite the pres

■ Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you. Kenneth
Branagh whips out a Bardful of
tricks to bring this Shakespearian
comedy to the screen. Two sets of
couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and
fall in love in a picturesque 18th
century Italian villa. Though the
American actors (Keanu Reeves
and, surprisingly, Denzel Washing
ton) can't really hang, the largely
British cast pulls off a bawdily mag
ical comedy. PG-13
Wide Sargasso Sea
Based on the novel by Jean Rhys,
this film explains how Mrs.
Rochester from Charlotte Bronte's
Jane Eyre ended up in the attic —
Mr. Rochester basically couldn't
handle an openly sexual woman.
Despite the frequent beautiful shots
of Jamaican scenery and the equal
ly frequent and energetic soft-focus
sex scenes, this shallow effort that
won't trap viewers in its story. Read
the book instead. NC-17
