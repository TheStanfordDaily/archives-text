As power shifts hands on campus, as people are named or
elected to positions of great responsibility, we'd like to
quote Shakespeare, "Uneasy lies the head that wears a
crown." This vid's for you.
The most recent film incarnation of the Bard's famous
tragedy, Macbeth, was directed by pedophilic bad boy Roman
Polanski. His baroque visual style was aptly suited to the story
of a nobleman who kills a king at his wife's urging, in order to
ascend to the throne. Considered exceedingly violent in its day,
it still packs an Elizabethan-sized wallop.
Former wunderkind Orson Welles also directed and starred
in a version of "Macbeth." But he's best known for Citizen
Kane, which is widely regarded as the best film ever made.
Welles starred as the title character — loosely based on pub
lishing magnate William Randolph Hearst — who pushes
aside his wife, family and friends in an obsessive attempt to ex
tend his grasp across the land. Chiaroscuro lighting, deep
focus cinematography and an innovative flashback structure
make this a must see for any cintaste.
Francis Ford Coppola spent vast amounts of money and
time filming Apocalypse Now, perhaps the film that best
captures the insanity of war. Based on Conrad's "Heart of
Darkness," it follows Marlowe, a government operative. He's
been sent to murder Kurtz, a U.S. colonel who's gone native
big-time, installing himself as a godlike leader of a ragtag band
of Vietnamese farmers. Marlon Brando's portrayal of a de
mented leader shows what unchecked power can do to the
human mind. ■
