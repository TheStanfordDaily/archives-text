## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Dozens of students concerned about the re
lationship between students and the adminis
tration have organized a teach-in scheduled for
noon today in White Plaza.
The teach-in was organized to address con
cerns that students do not have access to deci
sion-making bodies in the University or to indi
vidual members of the administration.
"Different people in the Stanford communi
ty — people in the ethnic communities, the les
bian, gay and bisexual communities, and the
disabled community and also just concerned

citizens — have been concerned that we
haven't gotten clear messages" from the ad
ministration on many issues involving stu
dents, said Harrison Hsieh, chair of the
Asian/Pacific Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford and a member of the group
organizing the rally.
Hsieh explained that speakers at the event
would focus on the planned re-evaluations of
undergraduate education, the Office of Multi
cultural Development and the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report, among other
issues.
A flier advertising the event also mentions
concerns about the possible elimination of

some majors and need-blind admissions. "We
are not assuming the computer science major
will be cut," Hsieh said. "We're just saying
these are possibilities based on quotes and fac
tual accounts of administrators' actions.
"We want to say what does this mean and
how can we get involved," he added. "We're not
trying to cause a panic or riot."
Junior Matt Scelza, another student work
ing on the teach-in, said the group does not
have full information about changes afoot in
the University. He said he wants both to learn
more and pass on what he has learned. "We
know some things. We don't
know all things. We'd like to
explain those things we do know
to other students."
Organizers stressed that the
event is not meant to be con
frontational. "Tomorrow is a
teach-in, not a rally, not a demon
stration," Hsieh said. "We are
interested as much as possible in
working with the administration."
In addition to planning the
teach-in — titled "The Changing
State of the University: Will the
students be heard?" — the broad
based group has also contacted
numerous administrators through
e-mail, letters and personal visits
in an effort to establish relation
ships with "a real broad cross
section of administrators," Hsieh
said.
