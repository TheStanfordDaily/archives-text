## Ladies first 
### 
If frat parties and dorm socials
aren't cutting it for the fairer sex on
this campus, perhaps it's time to try
an all-women's dance. That's what
the women of BGLAS have put to
gether: an "Evening of Elegance," for
ladies only.
Ready to kick your heels up and
shout? Think again. Instead, you'll
sway to the soft sounds of a local jazz
band and sample sumptuous hors
d'oeuvres with other women who'll
be dressed as semi-formally as they
wanna be.
The dance will held tomorrow at
Bechtel International Center from 9
p.m to 1 a.m. Admission is $3 at the
door.
