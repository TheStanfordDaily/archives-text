## ...summer jobs 
### 
This summer, you have several choices for
employment:
• go home, don't work, watch a lot of VH
1, have all the days slowly run together, slow
ly ooze your way into brain death, start the
Great American Novel, quit after page four.
• go home, get a menial job, take orders
from a big, dumb guy, quit in mid-August
after making up an excuse about wanting to

spend time with your family and pets.
• go home, get an nepotistic law-firm in
ternship, start learning that it's not impor
tant if you think as long as you can follow or
ders, start filing things wrong in hopes of get
ting fired.
• do community service in a faraway coun
try, fret glumly, note the innovative plumbing
systems, avoid the large, tropical insects, stay
away from "resistance movements."
• stay at school, continue to successfully

avoid life, laugh long, teary-eyed laughs at
others.
• don't go home; take an "alternative" job
as an Alaska fisherman, start reading Jack
Kerouac books and accumulating tattoos,
lobby relatives for nepotistic internships for
next summer.
Have fun. School starts September 29.
