If your sweet babboo
has dumped you,
two-timed you or
written something that
just tore your heart out,
perhaps you should
drag your whining dis
play of self-pity to the
Drama Department
for Harold Pinter's
"Betrayal." The play is a
subtly searing exami
nation of infidelity and
friendship.
Performances are
held in the Eleanor
Prosser Studio, at the
back of Memorial

Hall. Showtimes are this Sunday at 2 p.m.
and Monday at 8 p.m. There is a suggested
donation of $3 at the door.
■ He's baaack
Nine Tony Awards haven't swelled
Tommy Tune's head so much that he can't
make a stop in the Bay Area. Okay, maybe
he's doing it for the money, but hey, singers
have to eat too.
"Tommy Tune Tonite," features a reper
toire of songs from three of show business'
most acclaimed composers: Cole Porter, Irv
ing Berlin and George Gershwin. But wait —
there's more. Tommy pays homage to the style
and grace of Fred Astaire, proving that while
white men might not be able to jump, they
can learn to dance if they put their minds to it.
"Tommy Tune Tonite" begins Wednesday
June 9 at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco.
For tickets or showtimes, call 510-762-BASS.
■ Give me body
The Holocaust and slavery dominate the
thinking of a mental-patient-turned-hold
up-artist in "Why We Have a Body."
The play puts women in non-traditional
roles and professions. Mary — the tragicom
ic center of the play — is an off-balance, yet
sympathetic character whose delusions are
really those of a society that dictates to
women what they can and cannot do.
The play's success has forced it to extend
its run through June 20 at the Magic Theater
in San Francisco. Call 415-441-8822 for
more information.
