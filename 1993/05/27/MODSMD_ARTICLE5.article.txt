Exemption of all African-Amer
ican men from military service,
freedom for all African-American
people in prisons and jails and an
immediate end to police brutality:
These were just three points
speakers from the Black Panther
Party urged last night in Kresge
Auditorium.
The speech, sponsored by the

Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, focused
on the beliefs and history of the
Black Panther Party, and the speak
ers — all one-time rank-and-file
party members — expressed hope
for young African-Americans today.
Tereka Lewis, who was the first
"sister" to join the party and once
taught security, weapon and drill
classes to party followers, warned
young African-Americans to re
spect their past.
"This is a wartime we were

born into — we are still in this
wartime," she said. "This power
structure wants you to hate your
heritage, so you will hate yourself.
"You have to have undying love
for your people. Your people and
nation come first," she added. Ac
cording to Lewis, one can do this
by "knowing your history, and the
truth about this history; don't
keep it to yourself."
"Contribute to papers to see
what's going on nationwide and

what's happening with African-
American people," she urged.
The Black Panther Party was
founded in 1966, and its early
years were spent initiating com
munity programs and schools as
well as working to alleviate the im
mediate health needs of African-
Americans.
After a split within the party in
1971, members turned to morepo-
litical programs, said Landon
Williams. From 1960-1971,
Williams said, the party worked to
clean up drug use around their
offices and to give people "some
thing else to do." They also "rid
community of vicious police —
shot 'em up," Williams added. "We
picked our targets selectively."
Williams said the party used its
leverage in electing African-
American politicians. "If they
were righteous, we voted them in.
If not, we voted them out.
"We showed our people how to
use political consequences. . . .
How to boycott, use the vote, use
the armed forces — small guerilla
forces, not massive rebellions," he
added.
Williams concluded by chal
lenging the African-Americans of

today to "have the balls to contin
ue that legaty."
The speakers last night often
referred to a 10-point platform
that constituted the party's core
beliefs, including a desire for"the
power to determine the destiny of
the black community, an end to
the robbery of the black commu
nity by the capitalists, education
that exposes the true nature of
the decadent American society
and trial of blacks by a jury of
their peer group or people from
black communities."
A final point on the party's
platform — and its major political
objective — was to form "a Unit
ed Nations-supervised plebiscite
to be held throughout the black
colony in which only black colo
nial subjects will be allowed to
participate, for the purpose of
determining the will of the black
people as to their national des
tiny."
