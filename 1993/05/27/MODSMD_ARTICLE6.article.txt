Because a year-long search
for a Black Community Services
Center director has turned up
empty, acting director Barbara
Smith will lead the center for
the next two years, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson an
nounced yesterday.
Another national search will
probably be conducted, begin
ning in fall 1994, to find a per
manent director, Jackson said.
"Barbara has done a very
good job as acting director this
year," Jackson said. "Barbara
knows the community. She
knows Stanford and its re
sources. I've seen her really
grow and come into her own this
year."
Smith could not be reached
for comment last night.
Although she did not apply

for the direc
tor position,
Smith had
served as cen
ter's assistant
director since
September
1991. She
took over as
acting director
after Keith
Archuleta's

resignation in June 1992.
Before becoming assistant
director, Smith served as the
center's office manager and a
member of the Black House's
policy board â€” a nine-member
group that serves as the center's
general governing body. She
originally came to campus 12
years ago as an accounting as
sistant for the ASSU.
