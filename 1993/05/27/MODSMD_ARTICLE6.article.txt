Because a year-long search
for a Black Community Services
Center director has turned up
empty, acting director Barbara
Smith will lead the center for
the next two years, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson an
nounced yesterday.
Another national search will
probably be conducted, begin
ning in fall 1994, to find a per
manent director, Jackson said.
"Barbara has done a very
good job as acting director this
year," Jackson said. "Barbara
knows the community. She
knows Stanford and its re
sources. I've seen her really
grow and come into her own this
year."
Smith could not be reached
for comment last night.
Although she did not apply

for the direc
tor position,
Smith had
served as cen
ter's assistant
director since
September
1991. She
took over as
acting director
after Keith
Archuleta's

resignation in June 1992.
Before becoming assistant
director, Smith served as the
center's office manager and a
member of the Black House's
policy board â€” a nine-member
group that serves as the center's
general governing body. She
originally came to campus 12
years ago as an accounting as
sistant for the ASSU.
Sophomore Anietie Ekanem,


Smith
co-chair of the Black Student
Union, called Smith's appoint
ment "an excellent idea."
"She's a very qualified individ
ual who will serve well in that
role," Ekanem said. "I think the
black community, and every com
munity, will benefit from having
her in that role."
Education Prof. John Baugh,
the search committee's chair,
said, "We did our best through
our national search to identify
individuals who could come and

bring strengths to the University.
"When the process didn't pan
out, we had to make a decision
whether we wanted to go further
down the list or look for alterna
tives," Baugh said. "It was the
consensus of the committee that
Barbara Smith had done a good
job during the past year and we
recommended that she be asked
to serve at least for two more
years."
Jackson said part of the rea
soning behind selecting Smith
was a desire for continuity. "We
are very concerned about bring
ing stability to the Black Commu
nity Services Center," he said.
"It's a chance for students and

staff to rally behind Barbara."
An assistant director will prob
ably be hired for a limited two
year term to assist in running the
center, Jackson said. "What Bar
bara will probably do is have a
local search to fill the position. It
will be good experience for some
one who is interested in academic
administration."
After the next two years,
another national search will likely
begin with a new search commit
tee, according to Jackson. "The
timing would not be very good to
start a search now," he said,
adding that most candidates
would already be committed to
jobs for the next academic year.
