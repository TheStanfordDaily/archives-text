# 'Now it's up to the administration to reach out to us.'
## Students call for increased voice in University decisions

A newly formed student coalition
led about 150 students in a noon
"teach-in" yesterday in White Plaza,
calling for the University to listen to
student voices and to renew its com

"We're initiating a process of stu
dents meeting with the University to
make decisions," said freshman Jerry
Chen. "The idea of this teach-in is not
to be antagonistic but to educate stu
dents and work with the administra
tion so that we can have a voice in

what's going on."
Students involved said they orga
nized the tearh-in, titled "The Chang
ing State of the University: Will the
students be heard?" out of a growing
concern that student input would be
left out of key decisions as the Univer
sity prepares to re-evaluate undergrad
uate education and its commitment to
multiculturalism.
The diverse group of students pur
posely chose not to name itself. "We
wanted to stress that these are not in
dividuals with personal agendas but in
terested students coming together to
let our voices be heard," Chen said.
Speakers raised concerns about a

wide range of topics, including the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues,
the Women's Needs Assessment, the
upcoming Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Needs Assessment, and the new Com
mission on Undergraduate Education.
For example, some students said
they were worried about the recent
University Cabinet draft response to
the 1991 UCMI review's redefinition of
"multiculturalism" as "transcultural
ism" and its suggestion that ethnic
theme houses could become self-segre
gating.
