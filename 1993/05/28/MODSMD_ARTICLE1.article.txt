# 'Now it's up to the administration to reach out to us.'
## Students call for increased voice in University decisions 
### Colleen Krueger Nicolas Kuritzky Staff writers 
A newly formed student coalition
led about 150 students in a noon
"teach-in" yesterday in White Plaza,
calling for the University to listen to
student voices and to renew its com
mitment to multiculturalism.
"We're initiating a process of stu
dents meeting with the University to
make decisions," said freshman Jerry
Chen. "The idea of this teach-in is not
to be antagonistic but to educate stu
dents and work with the administra
tion so that we can have a voice in

what's going on."
Students involved said they orga
nized the tearh-in, titled "The Chang
ing State of the University: Will the
students be heard?" out of a growing
concern that student input would be
left out of key decisions as the Univer
sity prepares to re-evaluate undergrad
uate education and its commitment to
multiculturalism.
The diverse group of students pur
posely chose not to name itself. "We
wanted to stress that these are not in
dividuals with personal agendas but in
terested students coming together to
let our voices be heard," Chen said.
Speakers raised concerns about a

wide range of topics, including the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues,
the Women's Needs Assessment, the
upcoming Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Needs Assessment, and the new Com
mission on Undergraduate Education.
For example, some students said
they were worried about the recent
University Cabinet draft response to
the 1991 UCMI review's redefinition of
"multiculturalism" as "transcultural
ism" and its suggestion that ethnic
theme houses could become self-segre
gating.
Students also addressed the Univer-

sity's response towards disability
issues and the role of the Office of
Multicultural Development, say
ing that the office should be more
than a collector of statistics.
Speakers urged students to
inform themselves about the
University's plans and policies.
"We must have the ability to
question [Stanford policies!
alongside" the administration,
said sophomore Anietie Ekanem,
co-chair of the Black Student
Union.
ASSU senator Mork Murdock
cautioned that effective and com
prehensive decisions cannot be
made "unless we educate our
selves about the issues."
The rally also attracted a
number of administrators and
professors, some of whom had
been invited through e-mail mes
sages.
While many said they felt the
students' initiative was laud
able, some felt the students' con
cerns were premature and mis
guided.
Special Assistant to the Presi
dent Jean Fetter said she finds it
"unfortunate that students feel
they are not being heard." But
she expressed concern that the
rally was one-sided, since stu
dents did not ask administrators
to speak.
"They told me they were con
cerned about need-blind admis
sions, but they did not even speak
to the dean of admissions," she
added.
Judith Little, the newly
appointed acting director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, noted the miscommunica
tion between the University and
teach-in organizers.
"What concerned me today is

that there is a great deal of com
mitment to student voices that I
don't think is getting across,"
Little said. "A lot of these deci
sions will be delayed until stu
dents can fully participate. Pres
ident Casper is very committed
to student participation and
input."
Little also noted that while the
teach-in was a "good idea," it con
veyed some misinformation. "It
is not true that students were not
involved in the last review pro
cess," she said, disputing several
speakers who claimed that stu
dents have persistently been
excluded from reviews of multi
cultural issues.
Organizers, however, are opti
mistic about the event's effects.
"The teach-in went well," said
senior Harrison Hsieh, chair of
the Asian/Pacific Islanders for
Education and Change at Stan
ford.
"I think the administration
definitely got the message that
students want to work with them
on these changes that are occur
ring," he said.
"Now it's up to the adminis
tration to reach out to us. . . .
This is, as everything, a two-way
street."
Ekanem said "a concerted
effort" had been made to commu
nicate with administrators before
yesterday and to gather informa
tion on the issues. "It was unfor
tunate that it had to come down
to a teach-in for people to really
listen."
He added, "There's going to be
a lot of follow-up — as far as
meeting with administrators and
students — so all people can take
part in a common vision."
During the teach-in, organiz
ers distributed pamphlets that
summarized many of the issues
touched on by the speakers and
solicited input from other "con

cerned students."
In addition, members of the
audience were requested to sign
half-page form letters addressed
to the administration asking it to
include students on committees
examining such issues as under
graduate education.
The letter also stated, "To
establish a basis of all students'
voices, we want the University to
reaffirm the role of the Office of
Multicultural Development and
to implement the recommenda
tions" of various reports on the
needs of ethnic and minority
communities. According to
Hsieh, organizers collected "at
least 150 letters."
Many students at the hour
long rally supported the concerns
raised. Junior Greg Schaul said
the teach-in "increased aware
ness of what issues the Stanford
community is concerned about."
Freshman Janice Lu said, "It
show that Stanford students are
not apathetic."
A post-rally discussion attend
ed by about 20 students was held
after the teach-in had been dis
rupted by rain. Organizers and
concerned listeners exchanged
ideas about the group's goals and
effectiveness.
At the discussion, graduate
student Alex Accetta said more
concrete student resolve is
necessary. "They are going to
give you your voice and then
not do a damn thing about it,"
he said.
Most students at the discus
sion echoed Accetta's senti
ments, citing the need for more
student determination and per
sistence.
The teach-in's organizers will
meet with administrators includ
ing Dean of Students Michael
Jackson today and will hold a dis
cussion Sunday that will be open
to students.
