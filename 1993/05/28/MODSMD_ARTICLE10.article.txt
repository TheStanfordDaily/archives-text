# Clinton's tax bill gets House approval
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Democrats
pushed a massive deficit-reduction tax
increase through the House last night,
handing President Clinton a narrow
victory in the most critical test of his
fledgling administration.
The 219-213 vote, with all Republi
cans in opposition, sent the bill to a
difficult fight in the Senate.
President Clinton, beset in recent
days by controversy, swiftly hailed
his triumph. He said the House had
voted "no to gridlock, no to the sta
tus quo and no to the special inter
ests who worked so very hard to
frighten Americans" about his eco
nomic program.
"Tomorrow we go on to the Senate
and we go on to the country," he
added.
The vote climaxed a day of debate in
the House and a final flurry of phone

calls from Clinton and Vice President
A 1 Gore to wavering Democrats.
House Speaker Thomas Foley deliv
ered a final plea for Democrats to
embrace the president's economic
plan, saying the vote was no less
momentous than the decision to go to
war in the Persian Gulf. "This is the
time to justify your election," he
declared.
A cheer erupted from the Demo
cratic side of the chamber as the score
board showed the 218 votes needed for
passage. Republicans cheered as well,
as if to reaffirm their solid opposition
to Clinton's tax hikes.
"If we don't vote for the president,
we cut him off at the knees," said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. "We can't do
that.. . . We must show the country
we can govern."
Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., dis-

missed such pleas as garbage. "Bill
Clinton was elected on promises to
reduce the deficit," he said. "He
deserves a chance to live up to his own
promises. When he does that, I'll give
his programs a chance."
No Republican voted for the bill,
which was supported by 218
Democrats and the chamber's lone
independent. Thirty-eight Democrats
joined 175 Republicans in voting no.
The only absent member was Rep.
Paul Henry, R-Mich., who is ill.
The bill, a combination of tax
increases and spending restraints, is
part of a plan to reduce the deficit by
about $500 billion over the next five
years. The tax increases would
exempt most low-income people, cost
middle-income families perhaps $17
a month and fall heavily on the well
to-do.

The bill's fate in the Senate is
uncertain. Already, some Democrats
have announced their intention to
strip a broad-based energy tax from
the measure, and even as the House
was voting Democratic Sen. David
Boren of Oklahoma was telling a tele
vision interviewer of his opposition.
"If we don't want to slip back into
the mode of being the tax-and-spend
party, we will reshape this package,"
Boren said on CNN.
The bill is the first big installment
of Clinton's plan to lower the $300 bil
lion annual deficit by an average of
$100 billion a year. It includes about
$250 billion in tax increases over the
next five years and a $90 billion reduc
tion in spending. The plan anticipates
that Congress will vote later this year
on an additional $160 billion in sav
ings on interest and spending.
