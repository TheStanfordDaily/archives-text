## A 						real Major's Day 
### 
Informative fair should
not be another victim of
University's budget cuts

(( ECENT BUDGET cuts"
are three words that
JL vhave, regrettably, been
mentioned entirely too often over
the course of this academic year.
Legions of programs have been
either cut or forced to make due
with fewer staffers, less funding or
less publicity.
One such victim of the neces
sary but still-painful cuts has
been Major's Day. This year's
event, held on Wednesday, was a
small, scaled-back affair, a far cry
from the extravaganzas of years
past.
It is sad that informing stu
dents of the various major options
available to them no longer
appears to be a priority of the Uni
versity.
Though it may be claimed that
students can utilize other
resources to help them in the
quest to determine their Universi
ty future, Major's Day is still an
important event — one which
should be spared from the bud
getary axe.
It is a difficult process for stu
dents to go around to various
departments individually and ask
all pertinent questions regarding
their prospective majors. Major's
Days of years past gave students an
inkling toward what possible
options lay before them while also
suggesting that the University
cared about ensuring that students
would find an appropriate and sat
isfying major.
Furthermore, as it was held at
approximately the same time as
Prospective Freshman Week,
Major's Day gave a human face
to the various departments at
Stanford — an important aspect
in luring students to any univer
sity.
This year, the event was at least

50 percent smaller than in any of
its previous 16 years, because the
Undergraduate Advising Center
was forced to cut the $3,000
expense of holding the affair.
$3,000 is not exactly a king's ran
som.
The UAC was forced by recent
budget cuts to either eliminate an
advisor position or Major's Day.
While it was a wise choice for the
UAC to cut the majors event
instead of an academic advisor, it
was unwise for the University to
impose a 15 percent budget cut on
the UAC.
Because of the budgetary dilem
ma which the University forced the
UAC to resolve, this year's Major's
Day looked like a haphazard
attempt, with only 25 majors repre
sented, instead of the normal 60
booths.
A large gathering of academic
opportunities is essential for unde
clared students — and previously
Major's Day filled that need. With
almost every major represented,
the event was the easiest and most
practical way to find out about dif
ferent programs on campus.
Deciding to have a major is not
an option or frill. A major is man
dated by the University if a student
wishes to graduate.
In fact, there would not even had
been a Major's Day at all, if not for
the volunteer efforts of several
staffers, who organized a "grass
roots effort" to ensure that stu
dents could learn of various major
opportunities.
Upon finding out that Major's
Day would not be funded, these
workers took the time and trouble
to stage and publicize a necessarily
smaller production. While this
year's Major's Day was a signifi
cantly less informative affair than
in previous years, the benevolent
and tireless work of these unrecog
nized staffers should not go unno
ticed.
More students would benefit
from a majors event that costs
$3,000 than a University Food Ser
vice Food Faire that costs $4,000.
It is time for the University to
evaluate its priorities.
