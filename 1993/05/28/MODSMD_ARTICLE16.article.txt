## Goodbye, farewell, amen 
### 
I CAME HERE. Some stuff happened.
Some stuff didn't happen. I didn't
really learn a damn thing. The end.
Stop reading now, please.
Thank you very much for allowing me
to use your space. I'd gladly give it back
to Andy Berkowitz (most of you don't
know who he is, though), but you'll have
to settle for someone else, since I don't
think he'll be coming back anytime soon.
I hope you've had a nice ride.
Since it's traditional, I'll tell you a few
things that I've learned at Stanford. I've
learned to be an above-average thief. I get
this little twitch in the back of my neck
five minutes before house meeting
breaks.
In 14 seconds flat, I can be in and out
of the lounge with an arm-load of donut
holes. If you pay the extortionists at
Tresidder for laser printing, get a clue
and a friend who works in a lab. Free
photocopiers are harder to find, but
they're out there.
Outside the Bursar's office you can get
free envelopes. In an attempt to keep you
from stealing them, the University puts
big black lines across the fronts of the
envelopes. It's an easy thing to work
around.
If you're actually sending resumes, I
don't recommend using these envelopes
though.
A friend of mine tells me that you can
wait 45 days to pay your phone bill,

before they get mad. However, his PAC
number just got canned, so I don't know
how reliable that information is.
In addition to thievery, I learned to
be an excellent coward. To not stand up
for my beliefs. To not fight for what
should be. To hide my dissent in a dark
corner and leave it to fester. Anyone
whose cheese meter just overloaded can
go to Hell.
By the power vested in me by the
Duck Tyrant of Thebes, I grant any
one the right to take a dull, rusty
kitchen knife and cut the chin off of
anybody sporting a Matt Dillon "Sin
gles" goatee.
A car alarm is only worth it if you can
get the kind that makes the car bark. I
am issuing a $20 bounty to anyone who
can kidnap and bring me the Christian
Slater look-alike who is selling cars on TV
by comparing them to punk rock. For
free, whoever brings him to me can join
in the torture.
Oh yeah, sorry to break up the
stream of consciousness, but everyone
stop whining. Everyone has a lot of
work. So shut up about your own. I
don't care and no one else cares either if
you have a C program about slugs and
three papers to write in the next two
days. I don't think you're cool because
you have a lot of work. Whine. Counter
whine. Counter-counter-whine.
Arrrrgh! Just stop, accept that you have

a lot of work, and don't parade it in
front of the rest of us, because we don't
care, and one day we're liable to take
sawed-off shotguns to you.
Once upon a time, I thought that one
of my friends just said weird things to say
them, to seem strange. Later, I realized
that he was just whacked out of his head.
That's besides the point, which is if you
say weird things just for the effect of say
ing weird things, someday somebody is
going to punch out your lights. So, don't
do it.
So there you have it, all of the admoni
tions and random scraps of thought that
I never got out onto this page. Before I
close, I must mention the freshman
"90210" freak who was lucky enough to
land a senior majoring in an engineering
field, the Christian so continually happy
that he should be beaten, the RA with the
wonderful technicolor shirt and my
group of oh-so-deadly friends.
If you didn't like my column, I'm sorry
and you'll never have to hear from me
again. If you enjoyed it, so much the bet
ter.
I learned something, but I don't know
what yet. Anyway, I'm gone.

Kenny was glad that he could have a
senior blurb page, even in college.
