Excuses for lack of summer storage are unconvincing

THIS IS REALLY getting out of
hand. As students, we are all well
aware of the enormous inconve
nience find fiscal burden the decision to
eliminate storage has placed on our
shoulders. Those of us who do not live in
the immediate vicinity must now go off
campus and rent expensive off-campus
storage. The hassle is even greater for
si dents, like myself, who have not been
blessed with a car. When the end of the
year rolls around, I will be left standing
with a computer, futon, desk lamp and a
mountain bike, nowhere to keep them,
no way of transporting my belongings to
off-campus storage and no one in this
fine institution who gives a damn.
Of course, there must be some legiti
mate reason why Keith Guy, Diana Con
klin and the rest of the Housing folks
have decided to place the Stanford stu
dent body in this position, right?
There may well be, but if there is, I
have yet to hear it. Up to this point, they
have provided us with a jumbled mix of
poor excuses. First, and foremost, is the
fire code. In their letter to residents of
the row, Guy and Conklin claimed that
the storage spaces present a fire hazard
and thus must be shut down. According
to the local fire marshal, as we read in
The Daily earlier, this is hardly the case.

While the fire code does require that
some changes be made to some of the
storage spaces (i.e. adding a second
entrance), these logistical problems are
small, and, according to the fire mar
shal, do not justify the elimination of
storage altogether.
The next few arguments Guy and
Conklin present to us revolve around
issues of money and staff time. They
claim it is too expensive to hire staff to
administer the storage spaces. I find this
somewhat hard to swallow. While I real
ize that the University is under strong
budgetary constraints, the cost of hiring
a few people to staff the storage rooms
for a few days at the beginning and end
of summer is meager in relation to the
enormity of the service they are provid
ing. Even if Housing and Food Service
lacked the funding, the problem could be
avoided by simply charging students a
storage fee. It's that simple.
They also state that in several of the
residences, they use bedrooms as storage
spaces, and that the University needs
those rooms for revenue-generating
summer conferences. Such a statement
implies some rather twisted priorities.
The official purpose of allowing confer
ences to use the residences over the
summer is to generate revenue. This

money goes into the housing budget to
defer student housing costs. It should
serve as a service to students. By elimi
nating storage altogether, to make space
for a few additional conference guests,
however, the University has shoved off
the needs of the students in order to
squeeze a little bit more money out of
the conference program. Who is benefit
ting from such an arrangement? Cer
tainly not the students.
They then have the nerve to bring up
points like the fact that sometimes stu
dents get accepted to overseas programs
at the last minute and need to access
their storage. Despite the fact that stu
dents are charged for this service, Guy
and Conklin claim it is an inconvenience
for their staff, and thus is a problem. I
swear I am not making this up. Having
worked for the Conference Office last
summer at Governor's Corner, I will
openly admit that we did have one stu
dent who needed to access his storage.
They charged him $25. Seems like a weak
excuse to shut down student storage.
I think I have made my point. None
of the reasons for eliminating summer
storage presented thus far represent
anything larger than a few logistical
problems, all of which could be worked
around.

So why isn't anybody doing anything
about it?
The reason is simple. Our University
administrators have decided they do not
want to bother with it. It would be an
inconvenience. Let the ASSU take care
of it.
Something is wrong with this picture.
Summer storage affects almost every
student on this campus. It is one of the
most important student services this
University offers. It is a travesty that
the director of Housing and Food Service
would choose to eliminate summer stor
age to avoid dealing with the logistical
issues involved in maintaining it. It
seems to me that if Keith Guy does not
think it worth his time to address this
issue, maybe we should find someone
who does.
Mary Edmonds, Gerhard Casper, are
you listening?
We have the ability to address this
problem. What we are lacking is leader
ship and dedication.
I recognize that it may be too late for
this year, but we should not let this
issue die. I implore the University to
address this matter. We need this service
to continue.
