# Food Service must not require the purchase of expensive eating plans
## 
### 
I applaud Kennell A. Jackson, Jr.'s
May 25 letter concerning mismanage
ment and potential abuse by Food Ser
vice. I encourage top University officials
and the University community at large
to take a closer look at Food Service, a
$20 million (or higher) campus service
that, despite persistent student com-

plaints, receives little attention.
In particular, many undergraduates
will soon sign a 1993-94 Housing Agree
ment to live in a dormitory. That Hous
ing Agreement compels them to buy a
minimum Food Plan every quarter, at a
price that is often more expensive than
similar, even better, board plans at many
Row houses and eating clubs. For exam
ple, a friend of mine hashes at an eating
club, and it is convenient for him to eat
his meals at the club. Also, the club's
plan is cheaper than Food Service. He
drew into a dorm, however, and is com
pelled to buy the more expensive Food

Service plan, despite believing the eating
club offers better-quality food for less.
Perhaps eliminating the monopolistic
clause of the Residence Agreement that
forces students to take a meal plan from
Food Service if they live in a dorm would
introduce an element of competition into
the University food scene that would
lower prices and improve quality. My
guess, however, is that Food Service
would heatedly resist competition and
student choice, as it would force them to
trim the fat.
