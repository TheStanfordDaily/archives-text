# Harassment policy endorsed by Fac Sen
## Committee suggested for final modifications 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday unani
mously endorsed the latest draft of the
University's sexual harassment policy, but
recommended that a faculty, staff and stu
dent committee aid in its final revision.
Stymieing University President Ger
hard Casper's effort to have the policy in
place by September, the senate suggested
that the committee continue discussion of
the policy with University officials this
summer and bring a revised draft before
the senate at its first meeting in October
for a final endorsement.
During the discussion that preceded the
vote, Casper reiterated his desire to have
the official policy in place by the beginning
of the next academic year.
"Another year without the policy is one
more than I feel comfortable living with,"
Casper said of the three-year drafting and
revising process.
But School of Education Prof. Myra
Strober, who proposed the recommenda
tion, said that although the senate's sug

gestion would conflict with Casper's dead
line, she hopes he will be willing to delay
the finalization of the policy for the sen
ate's approval.
"The downside is that it will not be done
next fall, but the upside is that [Casper]
will ultimately have a policy that the facul
ty endorses," Strober said.
The policy work group received 140 re
actions from faculty, staff and students
during last month's public response period,
Casper said. "A good number of them were
taken into consideration."
Casper cited the addition of a confiden
tiality clause — "a sharp modification of
the earlier draft" — as a key example of the
community's influence on the policy.
A compromise between protecting confi
dentiality and keeping the University in
line with legal obligations to spot repeat of
fenders was reached by distinguishing be
tween "concerns" and "charges," Casper
said.
In the current draft, a complainant can
voice a concern or question regarding ha-
rassment without having records
kept. A charge against a specific
individual, however, requires that
the complainant consent to being
identified to the alleged perpetra

tor.
"At times, people feel that they
don't have an impact if they don't
win — but their input is taken
into consideration," Casper
added.
At the meeting, Political Sci
ence Prof. Terry Karl and Lin
guistics Prof. Elizabeth Traugott
distributed a memo for discussion

with "suggested modifications" to
the policy. The memo outlines
various areas of concern, citing
examples from other universities'
policies.
Karl commended Casper's
work on the policy, but said the
current draft needs to
"enhance" its definition of sexu
al harassment and protect the

parties involved — the com
plainant, the accused and the
University.
In addition, the grievance pro
cedures outlined in the current
draft "makes it seem as if sexual
harassment can be handled in the
same way as other complaints,"
Karl said. But sexual harassment
"involves a degradation, dehu

manization and a great deal of
pain," requiring it to be treated
differently.
Tom Matteoli, a representative
for the policy work group, said
that although he is uncertain
about the next step in the process,
he believes the work group's
"involvement with the policy is
done."

"Although some of the (poli
cy's) logistics need to be worked
out, I do think the time frame is
right in line," said Matteoli, direc
tor of employee relations and
development.
