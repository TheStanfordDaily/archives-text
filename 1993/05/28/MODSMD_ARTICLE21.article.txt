# Joel Stein: Portrait of a columnist as a washed-up youth

### 
I

NEVER CARED

about you. To me, you were just another
stop on the road, another groupie whose
name I wouldn't remember if it were tat
tooed on my ass. You, gentle reader, were
as interchangeable to me as blonde
women were to the producers of "Three's
Company."
If you didn't read my column, someone
else would have. And to me, it doesn't
much matter if that person is using this
as a supplement to Hooked on Phonics or
if she's using it as the subject of a literary
salon for brilliant, beautiful identical
twins whose dads own major daily news
papers. I always go one step too far.
Not too tart, not too sweet
So don't flatter yourself by thinking I
wrote these sweet somethings for your
ears. I refrained from teaching and mor
alizing not because I thought that better
left to Aaron Spelling, but because I sim
ply don't care about you. The only advice

I ever gave wa3 "Don't stick anything up
your urethra." And I'm pretty sure that
wasn't even in a column.
For the last three years, this space has
served as my diary. Only instead of bind
ing it with one of those cheap, utterly
useless locks my sister bought, I make
13,000 copies of it each week.
Because I need to have someone read
this. Someone I don't know and will
never meet, outside of brief, embarrass
ing encounters at video-dating services.
There is a great relief, a great freedom in
talking to complete strangers. Especially
when nobody's offering you Tootsie
Pops.
By presenting my thoughts and emo
tions to strangers — that I was dumped,
that my parents got divorced, that I find
Suzanne Sommers attractive — I free
myself from the loneliness of bearing
these musings alone. They stop being
purely mine and become community
property with my name on it.
And strangers give the best criticism.
Professor's red marks and effete men in
creative-writing workshops provide con
voluted, unhelpful comments like
"Although this is very good, I think it

would be even stronger if your main char
acter was a little more, um, articulate."
Strangers give the only advice which
really matters, which really helps, like
"That sucked." Or, worse yet, "I didn't
read it.'"
Fertile as ever
I have squandered this opportunity,
and now it is gone. I have failed. Week
after week I have tried to capture a single
emotion — the feeling of loss over a ring
ing telephone as you are about to ask
someone out, the frustration of not feel
ing anything when someone is crying on
your shoulder, the sense of depravity
when Cindy flashes those big, bright,
blue eyes.
But instead of doing that, I have, week
after week, created a staccato miasma of
disjointed thoughts desperately glued
together with a bagful of marginally
entertaining penis jokes.
I have failed to write one column I am
proud of, that I could show my parents
without shame. This is partially because I
always throw the word "breasts" in sev
eral times.

At least that's better than "velvety
cushions" or "mounds of pleasure."
That's the way I look at it. Mom sees dif
ferently.
It has been an entirely masochistic
project. I feed off the burden and hope
that this one week I will succeed, that I
won't have to avoid the person in the din
ing hall who is reading the paper. Week
after week, I allow opportunity to over
shadow failure.
A man with a purpose
But time itself is finally putting me
out of my misery, like a racehorse being
put out to stud. Yeah.
I don't want to go. Being fueled by a
hope which is never fulfilled is one of the
most beautiful ways to live, and the only
one I know.
So I must find something else to fail
in. Guitars are more expensive than I
thought and NASA requires a urine sam
ple. Not that I take drugs, or chemically
alter my DNA so that I'm brighter and
stronger than any other human being to
ever live. I just think urine is a very per
sonal thing. You understand.

I am going to miss this more than I
realize. And I don't know how long I can
go before I lose it and write a really long,
boring novel about New England prep
school boys gone wrong.
"Soliloquies in backstreets soon pall."
Guess I'll just find another use for
backstreets. God, how Jersey.

Joel Stein will make one final appear
ance in the Dead Week issue of The Daily,
when Joel's Hollywood friends will come
out to salute the departing columnist.
From the little, italicized voice that
always has to talk about columnists in
third person against his will, I say,
"Arrivederci, big guy."
