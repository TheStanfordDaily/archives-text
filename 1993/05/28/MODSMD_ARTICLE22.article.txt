## Scudamore confident heading into track NCAAs 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
At an early age, Dave Scud
amore had his sights set on
becoming the next Steve
Lundquist, a gold medal breast
stroker in the 1984 Olympic
Games.
As a fifth-year senior at Stan
ford now, Scudamore is closer
than ever to realizing his full
Olympic potential — not as a
swimmer, but as a distance run
ner.
"I was swimming competitive
ly for seven years before I acci
dently discovered running when
I was 14," Scudamore said. "I'm
a very competitive person who
likes to win, and I decided to go
with what I was good at, and
that just happened to be run
ning."
Scudamore was participating
in the Junior Guards lifeguard
program in the summer before
his freshman year of high school,
when he realized he was faster
on land than in the water.
After compiling a track record
of average performances in the
ocean swimming events, Scud
amore decided to switch to the
Junior Guards' version of a
biathlon, where he ran a half
mile, swam a half mile, and fin
ished by running another half
mile.
"I was doing really well in the
running sections, so I started
entering in the two-mile beach
runs," Scudamore said. "I com
peted in the 14- to 17-year-old
age group and I was beating
everyone else, so someone from
the high school asked me if I
wanted to go out for cross coun
try as a freshman the next year.
"Actually I wanted to swim
and do water polo in high
school," he continued. "But I've
always been a skinny freak, so it
made sense to try cross country
instead of water polo."
Before leaving high school,
Scudamore dropped swimming
entirely, in favor of running

away with three high-school Ail-
American titles and national
rankings in both the 3,000
meter and two-mile races. As a
tribute to his Junior Guard
days, however, Scudamore
returned to the beach and won
the national two-mile beach
races both in his sophomore and
junior years.

'My best time is only
10 to 15 seconds off
of the No. 1 guy, and
that's nothing in the
10K.'

After matriculating at Stan
ford, Scudamore proved his deci
sion to run was a good one, as he
qualified for the Junior World
Championships in the eight-kilo
meter race his freshman year.
"I had a tremendous fresh
man year, before suffering
through a sophomore slump,"
Scudamore said.
"I was trying to recover from
a stress fracture [sophomorel
year, but every year since, I
have been making big improve
ments."
As a senior last year, Scud
amore made his first-ever
appearance at the NCAA Track
and Field Championships, where
he squeaked out an llth-place
finish en route to earning All-
American honors in the 10K.
"I was actually just happy to
be there, because I missed an
entire month of training due to
an illness," Scudamore said.
"But this year, I'm in the best
shape I've ever been in, and I'm
ready to race."
Scudamore finished up his
four years of cross country eligi
bility last year, but since he red
shirted his freshman year of

track and field, he decided to
dedicate an entire year to track
as a fifth-year senior.
Besides highlighting his sea
son by gaining an NCAA provi
sional standard at the Penn
Relays, Scudamore placed sec
ond in the 10K at the Pacific 10
Conference finals, held in Berke
ley last weekend.
"I actually thought I had that
race sewn up," Scudamore said.
"But I made a couple of mental
mistakes and let Jimmy
Rodriguez (the eventual winner)
take the lead, unchallenged."
Despite that disappointment,
Scudamore will have a chance to
redeem himself by traveling to
this year's NCAA Champi
onships next week, as the No. 12
seed nation-wide. Like he did at
the Pac-lOs, Scudamore has his
sights set on striking gold, this
time in New Orleans.
"I don't want to be just a com
petitor, or just an Ail-American
there this year," he said. "I've
had an entire year to work for
this, and I want a big piece of the
10K.
"My best time is only 10 to 15
seconds off of the No. 1 guy, and
that's nothing in the 10K. I
think I can run with any of
them, and I can see myself as a
contender to win it all."
Regardless of what happens
next week, Scudamore has
already set higher goals for him
self to compete on the national,
and possibly the international,
level after graduation.
Leaving Stanford with a B.A.
in history and a B.S. in biological
sciences, Scudamore hopes to
return to his alma mater in the
fall, as a research assistant in a
biology laboratory. That way, he
can continue training in the
area.
"I need some way to support
myself, because I won't make
enough money off of running,"
Scudamore said. "You have to be
one of the top two or three run
ners in the nation to make
money in this sport. And I also

want to keep the other side of my
life going, because eventually I
plan to matriculate into medical
school."
Before the rest of his life plays
itself out, however, he will give
running his best shot, in prepa
ration for the 1996 U.S. Olympic
Trials.
Before taking that leap, Scud
amore will have to qualify to
compete in the U.S. Track and
Field Championships this sum
mer.
"That shouldn't be a prob
lem," Scudamore said. "You
need a 29:07 to get in, and I
already have a 29:20 race, which
I ran under less-than-perfect
conditions."
In order to be a national con
tender for the U.S. Olympic
team, however, Scudamore will
have to drop his time to at least
28:30 or 28:15 before 1996.
"I think right now I'm in sub
-29 shape because all my work
outs have indicated that," he
said. "Right now it's not realistic
to say that I'm going to make the
U.S. Olympic team, because it's
still early.
"In distance running, your
best years are in your late 20s
and early 30s. Last year, no col
legiate runner entered the 10K
or the marathon at the Olympic
Trials."
Scudamore, still in his early
20s, has a few years to go before
he reaches his peak. In the
meantime, he has turned his
attention towards his present
team as a veteran leader and
competitor.
Under coach Vin Lananna
this year, the team has found a
new direction, one that Scud
amore envies as a senior.
"I'm really jealous of the guys
who get to stick around next
year," he said. "I'm anxious to
see what happens next year,
because the Stanford track and
field and cross country teams
can do some big things really
soon.
"Everyone has a really good

attitude, because coach Lananna
has brought a good attitude to
the team. You can tell, because
people aren't just happy, they're
confident that this is the team of
the future."
CARDINAL NOTES: As of today,
Stanford has received three individ

ual invitations to the NCAA Cham
pionships. In addition to Scud
amore's qualification in the 10,000
meters, Louise Watson was selected
to compete in the 3,000 with a No.
10 ranking, and Jen McCormick will
enter the meet as the llth-ranked
javelin thrower.
