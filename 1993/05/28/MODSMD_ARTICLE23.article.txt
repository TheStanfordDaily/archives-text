INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) - Wayne
Gretzky's power-play goal 1:41 into
overtime led the Los Angeles Kings
over the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-4 on
Thursday night, forcing a seventh game
in the Campbell Conference final.
With seven seconds remaining on a
boarding penalty to Toronto's Glenn
Anderson, who was penalized with 13
seconds left in regulation, Gretzky took
a pass from Luc Robitaille and punched
in the puck for his 870 th career goal.
Gretzky's game-winner broke Gordie
Howe's NHL career goal-scoring record
for regular season and playoff games.
It was the fourth power-play goal of
the game for the Kings, equalling their
entire output in the first five games.
The overtime was the 25th of the play
offs, extending the league record.
The teams will play in Toronto on
Saturday night to decide who will meet

the Montreal Canadiens in the Stanley
Cup final.
It was the second straight game that
Los Angeles blew the lead after two
periods. Toronto's Wendel Clark com
pleted a hat trick with 1:21 remaining
to send the game into overtime tied at
4.
Robitaille broke out of a slump with
a goal and three assists.
"From the get-go, both of us had it
going," Gretzky said of himself and
Robitaille. "I had several chances to
score earlier and Robitaille was jump
ing into every play. He was the differ
ence in the game."
Robitaille's first goal of the series
capped three consecutive power-play
goals in the second period.
Los Angeles had scored only four
power-play goals on 27 opportunities in
five previous games against the Leafs.

Twice Los Angeles overcame one
goal deficits in front of a sellout crowd
of 16,005 fans at the Forum.
Marty McSorley, whose fights with
Toronto's Doug Gilmour marred the
first two games of the series, began the
power-play scoring at 8:00.
Tomas Sandstrom passed to a wide
open McSorley in the slot and he
punched the puck in from 25 feet away
to tie the game 2-2.
Rookie defenseman Darryl Sydor
gave Los Angeles its first lead on a slap
shot from the blue line that made it 3-2
at 10:22. Robitaille assisted on both
goals.
Robitaille had just one point in the
series and 13 points in 17 playoff games
before Thursday. His playoff slump was
especially frustrating for the left wing,
who set an NHL record for his position
with 63 regular-season goals.

Robitaille's power-play goal gave the
Kings a 4-2 lead at 16:37 of the second.
Game 6 began as another goaltend
ing battle between Toronto rookie Felix
Potvin and Kelly Hrudey of the Kings.
Los Angeles outshot the Leafs 13-8
in the first period, but had only one
goal after Potvin made a series of spec
tacular saves.
Toronto's Glenn Anderson started
the scoring 57 seconds into the game
when the Kings turned the puck over in
their zone and Anderson's shot
bounced off Alexei Zhitnik's left skate
for a 1-0 lead.
Anderson's 87th career playoff goal
tied Mark Messier of the New York
Rangers for third on the all-time list.
Anderson, who had the game-winning
goal Tuesday night in overtime, became
the fourth player in NHL history with
200 or more career playoff points.

Gilmour's assist on the play gave
him 31 points in the playoffs, three
more than Gretzky.
Tony Granato tied the game for the
Kings while caught in a massive pileup
in the crease midway through the first
period. The goal was not awarded until
after the video replay judge reviewed
the play several times.
The Leafs went up 2-1 to start the
second on a goal by Clark. Mike Foligno
passed down the middle and Clark
backhanded the puck past Hrudey's
shoulder.
Clark completed a hat trick with a
pair of third-period goals to send the
game into overtime tied at 4-4.
Clark beat Hrudey on a shot from 35
feet that tied the game with 1:21
remaining in regulation. Gilmour
found Clark with a centering pass in
the slot for the assist.
