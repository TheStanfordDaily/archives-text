# Adams, Lorraine enter major league draft
## 
### Amy Howard Editorial staff 
Finishing the season with a
less-than-desirable 27-28 record
— its first losing tally in 29 years
— the Stanford baseball team
would probably like to quietly
close the book on 1993 and start

looking ahead to next year.
But with the amateur free
agent draft taking place June 3
through 5, a few Stanford players
are still anxious to find out what
this year has in store for them.
Juniors Willie Adams and
Andrew Lorraine, the Cardinal's
star pitchers this season, are both

expected to trade in their Stanford
uniforms for major-league attire.
In the June 14 pre-draft issue
of Baseball America, Adams is
slated to go as the No. 20 pick
overall and the 13th pitching
choice. Lorraine is holding down
the No. 41 spot overall, and is
expected to be the 27th pitcher

taken.
Both players are draft veterans,
as Adams was offered a position
with the Detroit Tigers in 1990,
and Lorraine was also courted by
the New York Mets that year.
"I've really enjoyed my three
years here," Adams said. "You
never can tell what's going to hap
pen in the draft. I feel I've proven
I can pitch at this level, and I'm
ready to move on to the next
level."
Lorraine agreed with his team
mate. "I'm really excited, but I
don't know what to expect," he
said. "I just hope to go high
enough that I can leave here and
do well for myself financially."
Lorraine added that financial
considerations were not the only
ones that factored into his deci
sion to turn pro. "My goal has
always been to play in the Major
Leagues," he said. "I'd rather get
started now and get my feet wet
while I'm 20 years old than wait
another year."
This year's draft is heavily
laden with college pitching talent,
and it is projected that eight of the
first 11 picks will be hurlers.
Other Six-Pac players listed as
top-100 prospects include Arizona
State pitcher Marc Barcelo (No.
21), and UCLA's Ryan McGuire
(No. 39).
The Seattle Mariners have first
shot at the pool of talent, and they
are expected to settle on Darren
Dreifort, a right-handed pitcher
out of Wichita State.
The draft will be held by con
ference call out of the commission
er's office in New York, and most
teams are expected to select 50 to
70 players.
