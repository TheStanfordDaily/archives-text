# Exchange program sends students to Moscow State University
## 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Although the University's newest
overseas campus will open in Moscow this
fall, studying in the Russian capital is
nothing new for a handful of Stanford
students.
For the past three academic years, a
few students have had the opportunity to
participate in an exchange program with
Moscow State University. During the
exchange, Stanford students attend the
Russian university and are paired with
students there. Months later, the pair
comes to the United States to study
American culture and academics.
Senior Carrie McKay, who will attend
Moscow State in September, said she
liked the fact that she will be "thrown
into a foreign university and studying
with Russians in their own university."
McKay said the exchange program
allows more academic freedom than a
typical Stanford overseas program. In
addition, there is also freedom in how
students spend their time and choose
living arrangements, said McKay, who
plans to live in an apartment in

Moscow.
An international relations major who
is graduating in June, she plans to spend
six months in Russia studying and then
working. No stranger to Russia, McKay
spent last spring and summer in eastern
Siberia teaching English and working for
a business-consulting group.

The point is not to go and
lock yourself in the library.
The human element is the
most important.'

"Last time, I learned to speak Rus
sian," she said. "This time I want to
speak Russian correctly."
The students attend classes taught in
Russian at Moscow State, whereas Stan
ford's program consists of "an island of
Stanford in a foreign country," said
Nicholas Beim, the program's current
director.

Beim founded the Stanford-Moscow
Exchange program during the 1989-90
school year while he was studying at
Moscow State University.
It was "at a time when Americans
weren't there," Beim said. He organized
what was supposed to be a one-time
exchange in the months before the coup
in the former Soviet Union.
"I was exceedingly interested in the
political changes that were occurring in
Russia. I couldn't learn as much as I
wanted to here. The best way to learn was
to go there and study," said Beim, who
had worked in Moscow for several previ
ous summers.
While working one summer as a pro
duction assistant for "60 Minutes," he
met the dean of Moscow State Universi
ty's journalism school, with whom he
"cut a deal" that allowed him to attend
the school.
As an American student, Beim said he
was treated "like a czar" and given many
privileges and research opportunities.
In the year he spent there, Beim
worked on two independent research pro
jects. He first conducted a historical
study of the Kornilov Affair, an alleged

coup before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolu
tion. Kept secret by the Soviet govern
ment, details of the event have been diffi
cult for Western scholars to access, Beim
said.
His second project was a literary study
of the underground novel "The Master
and Margarita" by Mikhail Bulgakov. He
conducted his research with the aid of a
scholar on the author.
But Beim said research is of secondary
importance during the exchange. "The
primary objective is to create a bond
between the Russian and American stu
dents," Beim said.
Beim said his relationship with his
host, Natalia Stebletsova, made the stay
more personal. "She gave me a perspec
tive that I wouldn't have had, if I had
been alone or if I had just been with
American students," Beim said.
The two students are also connected
by a financial bond. With Moscow State
still a socialist university, the exchange is
cheap, Beim said. The Stanford students
pay only their air fare and $4,500, provid
ing for the Russian students' auditing
status and housing at Stanford. The
Stanford students are housed in a

Moscow State dormitory.
According to Beim, the coup made pos
sible a permanent exchange program, but
it also presented cost difficulties. With
the increase in travel to Russia, airline
ticket prices "skyrocketed ten-fold" and
Moscow State University could no longer
pay for the Russian students' travel
expenses.
But Beim took the problem into his
hands. Last November he ran in the New
York Marathon and, with the aid of spon
sors, raised $15,000 — enough money to
sustain the student-run program for a
few years.
Slavic Studies Prof. Richard Schup
bach recalled that the program began as a
"crazy idea."
"[Beim] talked about this idea he had
about establishing an exchange with
Moscow State University. Before, Stan
ford hadn't gone for the idea of foreign
students coming and using monopoly
money at Stanford," Schupbach said.
The program works because "it's com
munity oriented," Beim said. "The point
is not to go and lock yourself in the
library. The human element is the most
important."
