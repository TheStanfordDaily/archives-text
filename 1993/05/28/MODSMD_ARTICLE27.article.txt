# Diversions
## Those crazy honors theses 
### 
Ah, it's that time of the year —
the time when students are strug
gling to finish out their Stanford
careers by the completion and
presentation of their honors the
ses; the time when the culmina
tion of four years of sweat
wrenching work will be ripped
apart by the merciless claws of
professors who never really liked
you in the first place; the time
when — say it ain't so — CFV is a
sentimental daydream.
But don't fear, at Diversions
we care.
And never ones to be caught
behind the latest, hippest trends,
we at Diversions present to you
brief clips from honors projects
that we'd like to see.
Conversations with God: An
Encounter
Religious Studies
Many religions purport meth
ods to attain enlightenment. In
this paper I will describe how I
achieved a mystical state of
awareness and conversation with
God after ingesting of several
spotted mushrooms brewed into a
lovely tea.

Excerpts of this dialogue are
transcribed and translated into
Sanskrit and an ancient form of
Senegalese Braille.

Oftentimes the childhood
dream of growing up and becom
ing a fireman is shattered by a
cruel misrepresentation of reality
that is forced upon our young
minds. Nowhere in elementary or

econdary education are we
allowed to get a proper grip
on just exactly what it

akes to become one of
these important public
servants. Lost in the

midst of algebra, U.S.
History and Lan

idealistic hopefuls
are never properly
instructed on how to
attain this dream. As
a youth who himself
was caught in this
I torquing spiral, I

hope to enlight

who read

my thesis,

History of the Avant Garde
Drama
My dog is early. I cannot live in
a world full of peanut-brittle and
grandparents. Yesterday I wept
over a sandwich, but today I am
three.
Such is birth.
Such is destruction.
Such is a roll of quarters which
once saved my death from living.
All is bliss except when things
suck.
I hope to find an asparagus
tree.

What I was Thinking About
This Morning
Modern Thought and Literature
What could be more modern
than what has happened this
morning? Nothing, right? Oh,
well . . . except for what's going
on right now.
Anyway, this morning was
really interesting. I woke up,
brushed my teeth, had breakfast,
listened to the messages on my
machine (there where four —
Wow!) and read the paper. I even
flossed today!
But anyway, you would know
all this if you read my paper.
Social Interchange of Auto
eroticism: Coitus Telepho
nius
Human Biology
Abstract: An experiment was
conducted in which the penile
tumescence of adult males, ages
17 through 23, was measured
while they were exposed to vary
ing levels of recorded erotic teu
phone conversation. Subjects
were selected from a random
sample of Psychology 001 stu
dents.
Subjects were seated individu
ally in separate rooms, where
they were wired to the necessary
instruments. Measures were
taken of heart rate and breath
ing, in addition to penile blood

capacity during the time of expo
sure.
Varying degrees of eroticism
were labeled at masturbatorial,
high quality, soft porn, "is-it
warm-in-here?", PG-13, tepid,
Disney and Mom.

The Lost Art of Salad Dress
ing
French and Italian
In the day and age of fast
food, the abhorrence that the
salad has become demands a
return to the roots of what
salad-making is all about. This
paper, through an historical, lit
erary, culinary and linguistic
emphasis, seeks to re-establish
salad dressing as not only an
important necessity, but as an
art form.
Free samples will be included
with the four-course meal that I
have prepared for all those who
will be grading this project.
