# True confessions of a nookie-runner
## 
### 
Hi, my name is Raquel, and 1.. .I. . . make
nookie runs.
I make them a lot and I love 'em. I nookie here
and I nookie there — I just can't get enough
nookie.
To date, I have made eight nookie runs — all
the way to New York City. That is 48,000 miles,
$3,500 worth of airline tickets (damn I must be
good). Oh, and he came out here once.
But I do not have a problem. So there. (Yes, I
am about to write a column that is not about bit
terness, frat parties, lost love or sexual frustra
tion. . . OK, maybe a little sexual frustration).
I got a man and he lives in New York City.
Our story is long, way too complicated, a little
nauseating and it does include a few circus
tricks.
If you really must know, ask anyone who has
ever met me, because I am sure I have told them
the story at least 2.5 times — including stories on
how he sleeps like a bunny, has a cute little white
spot on the back of his neck, blah, blah, cutesy
blah, blah.
It is your basic girl meets boy, boy loses girl,
boy gets the girl back and a cushy job, and boy
flies girl out lots of times. Believe me, I am not
proud of this story. I am sickening and I disgust
myself, but dammit, I am good enough, smart
enough and at least one person likes me.
Now back to the task at hand. I have plenty of
reasons to be bitter. I live in a one room triple,
my P.O. Box is on the top shelf (I am a 5-foot-2
Texan — "everything is big in Texas" is a myth),
and, gasp, in two more words: BAD PERM. Fur
thermore, it takes me six hours to get to New
York and I put up with my share of phone-sex
comments.
Folks, I am here to tell you now, that in a one
room triple, phone sex does not happen — not
even ifyou are the quickest gun in the West. Yep,
not even one ounce of phone foreplay.

So yes, I am sexually frustrated.
I'll admit it, when Pete Hyuck's butt was
shaven I was disgusted, but it still turned me on.
Long showers with the right water pressure are
my salvation. And my personal favorite is walk
ing over a sewer grill on a cold morning and hav
ing the warm air blow up my skirt.
It is so bad that cycling down the bumpy hill
by Meyer Library and the spin cycle on the wash
o-matic are my ideas of safe sex. Don't knock it
— have you ever had a washing machine tell you
that you weren't communicating? I think not.
But ah, there is more to life than hot, pulsing,
throbbing, sultry E-mail.
Surviving a Long Distance Relationship is
easy: just enjoy the simple things in life, while
you wait for your next imported boff. For exam
ple, you know it's gonna be a bright sun-shiny
day when you catch a glimpse of a roller blader
tripping or when you meet a grad-student with
out visible nose hair.
This campus is filled with reasons to smile:
sitting in class next to someone who makes a
false farting noise in his seat — and making him
feel uncomfortable so that he will try to recreate
the sound the entire class period; taking solace in
the fact that you are not a Daily cartoonist.
Then there are the special treats: counting
how many times your professor says "Uhhh
mm," and presenting that number to him/her

after class; trying to predict which Post Office
Man will go crazy from the all that pressure; ask
ing an a capella group if they know the"I like big
butts" song (they hate that).
A good thing to remember is that if you find
someone you really like (even more than Pez®),
then who cares about the distance? Just think,
some things are worth waiting for, and most peo
ple will just end up with someone they really do
not like — but will cling to for dear life because
they are afraid of dying alone.
So, what's a few thousand miles if you are
truly in deep and unconditional like? It is better
than the alternative.
Don't get me wrong. I love a drunk-back
wards-baseball-hat-wearing, "Aren't you in
group comm?", "Have you met my brother,
Hung Lykabear?", grinding-my-pelvis-is-danc
ing-frat-boy as much as the next girl. But who
needs Mr. "I Have Nothing Else Better To Do"
when you have a soul mate, a few rolls of quar
ters for the wash-o-matic, and a Shower Mas
sage™ with an adjustable head?
Ixmg Distance Relationships are not that
hard. I used to think that I could never in a bazil
lion years survive a LDR. I also never thought
that I would ever find a man that makes my toes
curl, lets me win at Sega™, likes my perm, likes to
bump fuzzies to "Chariots of Fire," makes me
hotter than Texas Chili and always solves the
final Jeopardy round. He's a keeper.
Yes we like Pina Coladas, getting caught in
the rain. We like making love at midnight and
the taste of champagne...
.. . oh, sorry, I'm back now.
But even though the distance is far, and at
times it may get a little lonely, what it all comes
down to is this: in two weeks I'll be getting some
and you won't — neener, neener, neeeeener.
Oh, and some last words of wisdom: perms
are the work of the devil.

how many times your professor says "Uhhh
mm," and presenting that number to him/her

after class; trying to predict which Post Office
Man will go crazy from the all that pressure; ask
ing an a capella group if they know the"I like big
butts" song (they hate that).
A good thing to remember is that if you find
someone you really like (even more than Pez®),
then who cares about the distance? Just think,
some things are worth waiting for, and most peo
ple will just end up with someone they really do
not like — but will cling to for dear life because
they are afraid of dying alone.
So, what's a few thousand miles if you are
truly in deep and unconditional like? It is better
than the alternative.
Don't get me wrong. I love a drunk-back
wards-baseball-hat-wearing, "Aren't you in
group comm?", "Have you met my brother,
Hung Lykabear?", grinding-my-pelvis-is-danc
ing-frat-boy as much as the next girl. But who
needs Mr. "I Have Nothing Else Better To Do"
when you have a soul mate, a few rolls of quar
ters for the wash-o-matic, and a Shower Mas
sage™ with an adjustable head?
Ixmg Distance Relationships are not that
hard. I used to think that I could never in a bazil
lion years survive a LDR. I also never thought
that I would ever find a man that makes my toes
curl, lets me win at Sega™, likes my perm, likes to
bump fuzzies to "Chariots of Fire," makes me
hotter than Texas Chili and always solves the
final Jeopardy round. He's a keeper.
Yes we like Pina Coladas, getting caught in
the rain. We like making love at midnight and
the taste of champagne...
.. . oh, sorry, I'm back now.
But even though the distance is far, and at
times it may get a little lonely, what it all comes
down to is this: in two weeks I'll be getting some
and you won't — neener, neener, neeeeener.
Oh, and some last words of wisdom: perms
are the work of the devil.
