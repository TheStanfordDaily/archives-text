# 'Finding a compromise'
## Proposed conflict-of-interest policy commended, but Fac Sen expresses several reservations 
### Romesh Ratnesar Skip Schwartz Staff writers 
The Faculty Senate yesterday applaud
ed the spirit of the University's new con
flict-of-interest proposal but expressed
reservations about some of its specifics.
In particular, senators suggested that
the University Committee on Research,
which developed the proposal, reconsider
restrictions on the time spent by faculty
working outside of the University, and on
acceptance of corporate gift*,. Senators also
expressed concern about a requirement for
faculty to certify their compliance with
these rules.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, the chair of
the research committee, said the Universi
ty's current conflict-of-interest and com
mitment policy is "dated, saturated and
lacking." He said the new proposal is "edu
cating and consciousness-raising in na
ture."
"We were very cognizant that this pro

posal would be received by a bi-modal group
of critics, those who say the policy does not
go far enough, and those who say it goes too
far," he said. "We are trying to find a com
promise, a possible form of agreement."
The proposal will be revised and resub
mitted to the senate for approval next fall.
The draft policy outlines restrictions on
faculty involvement with other institu
tions and outside research, obligations to
maintain a "significant presence on cam
pus during quarters of active duty" and re
quirements that faculty "disclose spon
sored projects, gifts, inventions" and other
situations "which may have conflict of in
terest or commitment implications."
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni said the
proposal's stipulation that faculty certify
compliance with its regulations is "dis
tasteful" and added that the University
does not require its community to pledge
commitment to any other matter.
