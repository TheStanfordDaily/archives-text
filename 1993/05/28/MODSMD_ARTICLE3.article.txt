# 'Finding a compromise'
## Proposed conflict-of-interest policy commended, but Fac Sen expresses several reservations 
### Romesh Ratnesar Skip Schwartz Staff writers 
The Faculty Senate yesterday applaud
ed the spirit of the University's new con
flict-of-interest proposal but expressed
reservations about some of its specifics.
In particular, senators suggested that
the University Committee on Research,
which developed the proposal, reconsider
restrictions on the time spent by faculty
working outside of the University, and on
acceptance of corporate gift*,. Senators also
expressed concern about a requirement for
faculty to certify their compliance with
these rules.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, the chair of
the research committee, said the Universi
ty's current conflict-of-interest and com
mitment policy is "dated, saturated and
lacking." He said the new proposal is "edu
cating and consciousness-raising in na
ture."
"We were very cognizant that this pro

posal would be received by a bi-modal group
of critics, those who say the policy does not
go far enough, and those who say it goes too
far," he said. "We are trying to find a com
promise, a possible form of agreement."
The proposal will be revised and resub
mitted to the senate for approval next fall.
The draft policy outlines restrictions on
faculty involvement with other institu
tions and outside research, obligations to
maintain a "significant presence on cam
pus during quarters of active duty" and re
quirements that faculty "disclose spon
sored projects, gifts, inventions" and other
situations "which may have conflict of in
terest or commitment implications."
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni said the
proposal's stipulation that faculty certify
compliance with its regulations is "dis
tasteful" and added that the University
does not require its community to pledge
commitment to any other matter.
But Medical School Dean David Korn
said some type of "monitoring"
was necessary. "There cannot be
none at all," he said.
Other senate members asked
Heller to redefine the differences
between "conflict of interest" and
"conflict of commitment."
"We are undernourished on the
count of conflict of commitment,"
History Prof. David Kennedy said.
"Conflict of interest is a relatively
familiar concept to most of us, but
conflict of commitment is a rather
novel idea."
Psychology Prof. Amos Tver
sky said the committee should sep
arate "interest" and "commit
ment." A commitment to the Uni
versity should, by definition, pre
clude any conflicts, he added.
Some senate members ques
tioned the proposal's provisions
concerning professors' acceptance

of "gifts" from outside sources
that benefit from their research.
The proposal stipulates that "if a
faculty member has received spon
sored-project funding from any
entity proposing a gift to support
the same faculty member's Uni
versity activities," it must be
approved by the University.
Physics Prof. Steve Chu asked
whether the new policy would
restrict development on projects
that might bring financial gain to
the researcher.
Dean of Research Charles
Kruger said the new policy man
dates "disclosure, not prohibi
tion." Heller added that the pro
posal is primarily intended to
serve as a "trip-wire" for poten
tially unacceptable activities.
Kruger said yesterday's debate
was "helpful" and added he is
"generally happy with the com
mittee's recommendations as they
stand now."
In other senate business, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper

announced that the Irvine Foun
dation has given the University a
$1 million grant for the University
Committee on Minority Issues
and $400,000 for the newly
formed commission on undergrad
uate education.
The Planning and Policy Board
also released a report on its first
year's activities. It focused on the
board's discussion of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, "insti
tutional efficiency and planning"
and undergraduate education.
Board chair Arthur Bienen
stock said, "We believe it is impor
tant to understand how we spend
our money. ... This institution
must become more efficient."
Bienenstock said the board
will explore the financial viability
of the interdisciplinary majors
and of majors with very few stu
dents. It will also examine
"whether it is worthwhile to
establish committees to check
activities of every department of
this institution."
