Voices of Summer
By Diane Pearson
Crown Books 272 pp., $20
"Voices of Summer" is a
valentine to music lovers, the
kind of book one forces on one's
friends while mentally casting the
made-for-TV movie version.
This sophisticated soap opera
takes the reader backstage at a
struggling summer operetta festival
in the tiny Austrian village of
Hochhauscr. Though set in mod
ern-day Europe, "Voices of Sum
mer" has a decidedly old-world at
mosphere, both in the isolated

hamlet and in nearby Vienna,
where shadows of World War II
still linger.
Diane Pearson's lively plot
could have been lifted from one of
the company's frothy productions
— the frazzled direktor is run
ning out of time to find a leading
lady willing to work with his tem
peramental primo uomo, a melodi
ous megalomaniac determined to
upstage his hapless co-star.
Hometown hero Karl Gesner is
"the nastiest and most unpleasant
tenor in the business." With too
much ego and too little talent to
make it in the international opera
scene, Gesner is content to be
"the biggest, greenest and slimiest

frog in Hochhauser's tiny pool."
There, he can get away with
things like seducing chorus mem
bers and wearing full-length capes
in daylight, while enjoying the
adoration of his cuitish following.
"When Gesner walked on
stage one sensed the change in
the audience. The rich American
and British matrons flocked into
Hochhauscr season after season,
drawn by his strong sexuality and
his smouldering brown eyes (the
fact that they were rather too
close together was noted only by
the most discerning)."
Having scared off the first and
second strings of available sopra
nos, Gesner settles for Therese

Aschmann, an aging voice
teacher with a scandalous past.
Once hailed as the next Callas,
Aschmann hasn't appeared on
stage for years, thanks to a myste
rious disaster that befell her dur
ing a performance of "The Baron
of Luxembourg" — the very op
eretta she will perform in
Hochhauscr.
From the beginning, the com
pany seems poised for disaster —
a neurotic prima donna, an un
controllable star, a lovesick
choreographer, a new production
to rehearse and a rash of heart
problems among the manage
ment.
Originally published as a seri

al, "Voices of Summer" has more
twists than an Alpine bike path.
Will the washed-up soprano
overcome her stage fright to
make a dazzling comeback? Will
the lecherous leading man se
duce the unsuspecting ingenue?
Will the morose English designer
reveal her haunting secret? Will
the lonely cheese magnate find
true love at last?
The answer to all diese ques
tions is, of course, yes. Like a
good fairy talc — or operetta —
"Voices of Summer" takes stock
characters, predictable situations
and moral didacticism and con
jures up something magical and
redeeming. ■
