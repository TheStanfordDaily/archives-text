A gothic treasure hunt meets a thor
oughly modern mystery in "Wakefield
Hall," an intelligent, fiercely literary novel
by Francesca Stanfill.
After an ominous journey evoking
shades of both "Rebecca" and"The Shin
ing," Wall Street Journal reporter Flisa
bcth Rowan arrives at the titular estate, an
English-style manor in the Berkshires.
The intrepid arts correspondent has
been commissioned to write a biography of
its owner, famed thespian Joanna Fakins —
eccentric, neurotic and recently deceased.
In eerie anticipation of her premature
death and posthumous fame, Fakins has
left her biographer a trail of clues: mean
ingfully annotated books, an enigmatic
sonnet, a hidden cache of letters. Wake
field Hall itself is a kind of architectural au
tobiography, with its symbolic octagonal
rooms, gaudy gilded chapel and spooky
Shakespearean maze.
Standing in Elisabeth's way is a uni
formly suspicious cast of characters:
Fakins' latest husband, a Wall Street mag
nate; her caustic stepdaughter; her celebri
ty architect; and an assortment of theatri
cal cronies. Initially supportive of the
book, it soon becomes clear that each has
something damning to hide.
Although it is never suggested that
Fakins died of anything but natural caus
es, "Wakefield Hall" reads like a murder

mystery, complete with motives and red
herrings: an ambiguous will leaves the
property up for grabs, an ugly bruise
turns out to be the result of a riding acci
dent after all.
Through letters, interviews and jour
nals, Elisabeth slowly, suspcnscfully recon
structs the labyrinth of deceit and denial
that surrounded Eakins' life and work.
Like her protagonist, Stanfill has an eye
for detail and tends to dwell on it. De
scriptions of "towering spruces and hem
locks lending their blue-green to the
palette of the ravishing landscape" are a bit
overblown for a first-person narrative, but
this narrator is clearly no ordinary person.
After all, Elisabeth i i the kind of woman
who thinks in Latinisi. sand refers to her
lover as "my lover." But beneath her veneer
of indestructibility, she's lonely and dissat
isfied, "unsure whether to embrace or
dread the silence of her own apartment."
When we finally glimpse Elisabeth's tu
multuous private Life, however, it's too lit
tle too late: her mysterious heritage and
messy affairs just can't compete with Joan
na's soap-opera existence, though the par
allels are obvious.
Stanfill's attempts at gothic ambience
can be disorienting — it becomes difficult
to separate New England from England,
the 1990s from the 1890s. Personalities
and professions don't seem to match, and
certain inconsistencies seem careless rather
than deliberate.
But "Wakefield Hall" remains a cut above
the standard thriller, thanks to its unabashed
literariness and clever plotting. Weaving mys
tery, romance and poetry, Stanfill reworks
a timeless genre for modern times. ■
