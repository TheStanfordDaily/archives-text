Lower Than Angels: A Memoir of
War and Peace
By W.W. Windstaff
Enigma Books, 261 pp., $19.95
The year is 1929. You sit down
at a poker table with burly, beer
drinking World War I veterans.
They are eating peanuts and ex
changing stories of all the manly
things they did in the heyday of
their youth — all the enemy
planes they shot down, the alco
hol they drank and of course, the
many, many women they bed
ded.

One of these men, W.W. Wind
staff, takes a swig out of a flask,
spits and begins to tell his life
story, from the time of his first sex
ual experience at 15 until the pre
sent. He is now a 31-year-old,
washed-up alcoholic with only a

few years to live.
And there you have "Lower
Than Angels: A Memoir of War
and Peace," the hard-boiled 1929
autobiography of Windstaff — an
enigmatic soldier, playboy and
wanderer who wrote under a pseu
donym to avoid embarrassing his
socially prominent family.
In feet, Windstaff never intend
ed to publish his memoirs. Ac
cording to Stephen Longstreet,
the artist and writer friend of
WindstafFs who finally published
the work this year, Windstaff
wrote to shake the grip of alco
holism. It didn't work. The man
died two years after he finished his
memoir, in a drunk-driving acci
dent.
Nevertheless, the manuscript
survived its journey into obscurity
to be revived by Longstreet, in a
handsome edition illustrated with
the artist's own almost-childish
cartoon sketches from the same
period.
WindstafFs accounts are hard
edged and nearly devoid of eu
phemism. His frank, often foul
mouthed writing style punctuates
his rough-around-the-edges char
acter and provides comic relief as
well.
WindstafFs funniest recollec
tions are reserved for the catanker
ous grandfather who raised him:
M I told my grandfather I had fallen
off my bicycle, and he gave a long,
thin fart, like a note on a flute, and
said, 'We used to fall off horses.'"
Most striking are WindstafFs
brutally honest descriptions of
fighting as a British Air Force pilot
in World War I.
In the beginning of the book,
the bright-eyed youngster rushes
off to enlist right out of high
school, dreaming of "wearing
those tight, well-cut flying tunics,

the polished boots, carrying a
swagger stick and getting in bed
with beautiful English society
women."
Soon enough, Windstaff is ex
posed to such unpleasantries as
watching his comrades drop off
like flies during test flights, sub
sisting on brandy and milk and
throwing up all over his cockpit
during battles. Suddenly, the
glamour of war had been re
duced to the most horrific of re
alities.

Even though Windstaflf has a
rather successful career as a pilot
and is decorated several times,
he takes no joy in his heroic
deeds. Ironically, when he looks
back at the war, he can hardly re
member what his medals were
for and, frankly, doesn't care
anymore.
WindstafFs naive ideal of re
turning home "with just a slight

wound, a nice clean bandage
around my brow, leaning on a
cane" is shattered when he is shot
in combat and finds himself in a
hospital, contemplating the sex
lives of amputees.
But the protagonist keeps his
leg and his multi-multi-episodic
sex life continues though his fight
ing days are over. The reader soon
loses track of all the women he
beds and all the illegitimate chil
dren he fathers. His lustful ac
counts are humorous at best, but
more often shockingly sexist.
WindstafPs libido undergoes a
journey of its own, from his horny
jump-on-anything-that-walks
teen years; to his war days, when
his sexual desire nearly disappears;
to his later years, when he hangs
out with prostitutes and eccentric
women, having sex without seem
ing to enjoy it.
While WindstafFs sexual matu
ration does parallel his emotional
growth, his attitude toward
women never becomes very en
lightened. He never forms any
lasting relationships, ditching the
scene whenever commitment —
or pregnancy — rears its ugly
head.
Nevertheless, moments of sen
sitivity do shine through his
macho prose. One woman, Molly,
dies in an accident after Windstaff
has been seeing her for several
months. At first, he plays tough:
"I'd tell myself I wasn't really in
love with Moll. Just being in
London and needing a woman in
the kip."
But he soon admits he's fooling
himself: M I didn't carry Moll's pic
ture on my body, or any letters.
There were none. I've forgotten
her, but my dreams, even now,
don't seem to know that."
Unfortunately, such poignant

moments arc few and far between
in "Lower Than Angels," and
WindstafFs dry humor gets tire
some as all his accounts of getting
drunk and seducing women start
to sound alike.
Everything in WindstafFs life
was short-lived and fast-paced.
But the reader can't help being
disappointed that in the end, none

of it amounts to anything but a
burnt-out, cynical, alcoholic vet
eran.
Even Windstaff himself seems
to belittle his lifestyle: "What
counted most was the living, the
fucking, the drinking, and the
people involved. I hadn't played
the creative game — I was the
background."
But one cannot forget that
"Lower Than Angels" is a real ac
count of real life and its drawbacks
lie in the fact that life, unlike fic
tion, doesn't always hold any larg
er significance. ■
