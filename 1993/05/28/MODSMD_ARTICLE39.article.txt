The Elephant Vanishes
By Haruki Murakami
Alfred A. Knopf, 327 pp., $21
One glance and it's obvious
that Haruki Murakami's Japan is
no ordinary place. A world where
sad-faced monsters crawl from the
depths of the earth to propose
marriage to lonely housewives and
dancing dwarfs help average men
woo the women of their dreams,
the Japan depicted in"The Ele
phant Vanishes" — Murakami's
latest translated work — is a surre
aland sensitive place where noth
ing is what it seems.
The first short story collection
by the author hailed in Japan as the
"voice of a generation," u The Ele
phant Vanishes" explores such
themes as isolation, aimlessness and
disconnectedness which are symp
tomatic of modern society. Mu
rakami's characters are ordinary
people slowly sinking into middle
age, alone and collectively under

going a national mid-life crisis.
"When the hell did the com
pass needle get out of whack and
lead my life astray?" wonders a for
mer law clerk who has just quit his
job "for no particular reason." As
he sits stirring his coffee and run
ning over past mistakes, his
thoughts are echoed in a thousand
lonely kitchens and offices.
"There's all different kinds of
loneliness," explains a quiet busi
nessman. "There's the tragic lone
liness that tears at your nerves with
pain. And then there's the loneli
ness that isn't like that at all —
though in order to reach that
point, you've got to pare your
body down."
Murakami's pared-down char
acters arc all unwaveringly one-di
mensional and make perfect foils
for the strange events that occur
around them. These occurrences
— an incredible, inexplicable wind
storm, the disappearance of a
caged elephant and its keeper, un
expected television deliveries by
expressionless men in miniature —
are puzzling, disconcerting and

ultimately crucial to the charac
ters' lives.
"Something is wrong. Some
thing is wrong. But what? 1 can't

the compass needle

and lead my life
astray?'

tell. My mind is crammed full of
thick darkness. It's not taking
me anywhere," a woman muses
in "Sleep," a story in which
sleepless nights are a prelude to
death.
Obviously, Murakami loves
symbolism and tends to go over
board at times. It's then that his
stories begin to read like modern
fables with lessons like, "Be careful
for what you wish for — you

might just get it." But Murakami
avoids preachiness by dissecting
single human emotions and trans
forming seemingly trivial events
into ones packed with meaning
and self-realization.
In the story of a
shopping trip that ends in divorce,
a devoted mother and wife asks a
man to try on a pair of shorts as tai
lors adjust them for her husband.
"As Mother stood there look
ing at this man, so many things
she'd been uncertain about herself
slowly shifted together into some
thing clear," her daughter says
years later. "That's when she real
ized she hated Father."
Surprisingly, the best stories in
the collection arc those that don't
rely on the quirky circumstances
that make up the bulk of the book.
When Murakami describes the fa
miliar and recognizable, his writ
ing is powerful and undeniably
truthful. Bypassing sentimentality,
he writes about the decisions we
all must make and the price we pay
for those decisions.
In the most personal and lik

able story, a character remembers
his first love: "One beautiful April
morning, on a narrow side street
in Tokyo's fashionable Harajuku
neighborhood, I walk past the 100
percent perfect girl."
But as he ncars her, doubts
begin to erode his initial opti
mism. He walks by without saying
a word, realizing later that she was
the w lOO percent perfect girl for
him," he was the "100 percent
perfect boy for her" and he had let
her get away. "Forever," he sighs.
Although his setting is mod
ern-day Japan, Murakami writes
so naturally and so honestly that
his stories transcend both cultur
al and temporal boundaries sug
gesting that people in every place
and time are emotional cousins.
Whether writing about the sur
real or the mundane, Murakami is
a chronicler of human emotions.
In a world ruled by clocks and ma
chines, there is already more than
enough rationality to go around.
Perhaps, he suggests, we should all
think a little less and feel a little
more. ■
