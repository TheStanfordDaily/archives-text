# Art or obstacle?
## Sculpture prompts questions 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Graduate students living in Rains were surprised
to find that the University began erecting a new mod
ern-art sculpture in their backyard this month — one
that many consider an unnecessary obstruction.
The sculpture, designed by artist John RolofT, will
look like half a hill, constructed primarily of concrete,
containing an irrigation system for plants that will be
placed in it. It is intended to look as though "someone
has cut through the earth with fabricated stone that will
look wet," said Hilarie Faberman, curator of modern
and contemporary art at the Stanford Museum of Art.
But some residents complain that the artwork,
scheduled to be completed in July, is being built in the
middle of the largest open lawn in the Rains complex,
where they play frisbee, soccer and occasionally have
barbecues.
"So far it looks terrible and most people that I've
talked to don't like it," said second-year business stu
dent John Critelli. "I don't like where it is situated. I

definitely don't think we needed it."
George Light, a graduate resident assistant, said,
"People would have preferred (the sculpture] not to
be built on the one big grassy area we have."
Some students also say that the sculpture is a
waste of money.
The sculpture's total cost — including design and
construction —will total $140,000, said Mike Kuntz,
a Facilities assistant project manager.
The money will come from the General Plant Im
provement Fund, which sets aside money for items
such as above-ground artwork, street lights and
benches, said Glenn Carroll, manager of graduate
student housing.
Carroll added that the University planned to in
clude artwork in the Rains complex four or five years
ago and specifically set aside money for it. The sculp
ture's design was approved by a subcommittee of stu
dents, stafT and faculty.
But its construction was delayed by the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, the 7-year drought and a variety
of more pressing projects, Carroll said.
