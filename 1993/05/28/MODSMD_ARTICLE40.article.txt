Nouveau-noir myetery and crime writer
Lawrence 3\ock pushes the envelope of the
genre with "Some Days You Get the /3^r"

Lawrence Block has been compared to
every mystery writer from Edgar Allen Foe
to Raymond Chandler. The author of more
than 30 novels and four anthologies of
short stories, Block is prolific enough to match
either.
But the award-winning writer resists comparisons and labels,
writing on unconventional topics, confronting controversial
issues and pushing the limits of the mystery genre. His works,
including "When the Sacred Ginmill Closes" and "A Dance at
the Slaughterhouse," typically blur the boundaries of the typi
cal mystery or crime story.
"I think categorization is a matter of concern more to read
ers and librarians than to writers," Block explained. "I just start
to write without considering what category the story will fall
into."
And while Block writes in very diverse styles, he said the vari
ety should not astonish readers. "I find it more surprising that
other people don't express more than one side of themselves."
