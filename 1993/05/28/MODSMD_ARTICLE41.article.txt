For his third collcctdon of short sto
ries, "Some Days You Get the
Bear," Block deserves a plush teddy.
A potpourri of dynamic characters
enlivens a series of 21 tales about uncertain
truth and convoluted justice. In addition to
weaving tight webs of suspense, Block art
fully questions traditional scientific assump
tions about the human psyche.
A few of the selections in "Some Days
You Get the Bear" feature investigator
heroes 4 la "Spenser: For Hire." But
Block's best-known character, Matthew
Scudder, is anything but a typical private
eye. The subject of 10 previous novels and
several short stories, Scudder is an unli
censed ex-cop who's drawn into only the
most oudandish of cases.
In"The Merciful Angel of Death," one

of the stories in the anthology, Scudder
investigates a series of deaths in an AIDS
hospice, all of which seem linked to visits
from a beautiful woman. In a place where
death is an everyday occurrence, Block
looks at the tenuous relationship between
life and death.
Delving into the issue of euthanasia, the
story goes beyond asking "whodunit" and
instead questions when a person is psycho
logically ready to die and what constitutes
murder and suicide.
Another Scudder story, "By the Dawn's
Early Light," earned Block the Private Eye
Writer's Shamus Award and the Mystery
Writers of America's Edgar Allen Poe
Award. The story — included in the
anthology — deals with the murder of one
of Scudder's acquaintances.
What begins as a routine investigation
spirals into a whirlpool of questions and
cover-ups that leaves many innocent bodies
in its path before justice finally prevails.
"The series of novels that I've been
doing for some years now about Matthew
Scudder would probably be the work I
attach the most significance to," said Block,
adding that Scudder is one of his most
complex characters. A new Scudder novel,
"The Devil Knows You're Dead," will be
published in November.
In contrast to the street-smart Scudder,

Martin Ehrengraf, who appears in three of
the new stories, is an upscale lawyer wh 3
always finds himself keeping "innocent'
clients out of court.
"Life is too short for litigation," he
laments in"The Ehrengraf Alternative," a
story in which the dapper lawyer saves mod
ern-day damsel-in-distress Evelyn Throop
from the horrors of the American legal system
After being caught standing over the
body of her ex-lover, literally holding the
proverbial smoking gun, Throop hires
Ehrengraf to get her off at any cost. When
the only witness commits suicide, leaving a
note admitting her own guilt, it's just the
beginning of a series of twists and turns
which leave it unclear exactly who did and
did not commit murder.

While fiction is Block's favorite arena,
he has also written several nonac
tion books and articles and a writ
ing column in "Writer's Digest.'
However, Block said that he finds fic
tion the simpler and more enjoyable course.
"I'm very lazy about research and I'd much
rather make things up then look them up."
Although he has taught classes on writing at
both Antioch College and Hofstra University,
Block is no advocate of creative writing classes.
Instead, he recommends practice.
"I would say that at least on an under
graduate level, classes don't do any harm,"
he said. "At least for me, they have the r;al
value of making me budget some time for
writing, which is difficult."
Graduate programs, however, "don't
have much to do with writing," Block
believes. "They're seductive as something
to do, other than getting out into the real
world and making a living."
He advises aspiring authors to "follow
your own star, write what you want to
write and develop your own voice."
k lock's voice is especially evident in
L ■ stories written in a more psycho
} logical than suspcnsefiil vein. One
example is "Someday I*ll Plant
more Walnut Trees," the author's personal
favorite of the stories in Days You

Get the Bear" — and the only one he
failed to sell to a magazine.
The story focuses on domestic violence
and its psychological effect on its victims.
Definitely not a mystery, the story is w more
of a character piece," Block said.
"Cleveland in My Dreams" also
demonstrates Block's talent for psychologi
cal drama. In this tale, George Hackett is
plagued by exhausting dreams in which he
drives several hours to Cleveland each
night. After one psychiatrist fails to help
him, a second offers to ride along with him
to Cleveland, so he can sleep during the
trip home.
So the psychiatrist joins Hackett both in
the dream and on the road-trip, and the
problem is solved. Unfortunately, the same
treatment proves less successful for one of
Hackett's friends, who dreams that he is
forced to make love to three beautiful
women.
Deceptively lighthearted, the story ulti
mately leaves a chill somewhat like that left
by an Edgar Allen Poe story — a little
frightening and extremely eerie.
The title story, "Some Days You Get
the Bear," further probes the depths
of the human psyche, examining one
man's attachment to his teddy bear.
But perhaps more disturbing than the
story itself is Block's own experience with
bears. After reading the story aloud at a
mystery convention, a fan presented Block
with a stuffed bear.
"I called my wife and she asked, 'Is it a
white bear with a red bow tie?' And it was,"
Block said.
When the same thing happened at
another reading, Block hurried to phone his
wife.
"She said, 'This one's brown.' And it
was," he said. "So we have uncovered my
wife's psychic ability to tell bears apart
long-distance."
Like Block's bears, each of the stories in
"Some Days You Get the Bear" is unique,
and more bizarre than the one before. If
some didn't share characters, it would be
difficult to find any relationship between
the tales.
"Some of these stories are beer and
some are ale, and I leave it to you to sort
them out," Block writes in the anthology's
introduction. "I only hope none of them

have gone flat.
Be assured — they
still have plenty of fizz.
