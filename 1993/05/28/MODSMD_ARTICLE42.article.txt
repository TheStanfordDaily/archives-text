Edited by Gary Soto
Chronicle Books, 179 pp., $10.95
Reading a story in "Pieces of
the Heart," a new collection of
Chicano fiction, is like peeking in
side the doors of a magnificent
church. A breathtaking depth ap
pears, beautiful details pop into
view and, when the doors close,
the viewer is left yearning to see
more of that interior world.
So, too, the tales in this book
create vivid portraits of com
pelling worlds. The characters in
the book's 15 short stories pull
readers into their lives — in an av
erage of only 12 pages.
Part of a new wave of Chicano
fiction, "Pieces of the Heart"
highlights the work of writers
who first splashed their thoughts
across the page during the Chi
cano Movement of the '60s and
'70s.
Sandra Cisneros — author of
the anecdotal "House on Mango
Street" and one of today's most
successful Chicana writers — con
tributes a satirical story punctuat-

Ed by her eloquent, conversational
style. It takes the reader inside the
mind of a teenage girl who shocks
her family by losing her virginity
to a drifter, a man more than twice
her age who goes by an ancient
Aztec name.
"I thought about a lot of things
on the way home," the girl says
after their encounter. "I thought
about all the world and how sud
denly I became a part of history
and wondered if everyone on the
street, the sewing machine lady
and the panaderia saleswoman
and the woman with two kids sit
ting on the bus bench didn't all
know. Did I look any different?
Could they tell?
"We were all the same some
how, laughing behind our hands,
waiting the way all women wait, and
when we find out, we wonder why
the world and a million years made
such a big deal over nothing."
Most of the authors capture the
rhythm and beauty of natural
speech, especially of the occasion
al switching between English and
Spanish (a glossary provides Eng
lish translations). Only in a few
tales, such as Carlos Flores'
"Smcltcrtown," does the dialogue
sound contrived and forced.

Many of the stories leave the
reader with more questions than
answers. For example, in Daniel
Cano's "Somewhere Outside Due
Pho," a Chicano soldier with only
three months left in his tour of
duty in Vietnam inexplicably joins
the Viet Cong. What makes the
story interesting, though, is not
why the man switches sides, but
how his friends and fellow soldiers
react to his decision.
"I don't know how, but this
guy Pena understands that every
thing here means nothing," says
one soldier. "I've never met the
guy, but I've been thinking about
him and I've heard the stories.
Everybody's talking about him.
"I heard that Pena lives in San
Antonio, in some rat hole he can't
afford to buy because the bank
won't lend him the money. I
heard that in the summer when it
hits a hundred, him and his neigh
bors fry like goddamn chickens
because they can't afford air con
ditioning. So now they send him
here to fight for his country! What
a joke, man."
Editor Gary Soto points out that
most of the stories are not as overt
ly political as the fiction that came
out of the Chicano Movement. But

the coUection presents some un
flinching portraits of life in impov
erished Latino communities.
For example, in"The Pan
Birote," Edna Escamill poignandy
depicts a poor mother and her
three hungry children attending a
sweltering Mass to receive a hand
out of bread.
"Getting up and down and
kneeling and sitting, back and
forth, with rapidly beating hearts
and dry mouths, la gente tried
hard to concentrate on the holy
mass. Their stomachs rumbled like
freight trains and they coughed to
cover up that noise so the whole
church sounded like they had tu
berculosis."
Other stories focus on various
injustices — a mother of 10 faces
the slow death of her oldest child
(Mary Helen Ponce's "Enero"), a
young boy spends the summer sit
ting on the bench for a losing
baseball team (Danny Romero's
"Summer League"), a stalwart
construction worker endures the
jealous, racist jabs of his co-work
ers (Helena Maria Viramontes'
"The Jumping Bean").
But "Pieces of the Heart"
showcases a broad spectrum of
Chicano lives. From finely shaded

character studies to slice-of-life vi
gnettes, "the worlds of these sto
ries are not the expected," Soto
writes.
For example, in Diana Garcia's
unorthodox and charming "The
Flat of the Land," a woman forges
a spiritual relationship with the
mud flow that starts from a small
crack in the ground and eventual
ly threatens to take over the aban
doned New Mexico house she oc
cupies.
In Guy Garcia's Stephen King
ish "La Promesa," a middle-class
Mexican-American who has re
nounced his heritage heeds his late
grandmother's last request: to
journey to Mexico to uncover the
whereabouts of her nanny.
Jack Lopez's masterful "Easy
Time" deals with a man on the
eve of a 30-day jail sentence for
stealing a car. Carrying on a
shameful family tradition by
doing time, he ponders his past
and his future.
While Soto claims that the au
thors have "done their best over
the years to produce stories that
reflect a life they know and have
felt," the appeal of the works lies in
their universality. They give us
pieces of every heart. ■

won't lend him the money. I
heard that in the summer when it
hits a hundred, him and his neigh
bors fry like goddamn chickens
because they can't afford air con
ditioning. So now they send him
here to fight for his country! What
a joke, man."
Editor Gary Soto points out that
most of the stories are not as overt
ly political as the fiction that came
out of the Chicano Movement. But

the coUection presents some un
flinching portraits of life in impov
erished Latino communities.
For example, in"The Pan
Birote," Edna Escamill poignandy
depicts a poor mother and her
three hungry children attending a
sweltering Mass to receive a hand
out of bread.
"Getting up and down and
kneeling and sitting, back and
forth, with rapidly beating hearts
and dry mouths, la gente tried
hard to concentrate on the holy
mass. Their stomachs rumbled like
freight trains and they coughed to
cover up that noise so the whole
church sounded like they had tu
berculosis."
Other stories focus on various
injustices — a mother of 10 faces
the slow death of her oldest child
(Mary Helen Ponce's "Enero"), a
young boy spends the summer sit
ting on the bench for a losing
baseball team (Danny Romero's
"Summer League"), a stalwart
construction worker endures the
jealous, racist jabs of his co-work
ers (Helena Maria Viramontes'
"The Jumping Bean").
But "Pieces of the Heart"
showcases a broad spectrum of
Chicano lives. From finely shaded

character studies to slice-of-life vi
gnettes, "the worlds of these sto
ries are not the expected," Soto
writes.
For example, in Diana Garcia's
unorthodox and charming "The
Flat of the Land," a woman forges
a spiritual relationship with the
mud flow that starts from a small
crack in the ground and eventual
ly threatens to take over the aban
doned New Mexico house she oc
cupies.
In Guy Garcia's Stephen King
ish "La Promesa," a middle-class
Mexican-American who has re
nounced his heritage heeds his late
grandmother's last request: to
journey to Mexico to uncover the
whereabouts of her nanny.
Jack Lopez's masterful "Easy
Time" deals with a man on the
eve of a 30-day jail sentence for
stealing a car. Carrying on a
shameful family tradition by
doing time, he ponders his past
and his future.
While Soto claims that the au
thors have "done their best over
the years to produce stories that
reflect a life they know and have
felt," the appeal of the works lies in
their universality. They give us
pieces of every heart. ■
