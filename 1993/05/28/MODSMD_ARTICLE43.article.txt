Passionate Pilgrim: The Extraor
dinary Life of Alma Reed
By Antoinette May
Paragon House, 283 pp., $24.95
Alma Reed is the type of per
son you want to be like when you
grow up — phenomenal. In
"Passionate Pilgrim: The Extra
ordinary Life of Alma Reed," An
toinette May shows the rewards
and sacrifices that went along
with the journalist and adventur
er's long-neglected achieve
ments.
Reed was born in 1889 to a
small and struggling family in San
Francisco. Her father leapt at every
chance to make a quick buck, with
very little payback. Both of Reed's
parents were interested in books
and art and frequently took their
children to die M. H. dc Young
Museum in Golden Gate Park. But
times were tight and the children
kept coming. Reed, despite her
avid interest in schoolwork and
reading, was unable to attend col
lege.
However, as the reader soon
learns, nothing could slow Reed
down for long. Somehow, with no
prior experience, she convinced
the burly, cigar smoking editor of
the San Francisco Call to give her
a job. Reed turned her society
pieces about charity organizations
and meaningful causes into serious
forums for civil-rights discussion,
escalating with the dramatic —
and successful — push to lower
the state age requirement for capi
tal punishment.

May interestingly illuminates
the political clout and sense of
community that women of
Reed's generation shared.
Recently given the vote, these
women rallied together for wor
thy causes and shared a collective
consciousness of the importance
and potential power of their
votes.
With her voracious appetite
for travel and innovative stories,
Reed soon turned her gaze
south to the dangerous lands of
Mexico.
The Revolution was over, but
wild stories of Pancho Villa and
Kmiliano Zapata continued to
surface, startling naive gringos.
Reed's travels through Mexico
ignited a life-long passion for that
enigmatic and complex country,
which would eventually lead her
to report on the first excavations
of Chich6n Itza, the ancient
Mayan civilization in the Yucatan.
lliere, she met Felipe Carillo
Puerto, the bold governor who
fought for the civil rights of the
Mayan people, supported the bur
geoning feminista movement and
ultimately legalized divorce so he
and Reed could marry.
Tragically, though, Puerto's pol
itics proved too progressive for the
Mexican political climate of the
time. Before leaving to meet Reed
in the U.S., Puerto was assassinated
by a firing squad.
Desperately seeking some
kind of solace, Reed agreed to
every wild assignment she was of
fered. From deep sea searches for
Atlantis off the Tunisian coast to
studies of the Sibylline cult, Reed

immersed herself in a lonely kind
of carpe diem, living from one
day and one paycheck, to the
next.
The pages of her biography are
populated with the interesting
people Reed befriended through
out her travels — even our own
Ixrland Stanford makes an appear
ance alongside the more formida
ble likes of the Mexican muralist
Jose Clemente Orozco and the
Greek national poet of the 19205,
Angelo Sikelianos.
Reed finds herself in
New York, navigating the Depres
sion-era art and literary scene. Fi
nally, she ventures back to Mexico
City, where she hears once again
the haunting tune of "La Peregri
na n (or "the pilgrim"), which
Puerto commissioned especially
for Reed.
Unfortunatfcly, May — herself
a journalist and lover of Mexico —
fails to include any kind of factual
references except a brief list at the
end of the book. "Passionate Pil
grim" would be a much more in
teresting read if it included more
of Reed's own published and per
sonal writings and fewer of May's
conjectures as to what Reed was
thinking while, for example, rid
ing camcl-back towards North
Africa.
May docs a good job of making
Reed's story accessible, interweav
ing the myths and fables of unre
quited love, undaunted bravery
and doomed romance which fasci
nated her subject. Ultimately,
Reed's life shines through the so
so writing and gives this biography
life and importance. ■
