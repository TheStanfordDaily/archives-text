The Wolf and the Raven
By Diana Paxton
William Morrow, 320 pp., $21
Delve into the magic of
Valkyries and run with the wolves
in Diana Paxton's latest novel, a
complex but intriguing account of
two legendary figures and their
shared journey into love and
adulthood.
"The Wolf and the Raven,"
the first installment of a planned
trilogy based on the "Nibelun
genlied," attempts to humanize a
pair of mythic heroes — and suc
ceeds.
However, the book may be
more enjoyable — not to mention
more comprehensible — for those
familiar with Wagner's "Ring" op
eras or the Germanic tales them
selves.
For starters, there are the ex
tensive character lists, the family
trees, the nine-page glossary, the
maps of fifth-century Europe and
the rune chart. Distinguishing
between more than 100 charac
ters — including such tongue
twisters as Airmanareik, Her
mundurus, Hlodomar and Sin
tarfizilo — may leave readers
somewhat exhausted.
Feuding families and warring
tribes add to the confusion, but
politics are only part of the story.
The absorbing central plot focuses
on the origins and destinies of
Sigfrid and Brunahild.
Throughout most of the book,
the two characters lead separate
lives in alternate chapters. It's a
good thing, because die novel goes

downhill fast when they finally
meet.
Paxton portrays Brunahild as
a fifth-century feminist, a Hun
princess training to be a priestess.
As a student of the Valkyries,
here called the Walkyriun, she
learns sword fighting as well as
magic.
For a time, Brunahild lives a
quiet life among the wise-women,
learning to excel at herb lore and
other skills. One day, while on
hunt with her fellow students,
Brunahild becomes lost and en
counters the god Wodan in a cave.
There, she learns that being a
god's favored daughter isn't all it's
cracked up to be.
"Then you only want to use
me?" she asks.
"Do you expect me to love
you?" he replies. "To the ones I
love I am the most dangerous of
all.r
The novel's most interesting
scenes deal widi the rituals of the
Walkyriun and Brunahild's initia
tion into their sect. The battle se
quences, in which the priestesses
let out blood-curdling shrieks as
they descend on their enemies, are
somewhat unnerving but make a
good argument for allowing
women in combat.
"They were all shrieking, like
ravens, like wolves, like men in
their final agony," Paxton writes.
"Where die batde-hags passed,
men started up from their blan
kets, swearing, but diere were no
masters of magic among them to
make the nightmare flee."
Sigfrid is a slightly less excit
ing character, but his plight
evokes some sympathy. Son of
the heroic Sigmund, the boy is in

constant danger from his dead fa
ther's enemies.
The smith Ragan raises Sigfrid
out in the woods to keep him sale,
but has problems expressing affec
tion. So the child runs wild in the
woods, forming a kinship with the
local wolves. Sigfrid's yellow eyes
mark him as one of the "shape -
strong," humans who can trans
form themselves into animals, and
he soon takes to hunting in wolf
form.
Predictably, Sigfrid discovers
the secret of his parentage and in
herits his father's sword of god
forged steel. A rather reluctant
hero, he sets out with his foster fa
ther to kill another shape changer,
the dragon Fafner. Eventually,
Sigfrid's adventures lead him to
Brunahild and the novel takes a
disappointing turn.
After 16 chapters of indepen
dence, Brunahild suddenly needs
the protection of a mythic hero.
Swayed, perhaps, by the fact that
Sigfrid's "thigh muscles were
hard and sinewy," she makes it
her task to protect and serve her
man.
After minimal resistance, she
allows Sigfrid to sweet-talk her
into his bed. "Why not?" he ar
gues. "I know that you want
me. . . . When the queen wolf is
ready, she mates, and so will
you."
Despite minor problems, "The
Wolf and die Raven" is a revealing
glimpse into the minds of two leg
endary figures. Nevertheless, one
can only hope that the next two
novels in the trilogy will allow
Brunahild to reassert herself.
Maybe she'll rescue Sigfrid next
time. ■
