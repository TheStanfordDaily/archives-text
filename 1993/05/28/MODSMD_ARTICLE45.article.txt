They Still Shoot Models My Age
By Susan Moncur
Serpent's Tail, 114 pp., $12.99
We'd like to care about Susan
Moncur's problems, we really
would. But it's not easy to sympa
thize with a tall, thin, beautiful
woman's difficulty in getting back
into the modelling business — and
Moncur's not a good enough
writer to make us care.
Not that she's a bad writer. Her
autobiographical "They Still
Shoot Models My Age" is clear
and precise in a dear-diary kind of
way. But it presumes we're all
dying to sneak a peek at the day
to-day details of a former big-deal
'60s model's life.
If she had kept it at that, the
book might have worked as a tale
of a freewheeling, jet-set lifestyle.
But Moncur's a little more ambi
tious. In narrating her life story,
she also tries to make a point
about the myths and double
standards to which women must
conform in order to make it in
the world.

In a choppy and confusing
style, jumping back and forth
from the late '60s to the early
'80s and back, she describes
being pulled into the crazy
world of modelling by slimy
photographers and agents as a
teenager. She makes it for a few
years, gracing the cover of
Vogue and hanging out with Sal
vador Dali, but, now that she's
older, can't get modelling jobs
anymore.
Her point is made, but it
comes off as tired and cliched.
Everyone's heard this stuff" be
fore, and "They Still Shoot Mod
els My Age" doesn't give a new or
compelling twist to an old plot
line.
Not that Moncur doesn't try.
She tries hard. Too hard. "I felt
vertiginous with conflicting emo
tions," she says in one particularly
agonizing scene. Vertiginous?
Let's not alienate the readers,
Susan.
Cheesy aphorisms disguised as
deep thoughts arc another staple
in Moncur's book. "Failing in
America is about the worst thing
that can happen to you," she
writes.

So wrapped up is the author
in the way she tells her story —
using quotes from magazines
and a breezy writing style —
that she forgets about the story
itself.
Moncur uses a journal-entry
format which should have forced
her to be chronologically clear.
No such luck. Instead, she shifts
from the '50s to 1983 to the '70s
back to the '60s in such an arbi
trary way that all we get is a col
lection of random scenes and dis
jointed thoughts.
It's too bad that Moncur isn't
more coherent, because some of
the situations she describes —
such as convincing herself that she
has to have sex with animals in
order to get a modelling job —
could be very powerful if linked
together in a story.
She ends "They Still Shoot
Models My Age" with a quote
from a magazine that is supposed
to Anally hammer in her point:
"Brown hair, clear eyes, Susan is
American. Thirty-six years old,
five foot nine. According to pre
sent criteria, she is too old and
too short." It's too bad she can't
make it as a writer, either. ■
