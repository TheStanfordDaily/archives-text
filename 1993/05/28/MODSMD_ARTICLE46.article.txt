Play Ball: The Life and Troubled Times of
Major league Baseball
By John Feinstein
Villard Books, 425 pp., $22.50
Is baseball falling apart at the seams?
Well, it depends on whether you judge a
book by its cover or its text. Though John
Feinstein's latest effort, "Play Ball,*' is
gloomily subtitled "The Life and Troubled
Times of Major League Baseball," it de
scribes a game in which the owners' mone
tary woes are overshadowed by the joy the
players, managers and, yes, fans derive from
the sport.
In "Play Ball," Feinstein assembles a large
collection of uniformly interesting and re
vealing vignettes involving people at all lev
els of the game: managers, umpires, players,
owners, executives, announcers — even
mascots.
These tales are woven together in the fab
ric of the 1992 season, beginning with
spring training and culminating in the
Toronto Blue Jays' first-ever World Series
victory. In Feinstein's hands, they provide a
far more insightful description of many
facets of the game than have been provided
in other, similar works.
Because other authors have approached
baseball from either a single point of view or
an eclectic range of perspectives, their books
inevitably come across as self-serving (in the
case of biographies) or disjointed (in the case
of anthologies).
Presenting a series of unrelated experi
ences that inevitably coincide and inter
sect in the course of the year, Feinstein
finds an ideal route to explore the intrica
cies of the game. "Play Ball" is perhaps the
most ambitious of any book on the sub
ject: it not only describes the game, but
defines it.
The author has clearly done his re
search. The meticulous detail found in his
earlier books, "Forevers' Team" and "A
Season Inside," reappears in "Play Ball."

Feinstein even explores the career of that
loveable (or excruciatingly annoying, de
pending on your point of view) mascot,
the Phillie Phanatic.
The book's main focus is the dichotomy
between the financial and sporting interests
inherent in the game. But while the damag
ing repercussions of the contract battles of
stars like Kirby Puckett and Cal Ripken are
fully addressed, as are the fiscal woes of sev
eral owners, the "troubled times" pro
claimed in the title are only marginally real
ized in the text.
Instead, Feinstein describes healthy
franchises such as the Baltimore Orioles
and Toronto Blue Jays. Even the hardest
struggling owners seem optimistic. The
only ominous financial aspect of major
league baseball today involves the bizarre
vagaries of the free-agent system, which
have left Rickey Henderson bawling that,
at $3 million a year, he is underpaid by
today's standards.
While Feinstein's eye for detail is at once
impressive and illuminating, he short-cir
cuits many of his arguments by inserting sev
eral of his own unsubstantiated judgements
and opinions into the book.
For example, he declares, "The simple
fact is that [Tim] McCarver is the best ana
lyst in the history of the sport." Why? Fein
stein never presents any particularly convinc
ing evidence to this end. But these solilo
quies are only minor distractions and arc es
sentially lost in the book's engrossing flood
of facts.
Baseball has been described as an ac
quired taste, and 20 pages about Jim Ley
land's experiences as a manager and how
they have enabled him to successfully call
pitchouts may comprise rather dry reading
for some.
But for baseball junkies, whose pulses
quicken as the pennant race winds down to
its fall conclusion, "Play Ball" is a grab-bag
of fascinating, behind-the-scenes informa
tion. Along with "Veeck as in Wreck" and
"The Glory of Their Times," "Play Ball" is
one of the most illuminating and revealing
discussions of the workings of baseball. ■
