Sometimes Ton See It Coming
By Kevin Baker
Crown Books, 326 pp., $20
For those of us who collected
one hit in two years of Little
League, dreams of glory on the di
amond were short-lived. Well, al
most. We still had caps, mitts and
the backyard, and many an empty
summer afternoon was filled by
acting out our own games, playing
the parts of our heroes. Since then,
most of us have grown up. The
rest write baseball novels.
That is not to say there hasn't
been some damn fine art born of
diis youthful nostalgia. Books like
Bernard Malamud's "The Natur
al" and W.P. Kinsclla's "Shoeless
Joe" were undisputed American
classics even before they were ani
mated by Robert Redford and
Kevin Costner, respectively.
But, too often, baseball writers

can't transcend their fond memo
ries of boyhood, leaving readers to
slog through sentimental depic
tions that have long since become
trite. Unfortunately, Kevin
Baker's first novel, "Sometimes
You See It Coming," falls into that
pothole.
The book centers on John Barr,
a fictional New York Mcts super
star rightficldcr. Barr has all the
makings of a classic baseball hero:
a prodigious talent up from the
Massachusetts wtxxis, an instant
phenom in the minor leagues and
the top of the sport in the majors.
He's not just the top in his own
time or in a specific area, but the
best ever in running, hitting and
fielding. And, of course, he is la
conic, abstemious and takes extra
batting practice.
But just as the sun begins to set
on Barr's illustrious career, the
Mcts hire an ccccntric new manag
er, known as The Little Maniac.
Though the Mets sail to the pen
nant, cracks begin to appear in the

ship as tensions mount between
the manager and his players.
Worse, Barr, slips into the first
slump of his career, haunted by the
death of his mother and the mem
ory of his father's murder. With in
creasing dramatic effect, Baker dri
ves the story towards the revela
tion of the hero's secret past and
the Mets' last World Scries hurrah.
Unfortunately, it's hard for the
reader to care about either. Barr,
for one thing, is plain boring — just
another one of the baseball cliches
that pervade Baker's prose. In one
minor league game, for example,
Barr hits mythic home runs that
knock over all three records in the
giant jukebox beyond ccnterfield.
loiter, in his climactic final at
bat in the World Series, Barr
breaks his bat while fouling off a
pitch, grabs another one and
smacks a home run, all in painfully
"Natural"-csquc fashion.
Baker spices up his story with
the piquant narration of Old Swiz
zlehead, Barr's longtime team

mate who, together with the sassy
reporter Ellie Jay, attempt to un
cover the mystery of Barr's funk.
Although the two are easily the
most interesting characters in the
novel, they as transparent and for
mulaic as the others.
Swizzlehead is the stereotypical
fast, jovial black leadoff man who
makes snap catches, violates dress
codes and loosely chalks up The
Little Maniac's managerial mis
takes to the fact that he is white.
Ellic Jay is the proverbial woman
in a man's world, though she does
not, Swizzlehead maintains, know
what really goes on in baseball.
What docs really go on? Ac
cording to Swizzlehead, mostly
sex: sex in spring training, on the
road and, in one engaging scene,
in the Mets' bullpen. Yet such at
tempts at humor invariably fall
short, as do the cutesy monikers
attached to almost every single
character. The reader's sensibili
ties are so deadened by frivolous
baseball minutiae that the far more

compelling and ostensibly more
important saga of Barr's personal
struggle with his past lacks power.
Likewise, the love story that devel
ops between Barr and Ellie Jay is
largely predictable and ultimately
irrelevant to the novel's outcome.
In the author's note, Baker
writes that the book is "for my fa
ther and myself. . . . When we
could no longer perform the
painful, awkward dance around
each other, we fled to the clearer,
more comforting world of the
ballpark."
If only the genuine warmth of
that sentiment could be better re
alized, rather than obscured by the
author's irrepressible passion for
the game. Too overwrought for
non-fans, too pandering for
dichards, the novel seems more
suited for sexually advanced ado
lescents. In the end, "Sometimes
You See It Coming'' strikes out
because, for most baseball fans,
there is nothing quite like the real
thing. ■
