The Bachelor Home Companion:
A Practical Guide to Keeping
House Like A Pig
By P.J. O'Rourke
Atlantic Monthly Press, 147 pp., $16
Being a funny conservative is
not easy. Of the modern speci
mens, only Alex P. Keaton and
P.J. O'Rourke seem to pull it off.
As Rolling Stone's ambassador
to angrv young Republicans,
O'Rourke has become so hot over
the last decade that he can re-re
lease a badly-written book that
flopped in 1986.
For those who can stomach the
introduction — one of the most
offensive pieces of literature since
the last Guns 'n' Roses album —
the actual book is pretty thin. In
fact, there are fewer words in the
147 pages of "The Bachelor
Home Companion: A Practical
Guide to Keeping House Like A

Pig" than there are in some of
Faulkner's sentences.
"There are things in this book
which I wouldn't be allowed to
say nowadays," O'Rourke says in
the introduction. He goes on to
say things he wouldn't have been
allowed to say in the Middle
Ages.
"A big vote of thanks to you
too, Magic Johnson. Sure, if you're
getting laid eight or 10 million
times, you're bound to encounter
'the crack of doom.' For us regular
guys who get lucky about once
each time the planet Neptune re
volves around the sun, however,
Magic, you pissed in the soup."
Ow.
Unlike O'Rourke's testi
monies on Washington politics
("Parliament of Whores" is a
great read), "The Bachelor Home
Companion" has nothing new to
add to conversations. O'Rourke
makes the same old bachelor jokes
about keeping the place a mess,
sleeping with your dog, drinking

heavily and treating women like,
well, like women on Guns 'n'
Roses albums.
The few jokes that actually
work aren't subtle or complex, but
cleverly constructed logic prob
lems — O'Rourke's forte.
"The dustballs under the bed
— just let them accumulate. You
may start living with a woman.
And she may cheat on you. And
you may come home unexpected
ly. And the other man may hide
under the bed. And you'll be able
to find him when he sneezes be
cause of all the dustballs. This
sounds farfetched, I know. But it
beats crawling around on your
belly with a dustpan."
This kind of humor makes for
scathing political commentary,
but only an amusing thought
when discussing housecleaning.
Alex P. Keaton was cute when
he talked about women because of
his naive and approachable inex
perience.
P.J. O'Rourke is married. ■
