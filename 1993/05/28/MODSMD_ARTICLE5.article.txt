# Faculty-student relationships present regulatory difficulties
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Attracted to her instructor, Laurie
Bloomgarden waited for the quarter to
end before attempting to transform the
friendship into something more.
The ensuing relationship also figured
into her decision not to take a class from
Computer Science Lecturer Nick Par
lante the next year, auditing it instead. "I

like to know that the way I'm being grad
ed is for the work I'm doing," she said.
When Bloomgarden, Class of '92,
asked him out, Parlante considered the
ethical questions and decided to go for it.
"The position could be abusive," he said
of romances between faculty and stu
dents. "But it's also possible to have a re
lationship that's just fine."
Abuse of power is the first possibility
that bothers university administrators

across the countiy as they consider
whether to ban what are termed "con
sensual relationships" between students
and their academic supervisors.
Interest in regulating such campus ro
mances has been growing in recent
months, according to Lesley Francis, as
sociate secretary for the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. But in
few instances has such interest resulted
in official policy.

"Most (universities) have sexual ha
rassment policies. Very few have policies
on consensual sexual relationships," said
Francis, who added that the ethical con
siderations are nothing new.
"The issue's been around since Adam
and Eve," she said.
Sixteen to 18 percent of graduate and
undergraduate students nationwide
have had at least one sexual relationship
with a teaching assistant or faculty mem

ber, according to Fran Gibson, coordina
tor of Stanford's Sexual Assault Infor
mation and Resource Center.
Such numbers are beginning to arouse
the interest of policy makers and stu
dents alike.
'The Big Sister plan*
When the University of Virginia con
sidered banning ail sexual relationships
between faculty and students last month,
it drew a storm of criticism and focused a
national spotlight on the issue.
Television crews flocked to the campus,
and USA Today founder A 1 Neuharth
blasted "faculty feminists" in an editorial
denouncing the proposed policy.
"The Big Sister plan would ban 'all
romantic or sexual overtures,' " Neuharth
wrote. "A smile? A wink? Conversation
over a cup of coffee? Such trysts as a cam
pus stroll?"
Virginia eventually rejected the blanket
ban in favor of a milder policy — which
must still be approved by the school's
Board of Visitors — but debate continues
on many other campuses.
A faculty member may not "engage in
amorous or sexual relations with, or make
amorous or sexual overtures to, any student
over whom he or she holds a position of
authority," Virginia's revised policy reads in
part. It defines "faculty" as teaching assis
tants, graders, coaches and professors.
Despite the renewed interest recently,
the first policy on faculty-student
romances was adopted by Harvard Univer
sity in 1984. The University of lowa fol
lowed suit in 1986. Both schools forbid fac
ulty members and TAs to have relation
ships with the students whose work they
supervise.
'Hard to outlaw love'
At Stanford, members of the work
group drafting the sexual harassment poli
cy — which awaits approval from the Uni
versity Cabinet — say there was little dis
sent over whether to regulate romances.
The proposed policy contains two para
graphs on consensual relationships —
including a word of caution that such dal
liances carry "special risks."
The relationships may "be less consen
sual than the individual whose position
confers power believes, because of the com
plex and subtle effects of that power," the
draft states.
It adds that although the University has
no formal policy prohibiting trysts between

students, faculty or staff, the Stanford
community should be aware that uneven
power relations could lead to complaints of
harassment or unfair advantages.
Although the draft urges caution and
says of faculty-student romance that "it's a
precarious situation, it's not optimal,"
work group member Susan Hoerger added
that the statement is just a warning.
"It is not saying that love does not exist
in these relationships," she said. "And it's
hard to outlaw love."
University administrator Barbara But
terfield, another policy author, agreed. "In
a word, how would one monitor it?" she
asked. "I think it's really difficult to ban
something you cannot monitor or control."
Work group member Tom Matteoli said
he has received "some comments (which
have) suggested that the section on con
sensual relationships should be stronger
than it is" but knows of no discussion on
creating a stricter policy.
Most universities with policies on the
issue don't prohibit relationships as long as
the faculty member is not teaching or grad
ing the student.
Parlante agrees that a relationship with
someone in a class he teaches would be
"really unacceptable." But Bloomgarden,
whom he went on to date for about nine
months, was no longer under his supervi
sion once the class ended.
"It's just a judgment call of whether to
cross the line," Parlante said. And if he is in
a situation where a student is flirting with
him, Parlante said he will "just ignore it."
Bloomgarden, who graduated last win
ter quarter, said she definitely considered
possible complications. "I think if I'd been
in the department and had contact with
him on a regular basis, it would have been
uncomfortable," she said.
But because Parlante, at 26, is only a
few years older than Bloomgarden — "He
was a senior when I was a frosh," she said
— she was able to see him as a romantic
possibility.
"Most of my professors are a lot older,"
she said. "A relationship would never be an
issue."
Bloomgarden said a policy warning
against trysts with faculty members would

not have changed her mind about dating
Parlante. Parlante also said he would
oppose rules forbidding such a relation
ship, likening such regulations to banning
alcohol to prevent alcoholism.
Kent Willis, director of the Virginia
ACLU, agreed. The policies are "misdirect
ed" because they are aimed at preventing
relationships rather than punishing sexual
harassment, he said. "They are simply
shooting at the wrong target."
Willis said he has read many of the poli
cies. "They run from wrong to very
wrong," he said, adding that regulating
relationships violates Constitutional rights
of privacy and free association.
4 A sticky issue'
The conflict between protecting women
from exploitation and preserving personal
freedom leaves many feminists puzzling
over a solution.
"It's really just a sticky issue," said
Rebecca Bliss, coordinator of the Stanford
Women's Center. "Certainly I don't think
these relationships are wise or recom
mended."
But the potential for problems isn't
enough to convince her to support restric
tions. "I don't feel that on a possibility the
University can choose to make a law about
what people do on their own time," Bliss said.
An across-the-board condemnation is
especially difficult, she added. "You could
have a biology professor dating a history
grad student. What's wrong with that?"
When the relationship involves an
instructor and a student in his or her class,
however, the situation can get more com
plicated.
Diana Akiyama, an associate dean of
Memorial Church, said she is aware of
"cases in which a TA uses, either con
sciously or unconsciously, his power as a
TA" to ask out or get dates with female
students in his class.
Even in a mutually desired relationship,
Akiyama asked, "How much of the attrac
tion is actually influenced by the power
imbalance?"
Hoerger cited two possible complaints
that could arise from a romance with a
supervisor. First, there may be charges of

unfair treatment where someone says, "I'm
in a relationship with my boss and I don't
get a pay raise .. . and I think it's because
our relationship is starting to sour."
Sexual involvements could also raise
concerns about special treatment, Hoerger
said, using the example of a third party who
says "you got an A because you are the TA's
'friend' and I got a B because I'm not."
Work group members say they never
looked into whether consensual relation
ships are a concern at Stanford. "It was not
drafted in response to any reported or per
ceived problem," Hoerger said.
They did, however, investigate policies
at universities and companies around the
country. At Tufts University, for example,
the policy forbids faculty to date students
they teach.
A strong advocate of such rules, Tufts
Provost Sol Gittleman drafted the policy
himself. Concern with possible coercion or
the perception of unfairness prompted the
policy, Gittleman said.
"A faculty member could say, 'Love me
or I'll give you a C.' "
Fellow students may feel that the grad
ing system is corrupt if the professor walks
out of a class holding hands with a student,
he added.
Still, he said, relationships with stu
dents not under the faculty member's
influence are legitimate. "If it's a professor
of classics wanting to date a veterinary stu
dent, that's fine."
Most of the few schools with such poli
cies have enacted similar rules, but
Amherst College settled on an unusual pol
icy in March when they said faculty mem
bers who become sexually involved with a
student must remove themselves from any
supervisory role.
The policy was adopted only after the
faculty rejected a call from the president to
prohibit the relationships outright.
"There are students and there are facul
ty who believe that sexual relationships
between students are part of the academic
experience," History Prof. Francis Cou
vares, a member of the committee that
drafted the ban, told the campus newspa
per. "The issue is not going to go away."
A proposal that would have forced facul

ty to report sexual liaisons to one of the
school's deans also drew an overwhelming
ly negative reaction.
Relationships not uncommon
Whether or not they contain an element
of harassment, relationships between stu
dents and their academic supervisors are
nothing new.
Gittleman is convinced that faculty-stu
dent romances are quite common, especial
ly at "little isolated schools where faculty
live on campus and there's nothing else to
do."
At research universities like Stanford,
he said, the relationships are likely to
spring up between professors and graduate
students with whom they work closely.
"Anybody who says it doesn't happen is
not leveling with you," Gittleman added.
Butterfield agreed. "I would be naive to
say there aren't couples today that were (at
one time) students and faculty," she said.
Especially with TAs and undergradu
ates who are close to the same age, class
room situations can easily breed romance.
Warnings against dating, however, are a
departmental prerogative rather than a
University-wide policy.
"I know some departments actively dis
courage dating or relationships between
TAs and students they are teaching," said
Michelle Marincovich, director of the Cen
ter for Teaching and Learning.
The issue came up last fall at a freshman
Orientation program called "Sex in the
'905," according to Caroline Mitchell, the
sexual assault prevention outreach educa
tor. One skit portrayed a woman trying to
get help from a TA when he makes a pass.
When he threatens her with a low
grade, Mitchell said, the woman says she'll
tell the professor. As she walked out on
him, the audience cheered her assertive
ness.
With resident assistants, too, there can
be concern over relationships with those in
their dormitories. "We don't have a poli
cy," said Ann Porteus, associate director of
Residential Education. "We ask RAs to be
considerate in their relationships.... Our
philosophy is that we want RAs to be avail
able to all residents."

A strong advocate of such rules, Tufts
Provost Sol Gittleman drafted the policy
himself. Concern with possible coercion or
the perception of unfairness prompted the
policy, Gittleman said.
"A faculty member could say, 'Love me
or I'll give you a C.' "
Fellow students may feel that the grad
ing system is corrupt if the professor walks
out of a class holding hands with a student,
he added.
Still, he said, relationships with stu
dents not under the faculty member's
influence are legitimate. "If it's a professor
of classics wanting to date a veterinary stu
dent, that's fine."
Most of the few schools with such poli
cies have enacted similar rules, but
Amherst College settled on an unusual pol
icy in March when they said faculty mem
bers who become sexually involved with a
student must remove themselves from any
supervisory role.
The policy was adopted only after the
faculty rejected a call from the president to
prohibit the relationships outright.
"There are students and there are facul
ty who believe that sexual relationships
between students are part of the academic
experience," History Prof. Francis Cou
vares, a member of the committee that
drafted the ban, told the campus newspa
per. "The issue is not going to go away."
A proposal that would have forced facul

ty to report sexual liaisons to one of the
school's deans also drew an overwhelming
ly negative reaction.
Relationships not uncommon
Whether or not they contain an element
of harassment, relationships between stu
dents and their academic supervisors are
nothing new.
Gittleman is convinced that faculty-stu
dent romances are quite common, especial
ly at "little isolated schools where faculty
live on campus and there's nothing else to
do."
At research universities like Stanford,
he said, the relationships are likely to
spring up between professors and graduate
students with whom they work closely.
"Anybody who says it doesn't happen is
not leveling with you," Gittleman added.
Butterfield agreed. "I would be naive to
say there aren't couples today that were (at
one time) students and faculty," she said.
Especially with TAs and undergradu
ates who are close to the same age, class
room situations can easily breed romance.
Warnings against dating, however, are a
departmental prerogative rather than a
University-wide policy.
"I know some departments actively dis
courage dating or relationships between
TAs and students they are teaching," said
Michelle Marincovich, director of the Cen
ter for Teaching and Learning.
The issue came up last fall at a freshman
Orientation program called "Sex in the
'905," according to Caroline Mitchell, the
sexual assault prevention outreach educa
tor. One skit portrayed a woman trying to
get help from a TA when he makes a pass.
When he threatens her with a low
grade, Mitchell said, the woman says she'll
tell the professor. As she walked out on
him, the audience cheered her assertive
ness.
With resident assistants, too, there can
be concern over relationships with those in
their dormitories. "We don't have a poli
cy," said Ann Porteus, associate director of
Residential Education. "We ask RAs to be
considerate in their relationships.... Our
philosophy is that we want RAs to be avail
able to all residents."
Attracted to her instructor, Laurie
Bloomgarden waited for the quarter to
end before attempting to transform the
friendship into something more.
The ensuing relationship also figured
into her decision not to take a class from
Computer Science Lecturer Nick Par
lante the next year, auditing it instead. "I

like to know that the way I'm being grad
ed is for the work I'm doing," she said.
When Bloomgarden, Class of '92,
asked him out, Parlante considered the
ethical questions and decided to go for it.
"The position could be abusive," he said
of romances between faculty and stu
dents. "But it's also possible to have a re
lationship that's just fine."
Abuse of power is the first possibility
that bothers university administrators

across the countiy as they consider
whether to ban what are termed "con
sensual relationships" between students
and their academic supervisors.
Interest in regulating such campus ro
mances has been growing in recent
months, according to Lesley Francis, as
sociate secretary for the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. But in
few instances has such interest resulted
in official policy.

"Most (universities) have sexual ha
rassment policies. Very few have policies
on consensual sexual relationships," said
Francis, who added that the ethical con
siderations are nothing new.
"The issue's been around since Adam
and Eve," she said.
Sixteen to 18 percent of graduate and
undergraduate students nationwide
have had at least one sexual relationship
with a teaching assistant or faculty mem

ber, according to Fran Gibson, coordina
tor of Stanford's Sexual Assault Infor
mation and Resource Center.
Such numbers are beginning to arouse
the interest of policy makers and stu
dents alike.
'The Big Sister plan*
When the University of Virginia con
sidered banning ail sexual relationships
between faculty and students last month,
it drew a storm of criticism and focused a
national spotlight on the issue.
Television crews flocked to the campus,
and USA Today founder A 1 Neuharth
blasted "faculty feminists" in an editorial
denouncing the proposed policy.
"The Big Sister plan would ban 'all
romantic or sexual overtures,' " Neuharth
wrote. "A smile? A wink? Conversation
over a cup of coffee? Such trysts as a cam
pus stroll?"
Virginia eventually rejected the blanket
ban in favor of a milder policy — which
must still be approved by the school's
Board of Visitors — but debate continues
on many other campuses.
A faculty member may not "engage in
amorous or sexual relations with, or make
amorous or sexual overtures to, any student
over whom he or she holds a position of
authority," Virginia's revised policy reads in
part. It defines "faculty" as teaching assis
tants, graders, coaches and professors.
Despite the renewed interest recently,
the first policy on faculty-student
romances was adopted by Harvard Univer
sity in 1984. The University of lowa fol
lowed suit in 1986. Both schools forbid fac
ulty members and TAs to have relation
ships with the students whose work they
supervise.
'Hard to outlaw love'
At Stanford, members of the work
group drafting the sexual harassment poli
cy — which awaits approval from the Uni
versity Cabinet — say there was little dis
sent over whether to regulate romances.
The proposed policy contains two para
graphs on consensual relationships —
including a word of caution that such dal
liances carry "special risks."
The relationships may "be less consen
sual than the individual whose position
confers power believes, because of the com
plex and subtle effects of that power," the
draft states.
It adds that although the University has
no formal policy prohibiting trysts between

students, faculty or staff, the Stanford
community should be aware that uneven
power relations could lead to complaints of
harassment or unfair advantages.
Although the draft urges caution and
says of faculty-student romance that "it's a
precarious situation, it's not optimal,"
work group member Susan Hoerger added
that the statement is just a warning.
"It is not saying that love does not exist
in these relationships," she said. "And it's
hard to outlaw love."
University administrator Barbara But
terfield, another policy author, agreed. "In
a word, how would one monitor it?" she
asked. "I think it's really difficult to ban
something you cannot monitor or control."
Work group member Tom Matteoli said
he has received "some comments (which
have) suggested that the section on con
sensual relationships should be stronger
than it is" but knows of no discussion on
creating a stricter policy.
Most universities with policies on the
issue don't prohibit relationships as long as
the faculty member is not teaching or grad
ing the student.
Parlante agrees that a relationship with
someone in a class he teaches would be
"really unacceptable." But Bloomgarden,
whom he went on to date for about nine
months, was no longer under his supervi
sion once the class ended.
"It's just a judgment call of whether to
cross the line," Parlante said. And if he is in
a situation where a student is flirting with
him, Parlante said he will "just ignore it."
Bloomgarden, who graduated last win
ter quarter, said she definitely considered
possible complications. "I think if I'd been
in the department and had contact with
him on a regular basis, it would have been
uncomfortable," she said.
But because Parlante, at 26, is only a
few years older than Bloomgarden — "He
was a senior when I was a frosh," she said
— she was able to see him as a romantic
possibility.
"Most of my professors are a lot older,"
she said. "A relationship would never be an
issue."
Bloomgarden said a policy warning
against trysts with faculty members would

not have changed her mind about dating
Parlante. Parlante also said he would
oppose rules forbidding such a relation
ship, likening such regulations to banning
alcohol to prevent alcoholism.
Kent Willis, director of the Virginia
ACLU, agreed. The policies are "misdirect
ed" because they are aimed at preventing
relationships rather than punishing sexual
harassment, he said. "They are simply
shooting at the wrong target."
Willis said he has read many of the poli
cies. "They run from wrong to very
wrong," he said, adding that regulating
relationships violates Constitutional rights
of privacy and free association.
4 A sticky issue'
The conflict between protecting women
from exploitation and preserving personal
freedom leaves many feminists puzzling
over a solution.
"It's really just a sticky issue," said
Rebecca Bliss, coordinator of the Stanford
Women's Center. "Certainly I don't think
these relationships are wise or recom
mended."
But the potential for problems isn't
enough to convince her to support restric
tions. "I don't feel that on a possibility the
University can choose to make a law about
what people do on their own time," Bliss said.
An across-the-board condemnation is
especially difficult, she added. "You could
have a biology professor dating a history
grad student. What's wrong with that?"
When the relationship involves an
instructor and a student in his or her class,
however, the situation can get more com
plicated.
Diana Akiyama, an associate dean of
Memorial Church, said she is aware of
"cases in which a TA uses, either con
sciously or unconsciously, his power as a
TA" to ask out or get dates with female
students in his class.
Even in a mutually desired relationship,
Akiyama asked, "How much of the attrac
tion is actually influenced by the power
imbalance?"
Hoerger cited two possible complaints
that could arise from a romance with a
supervisor. First, there may be charges of

unfair treatment where someone says, "I'm
in a relationship with my boss and I don't
get a pay raise .. . and I think it's because
our relationship is starting to sour."
Sexual involvements could also raise
concerns about special treatment, Hoerger
said, using the example of a third party who
says "you got an A because you are the TA's
'friend' and I got a B because I'm not."
Work group members say they never
looked into whether consensual relation
ships are a concern at Stanford. "It was not
drafted in response to any reported or per
ceived problem," Hoerger said.
They did, however, investigate policies
at universities and companies around the
country. At Tufts University, for example,
the policy forbids faculty to date students
they teach.
A strong advocate of such rules, Tufts
Provost Sol Gittleman drafted the policy
himself. Concern with possible coercion or
the perception of unfairness prompted the
policy, Gittleman said.
"A faculty member could say, 'Love me
or I'll give you a C.' "

in the department and had contact with
him on a regular basis, it would have been
uncomfortable," she said.
But because Parlante, at 26, is only a
few years older than Bloomgarden — "He
was a senior when I was a frosh," she said
— she was able to see him as a romantic
possibility.
"Most of my professors are a lot older,"
she said. "A relationship would never be an
issue."
Bloomgarden said a policy warning
against trysts with faculty members would

not have changed her mind about dating
Parlante. Parlante also said he would
oppose rules forbidding such a relation
ship, likening such regulations to banning
alcohol to prevent alcoholism.
Kent Willis, director of the Virginia
ACLU, agreed. The policies are "misdirect
ed" because they are aimed at preventing
relationships rather than punishing sexual
harassment, he said. "They are simply
shooting at the wrong target."
Willis said he has read many of the poli
cies. "They run from wrong to very
wrong," he said, adding that regulating
relationships violates Constitutional rights
of privacy and free association.
4 A sticky issue'
The conflict between protecting women
from exploitation and preserving personal
freedom leaves many feminists puzzling
over a solution.
"It's really just a sticky issue," said
Rebecca Bliss, coordinator of the Stanford
Women's Center. "Certainly I don't think
these relationships are wise or recom
mended."
But the potential for problems isn't
enough to convince her to support restric
tions. "I don't feel that on a possibility the
University can choose to make a law about
what people do on their own time," Bliss said.
An across-the-board condemnation is
especially difficult, she added. "You could
have a biology professor dating a history
grad student. What's wrong with that?"
When the relationship involves an
instructor and a student in his or her class,
however, the situation can get more com
plicated.
Diana Akiyama, an associate dean of
Memorial Church, said she is aware of
"cases in which a TA uses, either con
sciously or unconsciously, his power as a
TA" to ask out or get dates with female
students in his class.
Even in a mutually desired relationship,
Akiyama asked, "How much of the attrac
tion is actually influenced by the power
imbalance?"
Hoerger cited two possible complaints
that could arise from a romance with a
supervisor. First, there may be charges of

unfair treatment where someone says, "I'm
in a relationship with my boss and I don't
get a pay raise .. . and I think it's because
our relationship is starting to sour."
Sexual involvements could also raise
concerns about special treatment, Hoerger
said, using the example of a third party who
says "you got an A because you are the TA's
'friend' and I got a B because I'm not."
Work group members say they never
looked into whether consensual relation
ships are a concern at Stanford. "It was not
drafted in response to any reported or per
ceived problem," Hoerger said.
They did, however, investigate policies
at universities and companies around the
country. At Tufts University, for example,
the policy forbids faculty to date students
they teach.
A strong advocate of such rules, Tufts
Provost Sol Gittleman drafted the policy
himself. Concern with possible coercion or
the perception of unfairness prompted the
policy, Gittleman said.
"A faculty member could say, 'Love me
or I'll give you a C.' "
Fellow students may feel that the grad
ing system is corrupt if the professor walks
out of a class holding hands with a student,
he added.
Still, he said, relationships with stu
dents not under the faculty member's
influence are legitimate. "If it's a professor
of classics wanting to date a veterinary stu
dent, that's fine."
Most of the few schools with such poli
cies have enacted similar rules, but
Amherst College settled on an unusual pol
icy in March when they said faculty mem
bers who become sexually involved with a
student must remove themselves from any
supervisory role.
The policy was adopted only after the
faculty rejected a call from the president to
prohibit the relationships outright.
"There are students and there are facul
ty who believe that sexual relationships
between students are part of the academic
experience," History Prof. Francis Cou
vares, a member of the committee that
drafted the ban, told the campus newspa
per. "The issue is not going to go away."
A proposal that would have forced facul

ty to report sexual liaisons to one of the
school's deans also drew an overwhelming
ly negative reaction.
Relationships not uncommon
Whether or not they contain an element
of harassment, relationships between stu
dents and their academic supervisors are
nothing new.
Gittleman is convinced that faculty-stu
dent romances are quite common, especial
ly at "little isolated schools where faculty
live on campus and there's nothing else to
do."
At research universities like Stanford,
he said, the relationships are likely to
spring up between professors and graduate
students with whom they work closely.
"Anybody who says it doesn't happen is
not leveling with you," Gittleman added.
Butterfield agreed. "I would be naive to
say there aren't couples today that were (at
one time) students and faculty," she said.
Especially with TAs and undergradu
ates who are close to the same age, class
room situations can easily breed romance.
Warnings against dating, however, are a
departmental prerogative rather than a
University-wide policy.
"I know some departments actively dis
courage dating or relationships between
TAs and students they are teaching," said
Michelle Marincovich, director of the Cen
ter for Teaching and Learning.
The issue came up last fall at a freshman
Orientation program called "Sex in the
'905," according to Caroline Mitchell, the
sexual assault prevention outreach educa
tor. One skit portrayed a woman trying to
get help from a TA when he makes a pass.
When he threatens her with a low
grade, Mitchell said, the woman says she'll
tell the professor. As she walked out on
him, the audience cheered her assertive
ness.
With resident assistants, too, there can
be concern over relationships with those in
their dormitories. "We don't have a poli
cy," said Ann Porteus, associate director of
Residential Education. "We ask RAs to be
considerate in their relationships.... Our
philosophy is that we want RAs to be avail
able to all residents."
