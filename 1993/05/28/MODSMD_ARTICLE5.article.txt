# Faculty-student relationships present regulatory difficulties

### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Attracted to her instructor, Laurie
Bloomgarden waited for the quarter to
end before attempting to transform the
friendship into something more.
The ensuing relationship also figured
into her decision not to take a class from
Computer Science Lecturer Nick Par
lante the next year, auditing it instead. "I

like to know that the way I'm being grad
ed is for the work I'm doing," she said.
When Bloomgarden, Class of '92,
asked him out, Parlante considered the
ethical questions and decided to go for it.
"The position could be abusive," he said
of romances between faculty and stu
dents. "But it's also possible to have a re
lationship that's just fine."
Abuse of power is the first possibility
that bothers university administrators

across the countiy as they consider
whether to ban what are termed "con
sensual relationships" between students
and their academic supervisors.
Interest in regulating such campus ro
mances has been growing in recent
months, according to Lesley Francis, as
sociate secretary for the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. But in
few instances has such interest resulted
in official policy.

"Most (universities) have sexual ha
rassment policies. Very few have policies
on consensual sexual relationships," said
Francis, who added that the ethical con
siderations are nothing new.
"The issue's been around since Adam
and Eve," she said.
Sixteen to 18 percent of graduate and
undergraduate students nationwide
have had at least one sexual relationship
with a teaching assistant or faculty mem

ber, according to Fran Gibson, coordina
tor of Stanford's Sexual Assault Infor
mation and Resource Center.
Such numbers are beginning to arouse
the interest of policy makers and stu
dents alike.
