### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Showing signs of wear from a
long first year, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper went on the
defensive about his accessibility
to students and commitment to
multicultural issues at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
Casper spoke in response to
concerns raised by Engineering-
Economic Systems Prof. Ross
Shachter, who said he perceives
many problems stemming from
a lack of student input within
the University, including bad
communication and an "atmo
sphere of mistrust and discom
fort."
Shachter also noted that
other concerns involve a lack of
student representation this year
on the University Committee on
Minority Issues and a fear that
the Office of Multicultural
Development will lose its seat on
the University Cabinet.
Casper, however, said he
hopes the Stanford community
will not act merely on its suspi
cions but will try to "ascertain

the facts first."
Casper went on to deny, with
increasing intensity and empha
sis, that any of the problems
Shachter mentioned exist.
There was no student input
on the UCMI report this year
because there was no formal
review of the policy, Casper said.
Instead, he said the cabinet was
formulating its response to the
last review, done in 1991, in
which two students participated.
Casper added that if it were
not for him, the response would
never have been put on the cabi
net's agenda. He then said he
has no intention of removing the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment from the cabinet.
He became especially frus
trated with an accusation that
the Council of Presidents' access
to his office has been restricted.
He added that he did not know
the rumor's origin, as there was
no COP this year. He admitted
that the new COP might have
tried to make an appointment
when his schedule was too full.
Another grievance Shachter
addressed was Casper's short, 10-

minute visits to ethnic centers ear
lier this year. "My frustration was
at least as high as that of the stu
dents," Casper said in response.
Casper, saying it has been nec
essary to explain his activities
"every so often," gave a detailed
account of the numerous policies
he confronted this year as well as
all the trips he made to national
events, Stanford residences, fac
ulty lunches, ceremonies, ASSU
meetings and football games.
"And at the same time, I run
the University," he added.
In fact, Casper noted, such
activities required him to awak
en at 4 a.m. yesterday.
Shachter said after the meet
ing that he was pleased to hear
that the Office of Multicultural
Development will retain its cabi
net seat, but added that he would
have preferred a stronger state
ment about multiculturalism.
"I was not trying to attack
him," Shachter said, adding that
he was not acting as a spokesper
son for any group. "The issues
need to be addressed and the
president needs to know about
the misconceptions."
