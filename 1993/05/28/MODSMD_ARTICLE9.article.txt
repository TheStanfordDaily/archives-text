WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton
said yesterday he would extend for one year
China's favorable trade status but warned that
the United States would not "turn our back" on
human rights abuses there.
"It's a great opportunity for America there,"
Clinton said during a two-hour TV town hall
meeting on CBS.
Clinton had been expected to renew China's
most-favored-nation trade status but had not
formally announced his decision. That will come
Friday in a Rose Garden ceremony, said White
House spokesman George Stephanopoulos.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
speaking at the University of Minnesota, said the
administration was concerned about human
rights, trade practices and weapons sales.
At the same time, he said, "we are interested
in maintaining good relationships with China.
We are interested in having the Chinese market
available to U.S. businesses."
