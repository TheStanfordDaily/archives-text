SUMMER HEALTH INSURANCE
FOR UNREGISTERED STUDENTS
If you are on the Student Health Insurance plan for Spring Quarter, you
are eligible to extend your insurance coverage over the summer even if
you have graduated or are not going to be registered.
You need to:
■ Complete and submit with payment the "Request for Unregistered
Health Insurance for Summer Quarter 1992-93" form, mailed to all
students (currently on the policy) during the week of 5/10/93.
OR
■ Come to Cowell Student Health Center and pay the $176 premium.
■ The deadline to pay for summer insurance is June 23,1993.
Requests for insurance after this date will not be honored.
Please note:
■ Student returning in the Fall: If continuous coverage is not
maintained, conditions which exist during any break in coverage
are considered "pre-existing" and will result in limited benefits for
the first 12 months of reinstatement to the policy.
■ Dependent Coverage: To insure continuous coverage, dependent
premiums must be received at the insurance desk at Cowell no
later than July 7,1993.
■ The purchase of health insurance during an unregistered quarter
does not provide you with continued free service at Cowell
Student Health Center. Service at Cowell is on a fee-for-service
basis during unregistered quarters.
■ If you are currently on the plan, and you will be registered this
summer, you need do nothing.
