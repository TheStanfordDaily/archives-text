# Casper leads Stanford in year of change, re-evaluation
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Nobody said being a university pres
ident was easy.
After nine months at Stanford's
helm, Gerhard Casper has found this
to be particularly true.
Assuming a very public role at one of
the nation's most visible universities,
Casper has found the move from be
hind-the-scenes administrative roles
at the low-key University of Chicago a
definite challenge.
Thrust from the academic positions
of dean and provost at Chicago —
where he dealt with twice as many
graduate students as undergraduates
and a less diverse student body — the
transition to becoming Stanford's top
administrator has been quite a change.
Casper found out quickly since tak
ing over Sept. 1 that being Stanford's
president, especially after the indirect
cost scandal, has meant his every state
ment and action comes under intense
public scrutiny.
"On the day before the inaugura
tion, the local press here speculated
what I would be saying in my inaugur
al speech, but Ithe press in Chicago]
wouldn't have reported my inaugural
speech after I delivered it," Casper said
in an interview last week with The
Daily.
Even compared to the presidency of
the well-respected University of Chica
go, he said, "there is much more con
centration here on the president."
The demands have sometimes been
frustrating. At a recent Faculty Senate
meeting, Casper became visibly discon
certed by a comment that students felt
he was unresponsive to their concerns.

While recognizing that his adminis
tration is not perfect, Casper said it is
comments such as these that bother
him the most.
"Very few people bother to find out
what the true facts are," he said.
"There are certain images created and
then they are very hard to overcome. . .
. I am bothered when people make alle
gations without having tried to estab
lish the facts."

'Very few people bother
to find out what the true
facts are. There are cer
tain images created and
then they are very hard to
overcome.... I am both
ered when people make
allegations without having
tried to establish the facts.'

. Among faculty and students, reac
tion to Casper's first year of leadership
has been mixed. He has been praised
for calling for re-evaluations of a num
ber of the University's established in
stitutions — such as undergraduate
education and the administration —
and for improving Stanford's public
image.
At the same time, some of his ac
tions — or lack of action in some cases

— have generated criticism from
those who do not like the perceived di
rection the changes are heading.
Stanford has not "been very accept
ing of someone new who is raising new
questions," said Jean Fetter, Casper's
special assistant and a former dean of
admissions. "There is a suspicion of the
unknown . . . some are suspicious be
cause of what is unknown."
General approval
Taking over after Donald Kennedy's
tumultuous 12 years — which includ
ed the 1991 indirect-cost scandal — ap
pears to have tempered some of the
concerns students may have had about
their new president.
According to a poll conducted by
The Daily, nearly half of 403 students
surveyed approve of the way Casper
has handled the presidency, while
only 11 percent disapprove of how he
is doing.
And when asked what they consid
ered to be Casper's most significant ac
complishment this year, the majority
of students who could identify one said
that he had been successful in keeping
Stanford out of the public eye. Nearly
half of the students polled said they
thought Casper's one year has im
proved Stanford's image.
"The morale of faculty, alumni, staff
and many students has been tremen
dously improved," said Provost Gerald
Lieberman.
The change in the University's lead
ership has also helped relations with
the government.

In last week's interview with The Daily, Casper expresses some of the frustrations of his
office. "Very few people bother to find out what the true facts are," he said of recent crit
icism.
