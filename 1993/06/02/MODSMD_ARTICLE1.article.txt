# Casper leads Stanford in year of change, re-evaluation
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Nobody said being a university pres
ident was easy.
After nine months at Stanford's
helm, Gerhard Casper has found this
to be particularly true.
Assuming a very public role at one of
the nation's most visible universities,
Casper has found the move from be
hind-the-scenes administrative roles
at the low-key University of Chicago a
definite challenge.
Thrust from the academic positions
of dean and provost at Chicago —
where he dealt with twice as many
graduate students as undergraduates
and a less diverse student body — the
transition to becoming Stanford's top
administrator has been quite a change.
Casper found out quickly since tak
ing over Sept. 1 that being Stanford's
president, especially after the indirect
cost scandal, has meant his every state
ment and action comes under intense
public scrutiny.
"On the day before the inaugura
tion, the local press here speculated
what I would be saying in my inaugur
al speech, but Ithe press in Chicago]
wouldn't have reported my inaugural
speech after I delivered it," Casper said
in an interview last week with The
Daily.
Even compared to the presidency of
the well-respected University of Chica
go, he said, "there is much more con
centration here on the president."
The demands have sometimes been
frustrating. At a recent Faculty Senate
meeting, Casper became visibly discon
certed by a comment that students felt
he was unresponsive to their concerns.

While recognizing that his adminis
tration is not perfect, Casper said it is
comments such as these that bother
him the most.
"Very few people bother to find out
what the true facts are," he said.
"There are certain images created and
then they are very hard to overcome. . .
. I am bothered when people make alle
gations without having tried to estab
lish the facts."

'Very few people bother
to find out what the true
facts are. There are cer
tain images created and
then they are very hard to
overcome.... I am both
ered when people make
allegations without having
tried to establish the facts.'

. Among faculty and students, reac
tion to Casper's first year of leadership
has been mixed. He has been praised
for calling for re-evaluations of a num
ber of the University's established in
stitutions — such as undergraduate
education and the administration —
and for improving Stanford's public
image.
At the same time, some of his ac
tions — or lack of action in some cases

— have generated criticism from
those who do not like the perceived di
rection the changes are heading.
Stanford has not "been very accept
ing of someone new who is raising new
questions," said Jean Fetter, Casper's
special assistant and a former dean of
admissions. "There is a suspicion of the
unknown . . . some are suspicious be
cause of what is unknown."
General approval
Taking over after Donald Kennedy's
tumultuous 12 years — which includ
ed the 1991 indirect-cost scandal — ap
pears to have tempered some of the
concerns students may have had about
their new president.
According to a poll conducted by
The Daily, nearly half of 403 students
surveyed approve of the way Casper
has handled the presidency, while
only 11 percent disapprove of how he
is doing.
And when asked what they consid
ered to be Casper's most significant ac
complishment this year, the majority
of students who could identify one said
that he had been successful in keeping
Stanford out of the public eye. Nearly
half of the students polled said they
thought Casper's one year has im
proved Stanford's image.
"The morale of faculty, alumni, staff
and many students has been tremen
dously improved," said Provost Gerald
Lieberman.
The change in the University's lead
ership has also helped relations with
the government.
"The fact that the first day he came
in he wrote a letter to Admiral Miller

icism.
in the Office of Naval ResearchJ
had a significant impact on the
people I work with within the
government," said Chief Finan
cial Officer Peter Van Etten.
"They were very impressed."
Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said Casper has decreased
the anxiety level on campus,
especially regarding financial
issues.
Casper said he has spent a lot
of time with alumni and govern
ment officials to rectify Stan
ford's image after the indirect
cost controversy.
However, Casper added that
he is "not in the image business.
I'm not trying to correct an
image out there. I just want peo
ple to be professional in the way
they perceive Stanford.
"We have our warts and I'm
not opposed to people reporting
our warts. I just want people to
give us a fair shake," he added.
However, Casper is also very
aware that the way he handles
issues influences policy out
comes. For example, he said he
purposely did not make a state
ment about last December's
domestic-partners benefits con
troversy because he did not want
to speak out and create any
potential conflict with the Board
of Trustees.
Instead, he chose to work qui
etly behind the scenes and just
let the policy that had been in
formation for two years "run its
course."
A host of changes
In many other areas, though,
Casper has decided to be more
vocal, implementing changes
that have raised concerns — and
garnered praise — throughout
the University.

Some of the changes began as
soon as he came into office. Reor
ganizing the large administra
tion that had been gradually
established under Donald
Kennedy, he eliminated some of
the top positions — including six
vice-presidential positions — so
that upper-level power was cen
tralized around the offices of the
president and the provost.

'We have our warts
and I'm not opposed
to people reporting
our warts. I just want
people to give us a
fair shake.'
— Gerhard Casper

As the year went on, he pro
posed evaluations of areas
including undergraduate educa
tion, the University's conflict of
interest and commitment poli
cies, the judicial policy and the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment. In addition, he created a
Medical Center task force and
the position of assistant dean of
graduate policy to allay fears
that graduate student concerns
were not being addressed by
administrators.
Now at the end of the year,
with the appointments of Politi
cal Science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice as provost and Economics
Prof. John Shoven as the dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, Casper has created an
almost completely new top
administration.
Some faculty members have
expressed concern that Casper's
administrative reorganization

has given him too much control.
"Gerhard Casper has quietly
and slowly cleaned house and
has now created his own staff of
advisers and aides," said History
Prof. Barton Bernstein. "He
seems to be someone who wants
a great sense of control."
Faculty Senate Chair William
Northway, however, supported
Casper's administrative reorga
nization.
"It's hard to redo the system
without concentrating power
and using this power," he said.
This control, some feel, has
extended to the Campus Report,
the newspaper published by the
University News Service.
With the elimination of the
vice president of public relations,
the editor of news service now
directly reports to Casper, a rela
tionship which some feel is too
restrictive.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz
feels that Casper has "seized
control" of Campus Report,
which has taken away the free
dom of the publication.
"If there is negative news, it
must be put into a long-term
positive context," Rebholz
added.
A few staff members have
even taken to calling it "Casper's
Report."
Casper rejects the criticism
that he has given himself too
much control through adminis
trative reorganization.
Saying that he would not have
been able to survive his first year
without delegating authority,
Casper added that "you cannot
micro-manage a university.
"The real power in a universi
ty is not in the president's office
. . . real decisions are made at
the local level. I haven't any
power to manage if I wanted to,
but I do want my own staff to be
professional."
'Will the students be heard?'
A vocal student minority
would like to see Casper's staff
become more responsive to stu
dent concerns.
While only about one-fifth of
students polled by The Daily
believe Casper has not been
responsive to student concerns,
students' frustration with the
administration was visibly
demonstrated Thursday at a
teach-in in White Plaza.
The rally — titled "The
Changing State of the Universi
ty: Will the students be
heard?"— drew about 100 stu
dents and a handful of adminis
trators who listened to speeches
advocating a greater student
voice in University decisions.
"One of the things we'd like to
see more is a greater amount of
contact between Casper and stu
dents," said junior Ron Brown, a
Council of Presidents member.
"I understand that the job of
being president is significant and
that time constraints can limit
the amount of time the president
can spend, but I hope that stu
dents remain an important pri
ority with the office of the presi
dent."
While recognizing that Casper
has a busy schedule, sophomore

Anietie Ekanem, one of the
teach-in organizers, said Casper
relates well with the administra
tion, "but his student-relations
side must improve for the Uni
versity to improve."
Brown said he believes "if the
lack of student input in adminis
trative activities continues, we'll
assume that's desired. It is
appropriate to give the president
a certain amount of grace period,

If the lack of student input in administrative
activities continues, we'll assume that's
desired. It is appropriate to give the presi
dent a certain amount of grace period, to let
him establish a presence. That grace period
is coming to an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student body.'
— Ron Brown

to let him establish a presence.
That grace period is coming to
an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student
body."
Casper said he has tried this
year to remain open to student
opinion, as he has been to "zil
lions of dorms and other settings
for input and points of view."
Noting that he works most
days from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
Casper said he is often "very
frustrated" with the time con
straints that he has to work
under, specifically pointing to
the 10-minute time periods he
was limited to during his one
day visit to campus ethnic cen
ters.

Casper said he also feels that
he has been unfairly placed into
a paradoxical no-win situation.
"If I say something, I get crit
icized for listening; if I listen, I
get criticized for not saying
something."
Defining multiculturalism
Despite his attempts to garner
student feedback, some mem
bers of the Stanford community

fear that Casper is taking steps
toward reversing progress made
in multiculturalism over the
past few years.
In fact, only 33 percent of stu
dents have a favorable opinion of
the way he has handled multicul
tural issues, according to the
Daily poll.
"There have been a number of
events, changes in the Universi
ty which have set a certain atmo
sphere which is not very friendly
toward multicultural educa
tion," said Patty Tsai, a member
of Asian/Pacific Islanders for
Education and Change at Stan
ford. Tsai pointed to a draft of
the University Cabinet's critical
response to the 1991 University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and the resignation of for
mer Office of Multicultural Edu
cation Director Sharon Parker
as two such events.
Assoc. Dean of Students Jim
Larimore, who serves as the
director of the American Indian
Program Office, said part of peo
ple's concern stems from the fact
that "there is still some ambigu

ity or question about what direc
tion the president and other
senior administrators want to go
in.
"There just hasn't been a
clear, concise statement of prin
ciple or belief," he added.
Instead, Casper has focused
his attention in other areas, said
Rick Yuen, the director of the
Asian American Activities Cen
ter. "Casper will have different
priorities [from Kennedy]. His
priority so far that I have seen is
repairing the relationship with
the government," he said.
"He hasn't articulated any
other priorities. Maybe that's
why there is tension. Any time
people don't see themselves in
priorities, they tend to worry,"
Yuen added.
However, the fact that Casper
has been at Stanford less than a
year has made some others cau
tious about final judgements.
"People are getting too hung
up on trying to compare the
Kennedy administration and
what they've accrued in 10 years
and Casper's administration and
what they've done in one year,"
said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
The Stanford community has
become too attached to multicul
turalism on the surface, he said,
without bothering to find out
what the concept really means.
"We're getting too stuck on
terms," he added. "While the
term multiculturalism has
meaning in terms of trying to
help us develop another way of
life, in a way we're stuck on the
term."
Casper has said he feels the
term "multiculturalism" is in
need of a definition.
"I would like anybody, any
body to point to anything I did
that suggests that I'm not com
mitted to multiculturalism,
whatever it means," he said. "I
have been going to the dorms
and trying to get a discussion
going on what exactly do we
mean."
However, several people have
voiced concern over Parker's
sudden resignation three weeks
ago and the planned review of

. Among faculty and students, reac
tion to Casper's first year of leadership
has been mixed. He has been praised
for calling for re-evaluations of a num
ber of the University's established in
stitutions — such as undergraduate
education and the administration —
and for improving Stanford's public
image.
At the same time, some of his ac
tions — or lack of action in some cases

— have generated criticism from
those who do not like the perceived di
rection the changes are heading.
Stanford has not "been very accept
ing of someone new who is raising new
questions," said Jean Fetter, Casper's
special assistant and a former dean of
admissions. "There is a suspicion of the
unknown . . . some are suspicious be
cause of what is unknown."
General approval
Taking over after Donald Kennedy's
tumultuous 12 years — which includ
ed the 1991 indirect-cost scandal — ap
pears to have tempered some of the
concerns students may have had about
their new president.
According to a poll conducted by
The Daily, nearly half of 403 students
surveyed approve of the way Casper
has handled the presidency, while
only 11 percent disapprove of how he
is doing.
And when asked what they consid
ered to be Casper's most significant ac
complishment this year, the majority
of students who could identify one said
that he had been successful in keeping
Stanford out of the public eye. Nearly
half of the students polled said they
thought Casper's one year has im
proved Stanford's image.
"The morale of faculty, alumni, staff
and many students has been tremen
dously improved," said Provost Gerald
Lieberman.
The change in the University's lead
ership has also helped relations with
the government.

in the Office of Naval ResearchJ
had a significant impact on the
people I work with within the
government," said Chief Finan
cial Officer Peter Van Etten.
"They were very impressed."
Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said Casper has decreased
the anxiety level on campus,
especially regarding financial
issues.
Casper said he has spent a lot
of time with alumni and govern
ment officials to rectify Stan
ford's image after the indirect
cost controversy.
However, Casper added that
he is "not in the image business.
I'm not trying to correct an
image out there. I just want peo
ple to be professional in the way
they perceive Stanford.
"We have our warts and I'm
not opposed to people reporting
our warts. I just want people to
give us a fair shake," he added.
However, Casper is also very
aware that the way he handles
issues influences policy out
comes. For example, he said he
purposely did not make a state
ment about last December's
domestic-partners benefits con
troversy because he did not want
to speak out and create any
potential conflict with the Board
of Trustees.
Instead, he chose to work qui
etly behind the scenes and just
let the policy that had been in
formation for two years "run its
course."
A host of changes
In many other areas, though,
Casper has decided to be more
vocal, implementing changes
that have raised concerns — and
garnered praise — throughout
the University.

Some of the changes began as
soon as he came into office. Reor
ganizing the large administra
tion that had been gradually
established under Donald
Kennedy, he eliminated some of
the top positions — including six
vice-presidential positions — so
that upper-level power was cen
tralized around the offices of the
president and the provost.

'We have our warts
and I'm not opposed
to people reporting
our warts. I just want
people to give us a
fair shake.'
— Gerhard Casper

As the year went on, he pro
posed evaluations of areas
including undergraduate educa
tion, the University's conflict of
interest and commitment poli
cies, the judicial policy and the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment. In addition, he created a
Medical Center task force and
the position of assistant dean of
graduate policy to allay fears
that graduate student concerns
were not being addressed by
administrators.
Now at the end of the year,
with the appointments of Politi
cal Science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice as provost and Economics
Prof. John Shoven as the dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, Casper has created an
almost completely new top
administration.
Some faculty members have
expressed concern that Casper's
administrative reorganization

has given him too much control.
"Gerhard Casper has quietly
and slowly cleaned house and
has now created his own staff of
advisers and aides," said History
Prof. Barton Bernstein. "He
seems to be someone who wants
a great sense of control."
Faculty Senate Chair William
Northway, however, supported
Casper's administrative reorga
nization.
"It's hard to redo the system
without concentrating power
and using this power," he said.
This control, some feel, has
extended to the Campus Report,
the newspaper published by the
University News Service.
With the elimination of the
vice president of public relations,
the editor of news service now
directly reports to Casper, a rela
tionship which some feel is too
restrictive.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz
feels that Casper has "seized
control" of Campus Report,
which has taken away the free
dom of the publication.
"If there is negative news, it
must be put into a long-term
positive context," Rebholz
added.
A few staff members have
even taken to calling it "Casper's
Report."
Casper rejects the criticism
that he has given himself too
much control through adminis
trative reorganization.
Saying that he would not have
been able to survive his first year
without delegating authority,
Casper added that "you cannot
micro-manage a university.
"The real power in a universi
ty is not in the president's office
. . . real decisions are made at
the local level. I haven't any
power to manage if I wanted to,
but I do want my own staff to be
professional."
'Will the students be heard?'
A vocal student minority
would like to see Casper's staff
become more responsive to stu
dent concerns.
While only about one-fifth of
students polled by The Daily
believe Casper has not been
responsive to student concerns,
students' frustration with the
administration was visibly
demonstrated Thursday at a
teach-in in White Plaza.
The rally — titled "The
Changing State of the Universi
ty: Will the students be
heard?"— drew about 100 stu
dents and a handful of adminis
trators who listened to speeches
advocating a greater student
voice in University decisions.
"One of the things we'd like to
see more is a greater amount of
contact between Casper and stu
dents," said junior Ron Brown, a
Council of Presidents member.
"I understand that the job of
being president is significant and
that time constraints can limit
the amount of time the president
can spend, but I hope that stu
dents remain an important pri
ority with the office of the presi
dent."
While recognizing that Casper
has a busy schedule, sophomore

Anietie Ekanem, one of the
teach-in organizers, said Casper
relates well with the administra
tion, "but his student-relations
side must improve for the Uni
versity to improve."
Brown said he believes "if the
lack of student input in adminis
trative activities continues, we'll
assume that's desired. It is
appropriate to give the president
a certain amount of grace period,

If the lack of student input in administrative
activities continues, we'll assume that's
desired. It is appropriate to give the presi
dent a certain amount of grace period, to let
him establish a presence. That grace period
is coming to an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student body.'
— Ron Brown

to let him establish a presence.
That grace period is coming to
an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student
body."
Casper said he has tried this
year to remain open to student
opinion, as he has been to "zil
lions of dorms and other settings
for input and points of view."
Noting that he works most
days from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
Casper said he is often "very
frustrated" with the time con
straints that he has to work
under, specifically pointing to
the 10-minute time periods he
was limited to during his one
day visit to campus ethnic cen
ters.

Casper said he also feels that
he has been unfairly placed into
a paradoxical no-win situation.
"If I say something, I get crit
icized for listening; if I listen, I
get criticized for not saying
something."
Defining multiculturalism
Despite his attempts to garner
student feedback, some mem
bers of the Stanford community

fear that Casper is taking steps
toward reversing progress made
in multiculturalism over the
past few years.
In fact, only 33 percent of stu
dents have a favorable opinion of
the way he has handled multicul
tural issues, according to the
Daily poll.
"There have been a number of
events, changes in the Universi
ty which have set a certain atmo
sphere which is not very friendly
toward multicultural educa
tion," said Patty Tsai, a member
of Asian/Pacific Islanders for
Education and Change at Stan
ford. Tsai pointed to a draft of
the University Cabinet's critical
response to the 1991 University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and the resignation of for
mer Office of Multicultural Edu
cation Director Sharon Parker
as two such events.
Assoc. Dean of Students Jim
Larimore, who serves as the
director of the American Indian
Program Office, said part of peo
ple's concern stems from the fact
that "there is still some ambigu

ity or question about what direc
tion the president and other
senior administrators want to go
in.
"There just hasn't been a
clear, concise statement of prin
ciple or belief," he added.
Instead, Casper has focused
his attention in other areas, said
Rick Yuen, the director of the
Asian American Activities Cen
ter. "Casper will have different
priorities [from Kennedy]. His
priority so far that I have seen is
repairing the relationship with
the government," he said.
"He hasn't articulated any
other priorities. Maybe that's
why there is tension. Any time
people don't see themselves in
priorities, they tend to worry,"
Yuen added.
However, the fact that Casper
has been at Stanford less than a
year has made some others cau
tious about final judgements.
"People are getting too hung
up on trying to compare the
Kennedy administration and
what they've accrued in 10 years
and Casper's administration and
what they've done in one year,"
said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
The Stanford community has
become too attached to multicul
turalism on the surface, he said,
without bothering to find out
what the concept really means.
"We're getting too stuck on
terms," he added. "While the
term multiculturalism has
meaning in terms of trying to
help us develop another way of
life, in a way we're stuck on the
term."
Casper has said he feels the
term "multiculturalism" is in
need of a definition.
"I would like anybody, any
body to point to anything I did
that suggests that I'm not com
mitted to multiculturalism,
whatever it means," he said. "I
have been going to the dorms
and trying to get a discussion
going on what exactly do we
mean."
However, several people have
voiced concern over Parker's
sudden resignation three weeks
ago and the planned review of

Provost Gerald Lieberman meets with Casper In front of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral
Sciences last summer to prepare the new President for the issues he would confront.

Nobody said being a university pres
ident was easy.
After nine months at Stanford's
helm, Gerhard Casper has found this
to be particularly true.
Assuming a very public role at one of
the nation's most visible universities,
Casper has found the move from be
hind-the-scenes administrative roles
at the low-key University of Chicago a
definite challenge.
Thrust from the academic positions
of dean and provost at Chicago —
where he dealt with twice as many
graduate students as undergraduates
and a less diverse student body — the
transition to becoming Stanford's top
administrator has been quite a change.
Casper found out quickly since tak
ing over Sept. 1 that being Stanford's
president, especially after the indirect
cost scandal, has meant his every state
ment and action comes under intense
public scrutiny.
"On the day before the inaugura
tion, the local press here speculated
what I would be saying in my inaugur
al speech, but Ithe press in Chicago]
wouldn't have reported my inaugural
speech after I delivered it," Casper said
in an interview last week with The
Daily.
Even compared to the presidency of
the well-respected University of Chica
go, he said, "there is much more con
centration here on the president."
The demands have sometimes been
frustrating. At a recent Faculty Senate
meeting, Casper became visibly discon
certed by a comment that students felt
he was unresponsive to their concerns.

While recognizing that his adminis
tration is not perfect, Casper said it is

concerns students may have had about
their new president.
According to a poll conducted by
The Daily, nearly half of 403 students
surveyed approve of the way Casper
has handled the presidency, while
only 11 percent disapprove of how he
is doing.
And when asked what they consid
ered to be Casper's most significant ac
complishment this year, the majority
of students who could identify one said
that he had been successful in keeping
Stanford out of the public eye. Nearly
half of the students polled said they
thought Casper's one year has im
proved Stanford's image.
"The morale of faculty, alumni, staff
and many students has been tremen

had a significant impact on the
people I work with within the
government," said Chief Finan
cial Officer Peter Van Etten.
"They were very impressed."
Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said Casper has decreased
the anxiety level on campus,
especially regarding financial
issues.
Casper said he has spent a lot
of time with alumni and govern
ment officials to rectify Stan
ford's image after the indirect
cost controversy.
However, Casper added that
he is "not in the image business.
I'm not trying to correct an
image out there. I just want peo
ple to be professional in the way
they perceive Stanford.
"We have our warts and I'm
not opposed to people reporting
our warts. I just want people to
give us a fair shake," he added.
However, Casper is also very
aware that the way he handles
issues influences policy out
comes. For example, he said he
purposely did not make a state
ment about last December's
domestic-partners benefits con
troversy because he did not want
to speak out and create any
potential conflict with the Board
of Trustees.
Instead, he chose to work qui
etly behind the scenes and just
let the policy that had been in
formation for two years "run its
course."
A host of changes
In many other areas, though,
Casper has decided to be more
vocal, implementing changes
that have raised concerns — and
garnered praise — throughout
the University.

Some of the changes began as
soon as he came into office. Reor
ganizing the large administra
tion that had been gradually
established under Donald
Kennedy, he eliminated some of
the top positions — including six
vice-presidential positions — so
that upper-level power was cen
tralized around the offices of the
president and the provost.

'We have our warts
and I'm not opposed
to people reporting
our warts. I just want
people to give us a
fair shake.'
— Gerhard Casper

As the year went on, he pro
posed evaluations of areas
including undergraduate educa
tion, the University's conflict of
interest and commitment poli
cies, the judicial policy and the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment. In addition, he created a
Medical Center task force and
the position of assistant dean of
graduate policy to allay fears
that graduate student concerns
were not being addressed by
administrators.
Now at the end of the year,
with the appointments of Politi
cal Science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice as provost and Economics
Prof. John Shoven as the dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, Casper has created an
almost completely new top
administration.
Some faculty members have
expressed concern that Casper's
administrative reorganization

has given him too much control.
"Gerhard Casper has quietly
and slowly cleaned house and
has now created his own staff of
advisers and aides," said History
Prof. Barton Bernstein. "He
seems to be someone who wants
a great sense of control."
Faculty Senate Chair William
Northway, however, supported
Casper's administrative reorga
nization.
"It's hard to redo the system
without concentrating power
and using this power," he said.
This control, some feel, has
extended to the Campus Report,
the newspaper published by the
University News Service.
With the elimination of the
vice president of public relations,
the editor of news service now
directly reports to Casper, a rela
tionship which some feel is too
restrictive.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz
feels that Casper has "seized
control" of Campus Report,
which has taken away the free
dom of the publication.
"If there is negative news, it
must be put into a long-term
positive context," Rebholz
added.
A few staff members have
even taken to calling it "Casper's
Report."
Casper rejects the criticism
that he has given himself too
much control through adminis
trative reorganization.
Saying that he would not have
been able to survive his first year
without delegating authority,
Casper added that "you cannot
micro-manage a university.
"The real power in a universi
ty is not in the president's office
. . . real decisions are made at
the local level. I haven't any
power to manage if I wanted to,
but I do want my own staff to be
professional."
'Will the students be heard?'
A vocal student minority
would like to see Casper's staff
become more responsive to stu
dent concerns.
While only about one-fifth of
students polled by The Daily
believe Casper has not been
responsive to student concerns,
students' frustration with the
administration was visibly
demonstrated Thursday at a
teach-in in White Plaza.
The rally — titled "The
Changing State of the Universi
ty: Will the students be
heard?"— drew about 100 stu
dents and a handful of adminis
trators who listened to speeches
advocating a greater student
voice in University decisions.
"One of the things we'd like to
see more is a greater amount of
contact between Casper and stu
dents," said junior Ron Brown, a
Council of Presidents member.
"I understand that the job of
being president is significant and
that time constraints can limit
the amount of time the president
can spend, but I hope that stu
dents remain an important pri
ority with the office of the presi
dent."
While recognizing that Casper
has a busy schedule, sophomore

Anietie Ekanem, one of the
teach-in organizers, said Casper
relates well with the administra
tion, "but his student-relations
side must improve for the Uni
versity to improve."
Brown said he believes "if the
lack of student input in adminis
trative activities continues, we'll
assume that's desired. It is
appropriate to give the president
a certain amount of grace period,

If the lack of student input in administrative
activities continues, we'll assume that's
desired. It is appropriate to give the presi
dent a certain amount of grace period, to let
him establish a presence. That grace period
is coming to an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student body.'
— Ron Brown

to let him establish a presence.
That grace period is coming to
an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student
body."
Casper said he has tried this
year to remain open to student
opinion, as he has been to "zil
lions of dorms and other settings
for input and points of view."
Noting that he works most
days from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
Casper said he is often "very
frustrated" with the time con
straints that he has to work
under, specifically pointing to
the 10-minute time periods he
was limited to during his one
day visit to campus ethnic cen
ters.

Casper said he also feels that
he has been unfairly placed into
a paradoxical no-win situation.
"If I say something, I get crit
icized for listening; if I listen, I
get criticized for not saying
something."
Defining multiculturalism
Despite his attempts to garner
student feedback, some mem
bers of the Stanford community

fear that Casper is taking steps
toward reversing progress made
in multiculturalism over the
past few years.
In fact, only 33 percent of stu
dents have a favorable opinion of
the way he has handled multicul
tural issues, according to the
Daily poll.
"There have been a number of
events, changes in the Universi
ty which have set a certain atmo
sphere which is not very friendly
toward multicultural educa
tion," said Patty Tsai, a member
of Asian/Pacific Islanders for
Education and Change at Stan
ford. Tsai pointed to a draft of
the University Cabinet's critical
response to the 1991 University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and the resignation of for
mer Office of Multicultural Edu
cation Director Sharon Parker
as two such events.
Assoc. Dean of Students Jim
Larimore, who serves as the
director of the American Indian
Program Office, said part of peo
ple's concern stems from the fact
that "there is still some ambigu

ity or question about what direc
tion the president and other
senior administrators want to go
in.
"There just hasn't been a
clear, concise statement of prin
ciple or belief," he added.
Instead, Casper has focused
his attention in other areas, said
Rick Yuen, the director of the
Asian American Activities Cen
ter. "Casper will have different
priorities [from Kennedy]. His
priority so far that I have seen is
repairing the relationship with
the government," he said.
"He hasn't articulated any
other priorities. Maybe that's
why there is tension. Any time
people don't see themselves in
priorities, they tend to worry,"
Yuen added.
However, the fact that Casper
has been at Stanford less than a
year has made some others cau
tious about final judgements.
"People are getting too hung
up on trying to compare the
Kennedy administration and
what they've accrued in 10 years
and Casper's administration and
what they've done in one year,"
said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
The Stanford community has
become too attached to multicul
turalism on the surface, he said,
without bothering to find out
what the concept really means.
"We're getting too stuck on
terms," he added. "While the
term multiculturalism has
meaning in terms of trying to
help us develop another way of
life, in a way we're stuck on the
term."
Casper has said he feels the
term "multiculturalism" is in
need of a definition.
"I would like anybody, any
body to point to anything I did
that suggests that I'm not com
mitted to multiculturalism,
whatever it means," he said. "I
have been going to the dorms
and trying to get a discussion
going on what exactly do we
mean."
However, several people have
voiced concern over Parker's
sudden resignation three weeks
ago and the planned review of

Provost Gerald Lieberman meets with Casper In front of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral
Sciences last summer to prepare the new President for the issues he would confront.

Nobody said being a university pres
ident was easy.
After nine months at Stanford's
helm, Gerhard Casper has found this
to be particularly true.
Assuming a very public role at one of
the nation's most visible universities,
Casper has found the move from be
hind-the-scenes administrative roles
at the low-key University of Chicago a
definite challenge.
Thrust from the academic positions
of dean and provost at Chicago —
where he dealt with twice as many
graduate students as undergraduates
and a less diverse student body — the
transition to becoming Stanford's top
administrator has been quite a change.
Casper found out quickly since tak
ing over Sept. 1 that being Stanford's
president, especially after the indirect
cost scandal, has meant his every state
ment and action comes under intense
public scrutiny.
"On the day before the inaugura
tion, the local press here speculated
what I would be saying in my inaugur
al speech, but Ithe press in Chicago]
wouldn't have reported my inaugural
speech after I delivered it," Casper said
in an interview last week with The
Daily.
Even compared to the presidency of
the well-respected University of Chica
go, he said, "there is much more con
centration here on the president."
The demands have sometimes been
frustrating. At a recent Faculty Senate
meeting, Casper became visibly discon
certed by a comment that students felt
he was unresponsive to their concerns.

While recognizing that his adminis
tration is not perfect, Casper said it is
comments such as these that bother
him the most.
"Very few people bother to find out
what the true facts are," he said.
"There are certain images created and
then they are very hard to overcome. . .
. I am bothered when people make alle
gations without having tried to estab
lish the facts."

'Very few people bother
to find out what the true
facts are. There are cer
tain images created and
then they are very hard to
overcome.... I am both
ered when people make
allegations without having
tried to establish the facts.'
— Gerhard Casper

. Among faculty and students, reac
tion to Casper's first year of leadership
has been mixed. He has been praised
for calling for re-evaluations of a num
ber of the University's established in
stitutions — such as undergraduate
education and the administration —
and for improving Stanford's public
image.
At the same time, some of his ac
tions — or lack of action in some cases

— have generated criticism from
those who do not like the perceived di
rection the changes are heading.
Stanford has not "been very accept
ing of someone new who is raising new
questions," said Jean Fetter, Casper's
special assistant and a former dean of
admissions. "There is a suspicion of the
unknown . . . some are suspicious be
cause of what is unknown."

of time with alumni and govern
ment officials to rectify Stan
ford's image after the indirect
cost controversy.
However, Casper added that
he is "not in the image business.
I'm not trying to correct an
image out there. I just want peo
ple to be professional in the way
they perceive Stanford.
"We have our warts and I'm
not opposed to people reporting
our warts. I just want people to
give us a fair shake," he added.
However, Casper is also very
aware that the way he handles
issues influences policy out
comes. For example, he said he
purposely did not make a state
ment about last December's
domestic-partners benefits con
troversy because he did not want
to speak out and create any
potential conflict with the Board
of Trustees.
Instead, he chose to work qui
etly behind the scenes and just
let the policy that had been in
formation for two years "run its
course."
A host of changes
In many other areas, though,
Casper has decided to be more
vocal, implementing changes
that have raised concerns — and
garnered praise — throughout
the University.

Some of the changes began as
soon as he came into office. Reor
ganizing the large administra
tion that had been gradually
established under Donald
Kennedy, he eliminated some of
the top positions — including six
vice-presidential positions — so
that upper-level power was cen
tralized around the offices of the
president and the provost.

'We have our warts
and I'm not opposed
to people reporting
our warts. I just want
people to give us a
fair shake.'

As the year went on, he pro
posed evaluations of areas
including undergraduate educa
tion, the University's conflict of
interest and commitment poli
cies, the judicial policy and the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment. In addition, he created a
Medical Center task force and
the position of assistant dean of
graduate policy to allay fears
that graduate student concerns
were not being addressed by
administrators.
Now at the end of the year,
with the appointments of Politi
cal Science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice as provost and Economics
Prof. John Shoven as the dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, Casper has created an
almost completely new top
administration.
Some faculty members have
expressed concern that Casper's
administrative reorganization

has given him too much control.
"Gerhard Casper has quietly
and slowly cleaned house and
has now created his own staff of
advisers and aides," said History
Prof. Barton Bernstein. "He
seems to be someone who wants
a great sense of control."
Faculty Senate Chair William
Northway, however, supported
Casper's administrative reorga
nization.
"It's hard to redo the system
without concentrating power
and using this power," he said.
This control, some feel, has
extended to the Campus Report,
the newspaper published by the
University News Service.
With the elimination of the
vice president of public relations,
the editor of news service now
directly reports to Casper, a rela
tionship which some feel is too
restrictive.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz
feels that Casper has "seized
control" of Campus Report,
which has taken away the free
dom of the publication.
"If there is negative news, it
must be put into a long-term
positive context," Rebholz
added.
A few staff members have
even taken to calling it "Casper's
Report."
Casper rejects the criticism
that he has given himself too
much control through adminis
trative reorganization.
Saying that he would not have
been able to survive his first year
without delegating authority,
Casper added that "you cannot
micro-manage a university.
"The real power in a universi
ty is not in the president's office
. . . real decisions are made at
the local level. I haven't any
power to manage if I wanted to,
but I do want my own staff to be
professional."
'Will the students be heard?'
A vocal student minority
would like to see Casper's staff
become more responsive to stu
dent concerns.
While only about one-fifth of
students polled by The Daily
believe Casper has not been
responsive to student concerns,
students' frustration with the
administration was visibly
demonstrated Thursday at a
teach-in in White Plaza.
The rally — titled "The
Changing State of the Universi
ty: Will the students be
heard?"— drew about 100 stu
dents and a handful of adminis
trators who listened to speeches
advocating a greater student
voice in University decisions.
"One of the things we'd like to
see more is a greater amount of
contact between Casper and stu
dents," said junior Ron Brown, a
Council of Presidents member.
"I understand that the job of
being president is significant and
that time constraints can limit
the amount of time the president
can spend, but I hope that stu
dents remain an important pri
ority with the office of the presi
dent."
While recognizing that Casper
has a busy schedule, sophomore

Anietie Ekanem, one of the
teach-in organizers, said Casper
relates well with the administra
tion, "but his student-relations
side must improve for the Uni
versity to improve."
Brown said he believes "if the
lack of student input in adminis
trative activities continues, we'll
assume that's desired. It is
appropriate to give the president
a certain amount of grace period,

If the lack of student input in administrative
activities continues, we'll assume that's
desired. It is appropriate to give the presi
dent a certain amount of grace period, to let
him establish a presence. That grace period
is coming to an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student body.'
— Ron Brown

to let him establish a presence.
That grace period is coming to
an end; we'll see next year what
he has to offer the student
body."
Casper said he has tried this
year to remain open to student
opinion, as he has been to "zil
lions of dorms and other settings
for input and points of view."
Noting that he works most
days from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
Casper said he is often "very
frustrated" with the time con
straints that he has to work
under, specifically pointing to
the 10-minute time periods he
was limited to during his one
day visit to campus ethnic cen
ters.

Casper said he also feels that
he has been unfairly placed into
a paradoxical no-win situation.
"If I say something, I get crit
icized for listening; if I listen, I
get criticized for not saying
something."
Defining multiculturalism
Despite his attempts to garner
student feedback, some mem
bers of the Stanford community

fear that Casper is taking steps
toward reversing progress made
in multiculturalism over the
past few years.
In fact, only 33 percent of stu
dents have a favorable opinion of
the way he has handled multicul
tural issues, according to the
Daily poll.
"There have been a number of
events, changes in the Universi
ty which have set a certain atmo
sphere which is not very friendly
toward multicultural educa
tion," said Patty Tsai, a member
of Asian/Pacific Islanders for
Education and Change at Stan
ford. Tsai pointed to a draft of
the University Cabinet's critical
response to the 1991 University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and the resignation of for
mer Office of Multicultural Edu
cation Director Sharon Parker
as two such events.
Assoc. Dean of Students Jim
Larimore, who serves as the
director of the American Indian
Program Office, said part of peo
ple's concern stems from the fact
that "there is still some ambigu

ity or question about what direc
tion the president and other
senior administrators want to go
in.
"There just hasn't been a
clear, concise statement of prin
ciple or belief," he added.
Instead, Casper has focused
his attention in other areas, said
Rick Yuen, the director of the
Asian American Activities Cen
ter. "Casper will have different
priorities [from Kennedy]. His
priority so far that I have seen is
repairing the relationship with
the government," he said.
"He hasn't articulated any
other priorities. Maybe that's
why there is tension. Any time
people don't see themselves in
priorities, they tend to worry,"
Yuen added.
However, the fact that Casper
has been at Stanford less than a
year has made some others cau
tious about final judgements.
"People are getting too hung
up on trying to compare the
Kennedy administration and
what they've accrued in 10 years
and Casper's administration and
what they've done in one year,"
said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
The Stanford community has
become too attached to multicul
turalism on the surface, he said,
without bothering to find out
what the concept really means.
"We're getting too stuck on
terms," he added. "While the
term multiculturalism has
meaning in terms of trying to
help us develop another way of
life, in a way we're stuck on the
term."
Casper has said he feels the
term "multiculturalism" is in
need of a definition.
"I would like anybody, any
body to point to anything I did
that suggests that I'm not com
mitted to multiculturalism,
whatever it means," he said. "I
have been going to the dorms
and trying to get a discussion
going on what exactly do we
mean."
However, several people have
voiced concern over Parker's
sudden resignation three weeks
ago and the planned review of
