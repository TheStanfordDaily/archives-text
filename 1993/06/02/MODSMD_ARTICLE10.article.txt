Guatemalan president ousted
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -
Guatemala's powerful army ousted Pres
ident Jorge Serrano yesterday, a week
after he dissolved parliament and
imposed one-man rule.
Initially, lawmakers said Defense Min
ister Gen. Jose Domingo Garcia
Samayoatook over the government yes
terday morning, and was negotiating
with members of the dissolved Congress
to elect a successor.
Late in the day, however, a govern
ment communique said Vice President
Gustavo Espina Salguero would assume
presidential duties until new elections
could be called.
It said Congress and and the Supreme
Court, disbanded by Serrano last week,
would remain dissolved.
The communique said Serrano was
"separated from his responsibilities in an
action invoked by the army, private
enterprise and political parties."
The mass opposition to Serrano's dec
laration of one-man rule May 25 under

lined widespread support among
Guatemalans for democracy and a
refusal to accept a return to dictatorship.
There were no reports of violence in the
capital.
Harassment harms students
WASHINGTON (AP) - Four out of
five teen-agers say they have been sexual
ly harassed at school — targets of con
duct ranging from rumors to physical
assault, according to a survey of eighth
through llth-graders.
The national study of 1,600 students
found that harassment frequently starts
in elementary school, that few of the vic
tims ever report it and that the emotion
al impact, particularly on girls, is serious
and widespread.
More than one in 10 of those surveyed
reported being forced by either fellow stu
dents or adults to engage in sexual con
duct beyond kissing. Thirteen percent of
girls and 9 percent of boys said they had
experienced this unwelcome sexual
behavior.
