# Clinton to accept compromise
## Budget may pass more easily with Senate cuts intact 
### 
MILWAUKEE (AP) - Sounding a
populist theme, President Clinton
promised to accept deeper budget cuts
and less taxes in his deficit-reduction
plan yesterday but implored the Senate
not to go too far.
"Everybody would like to do all this
with less tax and more budget cuts, but
look behind the rhetoric," the president
urged.
Clinton traveled to America's heart
land to deliver a speech at the Milwau
kee convention center opening his cam
paign for Senate passage of the $500
billion deficit-reduction package
approved by a razor-thin margin in the
House last week.
He refused to say how far he would
compromise with the Senate, but he
made clear he would accept less than he
had initially proposed. White House
press secretary Dee Dee Myers said,
"The initiative has to come from the
Senate. They'll come to us and we'll
work with them."

"You can cut all the spending you
want, and if people don't have jobs and
they aren't earning money, we're still
not going to be able to balance the bud
get," Clinton cautioned. "So let's keep
the economic future of the country
uppermost in our minds."
Myers said it would be difficult to
slash the energy tax. "That revenue is
important to maintaining and meeting
the president's deficit-reduction goals,"
she said.
The message of the day was that
Clinton was ready to compromise, up to
a point.
"We'll cut the taxes and have more
spending cuts next week," the president
told an audience of several thousand
people, "but when we do it let's leave
the money in there that will shape
these children's economic future."
The speech was designed in part to
redefine Clinton as a moderate Demo
crat in touch with the middle class, not
a tax-and-spend social liberal who has

"gone Hollywood" with an expensive
haircut.
"He was trying to pull the lens back
and talk about the principles of the
campaign," said political strategist Paul
Begala. "This is, in my mind, the presi
dent getting back to the vision and val
ues of the campaign."
Indeed, the 45-minute speech was a
reprise of the populist themes of his
presidential campaign and an in-depth
tutorial on his economic theories. He
decried "trickle-down economics" of the
Reagan-Bush era and soaring deficits.
And he called for health care for all
Americans and investments in the
country's future.
Setting out markers, Clinton said that
any budget plan has to cut the deficit by
at least $500 billion over five years and
that tax increases should be tilted against
the wealthy rather than the middle class.
He also said incentives for welfare reform
should be preserved, along with incen
tives for economic growth.
