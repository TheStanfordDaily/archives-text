## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's Farewell Sentiment matters 
### 
Your days are short here; this is
the last of your springs. And now,
in the serenity and quiet of this
lovely place, touch the depths of
truth, feel the hem of Heaven. You
will go away with old, good friends.
And don't forget when you leave
why you came.
— Adlai Stevenson, in a famous
commencement coda
The Daily 's newsroom is rarely a
serene and quiet place, and few who
have visited our quarters would
characterize them as "lovely." Per
haps even fewer would suggest that
The Daily is a place where the
depths of truth can be touched, let
alone feel the hem of Heaven.
But — as any newspaper person
worth her salt knows — appear
ances can be misleading. For in the
dinge of this office, I have uncovered
some truths, learned many lessons
and experienced the friendship of
many people. Each day, for the past
year, I have come to this hub of hus
tle and bustle and faced its successes
and failures, its difficult decisions
and incessant challenges.
In the wee hours of the morning,
when this cavern that has become
my home is deserted and I am alone,
I sometimes reflect upon my day's
labors. These may range from cor
recting misspellings, to meeting
with community leaders and irate
readers, to debating whether it's
appropriate to superimpose Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper's
head on a half-naked body. Nine
days out of 10,1 am overwhelmed by
my good fortune in being handed my
unique responsibilities. The other
day, I just collapse.
Though I never expected to, it is
in this inauspicious space that I
have learned the lessons I came to
college to learn. Why it was here, I
don't know. But it was here where I
have been disappointed and disap
pointed others. In this office I have
fought with and nurtured the same
people, set goals and met them, been
the victim and the beneficiary of pol
itics, chewed out editors, scrapped
stories, stood up for others and
myself, admitted wrongs, crystal
ized my values, laughed, cried and
loved. And it's been great.

To my co-workers, I say the plea
sure has been all mine. Your dedica
tion and creativity have been inspir
ing and humbling. Your accomplish
ments have been my pride, and your
shortcomings have simply prodded
me to try harder. For I have always
considered you my partners and
nothing less, and as I see you
preparing to take greater responsi
bilities, I am fulfilled.
To those that have come before
me, I say thank you for investing in
me, for encouraging me and believ
ing in me. To my parents, who know
little of my work here, thank you for
simply letting go of me and letting
me do what I thought was right.
And to the one who knew all, who
held my hand and kicked my butt at
the same time, I hope I can repay
even half the favor next year.
As my "Daily spring" wanes
before me, I leave my post bitter
sweetly. Next year I will return to
civilian life as a student, forced to
reacclimate to a life that now seems
foreign to me. I have little desire to
leave my duties here, and it will take
effort to exit gracefully.
I take solace in a few words
offered at last year's commence
ment by someone who surely knows
more than I about giving up some
thing one loves — Donald Kennedy.
He said:
"Stanford is a beautiful, friendly,
vivid place. Give a thought to friend
ships, to idle times passed, to the
green hills behind Lake Lag on an
afternoon when breezy sunshine fol
lows a March rain ... to the extraor
dinary person you admired and then
discovered was just as shy as you
were. Reflect on these treasures and
store them, because sentiment mat
ters."
Though my treasures are slightly
different, today I am full of senti
ment, and I am comforted to know
that someone else thinks it matters.
Because I certainly do.
