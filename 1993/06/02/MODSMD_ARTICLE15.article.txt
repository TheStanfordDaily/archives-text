## The
						college experience 
### 
DOES COLLEGE REALLY change
anyone? I mean, sure, after four
years and about $100,000 you get a
piece of paper that declares you intellec
tually viable. And lots of recruiters from
the real world seem to believe that you're
professionally viable. And you get letters
from car companies who suddenly think
you're financially viable.
But how did that happen? How did
we so quickly become such great people?
Honestly, I think that we have them all
fooled, or at least I do. My ability to bal
ance my checkbook, or drive a car or
whatever else I'll be spending most of
my life doing hasn't changed dramati
cally in four years.
Yet college has changed me. Immea
surably. I think that it's changed us all,
but in ways other people can't see so
clearly.
I came from a small, secluded town
and a background of stagnant thinking
into a place as diverse as a Bangkok
marketplace. But as a senior, I think I
know less now than I did four years ago.
I came in as a naive freshman think
ing I knew a lot. I'd finished high school
with what I thought was a pretty
darned good academic record. And more
that that, I was smart. And talented.
Now, four years later, I realize that in
every area there is someone, oftentimes
right down the hall, who is smarter
than me, and has done everything I
have, but better.

As a freshman, I thought that I was
destined to be somebody important. My
name would be known world-wide for
something life-changing I was surely
going to do. Now, I realize I will be plen
ty successful just to land a job I enjoy.
Never mind the notion that I'll be
famous and do something so terribly
important.
As a freshman, I thought that if
enough people knew me, I would be suc
cessful. Now I know that one becomes
shallow while striving to "know" as
many people as possible, rather than
concentrating on true friendships. My
relationships are precious, but some
how contaminated as soon as I start
using them for myself.
As a freshman, I thought that if I
made enough money I would be happy.
Now I know that looking at happiness
as a function of money is like looking at
intelligence as a function of good
grades. All I really want in life is a fam
ily; if I have enough money to support
them, then I will be successful.
So many people see happiness as
some brass ring they'll grab sometime
in the future if they push all the right
buttons. Right job, right friends, right
habits, etc. But I say we have to be
happy right now.
And I am. Because I have good
friends, I'm healthy and I am at peace.
Because I know there's someone a lot
smarter than I am in the driver's seat.

As a freshman, I thought that this
Jesus guy was a vaguely interesting fel
low; I fancied myself a Christian
because I went to church on Sunday and
believed in God. Now, four years later,
this same Jesus guy is the center of my
life. Being Christian means that I try
every day to inch closer and closer to
Christ, in my motives, my relationships,
my actions and my heart. And I'll tell
you something â€” that is the secret of
my success.
I want to encourage you to find suc
cess for yourself as well. Look around.
And think. Think, think, think. Think
about yourself, and why you do what
you do. Think about others, and please
give some credence to that "do unto oth
ers" thing. Think about the world you
live in, and be aware of what's going on
around you. Don't take anyone's
thoughts for granted; never alienate
yourself from any ideas. Be open-mind
ed, be observant, be careful and be wise.
And be happy.
We can all change in the course of
our lives. And what's more, we should.

Mike Langford is grateful for his colum
nist experience and had learned a lot. He
hopes you have, too. Thank you and God
