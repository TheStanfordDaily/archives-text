# Joel Stein
## Three years, 70 columns and two very angry women 
### 
i WANTED TO BE HUGE.
T wanted people to stop me on the way
to class and ask me where I get my hair
done. I wanted to walk by women and
make them blush, and maybe trip and
fall into a big vat of mud where they'd
wrestle. I wanted to be Jimmy Stewart
at the end of "It's a Wonderful Life,"
only less appreciative. I wanted this
because Andrew Berkowitz had it.
Andrew Berkowitz was The Daily's
humor columnist until the middle of
my freshman year, and I hated him. I
hated him the way people hate Bob
Saget. I hated him with the same quiet,
crazed, incomprehensible jealousy as
when other people look at your own
personal copy of Playboy.
People never talked about what
Berkowitz wrote. They didn't say
things like, "That column about firm
buttocks made me think about my own
buttocks and how much firmer they
could be." What they said was how
funny he was and how cool he seemed.
And that's why I hated him.
The Tao to Nowhere
One morning during my sophomore
year, just two weeks after my disem
bodied head floated through page four
aesthetically and sublimely, a guy
walked up to me at Flo Mo brunch and
asked me if I was Joel Stein. I immedi
ately started to apologize for my behav
ior and explain how I had no idea she
had such a large older brother.
• Then he started to talk about the
kinds of things I had been thinking
about lately, like body oil and mastur
bation, and how, according to the
woman at the sperm bank, the twain
shouldn't meet.

He really thought he knew me, and
in a strange way, he did. Then he
touched my knee, and I decided I had
just about enough quesadilla for the
afternoon, if you know what I mean.
Three years and more than 70
columns later, the campus feels a lot
smaller to me than it really is. Instead
of standing at the back of fraternity
parties and making fun of drunk peo
ple, drunk people come up to me and
let me make fun of them to their face.
Life has been good.
Notes from a Rebel Lemming
I never used my last name, except on
checks, when I spelled it "Stn." But
now people introduce me by my full
name. And when they do, for a second I
don't feel like me anymore. I feel like
the columnist guy and I say things like
"nice breasts." It's not good for any
one. Especially my left cheek.
Too often people expected me to be
the column guy in person, all too often
I fell as flat and unsmooth as David
Letterman interviewing a supermodel
with cleavage.
The columnist I became was two
steps gutsier than I am and four steps
more radical. Sometimes he pops up in
my real life, like at home this summer,
when Mom told me not to refer to her
ability to lactate and sent me to my
room without dessert.
Last week at the Coffee House, I
walked by two women I never met
arguing over whether I was a jerk or
not. I grabbed a seat nearby and lis
tened quietly. By the end of conversa
tion, I was convinced that I was,
indeed, a jerk, but that I would proba
bly learn and grow and make a wonder
ful husband someday for a very lucky
woman. The second part came from
me.
As I left, I walked by their table and
smiled. They smiled back, but in a
painful, grimacing way, like Chelsea

Clinton trying to hide her braces. But
somehow I didn't care what they
thought, as long as they were talking
about me, making me a small part of
their life, their extended family, their
paroled uncle, if you will. The kind of
family Faulkner would write about.
But for the most part, people have
been kind to me. They laughed at what
I said, even if it wasn't funny. Even if I
didn't mean it to be funny. "A flat tire!
You slay me, Stein. A flat tire! Who
would think?" I didn't like those peo
ple.
For these three years I got to be
someone I never can be, and wouldn't
really want to be, if only to people who
don't know me. And to a couple of
women, but that might have happened
anyway.
Aphorisms that Smudge
I've grown accustomed to people
walking up to me and saying that they
liked my column, you know, the one
you wrote last week, what was it on
again? And I don't mind and some
times I don't remember myself. I just
like that they read it. That they like
me.
I never stopped feeling lucky to have
this experience, like I never stopped
feeling lucky that society lets men
make vaguely suggestive comments
when looking through Cosmo maga
zines in the company of women.
When I came to Stanford, I never
thought I would feel so much a part of
the community. I also thought I'd get a
lot more play, but hey, a tradeoffs a
tradeoff. In fact, I think, if I could do it
all over again, I'd take the experience I
had over the play. But don't tell any
body.
Starting tomorrow, I'm heading out
into a cold world, anonymous like a
woman and alone like a man. (Isn't
that the Maryland state motto?) Over
the last three years, I was able to recre

ate the small town I was never from
and I'm going to miss it like I've never
missed anyplace before, even my moth
er's womb.
Guess I'll just go to my room now.

Joel Stein is glad to rid himself of your
constant pestering. His column will no
longer appear here, so you'll have to
entertain yourself in other ways. Please
be careful.

I fell as flat and unsmooth as David
Letterman interviewing a supermodel
with cleavage.
The columnist I became was two
steps gutsier than I am and four steps
more radical. Sometimes he pops up in
my real life, like at home this summer,
when Mom told me not to refer to her
ability to lactate and sent me to my
room without dessert.
Last week at the Coffee House, I
walked by two women I never met
arguing over whether I was a jerk or
not. I grabbed a seat nearby and lis
tened quietly. By the end of conversa
tion, I was convinced that I was,
indeed, a jerk, but that I would proba
bly learn and grow and make a wonder
ful husband someday for a very lucky
woman. The second part came from
me.
As I left, I walked by their table and
smiled. They smiled back, but in a
painful, grimacing way, like Chelsea

Clinton trying to hide her braces. But
somehow I didn't care what they
thought, as long as they were talking
about me, making me a small part of
their life, their extended family, their
paroled uncle, if you will. The kind of
family Faulkner would write about.
But for the most part, people have
been kind to me. They laughed at what
I said, even if it wasn't funny. Even if I
didn't mean it to be funny. "A flat tire!
You slay me, Stein. A flat tire! Who
would think?" I didn't like those peo
ple.
For these three years I got to be
someone I never can be, and wouldn't
really want to be, if only to people who
don't know me. And to a couple of
women, but that might have happened
anyway.
Aphorisms that Smudge
I've grown accustomed to people
walking up to me and saying that they
liked my column, you know, the one
you wrote last week, what was it on
again? And I don't mind and some
times I don't remember myself. I just
like that they read it. That they like
me.
I never stopped feeling lucky to have
this experience, like I never stopped
feeling lucky that society lets men
make vaguely suggestive comments
when looking through Cosmo maga
zines in the company of women.
When I came to Stanford, I never
thought I would feel so much a part of
the community. I also thought I'd get a
lot more play, but hey, a tradeoffs a
tradeoff. In fact, I think, if I could do it
all over again, I'd take the experience I
had over the play. But don't tell any
body.
Starting tomorrow, I'm heading out
into a cold world, anonymous like a
woman and alone like a man. (Isn't
that the Maryland state motto?) Over
the last three years, I was able to recre

ate the small town I was never from
and I'm going to miss it like I've never
missed anyplace before, even my moth
er's womb.
Guess I'll just go to my room now.

Joel Stein is glad to rid himself of your
constant pestering. His column will no
longer appear here, so you'll have to
entertain yourself in other ways. Please
be careful.

i WANTED TO BE HUGE.
T wanted people to stop me on the way
to class and ask me where I get my hair
done. I wanted to walk by women and
make them blush, and maybe trip and
fall into a big vat of mud where they'd
wrestle. I wanted to be Jimmy Stewart
at the end of "It's a Wonderful Life,"
only less appreciative. I wanted this
because Andrew Berkowitz had it.
Andrew Berkowitz was The Daily's
humor columnist until the middle of
my freshman year, and I hated him. I
hated him the way people hate Bob
Saget. I hated him with the same quiet,
crazed, incomprehensible jealousy as
when other people look at your own
personal copy of Playboy.
People never talked about what
Berkowitz wrote. They didn't say
things like, "That column about firm
buttocks made me think about my own
buttocks and how much firmer they
could be." What they said was how
funny he was and how cool he seemed.
And that's why I hated him.
The Tao to Nowhere
One morning during my sophomore
year, just two weeks after my disem
bodied head floated through page four
aesthetically and sublimely, a guy
walked up to me at Flo Mo brunch and
asked me if I was Joel Stein. I immedi
ately started to apologize for my behav
ior and explain how I had no idea she
had such a large older brother.
• Then he started to talk about the
kinds of things I had been thinking
about lately, like body oil and mastur
bation, and how, according to the
woman at the sperm bank, the twain
shouldn't meet.

He really thought he knew me, and
in a strange way, he did. Then he
touched my knee, and I decided I had
just about enough quesadilla for the
afternoon, if you know what I mean.
Three years and more than 70
columns later, the campus feels a lot
smaller to me than it really is. Instead
of standing at the back of fraternity
parties and making fun of drunk peo
ple, drunk people come up to me and
let me make fun of them to their face.
Life has been good.
Notes from a Rebel Lemming
I never used my last name, except on
checks, when I spelled it "Stn." But
now people introduce me by my full
name. And when they do, for a second I
don't feel like me anymore. I feel like
the columnist guy and I say things like
"nice breasts." It's not good for any
one. Especially my left cheek.
Too often people expected me to be
the column guy in person, all too often
I fell as flat and unsmooth as David
Letterman interviewing a supermodel
with cleavage.
