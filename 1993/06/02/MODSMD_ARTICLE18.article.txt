# The
						truth about special fees
## 
### Michael Grant 
SINCE THE ASSU elections
in April, the issue of gradu
ate-student special fees has
become a hot topic once again. Is
the special fee some type of
unfair taxation of students?
The editorial board of The
Stanford Daily reached a new
level of absurdity in its May 13
editorial, "Segregating the vote,"
by attempting to compare the
ASSU to the federal government
and special fee requests to feder
al taxation.
The ASSU, to its credit, is a
lightweight, dynamic and pliable
construction which we students
have the opportunity to virtually
re-cast every year. To compare it
to the ponderous federal bureau
cracy that continues to grow and
decelerate, and whose tax system
baffles and swindles virtually all
of us, is senseless. The ASSU, an
organization which can discard
its executive branch for a year,
and then re-instate it without
salaries — an organization which
determines its "taxes" by a year
ly popular vote — immediately
distances itself from such a com
parison. Imagine voting on the
size of your income taxes every
four years!
One difference is simple: if we
feel like making major changes to
the structure of student govern
ment and eliminating unfair
"taxation," we can actually do it!
Using the power of election to
effect change in the federal gov
ernment is not "contempt of the
system," and neither is it in this
case. Of course, with the ASSU
we can be much more effective,
and that seems to scare the edito
rial board of The Daily — per
haps since $58,000 of their
income comes from a special-fee
request.
Interestingly, The Daily's
claim that student groups will be
"unnecessarily impacted" is also
unfounded. In fact, more organi
zations would benefit from ASSU
funding under the amended sys
tem. An organization that wins
approval from undergraduates
but not from graduates, or vice
versa, would lose none of its
funding. For example, the Grad
uate Student Association will
receive no money next year

because of inconsiderate under
graduate disapproval. Under the
new system, it would be fully
funded — but only graduate stu
dents would pay for it. This sys
tem favors undergraduate-domi
nated groups as well, of course.
The amendment also provides a
relaxation of the 15 percent
approval requirement, further
increasing the opportunities for
organizations to receive funding.
Is this not a reasonable plan?
Separation of graduate and
undergraduate funding is a suc
cessful component of many other
student organizations at univer
sities across the country, and
their whining newspaper editors
have no complaints.
When any democratic "grass
roots" effort of sorts organizes a

previously unknown political
force, the opposition loves to
bitch and moan — the threat
ened secession of Quebec from
Canada and the United We Stand
Party both come to mind. But I
suggest that The Daily and the
rest of the University learn to
respect and heed opinions of
graduate students, because, in
our case, success is much more
probable. The Daily editorial
board's whining only serves to
unify us more. Perhaps they
would have sided with 18th-cen
tury Britain when Americans
with "contempt of the system"
decided to take matters into their
own hands.
