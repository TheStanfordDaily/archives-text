# Undergrad backs graduate view

### Maria Araceli Campelo 
IN RESPONSE TO The
Daily's editorial on "Segre
gating the vote," the idea
that somehow voting on taxes
for schools and roads is compa
rable to voting for special stu
dent fees is laughable and ludi
crous at best.
Schools do not just benefit a
handful of students and teach
ers; the entire country benefits
from educated citizens who
become productive citizens of
the society. Roads are not just
important for the motorists
that use them; consumers thou
sands of miles away from the
roads benefit by obtaining prod
ucts faster and less expensively.

They improve the country's
infrastructure, which affects
many consumers and business
es, and can benefit the overall
economy. Special services that
may seem to benefit only a frac
tion of the population may actu
ally serve to ensure the well
being and safety of the larger
community.
How can the scope of these
issues compare with the majori
ty of special-fee requests and
their impact here at Stanford? I
agree with Neil Crellin that stu
dents are being taxed for pro
grams that don't affect them. I
hope he and others realize that
it is not only graduate students
who feel this way; many of us
undergraduates are also tired of
a handful of students "playing

government" with our money.
My parents work very hard to
put me through school and the
last thing I need is a handful of
people telling me that I should
give money to groups that do
not interest me or hold views I
do not agree with.
Many people may claim stu
dent groups will be "unneces
sarily impacted." After reading
through every line and page of
the election handbook, it is
apparent that many organiza
tions were asking for more
money than last year, and in
many cases, publicity and trans
portation costs were extremely
high. I am concerned that those
who are being "unnecessarily
impacted" are the students,
graduate and undergraduate,
who end up giving money to
organizations who then have
very little accountability to us,
and therefore little incentive to
reduce their costs.
I do agree with The Daily
that the answer is not to split
the voting pools between gradu
ate and undergraduate stu
dents. I believe that each stu
dent should be able to decide
which individual groups to sup
port, and have any fee assess
ment go directly to those orga
nizations. This would allow us
to help the groups we have an
interest in, and avoid the need
for voting.
Finally, I think many stu
dents, graduate and undergrad
uate alike, are tired of the busi
ness-as-usual political maneu
verers in the ASSU senate.
Bickering over the selection of
the next senate chair were an
ominous sign of stalemate and
gridlock at a time when student
concerns over tuition hikes,
financial aid, and graduation
requirements, for example, are
of paramount importance. I
hope the senators that we, the
student body, elected can realize
we heed a strong voice to repre
sent our concerns with the
administration, and that by con
tinuing to foster divisiveness
and promoting their own per
sonal interests, they are doing
all of us a big disservice.
