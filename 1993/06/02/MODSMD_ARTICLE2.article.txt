## Administrators look to improve communication with students By Andy Dworkin and Grace Lee Editorial staff 
### 
After last week's teach-in that
advocated improved communica
tion between University adminis
trators and students, the two
sides met face-to-face Friday and
began formulating a concrete
plan of action.
Seven students met with Dean
of Students Michael Jackson,
Tresidder Asst. Director Nanci
Howe and Special Assistant to the
President Jean Fetter. All the stu
dents were planners of the teach
in, at which speakers expressed
concern that the University is not
informing students about campus
debates — such as possible
changes in multicultural and un
dergraduate education — or lis
tening to student concerns.
The meeting participants said
great strides were taken toward
more effective student-adminis
tration communication.
"It was a good, frank exchange,
an opportunity for people to meet
each other," Fetter said.
ASSU senator Mork Murdock,
who attended the meeting, said it
"went well in that we started a di
alogue. . . . We got some new an
swers to questions and we got a
commitment to work with [the
administration] in clearing up
communications problems and
access problems."
Specifically, Murdock said, the
students were told that the Uni
versity will place students on
committees that will review the
goals of the Office of Multicultur
al Development and Stanford's
undergraduate education.
Both the administrators and
students also agreed to work to
gether to keep each other in
formed their ideas and concerns.
"Communication with stu
dents at Stanford is a perennial
problem," Fetter said. Because of
this, she added, students and
administrators both need to make
extra effort to talk.
Regarding University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's busy
schedule, "Students do have pri
ority on the president's calen
dar," Fetter said, but "he cannot
respond to every individual

request" for a meeting.
Black Student Union Chair
Anietie Ekanem, one of the
teach-in organizers, said stu
dents will try to stay in touch
with administrators and each
other over the summer to main
tain a voice in campus events.
Murdock said when the teach-in
organizers return in the fall, they
will assess what happened during
the vacation and decide what to
do next.
Ekanem said he thought the

event in White Plaza was the
driving force behind the meeting
with administrators.
"People thought that the
teach-in went really well," he
said. "I think we underestimated
the number of students who
wanted to get involved."
He said the event made admin
istrators listen to student con
cerns. "Three weeks ago I
couldn't get a meeting with them,
and then last week I did,"
Ekanem said.
