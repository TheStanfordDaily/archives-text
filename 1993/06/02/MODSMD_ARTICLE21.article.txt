# On-campus graduate housing remains inadequate and costly
## 
### Neil Crellin 
THE GRADUATE Housing Lottery
took place last week. Less glam
orous than The Draw, entrants
wondered not just where they might live
on campus next year, but whether
they'd live on-campus at all. On-campus
graduate housing is scarce and is becom
ing more so, particularly for continuing
students.
Over 400 graduate students were qui
etly left unassigned in this year's lottery,
yet the Housing Center nonsensically
asserts that an oversupply of graduate
student housing exists. How can this be?
One answer is simple, yet obtaining
housing through the lottery, wait-list
and walk-on process involves unaccept
able levels of uncertainty that graduate
students will not tolerate.
The Housing Center asserts that sup
ply exceeded demand because they have
vacant allocations in various graduate
housing options. Firstly, this assertion is
based on highly dubious figures. Like
airlines overbooking seats for flights,
Housing allocated more assignments

than they have housing spots to fill, and
their "vacancy" figures report the alloca
tion shortfall rather than the number of
spots open. It's like saying the flight
isn't full because the airline hasn't
booked 120 percent of the available
seats. Spots may be declined as people
find other, more acceptable housing
alternatives, but this obfuscation misdi
rects our attention from more serious
flaws.
Some graduate housing options are
completely unacceptable to most appli
cants. Single-bedroom, double-occupan
cy apartments are the most notable
examples; Housing has converted
around 65 of these to single-occupancy
apartments for twice the rent. No bar
gain there, and fewer spots, albeit
unwanted ones. Few graduate students
will even consider living in the Manzani
ta trailers. They are overpriced, in terri
ble condition, and were slated for demo
lition over 20 years ago. The sense of
community that once existed there was
decimated with the razing of two-thirds
of the park for undergraduate housing.
Students draw into these spaces, despite
their unattractiveness, because they are

desperate to live anywhere on campus.
When a few of these spaces remain
unfilled, Housing fraudulently claims
there is a "glut." In reality, poor condi
tions, high prices and inflexible housing
policies are responsible for these empty
spots.
Housing is allocated preferentially to
first-year graduate students. This policy
is a godsend for people new to the area,
particularly those entering Stanford
from overseas. However, for revenue
enhancement purposes, Stanford now
admits hundreds more terminal Masters
students, all eligible for this priority. Co
terminal students, who have enjoyed
nearly four years of guaranteed under
graduate housing, are also eligible. This
has substantially reduced the number of
spots which continuing graduate stu
dents can draw into.
When Rains opened in 1989, the Uni
versity was able to house 45 percent of
its graduate-student body. The figure is
back around 40 percent again now, close
to pre-Rains levels. Since Rains opened,
two-thirds of the Manzanita Trailers
have been demolished, Mirrielees
became an undergraduate-only complex

and numbers of Escondido Village
apartments were redesignated: double
occupancy to single-occupancy, singles
occupancy to couples occupancy. Some
changes went in our favor, Crothers
Hall and what's left of the Trailers
became graduate-only options and fewer
undergraduates live in Escondido Vil
lage, for instance. The increase in first
year priority-holders has reduced spaces
for continuing students.
Budget cuts have reduced the number
of summer wait-list rounds to one, to be
held in August, making it harder to get a
wait-list assignment. Unassigned contin
uing students on the wait-list must store
their belongings and find ofT-campus
interim housing for around a month if
they are prepared to gamble and walk-on.
Students brave enough to try for walk-on
assignment have pitched tents in the
foothills during the first week of classes.
When students don't get housing in
the lottery, they are forced to live off
campus. Once you've moved off, the
improbability of being assigned, the
paucity of attractive on-campus options,
and uncertainties about interim housing
and storage are enough to discourage re

entering the lottery. Costs are consider
ably greater off-campus, however. Stan
ford officially estimates the cost differ
ence to average over $3,000 for the 12-
month year.
Since Stanford's cost-of-living figures
have risen faster than inflation, and fel
lowship and assistantship stipends have
not kept pace, a growing rift in financial
ability to attend Stanford threatens
Stanford's existing and future graduate
student population. If not adequately
addressed, this can only hurt Stanford.
The quality of research conducted at
Stanford and the prestige of our profes
sional schools are enhanced by the con
tributions of graduate students. The
ability to be productively engaged in
research and studying for our graduate
degrees, however, is degraded by an
uncertain housing system. The faculty
and administration would be well served
to address these issues promptly, before
they affect the University's ability to
attract and retain the best graduate stu
dents ... If it's not already too late.

able levels of uncertainty that graduate
students will not tolerate.
The Housing Center asserts that sup
ply exceeded demand because they have
vacant allocations in various graduate
housing options. Firstly, this assertion is
based on highly dubious figures. Like
airlines overbooking seats for flights,
Housing allocated more assignments

than they have housing spots to fill, and
their "vacancy" figures report the alloca
tion shortfall rather than the number of
spots open. It's like saying the flight
isn't full because the airline hasn't
booked 120 percent of the available
seats. Spots may be declined as people
find other, more acceptable housing
alternatives, but this obfuscation misdi
rects our attention from more serious
flaws.
Some graduate housing options are
completely unacceptable to most appli
cants. Single-bedroom, double-occupan
cy apartments are the most notable
examples; Housing has converted
around 65 of these to single-occupancy
apartments for twice the rent. No bar
gain there, and fewer spots, albeit
unwanted ones. Few graduate students
will even consider living in the Manzani
ta trailers. They are overpriced, in terri
ble condition, and were slated for demo
lition over 20 years ago. The sense of
community that once existed there was
decimated with the razing of two-thirds
of the park for undergraduate housing.
Students draw into these spaces, despite
their unattractiveness, because they are

desperate to live anywhere on campus.
When a few of these spaces remain
unfilled, Housing fraudulently claims
there is a "glut." In reality, poor condi
tions, high prices and inflexible housing
policies are responsible for these empty
spots.
Housing is allocated preferentially to
first-year graduate students. This policy
is a godsend for people new to the area,
particularly those entering Stanford
from overseas. However, for revenue
enhancement purposes, Stanford now
admits hundreds more terminal Masters
students, all eligible for this priority. Co
terminal students, who have enjoyed
nearly four years of guaranteed under
graduate housing, are also eligible. This
has substantially reduced the number of
spots which continuing graduate stu
dents can draw into.
When Rains opened in 1989, the Uni
versity was able to house 45 percent of
its graduate-student body. The figure is
back around 40 percent again now, close
to pre-Rains levels. Since Rains opened,
two-thirds of the Manzanita Trailers
have been demolished, Mirrielees
became an undergraduate-only complex

and numbers of Escondido Village
apartments were redesignated: double
occupancy to single-occupancy, singles
occupancy to couples occupancy. Some
changes went in our favor, Crothers
Hall and what's left of the Trailers
became graduate-only options and fewer
undergraduates live in Escondido Vil
lage, for instance. The increase in first
year priority-holders has reduced spaces
for continuing students.
Budget cuts have reduced the number
of summer wait-list rounds to one, to be
held in August, making it harder to get a
wait-list assignment. Unassigned contin
uing students on the wait-list must store
their belongings and find ofT-campus
interim housing for around a month if
they are prepared to gamble and walk-on.
Students brave enough to try for walk-on
assignment have pitched tents in the
foothills during the first week of classes.
When students don't get housing in
the lottery, they are forced to live off
campus. Once you've moved off, the
improbability of being assigned, the
paucity of attractive on-campus options,
and uncertainties about interim housing
and storage are enough to discourage re

entering the lottery. Costs are consider
ably greater off-campus, however. Stan
ford officially estimates the cost differ
ence to average over $3,000 for the 12-
month year.
Since Stanford's cost-of-living figures
have risen faster than inflation, and fel
lowship and assistantship stipends have
not kept pace, a growing rift in financial
ability to attend Stanford threatens
Stanford's existing and future graduate
student population. If not adequately
addressed, this can only hurt Stanford.
The quality of research conducted at
Stanford and the prestige of our profes
sional schools are enhanced by the con
tributions of graduate students. The
ability to be productively engaged in
research and studying for our graduate
degrees, however, is degraded by an
uncertain housing system. The faculty
and administration would be well served
to address these issues promptly, before
they affect the University's ability to
attract and retain the best graduate stu
dents ... If it's not already too late.
