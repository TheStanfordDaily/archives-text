# Report Items from the Judicial Affairs Office
## 
### 
1. A proposal was submitted to the Student Conduct Legislative Council, asking that they
act to repeal the Fundamental Standard Interpretation on Free Expression and
Discriminatory Harassment. An affirmative vote by 7 members was needed for passage.
There were 3 votes for repeal and 5 votes against repeal. (One member was on sabbatical
and did not vote and another member could not be reached.)
2. Regarding the alleged Honor Code problems on the final examinations in CIV and
Geophysics 4, the Judicial Affairs Officer and the course instructors talked by phone or in
person with almost all of the students who took early examinations in those courses, as
well as with many students who took the exams at the regularly scheduled times.
Although we heard a lot of speculation and gossip, there was no hard evidence presented
that allowed us to identify any student as the provider or recipient of unpermitted aid.
While we believe that Honor Code violations did occur in these courses, we doubt that the
problems were widespread in either course. This belief is based upon conversations with
many indignant students who hoped that the investigations would identify their dishonest
peers and upon a perception that the undergraduate community is too small for a
widespread problem not to have yielded more specific information.
3. The publicity surrounding the CIV and Geophysics 4 issues raised several questions.
There may be a need for policy guidance about the administration of early
examinations. There may also be a need for guidance about how to administer an
examination given reports that the contents may have been leaked by those who took it
early. The chairs of C-AAA and the SCLC will meet early in the summer to consider these
issues.
The investigations brought forth numerous, unsubstantiated reports of rampant
cheating in some courses, especially courses taken for DR's and large, introductory science
courses. Articles in the Daily also presented opinions that the Honor Code doesn't work
and ought to be abolished, as well as opinions that it's working just fine and should be
retained. It may be time to gather more systematic data on this question.
The investigations also revealed widespread ignorance of the Honor Code,
especially among students. They seem to be oblivious of its benefits and unaware of its
requirements. Valuable learning was a side benefit of the CIV and Geophysics 4 problems
but we shouldn't rely upon problems and publicity to address educational needs. A more
effective way needs to be found to educate students about Stanford's Honor Code — and it
must, I think, involve students and faculty as the primary messengers since administrative
efforts appear inadequate to the task.
