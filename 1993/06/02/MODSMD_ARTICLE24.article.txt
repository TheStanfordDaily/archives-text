Bike storage fee reduced
After negotiating with the new Council of Pres
idents, the University has announced a $10
reduction in its summer bike storage fee — to
$20. The reduction means the cost will double,
not triple, from previous years.
The expense of installing a sprinkler system to
meet fire codes, which caused the storage price to
rise from $10 to $30, will now be spread over a few
years instead of impacting students in a one-time
price increase, said Rodger Whitney, associate
director of Student Housing Operations.
The fire marshal originally mandated that a
sprinkler system costing approximately $30,000
be installed in bike storage rooms before this sum
mer. However, Housing was able to extend the
deadline until February 1994.
"We are trying to preserve a good service for
students," Whitney said, adding that the cost
should remain stable for the next few years.
Depending on staffing costs, he said the fee could
even be reduced, though not to the $10 level.
COP member Jason Snyder said that main
taining bike storage services and reining in the fee
increase was the best the COP could hope for in
dealing with the issue of summer storage. "We're
taking damage control on an issue that was essen

tially mangled over the past year," he said.

Students arrested at play
Two Stanford seniors were arrested Friday at
Memorial Auditorium for public intoxication dur
ing a Ram's Head production.
Jonathan Killian and Chase Madar were
barred from re-entering the auditorium during
intermission by the cast and producer. The two
were allegedly banging on the door when an offi
cer tried to detain Killian for questioning, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"They were talking really loudly, laughing,
harassing the actors, and one was found urinating
on a bush outside," Niemeyer said.
Killian allegedly tried to break away and has
also been charged with resisting arrest.
After being arrested, Madar and Killian were
taken to the North County Jail and kept in the
drunk tank until 4 a.m. when they were released
on their own recognizance.
Madar said he and Killian had left to look for a
washroom, to no avail. He also claimed that the
two were probably technically sober and had not
intended to menace the actors.
