While approximately 48 percent of students
approve of Gerhard Casper's performance as Uni
versity president, more than 40 percent don't know
or have no opinion about his first year on the job,
according to a poll conducted by The Daily.
When asked about specific issues Casper has
faced, an even greater number of students said they
had little knowledge of his performance.
In response to a question concerning the presi
dent's handling of multicultural issues, 46.5 percent
said they had no opinion or did not know, while
nearly 33 percent agreed with Casper's performance
and 20.6 percent disagreed.
When questioned about Casper's responsiveness
to student concerns, 42 percent answered no opin
ion/don't know.
The number of students uninformed about
Casper's first year as president was more marked
among graduate students than undergraduates,
with 44.8 percent of graduate students polled
responding that they had no opinion or did not
know, compared to 37.6 percent of undergraduates.
In response to the question about multicultural
ism, 71.5 percent of graduate students — compared
to 42.1 percent of undergraduates — polled were
uninformed or had no opinion.
Males and females also differed in their ratings of
Casper. While 56.7 percent of male students polled

More than 43.7 percent of the 403
students polled responded with
answers such as 1 have no idea'
or 'I can't think of one,' while 5
percent said Casper had not
accomplished anything in the
first year of his presidency.

said they approved of Casper's handling of his job,
only 33 percent of females agreed.
And while little more than 36 percent of males
said they had no opinion or didn't know, 47 percent
of females answered this way.
When asked if they thought the new president
has been responsive to student concerns, 35 percent
said he has and 22 percent said he has not.
Nearly half — 46.5 percent — of students feel
that Casper has improved the University image,
which has been buffeted in recent years by nega
tive publicity surrounding the indirect-cost con
troversy.
Students were also asked the open-ended ques
tion, "What do you consider to be Casper's most sig
nificant accomplishment this year?"
More than 43.7 percent of the 403 students polled
responded with answers such as "I have no idea" or
"I can't think of one," while 5 percent said Casper
had not accomplished anything in the first year of
his presidency.
Among the students who had a specific accom
plishment in mind, most — 15 percent of those
polled — said Casper had improved Stanford's
image, or at least kept Stanford out of the spotlight.
The other answers, which each garnered less than
5 percent of the responses, included appointing
Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice as provost,
proposing the three-year plan, and planning the re
evaluation of undergraduate education.
One enterprising student said "his haircut,"
while a critical mass of three called Casper's "per
formance in Gaieties" the most significant accom
plishment of his presidency.
