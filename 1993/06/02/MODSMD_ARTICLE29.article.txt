the Office of Multicultural
Development.
"The 'sudden resignation' of
Sharon Parker has raised a lot of
questions concerning the Uni
versity's commitment to the
UCMI recommendations and to
the minority communities and to
the Office of Multicultural
Development," said Barbara
Smith, director of the Black
Community Services Center.
Smith said she was "kind of
disappointed" about the way the
changes in leadership of the
office came about, but that "it
lends an opportunity to look at
the dynamics of how things
changed from [the Affirmative
Action Office] to Office of Multi
cultural Development, and now
it seems to be changing back to
affirmative action."
Currently, Asst. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences A 1
Camarillo is selecting a commit
tee of faculty, staff and students
to review the history and purpose
of the office and suggest to
Casper a possible role for it in the
future.
Senior Harrison Hsieh, anoth
er member of Asian/Pacific
Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford, said he is
concerned about changing the
role of the office. "The [Office of
Multicultural Development] is
good right now, because it sup
ports programming and serves as
an advocate," he said, adding
that giving it an affirmative
action focus "runs the risk of
diversity only in numbers, rather
than lifestyle."
In addition, some people have

expressed concern about a draft
of the cabinet's response to a
review of the 1991 UCMI report.
The draft raised several
issues, including the use of the
word "transculturalism" in
place of "multiculturalism,"

'My main goal for Stanford is that it continue
to deliver the highest quality education and
the highest quality research in the country
... or as high as we can possibly afford.'

possible "self-segregationist"
tendencies of ethnic theme
houses and dorms, and the cre
ation of an internal cabinet
review process to replace the
current UCMI review process
which includes faculty, staff and
students.
"It is the kind of document
that would have been very fertile
for community discussion. For
example, the self-segregation of
the community centers is an
issue to be discussed by the com
munity," said Cecilia Burciaga, a
development officer in the Office
of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs and a former member of
the UCMI review committee. "I
don't think it was so much what
was contained in [the] docu
ment, but that there is a sense of
(student) exclusion, especially
since the issue began with stu
dents."
Casper addressed this issue in
Thursday's Faculty Senate meet-

ing, where he stated that there
was no student input in the
response to UCMI because it was
being conducted by the cabinet.
Two students participated in the
last review of the document in
1991.

"This is a cabinet response,
not a Michael Jackson response,
not a student response," echoed
Jackson. "Student input is very
important, but the question is
when should it come."
Numerous copies of an anony
mous flier appeared in the Quad
in mid-May linking the Office of
Multicultural Development
upheaval and the UCMI report to
the review of undergraduate edu
cation and the denial of tenure to
Asst. History Prof. Gordon
Chang. The flier ended with the
misspelled statement "!!! Heil
Caspar !!!"
Larimore, the director of the
American Indian Program Office
saw the flier as a signal that too
much focus is being placed on
Casper's role in multicultural
issues.
"For me, it's a little disturbing
that people look to Building 10
for what direction multicultural
ism and the University are mov
ing in because each of us has a
role in the community," he said.
And despite Casper's state
ment that ethnic-center funding
should be a priority in the next
fund-raising campaign, there is
still concern about where these
centers fall in the new adminis
tration's agenda.
"A lot of us are feeling that
[the ethnic centers) are priorities
and we have waited too long to
get attention in the critical areas
we need. For him, I know he has
made certain commitments to
priorities and I think the centers
fall under these priorities,"
Smith said.
Webb Ranch
Another area that some facul
ty feel is lacking the President's
attention is Webb Ranch.
Brought to light in late Jan
uary, Casper was asked to inter
vene and help improve the living
conditions and wages of the
workers of the ranch, located on
Stanford land just off Alpine
Road.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, one of three professors
who raised the issue, said he is
disappointed with the attention
Casper has given the problem.
"He had an opportunity to
intervene and materially
improve the situation, but after
responding to their lack of heat,
he washed his hands of it," Man

ley said.
"There was a flicker of moral
leadership with Casper but it is
lamentable that it was extin
guished almost as soon as it
appeared," he added.
Rebholz, another supporter of
the ranch workers, said Casper
"could have applied moral pres
sure to the Webbs so when the
workers' contracts were being
renegotiated, they could have
gotten more of a raise."
Casper, however, said he was
able to do what he could, but he
felt it was best to deal with the
situation privately, adding that
dealing with the ranch proves to
be a difficult situation since it
involves the lease with an outside
firm.
He said he thinks that which
was achieved was "a fair amount.
I have no control over California
wages and market conditions."
But Manley said he feels that
this problem goes beyond the
Webb Ranch to Stanford's role in
general in teaching about morals.
Stanford is "failing in provid
ing students with exposure and
training in moral leadership,"
Manley said.
Reviewing the curriculum
But if some are critical of
Casper's failure to teach morals
by example, many are enthusias
tic about his plan to re-evaluate
the undergraduate curriculum,
which has not been reviewed
since 1968.
There is "no question that an
examination is necessary, espe
cially in the definition of the
majors and the way we create
and choose interdisciplinary pro
grams," Thomas said.
Manley is fearful, though, that
the commission will not take a
totally objective look at Stan
ford's undergraduate program.
"It's one thing to call for a
study; it's another to stack the
commission to take it in the
direction you want," he said. He
added that he is concerned the
commission will move Stanford
backwards toward the "rigidity
of the '50s and '605."
In announcing the commis
sion in his April 29 State of the
University address, Casper said
he does "not presume to propose
a new undergraduate curricu
lum, but I do propose that we
embark on a new and compre
hensive study of undergraduate
education."
Casper did say last week that
he is concerned that "all students
get challenged and get a serious
education."
Areas of particular concern to
him include distribution require
ments, the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program and interdisci
plinary programs.
English Prof. George Dekker
said he thinks the creation of this
commission is an example of how
Casper and Kennedy differ.
"Donald Kennedy was inter
ested in the delivery system, but
Casper is interested in what is
being delivered," Dekker said.
In comparing the two presi

dents, Dekker said he feels that
Casper is interested in closely
examining and evaluating all
aspects of the general curricu
lum, while Kennedy was more
concerned with enhancing its
quality.
Dekker added he believes it is
time "for a more rational and
systematic review" of undergrad
uate education.
'He doesn't augur ill'
Although they have opinions
of the way Casper has tackled
numerous issues, many of those
interviewed also felt it is too
early to make a final judgement
with regard to his future leader
ship.
"He doesn't augur ill for the
future," Bernstein said, claiming
it is too early to judge Casper's
presidency.
"Give him full credit," Fetter
said. "He's done a wonderful job
in a very demanding year."
According to Fetter, who
chaired the presidential search
committee, Casper's response to
the challenges he has faced "con
firmed all the notable qualities
identified by the search commit
tee — academic distinction,
managerial experience and lead
ership ability."
Paraphrasing Casper's State

of the University address,
Lieberman said, "Stanford is
very strong when compared to its
sister institutions. Higher educa
tion is in financial trouble over
the next decade, but we are in as
strong as a position as any other
university."
"My main goal for Stanford is
that it continue to deliver the
highest quality education and
the highest quality research in
the country ... or as high as we
can possibly afford," Casper said.
"I have addressed a whole set of
issues that needed to be
addressed and what they will
amount to in total remains to be
seen."
While Casper defines the role
of a modern university president
as encompassing an array of
responsibilities from fundraising
and fiscal duties to political and
academic ones, he feels that a
university is "in the primary
business of education and
research.
"I see these two areas as the
main priorities, and if I don't
attend to them, no one else will,"
Casper said.

disappointed" about the way the
changes in leadership of the
office came about, but that "it
lends an opportunity to look at
the dynamics of how things
changed from [the Affirmative
Action Office] to Office of Multi
cultural Development, and now
it seems to be changing back to
affirmative action."
Currently, Asst. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences A 1
Camarillo is selecting a commit
tee of faculty, staff and students
to review the history and purpose
of the office and suggest to
Casper a possible role for it in the
future.
Senior Harrison Hsieh, anoth
er member of Asian/Pacific
Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford, said he is
concerned about changing the
role of the office. "The [Office of
Multicultural Development] is
good right now, because it sup
ports programming and serves as
an advocate," he said, adding
that giving it an affirmative
action focus "runs the risk of
diversity only in numbers, rather
than lifestyle."
In addition, some people have

expressed concern about a draft
of the cabinet's response to a
review of the 1991 UCMI report.
The draft raised several
issues, including the use of the
word "transculturalism" in
place of "multiculturalism,"

'My main goal for Stanford is that it continue
to deliver the highest quality education and
the highest quality research in the country
... or as high as we can possibly afford.'

possible "self-segregationist"
tendencies of ethnic theme
houses and dorms, and the cre
ation of an internal cabinet
review process to replace the
current UCMI review process
which includes faculty, staff and
students.
"It is the kind of document
that would have been very fertile
for community discussion. For
example, the self-segregation of
the community centers is an
issue to be discussed by the com
munity," said Cecilia Burciaga, a
development officer in the Office
of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs and a former member of
the UCMI review committee. "I
don't think it was so much what
was contained in [the] docu
ment, but that there is a sense of
(student) exclusion, especially
since the issue began with stu
dents."
Casper addressed this issue in
Thursday's Faculty Senate meet-

ing, where he stated that there
was no student input in the
response to UCMI because it was
being conducted by the cabinet.
Two students participated in the
last review of the document in
1991.

"This is a cabinet response,
not a Michael Jackson response,
not a student response," echoed
Jackson. "Student input is very
important, but the question is
when should it come."
Numerous copies of an anony
mous flier appeared in the Quad
in mid-May linking the Office of
Multicultural Development
upheaval and the UCMI report to
the review of undergraduate edu
cation and the denial of tenure to
Asst. History Prof. Gordon
Chang. The flier ended with the
misspelled statement "!!! Heil
Caspar !!!"
Larimore, the director of the
American Indian Program Office
saw the flier as a signal that too
much focus is being placed on
Casper's role in multicultural
issues.
"For me, it's a little disturbing
that people look to Building 10
for what direction multicultural
ism and the University are mov
ing in because each of us has a
role in the community," he said.
And despite Casper's state
ment that ethnic-center funding
should be a priority in the next
fund-raising campaign, there is
still concern about where these
centers fall in the new adminis
tration's agenda.
"A lot of us are feeling that
[the ethnic centers) are priorities
and we have waited too long to
get attention in the critical areas
we need. For him, I know he has
made certain commitments to
priorities and I think the centers
fall under these priorities,"
Smith said.
Webb Ranch
Another area that some facul
ty feel is lacking the President's
attention is Webb Ranch.
Brought to light in late Jan
uary, Casper was asked to inter
vene and help improve the living
conditions and wages of the
workers of the ranch, located on
Stanford land just off Alpine
Road.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, one of three professors
who raised the issue, said he is
disappointed with the attention
Casper has given the problem.
"He had an opportunity to
intervene and materially
improve the situation, but after
responding to their lack of heat,
he washed his hands of it," Man

ley said.
"There was a flicker of moral
leadership with Casper but it is
lamentable that it was extin
guished almost as soon as it
appeared," he added.
Rebholz, another supporter of
the ranch workers, said Casper
"could have applied moral pres
sure to the Webbs so when the
workers' contracts were being
renegotiated, they could have
gotten more of a raise."
Casper, however, said he was
able to do what he could, but he
felt it was best to deal with the
situation privately, adding that
dealing with the ranch proves to
be a difficult situation since it
involves the lease with an outside
firm.
He said he thinks that which
was achieved was "a fair amount.
I have no control over California
wages and market conditions."
But Manley said he feels that
this problem goes beyond the
Webb Ranch to Stanford's role in
general in teaching about morals.
Stanford is "failing in provid
ing students with exposure and
training in moral leadership,"
Manley said.
Reviewing the curriculum
But if some are critical of
Casper's failure to teach morals
by example, many are enthusias
tic about his plan to re-evaluate
the undergraduate curriculum,
which has not been reviewed
since 1968.
There is "no question that an
examination is necessary, espe
cially in the definition of the
majors and the way we create
and choose interdisciplinary pro
grams," Thomas said.
Manley is fearful, though, that
the commission will not take a
totally objective look at Stan
ford's undergraduate program.
"It's one thing to call for a
study; it's another to stack the
commission to take it in the
direction you want," he said. He
added that he is concerned the
commission will move Stanford
backwards toward the "rigidity
of the '50s and '605."
In announcing the commis
sion in his April 29 State of the
University address, Casper said
he does "not presume to propose
a new undergraduate curricu
lum, but I do propose that we
embark on a new and compre
hensive study of undergraduate
education."
Casper did say last week that
he is concerned that "all students
get challenged and get a serious
education."
Areas of particular concern to
him include distribution require
ments, the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program and interdisci
plinary programs.
English Prof. George Dekker
said he thinks the creation of this
commission is an example of how
Casper and Kennedy differ.
"Donald Kennedy was inter
ested in the delivery system, but
Casper is interested in what is
being delivered," Dekker said.
In comparing the two presi

dents, Dekker said he feels that
Casper is interested in closely
examining and evaluating all
aspects of the general curricu
lum, while Kennedy was more
concerned with enhancing its
quality.
Dekker added he believes it is
time "for a more rational and
systematic review" of undergrad
uate education.
'He doesn't augur ill'
Although they have opinions
of the way Casper has tackled
numerous issues, many of those
interviewed also felt it is too
early to make a final judgement
with regard to his future leader
ship.
"He doesn't augur ill for the
future," Bernstein said, claiming
it is too early to judge Casper's
presidency.
"Give him full credit," Fetter
said. "He's done a wonderful job
in a very demanding year."
According to Fetter, who
chaired the presidential search
committee, Casper's response to
the challenges he has faced "con
firmed all the notable qualities
identified by the search commit
tee — academic distinction,
managerial experience and lead
ership ability."
Paraphrasing Casper's State

of the University address,
Lieberman said, "Stanford is
very strong when compared to its
sister institutions. Higher educa
tion is in financial trouble over
the next decade, but we are in as
strong as a position as any other
university."
"My main goal for Stanford is
that it continue to deliver the
highest quality education and
the highest quality research in
the country ... or as high as we
can possibly afford," Casper said.
"I have addressed a whole set of
issues that needed to be
addressed and what they will
amount to in total remains to be
seen."
While Casper defines the role
of a modern university president
as encompassing an array of
responsibilities from fundraising
and fiscal duties to political and
academic ones, he feels that a
university is "in the primary
business of education and
research.
"I see these two areas as the
main priorities, and if I don't
attend to them, no one else will,"
Casper said.

tee of faculty, staff and students
to review the history and purpose
of the office and suggest to
Casper a possible role for it in the
future.
Senior Harrison Hsieh, anoth
er member of Asian/Pacific
Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford, said he is
concerned about changing the
role of the office. "The [Office of
Multicultural Development] is
good right now, because it sup
ports programming and serves as
an advocate," he said, adding
that giving it an affirmative
action focus "runs the risk of
diversity only in numbers, rather
than lifestyle."
In addition, some people have

expressed concern about a draft
of the cabinet's response to a
review of the 1991 UCMI report.
The draft raised several
issues, including the use of the
word "transculturalism" in
place of "multiculturalism,"

'My main goal for Stanford is that it continue
to deliver the highest quality education and
the highest quality research in the country
... or as high as we can possibly afford.'

possible "self-segregationist"
tendencies of ethnic theme
houses and dorms, and the cre
ation of an internal cabinet
review process to replace the
current UCMI review process
which includes faculty, staff and
students.
"It is the kind of document
that would have been very fertile
for community discussion. For
example, the self-segregation of
the community centers is an
issue to be discussed by the com
munity," said Cecilia Burciaga, a
development officer in the Office
of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs and a former member of
the UCMI review committee. "I
don't think it was so much what
was contained in [the] docu
ment, but that there is a sense of
(student) exclusion, especially
since the issue began with stu
dents."
Casper addressed this issue in
Thursday's Faculty Senate meet-

ing, where he stated that there
was no student input in the
response to UCMI because it was
being conducted by the cabinet.
Two students participated in the
last review of the document in
1991.

"This is a cabinet response,
not a Michael Jackson response,
not a student response," echoed
Jackson. "Student input is very
important, but the question is
when should it come."
Numerous copies of an anony
mous flier appeared in the Quad
in mid-May linking the Office of
Multicultural Development
upheaval and the UCMI report to
the review of undergraduate edu
cation and the denial of tenure to
Asst. History Prof. Gordon
Chang. The flier ended with the
misspelled statement "!!! Heil
Caspar !!!"
Larimore, the director of the
American Indian Program Office
saw the flier as a signal that too
much focus is being placed on
Casper's role in multicultural
issues.
"For me, it's a little disturbing
that people look to Building 10
for what direction multicultural
ism and the University are mov
ing in because each of us has a
role in the community," he said.
And despite Casper's state
ment that ethnic-center funding
should be a priority in the next
fund-raising campaign, there is
still concern about where these
centers fall in the new adminis
tration's agenda.
"A lot of us are feeling that
[the ethnic centers) are priorities
and we have waited too long to
get attention in the critical areas
we need. For him, I know he has
made certain commitments to
priorities and I think the centers
fall under these priorities,"
Smith said.
Webb Ranch
Another area that some facul
ty feel is lacking the President's
attention is Webb Ranch.
Brought to light in late Jan
uary, Casper was asked to inter
vene and help improve the living
conditions and wages of the
workers of the ranch, located on
Stanford land just off Alpine
Road.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, one of three professors
who raised the issue, said he is
disappointed with the attention
Casper has given the problem.
"He had an opportunity to
intervene and materially
improve the situation, but after
responding to their lack of heat,
he washed his hands of it," Man

ley said.
"There was a flicker of moral
leadership with Casper but it is
lamentable that it was extin
guished almost as soon as it
appeared," he added.
Rebholz, another supporter of
the ranch workers, said Casper
"could have applied moral pres
sure to the Webbs so when the
workers' contracts were being
renegotiated, they could have
gotten more of a raise."
Casper, however, said he was
able to do what he could, but he
felt it was best to deal with the
situation privately, adding that
dealing with the ranch proves to
be a difficult situation since it
involves the lease with an outside
firm.
He said he thinks that which
was achieved was "a fair amount.
I have no control over California
wages and market conditions."
But Manley said he feels that
this problem goes beyond the
Webb Ranch to Stanford's role in
general in teaching about morals.
Stanford is "failing in provid
ing students with exposure and
training in moral leadership,"
Manley said.
Reviewing the curriculum
But if some are critical of
Casper's failure to teach morals
by example, many are enthusias
tic about his plan to re-evaluate
the undergraduate curriculum,
which has not been reviewed
since 1968.
There is "no question that an
examination is necessary, espe
cially in the definition of the
majors and the way we create
and choose interdisciplinary pro
grams," Thomas said.
Manley is fearful, though, that
the commission will not take a
totally objective look at Stan
ford's undergraduate program.
"It's one thing to call for a
study; it's another to stack the
commission to take it in the
direction you want," he said. He
added that he is concerned the
commission will move Stanford
backwards toward the "rigidity
of the '50s and '605."
In announcing the commis
sion in his April 29 State of the
University address, Casper said
he does "not presume to propose
a new undergraduate curricu
lum, but I do propose that we
embark on a new and compre
hensive study of undergraduate
education."
Casper did say last week that
he is concerned that "all students
get challenged and get a serious
education."
Areas of particular concern to
him include distribution require
ments, the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program and interdisci
plinary programs.
English Prof. George Dekker
said he thinks the creation of this
commission is an example of how
Casper and Kennedy differ.
"Donald Kennedy was inter
ested in the delivery system, but
Casper is interested in what is
being delivered," Dekker said.
In comparing the two presi

dents, Dekker said he feels that
Casper is interested in closely
examining and evaluating all
aspects of the general curricu
lum, while Kennedy was more
concerned with enhancing its
quality.
Dekker added he believes it is
time "for a more rational and
systematic review" of undergrad
uate education.
'He doesn't augur ill'
Although they have opinions
of the way Casper has tackled
numerous issues, many of those
interviewed also felt it is too
early to make a final judgement
with regard to his future leader
ship.
"He doesn't augur ill for the
future," Bernstein said, claiming
it is too early to judge Casper's
presidency.
"Give him full credit," Fetter
said. "He's done a wonderful job
in a very demanding year."
According to Fetter, who
chaired the presidential search
committee, Casper's response to
the challenges he has faced "con
firmed all the notable qualities
identified by the search commit
tee — academic distinction,
managerial experience and lead
ership ability."
Paraphrasing Casper's State

of the University address,
Lieberman said, "Stanford is
very strong when compared to its
sister institutions. Higher educa
tion is in financial trouble over
the next decade, but we are in as
strong as a position as any other
university."
"My main goal for Stanford is
that it continue to deliver the
highest quality education and
the highest quality research in
the country ... or as high as we
can possibly afford," Casper said.
"I have addressed a whole set of
issues that needed to be
addressed and what they will
amount to in total remains to be
seen."
While Casper defines the role
of a modern university president
as encompassing an array of
responsibilities from fundraising
and fiscal duties to political and
academic ones, he feels that a
university is "in the primary
business of education and
research.
"I see these two areas as the
main priorities, and if I don't
attend to them, no one else will,"
Casper said.
