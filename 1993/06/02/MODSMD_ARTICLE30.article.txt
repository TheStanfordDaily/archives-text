[ es. Although scientists have been

making diamonds since 1955, the
demand to produce diamonds
cheaper and quicker — so that
they can be used for industrial
tools — has spurred new research
in the field.
The hardest known substance,
diamonds are molecules of pure car
bon. Diamond consists of one car
bon atom bonded to four other car
bon atoms in a structural arrange
ment that gives the molecule its
characteristic look and, more
importantly, its strength.
The diamond's strength opens
a large market for manufactured
films made of diamond. These
films have numerous applications;
they can be used to coat tools or to
form strong, sharp blades to cut

glass and other materials.
In Cappelli's lab, diamond
making occurs by activating a
gaseous starting material with an
electrical discharge. This starting
material, which contains diamond
precursor molecules, binds to a
growing surface where the carbon
atoms bond together to form dia
mond.
The researchers mixed hydro
gen gas with other hydrocarbon
gases such as methane and acety
lene to make a starting material.
As their name indicates, hydrocar
bon molecules contain hydrogen
and carbon molecules. Carbons
from the methane or acetylene
molecules eventually form dia
monds.
The high-temperature starting
material is injected into a chamber
and activated electrically. Cappelli
heats the material in an electrical
discharge — the hydrogen atoms
then separate from the methane,
which consists of one carbon atom
and four hydrogen atoms.
When the hydrogens leave the
methane carbon, they take their
electrons with them. As a result,
the carbon atom becomes unstable
and looks for replacement elec
trons to stabilize it.
Diamond forms if the carbon
replaces its electrons by bonding
with four other carbon atoms.
Cappelli's team studies the
chemistry needed to make dia
monds. Before the starting gas
mixture hits the growth surface,
the scientists examine the gas
optically with lasers, which pro
vides clues about the chemistry
and chemical formulas of the
molecules necessary for diamond
growth.
For example, if the carbon atom
bonds to three other carbon atoms,
instead of four, graphite results.
The Stanford researchers' findings
indicate that graphite and dia
mond may use the same precursor
molecule — dispelling what was
previously thought: that different
starting molecules were required.
Possible precursor molecules

include the unstable methyl radi
cal (which is a carbon bonded to
throe hydrogens) and acetylene,
two carbons linked to two hydro
gen atoms. A good precursor is one
that is missing one or more of its
electrons, resulting in its
increased propensity to bond with
other atoms.
Precursor molecules attach
themselves to a growing surface.
"Almost any metal can be used
(for the growing surface)," Cap
peiii said, "but diamonds grow
best on molybdenum or silicon."
Scientists can aid diamond for
mation. "The carbon nucleates on
molybdenum. We can seed the
molybdenum with diamond, but
it's not necessary," Cappeiii said.
The growing diamond covers the
surface metal.

Once the initial carbon
molecules are oriented correctly on
the metal surface, continued car
bon bonding creates diamond and
more chemical reactions lock the
carbons into the proper position.
The diamond film has a gray
ish-white appearance. This hap
pens because the diamond parti
cles are so small that they scatter
light.
Presently, the diamond films
produced are not widely imple
mented because of the prohibitive
cost. Using current technology,
the diamond costs $10 to $100 a
karat, which is a unit of measure
on the amount of diamond.
As faster and more efficient
production methods develop, the
cost could fall. Industrial compa
nies may not think about using

diamond film for their tools and
blades unless the cost drops
between $1 and $10 a karat.
Diamond-growing technology
has many applications, but
according to Cappelli, "We don't
have a particular application in
mind. We just try to understand
the chemistry." Once he discov
ers the chemical basis for growth,
diamonds can be produced cost
effectively.
Laboratory diamond formation
is, in a sense, the realization of an
alchemist's dream. Instead of pro
ducing gold, modern researchers
make diamonds for technical use.
And Cappelli acknowledges the
possibility of growing gem-sized
diamonds — some measuring as
much as a half a karat have
already been produced.
