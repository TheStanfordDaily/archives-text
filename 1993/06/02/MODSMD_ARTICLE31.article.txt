# Myoclonus, bedtime spasms and sex: Science Bug tells all

### Chris Patil Staff writer 
: Every night when my boyfriend
I hand 1 go to bed, he jerks and
twitches on and off for about an
houri>efore falling asleep. I haven't said
anything about it to him yet, but I'm con
cerned. Also it keeps me awake and it's
kind of weird. Is this normal?
— Tossing and Turning
A: When I picked up your question
and read the first clause, I actually
got my hopes up. I thought you
were going to ask me for sexual advice.
Something about comparative genital
anatomy, maybe. But nooo — instead,
you had to ask about twitching.
Let me ask you a question: Is that all
that ever happens when you two go to bed,
or is there more to your nightlife than a
few involuntary muscle spasms? Where do
you go to school, anyway? Stanford?
Oops. Sorry, I forgot myself for a sec
ond.
The medical term for any brief, shock
like muscle contraction is myoclonus. The

word itself is derived from Greek roots
meaning "muscle agitation," and its usage
is fairly broad: A facial tic is a myoclonus,
but so is a spasm powerful enough to
throw the victim to the ground.
Although myoclonus typically has a
fairly inoffensive cause, it is sometimes
indicative of profound or even life-threat
ening pathology. For example, myoclonus
is often a sequel to diffuse cerebral anoxia,
the loss or impairment of oxygen supply to
the brain that might occur after, say, a
botched strangulation attempt.
(As an aside, note that oxygen depriva
tion is favored in some circles as a method
of heightening orgasm. No further com
ment would be tasteful at this point.)
Myoclonus also characterizes many
progressive neural disorders associated
with extensive degeneration of brain tis
sue.
If, however, your main squeeze hasn't
been drooling, muttering and wetting
himself a lot recently — and you haven't
been trying to add spice to your sex life by
throttling him at the moment of climax —
then we'll have to turn away from the eso
teric and satisfy ourselves with a more
mundane explanation.

Your boyfriend's twitching is simply
hypnagogic myoclonus, which is Medi
calese for "twitching right before you fall
asleep." It is perfectly healthy and normal,
and just about everyone experiences it.
The precise cause of hypnagogic
myoclonus is uncertain, but some reason
ably sound guesses have been made on the
subject. To wit:

When your boyfriend goes to bed with
the intention of sleeping (and now that
he's dating a Stanford student, what other
intention could he have?), his brain gradu
ally relinquishes control of motor func
tions and he enters the "hypnagogic state"
— a period of curtailed consciousness
characterized in most people by the swift
appearance and disappearance of incoher
ent thoughts and images.
This is the time of night when you get
thoughts like, "Well, yes, I've got that
exam tomorrow, and then I have to go to
the Bursar's office and get some of that
nice pie." In many people, hypnagogia is
accompanied by a sensation of falling, or a
feeling that an invisible fluid is flowing
through the body.
During this period, the brain is sort of
unsure whether it is awake or asleep, and
its responses get a little funny. A mild
stimulus that would have evoked a coher
ent reaction during wakefulness — an
itch, for example, or an unpleat. "Nt odor
(no comment) — can inst*" ' cause an
undirected, inappropriate response like a
twitch or jerk.
Sometimes hypnagogic myoclonus is
strong enough to wake a person up a little

bit, prolonging the descent into sleep and
thus the window of time during which the
sluggish brain's inadequate processing
abilities can trigger myoclonic responses.
Some people's hypnagogic hallucina
tions are vivid enough to trigger
myoclonus absent external stimuli; the
classic example is an amplification of the
aforementioned generalized falling sensa
tion to a dream of actually plummeting
toward the earth. Impact, with all its
messiness, is replaced by a single
myoclonic jerk, and the dreamer is jarred
into a low level of wakefulness, rather
than being put through the ordeal of being
splattered over imaginary pavement.
A final aside: Another possible cause of
hypnagogic myoclonus is anxiety —
resulting, for example, from upcoming
exams, stressful term papers or hopeless
sexual desperation.
Again, no comment.
