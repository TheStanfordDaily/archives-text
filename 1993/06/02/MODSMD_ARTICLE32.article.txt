## Track and field to hit 'Big Easy' 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
It all comes down to this. As the
Cardinal's rebuilding season
draws to a close, three members of
the Stanford track and field team
will travel to New Orleans for the
1993 NCAA Championships, a
four-day competition scheduled to
start today.
Receiving Stanford's highest
individual NCAA ranking was dis
tance specialist Louise Watson,
who holds the No. 10 position in
the nation in the 3,000 meters.
She will be competing in that
event after hitting the NCAA pro
visional mark of 9:23.63 this sea
son. During the cross country sea
son this fall, Watson struck gold at
the NCAA District-8 Regionals,
making her one of the more
formidable runners on the dis
tance-racing circuit.
Joining her on the track will be
senior Dave Scudamore, a provi
sional qualifier in the 10,000 with
a time of 29:35.04. This will be
Scudamore's second NCAA
appearance in as many years.
Seeded No. 12 in the nation this
year, Scudamore will try to
improve upon his llth-place
showing a year ago.
Finally, Jen McCormick will
be the Cardinal's sole represen
tative in the field events, as she
goes into today's competition
with the 11th seed in the javelin.
McCormick achieved a last
minute qualifying mark in her
event by throwing a lifetime
best 164 feet, 7 inches at the
Pacific 10 Conference Finals last
weekend.
Last year, the Cardinal women
took fourth in the NCAA team
competition, riding the coat-tails
of Stanford Olympians Jackie
Edwards and Chiyste Gaines all
the way to the victor's stand.
However, this year, with the
absence of the two graduates and
injuries plaguing two of the three
qualifiers, Stanford will have a
hard time duplicating that finish
on either the men's or women's
side.
Despite her high ranking and
medal potential, Watson is still
recovering from a back injury,
which limited her to only two
3,000-meter runs this year.
Since the onset of her injury,
Watson has failed to show the bril
liance that propelled her during
the early parts of the season. At
the Pac-lOs last week, she finished
a disappointing 11th in the 5,000,
after entering the race as the No. 2
seed and one of the favorites to
win the gold.
"That race was basically a dis

aster," Watson said. "What is
more frustrating is that I don't
have any reasons for why I par
formed so poorly. That's why I
need a good race at the NCAAs. I
want to show myself and other
people that that wasn't me run
ning out there at the Pac-lOs and
that I can do better."
Ultimately, Watson would like
to finish in the top eight, which
would guarantee her an Ail-
American title. During the indoor
track season, Watson missed
being Ail-American by .05 sec
onds, as she finished ninth in the
5,000.
Watson's distance counterpart,
Scudamore, is also nursing an
injury. His strained gluteal mus
cle, however, should not be a prob
lem today, according to Lananna.
"He's basically fit and ready to
go," Lananna said. "The 10,000
will be a very hard race to predict
because the New Orleans heat and
humidity will play a big factor. It
will have to be an intelligent race,
and Dave must keep his wits about
him and not lose patience. Like
always, it will be a race of attri
tion."
Scudamore trails the top seeds
by only 15 seconds, which is noth
ing in a 10,000, according to him.
"I'm aiming for this to be the
best race of the season. I don't
want to be just a competitor, or
just All-American, I want a big
piece of the 10K this year. I think
I can run with any of them, and I
can see myself as a contender to
win it,"he said.
McCormick, however, would be
perfectly satisfied with an All-
American title in her first NCAA
competition. She and Watson will
return next season, as Stanford
continues its rebuilding process in
the hopes of creating another Car
dinal dynasty.
"I'm very excited about the
potential of next year's team,"
Watson said. "Coach has put
together a brilliant recruiting
class. And I think a lot of the cur
rent athletes are going to find that
they dramatically improve next
year."
On the men's side, seniors Gary
Stolz and Dave Popejoy will return
to strengthen the distance and
weight events, respectively, after
red-shirting this season due to
injuries.
"There can be no magic wand
that transforms us overnight,"
Lananna said. "But this year was
definitely a step in the right direc
tion. This was a positive, progres
sive season, and almost every ath
lete achieved a lifetime best dur
ing the year, or came very close to
it."
