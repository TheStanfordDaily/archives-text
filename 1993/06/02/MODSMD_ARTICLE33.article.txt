# Golf finishes 11th at NCAA tourney
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's golf team
concluded its spring season with a
disappointing llth-place finish last
weekend at the NCAA Women's
Golf Championships in Athens, Ga.
Stanford, which placed fourth
among the five Pacific-10 Confer
ence squads present, finished six
strokes back of lOth-place UCLA,
with a cumulative score of 1,232.
Arizona State won the tournament
with a four-day team score of 1,187,
while Texas' Charlotte Sorenstam
(74-70-70-73) took the individual
title by shooting a 5-under-par 287.
Despite its relatively weak show
ing, the Cardinal met the expecta
tions of coach Tim Baldwin. "I
thought we played right about at
our experience level for a
championship like this," said Bald
win, who has completed his 14th
year at Stanford. "It would have
been nice to finish in the top 10, but
that is a distinction that you really
have to earn."
Leading the Cardinal in her final
appearance as an amateur was fifth
year senior captain Martha
Richards (72-80-74-75), who tied
for 21st with a four-round total of
301. Richards made a strong show
ing in Wednesday's first round,

shooting a one-under 72 and
putting her name third on the
leaderboard. "I'm happy with the
way I played. I hit the ball well and
putted well," Richards said. "This is
by far one of the toughest golf cours
es we have encountered this year."
Richards shot an uncharacteris
tically high score of 80 on Thursday,
however, as she triple-bogeyed the
sixth hole after staying at even par
through the first five. She then
bogeyed four of the last 12 holes,
dropping to 22nd place halfway
through the tournament before
gaining one place in the standings
on Friday and Saturday.
Despite her sub-par outing,
Richards finished with the fourth
lowest stroke-per-round average in
Stanford history, behind only Kath
leen McCarthy, Audrey Wooding
and Adele Moore. "We'll miss
Martha Richards next season,"
Baldwin said. "She'll have a fine pro
career."
Other Cardinal participants
included sophomore Jamille Jose
(78-76-75-76, t3sth), junior Melin
da Daniels (79-79-81-73, t69th), and
freshman Vicky Strada (81-79-86-
78, tB4th).
