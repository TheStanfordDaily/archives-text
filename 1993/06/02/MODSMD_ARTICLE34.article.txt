# Women sailors take fifth at Nationals
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
With two freshmen at the helm, the Car
dinal women sailors showed that they're
worth their salt with an impressive fifth
place performance at the Women's National
Dinghy Championships last week in Chesa
peake Bay, Md.
First-year skippers Cinnamon Hamp
ikian and Gretchen Uznis led Stanford to its
best national finish in the last decade. While
Stanford qualified for Nationals last year,
the Cardinal was no match for the power
house teams of the East Coast.
"Our goal was to make it to the top five
and we're really happy about it, especially
since we're both freshmen," Uznis said.
"The future looks good since our team's so
young and we have a lot of team depth."
Coach Blake Middleton was also
impressed with his team's finish, especially
since Stanford beat several teams that were
expected to finish higher than the Cardinal.
"They weren't better than us this week
end," he said.
The 12 best teams competing in the
regatta started Thursday, and after 32 races
in three days of sailing, Tufts earned top
honors. College of Charleston, St. Mary's
(Md.) and Connecticut took the next three
spots.
Stanford finished sixth and fifth in the A

and B divisions respectively to earn the
fifth-place spot overall. Hampikian, with
crewmate sophomore Polly Brown, took
fifth place in her division, sailing consistent
ly in fifth or sixth place over 16 races. Uznis
took sixth in her division over 16 races with
senior crewmates Britt Johnson (12 races)
and Kathy Akers (four).
Uznis thought that the Cardinal did so
well because it took advantage of the dispar
ity of talent within other teams.
"A lot of teams had one strong skipper
and one that was not so good. We have two
skippers that are both pretty good," she
said.
At the end of Thursday's races, Stanford
was back in eighth place. But the Cardinal
took advantage of windy conditions in the
bay to move up in Friday and Saturday's
races. '
Middleton said the women's performance
was especially gratifying for Stanford
because it marked the first time that the
Cardinal sailors excelled in two of the three
racing categories, women's dinghy and
(coed) team racing. Only the coed fleet rac
ing team failed to qualify for national com
petition. If the national team racing compe
tition this weekend goes as well as the
women's regatta did, it will be Stanford's
best sailing year of Middleton's eight-year
tenure
The team-racing sailors depart tomorrow

for this weekend's National Team Racing
Championship Regatta, to be hosted by Old
Dominion in Norfolk, Va.
The regatta will consist of elimination
rounds in which eight of the 12 teams will
be weeded out. The four survivors will then
battle for the championship crown in the
final round.
"There are seven really good teams and
any four of them could make the Final Four.
We hope we're one of them," said senior
team captain John Emory.
Navy, St. Mary's (Md.) and Tufts are
expected to take the top three spots, but the
fourth finals berth is up in the air. Brown,
Charleston, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Stan
ford are the strong teams that will be vying
for the final place.
"We're really confident because the
regatta will be sailed in Flying Juniors,
which are the boats that we've been sailing
in all year," Emory said. Last year, when
Stanford finished eighth, the regatta was
held in 4205, which are mostly used on the
East Coast.
Stanford's three vessels will be manned
by Emory with crewmate Johnson, junior
skipper Scott Sellers with sophomore crew
mate Mary Kussmaul and sophomore skip
per Charles Meade with junior crewmate
Katherine Chen. Junior skipper Jeremy
Mclntyre and freshman crewmate Sibyl
Diver will serve as alternates.
