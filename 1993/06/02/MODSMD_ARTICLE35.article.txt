# Seniors Lynch, Oden named The Daily's Athletes of the Year
## Lynch leads gymnastics team to second NCAA title 
### 
The Golden Child has truly
earned his nickname.
After leading the Stanford
men's gymnastics team to the
NCAA title for the second year in a
row, senior Jair Lynch has clinched
yet another honor as one of The
Daily's 1993 Athletes of the Year.
While the Cardinal co-captain is

still considered young by men's
gymnastics standards, he already
boasts an impressive list of creden
tials. This year the two-time All
American captured the NCAA par
allel bar title in Albuquerque afler
garnering the high bar champi
onship as a junior.
Named the Mountain Pacific

Sports Federation Gymnast of the
Year, Lynch adds this season's
accomplishments to his impressive
1992 repertoire. In addition to the
high bar title, Lynch earned the
highest all-around score in NCAA
history with a 59.025.
Last summer marked the pinna
cle of Lynch's international career
with a sixth-place finish on the par
allel bars in the Barcelona
Olympics. At 20, Ljmch was the
youngest male gymnast represent
ing the United States.
While he admits his four years
have been "a long haul," Lynch
considers two NCAA team titles
well worth the uncountable hours
spent in the gym.
"I'm just glad my Stanford
career has culminated in some
thing like this," Lynch said. "With
a sport like gymnastics, sometimes
you feel like no one knows about all
the hard work you put in."
While the championship trophy
may still sit snugly in its case,
Lynch spends the majority of his
afternoon and evening hours in the
gym. After training at Stanford
during the early part of this sum
mer, Lynch's next major competi
tion will be the World University
Games in July followed by the USA
Championships at the end of
August.
With Lynch's long-range sights
set on Atlanta in 1996, he hopes this
summer will establish him as a seri
ous international competitor.
While looking forward to mov
ing on, Lynch views his time at
Stanford with more than a twinge
of nostalgia.
"The team really united in the
end," Lynch said. "I'm just glad to
think I had a role in bringing every
one together."
