# Spikers snag first championship behind Oden's play
## 
### 
Stanford's Sultaness of Swat
can now add another title to her
collection.
Senior volleyball player Bev
Oden is one of The Daily's 1993
Stanford Athletes of the Year.
Oden, volleyball's first four-time
AVCA Al-American, led the Car
dinal to its first-ever national
championship in Albuquerque on
Dec. 19, 1992, beating previous
ly-undefeated No. 1 UCLA 15-8,
15-9, 6-15, 15-10.
"I'm very honored to receive
this award," Oden said. "This
was, by far, the best season of my
life — we had the best team
chemistry, the best staff, and the
best attitude toward playing. It
was great that we could win it all
this year."
Oden owns a truckload of vol
leyball honors from her four
years on the Farm, including the
1990 Broderick Award, the 1990
Honda Award, and All-Pacific-10
Conference honors four years
running. In addition, she was the
1990 Pac-10 Player of the Year
and 1990 AVCA National Player
of the Year, and was named to
the All-NCAA Tournament
Team for 1992.
Her greatest achievement,
however, came on a cold Decem
ber night in New Mexico, when
the Cardinal finally broke an 11-
year NCAA Tournament curse
and returned home with the
national title. In one of the
biggest upset wins in Stanford
history, the Cardinal ended the
Bruins' 43-match winning streak
and defeated a UCLA squad
some were calling the best
women's collegiate volleyball
team ever.
Oden was named to the 1992
U.S. National Team that played
in the Olympics in Barcelona,

but didn't make the final cut. It
will be a different story in
1996, however, as Oden
attempts to replace retiring sis
ter Kim on the Olympic squad.
She will play in the World Uni
versity Games this summer
with the national team and con
tinue training for Atlanta in

*96.
Any final thoughts on being
the best of 1993, Bev?
"I don't know what to say —
it's great! Say something about
me being very happy."
