January 1, 1993
Stanford'B football program
basked in the glow of national
recognition, as head coach Bill
Walsh's presence focused all
eyes on the Cardinal.
The squad responded with a
24-3 New Year's Day win over
Penn State in the Blockbuster
Bowl, a final No. 9 national
ranking, a 10-3 overall record
and a Pacific 10 Conference co
championship with Washing
ton.
Not bad for a team that
struggled to a 3-8 record just
four years ago and hadn't seen a
double-digit figure in the win
column since 1940.
As senior defensive lineman
Estevan Avila said, "I'm tired of
hearing about Stanford not
being a legit football school. It
took a long road to prove it, but
I think we proved it [with the
Blockbuster win]."
While Stanford's greatly
improved play increased its
media coverage, it also intensi
fied the media's scrutiny.
Walsh, who was named to the
National Football League Hall
of Fame on Jan. 30, was accused
of recruiting violations after
being photographed with a
potential recruit that month,
and was publicly reprimanded
by Pac-10 Commissioner Tom
Hansen on Friday for making
derogatory comments about
Washington's football program.

The men's and women's swim
teams each snagged a second con
secutive NCAA title in impressive
fashion.
Not only did the Cardinal
women clinch Stanford's first
national championship of 1993,
but they dominated their competi
tion March 20 in Minneapolis.
Stanford entered the meet ranked
No. 2 behind Florida, but
reclaimed the top spot with a deci
sive 649.5 to 421.0 romping of the
Gators.
Cardinal women claimed 13 of
21 event titles, including nine indi
vidual and four relay champi
onships, to tie the NCAA record
for most titles won by one school
in a year.

tied with senior teammate and co
captain Janel Jorgensen and Flori

apiece. Thompson took a second
straight collegiate title in the 50-
yard freestyle, won the individual
100 free and contributed to Cardi
nal victories in the 200 free, 200
medley and 800 free relays. Jor
gensen closed out her illustrious
Cardinal career with wins in the
individual 100 and 200 butterfly
events, while helping victorious
Stanford teams in the 200 free,
400 medley and 800 free relays.
Stanford's men followed the
women's lead, outdistancing
Michigan by 124.5 points to cap
ture the national championship
March 27 in Indianapolis. Their
efforts produced six event titles —
including individual triumphs by
junior Derek Weatherford (100
backstroke), junior Tyler Mayfield
(100 breaststroke) and sophomore
Ray Carey (200 fly) and three relay
wins — and planted thoughts of a
1994 "three-peat" in the minds of
Stanford swimming fans.

December 19, 1992
After 11 years of unsuccessful
pursuit, the Cardinal women's
volleyball team finally earned its
first NCAA Championship trophy
by defeating the No. 1 UCLA Bru
ins, 15-8, 15-9, 6-15, 15-10 in
Albuquerque, N.M.
The Stanford win came on the
heels of two regular-season losses
to the defending champion Bru
ins, and marked the first time the
No. 2-ranked Cardinal had beaten
UCLA in the NCAA Tournament.
In addition, Stanford's overall
record of 31-2 marked the best

Led by senior captain Jair Lynch,
the Cardinal cruised to a repeat of
its 1992 NCAA title, topping
Nebraska and Ohio State by one
and two points, respectively.
Lynch, a 1992 Barcelona
Olympian, finished first on the
parallel bars and fifth on floor.

Ironically, the Cardinal men's

similar season-ending fates with

Just after Texas toppled the
men 5-2 in the quarterfinals of
their NCAA Championships in
Athens, Ga., the women were
lassoed by the Longhorns in
Gainesville, Fla., in their final by
the exact same score.
The twin setbacks marked the
first time since 1985 that neither
squad brought an NCAA team
trophy back to the Farm.
The women arrived in
Gainesville with an overall
record of 23-2 and a No. 2 seed
behind Florida, one of the two

In stripping UCLA of the title,
the Cardinal destroyed the media
hype that had built around a
seemingly invincible Bruin squad.
Riding into the tournament on an
undefeated season and a 43-
match winning streak, UCLA was
a heavy favorite heading into the
final.
Stanford's determination and
fired-up play caught the Bruins
by surprise, however, and served
notice to the volleyball world that
the Cardinal will be a force to
reckon with in the future.
Sophomore Jing-Wei Liang's
pommel horse routine merited a
second-place trophy, while sopho

floor. All three gymnasts earned
All-American honors by placing in
the top six of the individual event
finals.
The Cardinal's championship
drive was especially impressive
considering the fact that it took
place without the help of junior

The Longhorns proved to be
the team to watch, however, as
they upset the Gators in the
semifinals to set up a showdown
with the Cardinal.
Stanford breezed past Notre
Dame, Georgia and Arizona on
its side of the bracket to reach
the championship match.
Texas rode into the final on a
wave of emotion that carried
them to their first national
championship, and Stanford
took a back seat as NCAA run
ner-up for the first time in school
history.
In Athens, the fourth-seeded
men failed to follow up on last
year's national championship
performance.
After incurring a 4-2 deficit
against the Longhorns in singles
play, the Cardinal was forced to
take an early bow from the team
championships.

March 30,1993
In an effort to increase Stan
ford's compliance with Title IX of
the 1972 Education Amendments
— a federal anti-discrimination
statute — Athletic Director Ted
Leland announced the creation of
the Women's Sports Enhance
ment Program.
The program will elevate syn

showcase.
Stanford sat through a bye and
then blew past Georgia 93-60 at
Maples Pavilion to advance to the
Western Regional semifinals for
the sixth year in a row. However,
it was in Missoula, Mont., that
the magic ran out. After leading
for most of the game, the Cardi
nal could not hold on down the
stretch against Colorado and fell
to the Lady Buffs, 80-67.
As senior point guard Molly
Goodenbour said following the
disappointing loss, "It's not the
way I wanted to end my career.
We just let it slip away."
Hard-hitting safety John
Lynch, also a promising pitcher in
the Florida Marlins' farm system,
received a second career option
from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
who snagged him in the third
round with the 82nd overall pick.
Outside linebacker Ron
George, a Football News first
team Ail-American, was picked up
by the Atlanta Falcons in the fifth
round. In his final season, George
led the Pac-10 with 15 quarter
back sacks and 25 tackles-for
loss.
Offensive guard Chris Dalman
was the final Cardinal gridder to
receive a professional jersey,
earning a berth with the San
Francisco 49ers in the sixth
round.
Four destroyed, Stanford was
forced to win the tournament in
order to garner the MPSF nomi
nation for an at-large bid.
Stanford was not up to the
task, however, and fell in the
semifinals to No. 5 seed Long
Beach State, 15-13, 10-15, 15-9,
15-11. But three Cardinal players
stood out in the final match of the
season: senior swing hitter Bob
Hillman had 24 kills and only five
errors to hit .432, senior middle
blocker John Hribar tallied 19
kills to hit .593 and junior setter
Canyon Ceman had 103 assists,
the fourth-highest mark in Stan
ford history.
Both Ceman and senior Dave
Goss earned Ail-American honors
for the second time, and Ceman
was named National Player of the
Year, the most prestigious indi
vidual award in the country.
title.
In extending Cal's winning
streak to 44 games — where it
still stands — Zeien continued the
Golden Bears' recent dominance
over the Cardinal. Cal has now
defeated Stanford on 13 occasions
in the last three years.
However, all was not lost for
the Cardinal, which stood out
clearly as the No. 2 team in the
nation all season. Stanford had
earned the right to face the
Golden Bears by drowning sev
enth-seeded Princeton 18-5 in
the quarterfinals and then best

chronized swimming, lacrosse and
water polo to varsity sport status,
and will create 29 more full athlet
ic scholarships for women in the
next four years. The plan also calls
for increased academic advising,
sports medicine and sports infor
mation for female athletes.
According to Assoc. Athletic
Director Cheryl Levick, a Title IX
committee found inconsistencies
in Stanford's women's athletic
program, and the proposed
changes will "implement correc
tions for those deficiencies and
bring the (men's and women's)
programs to complete parity."

Derek Weatherford kicks off Stanford's winning ways at the NCAA Championships in Indianapolis last March. Weatherford, a Junior, won
the 100-yard backstroke and contributed to the Cardinal's triumphant 400 medley and 400 freestyle relay teams. Both the men's and
women's swim teams brought home repeat national titles for Stanford.
