Men's golf
Steve Bur dick will continue
his solo journey through postsea
son play this weekend at the
NCAA Championships, which
run today through Saturday in
Lexington, Ky.
Burdick, a sophomore, placed
fifth in the Western Regional two
weeks ago in Provo, Utah. This
was without the benefit of his
Cardinal teammates, who did not
qualify for the meet. As the top
individual finisher whose team
did not qualify for the Champi
onships, he took one of two at
large bids with a one-under-par,
three-round total of 215 strokes.
Cross country
The Stanford men's and
women's cross-countiy teams
have compiled an impressive
recruiting class for next season.
First-year coach Vin Lananna,
who helped transform Dart

mouth into a national cross
country power two years ago, has
successfully reined in 13 top high
school runners to buffer both of
his Cardinal squads.
On the men's side, three of the
top 10 finishers at the Kinney
National High School Champi
onship meet will be wearing car
dinal and white next season. Five
other state champions will also
join Ail-American Gary Stolz and
a Stanford team that placed fifth
in the Pacific 10 Conference last
season.
The female contingent is just
as strong. In addition to three
state champions, two of the top
12 high school women cross
country runners will compete for
the Cardinal next year. A nation
al-caliber transfer from Notre
Dame rounds out this crop of
recruits, which has Stanford
cross-country fans eagerly await
ing the future.
