# Walsh gets rebuke from commissioner

WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -
Stanford coach Bill Walsh's
unflattering remarks about the
University of Washington's foot
ball program have earned him a
reprimand by the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
The letter of reprimand was
sent to Walsh on Friday by Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen. The
action was taken because of
remarks Walsh made during an
appearance before a Stanford
alumni group last week.
Walsh said Washington ran an
outlaw football program that
relied on athletic "mercenaries."
Walsh apologized to Washing
ton and Huskies coach Don James
last Tuesday, saying his remarks
were in error and out of line.
But the Pac-10 apparently
believed the comments deserved a
reprimand. Most reprimands of
coaches typically stem from criti
cisms of the officiating during a
game, although other coaches
also have been disciplined for dis

paraging comments about anoth
er institution.
Pac-10 spokesman Jim Mul
doon said former Washington
State coach Jim Walden was rep
rimanded in 1984 for making cut
ting remarks about USC.
Hansen issued a statement
explaining the conference wished
to maintain a high level of civility.
"College athletics is a highly
competitive enterprise," he said.
"Our member institutions have
made it clear in conference legis
lation that they expect each of
their representatives to conduct
himself or herself with collegiality
and mutual respect.
"Coach Walsh violated that
standard in this instance.
"Maintenance of cordial rela
tionships among its members is
essential to the success of any
conference, and the Pacific-10 has
been exceptional in this area as it
has been competitively. We wish
to maintain that level of civility,"
Hansen added.
