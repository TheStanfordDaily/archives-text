# Freshman baseball player will stand trial for battery
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
A Santa Clara County Municipal Court judge Fri
day ordered freshman Brodie Van Wagenen to stand
trial for allegedly hitting another student last Octo
ber.
Van Wagenen, the starting right fielder for the
Stanford baseball team, is accused of punching ju
nior Scott Francis twice at a party in Cedro. He is
charged with felony battery with great bodily injury.
Judge Rise Jones Pichon ruled that there is
"strong suspicion" that the offense was committed,
and set Van Wagenen arraignment for June 7 in
Santa Clara County Superior Court.
Van Wagenen faces up to four years in prison if
convicted.
Supervising District Attorney Margo Smith said
she expects that Van Wagenen's previously clean po
lice record will most likely keep him out of prison. In
stead, a guilty verdict would probably include proba
tion and possibly some jail time.

Stanford's judicial affairs offi
cer, Sally Cole, would not disclose
whether the University is taking
disciplinary action against Van Wa
genen.
In court on Friday, Francis testi
fied that he has already undergone
"nasal reduction" surgery for a bro
ken nose, an injury allegedly inflict
ed by Van Wagenen. He said that
his breathing is still partially ob
structed and that additional opera-

tions will be required after the school year.
Francis claimed that on the night of Oct. 19, while
dancing with a group of friends, Van Wagenen
"bumped into" him on four occasions.
According to Francis, Van Wagenen and three
other males passed single file through the circle in
which Francis was dancing. Each time, he said, he
was bumped on the shoulder by Van Wagenen and at


Van Wagenen
least one of his companions.
"At first, I chalked it up to the
room being crowded," Francis
said, and as a result did not
protest.
But when Van Wagenen's
group approached the fourth
time, Francis said he "made more
than enough effort to get out of
the way."
Francis said Van Wagenen still
"bumped me hard halfway across
my chest."
At that point, Francis testi
fied, he raised his palms upward
and said, "Hey, come on," before
being knocked to the floor uncon
scious.
After the judge's ruling, Guy
Jinkerson, Van Wagenen's
lawyer, said "Mr. Francis is mis
taken about how the events

occurred. A trial will establish my
client's version of the facts is
true."
Jinkerson, who did not present
any evidence or call witnesses at
the preliminary hearing, said
Francis pushed Van Wagenen
from behind, which prompted the
defendant to punch Francis "in
self-defense."
Francis has minimized his
role in the incident to avoid a
violation of the Stanford's
Honor Code, Jinkerson said.
"Once a transcript of the trial is
prepared, I'm going to send Mr.
Francis' testimony, as well as a
videotape of the testimony of
witnesses to Stanford and rec
ommend that the University
look into the conduct of Mr.
Francis."
Van Wagenen "is an honors
student, not a bully-type,"
Jinkerson said. "It is uncon
scionable that he is charged with
a felony."

According to the police report,
Van Wagenen said he bumped
into Francis accidentally on the
dance floor, and was pushed by
him. Van Wagenen said he then
asked Francis, "Why did you do
that?" to which Francis respond
ed, "You were fucking bumping
into me!"
The defendant told police that
he hit Francis only after seeing
him clench his fists belligerent
ly-
Van Wagenen admitted to con
suming some beer up until one
hour before the incident, which
occurred at around 11:30 p.m.
Francis testified Friday that he
does not drink or swear.
In perhaps the most com
pelling testimony at the hearing,
Francis related his confronta
tion with Van Wagenen in the
Cedro foyer shortly after the
assault.
Francis said that Van Wage
nen asked him, "What do you

want, are you looking for more?"
Francis said he responded,
"Why did you hit me?"
"After I asked why he hit me,
he said, 'You came looking for it.'
He also said I got in his face,"
Francis testified.
Smith said the charges against
Van Wagenen could still be
reduced from a felony to a misde
meanor, although she "sincerely
hopes not — not considering the
injuries inflicted on Scott Fran-
CIS.
Jinkerson said he was not
offered a plea bargain to reduce
the charges to misdemeanor sta
tus, and conceded that if he had,
Van Wagenen would have had to
"consider it very seriously."
Smith said she has received
several letters in support of Van
Wagenen through Jinkerson. She
said they are mostly from
acquaintances of the defendant's
family and friends from his high
school.
