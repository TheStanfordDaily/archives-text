## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
A Santa Clara County Municipal Court judge Fri
day ordered freshman Brodie Van Wagenen to stand
trial for allegedly hitting another student last Octo
ber.
Van Wagenen, the starting right fielder for the
Stanford baseball team, is accused of punching ju
nior Scott Francis twice at a party in Cedro. He is
charged with felony battery with great bodily injury.
Judge Rise Jones Pichon ruled that there is
"strong suspicion" that the offense was committed,
and set Van Wagenen arraignment for June 7 in
Santa Clara County Superior Court.
Van Wagenen faces up to four years in prison if
convicted.
Supervising District Attorney Margo Smith said
she expects that Van Wagenen's previously clean po
lice record will most likely keep him out of prison. In
stead, a guilty verdict would probably include proba
tion and possibly some jail time.

Stanford's judicial affairs offi
cer, Sally Cole, would not disclose
whether the University is taking
disciplinary action against Van Wa
genen.
In court on Friday, Francis testi
fied that he has already undergone
"nasal reduction" surgery for a bro
ken nose, an injury allegedly inflict
ed by Van Wagenen. He said that
his breathing is still partially ob
structed and that additional opera-

tions will be required after the school year.
Francis claimed that on the night of Oct. 19, while
dancing with a group of friends, Van Wagenen
"bumped into" him on four occasions.
According to Francis, Van Wagenen and three
other males passed single file through the circle in
which Francis was dancing. Each time, he said, he
was bumped on the shoulder by Van Wagenen and at
