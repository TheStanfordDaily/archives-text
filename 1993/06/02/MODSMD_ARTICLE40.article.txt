# Clark plugs holes in Cardinal offense
## 
### Andy Eiser Editorial staff 
Monte Clark knows perfection.
As offensive line coach for the
1972 Miami Dolphins — the only
team in National Football League
history to complete a perfect sea
son — Clark saw all five of his
starters earn All-Pro honors while
paving the way for the most potent
rushing offense ever.
However, when he accepted
Stanford coach Bill Walsh's offer
last January to serve in the same
capacity for the Cardinal, Clark
knew he was stepping into a situa
tion that was less than ideal. Stan
ford's blockers yielded 56 sacks in
12 regular-season games in 1992,
and then-offensive line coach Scott
Schuhmann was named Universi
ty Recruiting Coordinator to make
way for Clark's arrival.
Still, Clark felt drawn to the
challenge of working for Walsh, an
old friend whom he preceded as
head coach of the San Francisco
49ers, leading them to an 8-6
record in 1976. Aside from the
Cardinal's recent rise to national
prominence, another aspect of the
Stanford case stuck out in Clark's
mind, calling him away from
retirement as a color analyst on
Michigan State's sidelines and lur
ing him to the boundaries of the
field at Stanford Stadium.
"Everyone blamed the left tack
le position for all the sacks," Clark
said of the position vacated by Bob
Whitfield's early exit to the NFL in
1992. "I looked at the tapes and
saw that the left tackle was not the
only one at fault. Quarterbacks,
tight ends and wide receivers are
also involved in a sack."
During the Cardinal's four
week spring practice season in
April, Clark addressed the issue of
coordination among those respon
sible for protecting Stanford quar
terback Steve Stenstrom.
"There is a subtle change in
technique," Clark said. "Eveiyone
has a greater understanding of
whom to block."
With greater understanding,
however, comes a responsibility on
the part of the Cardinal offensive
front to shed its reputation as
America's largest line by losing the
pounds that go with it, said Clark.

"Our being the biggest line in
America is one of the worst things
you can say about us," Clark said.
Rather than fielding a Unit of
"pachyderms" — his term for the
300-plus pound blockers Stanford
featured in each of the past two
seasons — Clark stresses mobility,
movement and quickness in a pat
tern-blocking scheme designed to
trap oncoming blitzers.
"You need cooperation to avoid
sacks," Clark said.
At 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, Clark
— who manned the line for USC in
the 1950s before toiling for the
49ers, Dallas Cowboys and Cleve
land Browns during an 11-year
NFL playing career — has received
nothing but cooperation from his
latest charges.
"At Stanford, the players are

smart and have great mental abili
ties," Clark said. "We have devel
oped a mutual respect."
Clark respects the manner in
which Stanford's blockers have
taken to his system thus far, and
sees a better future on the horizon
for the oft-maligned Cardinal line,
which returns four of five starters
from its 1992 squad. In particular,
sophomore right guard Jeff Buck
ey grabs his attention.
"If he's not a No. 1 draft pick
when he's through at Stanford,
then I'm a Chinese aviator," Clark
said.
More important than raising
individual hopes for professional
glory, however, Clark hopes to
instill a new meaning of success in
his players.
"I want my offensive linemen to

be the best in the business, to have
the self-satisfaction of knowing
they've done their best," Clark said.
Walsh grants full permission to
Clark to alter and improve Stan
ford's offensive gameplan, which
figures to be more explosive and
pass-oriented than ever before.
"Monte has been the best line
coach in all of football since the
'705," Walsh said. "He brings the
very best of teaching ability and
credibility to the job."
Clark intends to deliver versa
tility to his new job, as well as a
work ethic reminiscent of a certain
perfect memory in his past.
"On that '72 Dolphins team,
there was a sense of pride and a
sense of urgency," Clark said. "I
want to establish the precision we
had on that offensive line."
