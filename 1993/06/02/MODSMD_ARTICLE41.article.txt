# Winning never comes easy: don't take success for granted
## 
### 
THAT'S IT. It's over. After four
years of watching the greatest com
bined men's and women's colle
giate athletic teams in the country, I'll be
heading back to a world where the Lakers
don't always win and the Yankees rarely
do, where my favorite sports heroes don't
work on my Comm 110 project with me,
and where newspapers photograph ath
letes fully clothed.
Geez, I'm depressing myself.
I'll admit it, I've been spoiled at
Stanford. You like football? How about
if we make Bill Walsh the coach and win
the Blockbuster Bowl, finishing No. 9 in
the country? Women's basketball? How
do two NCAA titles grab you? The ten
nis teams stopped counting champi
onships at 20 and the swimming teams
make the rest of the field look like a
joke.
If your conception of Stanford sports
stops there — and for many fans, it does
— you don't know much about athletics
at this school. If anything teaches you
that, it's writing about them.
As a fan, it's easy for me to take all

that winning for granted. As a writer,
however, I know better. I know that Bev
Oden spent hundreds of hours working
and sweating on a volleyball court to get
that championship ring on her finger. I
know that one of Kim Shasby's dual ten
nis match victories came only after the
pain of blistering her feet throughout
the match due to poorly-fitting thera
peutic shoes. I haven't found many wins
out there that have come easy, and it's
only made me respect the winners more.
Then there are those whose hard
work and effort didn't always result in a
win. Members of the Stanford softball
team have endured some of the worst
seasons you can imagine, yet still devot
ed a great deal of time and effort to the
game. Marcus Lollie's only reward for
four years of intensity and leadership
on the basketball court was a record los
ing season in his senior year.
Of course, that's not entirely true.
Lollie will take more than the simple
win-loss record from his Stanford
career, and so should we. I think a lot of
people here forget that it's not a disap

pointment to have your team finish the
year No. 2 in the country, or fail to win
the NCAA trophy two years running.
Many schools don't come within a mile
of an NCAA title — often, they're the
underdog team Stanford schedules

early in the season to "tune-up" for the
conference schedule. But you better
believe that a win over Stanford is a big
thing for that squad.
I saw that when San Jose State's
men's basketball team, owners of only
two wins all last season, produced an
upset victory over the Cardinal in one of

those "tune-ups." The Spartans could
never hope for an NCAA title, and
would eventually fall short of the tour
nament yet again. I couldn't help but
think, though, that here was a group of
fans who understood the value of a win.
Two wins all last season, and they had a
packed house that night, some fans
painted with blue and gold body paint
screaming fanatically for their team.
Episodes like that teach you never to
take success for granted, and always
appreciate the success you have. It's a
good lesson off the court too.
Thanks to the Stanford women's vol
leyball team for proving that persis
tence pays off, and for making my trip
to Albuquerque unforgettable. UCLA —
the best women's volleyball team ever?
Hmmm. . .
Thanks to the men's basketball team
for enduring the hardest season in his
tory with class, and for giving me a
glimpse of the future of Stanford bas
ketball. Some of my favorite memories
are still there in Maples Pavilion.
Thanks also to the No. 2 Stanford

women's tennis team for graciously
granting me time to tell all the stories,
and for playing nothing but consistent
ly high-quality tennis. I never watched
a dull match in Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, and it was a joy to cover you.
To the 1992-93 NCAA Champions in
men's and women's swimming, men's
gymnastics, and women's volleyball,
congratulations on a dream fulfilled.
And finally, to the thousands of Stan
ford sports fans who took time out of
homework to take in a game or two,
keep it up. There's more to life at Stan
ford than problem sets and your GPA,
and it's good to discover that sooner
rather than later.
As for me, I'm heading south to
watch the Dodgers, Lakers and Raiders
for the next year or so. Yeah, I know.
Sucks to be me.
But I'll also follow the Cardinal,
wherever they play. They'll always be
my team.

public policy and psychology. So there.

ing season in his senior year.
Of course, that's not entirely true.
Lollie will take more than the simple
win-loss record from his Stanford
career, and so should we. I think a lot of
people here forget that it's not a disap

pointment to have your team finish the
year No. 2 in the country, or fail to win
the NCAA trophy two years running.
Many schools don't come within a mile
of an NCAA title — often, they're the
underdog team Stanford schedules

early in the season to "tune-up" for the
conference schedule. But you better
believe that a win over Stanford is a big
thing for that squad.
I saw that when San Jose State's
men's basketball team, owners of only
two wins all last season, produced an
upset victory over the Cardinal in one of

those "tune-ups." The Spartans could
never hope for an NCAA title, and
would eventually fall short of the tour
nament yet again. I couldn't help but
think, though, that here was a group of
fans who understood the value of a win.
Two wins all last season, and they had a
packed house that night, some fans
painted with blue and gold body paint
screaming fanatically for their team.
Episodes like that teach you never to
take success for granted, and always
appreciate the success you have. It's a
good lesson off the court too.
Thanks to the Stanford women's vol
leyball team for proving that persis
tence pays off, and for making my trip
to Albuquerque unforgettable. UCLA —
the best women's volleyball team ever?
Hmmm. . .
Thanks to the men's basketball team
for enduring the hardest season in his
tory with class, and for giving me a
glimpse of the future of Stanford bas
ketball. Some of my favorite memories
are still there in Maples Pavilion.
Thanks also to the No. 2 Stanford

women's tennis team for graciously
granting me time to tell all the stories,
and for playing nothing but consistent
ly high-quality tennis. I never watched
a dull match in Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, and it was a joy to cover you.
To the 1992-93 NCAA Champions in
men's and women's swimming, men's
gymnastics, and women's volleyball,
congratulations on a dream fulfilled.
And finally, to the thousands of Stan
ford sports fans who took time out of
homework to take in a game or two,
keep it up. There's more to life at Stan
ford than problem sets and your GPA,
and it's good to discover that sooner
rather than later.
As for me, I'm heading south to
watch the Dodgers, Lakers and Raiders
for the next year or so. Yeah, I know.
Sucks to be me.
But I'll also follow the Cardinal,
wherever they play. They'll always be
my team.
