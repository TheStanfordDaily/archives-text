# Men's crew travels to Cincinnati for championships
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Acting on the principle, "It's
not how you start the season, it's
how you end it,"the Cardinal
men's crew team has managed to
turn a poor start into a berth in
the national-championship race
at the Cincinnati Regatta June
11-12.
Coming off a final month of

excellent racing, Stanford travels
to Cincinnati as a surprise under
dog. After setting a blazing school
record of 5 minutes, 42 seconds
against UC-Davis at the begin
ning of May, the Cardinal contin
ued its dominance, defeating
UCLA at the Newport Regatta.
Stanford finished off the regular
season in spectacular fashion,
edging California by one second at
the Pacific Coast Rowing Champi

onship to earn a berth in Nation
als.
Coach Wieslaw Kujda predicts
a powerful field of competition,
with Brown, Pennsylvania and
Washington set to face Stanford.
The entire field has not yet been
decided, however, as Cal, Yale and
Northeastern — among others —
await invitations based on races
scheduled for later this week.
"The biggest problem will be

psychological," Kujda said. "For
the past three years we've been
scheduling our practices to peak
at Pac-lOs, not Nationals. The
question is if we can maintain our
speed through Nationals."
Despite his concern, Kujda sees
the Cardinal as having an excel
lent opportunity to impress some
of the traditional crew establish
ment in Cincinnati.
"The crew isn't scared of the

East Coast schools," Kujda said.
"We're going to go 100 percent,
no matter what, and I think we
can still go a little faster than we
did at Pac-lOs."
The National Championships
give graduating seniors Josh
Geiger and Martin Schwartz and
coxswain Matt Rollefson their
final shot at a title. The three
seniors are joined by junior Sher
man Knight and a heavy sopho
more contingent of Robert Taylor,
Robert Dexter, Josh Burgel,
Robert Bigler and Darren Rice.
Kujda plans to increase the
intensity of this week's practices,
then to tone down to a standard
week of preparation, before the
crew's departure at the conclu
sion of finals.
The regatta will be held at East
Fork Park in Harsha Lake, Ohio,
about 20 miles east of Cincinnati.
The extreme depth of the lake
makes for very fast times in the
2000-meter race. If more than
seven boats compete, heats will be
run Friday to determine the qual
ifiers for Saturday's final.
