# Students brew up homemade beer
## 
### Lesley Edwards Staff writer 
A large pot of sludgy, greenish
brown liquid simmers on the
stove, emanating a decidedly dank,
grassy odor. Senior Pete Jeans
stirs it patiently, smiling with sat
isfaction. "This is going to be a
good batch," he said. "I can feel it."
To the untrained eye, the con
tents of the pot resemble boiled
peat moss with a layer of thick
brownish-white foam covering the
top. The liquid certainly doesn't
appear tasty, or even safe to ingest.
But Jeans and his housemate,
Jen Bloomer, anxiously anticipate
swilling down the product that the
murky stuff will become — home
made beer.
Jeans and Bloomer, who gradu
ated from Stanford two years ago,
joined the ranks of Stanford stu
dents who make their own
brewskies after hearing about a
friend's success in home brewing.
Bloomer recalls joking around
with her housemates about a cre
ating a beer for pot smokers, the
same people for whom the leg
endary Ben and Jerry created their
candy-rich ice cream.
"It was like something from the
Pathological Liar (of 'Saturday
Night Live' fame)," Bloomer said.
"Doug (another housemate) said,
'Yeah, we could make our own beer
and our own labels and sell it. It
could be the Ben & Jerry's of beer
— we'll call it Stoner's Brew. On
the label we could say that a por
tion of the cost of every bottle goes
toward legalizing marijuana."'
At the time, Bloomer needed a
job, and was only half-joking about
trying to market a home brew.
Thus far, she and her housemates
have only brewed occasionally, and
have consumed every bottle —
with the help of their friends.
The duo said there are plenty of
good reasons to brew their own
beer, even if they don't make it
rich. "I just think it's fun," Jeans
said. "I like to cook."
"It's kind of neat to drink some
thing that you made, even if it's
not that good," Bloomer added.
"The other motivation is that
American beer sucks."
Other Stanford students, also
dissatisfied with the taste of com
mercial beers, have taken up home
brewing. The "Midnight Brewers," a
group of five male sophomores who

wish to remain anonymous, said
that one possible benefit to brewing
their own mead, a type of fermented
honey, is that it could enhance their
potency and chances of producing
male offspring in the future.
According to "The New Com
plete Joy of Home Brewing," this
8,000-year-old beverage, histori
cally imbibed by kings, is "imbued
with legendary intoxicating and
aphrodisiacal qualities" and has
"heralded in and out many a fasci
nating orgy."
Although they may have
romance in mind, the Midnight
Brewers said they take their brew
ing very seriously. Sterilizing all
implements with chlorine is
imperative, one said, and it doesn't
hurt to be a science major.
"This is Biochemistry 101,
right here," another said, referring
to the gypsum, acid powder and
Irish moss spread out on the
counter, waiting to be added to the
boiling honey-water mixture.
Once the liquid cools, they stir
in the most important ingredient
— the yeast. "We like to call [the
yeast particles] our beer elves," the
brewer continued. "They do all the
work."
And work they will, for at least
a nine-day fermentation period,
before the mead is transferred
from a large container into careful
ly sterilized bottles.
Disaster can strike if the home
brewer fails to fend off encroach
ing bacteria at all times during the
cooking and bottling process. The
Midnight Brewers use chlorine
bleach and hot water liberally to
sterilize all of their equipment
If bacteria make their way into
the bottles, they consume the sug
ars that the yeast need to produce
carbon dioxide. The result is a flat,
sour-smelling product — a definite
let-down after weeks of anticipa
tion.
The Midnight Brewers, so
named because their first brewing
attempt took place between mid
night and 2 a.m., have been quite
successful in their endeavors.
Since the beginning of spring
quarter, they have produced a
"Genius Ale," an alcoholic cider, a
honey-ginger beer and mead. The
Genius Ale, which they labeled
"Theoretically a Study Beer," was
delicious, they claimed, while the
cider left a little to be desired.
Recalling the cider-making

experience, one said, "While it was
cooking, it smelled so good, like
apple pie. But then it just went to
hell. We tried to spice it up with
cinnamon and stuff, but it didn't
really help."
But the beer met with wide
approval from their friends —
except for those who just don't like
the taste of anything with more
flavor than Bud Light, they said.
Americans, by and large, have
been corrupted by übiquitous
watery substitutes, one brewer
complained.
"We are making a plea for more
people to drink beer with non
screw-top bottles," one said.
"There are a ton of micro-brew
eries around that are making good
beer, but it's like $3 a bottle. If
more people would drink it, it
wouldn't cost as much."
Home-brewing, while not a
money-saver, is reasonably inex
pensive, the Midnight Brewers
said. The initial brewing kit costs
$50, and additional equipment as
well as ingredients can bring start
up costs closer to $100. After that,
a batch of beer (two cases worth)
only costs about $15-$25, one
brewer estimated.
While cost may not be a prob
lem for home-brewers, legality
may be — at least for those under
21. According to Chris O'Hanlon
of California's Alcoholic Beverage
Control office, it is illegal for any
one under 21 to possess a alcoholic
beverages, including those they
have made themselves. "I don't see
how they could make beer without
possessing it,"he said.
According to Brian Johnson,
the co-owner of Fermentation

Frenzy, a home-brew supply store
in IjOS Altos, brewers are limited
only by their imagination. While
the most popular varieties of beer
among brewers are pale ale and
British dark, he said, "Others
make something different and out
rageous every time."
Just recently, for instance, a
friend of Johnson's made Gummi-
Bear beer. Johnson was skeptical,
but after tasting it, had to admit
that he liked it. Another exotic
option is chili-pepper beer.
However, whether the form of
alcohol is common or exotic, prob
lems with the process of making it
can present brewers with some
less-than-tasty liquids. Jeans and
Bloomer have attempted five
batches of beer, to date. Two of the
batches tasted great, two came out
sour, and the most recent one
ended up on the ceiling.
Apparently, the spill-off tube
that allows carbon dioxide to
escape from the fermentation tank
became clogged, and when
Bloomer lightly touched it, brown,
gelatinous goo exploded every
where.
According to Johnson, this is a
common problem that can be
avoided by following instructions
carefully.
Johnson and his wife have been
brewing together since their col
lege days. He got into brewing only
because a friend of his was short of
cash.
"I had done some work for a
friend who didn't have any money,
only beer kits, so he paid me off
with a beer kit," Johnson recalled.
"I started brewing and it came out
great. I just never stopped."

Jeans and Bloomer, who gradu
ated from Stanford two years ago,
joined the ranks of Stanford stu
dents who make their own
brewskies after hearing about a
friend's success in home brewing.
Bloomer recalls joking around
with her housemates about a cre
ating a beer for pot smokers, the
same people for whom the leg
endary Ben and Jerry created their
candy-rich ice cream.
"It was like something from the
Pathological Liar (of 'Saturday
Night Live' fame)," Bloomer said.
"Doug (another housemate) said,
'Yeah, we could make our own beer
and our own labels and sell it. It
could be the Ben & Jerry's of beer
— we'll call it Stoner's Brew. On
the label we could say that a por
tion of the cost of every bottle goes
toward legalizing marijuana."'
At the time, Bloomer needed a
job, and was only half-joking about
trying to market a home brew.
Thus far, she and her housemates
have only brewed occasionally, and
have consumed every bottle —
with the help of their friends.
The duo said there are plenty of
good reasons to brew their own
beer, even if they don't make it
rich. "I just think it's fun," Jeans
said. "I like to cook."
"It's kind of neat to drink some
thing that you made, even if it's
not that good," Bloomer added.
"The other motivation is that
American beer sucks."
Other Stanford students, also
dissatisfied with the taste of com
mercial beers, have taken up home
brewing. The "Midnight Brewers," a
group of five male sophomores who

wish to remain anonymous, said
that one possible benefit to brewing
their own mead, a type of fermented
honey, is that it could enhance their
potency and chances of producing
male offspring in the future.
According to "The New Com
plete Joy of Home Brewing," this
8,000-year-old beverage, histori
cally imbibed by kings, is "imbued
with legendary intoxicating and
aphrodisiacal qualities" and has
"heralded in and out many a fasci
nating orgy."
Although they may have
romance in mind, the Midnight
Brewers said they take their brew
ing very seriously. Sterilizing all
implements with chlorine is
imperative, one said, and it doesn't
hurt to be a science major.
"This is Biochemistry 101,
right here," another said, referring
to the gypsum, acid powder and
Irish moss spread out on the
counter, waiting to be added to the
boiling honey-water mixture.
Once the liquid cools, they stir
in the most important ingredient
— the yeast. "We like to call [the
yeast particles] our beer elves," the
brewer continued. "They do all the
work."
And work they will, for at least
a nine-day fermentation period,
before the mead is transferred
from a large container into careful
ly sterilized bottles.
Disaster can strike if the home
brewer fails to fend off encroach
ing bacteria at all times during the
cooking and bottling process. The
Midnight Brewers use chlorine
bleach and hot water liberally to
sterilize all of their equipment
If bacteria make their way into
the bottles, they consume the sug
ars that the yeast need to produce
carbon dioxide. The result is a flat,
sour-smelling product — a definite
let-down after weeks of anticipa
tion.
The Midnight Brewers, so
named because their first brewing
attempt took place between mid
night and 2 a.m., have been quite
successful in their endeavors.
Since the beginning of spring
quarter, they have produced a
"Genius Ale," an alcoholic cider, a
honey-ginger beer and mead. The
Genius Ale, which they labeled
"Theoretically a Study Beer," was
delicious, they claimed, while the
cider left a little to be desired.
Recalling the cider-making

experience, one said, "While it was
cooking, it smelled so good, like
apple pie. But then it just went to
hell. We tried to spice it up with
cinnamon and stuff, but it didn't
really help."
But the beer met with wide
approval from their friends —
except for those who just don't like
the taste of anything with more
flavor than Bud Light, they said.
Americans, by and large, have
been corrupted by übiquitous
watery substitutes, one brewer
complained.
"We are making a plea for more
people to drink beer with non
screw-top bottles," one said.
"There are a ton of micro-brew
eries around that are making good
beer, but it's like $3 a bottle. If
more people would drink it, it
wouldn't cost as much."
Home-brewing, while not a
money-saver, is reasonably inex
pensive, the Midnight Brewers
said. The initial brewing kit costs
$50, and additional equipment as
well as ingredients can bring start
up costs closer to $100. After that,
a batch of beer (two cases worth)
only costs about $15-$25, one
brewer estimated.
While cost may not be a prob
lem for home-brewers, legality
may be — at least for those under
21. According to Chris O'Hanlon
of California's Alcoholic Beverage
Control office, it is illegal for any
one under 21 to possess a alcoholic
beverages, including those they
have made themselves. "I don't see
how they could make beer without
possessing it,"he said.
According to Brian Johnson,
the co-owner of Fermentation

Frenzy, a home-brew supply store
in IjOS Altos, brewers are limited
only by their imagination. While
the most popular varieties of beer
among brewers are pale ale and
British dark, he said, "Others
make something different and out
rageous every time."
Just recently, for instance, a
friend of Johnson's made Gummi-
Bear beer. Johnson was skeptical,
but after tasting it, had to admit
that he liked it. Another exotic
option is chili-pepper beer.
However, whether the form of
alcohol is common or exotic, prob
lems with the process of making it
can present brewers with some
less-than-tasty liquids. Jeans and
Bloomer have attempted five
batches of beer, to date. Two of the
batches tasted great, two came out
sour, and the most recent one
ended up on the ceiling.
Apparently, the spill-off tube
that allows carbon dioxide to
escape from the fermentation tank
became clogged, and when
Bloomer lightly touched it, brown,
gelatinous goo exploded every
where.
According to Johnson, this is a
common problem that can be
avoided by following instructions
carefully.
Johnson and his wife have been
brewing together since their col
lege days. He got into brewing only
because a friend of his was short of
cash.
"I had done some work for a
friend who didn't have any money,
only beer kits, so he paid me off
with a beer kit," Johnson recalled.
"I started brewing and it came out
great. I just never stopped."

A large pot of sludgy, greenish
brown liquid simmers on the
stove, emanating a decidedly dank,
grassy odor. Senior Pete Jeans
stirs it patiently, smiling with sat
isfaction. "This is going to be a
good batch," he said. "I can feel it."
To the untrained eye, the con
tents of the pot resemble boiled
peat moss with a layer of thick
brownish-white foam covering the
top. The liquid certainly doesn't
appear tasty, or even safe to ingest.

Jen Bloomer, anxiously anticipate
swilling down the product that the
