# 'It was like taking candy from a baby'
## Psych class raises money for bogus cause 
### Nami Kim 
House meetings have often
been easy prey for groups trying to
raise money — even groups that
don't exist.
Six students in Psychology 199,
"The Psychology of Mind Con
trol," raised almost $400 recently
by posing as a false charity and
making the rounds at house meet
ings as part of a class project.
"It really was like taking candy
from a baby," said Fernando
Trevino, one of the students. The
purpose of the experiment was to
demonstrate "how sales tech
niques influence the outcome of
petitions," he added.
The group's false charity, called
DEMO — Developing Educational
Minority Opportunities — was
supposedly a summer program
based in East Palo Alto.
The six students split in half,
with a "control group" that simply
asked at house meetings for dorm
funds for DEMO. The other three
students employed what experi
menter Omar Siddiqui called
"influence tactics" in making their
sales pitches, including handing
out a brochure with candy and
passing around a volunteer sheet
for help during the summer.
Although they did not expect
anyone to sign up, Siddiqui said,
the purpose of the volunteer sheet
was to induce guilt. By pledging
money, the dorm could rid them
selves of that guilt.
The control group received only
$55 out of eight attempts, while
the "influence" group received
$335 out of 15 attempts. In all, the
"influence" group was twice as
likely to get a donation as the con
trol group.
Even the dorms that did not
contribute expressed sympathy
with the cause and said they could
not give money only because it was
the end of the quarter and dorm
funds were low, Siddiqui said.
Donation checks from the
dorms have either been returned
or destroyed.
Trevino said the group's tactics
were "purposely vague." Members
entered dorms without any specif

ic game plan or even an explana
tion of the charity.
Group member Kanthi
Pericherla said the group concoct
ed the experiment because dormi
tories sometimes tend to become
what she dubs "donation sluts,"
giving money without really con
sidering the charity's validity.
The only dorm that suspected
the legitimacy of the false charity
was Loro, whose residents later
attempted to contact the organiza
tion as well as the Haas Center for
Public Service.
Loro resident Greg Schaal, who
works at the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service, said he and some of the
resident assistants had "suspected
all along, because there were no
names or numbers on the
brochure."
"We never vote on an issue
right away," said Schaal. "We ask
someone if they know of the char
ity asking for money, and usually
someone does." This one was
"shady," though, he said.
Residents in other dorms, after
learning that they had been
duped, said they were amused but
a little disturbed.
Laura Aizpuru, an RAin Casa
Zapata — which gave the largest
donation at $75 — said, "The
worst thing to come out of this is
that because it's the end of the
year, this money could have been
given to a worthy charity."
Nicole Smith, the house trea
surer at Serra, said it was "a
humorous but sad statement. It
draws attention to the effects of
low attendance at house meeting.
It's a reflection on how house
meetings are really run, when
everyone is so eager to leave they
don't really pay attention."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo, who has taught Psychology
199 since 1978, said the experi
ment was "approved and moni
tored by teaching assistants to
demonstrate the effectiveness of
specific compliance strategies, and
[show] how easy it is for even
bright Stanford students and their
RAs to be taken in when they do
not question those who ask for
their money."
