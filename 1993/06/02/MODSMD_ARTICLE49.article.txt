## Freeze Frames: 1992-93 on film 
### 
The following scenes are my freeze
frames from the 1992-93 school year
— scenes or images from films 1 saw
during this period that play over and over in
my mental movie theater. Enjoy.
Two teenage girls sit helplessly in their
car as Harvey Keitel's extremely Bad
Lieutenant verbally abuses them, then
forces them to simulate a sex act while he
masturbates, effectively demonstrating the
reality of sexual harassment and police

brutality.
A procession of penguins
slowly push their misshapen
and equally misunderstood

master into a watery grave as Danny Elf
man's woeful, faux-Wagnerian score plays
in the background. An honestly touching
moment in Batman Returns that reveals
just where director Tim Burton's sympa
thies lie.
In The Crying Game, Jaye Davidson
confronts Stephen Rea at the latter's work
place, now that the former's secret has been
revealed. With just the right hint of irony,
he/she says to Rea, "Even when you were
throwing up, I could tell that you cared." No
truer words...
The motel room fades into black as the
lights slowly dim on the interracial young
lovers in Flirting, while the camera looks
down upon them, pulling further and fur
ther back until we can't see their stolen mo
ment of happiness. A few moments later,
their respective headmasters walk in...
After shooting at each other for approxi
mately 10 minutes of screen time, an under
cover cop and the villain's right-hand man
come face to face, guns drawn, pointed at
each other ... with a group of hospital pa
tients huddled fearfully between them.
Which one is Hard Boiled enough to shoot
first?
Judy Davis classifies everyone she
knows according to the animal they most
resemble while Liam Neeson does his
damnedest to make her come in Woody

N'Gai Croal

Allen's semi-autobiographical Husbands
and Wives.
A well-dressed man takes off his sun
glasses and uses them as a mirror to look
over his shoulder, spotting the reflection of a
sniper's scope. A brief instant later, The
Killer springs into action — and the out
come is never in doubt.
A nerdy Robert De Niro struggles to
keep watching television while Uma Thur
man plants kisses all over his face in Mad

Dog and Glory. Despite
his resistance, she manages
to break through his ner
vous stoicism, setting up the

most honest sex scene in recent American
film.
After terrorizing a young Malcolm X
and his family, a group of Klansmen ride off
into the light of a huge moon that's sitting
just below the horizon — Spike Lee's sly al
lusion to his first film school project, a paro
dy of D.W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation."
A naive documentary crew keeps the
camera rolling as their subject, a serial killer,
charms his way into an old woman's apart
ment and scares her into having a heart at
tack. As she gasps futilely for air, he explains
that he didn't need to waste a bullet because
he noticed her heart medication sitting on
the table. A typical example of the scabrous
comedy Man Bites Dog.
Having severed a police officer's ear with
a straight razor, the most psychotic of the
Reservoir Dogs walks out to his car, takes
out a can of gasoline and returns — in a sin
gle, unbroken and terrifying shot. And the
only other person who can stop him is lying
in a pool of b100d...
Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and
Jaimz Woolvett sit atop a hill in broad
daylight, watching one of the men they
were hired to kill die slowly and painful
ly from a stomach wound in Unforgiv
en. "We all got it coming," Clint says
later — words that resonate throughout
the film. ■
