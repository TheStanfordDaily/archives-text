# Programs get a $1.4M boost
## 2 grants will bolster multiculturalism, education review 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The University recently re
ceived two grants totaling $1.4
million to further multicultural
development and support the re
evaluation of undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford.
The grants — $1 million to be
shared by the School of Humani
ties and Sciences and the Office
of Student Affairs and $400,000
for a presidential commission in
vestigating undergraduate edu
cation — were donated by the
Irvine Foundation, a private or
ganization that sponsors many

university and community pro
jects in California.
The first grant will help en
able "the School of Humanities
and Sciences to develop all sorts
of multicultural enrichment pro
grams," said Evelyn Kelsey,
foundation and corporate rela
tions director in the Office of De
velopment.
Daniel Ramirez, who coordi
nates Irvine grants in the School
of Humanities and Sciences, said
10 percent of the grant will sup
port programs for incoming
freshmen and 20 percent will go
to graduate student research and
orientation. Most of the remain

der will fund other undergradu
ate and graduate research and
student mentoring programs.
For example, the grant will
support programs such as the
funding of research assistants at
the Center for Chicano Research
and research mentors for minori
ty students.
The $1 million gift follows two
separate donations from the
Irvine Foundation to Stanford in
1988 and 1990 to support multi
cultural curriculum develop
ment and minority student pro
grams, said Ramirez.
The Irvine Foundation's sec
ond grant, for $400,000, will
finance University President
Gerhard Casper's recently creat
ed commission to examine
undergraduate education at
Stanford.
"The commission will exam
ine the fundamentals of under
graduate education — every
thing from curriculum require
ments to the length of time it
takes to earn a degree," said
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning.
Cox said the commission,
which Casper outlined in his
recent "state of the University"
address, will also take a "broad
based" look at a range of other
issues, including residential edu
cation and the undergraduate
advising system.
Although the commission's
budget "is currently more con
ceptual than highly specific," the
$400,000 will probably be used
to pay the salary of a faculty
member who will work full time
as chair of the committee, Cox
said.
In addition, it will cover staff
support, supplies and travel
expenses for alumni and com
mission members who will be
traveling to meetings and to visit
other universities.
The Irvine Foundation's 1988
grant provided Stanford with $2
million to "put more minority
students in the academic
pipeline," Ramirez said.
Among other things, the
money went to support mentor
ing programs, research opportu
nities, graduate student recruit
ment and retention programs for
minority students.
In addition, the foundation
donated $1 million in 1990 for a
program to make Stanford's cur
riculum more multicultural.
The grant, which will not
expire until 1995, stipulates
among other things that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences use the funds to develop at
least three new courses per year,
modify three current courses per
year and support faculty devel
opment in multicultural curricu
lar issues.
