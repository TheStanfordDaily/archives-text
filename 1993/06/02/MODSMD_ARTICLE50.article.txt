## What to do after selling our souls 
### 
We think we're sell-outs. Kinda like
Porno For Pyros believing they're
actually doing something differ
ent than Jane's Addiction, besides playing
shorter sets.
No. Check that. We think we are over
the-counter, blisterpacked™ sluts. After all,
we write for The Daily.
Believe us — we're not doing it for the
$6.83 paychecks, or the Friday afternoon

lonely-heart, happy hours.
Yeah you know, those meat
market hook-up sessions with
any whining "I have no sex
life" columnist or feature
writer of your choice. Or their
choice. Strong sense of hierar
chy over at The Daily.

No, indeed, we write for The Daily for
loftier reasons. Like our resumes:
"AND WE'D LIKE TO COME OUT
CLEARLY IN FAVOR OF THE RECORD
INDUSTRY'S ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE
WASTE BY ELIMINATING THE LONG
BOX."
We know who that was f0r.... 'Cause,
they'll never have time to read the whole
column anyway.
Writing for The Daily, the Blythe Fund of
campus publications, helps us like playing
saxophone on MTV.
As sell-outs, we live in fear of the under
ground exposing us for what we really are;
and for not thinking we're cool, no matter
how hard we try. We can't sleep at nights
knowing we were exposed by the ultra-cool,
ultra-informed Stanford hip-hop crowd for
the way we ran Hip-Hop Night.
To us, there appears to be two ways to ap
proach a scene: There's the underground
approach, already knowing all the parame
ters and permutations of quality. Then
there's us clueless sellouts who have no idea
what's going on and want to learn.
We got schooled over Hip-Hop Night:
When people told us our live-acts were
wack, we didn't realize how much better pay-

Pat Dote
Jim Haljun

ing $14 would make them sound when they
opened for acts like Digable Planets. Nor did
we realize how authoritative the KMEL Top
-20 is, and how unwilling people are to listen
to anything not in the hype-light.
We didn't even get the $6.83. Although
we wouldn't trade knowing the difference
between Dr. Dre and Frankie Cutlass, or the
privilege of working with some of the most
exciting personalities in hip-hop for any

amount of crowd attitude.
If we offended anyone by
managing Hip-Hop Night,
we'll be glad to give them
their money back. You
know who we think is un
derground? Jimmy Hofifa.

In addition to him
though, there's no underground. If there
ever was one, it's now been killed, stuffed
and sent down the fashion runway as a con
sumer-accessible line available at a mall
near you.
In a country where everything is commer
cialized as unique, select and perhaps danger
ous, the ability for anything to use its unique
ness, selectness and danger as actual motiva
tion to shift the status quo approaches zero.
Greil Marcus, author of "Lipstick Traces,"
suggests in a recent interview with the San
Jose Mercury news: "Sometimes when you
are in a club and a band is playing, you can
have the feeling that you are in a different
world. But you can't declare it, that this is
our own little world and we are not going to
live by the outside world's rules. I think it's a
naive, somewhat self-righteous attitude."
In the '90s, where two weeks ago is an
cient history, where every style has a prof
itable demographic and is just a remote
control click away, the underground has no
other role than to market to people who
think they can't be marketed to. If any
changes can be made, if any quality can be
produced, it will only happen through step
ping out of a bogus commitment to being
harder-to-reach-than-thou. ■
