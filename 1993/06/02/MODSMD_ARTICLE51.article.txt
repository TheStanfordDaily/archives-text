# Radio head

### Janar Stewart 
As my headlights bent into white lines late one
night, a song with a sweet melody and a slow
groove went head to head with some forget
table garage band on Live 105's "New Music Chal
lenge."
The singer half mumbled, half cooed the first
verse, as the lyrics, "when you were here before/
couldn't look you in the eye," caught my ear.
A guitar spat out through the amps as the voice de
clared, "I'm a creep/ I'm a weirdo/ what the hell am I
doing here?/1 don't belong here."
By the time the singer revealed, "I wanna have con
trol/ I want a perfect body/ I wanna perfect soul/ I
want you to notice when I'm not around," I already
had pulled onto the shoulder and was staring into the
empty road.
Maybe it was the frustration from a difficult day at
work; maybe it was the tug-of-love war with my then
significant other; heck, maybe it was that time of the
month. But whatever it was, I had been hit by the
sheer power of Radiohead's "Creep" and it put me on
a mission.
A mission from God.
How did this fivesome from England create a song
with self-loathing lyrics interrupted by a nervous gui
tar that so perfectly illustrates how insecurity can tip
your boat? And how could I marry one of them?
So begins the interview with Ed O'Brien, dubbed
"polite guitar" by the band's press release — as
opposed to guitarist Jonny Greenwood's "abu
sive guitar" and lead singer Thom Yorke's "inaudible
guitar."

Speaking via fiber optics from clear across the At
lantic, O'Brien challenges me to come up with a new
angle on the popular single off their somewhat-eclec
tic debut album, "Pablo Honey."
"['Creep'] is the blessing and the bane," he con
fides, laughing. "It's wonderful that the song has done
so well and touched so many people, but then that's all
that people (reporters) seem to be interested in."
Mired in an apparent lack of originality, I fumble
with my notepad hoping he says something inspiring
— or just tangential.
Fortunately, he saves me, mentioning that "Creep"
didn't receive much airplay in Britain because the dee
jays at Radio One — the country's only station —
"deemed it to be too miserable for the people of Eng
land."
Naturally, O'Brien has a beef with their simplistic
psychoanalysis of the millions of British listeners. He
shares his glee at the poetic justice of the single's suc
cess in the States, saying, "[Americans] want the grim
reality. [When you're feeling miserable], it's nice to
know that someone's down in the dumps as well."
Since Radio One monopolizes Britain's radio lis
tening market, O'Brien sees censorship over there as
"more underhanded."
"It's not like America, where you've got Tipper
Gore running around putting stickers on things," he
relates, describing Radio One's music collection as
one brimming with uplifting pop music and truly
golden oldies from the likes of Frank Sinatra and
Frankie Valli.

Radlohead masterfully wrings everyday frustration and nervous energy out of
catchy melodies and heavy distortion. From left: Polite guitarist Ed O'Brien, abu
sive guitarist Jonny Greenwood, Inaudible guitarist and lead singer Thorn Yorke,
bassist Colin Greenwood and drummer Phil Selway.
"l don't mind hearing Frankie Valli once a
day, but four times a day?"
Because of Britain's size, however, artists
aren't as dependent on airplay as those in the
United States, O'Brien adds. In fact, Radio
head moved 20,000 copies of their EP all by
word of mouth and by gigging, he says"It —"It
took three months."
Three months that soon led to signing
with Capitol Records and embarking on an
extensive U.S. club tour this summer. Defi
nitely an in-your-face statement to those
clueless deejays.
And the other cuts off "Pablo Honey" in
dicate that Radiohead has the spark that can
ignite their rocket to stardom. From the first
track to the last, the band proves they can
play a variety of musical styles and moods.
In "Thinking About You," a mellow folk
tune, the pleasant strums of "polite guitar"
accompany Yorke's youthful whimper. A
danceable, upbeat song, "Ripcord," displays
Radiohead's less-morose side with its catchy
melody and Yorke's playful sing-song vocals.
And with "You," Yorke's hopeless wail set
against the grinding guitar spirals cynicism to
a level even Morrissey would be proud of.
But the best songs off "Pablo Honey"
switch things up a bit. "Blow Out," my per
sonal fav — next to "Creep," of course —
starts out with a Velvet Undergroundish
groove, bells, chimes and Yorke's smooth
melt-you-like-butter vocals, before bursting

into an onslaught of gritty guitar which, by the
end of the song, literally takes off like a 747.
Even before Radiohead got signed, this
love for mixing it up pervaded their music,
and moved one record label representative to
tell them their demo sounded like six differ
ent bands. O'Brien says they played every

thing from ska to punk, to — yes — even
country and western: "We used to have a
horn section."
Why all the surprises? "We've got a real
low boredom threshold," he explains. But
O'Brien definitely doesn't want Radiohead
labeled as a "surprise band."
"Surprise is great, as long as it's not done
for the sake of it,"he says. Much of Radio
head's originality stems from the differing
musical tastes within the group, although
they all share a love for certain bands.
"We're all Neil Young fans, and massive
R.E.M. fans," O'Brien says exuberantly. Actu
ally, strains of Michael Stipes and company
surface in quite a few Radiohead cuts ("Stop
Whispering," "Vegetable," "Prove Yourself").
"We've never really revered [British rock
bands]," he confesses, listing Boston bands
The Pixies, Throwing Muses and Dinosaur Jr.

among their influences.
O'Brien admits he's the one who's into
country and western, but quickly stresses,
"good country and western — early Glen
Campbell." Hmmm, I say to myself, cringing at
the thought of one of my idols do-si-do-ing to
some balding, pot-bellied banjo player carry

ing on about his ex-lover's tight-fitting jeans.
Country and western, of course, crosses
over into folk, he continues, mentioning the
king and queen of folk, Bob Dylan and Joni
Mitchell. I quietly let out my breath, hoping
he can't detect the tell-tale sign of relief.
O'Brien raves volumes about Dylan, the
legendary lyricist, before insisting that I rush
out to the nearest record store and purchase
Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks." Unfortunate
ly, O'Brien's love for strong songs doesn't
translate into writing them, personally.
"I never write lyrics. You have to have con
fidence," he says. "If you're going to write a
song, you've got to lay yourself open."
Right now, Radiohead has written
enough songs for a second album. But
all of the recent media attention
forced them to tour earlier than they

planned, thus thwarting plans to complete
their sophomore effort during this summer.
"The idea is to have the album out by
April," he says."I hope we can do it."
O'Brien also hopes the new album turns
out considerably stronger than "Pablo
Honey." Although "Creep" was obviously a
stand-alone song, O'Brien says — partly be
cause tracks on "Pablo Honey" were written
over the course of three or four years — it was
more difficult to choose other singles from
the remaining cuts.
Also, "we recorded ["Pablo Honey"] in a
really short time," he adds. But he foresees
their next release overcoming these problems.
"There's a lot more cohesion," he says.
"We've got three or four songs that could be
really, really major."
Hopefully, Radiohead will test some of
these new songs on eager U.S. audiences
while on tour this summer. Describing a Ra
diohead show as "uptight," O'Brien says, "1
don't think people will be able to sit down
and have a drink.
"We're pretty relentless when we're play
ing," he adds. "We really get charged up be
fore gigs."
Part of that energy comes from the band
members' habit of taking their frustrations to
the stage: "Playing live is a great way of excis
ing these worries. When you see us hitting
our guitars, it's the real thing."
Oh boy, oh boy, I think to myself, already
mentally gearing up. Suddenly, O'Brien says
the magic words — when he comes to San
Francisco, I should look for him back stage:
"I'm the tall guitarist."
And I'm in groupie heaven. ■

danceable, upbeat song, "Ripcord," displays
Radiohead's less-morose side with its catchy
melody and Yorke's playful sing-song vocals.
And with "You," Yorke's hopeless wail set
against the grinding guitar spirals cynicism to
a level even Morrissey would be proud of.
But the best songs off "Pablo Honey"
switch things up a bit. "Blow Out," my per
sonal fav — next to "Creep," of course —
starts out with a Velvet Undergroundish
groove, bells, chimes and Yorke's smooth
melt-you-like-butter vocals, before bursting

into an onslaught of gritty guitar which, by the
end of the song, literally takes off like a 747.
Even before Radiohead got signed, this
love for mixing it up pervaded their music,
and moved one record label representative to
tell them their demo sounded like six differ
ent bands. O'Brien says they played every

thing from ska to punk, to — yes — even
country and western: "We used to have a
horn section."
Why all the surprises? "We've got a real
low boredom threshold," he explains. But
O'Brien definitely doesn't want Radiohead
labeled as a "surprise band."
"Surprise is great, as long as it's not done
for the sake of it,"he says. Much of Radio
head's originality stems from the differing
musical tastes within the group, although
they all share a love for certain bands.
"We're all Neil Young fans, and massive
R.E.M. fans," O'Brien says exuberantly. Actu
ally, strains of Michael Stipes and company
surface in quite a few Radiohead cuts ("Stop
Whispering," "Vegetable," "Prove Yourself").
"We've never really revered [British rock
bands]," he confesses, listing Boston bands
The Pixies, Throwing Muses and Dinosaur Jr.

among their influences.
O'Brien admits he's the one who's into
country and western, but quickly stresses,
"good country and western — early Glen
Campbell." Hmmm, I say to myself, cringing at
the thought of one of my idols do-si-do-ing to
some balding, pot-bellied banjo player carry

ing on about his ex-lover's tight-fitting jeans.
Country and western, of course, crosses
over into folk, he continues, mentioning the
king and queen of folk, Bob Dylan and Joni
Mitchell. I quietly let out my breath, hoping
he can't detect the tell-tale sign of relief.
O'Brien raves volumes about Dylan, the
legendary lyricist, before insisting that I rush
out to the nearest record store and purchase
Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks." Unfortunate
ly, O'Brien's love for strong songs doesn't
translate into writing them, personally.
"I never write lyrics. You have to have con
fidence," he says. "If you're going to write a
song, you've got to lay yourself open."
Right now, Radiohead has written
enough songs for a second album. But
all of the recent media attention
forced them to tour earlier than they

planned, thus thwarting plans to complete
their sophomore effort during this summer.
"The idea is to have the album out by
April," he says."I hope we can do it."
O'Brien also hopes the new album turns
out considerably stronger than "Pablo
Honey." Although "Creep" was obviously a
stand-alone song, O'Brien says — partly be
cause tracks on "Pablo Honey" were written
over the course of three or four years — it was
more difficult to choose other singles from
the remaining cuts.
Also, "we recorded ["Pablo Honey"] in a
really short time," he adds. But he foresees
their next release overcoming these problems.
"There's a lot more cohesion," he says.
"We've got three or four songs that could be
really, really major."
Hopefully, Radiohead will test some of
these new songs on eager U.S. audiences
while on tour this summer. Describing a Ra
diohead show as "uptight," O'Brien says, "1
don't think people will be able to sit down
and have a drink.
"We're pretty relentless when we're play
ing," he adds. "We really get charged up be
fore gigs."
Part of that energy comes from the band
members' habit of taking their frustrations to
the stage: "Playing live is a great way of excis
ing these worries. When you see us hitting
our guitars, it's the real thing."
Oh boy, oh boy, I think to myself, already
mentally gearing up. Suddenly, O'Brien says
the magic words — when he comes to San
Francisco, I should look for him back stage:
"I'm the tall guitarist."
And I'm in groupie heaven. ■
As my headlights bent into white lines late one
night, a song with a sweet melody and a slow
groove went head to head with some forget
table garage band on Live 105's "New Music Chal
lenge."
The singer half mumbled, half cooed the first
verse, as the lyrics, "when you were here before/
couldn't look you in the eye," caught my ear.
A guitar spat out through the amps as the voice de
clared, "I'm a creep/ I'm a weirdo/ what the hell am I
doing here?/1 don't belong here."
By the time the singer revealed, "I wanna have con
trol/ I want a perfect body/ I wanna perfect soul/ I
want you to notice when I'm not around," I already
had pulled onto the shoulder and was staring into the
empty road.
Maybe it was the frustration from a difficult day at
work; maybe it was the tug-of-love war with my then
significant other; heck, maybe it was that time of the
month. But whatever it was, I had been hit by the
sheer power of Radiohead's "Creep" and it put me on
a mission.
A mission from God.
How did this fivesome from England create a song
with self-loathing lyrics interrupted by a nervous gui
tar that so perfectly illustrates how insecurity can tip
your boat? And how could I marry one of them?
So begins the interview with Ed O'Brien, dubbed
"polite guitar" by the band's press release — as
opposed to guitarist Jonny Greenwood's "abu
sive guitar" and lead singer Thom Yorke's "inaudible
guitar."

Speaking via fiber optics from clear across the At
lantic, O'Brien challenges me to come up with a new
angle on the popular single off their somewhat-eclec
tic debut album, "Pablo Honey."
"['Creep'] is the blessing and the bane," he con
fides, laughing. "It's wonderful that the song has done
so well and touched so many people, but then that's all
that people (reporters) seem to be interested in."
Mired in an apparent lack of originality, I fumble
with my notepad hoping he says something inspiring
— or just tangential.
Fortunately, he saves me, mentioning that "Creep"
didn't receive much airplay in Britain because the dee
jays at Radio One — the country's only station —
"deemed it to be too miserable for the people of Eng
land."
Naturally, O'Brien has a beef with their simplistic
psychoanalysis of the millions of British listeners. He
shares his glee at the poetic justice of the single's suc
cess in the States, saying, "[Americans] want the grim
reality. [When you're feeling miserable], it's nice to
know that someone's down in the dumps as well."
Since Radio One monopolizes Britain's radio lis
tening market, O'Brien sees censorship over there as
"more underhanded."
"It's not like America, where you've got Tipper
Gore running around putting stickers on things," he
relates, describing Radio One's music collection as
one brimming with uplifting pop music and truly
golden oldies from the likes of Frank Sinatra and
Frankie Valli.

Radlohead masterfully wrings everyday frustration and nervous energy out of
catchy melodies and heavy distortion. From left: Polite guitarist Ed O'Brien, abu

"l don't mind hearing Frankie Valli once a
day, but four times a day?"
Because of Britain's size, however, artists
aren't as dependent on airplay as those in the
United States, O'Brien adds. In fact, Radio
head moved 20,000 copies of their EP all by
word of mouth and by gigging, he says"It —"It
took three months."
Three months that soon led to signing
with Capitol Records and embarking on an
extensive U.S. club tour this summer. Defi
nitely an in-your-face statement to those
clueless deejays.
And the other cuts off "Pablo Honey" in
dicate that Radiohead has the spark that can
ignite their rocket to stardom. From the first
track to the last, the band proves they can
play a variety of musical styles and moods.

Part of that energy comes from the band
members' habit of taking their frustrations to
the stage: "Playing live is a great way of excis
ing these worries. When you see us hitting
our guitars, it's the real thing."
Oh boy, oh boy, I think to myself, already
mentally gearing up. Suddenly, O'Brien says
the magic words — when he comes to San
Francisco, I should look for him back stage:
"I'm the tall guitarist."
And I'm in groupie heaven. ■
