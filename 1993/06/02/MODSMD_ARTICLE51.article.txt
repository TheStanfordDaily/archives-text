As my headlights bent into white lines late one
night, a song with a sweet melody and a slow
groove went head to head with some forget
table garage band on Live 105's "New Music Chal
lenge."
The singer half mumbled, half cooed the first
verse, as the lyrics, "when you were here before/
couldn't look you in the eye," caught my ear.
A guitar spat out through the amps as the voice de
clared, "I'm a creep/ I'm a weirdo/ what the hell am I
doing here?/1 don't belong here."
By the time the singer revealed, "I wanna have con
trol/ I want a perfect body/ I wanna perfect soul/ I
want you to notice when I'm not around," I already
had pulled onto the shoulder and was staring into the
empty road.
Maybe it was the frustration from a difficult day at
work; maybe it was the tug-of-love war with my then
significant other; heck, maybe it was that time of the
month. But whatever it was, I had been hit by the
sheer power of Radiohead's "Creep" and it put me on
a mission.
A mission from God.
How did this fivesome from England create a song
with self-loathing lyrics interrupted by a nervous gui
tar that so perfectly illustrates how insecurity can tip
your boat? And how could I marry one of them?
So begins the interview with Ed O'Brien, dubbed
"polite guitar" by the band's press release — as
opposed to guitarist Jonny Greenwood's "abu
sive guitar" and lead singer Thom Yorke's "inaudible
guitar."

Speaking via fiber optics from clear across the At
lantic, O'Brien challenges me to come up with a new
angle on the popular single off their somewhat-eclec
tic debut album, "Pablo Honey."
"['Creep'] is the blessing and the bane," he con
fides, laughing. "It's wonderful that the song has done
so well and touched so many people, but then that's all
that people (reporters) seem to be interested in."
Mired in an apparent lack of originality, I fumble
with my notepad hoping he says something inspiring
— or just tangential.
Fortunately, he saves me, mentioning that "Creep"
didn't receive much airplay in Britain because the dee
jays at Radio One — the country's only station —
"deemed it to be too miserable for the people of Eng
land."
Naturally, O'Brien has a beef with their simplistic
psychoanalysis of the millions of British listeners. He
shares his glee at the poetic justice of the single's suc
cess in the States, saying, "[Americans] want the grim
reality. [When you're feeling miserable], it's nice to
know that someone's down in the dumps as well."
Since Radio One monopolizes Britain's radio lis
tening market, O'Brien sees censorship over there as
"more underhanded."
"It's not like America, where you've got Tipper
Gore running around putting stickers on things," he
relates, describing Radio One's music collection as
one brimming with uplifting pop music and truly
golden oldies from the likes of Frank Sinatra and
Frankie Valli.
