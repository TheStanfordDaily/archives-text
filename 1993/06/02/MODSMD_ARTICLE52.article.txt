# the 						YEAR in REVIEW
## 
### Joel Stein 
You love this year in review crap for the same
reason you love your high-school yearbook:
you only let the cool people who like you write
in it. And maybe that kid with a bad complex
ion who had a crush on you for all four years.
Because, in the magical world of yearbooks, they can air
brush out acne.
But don't look here for any airbrushing. Herein lies the
seamy side of Stanford, the side that exists only in small frater
nity rooms with a little too much video equipment in them.
This was the year you got dumped. The year your par
ents told you they wouldn't pay for a degree in "Earth
Systems." The year of "Nudge, Nudge."

It was a year full of promise. A year when, in order to
evoke some of that reunification momentum, we appoint
ed a German leader. Then there were those ugly anti-
Turkish riots in Eastern Germany this summer. Build
your own analogy.
This isn't "It's a Wonderful Life," and I'm not the fat
angel guy. So put on your virtual-reality glasses and get
ready for the ride of your life.
Don't say I didn't warn you. And don't call me
Clarence.
• Band immerses itself in trouble: (before even the
eagerest of Branner kids arrived) Threatened by the content
of a terribly clever half-time show about Casper's, tee hee,
fake Mafia past (He's from the University of Chicago.
Chicago, get it?) "The Unauthorized Biography of Gerhard
Casper" is censored by the Athletic Department.
"It wasn't like we were going to call Casper an evil,
German totalitarian monster who responds to the slightest
bit of criticism with extreme censorship," said one band
member. "That would be wrong."
• Casper fires lots of veeps: (9 a.m., the first day of
school when administrators are just coming back to their
office after summer vacation) Hours after watching his first
episode of "The Jetsons" ("Gina, vat a hoot dat Spacely guy
iz!") Casper cleans house and eliminates six of the 10 vice
presidents. Most are given different positions, and the
University absorbs unforeseen "new business cards" costs.
"I have found that the give and take I like among
senior staff and officers occurs more easily when the group
is relatively small and consultations can be kept very infor
mal," said Casper in October, as a disgruntled history pro
fessor mumbled something about the Bay of Pigs invasion.
• Cal kids rob Enchanted Broccoli Forest: {on harvest
day, no less) "It seems odd to come all the way from
Berkeley just to steal a fire extinguisher and a vacuum
cleaner," said Police Captain Raoul Neimeyer. "The report
also listed blue devils, sense, nuggets and crank," he contin
ued, "But we're not quite sure what they mean."
• Casper Inaugurated: (A bright, bright sunshiny day)
Academicians get excited over breaking out their special
"graduation" outfits and hats in the fall. Many report see
ing Don Kennedy pocket the real president's hat and give
Casper Father Guido Sarducci's.
• Walsh defeats Notre Dame: (Ash Sunday) Through
brilliant strategizing, sheer will and the magic words "I
think Anderson Chevrolet would be very happy if everyone
won," Walsh prods the football team to a second victory
over the Fighting Irish.
• Dead, partially skinned opossum thrown into EBF:
(Sometime in October) Residents didn't notice the smell for
weeks, but once it was discovered, the ensuing discussion
over the best way to "compost" it took them late into the
night and a sixth container of EZ-Rider rolling paper.
• Andy Garcia mysteriously arrives at a
dance class: {a little later in October) Coffee

house heroine Edna sees Garcia smoking
a agar inside the Coho and tosses him
out Seriously. No joke.
• Stockdale goes nationals (When
was it?) In a scandal rivalled only by the j
1919 Black Sox, Admiral Stockdale was \
rumored to have been paid off by a
group known only as the "Supporters

of Dan Quayle." Nevertheless, the
acronym "BACK US" inspired

a generation to, uh, I for
B°'-

• Supermodel Lisa Huerta appears on "Studs":
("Cheerleader night." Seriously.) Under the strain of the
television lights, Huerta confesses to dating host Marc
DeCarlo: "The way he held his mike, I just had to expose
everything"
• University makes first attempt at kicking White
Plaza vendors out; (one long November afternoon) Failing
to recognize the hypnotic power of the vendors, University
officials went out to White Plaza to explain why the tax
laws required them to leave. After six hours and much frus
tration, University administrators had purchased six crys
tals, four statuettes, two tie-dyed sundresses and a T-shirt
with the chemical compound for alcohol. "I just wanted to
get the hell out of there," one official said. "I would have
bought anything."
• John-Edward cain 111 takes out huge, full-color Daily
ad to announce he is coming out of the closet:. Wouldn't
that be cool?
• Big Game: Stanford 41, Cal 21: (Nov. 22) We get The
Axe, but Cal physically pummels every Stanford student in
the stadium. In a reaction which can only mark the end of
Western Civilization, we think we got the better part of the
deal.
• Professor apologizes for racist remarks to a faculty
club waitress — I mean server (early Dec., right before
Santa starts checking his list twice) Although he apologizes
for telling an Asian-American student to "go bade to
China," nothing is ever resolved about the comment that
"she looked really good in the waitress outfit."
• J.J. Lasley appears nude in The Daily: (Nude 1, which
appeared to be a very cold day) Kicking off what turned into
a year of nudity, Lasley covered "sporto" with just a helmet.
Joke was, it wasn't his helmet.
• Blockbuster Bowl: Stanford 24, other team 3: (Jan. 1)
Not in the least embarrassed about playing in the blatantly
commercialized Blockbuster Bowl, Walsh tries to convince
Casper that "Hewlett-Packard University has a kind of ring
to it."
• Don Kennedy takes kids from his eco-quarter in
Washington program out and buys them drinks with din
ner: (winter quarter) Just one year after booting computer
science professor Stuart Reges for the same crime, the Don
does the equivalent of taking five bucks from pre-pubes
cents waiting in a car outside Ernie's.
• Pete Huyck shaves his butt in White Plaza: (Nude 2)
More than 500 people show up to watch a multicultural
argument turn into a lathery mess. After jumping during
the Band's version of "All Right Now" while a Bic rode
down his backside, Huyck limped away muttering, "That
was stupid. Really stupid."
• Carjacking at Med School: (Feb, right near that
Hallmark holiday) Mistaking Welsh Road for Route 27 in
Newark, N.J., two youths shot a man and stole his running
car.
"We just needed to make a SPOON run," one of them
said.
The act was immediately condemned by the high
er-ups at SPOON, who suspiciously added, "If we
get our ASSU special fee, we might be able to find
more acceptable means of'alternative transporta
tion.' "
• Naked guy pops up in Brannen (Nude
3)

Removing those unnecessary garments which separate our
odors from each other, Berkeley junior Andrew Martinez
tried to rally Brannerites around his cause celebre.
"Being naked is cool," he said. Almost 90 percent of
Branner immediately disrobed.
• Ice-T: (Whenever he said it was) Using the word
"motherfucker" more times than Freud thought it, Ice-T
did not respond kindly to a young woman in the audience
who insinuated that he spells his name wrong.
"I know that, stoopid," he said. "But it sounds that
way."
• Cheating scandal exposed: (right after that regretful
spring-break trip) An investigative study shows that stu
dents cheat during tests. Another shows that fraternity
punch contains alcohol and men stare at cleavage.
Freshmen are scared silly at the threat of having to
retake a final.
"That's totally unfair," one student said. "There's no
way they can expect us to remember information a month
later."
• Phi Delt house busted for stolen signs: (Judgement
Day) Posing for photos that would appear in the San Jose
Mercury News, one Phi Delt thought it would be cool to
stand on a bar in front of signs that said "Beaver Trap" and
"Large Peaks."
"We tried to put the signs back to where the boys told
us they got them," explained Police Captain Raoul
Neimeyer. "But one young woman slapped us. We're not
taking this lightly."
• Patricia Ireland and Phyllis Schlafly face off: (Hot
April night) After locking horns for more than an hour,
Ireland and Schafly combine forces to silence a group of fra
ternity members in the back row yelling "Catfight! Catfight!"
"We were just bummed, because we thought it was
Cathy Ireland," one guy said. "You can understand."
• Student arrested for stealing from Bookstore: (when
Scorpio in Pisces) After a long, complex and thorough
investigation, the suddenly holier-than-thou-when-it
comes-to-embezzling Bookstore finds matching ink stains
to determine a series of illegally obtained credit slips. The
"Lenin" and "Trotsky" signatures on the slips failed to tip
them off.

* Guy with a Polaroid camera
claiming he's from Playboy rents
hotel room and takes out an
ad in The Daily: (Nude 4)
Photographer David

Chan and his lovely
buxom assistant try to
coax nervous coeds
into taking off their
blouses for a "Girls of
thePac-10" issue.
Several models-in- j
waiting, pouting and i
cupping their breasts *
with their palms,
ask, "Shouldn't that
be womeriF

• Sharon Parker "resigns" from office of multicul
turalism: (Early, early April) Students meet in
White Plaza to rally against Casper for single
handedly killing multiculturalism. Six years of
playing that annoying "Crossing the Line"
game, in their opinion, had nothing to do
with it.
• Condoleezza Rice named new
provost: (It was this month, don't you
remember?) Besting George Bush, Casper
finds himself a conservative black woman.
Multicultural leaders fall into a War-
Games-like confusion and try to find the
etymological root to "Condi." No one asks
what a provost does.
• Outfield fly bounces off Jose Canseco's
head and into the stands for a home run (May
21) This has nothing to do with Stanford. I just
hate Jose Canseco.
• Nude Day (Nude 5, this Thursday, Lake
Lagunita, 2 to 5 p.m.) Ending a yearful of visible
pubic hair, Stanford students show up in record

numbers to see if blonde eyebrows really are "the way
to tell."
Organizer Steve "Zamfir" Matthews — one of
three, yes, three Taxis with four, yes, four nipples —
seems oddly nonplussed by the event.
"I'm not embarrassed about the extra nipples,"
Matthews said. "In fact, they can gauge water temperature
much more accurately than just two can."
There you have it — the ups, the down, the innies and
the outies. In a year that provided a full work-week of
nudity, more information about Malcolm X than anyone
needs and a couple new distribution requirements, it
may be best to stop making fun of Berkeley.
So, take from this year whatever wisdom you
can garner and leave the rest behind like that
bike you knocked over in front of History

Corner.
No, next year probably won't be any
better, or more rational, than this one.
But at least Northern Californians

will stop getting so excited about
rain. ■
