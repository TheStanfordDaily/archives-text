Sly can't hang on
to his career with
this failed attempt

Cliffhanger

Hang on! Sly's coming at you, trying to
reclaim his career after a slew of pathetic
flops like "Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot!"
and getting whipped at the box office by that
no-name Austrian bodybuilder. Returning
to his successful formula of muscles, ma
chine guns and melodrama, Stallone co
wrote this yawner of an action flick which
brings nothing to the genre other than nu
merous shots of people and objects falling
off picturesque mountains.
Sly plays Gabriel Walker (another tri
umphant Stallone stage name), a member of
the Rocky Mountain rescue squad who can
climb dangerous peaks wearing only a thin
T-shirt that showcases his rippling muscle
mass.
Suddenly, a call comes in: there's a strand
ed group, a family, that needs rescuing, and

The terrorists are also
incredibly sadistic, of course,
and this is supposed to make
the audience feel better when
Stallone uses them as
toboggans or impales them
on a handy stalactite.

the winds are too treacherous for the heli
copter. Gabe kicks into action. However, the
poor group isn't a family, but several terror
ists who crashed their plane after ripping off
three cases of money from the US Treasury
Department. The head villain, Qualen (John
Lithgow), is a meanie who forces Stallone to
track the cases, which are scattered over sev
eral miles of mountainous terrain.
Lithgow turns in a shocking perfor
mance, displaying an atrocious and inexplic
able British accent. He's a mean guy — he

shoots his girlfriend in the back and tosses
the body off a helicopter — but he's so fea
tureless his evil seems nonsensical and unin
timidating. The terrorists are also incredibly
sadistic, of course, and this is supposed to
make the audience feel better when Stallone
uses them as toboggans or impales them on
a handy stalactite.
Janine Turner falls from her state of grace
in "Northern Exposure," playing Jessie, a
member of the rescue squad and Gabe's for
mer girlfriend. Her function in "Cliffhang
er" is to act as all-purpose hostage and
punching bag for the bad old terrorists. In
between getting beaten up or taken hostage,
Ttorner hugs Gabe, tends to his wounds and
acts like they never really broke up. Giving a
surprisingly colorless performance, Turner
clearly decided a movie role was a fair trade
for her integrity.
Gabe Walker is Rambo on ice, though he
tries hard for that oft-desired quality of "vul
nerability." He drops a coworker's girlfriend
4,000 feet in the opening of the film, and this
tears him up inside. Will he be able to shake
off his funk and whip some butt? Will he be
able to pull off a similar rescue — one that's
bound to repeat itself — without screwing
up? Never fear, viewers, these questions are
predictably answered.
So, on a level judged purely for its action,
"Cliffhanger" compares favorably to similar
films, but those with low credulity scores
and little tolerance for hokey dialogue
("Qualen's a real psycho"; "Jesus Christ")
should prepare themselves. But if your mind
has been so harried with finals and other
cerebral pursuits, these left-brain qualities
may be stunned enough to cope with
"Cliffhanger." Those of you expecting an
other "Die Hard" or "Terminator" had best
stash your cash and wait for Arnold's next
movie.

Nintendo steps up
to the big screen
with veteran cast

Super Mario

Wait a minute ... just because a movie
is named after a Nintendo game doesn't
mean you should run away. Sure, "Super
Mario Bros." lacks the thematic insight
and characterization of Olivier's "Ham
let," but is packed with lavish effects and
surprising performances. If you're a sci-fi
addict who didn't know why people were
complaining about "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles" then "Super Mario Bros." is
for you.
Featuring an all-star cast, "Super Mario
Bros." stars veteran actor Bob Hoskins and
John Leguizamo, who recently wowed crit
ics and audiences with his one-man stage
show, "Spic-O-Rama." Playing Mario
Mario and Luigi Mario, respectively —
Brooklyn plumbers who can solve any pip
ing emergency — these two likable fellows
get sucked into an alternate universe pop
ulated by evolved dinosaurs and ruled by
an evil dictator played by (who else?) Den
nis Hopper.
Mario and Luigi have to stop Hopper
from bridging his sterile world with ours —
and only a princess thrown into our world
has the key. Armed only with their guts and
a sense of altruism, the two plumbers travel
through the alien world, where roasted di
nosaurs are sold on a stick and a giant fun
gus is taking over the planet.
Frenetically paced, "Super Mario Bros."
fleshes out the alternate world with daz
zling effects and design, as directors Rocky

Morton and Annabel Jankel pack in the
thrills and chills without violating its PG
rating.
Bob Hoskins, fresh from "Who Framed
Roger Rabbit?" carries his role with charm
and intelligence, and Leguizamo keeps an
easy ingenuousness throughout the film.
Hopper seems like he's still trying to get
over all the drugs he took in the '60s, but
few other actors look so reptilian without
makeup.
Samantha Mathis plays the princess who
possesses the key to Hopper's success, but
she's boring and spends most of the movie
waiting to be rescued by the pugnacious
Mario family. Fisher Stevens and Richard
Edison play a typical bumbling henchmen
pair, but the extremely unfunny twosome
don't bounce off each other at all.
Despite these flaws, and some lapses in
plotting, most of the film, to its credit, fo
cuses on the adventures of our plucky he
roes and their navigation through the di
nosaurs' world, a totalitarian place where
the policemen wear spiked jackets which
the plumbers initially mistake for Manhat
tan.
Finally, since the film never takes itself
seriously, it's hard to avoid the nuthouse
charm of "Super Mario Bros": when
Hoskins faces a dire plumbing problem, he
straps on his plumbing gear and says with
a perfect mix of grim seriousness and
irony: "We're going in." And in another
scene where the Marios must hijack a
'saurian police car, Luigi immediately
masters its electronic navigation system.
When asked how he did it so quickly, Luigi
says:"It comes from sitting on my butt
playing video games." Even if you can't re
member when you last held a joystick,
"Super Mario Bros." still offers a fun fanta
sy ride.
