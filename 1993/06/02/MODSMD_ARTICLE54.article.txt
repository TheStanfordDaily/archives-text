Ziggy breaks free
of daddy's legacy
with latest album

Ziggy Marley

Eh mon, if you buy just one album in
1993, this just might be it.
Ziggy Marley — son of reggae legend
Bob Marley — reunites with his band,
the Melody Makers, for an as-of-yet-un
titled release. Though occasionally
branching out to test more modern wa
ters, the album as a whole harkens back
to the Marley roots — no-nonsense reg
gae that doesn't try to hard to prove its
integrity.

Though occasionally
branching out to test
more modern waters,
the album as a whole
harkens back to the
Marley roots — no
nonsense reggae that
doesn't try to hard to
prove its integrity.

The first track on the album, "Joy and
Blues," intermingles a heavy bass and
steady rhythm with trademark off-har
mony rasta vocals. It sets the mood well
for the album, starting it off strong with a
deep-digging groove.
Other tracks on the album go further
than traditional reggae style, sounding
very much like Bob Marley's work. Per
haps the song most heavily influenced by
Marley and the Wailers is "World So Cor
rupt," a rhythmic tune that speaks a pow
erful message of harmony.
Although its black-and-white view
point provides an over-simplified solu

tion to the world's problems, the song still
hits home with lines like "lies they sell
cheaper than bread."
"Steel Pulse" provides another influ
ence for the album, with Ziggy's varia
tions on their stylized horns and rhythm
popping up on tracks like "Talk" and
"Rebel In Disguise." To his credit, Ziggy is
equally successful in this effort, as well as
in songs that sound more like his father's
past work.
But the most interesting turn on this
album is entirely Ziggy's own. "Head Top"
samples its background and accompanies
it with soulful vocals, marrying the mod
ern and the traditional. A definite dance
tune, this aggressive song becomes almost
confusing in its layered sampling of syn
thesizer, background vocal, reggae-ska
and percussion.
"Joy and Blues" is a reflective work that
brings new life to the reggae scene, reflect
ing insights as to where reggae came from
and where it's going. Twelve years after the
death of the Bob Marley, his son Ziggy has
made him proud.

Annoying, heavy
brilliant —the jacket
fits blowhard band

Staightjacket Fits

"Blow," the new album by the New
Zealand band Straitjacket Fits, is some

times brilliant and sometimes annoying,
filled with wandering, hypnotic guitar
play and unpolished vocals.
Some music just isn't meant to be in
stant. If you can handle that, perhaps you
should try these guys on for size.
I was halfway through "Cat Inna Can"
when the spacey, noodling guitars began
to ring and squirm, the drums grew heavy
and the whole thing — a quirky trifle
about a cat astronaut — started to darken.
Vocalist/guitarist/song writer Shayne
Carter strained his thin voice. And it was
tasty.
Straitjacket Fits graduated from the
college-rock school of nasal vocals, good
hooks and slippery guitar.
But they've staked their futures on their
guitar work. Most of the songs contain
dozens of precise embellishments that the
guitarists (no "rhythm guitarists" in this
band) are tirelessly adding. The sound is
diverse — sometimes squealing and shrill,
sometimes glassy and sweet — but never
absent.
To keep the suspense, Carter adeptly
changes the songs' dynamics to increase
the stakes in "Let It Blow" and the dri
ving "Done," before lowering them
again.
And in songs like the delicious
"Sycamore" and the crunchy "Turn,"
Carter, fellow guitarist Mark Petersen,
drummer John Collie and bassist
David Wood lash out something glori
ous.
On the down side, Carter's vocals grate
at first, especially early in the album with
"Falling" and "Joyride," two songs cursed
by repetitive one-word choruses.

But a hard listening will get you past
first impressions to the hidden treasures.
Like the (lamentably not printed) lyrics,
as in the odd interpersonal meditation in
"Spacing": "And I don't mind if I don't/do
what you do/the sensation about you
is/slower, lower/shall I model a spacing
about you?"
And the Beatle-esque chorus on "Cat
Inna Can" that, on close examination,
turns out to be composed of subtle falset
to meows.

Linda Rondstadt
is not necessary
on this new disc

Aaron Neville

Saying that you hit your peak during a
cheesy duet with the musical genius that is
Linda Rondstadt must make it hard to get
out of bed in the morning.
Aaron Neville's latest release, "The
Grand Tour," falls short in many ways —
it's a string of musical and lyrical cliches.
And although Neville has one of the more
distinctive and pleasant voices around
today, the music that backs him up on this
release just doesn't cut it.
Tracks like "Don't Take Away My Heav
en," "Betcha By Golly. Wow," and "Ain't
No Way" sound like most other short
lived top-40 love songs: soft, painless and
just too damn nice.
They lack the necessary emotion to
make the song worth listening to, wasting
Neville's considerable talent.
Worse yet is "The Bells," a track that's
ready-made for a K-Tel compilation
album, advertised by a turtleneck-wearing
couple sitting by a romantic fire sipping
on large glasses of red wine as song titles
scroll past them.
And if that visual image weren't painful
enough, Neville uses that silly "falling
star" sound effect — twice.
But the entire album isn't just love bal
lads of the "quietest of the quiet" kind;
Neville does experiment somewhat.
Two songs, "Don't Fall Apart On Me
Tonight" and the title track, actually dare
to go country, incorporating slide guitar
and the appropriate achy-breaky vocal
style. (Admittedly, any variety was a pleas
ant change to the other tepid songs on the
album).
The two best tracks on "The Grand
Tour" follow this trend of stylistic experi
mentation. "My Brother, My Brother" is a
terrific '70s-revival tune with twangy gui
tar to die for, and the appropriately long
sax solo.
But the finest piece on the album is also
the most out of place. Calling on true jazz
technique, "These Foolish Things," is
both classy and refreshing, successfully
incorporating a soft bluesy piano into its
big-band feel.
Aaron Neville's voice shines at the fore
front, where it belongs. Unfortunately,
you have to wade through so much easy
listening garbage to get there that it's
hardly worth the trip.
Buy the K-Tel record instead.
— Michael G. Nichols
