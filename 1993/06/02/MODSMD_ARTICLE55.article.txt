# Demo of the week
## 
### 
Some people think this controver
sial Stanford personality is a danger
ous radical and advocates racial ha
tred who plans to destroy the political
system. Others believe he voices the
frustrations of the forgotten people of
America. Who's right?
A listen to Kwame Yao Anku's
demo tape "A New Day" will help you
make up your mind. He uses another
medium, music, to promote his anti
establishment political message.
This talented musician wrote, com
posed and arranged the music and
lyrics, mixing his overtly political
messages with hype guitar licks.
The title track describes a day
when the people overthrow the es
tablishment, to create a nation that
strives for equality and justice. Pierc
ing guitars, supported by Anku's
powerful voice, make us feel like
we're at at a rally where he's the
main speaker.
"From the Other Side," a bluesy
cut backed by sweet-sounding gui
tars, wakes us up from the long slum
ber of satisfaction with our lives, to
question whether society really gives

everyone a chance to succeed. Even
as it inspires us to reflect on our own
hard times, the song reminds us that
many people are living the tragedy of
the inner-cities.
The rock track "Without A Name"
alternates between a slow, adult
contemporary feel to rapid guitar
licks supported by passionate vocals.
Anku conveys the sadness and
anger of a man who's been betrayed
by a close friend, driving home the
point that our actions have the poten
tial to destroy others' lives.
Finally, "Same Old Song" is a
keyboard dominated cut with soft
guitars which challenges us to un
derstand how society breeds a men
tality that helps us get through our
day — by turning a blind eye to the
plight of others we pass by on our
way home.
This release is definitely worth the
six bones, for its thoughtful political
message, complemented by above
average vocals and well-produced
music. Check it out at the Bookstore
— or buy it from Kwame himself.
