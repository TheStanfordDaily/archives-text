Dragon
Bruce Lee's life into a corny kung
fu movie wouldn't be a fitting tribute
to his accomplishments, yet that's
exactly what the filmmakers — with
Lee's wife as an advisor — have
done, in search of the almighty
ducat. Despite a generally convinc
ing performance by Jason Scott
Lee in the lead, this biopic is a big
budget backhand slap in the face
of Lee's legacy. PG-13
Hot Shots! Part Deux
Of all the movies in all the theaters
in all the world — don't walk into
"Hot Shots! Part Deux." Charlie
Sheen plays the nitwitted "Topper"
Harley, a Maverick/Rambo clone
trying to rescue U.S. hostages
from the evil Saddam Hussein.
More McDonald's than Rick's Cafe
Americain, writer-director Jim
Abrahams' frantic fast-food ap
proach to humor fails to satisfy ei
ther palate or appetite. PG-13
■ Menace II Society
John Singleton's boyz couldn't
hang in the Hughes brothers' 'hood
— they wouldn't last II minutes.
Caine Lawson, having just graduat
ed from high school, tries to survive
a long, hot summer on LA.'s mean
streets. But when a simple liquor

store run turns into a homicide, it
kicks off a series of events that can
only end in death or a disappearing
act. An impressive debut. R
■ Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you. Kenneth
Branagh whips out a Bardful of
tricks to bring this Shakespearian
comedy to the screen. Two sets of
couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and
fall in love in a picturesque 18th
century Italian villa. Though the
American actors (Keanu Reeves
and, surprisingly, Denzel Washing
ton) can't really hang, the largely
British cast pulls off a bawdily mag
ical comedy. PG-13
Sliver
Another trashy thriller from the mind
and the body that brought us
"Basic Instinct." Sharon Stone
plays a horny divorcee who moves
into a new apartment building,
where she meets two prospective
bedmates — one of whom is watch
ing her every move and masturba
tion through an elaborate network
of video cameras. Firm believers in
the theory that foreplay consists of
throwing the woman against a wall,
"Sliver" gets torn apart by its pseu
do-lurid excesses. R
