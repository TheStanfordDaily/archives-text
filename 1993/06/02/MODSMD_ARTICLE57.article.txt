For those of us who can take a moment to escape from our
research papers, here are some actors — Kevin Costner,
Mickey Rourke and Jodie Foster — playing characters
who can identify with our investigatory tribulations.
Oliver Stone shattered the cool facade of Dan Rather and
many other media pundits with JFK, his cinematic assault on
the Warren Commission report conclusion that Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy.
Kevin Costner plays dogged New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison,
the only person to bring someone to trial for the assassination.
Bland and colorless as usual, Costner turns in a competent per
formance that doesn't get in the way of Stone's directoral py
rotechnics.
Unofficially known as the Sleaziest Man Alive, Mickey
Rourke starred in Angel Heart, Alan Parker's luridly imagi
native spin on the Oedipus story of a man looking for someone
who turns out to be himself. Rourke punches, shoots and oozes
his way through the film at the bidding of the mysterious Mr.
Louis Cyphre — until he meets former Rolling Stone cover girl
Lisa Bonet, who's more than happy to do the nasty with ever
nasty Mickey in the Louisiana bayous. The basic concept has a
certain appeal, but Parker's oppressively Gothic atmospherics
and Mickey's reptilian charm make us want to take a shower.
The most talented actor of the lot, Jodie Foster tops her per
formance in"The Accused" in Jonathan Demme's Academy
Award-winning The Silence of the Lambs. She battles
gender and class prejudices as she struggles to solve a baffling
series of murders by a man who skins his victims. ■
