# A 						'very traditional' outdoor wedding — with two brides
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Dr. Kate O'Hanlan's lighthearted,
spiritual wedding didn't look that
different from most others. Filled
with hugs, tears and laughter, the outdoor
ceremony featured stirring readings, inspi
rational prayers and symbolic gifts of affec
tion.
But, at this particular joyous event, a model

of two brides adorned the wedding cake.
O'Hanlan and her partner L£onie Walk
er — like many other gay and lesbian cou
ples — sought to confirm their love publicly,
to proclaim to the world that their bond is
just as legitimate as one between a husband
and wife.
The American legal system doesn't yet
recognize the vows they made that day. But
as a landmark case concerning the legality
of a lesbian marriage picks up steam in the

Hawaiian courts, longstanding legal and
economic barriers may soon collapse, grant
ing practical weight to their emotional com
mitment.
O'Hanlan and Walker met in 1986,
and in November of that year spon
taneously committed to each other
"always and forever."
On their first anniversary, they signed a
mutual power of attorney and a health con

servatorship. On their second anniversary
they exchanged rings they had designed,
and by the third they decided to get married
exactly two years later.
Walker, 35, says their wedding was "very
traditional — only that we were two
women. It was a regular ceremony, with
vows, a ring exchange, music, then a won
derful reception."
"It was easily the happiest day of my
life," says 39-year-old O'Hanlan,
an assistant professor of gynecol
ogy and obstetrics. "We'd been
planning it for six months. It was
incredibly exhilarating."
At the Crocker Mansion in
Hillsborough, 160 guests —
including many Stanford faculty
— gathered to see the two walk
down the aisle in their white
pantsuits.
O'Hanlan fondly recalls when
her father "stood up and said, 'Liz
and I have been married for 42
happy years now, and we just
want Kate and Leonie to have all
the happiness that we have.' And
everyone gave a great cheer."
She points out that their
guests — divided evenly between
gays and heterosexuals — were
"not simply accepting us, but cele
brating UB."
The Rev. Maxine Kaye, minis
ter of the metaphysical Los Altos-
Mountain View Church of Reli
gious Science, officiated the cere
mony. Friends read four passages,
including "On Love" from Kahlil
Gibran's "The Prophet" and the
minister's interpretation of the
well-known Biblical passage
"Love is patient, love is kind."
Kaye asked the couple, "Do you
take this woman whose hands you
hold, choosing her alone from all
the world to be your partner in
life, will you love her, honor her,
comfort and cherish her, and for
saking all others, remain faithful
to her alone?"
With wide smiles and a hint of
tears, they said to each other, "I
take you to be my wedded part

ner, to grow and experience
together the trials and ecstasies of
life, to make it as meaningful as I
can for you and for myself, and
thereto I pledge you my love."
The wedding, O'Hanlan says,
"formalized the concept of us as a
married couple. We are not
'lovers.' We are spouses."
"Life partners," Walker adds
lovingly.
The Rev. Herb Schmidt, pas
tor of the University
Lutheran Church, has con
ducted three ceremonies uniting
gay couples. "I do not call it a mar
riage," he says."I call it a ceremo
ny of holy union. It's a celebration

of their friendship, their love and
their commitment to each other. I
think that's a serious step for any
couple."
Raised as a conservative
Lutheran, he says he was taught
that homosexuality was theologi
cally wrong and a psychological
aberration. "I've had to go
through a tremendous 180-
degree change in attitude," he
says. "That happened to me
when I was in dialogue with gays
and lesbians, feeling the pain
they've gone through to be who
they are.
"I'm just acting on the basis of
what we say — 'God loves all peo
ple.' To say God loves gays and

lesbians and then suggest they
must live a life of celibacy is to
deny a part of who they are."
Three years ago, two gay staff
members approached him and
asked that he unite them. He
went to the 15-member church
council and received their unani
mous approval to conduct the cer
emony. The couple decided to
modify the traditional heterosex
ual ceremony, changing such
phrases as "husband and wife" to
"partners for life."
"I think that the religious com
munities in this country and all
over the world have failed their
responsibilities to gay and lesbian
people," Schmidt says. "Any life
time commitment needs commu
nity support and caring."
In 1990, Mark Showalter, a
member of Schmidt's congre
gation, told the pastor he
wanted to celebrate his relation
ship with his partner before the
community and receive its bless
ing and support.
Showalter, a research associate
in the Electrical Engineering
Department and an astronomer
at NASA's Ames Research Cen
ter, had dated Frank Yellin for
two and a half years before they
decided to go through the ceremo
ny. "We were ready to make it
public and celebrate it,"says
Showalter, 35.
"It was amusing to go to the
jeweler and here are two men try
ing on wedding rings. It took
them a little time to figure it out,"
he says."And the florist was com
pletely baffled."
According to 34-year-old
Yellin, the florist said, "Well, you
do need a bridal bouquet, don't
you?"

The couple replied, "No, don't
worry about that."
Showalter says that although
the management of Hobee's, their
caterer, was aware of the nature
of their union, the people who
worked that day didn't know until

The wedding formal
ized the concept of us
as a married couple.
We are not "lovers."
We are spouses.'

they arrived. "This was the gossip
going around Hobee's for the next
week — the story of the holy
union," he laughs.
Many of the people they invited
came. But Yellin's brother "gave
an excuse of an ear problem, and
my parents pretended like [the
ceremony] didn't exist," says
Yellin, who received a master's in
computer science from Stanford.
"My father was a stubborn man.
He didn't want Mark to be part of
the family."
"They specifically asked not to
be invited," Showalter says, "but
we sent them an invitation any
way."
Yellin's father has passed
away, but his mother "has come a
long way since then."
During the ceremony, Schmidt
told the couple, "Your union is
not a legally or socially legislated
business arrangement; it is a
covenant that you have chosen to
make, and a celebration of the
mystery and wonder that love
brings to living."

doesn't yet recognize their vows as legitimate.
