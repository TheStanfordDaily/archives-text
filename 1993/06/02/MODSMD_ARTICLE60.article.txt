This clear craze has gone too far.
First it was clear dishwashing liquid. Then
clear roll-on deodorant. Even clear cola
reared its ugly head. Still, we forgave those
see-through sinners, for they knew not what
they did.
But clear malt liquor?
Let's think about its implications. Imagine a
commercial featuring rapper Ice Cube, backed

by a übiquitously insistent "Atomic Dog" sam
ple. After cursing out The Man, the cops and
the hoes he knows, he feels like a little some
thing that'll "get his girl in the mood quicker."
So Cube picks up a brown paper bag at his
feet, reaches inside, grasps firmly, and whips
out a 40-ounce bottle of ... crystal-clear
Zima, as his boyz watch him with pained ex
pressions on their faces.
Can we all say, "Punks Jump Up To Get
Beat Down?"
Like exchanging Norm's beer with a mug of

Evian, Zima is sacrilegious. Arid the light,
fruity flavor isn't a plus. People who drink malt
liquor want that cold-brewed, heat-pasteur
ized, fresh-from-the-urinal taste. It's the price
they willingly pay for that smooth, deep cool.
Zo don't let me catch any of you playing
"Pass the Zima" — or I'll have to zlap you
zilly.
