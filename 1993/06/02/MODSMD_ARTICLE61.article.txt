■ Sky fits heaven
Are you a senior? Have you taken a cre
ative writing course at Stanford? Do you
think you're sexy enough for a pretentious
black-and-white Gap commercial?
If so, you'd probably be interested in the
open mike reading of fiction and poetry that
will be taking place next Wednesday June 9 in
Building 50, Rm. 51R. Each person will sign
up for five minutes upon arrival to share
their insights and epiphanies with family,
friends and even foes.
Admittedly, it's 10 minutes short of the 15
minutes of fame we've been promised, but
why use it all up now? Call 723-2637 for
more information.
■ Lil'button o'pleasure
If you were Jesse Helms or Phyllis Schlafly,
and you wanted an evening of good family en
tertainment, where would you go? Josie's. Not.
Lesbian performance artist Holly Hughes,
one of the notorious NEA 4, returns to Josie's
Cabaret & Juice Joint in "Clit Notes." The one
woman show, previously tided "Snatches" and
"Sins of Omission," is the second step in her 10-
point agenda to promote lesbianism interna
tionally through song, dance and monologue.
The show is part of Lesbian/Gay Pride
Month, which will feature comics Karen Rip
ley and Carol Steinel, as well as musician
Robert Ostertag. For further information,
call 861-7933.
