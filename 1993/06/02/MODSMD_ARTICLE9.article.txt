# Rough waters ahead
## New senate chair set to steer a straight course 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Using the extensive business
experience he gained in starting
his own computer consulting
company, newly elected ASSU
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf hopes
to revitalize student government
by unifying the senate and
improving communication.
But the Business School stu
dent admits that the senate
chair's job may be more difficult
than in the past — even though
this year he will be working with
an active Council of Presidents —
because of the need to overcome
two problems that have plagued
the ASSU this year: apathy and
divisiveness.
"It is currently intolerable, in
my mind, that the [previous] sen
ate was unable to initiate and
manage programs that affect
thousands of students," said Wal
dorf, who founded his consulting
company in 1984 and now has 100
clients from Honolulu to New
York.
He cited both the failure to
secure summer storage for stu
dents and the collapse of Beat the
Bookstore business project as
examples of ASSU mismanage

ment.
Responding to the mtyor issue
that plagued last year's senate —
the split between undergraduate
and graduate senators — Waldorf
said he has devised ways to unify
the senate.
"Even the physical layout of
the meetings is polarizing," he
said, adding that he has several
suggestions for a new seating
arrangement. Traditionally,
graduate and undergraduate sen
ators sit on opposite sides of the
room.
Waldorf said he also paid spe
cial attention when making com
mittee assignments to preserving
a balance between graduate and
undergraduate students.
"The difference between being
an undergraduate and a graduate
shouldn't affect many issues any
more than the difference between
seniors and freshmen should
affect them," he added.
Despite a desire to unify the
senate, Waldorf said he will try to
be a voice for graduate students
on the ASSU executive committee
— a body composed of the COP
and the senate chair, among oth
ers.
"As the only graduate student
on the committee, I have an added

responsibility to bring that per
spective," he said.
However, he added, "Every
senator and member of the COP
is obliged to do that which bene
fits every student regardless of
their undergraduate/graduate
standing."
And Waldorf — who narrowly
defeated undergraduate senator
Mork Murdock at last week's sen
ate meeting for the chair position
— said he will try to do the same.
"I will do my best to bring
attention to the issues which
affect the most students," he said,
adding that he will try to be as
impartial as possible in the
upcoming year.
"Every senator should feel that
I am there to help make their leg
islation get the consideration of
the senate," he said.
Although the senate chair
worked without a COP this year,
Waldorf said he is ready to work
with the new COP to further the
representation of all students,
including graduates. "The notion
that the COP need not pay atten
tion to graduate issues is incor
rect and counterproductive," he
said.
"I am hopeful that the present
COP . . . will use their office to

diminish the amount of misinfor
mation that exists among stu
dents and administrators," he
said.
As senate chair, Waldorf will
act as one of the liaisons between

students, the ASSU and Universi
ty administrators.
Waldorf said he does not feel
that his election by only a 12-8
margin will weaken his authority
in the senate.

In fact, Waldorf said he is will
ing to allow the senators to judge
his success. "If they feel that I am
not performing my duties ade
quately, then they can remove me
from the position," he said.
