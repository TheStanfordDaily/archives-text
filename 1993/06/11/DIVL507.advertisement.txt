Interview Tips

First impressions
are lasting ones.
Here are some
basic tips we
think are
essential when
dressing for an
interview.
Conservative
styling is best.
» your suit should he
single breasted in
solid dark colors —
navy, grey or navy
or grey pinstripe.
► Your dress shirt
should he white
with long sleeves,
button-down,
straight or tab collar.
» l ies should be con
servative. Choose a
basic regimental
stripe, micro-neat or
foulard print in bur
gundy or red shades.
Shoes should be
black or cordovan —
pull-on or wing tip.
Make sure your
interview outfit is
clean and well pressed
to give a well polished
business look.
Be prepared with
two or three outfits
for those important
"call-back" interviews.
