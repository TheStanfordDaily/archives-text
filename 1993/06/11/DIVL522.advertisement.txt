SUMMARY OF OPEN RESPONSES
The largest number of written comments was received in response to Survey Item 32: "Please include any
additional comments you may have regarding Stanford's 'Free Expression and Discriminatory Harassment' policy,
including any reasons you may have for supporting or not supporting the policy." The maior response categories in
Survey Item 32 are:
1. Policy has had no effect on discourse at Stanford (n - 38, 12%)
2. Little awareness or knowledge of the policy among Stanford students (rt » 36, 11 %)
3. Policy has had little effect compared to the "politically correct" social climate at
Stanford (n » 28, 9%)
4. Policy stifles speech (n - 26, 8%)
5. Policy is an infringement on first amendment rights (n * 23, 7%)
8. Policy has a positive effect on campus (n = 20, 6%)
Additional responses were distributed across a number of low-response categories.
Responses to key survey items and open-response items suggest that many survey respondents support the
policy and few survey respondents believe that the policy has affected their undergraduate experience at Stanford.
Many respondents, however, believe that the university has placed too much emphasis on multicultural and diversity
programming.
