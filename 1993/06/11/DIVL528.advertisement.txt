1993 Senior Pledge
Your senior pledge illustrates one of Stanford's greatest
assets: the loyal generosity of its alumni. I thank you and
applaud your commitment to strengthen the university
for tomorrow's students.
â€” Gerhard Casper
President
CONGRATULATIONS on your graduation! and THANK YOU for making your first post
graduate commitment to Stanford. Your senior pledge is your expression of belief in Stanford.
Far more than the actual dollars raised, your support is vital to the health and growth of the
university. Thank you!
