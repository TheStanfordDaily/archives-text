The de Guerre pools will be closed starting Monday, July 26 through and including Sunday, August 29.
The pool is scheduled to reopen on Monday, August 30 and continue on through September with its regular
schedule. Any changes to this plan will be posted at de Guerre and Roble pools.
During the 5 week closure period, the pools will have major repairs and renovations done. Roble pool
will be open to handle some of the demand created by the closure at de Guerre. The size and schedule at Roble
pool cannot handle all of this demand. Recreational swimmers and families should identify other options to
satisfy swimming needs during this period. Due to the size and demand expected on the Roble pool, the
Athletic Department will need to continue with its policy of prohibiting its use by children. NO CHILDREN
UNDER THE AGE OF 17 WILL BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROBLE POOL FACILITY. Please make
arrangements to have children that need supervision to receive it outside of the Roble pool fence. Your
understanding and cooperation with this policy will enhance the enjoyment of those who are valid card holders.
Please make sure you understand the availability to the pools before you purchase swim cards.
