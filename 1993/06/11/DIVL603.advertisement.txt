Kocky,
When you were little you were The Great Scott
Magician. By then nobody could tell a riddle or play
checkers like you. At 4 you could host any game show on
T.V. and later you possessed the fastest Soap Box Car.
You've always played full throttle and expected to win. In
the future, we're confident you will succeed.
So Scott/, always dream big and may your game of LIFE
be filled with wonderful memories. Our love and finest
"pinches" go with you.
Love, Aunt Jeanie & Nana
