# Alumni club network to be replaced by Stanford base
## Groups express anger, frustration over restructuring

Breaking with tradition, the Stanford Alumni
Association has decided to scrap its network of local
clubs and adopt a regional outreach program in its
place. But while association administrators say the
change will allow outreach to more alumni, many
groups are angry and confused about the changes,
which will take effect June 30.
The decision to restructure the program was
based on a national survey conducted last year by
the association, according to Alumni Association
President Bill Stone. The survey asked faculty mem
bers, presidents of alumni clubs and alumni "what
was working and what was not," Stone said. While
93 percent of the alumni said that they would be
interested in participating in Stanford activities, 85
percent of them had never attended a club meeting.
In addition to the survey, 75 Stanford faculty
members were sent to different Stanford clubs in
the Bay Area to evaluate their activities. According
to Stone, an average of 57 people came to a club

event."In light of the responses, that was strange,"
he said.
Another finding was that club membership levels
were static, despite the association's increased
financial support of the clubs.
"Investment has increased by 40 percent, but the
number joining is flat or declining a bit," Stone said.
As a result of these findings, the association's
board of directors decided to direct its resources
toward reaching alumni directly, instead of invest
ing in clubs. Club dues will be either eliminated or
reduced and the association will organize and par

Louise Rosenberg, a representative of San Fran

"shocked to find out that the decision had been
made so quickly." Her club â€” one of the oldest
