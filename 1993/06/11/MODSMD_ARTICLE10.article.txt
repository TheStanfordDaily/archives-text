# Alumni club network to be replaced by Stanford base
## Groups express anger, frustration over restructuring 
### Lubna Qureishi 
Breaking with tradition, the Stanford Alumni
Association has decided to scrap its network of local
clubs and adopt a regional outreach program in its
place. But while association administrators say the
change will allow outreach to more alumni, many
groups are angry and confused about the changes,
which will take effect June 30.
The decision to restructure the program was
based on a national survey conducted last year by
the association, according to Alumni Association
President Bill Stone. The survey asked faculty mem
bers, presidents of alumni clubs and alumni "what
was working and what was not," Stone said. While
93 percent of the alumni said that they would be
interested in participating in Stanford activities, 85
percent of them had never attended a club meeting.
In addition to the survey, 75 Stanford faculty
members were sent to different Stanford clubs in
the Bay Area to evaluate their activities. According
to Stone, an average of 57 people came to a club

event."In light of the responses, that was strange,"
he said.
Another finding was that club membership levels
were static, despite the association's increased
financial support of the clubs.
"Investment has increased by 40 percent, but the
number joining is flat or declining a bit," Stone said.
As a result of these findings, the association's
board of directors decided to direct its resources
toward reaching alumni directly, instead of invest
ing in clubs. Club dues will be either eliminated or
reduced and the association will organize and par
tially sponsor club events from Stanford.
But while the changes might allow for the partic
ipation of more alumni, strong local clubs feel aban
doned by the change.
Louise Rosenberg, a representative of San Fran
cisco Women, a local Stanford club, said she was
"shocked to find out that the decision had been
made so quickly." Her club — one of the oldest
alumni groups — has "a nice com
munity following" and has
already elected officers and board
members for the year, she said.
Rosenberg said she "had an
inkling" changes were taking
place when the yearly meeting of
representatives from clubs around
the world was postponed. But she
wants to "keep an open mind"
about the changes, she said.
Mark Lester, president of the
Los Angeles County club, said
that "in the short run, [the new
program | will wipe us out."
But Lester concedes that the
new program may eventually
boost attendance at event.
Although membership in his club
ranges from 200 to 900 people,
regular participation is meager.
"It's very difficult to get people
to come to events — only 55 to 60
people show up," Lester said. His
club had to cancel a recent health
care symposium because only 50
members registered.
Under the new system, the

association will organize events
and try to bring together different
types of Stanford alumni. For
example, if the Graduate School
of Business hosted an event in
San Francisco, all local alumni —
not just the MBAs — would be
invited to attend.
In addition, several clubs may
help organize one large event,
rather than host individual events.
"We have to somehow make
known the range and breadth of
clubs," Stone said. "The goal is to
double the alums regionally by
marshaling [our] resources with
other Stanford agencies."
The association also hopes to
undertake new projects, such as
working with other schools to
organize job fairs, and maintain
old traditions, such as freshman
outreach programs and Big Game
festivities.
Reaction to the restructuring
has been mixed, according to
Stone.
"Some (clubs) were annoyed
that we're having to look at
costs," he said. But Stone said
he'll "plead guilty" to having to
think about resources in light of
the current economic situation.

Marilyn Rees, a representative
of East Bay Women, another alum
ni club, said that "what happened
is confusing to us" and she is "not
sure how it will affect the club."
Steven Levitt, co-chairperson
of membership and events at the
New York and New Jersey club,
sees the move as "positive if they
follow through with it." Levitt
thinks that Stanford should place
more importance on identifying
and reaching alumni living on the
East Coast.
"New York is a hard place to
move to," he said. "It's crowded,
expensive, it's hard to find hous
ing. Our goal is to serve as many
people as possible, not just orga
nize $50 dinners."
Levitt's club has been trying to
institute programs such as an
alumni mentor program that
would put recent graduates in
touch with alumni established in
each graduate's field.
Stone hopes the new system
will facilitate such programs.
"The alumni can concentrate on
the activity and the educational
part of it," Stone said. "We'll cen
tralize our resources so they'll
reach a broader audience."
