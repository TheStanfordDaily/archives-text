sentenced to a six-month proba
tion period and 70 hours of com
munity service for his role in the
May 15, 1989 takeover of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
office.
Jackson's sentencing ended a
five-and-a-half month legal battle
during which the Black Student

pus rallied behind Jackson, claim
ing he had been unfairly singled
out for prosecution by the district
attorney.
DECEMBER
•A top adviser to Mexican
President Carlos Salinas falsely
claimed to have received a doc
torate in economics from Stan
ford.
•Senior Geoff Engman and his
roommate Seth Schneider

duced, prompting the reissue of
winter-quarter ID cards on spe
cially marked paper.
JANUARY
•Bob Beyers, director of Stan
ford News Service for 28 years,
announced his resignation.
Beyers cited increasing pres
sure from University administra
tion to make the News Service
conform to a "public-relations"
style.

second year in a row, the Univer
sity announced a massive $22
million cut in its operating bud
get.
MARCH

after a year of negotiations, Webb
Ranch and the United Stanford
Workers signed a five-year con

sions to Stanford's alcohol policy.

ASSU elections prompted more

People's Platform Council of

Presidents slate. Among the vic
torious candidates was cartoon
character Bart Simpson.
• Expressing his vision for
Stanford's second century, Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy called for a rededication
of faculty to teaching over
research to a packed crowd at
Kresge Auditorium.
"It is time for us to reaffirm
that education — that is, teaching
in all its forms — is the primary
task and that our society will
jedge us in the long run on how
well we do it," Kennedy said. The
speech marked a decided shift in
the University's lack of emphasis
on teaching.

Conduct Legislative Council
