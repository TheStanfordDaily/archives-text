SEPTEMBER
•Two federal agents began an
investigation to determine if
Stanford was overbilling the gov
ernment for overhead costs of
federally sponsored research.
"I do not expect a discovery of
any wrongdoing on our part,"
University President Donald
Kennedy told The Daily.
OCTOBER
•In response to the govern
ment's recently passed Drug-
Free Schools and Communities
Act, the University announced a
new alcohol and drug policy
explicitly prohibiting the unlaw
ful use of alcohol and drugs on
campus by students, faculty and
staff.
•Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing privileges
to gay and lesbian students, as
well as to committed partners of
heterosexual students.
NOVEMBER
•A divided Faculty Senate
voted to revamp the distribution
requirements that undergradu
ates must complete to graduate,
placing a greater emphasis on the

study of race, religion and gen
der.
DECEMBER
•The Interfraternity Council
voted overwhelmingly to require
all campus fraternities to hold an
alcohol-free Rush spring quarter,
a move that the IFC president
described as a "major policy
change." The switch to a dry
Rush was intended to "send a
strong message" that the IFC is
committed to "self-regulation,"
he said.
JANUARY
•After seven years as dean of
undergraduate admissions, Jean
Fetter, better known to students
as "Dean Jean," announced her
resignation from the influential
post. Her announcement came as
a surprise to the campus and
even to her colleagues in the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions.
•Students reacted with both
passion and inattention to the
news that the United States had
declared war in the Persian
Gulf.
Hundreds of students took
part in a teach-in, dozens of dor

mitories held programs on the
conflict and several "die-ins"
garnered attention in White
Plaza.
• Despite a nationwide reces
sion and War in the Persian Gulf,
Stanford's Centennial Campaign
broke the $1 billion mark. By the
end of the campain in October,
Stanford had raised $1.1 billion in
the most ambitious fund-raising
drive ever conducted by a Univer
sity.
FEBRUARY
•The Sexual Assault Task
Force released its long-awaited
report, recommending direct
action by of the University to
combat rape and other sexual
crimes on campus.
Among the recommendations
were a call for a coordinator of
sexual assault response services
and a less-stringent standard of
proof for Fundamental Standard
cases.
MARCH
•University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beat
ing before the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. The event marked
the climax of the media hoopla
that had surrounded the contro
versy over how Stanford charges
the government for the indirect
costs of federally sponsored pro
jects.
•University President Donald
Kennedy announced $7 million in
new programs to improve under
graduate teaching at Stanford.
The package of initiatives includ
ed funds for developing new
courses and cash bonuses for out
standing teachers, and followed
up on Kennedy's landmark April
speech in which he called for a
greater emphasis on teaching.
APRIL
•The Office of Naval Research
delivered punishing blows to the
University, terminating close to
100 accounting agreements and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost
rate from 78 percent to 55.5 per
cent. The actions were taken by
the Navy after its negotiations
with the University broke down
without a settlement.
•The new Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital was
dedicated in a ceremony featuring

first lady Barbara Bush, Gov.
Pete Wilson and a crowd of more
than 20,000.
The hospital began receiving
patients in June, three years and
$100 million after construction
began.
MAY
•Due to the Navy's decison to
slash Stanford's indirect-cost

rate, Provost James Rosse said
the University will face "a daunt
ing financial challenge."
Projected budget shortfalls of
$20 million in the 1991-92 aca
demic year and $30 million the
following year forced the Univer
sity to take several painful steps,
including a near freeze in faculty
hiring, a six-month postpone
ment of annual faculty and staff
salary increases and sharp limits
on library purchases.
•The Students First slate
defeated the People's Platform
slate in the Council of Presi
dents race. Like past elections,
this one became embroiled in
controversy when MEChA, after
being defeated in the general
election, convinced the ASSU
Senate to place it on the runoff
ballot.
•Stuart Reges, a computer
science lecturer, was fired for
carrying illegal drugs on cam
pus and buying alcoholic bever
ages for under-age students.
Reges had written a letter to
national drug czar Bob Mar
tinez admitting he carried and
used drugs to protest U.S. drug
policy. The controversy sur

rounding the case was covered
by the national media and
raised questions on campus
regarding free speech.
•Stanford's overseas program
in Santiago, Chile was closed
because of funding problems. The
shut-down of the two-year pilot
program met with anger from stu
dents and faculty.
•Dr. Francis Conley, a promi
npnt npiirnsiircrurm nt the SfVinrJ

nent neurosurgeo
of Medicine
resigned, charg
ing "pervasive
sexism througout
the entire envi
ronment (of the
school)." Conley,
who first came to
Stanford 25
years prior as an
intern, officially

ii) uuiv/iaiij WWIIIVJ
announced her resignation May
23.
"I resigned because the behav
ior of a person promoted to chair
man of my department has char
acteristics rooted 25 years ago,"
Conley said. "He devalues women
and, for that matter, anyone
whom he perceives to be inferi
or."
