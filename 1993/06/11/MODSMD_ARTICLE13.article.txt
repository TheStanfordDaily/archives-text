academic freedom."

released at the beginning of the
month announcing reduction tar
gets for the University schools

found a bottle of pills near Lich
stein, who left a suicide note.
DECEMBER

community centers expressed
concern over the effect of budget

it more difficult to accommodate
Stanford's growing minority pop
ulation.
JANUARY
• Law student Keith Rabois
directed anti-gay remarks toward
the cottage of Otero Resident Fel
low Dennis Matthies.
The Stanford community
responded — mostly through
fliers, posters and letters to The

two years' probation, 100 hours of
community service and a $1,000
fine in Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court.

at the University of Chicago, was
appointed Stanford's ninth presi

highly secretive, six-month
search and selection process that
produced 667 nominees and was

deadline.
Casper, a German immigrant
who became a national authority
on Constitutional law, came as an
outsider to Stanford, having
served the last 25 years of his aca
demic career at Chicago.
APRIL
• The ASSU spring election
came to an unexpected end as the
student body elected a group of
four students promising to dis

Not to Have a COP" slate beat out
the Students First, "Indepen
dents: A New Era," and the Cha
parral's "You!" slates to win the
COP election with 51 percent of
the vote.
After the election, the ASSU
Senate passed a budget that
removed all money from the
COP's budget.
Outgoing-COP member John
Overdeck said the money was
taken away to ensure the Prefer
slate did not assume office and
collect salaries without doing any
work.
• While angry citizens rioted
in Los Angeles and San Francis
co over the acquittal of four
white police officers involved in
the Rodney King beating, Stan
ford reacted quickly and peace
fully with a midnight march to
the Palo Alto police station.
In the days that followed, stu
dents on campus wore black to
"mourn the death of justice in
the country," according to Uja
maa Resident Assistant Bacardi
Jackson.
Student groups worked with in
coalition and on their own to plan
other events protesting the ver
dict.

more than 1,500 people to listen
to speeches and songs by ethnic
community leaders.
The rally culminated in anoth
er march to the Palo Alto police

station, where the crowd blocked
traffic for more than an hour.
MAY
• Although his first visit was
a bigger event, former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's
second visit to Stanford was
eagerly anticipated by the com
munity and marked by an unex
pectedly high demand for speech
tickets.
In addition to speaking on
"The Rule of Law," the former
president, and his wife, Raisa,
toured the Hoover Institution and
viewed an exhibit of Russian rev
olutionary artifacts called "A Cen
tury of Revolutions: Lenin to Gor
bachev."
The couple had missed the
exhibit on their first visit to Stan

ford in 1990.
