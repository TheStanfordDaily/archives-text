# Class gift to help Financial Aids
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
The senior class will donate an unde
termined amount of money to the
Financial Aids Office as this year's
class gift. The final amount of the gift
will depend on revenues from Satur
day's Class Day luncheon and Night
Before party.
"We knew we wanted to give some
thing that would really affect the Uni
versity â€” something that the majority
of students could benefit from," said
Rosa Maria Villagomez, one of four
senior class presidents.
Before selecting the gift, the presi
dents investigated various departments
and programs that have been affected
by budget cuts. The Financial Aids
Office is an ideal recipient, Villagomez

said, because it benefits students in all
departments.
"The majority of this campus is on
financial aid, and the Financial Aids
Office is definitely hurting from budget
cuts," she said.
The class presidents also selected
items for the class time capsule, after
soliciting ideas from fellow seniors.
"Everything that people suggested
went in," Villagomez said.
A Talisman CD represents the
seniors' freshman year, when the a
cappella group was formed, while an
issue of The G-Spot, a recently-estab
lished gender issues quarterly, symbol
izes their final year at Stanford.
The political scene "on campus and
elsewhere" is reflected by two stickers
reading "Keep Abortion Legal" and
"Clinton/Gore," she said.

A length of yellow construction rib
bon reading "CAUTION" symbolizes
the numerous construction projects
that have been completed on campus
over the past four years.
A newspaper article on raves was
included because the parties are "a
new form of entertainment, picking up
where the '60s left off," Villagomez
said.
Taco Bell memorabilia immortalizes
"a very popular senior hangout," while
modern music is represented by a tech
no-compilation CD titled "Electronic."
"Basically, we just wanted a CD in
there, and that's the only one that no
one wanted," Villagomez said.
The time capsule will be installed
in the Inner Quad on Saturday imme
diately following the Baccalaureate
service.
