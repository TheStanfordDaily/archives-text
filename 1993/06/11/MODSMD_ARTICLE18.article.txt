# COMMENCEMENT 1993
## The 						Resurrection of Memorial Church 
### Juthymas Harntha 
This weekend marks the
first time Commencement
events have taken place in
Memorial Church since it suf
fered severe damage the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake.
Ten million dollars and three
years of repairs and upgrades
have improved the lighting,
sound and general appearance of
the church, in addition to repair
ing slipped arches, cracks and
other structural damage.
"faone of the work on the
church is evident," said Olivier
Pieron, the project director for
the church's rebuilding. "Though
most of its systems were upgrad
ed, everything was left intact."
According to Pieron, because
the 7.0 earthquake wreaked such
extensive and costly damage, the
construction crew had initially
planned only repairs — not
upgrades and changes — to the
church.
But, thanks to the design
team's efforts to reduce construc
tion costs, they were "able to add
to the scope of the work," Pieron
said.
The additional work included
upgrading the electrical and
lighting systems, refinishing the
floor and 100 pews, installing a
sprinkler system, and adding
more exits so two of the balconies
— which had been closed
because they posed fire hazards
— could be used.
The renovated lighting system

consists mainly of several lights
hung over the middle of the
church, which was not previously
illuminated.
But the new lights aren't the
only reason the 89-year-old
church is brighter. The less
"gloomy" atmosphere of the
church, Dean of Chapel Robert

Ten million dollars
and three years of
repairs and
upgrades have
improved the light
ing, sound and gen
eral appearance of
the church.

Gregg said, is also due to last
summer's window cleaning and
the removal of chicken wire that
had covered the stained glass
since the 19605.
"It's the first time in 25 years
that there's nothing between the
sunlight and the windows,"
Gregg said.
Gregg ordered the wire
removed because it had outlived
its original purpose: protecting

the glass from the "unruly stu
dents" of the Vietnam War era,
who broke many windows on
campus in protest of the war.
Another change was the
removal of several pews from the
right side of the church, which
was refitted with 100 custom
made chairs. An altar was placed
in front of the chairs.
The area is now a "side chapel
for people who want some quiet,
without all the tourists with
video cameras," Gregg said.
Pieron said the project went as
planned, with only a few prob
lems such as the discovery that
the actual dimensions of the
church did not match those found
building's original plans.
Though several pieces of the
mosaic had been taken by people
as souvenirs, Pieron said the crew
had "pretty much everything we
needed."
Three important chunks of the
angel mosaic that had been miss
ing were returned anonymously
in April 1992.
Gregg said the only drawback
of being finished was saying good
bye to the construction crew.
"They were a crew of 30 who
really wanted to work here," he
said.
According to Gregg, the group
had previously worked together
during the construction of St.
Joseph's Church in San Jose and
made a special bid to work on
Memorial Church.
Fund-raisers were able to raise
more than the $10 million needed
to finance the reconstruction pro
ject, $8 million of which was used
for the actual construction with
another $1.5 million used for
maintenance.
Considering the usual difficul
ties of raising money for build
ings, the fund raising went
smoothly, said Ann Rossi, associ
ate area director for the Office of
Development.
Much of the funding came
from people who had been mar
ried in the church, she said.
A tale of two quakes
When an 8.3 earthquake hit
Stanford in 1906, the Victorian
steeple and clock tower that then
stood atop of the church's main
arches fell the 80-plus feet to the
floor with such impact that some
windows were blown out.
Afterward, workers disman
tled the entire church, except for
the arch system and the Round
Room. The rest of the church was
rebuilt and reinforced, except for
the arches, which the builders
assumed were strong enough
since they had withstood the first
earthquake.
But when the Oct. 17, 1989,
earthquake hit, the arches were
the first structures to weaken.
Chunks of mosaic tile fell from
the dome supported by the arch
es, breaking some of the pews
that were underneath.
"It was a near miss on
iiyuries," said Gregg, who was in
his office in the Round Room at
the time. A Classics Department
music and poetry program had
just concluded and students were

leaving the church when the
earthquake hit.
When Gregg came out to
inspect the damage, he said it
looked as if one of the arches had
slipped four to five inches, and
there were visible cracks at the
top of every arch. A piece of steel
from the ceiling had also fallen
and cut through the balcony rails.
"It was an eerie feeling hear
ing that such major damage
occurred but knowing that no one
was hurt," said Diana Akiyama,
one of the church's associate
deans.
Relocations
The closing of the church
forced several religious groups to
relocate their services. Until the
church reopened earlier this
year, the Protestant Ecumenical
morning services led by the
deans were held in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
However, the atmosphere in
the unadorned auditorium wasn't
quite the same. "It was like a lec
ture," Gregg said. "People had a

hard time warming to Dink."
He said the services lost
almost half of their normal con
gregation of about 400 to 500
worshippers.
Though the Roman Catholic
community did not lose as much
of its congregation when it moved

to Kresge Auditorium, Jim Erps,
a campus Catholic minister, said
he could tell that people "really
miss the beautiful art."
According to Akiyama, the
congregations — as well as the

tourists — are back to their pre
quake numbers, though they are
down from the more than 300
who attended Sunday services
during the first month after the
church's opening.
Regular churchgoers weren't
the only ones who missed
Memorial Church. Akiyama
said it wasn't until after the
church closed down that the
deans realized how many people
used it.
"We didn't always know who
was there," Akiyama said. "But
after it was closed, we heard
that a lot of people missed being
able to go in there during lunch
hour.
"People liked it because it was
so huge — they could go in there
to be alone and have some private
time."
This weekend, a Catholic grad
uation mass and an African-
American program will take place
in the church on Saturday, fol
lowed by the English Depart
ment's ceremony on Sunday.

Gregg ordered the wire
removed because it had outlived
its original purpose: protecting

the glass from the "unruly stu
dents" of the Vietnam War era,
who broke many windows on
campus in protest of the war.
Another change was the
removal of several pews from the
right side of the church, which
was refitted with 100 custom
made chairs. An altar was placed
in front of the chairs.
The area is now a "side chapel
for people who want some quiet,
without all the tourists with
video cameras," Gregg said.
Pieron said the project went as
planned, with only a few prob
lems such as the discovery that
the actual dimensions of the
church did not match those found
building's original plans.
Though several pieces of the
mosaic had been taken by people
as souvenirs, Pieron said the crew
had "pretty much everything we
needed."
Three important chunks of the
angel mosaic that had been miss
ing were returned anonymously
in April 1992.
Gregg said the only drawback
of being finished was saying good
bye to the construction crew.
"They were a crew of 30 who
really wanted to work here," he
said.
According to Gregg, the group
had previously worked together
during the construction of St.
Joseph's Church in San Jose and
made a special bid to work on
Memorial Church.
Fund-raisers were able to raise
more than the $10 million needed
to finance the reconstruction pro
ject, $8 million of which was used
for the actual construction with
another $1.5 million used for
maintenance.
Considering the usual difficul
ties of raising money for build
ings, the fund raising went
smoothly, said Ann Rossi, associ
ate area director for the Office of
Development.
Much of the funding came
from people who had been mar
ried in the church, she said.
A tale of two quakes
When an 8.3 earthquake hit
Stanford in 1906, the Victorian
steeple and clock tower that then
stood atop of the church's main
arches fell the 80-plus feet to the
floor with such impact that some
windows were blown out.
Afterward, workers disman
tled the entire church, except for
the arch system and the Round
Room. The rest of the church was
rebuilt and reinforced, except for
the arches, which the builders
assumed were strong enough
since they had withstood the first
earthquake.
But when the Oct. 17, 1989,
earthquake hit, the arches were
the first structures to weaken.
Chunks of mosaic tile fell from
the dome supported by the arch
es, breaking some of the pews
that were underneath.
"It was a near miss on
iiyuries," said Gregg, who was in
his office in the Round Room at
the time. A Classics Department
music and poetry program had
just concluded and students were

leaving the church when the
earthquake hit.
When Gregg came out to
inspect the damage, he said it
looked as if one of the arches had
slipped four to five inches, and
there were visible cracks at the
top of every arch. A piece of steel
from the ceiling had also fallen
and cut through the balcony rails.
"It was an eerie feeling hear
ing that such major damage
occurred but knowing that no one
was hurt," said Diana Akiyama,
one of the church's associate
deans.
Relocations
The closing of the church
forced several religious groups to
relocate their services. Until the
church reopened earlier this
year, the Protestant Ecumenical
morning services led by the
deans were held in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
However, the atmosphere in
the unadorned auditorium wasn't
quite the same. "It was like a lec
ture," Gregg said. "People had a

hard time warming to Dink."
He said the services lost
almost half of their normal con
gregation of about 400 to 500
worshippers.
Though the Roman Catholic
community did not lose as much
of its congregation when it moved

to Kresge Auditorium, Jim Erps,
a campus Catholic minister, said
he could tell that people "really
miss the beautiful art."
According to Akiyama, the
congregations — as well as the

tourists — are back to their pre
quake numbers, though they are
down from the more than 300
who attended Sunday services
during the first month after the
church's opening.
Regular churchgoers weren't
the only ones who missed
Memorial Church. Akiyama
said it wasn't until after the
church closed down that the
deans realized how many people
used it.
"We didn't always know who
was there," Akiyama said. "But
after it was closed, we heard
that a lot of people missed being
able to go in there during lunch
hour.
"People liked it because it was
so huge — they could go in there
to be alone and have some private
time."
This weekend, a Catholic grad
uation mass and an African-
American program will take place
in the church on Saturday, fol
lowed by the English Depart
ment's ceremony on Sunday.

The renovated Interior of Memorial Church.
This weekend marks the
first time Commencement
events have taken place in
Memorial Church since it suf
fered severe damage the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake.
Ten million dollars and three
years of repairs and upgrades
have improved the lighting,
sound and general appearance of
the church, in addition to repair
ing slipped arches, cracks and
other structural damage.
"faone of the work on the
church is evident," said Olivier
Pieron, the project director for
the church's rebuilding. "Though
most of its systems were upgrad
ed, everything was left intact."
According to Pieron, because
the 7.0 earthquake wreaked such
extensive and costly damage, the
construction crew had initially
planned only repairs — not
upgrades and changes — to the
church.
But, thanks to the design
team's efforts to reduce construc
tion costs, they were "able to add
to the scope of the work," Pieron
said.
The additional work included
upgrading the electrical and
lighting systems, refinishing the
floor and 100 pews, installing a
sprinkler system, and adding
more exits so two of the balconies
— which had been closed
because they posed fire hazards
— could be used.
The renovated lighting system

consists mainly of several lights
hung over the middle of the
church, which was not previously
illuminated.

only reason the 89-year-old
church is brighter. The less

summer's window cleaning and
the removal of chicken wire that
