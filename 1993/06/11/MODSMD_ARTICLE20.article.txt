What does the composer of an orchestral
symphony have in common with a Mayan
speaking anthropology major and a math
major whose experiments are being used by
NASA?
They're all recipients of this year's Dean's
Awards for Academic Achievement.
The award, honoring undergraduates'
intellectual accomplishments, is now in its
fifth year. This year's nine recipients — all
seniors — were nominated by faculty and
staff members they worked with in academic
or research areas.
Tanya Leise, a mathematics major, focused
on mathematical problems in the design of
zero-gravity space experiments in capillarity
for the past year. Her experiments have been
officially accepted by NASA to be part of the
second orbiting microgravity laboratory in
1994.
"It was nice to get recognition for plowing
along in an academic project," said Leise.
"You can sometimes get buried in the math
department."
Scott Starrett, an industrial engineering
major, was recognized for "Mountain Cas
tle," a composition he wrote for a large
orchestra, for which he studied classical
masters and worked directly with renowned
composers John Corigliano and the late

Pulitzer-Prize-winning composer Stephen
Alpert.
"I was surprised, because I'm an Indus
trial Engineering major, and I got an award
for work in music," Starrett said. "I've
never been institutionalized as a composer,
but Ithe project] was huge and a lot of fun."
Bianet Castellanos' anthropological
research project on gender issues and educa
tion of teenage Mayan girls took her to a small
village in Yucatan, Mexico. In the course of
her research, she learned to speak fluent
Mayan. Her findings were recently presented
at a session of the National Conference on
Chicano Studies.
Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Jim Fox, who
nominated Castellanos, said she "did a good
job of learning the language and thinking up
the project.
"Independent research in anthropology
means a lot of hard work and can be scary,
too."
Ethan Alpern, a biology major, began a
research project in the Department of
Pathology to explore a centra 1 ! problem in
blood formation related to "peripheral blood"
which may be used in bone marrow trans
plants.
Apostolos Lerios, majoring in computer
science, has worked on the Space Shuttle
Electrodynamic Tether System project in the
Space Telecommunications and Radioscience

Lab for the past several years, developing
much of the mission planning and operations
software and taking part in data analysis fol
lowing launch and recovery.
English major Angela Bakker's research
with Asst. Pediatrics Prof. Carolyn Russo cul
minated in her co-authoring a paper that is to
be published in the Journal of Psychological
Oncology. Bakker also helped pioneer a new
human biology course, "Seminar in
Bioethics."
liana Ben-Amos, who designed her own
major ("History and Philosophy of the Social
Sciences"), was recognized for her research
on the historical development of diametrical
ly opposed photographic stereotypes of
indigenous South Pacific islanders.
Edward Chan, majoring in electrical engi
neering, was recognized for his work at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. He
designed a printed circuit board and is cur
rently writing diagnostic programs to test for
bugs in the device.
Andras Vasy, who majored both in physics
and mathematics, was recognized for consis
tently being in the top of his classes in both
mathematics and physics, including several
advanced graduate courses.
Each honoree received a certificate, a
copy of the citation read at the award pre
sentation ceremony and a specially chosen
book with a personalized bookplate.
