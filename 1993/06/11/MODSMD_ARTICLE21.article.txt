# Sen. Dianne Feinstein 'an ideal commencement speaker'
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Dianne Feinstein, one of Cali
fornia's first two female U.S.
senators and a Stanford alumna,
will deliver this year's com
mencement address.
"Sen. Feinstein combines all
the qualities of an ideal com
mencement speaker," University
President Gerhard Casper said
in a statement. "She is a leader
in many senses of the word: a
pioneer, a person of authority
and influence. She possesses
both high intellect and down-to
earth realism. And she is, we can
be proud to say, a Stanford grad
uate."
Feinstein, who graduated
from Stanford in 1955, was
selected as the speaker for the
University's 102 nd commence
ment by Casper from a long list
of candidates drawn up by the
four senior class presidents.

"It was a significant list . . .
not as large as the Stanford
applicant pool or the freshman
class, but enough to give Casper
some choice," said Jean Fetter,
special assistant to the presi
dent.
According to senior class
President Jason Dicks, the list
included a "broad-based" group
of people from a variety of fields
and political circles.
Students, faculty and admin
istrators alike were enthusiastic
about Casper's choice of Fein
stein.
"We're really pleased. This is
definitely a choice that will be
well received by the senior
class," Dicks said. He added that
in informal surveys of the class,
Feinstein was a favorite for com
mencement speaker.
Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody also said the sen
ator is an ideal choice. "She's
someone who holds high political

office and she should have some
interesting things to say."
After Feinstein graduated
from Stanford, her work as an
intern specializing in criminal
justice led then-Gov. Edmund
Brown to appoint her to the Cal
ifornia Women's Board of Terms
and Parole. In 1969, she was
elected to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and even
tually became board president.
After the assassination of
then-Mayor George R. Moscone
on Nov. 27, 1978, the board
voted Feinstein mayor of San
Francisco. She was re-elected
twice.
In the 1990 race for California
governor, Feinstein, the demo
cratic nominee, narrowly lost to
then-U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. But
last November she was elected as
a California representative to
the U.S. Senate, becoming one of
the first two women along with
Sen. Barbara Boxer ever to hold

that position. Feinstein now
occupies a seat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
Brody noted that, as Stanford
has had more male speakers

than female in the past, "it's
good to get a gender balance."
Past commencement speak
ers have included modern art
authority Kirk Varnedoe in
1992, Haas Centennial Profes
sor of Public Service John Gard
ner in 1991 and "Doonesbury"
cartoonist Garry Trudeau in
1989.
Many say that Feinstein's
position as a successful woman
in politics makes her a good role
model for students.
"Having a woman speaker is
important," said Britt Wahlin, a
sophomore who was active in
Rep. Anna Eshoo's campaign in
the fall. "Now that the elections
are over, people think that
women have made their gain.
This is a good reminder that
women have a long way to go and
to recognize someone who's
doing well."
But Deborah Castler, presi
dent of Stanford Democrats, said

Feinstein "is a role model for
both men and women," regard
less of gender or political affilia
tion.
"She exemplifies the heights
we can attain in public service."
Many say they are also
pleased because Feinstein is a
well-known personality. Stu
dents in previous years have
complained that commencement
speakers were not prominent fig
ures.
In addition, many say Fein
stein is an especially appealing
choice because she is a Stanford
graduate. In her time here,
Dianne Goldman was a history
major, and was elected president
of Roble Hall, 1953 Quad year
book queen and 1954 vice-presi
dent of the ASSU.
"I think it's wonderfully appro
priate. Feinstein is a pioneer in
what she's done, and a nice role
model for Stanford students as a
Stanford alum," Fetter said.
