# You've come a long way, babe: 15 feet of lime Jell-O
##

Take off that robe, you poseur. The
facts remain: you still listen to Led
Zeppelin, you still think David
Letterman is funny and, somewhere
deep inside, you still like it when 16-
year-old women wear tight,
stonewashed jeans. College got you
absolutely nowhere. Only now you call
them women.
You haven't grown one bit. Four years
ago, your parents dropped you off, and
four years later they've come in the same
station wagon to take you home from
what still seems like some odd sort of
summer camp for kids with high SAT
scores.
As your parents make you say goodbye
to your "new friends" so they can hit the
road before it gets dark, you might find
yourself wondering if the last four years
were just an aberration — a four-year
long vacation from a lifetime of barbe

cues and friends named Vinnie.
But fear not, new friends. Although
you have been far too self-involved to
notice, subtle changes have been under
foot — subtle changes that have brought
you one important step closer to the
adult you have dreamed of being ever
since you walked in on your parents hav
ing sex.
Making out isn't as much fun as it
used to be. Tennis shoes have been
replaced by more respectable footwear.
Words like "cellular," "landscaping" and
"home pregnancy test" seem to be mak
ing increasingly frequent appearances in
your vocabulary. Fewer of your female
friends put a "y" at the end of their name.
You have female friends.
You can see it most clearly if you take
a step back and look at your so-called
peers. Many of them have acquired that
serious, sensitive, I've-seen-Native-

Americans-die, Kevin Costner look. Oth
ers have learned to turn that Keith
Moon/John Bonham debate into mean
ingful conversations about Nietzschean
hermeneutics. Some have learned to slide
an upwards of 15 feet on a slick veneer of
lime Jell-O, but they still have a long way
to go.
All of this quickly comes to a head as
the 18-year-olds and their crazy rock 'n'
roll ("Grunge, schmunge, it's just noise
to me") move out and "Hotel Twain"
kicks in with the grandparents and par
ents and 16-year-old sisters all dressed
up for graduation and the life you've
always dreamed of magically surrounds
you. And maybe you can hit up one of the
old guys for a job. While you shower next
to him.
As your parents try to cram the excite
ment of four years of finals and papers
into one day ("So, Peter, tell us what you

learned"), think of them not as your par
ents, but as your equals in a new game of
life that might — just might — force you
to sell the cattle ranch. Only, for some
reason, you still fmd yourself asking
them for cash.
No, things haven't changed. Only,
you're alone now, babe. After this, no one
is going to videotape anything you do,
and if they do, you'd better sign a waiver
first.
"And as we wind on down the road,
our shadows taller than our souls, there
walks a lady we all know."
Four years later, I still don't know
what that means. Only now I don't care.

Joel Stein is going to miss showering
with you in those long, unsanitary rows
of shower heads; it made him feel like he
got caught for knocking over a liquor
store.
