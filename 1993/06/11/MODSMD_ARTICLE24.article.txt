# FOUR YEARS IN SPORTS
## Athletes etch memorable moments into fans' minds 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
After the last cheer echoes off
the bleachers at Stanford Stadi
um, after the scoreboard in
Maples Pavilion flickers out and
the sounds of birds are heard
once again in the confines of
Sunken Diamond, we have the
memories.
Over the past four years, Stan
ford teams have racked up an
incredible 13 NCAA team titles,
as well as a host of NCAA individ
ual and Pacific-10 Conference
titles, once again establishing the
Cardinal sports program as the
best in the country. Stanford's 38
athletes in the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics brought home an unbe
lievable 19 medals — enough to
tie Stanford University with
Poland and Italy as the 13th most
successful nation at the games.
Swimmers Summer Sanders,
Jenny Thompson, Lea Loveless,
and Jeff Rouse were responsible
for a whopping 17 of those
medals.
All of this amounts to four very
successful years for Stanford ath
letics, and they will truly be years
to remember. .. .
1989-1990
There I was, a dorky freshman
with absolutely no idea what to
expect from Stanford athletics. I
figured that we probably won as
much as Harvard and Yale did —
which means I didn't expect
much.
Then I saw my first home foot
ball game:. Stanford vs. Oregon.
New head coach Denny Green
was at the helm. In an improbable
last-minute comeback, Stanford
scored two touchdowns in the last
seven minutes of play, capping off
the game with a John Hopkins
field goal that sealed the 18-17
win. Toto, I don't think we're in
the Ivy League any more.
That team went 3-8, but in a
dramatic battle for the Pac-10 cel
lar and, of course, the legendary
Axe, the Cardinal roasted hapless
California 24-14, and kept the
Axe on the Farm. Quarterback
Steve Smith, wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey and a little-known
running back named J.J. Lasley
were the stars that day.
Women's volleyball ran to an
18-12 record behind the swinging
arms of All-Americans Bev Oden
and Kristin Klein, but couldn't
hold on in the NCAA Tourna
ment, falling to Wyoming in the
second round. But they would be
back.
Men's hoops featured the
return of sophomore Adam Keefe
and guards Kenny Ammann and
John Patrick, who led the team to
a 17-10 record that year. One of
those wins, however, came in the
house that Wooden built, as the
Cardinal defeated the UCLA Bru
ins in L.A. for the first time in
Pauley Pavilion, 70-69. This,
along with Stanford's last win, a
79-58 thrashing of the Golden
Bears, helped ease the pain of not
receiving an NCAA tournament

bid that year.
The women, however, were a
different story. Superstars Sonja
Henning and Naismith Award
winner Jennifer Azzi led the
1989-90 Cardinal hoops squad to
its first-ever NCAA title over
Auburn. The win capped off the
women's basketball team's
incredible come-from-behind
story, as only five years earlier the
squad was lucky to draw a crowd
of 500 to Maples Pavilion. Since
that memorable 1989-90 season,
the team has been a consistent
sell-out.
Dick Gould and the men's ten
nis team enjoyed similar success
on courts of their own, as the
1990 version of the "best team
ever" captured its third-straight
NCAA title in Indian Wells over
Tennessee. It was the fifth
straight, however, for Frank
Brennan and the women netters,
as they clobbered No. 2 Florida 5-
1 in the Gators' backyard. With
help from Teri Whitlinger, San
dra Birch, Meredith McGrath,
Debbie Graham, Lisa Green, and
a little-known freshman named
Heather Willens, Stanford's
"dream team" of tennis racked up
its second-straight 29-0 season,
and few can argue that the team
ranks among the all-time greatest
in collegiate history.
Stanford's baseball team
would advance to the NCAA Col
lege World Series after its back
to-back title drives in 1987 and
1988, but would fall short of the
prize this year. Jeffrey Ham
monds and Pac-10 home run king
Paul Carey would lead the way for
this record-breaking squad.
Many will also remember the
success of the Stanford women's
soccer team that year, whose 0-0
tie of the No. 1 North Carolina
Tarheels was as much a "win
ning" moment as any the team
experienced that year. Never has
a tie done so much to show the

intensity and talent with which
Cardinal teams are capable of
playing.
What a year, I thought. Three
NCAA titles and some of the best
athletes anywhere. And I thought
I'd never watch a more exciting
Big Game. Until. ..
1990-1991
Ah yes, the year of glory. Stan
ford's football team would travel
to Notre Dame to deliver the
year's most shocking defeat to the
No. 1 Fighting Irish, but some
how even that victory got lost
amid the excitement of Novem
ber. For this was the year Stan
ford students would truly under
stand the meaning of the word
"Big" in Big Game. The Play, Part
11. The Penalty. The Field Goal.
The Ecstasy. Call it what you will,
it will truly live on in the Class of
'93's hearts as the Biggest of Big
Games.
Down 25-18 with 1:54 to go in
the game, quarterback Jason
Palumbis mounted a drive that
went the length of the field, beat
ing the odds on a fourth-and-eight
situation at midfield. The drive
ended with McCaffrey's leaping
catch in the back corner of the
end zone, bringing the Cardinal
within one with just 12 seconds to
go.
Coach Denny Green would
later say that the seniors made
the decision to go for the two
point conversion to win the game,
but the same pass that had landed
in McCaffrey's arms for the
touchdown found a Cal defender's
hands the second time around,
and Stanford had apparently lost
the game. The field was bathed in
a sea of sickening blue and gold.
Then, the words were heard
from the loudspeakers, as if spo
ken by an angel — a deep-voiced,
rather annoyed angel.
"Please clear the field. The
game is not over."

With those words, the fans
reluctantly returned to their
seats, reluctantly enough to earn
the Bears a 15-yard penalty on
the kickoff. Twelve seconds can be
an eternity in Big Game, and fate
would not be denied this day in
Berkeley, as Stanford's onside
kick plunked into the arms of Dan
Byers just before going out of
bounds. Nine seconds left.
Time for one pass for the Car
dinal, which went sailing over the
head of McCaffrey. Four seconds
left. But there was a flag on the
play — roughing the passer —
which brought Stanford in range
for Hopkins' leg. His fifth field
goal attempt, with no time
remaining, was as good as the
other four that evening, and the
Cardinal escaped with a 27-25
win. The field was then bathed in
a somewhat more agreeable sea of
Cardinal and white.
Football wasn't the only
excitement Stanford sports had
to offer that year. The women's
tennis team repeated its feat of
the previous year by again cap
turing the NCAA title. This time,
the victims were the UCLA Bru
ins, as the Cardinal overcame a
mid-season Florida loss that
ended a 76-match winning streak
to notch their sixth-straight
championship. Senior Kylie
Johnson's match win clinched it
for the 1991 version of "the best
team ever."

In some ways, 1991 was a year
of disappointment. Janet Evans,
Janel Jorgensen and Jeff Rouse
couldn't bring home the NCAA
title for their respective squads in
1991, though Evans and Jor
gensen returned home with indi
vidual titles. The women's basket
ball team was equally frustrated,
as Trisha Stevens' injured knee
would take her and her team no
further than the Final Four.
Men's volleyball saw its disap
pointment come in heartbreaking
fashion — in the final match
against UCLA. Men's gymnastics
and baseball would also entertain
title hopes, but for them, it was
not to be.
Of course, let's not forget the
men's basketball team, which
turned disappointment into ela
tion after failing to qualify for the
NCAA tournament. Sweeping
through the NIT tournament, the
squad captured the title at Madi
son Square Garden in March.
Andrew Vlahov would somehow
muster the strength to overcome
his ankle injury and play in the
title game, and Keefe and the Car
dinal would serve notice to the
nation that this was a team to be
reckoned with.
1991-1992
This season proved to be the
high point of the Cardinal's cham
pionship performances, as Stan
ford garnered a record-tying five

NCAA titles in men's swimming,
women's swimming, women's
basketball, men's gymnastics, and
men's tennis.
1991 was also a year of resur
gence for coach Green and the
Stanford football team. Building
on the momentum of 1990, the
Cardinal ran off an 8-4 record and
earned a bowl appearance for the
first time since the 1986 Gator
Bowl squad lost to Clemson.
Unfortunately, this Stanford
team would also lose in its post
season appearance, dropping an
18-17 heartjbreaker to Georgia
Tech in the Jjoha Bowl, but the
Cardinal ended up No. 22 in the
nation and second place in the
Pac-10.
Stanford's women volley
bailers would come knocking on
the NCAA door again, but UCLA
was there to slam it in their faces
in the West Regional final that
year, upsetting the favored Cardi
nal at Maples Pavilion. Klein,
nevertheless, was named Nation
al and Pac-10 Player of the Year,
while Oden would earn All-Amer
ican honors for the third year in a
row and head for the U.S. Nation
al Team.
Val Whiting and Molly Good
enbour would lead Stanford to its
third-straight Final Four appear
ance in women's basketball, and
for the second time in three years

The women's volleyball team captured Stanford's first NCAA title of
1992-93 and the squad's first championship ever by defeating arch
nemesis UCLA in the finals.


Ken Beer — Daily file
Stanford's football team has completed a 180-degree turnaround over the past four years. In 1989, the
squad was 3-8; In 1993, the Cardinal finished with a 10-3 record, Including a victory In the Blockbuster Bowl.
