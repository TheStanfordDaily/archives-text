# SENIOR SPOTLIGHT
## Whiting captures dream, leads basketball squad all the way 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
The tears behind the towel wrote a cruel end
ing to an otherwise magnificent and joyous era.
More than 2,000 points and 1,100 rebounds
after she first donned a Cardinal uniform, all
everything Val Whiting hid her face from the
final seconds of her college basketball career.
Colorado fired free-throw after free-throw like
gunshots at the senior's chest, and the disap
pointment consumed her. . . .
But this is not a sad story.
The clouds of pain created by not winning the
NCAA title this year will eventually pass —
revealing the energy and brilliance of Whiting's
contributions to Stanford basketball.
During Whiting's four years, the 6-foot-3 cen
ter and her teammates won two national champi
onships and reached the NCAA Final Four in
three consecutive seasons. Much of the success
resulted from Whiting's contributions and from
the way her teammates fed off her effort.
"There were games," Whiting's teammate and
classmate Molly Goodenbour recalls, "when
there'd be a definite change in the look on her
face, the way she called for the ball. You knew she
was going to take over the game."
Goodenbour says that Whiting's example
inspired others to excel. "She's a great player
because of her ability to make other players bet
ter just by her presence on the floor," she
explains.
Whiting had an impact on the team as soon as
she arrived at Stanford. During the previous sea
son, the Cardinal was already very good, led by
then-juniors Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding. But
hampered by a lack of rebounding, that team fell
one victory short of the national semifinals, los
ing to Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional

final.
The next year, the freshman from Wilmington,
Del., didn't start a game, but Whiting did provide
a remedy for Stanford's weakness. Despite com
ing off the bench, Whiting led the team in
rebounding, and the Cardinal rolled to a record of
32-1 and the school's first national championship
in women's basketball.

her ability to make other players
better just by her presence on
the floor.'

"She came in and gave us a dimension that our
team really needed — physical, aggressive play,"
coach Tara VanDerveer says, reflecting on Whit
ing's immediate impact. "Her rebounding was
the thing she contributed most to the team."
For her season-long performance, which
included 12.4 points and 1.8 blocked shots per
game, as well as the second-highest field goal per
centage in the Pacific 10 Conference, Whiting
was named national Freshman of the Year by the
Women's Basketball News Service. She also gar
nered Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors.
Of course, the rebounds Whiting corralled her
freshman year were just a small sample of what
was to come.
The senior finished her career with 2,077
points and 1,134 boards, the most in both Stan
ford and Pac-10 history.

Val Whiting receives a standing ovation with her parents at Maples Pavilion following her final home
game in a Cardinal uniform.
"It's luck, really," Whiting says
humbly when asked about her
rebounding prowess. "Defensive
ly, it's basically boxing out; but
offensively, it's being in the right
place, fighting for position."
The superstar's genuine mod
esty pervades all conversations
about her accomplishments.
Typical of her refusal to boast,
she seizes the opportunity to give
credit to one of her teammates.
"The best offensive rebounder
on our team is Rachel (Hemmer).
I don't know how she does it all

the time," Whiting marvels.
"Offensive rebounds — I'm just
happy when I get one. And then
it's, 'Yeah, I got an offensive
rebound.' "
VanDerveer notes that "Val
invests a lot in playing basket
ball"; the two championship ban
ners that hang in Maples Pavilion
are the most noteworthy divi
dends.
VanDerveer also holds that the
rewards of Whiting's investment
in basketball can be seen in her
steady improvement throughout
her career. As good as she was
upon arrival, Whiting expanded
her talents, constantly adding to
the number of ways in which she
could help Stanford win.

"She really improved her scor
ing and shooting," VanDerveer
says. "She moved further and fur
ther from the basket and contin
ued to score .... Her condition
ing, her defense — she really
improved those, too."
With the improvements,
Whiting and teammates won a
second national championship in
the center's junior year. Whiting
was named Pac-10 Player of the
Year for her success. Her 18.5
points and 9.1 rebounds per
game also earned her Kodak
First-Team Ail-American hon
ors.
Asked about VanDerveer's
influence on her, Whiting stresses
her coach's ability both to psyche

her up and calm her down.
"Tara's a great motivator,"
Whiting says. "She has a good way
of saying something to make a
player mad, and that's how I get
motivated. She'll say, 'You're not
doing this today,' and I'll say to
myself, 'I'm not doing that wrong.
I'll show her.' "
Whiting adds that VanDerveer
is "very complimentary about you,
and she makes you want to work
harder." Whiting says she espe
cially appreciates the times her
coach has come up to her and said,
"You're doing fine; don't worry
about the pressure on you or the
expectations."
As the tears at the end of the
season-ending loss to Colorado

suggested, Whiting puts plenty of
pressure on herself. Before the
team left for the West Regional
game, Whiting refused to evaluate
the still-incomplete season.
"We'll see how it ends before I
let you know (how things have
gone)," she said. With the season
ending defeat, the answer is
understood to be negative.
As for the future, Whiting
wants to be a doctor, perhaps a
pediatrician or a sports physician.
Last summer, she interned in the
neurology department at Stanford
Hospital and was able to watch
brain surgery and to interact with
epileptic patients.
Whiting, whose capacity for
caring must be limitless if the

heart she displays on the basket
ball court is any measure, enjoyed
the experience and hopes to intern
again at the hospital this summer.
Then, in order to make some
money to pay for medical school —
and to keep playing basketball —
Whiting is considering playing
professionally in Europe for a few
years.
"Basketball will stand out,"
she says of her Stanford experi
ence. But Whiting is thinking
seriously of the next chapter in
her life.
"If I get into a good medical
school and I'm doing well there,
I'll be happy with that, too," she
said. "Stanford will have prepared
me well."

credit to one of her teammates.
"The best offensive rebounder
on our team is Rachel (Hemmer).
I don't know how she does it all

the time," Whiting marvels.
"Offensive rebounds — I'm just
happy when I get one. And then
it's, 'Yeah, I got an offensive
rebound.' "
VanDerveer notes that "Val
invests a lot in playing basket
ball"; the two championship ban
ners that hang in Maples Pavilion
are the most noteworthy divi
dends.
VanDerveer also holds that the
rewards of Whiting's investment
in basketball can be seen in her
steady improvement throughout
her career. As good as she was
upon arrival, Whiting expanded
her talents, constantly adding to
the number of ways in which she
could help Stanford win.

"She really improved her scor
ing and shooting," VanDerveer
says. "She moved further and fur
ther from the basket and contin
ued to score .... Her condition
ing, her defense — she really
improved those, too."
With the improvements,
Whiting and teammates won a
second national championship in
the center's junior year. Whiting
was named Pac-10 Player of the
Year for her success. Her 18.5
points and 9.1 rebounds per
game also earned her Kodak
First-Team Ail-American hon
ors.
Asked about VanDerveer's
influence on her, Whiting stresses
her coach's ability both to psyche

her up and calm her down.
"Tara's a great motivator,"
Whiting says. "She has a good way
of saying something to make a
player mad, and that's how I get
motivated. She'll say, 'You're not
doing this today,' and I'll say to
myself, 'I'm not doing that wrong.
I'll show her.' "
Whiting adds that VanDerveer
is "very complimentary about you,
and she makes you want to work
harder." Whiting says she espe
cially appreciates the times her
coach has come up to her and said,
"You're doing fine; don't worry
about the pressure on you or the
expectations."
As the tears at the end of the
season-ending loss to Colorado

suggested, Whiting puts plenty of
pressure on herself. Before the
team left for the West Regional
game, Whiting refused to evaluate
the still-incomplete season.
"We'll see how it ends before I
let you know (how things have
gone)," she said. With the season
ending defeat, the answer is
understood to be negative.
As for the future, Whiting
wants to be a doctor, perhaps a
pediatrician or a sports physician.
Last summer, she interned in the
neurology department at Stanford
Hospital and was able to watch
brain surgery and to interact with
epileptic patients.
Whiting, whose capacity for
caring must be limitless if the

heart she displays on the basket
ball court is any measure, enjoyed
the experience and hopes to intern
again at the hospital this summer.
Then, in order to make some
money to pay for medical school —
and to keep playing basketball —
Whiting is considering playing
professionally in Europe for a few
years.
"Basketball will stand out,"
she says of her Stanford experi
ence. But Whiting is thinking
seriously of the next chapter in
her life.
"If I get into a good medical
school and I'm doing well there,
I'll be happy with that, too," she
said. "Stanford will have prepared
me well."
The tears behind the towel wrote a cruel end
ing to an otherwise magnificent and joyous era.
More than 2,000 points and 1,100 rebounds
after she first donned a Cardinal uniform, all
everything Val Whiting hid her face from the
final seconds of her college basketball career.
Colorado fired free-throw after free-throw like
gunshots at the senior's chest, and the disap
pointment consumed her. . . .
But this is not a sad story.
The clouds of pain created by not winning the
NCAA title this year will eventually pass —
revealing the energy and brilliance of Whiting's
contributions to Stanford basketball.
During Whiting's four years, the 6-foot-3 cen
ter and her teammates won two national champi
onships and reached the NCAA Final Four in
three consecutive seasons. Much of the success
resulted from Whiting's contributions and from
the way her teammates fed off her effort.
"There were games," Whiting's teammate and
classmate Molly Goodenbour recalls, "when
there'd be a definite change in the look on her
face, the way she called for the ball. You knew she
was going to take over the game."
Goodenbour says that Whiting's example
inspired others to excel. "She's a great player
because of her ability to make other players bet
ter just by her presence on the floor," she
explains.
Whiting had an impact on the team as soon as
she arrived at Stanford. During the previous sea
son, the Cardinal was already very good, led by
then-juniors Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding. But
hampered by a lack of rebounding, that team fell
one victory short of the national semifinals, los
ing to Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional

final.
The next year, the freshman from Wilmington,
Del., didn't start a game, but Whiting did provide
a remedy for Stanford's weakness. Despite com
ing off the bench, Whiting led the team in
rebounding, and the Cardinal rolled to a record of
32-1 and the school's first national championship
in women's basketball.

'She's a great player because of
her ability to make other players
better just by her presence on
the floor.'

"She came in and gave us a dimension that our
team really needed — physical, aggressive play,"
coach Tara VanDerveer says, reflecting on Whit
ing's immediate impact. "Her rebounding was
the thing she contributed most to the team."
For her season-long performance, which
included 12.4 points and 1.8 blocked shots per
game, as well as the second-highest field goal per
centage in the Pacific 10 Conference, Whiting
was named national Freshman of the Year by the
Women's Basketball News Service. She also gar
nered Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors.
Of course, the rebounds Whiting corralled her
freshman year were just a small sample of what
was to come.
The senior finished her career with 2,077
points and 1,134 boards, the most in both Stan
ford and Pac-10 history.

"It's luck, really," Whiting says
humbly when asked about her
rebounding prowess. "Defensive

offensively, it's being in the right
place, fighting for position."
