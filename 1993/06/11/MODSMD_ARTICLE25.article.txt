# SENIOR SPOTLIGHT
## Whiting captures dream, leads basketball squad all the way 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
The tears behind the towel wrote a cruel end
ing to an otherwise magnificent and joyous era.
More than 2,000 points and 1,100 rebounds
after she first donned a Cardinal uniform, all
everything Val Whiting hid her face from the
final seconds of her college basketball career.
Colorado fired free-throw after free-throw like
gunshots at the senior's chest, and the disap
pointment consumed her. . . .
But this is not a sad story.
The clouds of pain created by not winning the
NCAA title this year will eventually pass —
revealing the energy and brilliance of Whiting's
contributions to Stanford basketball.
During Whiting's four years, the 6-foot-3 cen
ter and her teammates won two national champi
onships and reached the NCAA Final Four in
three consecutive seasons. Much of the success
resulted from Whiting's contributions and from
the way her teammates fed off her effort.
"There were games," Whiting's teammate and
classmate Molly Goodenbour recalls, "when
there'd be a definite change in the look on her
face, the way she called for the ball. You knew she
was going to take over the game."
Goodenbour says that Whiting's example
inspired others to excel. "She's a great player
because of her ability to make other players bet
ter just by her presence on the floor," she
explains.
Whiting had an impact on the team as soon as
she arrived at Stanford. During the previous sea
son, the Cardinal was already very good, led by
then-juniors Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding. But
hampered by a lack of rebounding, that team fell
one victory short of the national semifinals, los
ing to Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional

final.
The next year, the freshman from Wilmington,
Del., didn't start a game, but Whiting did provide
a remedy for Stanford's weakness. Despite com
ing off the bench, Whiting led the team in
rebounding, and the Cardinal rolled to a record of
32-1 and the school's first national championship
in women's basketball.

'She's a great player because of
her ability to make other players
better just by her presence on
the floor.'

"She came in and gave us a dimension that our
team really needed — physical, aggressive play,"
coach Tara VanDerveer says, reflecting on Whit
ing's immediate impact. "Her rebounding was
the thing she contributed most to the team."
For her season-long performance, which
included 12.4 points and 1.8 blocked shots per
game, as well as the second-highest field goal per
centage in the Pacific 10 Conference, Whiting
was named national Freshman of the Year by the
Women's Basketball News Service. She also gar
nered Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors.
Of course, the rebounds Whiting corralled her
freshman year were just a small sample of what
was to come.
The senior finished her career with 2,077
points and 1,134 boards, the most in both Stan
ford and Pac-10 history.
