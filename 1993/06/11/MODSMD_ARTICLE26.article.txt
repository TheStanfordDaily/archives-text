Neiman, America's most famous sports artist, has been commissioned to paint
"Stanford Football & Bill Walsh." Neiman has painted numerous sports celebrities
and some of the biggest sporting events in the world. Neiman's style is filled with
dramatic intensity of abstract expressionist brush strokes that pick out strikingly
