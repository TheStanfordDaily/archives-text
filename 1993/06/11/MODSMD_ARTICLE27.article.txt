# SENIOR SPOTLIGHT
## Willens is tough on tennis court 
### Mike McDonough Senior staff writer 
Whatever you do, don't men
tion the family.
Senior Heather Willens, cap
tain of the women's tennis team,
does just fine on her own, thank
you veiy much. Forget the fact
that her grandfather Frankie
Albert quarterbacked Stanford
football to victory way back
when, or that her mom Jane
Albert was a top tennis figure of
her own. This woman has done it
all herself.
"I've gotten so used to being
compared with them," Willens
admits. "It's frustrating once in
a while, but I'm actually pretty
proud to be associated with
them."
Willens needed no family help
to establish her reputation on
the tennis court, however. In her
four years at Stanford, she has
become known as a feisty ball
getter who wins more with pure
determination than overpower
ing swings. In a collegiate field
packed with big serves and big
ger returns, Willens possesses
neither, relying on foot speed
and competitive drive to over
come opponents.
How good does that make
her? How about a Rolex Indoor
singles championship, a ranking
of No. 1 or No. 2 over the past
two years and a No. 5 national
ranking this year? Regardless of
her opponent, Willens seems to
find a way to win.
Willens was always pushed
toward athletics by her mother
and grandfather, who Willens says
"kind of expected" her to pick up a
sport. What they might not have
expected was that she would
express an interest at age seven.
"It was so natural — everyone
in my family plays some kind of
sport," Willens said. "I was
always interested in playing, so I
just picked up a racket and really

liked it."
By 11, Heather was clearly
following firmly in mom's foot
steps. That was the year of her
first junior-national tourna
ment, a competition that she par
ticipated in for several successive
years. By the time Willens
reached high school, she hardly
had time to play No. 1 singles
and doubles for her high-school
team.
"I think I played seven match
es my senior year," Willens said.
"I was so busy with juniors stuff
that I wouldn't be at practice
much."
Willens had her eye set on the
Farm even in those early days, she
says, but her first year on Stan
ford's highly touted women's
team was a bit of a wake-up call
from her juniors play.
"All my family and friends
went to Stanford, so I pretty
much always knew I would be
coming here," Willens said.
"When I got here, it was kind of a
shock, playing No. 6 singles on
what Frank (Brennan) considers
the greatest women's tennis
team ever."
That 1990 NCAA champi
onship team boasted now-profes
sional player Teri Whitlinger at
No. 1 and included a solid singles
contingent that Willens says
"would never lose." Willens used
that experience to forge her com
petitive attitude for the rest of
her stay at Stanford.
"I put myself in my niche on
that team," Willens said. "I said
to myself, 'OK, I'm No. 6, just go
out there and win your matches.'
What I learned the most is that
there's a fine line between you
and most of the other players."
This year, that experience paid
off for Willens. She ended the sea
son ranked No. 5 in the country,
but played No. 2 singles behind
teammate Laxmi Poruri, a posi
tion she says was fine with her.
"I was just worn out from the

pressure of being No. 1," Wil
lens said. "It was always very
close between Laxmi and I, but
it took me about a week at No. 2
to see how much better it was
for me. I feel better in the
underdog role."
Due to an elbow injury to
Poruri, however, Willens had to

step into the No. 1 spot against
UCLA this year. She rose to the
occasion, defeating the Bruins'
Keri Phebus in front of a rowdy
UCLA crowd.
"UCLA was my biggest win in
four years here," Willens said.
