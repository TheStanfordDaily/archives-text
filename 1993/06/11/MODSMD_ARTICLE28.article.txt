# SENIOR SPOTLIGHT
## Foudy looks forward to pro soccer 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Although Julie Foudy's
final collegiate season ended
this year, her international soc
cer career continues.
As a starter on the U.S.
National Team, Foudy can
take advantage of the few post
college opportunities open to
women soccer players.
Having already notched a
world title, the Stanford senior
plans to postpone medical
school until after the next
World Championships in 1995.
"The feeling I got in that
World Cup is what makes me
definitely want to play in
another one," said Foudy, who
helped the U.S. squad to the
title in front of 65,000 scream
ing fans in China last Novem

ber. "It was such an intangible
thing for so long. To finally be
there and win was just amaz

However, the team had a
difficult time just getting to
that point. The concept of a
well-funded women's program
faced stifT opposition from the
U.S. soccer establishment.
"The men's side said they
didn't want competition from
the women," she said. "That
was why it was so hard to get
the World Cup in the first
place. We couldn't call it the
World Cup because it would
take away from the men."
Another issue is whether
women's soccer is going to be
added to the 1996 Olympic
itinerary, a place where many
people assume it already
exists.

"Last year a lot of people
asked me if I was going to
Barcelona," she said. "It's frus
trating because you look at all
the sports represented and
almost all of them that have a
female equivalent are in there,
except for soccer."
But in recent years, the
women's game has grown.
Japan and Sweden now boast
fledgling leagues in which sev
eral national team players have
shown interest, and Foudy
would like to explore that
option.
Despite concerns about the
Olympics and a possible profes
sional career, however, Foudy
said she is still looking back at
her recently ended college
career.
"I wanted my last game
here to be something I could

look back on and think, 'I gave
everything and I feel good
about it.' But looking back on
that game, I don't thiiik that at
all," said Foudy of the 2-0 loss
to Santa Clara that knocked
the Cardinal out of the NCAA
tournament.
But Foudy considers that
game her only regret in a Stan
ford career which has seen the
Cardinal program go from
obscurity to a top-five national
power. And, from the time
Stanford tied No. 1 North Car
olina in Foudy's freshman year
to the present, she has played a
huge role in the Cardinal's suc
cess.
"Her physical abilities are at
a very high standard and when
she plays, she makes everyone

play better," said assistant coach
lan Sawyers. "She's very much a
team player."
She's also a team leader. "Off the
field, she's such a wacko," he added.
"She's one of the players that really

bonds the whole team together."
Foudy has indisputably left a
mark on the squad's character. A
chat with any player will almost
invariably lead to an anecdote
about Foudy's antics — whether
it's about her mocking goalie Chris
Massell during practice, playing
practical jokes on teammates dur
ing roadtrips, or tagging them with
not-so-flattering nicknames, like

Andrea Johnson's "Picker," earned
for her innocuous habit of picking
at a scab her freshman year.
The senior jokingly said her single
biggest contribution to the Cardinal
program was "them having to put up
with my obnoxkxisness for four years."
Considering her dazzling perfor
mances on the soccer field during
that time span, her teammates' tol
erance seems more than warranted.
