# SENIOR SPOTLIGHT
## Lollie sees highs and lows during four-year reign on the hardwood 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A point guard is often called
the "floor general" because the
person filling the position must
have a controlling mindset that
commands the respect of his fel
low soldiers.
From the moment he stepped
on the Stanford campus, senior
guard Marcus Lollie was just that,
running the Cardinal offense with
much success.
"The very first day I played a
pickup game with the team,
because of the way I grew up and
the way they played, it was a
contrast; they thought I was
crazy," Lollie said. "In the words
of Paul Garrett, 'Marcus is mili
tant.' "
Yet his teammates adapted to
his ways, and their court leader
guided them to many victories. If
there is one thing that Lollie does
not shy away from, it's responsi
bility.
"I like it," Lollie said. "That's
the part of basketball I enjoy. I
don't think any player minds
the responsibility of doing what

ever you can to make the team
win. I don't look at it as pres
sure, I look at it as something
positive."
Lollie shouldered much of the
burden in guiding the Stanford
basketball team this past season.
Last year, Lollie had the benefit
of a variety of passing options in
running the offense, making his
job as play-maker that much eas
ier.
He led the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in assists with a 6.5 per
game average, thanks in large
part to Adam Keefe in the post
and players producing from the
perimeter.
This year, though, assist
opportunities were few, and
consequently Lollie had to
adjust the focus of his game.
Instead of looking mostly to
pass, Lollie increased his own
offensive production to compen
sate for the Cardinal's dearth of
scorers.
"He hasn't had the help he
did last year to make him bet
ter," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "He can't pass the
ball effectively. He's had to do

more things than he should."
Throughout the Cardinal's
troublesome season, Lollie was
the one benchmark of consistency
on the squad. He played and start
ed in all of Stanford's games, and
logged the most minutes of any
one on the roster.
"He's such a tough kid men
tally," Montgomery said. "If we
had more people with his type of
mental toughness, we'd be in
much better shape."
"Marcus Lollie is the most
tough-minded point guard in
our league," said Washington
State coach Kelvin Sampson.
"He may not be the most talent
ed, but the intangibles he brings
far outweigh everything."
Despite Stanford's few suc
cesses in his final year, the
Seattle native managed to main
tain a consistently positive atti
tude, serving as a model for
impressionable young players
on the team.
"That's the way I've grown up
around the game of basketball,"
Lollie said. "If your outlook on
the game is positive, then you
should expect positive things to

happen.
"For me, this is my first losing
season, and I see parallels with
this season and life — there's a lot
of diversity, and a lot of problems
you have to face.
"But you have to get through
it, and the young guys have to
learn that. Just because things
aren't going well, you can't give
up and say everything is over,
otherwise you'll succumb to the
pressure and everything will be
over.
"They have to realize that you
always have to come out focused
and ready to play, because then
you get a domino effect, in terms
of your confidence in elevating
your game."
"Marcus has taught me about
leadership and to be cool under
pressure," said freshman guard
Dion Cross. "He keeps his head
on and comes to play, game in
and game out, and that's what I
want to do in my next three years
here."

Lollie, an economics major, plans
on pursuing a career in invest
ment banking after graduation.
