# SENIOR SPOTLIGHT
## Milburn explodes into limelight for Cardinal early on 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
In 1990, Glyn Milburn strode onto
the Memorial Stadium carpet and had
nothing short of the game of his life. In
that, his first Big Game, Milburn and
the word "explosive" were inextricably
enjoined. A conference-record 379 all
purpose yards later, the national spot
light had found a new target.
The experts saw a bright, flashy tail
back with limitless potential. He could
burst through the hole and into the
secondary with amazing quickness. He
had soft hands — a great receiver out
of the backfield. When he returned
kicks, "dangerous" was too mild an

At 5-foot-9,175 pounds,
speed and great moves
weren't just offensive
assets, they were tools
of survival.

adjective. He was a touchdown waiting
to happen.
Still a sophomore, Milburn was
already being penciled in as a sure Ail-
American, possibly a future Heisman
trophy winner. Lofty expectations
these were, and rarely had they been
heaped upon a college football player of
such physical stature. At 5-foot-9, 175
pounds, speed and great moves weren't
just offensive assets, they were tools of
survival.
Perhaps unfairly, many impatiently
waited for him to duplicate what he did
in the 1990 Big Game. Milburn himself
was included in that bunch.
While he says the expectations placed
upon him after that performance affect
ed him "both positively and negatively,"
he doesn't shy away from admitting he
felt added pressure.
"People, I think, expected me to have

that type of game in every game I played
from then on. That caused me to put a
lot of pressure on myself. And when I
didn't perform up to that level, I tried to
do something extraordinary to make up
for it.
"I just wasn't going out and enjoying
myself. I wasn't playing the way I had
been playing before I had gotten all the
attention."
The two years since Milburn's
record-breaking Big Game perfor
mance, though laden with successes,
were tumultuous ones.
He entered 1991 as a Heisman can
didate. But a knee injury slowed him
in the early season. Then, as Denny
Green's power-oriented running game
developed, Milburn was forced to play
second fiddle to backfield mate
Tommy Vardell. The fact that his tal
ents were by then widely known didn't
help either. Defenses have a way of
trying to shut down a team's most
explosive weapon, and, make no mis
take about it, Milburn was still that
man.
As Bill Walsh took the reigns of last
season's Stanford team, he promised to
do whatever he could to feature and
exploit Milburn's talents.
"I expect to use Glyn as we used
(Stanford's all-time leading rusher)
Darrin Nelson in 1977 and '78," Walsh
said before the season began. "We plan
on taking advantage of all of his abili
ties."
And to a certain extent the Cardinal
was able to do just that. Milburn had a
season worthy of All-Pac-10 honors.
This year only two college players bet
tered his per-game average of 176 all
purpose yards; just three boasted num
bers higher than his 16.8 yards per punt
return.
Walsh recognized Milburn's success,
but spoke almost remorsefully about
what could have been.
"I feel badly that we aren't able to
get him the ball in the open field as
much as we'd like to," Walsh said dur
ing the season. "He's had an excellent
year, no question about it. But I was

hopeful it would be a phenomenal
year.
"It really has no connection with
him, from the standpoint of his effort
level. We just haven't been able to set
up a platform from which he can
embark on a great year."

Looking back at Milburn's
career, you see Heisman
predictions that were left
unfulfilled. It's clear now
that maybe the expecta
tions ... were set too high.

If Walsh's high hopes for Milburn
had gone unanswered in the first 10
games, all that changed in the eleventh
game against Washington State. Mil
burn scored three touchdowns, two on
electrifying runs from 31 and 21 yards,
and rushed for 89 yards. The usually
mild-mannered Milburn even let his
excitement flow into a few post-TD
showboat acts.
Looking back at Milburn's career,
you see Heisman predictions that

that maybe the expectations —
there's that word again — were set
too high.
But make no doubt about it, Mil
burn has had an absolutely stellar
Cardinal career. He will leave Stan
ford ranked second in career all-pur
pose yardage, and third in career
rushing. And as much as anyone on
the Farm in the last three years, he
has played a fundamental part in lift
ing Stanford's program to national
prominence.

Milburn will join the ranks of the pro
fessionals next year by virtue of a second
round pick in the NFL draft by the Den
ver Broncos.

Running back Glyn Milburn is one reason the Axe has remained on the Farm through
out his four-year career.
In 1990, Glyn Milburn strode onto
the Memorial Stadium carpet and had
nothing short of the game of his life. In
that, his first Big Game, Milburn and
the word "explosive" were inextricably
enjoined. A conference-record 379 all
purpose yards later, the national spot
light had found a new target.
The experts saw a bright, flashy tail
back with limitless potential. He could
burst through the hole and into the
secondary with amazing quickness. He
had soft hands — a great receiver out
of the backfield. When he returned
kicks, "dangerous" was too mild an

adjective. He was a touchdown waiting
to happen.
Still a sophomore, Milburn was
already being penciled in as a sure Ail-
American, possibly a future Heisman
trophy winner. Lofty expectations
these were, and rarely had they been
heaped upon a college football player of
such physical stature. At 5-foot-9, 175
pounds, speed and great moves weren't
just offensive assets, they were tools of
survival.
Perhaps unfairly, many impatiently
waited for him to duplicate what he did
in the 1990 Big Game. Milburn himself
was included in that bunch.
While he says the expectations placed
upon him after that performance affect
ed him "both positively and negatively,"
he doesn't shy away from admitting he
felt added pressure.
"People, I think, expected me to have

that type of game in every game I played
from then on. That caused me to put a
lot of pressure on myself. And when I
didn't perform up to that level, I tried to
do something extraordinary to make up
for it.
"I just wasn't going out and enjoying
myself. I wasn't playing the way I had
been playing before I had gotten all the
attention."
The two years since Milburn's
record-breaking Big Game perfor
mance, though laden with successes,
were tumultuous ones.
He entered 1991 as a Heisman can
didate. But a knee injury slowed him
in the early season. Then, as Denny
Green's power-oriented running game
developed, Milburn was forced to play
second fiddle to backfield mate
Tommy Vardell. The fact that his tal
ents were by then widely known didn't
help either. Defenses have a way of
trying to shut down a team's most
explosive weapon, and, make no mis
take about it, Milburn was still that
man.
As Bill Walsh took the reigns of last
season's Stanford team, he promised to
do whatever he could to feature and
exploit Milburn's talents.
"I expect to use Glyn as we used
(Stanford's all-time leading rusher)
Darrin Nelson in 1977 and '78," Walsh
said before the season began. "We plan
on taking advantage of all of his abili
ties."
And to a certain extent the Cardinal
was able to do just that. Milburn had a
season worthy of All-Pac-10 honors.
This year only two college players bet
tered his per-game average of 176 all
purpose yards; just three boasted num
bers higher than his 16.8 yards per punt
return.
Walsh recognized Milburn's success,
but spoke almost remorsefully about
what could have been.
"I feel badly that we aren't able to
get him the ball in the open field as
much as we'd like to," Walsh said dur
ing the season. "He's had an excellent
year, no question about it. But I was

hopeful it would be a phenomenal
year.
"It really has no connection with
him, from the standpoint of his effort
level. We just haven't been able to set
up a platform from which he can
embark on a great year."

Looking back at Milburn's
career, you see Heisman
predictions that were left
unfulfilled. It's clear now
that maybe the expecta
tions ... were set too high.

If Walsh's high hopes for Milburn
had gone unanswered in the first 10
games, all that changed in the eleventh
game against Washington State. Mil
burn scored three touchdowns, two on
electrifying runs from 31 and 21 yards,
and rushed for 89 yards. The usually
mild-mannered Milburn even let his
excitement flow into a few post-TD
showboat acts.
