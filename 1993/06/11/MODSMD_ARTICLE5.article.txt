# SENIOR MEMORIES
## A 						case of graduation jitters Growing up isn't cute, and neither are pinstripes 
### Tamala Edwards 
Life is strange. Watching
"The Graduate" and finding it
relevant is even stranger. As I
sat there in Memorial Auditori
um with the rest of my class, ille
gally drinking liquor and danc
ing on my seat, I too acted as if I
was excited about the transition
to life on my own.
Then the movie started and
too many of the lines sounded
like things I had said or
thought. After the show, I
brushed it off as graduation jit
ters. I'm ready to go, ready to
make my way into the world and
establish a "real life" with "real
people."
So much for decorum and
making appearances — I'm
having problems with this grad
uation concept. It is late in the
day and time to "be real." The
truth is, I am going through a
crisis. I'm having a nervous
breakdown. I'm having a bad
hair day. I'm growing up and it's
not cute.
For the first time in my life,
I've had to make my own plans. I
found a job, a place to live, peo
ple to live with. I'm buying a car,
car insurance, a closet full of
suits and a lot of Vivarin and
aspirin to make my late nights in
corporate America a little more
bearable. Need I even say this

"adult" bit is getting to be a little
much?
I'm sure that I could be a tad
more optimistic, a tourh more
pleasant about the whole affair.
I guess I've seen too many alums
come back and stand around
with that star-struck look, like
Dorothy back in Kansas with
gritty stories to tell about life on
the outside.
There are no extensions in the
real world, no incompletes and
absolutely no dropping the day
before the final unless you feel
comfortable standing in unem
ployment lines.
When they ask me about the
highlights of my life I say going
overseas or spending summers
in different cities; they talk
about childbirth and home own
ership.
Excuse me while I adjust my
frame of reference.
I know I'll get through it. It'll
be fine. Once again, I'll get a
dose of my two not-so-favorite
life elements — character and
exposure — and realize it turned
out well. But as I sit surrounded
by everything I own in the world,
from my Raggedy Ann doll to my
job offer, it's hard to imagine the
next step.
Part of this is fear. I turn on
the television and watch mem
bers of my parents' generation
looking very somber and respon

sible. They talk about tax-breaks
and time shares, mortgages and
mid-life crises, pension plans
and parenting.
Some of them have been quite
successful, nicely fulfilling the
"Most Likely to Succeed"
prophecy. More of them have a
lot of bills, a lot of kids and a lot
of gray hair. They talk about the
good old days and listen to
cheesy radio stations; none of
them look like they'd be caught
dead at a peace march or civil
rights protest.
I made the right choice. Every
time I watch the sunset in the
Inner Quad, feeling the cool
breeze brush my skin and
smelling barbecues mix in with
the scent of evergreen, I know.
I got a great education in
beautiful place and had the time
of my life while I was at it. I have
met some wonderful people —
and some not-so-wonderful peo
ple — who helped me find my
way through the forest of my
youth.
McKinsey promises a whole
lot, but it can't compare to the
quiet cries, the exuberant living
and soul-felt laughter they made
special and mundane at the same
time.
Deep down inside, I know it's
time to move on. There's no way
to preserve this time, except in
memory, and to try would

invariably mean disappoint
ment. My friends are scattering,
preparing to spend long nights
in emergency rooms, law
libraries or corporate offices.
We'll talk less frequently and
watch the time between expand
from a few days to weeks to
months, until we're down to the
surprise phone call and expected
season's greetings.
But I also know that as I deal
with life's inconsistencies and
mistakes, I'll draw on the things
I learned from them and the sit
uations we survived together.
Its been a hell of a time. I've
enjoyed it to the fullest and I
wouldn't have done it any other
way. Now if only I didn't have to
wear a suit to work . . .

breeze brush my skin and
smelling barbecues mix in with
the scent of evergreen, I know.
I got a great education in
beautiful place and had the time
of my life while I was at it. I have
met some wonderful people —
and some not-so-wonderful peo
ple — who helped me find my
way through the forest of my
youth.
McKinsey promises a whole
lot, but it can't compare to the
quiet cries, the exuberant living
and soul-felt laughter they made
special and mundane at the same
time.
Deep down inside, I know it's
time to move on. There's no way
to preserve this time, except in
memory, and to try would

invariably mean disappoint
ment. My friends are scattering,
preparing to spend long nights
in emergency rooms, law
libraries or corporate offices.
We'll talk less frequently and
watch the time between expand
from a few days to weeks to
months, until we're down to the
surprise phone call and expected
season's greetings.
But I also know that as I deal
with life's inconsistencies and
mistakes, I'll draw on the things
I learned from them and the sit
uations we survived together.
Its been a hell of a time. I've
enjoyed it to the fullest and I
wouldn't have done it any other
way. Now if only I didn't have to
wear a suit to work . . .
