# Goodbye graduates, hello grad school
## 
### Gabe Miller 
Last Sunday night, sitting in
an auditorium full of smiling
seniors watching "The Graduate"
in cap and gown, I felt a sense of
belonging and warmth toward my
class, but I also had a strange feel
ing of regret.
I regretted the fact that I'll be
back here next year. It's not that I
regret my decision to stay; I look
forward to finishing my master's
work and I'm very excited to be a
resident assistant.
I just wished I could join the
portion of my classmates who
seemed to be saying, in their large
and somewhat dazed smiles,
"Well, we came in together and
we've been through a lot and now
it's over, so here we go, leaving
Stanford for new and exciting
places."
And we have been through a
lot: new experiences, intellectual
and personal growth, all the bit
tersweetness that makes college
an unforgettable time.
But the fact is, I'm not leaving
yet, so the whole graduation expe
rience doesn't feel as big and final
and life-transition-new-direction
as I'd expected and as I'd like it to.
I'm missing out on the sense of
closure and relief that other peo

pie are enjoying, saying things
like, "Well, I just finished the last
paper/class/final exam of my
Stanford career!" and"It hasn't
quite hit me yet."

It's not that I'm not really
happy about graduation, though,
because I am. It's great to be done
— if not DONE — and receive
some applause for four years of
undergraduate work. It's also
nice that after all their support
throughout my time here, my

family can be here to share in the
ceremony and celebration.
The best thing about senior
year has been the revitalization of
the feeling of class affiliation and
spirit at a level we haven't hit
since freshman year. I've really
enjoyed both the organized and
impromptu celebrations and
gatherings of members of our
class throughout the year.
I've found that at these events,
even if the people don't all know
each other, there is often a certain
understanding, a special apprecia
tion of where you're at and what
kinds of things you're feeling. The
communication of this common
ality often takes the form of little
smiles, nods and knowing looks
exchanged as if sharing a secret.
As nice as this is to be a part of,
it's this very understanding
which makes me feel a little weird
because I'm not fully sharing the
anticipation of moving on. But
I'm not alone; there are a fair
number of people from our class
who will still be here next year, so
I'll have '93 people to bond with
in our exciting yet post-climactic
fifth year.
After four years, I feel like I
know a pretty sizable chunk of
our class. Stanford's not a small
school, but it's surprising how

small it gets. You start with your
frosh dorm, which, apart from
your CIV track, is the major
source of self-identity during
freshman year. To that group you
add the people you meet through
them and the people in your
dorms each year, until you begin
to feel part of several circles of
people.
Then there are the activities
you choose to give your time and
involvement. When I look back on
Stanford, what I'll remember
most is singing with the Mendi
cants. The singing was a blast,
but even better was the sense of
camaraderie. I felt like we weren't
just a bunch of guys who liked to
sing, but a bunch of guys who
liked to sing together. I also got to
feel a part of a larger performing
arts community — a really fun
group of people.
This growing social support
network has been one of the most
positive parts of my Stanford
experience. I'll definitely miss my
classmates. Despite the realities
of the world today, I can't help
but feel excited to see what people
make of the coming years.
