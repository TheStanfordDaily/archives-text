# 'The choice is ours'
## 
### Mark Breimhorst 
There I stood in the sun,
exactly one year ago, sweating
in my black gown, my best
friends and comrades of the
past four years clustered
around me ♦ and my mother
screaming and waving a
Swedish flag from the stands.
Now, as I plunge into the
experience again — this time as
a master's candidate — I remem
ber the words that echoed from
the podium. My degree would
confer privilege — I'd known
that ever since I could count to
$20,000 — but did Don Kennedy
also say "responsibility"?
To my joy and chagrin, I had
become a member of America's
accredited elite, and I felt I had
to embrace the power I was
granted in order to improve my
corner of the world as best I
could. But what was the best?
For whom? Did my education
here point me in the right direc
tion? What had I learned? What
had I achieved? Who had I
touched? Who had touched me?
And who had I become?
I came to Stanford in the
usual way: my mother crying
and my resident assistants
knowing my name. The Black
Student Union and The Fire
Within froze the marrow of my
California liberal sensitivities
as well as those of most of my
other white frosh dormmates.
Did these self-righteous
spokespeople mean that Mike
down the hall couldn't be my
friend because he was black?
What was this multiculturalism
stuff anyway? We only knew
that it was being shoved down
our throats. I was going to ask
my roommate, but upon notic
ing his Book of Mormon, I held
my tongue lest I open the Pan
dora's Box of Difference.
Eventually, since it didn't
look like things were going to
get easier, I plucked up enough
courage to ask the questions
that frightened me, even
though I vehemently denied the
answers. I yelled down environ
mentalists, feminists, activists
and extremists of every type.
But no matter how loud 1
shouted, I couldn't drown out
the whisperings in my head.
They persisted in murmuring
the truth I yearned to suppress:
I, as a disabled person, had been
profoundly devalued and
oppressed. I didn't want to say
the words because I didn't want
to believe that people I loved
could cause such harm — even
unwittingly.
I couldn't change others, but
I could control myself. For me,
each homeless person does
make a difference, language
does form the way we think and
I am not totally comfortable
with human difference. Was I
ashamed of my reflection in the
mirror or was I proud to be dis
abled? I had to examine some

frightening aspects of myself.
Even now, a year later, I don't
know where I am. I don't call
myself conservative or liberal,
but I do call myself ablist, clas
sist, ethnocentric, racist, homo
phobic, sexist and many other
things of which I am not proud. I
don't mean to say that I have
ever overtly harassed or know
ingly discriminated against any
one, but I have done my share of
perpetuating and contributing to
the culture that produces those
actions.
I have a chance, as does every
one, to recognize and take
responsibility for altering my
behavior — not for anyone else's
sake, but to live in concert with
my own convictions.
I have failed to speak out at
comments that I believe are
dangerous to women, I have
male-bonded with the sticky
cement of locker room talk, I
have lied about getting to vari
ous bases as if intimacy were a
game. I am uncomfortable wear
ing the pink triangle of solidari
ty. I strive to recognize and ease
the hypocrisy.

I took my diploma last June
as I will Sunday with a proud
eye to my accomplishment and a
determined eye to the responsi
bilities of the future. I want to
be alert to alterations I can
make in myself and my immedi
ate environment.
Perhaps my college educa
tion, or, more precisely, my col
lege experience, has equipped
me with something besides a
passport into a nearly-guaran
teed lifestyle of opportunity. I
have learned, often against my
will, to critically examine
myself and the culture of which
I am a part and to which I con
tribute.
Perhaps I have learned to
examine myself honestly, but
can I break my solipsism and
complacency and take bold
action? The choice is ours . . .

with a master's degree in Educa
tion, after completing a BAin
Comparative Literature in 1992.

have lied about getting to vari
ous bases as if intimacy were a
game. I am uncomfortable wear
ing the pink triangle of solidari
ty. I strive to recognize and ease
the hypocrisy.

I took my diploma last June
as I will Sunday with a proud
eye to my accomplishment and a
determined eye to the responsi
bilities of the future. I want to
be alert to alterations I can
make in myself and my immedi
ate environment.
Perhaps my college educa
tion, or, more precisely, my col
lege experience, has equipped
me with something besides a
passport into a nearly-guaran
teed lifestyle of opportunity. I
have learned, often against my
will, to critically examine
myself and the culture of which
I am a part and to which I con
tribute.
Perhaps I have learned to
examine myself honestly, but
can I break my solipsism and
complacency and take bold
action? The choice is ours . . .

with a master's degree in Educa

Comparative Literature in 1992.
