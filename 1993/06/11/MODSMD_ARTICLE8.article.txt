# Graduating from a world of privilege to a world of prejudice
## 
### Karen Ho 
Now, those of you who con
sider yourselves real-life, bona
fide, professional actors might
get offended by this statement,
but I say: We are all actors, poor
players in an ongoing narrative,
filled with the rules that deter
mine the roles we "choose" to
enact.
Some people, especially those
armed with a high-powered
Stanford degree, find it easy to
believe that they can live their
own lives as they please. But
let's look at the agenda that we
are all in one way or another a
part of.
At birth, we are separated
into one of two sexes by the
shape of our genitals, and not
by, say, the length of our ear
lobes. There's such a wide range
of human experience — why are
there only two sexes? Why do
we have this fetish with dicho
tomies?
Suppose we accept this geni
tal-based definition of humans.
Now that we have constructed
two sexes, we construct two gen

ders. Who made this grand leap
of faith?
Just because we're divided
into two sexes doesn't mean
that we can be divided into two
genders. Just because you have
two types of trees doesn't mean
you can only have two types of
furniture.
Just because you're XX, does
that inherently mean that you
wear heels, carry bulky bags and
love a good cry? Do XX's have a
shave-your-legs gene?
Just because you're XY, does
that mean you have to take up
as much space as possible and
wear yuppie nooses arou nd your
neck when you dress up? Do
XX's have a find-breasts-erotic
gene?
Whatever happened to Simone
de Beauvoir's assertion, "One is
not born a woman, but rather,
becomes one?" Why have our
narratives so greatly limited our
human potential?
You might be wondering,
what's so bad about wearing ties?
So what if "females" have to
become "women?" So what if all
of us are constantly in drag?

Of course, there's nothing
inherently wrong with XXs
shaving their legs and XYs find
ing breasts erotic, but our sto
ries don't stop there. We catego
rize people and in doing so, we
require that they be a certain
way. "You are a man now, so act
like one." We buy into roles and
then assume we did it instinc
tively.
But the story gets even more
complicated. These categories
don't simply exist on a horizontal
plane; they are hierarchically
arranged in silly little opposites
such as abnormal/normal, stud/-
geek, angel/bitch, gay/straight,
black/white, dumb/smart, female
/male, fat/thin.
Not only do we have to act a
certain way to fulfill certain cat
egories, but the categories we're
in might be the ones on the
other side of the dichotomy. In
our particular cultural narra
tive, flesh colored make-up hap
pens to be white and so does
soap. We necessitate some peo
ple to be women, and once they
are, they have to be thin. Simi
larly, men need washboard

stomachs and inverted triangle
chests.

The crazy thing about it all is
that this cycle never ends. The
dichotomies are endless and no
one can have all the dichotomies
leaning to the side of the
IDEAL. We all kill to perform as
close to the ideal as possible and
many of us fail.

If I wanted to enact this nar
rative, I would need a sex
change, a body bleach, a facial
restructuring, a husband, 2.5
children, 2.5 cars, a house in the
suburbs, a clean-shaven armpit,
an ironflat stomach, etc., etc.
Why?
Why limit ourselves? Why
continue stepping on those who
do not have the "privilege" to
enact these narratives? Why are
we born into the world with the
potential of becoming every
thing, only to become one
thing? Why don't we challenge
these stupid definitions, act like
the King Lear's fool we have
always wanted to be and in
doing so, resist, resist, resist.
Resist the future we cannot
know.
I'm not claiming to have
some amazing oppositional con
sciousness that I will use to sub
vert other culturally instituted
differences that define, limit
and oppress us, but I can begin
to ask critical questions. I can
refuse to be categorized as a
stereotypical Asian-American
woman; I can help to keep oth

ers from being categorized. I
can then fight for the disappear
ance of these categories.
At Stanford, we have this fight
ing privilege, this access to physi
cal and mental space that allows
us to begin to reclaim our identi
ties and at the same time, refuse
to be essentialized into these
bounded and maybe even deval
ued identities. But I doubt many
of us take on this challenge.
Frantz Fanon once said that
the wretched of the earth are the
truth of the society, for they see a
world that they must be a part of,
but cannot be. Since we privi
leged few are not as deeply cate
gorized outside of society,
shouldn't we use this privilege to
enter into the margins, reclaim it
as a center and then destroy the
possibility of it ever becoming the
center?

If I wanted to enact this nar
rative, I would need a sex
change, a body bleach, a facial
restructuring, a husband, 2.5
children, 2.5 cars, a house in the

an ironflat stomach, etc., etc.
Why?
Why limit ourselves? Why
continue stepping on those who
do not have the "privilege" to
enact these narratives? Why are
we born into the world with the
potential of becoming every
thing, only to become one
thing? Why don't we challenge
these stupid definitions, act like
the King Lear's fool we have
always wanted to be and in
doing so, resist, resist, resist.
Resist the future we cannot
know.
I'm not claiming to have
some amazing oppositional con
sciousness that I will use to sub
vert other culturally instituted
differences that define, limit
and oppress us, but I can begin
to ask critical questions. I can
refuse to be categorized as a
stereotypical Asian-American
woman; I can help to keep oth

ers from being categorized. I
can then fight for the disappear
ance of these categories.
At Stanford, we have this fight
ing privilege, this access to physi
cal and mental space that allows
us to begin to reclaim our identi
ties and at the same time, refuse
to be essentialized into these
bounded and maybe even deval
ued identities. But I doubt many
of us take on this challenge.
Frantz Fanon once said that
the wretched of the earth are the
truth of the society, for they see a
world that they must be a part of,
but cannot be. Since we privi

shouldn't we use this privilege to
enter into the margins, reclaim it
as a center and then destroy the
possibility of it ever becoming the
center?

Now, those of you who con
sider yourselves real-life, bona
fide, professional actors might
get offended by this statement,
but I say: We are all actors, poor
players in an ongoing narrative,
filled with the rules that deter
mine the roles we "choose" to
enact.
Some people, especially those
armed with a high-powered
Stanford degree, find it easy to
believe that they can live their
own lives as they please. But
let's look at the agenda that we
are all in one way or another a
part of.
At birth, we are separated
into one of two sexes by the
shape of our genitals, and not
by, say, the length of our ear
lobes. There's such a wide range
of human experience — why are
there only two sexes? Why do
we have this fetish with dicho
tomies?
Suppose we accept this geni
tal-based definition of humans.
Now that we have constructed
two sexes, we construct two gen

ders. Who made this grand leap
of faith?
Just because we're divided
into two sexes doesn't mean
that we can be divided into two
genders. Just because you have
two types of trees doesn't mean
you can only have two types of
furniture.
Just because you're XX, does
that inherently mean that you
wear heels, carry bulky bags and
love a good cry? Do XX's have a
shave-your-legs gene?
Just because you're XY, does
that mean you have to take up
as much space as possible and
wear yuppie nooses arou nd your
neck when you dress up? Do
XX's have a find-breasts-erotic
gene?
Whatever happened to Simone
de Beauvoir's assertion, "One is
not born a woman, but rather,
becomes one?" Why have our
narratives so greatly limited our
human potential?
You might be wondering,
what's so bad about wearing ties?
So what if "females" have to
become "women?" So what if all
of us are constantly in drag?

Of course, there's nothing
inherently wrong with XXs
shaving their legs and XYs find
ing breasts erotic, but our sto
ries don't stop there. We catego
rize people and in doing so, we
require that they be a certain
way. "You are a man now, so act
like one." We buy into roles and
then assume we did it instinc
tively.
But the story gets even more
complicated. These categories
don't simply exist on a horizontal
plane; they are hierarchically
arranged in silly little opposites
such as abnormal/normal, stud/-
geek, angel/bitch, gay/straight,
black/white, dumb/smart, female
/male, fat/thin.
Not only do we have to act a
certain way to fulfill certain cat
egories, but the categories we're
in might be the ones on the
other side of the dichotomy. In
our particular cultural narra
tive, flesh colored make-up hap
pens to be white and so does
soap. We necessitate some peo
ple to be women, and once they
are, they have to be thin. Simi
larly, men need washboard

stomachs and inverted triangle
chests.

The crazy thing about it all is
that this cycle never ends. The
dichotomies are endless and no
one can have all the dichotomies
leaning to the side of the
IDEAL. We all kill to perform as
close to the ideal as possible and
many of us fail.
