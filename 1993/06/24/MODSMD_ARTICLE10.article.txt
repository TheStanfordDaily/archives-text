## Engineer heads down under for dam project 
### June Cohen Senior staff writer 
Although her college career
was marked by success, recent
graduate Jennifer Fox fully ex
pected to fail in the Fulbright de
partment.
Because of her youth and
what she perceived as the gener
ality of her interests, she didn't
think she had a chance at the
prestigious award. "I construed
the Fulbright as an award for
people who were doing very high
scholarly research," said Fox,
whose friends call her Grey. "I
figured, 'Why would I get an
award like that?'"
Shrugging off the accom
plishment with characteristic
modesty and a quick, embar-

rassed smile, Fox explained that she didn't want
to "make professors waste their time" by writing
her recommendations for a grant she wouldn't
win. Because she was embarrassed to ask them,
Fox all but gave up on the idea of applying.
But two days before the application deadline,
she received a letter from a professor in New
Zealand to whom she had written several months
before.
The letter invited her to study water resource
management at a university in southern New
Zealand, provided she found the grant money to
pay for it. Inspired by the encouragement, Fox did
just that.
A 1992 graduate in environmental engineering
who received her master's in the same subject this
fall, Fox is one of many young scholars nationwide
benefiting from the recent upsurge in Fulbright
grants.
Beginning next spring, she will spend nine

months in New Zealand
studying the politics behind a
dam project there. An out
standing and involved stu
dent while at Stanford —
winning a national essay con
test and serving as a resident
assistant, in Synergy rank
among her accomplishments
— Fox approaches the experi
ence with a combination of
academic fervor and civic
minded responsibility.
"I wanted to do some
thing practical," said Fox,
who currently works in the
Air and Toxics division of the
San Francisco Environmen
tal Protection Agency. "I'm
interested in knowing what
happened in this particular
project — but not just to write

a paper about it."
She hopes to examine several aspects of the
dam project — including how different agencies in
teracted, how project momentum was sustained
and the extent to which the area's natural wildlife
was taken into consideration — by combining aca
demic research with hands-on field work.
This combination of big-picture and fine-detail
knowledge should serve Fox well in the future.
With goals as lofty as heading the EPA or a simi
lar environmental agency, Fox plans to put her
academic knowledge to work in a real-world set
ting.
"I would like to eventually be in a position
where I can consider these big-picture ideas," Fox
said. "But larger-picture decisions require an un
derstanding of the more minute detail, which is
why I chose to mqjor in engineering and why I'd
like to have an understanding of how projects in
different countries are organized."
