### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
The biggest sticking point Jory Steele en
countered when researching a paper on the sec
ondary education of South African women was
that she could only find one book on the sub
ject.
"It was a case study about one woman who
went to high school," she said. "It was tragic
because she was very unstable, left the school,
became a schizophrenic and spent the rest of
her life in a mental institution for blacks. That
was the only thing I found."
So when she saw a flyer posted on campus
for a meeting for Fulbright applicants, Steele
decided to apply for a scholarship to go to South

Africa and research the area herself.
Steele, a graduated senior who
majored in international re-

lations with a focus in
Africa, said she got

the confidence she
needed to apply
from her moth
er and her fa
ther, Psycholo
gy Prof. Claude
Steele.

"I was talking to
my mom the day of A

the meeting and she said, 'You should go.'
Then, when she found out I applied for South
Africa, she was horrified — because it's so dan
gerous there."
One of the handful of undergraduates
awarded a Fulbright to Africa, Steele fits neat- ,

that includes her uncle, Shelby Steele, a
prominent English professor at San Jose j

State.
