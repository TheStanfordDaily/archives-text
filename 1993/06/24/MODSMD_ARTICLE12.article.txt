# A 						look at the younger, greener Fulbrights

### Romesh Ratnesar 
Just two years ago, the
Fulbright Scholarship
was believed to be crip
pled by "damage that
may be irreparable."
A report issued by the panel
that supervises the scholarship
cited a 50 percent drop since
1953 in the number of grants
awarded to students as evidence
of the general lack of focus that
threatened the Fulbright's via
bility.
Today, however, as the Ful
bright nears its 50th year of
sponsoring research by Ameri
can students and scholars in for
eign countries, the scholarship
is enjoying an unprecedented
renaissance in funding and in-

terest.
In fact, Fulbright has ex
panded its opportunities since the release
of the 1991 "white paper," adding about
100 grants earmarked for graduating se
niors in the last two years.
Like other international exchanges, Ful
bright is reaping the benefits of a renewed
commitment to international cooperation
among American universities, foreign
scholars and Washington lawmakers.
That spirit was brought on in part, ob
servers say, by the end of the Cold War and
the fracturing of diplomatic barriers that
once hindered intellectual pursuit in for
eign lands.
Such developments have contributed to
a "massive increase in interest in interna
tional exchange," said John Pearson, direc
tor of Stanford's Bechtel International
Center. "In many ways, opportunities for
American students are greater than they
were a few years ago."
Nowhere is that more true than at the
venerable Fulbright, historically the most
recognizable and prestigious American
based exchange fellowship. Last year, $156
million poured into Fulbright from Con
gress and foreign contributors.
The increase in money and attention
for Fulbright has been a boon for American
undergraduates, who in the past five years
have become the focus of the program's
new visibility.
In competition for last year's scholar
ships, almost 45 percent of the 4,000 appli
cants were graduating seniors, nearly dou
ble the number from 1990, according to
Theresa Granza, an official at Fulbright's
student scholarship program.
Among those selected as Fulbright
scholars this May were 13 Stanford stu
dents, six of whom were graduating se
niors. These students will each receive
about $20,000 over the next year to con
duct research in a chosen country.
"The Fulbright scholarship has placed
emphasis on reorienting the focus of the
program to what it originally was
meant to do — encourage young

people

to get involved in study abroad," Granza
said. "Certainly the interest in Fulbrights
has increased in the last two years — we're
seeing students competing for Fulbrights
who did not think they could before.
"There has been a renewed interest in
graduating seniors," she added.
"Fulbright always said that they encour
aged undergraduates to apply," Pearson
said. "From my personal view, we've only
seen noticeable change in the last couple of
years in terms of the number of graduating
seniors getting Fulbrights."
A second life
The Fulbright scholarship was estab
lished in 1946 to send American scholars
overseas and bring foreign scholars to
American schools. Fulbright receives a
large percentage of its funds from Con
gress.
"In 1947, there was a saying that there
were two ways to go abroad — join the U.S.
Army, or win a Fulbright," said Steve
Bladge of the Council of International Ex
change, which administers Fulbrights to
faculty of American universities.
The Fulbright soon became regarded as
the flagship of American exchange pro
grams, but its financial viability has been
debated frequently.
In 1981, the Reagan administration, as
part of sweeping cuts in government spend
ing, proposed a 40 percent decrease in Ful
bright funding. However, a "groundswell of
anger" among academics spawned legisla
tion sponsored by former Florida Senator
Claiborne Pell which actually doubled the
size of the Fulbright program, Bladge said.
Ten years later, the widely publicized
"white paper," — released by the pro
gram's governing body, the J.William Ful
bright Foreign Scholarship Board — crit
icized the program for offering grants in
too many countries while sacrificing the
quali-

ty of the research, and diverting concentra
tion from student to faculty scholarship.
Student grants had dropped from nearly
1,000 in 1953 to just 500 in 1989, the study
showed.
"It was an introspective look at what we
needed to do stay vital and alive as we
moved towards the year 2000," Bladge said
of the panel's report. "It was a look inward,
more philosophical than political in bent."
After the cold war
Both Bladge and Pearson said the re
birth of the Fulbright in the last two years
can not necessarily be attributed to the find
ings of the white paper. Instead, nascent po
litical openness in Eastern and Central Eu
rope and other parts of the world brought
on by the collapse of Communism galva
nized Congressional support of more ag
gressive American scholarship abroad.
"In the last two years there has been an
increase in Congressional funding of the
Fulbright program," Bladge said. "That is a
reflection of the desire within Congress to
look for different ways in the post-Cold War
world to form new diplomatic ties with
other countries."
Although the Fulbright "is not meant to
be targetted as an instrument of policy, it
has an indirect connection to U.S. interests
and foreign policy," Bladge said
"The door |to study abroad] is open, and
the need is great," he added.
And despite the admonishments of the
white paper, which suggested that Ful
bright was involved too lightly in too many
places, study by Fulbright scholars in coun
tries outside Europe has blossomed as
funding has increased.
Among the six Stanford seniors who
won Fulbrights this year, two — Bradley
Bruner and Jeremy Woods — plan to study
and research in Germany. The remaining
scholars, however, will spend
their grant

funds in Madagascar, New
Zealand, Nicaragua and South
Africa.
"Because we're getting
more applicants, we've
widened the diversity of the
pool of grants," Granza said.
"The number of applicants to
Latin America and Africa has
increased tremendously."
Many of those projects
are directed towards a practi
cal end outside of academia.
Among Stanford's Fulbright
winners, Julia Novy will study
conservation biology in Mada
gascar; Bruner will teach Eng
lish to German primary school
students; Jennifer Fox will ex
amine New Zealand's environ
mental and water resource

management; and Cara Lar
son will study the quality of prenatal care in
Nicaragua.
Granza said the Fulbright projects con
ducted by graduating seniors tend to be
"eclectic. Younger students are not neces
sarily (solely) academically focused."
Pearson said there is an element of "giv
ing back to the (host) country" among Ful
bright winners, and more pragmatic pro
jects seem to be common among under
graduate winners.
"The thing I sense is that many of the
commissions and universities are a little
more willing to take a gamble on under
graduates," he said. "Countries themselves
each year can say, 'for next year of Ful
brights, these are the subjects we are inter
ested in.' "
But will foreign governments continue
to encourage American research in their
countries, even as the standard of their stu
dents rise? Or is the renaissance of the Ful
bright, again, in danger?
"One of Fulbright's essential merits is
that it is such a broad-based program,"
Bladge said. "It is flexible enough to adapt
to any changes worldwide." Granza, too,
said she expects the "Fulbright will contin
ue to see growth and emphasis within the
U.S. on the student program."
Pearson is hesitant to conclude that for
eign countries no longer want American
scholars to study there. "While I think
some systems (abroad! are stronger and
better organized than they were before,
many universities overseas are strug
gling." He added that "there's more will
ingness to understand why American stu
dents want to go overseas."
And while the world around the program
continues to change, the Fulbright name
still represents integrity and prestige.
"As long as J. William Fulbright is alive, the
program will be strong," Pearson said. "There's
a tremendous amount of goodwill and respect
for the relationships built through the Ful
bright.."
