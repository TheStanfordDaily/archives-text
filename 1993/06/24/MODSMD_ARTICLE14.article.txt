# Following Sting, Novy to crunch rainforest crisis
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
For most young women, em
ulating their sisters means get
ting good grades or making the
cheerleading squad. But for
Julia Novy, it meant scoring a
Fulbright.
Novy, a graduated senior ma
joring in Human Biology with a
focus in global development,
ecology and conservation biolo
gy, received a grant to study the
rainforests in the northeast of
Madagascar, a country off the
coast of Africa. Her sister re
ceived a Fulbright two years ago
to examine the increasing un
rest in the former Czechoslova
kia.

Although she admits that she
first became aware of Madagas
car through the board game RISK, Novy said her
interest was piqued when she began to look at
books showing the incredible biodiversity there.
"Its so biologically unique in being separated
from the African mainland," she said. "There are
extremely high levels of endemism — species
that exist no where else — kind of like in
Australia."
Madagascar, much larger than the RISK
board makes it appear, is about the size of
California, Ore
gon and

Washington combined, and it
contains the largest remain
ing rainforest on the African
continent, Novy said.
Novy's project will ex
amine "non-timber" forest
products such as palm
fronds and thatching mater
ial, both of which are natu
rally replenishable and do
not contribute to the rapid
shrinking of the rainforest.
"I'll be looking at
those products as sustain
able economic alternatives to
'slash and burn' agriculture,
which is the main cause of
deforestation," she said.
Novy says her ap
proach to conservation ac
knowledges "the fact that
Madagascar people need to

derive economic revenue
from the forest. But if the forest disappears they
won't be able to derive that revenue."
Novy will begin her research in October, when
she heads off to sign a year's lease for a tent situ
ated just outside of the rain forest.
Accustomed to tent-life after spending a sum
mer in similar quarters in Bolivia two summers
ago, Novy said she isn't particularly concerned
about the nature of her living quarters.
"There are a couple of field stations where you
can store gear and where we have a cook," she
said.
In the three months until she leaves, Novy
plans on researching the area and learning Mala
gaphy, the native language of Madagascar which
is spoken along with French, in which she is al
ready fluent. She has already obtained Malaga
phy tapes and books from the Madagiiscar con-

sulate — a "very support-

ive" chap who is conve
niently located in

Palo Alto.
"I think my
' experience
over there is
going to tell me

a lot about what 1
want to do," she
said.
