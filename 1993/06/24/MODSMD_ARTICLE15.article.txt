## Women's soccer coach resigns under pressure 
### 
Berhane Andeberhan resigned on June 9
as Stanford women's soccer coach amid
charges of player abuse, accepting a new po
sition within the Athletic Department as liai
son to U.S. Soccer and World Cup '94.
The reassignment was reportedly spurred
by player complaints that Andeberhan ver
bally abused team members.
Players complained that Andeberhan en
gaged in psychological tug-of-wars. "He
doesn't communicate well, and he incorpo
rates personal lives on the field," said senior
Cardinal goalkeeper Leslie Garrard.
According to the San Jose Mercury News,
Andeberhan told 1991 graduate and former
starting fullback Kerry Stivaletti that his
constant criticism of her weight during her
sopnomore year was intended to test her loy
alty to the team. Stivaletti said that Andeber

han was one of the reasons she developed bu
limia that year.

The Mercury News also
reported that Andeberhan
threatened to slap team
captain Denise Denney
during an argument in a
1991 Stanford-Cal game.
Denney was cut from the
squad the next day but was
later reinstated.
Fifteen players — in
cluding Denney — and

three parents filed complaints with Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland in April of this
year. The letters prompted several meetings
among former and current team members,
parents, Andeberhan, Senior Assoc. Athletic
Director Cheryl Levick and Leland.

Garrard said that the Athletic Depart
ment seemed committed to supporting the
athletes throughout the investigation. Ice
land could not be reached for comment yes
terday.
Controversy over alleged athlete abuse is
not new to the Athletic Department. A flurry
of complaints followed last spring's depar
ture of Stanford track and field coach Brooks
Johnson.
In response to the charges Leland issued a
statement asserting that "there is no excuse
for any student to be physically or psycholog
ically demeaned in any setting," and that all
Stanford coaches, "agree that while winning
is important, the quality of experience that
the student-athlete has is paramount."
The Athletic Department is currently
searching for a replacement for Andeberhan,

who in six years amassed a record 0f77-26-11.
In the last three years, he led the Cardinal
to three straight NCAA tournament appear
ances and a 43-9-4 record. Stanford advanced
to the NCAA quarterfinals the past two
years, both times finishing the year ranked
fifth in the nation.
"He helped make Stanford one of the top
women's soccer programs in the nation, " Ice
land said in a recent press release. "I am
pleased that he is turning his energies to
wards the World Cup and am certain he will
do an excellent job."
Andeberhan's new duties include coordi
nating communications between the Athlet
ic Department and the committees organiz
ing World Cup '94, which will be held in the
U.S. next summer.
