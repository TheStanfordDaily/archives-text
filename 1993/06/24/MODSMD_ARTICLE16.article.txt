# Medical Center to restructure
## 
### 
A task force appointed by Stanford Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper announced
plans Monday for major organizational
changes in the structure of the Stanford Med
ical Center. The restructuring is meant to
keep the hospital competitive in the changing
health-care marketplace.
"The task force has proposed solutions to
problems that affect Stanford and all other
academic medical centers," Casper said. "A
response now to the changing marketplace is
essential to preserving the academic mission
of the School of Medicine, and that is the num
ber one priority of the task force."
The Presidential Task Force on Strategic
Planning for the Medical Center was appoint
ed last January, just prior to Clinton's an
nouncement of his own national health-care
task force.
Stanford's committee, in an effort to cut
red tape and reduce costs, offered a blueprint
which plans to coordinate all in-patient and
out-patient care at the Stanford Hospital and
other clinics offered by faculty of the school of
Medicine.
"We are creating an entirely new corporate
entity that will be responsible for delivering
all adult care at the Medical Center," said
Isaac Stein, special assistant to the president
and vice chair to Casper on the task force. "It
is designed to break down existing boundaries
and to provide patients with seamless access
to any type of care they may need."
Although the medical school faculty re
ceives more research money per capita than
any other school, Stanford has become in
creasingly dependent upon clinical revenues
as funds from the federal government gradu
ally shrink.
The proposed new system, called the Stan
ford Health System, would seek to continue
adequate financial support for the Stanford
Medical School's top-ranked medical research
and training while cutting costs by streamlin
ing efficiency.
By the end of June, the task force is expect
ed to name members of six working groups
that will each be responsible for implement
ing one part of the blueprint.
