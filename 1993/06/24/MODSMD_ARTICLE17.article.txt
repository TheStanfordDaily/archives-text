# No VTSS CIV for next year
## 
### 
Although they don't know it yet, incom
ing freshman will have one less Cultures,
Ideas and Values (CIV) track option this
fall. As a result of the reorganization of the
Values, Technology, Science and Society
program, that track will not he offered dur
ing the 1992-1993 academic year.
Senior lecturer Barry Katz, who coordi
nates the VTSS track, is on leave from Stan
ford next year, and an appropriate substi
tute can not be secured until the end of fall
quarter, according to Walter Vincenti,
Chair of the VTSS program.
After all efforts to fill Katz's vacated role
failed by the beginning of the fall failed, the
program decided three weeks ago to sus

pend the track for one year, he said.
However, the CIV preference sheets had
already been mailed to incoming freshman,
and the New Student Information Project
— which assigns CIV tracks — was not
aware as of yesterday of the VTSS suspen
sion. One of the Project's employees said
the office was still informing students that
the track is being offered.
Last fall, the VTSS program moved from
the School of Humanities and Sciences to
the School of Engineering. The Engineer
ing School is now "regularizing" VTSS to
reflect the organizational structure of other
engineering departments, Vincenti said.
As part of this process, the VTSS track
will be coordinated by an Associate Profes
sor of Teaching, rather than a lecturer, as it
has been in the past.
However, it will take time to fill the new
Associate Professor position, which re
quires a national search. Vincenti predicted
that a new coordinator will not be in place
until the end of Fall quarter 1993-1994.
With Katz away for a year and no re
placement, "We reluctantly suspended the
course for one year," Vincenti said. He em
phasized that the course would return for
the 1994-1995 academic year.
Katz, a finalist for the new position, said
he favors the creation of a regular faculty
position for the coordinator. "The move was
motivated by an effort to raise the status of
people teaching the course," he said.
Katz will be teaching in the History of
Architecture and Design program at the
California School of Arts and Crafts for one
year during his leave.
According to History Prof. Paul Seaver,
Program Director of CIV,
"Demand for the [VTSS track) has always
been high."

The course — one of the original CIV
tracks — discusses issues of science and
technology throughout human history.
The 135 students who normally would
be placed in VTSS will be absorbed by the
Great Works program, Katz said. Two
VTSS lecturers, Keith Gandal and Renee
Corey, will also join Great Works.
