# Casper sums up year as 'intense'
## 
### 
At a news conference yesterday, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper said he "had
a ball" in his first year in office.
"But as you come home from a ball,"
Casper added waggishly, "you tend to be ex
hausted. You occasionally have a hangover,
and as you know, I sometimes did."
Casper gave the small gathering of re
porters a list of his accomplishments and
policy decisions of the past year, which he
described as "intense and hectic."
In addition, the president fielded an
hour's worth of questions touching on the
most prominent issues of his presidency, in
cluding his attention to multicultural con
cerns and his musings about a three-year
degree.
Casper said that although he was at
tracted to Stanford because of the strength
of its faculty and students, he admitted that
he "underestimated how strong that facul
ty is, and how strong that student body is."
"The campus is very lively. In particular,
the students are very lively," he said. "The

interaction I have had has been incessant."
He called his meetings with students
"forthright — the students do not hide
their views."
But the president defended his record on
multicultural issues, which had come under
attack by student leaders who complained
that Casper shortchanged minority groups
during visits to campus ethnic centers in
May, calling the criticism "much ado about
nothing."
He said some students "with more spe
cific agendas" do not give him enough cred
it for the time he did spend at dorm visits, in
speeches to the ASSU and in informal meet
ings with students. "I've hardly been inac
cessible," he said.
"As far as I'm concerned, I'm as commit
ted as anybody to diversity at Stanford," he
said, pointing to his efforts to restructure
the Office of Multicultural Education and
"make it more effective than it was."
Casper argued that the University
should foster "generally deeper under
standing of civilizations other than Ameri
can civilization." He called knowledge of
foreign civilizations in this country "veiy
superficial — we have a long way to go."
When asked about his much-publicized
suggestion of a three-year plan for under
graduates, Casper reiterated his insistence
that the proposal was originally just "an in
nocuous question" at a meeting with edi
tors of the San Francisco Chronicle and be
came prominent only because the Chronicle
reported his comments on the front page
the next morning.
Casper has said revaluation of the four
year degree will be a part of the comprehen
sive study of undergraduate education he
authorized in April. He said yesterday that
the examination will be the top priority on
his agenda next year.
"You overestimate my role as presi
dent," he said. "All I can do is throw out
ideas, push them, but [decisions on] cur
riculum requirements are handled by the
faculty."
Later, responding to the suggestion that
he wields too much control over the Univer
sity, Casper said "I'm not smart enough to
run the University all by myself. No one can.
"The University is basically wide open,"
he added. "There is nothing happening at
Stanford that is a secret to anybody."
Casper said he is getting "more used to"
the glare of media attention paid to the
president's actions, but "my astonishment
never ends."
"If I get criticized [in the media], that's
fine," he said. "The only time I'm unhappy
is when facts are wrong."
The president said his attentions next
year will be focused primarily on overseeing
implementation of projects he proposed this
year, including the drafting of new sexual
harassment and faculty conflict-of-ihteresl
policies.
He also disclosed that he hopes to teach a
senior seminar on Constitutionalism in the
winter quarter, but allowed that "my calen
dar is already looking forbidding."
Casper seemed unfazed by a recent Daily
poll which showed that 43 percent of Stan
ford students answered "I don't know" or
"no opinion" when asked what the presi
dent's most significant accomplishment
last year was.
"The students come here to study, not to
be concerned with the president of the Uni
versity," he said. "That strikes me as per
fectly rational."
