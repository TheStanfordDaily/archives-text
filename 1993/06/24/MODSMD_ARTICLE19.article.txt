# Sheehan named undergrad czar
## 
### 
History Prof. James Sheehan, an interna
tionally respected scholar in European His
tory, will head the newly formed Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper announced on
June 13.
The commision will conduct a compre-

hensive, year-long exami
nation of undergraduate
education beginning in the
fall. Casper authorized the
creation of the panel in
April.
At a news conference
yesterday, Casper conced
ed that it is "probably un
realistic" to expect the
study to be concluded by

next summer, as he had originally intended.
"I would like the pressure of the deadline
to continue," he said. "But as a question of
prediction, I would have the surprise of my
life if we have the (commission's final) report
by the end of next year."
Casper said the faculty and alumni mem
bers of the commission should be "in place in
a couple of weeks." However, he said it would
be "impossible" to appoint student members
until the beginning of fall quarter.
"We have abandoned hope of convening
in the course of the summer," he said. "The
real drawback is that the students are too
dispersed."
Sheehan is currently conducting two
months of research in Germany. He could
not be reached for comment.
Sheehan, who was presented with a Gores
award for teaching at Commencement exer
cises on June 13, has served as chair of the
Faculty Senate and History Department.
In a statement released after his appoint
ment, Sheehan said the commission will ap
proach the issue of undergraduate education
"in the broadest possible way. We will start
with the assumption that every aspect of the
undergraduate program is suitable for dis
cussion."
He said the commission and its working
groups will draw from a pool of community
members diverse in age, gender, ethnicity
and other characteristics.
Sheehan also added that it will be "virtu
ally impossible" for the commission to
"maintain intellectual cohesion and momen
tum beyond" one year of study.
History Chair David Kennedy said Shee
han is "among the most qualified and suc
cessful teachers in the History Department."
"Coming from a department that prides
itself on teaching, that makes him, in my es
timation, the best of the best," Kennedy said.
Kennedy said Sheehan brings to his new
role "the qualities of commitment to teach
ing and the willingness to hear a lot of sug
gestions and opinions."
"He is deeply committed to undergradu
ate education on all levels," Kennedy said.
"He will guide the commission with a sure
and steady hand."
