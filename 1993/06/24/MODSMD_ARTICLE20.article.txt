# Stanford ranks second in gifts

Stanford's team color may be red, but its
revenues from charitable contributions
should keep it in the black, according to a re
cent report which places the University sec
ond only to Harvard in attracting donations.
According to the report issued by the
Council for Aid to Education, Stanford
pulled in a total of $185,295,259 over the
1991-1992 fiscal year.
John Ford, vice president for develop
ment, said that Stanford's financial position
among the mqjor universities has remained
unchanged over the past three or four years.
"We had a rapid increase due to the Cen
tennial Campaign," Ford said. "We've been
holding that increase through changes in
the Development Office, working with a new
president, and reorganizing our office one
month ago. We've had a nice steady year liv
ing off the momentum of the Campaign."
The University conducted an aggressive
fund-raising campaign to coincide with the
oelebration of the University's 100 th anniver
sary in 1989. The effort concluded last year.

Stephen Peeps, associate vice president
for development, said the continued mo
mentum was surprising. "Traditionally, the
year following a major campaign is miser
able — there is a drop-ofT in both the num
ber and scale of donors," he said. "So expec
tations were that this year would be a recov
ery year."
But even though the Development Of
fice did not try any new and different fund
raising efforts, 94 percent of the goal for
the annual fund was realized by June, with
several months still left to go in the fiscal
year.
"Whether this had to do with a new
president and with the fading of indirect
costs, I'd be leery to say," Peeps said. "I
can't help but intuit that as Stanford is no
longer as publicly on display, some alumni
might be feeling more positively about the
place."
The Council for Aid to Education report,
based on a questionnaire sent to 924 institu
tions, also listed Stanford fourth in total
alumni-giving. Peeps said he is encouraged
by an increase in the number of alumni
donors this year.
Ford added that alumni resources can be
further tapped. "We will place more empha
sis on broadening our base as we come out of
the Campaign and on investments which
will pay off over the long-term," he said.
This includes cultivating the annual
fund, which is used for daily maintenance of
the university rather than the for new con
struction.
Ford added that plans are underway to
increase funding to the Athletic and Earth
Sciences Departments. "We still are coming
forward with capital fund-raising needs, as
President Casper has become more familiar
with Stanford," Ford noted.
Despite the success of the past year, Ford
said the Office of Development will continue
to receive pressure from the academic de
partments.
"At a place like Stanford, there are al
ways expectations that fund-raising rev
enue can grow," he said. "The academic
deans have reviewed where their schools
stood and have been realistic about which
are the things we need to raise money for. If
we can continue to raise money in the same
general area — $ 180 to $200 million a year
— that's something we can be very pleased
with."
