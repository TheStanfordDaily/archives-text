# Freshman falls out of his bed

### 
Freshman Mike Robbing fell from his
second-story window in Branner Hall
early June 6, sustaining broken bones in
his back and hand.
Robbins, a member of the Stanford
baseball team, plummeted from his bed
through an open window, landing on the
cement courtyard approximately 20 feet
below.
"He was on the second bunk on the sec
ond floor," said Stanford Police Sergeant
Del Bandy. "Apparently he rolled over and
rolled right out the window."
Bandy said that the incident was likely
to have been alcohol-related.

Robbins said he does
not remember any of the
events that occurred be
tween going to sleep in his
room and waking up in
the hospital. He said he
was informed of the
events by his parents and
friends.
"It's frustrating and
annoying to have had this

happen to me and not even know exactly
what took place," said Robbins. "I keep
hoping that I'm getting all the right infor
mation, and that people aren't leaving
things out."
Robbins had gone to bed in the inner
room of his Branner quad at about 1 a.m.
Sunday morning, leaving a party in the
outer room and hallway, Branner residents
said.
Nearly an hour after Robbins went to
bed, several people became involved in an
altercation in the courtyard below. The
noise from outside drew the attention of
several Brannerites who then witnessed
Robbins' fall.
Branner residents immediately noti
fied the police and called an ambulance.
Witnesses said Robbins was probably
looking out his window after being awok
en by the noise and lost his balance.
Doctors at the hospital said Robbins
sustained minimal injuries, considering

the size and type of the fall. Two vertebrae
in Robbins' lower back were broken, as
was a small bone in his right hand.
The 19-year-old, left-handed pitcher
from Oakland did not play on the Stanford
team this year after injuring his elbow in
the pre-season. Robbins will wear a back
brace through the summer, but is expect
ed to be able to pitch by winter.
