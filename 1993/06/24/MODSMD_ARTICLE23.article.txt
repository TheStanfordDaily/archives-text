# Trial date set for baseball slugger
## 
### 
Stanford freshman Brodie Van Wage
nen pleaded not guilty June 7 in a Santa
Clara County Superior Court on charges
of felony battery with great bodily in
jury. His trial date is set for July 26.
Van Wajenen, the starting right field
er for the Stanford baseball team, is ac
cused of punching junior Scott Francis
twice in the face without provocation at
a party in Cedro last October.
A source close to the situation dis
closed that the freshman has been sus
pended from attending classes or practic
ing with the team until winter quarter.
The Office of Student Affairs has re
fused to comment on the matter.
At Van Wagenen's preliminary hear
ing on May 28, Judge Rise Jones Pichon
ordered the arraignment on "strong sus
picion" that the crime was committed.
At the time, Santa Clara Supervising
District Attorney Margo Smith said that
Van Wagenen's clean record would likely
keep him out of prison, and that a guilty
verdict would probably only result in
probation and possibly some brief jail
time.
Van Wagenen's attorney, Guy Jinker
son, said Francis' testimony at the hear
ing was "mistaken," and that the trial
would establish Van Wagenen's version
of the facts — namely that the defendant
acted only in self-defense — as true.
Francis testified that the alleged as
sault was unprovoked and that he will
undergo a second surgery to repair his
broken nose.
