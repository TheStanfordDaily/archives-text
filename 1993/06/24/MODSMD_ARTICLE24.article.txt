## Getting up to business Team USA preps for Tourney of the Americas 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Several of the women who were
instrumental in elevating Stan
ford's women's basketball pro
gram to the top of the collegiate
ranks have now set their sights on
the international scene.
Coach Tara VanDerveer is the
head coach of Team USA, a squad
which features former Cardinal
standouts Jennifer Azzi, Katy Ste
ding and Molly Goodenbour. The
team begins round-robin play in
the Tournament of the Americas
on June 26, in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The top four teams in the tour
nament receive bids to the 1994
World Championships. The rest
stay home.
A year ago, "Dream Team Too"
dominated most of its competition
in the Olympics before settling for
a disappointing bronze medal.
Anyone who watched that squad
rip through the majority of the
world might think the U.S. could
defeat the Western Hemisphere
with only half the effort.
Think again. "Of the team that
won the bronze, all those players
are gone; they're not playing any
more," VanDerveer said after a re
cent Team USA exhibition game
at Maples Pavilion.
In other words, it's youth,
youth and nothing but youth.
In addition, former Stanford
great Val Whiting, a two-time Ail-
American, has tentatively "re
tired" from basketball, choosing
instead to pursue a medical ca

reer.
But, while VanDerveer admit
ted that Whiting "would definitely
help (USA Basketball).. . we're
not going into the competition
with one hand tied behind our
backs."
Indeed, the 12 women that
comprise Team USA are an illus
trious group, including two for
mer Players of the Year in Azzi
and Dawn Staley. The squad is
stocked with players from the
dominant collegiate powers of re
cent years — Stanford, Ten
nessee, Virginia and Auburn.
But the question for the Tour
nament of the Americas is, will
talent be enough?
That's where last Saturday's
exhibition game against the
Peninsula All-Stars fits in.
The All-Stars are a group of
local men assembled for the ex
press purpose of challenging the
national team in scrimmages, to
hone the team's skills and acceler
ate the "meshing" process.
Composed of men whose pro
fessions run from sales managers
to tennis instructors to history
teachers, the All-Stars dominated
the women on Saturday, winning
86-72.
The game followed three previ
ous scrimmages between the two
squads, all at Menlo College,
where the women have been prac
ticing.
"They bombed us the first
night," said VanDerveer. "We got
better the second night and better
the third night." VanDerveer said

that the All-Stars played better in
the exhibition than they had earli
er in the week.
She chalked that up to Golden
State Warriors coach Don Nel
son's presence on the All-Stars
bench as a "celebrity coach." Nel
son also happens to be Van-
Derveer's male analog, as he is the
head coach of the men's national
team.
The women acknowledged that
the men were simply in another
class physically. Speed, strength
and jumping ability were the keys
to the contest's outcome.
But so was lack of execution on
the women's part. The game fea
tured a slew of bobbled passes and
blown lay-ups. The women looked
out of sync all night, especially in
their half-cour* set.
They were most effective offen
sively when Goodenbour was
pushing the tempo to helter-skel
ter levels. In transition the women
utilized their greater fundamental
skills and got good looks at the
basket.
Goodenbour was one of the
most impressive performers on
the night. The only woman able to
hit outside shots, she nailed three
of-six three pointers and grabbed
four rebounds in only 19 minutes
of play. VanDerveer said that if
she had to choose a starting point
guard based on the exhibition
game, she would pick Gooden
bour.
"I'm kind of shocked I'm saying
this," VanDerveer said. "Some of
it is Molly just being comfortable
with (my) system. But I thought
Molly did our best job at point. Six
assists and one turnover and she
hit her outside shot — against
those men. You can't ask for much
more than that."
VanDerveer filled out her ex
tremely tentative lineup projec
tions with "a toss-up" at shooting
guard between Azzi and Ruthie
Bolton; Lisa Leslie at small for
ward; Car la McGhee at power for
ward; and Heather Burge at center.
The 6-5 Burge proved to be the
team's best post-up scorer, tally
ing a game-high 23 points on 10-
of-14 shooting in 19 minutes of
play.
Like most of the team, neither
Azzi nor Steding could find a
rhythm offensively, and Steding, a
forward, had some difficulty stay
ing with her defensive assign

ment's quick drives.
Defensively, the women were
most successful when using a 2-3
zone first installed by VanDerveer
earlier in the day. The women
were able to stuff the paint and
shut down the All-Stars' offense
late in the first half using the
zone.
In general, when the women
sagged off the perimeter to stop
drives and inside passes, they
seemed most effective. Successful
defensive series allowed the
women to get out running, which

in turn improved their offensive
effectiveness.
They used this strategy to rally
to within three points in the mid
dle of the second half, but sudden
ly the men started hitting their
jumpers, including several three
pointers, and soon the All-Stars
had scored 16 unanswered points
in a three-minute stretch to put
the game away.
"This just shows that we have a
lot of work to do to get ready for
the tournament," VanDerveer
said of the exhibition.

during a recent scrimmage. USA Women's Basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer said that rebounding was a skill the squad needed to im
prove for the World Championship Qualifying Tournament in Brazil,
