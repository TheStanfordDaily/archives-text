# Azzi, Steding return to hoops, American style

Don Nelson just couldn't compete with
Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding.
Although on the court Nelson and the
Peninsula All-Stars cruised past the U.S.
Women's National Team in Saturday's ex
hibition game, the popular coach of the
Golden State Warriors was easily overshad
owed in pre-game introductions by the two
1990 Stanford graduates and ex-Cardinal
stars.
"It's neat having the kind of reception
we got," Steding said of the sustained, half
standing ovation that she, Azzi, 1993 grad
Molly Goodenbour and coach Tara Van-
Derveer received from the crowd of 3,241 at
Maples Pavilion. "That's really special. It's
nice that people think so well of you after
three years."
In 1990, Azzi and Steding led the under
dog Stanford Cardinal to its first ever
women's basketball national champi
onship. Since then, another NCAA trophy
has joined the first and Stanford is no
longer an upset-maker but, as a perennial
national power, the occasional victim of
one.
As Stanford has helped build its reputa

tion on their accomplishments, Azzi and
Steding have been playing professionally in
Europe and Japan, respectively, gaining
new perspectives on women's basketball in
other countries.
Steding said the teams in her league
don't compare to World Championship
qualifying squads. "It's like playing

against high school play
ers versus professionals,"
she said. "The talent in
Japan in pretty much
nonexistent. Basketball in
Japan is very helter-skel
ter, all over the place.
There's a lot of three
point shooting and a lot of
running, quite often a lot
of running with no real
purpose in mind."

Azzi also noticed differences between
the American collegiate and national-team
style of play and that of the Italian and
French leagues in which she's competed.
"I score a lot more overseas and I'm ex
pected to — and that's it," Azzi explained.
"It has been kind of weird, but good, to be
on the court with four other Americans
who can score.
"At the same time, sometimes it's tough

to know exactly what to do," she said. "I
haven't been in a system like this for three
years. I feel kind of tentative sometimes
when I'm playing, with the exception of de
fense. Offensively, its more structured and
I'm not used to that."
Readjusting to a complex offensive sys
tem that emphasizes running, quick pass-

ing and outside shooting is
not the only difficulty
faced by players returning
from overseas competi
tion. Merely maintaining
skills is not easy when op
ponents don't give you a
good game.
"(The teams] are very
average. Below average,"
VanDerveer said. "Be-

cause of the systems, [American athletes)
don't improve that much. They play on
these teams with one other American and
they're expected to get the ball and go to the
basket every single time.
"You can't do that against these guys,"
said VanDerveer, referring to the national
squads aiming for the World Champi
onships — Canada, Cuba and Brazil —
whom she expects to be quicker and more
physical than teams in European or Japan

ese leagues. "So something that has worked
for them the last three years all of a sudden
doesn't work."
But American players can reap a few
benefits from subpar competition. "Be
cause the competition is really lacking over
there, I've been able to try out a lot of new
things," Steding said. "I've become a lot
more mobile as a player and I feel more
comfortable driving to the basket than I did
at Stanford."
But there are still adjustments to be
made, as Steding and Azzi's performances
on Saturday indicated. The all-male
Peninsula team held both ex-Cardinal
players to O-for-3 shooting and a total of
four assists.
"Honestly I don't think this was an indi
cation of how good they are," said Van-
Derveer, citing the post-Olympic year let
down as a reason for the unspectacular
showing. Azzi and Steding were two of the
last three players cut from the 1992 U.S.
Olympic team which finished a disappoint
ing third in Barcelona.
"They really put a lot of time and effort
into last year and now you have to regroup
to go up again for '96," VanDerveer said. "I
don t see them being on top of their game,
either one of them, right now."
