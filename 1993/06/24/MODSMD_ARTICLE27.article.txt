## Head to Head Spielberg and Schwarzenegger battle for box office supremacy 
### Ed Yoon Staff writer 
Now that even members of lost
Amazonian tribes realize that
"Jurassic Park" will whip "Last Ac
tion Hero" at the box office, it's time to
come to grips with the reasons why. First
off, "Jurassic Park" features a Tyran
nosaurus Rex performing a hemicorpecto
my on a lawyer. If that isn't catharsis, I
don't know what is.
Though "Last Action Hero" doesn't
boast such a scene, it's quite similar to
"Jurassic Park." Both movies have plastic
mugs that you can get from hamburger
shops. Both feature annoying kids in cru
cial roles, namely to suck enormous
amounts of money from the gold mine

that is the kiddie mar
ket. Both try to invade J

your sanity and pri-

vacy with dis
turbingly per
vasive public

relations
campaigns.
And both

required
budgets

that
could

defray the cost of an F-16 or two

Now that we've hit these most impor
tant similarities, let's consider some less
significant matters: theme, plot and char
acter.

The appeal of "Jurassic Park" is quite

basic. "We want to see dinosaurs
eat people," says the cheerful
American audience. "And we want
to see Spielberg pull it off so we

can hear our jaws drop in unison." We
don't really care about developing sensi-

tive dinosaurs that shc>v character devel
opment or say something about the nature
of knowledge. We want cool special effects
and humans-in-jeopardy.
There's a theme in "Jurassic Park" —
it's that science doesn't always help
things. This becomes most trenchant
when the cunning, vicious dinosaurs fig
ure out how to open doors and behave
like well-trained West Point graduates.
You can imagine the dinosaurs whipping
out maps, walkie-talkies and compasses
to plan their next attack on the hapless
humans, who on the whole don't seem

worth saving.
The plot,

a throwback to
King Kong and
lizard films of

decades ago, re
volves around di
nosaurs getting resur-

rected by the
magic of molecular
biology and threat-

ening a group of scientists
and two kids that someone

made the mistake of

bringing along.

Very basic.
"Jurassic

Park" does succeed at its most
important task: it showcases
some amazing special effects that

required two years of inhuman
computer/puppet/techno innova-

tion which you probably don't want to
hear about. If you subtracted the humans
from the movie, it's doubtful ticket sales
would suffer much — the characters and
the story certainly wouldn't.
As for "Last Action Hero," now known

as "Last Place Action Hero," crit
ics have been salivating at the

chance to wield their
1 . • _ 1 1 •

rhetorical whips on
Arnold, and it's

an S&M orgy
out there. Not

a pretty
sight.

Like
"Jurassic
Park,"
the movie

tries to at
tract the
kids by

showcasing a
boy who goes

eyeball-to-eyeball

with a being that doesn't

exist. Danny, a pre-pubescent action
movie addict, gets a free magic ticket to
see his hero Jack Slater blow up some
more bad guys in his latest movie, bril
liantly titled "Jack Slater IV." The ticket
sucks him into Slater's fictional world,
which follows the unwritten rules of all
action films: the hero doesn't get hurt, the
bad guy loses and the lieutenant is black,
angry and always gets on Slater's case.
Unfortunately, the movie bad guy —
who wears an artificial eye with a happy
face inscribed on it — gets hold of the
magic ticket and travels back to the real

world. Slater and Danny try to
nab him before he capitalizes

on the fact that evil goes
unpunished in

Danny's "real"
world
Like the

dinosaurs of "Jurassic Park,"
Arnold is big, mean and
dispatches humans with

cold
dis-

inter
est. The

dinosaurs,
however, don't try
to show false emo
tion and drip vul
nerability — as

reptiles, they
don't have

gray matter

to waste on
that sort of
stuff.

Arnold ap
pare n 11 y
thinks he does,

and this ulti
mately dooms
the film as it
wastes time
with schmaltzy
i scenes of
Arnold be
f moaning his
fictionality and
sniffling about

his inability to stop

killing people, turning
"Last Action Hero" into
an unfocused stew that
could have been innovative

and fresh.
A theme in "Last Action Hero" — one
of many that the movie screws up — is
that action movies follow conventions.
Unfortunately, this fertile ground goes
unplowed, replaced with prosaic scenes
of exploding cars and large-bore
firearms.
So while it tries to satirize the action
movie genre, the film slavishly follows the
formula. Are we watching an action movie
trying to take itself seriously as an action
movie, or a big send-up? The film can't de
cide, leaving us ready to kick our own butts
over the wasted $7.
When the film actually satirizes action
movie conventions and pokes fun at the
movie-within-a-movie, the results are
fresh and full of laughs.
Arnold plays Hamlet as a decisive,
vengeful cigar-smoking Prince of Den
mark "who's taking out the trash." The
bodacious blond heroine, wearing a
skimpy outfit that's five sizes too small,
yells to the heroes to "put on some
clothes." The exasperated boy hero says
that there are no ugly women in Slater's
world, even in video rental stores, which
proves that Slater lives in a celluloid
world.
Unfortunately these are mere snippets
in a film that tries to be a rip-roaring ride,
a father-son team- up, a satire and a come
dy. As the saying goes, too many screen
writers screw up the movie.
So it's true: Arnold, that unstoppable
Aryan terminator, has finally been termi
nated, at the hands of a nebbish, no less.
Indeed, Spielberg was so sure that "Jurassic
Park" was going to smash "Last Action
Hero" into a bloody pulp that he took off
for his next project and left the editing to
his pal, George Lucas.
Blame it on Barney, Arnie. ■
