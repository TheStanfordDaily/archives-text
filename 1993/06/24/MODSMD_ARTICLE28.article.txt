## Chains of love What's Love Got To Do With It? 
### 
After watching two hours of Tina
Turner being terrorized, beaten and
raped — yet managing to survive and
somehow revitalize her failed singing ca
reer — we've got no choice but to agree
with her: love had much less to do with it
than an ability to take a licking and keep
on ticking.
The film "What's Love Got To Do With
It?" based on the autobiography "I, Tina,"
stars "Boyz 'N The Hood" 's Angela Bassett
and Laurence Fishburne as Tina and Ike
Turner. Born Anna Mae Bullock in Nut
bush, Tenn., her mother moves to St. Louis,
leaving Tina in the care of her grandmoth
er. So, at an early age, Tina learns to pour
her pain into her increasingly powerful
singing voice.
After her grandmother dies, the teenage
Tina moves in with her mother, immedi
ately taking to St. Louis' night life. There,
she meets the suavely seductive Ike Turner
and his Kings of Rhythm. Impressed with
this woman who "sings like a man," Ike
starts touring with Tina, finding success
beyond their wildest dreams. But when
Tina's star begins to eclipse his, Ike's co
caine-fueled jealousy begins to take a pub
licly brutal toll on our favorite private
dancer.
This story — the abused diva finding the
strength to escape her Svengali — has been
told so often that it's almost archetypal.
Screenwriter Kate Lanier adds nothing to
the genre, racing breathlessly from one high
point to another. Lanier's structure, which
consists of counterpointing moments in
Tina's life with musical numbers, isn't styl
ized or thought through enough to help us
understand what made Tina the woman she
is today.
Director Brian Gibson doesn't seem to
have much insight into Tina either. Most of
the scenes of Ike's abuse are edited in a se
ries of rapid cuts that would be better suit
ed for a music video. Only when Gibson
films Ike's violent outbursts in long takes do
we really get a visceral feeling of what Tina
had to endure.
Fortunately, Bassett's and Fishburne's
performances make up for the inadequate
writing and direction. In the early scenes,
Bassett seems content to imitate Tina's
trademark herky-jerk performing style. But
she warms up as the film goes on, imbuing
each performance with more and more en
ergy, willing us to believe that this is what
Tina was like.
Offstage, her character is sketchily writ
ten, which allows Fishburne to walk away
with the rest of the film. He plays Ike with
the deceptive cool of "Mo' Better Blues" '
Shadow Henderson and the edgy volatility
of "Raging Bull" 's Jake LaMotta. A master
manipulator, he uses violence as one of
many means to persuade Tina to do as he
says. When an almost hoarse Tina can't find
the strength to sing, he looks at her coldly,
then leans over and kisses her on the cheek.
It doesn't take her long to start singing after
that.
A Disney production, the film has strong
overtones of "Beauty and the Beast." Ike
doesn't want to hurt Tina, but he's so con
vinced that his way is right that he can't
help himself.
There's a deeply rooted hurt in Ike that
the screenplay doesn't successfully ex
plain, but Fishburne finds it and builds a

monstrously human performance
around it.
The filmmakers, in their attempt to can
onize Tina, have unintentionally raised Ike
Turner from the graveyard of history. To
wards the end of the film, he points at his
head and tells her, "You can't get away from
me. I'm in here." He stays in our heads too,
haunting our minds long after he's left the
screen. Love may not have had much to do
with Tina's stardom, but Ike, it seems, cer
tainly did.
