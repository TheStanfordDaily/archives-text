# A 						Jewish persona
## Sofie 
### 
In the midst of a summer full of fast
paced action flicks, "Sofie," directed by
Ingmar Bergman veteran Liv Ullmann,
proves somewhat of a relief from hours of
mindless sex and violence. The film re
quires concentration; it won't sink in all
at once, and it definitely doesn't cater to
the escapist mind.
For those who don't enjoy turn-of-the
century art, the movie might provoke a

chorus of yawns. Yet the film proves to be
endearing, because its finely portrayed
characters elicit and maintain the audi
ence's interest.
Sofie Philipsen (Karen-Lise Mynster) is a
28-year-old unmarried Jewish woman liv
ing in late 19th-century Denmark. An only
child, she's devoted to her parents and their
benevolent but old-fashioned wishes. Her
parents are anxious to see her married — as
they see it, time is running out. Yet despite
her beauty and intelligence, the shy Sofie
doesn't have any suitors.
Enter Hans Hojby (Jesper Chris
tensen), a blond-haired gentile painter
who meets Sofie and her parents at a
party. He sweeps Sofie off her feet, and
later wins over mom and dad with a
charming oil-painting of them. After a
few encounters, Hans seems the appropri
ate match for Sofie, but the parents won't
break with tradition: Their son-in-law
must be Jewish. Respecting her parent's
wishes at all costs, Sofie buries her pas
sion.
The movie abounds in familiarities,
but Ullmann isn't trying to reveal any
original insight into human existence.
Instead, "Sofie" works like a tour
through a museum in which all the paint

ings are connected through narrative. The
cinematography reinforces this style:
Many shots are "framed"; the camera
often lingers on a single, poised image
which we study just like a picture.
Ullmann's innovative technique saves
the film from potential banality — our in
terest in the images she creates enhances
our relationship to the story.
We keep watching to see if "Sofie" cor
roborates our interpretations of its artistry.
As a result, Sofie's life takes on a greater
meaning: We no longer think of her as a
mere victim of traditional restraints, and
care about her all the more.
The film is a psychological drama — a
work full of symbols and key phrases that
force us into our "intellectual mode." For
tunately, however, the movie's philosophy
avoids pretension.
As we experience "Sofie," we experi
ence a slice of life, where each sound and
movement seamlessly interrelate.
The movie, like a tapestry too big for
its wall, runs the risk of going on too
long at times, but as an honest, con
templative story replete with striking
pictures, "Sofie" ranks among the win
ners.
