## Editorial Editor's welcome As temperatures rise, we'll be your thermometer 
### 
NO, STANFORD ISN'T
the kind of school
where MTV sends Ed
Lover for Spring Break. It's a
quiet, homey place, like May
berry or Grover's Corner. And
in the summer, it gets even
quieter and homier.
Some might argue it's too
quiet. In fact, Stanford in the
summer tends to be not whol
ly dissimilar to a cemetery.
It's quiet, people dress better,
the grounds are well kept and
everyone seems to visit their
own little plot and head
straight home. You can al
most smell the wisteria.
But no matter how quiet
the campus may seem, we're
not Martha Stewart and this
isn't a quilting bee. Stanford
is a research Mecca and a har
binger of social change, and
just because the students
leave, the temperature climbs
through the roof and those of
us in summer housing don't
have air conditioning, our
mission at The Stanford
Weekly (with a capital "T")
hasn't changed. Rather, the
silence makes our job more
important.
The Weekly is, in many
ways, the only element which
holds this campus together
during the summer session.
The subtle modes of com
munication that exist during
the year — between students
groups, between faculty and
students and between the ad
ministration and the student
body — dissipate when the
temperature rises above 80
degrees. Because no one talks
to each other at deGuerre. I
blame it on the racing lanes.
Our task is not a simple

one. With an even more di
verse population than the
campus normally boasts —
high school students, busi
ness conventioneers and, yes,
cheerleaders — our job of
bridging this melting pot and
mixing our metaphors is
tougher than usual.
Over the next nine weeks,
we hope to print stories that
will illuminate these facets of
the summer community with
out alienating anyone with
fancy jargon or color photog
raphy.
The opportunities avail
able at Stanford over the sum
mer are extraordinary. With
out the weight of 12,000 stu
dents, administrators and fac
ulty members have more time
for self-examination and plan
ning. Students have more
time to investigate parts of
the university that they
wouldn't normally see. Let
The Weekly be your guide.
If we are to be blamed for
anything this summer I hope
it will be sensationalism
rather than drudgery.
If we err on the side of mak
ing Stanford in the summer
seem like a more exciting
place than it really is, then let
this be your warning label.
And if we can actually con
tribute to making this place
more of a community — and
do it without throwing big, an
noying potluck dinners every
Friday — then I will be proud
of our accomplishment.
It's a big campus and we're
but a small newspaper, but we
hope to make this place feel a
little closer and a little more
cohesive than it would other
wise be. Makes you want to
hug the guy sitting next to
you. Go ahead. We'll wait.
