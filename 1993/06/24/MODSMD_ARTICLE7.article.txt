## A 						place for my stuff 
### 
I ALWAYS IMAGINED that my
first apartment would be a
gorgeously renovated studio
somewhere on the Left Bank or
the Upper East Side, where I'd be
surrounded by poets and dancers
and liveried servants.
Convinced of some inalienable,
Woolf-ian right to a rm w/ a vu of my
own, and secure in my unique im
munity to common loneliness, I set
out recently to find summer hous
ing. By the time I realized that my
dream apartment, if it existed, ex
isted in a world well beyond my
price range, my standards had fall
en irretrievably, dragging my spirits
down with them.
Raised on such fantastic cultural
paradigms of apartment life as
"Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "Mel
rose Place," I was in no way pre
pared for Stanford's low-budget
best: an airless, soulless single min
imalistically furnished in avocado
vinyl and a "futon" improvised from
an old mattress.
Where was the carefree insou
ciance? The smoldering intensity of
close quarters? The mechanically
inclined hunk-next-door?
I don't know my neighbors — I
don't even see them. That's the
point, I told myself, as visions of
four ex-roommates danced in my
head.
Of course, solitude has its re

wards. I've plenty of peace and quiet
in which to appreciate all the subtle
charms of this place — charms I
didn't notice when I did the obliga
tory look-see, that faint aroma of as
bestos in particular.
I'm also at leisure to ponder life's
eternal questions, such as: What if
my fingers accidentally get caught
in my new garbage disposal and I
can't dial 911? Where can I buy just
one fork? How did The Chronicle's
subscription office get my new
phone number? and Why are they
called apartments if they're so close
together?
It is now Day Six of the "Home
Alone" sequel that is my life and de
spite the constant threat of catbur
glars, my biggest fear is that, with
no one around to impress or even
keep up appearances for, I'll fall into
such deviant habits as eating Ben
and Jerry's Cherry Garcia Frozen
Yogurt straight from the carton and
walking around in the nude. Or
both.
But I have other fears as well —
fears that don't involve a full-length
mirror. What if I can't handle it?
What if I've been confusing indepen
dence with arrogance? What if people
really do need people?
Rather than living on my own, I
find myself shacked up with count
less doubts and insecurities and no
authority figure to provide the an

swers or take the blame.
It would be oh-so-easy to pack up
and head home to my king-sized
bed, my cable TV and my parents'
unconditional, everlasting love. But
I won't, and the reason has nothing
to do with leases or nonrefundable
deposits.
It's about my stuff. It's hum
bling to discover that 20 years of
conspicuous consumption hardly
yields enough loot to furnish a one
bedroom apartment. In fact, the
place looks pretty bare.
With a bigger, emptier emotional
space to fill — devoid of reassuring
relations, neurotic roommates and
the familiar comforts of home and
routine — I've realized just how in
adequate my own psychic furniture
is.
I was snug and comfortable in
my small, safe college-dorm envi
ronment. But now I can't help see
ing that there's room to grow —
fears to be banished, doubts to be
overcome. And I'm not leaving this
apartment until I outgrow it alto
gether.
Or until my lease is up.
