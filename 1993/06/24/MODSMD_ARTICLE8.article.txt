## Campus still thin on diversity 
### 
IN EVALUATING CAMPUS
diversity, we have reached the
conclusion that, despite appar
ent efforts by the administration,
the campus population remains in
many ways quite homogeneous.
We observe that many deserving
groups remain underrepresented
at Stanford.
For instance, it appears to us
that there are disproportionately
low numbers of obese individuals
in the student population relative
to the population at large. Is this
simply coincidence, or does Stan
ford exemplify the less-than-equal
treatment obese persons receive
in our society?
Though our discussion identi
fied many groups that continue to
lack representation, one op
pressed group in particular stood
out as especially underrepresent

ed. We refer to this group as the
intellectually and motivationally
challenged.
In our dealings with other
students at Stanford, almost
without exception, we have en
countered articulate, motivated
and intelligent people. We be
lieve that, despite Stanford's
laudable efforts at achieving di
versity, this institution remains
a haven for the intellectual elite
of our society. We are certain
that admissions records will sup
port our hypothesis and prove
that students admitted to Stan
ford score disproportionately
high on the SAT and come from
the GPA elite of their respective
high schools.
Is this group representative of
the society we live in today? We
think not. Our own experiences
have taught us that the world
around us is a world of diverse
levels of competence and motiva
tion, very unlike the elitist den of
achievement we see at Stanford.

How will students learn to under
stand and appreciate those less
skilled individuals they must
work and live with after they
leave the insulated confines of
Stanford?
The intellectually and motiva
tionally challenged are an histori
cally oppressed group. For cen
turies, this group has been exclud
ed from the upper reaches of our
society. Achievers are granted
preference in almost every pursuit
in life. Even the modest inroads
that the less competent have made
into government bureaucracies or
middle-management jobs in large
companies are now threatened by
budget deficits and corporate
down sizing.
Right or wrong, a Stanford
degree is a passport to accom
plishment in our country. Is it
fair that one group of individu
als who were fortunate enough
to be bestowed with superior
talent and motivation receive
this benefit while others born

less fortunate are denied it? In
fact, it is the less competent
who truly need and deserve this
benefit. The high achievers will
always find pathways to suc
cess.
We urge the Stanford adminis
tration to act immediately to
modify its admissions policy to
correct this inequity and begin to
actively target intellectually and
motivationally challenged stu
dents. We expect to see a repre
sentative decrease in average
SAT scores and GPAs, as well as
fewer students who were in
volved in high school extracurric
ular activities. We also suggest
admitting students who turn in
late or incomplete applications as
an effective means of targeting
this group.
