# Commencement '93 OUT WITH A SPLASH
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Editorial staff 
Stanford's 102 nd Commencement was a
"day of beginnings and endings" for the
Class of '93, in the words of Floyd Thomp
kins, associate dean of the chapel. And like
previous ceremonies, it was also a day of
beach balls, water slides, inflatable sex toys
and grateful cheers for "Mom and Dad."
Some set up a home made "Slip 'n'
Slide," made from smuggled plastic
garbage bags and gallon jugs of soapy
water. Others played Twister, engaged in a
life-size game of Tic-Tac-Toe or indulged in
one last game of Frisbee. Still others
proudly displayed the lack of clothes worn
under the rented black gowns.
The 4,000 or so graduates — some wear
ing Rollerblades, basketball-hoop adorned
hats or feather boas — also cheered former
University President Donald Kennedy,
University President Gerhard Casper and
Senator Dianne Feinstein as the three
greeted the crowd surrounding the stage.
In his first Commencement speech
since coming to Stanford, Casper cited a fa
vorite "Peanuts" cartoon, asking, "On the
cruise ship of life... which way is your deck
chair facing?"
He congratulated the class of '93 "for
having so successfully unfolded your deck
chairs" while at Stanford. "Unfolding deck
chairs is a challenge for all of us, as I can
testify," he added.
Casper introduced Feinstein, who grad
uated from Stanford in 1955, as part of "a
distinguished tradition at Stanford — that
of high-level government service." He
noted that five U.S. senators, 12 represen
tatives and three Supreme Court justices
hold Stanford degrees.
Feinstein reminisced about her first
Stanford Commencement, admitting that
she couldn't remember who the speaker had
been."I suspect that over time you won't re
member either who gave that last lecture
before getting your diploma," she laughed.

But she did recall the injustices she and
her classmates faced and often embraced.
"When I graduated, no one had heard of
the environmental movement. Commu
nism was an implacable foe. Racial segre
gation was legal and accepted — in private
clubs and private lives. Gay and lesbian
students, even on this enlightened cam
pus, had to hide their identities."
Many students in her graduating class
could have been mayor of San Francisco,
Feinstein said. "My classmates only won
dered who he might be."
Before delivering a long, inspirational
quote from country singer Garth Brooks,
Feinstein urged students to become in
volved in the pressing issues that face the
country.
"From Stanford to the U.S. Senate, the
defining issue is fundamentally the same,"
she said. "You were not educated and we
were not elected in order to preside over
the downsizing of the American Dream."
Feinstein's address was followed by
tributes to outgoing Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas and outgoing
Provost Gerald Lieberman. Casper wel
comed incoming Dean John Shover and
Provost Condoleezza Rice and announced
the designation of an endowment in
Lieberman's name, which will finance nine
one-year, $20,000 graduate fellowships.
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel awards for out
standing service to undergraduate educa
tion were presented to faculty members
Charles H. Baxter, P.J. Ivanhoe and Her
ant Katchadourian and graduates Charles
Hokanson and Tamara Watts.
James Sheehan, Kathleen Namphy and
Susan Marie Dever received Walter J.
Gores awards for excellence in teaching.
Alan Grundmann, administrative direc
tor of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve,
and Ann Elizabeth Rafferty, an undergrad
uate assistant in Political Science were
awarded Kenneth M. Cuthbertson awards
for outstanding contributions to the goals
of the University.
