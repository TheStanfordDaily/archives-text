# Gould named head of NLRB
## 
### 
Law Prof. William Gould IV has been se
lected to head the National Labor Relations
Board, a White House official announced
Monday.
The 56-year old Gould has taught at
Stanford since 1972. He has participated as
an arbitrator in labor-management dis
putes since 1965 and is one of the country's
foremost commentators on the relationship
between workers and business.
"William Gould has a tremendous

amount of both practical
and scholarly experience in
labor law," President Clin
ton said in a statement an
nouncing Gould's nomina
tion.
"[He] stands for the prin
ciples I want the NLRB to
uphold — the rights of all
workers to participate in
labor organizations, and

the need for labor and management to work
together to increase our nation's competi
tiveness in a global marketplace."
Gould said he is "honored President
Clinton has expressed his intent to nomi
nate me, and if the Senate confirms me, I
will do the best job I can."
"This is an exciting challenge," he said.
"I am looking forward to it."
Gould said the President hopes his Sen
ate confirmation hearings will be concluded
before the legislature recesses in August.
If confirmed by the Senate, Gould will be
come the first black American to head the
NLRB, which has been in existence since
1935. The board oversees elections about
whether or not workers want to be represent
ed by labor organizations and determines the
fairness of actions by labor and management.
Gould, a member of the National Acade
my of Arbitrators, has arbitrated more than
200 public and private management-labor
disputes, including cases in 1992 involving
the salaries of Major League baseball play
ers.
The nominee has written five books on
labor relations, tackling issues such as
racial discrimination in the workplace and
the implications of Japanese competition
on American productivity. His latest book,
"Agenda For Reform: The Future of Em
ployment Relationships and the Law," is to
be published this week.
Gould has been an active critic of U.S.

labor law and a champion of workers'
rights, but encourages cooperation between
labor and management.
Some business groups have expressed
reservations about Gould's impartiality,
claiming his writings lean more heavily to
wards the support of labor.
"I've worked with both labor and man
agement since the 605," Gould said. "I ex
pect that in Washington I will continue to
be an impartial go-between, acceptable to
both sides."
In March, Clinton appointed Gould to
the Commission for the Future of Worker-
Management Relations, a panel created to
examine the future of American competi
tiveness in the workplace.
Gould also served as labor law adviser to
Robert Kennedy during the 1968 presiden
tial campaign and has written frequently on
labor law and politics in South Africa.
