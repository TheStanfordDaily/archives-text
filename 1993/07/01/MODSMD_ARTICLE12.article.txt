# Students join S.F. gay march
## 
### 
Although the Stanford gay, lesbian, and
bisexual community was not one of the 240
groups that marched in Sunday's
Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade in San
Francisco, many Stanford students stood
among the thousands of spectators along
Market Street and cheered the paraders on.
The largest event of its kind in the world,
the parade commemorates the birth of the
modern gay rights movement in America,
which took place during the riots that fol
lowed a police raid of the Stonewall, a gay bar
in New York City, in June 1969.
Some students who attended Sunday's pa
rade said they were somewhat disappointed

by the absence of a Stanford contingent, al
though they recognized the difficulty of orga
nizing a group during the summer when
most students are off campus.
Senior Kenn Dunn said one of the most
striking things about the parade for him was
the Stanford community's absence, though
many student and alumni groups from Uni
versity of California campuses and other area
colleges did participate.
However, Rosa de la Vega, a senior, said
she felt it "wasn't so important to have a
Stanford-labeled contingent at the parade, as
it was just to go and see it as individuals. Per
sonally speaking, it was much better to get to
watch it all than to march in it myself."
A Feminist Studies mqjor who will be a
staffer at Stanford's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
Community Center next year, de la Vega felt
that Stanford's participation in Sunday's pa
rade in San Francisco was less important
than its participation in last April's gay, les
bian, and bisexual march on Washington.
"When we went to Washington," she said,
"we wanted to go as a group to show everyone
that even a conservative institution like
Stanford has a gay community."
De la Vega said that Stanford did have a
very "large and successful" contingent at the
event two years ago, but that the timing of
the parade makes it difficult to organize a
strong contingent year after year.
Despite Stanford's non-participation, stu
dents who attended the parade felt that it was
an important demonstration of the gay, les
bian, and bisexual community's size and di
versity.
As senior Jason Menayan said, "[One]
good thing about the parade is that it shows
that gay people run the gamut, from gender
bending drag queens to people who you 'can't
te11'.... If the straight community can accept
mainstream-looking gays, why can't it accept
all gays?"
Dunn said, "Visibility is one of the corner
stones of the gay movement. Not only I, but
many others feel that the closet is a very op
pressive and depressing place to be.
Several prominent figures in the queer
community, including Keith Meinhold, the
Stanford-area naval officer who came out of
the closet on national television, and Roberta
Achtenberg, a lesbian undersecretary in the
Department of Housing and Urban Develop
ment, also participated.
These individuals, having come into the
public spotlight only recently, highlight the
political progress that the queer community
has made in what has been called the "Year of
the Queer."
"Being gay is a difficult thing," Menayan
said. But events like last week's parade serve
to remind him "that there is a large group out
there that takes pride in itself and that there
are gay people in every sector of society."
