# Profs wary of mail bombing
## 
### 
An air of caution settled upon the Stanford
campus this week, after recent mail bombings
critically injured two professors at prominent
universities.
An electronic mail message sent to the
Stanford network last Friday by Chief Marvin
Herrington of Stanford Police read that "we
have no reason to believe Stanford is in any
danger" but asked all faculty to set aside any
suspicious packages and have them X-rayed
before opening them.
Sgt. Rick Enberg, the resident bomb tech
nician who handles all calls involving suspi
cious packages, received about 10 calls, all of
them turning up nothing.
"I'm not worried, but I'm always con
cerned," said Enberg, "Each (call) is the real
thing until we prove otherwise."
Last week a geneticist at UC-San Francis
co and a computer science professor at Yale
University were injured in two mail bombing
incidents. Police believe the mail bombings
were the work of the same person or group
that has also been responsible for 12 previous
mail bombings at universities and high-tech
nology companies since 1978.
Prof. Jeff Ullman, chair of Stanford's
Computer Science Department, said that the
bombings have inspired more caution, but
certainly not panic, among staff and faculty
members.
"People don't seem to be too con
cerned. .. . but I'm cautious. I called my wife
(just after the incidents were reported) and
told her to be careful," said Ullman. Ullman
distributed notices throughout his depart
ment warning people what a possible mail
bomb could look like.
An administrative aide at the Medical Cen
ter said that a memo from the FBI Bomb Data
Center was sent to relevant places all over
campus.
The memo lists 15 different characteristics
of a possible mail bomb, including excessive
postage and weight, incorrect titles with no
names, a lopsided or uneven envelope, pro
truding wires and oily stains or discolorations.
A faculty member in the School of Medi
cine, who wished to remain anonymous for
fear of risking unwanted attention from those
responsible for the bombings, said that many
people were quite disturbed by the mail bomb
ings. "The FBl's nervous about it; everybody
is very nervous about it.... People around
here who have anything to do with genetic re
search are just scared," he said.
The Stanford post off oe is also taking extra

precautions and has received information
from the FBI on what types of packages for
which to look for. Jim Ruiz, acting station
manager at the past office, said that he has
alerted the clerks and carriers who handle the
mail to look closely at certain packages, espe
cially large, yellow, padded envelopes.
"We don't take this lightly," said Ruiz. "I
heard that the carriers who delivered (the pre
vious mail bombs) didn't even notice anything
wrong with them. That's the scary part."
