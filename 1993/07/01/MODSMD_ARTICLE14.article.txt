# Med Center to treat students?
## 
### 
The Medical Center, in an effort to pre
serve its world-class health care in a constant
ly changing field, is headed towards signifi
cant changes that may affect how Stanford
students receive higher-level medical care.
Although the details are still being worked
out, Peter Gregory, associate dean of the
School of Medicine, claims the benefits will be
felt by all, even Stanford students.
For basic care, students will still go to Cow
ell Student Health Center. For more complex
care, students are referred to the Medical
Center, where under the proposed plan, "stu
dents may have a wider range of physicians to
fulfill their needs," Gregory said.
That's because the Medical Center plans to
create a Stanford Health System that will
unify till the clinical activities of the Medical
Center, the physicians on the Medical School
faculty and those of the surrounding commu
nities.
week, University President Gerhard
Casper announced plans for major reorgani
zation of the Medical Center, saying that "a
response now to the changing marketplace is
essential to preserving the academic mission
of the School of Medicine."
Isaac Stein, special assistant to Casper and
a member of his Medical Center taskforce,
said he hopes Medical Center care will "be de
livered in a more efficient and user-friendly
way" by combining in- and out-patient ser
vices.
Gregory also said he has high hopes for the
new plan. "If it is done properly, I think it will
be a significant improvement over what's
been done in the past."
The new plan still makes the academic mis
sion of the Medical School the primary goal of
the restructuring, according to Gregory. "The
structure of the new system will benefit the

Medical School in that it will provide more
ambulatory or out-patient possibilities for its
students," said Gregory.
Kenneth Bloem, president and chief execu
tive officer of the Medical Center, indicated
that the new system is the key to organizing
the Center's internationally respected physi
cians into an entity that will be more attrac
tive to insurance companies, corporations,
employers and individuals seeking a compre
hensive and competitively-priced health care
plan.
He also mentioned that the increasingly
out-patient character of hospitals and chron
ic-disease management would naturally lead
to more at-home care and that the proposed
system would be fully prepared to ofler those
services.
The new system, according to Bloem,
should be successful under the managed com
petition plan proposed by Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the single-payer plan used in Canada
and advocated by some in Congress, and
under the status quo.
Its four goals of providing "more efficient
and competitive care, demonstrating this
high quality of care through patient satisfac
tion, delivering the care in an impeccable
manner, and delivering services across the
spectrum of care" will be effective under any
plan of government-regulated health care.
