# Brothers freed in stalking case
## 
### 
A bizarre case involving a rabbi from Is
rael and his brother, a Stanford couple and
a pair of plastic handcuffs came to an end
last month when the last remaining
charges against the brothers were dropped.
Rabbi Austin Yoncy Feld, 38, and Scott
Leon Feld, 36, were arrested and accused
last November of plotting to kill Assoc. Psy
chiatry Prof. Saul Wasserman and his wife.
"Our evidence did not rise to the level of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt," said Tom
Farris, a Santa Clara deputy district attor
ney, explaining why the charges were
dropped against the pair, who spent some
time in jail after the arrest.
When the Felds were arrested, police
found plastic handcuffs, knives and Teflon
tape in the trunk of the Felds' rented car.
They also found hand-drawn floor plans of
the Wasserman home and house keys that
the Wassermans' 22-year old daughter
Rachel had given to the Felds.

The fact that Rachel Wasserman had
previously made death threats against her
parents coupled with the discovery of the
items in the Felds' possession led investiga
tors to speculate that Rachel had convinced
the Felds to come to the United States to
murder her parents.
Rachel Wasserman met Rabbi Feld in
Jerusalem when she volunteered to work
for the Mossad Maccabee, a social welfare
organization that Feld runs in Israel.
Rachel eventually told Feld and other co
workers that she had been sexually abused
by her parents, an accusation she had made
several times before.
But questions about the reliability of her
claims cast doubt on the accusations
against the Felds.
"Witnesses (friends and co-workers)
from Israel found Rachel's accusations
non-credible," said Farris. "They didn't
think she was lying, but they questioned
the validity of her memory." Farris said
that he believes Rachel's behavior is symp
tomatic of a false memory syndrome.
"It is hard to reconcile this with a con
spiracy to harm her parents," said Farris.
The Felds maintained the purpose of
their visit was only to get a more accurate
sense of Rachel's past so they would be bet
ter able to help her cope with her problems
stemming in part from the sexual abuse she
claimed to have suffered.
While Farris felt this could conceivably
explain the presence of the keys and dia
grams in their possession, he found the
Felds' explanations for other items, such as
the handcuffs and knives, less convincing.
Nonetheless, in light of the Felds expla
nations that they were trying to help Rachel,
Farris said, "One has to question the Felds'
motivation to hurt the Wassermans."
Rachel Wasserman's unstable emotional
state and the lack of a clear motive for the
Felds convinced Farris that dropping the
charges was the best course of action.
The conspiracy to commit murder
charges were dropped in February, and the
Felds returned to Israel in March after
posting bail. With the support of the
Wassermans the final charges of conspiracy
to commit burglary were dropped June 14.
