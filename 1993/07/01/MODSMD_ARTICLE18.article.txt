## USA Hoops makes Worlds USC's Leslie leads 3-0 squad through qualifying tourney 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
With steady inside shooting from USC's Lisa Leslie
and erratic perimeter shooting from the whole team,
the USA Women's Basketball National Team over
powered Canada, Chile and Mexico to reach the semifi
nals of the Tournament of the Americas in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, and qualify for the 1994 World Championships
in Melbourne, Australia.
The top four finishers in the eight-team qualifying
tourney win automatic berths in next year's champi
onships.
The USA squad, including ex-Stanford standouts
Jennifer Azzi, Katy Steding, Molly Goodenbour and
current Cardinal head coach Tar a VanDerveer, stum
bled past Canada but breezed by Chile and Mexico.
The U.S. team fell on Saturday as the American
women shot an ice-cold 36.6 percent from the field and
an even more frigid l-for-18 from behind the three
point line.
Canada went on a 15-8 run late in the first half to
break a 18-18 deadlock. Ruthie Bolton knocked in five
points to bring the U.S. to within 46-38 at the half.
The Americans finally revved up halfway through

the second period with Bolton, Dena Head and Leslie
spearheading a 20-7 run. The U.S. hung on for an 82-
74 victory.
"Committing too many fouls and poor shooting
hurt us in the first half, but I was very happy with the
way we were able to fight hack," VanDerveer said.
Leslie led the team in scoring with 23 points on 9-for
-12 shooting from the field and 5-for-6 from the free throw
line. Steding pulled down a team-high eight rebounds.
None of the three ex-Cardinal stars played well of
fensively as the trio of Azzi, Steding and Goodenbour
combined for an abysmal 5-for-22 shooting perfor
mance, including l-for-16 from longdistance.
But, as cold as they were Saturday, they were equal
ly as hot on Sunday. Azzi poured in 30 points on a per
fect 7-for-7 showing from 2-point range and 5-for-8
from outside the line to lead the U.S. squad to a 121-41
thumping of Chile.
Altogether, the women shot over 63 percent from
the field and canned 10-of-19 three-pointers, all from
10-for-16 shooting by the ex-Stanford players.
The U.S. women's final hurdle to a World Champi
onship berth came on Monday in the form of Mexico.
The U.S. began the game with a 13-2 run but cooled
off after another streak of icy three-point shooting.
However, Leslie continued her strong play and pulled
down 16 boards in the first half and added 15 points to
help the U.S. to a 43-28 halflime lead.
The Americans started the second period, with a
scoring explosion that, this time, put the game away.
With nine minutes left to play, the U.S. held a com
manding 71-35 advantage. The squad cruised to a 97-
54 victory with 19 points from co-captain Bolton, 16
from Leslie and 13 from Azzi.
The defense also held strong, forcing the Mexican
squad into 30 turnovers and keeping their opponents
to just over a 30 percent shooting percentage.
"Our first goal was to qualify for the World Cham
pionship, but now its time to work toward our second
goal of a medal finish at this tournament," VanDerveer
said.
The squad's inconsistent shooting may prove it's
Achilles heel against the more physical teams like
Brazil, who also went 3-0 in early-round play.
