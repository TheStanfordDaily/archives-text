## Editorial Second class seniors? Graduates got short end of pricey stick at Commencement 1993

Never bite the hand that
will one day feed you.
Good advice that the
University would do well to
remember when Com
mencement rolls around
again next year.
Upon shoving off this
year's batch of future con
tributors, the University —
with the help of the Alumni
Association and the senior
class presidents — missed
several key opportunities to
give the graduating class
that warm fuzzy feeling that
will someday translate into
dollars for the university.
The tacky, thin cardboard
diploma covers that replaced
the faux vinyl ones of yester
year made the already-anti
climactic, $100,000 piece of
paper look a little too much
like a bar-mitzvah certifi
cate. Sure, the change saved
the University $3 per stu
dent, but in the context of
total cost of Commence
ment, that savings becomes
relatively insignificant.
The Monday noon "check
out time" the University im
posed on seniors — who had
received their diplomas
fewer than 24 hours earlier
— left graduates feeling like
the campus was more of a
hotel than a home.
Though there were four
days between the end of fi
nals week and graduation,
much of that time was spent
chaperoning family mem
bers, saying goodbye to
friends, finishing last
minute papers, filling out
final pieces of University pa
perwork and enjoying pre-
Commencement activities.

An extra day or two to pack
up four years' worth of stuff
would have been greatly ap
preciated.
Charging students for
their own "Night Before"
party and the Alumni Asso
ciation luncheon made se
niors feel like they were
being nickled and dimed.
If the senior class presi
dents feel they need to raise
money for a class gift, they
should hold a year-long
fund-raising campaign or
charge dues like the ASSU. If
the money is simply needed
to pay the events' expenses,
the Alumni Association
should make a sound invest
ment in its future member
ship and underwrite the
events.
Seniors would feel more
connected to their gradua
tion ceremony if they could
participate in the choice of
the commencement speaker.
Although this year's senior
class presidents did publicly
solicit ideas from the class,
passing that input on to the
University committee, a poll
would have fostered more
class unity.
The University puts
much time and effort into
making students' memories
of this place wonderful, and
it seems a shame to destroy
those memories at the very
end. A disproportionate per
centage of alumni's recollec
tions involve the graduation
ceremony and the events
surrounding it. And, in
many cases, that is all their
parents ever see of Stanford.
To improve these memo
ries, Stanford should treat
the senior class in its last few
days. If that means tacking
an extra hundred dollars
onto the University bill, fine.
It will be well-hidden.
Better to splurge now
than suffer later.
