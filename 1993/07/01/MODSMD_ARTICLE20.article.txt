### Daniel Picker Staff writer 
As the sun beat down on The
All England Lawn Tennis and
Croquet Club, former Stanford
players continued their assault
at Wimbledon into the fourth
round.
Unseeded qualifier Mered
ith McGrath serve-and
volleyed through the first three
rounds of the women's singles
competition before running
into former champion and top
seed Steffi Graf in the fourth.
McGrath, who British odds
makers had at 1,000-1 to win
before the tournament start
ed, gave Graf a respectable
match before succombing 6-1,
6-4. Graf rumbled to a 3-0 lead
in the first set before Mc-
Grath, who turned profession
al in 1990 after her freshman
year at Stanford, got on the
board.
The No. 1 and No. 148-
ranked players in the world
battled almost even in the sec
ond set until the powerful Ger
man put away her less experi
enced opponent. However Mc-
Grath is still in contention in
mixed doubles as she and fellow
American Luke Jensen ad
vanced to the second round of
mixed doubles.
In men's singles, David
Wheaton, a past Wimbledon
semi-finalist, marched through
the first week, racking up for
mer French Open Champion
Michael Chang as one of his vic
tims.
Wheaton then met former
Northwestern star Todd Mar
tin, who earlier in the touma

ment upset last year's finalist
Goran Ivanisevic in five sets.
In the battle of mid-western
ers, the Minnesota-bred
Wheaton lost in five sets. The
former Stanford ace served
below par and fell 6-4, 5-7, 5-7,
7-5, 6-3.
In men's doubles, former
Cardinal standouts Patrick
McEnroe and Jonathan Stark
teamed up to battle through
the third round. McEnroe and
Stark cruised past David DiLu
cia and Brian McPhie 7-6 (7-4),
6-3, 7-6 (7-2), but then the No.
3 seeded tandem ran up
against Grant Connell and
Patrick Galbraith in the fourth
round.
The Stanford duo fought
through five sets only to lose 4-
6, 6-3,6-7(7-9), 7-6(7-2), 6-4.
Other former Stanford stars
fell in the early rounds in sin
gles. Tami Whitlinger, who
turned professional after her
sophomore year in 1989, bat
tled back in the first round but
lost to Ann Grossman in a see
saw three-setter, 6-0, 4-6, 6-4.
Alex O'Brien, 1992 NCAA
singles, doubles and team
champion, was a first round ca
sualty of veteran American
Aaron Krickstein, 6-2, 7-6(7-4),
6-3. Jared Palmer and Scott
Davis also lost in the first round
to Ken Flach and Rick Leach, 6-
4,6-4,7-6(7-4).
Former Stanford star Der
rick Rostagno advanced to the
third round but fell to Petr
Korda 6-3,6-4,6-4.1987 NCAA
champion Patty Fendick lost in
the third round to Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario 6-3,6-2.
