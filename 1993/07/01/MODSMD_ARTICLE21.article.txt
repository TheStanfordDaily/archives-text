# American spikers face Russian foe
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Although the Cold War is over,
Russia and the United States will
exchange kills and spikes
tomorrow on Stanford's campus.
The early Fourth of July
fireworks start at 7:30 p.m. in a
clash between the United
States and Russian World
League national volleyball
teams at Maples Pavilion.
Both squads feature
Olympic athletes as well as club
team stars and graduates from
the collegiate volleyball ranks.
While the Russians, 12-0 in
World League competition,
boast eight Olympians from the
1988 Games, the United
States, 5-7, will counter with
seven 1988 bronze medalists.
Some of the U.S. players come
fresh from the 1992 Olympic
team. Among these are Tom
Sorenson, Bob Samuelson and
expert jump-server Eric Sato.
Each of the 12 World League
teams is vying for a $3 million
purse. In addition, the match
will be a homecoming for U.S.
coach Fred Sturm — who
coached both Cardinal men and
women's teams in the past —
and former Stanford standout
Duncan Blackman, a member
of this year's U.S. squad.
Blackman, who plays out
side hitter, graduated from

Stanford in 1992 as a first-team
All-American. As he spiked the
Cardinal to two second-place
finishes at the 1989 and 1992
NCAA's during his college ca
reer, Duncan became Stan-

ford's all time

leader in ser
vice aces. He
also ranks sec
ond in digs
and fourth in
kills in Cardi
nal history.
Sturm was
head coach for
the Stanford

men from 1978-1990 as well as
head coach for the women from
1978-1985. During his 12-year
career with the Cardinal, he
amassed over 300 victories,
more than any other Stanford
volleyball coach. Sturm led the
Stanford men to a second-place
finish at the 1989 NCAA tour
nament, which earned him
coach-of-the-year honors. He
also guided the Cardinal women
to two runner-up performances
at the 1984 and 1985 NCAA
tournaments, as well as four
other top-five finishes. Sturm
took over as U.S. national team
coach in January 1991,
spurring both a bronze medal
outing at the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona and a third-place per
formance in last year's World
League competition.
