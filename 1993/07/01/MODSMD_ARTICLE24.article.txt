Thirty years ago, U.S. Secret Service
agent Frank Horrigan failed to save
President Kennedy from an assassin's
bullet. But when he starts receiving a
series of phone calls from a man threat
ening to kill the current president, he
vows, "That's not gonna happen."
That's the setup for hot actor-director
Clint Eastwood's latest film, "In the Line
of Fire." Co-starring Rene Russo ("Lethal
Weapon 3") and John Malkovich and
directed by Wolfgang Petersen ("Das
Boot"), this film promises the intelligent
action that Sly and Arnie couldn't deliver.
Equally searing should be this sum
mer's second adaptation of a Michael
Crichton novel, "Rising Sun." The film
stars Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes in
this suspense thriller about two of Los
Angeles' finest investigating the murder
of a prostitute in the headquarters of a
Japanese electronics conglomerate.
Crichton tried to elevate himself into
the ranks of "important authors" with

this stupefyingly racist diatribe against
Japanese businesses disguised as a mur
der mystery. Not content with the "facts"
of how the economically rapacious
Japanese are destroying America, he also
paints them as officious sex fiends who
can't wait to get their hands on tall white
women. If the relentless demonization of
an entire culture doesn't bother you,
then kick back and enjoy.
Hot film o' the Summer: anything
that doesn't have "Last" in the title or
Schwarzenegger in the credits.
