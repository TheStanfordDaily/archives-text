In the '80s, they brought us such witty
ditties as "Poison" and "Do Me,"
charming their way into the hearts of
female America with lines like, "me and
the crew used to do her." Among the
pioneers of New Jack Swing — hip-hop
smoothed out on an R&B tip — Bell Biv
Devoe's follow-up album was supposed
to drop last year. But when radio's reac
tion to the first single "Gangsta" was
decidedly lukewarm, they went back to
the studio, prompting media speculation
that the party was over.
Don't believe the hype — Ricky Bell,
Michael Bivins and Ronnie Devoe have
come back strapped. The new first sin
gle, "Ghetto Booty," an ode to rumps
and the women that shake them,
promises to give "Dazzy Duks" a fight
for the *93 "Baby Got Back" award.
The hot subcategory in music is
soundtracks — and there's a bunch of
'em. "Sliver" features ÜB4o's cover of
Elvis Presley's "Can't Help Falling In
Love," two tracks by Enigma and a
dancehall version of "Oh Carolina" by
Shaggy. Tina Turner re-records her hits
on "What's Love Got To Do With It"
and great singers Louis Armstrong and

Nat King Cole keep listeners wide awake
on "Sleepless in Seattle."
Hot Album o' the Summer: U2's
"Zooropa." 'Nuff said.
