Stanford alumnus Trey Ellis (Class of
*84) kicks out the jams with his
newest novel, "Home Repairs" Austin
McMillan, the adopted son of a doctor
and a university professor, recounts his
close encounters with the opposite sex,
covering the years 1979-1988. From his
New England prep school to a certain
prestigious Northern California univer
sity, McMillan fights to lose his virginity.
While his obsession with women may be
tiresome, Ellis makes some perceptive
comments on the black middle-class.
Hot young author Amanda
Fillipacci's "Nude Men" takes up where
Nabokov's "Lolita" left off. There's a
twist on that classic tale; here, the man is
attracted to the young girl's mother, but
the girl seduces him — with the moth
er's encouragement. If only Humbert
Humbert could have had it so easy, per
haps he wouldn't have had to go on the
lam.
On the non-fiction side, neuro
anatomist Simon LeVay's latest book,
"The Sexual Brain," promises to be at
least as controversial as his 1991 article
describing differences between the hypo
thalamic brain structure of gay and
straight men. Here he goes on to argue
that specific areas of the hypothalamus
generate behaviors that are typical of
men or typical of women, particularly in
sexual behavior and aggression. He
agrees with Freud's theory that gay men
have close fathers and distant mothers,
explaining that the young child's "gay"
traits provoke a negative response from

the father and a positive response from
the mother. Good for many evenings of
discussion.
Hot Author o' the Summer: Oprah
Winfrey — if she ever gets around to
writing that autobiography.
