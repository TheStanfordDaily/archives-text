Speaking of "Lolita," two films — one
terrible, one not-quite-as-terrible,
examine that ol' man-girl magic.
Terrible, a.k.a. "The Crush," is a "Fatal
Attraction" type thriller, except the
crazed psychobitch is a 14-year-old
nymphet. The hero's integrity is never
in doubt, but the filmmakers' is — the
numerous shots of pouty Alicia
Silverstone in skimpy cotton outfits
turn this garbage into a pedophile's
dream.
"The Lover," based on the Marguerite
Duras novel, is better than "The Crush,"
but not by much. Like the book, the
film chronicles the torrid affair between
a 15-year-old French girl and a thir
tysomething Chinese man in Vietnam.
There's plenty of vigorous softcore sex
— ostensibly meant to mirror their rela
tionship — but the performers grunt
more convincingly than they act. Every
inch of newcomer Jane March's body is
put on display, but Tony Leung penis
never seems to find its way to the cam
era. Surprise, surprise.
Some better hot flicks include: Neil
Jordan's "The Crying Game," Quentin
Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs," Francis
Ford Coppola's "Dracula" and Clint
Eastwood's elegiac noir-western
"Unforgiven."
