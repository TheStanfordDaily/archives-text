## A
						film of one's own Orlando 
### 
Sally Potter s "Orlando" is an admirable, yet
uneven effort to translate Virginia Woolf's
novel of the same name to the big screen. Beau
tiful to watch, yet shallow and passionless, the
film oscillates between moments of perceptive
commentary about the role of gender in histo
ry and long stretches of self-indulgent cine
matography.
"Orlando" follows the title character
through a series of vignettes that add up to four
hundred years of his/her life history. As a young
nobleman, Orlando enchants the aging queen
Elizabeth (an arch Quentin Crisp) with his ra
diant youthfulness. She adopts him as the fa
vorite of her old age, bestowing a mansion
upon him providing that he promises never to
wither or grow old.
After the Queen's death, Orlando falls in
love with Sasha, a visiting Russian princess who
ultimately betrays him. Forsaken by love and
discouraged from a career in poetry, Orlando
seeks his fortune as an ambassador in the
deserts of central Asia.
Refusing to kill or be killed in an ensuing
war, Orlando wakes up one morning trans
formed into a woman. Upon returning to 18th
century London, she must marry and have
heirs or risk losing her ancestral home in a law
suit Orlando's witty aside — "Same person,
different sex" — doesn't hold up to the scruti
ny of patriarchy.
Clearly "Orlando" is fantasy, but the plot
creates problems no matter how much we sus
pend our disbelief. How can these lawsuits drag
on from one century to the next, given that Or
lando is the only immortal character in the
story? Why does no one find her transforma
tion from male to female troublesome? The an
swers are nowhere to be found.
Continuity is aided by the restrained and
witty performance of Tilda Swinton, whose
Orlando never seems to be surprised by bodily
transformations, considering them only su
perficial. Unfortunately, Potter misses every
opportunity to let us know more about Orlan
do's thoughts and feelings, beyond enjoining
Swinton to glance meaningfully at the camera
from time to time.
It's a shame that the screenplay isn't better,
since this one of the most visually interesting
films in recent memory. The visual richness of
the film, the exquisite period costumes and the
painterly quality of the shots are all remarkable
— particularly within the confines of its $4
million budget.
After a while, however, the combination of
self-conscious visual artistry and a thrumming
Enya-meets-Dire-Straits soundtrack becomes
as exhausting as a 90-minute music video. Aes
thetes may praise "Orlando" for its looks, but
Virginia Woolf deserved better than this.
