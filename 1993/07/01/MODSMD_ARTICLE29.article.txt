# Sleepless in Seattle
## 
### 
"Sleepless in Seattle" is the on-air nickname
of Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks), a recent widow
er forced onto a national talk radio show by his
son, Johal (Ross Malinger), a concerned eight
year-old. After some prodding by "Dr. Marcia,"
Sam admits that sure, life without the missus
has been tough, but he refuses to try again. He's
convinced that "it doesn't happen twice,"
which, in movie language, means that "it" in
evitably will.
Across the country, Annie Reed (Meg Ryan),

a Baltimore journalist, hears Sam on the radio
and promptly falls in love. Never mind that she's
never met Sam, and is in fact already engaged to
an endearingly dorky guy named Walter (Bill
Pullman). Annie — along with several thou
sand other women — is captivated by Sam's
story and sets out to ease his pain.
It's the beginning of the "Griffin and
Sabine"-esque relationship at the center of this
"When Harry Met Sally" wannabe, courtesy of
writer-director Nora Ephron, who knows
whereof she borrows.
In "Sleepless," Ephron, who also wrote the
far-superior 1989 hit "Met", takes the same
conventions — distinctive wardrobes, witty
banter, slick ad campaign, romantic oldies on
the soundtrack — and distorts them to fit her
own, slightly preposterous vision.
Ephron's grand larceny culminates in the
theft of a scene from her—and Annie's favorite
movie, "An Affair to Remember," which con
trives to have Sam and Annie meet on top of
the Empire State Building at sunset — on
Valentine's Day, no less.
You don't have to be a fan of the 1957 Cary
Grant-Deborah Kerr vehicle to appreciate the
symbolism. A sappy don't-let's-ask-for-the
moon tragi-romance, "An Affair to Remember"
makes even "Sleepless in Seattle" look plausible
— no small task, considering that Sam and
Annie don't even meet until the final scene,
when most screen lovers would be sharing that
first French kiss.
The actors' performances are hampered by
the artifice of the script. Sam, at least, has Jonah
to talk to, but Annie is usually left babbling to
herself, which Ryan handles by being even
perkier than usual.
Too often, Annie comes off as a rapacious,
manipulative female bent on ruining lives —
yet seen through Sam's eyes, she becomes real,
golden and appealing.
But the currents of gender stereotyping go

much deeper. Ephron continually insists that
women aren't desperate for husbands, then
portrays them as being just that. Barbara Gar
rick's performance as Sam's would-be girl
friend, is a witty, but rather disturbing com
mentary on contemporary sexual politics.
"Sleepless" works best when it speaks to in
dividuals, rather than genders; when it doesn't
spell out its conventions; when things just hap
pen without being automatically labeled
"signs" or, worse, "magic." Unfortunately, the
entire film is driven by the tension of waiting
for two people to meet, assuming that they'll
live happily ever after once they do.
Only in the movies.
