## G'day and goodbye 
### 
I hate the Fourth of July. Don't
get me wrong. I'm not a social
ist, or an anarchist, or a flag
burnerist, or any other "ist." I vote.
I pledge allegiance. I get misty dur
ing "The Star Spangled Banner,"
especially if Michael Bolton is
singing. I recognize that commu
nism is bad and capitalism is good
and soccer is inherently evil.
But I can't help wondering what
all the fuss is about. I hold this
truth to be self-evident: that just
because we live in America we are
not fundamentally better than
anyone else.
Once upon a time, perhaps,
America coulda been a contendah.
We had the bomb, the car, Elvis,
the Space Shuttle. Now everyone
has whatever's "it,"and we're left
picking up the non-biodegrade
ables in a country whose mtyor
contribution to the New World
Order is Zima.

Yet beneath our star-spangled
superficiality there remains a
sense of superiority that's as
American as apple pie. After all,
who needs spotted owls, affordable
health care and gays in the military
so long as American movies break
box office records worldwide,
American Dream Teams bring
home the gold and there's a Big
Mac on every plate from Argentina
to Zaire?

We like ourselves. Moreover, we
tremble at the thought of being
thought "un-American." On Inde
pendence Day, we hang flags on
anything that will stand still, like
my mother puts a Bible on the cof
fee table when Minister Gene
comes to visit. We pay homage to
the American Way in the eminent
ly palatable yet vaguely menacing
form of a grandfatherly white man
with a beard like Santa Claus'.
We eat too much watermelon
and illegally set off air-polluting,
fire-starting, child-maiming explo
sives that always seem to end up
stuck in some poor cat's rectum.
Afterwards, we sit around in a na
tionwide glut of used sparklers and
plastic forks, making jokes about
"what the French are doing right
now."
I say, those who live in card
board boxes should throw no
stones.
That's why I'm moving to Aus
tralia. I don't know when, I don't
know how, but I'm going, and I'm
going to like it there.
Aiid it's not just because I've
seen "Strictly Ballroom" six times.
Ever since buying my first Olivia
Newton-John LP back in the
fourth grade, I've wanted to live in
Australia. Now that I've experi
enced the alternative, I'm ready.
Boy, am I ever.

Oh, give me a home where mar
supials roam, where the sheep out
number the people three to one,
where they race camels and boats
made of beer cans and I can go to
the opera 364 days a year!
Australia's national holiday,
known simply as Australia Day,
commemorates not its discovery,
nor its independence, but the ar
rival of its first shipload of set
tlers â€” all of them convicted
felons.
I'm dreaming of a place where the
alternative is celebrated rather than
resisted, where patriotism and anti
authoritarianism go hand in hand. I
can almost taste the Vegemite.
Last week on cable, I caught
what appeared to be the last 10
minutes of an Australian gay soap
opera. And I recently read that a na
tional Australian arts agency is
funding a training video for prosti
tutes.
All I can say is, it would never
have happened here. A lot of things,
I think, will never happen here, and
I don't want to be around when
they don't.

Kimberly Chrisman would like to
remind Mel Gibson to throw an
other shrimp on the barbie for
her.
