# House of Cards
## 
### 
Crowded between the cliffs, dinosaurs and
action heroes of the summer, "House of Cards"
desperately wants to be an off-beat tale of mys
ticism and clinical psychology. But while its
brand of melodrama clutches at our heart
strings, it never pulls them convincingly.
After a freak accident claims the life of her
husband, a well-heeled architect (Kathleen
Tlirner) and her two children trade in the lush
rain forests of South America for the security of
their home in the United States cloistered amidst
the trees of woodsy suburbia, their house pro
vides the ideal atmosphere for the family's re
covery — except for Turner's daughter, Sally.
In a matter of days, the once-bright six
year-old develops a textbook case of autism.
Tiirner, thinking that Sally is merely coping
with the death of her father in her own unique
way, misjudges the child's condition, allowing

it to go unchecked. But eventually a string of
near disasters and an obstinate child psycholo
gist (Tommy Lee Jones) force her to recognize
the volatile nature of Sally's mental illness.
Punctuated by snappy dialogue and a story
that feels like a great adaptation of a "page
turning" best seller, writer-director Michael
Lessac's original screenplay is a mixed bag of
tricks, whose busy technique keeps the story
moving without ever moving us.
On the surface, "House of Cards" reminds
us of the tacky human interest stories we use
to watch on ABC's "That's Incredible!": A
mother's love for her young daughter tri
umphs over a dreaded childhood illness.
But when Turner tells an incredulous
Jones that "Sally isn't autistic, she's just differ
ent," it's not because she believes in the power
of love — she worries that been a better
mother to her son then to her daughter. Per
haps if she can bring Sally back from the abyss
of autism with a heavy rotation of love and
unbridled affection, her fears — that Sally
was Daddy's little cherub but Mommy's ne
glected peon — can be laid to rest.
Unfortunately, Lessac never takes the time
to flesh things out sensibly. Is Turner's charac
ter as self-centered as wc think? We'll never
know. Lessac chooses instead to string groups
of scenes together with vague journeys into the
mystic regions of the mind — even the sup
posedly sane Turner's.
Each journey, however, drags us farther and
farther from narrative logic, until we're re
lieved to find Sally, at films' end, in splendid
mental and physical condition, not because we
care, but because we've grown weary of in
dulging the director.
'House of Cards" reminds us that not every
summer film need be a mega-budget techno
thriller. That, however, isn't necessarily a rea
son to see those that aren't.
