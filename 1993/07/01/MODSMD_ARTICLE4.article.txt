Yost Resident Fellow
demands a recount of
house's student staff

Same-sex showers:
the test of the truly
macho military man

I share The Daily's concern for
the proliferation of student staff
positions within the housing sys
tem and the effect that it has on
the availability of spaces for the
student body at large.
As the resident fellow in Yost,
however, I need to point out two
factual errors in The Daily's
March 20 editorial, "Dodging the
Draw."
First, Yost House is adding a
"program assistant," not a "focus
assistant." The two are different.
Given that The Daily found incon
sistency in having a "focus assis
tant" in a non-focus house, I be
lieve it is reasonable to expect a
higher standard of accuracy.
Secondly, The Daily makes ref
erence to Yost's "resident assis
tants," when in fact we have only a

single RA position.
Other information bears on
this situation, and should, I think,
clear up what The Daily sees as
something "amiss with this pic
ture." Firstly, Yost House, with 60
residents, has one of the highest
student-to-RA ratios on campus.
Further, while many of the
duties of the RA scale with the
size of the house, many other RA
tasks are independent of the
house size. When there is only
one RA to carry out all of them,
the problem becomes one of sim
ply having the RA overwhelmed
with the sheer number of things
that must be done, often by
virtue of what residents them
selves expect.
One of my prime concerns in
requesting a program assistant
for next year, then, was to spread
the burden of these chores over
two individuals, freeing up time
for both to focus on imaginative
and creative programming within
the house — programming that

is not limited to focus or theme
dorms and may lead to the even
tual designation of Yost as just
such a house.
Lastly, it would have been
helpful for The Daily to have
looked a bit closer at the specific
details of the staffing at Yost.
While living in the RF cottage, it
is also my privilege to serve this
University and its students in a
fairly large number of ways. If
The Daily thinks that these activ
ities disqualify me for service as
an RF, I would ask only that it
contact the residents in Yost and
seek their opinionr., and perhaps
that of Alice Supton, the Director
of Residential Education.
For no extra funds, the addi
tion of a PA position to Yost will
allow me and my staff to provide
a still more enriching environ
ment for its residents. I hope that
will be judged a worthwhile ex
penditure of a spot in our house.

Is the U.S. military composed
of men or pantywaists? Can any
man who becomes terrified at the
thought of gays in the showers be
fit for the battlefield?
