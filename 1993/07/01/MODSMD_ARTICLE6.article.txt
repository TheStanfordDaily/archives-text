# 'Change direction and get out of the way'
## A 						CONVERSATION WITH: Donald Kennedy 
### 
n September 1, 1992, Donald
Kennedy left his post as Stanford's
w m eighth president. Kennedy's 12-year
tenure was marked by the unprece
dented ascent of the University to the top
rank of research institutions in the world. It
was maired, however, by the controversy sur
rounding government funding to the Univer
sity, a scandal which ultimately prompted
Kennedy's resignation. After taking a sab
batical this year, Kennedy will lead two semi
nars in the fall, co-coordinate Human Biolo
gy 4B in the spring, and conduct research in
environmental policy. Twelve months since
delivering his final address to the Stanford
community, Kennedy spoke to The Stanfonl
Weekly News Editor Rornesh Ratnesar, re
flecting on teaching, his successor and the
joys and fxiins of returning to the real world.
SW: Explain the adjustment, if there was
one, that you had to make, stepping out of
the spotlight of the presidency.
Kennedy: I have lots and lots to do, but
one does it in a very different way. In a big
job, like being the president of a universi
ty, or being the head of a government
agency, which I was before that (as head of
the Food and Drug Administration), you
live by the calendar.
When you're leading the life of a scholar
and teacher, you have your own objectives
and you fill your time with them but you
make lots of moment to moment decisions
about how you're going to spend it. And
that requires a form of discipline that's
quite different from the kind of discipline
required for structuring an administrative
life.
And for me, there's the desire to spend
rather more time with my family and com
mit more time to the process of living that
everybody is responsible for. There, too,
there's a change, because executives tend
to have quite a lot of support, and you
emerge from 15 years of that kind of life to
discover that you've forgotten how to do
certain things.
You may remember the fuss that was
created when George Bush walked into a
supermarket for the first time and saw a
bar code scanner and said "Oh my God,
what's this marvelous piece of technolo
gy!" I never got that far out of it, I can
promise you, but there were things that I
didn't have to d 0...1 spend a lot more time
in the grocery store, a lot more time in
lines of various sorts. It's been a kind of re
emergence into reality.
SW: Let's talk a little bit about how you ve
perceived President Casper's first year Have
you followed his administration closely ?

Kennedy: Not at all. This is not an at
tempt to duck around the question, but re
member that we had a summer transition,
a very good summer transition; I left office
on Sept. 1, and made a very deliberate ef
fort in the fall to distance myself.
When I came back to Stanford in the
spring,l did what everybody advised me to
do: change direction and get out of the
way. It is really important for a new per
son to shape the job in his own way, and to
make his own decisions. I've tried very
hard to provide that independence.
SW: Much of the media review of Casper's
first year has said that Stanford's image

has improved under him. Part of the im
plication is that prior to his arrival, Stan
ford's image was very low, and the morale
was very low. Do you think that is an inac
curate reading of your time here? Does
that bother you at all, when you see things
like that?
Kennedy: I suppose everyone has his
own view about how an institution is far
ing We took a rough pounding during and
after the indirect-cost hearings. My sense
is that what we are witnessing is a funda
mentally healthy institution making ex
actly the kind of recovery you would ex
pect. So I don't take that as a personal neg
ative at all.
There's no question that Stanford's repu
tation will improve. It will improve because
Stanford's case will look better and the gov
ernment's case will look worse as time goes
on, because our case was pretty good.
SW: With the new administration in
Washington, what are the kinds of changes
you see in the way higher education deals
with the government?
Kennedy I think it's early times yet, but
there's no question that this president, de

spite the hostile media attention to every
misstep, is making record legislative
progress so far. The public service bill,
which is profoundly important to higher
education, has gone very well. So we're
going to see some important and interest
ing changes.
There will be some changes with the re
search agencies with which Stanford has
very important relationships. I think that
by and large, the changes will be positive
for higher education in general and for
Stanford in particular.
But, and this is a big but, this adminis
tration is properly concerned with the des
perate urgency of deficit reduction. So no

one should look for significant increases in
the availability of research funds, no one
should look for dramatic improvements in
our indirect cost rate, no one should look
for important new student aid programs.
Bottom line: it's going to be a very, very
tough time economically for higher educa
tion, though I don't think national policies
will be fundamentally unfriendly to it. It's
that we're starting to pay off for the 12
binge years from 1980-1992.
SW: Is Stanford still paying that price ?
Uou> long are we going to feel the squeeze ?
Kennedy: We are paying the price. But in
terestingly enough, despite having two
rather special problems, namely the earth
quake, which was devastating to out physi
cal plant, and the indirect-cost controversy,
which will certainly turn out to have been
expensive for us, we are not in worse finan
cial shape than most of the universities in
our universe of quality comparison.
SW: President Casper has authorized a
commission to re-examine undergraduate
education at Stanford, which will no doubt
include an assessment of multicultural ed

ucation. Coming back from the presiden
cy, how do you perceive the changes that
occurred in multicultural education dur
ing your term?
Kennedy: I think Stanford took the lead
in reformulating the national debate on
what ought to be the common intellectual
agenda in American higher education. We
took some flak for it, largely by people de
liberately misrepresented what we were
doing. Where we came out is a place that I
am very comfortable with, and a place that
people who looked carefully at what hap
pened here are comfortable with.
My own feeling is that this commission
ought not to make as it primary mission a
reexamination of these curricular issues. I
don't think the curriculum is the impor
tant dimension.
I think the focal issue ought to be, how do
we develop a meaningful sense of collective
departmental responsibility for the quality
of education, and the quality of teaching â€”
by which I mean all the forms of teaching. It
seems to me that the commission needs to
worry about process and commitment, as
much as about what is taught.
I don't expect this to involve prominent
ly a review of the DRs, or CIV. I don't
think you can ignore these issues, but it
isn't right for them to be up front.
SW: Looking back, are there things you
miss about the presidency, or wish you had
finished? Are there things you don't miss ?
Kennedy: I surprise people by saying that
I enjoyed the fund-raising part. There are a
lot of retired university presidents say,
"boy, am I glad I don't have to fund raise
anymore." I don't feel that way about it. In
fact, I'll probably still fund raise.
The best parts [about being president!
were really the chance to interact with and
get a bird's-eye view of a lot of wonderful
activities here, and that's easier to do from
that perch than the one I have now.
SW: Where do you see yourself 10 or 15
years from now ?
Kennedy: Well, when you're 62, you don't
usually use 15-year projections.
I expect to teach for some considerable
time and to develop the scholarly interests
I'm committed to, in particular in the in
terdisciplinary study of global environ
ment. I haven't sorted out where I want 5,
10 years from now, other than that I ex
pect to be here, and my role to be really
much like the one I am describing.
SW: Are you happy ?
Kennedy Yes, absolutely. I couldn't be
happier.

our universe of quality comparison.
SW: President Casper has authorized a
commission to re-examine undergraduate
education at Stanford, which will no doubt
include an assessment of multicultural ed

ucation. Coming back from the presiden
cy, how do you perceive the changes that
occurred in multicultural education dur
ing your term?
Kennedy: I think Stanford took the lead
in reformulating the national debate on
what ought to be the common intellectual
agenda in American higher education. We
took some flak for it, largely by people de
liberately misrepresented what we were
doing. Where we came out is a place that I
am very comfortable with, and a place that
people who looked carefully at what hap
pened here are comfortable with.
My own feeling is that this commission
ought not to make as it primary mission a
reexamination of these curricular issues. I
don't think the curriculum is the impor
tant dimension.
I think the focal issue ought to be, how do
we develop a meaningful sense of collective
departmental responsibility for the quality
of education, and the quality of teaching â€”
by which I mean all the forms of teaching. It
seems to me that the commission needs to
worry about process and commitment, as
much as about what is taught.
I don't expect this to involve prominent
ly a review of the DRs, or CIV. I don't
think you can ignore these issues, but it
isn't right for them to be up front.
SW: Looking back, are there things you
miss about the presidency, or wish you had
finished? Are there things you don't miss ?
Kennedy: I surprise people by saying that
I enjoyed the fund-raising part. There are a
lot of retired university presidents say,
"boy, am I glad I don't have to fund raise
anymore." I don't feel that way about it. In
fact, I'll probably still fund raise.
The best parts [about being president!
were really the chance to interact with and
get a bird's-eye view of a lot of wonderful
activities here, and that's easier to do from
that perch than the one I have now.
SW: Where do you see yourself 10 or 15
years from now ?
Kennedy: Well, when you're 62, you don't
usually use 15-year projections.
I expect to teach for some considerable
time and to develop the scholarly interests
I'm committed to, in particular in the in
terdisciplinary study of global environ
ment. I haven't sorted out where I want 5,
10 years from now, other than that I ex
pect to be here, and my role to be really
much like the one I am describing.
SW: Are you happy ?
Kennedy Yes, absolutely. I couldn't be
happier.

n September 1, 1992, Donald
Kennedy left his post as Stanford's
w m eighth president. Kennedy's 12-year
tenure was marked by the unprece
dented ascent of the University to the top
rank of research institutions in the world. It
was maired, however, by the controversy sur
rounding government funding to the Univer
sity, a scandal which ultimately prompted
Kennedy's resignation. After taking a sab
batical this year, Kennedy will lead two semi
nars in the fall, co-coordinate Human Biolo
gy 4B in the spring, and conduct research in
environmental policy. Twelve months since
delivering his final address to the Stanford
community, Kennedy spoke to The Stanfonl
Weekly News Editor Rornesh Ratnesar, re
flecting on teaching, his successor and the
joys and fxiins of returning to the real world.
SW: Explain the adjustment, if there was
one, that you had to make, stepping out of
the spotlight of the presidency.
Kennedy: I have lots and lots to do, but
one does it in a very different way. In a big
job, like being the president of a universi
ty, or being the head of a government
agency, which I was before that (as head of
the Food and Drug Administration), you
live by the calendar.
When you're leading the life of a scholar
and teacher, you have your own objectives
and you fill your time with them but you
make lots of moment to moment decisions
about how you're going to spend it. And
that requires a form of discipline that's
quite different from the kind of discipline
required for structuring an administrative
life.
And for me, there's the desire to spend
rather more time with my family and com
mit more time to the process of living that
everybody is responsible for. There, too,
there's a change, because executives tend
to have quite a lot of support, and you
emerge from 15 years of that kind of life to
discover that you've forgotten how to do
certain things.
You may remember the fuss that was
created when George Bush walked into a
supermarket for the first time and saw a
bar code scanner and said "Oh my God,
what's this marvelous piece of technolo
gy!" I never got that far out of it, I can
promise you, but there were things that I
didn't have to d 0...1 spend a lot more time
in the grocery store, a lot more time in
lines of various sorts. It's been a kind of re
emergence into reality.
SW: Let's talk a little bit about how you ve
perceived President Casper's first year Have
you followed his administration closely ?

Kennedy: Not at all. This is not an at
tempt to duck around the question, but re
member that we had a summer transition,
a very good summer transition; I left office
on Sept. 1, and made a very deliberate ef
fort in the fall to distance myself.
When I came back to Stanford in the
spring,l did what everybody advised me to
do: change direction and get out of the
way. It is really important for a new per
son to shape the job in his own way, and to
make his own decisions. I've tried very
hard to provide that independence.
SW: Much of the media review of Casper's
first year has said that Stanford's image

has improved under him. Part of the im
plication is that prior to his arrival, Stan
ford's image was very low, and the morale
was very low. Do you think that is an inac
curate reading of your time here? Does
that bother you at all, when you see things
like that?
Kennedy: I suppose everyone has his
own view about how an institution is far
ing We took a rough pounding during and
after the indirect-cost hearings. My sense
is that what we are witnessing is a funda
mentally healthy institution making ex
actly the kind of recovery you would ex
pect. So I don't take that as a personal neg
ative at all.
There's no question that Stanford's repu
tation will improve. It will improve because
Stanford's case will look better and the gov
ernment's case will look worse as time goes
on, because our case was pretty good.
SW: With the new administration in
Washington, what are the kinds of changes
you see in the way higher education deals
with the government?
Kennedy I think it's early times yet, but
there's no question that this president, de

spite the hostile media attention to every
misstep, is making record legislative
progress so far. The public service bill,
which is profoundly important to higher
education, has gone very well. So we're
going to see some important and interest
ing changes.
There will be some changes with the re
search agencies with which Stanford has
very important relationships. I think that
by and large, the changes will be positive
for higher education in general and for
Stanford in particular.
But, and this is a big but, this adminis
tration is properly concerned with the des
perate urgency of deficit reduction. So no

one should look for significant increases in
the availability of research funds, no one
should look for dramatic improvements in
our indirect cost rate, no one should look
for important new student aid programs.
Bottom line: it's going to be a very, very
tough time economically for higher educa
tion, though I don't think national policies
will be fundamentally unfriendly to it. It's
that we're starting to pay off for the 12
binge years from 1980-1992.
SW: Is Stanford still paying that price ?
Uou> long are we going to feel the squeeze ?
Kennedy: We are paying the price. But in
terestingly enough, despite having two
rather special problems, namely the earth
quake, which was devastating to out physi
cal plant, and the indirect-cost controversy,
which will certainly turn out to have been
expensive for us, we are not in worse finan
cial shape than most of the universities in
our universe of quality comparison.
