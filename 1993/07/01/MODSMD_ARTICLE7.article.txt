# the 						problems and promise
## of the 'Summer of Service' 
### 
Spotlights, giant video screens, a
Hollywood comedian, uniformed
soldiers, a gospel choir, and up
lifting speeches. Not exactly the
first images that come to mind
when the words "public service" are men
tioned, but in the era of Clinton, that's the
way things go.
The nearly three-hour closing ceremony
for the inaugural class of President Clin
ton's experimental Summer of Service was
a grand spectacle. But like the program it
self, Thursday's ceremony — held in a big
waterfront warehouse in Fort Mason, San
Francisco — had its flaws.
A torch was passed down a line of 25 pro
gram participants standing shoulder to shoul
der, and the final student — a young black
woman from Harlem — approached a larger
torch in the middle of the stage. The central
torch, symbolizing the corporate unity of the
hundreds of people nationwide involved in the
Summer of Service,
wouldn't light.

As the woman re
turned to the line
with her still lighted
torch, students from
her hometown
cheered. The audi
ence laughed, half in
amusement, half in
frustration. It was a
fitting ending to the
week and a telling
beginning to a pro-

gram filled with both problems and
promise.
"It was a difficult week," said Greg
Ricks, former Stanford multicultural edu
cator who now serves as vice-president of
Boston's City Year program, "but a very
important week It was challenging, and
we learned a lot."
Ricks is only one link of the strong chain
which connects Summer of Service with the
extended Stanford community. Catherine
Milton, founder and former director of the
Haas Center for Public Service, is the exec
utive director of the president's Commis
sion on National Community Service and
one of the driving forces in the Summer of
Service.
The Haas Center itself, along with UC-
Berkeley, form the hub of the Bay Area's
participation in the national program. And
more than 30 Stanford students will take
part in Summer of Service in both the Bay
Area and throughout the country.
Just like most other participants, Stan
ford students have encountered problems
with the fledgling program.
Many outside the program question the
motivation and dedication of the students.
Others insist that something as localized as
community service cannot be instituted by a
national, especially a federal, program. Still
others point to the week of training itself,
calling it inefficient and unsuccessful. Such
problems lurked behind last week's pep rally.

Thinking about tomorrow
President Clinton's plan for the Sum
mer of Service began as a popular campaign
theme, attractive to the middle class be
cause it promised to exchange work in pub
lic service with federal grants to help pay
for quickly rising college tuition.
Then, Clinton talked of a scholarship
for-service program which would help with
college tuition or loans by paying students
minimum wage for year-round public ser
vice jobs — approximately $5,000 which
would go directly to the student's college or
creditor.
Perhaps as a springboard for this pro
gram, perhaps as an evolution of it, Clinton
then introduced the Summer of Service.
Under the program, students aged 17-25
work full time for nine-and-a-half weeks
during the summer in minimum-wage
($4.25 per hour) public service jobs. In ad
dition, at the end of the summer, each stu
dent gets a $1,000 educational voucher
which can be used to pay tuition or repay
college loans.
This summer's program costs the gov
ernment $8.8 million, a fraction of the
eventual cost for future summers. This

summer is intended as a pilot for the pro
gram, probing both its weak and strong
points with a relatively small sample of par
ticipants.
Clinton's program seems modeled after
City Year, a public service program which
already offers opportunities of scholarship
for-service. City Year, one of the Summer of
Service local programs, is employing nine
Stanford students this summer, according
to Ricks.
While Summer of Service was a federal
brainchild, its backbone is comprised of
outposts located in cities throughout the
nation. The students work for and get paid
by programs instituted by these smaller or
ganizations, which get grant money from
the government.
More than 400 community public service
programs all over the country submitted pro
posals to join the program for this summer. Six
teen were accepted, including the Bay Area's
entry, the East Bay Conservation Corps.
A community service agency located in
Oakland, the Corps chose Stanford and UC-
Berkeley as their college affiliates. Director
Joanna Lennon said Stanford was a logical
choice for her organization.
"I had a good relationship with Cather
ine Milton," said Lennon. "I knew the folks
at Haas really knew the point of this, so
when I saw the requirement of working
with an institution of higher education, I
immediately called Haas."
Sue Gray, a program coordinator at
Haas and its Summer of Service program
director, said Stanford was likely selected
over other Bay Area colleges because of its
strong nationwide reputation as a leader in
public service.
The Bay Area program is the largest of
the 16 programs nationwide. The Bay Area
will receive the largest grant of any of the
programs, with a budget expected to run be-

tween $1-1.5
million. Ap
proximately
250 students
will take part in
the Bay Area's
projects, includ
ing more than

30 in East Palo Alto programs alone.
"There is a lot of Stanford involvement
in Summer of Service, either in leadership
or other involved
roles," said Milton.

The Bay Area of
fers many specific pro
jects in the three pro
gram centers of Oak
land, Berkeley and
East Palo Alto. Ac
cording to Bernadette
Chi, a Corps program
manager for Summer
of Service who gradu
ated from Stanford
two years ago, the Bay
Area programs include

• Project YES (Youth Engaging in Ser
vice), which helps develop curricula and tu
toring in Oakland middle schools,
• a health program in Oakland and
Berkeley which provide aid at sites such as
children's hospitals and homeless shelters,
• an educational program which will
work in Oakland libraries and other chil
dren's development and resource centers in
the East Bay and
• SOAR (Students Offering Alternative
Realities), a Stanford-student-developed
tutoring and mentoring program in East
Palo Alto.
While SOAR is the only East Palo Alto pro
gram run out of Haas, Stanford was responsi
ble for all Stanford-area recruitment, includ
ing reviewing and appointing applicants, in
cluding students from East Palo Alto as well
as Stanford and other local colleges.
While other programs nationwide focus
on topics such as health care and the envi
ronment, the East Palo Alto programs are
all educationally focused.
Reality check
In order to get the young people ready
for their Summer of Service — both to get
them excited and to provide some training

national, the present
times call for action
at home. "With each
day's work, you will
be building Ameri
ca's future and build
ing your future.... I
expect you to change
the world."
"To feel the energy
of such an incredible,
diverse group of young
people was phenome-

— all 1,500 students were brought to Trea
sure Island in San Francisco Bay for six
days of "boot camp" June 20-25.
"We need you," Milton told the assem
bled group on their first day of training.
"You're here to serve. You're here to make
a difference in the lives of children back
home who really need you. You're here to
give hope to our nation."
Vice President A 1 Gore even got in on the
rallying cries. "You'll be able to tell your
grandchildren someday that you were here
on the first day," Gore told the group on
Monday of the week of training, comparing
Summer of Service to the start of the Peace
Corps in 1961, but adding that while that
program was inter-

nal,"Gray said, and then added, "But there
were rough points. Any time you take 1,500
people to boot camp, issues will come up."
The "issues" soon began to cloud over the
idealistic energy that was being fostered.
"There was a lot of tension," said Leyda
Garcia, a Stanford sophomore from Los Ange
les. "There were racial problems, people feeling
like they weren't represented, things like that.
There were lots of fights and people crying."
Priscilla Wu, another Stanford sopho
more who will be working in the East Bay,
said that physical needs such as lack of
water, air conditioning or food for vegetari-

ans added
to the real
problems,
which had
to do with
structure
and cur-

riculum.
Many claimed that it should be the people
in the community that controlled it, rather
than following instructions from a totally
uninvolved Washington.
"The stuff we were learning isn't really
helping us for when we go back to our local
programs," said Wu. Many participants re
flected similar frustration that the program
was focusing too much on the program as a na
tional phenomenon rather than as a local one.
But according to Gray, problems such as
that were because the White House was mak
ing decisions about the week without being
there to see the real needs and concerns.
"People stayed up all night talking about
things," said Garcia. "We had these ques
tions that had to be answered." And the
training wasn't doing enough to answer
them, according to most people, and the
students didn't have enough time to find
out for themselves.
"I know people were very unhappy about
the kind of rigorous schedule, and going
into it I knew that was a recipe for disas
ter," said Gray. "And it finally broke."
"We organized a revolt," said Wu. "We
weren't going to go to stuff." But instead,
members of the administration and plan
ning staff met with the students, and
changes were made to improve conditions.
Wu and others seemed genuinely pleased,
not so much that the needs were met as
much as because the administration lis
tened.
"We took collective action," Stanford
sophomore Lisa Gallegos told the assem
bled group at the closing ceremonies. "We
created change this week."
"That was incredibly positive," said
Gray. "The participants really took control
of the situation and said look, you need to
be responsive to us. You need to listen to
our concerns and recognize that everything
you put together is not working."
"It was a reality check for the Washing
ton bureaucrats. Wake up — this is the new
generation and we need to be attentive to
them... I think it's a veiy different reality

than what they're used to."
"Diversity takes time," said Ricks, who
pointed out that spending time in the di
verse community was a learning process in
itself, training the participants for the di
verse communities in which they would be
spending their summers.
Chi agreed that the week was incredibly
positive in spite, and even because of the
problems. "People learned how to interact
with respect and saw the pain when there is
no respect," said Chi.

Service over money

With the results from Treasure Island
in, questions remain. Can these students
really have any impact? Are they participat
ing for the money or for the opportunity at
public service?
While the first question should be par
tially answered by the end of the summer,
the second is already being answered by the
students themselves.
"This is not just to gain money for col
lege, but to begin caring for my world," said
Christopher Sorhaindo from Montclair,
New Jersey, during a service project held
one day of the training week.
Motioning to an East Palo Alto youth
slowly but intently painting part of the
Ravenswood Elementary School, Sorhain
do added, "I remember being in their place,
and you really need someone to guide you."
"The money and the service complement
one another," said Maisie Chin, a 1993
graduate of UCLA and a member of a Los
Angeles Summer of Service program.
"Many view going to college as a way to give
back to their community."
Chin prodded at a weed with her hoe for
a moment and added, "I had my doubts
[about the sincerity of the participants), but
the more I talk to them, the more I realize
that they want to get at it and do it well. Peo
ple on my team have gotten out of neighbor
hoods, and now they want to give back."
"The main purpose is to instill an ethic of
service," said Milton. "Often this is not pos
sible for someone from middle- or low-in
come background without some kind of
stipend or income."
Gray pointed out that the money that the
students earn over the summer is much less
than many could have earned in other jobs,
adding that the $1,000 bonus is nice but
"not the engine that drives the program."
According to Chi, the money that is
earned is simply a way to attach value to
public service. "It's hard to find jobs where
you feel like you're giving back to the com
munity," she said. "This is a perfect way to
invest in our community."
From this summer's pilot program,
Clinton plans to learn of relative strengths
and weaknesses to help rebuild future
Summers of Service. Next year, a proposed
$400 million is to be used to place 25,000
young adults in public service. By 1997, an
estimated 150,000 youths will be involved.
Clinton's program has the stated goal of
both centralizing aid for college students
and getting people involved in public ser
vice. "Public service means educational op
portunity" reads one of Clinton's slogans.
Hut congressional approval and other
roadblocks may confront Clinton in the fu
ture. Questions of applicant criteria have
also come into play, with some claiming
that those in greater financial need should
be given preference for the program. But
Clinton claims that a successful smaller
scale pilot summer will be able to dissuade
the nay-sayers.
With the future of Clinton's programs
securely fastened to their backs, the week
ended with 1,475 students going back to
their individual communities to begin their
projects. Whether they feed the hungry, im
munize the sick, clean up dirty shorelines
or tutor the disadvantaged, all will discover
that they have the ability to make a differ
ence, according to Chin.
"It's a very empowering program," said
Chin, still picking at the weed in East Palo
Alto. "It taps into the power of young peo
ple. And it's not just about public service.
It's about understanding your place in the
community. It's about seeing that you can
do something."

motivation and dedication of the students.
Others insist that something as localized as
community service cannot be instituted by a
national, especially a federal, program. Still
others point to the week of training itself,
calling it inefficient and unsuccessful. Such
problems lurked behind last week's pep rally.

Thinking about tomorrow
President Clinton's plan for the Sum
mer of Service began as a popular campaign
theme, attractive to the middle class be
cause it promised to exchange work in pub
lic service with federal grants to help pay
for quickly rising college tuition.
Then, Clinton talked of a scholarship
for-service program which would help with
college tuition or loans by paying students
minimum wage for year-round public ser
vice jobs — approximately $5,000 which
would go directly to the student's college or
creditor.
Perhaps as a springboard for this pro
gram, perhaps as an evolution of it, Clinton
then introduced the Summer of Service.
Under the program, students aged 17-25
work full time for nine-and-a-half weeks
during the summer in minimum-wage
($4.25 per hour) public service jobs. In ad
dition, at the end of the summer, each stu
dent gets a $1,000 educational voucher
which can be used to pay tuition or repay
college loans.
This summer's program costs the gov
ernment $8.8 million, a fraction of the
eventual cost for future summers. This

summer is intended as a pilot for the pro
gram, probing both its weak and strong
points with a relatively small sample of par
ticipants.
Clinton's program seems modeled after
City Year, a public service program which
already offers opportunities of scholarship
for-service. City Year, one of the Summer of
Service local programs, is employing nine
Stanford students this summer, according
to Ricks.
While Summer of Service was a federal
brainchild, its backbone is comprised of
outposts located in cities throughout the
nation. The students work for and get paid
by programs instituted by these smaller or
ganizations, which get grant money from
the government.
More than 400 community public service
programs all over the country submitted pro
posals to join the program for this summer. Six
teen were accepted, including the Bay Area's
entry, the East Bay Conservation Corps.
A community service agency located in
Oakland, the Corps chose Stanford and UC-
Berkeley as their college affiliates. Director
Joanna Lennon said Stanford was a logical
choice for her organization.
"I had a good relationship with Cather
ine Milton," said Lennon. "I knew the folks
at Haas really knew the point of this, so
when I saw the requirement of working
with an institution of higher education, I
immediately called Haas."
Sue Gray, a program coordinator at
Haas and its Summer of Service program
director, said Stanford was likely selected
over other Bay Area colleges because of its
strong nationwide reputation as a leader in
public service.
The Bay Area program is the largest of
the 16 programs nationwide. The Bay Area
will receive the largest grant of any of the
programs, with a budget expected to run be-

tween $1-1.5
million. Ap
proximately
250 students
will take part in
the Bay Area's
projects, includ
ing more than

30 in East Palo Alto programs alone.
"There is a lot of Stanford involvement
in Summer of Service, either in leadership
or other involved
roles," said Milton.

The Bay Area of
fers many specific pro
jects in the three pro
gram centers of Oak
land, Berkeley and
East Palo Alto. Ac
cording to Bernadette
Chi, a Corps program
manager for Summer
of Service who gradu
ated from Stanford
two years ago, the Bay
Area programs include

• Project YES (Youth Engaging in Ser
vice), which helps develop curricula and tu
toring in Oakland middle schools,
• a health program in Oakland and
Berkeley which provide aid at sites such as
children's hospitals and homeless shelters,
• an educational program which will
work in Oakland libraries and other chil
dren's development and resource centers in
the East Bay and
• SOAR (Students Offering Alternative
Realities), a Stanford-student-developed
tutoring and mentoring program in East
Palo Alto.
While SOAR is the only East Palo Alto pro
gram run out of Haas, Stanford was responsi
ble for all Stanford-area recruitment, includ
ing reviewing and appointing applicants, in
cluding students from East Palo Alto as well
as Stanford and other local colleges.
While other programs nationwide focus
on topics such as health care and the envi
ronment, the East Palo Alto programs are
all educationally focused.
Reality check
In order to get the young people ready
for their Summer of Service — both to get
them excited and to provide some training

national, the present
times call for action
at home. "With each
day's work, you will
be building Ameri
ca's future and build
ing your future.... I
expect you to change
the world."
"To feel the energy
of such an incredible,
diverse group of young
people was phenome-

— all 1,500 students were brought to Trea
sure Island in San Francisco Bay for six
days of "boot camp" June 20-25.
"We need you," Milton told the assem
bled group on their first day of training.
"You're here to serve. You're here to make
a difference in the lives of children back
home who really need you. You're here to
give hope to our nation."
Vice President A 1 Gore even got in on the
rallying cries. "You'll be able to tell your
grandchildren someday that you were here
on the first day," Gore told the group on
Monday of the week of training, comparing
Summer of Service to the start of the Peace
Corps in 1961, but adding that while that
program was inter-

nal,"Gray said, and then added, "But there
were rough points. Any time you take 1,500
people to boot camp, issues will come up."
The "issues" soon began to cloud over the
idealistic energy that was being fostered.
"There was a lot of tension," said Leyda
Garcia, a Stanford sophomore from Los Ange
les. "There were racial problems, people feeling
like they weren't represented, things like that.
There were lots of fights and people crying."
Priscilla Wu, another Stanford sopho
more who will be working in the East Bay,
said that physical needs such as lack of
water, air conditioning or food for vegetari-

ans added
to the real
problems,
which had
to do with
structure
and cur-

riculum.
Many claimed that it should be the people
in the community that controlled it, rather
than following instructions from a totally
uninvolved Washington.
"The stuff we were learning isn't really
helping us for when we go back to our local
programs," said Wu. Many participants re
flected similar frustration that the program
was focusing too much on the program as a na
tional phenomenon rather than as a local one.
But according to Gray, problems such as
that were because the White House was mak
ing decisions about the week without being
there to see the real needs and concerns.
"People stayed up all night talking about
things," said Garcia. "We had these ques
tions that had to be answered." And the
training wasn't doing enough to answer
them, according to most people, and the
students didn't have enough time to find
out for themselves.
"I know people were very unhappy about
the kind of rigorous schedule, and going
into it I knew that was a recipe for disas
ter," said Gray. "And it finally broke."
"We organized a revolt," said Wu. "We
weren't going to go to stuff." But instead,
members of the administration and plan
ning staff met with the students, and
changes were made to improve conditions.
Wu and others seemed genuinely pleased,
not so much that the needs were met as
much as because the administration lis
tened.
"We took collective action," Stanford
sophomore Lisa Gallegos told the assem
bled group at the closing ceremonies. "We
created change this week."
"That was incredibly positive," said
Gray. "The participants really took control
of the situation and said look, you need to
be responsive to us. You need to listen to
our concerns and recognize that everything
you put together is not working."
"It was a reality check for the Washing
ton bureaucrats. Wake up — this is the new
generation and we need to be attentive to
them... I think it's a veiy different reality

than what they're used to."
"Diversity takes time," said Ricks, who
pointed out that spending time in the di
verse community was a learning process in
itself, training the participants for the di
verse communities in which they would be
spending their summers.
Chi agreed that the week was incredibly
positive in spite, and even because of the
problems. "People learned how to interact
with respect and saw the pain when there is
no respect," said Chi.

Service over money

With the results from Treasure Island
in, questions remain. Can these students
really have any impact? Are they participat
ing for the money or for the opportunity at
public service?
While the first question should be par
tially answered by the end of the summer,
the second is already being answered by the
students themselves.
"This is not just to gain money for col
lege, but to begin caring for my world," said
Christopher Sorhaindo from Montclair,
New Jersey, during a service project held
one day of the training week.
Motioning to an East Palo Alto youth
slowly but intently painting part of the
Ravenswood Elementary School, Sorhain
do added, "I remember being in their place,
and you really need someone to guide you."
"The money and the service complement
one another," said Maisie Chin, a 1993
graduate of UCLA and a member of a Los
Angeles Summer of Service program.
"Many view going to college as a way to give
back to their community."
Chin prodded at a weed with her hoe for
a moment and added, "I had my doubts
[about the sincerity of the participants), but
the more I talk to them, the more I realize
that they want to get at it and do it well. Peo
ple on my team have gotten out of neighbor
hoods, and now they want to give back."
"The main purpose is to instill an ethic of
service," said Milton. "Often this is not pos
sible for someone from middle- or low-in
come background without some kind of
stipend or income."
Gray pointed out that the money that the
students earn over the summer is much less
than many could have earned in other jobs,
adding that the $1,000 bonus is nice but
"not the engine that drives the program."
According to Chi, the money that is
earned is simply a way to attach value to
public service. "It's hard to find jobs where
you feel like you're giving back to the com
munity," she said. "This is a perfect way to
invest in our community."
From this summer's pilot program,
Clinton plans to learn of relative strengths
and weaknesses to help rebuild future
Summers of Service. Next year, a proposed
$400 million is to be used to place 25,000
young adults in public service. By 1997, an
estimated 150,000 youths will be involved.
Clinton's program has the stated goal of
both centralizing aid for college students
and getting people involved in public ser
vice. "Public service means educational op
portunity" reads one of Clinton's slogans.
Hut congressional approval and other
roadblocks may confront Clinton in the fu
ture. Questions of applicant criteria have
also come into play, with some claiming
that those in greater financial need should
be given preference for the program. But
Clinton claims that a successful smaller
scale pilot summer will be able to dissuade
the nay-sayers.
With the future of Clinton's programs
securely fastened to their backs, the week
ended with 1,475 students going back to
their individual communities to begin their
projects. Whether they feed the hungry, im
munize the sick, clean up dirty shorelines
or tutor the disadvantaged, all will discover
that they have the ability to make a differ
ence, according to Chin.
"It's a very empowering program," said
Chin, still picking at the weed in East Palo
Alto. "It taps into the power of young peo
ple. And it's not just about public service.
It's about understanding your place in the
community. It's about seeing that you can
do something."

Spotlights, giant video screens, a
Hollywood comedian, uniformed
soldiers, a gospel choir, and up
lifting speeches. Not exactly the
first images that come to mind
when the words "public service" are men
tioned, but in the era of Clinton, that's the
way things go.
The nearly three-hour closing ceremony
for the inaugural class of President Clin
ton's experimental Summer of Service was
a grand spectacle. But like the program it
self, Thursday's ceremony — held in a big
waterfront warehouse in Fort Mason, San
Francisco — had its flaws.
A torch was passed down a line of 25 pro
gram participants standing shoulder to shoul
der, and the final student — a young black
woman from Harlem — approached a larger
torch in the middle of the stage. The central
torch, symbolizing the corporate unity of the
hundreds of people nationwide involved in the
Summer of Service,
wouldn't light.

As the woman re
turned to the line
with her still lighted
torch, students from
her hometown
cheered. The audi
ence laughed, half in
amusement, half in
frustration. It was a
fitting ending to the
week and a telling
beginning to a pro-

gram filled with both problems and
promise.
"It was a difficult week," said Greg
Ricks, former Stanford multicultural edu
cator who now serves as vice-president of
Boston's City Year program, "but a very
important week It was challenging, and
we learned a lot."
Ricks is only one link of the strong chain
which connects Summer of Service with the
extended Stanford community. Catherine
Milton, founder and former director of the
Haas Center for Public Service, is the exec
utive director of the president's Commis
sion on National Community Service and
one of the driving forces in the Summer of
Service.
The Haas Center itself, along with UC-
Berkeley, form the hub of the Bay Area's
participation in the national program. And
more than 30 Stanford students will take
part in Summer of Service in both the Bay
Area and throughout the country.
Just like most other participants, Stan
ford students have encountered problems
with the fledgling program.
Many outside the program question the
motivation and dedication of the students.
Others insist that something as localized as
community service cannot be instituted by a
national, especially a federal, program. Still
others point to the week of training itself,

teen were accepted, including the Bay Area's
entry, the East Bay Conservation Corps.
A community service agency located in
Oakland, the Corps chose Stanford and UC-
Berkeley as their college affiliates. Director
Joanna Lennon said Stanford was a logical
choice for her organization.
"I had a good relationship with Cather
ine Milton," said Lennon. "I knew the folks
at Haas really knew the point of this, so
when I saw the requirement of working
with an institution of higher education, I
immediately called Haas."
Sue Gray, a program coordinator at
Haas and its Summer of Service program
director, said Stanford was likely selected
over other Bay Area colleges because of its
strong nationwide reputation as a leader in
public service.
The Bay Area program is the largest of
the 16 programs nationwide. The Bay Area
will receive the largest grant of any of the
programs, with a budget expected to run be-

tween $1-1.5
million. Ap
proximately
250 students
will take part in
the Bay Area's
projects, includ
ing more than

30 in East Palo Alto programs alone.
"There is a lot of Stanford involvement
in Summer of Service, either in leadership
or other involved
roles," said Milton.

The Bay Area of
fers many specific pro
jects in the three pro
gram centers of Oak
land, Berkeley and
East Palo Alto. Ac
cording to Bernadette
Chi, a Corps program
manager for Summer
of Service who gradu
ated from Stanford
two years ago, the Bay
Area programs include

• Project YES (Youth Engaging in Ser
vice), which helps develop curricula and tu
toring in Oakland middle schools,
• a health program in Oakland and
Berkeley which provide aid at sites such as
children's hospitals and homeless shelters,
• an educational program which will
work in Oakland libraries and other chil
dren's development and resource centers in
the East Bay and
• SOAR (Students Offering Alternative
Realities), a Stanford-student-developed
tutoring and mentoring program in East
Palo Alto.
While SOAR is the only East Palo Alto pro
gram run out of Haas, Stanford was responsi
ble for all Stanford-area recruitment, includ
ing reviewing and appointing applicants, in
cluding students from East Palo Alto as well
as Stanford and other local colleges.
While other programs nationwide focus
on topics such as health care and the envi
ronment, the East Palo Alto programs are
all educationally focused.
Reality check
In order to get the young people ready
for their Summer of Service — both to get
them excited and to provide some training

national, the present
times call for action
at home. "With each
day's work, you will
be building Ameri
ca's future and build
ing your future.... I
expect you to change
the world."
"To feel the energy
of such an incredible,
diverse group of young
people was phenome-

— all 1,500 students were brought to Trea
sure Island in San Francisco Bay for six
days of "boot camp" June 20-25.
"We need you," Milton told the assem
bled group on their first day of training.
"You're here to serve. You're here to make
a difference in the lives of children back
home who really need you. You're here to
give hope to our nation."
Vice President A 1 Gore even got in on the
rallying cries. "You'll be able to tell your
grandchildren someday that you were here
on the first day," Gore told the group on
Monday of the week of training, comparing
Summer of Service to the start of the Peace
Corps in 1961, but adding that while that
program was inter-

nal,"Gray said, and then added, "But there
were rough points. Any time you take 1,500
people to boot camp, issues will come up."
The "issues" soon began to cloud over the
idealistic energy that was being fostered.
"There was a lot of tension," said Leyda
Garcia, a Stanford sophomore from Los Ange
les. "There were racial problems, people feeling
like they weren't represented, things like that.
There were lots of fights and people crying."
Priscilla Wu, another Stanford sopho
more who will be working in the East Bay,
said that physical needs such as lack of
water, air conditioning or food for vegetari-

ans added
to the real
problems,
which had
to do with
structure
and cur-

riculum.
Many claimed that it should be the people
in the community that controlled it, rather
than following instructions from a totally
uninvolved Washington.
"The stuff we were learning isn't really
helping us for when we go back to our local
programs," said Wu. Many participants re
flected similar frustration that the program
was focusing too much on the program as a na
tional phenomenon rather than as a local one.
But according to Gray, problems such as
that were because the White House was mak
ing decisions about the week without being
there to see the real needs and concerns.
"People stayed up all night talking about
things," said Garcia. "We had these ques
tions that had to be answered." And the
training wasn't doing enough to answer
them, according to most people, and the
students didn't have enough time to find
out for themselves.
"I know people were very unhappy about
the kind of rigorous schedule, and going
into it I knew that was a recipe for disas
ter," said Gray. "And it finally broke."
"We organized a revolt," said Wu. "We
weren't going to go to stuff." But instead,
members of the administration and plan
ning staff met with the students, and
changes were made to improve conditions.
Wu and others seemed genuinely pleased,
not so much that the needs were met as
much as because the administration lis
tened.
"We took collective action," Stanford
sophomore Lisa Gallegos told the assem
bled group at the closing ceremonies. "We
created change this week."
"That was incredibly positive," said
Gray. "The participants really took control
of the situation and said look, you need to
be responsive to us. You need to listen to
our concerns and recognize that everything
you put together is not working."
"It was a reality check for the Washing
ton bureaucrats. Wake up — this is the new
generation and we need to be attentive to
them... I think it's a veiy different reality

than what they're used to."
"Diversity takes time," said Ricks, who
pointed out that spending time in the di
verse community was a learning process in
itself, training the participants for the di
verse communities in which they would be
spending their summers.
Chi agreed that the week was incredibly
positive in spite, and even because of the
problems. "People learned how to interact
with respect and saw the pain when there is
no respect," said Chi.

Service over money

With the results from Treasure Island
in, questions remain. Can these students
really have any impact? Are they participat
ing for the money or for the opportunity at
public service?
While the first question should be par
tially answered by the end of the summer,
the second is already being answered by the
students themselves.
"This is not just to gain money for col
lege, but to begin caring for my world," said
Christopher Sorhaindo from Montclair,
New Jersey, during a service project held
one day of the training week.
Motioning to an East Palo Alto youth
slowly but intently painting part of the
Ravenswood Elementary School, Sorhain
do added, "I remember being in their place,
and you really need someone to guide you."
"The money and the service complement
one another," said Maisie Chin, a 1993
graduate of UCLA and a member of a Los
Angeles Summer of Service program.
"Many view going to college as a way to give
back to their community."
Chin prodded at a weed with her hoe for
a moment and added, "I had my doubts
[about the sincerity of the participants), but
the more I talk to them, the more I realize
that they want to get at it and do it well. Peo
ple on my team have gotten out of neighbor
hoods, and now they want to give back."
"The main purpose is to instill an ethic of
service," said Milton. "Often this is not pos
sible for someone from middle- or low-in
come background without some kind of
stipend or income."
Gray pointed out that the money that the
students earn over the summer is much less
than many could have earned in other jobs,
adding that the $1,000 bonus is nice but
"not the engine that drives the program."
According to Chi, the money that is
earned is simply a way to attach value to
public service. "It's hard to find jobs where
you feel like you're giving back to the com
munity," she said. "This is a perfect way to
invest in our community."
From this summer's pilot program,
Clinton plans to learn of relative strengths
and weaknesses to help rebuild future
Summers of Service. Next year, a proposed
$400 million is to be used to place 25,000
young adults in public service. By 1997, an
estimated 150,000 youths will be involved.
Clinton's program has the stated goal of
both centralizing aid for college students
and getting people involved in public ser
vice. "Public service means educational op
portunity" reads one of Clinton's slogans.
Hut congressional approval and other
roadblocks may confront Clinton in the fu
ture. Questions of applicant criteria have
also come into play, with some claiming
that those in greater financial need should
be given preference for the program. But
Clinton claims that a successful smaller
scale pilot summer will be able to dissuade
the nay-sayers.
With the future of Clinton's programs
securely fastened to their backs, the week
ended with 1,475 students going back to
their individual communities to begin their
projects. Whether they feed the hungry, im
munize the sick, clean up dirty shorelines
or tutor the disadvantaged, all will discover
that they have the ability to make a differ
ence, according to Chin.
"It's a very empowering program," said
Chin, still picking at the weed in East Palo
Alto. "It taps into the power of young peo
ple. And it's not just about public service.
It's about understanding your place in the
community. It's about seeing that you can
do something."

Spotlights, giant video screens, a
Hollywood comedian, uniformed
soldiers, a gospel choir, and up
lifting speeches. Not exactly the
first images that come to mind
when the words "public service" are men
tioned, but in the era of Clinton, that's the
way things go.
The nearly three-hour closing ceremony
for the inaugural class of President Clin
ton's experimental Summer of Service was
a grand spectacle. But like the program it
self, Thursday's ceremony — held in a big
waterfront warehouse in Fort Mason, San
Francisco — had its flaws.
A torch was passed down a line of 25 pro
gram participants standing shoulder to shoul
der, and the final student — a young black
woman from Harlem — approached a larger
torch in the middle of the stage. The central
torch, symbolizing the corporate unity of the
hundreds of people nationwide involved in the
Summer of Service,
wouldn't light.

As the woman re
turned to the line
with her still lighted
torch, students from
her hometown
cheered. The audi
ence laughed, half in
amusement, half in
frustration. It was a
fitting ending to the
week and a telling
beginning to a pro-

gram filled with both problems and
promise.
"It was a difficult week," said Greg
Ricks, former Stanford multicultural edu
cator who now serves as vice-president of
Boston's City Year program, "but a very
important week It was challenging, and
we learned a lot."
Ricks is only one link of the strong chain
which connects Summer of Service with the
extended Stanford community. Catherine
Milton, founder and former director of the
Haas Center for Public Service, is the exec
utive director of the president's Commis
sion on National Community Service and
one of the driving forces in the Summer of
Service.
The Haas Center itself, along with UC-
Berkeley, form the hub of the Bay Area's
participation in the national program. And
more than 30 Stanford students will take
part in Summer of Service in both the Bay
Area and throughout the country.
Just like most other participants, Stan
ford students have encountered problems
with the fledgling program.
Many outside the program question the
motivation and dedication of the students.
Others insist that something as localized as
community service cannot be instituted by a
national, especially a federal, program. Still
others point to the week of training itself,
calling it inefficient and unsuccessful. Such
problems lurked behind last week's pep rally.

Thinking about tomorrow
President Clinton's plan for the Sum
mer of Service began as a popular campaign
theme, attractive to the middle class be
cause it promised to exchange work in pub
lic service with federal grants to help pay
for quickly rising college tuition.
Then, Clinton talked of a scholarship
for-service program which would help with
college tuition or loans by paying students
minimum wage for year-round public ser
vice jobs — approximately $5,000 which
would go directly to the student's college or
creditor.
Perhaps as a springboard for this pro
gram, perhaps as an evolution of it, Clinton
then introduced the Summer of Service.
Under the program, students aged 17-25
work full time for nine-and-a-half weeks
during the summer in minimum-wage
($4.25 per hour) public service jobs. In ad
dition, at the end of the summer, each stu
dent gets a $1,000 educational voucher
which can be used to pay tuition or repay
college loans.
This summer's program costs the gov
ernment $8.8 million, a fraction of the
eventual cost for future summers. This

summer is intended as a pilot for the pro
gram, probing both its weak and strong
points with a relatively small sample of par
ticipants.
Clinton's program seems modeled after
City Year, a public service program which
already offers opportunities of scholarship
for-service. City Year, one of the Summer of
Service local programs, is employing nine
Stanford students this summer, according
to Ricks.
While Summer of Service was a federal
brainchild, its backbone is comprised of
outposts located in cities throughout the
nation. The students work for and get paid
by programs instituted by these smaller or
ganizations, which get grant money from
the government.
More than 400 community public service
programs all over the country submitted pro
posals to join the program for this summer. Six
teen were accepted, including the Bay Area's
entry, the East Bay Conservation Corps.
A community service agency located in
Oakland, the Corps chose Stanford and UC-

ing reviewing and appointing applicants, in
cluding students from East Palo Alto as well
as Stanford and other local colleges.
While other programs nationwide focus
on topics such as health care and the envi
ronment, the East Palo Alto programs are
all educationally focused.
Reality check
In order to get the young people ready
for their Summer of Service — both to get
them excited and to provide some training

national, the present
times call for action
at home. "With each
day's work, you will
be building Ameri
ca's future and build
ing your future.... I
expect you to change
the world."
"To feel the energy
of such an incredible,
diverse group of young
people was phenome-

— all 1,500 students were brought to Trea
sure Island in San Francisco Bay for six
days of "boot camp" June 20-25.
"We need you," Milton told the assem
bled group on their first day of training.
"You're here to serve. You're here to make
a difference in the lives of children back
home who really need you. You're here to
give hope to our nation."
Vice President A 1 Gore even got in on the
rallying cries. "You'll be able to tell your
grandchildren someday that you were here
on the first day," Gore told the group on
Monday of the week of training, comparing
Summer of Service to the start of the Peace
Corps in 1961, but adding that while that
program was inter-

nal,"Gray said, and then added, "But there
were rough points. Any time you take 1,500
people to boot camp, issues will come up."
The "issues" soon began to cloud over the
idealistic energy that was being fostered.
"There was a lot of tension," said Leyda
Garcia, a Stanford sophomore from Los Ange
les. "There were racial problems, people feeling
like they weren't represented, things like that.
There were lots of fights and people crying."
Priscilla Wu, another Stanford sopho
more who will be working in the East Bay,
said that physical needs such as lack of
water, air conditioning or food for vegetari-

ans added
to the real
problems,
which had
to do with
structure
and cur-

riculum.
Many claimed that it should be the people
in the community that controlled it, rather
than following instructions from a totally
uninvolved Washington.
"The stuff we were learning isn't really
helping us for when we go back to our local
programs," said Wu. Many participants re
flected similar frustration that the program
was focusing too much on the program as a na
tional phenomenon rather than as a local one.
But according to Gray, problems such as
that were because the White House was mak
ing decisions about the week without being
there to see the real needs and concerns.
"People stayed up all night talking about
things," said Garcia. "We had these ques
tions that had to be answered." And the
training wasn't doing enough to answer
them, according to most people, and the
students didn't have enough time to find
out for themselves.
"I know people were very unhappy about
the kind of rigorous schedule, and going
into it I knew that was a recipe for disas
ter," said Gray. "And it finally broke."
"We organized a revolt," said Wu. "We
weren't going to go to stuff." But instead,
members of the administration and plan
ning staff met with the students, and
changes were made to improve conditions.
Wu and others seemed genuinely pleased,
not so much that the needs were met as
much as because the administration lis
tened.
"We took collective action," Stanford
sophomore Lisa Gallegos told the assem
bled group at the closing ceremonies. "We
created change this week."
"That was incredibly positive," said
Gray. "The participants really took control
of the situation and said look, you need to
be responsive to us. You need to listen to
our concerns and recognize that everything
you put together is not working."
"It was a reality check for the Washing
ton bureaucrats. Wake up — this is the new
generation and we need to be attentive to
them... I think it's a veiy different reality

than what they're used to."
"Diversity takes time," said Ricks, who
pointed out that spending time in the di
verse community was a learning process in
itself, training the participants for the di
verse communities in which they would be
spending their summers.
Chi agreed that the week was incredibly
positive in spite, and even because of the
problems. "People learned how to interact
with respect and saw the pain when there is
no respect," said Chi.

Service over money

With the results from Treasure Island
in, questions remain. Can these students
really have any impact? Are they participat
ing for the money or for the opportunity at
public service?
While the first question should be par
tially answered by the end of the summer,
the second is already being answered by the
students themselves.
"This is not just to gain money for col
lege, but to begin caring for my world," said
Christopher Sorhaindo from Montclair,
New Jersey, during a service project held
one day of the training week.
Motioning to an East Palo Alto youth
slowly but intently painting part of the
Ravenswood Elementary School, Sorhain
do added, "I remember being in their place,
and you really need someone to guide you."
"The money and the service complement
one another," said Maisie Chin, a 1993
graduate of UCLA and a member of a Los
Angeles Summer of Service program.
"Many view going to college as a way to give
back to their community."
Chin prodded at a weed with her hoe for
a moment and added, "I had my doubts
[about the sincerity of the participants), but
the more I talk to them, the more I realize
that they want to get at it and do it well. Peo
ple on my team have gotten out of neighbor
hoods, and now they want to give back."
"The main purpose is to instill an ethic of
service," said Milton. "Often this is not pos
sible for someone from middle- or low-in
come background without some kind of
stipend or income."
Gray pointed out that the money that the
students earn over the summer is much less
than many could have earned in other jobs,
adding that the $1,000 bonus is nice but
"not the engine that drives the program."
According to Chi, the money that is
earned is simply a way to attach value to
public service. "It's hard to find jobs where
you feel like you're giving back to the com
munity," she said. "This is a perfect way to
invest in our community."
From this summer's pilot program,
Clinton plans to learn of relative strengths
and weaknesses to help rebuild future
Summers of Service. Next year, a proposed
$400 million is to be used to place 25,000
young adults in public service. By 1997, an
estimated 150,000 youths will be involved.
Clinton's program has the stated goal of
both centralizing aid for college students
and getting people involved in public ser
vice. "Public service means educational op
portunity" reads one of Clinton's slogans.
Hut congressional approval and other
roadblocks may confront Clinton in the fu
ture. Questions of applicant criteria have
also come into play, with some claiming
that those in greater financial need should
be given preference for the program. But
Clinton claims that a successful smaller
scale pilot summer will be able to dissuade
the nay-sayers.
With the future of Clinton's programs
securely fastened to their backs, the week
ended with 1,475 students going back to
their individual communities to begin their
projects. Whether they feed the hungry, im
munize the sick, clean up dirty shorelines
or tutor the disadvantaged, all will discover
that they have the ability to make a differ
ence, according to Chin.
"It's a very empowering program," said
Chin, still picking at the weed in East Palo
Alto. "It taps into the power of young peo
ple. And it's not just about public service.
It's about understanding your place in the
community. It's about seeing that you can
do something."
