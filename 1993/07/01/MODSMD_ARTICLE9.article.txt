## Virginia official Printup named new registrar 
### 
Roger Printup, registrar at the Universi
ty of Virginia for 12 years, has been named
Stanford's new registrar, following a six
month, nationwide search.
Printup, who takes over Aug. 2, inherits
the position from Jack Farrell, who has been
acting registrar since Sally Mahoney left the
position in 1990. Farrell, who has worked in
the Registrar's Office since 1986, also ap
plied for the permanent position.
According to Vice Provost for Student Re
sources Mary Edmonds, who made the final
decision, Printup, who beat out 31 other ap
plicants for the job, was an attractive candi
date because of his substantial experience
building and maintaining information sys
tems at another top university and because
"his grasp on academic issues impressed the
faculty very much."
As registrar, Printup will play a key role
in the development and implementation of
Stanford's academic policy. As the officer
charged with enforcement of these policies,
he will also oversee an office with a staff of
more than 30 full-time employees who mon
itor students' academic progress, schedule
classes, disseminate information through
the Time Schedule and Courses and De
grees, and coordinate the Axess system
through which students file study lists and
view grades.
In a telephone interview earlier this week,
Printup joked that he can't wait to leave Vir
ginia's heat and humidity behind, but added
that, "There were very few universities I
would have left Virginia for. It was a tough
choice."
Aside from the weather, Printup said the

direct involvement of Stanford's registrar in
academic issues was a determining factor in
his decision to make the move.
Printup, who also taught classes on gov
ernment and Indian politics at Virginia, said
he was "tangentially" involved with academ
ic issues such as undergraduate degree re
quirements as registrar.
But at Stanford, the registrar has

"greater involvement with
the undergraduate degree
certification process and a
close working relationship
with the faculty commit
tee on students ... areas
which are of great interest
to me," he said.
When asked what aspects
of Stanford's system he
plans to review and possi-

bly modify, Printup replied, "I don't think
there's anything in the Registrar's Office I
don't intend to look at. Whether I change it
or not depends on what I find."
Edmonds echoed this outlook, saying
Printup will be expected to "assess every
thing ... the way any newcomer would,"
looking at the "total organization of the of
fice and the way it interacts with other of
fices." But she added that he wasn't charged
with repairing any specific problems and, "If
it ain't broke, we won't fix it."
At Stanford, Printup expects his greatest
challenge will come in the financial arena,
because as registrar he will be "working in an
environment of reduced resources at the
same time that students and faculty are ex
pecting the office to do more and more."

"Especially as students become more
adept at using computers, they expect to be
able to access a lot more information and get
it much more quickly than they did in the
past," he explained. "But technology is not
cheap. The challenge is in working on those
items that provide the most benefit for the
most people possible."
So far, Printup said, the existing Axess
system seems fairly solid, and he doesn't
foresee any kind of overhaul; however, some
factors, such as the system's accommoda
tion of study list changes several weeks into
the quarter — which leads to the sometimes
problematic "course-shopping" period —
will come under scrutiny.
Course registration presents "multi

faceted problems, and you never totally solve
all those problems," Printup said. "There
will always be more students wanting to take
classes than there are spaces available, and
there will always be classes that are too big
for their rooms or rooms that are too big for
their classes."
However, the goal of his office will be to
"minimize the disruption, so both the stu
dents and faculty have an easy transition
at the beginning of the quarter — I have
to remember to say quarter now, and not
semester."
"The registration system should be as un
obtrusive as possible," he continued. "Some
work better than others; some are disasters.
However, I don't get the sense that you're
anywhere near the disaster end of the spec
trum," hejoked.
Virginia is currently in the process of al
lowing students direct access to their
records — the way Stanford's Axess sys
tem does. However, Virginia is using
phones to call in their class registration,
Printup said.
The particular medium, though, is incon
sequential, Printup said. The main issue is
that students have direct access to their files.
"What's happening now, generally and
nationally, is that universities are providing
mechanisms that allow students direct ac
cess to and control over their records," said
Printup, who enthusiastically endorses thus
move. "This doesn't mean they can change
their grades, but it does mean they can see
their grades whenever they want to and reg
ister themselves."

itor students' academic progress, schedule
classes, disseminate information through
the Time Schedule and Courses and De
grees, and coordinate the Axess system
through which students file study lists and
view grades.
In a telephone interview earlier this week,
Printup joked that he can't wait to leave Vir
ginia's heat and humidity behind, but added
that, "There were very few universities I
would have left Virginia for. It was a tough
choice."
Aside from the weather, Printup said the

direct involvement of Stanford's registrar in
academic issues was a determining factor in
his decision to make the move.
Printup, who also taught classes on gov
ernment and Indian politics at Virginia, said
he was "tangentially" involved with academ
ic issues such as undergraduate degree re
quirements as registrar.
But at Stanford, the registrar has

"greater involvement with
the undergraduate degree
certification process and a
close working relationship
with the faculty commit
tee on students ... areas
which are of great interest
to me," he said.
When asked what aspects
of Stanford's system he
plans to review and possi-

bly modify, Printup replied, "I don't think
there's anything in the Registrar's Office I
don't intend to look at. Whether I change it
or not depends on what I find."
Edmonds echoed this outlook, saying
Printup will be expected to "assess every
thing ... the way any newcomer would,"
looking at the "total organization of the of
fice and the way it interacts with other of
fices." But she added that he wasn't charged
with repairing any specific problems and, "If
it ain't broke, we won't fix it."
At Stanford, Printup expects his greatest
challenge will come in the financial arena,
because as registrar he will be "working in an
environment of reduced resources at the
same time that students and faculty are ex
pecting the office to do more and more."

"Especially as students become more
adept at using computers, they expect to be
able to access a lot more information and get
it much more quickly than they did in the
past," he explained. "But technology is not
cheap. The challenge is in working on those
items that provide the most benefit for the
most people possible."
So far, Printup said, the existing Axess
system seems fairly solid, and he doesn't
foresee any kind of overhaul; however, some
factors, such as the system's accommoda
tion of study list changes several weeks into
the quarter — which leads to the sometimes
problematic "course-shopping" period —
will come under scrutiny.
Course registration presents "multi

faceted problems, and you never totally solve
all those problems," Printup said. "There
will always be more students wanting to take
classes than there are spaces available, and
there will always be classes that are too big
for their rooms or rooms that are too big for
their classes."
However, the goal of his office will be to
"minimize the disruption, so both the stu
dents and faculty have an easy transition
at the beginning of the quarter — I have
to remember to say quarter now, and not
semester."
"The registration system should be as un
obtrusive as possible," he continued. "Some
work better than others; some are disasters.
However, I don't get the sense that you're
anywhere near the disaster end of the spec
trum," hejoked.
Virginia is currently in the process of al
lowing students direct access to their
records — the way Stanford's Axess sys
tem does. However, Virginia is using
phones to call in their class registration,
Printup said.
The particular medium, though, is incon
sequential, Printup said. The main issue is
that students have direct access to their files.
"What's happening now, generally and
nationally, is that universities are providing
mechanisms that allow students direct ac
cess to and control over their records," said
Printup, who enthusiastically endorses thus
move. "This doesn't mean they can change
their grades, but it does mean they can see
their grades whenever they want to and reg
ister themselves."
