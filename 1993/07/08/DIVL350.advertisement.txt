• TIRED OF LOOKING AT GRAPEFRUIT BREASTS?
We all know that the majority of women in magazines do not
have the normal or even the 'ideal' breast shape as interpreted by other
women. Nevertheless the media and implant manufacturers have
continued to produce images of round breasts as the 'ideal shape.' We
are looking for women of all shapes and sizes who have not had surgery
on their breasts to participate in a study to define the shape of "real"
breasts for implant manufacturers, surgeons and bra manufacturers. It
requires ten minutes of your time is not painful or embarrassing and is
supervised by a female physician. Anonymity is guaranteed.
