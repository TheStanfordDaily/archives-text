CTJie Center for Teaching and Learning
announces that Summer quarter it is
offering its popular course
V J
CTLIB2, LEARNING AND ACTION:
ACHIEVING RESULTS THROUGH CREATING
A LEARNING ORGANIZATION
TAUGHT BY JAMES D. MILOJKOVIC, Ph.D
Vice President, Creative Directions, Inc.
This course is designed to help managers, would-be managers, and their
organizations construct new and more powerful business practices through
becoming more aware of their own learning processes. By challenging habits
and personal and organizational myths that disable learning, the capacity to
learn can be enhanced radically. In turn, the nature of organizational learning
and action can be transformed for reactive to proactive to high performance.
Topics include: language, structure, and change; learning styles and the
intelligence trap; paradox, institution, and breakthrough; leverage of systems;
emotion, attachment and successful failure; shared vision and strategic intent;
team and organizational learning.
