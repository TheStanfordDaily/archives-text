## Low number of alumni givers forces new fund-raising plan 
### 
Faced with an unusually low percent
ageof alumni who are annual donors, the
Office of Development plans to signifi
cantly change its fund-raising approach
es over the next year.
According to John Ford, vice presi
dent for development, new programs fo
cusing on market research as well as the
"segmentation" of direct mail programs
will attempt to broaden the support base
among alumni.
"One of our goals coming out of the
Centennial Celebration was to increase
participation among alumni, especially
undergraduates," he said.
Currently, 23 percent of all Stanford
graduates donate annually, one of the
lowest rates among leading research in
stitutions. Some Ivy League schools have
alumni participation rates as high as 40
or 50 percent.
Ford attributed the discrepancy to a
"more diffuse" undergraduate experi
ence at Stanford and a lack of class iden

tity, two things the new programs will
work to unify and strengthen.
Ford explained that new marketing
programs will target "lapsed donors" and
will educate current undergraduates
about the importance of development.
Lapsed donors, according to Ford, are
those who have stopped giving and are
now targeted as donors.
"Frankly, we want to come up with a
simple, repeatable message that stresses
the importance of philanthropy and gifts
of all sizes that will be needed to fund a
Stanford education for the current gen
eration," Ford said.
Ann Trela, director of marketing for
the annual fund, said mailings will give
different messages with a consistent
theme designed specifically for regular
donors, lapsed donors and those who
have never donated before.
According to Trela, heightened mar
ket research in the next few years will
point to possible segmentation by gender

or minority status. This type of catego
rization was not heavily emphasized in
the past, she said.

Raising aware
ness of the annual fund
and development after
graduation is an im
mense job which will re
quire quite a bit of reor
ganization within the
department, she said.
In May a num
ber of layoffs and bud
get-streamlining initia-

tives were implemented to "free up
money to make the investments neces
sary for this program." Included in these
investments will be a new position for
someone who will work directly with
Ford to do intense market research on
the alumni base.
One way of augmenting annual dona
tions will be coordinating fund-raising
and reunion activities. Undergraduate

reunions at Stanford have been tradi
tionally weak compared with those of
other major universities and even Stan
ford's professional schools.
Dan Estabrook, acting director of per
sonal solicitation and reunion funding,
predicted a number of sweeping changes
over the next year. New direct mailings,
he said, will be coordinated with follow-up
phone calls tailored to different groups of
graduates based on age, regional location
and affiliation with the university. The
new mailings will take at least a year to
develop since they will have to wait for re
sults from the market research.
According to Estabrook, there might be
fund-raising efforts in the future aimed at
members of minority groups, which are no
ticeably underrepresented in the ranks of
development volunteers.
"The different types of people who at
tend this university aren't reflected in
our volunteer base."
