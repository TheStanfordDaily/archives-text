# Permanent Haas director named
## 
### 
Last week, Timothy Stanton dropped
the "acting" from his title after being
named the permanent director of the
Haas Public Service Center for Public
Service by Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds.
Stanton, 45, succeeds Haas' Founding
Director Catherine Milton, who now
heads the Commission of National and
Community Service in Washington. He
has served as acting director since 1991.
Graduating from Stanford with a bach
elor's degree in English in 1969, Stanton
received a teaching credential from St.
Mary's College in 1974 and earned a mas
ter's degree in Education and Human Re
lations from San Francisco State Univer
sity in 1976. From 1983 to the present, he
has done work in human and organiza
tion development at the Fielding Insti
tute in Santa Barbara.
After leaving Stanford, Stanton served
as the founding director of The Switching
Yard, a nationally recognized student
community service center in Marin Coun
ty that works to provide area high school
students with service opportunities in
over 200 organizations.
From 1977 to 1985, he served as direc
tor and lecturer in Cornell University's
Human Ecology Field Study Office, an in
terdisciplinary social science program.
Stanton returned to Stanford as asso
ciate director of Haas in 1985, and has
since played a key role in developing "ser
vice-learning," an attempt to make com
munity service a part of academic course
work. He has also authored numerous ar
ticles on the subject.
According to Edmonds, the University
promoted Stanton to the position of per
manent director without an outside
search.
"As there are very few community ser
vice centers like the Haas Center in the
nation," Edmonds said, "a national
search would probably not have yielded
very much. So instead we talked to the
National Advisory Board and the Faculty
Steering Committee and decided to un
dertake an evaluation of him, an exhaus
tive internal paper search rather than an
outside search."
The evaluation of Stanton concluded
that he was well-qualified for the job.
Edmonds said, "I was very impressed
with the breadth of his information on
community service. . . . Another thing
that impressed me was the faith and con
fidence that his staff and others in the
University have in him, as well as the in
roads that he has made into the wider
community."
Edmonds also said she was impressed
by Stanton's leadership both in the You
Can Make A Difference Conference and
during the opening of the public service
center's new building.
Betty Walker, Stanton's assistant at
Haas, said she does not expect significant

changes in Haas' operations, but said it
can set firm goals now that it has a per
manent director. She said service-learn
ing programs, which have existed for sev
eral years, will likely expand under Stan
ton's stewardship.
"Service-learning," she said, "is his
contribution, and he is probably going to
focus a lot of his attention on expanding
that part of the program, even though it is
presently growing with very little effort
on our part."
The added space that the newly-con
structed public service center provides
has increased Haas' public service activi
ty as well, she said.
"We have more service projects going
on now, because we can house more stu
dent groups now," Walker said. "We have
new projects and more diversity, which is
something we wanted to achieve."
Stanton, on vacation until July 16, was
unavailable for comment.
