# Stanford athletes make NCAA grade
## 
### 
Stanford's graduation rates for student
athletes rank far above the national aver
age, according to statistics released last
week by the NCAA.
Well, duh.
With a 92 percent graduation rate for
all students over the last three years,
Stanford student-athletes averaged a
three-year graduation rate of 84 percent,
33 points higher than the national aver
age for Division I schools, 32 points high
er than all Division I-A schools and 13
points higher than all large private
schools.
In refined average, attained by taking
into account athletes who transferred in or
out with good academic standing, Stanford
has a 95 percent average over the past three
years. However, the average cannot be
compared to the normal graduation rate as
there is no tabulation for the refined aver
age of non-athletes.
Stanford rated ahead of every other Pa
cific 10 Conference school in both raw and
refined averages. The score closest to Stan
ford's came from UC-Berkeley, which had a
raw average of 67 percent and a refined av
erage of 76 percent. The only other Division
1-A schools in the nation that rated compa
rably to Stanford were Notre Dame and
Duke.
The NCAA averages rated the entering
freshman classes from 1983-1986, with
members from each class given six years to
complete their undergraduate degree. The
'85-'B6 entering class was therefore rated
for this year, the last year for athletes to be
considered graduates under the rating sys
tem.
The '85-'B6 entering class at Stanford
had an 89 percent graduation rate, which
was far above the national average of 52
percent for all Division I-A schools.
