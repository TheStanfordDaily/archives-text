# Study reveals truth about cholesterol

### 
A new discovery by Stanford researchers
and their colleagues brings both good and
bad news about how people can think about
their cholesterol.
The good news is that Richard Lawn,
professor of cardiovascular surgery at the
School of Medicine, along with David
Grainger from the University of Cam
bridge, now has a better understanding of
how a substance called lipoprotein(a), more
commonly known as "bad cholesterol," can
increase the risk of heart disease.
The bad news is that lipoprotein(a) is a
genetically determined substance. That
means its negative effects are hereditary
and incurable by available procedures.
So how can someone with high choles
terol fight the deleterious effects of lipopro-
Lawn told the Medical Center News
Bureau, "All of the risk factors add up.
Until an effective method for interfering
with Lp(a) activity is discovered, the best
advice is to treat what's treatable. Ifyou are
concerned about elevated Lp(a), you should
give up smoking, lower your fat intake and
talk to your doctor about reducing other
risk factors."
Even though lipoprotein(a) cannot be di
rectly controlled, doctors ask patients with
high levels of the substance to stop eating
red meat, cheese, milk with any fat, eggs
and other sources of animal fat — all which
contain the "bad cholesterol."
In comparison, fat from an avocado
would have high levels of cholesterol, but
since its source is a vegetable, this choles
terol is not the harmful kind.
Previous knowledge of how cholesterol
increases the risk for heart disease points to
a build-up of "bad cholesterol" on the blood
vessel walls of the heart's arteries.
Soon after, the restricted blood flow
would induce a type of heart disease. How
ever, Lawn and his colleagues have devel
oped a new model of this process: the blood
flow is still restricted but in a different way.
Instead of excess lipoprotein(a) building
up on the surface of the walls of the blood
vessels, it actually stimulates smooth mus
cle cell growth which builds up the blood
vessel wall itself.
The enlarged wall creates a vessel with a
smaller diameter which then constricts the
volume of blood to the heart — much like an
inflamed sinus would constrict airflow to
the lungs.
This happens because lipoprotein(a) in
hibits the body's natural function of re
straining growth. With the growth-re
straining system out of commission, the cell
growth that causes blood vessel wall en
largement can occur.
The finding was quite unexpected, Lawn
told the Medical Center News Bureau.
The research is a follow-up to a finding
Lawn made in 1987 at Genentech when he
was cloning a component gene of lipopro
