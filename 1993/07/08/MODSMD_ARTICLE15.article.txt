# Law Prof. named to U.S. welfare post
## 
### 
Stanford Law School Prof. Michael Wald
will begin work Monday as deputy general
counsel of the Department of Health and
Human Services. The appointment is offi
cial, pending an FBI check.
Wald's position will deal with legal issues
concerning welfare reform, including foster
care and other child welfare care programs.
Wald will also be examining how states deal
with neglected and abused children and de
veloping regulation around the Head Start
program. Eventually, he says, he will also
work on the forthcoming health care sys
tem.
Wald is anxious to be a part of Clinton's
planned reforms of the welfare system.
"I think the basis of aiding people to find
work is the proper direction," Wald said.
"And the philosophy of the direction — that
aid has to be provided — is the right way of
proceeding."
Wald added that, at this stage, forming
all the necessary programs will be the
biggest challenge. Many people in the gov
ernment are already spending most of their
time creating programs to do such things as

find jobs for those who are on welfare for ex
tended periods of time.

"Most people
shouldn't remain on wel
fare," Wald said. "The
long-term recipients need
help providing for them
selves and their children
by getting work."
Wald began
teaching at the Law
School in 1967; his courses

focused on child and fami

ly policy. He has also taught several under
graduate courses and received an appoint
ment in the School of Education. He said he
has mixed emotions about leaving Stanford.
"I am excited about going to Washington
to work on ... issues that I've written about
and studied for a long time," said Wald. "But
I'm sad to leave Stanford." Wald added that
he will officially only be "on leave" and that
he is not leaving permanently. He hopes to
return to teaching at the graduate and un
dergraduate level following his work in
Washington.
Wald also said he expects to work with
Stanford's Washington campus, through
which he hopes to "have ongoing contact
with students in internship programs."
