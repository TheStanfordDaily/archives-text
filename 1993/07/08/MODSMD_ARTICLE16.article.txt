# Undergrad study behind schedule
## 
### 
The much-touted Commission on Un
dergraduate Education is already running
months behind schedule in selecting its
members, administration officials said.
The delay in forming the commission,
which has been given the charge of con
ducting a comprehensive, year-long exami
nation of undergraduate education at Stan
ford, probably jeopardizes University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper's hopes to have a
final report ready by July 1994.
"We're getting some of the preparation
work done, but we won't start cooking until
Oct. 1," said Geoff Cox, special assistant to
the president.
In his April State of the University ad
dress, Casper targeted July 1 as a deadline
for naming the commission members. He
also said he expected the commission to
meet over the summer.
But last week Casper admitted he had
"abandoned hope of convening in the
course of the summer."
He did, however, expect that faculty and

alumni committee members would "be in
place in a couple of weeks," yet that aspira
tion seems to have faded as well.
Cox said that the commission is "work
ing on a list" of possible faculty members,
but said "no public announcements will be
made for some time."

The commis
sion's progress has been
held up, in part, by the
absence of its chair, His
tory Prof. James Shee
han, who is researching
in Germany until next
month. In addition, po
tential student members
of the panel, to be nomi
nated by the ASSU's

Nominations Committee, were not yet ap
pointed when spring quarter had ended.
They have since become "too dispersed,"
Casper said, to select this summer.
"For both of these reasons," Cox said,
"the commission will not really get in busi
ness until the fall."
Lowell Price, senior associate provost
and one of the officials coordinating the
commission, said he expects the group to
consist of "19 or 20" members, drawn from
faculty, staff, alumni, and students.
