## Team USA beats Brazil, grabs gold in Sao Paulo 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Tar a VanDerveer can breathe a
sigh of relief.
After joking that she would dis
appear down the Amazon River if
the USA women's basketball team
did not qualify for next year's
World Championships, the head
coach of Team USA watched the
Americans wrap up the Tourna
ment of the Americas in Sao
Paulo, Brazil with a 5-1 record,
the gold medal and an automatic
berth in the World Champi
onships.
After Canada served the U.S.
team a close wake-up call in the
first round, the Americans
cruised past Mexico and Chile to
reach the medal round, where
they played two more challenging
teams.
The Cubans were one of the
two squads, along with Brazil,
that coach VanDerveer was
wary of heading into the tourna
ment.
The gritty Cuban team proved
tough as it pushed the Ameri
cans nearly point for point in the
second half. However, the
Cubans could not overcome a 10-
point halftime deficit and fell,
89-78.
Lisa Leslie, Ruthie Bolton
and former Cardinal Jennifer
Azzi led the offensive charge.
Leslie sank all five of her free
throws while shooting 8-of-15
from the floor for 21 points.
Bolton drilled three treys en
route to 13 points, but Azzi was
again the starring outside sharp
shooter as she nailed 4-of-5
three-pointers to lead the squad

from long range.
Team USA dominated the
boards, grabbing 43 boards, 20
more than the Cubans.
The U.S. then faced its early
round nemesis, Team Canada. As
was the case in the first game,
Team USA got off to a slow start,
trailing the Canadians 38-33 at
halftime.
However, Team Canada's cold
outside shooting, 0-of-7 from
three-point land, aided the Amer
ican resurgence. Former Cardi
nal Katy Steding pumped in five
treys on seven attempts and led
the squad in scoring with 17
points.
The offensive troika from the
previous evening cooled off con
siderably as Leslie, Bolton and
Azzi combined for 6-of-19 shoot
ing and 18 points.
Friday's game was a showdown
between the undefeated 5-0
Americans and the equally un
touched Brazilians.
The inconsistency of *the
Americans during the tourna
ment boded ill as Team USA stut
tered to a 99-92 loss against the
physical Brazil squad, who held
an overwhelming home-court ad
vantage.
But the Americans avenged
their lone defeat by beating the
Brazilians in the gold medal game,
106-92.
Canada upset the Cubans in a
defensive battle to take home the
bronze, 61-54.
By reaching the semifinals, the
U.S., Brazil, Cuba and Canada all
automatically qualified for the
World Championships to be held
in Melbourne, Australia, July 1-
12,1994.
