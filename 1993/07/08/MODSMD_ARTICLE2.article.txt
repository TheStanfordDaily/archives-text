## Editorial This is no molehill Unfinished art is expensive eyesore for Rains residents 
### 
Nothing ruins a
place quite like a
$140,000 sculpture.
The half-completed sculp
ture, which makes its home
in a courtyard in the Rains
graduate housing complex,
is, at best, an oddity. At worst,
it's an eyesore and a waste of
a fine picnic area.
Although the concept of
adding art to the slightly-too-
Melrose-Place-ish apart
ment complex is a good one,
it's a failure in practice.
As it stands, Rains is quite
nice: plush green grass, spa
cious Spanish-style apart
ments, sand volleyball courts
and comfy common rooms
with big, big televisions. But
all this ambiance is tempered
by an intrusive slab of unfin
ished art.
The University must have
pulled out all the stops on
this one. Most modern sculp
ture just looks like it's half
finished. This piece of art ac
tually is â€” and has been for
some time.
A bare foundation of con
crete with metal rods stick
ing straight up out of it, sided
by a generous stack of ply
wood, the sculpture has
graced the Rains courtyard
for nearly two months now.
During most of that time,
nothing has been done to it.
The sculpture, designed
by artist John Roloff, is sup
posed to resemble a cross sec
tion of a hill. It is intended to
look as if "someone has cut
through the earth, with fab
ricated stone that will look
wet," according to Hilarie
Faberman, curator of the

Stanford Museum of Art.
The sculpture comes re
plete with a tiny irrigation
system that, once it's finally
installed, will allow plants to
grow atop it. Inventive, but
not exactly the way most peo
ple would spend $140,000.
Given a choice, many in
Rains would likely opt to use
that money more pragmati
cally. In addition to being im
practical, the sculpture
threatens to detract from,
rather than improve, the pre
cious recreation space re
maining to Rains residents.
The sculpture is a clear
case of the University appor
tioning money too narrowly,
then getting caught trying to
spend that money any way it
can. While other graduate
needs go unfunded, the Uni
versity finds itself with
$140,000 earmarked for
Rains art.
The money comes directly
from the General Plant Im
provement Fund, which is used
for above-ground artwork,
street lights and benches.
If the University really need
ed to spend that money, it
should have bent the rules and
called a swimming pool or a
basketball court "art." It would
have made a bunch of graduate
students much happier.
And if the University
didn't like that idea, it should
have saved that money until a
worthier project came along.
Or it should have bought a
whole lot of benches.
In the future the Universi
ty would do well to consult
with graduate students be
fore making decisions that
affect their lives. And it
would also do well to refrain
from spending money unnec
essarily just becasue it is
available for specific use.
In the meantime, the Uni
versity should just finish the
sculpture.
