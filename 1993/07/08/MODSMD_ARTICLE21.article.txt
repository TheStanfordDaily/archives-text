# Firebirds fuel growth of soccer

### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford has given the athletic world
phenoms from John McEnroe and John
Elway to Summer Sanders and Scott For
tune. Thanks in part to such Cardinal tal
ents, tennis, football, swimming and volley
ball now command international attention.
And with the recent emergence of the
Palo Alto Firebirds in the world of soccer,
perhaps Stanford athletes will help foster
greater local appreciation for a sport hailed
as the most popular on earth.
The Firebirds, who play at Stanford's
Maloney Field, burst upon the United
States Interregional Soccer League
(USISL) just one year ago. That one sea
son, however, was all thdt the Firebirds
needed to secure a national championship.
This year's squad looks just as tough as it
combines Santa Clara University players
with recent Cardinal standouts Randy
Mann, Jason Vanacour, Robert Brophy,
Jason Keyes and Niels Bruckner
Palo Alto, as well as 42 other teams in
the USISL, hope not only to launch the ca
reers of American soccer players, but also
to urge the formation of other regional
clubs. As Firebird community affairs direc
tor Stuart Holloway said, "The League is
for professional development, and it is also
a grass-roots organization to bring atten
tion to soccer."
In regards to the former goal, not only
does the USISL maintain collegiate players'
involvement in soccer, but also introduces
them to competition from professionals.
Within Palo AJto's Pacific Division of eight
teams alone, the Firebirds encounter the
San Jose Hawks, who indulge in the services
of 12 players from their 1991 American Pro
fessional Soccer championship squad.
"There aren't very many opportunities
in America to play soccer outside of col
lege," said Firebird coach Joe Silveira, a
former standout at San Jose State. "The
League offers a chance for players to play
outside of or after college, and at a higher

level. During college, Stanford players like
Brophy, Keyes and Mann play against
other players who, like themselves, study
during school and work at jobs in the sum
mer. But in (the USISL], they play against
guys who are paid to be at practice for
hours every day."
Such quality of competition has aided the
USISL with one of its major goals â€” the
popularization of soccer domestically. While
the increasing hype over the upcoming 1994
World Cup, which will be held in the U.S.,
may or may not have had an impact on the
growth of soccer leagues, the USISL has
doubled in size for the 1993 season, adding
22 new squads from across the country to its
21 clubs from last year. Five teams began
the league's inaugural season in 1986.
"The League fills a Isoccerl void in the
community," Silveira said.
Six divisions of four to nine teams
stretching from Orlando and Baltimore to
Dallas and Los Angeles comprise the
USISL. Each club plays a 16-game regular
season within its respective division. The
top four finishers in each division then
complete in a divisional championship tour
nament, with the winner advancing to the
national "Sizzling Six."
Palo Alto was favored to repeat as
USISL champions in the pre-season. How
ever, the Firebirds presently find them
selves with a 5-4 record.
"(Our record) just goes to show that the
League has grown," said Silveira, "in size
and in quality of competition."
