## Equus Who's gonna ride your wild horses? stanford drama insiders add the outdoors to their aesthetic 
### Ted Quinn Staff writer 
In Stanford's artistic environment, where
expression often takes second place to the
more scholarly activities of discussion,
contemplation and deconstruction, it's a
rare treat to find people who are passionate
ly creating art instead of talking about it.
This revelation is offered by Stanford's
newest theater group, Inside Out Theater,
which opens its summer season tonight with
Peter Shaffer's "Equus" and continues with

"Approaching Zanz
ibar" and "A Mid
summer Night's
Dream" later in the
summer.
The group is the
brainchild of recent
Stanford graduates
Alexandra d'Arbeloff
and Krista Hoeppner,
who were frustrated
by the tremendous
amount of Stanford
acting talent that gets
wasted each year. To
them, exciting acting
opportunities — par
ticularly for women
— were disappoint
ingly scarce. Accord
ingly, they chose texts
which reflect the ex
isting Stanford pool
of talent and then set
out to create a bal
anced repertory en
semble — five men
and five women — in
which every member
has at least one sub
stantial and interest
ing role in the course
of the summer.
To keep the focus
on the acting and to
take advantage of the

beautiful spaces the Stanford campus offers,
they decided to hold all of the shows outdoors
and free of charge. Visiting instructor Winter
Mead, who is directing "Equus" and "A Mid
summer Night's Dream," emphasizes this dis
tinction:
"The Drama Department generally has a
huge amount of technical effects because their
graduate programs are about design and di
recting We're pretty much throwing tech
nical stuff to the winds. God's responsible for
lighting and sound."
Finally, since they were trying to form a
group which represented the best Stanford has
to offer in terms of dramatic talent, they strove to
create a highly motivated, professional atmos
phere in which serious actors could devote their
attention to the work full time. By soliciting pri
vate donations, d'Arbeloff and Hoeppner were
able to raise enough money to provide a living
space and a modest paycheck for the actors.

With the help of two faculty advisors, Patri
cia Ryan and Mead, they held auditions in the
spring and came up with an ensemble consist
ing of people who, for the most part, had acted
together in the Drama Department's Ad
vanced Performance Workshop and in a stu
dent company which grew out of that class,
The Red Hoop Players. The latter group, who
also put on outdoor plays free of charge, per
formed two Caryl Churchill plays under
Mead's direction, "Cloud Nine" and "Serious
Money." Mead was asked to direct "Equus"
and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" while

d'Arbcloff assumed the role of director for
"Approaching Zanzibar."
The results are impressive. Even in the
sweaty midst of their rehearsal process, the
group's intensity is evident, and their perfor
mances already exhibit a subtle complexity
which spoke of the long hours they've dedicat
ed to the work. Hoeppner feels that the ensem
ble's camaraderie as well as the time they spend
living and working together lend the work a
certain degree of verisimilitude:
"We arc creating an incredible amount of
connections between all of us, and that reads
in the shows and makes them more believ
able."
The company's first play, "Equus,"
opens tonight at the Red Hoop, lo
cated just outside the main entrance
to Green Library. Written by Peter Shaffer,
author of "Amadeus," the Tony Award-win
ning play tells the story of Alan Strang, a dis

turbed 17-year-old British youth who sav
agely blinds 6 horses, and the psychiatrist
who sets out to cure him, Margaret Dysart.
In the course of the treatment, Dysart con
fronts the terrifying god that Alan has creat
ed for himself, as well as a few of his own
inner demons. Mead explains:
"It's a substitution story. Alan's need for
religion and love of religion becomes sort of
twisted until he creates a god out of horses
At the same time, Dysart's crisis is that
she continually sees herself curing these chil
dren and becomes increasingly convinced

that she cures them at the cost of emptying
them out and turning them into hollow men:
taking away their worship, taking away the
things that arc important to them and mak
ing them 'civilized' members of society."
The character of Pysart was written as a
male role, but Hocppncr and d'Arbeloff de
cided that they wanted to cast the role non
traditionally, changing the character to a
woman. Without subverting any of the play's
major thematic elements, the change echoes
through all of the power and gender dynam
ics of the play.
Other than the gender change, Mead di
rects the play more or less in the manner it
has been performed in the past, with the ad
dition of a Brechtian device in which the ac
tors sit just outside of the acting space facing
inward, forming a sort of inner audience for
the interaction between Alan and Dysart as
well as the tale which unfolds through Alan's

flashbacks.
Among this inner audience at all times are
the six horses who form Alan's pantheon, ac
tors with stern horsehead masks of steel,
dark leather and platform hooves. The ac
tors' faces can be seen clearly through the
masks, since no effort is made to disguise the
essential humanity of the horse-gods. In fact,
Mead feels that one of the reasons the film
version of "Equus" failed was that real hors
es were used instead of humans with masks:
"It's really about this god that is created
from horses, and so having actors play them

with masks points
to something
greater than just
horses. In the film
itself, they used real
horses and it some
how pulled back
and denied the
majesty and the real
godlike quality of
Equus."
On the other
hand, the actors
worked with Gwyn
Groden of the Stan
ford Equestrian
Team in order to
make their equine
movements and
sounds as realistic as
possible, so that
their performances
wouldn't sink into
caricature. Mead
cites the value of her
advice:
"[Groden] said
that one of the
problems with plays
and films is that,
whenever there's a
horse, they're al
ways prancing and
they're always whin
nying, which arc
two things that

horses really don't do very often."
This intense attention to detail is typical
of the groups work, and the results arc evi
dent in what they've accomplished. If Inside
Out theater can maintain this level of artistic
energy and conviction, audiences will be
hard-pressed to find a better place than Stan
ford campus for quality theater, even at twice
the price. ■

"Equus" will be performed at the Red Hoop,
just outside the main entrance to Green Li
brary, tonight through Sunday and next
Thursday through Saturday at 6 p.m., with
Saturday matinees on July 10 and 17at 2p.m.
"Approaching Zanzibar opens on July 22 at

ness side of the grassy oval. "A Midsummer
Night's Dream opens on August 4 at
Dohrmann Grove, on Serra Street next to the
Art Gallery. All performances are free, al
though donations are welcome. Audience
members should bring something to sit on.
