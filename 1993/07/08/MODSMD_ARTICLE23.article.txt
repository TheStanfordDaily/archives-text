## A 						real action hero In the Line Of Fire 
### 
Since the Memorial Day weekend, when
the summer movie season opened, Holly
wood hasn't released a single thoroughly en
joyable film. Not the terminally moronic
"Cliffhanger," not the humor-impaired
"Made in America,"and certainly not the
Spielberg-infected "Jurassic Park." It seemed
as if this summer was doomed to be a total
entertainment failure.
That's not gonna happen.
Three cheers and a well-deserved seven
dollars to Clint Eastwood, who follows up
his Oscar triumph "Unforgiven" with a
smart, exciting and engaging action-thriller,
"In The Line of Fire."

While it's still a mistake to
call what Eastwood does
acting, since every charac
ter he plays is a riff on his
patented tough-guy per
sona, he does show off a
gentler side. So even
though he's a loner, he
plays the piano, cracks
jokes and even smiles fair
ly often — he's Dirty Harry
on Prozac. __

Eastwood plays U.S. Secret Service agent
Frank Horrigan, a "borderline burnout with
questionable social skills," who failed to save
JFK in Dallas. Thirty years later, he's still on
the job, reduced to chasing counterfeiters.
But when Horrigan receives a series of phone
calls from a man who knows a great deal
about him — and who also plans to kill the
president — Horrigan gets reassigned to the
executive security team to prevent lightning
from striking twice.
While it's still a mistake to call what East
wood does acting, since every character he
plays is a riff on his "Dirty Harry" persona,
he does show off a gentler side that we
haven't seen recently. So even though he's a
loner, he plays the piano, cracks jokes and
even smiles fairly often — William Munny
on Prozac.
Eastwood even finds time for romance, as
Horrigan crustily and clumsily tries to woo
fellow agent Lily Raines (Rene Russo). An ar
gument could be made that the love interest
subplot is gratuitous, but Russo and East
wood spar so entertainingly that it would be
a shame to see any of their scenes cut out.
Still, the real standout is John Malkovich
as Mitch Leary, the ever-resourceful assassin.
Always one step ahead of the Secret Service,
he continues to torment Horrigan with soft
spoken reminders of JFK's assassination, his
subsequent alcoholism and his wife and
child walking out on him — all the while
planting doubt in Horrigan's mind that he
did his best that day in Dallas.
The role's a beaut, and Malkovich runs
with it all the way to a potential Oscar nomi
nation, playing down the psychosis and play
ing up Leary's unsettling single-mindedness.
He's Horrigan's ugly double — one protects,
the other kills — and both are willing to die
to get the job done. By making Leary recog
nizably human, Malkovich prevents the part
from degenerating into the manic rants of the
Scorpion in "Dirty Harry" — and entertains

us a whole lot more.
Wolfgang Petersen, who also directed
"Das Boot," expertly paces the two-hour
film, which starts out methodically as it in
troduces the various plot elements, but
picks up speed as it accelerates towards the
climax. The best sequence consists of Hor
rigan and his partner chasing Leary across
a crowded intersection, culminating in
Horrigan hanging from a rooftop, Leary
standing over him, and Horrigan's partner
pointing a gun at Leary from the adjacent
building.
I, for one, was very interested to see what
happened next.
Bottom line: Columbia Pictures should
breathe a little easier now that "In The Line
of Fire" is coming out. The real last action
hero, it seems, has finally hit the multiplex.
