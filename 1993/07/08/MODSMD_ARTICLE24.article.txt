# Absence of suspense
## The
						Firm 
### 
For the last two weeks, numerous television
commercials, billboards and print ads have all
borne the same tagline. "Power," they warn,
"can be murder to resist."
The same can't be said of a boring thriller,
which is precisely what Academy Award-win
ning director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa,"
"Absence of Malice") and superstar Tom
Cruise serve up in their adaptation of John Gr
isham's equally turgid bestseller, "The Firm."
Its premise is simple, even intriguing. Mitch
McDeere (Cruise), a hotshot Harvard Law
graduate, gets seduced away from Wall Street
by a Memphis law firm. They offer him a new
Mercedes, pay off his student loans and arrange
a low interest mortgage for his first home.
For the up-from-poverty Mitch, who wants
to give his upper-class wife Abby (Jeanne Trip

plehorn) all the luxuries she's been accustomed
to, this offer is much too good to pass up. But a
few dead lawyers and a visit from the friendly
neighborhood FBI convince Mitch to dig deep
er. By the time he finds out that the firm is a
front for the Chicago mob, he can't get out
without being killed, or even worse, disbarred.

Pollack doesn't seem to
have any idea how the
thriller genre works. He
rarely puts Mitch in physi
cal danger, and when he
does, the threat comes
from the positively jurassic
Wilford Brimley, of "Quaker
Oats" fame.

What's a plucky "Top Shyster" to do?
The answer isn't compelling enough to jus
tify even matinee prices, especially since Oliv
er Stone did a far superior job with a similar
premise in "Wall Street." Every ounce of flab in
Grisham's 500 page novel — mistakenly called
"lean and mean" by some reviewers — has
been captured in this excruciating two-and-a
half hour film.
Pollack doesn't seem to have any idea
how the thriller genre works. He rarely puts
Mitch in physical danger, and when he
does, the threat comes from the positively
jurassic Wilford Brimley, of "Quaker Oats"
fame. A fine actor, but hardly the terror-in
spiring sort.
This problem extends to the camerawork
and the score. Where Stone used a swirling,
handheld camera to juice up scenes of stock
transactions in "Wall Street," Pollack sticks to
stately, classical shots. And where Stone used a
pounding drum-based orchestral score, Pol
lack uses banal piano muzak. If there were ever

a movie to fall asleep to, this is it.
The biggest problem aside from the script is
the casting ofTom Cruise in the lead. While he
excels at playing eager upstarts, he can't handle
the guilt-wracked husband, under pressure
from the government, the firm and the wife he
cheated on while in the Cayman Islands — it's
miles outside his limited range. Jeanne Trip
plehorn's textbook histrionics as the wronged
wife with a bugged suburban house add little
depth to this paper thin relationship.
Only Gene Hackman, as the boozing, wom
anizing partner Avery Tolar, makes the film po
tentially bearable. His every attempt to get
Abby into bed is played with charm-coated
cynicism — there's far more sexual tension be
tween Tripplehorn and Hackman than be
tween her and Cruise. In a typically unshowy
performance, Hackman reminds us once again
why he's one of the best actors working today.
"The Firm" will likely become a hit, based
on the seven million copies of the book that
have been sold. Pity. A more apt tagline would
have been "Caveat Emptor." Unsuspecting
audiences would certainly appreciate the
warning.
