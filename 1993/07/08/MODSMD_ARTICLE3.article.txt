## The 						drive-in is dead 
### 
STOP WHINING. We all
know there's no dating at
Stanford. There's no dating
anywhere. This is college. There
are parties. There are bars. But
the whole malt-shop-and-drive
in-movie scene is dead, if ever it
existed in the first place.
Blame it on your parents. They
didn't just destroy the myth —
they created it. We've finally es
caped curfews, homework and
minimum wage only to find that
our inherited romantic ideal is as
outdated as "necking."
Dating — real dating — requires
planning, and contemporary soci
ety dictates that if it's not done on
the spur of the moment, it's not
worth doing. Carpe diem, baby.
Moreover, we're afraid to plan
ahead. We're afraid to look too
eager — i.e., desperate. Inviting
someone to a 7 o'clock movie at 6:45
may be easy on the ego, but it's not
dating — not even if you've spent
weeks rehearsing your approach.
Unfortunately, there's no such
thing as a spontaneous date. Dat
ing as we would have it involves
dinner reservations, new clothes,
a bathroom of one's own, several
pre-chosen "safe" topics of con
versation, a supply of condoms
and a trip to the ATM.
Even more threatening than
deciding where, when and how to

date is the question of which fork
to use once you get there. Forget
"consulting." According to a re
cent Newsweek article, the
fastest-growing American indus
try is etiquette seminars for col
lege students.
When our parents were in col
lege, etiquette was easy. The rule
was, what would the Kennedys do?
These days, emulating a Kennedy
practically guarantees social os
tracization, if not jail time.
Instead, etiquette has been re
duced to the most basic tenets of
common sense. Sushi should be
eaten in one bite, the person clos
est to the door should open it, the
most attractive caller should get
priority on call waiting. Survival
of the fittest, you know.
But it's become a faux pas to
date more than one person at a
time. Mom went out with a differ
ent guy every weekend, and nobody
ever called her a slut. They were all
too busy updating the phone num
bers in their little black books.
Call it AIDS, family values or
political correctness, but there's a
distinctly modern taboo against
simultaneous sweethearts. Be
sides, at this advanced stage of
life, most of us are looking for that
"special someone."
Back in high school, we'd date
anyone with the right car and the

right extracurricular resume.
Since then, our standards have
multiplied exponentially. We're
getting married. We're looking for
people to marry. We're attracted
to married people. Phrases like
"yearly income," "religious per
suasion" and "sexual compatibili
ty" have "co-captain" and
"stonewashed" in our collective
dating vocabulary.
Look around campus and you'll
see couples who have been (and
will be) together forever. They
skipped right over the dating part,
opting instead for the "domestic
partners" track. Meanwhile, the
rest of us congregate at Fresh
Choice and call it a social life.
Plato would be thrilled.
The problem is only compound
ed in the summer, when the cam
pus dating pool is drastically re
duced and, if you do manage to fmd
a date, chances are you'll never see
him/her again come September.
Not that this is necessarily a
bad thing. But we need to free our
selves from our pre-war myths
and expectations and pick up that
phone and start dialing. The sur
vival of the human race might just
depend on it.
