## 'I am innocent,' protests peeved parking victim 
### 
My name is Gene Meieran. I
work for Intel Corporation. I
have been responsible for provid
ing several tens of thousands of
dollars in scholarships to Stan
ford University students. I have
lectured (for free) dozens of times
at Stanford. I have had people
who work for me co-sponsor sev
eral graduate students. We
(Intel) have hired many Stanford
grads. I have taught a course in
X-ray diffraction at Stanford. I
have been a good patron of this
fine university.
I also parked somewhere on
the Stanford campus one fateful
August day, and got a parking
ticket, thus entering the Stan
ford equivalent of the "Twilight
Zone." It seems irrelevant that I

was (am) innocent; that I had a
legitimate parking permit is
sued by Stanford's Center for
Integrated Systems (where I
was giving a talk). I am branded
for life by the Stanford parking
system, and dare not show my
face there anymore.
I have amassed a series of let
ters that have been passed back
and forth between me and the
parking bureaucracy. Simply
stated, as a matter of principle, I
refuse to pay the parking fine.
On the other hand, Stanford,
who seems able to pay back the
U.S. government tens of mil
lions of dollars for polishing a
yacht, is unable to break this bu
reaucratic logjam.
Since I have no other recourse
for justice, I am sending these
letters to you, as an historical ac
count of my travails.
And, in order to fully prove
that this is NOT a matter of
money, I am sending you a
check for $38 (the amount of

the fine that would be imposed
if I were indeed guilty) for you
to apply to any scholarship
fund you choose. I suggest you
set up a (Gene Meieran) Park
ing Fine Scholarship, and, in
addition to anyone else's illegal
fines they might want to do
nate, you ask all Stanford stu
dents to donate $1 every year.
Thus, several thousands of dol
lars might go to better use in
helping needy students that
whatever the system does with
the parking fines!
And if you see someone skulk
ing around Stanford, hiding his
identity so he will not be picked
up by the Stanford Parking Po
lice, you might think of me. I just
hope the parking penalty does
not escalate as I continue to
protest my innocence.
You might also contact Profes
sor Krishna Saraswat of CIS; he
not only invited me to five of my
talks at Stanford, he fully corrob
orates my getting the valid park-

ing sticker.
I AM INNOCENT!
