# Branner Hall: More like a high school than ever
## 
### Story by John Mackenzie Photos by Nat Pearson 
For high school students, summer can mean any
number of things. Relaxation. Hanging out with
Brandon and Brenda at the Peach Pit. A summer
job. Taking college classes.
Taking college classes?
A select group of 144 students living in Branner Hall
this summer are doing just that.
To participate in Stanford Summer Session, appli
cants are drawn from all around the world. Most of the
students are 16 or 17-years old and will enter their se
nior year in high school this fall.
Hungry for the taste of college, the students immerse
themselves in the Stanford experience. They may enroll
in any of the 8-week classes available to undergraduates.
Many will apply to Stanford, hoping to become part of
the 1994 freshman class.
"I really like Stanford," said Amy Bromberg, a stu
dent at Andover originally from Southern California.
"The more time I spend on campus, the more I want to
go here."
A staff of seven resident assistants and Kassandra Vi
tacca, Branner's Resident Fellow and a Bay Area high
school teacher, help structure resident life.
"It's like freshman year magnified 10 times," said
worn-out looking Stanford senior Eric Bassman, RA.
"They want to do everything Stanford and the sur
rounding area has to offer. In the last two weeks we
went to the beach with Toyon and walked up to the Dish
to see the fireworks. The weekend before, we had a scav
enger hunt in the city and saw the Gay Pride Parade.
And when do they have time to study? I can't really tell
you."
"The Branner students are extremely ambitious —
top notch," according to Andrew Lisac, assistant dean of
the Summer Session. "The energy and excitement in
this group is incredible."
In many respects, they have the same freedoms and
responsibilities as undergraduates. "They treat us like
real college students," said Bromberg. "We can come
and go as we please, no curfew, no bed check. Branner is

nothing like boarding school and other summer pro
grams I looked into."
Budgeting their time is a new concept for some of the
students. "No one tells them to get up out of bed," said
Bassman. "Sometimes that's a problem, but they
learn."
Besides attending class and living in the dorm, they
share meals in Branner Dining Hall with the Toyon un
dergraduate residents.
According to Branner resident Matt Chen, "I've got
roommates I can live with, and I can stomach the dorm
food. Life is nice." Matt also plays Ultimate Frisbee with
a group of undergraduates on Thursdays.
Some people may question the generous amount of
freedom that the Summer Program places on the stu
dents.
But Vitacca said, "These kids want something. They
are serious about looking good and from a perspective
of a high school teacher, half the battle is won when the
students want to obtain something higher."
Vitacca cautioned that the students are not "super
responsible." "They are still 16- and 17-year-old kids
who want to fall in love — maybe not once, but four or
five times over the summer." Like most kids, she added,
"They are very image-conscious."
Responsibility is something the students learn very
quickly. According to RA David Sapoznikow, the num
ber of room keys students lose within the first week is
"amazing.... At first I just threw up my hands in dis
belief, but then I realized my friends did the same thing
freshman year. Of course, I never lost my key."
Their group profile is in some ways more diverse than
the Stanford undergraduate and graduate population.
"I believe this group is re-defining what it means to
be diverse," said John Pearson, director of the Bechtel
International Center. "These students are extremely
well-traveled."
For example, Anena-Lanyom Otii, already a jet-set
ter at 17, said, "Living in and traveling to different parts
of the world has taught me how important different peo

pie are for me, not only of different races but of different
shapes and sizes as well."
Otii, who now lives in Colorado, spent her primary
education in Tanzania and spread out her secondary ed
ucation in Kenya, Uganda and Colorado. She has also
traveled in Egypt, The Congo, Madagascar and Italy.
The diverse student body can be felt in almost every
aspect of Branner life.
Torrence, Calif., described her experiences. "I spoke
with the handful of German students in the program.
Even though they are from the same country, each has
different opinions regarding Hitler and the Holocaust."
However, the students' ambitions are not so diverse.
According to Lisac, 70 percent of the students are plan
ning on becoming doctors, lawyers or engineers.
"But I would be very surprised if these students have
the same career goals after the summer... . The Bran
ner program tries to expose the students to a broad
range of options that Stanford offers," he said, empha
sizing that the Summer Program offers an "invaluable
opportunity for a whole new perspective."
The students are challenged to ask questions about
themselves and their surroundings in their only re
quired course, Critical Thinking, taught through the
Center for Teaching and Learning.
Scott Allen, who teaches the section Critically Look
ing at College and the Process of (Jetting There said, "My
intention is for the course to instill a desire to learn and
ask questions that will lead them where they want to go,
instead of following the most traditional direction."
Although the Summer Session program is a chance
for some high school students to get a running start on
college, many take advantage of the opportunity to ex
plore new academic areas not offered in their high
schools.
"I jumped at the opportunity to take classes not of
fered back home," said Nat Peterson, from the Seattle
area. "This week in my class Magic, Witchcraft and Re
ligion I am learning about the dark side of the shaman.
It's completely new to me."

five times over the summer." Like most kids, she added,
"They are very image-conscious."
Responsibility is something the students learn very
quickly. According to RA David Sapoznikow, the num
ber of room keys students lose within the first week is
"amazing.... At first I just threw up my hands in dis
belief, but then I realized my friends did the same thing
freshman year. Of course, I never lost my key."
Their group profile is in some ways more diverse than
the Stanford undergraduate and graduate population.
"I believe this group is re-defining what it means to
be diverse," said John Pearson, director of the Bechtel
International Center. "These students are extremely
well-traveled."
For example, Anena-Lanyom Otii, already a jet-set
ter at 17, said, "Living in and traveling to different parts
of the world has taught me how important different peo

pie are for me, not only of different races but of different
shapes and sizes as well."
Otii, who now lives in Colorado, spent her primary
education in Tanzania and spread out her secondary ed
ucation in Kenya, Uganda and Colorado. She has also
traveled in Egypt, The Congo, Madagascar and Italy.
The diverse student body can be felt in almost every
aspect of Branner life.
Torrence, Calif., described her experiences. "I spoke
with the handful of German students in the program.
Even though they are from the same country, each has
different opinions regarding Hitler and the Holocaust."
However, the students' ambitions are not so diverse.
According to Lisac, 70 percent of the students are plan
ning on becoming doctors, lawyers or engineers.
"But I would be very surprised if these students have
the same career goals after the summer... . The Bran
ner program tries to expose the students to a broad
range of options that Stanford offers," he said, empha
sizing that the Summer Program offers an "invaluable
opportunity for a whole new perspective."
The students are challenged to ask questions about
themselves and their surroundings in their only re
quired course, Critical Thinking, taught through the
Center for Teaching and Learning.
Scott Allen, who teaches the section Critically Look
ing at College and the Process of (Jetting There said, "My
intention is for the course to instill a desire to learn and
ask questions that will lead them where they want to go,
instead of following the most traditional direction."
Although the Summer Session program is a chance
for some high school students to get a running start on
college, many take advantage of the opportunity to ex
plore new academic areas not offered in their high
schools.
"I jumped at the opportunity to take classes not of
fered back home," said Nat Peterson, from the Seattle
area. "This week in my class Magic, Witchcraft and Re
ligion I am learning about the dark side of the shaman.
It's completely new to me."



For high school students, summer can mean any
number of things. Relaxation. Hanging out with
Brandon and Brenda at the Peach Pit. A summer
job. Taking college classes.
Taking college classes?
A select group of 144 students living in Branner Hall
this summer are doing just that.
To participate in Stanford Summer Session, appli
cants are drawn from all around the world. Most of the
students are 16 or 17-years old and will enter their se
nior year in high school this fall.
Hungry for the taste of college, the students immerse
themselves in the Stanford experience. They may enroll
in any of the 8-week classes available to undergraduates.
Many will apply to Stanford, hoping to become part of
the 1994 freshman class.
"I really like Stanford," said Amy Bromberg, a stu
dent at Andover originally from Southern California.
"The more time I spend on campus, the more I want to
go here."
A staff of seven resident assistants and Kassandra Vi
tacca, Branner's Resident Fellow and a Bay Area high
school teacher, help structure resident life.
"It's like freshman year magnified 10 times," said
worn-out looking Stanford senior Eric Bassman, RA.
"They want to do everything Stanford and the sur
rounding area has to offer. In the last two weeks we
went to the beach with Toyon and walked up to the Dish
to see the fireworks. The weekend before, we had a scav
enger hunt in the city and saw the Gay Pride Parade.
And when do they have time to study? I can't really tell
you."
"The Branner students are extremely ambitious —
top notch," according to Andrew Lisac, assistant dean of
the Summer Session. "The energy and excitement in
this group is incredible."
In many respects, they have the same freedoms and
responsibilities as undergraduates. "They treat us like
real college students," said Bromberg. "We can come
and go as we please, no curfew, no bed check. Branner is

nothing like boarding school and other summer pro
grams I looked into."
Budgeting their time is a new concept for some of the
students. "No one tells them to get up out of bed," said
Bassman. "Sometimes that's a problem, but they
learn."
Besides attending class and living in the dorm, they
share meals in Branner Dining Hall with the Toyon un
dergraduate residents.
According to Branner resident Matt Chen, "I've got
roommates I can live with, and I can stomach the dorm
food. Life is nice." Matt also plays Ultimate Frisbee with
a group of undergraduates on Thursdays.
Some people may question the generous amount of
freedom that the Summer Program places on the stu
dents.
But Vitacca said, "These kids want something. They
are serious about looking good and from a perspective
of a high school teacher, half the battle is won when the
students want to obtain something higher."
Vitacca cautioned that the students are not "super
responsible." "They are still 16- and 17-year-old kids
who want to fall in love — maybe not once, but four or
five times over the summer." Like most kids, she added,
"They are very image-conscious."
