# 'One of the things I cherish about this school is flexibility'
## A 						Conversation With: Ewart Thomas 
### 
Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas will step down
next month as dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, ending a five-year tenure
as head of the largest school at
Stanford. Next year, Thomas will
return to teaching his "bread and
butter" course, Psych. 60, as well
as several graduate courses in re
search methods. He will be suc
ceeded by Economics Prof. John
Shoven. Thomas spoke to The
Stanford Weekly's News Editor
Romesh Ratnesar about his term
and the future of H&S.
SW: Why have you decided to re
turn to teaching?
Thomas: There was a natural
end to the post; it was a five-year
position that will come to an end
in the end of August. I think if I
stay away from research very
much longer, it might be very
difficult to come back, so it
makes sense in my professional
life to try to return to a more
normal, professorial life of
teaching and research.
SW: Where does H&S stand
today ? Are we out of the woods
yet, in terms of budget cuts?
Thomas: I'm tempted to contin
ue a mixed metaphor that Presi
dent Casper used in his address
to the Senate, where he said —
quoting someone else — we're
not out of the woods, so we
shouldn't drop anchors as yet.
We are in very good shape
with respect to knowing why the
school should remain unified
and how we might improve our
internal organization of clusters

and departments not just the organiza
tion hut the financing. We have a reason
ably healthy flow of funds, including gifts.
And I think that if we had to face more of
the cuts, and obviously I hope that we
don't, I think the lessons we learned a
year or two ago will help us a lot in coming
out of the cuts in a strong position.
SW: What are the implications of the re
structuring ofH&S going to be?
Thomas:We have 28 departments, and
about the same number of interdepart
mental programs, and we have construed
them as grouped into natural sciences, so
cial sciences, and humanities. Now, we
think of these three clusters as having a
lot in common within the clusters, but we
feel it is also very important for a single or
ganizational unit to be in charge of plan
ning for this group of clusters as a whole.
SW: It seems that this is a philosophical
issue as well as a financial one. Has H&S
become too big for its resources ?
Thomas: In a sense size is a red herring.
One has to look at the issues of education
al philosophy and at a pragmatic level,
how best to live best off our promise of a
superior liberal education for students.
I don't want to overstate the argument,
but it is certainly easier for a school to
maintain its interdisciplinary project —
by that I mean not only having programs
that we call interdisciplinary depart
ments, but supporting joint work by fac
ulty who are in different departments.
It is easier for the school to support in
terdisciplinary projects if all of these de
partments are in the same organizational
home. We have programs like Ethics in

Society, involving professors from eco
nomics, philosophy, political science, the
Law School. These programs would be dif
ficult to mount if we had separate schools
of science, social science and humanities.
SW: Can HAS still afford to fund the
smaller disciplines that have just a hand
ful of majors, or should we be devoting
more money to the larger departments?
Thomas: Again, you've got to be careful
about size. Size is easily measured, but its
usefulness as a planning instrument is
limited. When you have a university that
is great, you expect to find certain disci
plines, certain issues being included in the
students' curriculum and the research
agendum.
Now, philosophy is a foundational dis
cipline — it doesn't suffer from a lack of

majors, but philosophy is one of those dis
ciplines that allows you to see what is
common between, for example, political
science and economics. You've pot to be
careful to examine the usefulness of an
area of study or instruction, a), in some
intrinsic terms, and b), the effect of hav
ing this area of study on neighboring dis
ciplines.
A second issue is how these studies
should be organized. The question of or
ganizing into departments is a separate
one from presence or absence. That has
got to be looked at here. I would think of
reorganizing departments after I have
looked at the intellectual arguments for
putting disciplines together.
I would not base it on some aesthetic
view that certain things look better to
gether. It may or may not make sense to

use the category Romance Lan
guages for instance. I say it
makes sense only if you've done
the analysis to see what value
such an entity would bring to
the teaching and research mis
sion of the school, not because
other universities have a thing
called Romance Languages.
SW: There is a constant effort,
somewhat political, but also
academic, to get other programs
started. There has been in the
past year a big Asian-American
Studies push, and Irish-Ameri
can Studies now as well. What
are the chances of those two pro
grams being approved?
Thomas: These are ideas that
will be tested in the usual way.
It is important to have faculty
support. The usual way is that
you have courses being offered,
and you have a senate proce
dure to become formalized. I see
those things as a natural evolu
tion of student and faculty in
terest. I don't see them as es
sentially political, but rather
evolving based on their own
merit.
SW: But does the University
run the risk of being too flexible
and granting too many re
quests? Will this water down
what we already have ?
Thomas: I don't worry about
that because one of the things I
cherish about this school is flex
ibility. The reason interdepart
mental programs flourish at
Stanford is because good and
exiting ideas are encouraged by
the administration.

SW: Where do you think the Commission
on Undergraduate Education will go?
What are the issues that are most impor
tant?
Thomas: They have got to tackle the in
ternational studies sector, in language, lit
erature and culture. I think an important
desideratum is that undergraduates learn
a second culture, not a second language.
Speaking a common language is no
guarantee that you will have cultural un
derstanding. So the emphasis should be
on making sure that the students learn to
appreciate the different ways people can
put together society without saying soci
eties are equal in any sense but certainly
to develop a respect for alternative ways
for organizing a society. I hope that the
focus on different cultures is the predom
inant focus of the committee.
SW: What has been the difference in your
interaction with President Casper, as op
posed to President Kennedy?
Thomas: I have been impressed by Presi
dent Casper's lawyerly approach — it is a
decided advantage. When we looked at is
sues like domestic partners and the policy
on intellectual property rights, I was im
pressed with what I would attribute to his
jurisprudential training.
SW: What advice would you offer to your
successor?
Thomas The basic advice is to find out
what makes the faculty excited to be at
Stanford. That approach makes the job a
lot of fun and makes it a unique educa
tional experience.
And keep the school unified.

them as grouped into natural sciences, so
cial sciences, and humanities. Now, we
think of these three clusters as having a
lot in common within the clusters, but we
feel it is also very important for a single or
ganizational unit to be in charge of plan
ning for this group of clusters as a whole.
SW: It seems that this is a philosophical
issue as well as a financial one. Has H&S
become too big for its resources ?
Thomas: In a sense size is a red herring.
One has to look at the issues of education
al philosophy and at a pragmatic level,
how best to live best off our promise of a
superior liberal education for students.
I don't want to overstate the argument,
but it is certainly easier for a school to
maintain its interdisciplinary project —
by that I mean not only having programs
that we call interdisciplinary depart
ments, but supporting joint work by fac
ulty who are in different departments.
It is easier for the school to support in
terdisciplinary projects if all of these de
partments are in the same organizational
home. We have programs like Ethics in

Society, involving professors from eco
nomics, philosophy, political science, the
Law School. These programs would be dif
ficult to mount if we had separate schools
of science, social science and humanities.
SW: Can HAS still afford to fund the
smaller disciplines that have just a hand
ful of majors, or should we be devoting
more money to the larger departments?
Thomas: Again, you've got to be careful
about size. Size is easily measured, but its
usefulness as a planning instrument is
limited. When you have a university that
is great, you expect to find certain disci
plines, certain issues being included in the
students' curriculum and the research
agendum.
Now, philosophy is a foundational dis
cipline — it doesn't suffer from a lack of

majors, but philosophy is one of those dis
ciplines that allows you to see what is
common between, for example, political
science and economics. You've pot to be
careful to examine the usefulness of an
area of study or instruction, a), in some
intrinsic terms, and b), the effect of hav
ing this area of study on neighboring dis
ciplines.
A second issue is how these studies
should be organized. The question of or
ganizing into departments is a separate
one from presence or absence. That has
got to be looked at here. I would think of
reorganizing departments after I have
looked at the intellectual arguments for
putting disciplines together.
I would not base it on some aesthetic
view that certain things look better to
gether. It may or may not make sense to

use the category Romance Lan
guages for instance. I say it
makes sense only if you've done
the analysis to see what value
such an entity would bring to
the teaching and research mis
sion of the school, not because
other universities have a thing
called Romance Languages.
SW: There is a constant effort,
somewhat political, but also
academic, to get other programs
started. There has been in the
past year a big Asian-American
Studies push, and Irish-Ameri
can Studies now as well. What
are the chances of those two pro
grams being approved?
Thomas: These are ideas that
will be tested in the usual way.
It is important to have faculty
support. The usual way is that
you have courses being offered,
and you have a senate proce
dure to become formalized. I see
those things as a natural evolu
tion of student and faculty in
terest. I don't see them as es
sentially political, but rather
evolving based on their own
merit.
SW: But does the University
run the risk of being too flexible
and granting too many re
quests? Will this water down
what we already have ?
Thomas: I don't worry about
that because one of the things I
cherish about this school is flex
ibility. The reason interdepart
mental programs flourish at
Stanford is because good and
exiting ideas are encouraged by
the administration.

SW: Where do you think the Commission
on Undergraduate Education will go?
What are the issues that are most impor
tant?
Thomas: They have got to tackle the in
ternational studies sector, in language, lit
erature and culture. I think an important
desideratum is that undergraduates learn
a second culture, not a second language.
Speaking a common language is no
guarantee that you will have cultural un
derstanding. So the emphasis should be
on making sure that the students learn to
appreciate the different ways people can
put together society without saying soci
eties are equal in any sense but certainly
to develop a respect for alternative ways
for organizing a society. I hope that the
focus on different cultures is the predom
inant focus of the committee.
SW: What has been the difference in your
interaction with President Casper, as op
posed to President Kennedy?
Thomas: I have been impressed by Presi
dent Casper's lawyerly approach — it is a
decided advantage. When we looked at is
sues like domestic partners and the policy
on intellectual property rights, I was im
pressed with what I would attribute to his
jurisprudential training.
SW: What advice would you offer to your
successor?
Thomas The basic advice is to find out
what makes the faculty excited to be at
Stanford. That approach makes the job a
lot of fun and makes it a unique educa
tional experience.
And keep the school unified.

Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas will step down
next month as dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, ending a five-year tenure
as head of the largest school at
Stanford. Next year, Thomas will
return to teaching his "bread and
butter" course, Psych. 60, as well
as several graduate courses in re
search methods. He will be suc
ceeded by Economics Prof. John
Shoven. Thomas spoke to The
Stanford Weekly's News Editor
Romesh Ratnesar about his term
and the future of H&S.
SW: Why have you decided to re
turn to teaching?
Thomas: There was a natural
end to the post; it was a five-year
position that will come to an end
in the end of August. I think if I
stay away from research very
much longer, it might be very
difficult to come back, so it
makes sense in my professional
life to try to return to a more
normal, professorial life of
teaching and research.
SW: Where does H&S stand
today ? Are we out of the woods
yet, in terms of budget cuts?
Thomas: I'm tempted to contin
ue a mixed metaphor that Presi
dent Casper used in his address
to the Senate, where he said —
quoting someone else — we're
not out of the woods, so we
shouldn't drop anchors as yet.
We are in very good shape
with respect to knowing why the
school should remain unified
and how we might improve our
internal organization of clusters

and departments not just the organiza
tion hut the financing. We have a reason
ably healthy flow of funds, including gifts.
And I think that if we had to face more of
the cuts, and obviously I hope that we
don't, I think the lessons we learned a
year or two ago will help us a lot in coming
out of the cuts in a strong position.
SW: What are the implications of the re
structuring ofH&S going to be?
Thomas:We have 28 departments, and
about the same number of interdepart
mental programs, and we have construed
them as grouped into natural sciences, so
cial sciences, and humanities. Now, we
think of these three clusters as having a
lot in common within the clusters, but we
feel it is also very important for a single or
