# No Turning Back
## Fran Conley remains cynical, but determined 
### June Cohen 
To hear her tell it, Frances Conley was a far
cry from a warrior just two years ago. But
sitting sideways in her office last week,
muscular legs hanging over the arm of
her chair, Conley doesn't seem one to
back down from a fight.
And she's not. Not anymore.
Since her resignation two years ago and the flood
of media attention it attracted, the blunt (and sharp)
neurosurgeon has gained a great deal of self-confi
dence. "I'm no longer afraid of conflict," she says."It
doesn't bother me that people don't agree with me."
Did it before? "Yes. I would do anything to avoid
conflict. I think most women would."
And while the idea of the outspoken Conley cow
ering from conflict doesn't jibe with her media image,
the contradiction is only part of the enigma she has
become.
After her allegations of "pervasive sexism" hit the
national news two years ago, Conley has inspired both
admiration and contempt, praise and hostility, in
those who have followed her battle. She has spoken at
several graduations and, about every 10 days, receives
a letter from yet another woman she's never met.
Yet some visitors to her office have told her they
were advised not to have contact with her.
Is she a heroine? A pariah? Her reply: "It depends
on who you talk to."
Pessimistic about the future of women doctors
generally and herself specifically, Conley offers few
reassuring words as she looks back over the past two
years and ahead into the foreseeable future.
On an institutional level, she feels some positive
changes have taken place at the School of Medicine —
people are much more communicative and aware of
discrimination issues, for instance — but she re
mains unconvinced of the institution's commitment
to combatting sexism.
On a national level, she is equally cynical. Al
though many more women are entering the field of
medicine now than when she was in school 30 years
ago, she thinks they will be funneled into primary
care, where they will enjoy less prestige and lower pay
than their specialist colleagues, who will more than
likely be male.
And on a personal level, Conley still stands tall,
feeling she was justified in her actions and righteous
in her cause. But in some ways, she feels her public ac
cusations of sexism prevented her from ever rising
within the school's administration.
Conley resigned in June of 1991 because a man she
viewed as sexist was appointed chair of her depart
ment, and she didn't think she could work in the at

mosphere he would create. She returned to the job two
months later because she had believed the Medical
School was making a good-faith effort to improve the
situation and that she could do more good from with
in the institution than she could from the outside.
Two years and hundreds of thousands of dollars
later, the School of Medicine seems to have made
strides toward combating sexism and fostering a
more inclusive atmosphere.
In the past year-and-a-half, about 120 faculty mem
bers —83 percent of the women faculty but only 13 per
cent of the men — have attended workshops on gender
sensitivity or retreats addressing cultural diversity.
Medical School Dean David Korn established a
council on diversity a year ago to advise him on equity
issues, and a comprehensive policy for handling bias
and discrimination complaints has been put in place.
And while everyone seems to agree these changes
have heightened awareness and encouraged people to
talk about issues of discrimination, their long-term
impact is still up for debate. Again, as Conley says,"It
depends on who you talk to."
For administrators, the dedication of financial and
human resources indicates a level of serious institu
tional commitment, particularly in a time of massive
budget cuts. "With all our monetary commitments,
this one has been protected," says Michael Cowan,
Medical School director of student affairs. "The
school has devoted a lot of time, a lot of people and a
lot of money to it," she says. "To me that indicates
commitment."
"I believe the school has made tremendously posi
tive progress in beginning to grapple with complex is
sues of discrimination," Korn said. "That is not to say
that all problems have been eliminated, but the fact of
the matter is, there are a lot of processes in place, a lot
of programs that have been launched, and a lot of
gratifying early results of the effort, especially in re
spect to women and minorities."
"This all happened because of a hell of a lot of hard
work, not because of happenstance," Korn said.
But to Conley, these changes are merely "window
dressing" — surface concessions that treat sexual ha
rassment as a public relations problem, rather than
as a serious offense.
"I still see gender discrimination treated as a pec
cadillo," Conley says. "There's still this old-boys atti
tude that boys will be boys — 'Yes, its wrong; its ille
gal. But gee, we can't possibly even think about trun
cating this guy's career because of it.'
"We have yet to see the institution take these as
pects of sexism seriously, and nothing's going to
change so long as it's not a serious issue," Conley says.

"I don't know how we're going to get that to
change, except by putting into position a more en
lightened leadership," she continues. "The current
leadership isn't particularly enlightened and doesn't
particularly want to become enlightened."
Administrators angrily counter Conley's claims
by pointing to their substantial dedication of re
sources and the difficulties inherent in effecting atti
tudinal changes.
"The process of effecting change in areas like this
is often slow, and I can understand impatience on the
part of those people who have felt discriminated
against and who have not had their concerns re-

sponded to in a manner
they feel is timely," says
Medical School Assoc.
Dean Robert Cutler.
However, Cutler cau
tions that discriminatory
attitudes permeate the
field of medicine and will
not disappear overnight.
Korn also emphasizes the
difficulties in changing peo
ple's attitudes: "Human be
havior is the result of a life
time of learning and experi
ence," he says. "You can't
just dip people in some magic
nectar and suddenly make
them think the way you
want them to think. It just
doesn't happen that way."
'Pollyanna women'
Although the Medical
School initiated many of its
sensitivity programs well
before Conley resigned, her
resignation certainly
brought the issue to the
floor. And so far, it hasn't
budged.
"There's a much greater
awareness of the issues and
a more cohesive feeling
among women faculty,"
says Cowan. She says Con
ley's resignation "sort of
galvanized them into being
more supportive of one an
other and more aware of

their collective well-being."
And this unity, Conley
says, is crucial to progress. Be
cause in some cases, "women
are their own worst enemy."
"We work against our
selves," she explains. "You
have these Pollyanna women
who say, 'Oh I've never seen
discrimination. I've never
been discriminated against.'
Well, all I can tell you is these
women don't have their eyes
open. And that doesn't help
the rest of us who know ex
actly what's happening."
"All I can say to that type of
woman is maybe it hasn't
happened to you, maybe it
hasn't impacted your career.
But I can tell you it's impacted
the career of the person work
ing right next to you. Just
open your eyes and look."
Bewilderment
Although other Medical
School faculty described the
current atmosphere as more
"enlightened" or "commu
nicative," Conley says she
believes the overriding emo
tion is "bewilderment."
"Men in particular," she
said, are "very bewildered
about what in the hell the is
sues are: What does (sexual
harassment) consist of?
What is the problem? What
in the hell do they want?"
By talking to several med
ical groups over the last year
and a half, Conley says she
now better understands
men's perspectives on gen
der discrimination.
"For men, the privilege
they have as a white man in
our society is so pervasive
that it is totally invisible to
them, "she says. "They don't
realize that that which is
handed to them on a silver
platter is really something
that the rest of us — i.e.
women or minority groups
— don't have."
"Therefore — when we as
groups have come to them
and said 'Can we share in this
privilege? Can we work with
you, along side of it, and by
working hard, gain our little
piece ofit?' — they don't know
what we're talking about."
Have we learned?

Despite her own revelations, Conley fears the Uni
versity as a whole hasn't learned much from either
her resignation or any of the publicized sexual ha
rassment cases over the past two years.
Part of the problem, she says, is that the current
grievance procedure for sexual harassment protects
the accused even after they're found guilty by shield
ing their files from community inspection.
"How much do we know about what happened
with Mark Perlroth? Or what the [ report on former
Neurosurgery Chair Prof. Gerald Silverbergl actual
ly said?" Conley demands, naming two men investi
gated for sexual harassment in the past two years.

"We know nothing. The lawyers get involved....
and everything is kept sealed. So all of that information
is not available to anybody."
"We have learned nothing," she reiterates. "We
have not increased the knowledge base of this institu
tion one whit in terms of what is acceptable behavior
and what is not."
A dire prediction
At a recent commencement address at Indiana
University, Conley gave a very dire prediction about
the future of women in her profession.
"I'm very pessimistic," she says.
Because the impending reforms of the health care
system are likely to pressure hospitals to cut back on
specialists and bolster their supply of general practi
tioners, Conley thinks "We're going to see a tremen
dous schism in the ranks of medicine that [is] going to
be along gender lines."
There will be two tiers, she predicts. One populat
ed by the general practitioners, and one by high-paid
specialists.
"We are now taking in medical school classes that
are 35-50 percent women. And we are also being told
that as a profession we have to provide many more pri
mary care physicians than we are currently. Who do
you think is going to be doing primary care?"
"Its a very dire future," she says grimly. "I think
we're going to see the doors of opportunity for women
to train for these highly paid, highly prestigious pos
tions slammed shut."
"If progam directors in neurosurgery get cut back to
one spot for residents per year, do you think they're
going to give that one slot to a woman? No way."
"I just think its going to be so impossible" for
women to work themselves into the higher tiered posi
tions, she says grimly. "It would be so onerous to try to
buck the system."
A changed career
Although Conley resumed her duties at the Medical
School and continues to serve as chief of surgery at the
VA. Hospital even after bucking the system, her ca
reer has not weathered the media storm unchanged.
A two-time Faculty Senate chair, Conley had envi
sioned herself a prime candidate for an administrative
position before she resigned. After earning a degree at
the Graduate School of Business, Conley believed she
was in a strong position to move up.
But "that's all gone now," Conley says. After pub
licly raising issues of sexism, she is seen as a trouble
maker, and pigeonholed as a single-minded crusader
for women's issues.
"That's the only real sorrow I have. I think I was
relatively well strategically placed to move into a posi
tion within an institution where I could have had real
impact. That probably would not be allowed now."
"I have now become a unidimensional person," Con
ley says"I have one dimension to me and it is the realm
of gender discrimination and sexual harassment."
"Particularly in terms of an academic life, I'm sure I'll
never be seen as someone who am serve on committees,"
shesays. " 'she's too one-dimensional,'they'll say. 'All
she's interested in is gender discrimination.' Well
that's bullshit! But how do you fight it?"
Asked whether she regretted her decision to "go
public," Conley replies that the question itself was fun
damentally flawed. She couldn't imagine doing things
differently — not because she's happy with how they
came out, but because she didn't feel she had a choice.
"It really wasn't that much of a decision," Conley
saysdecisively. "I wasn't going to live the rest of my life
being miserably unhappy — life's too short to do that."
"So, 1 can't really look back and say, "Yes, I'm
glad I did it or I wish I hadn't done it." I didn't have
the choice. The choice wasn't there. It had to be
done. Because I wasn't going to spend any more
time in a situation that I thought was really
wrong."
"There was no turning back.

"The process of effecting change in areas like this
is often slow, and I can understand impatience on the
part of those people who have felt discriminated
against and who have not had their concerns re-

sponded to in a manner
they feel is timely," says
Medical School Assoc.
Dean Robert Cutler.
However, Cutler cau
tions that discriminatory
attitudes permeate the
field of medicine and will
not disappear overnight.
Korn also emphasizes the
difficulties in changing peo
ple's attitudes: "Human be
havior is the result of a life
time of learning and experi
ence," he says. "You can't
just dip people in some magic
nectar and suddenly make
them think the way you
want them to think. It just
doesn't happen that way."
'Pollyanna women'
Although the Medical
School initiated many of its
sensitivity programs well
before Conley resigned, her
resignation certainly
brought the issue to the
floor. And so far, it hasn't
budged.
"There's a much greater
awareness of the issues and
a more cohesive feeling
among women faculty,"
says Cowan. She says Con
ley's resignation "sort of
galvanized them into being
more supportive of one an
other and more aware of

their collective well-being."
And this unity, Conley
says, is crucial to progress. Be
cause in some cases, "women
are their own worst enemy."
"We work against our
selves," she explains. "You
have these Pollyanna women
who say, 'Oh I've never seen
discrimination. I've never
been discriminated against.'
Well, all I can tell you is these
women don't have their eyes
open. And that doesn't help
the rest of us who know ex
actly what's happening."
"All I can say to that type of
woman is maybe it hasn't
happened to you, maybe it
hasn't impacted your career.
But I can tell you it's impacted
the career of the person work
ing right next to you. Just
open your eyes and look."
Bewilderment
Although other Medical
School faculty described the
current atmosphere as more
"enlightened" or "commu
nicative," Conley says she
believes the overriding emo
tion is "bewilderment."
"Men in particular," she
said, are "very bewildered
about what in the hell the is
sues are: What does (sexual
harassment) consist of?
What is the problem? What
in the hell do they want?"
By talking to several med
ical groups over the last year
and a half, Conley says she
now better understands
men's perspectives on gen
der discrimination.
"For men, the privilege
they have as a white man in
our society is so pervasive
that it is totally invisible to
them, "she says. "They don't
realize that that which is
handed to them on a silver
platter is really something
that the rest of us — i.e.
women or minority groups
— don't have."
"Therefore — when we as
groups have come to them
and said 'Can we share in this
privilege? Can we work with
you, along side of it, and by
working hard, gain our little
piece ofit?' — they don't know
what we're talking about."
Have we learned?

Despite her own revelations, Conley fears the Uni
versity as a whole hasn't learned much from either
her resignation or any of the publicized sexual ha
rassment cases over the past two years.
Part of the problem, she says, is that the current
grievance procedure for sexual harassment protects
the accused even after they're found guilty by shield
ing their files from community inspection.
"How much do we know about what happened
with Mark Perlroth? Or what the [ report on former
Neurosurgery Chair Prof. Gerald Silverbergl actual
ly said?" Conley demands, naming two men investi
gated for sexual harassment in the past two years.

"We know nothing. The lawyers get involved....
and everything is kept sealed. So all of that information
is not available to anybody."
"We have learned nothing," she reiterates. "We
have not increased the knowledge base of this institu
tion one whit in terms of what is acceptable behavior
and what is not."
A dire prediction
At a recent commencement address at Indiana
University, Conley gave a very dire prediction about
the future of women in her profession.
"I'm very pessimistic," she says.
Because the impending reforms of the health care
system are likely to pressure hospitals to cut back on
specialists and bolster their supply of general practi
tioners, Conley thinks "We're going to see a tremen
dous schism in the ranks of medicine that [is] going to
be along gender lines."
There will be two tiers, she predicts. One populat
ed by the general practitioners, and one by high-paid
specialists.
"We are now taking in medical school classes that
are 35-50 percent women. And we are also being told
that as a profession we have to provide many more pri
mary care physicians than we are currently. Who do
you think is going to be doing primary care?"
"Its a very dire future," she says grimly. "I think
we're going to see the doors of opportunity for women
to train for these highly paid, highly prestigious pos
tions slammed shut."
"If progam directors in neurosurgery get cut back to
one spot for residents per year, do you think they're
going to give that one slot to a woman? No way."
"I just think its going to be so impossible" for
women to work themselves into the higher tiered posi
tions, she says grimly. "It would be so onerous to try to
buck the system."
A changed career
Although Conley resumed her duties at the Medical
School and continues to serve as chief of surgery at the
VA. Hospital even after bucking the system, her ca
reer has not weathered the media storm unchanged.
A two-time Faculty Senate chair, Conley had envi
sioned herself a prime candidate for an administrative
position before she resigned. After earning a degree at
the Graduate School of Business, Conley believed she
was in a strong position to move up.
But "that's all gone now," Conley says. After pub
licly raising issues of sexism, she is seen as a trouble
maker, and pigeonholed as a single-minded crusader
for women's issues.
"That's the only real sorrow I have. I think I was
relatively well strategically placed to move into a posi
tion within an institution where I could have had real
impact. That probably would not be allowed now."
"I have now become a unidimensional person," Con
ley says"I have one dimension to me and it is the realm
of gender discrimination and sexual harassment."
"Particularly in terms of an academic life, I'm sure I'll
never be seen as someone who am serve on committees,"
shesays. " 'she's too one-dimensional,'they'll say. 'All
she's interested in is gender discrimination.' Well
that's bullshit! But how do you fight it?"
Asked whether she regretted her decision to "go
public," Conley replies that the question itself was fun
damentally flawed. She couldn't imagine doing things
differently — not because she's happy with how they
came out, but because she didn't feel she had a choice.
"It really wasn't that much of a decision," Conley
saysdecisively. "I wasn't going to live the rest of my life
being miserably unhappy — life's too short to do that."
"So, 1 can't really look back and say, "Yes, I'm
glad I did it or I wish I hadn't done it." I didn't have
the choice. The choice wasn't there. It had to be
done. Because I wasn't going to spend any more
time in a situation that I thought was really
wrong."
"There was no turning back.

To hear her tell it, Frances Conley was a far
cry from a warrior just two years ago. But
sitting sideways in her office last week,
muscular legs hanging over the arm of
her chair, Conley doesn't seem one to
back down from a fight.
And she's not. Not anymore.
Since her resignation two years ago and the flood
of media attention it attracted, the blunt (and sharp)
neurosurgeon has gained a great deal of self-confi
dence. "I'm no longer afraid of conflict," she says."It
doesn't bother me that people don't agree with me."
Did it before? "Yes. I would do anything to avoid
conflict. I think most women would."
And while the idea of the outspoken Conley cow
ering from conflict doesn't jibe with her media image,
the contradiction is only part of the enigma she has
become.
After her allegations of "pervasive sexism" hit the
national news two years ago, Conley has inspired both
admiration and contempt, praise and hostility, in
those who have followed her battle. She has spoken at
several graduations and, about every 10 days, receives
a letter from yet another woman she's never met.
Yet some visitors to her office have told her they
were advised not to have contact with her.
Is she a heroine? A pariah? Her reply: "It depends
on who you talk to."
Pessimistic about the future of women doctors
generally and herself specifically, Conley offers few
reassuring words as she looks back over the past two
years and ahead into the foreseeable future.
On an institutional level, she feels some positive
changes have taken place at the School of Medicine —
people are much more communicative and aware of
discrimination issues, for instance — but she re
mains unconvinced of the institution's commitment
to combatting sexism.
On a national level, she is equally cynical. Al
though many more women are entering the field of
medicine now than when she was in school 30 years
ago, she thinks they will be funneled into primary
care, where they will enjoy less prestige and lower pay
than their specialist colleagues, who will more than
likely be male.
And on a personal level, Conley still stands tall,
feeling she was justified in her actions and righteous
in her cause. But in some ways, she feels her public ac
cusations of sexism prevented her from ever rising
within the school's administration.
Conley resigned in June of 1991 because a man she
viewed as sexist was appointed chair of her depart
ment, and she didn't think she could work in the at

mosphere he would create. She returned to the job two
months later because she had believed the Medical
School was making a good-faith effort to improve the
situation and that she could do more good from with
in the institution than she could from the outside.
Two years and hundreds of thousands of dollars
later, the School of Medicine seems to have made
strides toward combating sexism and fostering a
more inclusive atmosphere.
In the past year-and-a-half, about 120 faculty mem
bers —83 percent of the women faculty but only 13 per
cent of the men — have attended workshops on gender
sensitivity or retreats addressing cultural diversity.
Medical School Dean David Korn established a
council on diversity a year ago to advise him on equity
issues, and a comprehensive policy for handling bias
and discrimination complaints has been put in place.
And while everyone seems to agree these changes
have heightened awareness and encouraged people to
talk about issues of discrimination, their long-term
impact is still up for debate. Again, as Conley says,"It
depends on who you talk to."
For administrators, the dedication of financial and
human resources indicates a level of serious institu
tional commitment, particularly in a time of massive
budget cuts. "With all our monetary commitments,
this one has been protected," says Michael Cowan,
Medical School director of student affairs. "The
school has devoted a lot of time, a lot of people and a
lot of money to it," she says. "To me that indicates
commitment."
"I believe the school has made tremendously posi
tive progress in beginning to grapple with complex is
sues of discrimination," Korn said. "That is not to say
that all problems have been eliminated, but the fact of
the matter is, there are a lot of processes in place, a lot
of programs that have been launched, and a lot of
gratifying early results of the effort, especially in re
spect to women and minorities."
"This all happened because of a hell of a lot of hard
work, not because of happenstance," Korn said.
But to Conley, these changes are merely "window
dressing" — surface concessions that treat sexual ha
rassment as a public relations problem, rather than
as a serious offense.
"I still see gender discrimination treated as a pec
cadillo," Conley says. "There's still this old-boys atti
tude that boys will be boys — 'Yes, its wrong; its ille
gal. But gee, we can't possibly even think about trun
cating this guy's career because of it.'
"We have yet to see the institution take these as
pects of sexism seriously, and nothing's going to
change so long as it's not a serious issue," Conley says.

"I don't know how we're going to get that to
change, except by putting into position a more en
lightened leadership," she continues. "The current
leadership isn't particularly enlightened and doesn't
particularly want to become enlightened."
Administrators angrily counter Conley's claims
by pointing to their substantial dedication of re
sources and the difficulties inherent in effecting atti
tudinal changes.
"The process of effecting change in areas like this
is often slow, and I can understand impatience on the
part of those people who have felt discriminated
against and who have not had their concerns re-

sponded to in a manner
they feel is timely," says
Medical School Assoc.
Dean Robert Cutler.
However, Cutler cau
tions that discriminatory
attitudes permeate the
field of medicine and will
not disappear overnight.
Korn also emphasizes the
difficulties in changing peo
ple's attitudes: "Human be
havior is the result of a life
time of learning and experi
ence," he says. "You can't
just dip people in some magic
nectar and suddenly make
them think the way you
want them to think. It just
doesn't happen that way."
'Pollyanna women'
Although the Medical

sensitivity programs well

resignation certainly

other and more aware of

their collective well-being."
And this unity, Conley
says, is crucial to progress. Be
cause in some cases, "women
are their own worst enemy."
"We work against our
selves," she explains. "You
have these Pollyanna women
who say, 'Oh I've never seen
discrimination. I've never
been discriminated against.'
Well, all I can tell you is these
women don't have their eyes
open. And that doesn't help
the rest of us who know ex
actly what's happening."
"All I can say to that type of
woman is maybe it hasn't
happened to you, maybe it
hasn't impacted your career.
But I can tell you it's impacted
the career of the person work
ing right next to you. Just
open your eyes and look."
Bewilderment
Although other Medical
School faculty described the
current atmosphere as more
"enlightened" or "commu

believes the overriding emo
tion is "bewilderment."
"Men in particular," she

"Therefore — when we as

going to give that one slot to a woman? No way."
"I just think its going to be so impossible" for
women to work themselves into the higher tiered posi
tions, she says grimly. "It would be so onerous to try to
buck the system."
A changed career
Although Conley resumed her duties at the Medical
School and continues to serve as chief of surgery at the
VA. Hospital even after bucking the system, her ca
reer has not weathered the media storm unchanged.
A two-time Faculty Senate chair, Conley had envi
sioned herself a prime candidate for an administrative
position before she resigned. After earning a degree at
the Graduate School of Business, Conley believed she
was in a strong position to move up.
But "that's all gone now," Conley says. After pub
licly raising issues of sexism, she is seen as a trouble
maker, and pigeonholed as a single-minded crusader
for women's issues.
"That's the only real sorrow I have. I think I was
relatively well strategically placed to move into a posi
tion within an institution where I could have had real
impact. That probably would not be allowed now."
"I have now become a unidimensional person," Con
ley says"I have one dimension to me and it is the realm
of gender discrimination and sexual harassment."
"Particularly in terms of an academic life, I'm sure I'll
never be seen as someone who am serve on committees,"
shesays. " 'she's too one-dimensional,'they'll say. 'All
she's interested in is gender discrimination.' Well
that's bullshit! But how do you fight it?"
Asked whether she regretted her decision to "go
public," Conley replies that the question itself was fun
damentally flawed. She couldn't imagine doing things
differently — not because she's happy with how they
came out, but because she didn't feel she had a choice.
"It really wasn't that much of a decision," Conley
saysdecisively. "I wasn't going to live the rest of my life
being miserably unhappy — life's too short to do that."
"So, 1 can't really look back and say, "Yes, I'm
glad I did it or I wish I hadn't done it." I didn't have
the choice. The choice wasn't there. It had to be
done. Because I wasn't going to spend any more
time in a situation that I thought was really
wrong."
"There was no turning back.

To hear her tell it, Frances Conley was a far
cry from a warrior just two years ago. But
sitting sideways in her office last week,
muscular legs hanging over the arm of
her chair, Conley doesn't seem one to
back down from a fight.
And she's not. Not anymore.
Since her resignation two years ago and the flood
of media attention it attracted, the blunt (and sharp)
neurosurgeon has gained a great deal of self-confi
dence. "I'm no longer afraid of conflict," she says."It
doesn't bother me that people don't agree with me."
Did it before? "Yes. I would do anything to avoid
conflict. I think most women would."
And while the idea of the outspoken Conley cow
ering from conflict doesn't jibe with her media image,
the contradiction is only part of the enigma she has
become.
After her allegations of "pervasive sexism" hit the
national news two years ago, Conley has inspired both
admiration and contempt, praise and hostility, in
those who have followed her battle. She has spoken at
several graduations and, about every 10 days, receives
a letter from yet another woman she's never met.
Yet some visitors to her office have told her they
were advised not to have contact with her.
Is she a heroine? A pariah? Her reply: "It depends
on who you talk to."
Pessimistic about the future of women doctors
generally and herself specifically, Conley offers few
reassuring words as she looks back over the past two
years and ahead into the foreseeable future.
On an institutional level, she feels some positive
changes have taken place at the School of Medicine —
people are much more communicative and aware of
discrimination issues, for instance — but she re
mains unconvinced of the institution's commitment
to combatting sexism.
On a national level, she is equally cynical. Al
though many more women are entering the field of
medicine now than when she was in school 30 years
ago, she thinks they will be funneled into primary
care, where they will enjoy less prestige and lower pay
than their specialist colleagues, who will more than
likely be male.
And on a personal level, Conley still stands tall,
feeling she was justified in her actions and righteous
in her cause. But in some ways, she feels her public ac
cusations of sexism prevented her from ever rising
within the school's administration.
Conley resigned in June of 1991 because a man she
viewed as sexist was appointed chair of her depart
ment, and she didn't think she could work in the at

mosphere he would create. She returned to the job two
months later because she had believed the Medical
School was making a good-faith effort to improve the
situation and that she could do more good from with
in the institution than she could from the outside.
Two years and hundreds of thousands of dollars
later, the School of Medicine seems to have made
strides toward combating sexism and fostering a
more inclusive atmosphere.
In the past year-and-a-half, about 120 faculty mem
bers —83 percent of the women faculty but only 13 per
cent of the men — have attended workshops on gender
sensitivity or retreats addressing cultural diversity.
Medical School Dean David Korn established a
council on diversity a year ago to advise him on equity
issues, and a comprehensive policy for handling bias
and discrimination complaints has been put in place.
And while everyone seems to agree these changes
have heightened awareness and encouraged people to
talk about issues of discrimination, their long-term
impact is still up for debate. Again, as Conley says,"It
depends on who you talk to."
For administrators, the dedication of financial and
human resources indicates a level of serious institu
tional commitment, particularly in a time of massive
budget cuts. "With all our monetary commitments,
this one has been protected," says Michael Cowan,
Medical School director of student affairs. "The
school has devoted a lot of time, a lot of people and a
lot of money to it," she says. "To me that indicates
commitment."
"I believe the school has made tremendously posi
tive progress in beginning to grapple with complex is
sues of discrimination," Korn said. "That is not to say
that all problems have been eliminated, but the fact of
the matter is, there are a lot of processes in place, a lot
of programs that have been launched, and a lot of
gratifying early results of the effort, especially in re
spect to women and minorities."
"This all happened because of a hell of a lot of hard
work, not because of happenstance," Korn said.
But to Conley, these changes are merely "window
dressing" — surface concessions that treat sexual ha
rassment as a public relations problem, rather than
as a serious offense.
"I still see gender discrimination treated as a pec
cadillo," Conley says. "There's still this old-boys atti
tude that boys will be boys — 'Yes, its wrong; its ille
gal. But gee, we can't possibly even think about trun
cating this guy's career because of it.'
"We have yet to see the institution take these as
pects of sexism seriously, and nothing's going to
change so long as it's not a serious issue," Conley says.

"I don't know how we're going to get that to
change, except by putting into position a more en
lightened leadership," she continues. "The current
leadership isn't particularly enlightened and doesn't
particularly want to become enlightened."
Administrators angrily counter Conley's claims
by pointing to their substantial dedication of re
sources and the difficulties inherent in effecting atti
tudinal changes.
"The process of effecting change in areas like this
is often slow, and I can understand impatience on the
part of those people who have felt discriminated
against and who have not had their concerns re-

sponded to in a manner
they feel is timely," says
Medical School Assoc.
Dean Robert Cutler.
However, Cutler cau
tions that discriminatory
attitudes permeate the
field of medicine and will
not disappear overnight.
Korn also emphasizes the
difficulties in changing peo
ple's attitudes: "Human be
havior is the result of a life
time of learning and experi
ence," he says. "You can't
just dip people in some magic
nectar and suddenly make
them think the way you
want them to think. It just
doesn't happen that way."
'Pollyanna women'
Although the Medical
School initiated many of its
sensitivity programs well
before Conley resigned, her
resignation certainly
brought the issue to the
floor. And so far, it hasn't
budged.
"There's a much greater
awareness of the issues and
a more cohesive feeling
among women faculty,"
says Cowan. She says Con
ley's resignation "sort of
galvanized them into being
more supportive of one an
other and more aware of

their collective well-being."
And this unity, Conley
says, is crucial to progress. Be
cause in some cases, "women
are their own worst enemy."
"We work against our
selves," she explains. "You
have these Pollyanna women
who say, 'Oh I've never seen
discrimination. I've never
been discriminated against.'
Well, all I can tell you is these
women don't have their eyes
open. And that doesn't help
the rest of us who know ex
actly what's happening."
"All I can say to that type of
woman is maybe it hasn't
happened to you, maybe it
hasn't impacted your career.
But I can tell you it's impacted
the career of the person work
ing right next to you. Just
open your eyes and look."
Bewilderment
Although other Medical
School faculty described the
current atmosphere as more
"enlightened" or "commu
nicative," Conley says she
believes the overriding emo
tion is "bewilderment."
"Men in particular," she
said, are "very bewildered
about what in the hell the is
sues are: What does (sexual
harassment) consist of?
What is the problem? What
in the hell do they want?"
By talking to several med
ical groups over the last year
and a half, Conley says she
now better understands
men's perspectives on gen
der discrimination.
"For men, the privilege
they have as a white man in
our society is so pervasive
that it is totally invisible to
them, "she says. "They don't
realize that that which is
handed to them on a silver
platter is really something
that the rest of us — i.e.
women or minority groups
— don't have."
"Therefore — when we as
groups have come to them
and said 'Can we share in this
privilege? Can we work with
you, along side of it, and by
working hard, gain our little
piece ofit?' — they don't know
what we're talking about."
Have we learned?

Despite her own revelations, Conley fears the Uni
versity as a whole hasn't learned much from either
her resignation or any of the publicized sexual ha
rassment cases over the past two years.
Part of the problem, she says, is that the current
grievance procedure for sexual harassment protects
the accused even after they're found guilty by shield
ing their files from community inspection.
"How much do we know about what happened
with Mark Perlroth? Or what the [ report on former
Neurosurgery Chair Prof. Gerald Silverbergl actual
ly said?" Conley demands, naming two men investi
gated for sexual harassment in the past two years.

"We know nothing. The lawyers get involved....
and everything is kept sealed. So all of that information
is not available to anybody."
"We have learned nothing," she reiterates. "We
have not increased the knowledge base of this institu
tion one whit in terms of what is acceptable behavior
and what is not."
A dire prediction
At a recent commencement address at Indiana
University, Conley gave a very dire prediction about
the future of women in her profession.
"I'm very pessimistic," she says.
Because the impending reforms of the health care
system are likely to pressure hospitals to cut back on
specialists and bolster their supply of general practi
tioners, Conley thinks "We're going to see a tremen
dous schism in the ranks of medicine that [is] going to
be along gender lines."
There will be two tiers, she predicts. One populat
ed by the general practitioners, and one by high-paid
specialists.
"We are now taking in medical school classes that
are 35-50 percent women. And we are also being told
that as a profession we have to provide many more pri
mary care physicians than we are currently. Who do
you think is going to be doing primary care?"
"Its a very dire future," she says grimly. "I think
we're going to see the doors of opportunity for women
to train for these highly paid, highly prestigious pos
tions slammed shut."
"If progam directors in neurosurgery get cut back to
one spot for residents per year, do you think they're
going to give that one slot to a woman? No way."
"I just think its going to be so impossible" for
women to work themselves into the higher tiered posi
tions, she says grimly. "It would be so onerous to try to
buck the system."

Although Conley resumed her duties at the Medical
School and continues to serve as chief of surgery at the
VA. Hospital even after bucking the system, her ca
reer has not weathered the media storm unchanged.
A two-time Faculty Senate chair, Conley had envi
