# Casper rescues policy, sets sights on fall finish
## 
### June Cohen Senior staff writer 
After two-and-a-half years of rejected drafts and
countless claims that it was "almost done," officials
involved in crafting the sexual harassment policy
say the end is in sight. Really.
After receiving preliminary approval from the
Faculty Senate this May, the policy will be revised
this summer by University President Gerhard
Casper, who now has made the policy his personal
project.
"I don't want to see us go through another school
year without a sexual harassment policy," Casper
said in an interview yesterday. Although he had
been out of town for several days, Casper embarked
on the project yesterday and said he plans to finish
revising it by the first senate meeting in the fall.
However, the current draft is far from polished,
in many people's eyes. And it may undergo substan
tial revision before the October meeting.
Even as the senate endorsed the principles un
derlying the policy, Asst. Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl raised some serious questions about its
legitimacy.
Karl pointed out that neither she nor Neuro
surgery Prof. Frances Conley — two of the only
prominent women in academia who have gone pub
lic with allegations of sexual harassment and re
mained in their respective fields — nor any other
campus expert such as Law Prof. Deborah Rhode,
was contacted at any point during the drafting
process.
"Isn't that amazing?" Conley asked in an inter
view with The Weekly. "You have these people on
campus who know a hell of a lot, and (they] haven't
used either of them — any of them."
Conley, who said she was more than willing to
help revise the policy but has not been asked, voiced
her dissatisfaction with its current format.
"The policy that was promulgated is awful," she
said. "It's poorly written. You really can't take it and
say, 'OK, I've got a problem, how do I get it adjudi
cated through this institution?' You cant do it. It's a
mish-mash."
Indeed, the "simple matter of language" will be
among Casper's top priorities as he struggles to
make the "legalistic" draft more readable and user
friendly, he said.
Casper plans to heed the senate's advice and so
licit the comments of campus experts, a process he
said he began over the phone yesterday in "the first
of what I assume will be many meetings" with
Rhode.
The policy's controversial confidentiality clause
— which critics say does not provide sufficient pro
tection to the victim — will be among those tenets
that fall under Casper's scrutiny. The relative em
phasis placed on formal and informal procedures
will also be examined, he said.
Document in distress
Many faculty members expressed hope that
Casper would be able to improve the draft — and
quickly. The revised version — which will replace the
University's current Sexual Harassment Policy, writ
ten in 1978 — has been a long time coming, they say.
The urgency of the policy's completion was un
derscored at the senate meeting, when Karl, who
chairs the senate steering committee, told the sen
ate that four sexual harassment cases had come to
her attention in the last four months and that im
proved mechanisms must be put in place to respon
sibly handle them.
Sexual harassment "results in unfinished classes,
unfinished degrees, unfinished careers and unfin
ished lives," Karl said. "It destroys reputations. It
can absolutely be prevented, and it can be handled
better than any universities handle it today."
Casper, it seems, is up to the challenge.
"It is I who rescued this issue from the doldrums
of inaction," Casper said at an ASSU Senate meeting
this spring. And while his proclamation may sound
somewhat theatrical, the policy was, in many ways,
a document in distress.
Each phase of the policy's two-and-a-half-year
drafting process has brought some measure of em
barrassment to University officials. Beginning two
years ago this month, draft after draft of the policy
was sent back to the drawing board for revisions and
corrections, until an actual policy seemed as elusive
as Waldo.
Drafts have been criticized, at different points,
for inaccuracy, bloatedness, ambiguity and a lack of
student input. One recent draft was rejected by the
University Cabinet because members "just wanted
it to be a little — better," then-Provost Gerald
Lieberman said in January.
The release of the final draft this April raised an
other round of criticism and accusations as the cam
pus community viewed the document in its entirety
for the first time. Students and staff criticized the
policy for its ambiguity and what has been called a
weak confidentiality clause.
The currer,; draft of the policy:
• defines sexual harassment as "unwanted sexual
advances, requests for sexuai favors and other visu-

al, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature"
when it is implied that submission to the conduct
will affect the person's academic or professional ca
reer; or when the conduct has an effect of interfering
with an individual's academic or work performance;
• says "every reasonable effort will be made to
protect the privacy of the complainant, and the per
son charged, in the investigation and resolution
process, subject to the need to conduct a full and im
partial investigation . . ;
• distinguishes between "concerns," which are
informal and can remain confidential, and

"charges," which are formal and must be investigat
ed fully; and
• calls for the creation of a Sexual Harassment
Panel, to investigate formal charges and Sexual Ha
rassment Advisers, whom complainants can ap
proach for advice or assistance.
'The current draft is not adequate'
Backing up her belief that the "current draft is
not adequate," Karl criticized some of the policy's
central tenets — including its definition of sexual
harassment and its stance toward confidentiality
and reprisals.
Karl, who filed and won a grievance 10 years ago
against a senior faculty member at Harvard Univer
sity, offered Casper written recommendations, ad
dressed to the Senate, which called for numerous
changes in the policy's wording and content.
Among them were suggestions that Casper:
• add information to the introductory section in
forming victims whom they can consult for advice,
informal counseling and more formal assistance;
• include concrete examples of unacceptable be
havior to illustrate the definition of harassment;
• include a specific statement on due process
(none exists in the current draft); and
• strengthen and clarify the University's position
on confidentiality.
Karl also suggested that Casper solicit advice
from several other faculty members, including Con
ley, Rhode (who wrote a book on the subject and is
widely regarded as an expert on sexual harassment)
and Education Prof. Myra Strober, who chairs the
Provost's Committee on the Recruitment and Re
tention of Women Faculty.
'Work group* starts next week
Although Casper alone will be responsible for re
vising the policy, he will not be toiling in solitude.
A work group comprised primarily of staff mem
bers — including some of the same people who
worked on the policy itself — will spend the summer
developing the policy's supporting guidelines and
materials.
Although all its members have not yet been de
termined, the group will "hopefully" start working
next week, said Tom Matteoli, director of Employee
Relations. The seven- or eight-member group will
meet "at least weekly" in order to complete the sup
porting documents in time for a simultaneous re
lease with the policy, he said.
Matteoli's work group is charged with creating
procedural guidelines that will allow community
members — and particularly those charged with
helping others through the system — to understand
and implement the policy.
The group will also develop ways to educate com
munity members about sexual harassment and com
municate information about the University's policy
and resources.

Sparked by recommendations in the Sexual As
sault Task Force Report, plans to revise the Univer
sity's sexual harassment policy actually predated
the barrage of media attention caused by Conley's
resignation in June 1991.
However, it ivas her resignation and subsequent
return that focused attention on the University's pol
icy- in-the-making.
Initially, officials planned to produce one overarch
ing Policy on Unacceptable Sexual Conduct that would
cover the continuum from gender discrimination to
rape. However, these plans were scrapped earlier this
year, when officials decided to keep the sexual assault
and sexual harassment policies separate documents.
