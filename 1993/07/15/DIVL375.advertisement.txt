It's the middle of the summer.
You have nothing to show for it except an
imaginary tan line, a still-full list of
"things to do over break" and a crush on
that special someone who looks unrealis
tically good in Raybans.
Chances are that someone works at The
Weekly.
Why?
Because he/she knows that it's an excel
lent way to meet really keen people, play
on really successful IM teams, eat really
free food and have some really great fun
writing, drawing or taking pictures.
The Stanford Weekly.
723-4632.
Because writing for a newspaper in the
summer is as American as a talking
mouse.
Come to the staff meeting
today at 2:00 p.m. at the
mighty and holy grounds
of The Stanford Daily in
the Storke Publications
Building.
