# The 						Few, the Proud, the Women of Hoover
## 
### 
Like women at other bastions of higher learning, female
fellows of the Hoover Institution are still vastly out
numbered by their male counterparts. But to hear them
tell it, the struggle to retain identities as women while
working in a male-dominated environment which is often
perceived as conservative and stodgy has been well worth it.
The numbers show that Hoover still has a considerable
way to go towards achieving numerical parity between men
and women. Out of 97 fellows listed in the 1992 annual report
of the public-policy think tank, only 10 were female.
Hoover's record resembles closely that of the University as
a whole in its hiring of female faculty. According to a 1990 re
port by the Office for Multicultural Development, women
make up 68 percent of the Stanford staff, but only 83 of Stan
ford's 897 tenured faculty — 9.3 percent — are female.
And despite the efforts of people like Senior Research Fellow
Rita Ricardo-Campbell to attract more women to Hoover, the
situation may not be changing anytime soon — due to financial
constraints on hiring, Hoover Director John Raisian warned.
"If you take senior fellows and senior research fellows,
since 1989 we have hired six people, three men and three

women," he said. "We are aware of the fact that women are
underrepresented."
Raisian said that a 1989 agreement between the Hoover In
stitution and the University suggests "an affirmative action
component" to the Institution's hiring process. But a combi
nation of forces — including shortages in money and prospec
tive women fellows and a still-influential old boy network —
may make that agreement more than a little difficult to fulfill.
Scoping for women
Ricardo-Campbell — presently the only female senior fel
low at Hoover and the wife of former Hoover director W.
Glenn Campbell — said she has been encouraging the Insti
tution to hire more women. In the past, the central problem
was locating women candidates whom the male fellows would
find acceptable, she said.
Efforts to add more female fellows have turned up mixed
results. One prospective candidate left the Institution after
several years when her husband was unable to find a com
mensurate job in academia close to Stanford. Another was
not promoted to the position of senior fellow "because some
felt she could not compete in public presentation." The for
mer candidate is now a full professor at the University of
Pennsylvania.

"I have tried to get at least one other female at senior fellow

level," Ricardo-Campbell said. "It's very difficult to

get top-notch faculty — in academia as

compared to business — to ac-

cept women as just as

capable as the
~ , , ' »

men.

However, monetary constraints have curtailed Hoover's
recruitment of new fellows. Ricardo-Campbell said that the
standing search committee she previously sat on is no longer
active. "We still meet as senior fellows when names come up,
but there is a shortage of money at the moment," she said.
Though she does not see the current numerical distribu
tion of female fellows as optimal, Ricardo-Campbell said she
is used to being a lonely woman in a male-dominated world.
The situation at Hoover, in her estimation, is not unusually
hostile to women.
"I find the Hoover Institution doesn't go out of its way to
treat anyone differently from anyone else," she said. "There are
individual fellows who are more male chauvinist than others."
She added that such incidents of chauvinism are "obvious
to me, but perhaps not to all of my male colleagues."
"At times in the senior commons — a place modeled after
Harvard's where there's tea and coffee — some women's re
marks in the past have been ignored or shouted over by their
male colleagues," she said.
Ricardo-Campbell said she has experienced gender based
discrimination as the only woman on various executive
boards and committees.
Another Hoover woman, Senior Research Fellow Annelise
Anderson, expressed extreme satisfaction with the atmos
phere at the Institution, regardless of any numerical imbal
ance. "I don't have the feeling of it being an exclusively male
environment at all," she said.
"I think it's a superb environment," said Anderson, who is
married to Senior Fellow Martin Anderson. (Among Hoover
women, only Anderson and Campbell are married to other
fellows.) "I've heard people from elsewhere on campus com
ment that they find it the most open environment for the dis
cussion of ideas on the campus. Our conferences usually have
a diversity of views."
Research Fellow Agnes Peterson, the only female curator
at Hoover's West European Collection, agreed. "I've come up
through the ranks," she said, "and [Hoover] has given me the
chance to do the best I could do."
Peterson also defended her commitment to women's is
sues, despite Hoover's historically conservative reputation.
She said she has fielded "no resentment" from women who
claim she is betraying feminist causes by working at Hoover.
"I am a member of the Women's History Reading Group,
and they are all very grateful that I am involved with the In
stitution," she said.
Likewise, Ricardo-Campbell downplays any tension that
might exist between herself and women's groups on campus.
"Let's just say I had a debate here with Phyllis Schlafly, and
I won," she said. "I've supported (the Equal Rights Amend
ment] and have been known as an advocate for women's
rights for many years."
Sherri Mateo, deputy director at the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender, said the number of women
scholars at Hoover is "not enough, but it's improving."
She said she is not particularly bothered by the association
of women with a conservative think tank like Hoover. "There
is a general tendency to think of the women's movement as
completely unified," she said. "But in the last 10 years there
has been a greater recognition that women can have great di
versity of opinion but still work towards unified goals."
Finding the fellows
Women fellows like Anderson and Ricardo-Campbell are
in a scarce minority largely due to the hiring process which
predated the 1989 Hoover-Stanford agreement: a mix of for
mal searches and old-boy networking.
Senior fellow and senior research fellow positions are filled
by academic searches much like those conducted by universi
ties. "Appointments are raised among all the senior fellows,"
Director Raisian said. "Based on the discussion, I make a
judgment on whether to move ahead with a recommendation
to the President I Casper]." j

Assistant Director for Research Noel Kolak

said the Institution also runs a Na

tional and Peace Fellows

Program, one

year fel-

lowships designed for young post-doctoral scholars just
breaking into the academy. She said the program has had
success in bringing "a significant number of women to
Hoover for a year's leave for intensive research. We make
every effort to attract women."
Four out of this year's 10 National and Peace Fellows are
women, according to Anderson.
While strained funding has put the practical question of
diversity on hold, the principle remains a live concern at
Hoover. Michele Horaney, Hoover's press relations officer
agreed with Anderson that the Institution need not make di
versity its central hiring concern.
"We're not on a mission to make sure there are X number
of people who think this or X number who think that," Ho
raney said. "There are some Democrats here, a few Asian peo
ple, a few black people and a few women."
Ricardo-Campbell noted that some of the National Fel
lows, who are only at the Institution for a year, were con
cerned with such topics as finance, pharmaceutical pricing,
child care, the role of women in various societies and con
sumer issues.
Since most of the research at the Institution in recent
years has concentrated on Eastern Europe and U.S.-Soviet
relations, the addition of such varied interests could give
Hoover "a slightly different complexion," she said.
While Anderson is currently studying the Russian Mafia,
Ricardo-Campbell is presently writing a book about her expe
riences during the 12 years in which she served as director of
the Gillette Company, and is also researching Social Security
and health polity issues.
But for now, the potential for an increase in the number of
women scholars at Hoover is uncertain. Though Director
Raisian said "we should be able to modestly grow in a couple
of years," he admits there are no guarantees of diversity.

"We look for the best we can get — hopefully this

will lead to diversity as regards gender and race.

But foremost, we're looking for experts."
