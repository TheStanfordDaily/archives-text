# Stanford and Hoover Bury the Hatchet

### 
Hoover Tower, looming above the rest of the Stanford campus, is bet
ter-known to many students for its panoramic view than for the in
ternationally recognized scholars who toil there. For many years,
the Hoover Institution has lived with the reputation of a conserva
tive think-tank, impenetrable to the average Stanford student.
But according to John Raisian, the Institution's director, Hoover is
taking steps to change that image.
"We very much want to be part of the University," Raisian said. "One
of my goals is to put back into the University community as much as we
get from it — which is a lot."
Raisian said that he agreed with University President Gerhard
Casper's call to make Hoover "of' rather than "at" Stanford. In fact,
Raisian early this year gave Casper office space at Hoover after the presi
dent marvelled at the view from the Tower.
Hoover and the University have not always been on such good terms.
Most recently, a heated debate about the establishment of a Ronald Rea
gan Presidential Library at Stanford created tension between Hoover,
which supported the proposal, and former University President Donald
Kennedy, who thought it would be more of a shrine than a resource, ac
cording to Raisian.
"That all ended in 1987," Raisian said. "Things have been getting bet
ter for a number of years now, especially with two new faces, that of
Casper and Raisian."
Indeed, the fortunes of Hoover and Stanford are closely linked. Work
ing on an annual budget of $16.9 million, Hoover receives between $3.5
and $4 million from the University, to be used strictly to support the
Hoover Library. In addition, appointment bylaws state that all recom
mendations for fellowships at Hoover are forwarded to "the president of
Stanford University for consideration."
Yet only 10 Hoover fellows have joint appointments with Stanford de
partments or schools, leaving little chance for interaction between fellows
and students. So, in light of Hoover's considerable ties to Stanford, why
aren't senior fellows more available?
"The history has always been that fellows are free to work on projects
that interest them," said Richard Sousa, associate director at Hoover.
Asked if research fellows at Hoover should have some teaching re
quirements at Stanford, Sousa replied, "My feeling is it's never been done
like that before. ... We've been able to attract scholars that contribute to
national public policy debate, and it's a model that seems to be working."
But Raisian said many Hoover fellows want to become more involved
with the University. He said a common complaint among Hoover fellows
is that they have not been invited to take part in the teaching mission, and
he is currently trying to change that trend.
Working with Senior Research Fellows John Cogan and David Brady,
Raisian has been thinking of ways to give students more contact with
some of the scholars at Hoover.
John Cogan, a senior fellow at Hoover who also holds a courtesy ap
pointment at the Graduate School of Business, worked with Stanford in
Government (SIG) last year to invite prominent senior fellows to speak to
25 students for a half hour, then answer questions and engage in discus
sion, with pizza and Coke served beforehand. The talks were a unique and
invaluable learning experience for students, Cogan said.
Speakers such as Sheila Burke, chief of staff for Senator Bob Dole, and
John Rhodes, former minority leader in the House of Representatives,
were invited to the monthly events.
Cogan, who is currently conducting research on the federal budget and

how it is processed through Congress, thinks that "you can always do
more" for the involvement of Hoover fellows in teaching.
"The primary job of senior fellows is research," he said. "Many of them
go beyond that and engage in teaching on a volunteer basis where they
have a chance for much more interaction."
Cogan also wants to involve Hoover in the Stanford in Washington pro
gram and use connections from Hoover fellows to meet an increasing stu
dent demand for internships in Washington.
Last year, Cogan helped six Stanford students attain internships at the
Office of Management and Budget, where he worked under the Reagan
administration. This summer, two students are working at the Securities
and Exchange Commission. This was also arranged by Cogan.
Eventually, Cogan would like to see 10 students placed every quarter,
a goal that will be made easier by cooperation from Hoover fellows who
have served in government.
Several fellows, for example, came to Hoover directly from appoint
ments in the Reagan and Bush administrations. But Cogan said that
Hoover's reputation as a conservative institution and a Republican
stronghold is not entirely valid.
"We get money from both sides," Cogan said. "Some of them happen to
be liberal ... In the last few years, I would say we have received more
money from people associated with Democrats."
"The presumption is that we are not diverse, Raisian said. But the vari
ability of opinions here is much more than we're given credit for," .
But whether that diversity is achieved through Hoover's somewhat
vague selection process is a little dubious.
The appointment process for prospective fellows is grueling and com
plicated. Raisian appoints five or more senior staff members to a search
committee, with one member serving as chair.
The committee performs a comprehensive search, sending letters to ex
perts in the field of interest, and advertising Hoover's intent to sponsor a
fellowship.
Michele Horaney, Hoover's press relations officer, described the
process of choosing new research fellows as more informal. "People are
identified over dinner, at conferences and seminars," she said.
Potential candidates are chosen by directors and fellows, all of whom
have areas of academic specialization, and therefore know who is appro
priate, Horaney said.
"If everyone likes them, and they like being here, they might be asked
to be a fellow," she said. "We don't launch an official search — its more of
a networking thing."
Hoover's appointment procedures documents take pains to "empha-

size that the Hoover Institution is
an equal opportunity employer wel
coming nominations of individuals
who are women and/or members of
minority groups."
The committee submits a written
report to Raisian, giving a recommen
dation for candidacy and ranking
other potential candidates. Raisian
then discusses the proposed appoint
ment with all senior fellows. If ap
proved by Raisian, the report finds its
way to President Casper's desk and, "if
appropriate," to the Board ofTrustees.
