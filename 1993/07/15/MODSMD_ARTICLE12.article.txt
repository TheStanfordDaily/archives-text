## New building projects may be completed on schedule 
### 
Earth Sciences, economics, engineering
and athletics will all see new buildings con
structed during the next academic year.
A new addition has delayed the econom
ics center, but the other three buildings are
proceeding on schedule.

varsity tennis courts, the 3-story, 107,000-
square-foot Arillaga Family Sports Center
is "progressing nicely on target," according
to Ben Asaro, manager of special projects.
The Arillaga Center — scheduled to be
completed by the fall of 1994 — will house
administrative offices, a full basketball
court, a heritage room (for displaying Stan
ford trophies), a dining room, a kitchen,
locker rooms, the sports information center
and space for martial arts, wrestling and
football.
Asaro said the $16.6 million project was
paid for by donations, gifts and earthquake
reserves. So far there have not been any cost
overruns. "To make the budget work,"
Asaro explained, "we had to shave off equip
ment money."
The Department of Athletics will pur
chase equipment such as laundry facilities,
lockers and classroom seating off of a prior
ity list until they run out of money.
Once the Arillaga Center opens, the Ath
letic Department will vacate two buildings:
the administration building, which will be
used as temporary offices, and Encina Gym,
which will most likely be demolished.

On the other side of Campus Drive, con
struction has been delayed on the new eco
nomics building, which is being built in the
Memorial Auditorium parking lot. Victoria
Oldberg, administrator for the Economics
Department, said that occupation was orig
inally slated for September, but rain delays
pushed that forward to October.
The actual occupation date of the 50,450-
square-foot building, however, will not be
until spring quarter because of an addition
to the third floor. Susan Calderon, project
manager, explained that the extension will
create additional faculty offices and free in
terior space for graduate students.
The $11.7 million edifice will house most
of the Economics Department and a small
conference center. Calderon could not re
veal the building's name, because a large
donor wishes to remain anonymous for
now.
Rain also caused problems for the con
struction of the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green
Earth Sciences Research Building, located
behind Terman, between Roble Gym and
Durand at the intersection of Morris Way
and Panama Street. The rain prevented the
concrete basement from drying, Ruth
Sloan, associate dean for administration in
the School of Earth Sciences, said.
The original thrust of the project was to
create high-tech facilities for the school and
keep it on the leading edge. But after Earth
Sciences lost the Geology Corner in the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake and much of the
school moved to the Roble Modulars, the
building became more important.
Sloan said that the new space will allow
"many research projects on hold to go
through now." The building will house the
entire Department of Petroleum Engineer
ing as well as faculty, students, postdoctoral
scholars and classrooms for the whole
school.
The $23 million building was funded by
private grants and donations. It will be
ready for use this fall.
On a much smaller scale, the School of

Engineering is awaiting county permits on
the Thornton Center, an 11,000-square
foot facility on Santa Theresa St. "We just
need a single sheet of paper that says 'yes,
said Vojka Ivanek, project manager.
Construction will begin in mid-July, and
the completion date is set for the fall 0f1994.
The $3 million facility will contain 2 class
rooms with broadcast television capabili
ties, 2 labs and case study classrooms. Most
of the money came from gifts.

The Thornton Center will also be used
for conferences. The case study classrooms
will house the Manufacturing Modeling and
Information Center — a joint venture be
tween the Schools of Engineering and Busi
ness which will create computer services to
aid in the manufacturing, design, and distri
bution of industrial products, said Richard
Reis, executive director of the Center for In
tegrated Systems.
