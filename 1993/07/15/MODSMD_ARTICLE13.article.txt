# 'Magic Wand' a new musical hit

### 
Imagine conducting the sounds of the
San Francisco Symphony sans Orchestra.
That's what Music Prof. Max Mathews
can do with two batons, "a white pizza
box," a synthesizer and a computer.
Mathews' invention, called the radio
baton, presents the opportunity to "listen
to the most wonderful music."
The two batons each house a radio
transmitter that sends signals to the
"white pizza box," which is actually a
complex radio receiver. Mathews' radio
batons have separate functions. One con
trols the volume, and the other the tempo
and tone.
The receiver then separately deter
mines the location of each radio baton in
three-dimensional space with the help of
computer-aided triangulation. This
process translates the conductor's whims
into sound modifications, Mathews said.
The sound must be pre-recorded,
though, and entered into the computer be
forehand. Mathews envisions a day when
people can pop in a compact disc to his ap
paratus and modify it immediately.
Presently, an involved process is neces
sary to change the music into computer
code before it can be used by the radio
baton.
Joanne Carey, a visiting composer at
Stanford, added that programs are being
written to make this music/computer
translation easier.
Carey, a frequent user and advocate of
the radio baton, calls it "a wonderful con
tribution to the performance of electronic
music."
As she sings a song she specifically
wrote for demonstrating the powers of
Mathews* invention, she can modify the
music to her wishes with the radio batons.
A digital synthesizer provides the orches
tra, and an IBM portable computer assists
with the computations, so Carey can "dy

namically perform her own scores."
Current sing-along machines are in
flexible to each singer's uniqueness, she
said. A karaoke machine, for example,
plays the selected music regardless of the
singers and their individual characteris
tics.
Carey also cited the portability as a
bonus. She will perform two original
songs with the radio baton in Warsaw,
Poland later this year.
The radio baton was developed at Stan
ford's Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics (CCRMA or
"karma").
To market his radio baton, Mathews
has hired Tom Oberheim, president of
Marion Systems. Oberheim, a long-time
resident of the analog and digital synthe
sizer business, is working to make the
radio baton more accessible.
He has "designed an embedded micro
processor-based system" into the radio
baton along with "support circuitry" that
would create an easier interface with com
puters.
Oberheim the primary market to be
other computer musicians around the
world and then a secondary market to be
determined later as the radio baton in
creases in popularity. The production
date and price are yet to be determined.
Mathews is currently at Dartmouth
College working with faculty composer
Jon Appleton and singer/actress Hosefina
Bosch to fine tune the radio baton.
They are also converting the program
to be compatible with Apple Macintosh
computer systems.
