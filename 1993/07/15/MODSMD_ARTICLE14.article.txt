# Contest for logo almost finished
## 
### 
If you want your favorite animal, plant,
color or metaphysical entity plastered on
every T-shirt in the Peninsula, today's
your last chance.

Today is the deadline for artwork sub
missions for Stanford's contest seeking
designs to supplement Stanford's current
logos. A seven-person selecting committee
will spend the next two weeks cataloging
the entries and choosing the winner or
winners, said Jon Sandelin, a licensing as
sociate in the Office of Technology Licens
ing.
The contest is being held by the licens
ing office in search of a more dynamic logo
to boost retail sales of Stanford parapher
nalia, which have remained fairly con
stant over the past few years.
The goal is not to replace the Stanford
tree, but rather to look for new design ele
ments which will complement the existing
logo, Sandelin said. He also said there was
a "wide variety of entries and some very
interesting ideas."
So far, according to Maria Gladfelter,
the licensing office's manager of emblem
atic ware, alumni have been the most re
ceptive to the contest. Even those who did
not submit any artwork made telephone
calls to show their support for the search
of new design elements.
Sixty entries have been received as of
Tuesday, but Gladfelter said few are from
students, which she said isn't necessarily
because of a lack of student interest. She
felt it was not the best time of the year to
introduce the contest, since students were
finishing up the quarter, taking exams
and getting ready to leave for the summer.
There has also been a lack of significant
feedback from the faculty, she said.
The selecting committee is made up of
seven people from several areas of the
University including the Athletics Dept.,
the Public Affairs Dept., the Art Dept., the
ASSU and the Alumni Association. They
will choose one or more winners, each to
be awarded $500.
In addition to the winning artwork, the
"trotter-horse" logo will also be placed on
the camera-ready sheets to be sent to the
companies licensed to produce Stanford
collegiate apparel. The horse icon was
widely used during the Stanford Centen
nial Celebration in 1991 and is already an
established design, Gladfelter said.

Previously approved trademarks in
clude the University seal, the S Block, the
S Block with the tree, the word "Stan
ford" and the word "Cardinal."
