# Coffee House needs cool $1 mil
## 
### 
You may actually be able to find a seat at
the CofTee House late on a Friday night if ren
ovation plans go through. And if you've got
$850,000 to spare, you can make sure it hap
pens.
Tresidder currently has only $250,000 of
the estimated $1.1 million needed to carry out
the renovation, which would incorporate
space currently used as a game room, nearly
doubling the Coffee House's seating capacity
from 120 to 220.
As part of the proposed renovation, a new
air-conditioning system and new music sys
tem will be installed. The renovation will also
increase the CofTee House's kitchen area and
give it the capacity to prepare and serve addi
tional hot foods such as burgers and fries.
While the renovation will definitely alter a
number of the CofTee House's physical char
acteristics, a design committee — composed
of several Stanford students, staff members
from Bon Appetit (Tresidder's catering com
pany) and University staff — recommended
that the basic atmosphere of the Coffee House
be maintained.
This position seems popular with present
students, as evidenced by a survey conducted
by the Coffee House this spring.
One main reason for the proposed renova
tion, according to Tresidder Assoc. Director
Paul Szczesiul, is that the space the CofTee
House now occupies was originally designed
for recreation and not food service. This fact,
combined with the CofTee House's growing
popularity, has put a lot of stress on its already
inadequate infrastructure, leading to a num
ber of potential health code violations.
