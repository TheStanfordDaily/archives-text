# Coffee House needs cool $1 mil
## 
### 
You may actually be able to find a seat at
the CofTee House late on a Friday night if ren
ovation plans go through. And if you've got
$850,000 to spare, you can make sure it hap
pens.
Tresidder currently has only $250,000 of
the estimated $1.1 million needed to carry out
the renovation, which would incorporate
space currently used as a game room, nearly
doubling the Coffee House's seating capacity
from 120 to 220.
As part of the proposed renovation, a new
air-conditioning system and new music sys
tem will be installed. The renovation will also
increase the CofTee House's kitchen area and
give it the capacity to prepare and serve addi
tional hot foods such as burgers and fries.
While the renovation will definitely alter a
number of the CofTee House's physical char
acteristics, a design committee — composed
of several Stanford students, staff members
from Bon Appetit (Tresidder's catering com
pany) and University staff — recommended
that the basic atmosphere of the Coffee House
be maintained.
This position seems popular with present
students, as evidenced by a survey conducted
by the Coffee House this spring.
One main reason for the proposed renova
tion, according to Tresidder Assoc. Director
Paul Szczesiul, is that the space the CofTee
House now occupies was originally designed
for recreation and not food service. This fact,
combined with the CofTee House's growing
popularity, has put a lot of stress on its already
inadequate infrastructure, leading to a num
ber of potential health code violations.
"What we're really ttying to do is improve
the infrastructure, so it (the CofTee House)
can continue to stay open and increase the
available seating because of its increased pop
ularity," said Szczesiul.
Taking over the game room may disap
point some people, Szczesiul said, but revenue
from the game room has decreased each year
for the last 10 years. However, he also said
that Tresidder would like to keep some form
of the game room available, but at this time no
new space has been specifically designated.
"The project has been on the drawing
board for 10 years, and with the drop in game
room revenues, stagnant food service sales
and increased use of the Coffee House, we felt
now was the right time to move ahead with
the project," Szczesiul said.
But it may still be some time before notice
able changes appear. Currently, the renova
tion process itself has not yet been fully ap
proved or funded, he said.
Szczesiul said that Tresidder now has ap
proximately $250,000 in available funding.
"We are seeking clearance to go ahead with
fund raising," he said, explaining how the rest
of the renovation will probably be financed.
"If we don't get clearance, though, the project
will be put on hold — again," he added.
Szczesiul said he will meet with Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds in
August, but Provost Condoleeza Rice will
probably make the final decision by Septem
ber.
If the project receives fund-raising clear
ance, it must still be presented to the Board of
Trustees for final approval. If approved, fund
raising activities — such as soliciting mjyor
donors and selling paraphernalia — would
begin this fall.
Szczesiul said that if everything goes ac
cording to plan, the money would be raised by
next spring, construction finished by late next
summer, and "we'd open a new Coffee House
a year from this fall."
