# Fermat's Last hits Bay Area

### 
Last month's solution to a long-standing
riddle of mathematics — "Fermat's Last The
orem" — by Princeton Mathematics Prof. An
drew Wiles may have significant aftershocks
at schools like Stanford.
Assoc. Mathematics Prof Daniel Bump
said the real progress offered by the solution
was not in the fact that a perpetual puzzle had
been solved, but in the method of the proof,
which illuminated the way to partially solve
another mathematical conundrum, the
"Taniyama Coryecture."
Bump said the 37-year-old Taniyama Con
jecture is a very complicated problem for the
non-mathematician, but that it holds great
promise for his field, even more than Fermat's
I^ast.
Approximately 350 years ago, mathemati
cian Pierre de Fermat wrote a message in the
margin of a book saying he had proven that the
equation x n +y n =z" was false when n is greater
than two. However, Fermat claimed he didn't
have enough space to write the proof, and be
fore providing it elsewhere, he died.
Since then, many mathematicians have
worked to solve the puzzling conjecture. In
1988, while working at the Max Planck Insti
tute for Mathematics in Bonn, West Germany,
Yoichi Miyaoka presented a solution to the
350-year-old problem, which later turned out
to be wrong.
But on June 23, Wiles announced at the last
of three lectures given to a conference of math
ematicians in England that he'd proved the
theorem, and his colleagues say he's probably
right.
"Wiles' solution is an entirely different ap
proach," said Bump. Wiles used, and partially
solved, the Taniyama Coryecture. Bump said,
"Solving it is a real step which has to be taken
for mathematics to move forward."
UC-Berkeley Professor Kenneth Ribet,
who was present in England at the announce
ment, agreed that the mathematical signifi
cance of Wiles' proof does not lay in the verifi
cation of Fermat's theorem.
"The actual consequences of the proof are
very limited," he said. "However, the tools
used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem will
have many other results."
Wiles used a mathematical method of proof
by contradiction to confirm Fermat's coryec
ture. Wiles' proof, which uses some of Ribet's
theorems, establishes that the elliptical curve
which results if Fermat's last theorem is
wrong, is modular "An elliptical curve is a so

lution to some equation. Modular means it
arises in a certain concrete 1 number theoretic]
way," said Bump.
Wiles has proven that the elliptical curve is
not modular, so the contradiction shows that
the curve could not exist. The conclusion can
then be drawn that Fermat's last theorem is
correct.
"Mathematicians are optimistic that it's
going to be right, and even if there are mis
takes, they'll be fixed," said Bump. Ribet
agreed, adding that the broad outline of the
proof looks very good, but it must be mulled
over by mathematicians:
"It's not a yes or no thing," he said. "You
start reading (the proof) then put it down and
think about it for a while, then pick it up and
start reading again."
For those intrigued, but slightly confused
by all the jargon, mathemeticians have
planned a "Fermat Fest."
The event will take place on Wednesday,
July 28, at 8 p.m. Sponsored by the Mathe
matical Sciences Research Institute in Berke
ley and the Exploratorium, the event is de
signed to explain Wiles' proof to those with a
high-school level understanding of mathemat
ics. The event, featuring Ribet and others, will
be held at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre,
3601 Lyon at Bay St. next door to the Ex
ploratorium. Tickets can be reserved in ad
vance by calling (415) 392-4400. The cost is $5
and includes free admission to the Explorato
rium.
