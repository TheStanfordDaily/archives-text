# Baby birds stop big man's ax

Where environmentalists, agricultural
ists and sentimentalists have failed, a fam
ily of redheaded woodpeckers has succeed
ed. At least for this month.
The 300-year-old oak tree adjacent to
the Stanford Mausoleum, scheduled to be
cut down last Monday, was temporarily
saved from a University work crew's axes
when an alert tree visitor spotted a family
of nesting woodpeckers. The woman im
mediately notified the University, which
ordered work to be stopped.
"They're nesting right now," said Herb
Fong, Stanford's grounds manager. "If
you look up the tree, you can see their
heads stick up as they're feeding."
According to Fong, a federal law exists
protecting redheaded woodpeckers which
prohibits any disturbance of their nesting
habits.
While the University probably could
have gotten a permit from the U.S. De
partment of Fish and Game to go ahead
with plans to fell the tree, Stanford
thought it more prudent to avoid embar
rassment, controversy and some dead
birds by simply waiting until the birds va
cate the nest. Fong says that will be three

or four weeks.
It's unusual for woodpeckers to be nest
ing this late in the year, Fong said, which
helped contribute to the number of unex
pected obstacles to the tree-cutting project
Prior to the woodpeckers, birds of a dif
ferent feather caused a similar problem.
Plans to cut down the tree shortly after
commencement were postponed when a
family of starlings was found nesting in
the tree. But the problems should end with
the woodpeckers.
"We'll be monitoring the tree," Fong
said. "Right after they vacate, we'll swoop
down in there before any more birds take
up residence."
However, since the limbs of the 70-foot
oak seem to be such a popular place for
our fine-feathered friends, Fong said that
the grounds crew plans to keep selected
pieces of the tree. Suitable pieces of
trunk, with ample knots and furrows, will
be attached to still living trees, giving
birds plenty of space to nest and provid
ing the oak — that was Leland Stanford
Jr.'s favorite tree — with plenty of new
life.
