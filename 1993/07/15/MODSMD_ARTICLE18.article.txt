# Fiber could link campus, Koppel

A new fiber optic broadcasting system,
aiming to increase the visibility of Stanford
scholars, should be ready for use by next
month, according to officials at the Universi
ty's News Service.
Currently, Stanford experts often drive to
network affiliate stations in San Francisco
when asked to appear on national television
and radio news broadcasts.
But the new system will allow them to be
interviewed on campus for a program airing
the same day.
"(The networks) need information, they
need sources, and they need them when they
need them," said Jack Hubbard, associate di
rector of News Service. "We had to find a way
to deal with that."
As a result, the University purchased the
new system, which is operated by VYVX, a
Tulsa-based transmission network. Hubbard
said Stanford is the first American university
to enter the world of fiber optic networking.
When all is said and done, Stanford pro
fessors and Hoover fellows could become as
familiar on shows like "The MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour" and "Nightline" as their East
Coast counterparts.
"This puts us on the same footing as
everyone else — it levels the playing field,"
Hubbard said. "Now it is just as easy for Ted
Koppel to get to us as it is for him to get to
someone at Yale, Harvard, MIT or Caltech."
Stanford, Hubbard says, suffers from the
fact that it is not located near major television
or radio stations, forcing scholars invited to
appear on network programs to make "three
hour holes" in their schedules to accomodate
requests. "If you' re at Harvard .youjustdrive
across the Charles River into Boston (to ap
pear on a national program)," Hubbard
pointed out.
In addition, experts here were burdened
by the fact that major TV news programs
begin three hours earlier in the East, a prob
lem compounded by Stanford's rudimentary
technology.
But, Hubbard said, fiber optic technology
may turn the time difference into an advan
tage for would-be pundits: it will be easier to
turn to Stanford scholars for comment on
late-breaking news.
Hubbard said Stanford's present system
of satellite transmission — which is still used
by most universities — is often problematic
because airwaves become crowded and some
times shut down altogether. Rain and severe
weather can also make reception hazy.
Fiber optics, Hubbard said, make it "im
possible for that to happen."
Stanford commentators will still be broad
cast from the existing TV station in the Du
rand Engineering Building. Eventually,
News Service hopes to expand fiber optic ca
pabilities throughout the campus, allowing
experts to be interviewed anywhere from
Maples Pavillion to the Main Quad.
The cost of the new system, $ 120,000, will
come from Stanford's general fund. Hubbard
said that fiber optic technology will save the
University money in the long run.
"This place has lots of brilliant people,"
Hubbard said in explaining the impetus for
the switch. "This gives us a real boost."
