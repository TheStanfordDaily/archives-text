## Cardinal Rules at World University Games Rafanelli, Willens lead U.S. athletes against international competition 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
What is a WUG? It sounds like
a mutant offspring from an Ewok
and a Care Bear, but it's not.
It's not even a nebulous but
cute mascot for one of those übiq
uitous non-Olympic, multi-event
international sports festivals. In
stead, it is the unofficial acronym
of the World University Games.
And you wonder why some
sports fans have never heard of it.

Billed as second only to the
Olympics in size, the World Uni
versity Games seems still to be in
search of an identity.
The even-yeared event, open to
college athletes and recent gradu
ates, began competition two
weeks ago in Buffalo, N.Y., and
soon became synonymous with
one word: escape.
Last weekend, two Cuban
baseball players defected while
their team was preparing for the
games. One of the players, Edil-

berto Orope
sa, cited his
dream of
making it to
the Major
Leagues as
his incentive
to seek asy
lum in the
United
States.
Mean
while, Ameri

Stanford ath
letes —

gold.
The Cardi
nal player
making the
biggest impact
at the Games,
at least on the
scoreboard, is
soccer for-

ward Sarah Rafanelli. The senior
is the U.S. team's second-leading
scorer.
Rafanelli has tallied four goals
in three U.S. blowouts. The unde
feated Americans shut out Aus
tralia with the 5-foot-3 forward
knocking in the fourth of six goals
at the 57 minute mark.
On Saturday, Rafanelli erupt
ed for a hat trick against Japan,
tallying all three of her goals with
in eight minutes. The United
States, won easily, 7-0. Rafanelli
didn't score in Monday's game
against Chinese Taipei but team
mates Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly
and Tisha Venturini did, offset
ting the one goal managed by Chi
nese Taipei.
The three U.S. scorers in that
game and Rafanelli have faced
each other from opposite sides of
the field, too. Hamm, Lilly and
Venturini all play for national
team coach Anson Dorrance at
North Carolina.
Besides Rafanelli, several Car
dinal athletes have made a mark at
the World University Games. 1993
graduate Heather Willens notched
a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Canada's

Jan Barrett. The ex-Stanford All-
American also scored a 6-2,6-0 win
over Patricia Markova and a 3-6,6-
3, 6-3 victory over Spain's Marta
Alastrue. In doubles, Willens and
Pam Nelson crushed New

Zealand's Tracey King and Jaqui
Gunthorpe 6-2,6-0.
Stanford sophomore Kim
Shasby defeated Britain's Ann
Margaret Driver in the first round
by the score of 6-4,6-2.
Another soon-to-be sophomore,
AJ. Hinch, got a shot at WUG star
dom. The collegiate wunderkind
has not found success quite as
quickly at the World University
Games. In a platoon role, Hinch
has had one hit in five at-bats. His
only hit came in Sunday's 3-0 win
against Chinese Taipei.

Overall, the U.S. baseball team
has a record of 3-1 which includes
blowouts of Italy and Korea, fol
lowed by a 4-3 loss to Japan. The
Americans still have to face Cana
da and the favored Cuban squad
in round-robin play.
In water polo, Wolf Wigo and
Chris Wallin have helped the U.S.
men's squad to two early-round
victories. Wallin and Wigo both
found the net in the U.S.'s 10-6
win over Japan. Wallin also scored
in the Americans' 5-4 victory over
Slovakia. The duo of Wigo and
Wallin led the Cardinal in scoring
last season with 42 and 34 goals,
respectively.
In fencing, 1993 Stanford grad
Nick Bravin finished 63rd in the
foil event.
In other competition, both the
U.S. men's and women's basket
ball teams are undefeated and ap
pear headed for the medal rounds.
The U.S. men's and women's
volleyball squads are headed for
radically dissimilar fates as the
men lost heartbreaking five-set
ters to Korea and Italy while the
women cruised past Switzerland
and France without dropping a
game.

Cardinal, is second in scoring on the United States World University
Games teams. Her total of four goals in three games Is two shy of
North Carolina's Mia Hamm, who has six goals.

All-American Heather Widens smashed her first three opponents at the World Universi
ty Games. The hard-pounding recent graduate has continued the success she found on
the courts at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
What is a WUG? It sounds like
a mutant offspring from an Ewok
and a Care Bear, but it's not.
It's not even a nebulous but
cute mascot for one of those übiq
uitous non-Olympic, multi-event
international sports festivals. In
stead, it is the unofficial acronym
of the World University Games.
And you wonder why some
sports fans have never heard of it.

Billed as second only to the
Olympics in size, the World Uni
versity Games seems still to be in
search of an identity.
The even-yeared event, open to
college athletes and recent gradu
ates, began competition two
weeks ago in Buffalo, N.Y., and
soon became synonymous with
one word: escape.
Last weekend, two Cuban
baseball players defected while
their team was preparing for the
games. One of the players, Edil-

berto Orope
sa, cited his
dream of
making it to
the Major
Leagues as
his incentive
to seek asy
lum in the
United
States.
Mean
while, Ameri
can competi
tors — includ
ing several
Stanford ath
letes —
searched for
gold.
The Cardi
nal player
making the
biggest impact
at the Games,
at least on the
scoreboard, is
soccer for-

ward Sarah Rafanelli. The senior
is the U.S. team's second-leading
scorer.
Rafanelli has tallied four goals
in three U.S. blowouts. The unde
feated Americans shut out Aus
tralia with the 5-foot-3 forward
knocking in the fourth of six goals
at the 57 minute mark.
On Saturday, Rafanelli erupt
ed for a hat trick against Japan,
tallying all three of her goals with
in eight minutes. The United
States, won easily, 7-0. Rafanelli
didn't score in Monday's game
against Chinese Taipei but team
mates Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly
and Tisha Venturini did, offset
ting the one goal managed by Chi
nese Taipei.
The three U.S. scorers in that
game and Rafanelli have faced
each other from opposite sides of
the field, too. Hamm, Lilly and
Venturini all play for national
team coach Anson Dorrance at
North Carolina.
Besides Rafanelli, several Car
dinal athletes have made a mark at
the World University Games. 1993
graduate Heather Willens notched
a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Canada's

Jan Barrett. The ex-Stanford All-
American also scored a 6-2,6-0 win
over Patricia Markova and a 3-6,6-
3, 6-3 victory over Spain's Marta
Alastrue. In doubles, Willens and
Pam Nelson crushed New

Rafanelli erupted for
a hat trick against
Japan, tallying all
three of her goals
within eight minutes.

Zealand's Tracey King and Jaqui
Gunthorpe 6-2,6-0.
Stanford sophomore Kim
Shasby defeated Britain's Ann
Margaret Driver in the first round
by the score of 6-4,6-2.
Another soon-to-be sophomore,
AJ. Hinch, got a shot at WUG star
dom. The collegiate wunderkind
has not found success quite as
quickly at the World University
Games. In a platoon role, Hinch
has had one hit in five at-bats. His
only hit came in Sunday's 3-0 win
against Chinese Taipei.

Overall, the U.S. baseball team
has a record of 3-1 which includes
blowouts of Italy and Korea, fol
lowed by a 4-3 loss to Japan. The
Americans still have to face Cana
da and the favored Cuban squad
in round-robin play.
In water polo, Wolf Wigo and
Chris Wallin have helped the U.S.
men's squad to two early-round
victories. Wallin and Wigo both
found the net in the U.S.'s 10-6
win over Japan. Wallin also scored
in the Americans' 5-4 victory over
Slovakia. The duo of Wigo and
Wallin led the Cardinal in scoring
last season with 42 and 34 goals,
respectively.
In fencing, 1993 Stanford grad
Nick Bravin finished 63rd in the
foil event.
In other competition, both the
U.S. men's and women's basket
ball teams are undefeated and ap
pear headed for the medal rounds.
The U.S. men's and women's
volleyball squads are headed for
radically dissimilar fates as the
men lost heartbreaking five-set
ters to Korea and Italy while the
women cruised past Switzerland
and France without dropping a
game.
