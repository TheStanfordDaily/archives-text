# Athletic Dept. continues search for new soccer, softball coaches
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Since beginning its search last quarter, the Stan
ford Athletic Department has received more than 100
applications to replace two of its recently resigned
coaches: former women's soccer coach Berhane Ande
berhan and ex-women's so ft ball coach Hank Wallis.
Monday was the deadline for applications for the
soccer coach's position, and the department will
start screening candidates to whittle down the pool
before beginning interviews, said Senior Associate
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick. The Department re
ceived well over 50 applications for what Levick
termed a "premier coaching position."
"The (applicant) pool is excellent," she added. "It
far exceeds the minimum requirements that we're
looking for."
Several applications came from overseas, and Ande
berhan's successor will likely come from a pool of coach
es with significant college or club-level experience, al
though Levick declined to name specific candidates.
In terms of on-the-field results, the new women's
soccer coach will have large cleats to fill. In six years,
Andeberhan helped turn the program around from a
mediocre squad to a perennial national power.
Under Andeberhan, the Cardinal racked up a 77-
26-11 record in six years, including NCAA quarterfi

nal appearances each of the last two seasons. In the
past three years, Stanford notched a 43-9-4 record.
"We're looking for a coach to continue the direc
tion the team is going and take it further," Levick
said.
Andeberhan was asked to resign last month after
players claimed he verbally and psychologically
abused the team. Those complaints led to several
meetings between Andeberhan, team members,
Athletic Director Ted Leland and Levick last spring.
Levick did not indicate whether the charges of
abuse leveled against Andeberhan would lead to a
closer scrutiny of his possible replacements.
"We will hire the best coach available," she said.
After resigning, Andeberhan took a position with
in the department as Stanford's liaison to World Cup
'94, the U.S. World Cup organizational body. Stan
ford will host six World Cup games next year.
While the new softball coach will not likely have
as high expectations to live up to as the soccer coach,
Wallis' successor will have enough challenges. The
Stanford softball squad finished its first season as a
varsity sport with a 1-41 mark, its sole victory an
early-season win over Cal State-Hayward.
The department also received 50 applications for
the softball position and is currently in the middle of
conducting interviews, Levick said. "We hope to
name a coach at the end of the month," she added.
