dance that made a sex sym

V/ and well at Stanford, as the
third annual Stanford Tango Week
saunters its way toward a close.
Some 140 participants and six
teams of instructors from all over
the world gathered at Stanford this
week to study and celebrate the
tango, including influential Argen
tine dancer and choreographer Juan
Carlos Copes.
The group has been on campus
since Sunday, tracing the roots of
the tango through classes, seminars
and social events such as "Club Mu
farse."
Mufarse is an Argentine slang
term for the brooding melancholy
that accompanies some tangos. But
not all tangos are introspective;
some are amazingly expressive and
energetic.
According to Stanford dance his
torian Richard Powers, who orga
nized Tango Week, the tango is "a
personal dance of the heart," in
which individual style is more im
portant than technical ability.
"It's not a matter of steps," he
said. "Some people teach tango as
steps, but that's not it and never
was."
Tango is here to stay
An 1910, the tango emerged from
\l the slums of Buenos Aires to
1/ conquer the dance halls of Paris.
From there, the new craze spread
throughout the world, finally mak
ing its way back to Argentina where
it was embraced by all classes of so
ciety.
Since then, the tango enjoyed pe
riods of both worldwide popularity
and total obscurity.
"This year, it's very popular,"
Powers said. "In 1975, it was almost
dead. That's why we guess it will
never die.
Powers attributes the tango's
lasting allure to its mystery.
"Until the time machine is in
vented, we won't even know what it

looked like before 1910," he said.
"We have many, many stories, but
we don't know which ones to believe
and never will."
The current tango revival began
10 years ago with the Broadway
revue "Tango Argentino" — and it's
still growing. The tango, once the
scandalous property of the lowest
elements of Argentine society, pops
up with increasing frequency in
dance classes, hit films — even at
major universities like Stanford.
Dancing for all
Week originated three
I . years ago as part of a series of
\y traditional dance weeks at Stan
ford. Although it was intended as a
one-time event, the event was so
popular that organizers brought it
back for a wildly successful second
year.
This year's Tango Week has been
sold out since December. But begin
ners and latecomers can still partici
pate in three main events.
Thirty dancers and musicians
will perform in the Argentine Tango
Grand Concert, tonight at 8 p.m. in
Roble Dance Studio. The program
will be followed by dancing for all.
Tickets, $12, will be available to the
public at the door.
Cop£s will lead an introductory
tango workshop Saturday afternoon
in Roble. The $50-per-person event
is "a once in a lifetime experience"
to study with "a living legend," Pow
ers said.
Following the workshop, Bay
Area tango aficionados will mix and
mingle at Tango By the Bay, a black
tie ball at the San Francisco Press
Club. Although the event is not part
of the Stanford program, it was or
ganized by participants in last year's
Tango Week.
