## More dead ringers Equinox 
### 
"Equinox" is a movie for aesthetes and
conspiracy theorists alike — a vaguely fu
turistic, film noir variation on the good
twin/bad twin theme.
Matthew Modine stars as the twins —
one a mild-mannered mechanic, the other
a hard-boiled gangster who smokes in bed
and dismisses a messy hit as "a public ser
vice." Henry Petosa and Freddie Ace (you
guess which is which) don't meet until the
final scene, but their lives are linked in
such symbol-heavy realms as a sealed let
ter, a vernal equinox, the Grand Canyon
and goulash.
When a morgue attendant (and would
be writer) finds the enigmatic letter on an
unidentified corpse, it's just the beginning
of a bizarre series of missed connections
and near-coincidences that follows the
twins into a downward spiral from which
only one will emerge alive.
Director Alan Rudolph sets this mys
tery-cum-metaphysics in a "Blade Run
ner"-esque milieu of shadows, whispers
and screams. It's a society so bleak that we
expect some diabolical force to be driving
it, but there doesn't seem to be anyone in
charge.
Instead, Rudolph orchestrates an art di
rector's dream of total chaos — a world
ruled solely by television and Lotto, where
rudeness reigns and people die or get beat
up on the street without drawing so much
as a glance.
As Freddy Ace puts it, "Life's a game.
Plenty of players, no rules."
Amidst the stylized squalor and 24-
hour gridlock, Rudolph surprises us with
his dry humor and painful honesty. His
camera is the film's only sympathetic ob
server, alternately hovering protectively
and trembling in fear.
As Freddie, Modine has that I-been-on
my-own-since-I-was-12-years-old brava
do right down to the restless fingertips.
Freddie is too blatantly villainous to be
anything more than a caricature, but he's a
good one, vital and menacing. Modine's
Henry is slightly more complex: an inno
cent torn by not-so-innocent instincts.
"My whole life seems to be taking place
without me in it,"he says without irony.
Lara Flynn Boyle, Lori Singer and
Marisa Tomei appear as the women in Mo
dine's lives, each more bizarrely authentic
than the next. The colorful supporting cast
includes Tyra Ferrell, Kevin J. O'Connor,
M. Emmet Walsh and Fred Ward, as an es
pecially sinister crime boss.
"Equinox" covers familiar ground, but
does it so artfully that it seems new and im
mediate. You'll leave the theater feeling a
little more paranoid than when you en
tered, a little more attuned to the evils
lurking in the very near future.
