# Dead on arrival
## Son-in-Law 
### 
"Son-in-Law" doesn't promise break
through performances or breathtaking
cinematography, but since it's supposed to
be a comedy, we should at least expect
clever dialogue, slapstick humor — any

thing that would justify seven dollars and
two hours. But "Son-in-Law" fails to deliv
er at any level.
Where to begin to explain this excruci
ating ordeal?

The plot and dialogue de
generate into sheer im
probability as Crawl tries
to solve the family's prob
lems. Consider this mean
ingful exchange: 'Bee,
what happened?' 'Every
thing.'

Rebecca (Carla Gugino) leaves her small
South Dakota hometown for college in Los
Angeles She's about to succumb to her
homesickness and head back to the farm
when in steps her resident assistant/beau
tician, Crawl (Pauly Shore). Under Crawl's
tutelage, Rebecca is transformed from
Gidget to a Julie Brown clone.
The story centers around the reaction of
friends and family when the newly trans
formed Rebecca brings Crawl home for
Thanksgiving. As you can probably guess,
the humor consists of the hackneyed
theme of rural hicks shocked at the new
Rebecca and gaping at Crawl, who must
adjust to the farm.
But it gets worse. The film hits its low
point when it actually attempts to tackle
legitimate domestic tensions in Rebeccas
household. The plot and dialogue degen
erate into sheer improbability as Crawl
tries to solve the family's problems. Con
sider this meaningful exchange: "Bee, what
happened?" "Everything."
Shore's performance can't honestly be
termed acting — he merely rehashes the
same tired personality from his MTV
show, losing his comedic impact after the
first few minutes. All he has to offer is a bad
haircut, mismatched retro-clothing and
contrived beach lingo. After a few minutes
of this painful spectacle, we wish we could
take a straight razor and edit him out of the
film.
Gugino might actually be a decent ac
tress, but you would never know it from
this film — she spends all her time giggling
incessantly as Shore's sidekick, peeking out
from under an ill-fitting blonde wig. Lane
Smith and Cindy Picket, who play Rebec

ca's conservative parents deserve our sym
pathies for struggling through the puerile
dialogue.
The jealous ex-boyfriend (Dan Gauthi
er) is a thoroughly despicable villain who
shows no moral compunction in his quest
to destroy Crawl. We sympathize with his
every scheme, even if that isn't the film
makers' intent.
That this film was made is in itself quite
disturbing; that it's actually making
money is horrifying. As for Pauly Shore,
the media moguls want to depict this tool
as a zany yet lovable character. Do we real
ly have to put up with this? Let's salvage
our self-respect and boycott Pauly.
