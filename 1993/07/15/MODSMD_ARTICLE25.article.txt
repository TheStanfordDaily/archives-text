# Good, bad and ugly
## Film shorts 
### 
Cliffhanger
The Italian Stallion takes a half-step toward re
covery with this "Die Hard-on-a-moutaintop"
flick. Renny Harlin — who directed Die Hard II
— provides Stallone with a dizzying set of ac
tion sequences that will leave you quaking in
your multiplex. Unfortunately, Sly's heavy
hand fell on the screenplay, bestowing upon
us the lamest wisecracks this side of "Howard
The Duck." Your call. R
The Firm
Here's a sure recipe for boredom. Start with a
badly written, overlong page-turner. Add a di
rector (Sydney Pollack) whose last film was
the memorable "Havana." Stir in a star actor
(Tom Cruise) who couldn't act to save his life.
Let this flavorless dish simmer for two-and-a
half hours, then garnish with an implausible
ending. Warning: Drowsiness, fidgeting and
an urge to get up and leave may result. Sug
gested serving: zero. R
■ In The Line of Fire
No, it's not a classic. But it is the best mass-en
tertainment film to come out of Hollywood this
year — Spielberg, Schwarzenegger and Seat
tle-based insomniacs included. Clint East
wood stars as a Secret Service agent haunted
by his failure to save JFK in '63 Thirty years
later, can he stop an unknown psychotic (John
Malkovich) from causing lightning to strike
twice? Take a hint from Clint's tagline —
"That's not gonna happen" — and put your
money on the real last action hero. R
■ Like Water For Chocolate
In Mexico, hot chocolate is prepared by
adding cocoa to boiling water. So when a per
son is sexually aroused, they are termed "like
water for chocolate." The youngest daughter
of a ranching family is forced to stay at home
with her mother despite the attentions of a vir
ile suitor. But her passion can't be contained,
so she releases it in the food that she painstak
ingly prepares. A delectable banquet of love,

magic and food served up by Mexican director
Alfonso Arau. Not Rated
Made in America
If you thought the wildly successful "Sister
Act" was bad, wait 'til you get a load of
Whoopi's latest stinker. She plays a woman
whose teen-age daughter finds out that she's
the product of artificial insemination. Worse,
her donor/father (Ted Danson) is white — not
a "creamy eggshell kind of white," he's "white
white white." The premise is interesting, and
the two leads make an appealing couple. But
the writer and director dribble the story into
nothingness — the kind of film that gives
American products a bad name PG-13
■ Menace II Society
John Singleton's boyz couldn't hang in the
Hughes brothers' 'hood — they wouldn't last II
minutes. Caine Lawson, having just graduated
from high school, tries to survive a long, hot
summer on Los Angeles' mean streets. But
when a simple liquor store run turns into a
homicide, it kicks off a series of events that can
only end in death or a disappearing act. An im
pressive debut. R
■ Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you Kenneth Branagh
whips out a Bardful of tricks to bring this
Shakespearean comedy to the screen. Two
sets of couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and fall in love
in a picturesque 18th century Italian villa.
Though the American actors (Keanu Reeves
and, surprisingly, Denzel Washington) can't
really hang, the largely British cast pulls off a
bawdily magical comedy. PG-13
Orlando
Even Mickey Mouse, the Mighty Ducks and
Shaquille O'Neal couldn't save this mess.
Tilda Swinton stars in this adaptation of Vir
ginia Woolf's sly precursor to "The Crying
Game," as an immortal nobleman who be
comes a noblewoman halfway through the
film. Swinton is engaging and the cinematog
raphy is beautiful. But unlike Branagh and
Greenaway, British director Sally Potter bores
us from start to finish. Read the book R
Sleepless in Seattle
After her debut film failed to set the box office
on fire, Nora Ephron (writer of "When Harry
Met Sally") has gone commercial. With a
vengeance. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan star as
thefated-to-meet-and-kiss-atop-tall-buildings
lovers. From the treacly love songs to the
sappy homage to "An Affair To Remember,"
the sugar shock quotient of this film will keep
you sleepless no matter where you live. R
■ What's Love Got To Do With It
If nothing else, this movie teaches us that Tina
Turner knew how to roll with the many punch
es that fate — and husband Ike — kept throw
ing at her. From a church choir in Nutbush,
Tenn. to opening for the Rolling Stones, An
gela Bassett does her best to capture Tina's
electrifying stage presence. Still, Laurence
Fishburne steals the show as her talented ter
ror of a husband. Check it out. R

ingly prepares. A delectable banquet of love,

magic and food served up by Mexican director
Alfonso Arau. Not Rated
Made in America
If you thought the wildly successful "Sister
Act" was bad, wait 'til you get a load of
Whoopi's latest stinker. She plays a woman
whose teen-age daughter finds out that she's
the product of artificial insemination. Worse,
her donor/father (Ted Danson) is white — not
a "creamy eggshell kind of white," he's "white
white white." The premise is interesting, and
the two leads make an appealing couple. But
the writer and director dribble the story into
nothingness — the kind of film that gives
American products a bad name PG-13
■ Menace II Society
John Singleton's boyz couldn't hang in the
Hughes brothers' 'hood — they wouldn't last II
minutes. Caine Lawson, having just graduated
from high school, tries to survive a long, hot
summer on Los Angeles' mean streets. But
when a simple liquor store run turns into a
homicide, it kicks off a series of events that can
only end in death or a disappearing act. An im
pressive debut. R
■ Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you Kenneth Branagh
whips out a Bardful of tricks to bring this
Shakespearean comedy to the screen. Two
sets of couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and fall in love
in a picturesque 18th century Italian villa.
Though the American actors (Keanu Reeves
and, surprisingly, Denzel Washington) can't
really hang, the largely British cast pulls off a
bawdily magical comedy. PG-13
Orlando
Even Mickey Mouse, the Mighty Ducks and
Shaquille O'Neal couldn't save this mess.
Tilda Swinton stars in this adaptation of Vir
ginia Woolf's sly precursor to "The Crying
Game," as an immortal nobleman who be
comes a noblewoman halfway through the
film. Swinton is engaging and the cinematog
raphy is beautiful. But unlike Branagh and
Greenaway, British director Sally Potter bores
us from start to finish. Read the book R
Sleepless in Seattle
After her debut film failed to set the box office
on fire, Nora Ephron (writer of "When Harry
Met Sally") has gone commercial. With a
vengeance. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan star as
thefated-to-meet-and-kiss-atop-tall-buildings
lovers. From the treacly love songs to the
sappy homage to "An Affair To Remember,"
the sugar shock quotient of this film will keep
you sleepless no matter where you live. R
■ What's Love Got To Do With It
If nothing else, this movie teaches us that Tina
Turner knew how to roll with the many punch
es that fate — and husband Ike — kept throw
ing at her. From a church choir in Nutbush,
Tenn. to opening for the Rolling Stones, An
gela Bassett does her best to capture Tina's
electrifying stage presence. Still, Laurence
Fishburne steals the show as her talented ter
ror of a husband. Check it out. R
