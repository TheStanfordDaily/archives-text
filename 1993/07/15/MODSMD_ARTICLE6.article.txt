The University
should consider
cable on campus

Graduate students
are dressing badly
because they have no
idea what's going on with
Cindy Crawford's "House of
Style." The Stanford Shop
ping Center doesn't carry
those porcelain Elvis stat
uettes they sell on the Home
Shopping Network. And,
worst of all, as those long
summer nights eke by on
this quiet, one-horse campus,
not one lonely soul has been
able to escape into those
"Emanuelle" flicks on Show
time.
The University has put an
iron-clad, no-cable rule on
this campus. Sure, they give
us C-SPAN, CNN and all
those educational channels
with words printed on the
screen, but watching those
House votes tally up gets
pretty tiresome after several
hours — and SCBN isn't
much more exciting. "The
Study Break" is no "Larry
Sanders Show."
By denying the campus ac
cess to Cable Co-op, the Uni
versity is treating its stu
dents like children — a policy
they usually avoid like The
Golf Channel. They send us
our own bills, mail us our
own grades and keep person
al information private. But
when it comes to a possible
overdose of Aerosmith
videos, the University acts
like an overprotective parent.
If the University is un
able to give students the
full range of programming
they desire, it should recon
sider its policy of keeping
privately-owned cable com

panies off campus. Al
though "campusizing" the
phone system was a mostly
successful process, campus
control of the cable system
has left everyone unsatis
fied.
The University has not
been able to wire the entire
campus with its own system
— individual rooms on the
Row and in other campus
residences are not wired for
SUNet. This denies many
students access to even regu
lar broadcast television, like
"Barney."
Not only undergraduates
with too much time on their
hands, but graduate stu
dents with small, stupen
dous children on their hands
are being denied what has
become a fundamental
American right.
If indeed part of Stan
ford's task is to turn
teenagers into adults, its
cable policy fails. Adults
watch lots of cable, and stu
dents are quickly falling be
hind. Jokes about "Barbar
ians at the Gate" are going to
go over the heads of Stan
ford's fledgling investment
bankers and consultants.
During the summer, the
lack of cable is even harder
felt. With little to do on cam
pus, and a slew of non-stu
dents living here for the
summer, the A&E demand
peaks to levels unheard of
during the year.
As it is, students can
watch plenty of mind-numb
ing, Montel Williamsesque
television. Cable will not in
crease television viewing,
but rather enhance it. If the
University can't understand
that, they maybe they've
never seen that "Ren and
Stimpy" episode where Ren
urinates on the electric fence
and blows up the house. It's
a hoot.
