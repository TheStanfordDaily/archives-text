## Unfairest of them all 
### 
DON'T HATE ME because
I'm beautiful. Hate me be
cause I'm a columnist. Hate
me because I'm pro-choice. Hate
me because I once misquoted you
in print. Hate me for things I can
control. But don't hate me be
cause I'm beautiful. And don't
hate me because I'm ugly, either.
OK — I admit it. Looks are
everything. Always were, always
will be. And if they're not every
thing, they're a pretty good indi
cation of it.
I recently saw "Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs" for the
first time in 15 years. As I child, I
hated Snow White. Not because
she was beautiful, but because she
could sing and I couldn't.
I still can't sing, but I've man
aged to bury my resentment. Now
I just hate Disney for taking all
the meaning out of fairy tales.
Or so I thought. One of the
things my childhood sensibilities
failed to pick up the first time I saw
the movie, besides the rhymed cou
plets and homoerotic overtones,
was the way beauty and ugliness
were juxtaposed and moralized in a
vibrant splash of Technicolor.
It all makes sense to me now.
The witch is vain and vindictive;
Snow White, like some modern
day "waif," is totally unconscious
of her own beauty. The witch

transforms herself into an old
hag; Snow White remains the
fairest of them all.
In consequence, Snow White is
allowed to frolic with fat birds and
early Bambi prototypes, while the
witch must wallow with crudely
drawn rats, ravens and vultures.
Snow White lives happily ever
after. The witch — well, let's just
say she doesn't.
But the evil, ancient crone that
so terrified me once upon a time
now stikes me as being quite silly
looking.
The tykes in the audience
shrieked nonetheless. They've al
ready been conditioned to fear ug
liness — and they like it that way.
There's something reassuring
about the notion that you can tell
the bad guys from the good guys at
a glance, just like it's comforting
to think that the eyes glowing in
the forest are really just cute little
bunnies and squirrels.
When you get right down to it,
Snow White is not so much a hero
ine as a cheerleader for good be
havior: clean your room, beware
of strangers, whistle while you
work and so on. And she's a damn
good one.
Obviously, self-actualization
through housework is an outdat
ed concept. We've come a long
way, right baby? But we're still

stuck in the beautiful-equals
good, ugly-equals-bad mentality
that I, personally, blame on
"Snow White." What you see is
still what you get, and not only in
the movies.
It's easier and less time-con
suming to assign characters to
people based on their appear
ances. It's soothing to believe that
life could be so simple. It's danger
ous to delude ourselves.
I'm sure "Snow White" seemed
progressive in 1937, but times
they have changed. I'd sooner
take my impressionable 5-year
old (assuming I had an impres
sionable 5-year-old) to see "Juras
sic Park" — at least it has decent
animation.
Of course, it also has Laura
Dern as a blonde, leggy dinosaur
expert. I'm waiting for Paleobiolo
gist Barbie, with her tiny magnify
ing glass and just-add-water acid
bath kit. Young girls across Amer
ica are going to grow up thinking
they're not pretty enough to be
scientists. Hey, I read "The Beau
ty Myth."
Maybe times they haven't.

Kimberly Chrisman would like to
thank all the nice boys who want to
date her.
