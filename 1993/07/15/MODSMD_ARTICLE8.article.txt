## It's art, not an eyesore, you philistines 
### 
Your July 8 editorial, "This is
no molehill," raises three basic ob
jections to the sculpture titled
"Fragment: The Hidden Sea (Is
land of Refuge)" currently under
construction at the Rains Houses:
outdoor art is an improper use of
University Funds; construction is
taking too long; and the graduate
students themselves were not con
sulted.
As the project manager respon
sible for the installation of this
work, I believe your readers de
serve a fuller story.
The editorial suggests that
many students would feel more
enthusiastic about a swimming
pool or basketball court. This may
be true, but perhaps-even in these
pragmatic times-some still recog
nize that a world-class university
must aspire to a higher standard
than a country club or an apart
ment complex.

For over a century Stanford has
built an impressive collection of
outdoor art to support the Univer
sity's academic mission that in
cludes works by Alexander Calder,
Auguste Rodin and Henry Moore.
This growing collection provides
students with the opportunity to
experience and live with the art
rather than merely see it through
media or textbook. This is an op
portunity few universities offer to
Stanford's degree.
The value of art in society, or
this piece at Stanford, is a legiti
mate subject for reasoned dis
course, and the editors are entitled
to their opinion. The editorial's
other two points, however, are in
accurate.
I sympathize with the discom
fort residents feel during the con
struction phase. The long hiatus
during May and June was for two
reasons. First, to provide a quiet
atmosphere during Dead Week
and finals. Since Rains houses a
high percentage of Law School stu
dents, construction was suspended

during the entire four week period
covering Dead Week and finals for
both Law and other schools.
Second, the artist, John RolofT,
was then out of town for two
weeks. Since he is overseeing the
construction, it was suspended
during his absence. Construction
resumed about two weeks ago, and
the installation is expected to be
complete in August.
As for consultation with gradu
ate students, the editors may be
surprised to learn that this project
has been in design for over five
years and that the design process
included numerous meetings with
graduate students who were living
in the Rains Houses about three
years ago.
During these meetings the pro
ject was redesigned substantially
in response to student concerns
and ideas. The model of the sculp
ture, developed through this
process, is currently on display in
the Rains Conference Room in
Building 5.
The editorial leaves the impres

sion that the editors have not had
the opportunity to view the model
(none of the concrete structure
will be visible when completed). I
think this should be done before
you discount the significant efforts
of the previous students, the
artist, and the University.
After years of delay due to
earthquake, drought and other
pressing University projects, the
sculpture is nearing completion.
With its geological theme, sloping
lawns, weeping water wall and
rare rose groundcover, we hope
"Fragment: The Hidden Sea (Is
land of Refuge)" will be a worthy
addition to Stanford's tradition of
outdoor art.
It is also hoped that the com
pleted sculpture will be inviting to
the residents for rest and play.
This was the design intent and the
context of comments from the past
residents. All members of the
community are invited to visit and
judge for themselves.
