# 'I Am In The Position Of Doing Some Fine-Tuning.'
## A 						Conversation With: JIM MONTOYA 
### 
Jim Montoya recently ac
cepted the Class of '97,
marking the culmination
of his second year as Dean
of Admissions. Throughout the
summer, as during the normal
academic year, Montoya speaks
with a variety of people, ranging
from a daughter of a Stanford em
ployee looking for advice on the
application process to entire class
es on such topics as marketing, af
firmative action and ethics. Mon
toya spoke to The Stanford Week
ly writer John MacKenzie about
th? current trends and recent
events surrounding the admis
sions process.
SW: Given the rising cost of iu
ition, what changes do you fore
see in the admissions process ?
Montoya: Well, I think we must
justify to the students and par
ents why we cost as much as we
do. I think people are surprised to
learn that even the high amount
of tuition does not cover the cost
of a Stanford education. To meet
the high cost of undergraduate
and graduate education, the bud
get is supplemented by the gen
erosity of our alumni and the uni
versity investment funds.
One of the other challenges
the Admissions Office will face
will be in working with students
and parents earlier. There are
some who say that even junior
high school is too late. If a family
hasn't started saving, chances
are they are going to have diffi
culty meeting the costs, particu
larly if they find themselves in
the middle-class group — those
who are clearly going to have to
struggle financially in order to
meet the full cost of tuition.
SW: In the April 6 issue of The
Daily you said that no attempt
was made to "massage the num
bers" in terms of the diversity of
incomming class. What sort of
forces do you think are control
ling these demographics and
where do you think they will go in
the next 10years?

Montoya: Quite honestly, a lot of what we
see is taking place in the public school sys
tem. The way I approach the issue of diver
sity on this campus is to make certain we
have a diverse and talented applicant pool,
so that one does not play games in the se
lection process or manipulate a situation
where unqualified students are admitted.
I think we are going to see challenges in
how we interpret credentials, particularly
of recent immigrants. The one change —
the greatest change — that I sensed this
year was the increased number of recent
immigrants. They are truly outstanding
students, but students who may not have
the facility with the English language or
who are faced with special challenges
which detracted from their academic
prowess and overall academic record.
Moreover, I think we will continue to
see an increase in the percentage of Asian-
American, Native American, Chicano/Lati
no and African-American students in our
applicant pool.
SW: What happened with the gender gap?
There was talk about more females than
males accepting admission into the incom
ing freshman class.
Montoya: We assume we will have a class
where the figure will be 50-50.1 don't have
any explanation why the yield rate changed
(from last year), although one percentage
point represents 16 students. This small
number can slightly tip the balance. I think
we will continue to see a higher percentage
of women enrolling at colleges and univer
sities.
I think we have to be strong proponents
of educational opportunities for women,

particularly in the high schools. Even at
the best private high schools we still see a
very small representation of girls in AP
Calculus and Physics. Nationally, we see
an increase in the number of girls report
ing AP scores in math and science, but I
still feel there is work to be done in that
area.
SW: With so many new people in top spots
in the administration, how do you think
the admissions process will be affected ?
Montoya: I don't think it has changed the
process. I think we have been well served in
the admissions office because the new
president and the new provost are clearly
individuals who are identified with having
a strong commitment to undergraduate
education.
At times, there are students and par
ents who question whether Stanford is a

good place for an undergraduate. Often I
hear students say, "Well, I'll go to this
school," usually a school that is less ex
pensive, "but I'll go to Stanford for gradu
ate school where it really counts." And, of
course, I once again find myself in the role
of an educator attempting to talk about
the importance of the kind of experience
we offer our undergraduates, particularly
the intellectual experience and the overall
experience.
In general, I don't think a new Dean of
Admissions can dramatically change what
is very sound philosophy, nor would he or
she want to. I am in a position to do some
fine tuning, and I think the new president
may want to do some fine tuning, but I do
not think we will see any dramatic
changes. We are committed to recognizing
excellence. There are only so many ways in
which one can do that.

SW: What impact do you think
the restructuring of financial aid
on the national level will have on
admissions at Stanford?
Montoya: I think prospective
students and their families are
getting a lot of mixed messages
from the press on what the
changes are going to be. I am con
cerned that they will walk away
from reading the newspaper feel
ing that there are fewer opportu
nities for them to attend costly in
stitutions.
This year we faced the inter
esting challenge of how we were
going to deal with the govern
ment's decision not to include
home equity in the financial aid
equation. The change was one
which helped meet the needs of
the middle class — those who felt
they owned too much to qualify
for aid, because they might have
bought a house for $30,000 20
years ago, and now it's worth
$400,000. Yet, their incomes had
not changed dramatically, and
they found themselves not able to
send their student to a high
priced university without having
to either sell their house or take
out a loan on their house.
]My main concern was that
there would be individuals who
felt that this was being done at
the price of not providing low in
come students with the financial
aid they needed. In fact, I think
there were some negative affects
on students who found them
selves coming from the lowest in
come families.
However, that's a national is
sue and not one we faced. At Stan
ford, students received financial
aid awards that were very chal
lenging to understand because we
provided them with federal
methodology, our own methodolo
gy and our financial aid package,
which in some ways brought in el
ements of both.
The real question to ask is, is
the federal government in a posi
tion to be able to process all of
these aDDlications? For me. that

remains a very important question to ask.
I would like the financial aid process to be
streamlined simply because it is very in
timidating for most families, and it feels
bureaucratic.
SW: How does the Summer Session pro
gram for high school students located at
Branner Hall affect their chances of get
ting into Stanford?
Montoya: The program interests us be
cause the program interests students who
are highly motivated. I think that some
students have gotten to know Stanford fac
ulty and, as a result, submit recommenda
tions from Stanford faculty that have been
useful to us in better understanding the
talents that the student might bring to the
institution. But it would be unfair for me
to say that because one enrolled that he or
she would be at an advantage in our appli
cant process,
SW: Could you describe how you market
Stanford's image ?
Montoya: Well, I don't have to do a lot in
terms of marketing Stanford's image, per
se. I think the presentation that I give at
the College Summer Institute on Market
ing at UC-Santa Cruz speaks more to
schools who are not as selective as Stan
ford.
Given the amount of press that Stan
ford gets, I'm not sure we have as much
control over what the world thinks about
Stanford as those who work at smaller in
stitutions, which are always hoping a story
about them will appear in the newspaper.
We have the luxury of being in the newspa
per, I think, close to everyday.

Jim Montoya recently ac
cepted the Class of '97,
marking the culmination
of his second year as Dean
of Admissions. Throughout the
summer, as during the normal
academic year, Montoya speaks
with a variety of people, ranging
from a daughter of a Stanford em
ployee looking for advice on the
application process to entire class
es on such topics as marketing, af
firmative action and ethics. Mon
toya spoke to The Stanford Week
ly writer John MacKenzie about
th? current trends and recent
events surrounding the admis
sions process.
SW: Given the rising cost of iu
ition, what changes do you fore
see in the admissions process ?
Montoya: Well, I think we must
justify to the students and par
ents why we cost as much as we
do. I think people are surprised to
learn that even the high amount
of tuition does not cover the cost
of a Stanford education. To meet
the high cost of undergraduate
and graduate education, the bud
get is supplemented by the gen
erosity of our alumni and the uni
versity investment funds.
One of the other challenges
the Admissions Office will face
will be in working with students
and parents earlier. There are
some who say that even junior
high school is too late. If a family
hasn't started saving, chances
are they are going to have diffi
culty meeting the costs, particu
larly if they find themselves in
the middle-class group — those
who are clearly going to have to
struggle financially in order to
meet the full cost of tuition.
SW: In the April 6 issue of The
Daily you said that no attempt
was made to "massage the num
bers" in terms of the diversity of
incomming class. What sort of
forces do you think are control
ling these demographics and
where do you think they will go in
the next 10years?

Montoya: Quite honestly, a lot of what we
see is taking place in the public school sys
tem. The way I approach the issue of diver
sity on this campus is to make certain we
have a diverse and talented applicant pool,
so that one does not play games in the se
lection process or manipulate a situation
where unqualified students are admitted.
I think we are going to see challenges in
how we interpret credentials, particularly
of recent immigrants. The one change —
the greatest change — that I sensed this
year was the increased number of recent
immigrants. They are truly outstanding
students, but students who may not have
the facility with the English language or
who are faced with special challenges
which detracted from their academic
prowess and overall academic record.
Moreover, I think we will continue to
see an increase in the percentage of Asian-
American, Native American, Chicano/Lati
no and African-American students in our
applicant pool.
SW: What happened with the gender gap?
There was talk about more females than
males accepting admission into the incom
ing freshman class.
Montoya: We assume we will have a class
where the figure will be 50-50.1 don't have
any explanation why the yield rate changed
(from last year), although one percentage
point represents 16 students. This small
number can slightly tip the balance. I think
we will continue to see a higher percentage
of women enrolling at colleges and univer
sities.
I think we have to be strong proponents
of educational opportunities for women,

particularly in the high schools. Even at
the best private high schools we still see a
very small representation of girls in AP
Calculus and Physics. Nationally, we see
an increase in the number of girls report
ing AP scores in math and science, but I
still feel there is work to be done in that
area.
SW: With so many new people in top spots
in the administration, how do you think
the admissions process will be affected ?
Montoya: I don't think it has changed the
process. I think we have been well served in
the admissions office because the new
president and the new provost are clearly
individuals who are identified with having
a strong commitment to undergraduate
education.
At times, there are students and par
ents who question whether Stanford is a

good place for an undergraduate. Often I
hear students say, "Well, I'll go to this
school," usually a school that is less ex
pensive, "but I'll go to Stanford for gradu
ate school where it really counts." And, of
course, I once again find myself in the role
of an educator attempting to talk about
the importance of the kind of experience
we offer our undergraduates, particularly
the intellectual experience and the overall
experience.
In general, I don't think a new Dean of
Admissions can dramatically change what
is very sound philosophy, nor would he or
she want to. I am in a position to do some
fine tuning, and I think the new president
may want to do some fine tuning, but I do
not think we will see any dramatic
changes. We are committed to recognizing
excellence. There are only so many ways in
which one can do that.

SW: What impact do you think
the restructuring of financial aid
on the national level will have on
admissions at Stanford?
Montoya: I think prospective
students and their families are
getting a lot of mixed messages
from the press on what the
changes are going to be. I am con
cerned that they will walk away
from reading the newspaper feel
ing that there are fewer opportu
nities for them to attend costly in
stitutions.
This year we faced the inter
esting challenge of how we were
going to deal with the govern
ment's decision not to include
home equity in the financial aid
equation. The change was one
which helped meet the needs of
the middle class — those who felt
they owned too much to qualify
for aid, because they might have
bought a house for $30,000 20
years ago, and now it's worth
$400,000. Yet, their incomes had
not changed dramatically, and
they found themselves not able to
send their student to a high
priced university without having
to either sell their house or take
out a loan on their house.
]My main concern was that
there would be individuals who
felt that this was being done at
the price of not providing low in
come students with the financial
aid they needed. In fact, I think
there were some negative affects
on students who found them
selves coming from the lowest in
come families.
However, that's a national is
sue and not one we faced. At Stan
ford, students received financial
aid awards that were very chal
lenging to understand because we
provided them with federal
methodology, our own methodolo
gy and our financial aid package,
which in some ways brought in el
ements of both.
The real question to ask is, is
the federal government in a posi
tion to be able to process all of
these aDDlications? For me. that

remains a very important question to ask.
I would like the financial aid process to be
streamlined simply because it is very in
timidating for most families, and it feels
bureaucratic.
SW: How does the Summer Session pro
gram for high school students located at
