# Zoe Dunning to file lawsuit
## 
### 
Recent Business School graduate Zoe
Dunning, a lesbian naval reservist pend
ing discharge, will file a federal court ac
tion in the next two weeks challenging
Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy,
her lawyer said.
Dunning's action will argue that Clin
ton's policy is a form of discrimination
and "deprives people of their First
Amendment right to expression," said
Mary McNamara, an attorney in the law
firm Morrison and Foerster.

According to McNa
mara, Dunning will
probably be discharged
from her post as a re
servist in the Naval Avi
ation Depot in Alameda
in the near future. Dun
ning has been at that
post for three years, and,
according to reports
from the San Jose Mer-

cury News, she has received dozens of
awards and commendations.
"The 'don't ask, don't tell, don't pur
sue' policy is clearly unconstitutional,"
McNamara said. "It violates the equal
protection clause."
Under the new policy, homosexuals in
the military may not openly declare their
sexual preference, but will no longer be
asked to declare their sexuality when ad
mitted into the armed forces. Dunning,
by challenging her dismissal, has already
publicly come out of the closet and is in vi
olation of the policy.
"Nothing has changed at all," McNa
mara said. "It's just a reformulation of
the old policy."
However, McNamara is confident that
Clinton's decision will be reversed.
"Anyone can see how stupid and ab
surd, how contradictory and difficult to
understand this policy is," she said.
McNamara said that court rulings
since 1991 have been consistently more
favorable for gays. For example, a U.S.
district judge ruled in January that Naval
Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, a Palo Alto
resident, could not be dismissed just be
cause he was gay.
Dunning could not be reached for com
ment, but she remains adamant in resist
ing the gay ban. She was quoted in a San
Jose Mercury News story on Tuesday as
saying, "When [Clinton] makes a
promise, I take him seriously. . . . I'm

angry that he didn't hold his ground."
Clinton's policy has also angered some
other members of Stanford's gay commu
nity.
Some students at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center voiced their
displeasure at Clinton's policy and vowed
to support Dunning in any way they could.
Michelle Matz, a graduate student who
received a master's in education last
June, echoed the sentiments of many
gays.
"I think [Clinton] totally wimped out,"
Matz said. "He promised a lot more than
he delivered."
Senior Rosa de la Vega, staff member
at the community center, said Dunning
had not yet contacted the center about the
suit. However, de la Vega said, she has the
full support of Stanford's gay community.
"If Zoe called us and asked for our sup
port, I know people would rally about it,"
de la Vega said. "But coordination is diffi
cult. ... As soon as I know what's going
on, I'd be more than willing to help."
De la Vega said that although the com
munity center is not very active in the
summer, once people return in the fall
there could be additional vocal support
for Dunning.
