# Stanford may head to China
## 
### 
Overseas study in the People's Repub
lic of China may soon become a reality.
After losing the Stanford Center in
Tours, France, to 1990 budget cuts and
closing the program in Salamanca, Spain,
in 1992, Overseas Studies may be ex
panding with a China program in the
works. This decision comes on the heels
of Stanford's new Moscow campus, open
ing its doors this fall.
According to Russell Berman, director
of Overseas Studies, "All logic speaks to
enriching the Atlanticist orientation of
Overseas Studies with a strong East Asia
commitment."
"We have a program in Kyoto and we
should have a program in China." Over
seas Studies has taken first steps to open
ing negotiations in Beijing and Hong
Kong, he added.
The idea of an overseas campus in
China has been discussed since 1990, but
it was given higher priority when
Berman was re-appointed as director of
Overseas Studies. "We still need central
administration approval of this, but

there is wide faculty support," Berman
said.
" "There are strong intellectual rea
sons," Berman said. "The importance of
China, the future importance of China
and the cooperation available with vari
ous universities in China make this an
opportunity crying to be taken, especially
given Stanford's location."
On the flip side of the coin, interest in
Stanford by Chinese international stu
dents has been on the rise for a number of
years.
"In 1980 there were two students on
campus from China," said John Pearson,
director of the Bechtel International
Center. However, Chinese students now
make up the largest portion of interna
tional students on campus with 233 indi
viduals.
"This represents an exceptional coun
try change," Berman said.
