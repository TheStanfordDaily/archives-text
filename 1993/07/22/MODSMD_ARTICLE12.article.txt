# Campbell will run for office
## 
### 
Law Prof. Tom Campbell, a former mem
ber of the U.S. House of Representatives,
announced his candidacy for the California
State Senate last Friday.

The seat will be vacated
prematurely when Republi
can Becky Morgan resigns
on August 17 to run a Sili
con Valley industrial think
tank.
Campbell's announce-)
ment came as a surprise to
many political observers,
including Assemblyman
Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto.

Sher, who also teaches at the Law School,
was also considering entering the race for
Morgan's seat. However, sources from his
Redwood City office have stated that in fact,
he will not run.
In previous statements, Sher expressed
doubts about Campbell's motivation in run
ning for the state Senate, citing that Camp
bell had already held the higher position of
representing the Peninsula in the U.S. Con
gress.
Campbell gave up his seat in the House to
vie for the Republican nomination for a seat
in the U.S. Senate last year. He lost a narrow
race in the GOP primary to Bruce Hershen
son, who was defeated in the general election
by Sen. Barbara Boxer.
Sher, along with many of the Peninsula's
politically active people, said he felt a state

Senate seat would be a step backward for
Campbell.
Ron George, a spokesperson for the
Campbell campaign, said that at first, "he
was one of those people."
But, according to George, he was swayed
because, "Tom is a policy person. He doesn't
really enjoy the politics and the campaigning
process. He enjoys the legislative process."
Campbell felt he could make a greater im
pact in the state Senate, which has only 40
members, than he could make in the much
larger U.S. House of Representatives,
George said.
George added that Campbell has no plans
for running for higher office, but his main
objective remains to "change the world."
