# $80 K physics thief is caught
## 
### 
Of all the universities in the world, it
seems like Stanford should know better
than to hire people with a record of em
bezzling.
Earceal Scott, formerly an office as
sistant in the Physics Department, was
sentenced to 16 months in prison on
Tuesday, after pleading no contest to
two counts of grand theft and two counts
of forgery.
Stanford estimates that Scott had
stolen $83,231 since she began working
at the University in August, 1991.
Through her job with the University,
Scott, 45, was responsible for booking
trips for researchers. She used this posi
tion to create phony trips, for which she
would order plane tickets and traveler's
checks. Scott would then cancel the trips
and forge professors signatures on the
refund checks. She pulled this scam
about six times a month, for a total of
over 110 fraudulent vouchers. Scott was
arrested on May 25. She promised to pay
the uninsured money back, but dis
agreed about the amount she had stolen.
Scott said she used the money to gam
ble at racetracks and bingo parlors in an
effort to pay for medical expenses ac
crued by her daughter, who has been di
agnosed with psychotic schizophrenia.
Embezzling became a career path for
Scott shortly before a 1980 arrest, and
her criminal resume includes a year in a
Nevada prison in 1989 and a conviction
in Alameda County a year later. Stanford
picked her up two months after her re
lease on probation for the forgery convic
tion in Alameda.
