## Good, bad and WUG-ly Stanford gets mixed results at World U. Games 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
The 1993 World University Games in Buffalo,
N.Y. are over, and with considerable help from Stan
ford athletes, the United States has exchanged sev
eral million dollars for a few pounds of precious met
als.
A financial bomb for the American organizers
who lost as much as $5 million, the "WUG" was an
overall athletic success for the American competi
tors, who collected 75 medals, including 30 gold —
nearly twice as many medals as the next country,
Canada, located just a few triple-jumps from the
Games.
One American who helped snag one of those gold
coins was 1992 Stanford graduate Chryste Gaines.
The 1992 NCAA Champion in the 100-meters an
chored the women's 4xloo relay team, which blazed
the track in 43.37 seconds — the fastest time this
year.
That is even more impressive when considering
that the World University Games are only open to
current students and recent college graduates. It is
designed to showcase the world's young, developing
talent, not necessarily the world's absolute best.
Leadoff runner Cheryl Taplin of LSU said, "All of
us have run against each other collegiately, and to
come together and run the best time in the world is
amazing."
Nigeria took the silver in 44.25 seconds, and
Canada won the bronze in 45.26 seconds.
Another recent Stanford graduate, Julie Foudy of
the class of 1993, was heroic in defeat as the Ameri
can women's soccer team settled for the silver medal
after losing to China 2-1 in the finals. Foudy scored
the Americans' only goal to give the USA a 1-0 lead
afler 23 minutes.
But China scored two goals in the second half to

hand the USA its first nwyor loss in women's soccer
international competition ever.
That was not a typo.
But while some American women were disap
pointed with a silver medal, others were ecstatic.
The volleyball team finished second to Romania for
its highest finish ever in the World University
Games, bettering its bronze in 1991.
Appropriately, the women's captain was Bev
Oden, who led Stanford to its first-ever national
championship in women's volleyball last fall. Oden
was a four-time Ail-American at Stanford.
Along with Natalie Williams of UCLA, Oden is re
garded as one of the world's top volleyball prospects
and is considered a key to the continuing improve
ment of Team USA for years to come.
Oden's former Cardinal teammate Cary Wendell
also contributed to the Americans' silver-winning
performance. As a freshman last year, Wendell was
one of the major forces in Stanford's championship
winning year.
Stanford's male volleyball representative was not
as fortunate as Oden and Wendell at the WUG.
Canyon Ceman set for the Americans, who finished
a disappointing ninth place.
"They played well but lost two five-set matches,"
said Stanford women's volleyball head coach Don
Shaw of the American men. "Ninth was then the
best they could do in their bracket."
Former Stanford tennis Ail-American Heather
Willens was also thwarted in her attempts to acquire
a medal or two. She was eliminated in both the sin
gles and doubles draws. In the doubles, Eva Marie
Schurhoff and Sabine Gerke of Germany squeezed
by Willens and partner Pam Nelson of Califomina,
7-5, 7-6(8-6).
And Jing Yi of China double-breadsticked Willens
in the singles quarterfinals, 6-1,6-1.
