# Card athletes begin Olympic Fest
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Hundreds of athletes and
coaches representing 37 of the 41
Olympic sports have descended
upon a not-so-unsuspecting San
Antonio, Texas. This is the annual
orgy of young American athletic
talent known as the Olympic Fes
tival.
A number of Stanford athletes
will participate in this year's Fes
tival — including a platoon of in
coming freshmen.
Two of those incoming frosh
belong to Stanford's latest highly
touted women's basketball re
cruiting class, ranked No. 2 in the
country behind Georgia.
Charmin Smith, a 5-foot-10
shooting guard from St. Louis,
Mo., will play for the North squad.
She will probably back up
Cindy Lamping, one of the four
Purdue representatives on that
team. Smith averaged over 24
points-per-game as a senior at
Ladie Horton Watkins High
School.
Kate Starbird, one of Stan
ford's most-hyped recruits, will
play for the West squad. She is a 6-
2 forward from Tacoma, Wash.,
who averaged about 30 points
per-game as a senior at Lakes
High School.
Stanford's men will also have a
representative on the courts. 6-2
sophomore guard Dion Cross,
from Little Rock, Ark., will play
for the West team.
The basketball tournament
features a round-robin series, fol
lowed by single-elimination play
off games.
Other incoming Stanford re
cruits trying to make waves at the
Festival are Bridget Finn and
Amy Markezich, future Cardinal
synchronized swimmers.
They will be joined by a current
Stanford team member, sopho
more Julie Davies, who was the
highest scoring freshman at last
year's collegiate nationals. Stan
ford synchronized swimming
coach Vickey Weir heads the West
team.

Sophomore guard Dion Cross is one of many Stanford athletes and
recruits who will showcase their talents in the upcoming U.S.
Olympic Festival. Cross will play for the West squad in the four-team
men's basketball competition.
