# Weir named varsity synchro-swim coach
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
After 15 years, it is finally of
ficial. Vickey Weir, longtime
coach of Stanford's synchro
nized swimming club team, will
be retained as the squad's coach
when the team gains varsity
status this fall.
"We're pleased to officially
welcome Vickey to our staff of
coaches," Athletic Director Ted
Leland said. "Of course, we are
already familiar with her abili
ties, her level of dedication and
her 15 years of commitment to
the Stanford athlete. She is
very popular with her students.
We're pleased that she will con
tinue to be our synchronized
swim coach."
Synchronized swimming will
become Stanford's newest var
sity sport, to be followed by
women's lacrosse in the 1994-
95 school year and women's
water polo in 1995-96.
The increased number in
Stanford's varsity sports,
which will tally 16 men's
squads, 14 women's teams, and
one coed sport (sailing) afler
the addition of synchronized
swimming, is part of the efforts
of the Department of Athletics
to bring Stanford in compliance
with Title IX, a federal law ban
ning sex-based discrimination
in educational institutions
which receive federal aid.
Judging by past results, syn
chronized swimming will fit the
profile of a highly successful
Stanford varsity sport. During
Weir's tenure, the Cardinal has
consistently placed well, as a
team and individually, in colle
giate competition.
Despite the disadvantages of
non-paid coaching positions, a
minimal budget and no scholar
ships, Stanford has finished
second to powerhouse Ohio

State at the U.S. Collegiate Na
tional Championships seven
consecutive years and has
notched top-five finishes in 13
of Weir's 15 years as head
coach.
Weir has also coached 14 in
dividual national champions
and 39 collegiate All-Ameri
cans. Stanford's success under
Weir is even more remarkable
considering that all this was ac
complished without any varsity
recognition.
In comparison, the Ohio
State Buckeyes' program has
been a varsity sport for 18 years
and offers several scholarships
to entice top recruits.
Synchronized swimming has
been in competition collegiately
for over 50 years and currently
about 100 schools compete in
various collegiate levels. Due to
recent national attention to
gender-equity concerns, the
NCAA Gender Equity Task
Force is currently considering a
proposal to include synchro
nized swimming on the list of
officially supported NCAA
sports.
Recent court cases involving
athletes at the University of
Texas, Brown and Colgate may
put more pressure on schools to
equate the gender ratio of ath
letic participation to the pro
portions of men and women in
the general student body. To
meet that guideline, many
schools will need to expand var
sity opportunities in women's
sports.
That may mean that more
schools will pick up synchro
nized swimming as a varsity
sport in the near future. Cur
rently, only three other Pacific
10 Conference universities —
California, Arizona and Ari
zona State — regularly compete
against Stanford in synchro
nized swimming.
