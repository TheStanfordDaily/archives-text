"The Secret Garden" brings Broadway
snazz and adult sensibilities to Frances Hodg
son Burnett's belbved children's tale. The
touring production, in full bloom at the Or
pheum Theater, sparkles with originality
while preserving the tender spirit and Gothic
ambiance of the 1911 classic.
The curtain rises on a symbolic dance of
death, as spoiled Mary Lennox calmly watches
her parents and servants succumb to the dead
ly cholera sweeping through colonial India.
Orphaned and unwanted, the little diva is
grudgingly taken in by her Uncle Archibald, a
brooding, hunchbacked Mr. Rochester-type
who lives in a gloomy mansion on the York
shire moors. Left to wander the estate, Mary
meets Dickon, a mystical moor-dweller who
teaches her to garden.
But the place Mary longs to enter — her
dead Aunt Lily's equally dead garden — re
mains shrouded in a mystery as thick as the
ivy climbing its stone walls. As Mary searches
for the garden's key, and then its door, she
finds that hers is not the only secret locked

away in Misselthwaite Manor.
Indeed, getting into the garden proves to
be the easy part. Once there, Mary must bring
it back to life— as she reluctantly struggles to
bring the rest of the household into harmony
as well.
Marsha Norman's lyrics beautifully articu
late the psychosexual subtext Burnett's read
ers always knew was creeping through the
walls of Misselthwaite. With a few digressions,
her libretto is lifted straight from the novel.
For the grown-ups, Norman throws in a
romantic twist involving the ghost of
Archibald s wife, Lily. An entire graveyard of
ghosts haunts the manor — as well as memo
ries — in which most of the characters dwell.
Norman also introduces Archibald's
younger brother, a doctor whose devotion be
lies his deep-seated jealousies. And Dickon is
no longer a sensitive 12-year-old but a teenage
granola shaman. Fans, of the book can be as
sured that Norman's vision merely extrapo
lates on Burnett's story, rather than obscures
it. And the show's energetic cast realizes that

vision superbly.
Lydia Ooghe's Mary is ferociously mature,
while Yariv Segal is deliciously immature as
her invalid cousin, Colin. Norman, like Bur
nett, understands the way real children think
and act, and doesn't push them to be unnat
urally cute. In return, Ooghe and Segal deliv
er honest and lively performances. The chil
dren alternate roles with Demaree Alexander
and Chad Hutchison.
As Archibald, Kevin McGuire is almost too
likeable. Amanda Naughton's chambermaid
is a cross between Mary Poppins and Peter
Pan, and Roger Bart brings big-brother
charm to Dickon.
Lucy Simon's moody orchestrations blend
wuthering winds and ghostly sobs with an as
sortment of uniformly stellar voices. Listen for
hints of both English and Indian folk music,
modern pop influences in "Winter's on the
Wing" and a stunning duet, "Lily's Eyes," and
nursery-rhyme simplicity in "Race You to the
Top of the Morning," "Round-Shouldered
Man" and"The Girl I Mean to Be."

Heidi Landesman sets garden, house and
all in a life-sized rendering of a toy theater,
complete with cut-out props and turntable
stage. On a pinwheel of color, white-sheeted
chandeliers evoke Missel thwaite's abandoned
ballroom and a lattice of gilt picture frames
brings past and present into an almost un
comfortable intimacy.
The profusion of Victoriana more than
holds its own against the Orpheum's ornate
interior; it's like reading a lavishly illustrated
edition of the book.
Under the direction of Susan H. Schul
man, "The Secret Garden" emerges as a
metaphor for life and death, sickness and
health — a theatrical Eden. It's a world with
out class conflicts, where wisdom and weed
ing tips are dispensed with a wink and the
Yorkshire accents are convincing without
being distracting. This is one garden that
wasn't meant to be kept secret.
