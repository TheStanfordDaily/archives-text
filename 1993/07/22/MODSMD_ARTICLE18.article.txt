# "THE SECRET GARDEN" AND JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT" SHAKE UP THE LOCAL THEATER SCENE
## 
### KIMBERLY CHRISMAN DAVID BIANCO 
Sure, we all love Disneyland, but after
about five hours of smiling rodents and
"thrilling" rides, we get tired of "The Happiest
Place on Earth" — and we're ready to go
home.
San Francisco's latest production of
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream
coat" isn't much different. Don't get me wrong
— Joseph is a lot of fun, with great dancing,
campy costumes and the kind of music that
keeps you singing the next day the way only
Andrew Lloyd Webber can.
But with at least one reprise of every major
song in the show — and sometimes two — it
seems like Joseph's producers focused on mak
ing the Broadway-bound show seem twice as
long as long as its rivals.
"Joseph" is a rock musical, telling the famil
iar Biblical story of the dreamer coming of age
through modern music. But unlike "Tommy,"
"Chess," or even "Jesus Christ Superstar" (by
the same Lloyd Webber-Tun Rice team),
"Joseph" turns every number into a parody of

a different musical genre. Case in point: for
"Go, Go, Go, Joseph," the show-stopper, the
cast dresses up in '60s hippie outfits, with psy
chedelic lights and dance moves to match.
Three of Joseph's 11 brothers are played by
African-Americans, and they take center stage
in "Benjamin Calypso," which turns to a
Caribbean beat replete with lyrics like "Ben
jamin is straighter than the big bamboo." The
20-year-old show is even updated to include a
rap scene, as the brothers don sunglasses and
rap their lines in "Poor, Poor Joseph."
The country/western "One More Angel in
Heaven" is one of the best of the evening, be
ginning as a dirge as the brothers tell Jacob that
his favorite son (Joseph) is dead. As soon as
Jacob leaves the stage, the tune becomes a rol
licking victory song — a kind of "Hee Haw"
meets the Old Testament.
Indeed, the whole show is one long
anachronism, in which a giant Sphinx can turn
into a slot machine and the Pharaoh seems to
believe he's... well, let's just say "in the '505."

The incongruity of time and place is eased,
however, by two elements that are definitely
1993: the narrator, played by Kelli Rabke, and
a children's choir. Rabke is in almost every
scene, and her strong voice and storyteller role
help connect us to the very weird events taking
place on scene.
The 50 children from Bay Area schools are
simply delightful, and they never take them
selves too seriously. In keeping with the show's
theme, each is dressed in a bright color, chore
ographed to create rainbows as they sing and
dance.
The producers clearly intend "Joseph" as a
"family musical"; in addition to the choir, the
show has puppet snakes, camels and birds. But
the costumes definitely give it a "PG-13" rat
ing. Not only does star Michael Damian (of
"The Young and the Restless") have his shirt
off through half of the show, but the nubile
Egyptian women show a bit too much skin to
make the show appropriate for the "Sesame
Street" set.

Since "Joseph" is a cartoon, the characters
hardly elicit empathy from the audience. Even
in dramatic moments, like Joseph revealing
his identity to his estranged brothers, it's diffi
cult for us to relate, since we're still waiting for
the next sight gag.
Don't make the mistake of leaving the first
time the actors bow. The show goes on with
two more reprises — "Close Every Door"
drags more than any other point in the show,
but "Joseph Megamix" gives a fitting climax as
the performers shed their rainbow costumes
for all-white workout outfits.
The "Megamix" is a high-powered, 15-
minute curtain call in which every performer
gets to show off a few good dance moves and
each major song in the show is revisited for
about a minute. Finally, Joseph rises to heaven,
his coat trailing the entire spectrum behind
him. This finale is highly entertaining, and if
each song hadn't already been reprised, it
would have been even better.
