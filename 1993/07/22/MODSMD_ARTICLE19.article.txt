## Foul fun for a few Hocus Pocus 
### 
"Hocus Pocus" centers around a trio ofbum
bling witches who must suck the life out of small
children in order to preserve their immortality.
As appealing as it sounds, the film doesn't rank
high on the list of college students' summer
must-sees —a quick peek at the audience shows
that it caters to the 10-and-under crowd.
"Witches of Eastwick" it ain't.
The God-fearing citizens of 17th century
Salem, who were somewhat less tolerant of al
ternative lifestyles than their contemporaries,
execute Winifred Sanderson (Bette Midler) and
her two sisters, Mary (Kathy Najimy) and Sarah
(Sarah Jessica Parker), for luring the local chil
dren to their deaths. Before dying, they vow to
return to Salem when a virgin lights their "Black
Flame Candle" on All Hallows Eve.
Cut to Halloween, 1993. Enter the virgin,
Max Dennison (Omri Katz), newly relocated
from Los Angeles. Incredulous of the local leg
ends, and attempting to impress both his sister
Dani (Thora Birch) and his girlfriend Allison
(Vinessa Shaw), he lights the Candle, resurrect
ing the Sanderson sisters. And since Winifred
and crew must consume a child before dawn in
order to secure eternal life, it falls upon Max to
thwart their foul plan.
The suspense mounts with each passing mo
ment Will the Sanderson sisters be stopped?
Will Dani end up bubbling in a cauldron? Will
the good children of Salem escape being de
voured?
Two words. Disney Pictures.
Midler's commanding presence makes her
uniquely suited for her role as leader of the trio.
Parker, seemingly fated to never be cast against
type, plays another blonde airhead, while Na
jimy plays the good-natured sidekick. The two
supporting actresses display considerable
comedic talent and work well with Midler. Katz
and Shaw give bland but solid performances,
and Birch is almost endearing as the smart
alecky younger sister.
Although the basic elements of entertain
ment are there, the movie as a whole fails to cap
ture our interest. Except for a few genuinely
funny scenes—a cameo by Penny Marshall as a
disgruntled housewife comes to mind — much
of the humor is directed towards the Fisher-
Price crowd.
The predictable plot, simplistic special effects
and the theme of witchcraft will probably appeal
to kids, but not to the sophisticated tastes of col
lege students. If you're bored and in the mood
for a no-brainer, look no further. But take your
favorite 6-year-old with you. At least you can
feed off of their enjoyment.
