## Column My mother, myself 
### 
I CAN EXHALE NOW. I can
scrub off this makeup. I can
throw my clothes on the floor
and dance naked on my unmade
bed. If I want to, that is. Mom was
here, and now she's gone.
It's nothing personal. It's just
that parents tend to dampen one's
illusions of having sprung fully
armed from the sea foam. They re
mind us of our roots — of all the
embarrassing things we said and
did when we were little, all the
sports teams and school plays we
didn't make. Parents know these
things, and they like to bring them
up at inconvenient moments.
There are some things about
my mother that I will never under
stand. How she ended up married
— at 19 — to my father, a staunch
Ivy Leaguer eight years her senior,
is a mystery to me. How they re
main happily married 24 years
later is an even bigger one. It must
have something to do with both of
them missing out on the '60s.
I don't understand her books
on tape. I don't understand her
Barbra Streisand fixation. Of
course, she doesn't understand
why I don't have any salt in the
kitchen, or a cheese shredder, or
why I sometimes feel the need to
vilify her in print. But it's not my
fault that her parents wouldn't let
her take psychology.

The cover of her high school
yearbook depicts my mother sit
ting atop a wild-eyed horse, wear
ing a decidedly un-PC, pseudo-Na
tive American fringed number
complete with moccasins and tom
ahawk. Another photo depicts her
as a young Jackie Kennedy in pink
angora, sitting at the wheel of her
convertible T-Bird. Let's just say
I've never seen a pink rabbit.
Then there are the prom pictures
— dozens of them, all with different
guys — with Mom wearing pink
brocade dresses she made her
self, looking like Junior Miss 1967.
The woman had big hair at age 5.
I tried the big hair. I tried the
cheerleader thing, the sewing thing,
the dating thing, the Girl Scouts. It
wasn't me. But it was very much
her. And there's something very
unnatural — and uncomfortable
— about my size 10 feet following
in her size 7 footsteps.
The truth is, I envy her. I envy
her popularity, her prettiness, her
ability to flirt with married men.
The only advice my mother ever
gave me was "always wear lip
stick" and "be nice to boys."
Maybe I should have listened.
But popularity isn't genetic, and
neither is the ability to differentiate
mauve from taupe. Everything I
have from my mother is borrowed,
something to put on for show when

I want to blend in with the grown
ups. Her way of standing with one
foot poised in front of the other.
Her vacant-yet-attentive smile.
Her color-coordinated accessories,
or, as one friend jokingly termed
them, "WASP accoutrements."
I've never bought a piece of jew
elry, a tube of lipstick or a pair of
nylons in my life. To do so would
be to give in, to condemn myself to
a life of throwing pool parties,
buying retail and volunteering in
soup kitchens. But I borrow my
mother's and call myself a rebel.
I admit, I owe her big. She in
troduced me to the joys of fondue
and taught me to write thank you
notes. She took me to my first play,
my first library, my first Sunday
school class. And she probably
kept me out of a lot of trouble that
I don't even know about.
But these days, she won't let me
call her "Mom" in public. We're on
a first-name basis, and I hate it.
She won't let me pay for dinner,
even though I can afford it now.
She pretends to like my apart
ment, but I can't help wondering if
she finds my life boring. And I
can't help wondering if it is.

Kimberly Chrisman would sooner
die than wear pink in public.
