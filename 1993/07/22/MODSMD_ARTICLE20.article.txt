						whale of a flop
## Free Willy 
### 
Though "Free Willy" suffers from a bad
title, a weepy Michael Jackson ditty, a trailer
that gives away its climax and hackneyed kid
movie devices, it does not, to its credit, feature
Sharon Stone without any underwear.
Jesse, a streetwise orphan who hates every
body, including his super-nice foster mom and
dad, gets busted for graffiti defacement at the
Northwest Adventure Park. There, he meets
Willy, a testy killer whale who also hates every
one, cxccpt for Jesse, as evidenced by Willy's
unfortunate failure to gobble Jesse up when he
trips into Willy's pool.

The rest of the film marches along the road
of Hollywood film formula with perfect
aplomb, including a wise Indian groundskeep
er that dispenses ancient wisdom, a pretty
whale trainer who shows Jesse how to make
Willy roll over, and an evil park owner who
uses too much gel, drives a black Corvette and
hates Willy with an unholy fury.
"Free Willy" crawls at a snail's pace, and the
subplot involving Jesse's struggle to leave his
life of delinquency and embrace his foster par
ents serves as melodramatic filler. Even the cli
max, when it finally comes, ambles along with
zero intensity, due in part to glaring plot lapses
and a rickety premise.
Of note is Michael Madsen — the cop-tor
turing psycho in "Reservoir Dogs" — taking
a decidedly different turn as an ultra-cool
foster dad who wants to play catch, hands out
allowance money and doesn't mind when
Jesse takes his truck. Linked with an equally
nice mom, it seems odd that Jesse wants to
leave this nice couple and further his life of
unmitigated evil.
Nevertheless, many moviegoers applauded
the movie's end. And the whale scenes, though
few and far between, give a small sample of
their incredible power and intelligence. If
you're a whale lover, or simply someone who
appreciates the grace of these animals, you'll
just have to sit through some bad, one-dimen
sional human behavior and same-old story
telling before seeing a killer whale in action.
