The Italian Stallion takes a half step towards re
covery with this "Die Hard-on-a-moutaintop"
flick. Renny Harlin - who directed Die Hard II
— provides Stallone with a dizzying set of ac
tion sequences that will leave you quaking in
your multiplex Unfortunately, Sly's heavy hand

fell on the screenplay, bestowing upon us the
lamest wisecracks this side of "Howard The
Duck." Your call. R
The Firm
Here's a sure recipe for boredom. Start with a
badly written, overlong page-turner. Add a di
rector (Sydney Pollack) whose last film was
the memorable "Havana." Stir in a star actor
(Tom Cruise) who couldn't act to save his life.
Let this flavorless dish simmer for two-and-a
half hours, then garnish with an implausible
ending. Warning: Drowziness, fidgeting and
an urge to get up and leave may result. Sug
gested serving: zero. R
4 In The Line of Fire
No it's not a classic. But it is the best mass
entertainment film to come out of Hollywood
this year — Spielberg, Schwarzenegger and
Seattle-based insomniacs included. Clint
Eastwood stars as a Secret Service agent
haunted by his failure to save JFK in '63
Thirty years later, can he stop an unknown
psychotic (John Malkovich) from causing
lightning to strike twice? Take a hint from
Clint's tagline — "That's not gonna happen"
— and put your money on the real last action
hero. R
Water For Chocolate
In Mexico, hot chocolate is prepared by
adding cocoa to boiling water So when a
person is sexually aroused, they are termed
"like water for chocolate." The youngest
daughter of ranching family is forced to stay
at home with her mother despite the atten
tions of a virile suitor. But her passion can t
be contained, so she releases it in the food
that she painstakingly prepares. A delec
table banquet of love, magic and food
served up by Mexican director Alfonso Arau.
Not Rated
Made in America
If you thought the wildly successful "Sister
Act" was bad, wail 'til you get a load of
Whoopi's latest stinker. She plays a woman
whose teenage daughter finds out that she's
the product of artificial insemination. Worse,
her donor /father (Ted Danson) is white —
not a "creamy eggshell kind of white," he's
"white white white." The premise is interest
ing, and the two leads make an appealing
couple. But the writer and director dribble
the story into nothingness — the kind of film
that gives American products a bad name.
PG-13

Menace II Society
John Singleton's boyz couldn't hang in the
Hughes brothers' hood — they wouldn't last II
minutes. Caine Lawson, having just graduated
from high school, tries to survive a long, hot
summer on Los Angeles' mean streets. But
when a simple liquor store run turns into a
homicide, it kicks off a series of events that can
only end in death or a disappearing act. An im
pressive debut. R
Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you. Kenneth Branagh
whips out a Bardful of tricks to bring this
Shakespearian comedy to the screen. Two
sets of couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and fall in love
in a picturesque 18th century Italian villa.
Though the American actors (Keanu Reeves
and, surprisingly, Denzel Washington) can't re
ally hang, the largely British cast pulls off a
bawdily magical comedy. PG-13
Orlando
Even Mickey Mouse, the Mighty Ducks and
Shaquille O'Neal couldn't save this mess. Tilda
Swinton stars in this adaptation of Virginia
Woolf s sly precursor to "The Crying Game," as
an immortal nobleman who becomes a noble
woman halfway through the film Swinton is en
gaging and the cinematography is beautiful.
But unlike Branagh and Greenaway, British di
rector Sally Potter bores us from start to finish.
Read the book. R
Sleepless In Seattle
After her debut film failed to set the box-office
on fire, Nora Ephron (writer of "When Harry
Met Sally") has gone commercial. With a
vengeance. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan star as
the fated-to-meet-and-kiss-atop-tall buildings
lovers. From the treacly love songs to the
sappy homage to "An Affair To Remember,"
the sugar shock quotient of this film will keep
you sleepless no matter where you live. R
4 What's Love Oot To Do With It?
If nothing else, this movie teaches us that Tina
Turner knew how to roll with the many punches
that fate — and husband Ike — kept throwing
at her. From a church choir in Nutbush, Ten
nessee to opening for the Rolling Stones, An
gela Bassett does her best to capture Tina's
electrifying stage presence. Still, Laurence
Fishburne steals the show as her talented ter
ror of a husband. Check it out. R
