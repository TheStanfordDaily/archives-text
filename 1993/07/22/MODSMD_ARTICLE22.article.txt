## 3 times the funk? Tony Toni Tone 
### 
Tony Toni Tone? newest release affirms that
the stagnation of New Jack Swing — faddish
pop music soaked in the scabrous basslines
and maddened samples of hip-hop — isn't as
complete as its untalented proprietors might
have us think. Still the Oakland natives' third
album is anomalous. Compared to the weari
some crooning of H-Town, Jodeci, SWV and
Silk, "Sons of Soul" is a breath of fresh
air.. .that should smell sweeter.
Wisely choosing the album's first single, "If
I Had No Loot," as a point of departure, broth
ers Raphael and D'Wayne Wiggins, along with
cousin Timothy Christian Riley, waste no time
pulling us into an eclectic din where the sam
pled mantras of Ice Cube and Boogie Down
Production's KRS-1 playfully tussle with an
"Oaktown" concoction of whiny, hay-seed vo
cals, down-home guitar riffs and soulful bass
rhythms. We go with "Loot" because our
bones tell us that it's the merely the overture for
a spellbinding artistic undertaking. But three
tracks later, we're no closer to a musical nir
vana that also inspires us to shake our booties.
Instead, 3T indulges its musical fancies with
a trio of good-natured times whose cluttered
arrangements oscillate between brilliance and
insipidity without warning. Trinadadian raga
muffin Genera Grant gives us a reason to toler
ate the dated "What Goes Around Comes
Around," while the moody "My Ex-Girl
friend" wears an annoying chorus around its
neck like an albatross. And then there's "Tell
Me Mama," which invokes the Jackson 5 so
convincingly that we refuse to pass judgment
on it — we grin and bear it with visions of the
good oP days in our heads.
For our patience, we're rewarded with
"Leavin'," a bouncy tune whose swaggering
rhythm section and retro string arrangement
makes us glad we stayed. Then we're treated to
a group of slow jams that remind us of 3Ts
prowess as balladeers. "Slow Wine" immedi
ately reminds us of their past hits ("Whatever
You Want" and "Just Me and You"), while "Pil
low" and"I Couldn't Keep It to Myself" strike

out in new and impressive directions.
The former — complete with a musical
arrangement inspired by the Isley Brothers,
suggestive lyrics and a chorus, bridge and re
frain that build off one another beautifully —
is the album's most ambitious offering, while
the latter's mixture of hip-hop influenced
polyrhythms and seductive horns, strings and
keyboards produce the album's most thor
oughly satisfying number.
With their mixed bag of tricks, Tony Toni
Tone may not be the savior of New Jack Swing,
but their musical integrity reminds us that the
best rump shakers and slow jams are built to
last.

Is it black rock? Or just plain good music? Fishbone would say both — and give you a sweet, hard-edged taste of their guitars to
prove It on their newest album, "Monkey."

Thanks to Timothy Christian Riley, Raphael Wiggins and D'Wayne Wiggins, neither the '70s nor New Jack Swing are dead — in fact,
they're funkier than ever.
