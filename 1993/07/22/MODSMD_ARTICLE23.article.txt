# Give a man a fish
## Fishbone 
### 
Let's say you're in a rock band. You've just
unleashed one of the defining albums of the
decade. What do you do next?
The Black Rock Coalition band Fishbone
attempts to answer that question with its latest
disc, "Give a Monkey a Brain and Hell Swear
He's the Center of the Universe."
Released two years after the landmark "Re
ality of My Surroundings," "Monkey" blends
classically Fishbonesque lyrics with a steadily

evolving sound. The result is a spectacular
album, but still not good enough to challenge
"Reality" as the band's magnum opus.
Always hovering just outside categoriza
tion, Fishbone's high-energy, funked-up style
has been tweaked to emphasize heavier, hard
er-edged guitars. The production work by
David Kahne and the band is nothing short of
sensuous; the lushly thick distortion textures
almost stand on their own as works of art. The
best example of this: the album's second track,
"Servitude."
But the sound of "Monkey" never strays far
from trademark Fishbone funk, "Unyielding
Conditioning" will prove familiar ground for
long-time fans, harkening back at least to
1988's "Ma and Pa." Another track, "They All
Have Abandoned Their Hopes" goes back even
further, recalling the relatively laid-back style
of their 1986 EP, "In Your Face."
There are also shining moments of new
found subtlety, in particular the beautiful track
"Lemon Meringue," the musical high point of
the disc. Its bittersweet ebullience more than
makes up for its disjointed, introspective lyrics
of love and loss.
In "Abandoned," lead vocalist Angclo
Moore sings of the chasm between the haves
and have nots in a country where capitalism
runs amok. Unrelenting poverty afflicts the
worst kind of misery upon its sufferers; as Fish
bone sings, "The/ve discarded their dreams."
"Drunk Skitzo" is Fishbone's latest excur
sion into the mind of a child of a dysfunctional
family, in the tradition of "Ma and Pa" and
"Housework." The narrator sings, "My dad's a
drunk/My mom is a skitzo..and proceeds to
tell us how each family member is messed up.
The only exceptions are the grandparents,
one of whom is dead and the other insane. The
message is that dysfunction is now the norm
for American families, especially poor families,
and that the "normalcy" of earlier generations
is unrecoverable.
Achtung, indeed.
