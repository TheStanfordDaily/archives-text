## It's milking time Stanford should put cash cows out to pasture 
### 
IT'S HARD ENOUGH to
be taken seriously when
your campus looks like a
country club and the student
body throws paper at each
other every Sunday night.
But when Stanford uses
the summer months to pros
titute itself to groups like the
Christian Scientists, year
book campers and cheerlead
ers-in-training, it makes
that type of reputation even
tougher to combat.
Stanford is, first and fore
most, an academic institu
tion. Although the idea of
renting out unused space to
every Tom, Dick and cheer
leader is appealing, that kind
of attitude may not, in the
long run, be best for the Uni
versity.
Some of the conferences
— such as the Center for
Economic Policy Research,
the Molecular Sequence
Analysis, the Soviet Sociolo
gy Workshop and business
school class reunion — are
appropriate uses for the
extra space Stanford has
over the summer.
But the academic confer
ences are, more often than
not, the smaller ones, with
50 or fewer people in atten
dance.
The larger groups — Stan
ford's real money makers —
consist of Christian Scien
tists (825 attendees), basket
ball players (1,843) and, of
course, cheerleaders (1,206).
Stanford should not appear
— to outside guests, visiting
alumni and potential students
— to be a place where integri
ty is thrown to the wind at

every opportunity for some
extra spending money.
After all, what is a tour
guide to say to a group of
prospective students and
their parents when a bunch
of giggling girls with pom
pons run by? Or when they
pass a sign that reads "Em
powerment Through Love"?
Groups like the cheerlead
ers and Christian Scientists
gain legitimacy by having
their name associated with
such a venerable institution.
Stanford does itself damage
by humoring them for cash.
The programs Stanford
runs itself are not nearly as
embarrassing as many of the
conferences it hosts. But
even those need vast im
provements. The high school
summer session, although
laden with good intentions,
is academically problematic.
Although the application
process ensures that the 17-
year-olds are academically
competent, their participa
tion in classes designed for
college students more often
than not lowers the level of
discussion in those classes
and contributes to the wide
spread belief that summer
session classes aren't really
Stanford classes at all. High
school students should be
given a separate curriculum
and summer quarter classes
restricted to college students.
By trading on its reputa
tion to attract outside
groups, Stanford cheapens
that reputation. As Stanford
learned a few years ago,
being a top-ranked universi
ty means facing more in
tense scrutiny from the out
side world. If it wants to con
tinue to walk the thin, beau
tiful line between country
club and academic power
house, Stanford must be a
lot more careful about who it
associates with.
