## Weekly should not pander to 'ludicrous' Hoover propaganda 
### 
The Stanford Weekly really
should not allow itself to be used
as an outlet for Hoover Institu
tion propaganda.
Had your reporter talked to
people not associated with
Hoover, you would have learned,
and you could have informed
your readers, that: Donald
Kennedy faithfully supported
bringing the Reagan Library to
Stanford; the ludicrous claim
that Hoover is not dominantly a
conservative think tank could
have been challenged; and the
corruption of the faculty appoint
ment process at Stanford by
Hoover money would have been
exposed.
I may be old-fashioned, but
shouldn't an independent news
paper at least try to present all

sides of controversial issues?
