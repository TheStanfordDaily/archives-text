# Students, staff decry Clinton's gay compromise
## 
### 
As members of the Stanford
lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nity, we must take issue with
President Clinton's recent re
treat from his commitment to
end the ban on homosexuals in
the military. Monday's events
represent merely an exercise in
semantics, casting a new face on
a very old problem.
The president refers to his
new plan as an "honorable com
promise" which strikes a middle
ground on the issues. There is,
however, nothing honorable
about supporting bigotry.
By abandoning his pledge to
lift the ban, the President has
sent a very strong message. He

has told us that it is alright to bow
from our convictions. He has
shown us that human rights are
negotiable.
According to the new rules, a
gay or lesbian service person could
still be discharged for what takes
place in the privacy of his or her
own off-base apartment or for
merely holding hands with some
one of the same sex, yet Clinton
claims they have the same rights
as heterosexuals. The right to re
main closeted is the only right
Clinton leaves gay military per
sonnel.
Clinton also says the terms of
the Uniform Code of Military
Justice will be applied even-hand
edly between homosexual and
heterosexual service personnel.
Certainly the president is not
asking us to believe that hetero
sexual couples engaging in oral
sex will receive the same punish
ment as couples engaging in ho
mosexual sex. Such heterosexual
acts are also banned by the Uni
form Code but are rarely, if ever,

enforced.
While people across the coun
try, including students and staff
at Stanford, debate the conse
quences of Clinton's actions, the
witch hunts of gay and lesbian
military personnel will likely con
tinue. With Navy Lt. Zoe Dun
ning, a Stanford business school
graduate, Navy Petty Officer
Keith Meinhold and scores of
others prepared to test the con
stitutionality of the ban in high
courts, we can only hope that
they will achieve what President
Clinton has failed to do: ban big
otry in the military.
