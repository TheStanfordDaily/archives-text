## CONTINUING STUDIES PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR OLDER SCHOLARS STORY BY ALI ROWGHANI 
### 
One only has to observe Stanford's adult education
classes to become convinced that there may be some
truth in the saying that education is wasted on the
young.
However, Stanford, unlike many other msyor universi
ties in the country, did not have an adult extension office
for many years. Stanford's Continuing Studies program
was created just five years ago to provide adults in the area
with a unique opportunity to take some of the same cours
es, with the same professors, that Stanford undergradu
ates take.
According to Andrew Lisac, an assistant dean in the Of
fice of Continuing Studies and Summer Session, the pro
gram was initiated for several reasons, the primary one
being that "we simply felt that it was important to broaden
our educational mission to include many talented adults in
the area."
Lisac pointed to public relations as a secondary motiva
tion of the program, saying that "the University felt that
the surrounding communities did not really understand
what was going on in the modern university and within
Stanford in particular. So we wanted students to get ab
solutely the same type of educational experience that un
dergraduates have."
In its short lifetime, the popularity of the Continuing
Studies program has exceeded almost everyone's expecta
tions, according to program administrators. In fact, the Of
fice of Continuing Studies added a second wing to its adult
education program two years ago in response to interest in
a more rigorous curriculum that would allow students to
work toward an advanced degree.
Today, the Office of Continuing Studies not only runs a
large, non-degree-granting program (Continuing Studies)
open to all interested adults on a first-come, first-served
basis, but also administers the master of liberal arts pro
gram, a degree-granting track, which is reserved for a high
ly qualified group of about 70 adult students who have ap
plied and been admitted into the program.
Continuing Studies and master's classes are offered in
all four quarters of the academic year and meet in the
evenings, after most of the students come home from
their jobs. But in contrast to Continuing Studies classes,
many of which are large lecture courses, all of the MLA

classes are small group seminars.
The tuitions differ also, as most
Continuing Studies classes are
two unit courses, which cost
$240, and most masters courses
are worth three units and cost
$720.
The difference, according to
Lisac, between Continuing
Studies and masters students
is in the level of commitment.
"Most people taking the MLA
classes are very committed to the
sort of in-depth, small-focus semi
nars," Lisac said. "It's really quite
intense; it is like a graduate pro
gram. ... In the Continuing Stud
ies program, it is more of a casual
and fun style of learning, because
you can go and soak up these in
credible lectures by these great fac
ulty people, and you don't have to
write a paper if you don't want to.
According to JeffWachtel, asso
ciate dean in the Office of Continu
ing Studies and Summer Session,
there was a strong desire and need
in the surrounding communities
for the Continuing Studies pro
gram.

"The only access that a lot of people have to the
Stanford campus," he said, "is through ballgames or
concerts. These are all good things, but people want to
have access to the academic things that are happening
here too, especially the faculty and the research. Peo
ple see the life of learning as a need, and so we offer it."
Wachtel said that Stanford did a "fair amount" of pub
licity for the Continuing Studies program, including plac
ing brochures in the area newspapers. On one occasion,
Wachtel said, the news media came to Stanford to cover a
Perspectives on Leadership course, which was co-taught
by such prominent Stanford figures as Condoleeza Rice,
Admiral James Stockdale, John Gardner, Wolfgang
Panofsky and Bill Walsh. Despite this publicity, Wachtel
said that the primary cause of the increased popularity of
the program is student approval communicated through
word of mouth.
"It's very exciting," Wachtel said. "We started five years
ago with nothing, and then this past spring quarter, we had
1,000 students and actually had to turn a couple of hundred
away."
Despite the fact that the program is at capacity, Wachtel
said that it is a "break-even operation" for the University.
Professors in the Continuing Studies and master of lib
eral arts programs also attest to the strong desire on
the part of adults to become students again.
Linda Paulson, assistant dean of Continuing Studies
and acting assistant professor of English, teaches in the
master's program and serves as the principal academic ad
visor for its students. She also said there is an eagerness in
the community to re-engage themselves in the life of the
mind.
"In a sense," Paulson said, "everyone in this university,
including all of the undergraduates and even myself, is
spoiled rotten. We really take the privilege of participating
in the world of ideas for granted.
"But in the 'real world,' not many people think or talk
about ideas, and so our adult students become hungry for
the life of the mind. You can see a certain brightness and
enthusiasm in their faces. In teaching these students, you
really see how slim intellectual life is 'out there' and how
hungry people are to learn."

The objective of the master of liberal arts program as ex
pressed in its brochure is "to nurture a broadly edu
cated 'Renaissance' person at a serious level."
And this goal, despite its lofty-sounding triteness to a
cynical undergraduate's ears, is taken seriously by both the
students and the faculty of the MLA program.
Jim Torre, a former Stanford undergraduate who is now
an attorney in San Jose, said he chose to apply to the selec
tive MLA program because of its interdisciplinary ap
proach and "Renaissance person" ideal. Torre also said
that he appreciates the opportunity, in the small MLA
courses, to discuss humanistic questions of prime impor
tance.
"As I take courses," he said, "I select those that further
my understanding about myself and my environment.
Flaubert, Hugo, Dickens and Faulkner all address ques
tions that face the human condition.
"As you become older, you turn inward on the human
condition. These courses allow you to see what others have
said and turn it inward on yourself. It is the lessons of the
past that guide us for the future."
Sometimes, it's hard to distinguish who is enjoying the
master's program more: the adult students or the
teachers. History Prof. Paul Robinson, who has been
teaching Stanford undergraduate and graduate students
for 26 years, said:
"Anybody who has done it will tell you that teaching
'grown-ups' is enormously gratifying, because they all
want it. They are coming back from the real world, and they
have reached a point in life when they recognize what they
missed or forgot. So there's a lot of desire. It's the opposite
of teaching something like a CIV course where a lot of peo
ple are there under duress.
"I taught a 19th-century European thought course in
the MLA program in which we discussed a different major
thinker every week, and I don't think that I've ever had
such a successful course."
French Prof. Marc Bertrand, who is currently teach
ing an MLA course on 19th- and 20th-century Paris,
said adult students sometimes ask questions that are
"surprising to us as professors because we are not used
to them. They ask questions from their own life experi-

ences as lawyers, doctors or
whatever. And sometimes you
are taken aback a bit, but once
you get used to it, it is very
nice."
Bertrand also said that these
adult students differ from under
graduate and graduate students
because their studies have very lit
tle, if any, benefit to their careers.
"Most are working people," he
said, "and you have to be very mo
tivated at the end of the day to
come to a class that lasts 2 1/2
hours."
MLA student Jim Torre sounds
much the same:
"Having been an undergraduate
here and comparing Experiences,
I would guess that people in the
MLA seminars are more motivat
ed to learn than Stanford under
graduates. That is not to criticize
anyone, but just to say that the
MLA students are older men and
women, who have been involved
in their careers for a while. And
as you grow older and begin to ex
perience the process of living and
dying first hand, it changes your
perspective."
