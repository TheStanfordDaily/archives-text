# 'That moment of discovery is something I find particularly fascinating'
## A
						Conversation With: Paul Robinson 
### 
m W" "Wistory Prof. Paul Robin
son, who studies mod
t M ern European intellectu-
JL JL al history, will enter his
27th year at Stanford this fall.
This spring, he published a well
publicized and controversial book,
"Freud and his Critics." He is cur
rently working on another book
examining the relationship of
opera with the history of ideas.
The Stanford Weekly staff writer
Ali Rowghani spoke with Robin
son about his writings and the
state of historical scholarsip at
Stanford.
SW: In the period of time that
you've been here, has Stanford's
natural reputation changed very
much?
Robinson: Even then, Stanford
was considered a very good uni
versity. And when I got this job, it
was considered a plum job. I do
think that it has moved into the
uppermost echelon in the last two
or three decades. It could vary
from department to department,
but this department — the Histo
ry Department that I'm in — was
already awfully good. There were
some very famous people here at
that time, when I got here. David
Potter, Gordon Craig, Gordon
Wright were all here. So it proba
bly has not been that extreme a
change within my discipline. But I
think that the University, as a
whole, has moved into a new cate
gory.
SW: Do you have any theories as to
why it's happened?
Robinson: Money is the most im
portant thing, I think. [Stanford]
was in this terrific growth area
where it wasn't competing with
other parts of the country. It was
really on the upper hand. Silicon

Valley had a tremendous amount to do with
it. Stanford's greatness and strength came
largely in the sciences and in engineering.
It was terrifically well-positioned with the
influx of government money in the 1950'5,
which obviously got us in trouble, but was
an important source of the University's
growth.
SW: Do you think that the University can or
should encourage more undergraduates to
pursue Ph.D. 's in academic fields ?
Robinson: The most important way is to
encourage students to do senior honors es
says and senior research for scientists. . .It
is one of the embarrassments about Stan
ford that given the quality of the faculty
and the students that we send such a small
percentage of our students to do advanced
graduate work, particularly in the humani
ties, where we send a much smaller per
centage of our students on to graduate
school than do Harvard, Princeton, and
Yale.
SW: Do you enjoy the personal and time-ex
haustive interaction with graduate stu
dents, who are aspiring scholars, more
than teaching undergraduates?
Robinson: No. On the contrary, I eryoy
teaching undergraduates more. Of course,
it is a marginal difference, but I think I'm
better at teaching undergraduates. . .The
part of education where people are in the
early stages of discovering something, the
first moments when they find out that
something is interesting some thinker, or
some writer, or some composer. That mo
ment of discovery, the excitement of the
opening up of many vistas, is something I
find particularly fascinating and is what I
think that I have a particular feel for doing.
Either in lecture or in discussion groups, it
is my particular pedagogical skill. And I
find that the most pleasurable.
SW: The History Department is one of the
most prestigious departments on campus.

What do you see as its strengths and weak
nesses ?
Robinson: As you may know, we were
rated the top department in the country
last year, along with Berkeley, Yale, and
Princeton. And for the most part, it has
gotten better in recent years. The part that
I am in, modern Europe, is particularly
fine. Traditionally, and it's still the case
today, Stanford has been "top-heavy" in
the sense that it has always had greater
strength in more recent history than in
older periods. It has been very strong in
modern European history, recent Ameri
can history, and even the recent aspects of
non-European history, Russian history,
Chinese history, Japanese history, Latin
American history, etc. It has been weaker
in older periods. Classical historians are
not even in the department, they are in the
Classics Department. We have a harder
time attracting people in medieval, Byzan
tine, and early modern fields. That's what
I would say is our weakness right
now. . .Also, there are areas of the world
that we have traditionally not attended to.

We have only one Middle Eastern histori
an, and he's only been here about a decade.
We have never really had anyone to teach
the history of India. But despite these
weaknesses, it is really a superb depart
ment, both in terms of scholarship and
teaching.
SW: In your recently published book
"Freud and his Critics, "you compare Sig
mund Freud's stature in intellectual histo
ry to those of figures like Newton, Marx,
and Augustine. What do you mean when
you write "Freud virtually invented a new
way of thinking about the self? "
Robinson: There are two ideas which he
did not entirely introduce, but that he cer
tainly put on the agenda and made part of
our intellectual heritage. First of all is the
unconscious, the idea that we are unaware
of much of what motivates us. The second
thing is the particular emphasis that laid
upon sexuality, particularly the existence
of sexuality before puberty, and that the
presence of these conscious and uncon
scious desires at an early age plays a dra-

matic role in the make-up of the
personality. Those two ideas
which are everywhere in a post-
Freudian world have truly revo
lutionized the way we think
about ourselves in the 20th cen
tury.
SW: Does the description of
Freud as a figure in the history of
ideas grunt that he has been ban
ished from certain departments
only to be embraced by others ?
Robinson: I think that's true.
He isn't taught in the Psycholo
gy Department, which is not in
terested in the kinds of questions
Freud was interested in. It
means that he has become a fig
ure in general intellectual and
cultural history rather than a
figure in the narrow disciplinary
history of psychology. Likewise,
where do we study Marx? Where
do we study Augustine? We don't
study Marx in Economics or Au
gustine in theology; we study
them in Western Culture. They
are part of our intellectual furni
ture. . .And the fact that Freud is
not taught in the Psychology De
partment, but is taught in the
English Department or Reli
gious Studies Department is pre
cisely my point.
SW: Does that mean that he has
been debunked as a scientist only
to be embraced as a humanist?
Robinson: I think that is a bit
too strong. The argument of
whether he should be thought of
as a scientist is not closed. . .he's
not a natural scientist, but he's
not a novelist either since his
ideas are all based on his clinical
experience. He was a practicing
physician who wrote all of his
books in the evenings, on week
ends, and on holidays. So he had
this rich array of case histories

on which his ideas are based, which gives all
Freudian thought a different texture.
SW: Is it useful to classify Freud as one type
of figure or another?
Robinson: He belongs as a border figure.
He was very much influenced by scientists
like Darwin, especially his conception
about the scientific enterprise. All of
Freud's training was scientific. He was
never much interested in philosophy and
had an abiding skepticism for the philo
sophic enterprise. In terms of his imagina
tion, he is much more like Sophocles than
Socrates; he's closer to Shakespeare and
Dickens than Newton, even though he saw
himself as a scientist.
SW: I noticed that you dedicated your book
to three physicians whom you said gave you
a new liver but left you your old spleen.
Could you explain ?
Robinson: You find that mysterious, huh?
Well, I had a liver transplant three years
ago and these are the three physicians who
did it. I always say that this is the best book
that's ever been written on a transplanted
liver. I would have been dead. I was within
perhaps days of dying, and so it seems ap
propriate for me to dedicate the book for
them.
SW: How has this operation changed your
views toward your work ?
Robinson: Not too much. But it has con
firmed my thinking about science. I have
always been a great enthusiast about sci
ence. I think it is a great thing, especially
medicine. And I do not understand my col
leagues in the humanities who bash the
sciences. I think it is one of the great suc
cess stories, both intellectually and hu
manly. And I am one of its beneficiaries, so
I don't sit around and criticize the intellec
tual prejudices of scientists. But it hasn't
really changed my views towards my schol
arship.
