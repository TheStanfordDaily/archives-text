# Selling the Farm
## It's summertime at Stanford and the money is easy 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
They walk with the firm resolve of
a military squadron, forming a
tight cluster of kinetic energy. In
unison they rhythmically clap
their hands and chant, heeding little atten
tion to the curious observers who stop to
watch or peer out car windows. Their loyal
ties are displayed by the color of their uni
forms, worn with a casual but unmistak
able pride.
This isn't the Army, the Navy or the
Marines. It's cheerleading camp, and it's at
Stanford.
All told, over 1,000 nubile, spirited and
loud girls [and a few brazen boys] will de
scend upon the campus this summer, in
cluding 283 girls at the California Activity
Directors Association's (CADA) spirit camp
this week.
And while most Stanford students might
find such a camp little more than an amus
ing and innocent diversion, cheerleading is,
apparently, serious business for the
campers, instructors and parents.
It is serious business, too, for the Uni
versity, which stands to pull in over
$30,000 this week for renting out rooms in
Stern Hall and Cowell Cluster, granting
usage of Wilbur Field and providing food for
the cheerleaders.
Cheerleading camps are just part of a be
wildering array of camps, classes and con
ferences held at Stanford during the sum
mer months. 17,000 people will participate
in such activities, dumping upwards of $5
million in the University's coffers — not
counting revenues from the Bookstore or
Tressidder Union. Of the 17,000, only 300
are full-time Stanford students, according
to Andrew Lisac, dean of Summer Session.
But though administrators insist that it is
unfeasible for the campus

to simply shut down in
the summer, the Univer
sity's liberal sponsorship
of summer activities rais
es questions about
whether Stanford is up
holding or subverting the
academic tradition it
strives to cultivate during
the regular school term.

More questionable
"conferences" using University facilities
this summer include:
• Three events organized by the Church
of Jesus Christ, Scientist, over the course of
20 days. About 850 Christian Scientists
participated, including 750 youths at the
"Empowerment Through Love" camp held
from June 25-27. Campers were housed at
six different campus residences.
• The State Farm Summer College, in
which 640 State Farm insurance agents
will convene to discuss "product knowledge
and business management." The three-day
conference, which will be conducted three
times in August, is, organizers said, a
"strictly State Farm program."
• A travelling tour conducted by an expe
dition agency called North American Trails,
which leads high school students on long,
multi-state trips. A 40-person troupe ar
rives here today and will stay at Crothers
Memorial Hall until Sunday. While at Stan
ford, the group will engage in "hiking,
horseback riding and tennis," according to
a representative for the organization.
• "Yearbook by the Bay," a camp that
will provide instruction for 128 young
school yearbookand newspaper editors
from July 31- Aug. 4.
• Numerous motivational and study
skill-building camps for adolescents, in
cluding Supercamp, a for-profit program
that charges campers $1,500 for 10 days of
instruction. About 500 youths will attend
Supercamp at Stanford this summer.
• Three different cheerleading camps, all
run by separate organizations.

Why does Stanford allow these groups to
congregate on campus, when their objectives
often seem alien to the concept of a universi
ty, especially one of reputed prestige? The
Conference Office, which coordinates and ap
proves such events, insists the University's
academic purpose is not being compromised.
"These are academic programs that
meet the mission of the University," said

Carol Leynse, director of the Conference
Office. "We want to sponsor such groups."
But it is difficult to tell whether Stan
ford's summer mission really includes rig
orous teaching, learning and research. In
stead, it may involve little more than selling
the Stanford name and yanking the udders
of lucrative cash cows.
Trivial pursuits?
That said, one should point out that tradi
tional academic instruction does take place
at Stanford between June and September.
In fact, summer classes have been offered
by Stanford faculty since 1916, when pro
fessors held classes in San Francisco, Lisac
said. But while the original impetus behind
Summer Session was "a civic obligation to
teach classes for the Bay Area community,"
the complexion and importance of the sum
mer quarter has changed considerably.
Lisac estimates that 5,000 students are
registered at Stanford for the 10-week
quarter. The student body includes approx
imately 300 Stanford students, as well as
143 students attending the University-run
academy for high schoolers.
The remainder of the population consists
of students from other countries and other
American universities. There are no admis
sions requirements for such students.
Despite that fact — and the $346 per
unit cost of instruction — Lisac denies that-
Summer Session is a money-making free
for-all. "It's not designed just to make
money, but also to keep the cost of tutiton,
room and board down [during the regular
academic year]," Lisac said. "If summer
quarter didn't exist, tuition would be in
comparably higher."
Jeff Wachtel, Summer Session's bursar,
said summer courses do
not amount to a notice-

able windfall for the Uni
versity. "Tuition covers
expenses," he said.
But to conclude
that the dropoff in stu
dents and tuition funds
during the summer
means that the Universi
ty is barely scraping by

financially would be
disingenuous. In fact, Summer Session is
dwarfed in size and revenue potential by
the 180 conferences and camps conducted
on Stanford grounds from June all the way
up until the week before new freshmen ar
rive in September.
Costly conferences
Located in the venerable, handsome sur
roundings of Encina Commons, Stanford's
Conference Office enjoys the spoils of being
one of the University's more financially
productive institutions. While the splash of
water in a nearby fountain accentuates the
quiet, relaxed mood here, the office is busy
coordinating the Stanford visits of thou
sands of campers and conferees.
The Conference Office fields requests for
residential and meeting space from groups
within and outside of the University. The
number of people who will stay at Stanford
this summer is staggering: while the small
number of Summer Session students are
housed, almost exclusively, in Toyon Hall
or the Mirrielees apartments, visitors fill up
nearly every other residence on campus.
"All major dorms and all row houses have
been put into use," Carol Leynse said. Leynse
said student occupation of dorms, houses and
classrooms precludes aggressive conference
scheduling during the academic year.
The cost of staying at Stanford is not in
significant. Fees for accomodations and food
— levied by the Conference Office — can run
from roughly $41 per night for most youth
programs to nearly $100 for large confer
ences staying at Governor's Corner.
For their money conferences are fre
quently furnished with more luxury and
comfort from the University than nearly
any student would be accustomed to, in
cluding maid service and gourmet food.
Gary Granville, who ran two five-day con
ferences for California county clerks at
Governor's Corner, said "the food is what
makes the difference. The quality of food is
not cafeteria food — it's not what they serve
students in the dining halls. It's well-pre
pared and presented." Meals for confer
ences are prepared by Food Service.
A large bulk of the programs coordinated
by the office are designed and supervised by
University officials and departments them
selves, with faculty and staff receiving some
of the kickbacks.
The Graduate School of Business, for ex
ample, has held summer symposiums on
campus for 40 years, according to Alice
Sheehan, assistant director for executive
education administration, who organizes
the Business School's conferences. The

meetings are attended predominantly by
executives and owners of small companies.

The programs are "put together" by Busi
ness School faculty, who also serve as direc
tors of each conference. The motivation for
holding the conferences, Sheehan said, is "in
part to serve the business community — it is
part of the mission of the Business School in
that sense." In addition, they offer profes
sors the opportunity to "interact with senior
managers and keep informed of what's going
on in the business world."

This summer, the Business School is con
ducting six "Executive Education" pro
grams, lavishly advertised in full-color
brochures. Participants must apply to take
part in the conferences (among other things,
the application asks individuals to check the
box corresponding to their annual income.
The ranges of income start at "$lOO,OOO or
lower"), and if accepted, most dole out a cool
$8,640 for the two-week courses.

Of course, the professors are not doing
charity work. Sheehan said professors are
paid for each session of the pricey programs
they teach, "on top of their regular teaching
salary." The rest of the revenue — after
maintenence costs — goes back to the Busi
ness School.

Summer camp — with perks

The Athletic Depart
ment's camps oper
ate in a similar fash
ion during the sum
mer, although the
participants are in
variably younger and
more übiquitous. Ac
cording to informa
tion from the Confer
ence Office, more
than 5,000 campers
are enrolled in over
40 sports camps run
by Stanford coaches

Cheryl Levick se
nior associate dean of
athletics, said the
camps help coaches
and staffers in teach
ing techniques and
provide an "excellent
educational experi
ence" for the
campers. "Parents
have called me and
told me these camps
made their kid's
summer," she said.

It does not hurt
that a little money is
made on the side, ei
ther. Tuition for the
athletic camps aver
age $400 for one five
day session. The
most expensive is the
golf camp, which
charges $795 for
campers staying on
campus.
Revenue from
sport camps are dis
seminated through
out the University.

Some money goes to pay Housing and Food
costs, some to the Athletic Department for
"wear and tear" wrought on fields and
courts, some to camp staffers and the re
mainder to the individual coaches.
Because the Athletic Department has
taken over management of and bookkeep
ing for the camps from an independent pro
motional agency this year, Levick said she
could not specify how much money the de
partment and its coaches will take in.
But according to Charlie Haveler, an of
ficial at U.S. Sports Development, which
has "taken care of the business side" of the
camps for the last 10 years, Stanford coach
es "do very well" financially through their
respective camps.
"The bigger camps are worth their

while," Haveler said. "It's important in
come to the coaches."
Loose sponsorship
More serious questions about the Universi
ty's integrity, however, arise through ex
amination of organizations that are al
lowed to not only convene on campus but
also use Stanford's name in advertising
their programs.
Every conference supervisor inter
viewed for this article, in fact, said that
events held at Stanford are attended as well
as or better than the same conference held
at any different locale. Linda Klein, the site
administrator for the motivational youth
conference Supercamp, said the Stanford
venue is the most popular among the
camp's several locations nationwide.
"There is a long waiting list [for the Stan
ford camp]," she said. "I'm sure it's because
of the name."
Several other camp administrators said
it is Stanford's "academic reputation" that
draws people to attend conferences here.
"It's a name university," said an official at
the United Spirit Association, which runs
an August cheerleading camp at Stanford.
Leynse said that organizations planning
to run conferences here "can't use [the Uni
versity's] name to imply that it is run by

Stanford. That's prohib
ited. That's always
guarded against." She
said that her office care
fully scrutinizes adver
tising literature for con
ferences for any sugges
tion of direct Stanford
participation.

But some conferences come fairly close.
Granville, the elected county clerk for Or
ange County, officially advertises his pro
gram as The Summer Training Institute
for California County Clerks at Stanford
University.
Another question involves the matter of
faculty sponsorship. Leynse said that the
Conference Office "requires that any group
holding a conference here have an academ
ic sponsor — a department or faculty mem
ber who sponsors the program. It has to be
consistent with our academic mission."
Yet that sponsorship process does not
appear to be strictly regulated; in fact, some
groups were not sure what department or
faculty member endorsed their conference.
Even groups that could cite a sponsor
had tenuous links to it. June Thompson, a
director at the California Association of
Student Councils, which held a conference
of 398 students here last week, said the ses
sion's sponsorship by the dean of Student
Affairs office amounted to little more than
initials on a letter requesting approval. "It
wasn't what I would call an active sponsor
ship," she said.
There is also some contention as to the
very validity of the department sponsor
ship of the State Farm Summer College.
Mike Hill, a representative for one of the
company's programs, said Tuesday that the
symposium this year is being sponsored by
the Risk Management Department.
But Bob Beth, director of the depart
ment, maintains that he gave the program
a two-year sponsorship five years ago, when
he lectured in and attended the conference.
Since that time, he said, State Farm had
moved their college to another site. When
interviewed yesterday, Beth said he "had
no idea" that the conference was returning
to Stanford.

"They may have found an
other sponsor," he said. Hill
could not be reached for re
sponse last night.
Summer in Cambridge
Not every institution of high
er learning taps into the reser
voirs of cash like Stanford
does. Harvard, for instance,
runs just seven sports camps,
as opposed to Stanford's 40.
Chris Queen, dean of Har
vard's Summer Session, said
the motivation behind the es
tablishment of summer in
struction at Harvard was simi
lar to Stanford's — "the notion
was that these programs were
a way of opening the libraries
and faculty to the community."
As is the case at Stanford,
approximately 5,000 students
attend summer classes at
Harvard, where enrollment is
open. Harvard's summer
academy for high school stu
dents, though, conducts a
more aggressive recruiting
campaign for its 1,000 spots,
10 times more spots than the
Stanford program has. About
500 Harvard undergraduates
stay at school in between
terms.
But aside from actual in
struction, little takes place in
the Yard during the summer
months. Queen said that
Summer Session students —
many of them from overseas
— fill 6 of the 12 undergradu
ate residences on campus.
Does Harvard also run
180 summer conferences?
"No, we don't do anything like
that," Queen said. "[The
number of conferences at
Harvard] is easily less that a
dozen. More like a half dozen.
"Harvard is not interested
in attracting conferences," he
said. Harvard has no Confer
ence Office. It also has no
cheerleading camp.
More than pretty girls
And what of, in the end,
cheerleading camp? CADA's
program, held this week, drew
283 eager girls from around
the Bay Area. The campers

came as entire high
school corps, with their
school names embla
zoned on the shirts they
wore to camp each day.
The camp's su
pervisors — Lynette
Hovlund, Will Dunn and

Diane Burbank (Stan
ford '84) — insisted that CADA is most con
cerned with fostering leadership and coop
eration skills that are often overlooked at
other cheerleading camps.
"They grow a lot here," Hovlund said.
"They come in with one mindset and leave
with another. By the time they leave, all of
them have learned a little bit about one an
other."
Indeed, on this bright Tuesday after
noon, the campers could be found not hurl
ing one another in the air — partly because
liability problems do not allow the camp to
teach such stunts — but instead, seated in
small groups on the Cowell Cluster lawns,
discussing questions about the non-cheer
leading world given to them in inflated bal
loons. ("Do you think the world will be a bet
ter or worse place in 100 years?" one of the
questions asked, as if each camper were one
of the five finalists in the Miss America
pageant.)
Later, the girls would receive techincal
training from nationally-certified instruc
tors and hold a costume party in Memorial
Auditorium. Campers pay $200 for three
days of such fun and games at Stanford, ac
cording to one cheerleader from Clayton
Valley High School.
Representatives from both non-profit
CADA and the for-profit United Spirit As
sociation said holding a program at Stan
ford costs them more than at any of their
other camp sites. Still, they proudly pro
claim their satisfaction with Stanford's fa
cilities and the support they receive from
the Athletic Department.
"Cheryl Levick has sponsored us for
many years," Dunn said. "She has been
kind enough to allow us to return year after
year."
But few at the athletic department seem
eager to affirm such a cordial relationship.
"We have absolutely nothing to do with
cheerleading camps," said Assoc. Athletic
Director Karen Bennett.
Levick clarifies that statement a bit, but
does not make any claims of endorsement
of the spirit schools. "We rent our fields to
them for a nominal fee," she said tersely.
Yet, like numerous other organizations
who mull about the campus during the
summer pouring cash into University pock
ets, the cheeleaders remain, using the
fields, eating the food and sleeping in the
beds once reserved for Stanford students.
And to hear them tell it, CADA instructors
believe their charges deserve to be here.
"We try to stress," Hovlund said, "that
cheerleaders are athletes. They aren't just
pretty girls in short skirts. They're ath
letes."
So young, so sassy
Perhaps. But whether they are contribut
ing to the intellectual discourse of this uni
versity is quite another question. While
working on this article, I went to watch one
of the cheerleaders' practice sessions on
Wilbur Field, hoping to ask some campers
for their perspectives on life at Stanford.
As the campers finished practice and
headed back to their Cowell Cluster dorms,
I approached one group bedecked head-to
toe in purple. One thirteenish girl said hello

and sprayed me in the face with her water
bottle.
"Are you in the cheerleading camp?" I
asked. She replied, she was.
"Could I ask you a few questions for a
newspaper article?"
She shook her head. "No," she said. "I'm
not allowed to talk to you."
Was she under specific instructions not
to talk to reporters? Had some gag order
been lowered over these young, bubbly
girls? I decided to ask. "Why not?"
She looked me in the eye earnestly. "Be
cause you've got cooties," she said laugh
ing, and walked away ■
