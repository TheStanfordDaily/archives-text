## SLAC gets a little plutonium 
### 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter received small quantities of plutonium
and neptunium on July 9 to be used in a set
of experiments investigating safer ways of
storing nuclear wastes.
A group of experts from Los Alamos Na
tional Laboratory arrived with the pluto
nium two weeks ago; the experiments
began last week and have not run into any
problems, according to SLAC Associate
Director Arthur Bienenstock. The experi
ments are being conducted at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at
SLAC, because it is one of the few places in
the world that is able to create the X-ray
beams needed.
The X-rays will be directed onto the plu
tonium and neptunium to provide detailed
information about their structure. Bienen
stock said he hoped the information will
aid in developing improved techniques to
separate these elements from each other in
nuclear wastes. Such a separation would
likely decrease the radioactivity in nuclear
wastes and make their storage safer.
"We are anxious to provide whatever
help we can offer in alleviating the serious
nuclear waste disposal problems of this
country," Bienenstock said.
While SLAC received less than a paper
clip's weight in plutonium, many tons are
in existence in nuclear weapons, many of
which will soon be decommissioned.
The plutonium was shipped by truck
from Los Alamos, N.M., and will be re

turned to Los Alamos upon the completion
of the experiments sometime next week.
There are no future experiments sched
uled that require hazardous materials.
However, Bienenstock said that the radia
tion laboratory will probably participate in
experiments dealing with a number of en
vironmental problems. Because SLAC has
facilities to examine polluted materials,
these types of experiments can be expected
to continue at Stanford.
A stringent set of safety precautions
will be followed while researchers handle
the plutonium and neptunium, Bienen
stock said. A detailed, comprehensive safe
ty plan, whose goal is to prevent any possi
ble release of radioactive material, has
been reviewed and approved at both labo
ratories by safety committees that includ
ed outside experts.
"Our safety review has convinced me
that with these precautions, this experi
ment poses no significant hazards for our
employees and the general public," Bi
enenstock said.
Funds to operate the laboratory at
SLAC came from the Department of Ener
gy, which also supports the Los Alamos
National Laboratory.
Earlier this year local environmental
ists expressed concern over the proposed
transport of the elements, although cur
rently no significant opposition has been
aroused.

Somewhere in the vast expanse of the Stanford Linear Acelerator center is an
amount of plutonium weighing less than a paper clip. Can you find it?
