# Gee, you crazy, nutty, wacky, zany, goofy band kids are great

On behalf of the organizers and
participants in this year's AIDS
Walk in San Francisco, which
raised more than $2.6 million on
Sunday, July 25, I would like to
thank the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band for vol
unteering their time to entertain
the walkers along the route in
Golden Gate Park.
From my observations as I
monitored one of the checkpoints,
the crowd really appreciated the
Band's performance and their
wild enthusiasm (not to mention
their fabulous fashion sense). I'm
sure the organizers, too, appreci-

ated their presence.
Thanks a million (or two)!
