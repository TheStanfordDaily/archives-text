# Letters Policy

### 
The Daily welcomes letters
from its readers. Letters will be
published at the editor's discre
tion and are subject to editing.
All letters must include the
author's name, phone num
ber and Stanford affiliation, if
any. Submissions with more
than five signatures must
designate a representative.
Letters should be turned
in on a Macintosh disk in Mi
crosoft Word format with a
paper copy of the submission.
Submissions are published
on a space-available basis at
the discretion of the Opinions
editors.
