# A 						tangled Webb
## Workers' housing still unfinished at Webb Ranch 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
There is something distinctly Cali
fornian about Webb Ranch. Half
of a mile beyond a produce stand,
which sells fruits and vegetables from the
ranch, a narrow and serene dirt road off
Alpine Road near Highway 280 winds up a
slope flanked by dry, golden grass. The
view from the top of the hill reveals an ex
panse of bucolic, green vegetable fields. It
is a place that seems a proper setting for a
Steinbeck novel.

Equally Californian, however, is the
dispute that rages beneath the ostensible
peace here — one that embroils land own
ers, labor unions, migrant workers, San
Mateo County management and Stanford
University.
It is a conflict for which no one wants to
take responsibility, bringing the most suf
fering to those who can afford it least.
Four years ago, the Webb Ranch own
ers, who have leased the ranch's 237 acres
from the University since 1922, agreed to
union demands that housing for workers'
families be improved. But the eight
homes, former Manzanita Park trailers,
donated by the University in 1990, are
still not ready to house the workers.
Two weeks ago, officials at Webb Ranch
pledged that the work on the trailers
would be completed by the end of this
month. That is four months later than the
original March deadline set by the United
Stanford Workers, the University's labor
union, for preparing the homes for resi
dence.
"We're real close here, and we're excited
about getting things done," Jack Webb, one
of the ranch*B co-owners, said. "We're all
working towards the same thing." Yet the
final health inspections required by San
Mateo County before the trailers are

deemed suitable for living have not even
been scheduled.
The U.S.W. has said it will file a formal
complaint with the National Labor Rela
tions Board if the trailers are not completed
by Aug. 1.
The Webbs attribute the delay to un
expected bureaucratic regulations for
housing improvement to and spiraling
costs.

"We didn't know how long it was going to
take — we were deluding ourselves [by set
ting the March deadline]," said Tom Hub
bard, Webb's brother-in-law. "There was a
misunderstanding as far as what has to be
done." Hubbard said that the family has
spent over $100,000 for the improvements,

far above the initial esti
mates of $35-40,000.
But few critics of
the Webbs are
sympathetic to
their claims of sacrifice.
"Pardon me if my heart
doesn't bleed too profuse
ly," said Political Science
Prof. John Manley, who,
along with Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga and
English Prof. Ron Reb
holz, has been a vocal ad
vocate for the workers.
"The Webbs have let [the
workers] live for decades
under conditions that by
civilized standards are
scandalous.
"Now they're crying
because they've put too
much money into work-

ers' housing?
That doesn't
muster a whole
lot of empathy,"
he said.
A representa
tive of the United
Stanford Work
ers who is close to
the situation, but
refused to be
named, said "the
whole thing is
like a chain of
events. Every
month we meet
with them, and
they come up
with more excus
es. This should
have been fin
ished a long, long

time ago." She added that the trailers had
been sitting untouched on Webb land for
two years, with no improvement efforts
made until February.
The issue of Webb housing condi
tions rose to public attention in
January, when U.S.W. representa
tives discovered that the eight families liv
ing at the ranch had gone for three months
without heat in their old, dilapidated trail
ers, often relying on tiny space heaters for
warmth. The Webbs deny that the housing
ever lacked heating.
The next month, San Mateo County or
dered the Webbs to evacuate the old trailers
and install the new ones immediately. The
families were moved into apartments in
Palo Alto and Redwood City.
Though the University pressured the
Webbs to begin work on the new trailers
after the stqry became public, Manley
sharply criticized the administration's de
cision to "wash its hands" of any attempts
to improve housing and working condi
tions on the ranch. "The indifference of
the officials of the University is ap
palling," he said.
In the summer edition of the Stanford
Observer, Manley gave University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper an "F" grade for his
handling of the Webb Ranch issue.
"Stanford says it's not our affair, that
it's up to the Webbs and the union to make
the situation better. That's a morally inde
fensible position for this university," Man
ley said. "It is our affair, and as long as
these conditions continue, Stanford will
continue to be embarrassed in the press,
and the problem won't go away."
On this count, at least, Jack Webb agrees
with Manley. "Everyone is trying to help
except financially," he said.
But as he continues, Webb expresses
anger at the constant scrutiny of his
ranch's practices and what he perceives as

meddling by Manley and his cohorts.
"We aren't trying to make things
hard. . .but they came here and tried to
stir things up. It doesn't help, it just
makes things worse," he said. "Who wants
to slow things down with a bunch of bull
shit? We don't want any bad publicity, any
bad shit — everyone just wants to get this
done."
Hubbard said that despite their com
plaints, neither the professors nor the work
ers' union has contributed physical assis
tance in completing the installation of the
new trailers. Manley denies that the Webbs
asked him to help and calls the Webbs' ar
gument a "red herring" intended to distract
attention from the family's negligence.
"The University should turn the ranch
over to other managers," he said. "The
Webbs have had their chance, and they've
blown it."
For the time being, though, the true
victims of the Webb Ranch quag
mire are its workers. Resting one
late afternoon outside the rickety barracks
where they are housed, the workers, most
ly itinerant Mexican immigrants, spoke
about the standard of living at the ranch.
One worker said that he is paid $5.35
per hour and wishes he could work eight
hours per day, one more than the ranch al
lows. "We are content to be working," he
said.
Augustin Gonzalez, who has worked at
the ranch for 24 years and was forced out of
his trailer with his family in February, said
he was promised a new home in March, but
still lives in Redwood City.
Did he believe the Webbs would com
plete the trailers by the deadline set for the
end of this month? "I don't believe any
thing anymore," he said.
"Ellos han hecho muchas mentiras" he
said. They have told us many lies.

spent over $100,000 for the improvements,

far above the initial esti
mates of $35-40,000.
But few critics of
the Webbs are
sympathetic to
their claims of sacrifice.
"Pardon me if my heart
doesn't bleed too profuse
ly," said Political Science
Prof. John Manley, who,
along with Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga and
English Prof. Ron Reb
holz, has been a vocal ad
vocate for the workers.
"The Webbs have let [the
workers] live for decades
under conditions that by
civilized standards are
scandalous.
"Now they're crying
because they've put too
much money into work-

ers' housing?
That doesn't
muster a whole
lot of empathy,"
he said.
A representa
tive of the United
Stanford Work
ers who is close to
the situation, but
refused to be
named, said "the
whole thing is
like a chain of
events. Every
month we meet
with them, and
they come up
with more excus
es. This should
have been fin
ished a long, long

time ago." She added that the trailers had
been sitting untouched on Webb land for
two years, with no improvement efforts
made until February.
The issue of Webb housing condi
tions rose to public attention in
January, when U.S.W. representa
tives discovered that the eight families liv
ing at the ranch had gone for three months
without heat in their old, dilapidated trail
ers, often relying on tiny space heaters for
warmth. The Webbs deny that the housing
ever lacked heating.
The next month, San Mateo County or
dered the Webbs to evacuate the old trailers
and install the new ones immediately. The
families were moved into apartments in
Palo Alto and Redwood City.
Though the University pressured the
Webbs to begin work on the new trailers
after the stqry became public, Manley
sharply criticized the administration's de
cision to "wash its hands" of any attempts
to improve housing and working condi
tions on the ranch. "The indifference of
the officials of the University is ap
palling," he said.
In the summer edition of the Stanford
Observer, Manley gave University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper an "F" grade for his
handling of the Webb Ranch issue.
"Stanford says it's not our affair, that
it's up to the Webbs and the union to make
the situation better. That's a morally inde
fensible position for this university," Man
ley said. "It is our affair, and as long as
these conditions continue, Stanford will
continue to be embarrassed in the press,
and the problem won't go away."
On this count, at least, Jack Webb agrees
with Manley. "Everyone is trying to help
except financially," he said.
But as he continues, Webb expresses
anger at the constant scrutiny of his
ranch's practices and what he perceives as

meddling by Manley and his cohorts.
"We aren't trying to make things
hard. . .but they came here and tried to
stir things up. It doesn't help, it just
makes things worse," he said. "Who wants
to slow things down with a bunch of bull
shit? We don't want any bad publicity, any
bad shit — everyone just wants to get this
done."
Hubbard said that despite their com
plaints, neither the professors nor the work
ers' union has contributed physical assis
tance in completing the installation of the
new trailers. Manley denies that the Webbs
asked him to help and calls the Webbs' ar
gument a "red herring" intended to distract
attention from the family's negligence.
"The University should turn the ranch
over to other managers," he said. "The
Webbs have had their chance, and they've
blown it."
For the time being, though, the true
victims of the Webb Ranch quag
mire are its workers. Resting one
late afternoon outside the rickety barracks
where they are housed, the workers, most
ly itinerant Mexican immigrants, spoke
about the standard of living at the ranch.
One worker said that he is paid $5.35
per hour and wishes he could work eight
hours per day, one more than the ranch al
lows. "We are content to be working," he
said.
Augustin Gonzalez, who has worked at
the ranch for 24 years and was forced out of
his trailer with his family in February, said
he was promised a new home in March, but
still lives in Redwood City.
Did he believe the Webbs would com
plete the trailers by the deadline set for the
end of this month? "I don't believe any
thing anymore," he said.
"Ellos han hecho muchas mentiras" he
said. They have told us many lies.

There is something distinctly Cali
fornian about Webb Ranch. Half
of a mile beyond a produce stand,
which sells fruits and vegetables from the
ranch, a narrow and serene dirt road off
Alpine Road near Highway 280 winds up a
slope flanked by dry, golden grass. The
view from the top of the hill reveals an ex
panse of bucolic, green vegetable fields. It
is a place that seems a proper setting for a
Steinbeck novel.

Equally Californian, however, is the
dispute that rages beneath the ostensible
peace here — one that embroils land own
ers, labor unions, migrant workers, San
Mateo County management and Stanford
University.
It is a conflict for which no one wants to
take responsibility, bringing the most suf
fering to those who can afford it least.
Four years ago, the Webb Ranch own
ers, who have leased the ranch's 237 acres
from the University since 1922, agreed to
union demands that housing for workers'
families be improved. But the eight
homes, former Manzanita Park trailers,
donated by the University in 1990, are
still not ready to house the workers.
Two weeks ago, officials at Webb Ranch
pledged that the work on the trailers
would be completed by the end of this
month. That is four months later than the
original March deadline set by the United
Stanford Workers, the University's labor
union, for preparing the homes for resi
dence.
"We're real close here, and we're excited
about getting things done," Jack Webb, one
of the ranch*B co-owners, said. "We're all
working towards the same thing." Yet the
final health inspections required by San
Mateo County before the trailers are

deemed suitable for living have not even
been scheduled.
The U.S.W. has said it will file a formal
complaint with the National Labor Rela
tions Board if the trailers are not completed
by Aug. 1.
The Webbs attribute the delay to un
expected bureaucratic regulations for
housing improvement to and spiraling
costs.

"We didn't know how long it was going to
take — we were deluding ourselves [by set
ting the March deadline]," said Tom Hub
bard, Webb's brother-in-law. "There was a
misunderstanding as far as what has to be
done." Hubbard said that the family has
spent over $100,000 for the improvements,
