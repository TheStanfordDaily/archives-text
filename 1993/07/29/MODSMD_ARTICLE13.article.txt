# 'HISTORY IS GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THEM AS BIGOTS.'
## A 						Conversation With: Zoe Dunning 
### 
Stanford Business School graduate Zoe
Dunning, a lieutenant in the Naval
Reserves and one of the most vocal op
ponents to Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell,
don't pursue" policy, has already told —
and without being asked. She is about to
pursue a federal court action challenging
her pending discharge.
Dunning joined the Navy 12 years ago.
Her mother had been a first lieutenant dur
ing World War 11, and she said that she and
her sisters loved the exciting stories their
mother used to tell them about the war. She
was 17 when she received the appointment
for the Naval Academy.
Two or three years ago, Dunning said
she first realized she was a lesbian, but hid
her sexuality from the Navy."Every time
you have to lie or hide something, a little
part of you dies," she said.
She decided to come out of the closet at a
rally, four days before Clinton's inaugura
tion. She said she came out publicly to per
sonalize the issue of gays in the military
and to make people aware of the "fact that
there were lesbians affected by this issue as
well," she said.
Stanford Weekly staff writer Alina
Bassegoda spoke with Dunning about Clin
ton's new policy, and about her immediate
future.
SW: If you had known all of this was going
to happen, would you have acted otherwise?
Dunning: No. I have no regrets. Part of it
was in the hopes that Clinton would fulfill
his campaign pledge, but a lot of it was just
on principle. I felt like a small part of me
was dying every time I had to go in there
one weekend a month and play straight—
you know, flirt with the guys and make
them feel good.
I had a really good career going for me. I
had been awarded a Navy commendation
medal, and the Navy was willing to pay for
my post-graduate education. I had gotten
promoted either on time or ahead of time
throughout my career. But it had gotten to
the point where I had gotten tired of it. You
know, I had been in for 12 years, so I don't
have any regrets.
I feel like I did the right thing. I don't
feel that Clinton did the right thing, but I
feel like I did the right thing. I think I'll go
down on the history books as having done
the right thing. I think people like Sam
Nunn will go down in the history books
and be looked upon in the same way that
the George Wallaces are looked upon for
having stood on the steps of southern uni
versities and having prevented desegrega
tion. 1 think it's the same type of thing. I
think people are going to really regret
what they're saying now, because history
is going to look back on them as bigots.
SW: Why is it so important for you to stay in
the militaryl
Dunning: I want to make it a career. It's
very much a part of my life, it's who I am.
The Navy was my family in a sense; you
work with the same people, you live with
the same people. I was on board the aircraft
carrier for three years. When I came out I
risked being disowned by that family, and
they are trying to disown me as a result.
I still love the Navy for the same reasons
before I came out. Well, you could think,
"You must hate the Navy, that's why
you're doing this." It's the exact opposite. I
feel like I'm doing what I'm doing because
I want to make it stronger. I think this
whole ban will make the military stronger.
You can't hide your problems in the closet
and pretend they're not there, you have to
deal with them. It's kind of like when
you're weight training, and you have to
break the muscles down a little bit before
you can build them back up so you're

stronger than you were to begin with. And
I think that's kind of what this issue is.
There's going to be some pain. There are
going to be some growing pains and agony.
It's going to break down for a little bit, but
it's going to rebuild to be even stronger
than it was to start.
SW: Even if you were to return, wouldn't it
be too difficult for you to face all the opposi
tion inside the Navy ?
Dunning: I probably won't get the prime
assignments anymore. I could pretty
much control my fitness reports and
things that they have to document. If they
knock me down too much below the good
grades I have now, they'd have to docu
ment why they were doing it. That I can
pretty much control. But your job assign
ments are much more discretionary and
much more subjective. I probably expect
that my career will be hurt because I
would probably be given worse assign
ments careerwise.
But, surprisingly, people in my unit have

been very very positive. And when I came
back to work I expected a lot of negative
comments, or people refusing maybe to
work with me or I don't know what. All
these things that Sam Nunn thinks are
going to happen when you tell — it was
quite the opposite. My unit was very wel
coming. Many of them testified at my hear
ing. Several wrote declarations saying not
only do they not mind having me in the
unit, but the two months that I was sus
pended, the morale of the unit went down.
Because they were all kind of worried what
was going to happen to me. They felt like I
brought something to the unit that was
missing in my absence.
Sw These must have been very hard
months for you. What's the trade-off?
Dunning: I feel sort of empowered —
being able to talk to the media, do public
speaking engagements, do education. I feel
like I can make a difference. I believe that if
you're not part of the solution, you're part
of the problem. I feel like I'm part of the so

lution, so I can sleep better at night.
Also, I've had an incredible opportunity
to really meet a lot of incredible individu
als, both gay and straight. I've been able to
speak at a variety of different dinners and
things for gay organizations. I've got to
participate in a video project that was dis
tributed throughout Capitol Hill — sort of
a video of testimonials of gay and lesbian
veterans. It's been sort of a self-discovery;
my self-confidence built up through all of
it.
Sw When do you expect to be discharged ?
Dunning: It's unclear right now. The pol
icy that Clinton set forward is supposed to
take effect Oct. 1. It's unclear what the
policy is between now and then. Are we
continuing under the six-month interim
policy? If so, then my case would go clear
up the chain of command to Janet Reno's
desk. So right now, I've had my hearing,
they recommended separation, and it's
kind of going through the approval
processes . . . Then it goes to Janet Reno's
desk, and she is supposed to, as attorney
general, decide whether or not to put me
into the individual ready reserve, stand-by
reserve — which is a category where
you're technically still in the service, but
you're really only on a list, and you don't
get paid, and you don't wear a uniform. So
it's the same as being discharged; it's just
that if there's a war we can recall you so
you can stop bullets with your body.
Right now it looks like she is sitting- ori
those; she is not processing them. If they
continue that policy, I'll probably just con
tinue to serve until Oct. 1. After that, when
the new policy is implemented, it's proba
bly just a matter of time until all the paper
work goes through, and I am discharged.
Sw What would be the ideal scenario for
the future ?
Dunning: Well, the ideal scenario would
be that my case or another — it doesn't
even have to be my case; I'm not in this for
my case to be the one that breaks it — helps
to eventually get through . . .to the
Supreme Court, and there will be a ruling
once and for all that this policy is unconsti
tutional, that the military is prohibited
from discriminating on any grounds
against gays and lesbians.
Now with my particular case, we haven't
filed suit yet, so I don't know any exact de
tails. But it seems to me that the grounds
we're going to base it on is, number one,
freedom of speech arguments, freedom of
speech infringements, First Amendment,
and secondly, the Fifth Amendment, equal
protection clause.
That one's a little tricky because the
courts haven't always recognized sexual
orientation to be a protected class of peo
ple. So we're going to be claiming equal
protection for sexual orientation, but
we're also going to be arguing equal pro
tection on the basis of gender. No one's
ever argued this before, but statistically a
woman in the service is three times more
likely to be discharged for homosexuality
than a man. And that is set in stone. . . .
You can show with those numbers this
policy has a disparate impact on women
— a woman is three times more likely to
be discharged, eight times more likely in
the Marine Corps. So what we're going to
say is this policy affects women, all
women, whether lesbian or straight, and
therefore, it's discriminatory and uncon
stitutional.
And with Ruth Ginsburg potentially
taking a seat on the Supreme Court, some
one who's very supportive of women's
rights,... we may have a very good chance
if my case does get to the Supreme Court.
So we'll see.
