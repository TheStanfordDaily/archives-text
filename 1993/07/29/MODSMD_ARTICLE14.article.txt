# Stanford 2000 A blueprint for the future
## 
### John MacKenzie Jim Morris 
The 21st century is only seven years
away.
Students might not levitate through the
Quad, but they will be able to enter the Geol
ogy Corner because the earthquake damage
will finally be repaired. In other construction
work, foreign dignitaries will not encounter
a single pothole as they drive down Palm
Drive in their limousines.
Although books will still be around, they
will be used less and less as they are read over
the network- Written e-mail messages will be
yesterday's technology, with students chat
ting through fiber-optic cables via live video.
But Stanford wannabes currently in fifth
grade should start saving now, because tu
ition will total around $28,000 per year.
Sweeping changes are underway
throughout all aspects of campus life in the
University as the 21st century nears. But
not all the changes will come from within, as

the dawning of a new international
ethos promises to make the Stanford
experience in the next millennium a
truly global one. And ultimately, the
future health of the University will
depend on the success or failure of the
American government.
In the following nine areas of the
University, prominent administra
tors outline their visions of Stanford
2000:
Academics
Instruction through osmosis? Pro
fessors replaced by multimedia com
puters? A mtuor in synthetic basket
weaving? Maybe not.
Still, any speculation on the future
of Stanford academics is tenuous
until the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education gets underway.
"I don't expect the nature of Stan
ford academics to be radically
changed," said History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"Stanford presents undergraduates with
the opportunity to learn in class, engage in
research with faculty and to partake in
structured public service.
"It is a liberal education that Stanford
graduates have put to great use and is the
hallmark of a Stanford education."
Camarillo suggested that the commission
should be concerned with the "personaliza
tion of a Stanford education.
"I would strive to make classes much
more interactive, closer," he said.
University President Gerhard Casper's
idea for a 3-year undergraduate program will
be under consideration by the committee.
According to Camarillo, "The 3-year plan
question is a fair question, but I think the big
question is what are our goals and objectives
of providing an undergraduate education.
Even if the length of a Stanford education
does not change, the student interest in cer
tain msyors seems to be changing.
"There is no clear pattern," said Camaril
lo, in terms of what majors students will be
interested in seven years.
But "international relations would be a
msyor that I believe will continue to grow due
to world affairs. Virtually all the world has
become international."
In addition, Camarillo noted that inter
disciplinary studies is "clearly a trend." Cur
rently, 20 percent of humanities and sci
ences students are in interdisciplinary fields.
Lorie Langdon, student services officer
for the Department of Biological Sciences,
said there has

been a "dramat
ic increase" in
the number of
students major
ing in biology —
from 239 in
1991-92 to 304
this year.
The number
completing hon
ors projects has
also increased
from approxi
mately 60 last
year to 70 in
1992-93.
Athletics
Will Bill Walsh
still be wearing
the red and
white in 2000?
"Hopefully, he'll
still be here,"
said Athletic Di
rector Ted Le
land. "I hope he
stays as long as
he has a good
time."
He added

that when a good program is created, it usu
ally continues, citing the San Francisco
49ers' post-Walsh success.
But Walsh is just the start of Leland's
wishes for the future. In the next seven
years, the Department of Athletics will try to
raise enough money to completely overhaul
the 72-year-old Stanford Stadium.
As soon as this fall, a partially renovated
Stanford Stadium with new aluminum
benches and a new press box could await re
turning Stanford students. These changes
will be funded by World Cup '94, the group
bringing some matches of the quadrennial
soccer tourney to The Farm next year.
Later, improved rest rooms, an expanded
walkway and new concession stands will re
place the presently aging facilities, said
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett.
The money for this and other Athletic De
partment goals will be raised in what the de-

partment is calling Campaign 2000.
The current donations goal of $5 million a
year will be doubled to $10 million to also add
three new women's varsity sports —
lacrosse, water polo and synchronized swim
ming — and 29 new endowed women's schol
arships.
Other goals include adding a softball field,
lights for Sunken Diamond and the golf dri
ving range, as well as another hole at the
Stanford Golf Course to replace one that
could be lost to future construction.
Another way Leland said he expected
Stanford athletics to improve over the next
several years is in the area of recruiting.
"Since Prop. 48 will get tougher in 1994,
Stanford stands to gain an edge over other
universities," Leland said. Proposition 48 is
a National Collegiate Athletic Association
amendment that restricts the type of stu
dents universities can recruit into their
sports programs.
Presently, any prospective student-ath
lete must have 12 semester units of high
school academics that average out to a "C"
and manage a minimum combined score of
700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
"Since Stanford has higher admittance
standards regardless of athletic talent, we
cannot pull from [the less academically tal
ented] pool of athletes anyway" — so Stan
ford will not be hurt by the tightening re
strictions, said Leland.
Leland added that Proposition 48 has al
ready "eliminated about 15 percent of our
opponents' talent pool" and that the tougher

requirements in 1994 will reduce the pool
another 15 percent.
The change will improve Stanford's
chances on the national level of sports, be
cause other schools with less stringent stan
dards of admission will be required to reject
those who cannot meet the new rule.
Rivalries will still be strong and encour
aged in the year 2000, according to Beckett
— "I would like to see others in the confer
ence match the rivalry of the Big Game. It
heightens the intensity of competition."
Problems in the future, Leland noted,
could be with the concept of amateurism and
the Olympic Committee's decision to give

stipends to successful athletes.
Social
Will Stanford still be a wet campus in
the year 2000? "I don't think we'll be
come a dry campus," said Heather
Dunn, program coordinator in the Of
fice of Student Activities.
By then, she said it "will be more in
tune with the student drinking cul
ture." She added that though the
Greek system probably will maintain
the status quo, sororities might have
their own residences by the year 2000.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see women
in houses," Dunn said. "It's certainly a
potential for the future."
A trend she has noticed and thinks
will continue into the future is the cre
ation of very specific student organiza
tions.
Some are formed for religious pur
poses, community service or "issue
oriented" campus groups
As for future planning, the Office of
Student Activities relies on "student
self-determination, current interests
and student contact" to evaluate fu
ture goals.
. "It's up to student initiative to
shape how our office will make an im
pact" in the future of Stanford, said
Dunn.
Similar to What the Office of Stu
dent Activities stated, Diana Conklin,
co-director of Residential Education,
doesn't specify definite long-range
plans, but emphasizes flexibility as the
students and other factors change.
"External influences such as the ef
fects of a three-year degree and the
changing national economy can have a
big impact on how we do what we do,"
Conklin said.
She added, "I finished my college
degree in less than three years, and
most of my time, including summers,
was spent on academics."
The proposed shift toward a three
year degree option would significantly
change the Stanford experience, thus
altering "the way we accomplish what
we accomplish" in residential educa
tion, said Conklin.
A constricted economy could force
students into the workplace to earn
money for tuition instead of pursuing
other interests.
More time spent away from extra-

curricrular activities could affect the
way Residential Education allocates res
idence staff and money for programming in
the dorms, she said.
Computer systems
Jeff Merriman, director of residential com
puting, is concerned that seven years from
now, computer technology will have ad
vanced so much as to leave some students
holed up in their dorm rooms all year.
With networking capabilities extending
throughout campus and the possibility by
the year 2000 of live video transmission over
computer networks, Merriman wonders,
"Will students leave their rooms? Will they
interact with faculty?"
With the ever-changing technology, these
decisions will be in the hands of the students
if Merriman's visions come true.
He said he sees fiberoptic networking — a
system 10 times faster than what presently
exists in dorms — as being available to all

students in their rooms by the year 2000.
The "backbone of the University" is al
ready wired for fiber optics, but the com
mensurate in-room connecting devices are
too expensive at the moment.
A computer with every student — well,
eveiy student with a computer — is a possi
bility Merriman foresees, as does Marick
Payton, director of the Network for Student
Information.
However, Payton envisions students log
ging onto Axess from portable computers
"like the Apple [Computer] Newton" over
radio modems.
When asked about the possibility of radio

or infrared modems being used by students,
Merriman was cautious, saying that type of
networking may be too slow for the comput
er users of the future.
The world of computers is "moving in two
divergent paths" — both toward computers
with bigger screens for more complex oper
ating systems, like the Next Inc. machines
and faster fiberoptic networking and, on the
other hand, toward more travel-friendly
portable computers.
What will the computer cluster of the year
2000 look like? Merriman explained that
since a very high percentage of students will
own their own computers by that time, the
clusters will "provide high-end peripheral
resources that will add value to the typical
student's computer."
For example, next year, all non-Row
house clusters will include CD-ROM drives.
Clusters of the future might also include

color scanners, color laser printers, Silicon
Graphics Inc. multimedia work stations and
other goodies.
The in-room connection process, which
does not require student modems, is slated
to be finished by 1998, signifying a change in
how all students will be able to conduct their
business.
Payton talks about students using com
puters to do business with the Bursar's Of
fice, the housing Draw and for financial ser
vices as well as for registration.
When asked if security was a big problem,
as the power of student-owned computers
increases, he replied that since Axess and all

of the information on grades are on a main
frame computer, its unfamilianty to hackers
and its custom operating system make it
"relatively easy to maintain a high level of
security."
Budget and tuition
A four-fold specter looms over Stanford's fi
nancial future.
Administrators say they are concerned
that income from research, tuition, the en
dowment and gifts will not be as strong as it
was in the '80s.
But changes in the labor market may help
ofiset these dwindling resources as the Uni
versity continues to tighten its belt.
According to Peter Van Etten, chief fi
nancial ofTicer, "A number of trends start
ed over the last two years, increasing and
maybe intensifying over the next several
years, lead us to be concerned regarding the

rate of increase in our revenues."
Of all the factors in question, research
funds contribute the largest proportion of
the budget — $500 million for this year, of
which 80 percent comes from the federal
government.
However, the government is reassessing
its priorities in terms of research spending
in the National Institutes of Health, De
fense Department and Department of En
ergy.
Although Van Etten noted that while
the University has not seen those changes
thus far, on the indirect-cost side of re
search Stanford just took a $25-million re-

duction and new regulations will
further reduce that payment by
"possibly $3 million or more de
pending on how the regulations are
interpreted."
Tuition also has limited potential
for increased revenues.
Of the $220 million that students
are billed for tuition, only $150-160
million is received by Stanford. The
difference is paid by the University
for financial aid.
Another factor reducing tuition
income is the Board of Trustees' de
sire to tame the rising cost of educa
tion.
"The trustees believe that Stan
ford cannot continue to raise tu
ition at 4-5 percent in real terms,"
said Van Etten.
But the indirect-cost crisis negat
ed the 1-2 percent increase policy
created by the trustees three years
ago.
Moreover, the endowment is an
area of budgetary concern. Stanford
is taking more money out to make
ends meet and getting less interest
income than in the 1980s.
In previous years, Stanford took
out only 4.75 percent of the merged
endowment, but under the Deficit
Financing Plan, the trustees ap
proved a 6.75 percent pay-out rate
for 1992-93 and 1993-94.
"We cannot expect to see the re
turns we saw in the '80s of 16 per
cent," said Van Etten. "The '90s
will not see as much growth."
A reduction in gifts is also project
ed. Even though gifts are quite
strong, totalling over $185 million
this year, Van Etten said, "The con
cern is that in the future it will be
harder to hold that number."
Fund raising "is getting particu
larly difficult given that we are
quite dependent on California for a
significant amount of our gifts. The
downturn in the California econo
my is bound to cause problems."
One area of the budget projected
to cost the University less than be
fore is faculty and staff salaries.
Van Etten said that until recently,
staff salaries have increased at
rates greater than inflation, but
that lower rates of salary increases
would translate into a slower rise in
the cost of education.

Careers
Many jobs of the year 2000 have not even
been invented yet, according to Ruth
Schneider, director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center.
But students will have to work harder to
get these new jobs.
In the area of technology and informa
tion systems, she said, "We are just running
to catch up.
"If you look at a dictionary of occupa
tional titles, it's amazing how many new job
titles emerge."
She believes students will have to spend
more time thinking and planning about
jobs, and she suggests that, "It will be in
creasingly important to take advantage of
internships and work experience."
"Right now it is amazing how many
firms look to students with previous experi
ence within the company," she said. "This

has become more and more significant over
the past 10 years.
"There are some employers that almost
never hire without previous experience."
Schneider said Stanford students must
be competitive in order to get future jobs.
"Our students will always be competitive;
however, students cannot sit and wait for
people to come to them."
Students will continue to see career op
portunities in the health services, small
businesses, management consulting and
technology and information sys-

tems.
"Health care fields are big, due in
part to the aging population," said
Schneider.
Schneider said that in the past
students thought more about work
ing for Fortune 500 companies.
"This is no longer true," she said.
More opportunities exist in small
businesses.
In addition, jobs entailing con
tractual work continue to be espe
cially hot.
Students in consulting jobs may
be contracted by many different
companies within a short amount of
time. Management consulting firms
are hired to solve a specific problem
within an organization.
The trend toward hiring consul
tants is growing because the area "is
cost-effective in the long run," said
Schneider.
"When a company brings in an
expert, they do not have to have long
term commitments."

International students and faculty
As the world turns, so does the composition
of international students on campus.
"Changes in world economics, not just in
ability of the students to pay," influence the
international student makeup, said John
Pearson, director of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Pearson anticipates a slight rise in Euro
pean students, suspecting little impact
from intra-European exchange programs
emerging from European unification.
Additionally, Pearson said he does not
expect an increase in the number of stu
dents from the former Soviet Union, citing
their unstable economies as a factor.
Moreover, Pearson predicts a slow de
crease in sub-Sahara African students, be
cause "the African students are not as pre
pared."
Expect more students to come from Pa
cific Rim countries.
An exceptional increase in the number of
students from China emerged during the
'80s. In 1980 there were two students from
China on campus. Now China represents
the largest number of students from any
single country, 233.
Pearson also pointed to the "tremen
dous number" of foreign-born faculty, all
the way up to German-born University
President Gerhard Casper.
Overseas studies
A map of overseas campuses in 1980 would
have the majority of Stanford flags in Eu
rope. That map in 2000 is more likely to have
flags spread evenly throughout the globe.
Begun in 1958, Overseas Studies opened
up a set of campuses that have flourished in
Western Europe.
In recent years, Overseas Studies ex
panded to Kyoto, Japan and Santiago, Chile
— as well as a new program in Moscow,
which starts this fall.
"All logic speaks to enriching the At
lanticist orientation of Overseas Studies
with a strong East Asia commitment," ac
cording to Russell Berman, director of
Overseas Studies.
Berman said the overseas studies pro
gram has to be expanded in light of the
enormous number of changes that have ex
pired due to the end of the Cold War, but
above all, because of "our growing interac
tion with other parts of the world, notably
Latin America, East Asia and Africa."
"We should not see this choice as a zero
sum game, by where we would have to give
up something in Europe in order to expand
elsewhere.
"The point for overseas studies is that
the intellectual opportunities that West
Europe offers have to be continued."
In the year 2000, Berman envisions "a
flourishing program in China and perhaps
a string of programs in parts of East and
Southern Asia "
Overseas Studies is building a program
in Latin America around the core in Santi
ago. "I hope long before the year 2000 we
will have some other location in the Ameri
cas," Berman said.
"Whether that will be in Latin America

proper or in the Caribbean is a matter of in
tellectual opportunity, faculty interest, stu
dent interest and the lands of organization
al and logistical issues that my office has to
deal with."
Additionally, Berman said, "it is high
time that we think of developing a strong
program in African Studies."
When asked if more students were
choosing to study overseas, Berman said,
"Our program in Oxford is always oversub
scribed. Kyoto is attractive. And Santiago is

extremely attractive and oversubscribed."
"I could imagine that the program in
Santiago could become the most popular,"
he said. "There is, of course an ongoing in
terest for Berlin, Florence and Paris. So the
student interest is there."
However, the Overseas Studies program
took a very hard hit in the budget cuts that
led to a reduction in capacity.
"Every budget cut means fewer students
going abroad and a grave loss, I think, to the
claim of Stanford to provide international
dimension to overseas education," he said.
"Because University President Casper
has repeatedly talked about the importance
of encountering another culture, I am
hopeful that in the year 2000 the overseas
program will not only continue, but will
have expanded beyond its current scope.
"Expanded in sites, expanded in charac
ter of program and expanded so that other
sorts of University activities may work
through the overseas studies program."
Such activities would include graduate edu
cation and faculty research, for example.
Libraries and information resources
Books may not become a thing of the past,
but Stanford libraries are in the midst of "a
mayor revolution in the way information is
stored and disseminated," says Rick
Biedenweg, assistant provost of Libraries
and Information Resources.
He said the trend to computerize is dri
ven by the need to communicate scholarly
information. "Today, virtually all the Stan
ford holdings are on an online catalogue."
But big questions remain unanswered,
especially in regards to who will have access
and who will have ownership to online in
formation.
The next step is to store source informa
tion, instead of just bibliography informa
tion.
According to Biedenweg, a person who is
looking for a journal article wants an arti
cle. They do not want all the articles in the
journal.
"What is going to happen when more
and more things are online, and more and
more journals are available through a sin
gle location at one place?" he asked.
"Maybe computer science is available at
Fremont, Nebraska, physics is available at
Stanford, and materials science available at
Cal Tech.
"However, you still have the need for
unique, rare material," he added. "That
may be how libraries differentiate them
selves. You will have access instead of own
ership to common materials."
Biedenweg said the vision is for a new
model:
"When a faculty member submits an ar
ticle to a journal, the journal is sent out to
four faculty members online for review. If
the article is approved, then the article is
posted by the publisher to a bulletin board
Now, from any terminal in the U.S. any
person can access that article."
Biedenweg remained optimistic that
there would not be costs placed on students
to browse through online information.
"The publishers are scared to death," he
said. "They are worried that their profit
margins are going to go away."

More time spent away from extra-

curricrular activities could affect the
way Residential Education allocates res
idence staff and money for programming in
the dorms, she said.
Computer systems
Jeff Merriman, director of residential com
puting, is concerned that seven years from
now, computer technology will have ad
vanced so much as to leave some students
holed up in their dorm rooms all year.
With networking capabilities extending
throughout campus and the possibility by
the year 2000 of live video transmission over
computer networks, Merriman wonders,
"Will students leave their rooms? Will they
interact with faculty?"
With the ever-changing technology, these
decisions will be in the hands of the students
if Merriman's visions come true.
He said he sees fiberoptic networking — a
system 10 times faster than what presently
exists in dorms — as being available to all

students in their rooms by the year 2000.
The "backbone of the University" is al
ready wired for fiber optics, but the com
mensurate in-room connecting devices are
too expensive at the moment.
A computer with every student — well,
eveiy student with a computer — is a possi
bility Merriman foresees, as does Marick
Payton, director of the Network for Student
Information.
However, Payton envisions students log
ging onto Axess from portable computers
"like the Apple [Computer] Newton" over
radio modems.
When asked about the possibility of radio

or infrared modems being used by students,
Merriman was cautious, saying that type of
networking may be too slow for the comput
er users of the future.
The world of computers is "moving in two
divergent paths" — both toward computers
with bigger screens for more complex oper
ating systems, like the Next Inc. machines
and faster fiberoptic networking and, on the
other hand, toward more travel-friendly
portable computers.
What will the computer cluster of the year
2000 look like? Merriman explained that
since a very high percentage of students will
own their own computers by that time, the
clusters will "provide high-end peripheral
resources that will add value to the typical
student's computer."
For example, next year, all non-Row
house clusters will include CD-ROM drives.
Clusters of the future might also include

color scanners, color laser printers, Silicon
Graphics Inc. multimedia work stations and
other goodies.
The in-room connection process, which
does not require student modems, is slated
to be finished by 1998, signifying a change in
how all students will be able to conduct their
business.
Payton talks about students using com
puters to do business with the Bursar's Of
fice, the housing Draw and for financial ser
vices as well as for registration.
When asked if security was a big problem,
as the power of student-owned computers
increases, he replied that since Axess and all

of the information on grades are on a main
frame computer, its unfamilianty to hackers
and its custom operating system make it
"relatively easy to maintain a high level of
security."
Budget and tuition
A four-fold specter looms over Stanford's fi
nancial future.
Administrators say they are concerned
that income from research, tuition, the en
dowment and gifts will not be as strong as it
was in the '80s.
But changes in the labor market may help
ofiset these dwindling resources as the Uni
versity continues to tighten its belt.
According to Peter Van Etten, chief fi
nancial ofTicer, "A number of trends start
ed over the last two years, increasing and
maybe intensifying over the next several
years, lead us to be concerned regarding the

rate of increase in our revenues."
Of all the factors in question, research
funds contribute the largest proportion of
the budget — $500 million for this year, of
which 80 percent comes from the federal
government.
However, the government is reassessing
its priorities in terms of research spending
in the National Institutes of Health, De
fense Department and Department of En
ergy.
Although Van Etten noted that while
the University has not seen those changes
thus far, on the indirect-cost side of re
search Stanford just took a $25-million re-

duction and new regulations will
further reduce that payment by
"possibly $3 million or more de
pending on how the regulations are
interpreted."
Tuition also has limited potential
for increased revenues.
Of the $220 million that students
are billed for tuition, only $150-160
million is received by Stanford. The
difference is paid by the University
for financial aid.
Another factor reducing tuition
income is the Board of Trustees' de
sire to tame the rising cost of educa
tion.
"The trustees believe that Stan
ford cannot continue to raise tu
ition at 4-5 percent in real terms,"
said Van Etten.
But the indirect-cost crisis negat
ed the 1-2 percent increase policy
created by the trustees three years
ago.
Moreover, the endowment is an
area of budgetary concern. Stanford
is taking more money out to make
ends meet and getting less interest
income than in the 1980s.
In previous years, Stanford took
out only 4.75 percent of the merged
endowment, but under the Deficit
Financing Plan, the trustees ap
proved a 6.75 percent pay-out rate
for 1992-93 and 1993-94.
"We cannot expect to see the re
turns we saw in the '80s of 16 per
cent," said Van Etten. "The '90s
will not see as much growth."
A reduction in gifts is also project
ed. Even though gifts are quite
strong, totalling over $185 million
this year, Van Etten said, "The con
cern is that in the future it will be
harder to hold that number."
Fund raising "is getting particu
larly difficult given that we are
quite dependent on California for a
significant amount of our gifts. The
downturn in the California econo
my is bound to cause problems."
One area of the budget projected
to cost the University less than be
fore is faculty and staff salaries.
Van Etten said that until recently,
staff salaries have increased at
rates greater than inflation, but
that lower rates of salary increases
would translate into a slower rise in
the cost of education.

Careers
Many jobs of the year 2000 have not even
been invented yet, according to Ruth
Schneider, director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center.
But students will have to work harder to
get these new jobs.
In the area of technology and informa
tion systems, she said, "We are just running
to catch up.
"If you look at a dictionary of occupa
tional titles, it's amazing how many new job
titles emerge."
She believes students will have to spend
more time thinking and planning about
jobs, and she suggests that, "It will be in
creasingly important to take advantage of
internships and work experience."
"Right now it is amazing how many
firms look to students with previous experi
ence within the company," she said. "This

has become more and more significant over
the past 10 years.
"There are some employers that almost
never hire without previous experience."
Schneider said Stanford students must
be competitive in order to get future jobs.
"Our students will always be competitive;
however, students cannot sit and wait for
people to come to them."
Students will continue to see career op
portunities in the health services, small
businesses, management consulting and
technology and information sys-

tems.
"Health care fields are big, due in
part to the aging population," said
Schneider.
Schneider said that in the past
students thought more about work
ing for Fortune 500 companies.
"This is no longer true," she said.
More opportunities exist in small
businesses.
In addition, jobs entailing con
tractual work continue to be espe
cially hot.
Students in consulting jobs may
be contracted by many different
companies within a short amount of
time. Management consulting firms
are hired to solve a specific problem
within an organization.
The trend toward hiring consul
tants is growing because the area "is
cost-effective in the long run," said
Schneider.
"When a company brings in an
expert, they do not have to have long
term commitments."

International students and faculty
As the world turns, so does the composition
of international students on campus.
"Changes in world economics, not just in
ability of the students to pay," influence the
international student makeup, said John
Pearson, director of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Pearson anticipates a slight rise in Euro
pean students, suspecting little impact
from intra-European exchange programs
emerging from European unification.
Additionally, Pearson said he does not
expect an increase in the number of stu
dents from the former Soviet Union, citing
their unstable economies as a factor.
Moreover, Pearson predicts a slow de
crease in sub-Sahara African students, be
cause "the African students are not as pre
pared."
Expect more students to come from Pa
cific Rim countries.
An exceptional increase in the number of
students from China emerged during the
'80s. In 1980 there were two students from
China on campus. Now China represents
the largest number of students from any
single country, 233.
Pearson also pointed to the "tremen
dous number" of foreign-born faculty, all
the way up to German-born University
President Gerhard Casper.
Overseas studies
A map of overseas campuses in 1980 would
have the majority of Stanford flags in Eu
rope. That map in 2000 is more likely to have
flags spread evenly throughout the globe.
Begun in 1958, Overseas Studies opened
up a set of campuses that have flourished in
Western Europe.
In recent years, Overseas Studies ex
panded to Kyoto, Japan and Santiago, Chile
— as well as a new program in Moscow,
which starts this fall.
"All logic speaks to enriching the At
lanticist orientation of Overseas Studies
with a strong East Asia commitment," ac
cording to Russell Berman, director of
Overseas Studies.
Berman said the overseas studies pro
gram has to be expanded in light of the
enormous number of changes that have ex
pired due to the end of the Cold War, but
above all, because of "our growing interac
tion with other parts of the world, notably
Latin America, East Asia and Africa."
"We should not see this choice as a zero
sum game, by where we would have to give
up something in Europe in order to expand
elsewhere.
"The point for overseas studies is that
the intellectual opportunities that West
Europe offers have to be continued."
In the year 2000, Berman envisions "a
flourishing program in China and perhaps
a string of programs in parts of East and
Southern Asia "
Overseas Studies is building a program
in Latin America around the core in Santi
ago. "I hope long before the year 2000 we
will have some other location in the Ameri
cas," Berman said.
"Whether that will be in Latin America

proper or in the Caribbean is a matter of in
tellectual opportunity, faculty interest, stu
dent interest and the lands of organization
al and logistical issues that my office has to
deal with."
Additionally, Berman said, "it is high
time that we think of developing a strong
program in African Studies."
When asked if more students were
choosing to study overseas, Berman said,
"Our program in Oxford is always oversub
scribed. Kyoto is attractive. And Santiago is

extremely attractive and oversubscribed."
"I could imagine that the program in
Santiago could become the most popular,"
he said. "There is, of course an ongoing in
terest for Berlin, Florence and Paris. So the
student interest is there."
However, the Overseas Studies program
took a very hard hit in the budget cuts that
led to a reduction in capacity.
"Every budget cut means fewer students
going abroad and a grave loss, I think, to the
claim of Stanford to provide international
dimension to overseas education," he said.
"Because University President Casper
has repeatedly talked about the importance
of encountering another culture, I am
hopeful that in the year 2000 the overseas
program will not only continue, but will
have expanded beyond its current scope.
"Expanded in sites, expanded in charac
ter of program and expanded so that other
sorts of University activities may work
through the overseas studies program."
Such activities would include graduate edu
cation and faculty research, for example.
Libraries and information resources
Books may not become a thing of the past,
but Stanford libraries are in the midst of "a
mayor revolution in the way information is
stored and disseminated," says Rick
Biedenweg, assistant provost of Libraries
and Information Resources.
He said the trend to computerize is dri
ven by the need to communicate scholarly
information. "Today, virtually all the Stan
ford holdings are on an online catalogue."
But big questions remain unanswered,
especially in regards to who will have access
and who will have ownership to online in
formation.
The next step is to store source informa
tion, instead of just bibliography informa
tion.
According to Biedenweg, a person who is
looking for a journal article wants an arti
cle. They do not want all the articles in the
journal.
"What is going to happen when more
and more things are online, and more and
more journals are available through a sin
gle location at one place?" he asked.
"Maybe computer science is available at
Fremont, Nebraska, physics is available at
Stanford, and materials science available at
Cal Tech.
"However, you still have the need for
unique, rare material," he added. "That
may be how libraries differentiate them
selves. You will have access instead of own
ership to common materials."
Biedenweg said the vision is for a new
model:
"When a faculty member submits an ar
ticle to a journal, the journal is sent out to
four faculty members online for review. If
the article is approved, then the article is
posted by the publisher to a bulletin board
Now, from any terminal in the U.S. any
person can access that article."
Biedenweg remained optimistic that
there would not be costs placed on students
to browse through online information.
"The publishers are scared to death," he
said. "They are worried that their profit
margins are going to go away."

David Hung — Dally
The 21st century is only seven years
away.
Students might not levitate through the
Quad, but they will be able to enter the Geol
ogy Corner because the earthquake damage
will finally be repaired. In other construction
work, foreign dignitaries will not encounter
a single pothole as they drive down Palm
Drive in their limousines.
Although books will still be around, they
will be used less and less as they are read over
the network- Written e-mail messages will be
yesterday's technology, with students chat
ting through fiber-optic cables via live video.
But Stanford wannabes currently in fifth
grade should start saving now, because tu
ition will total around $28,000 per year.
Sweeping changes are underway
throughout all aspects of campus life in the
University as the 21st century nears. But
not all the changes will come from within, as

the dawning of a new international
ethos promises to make the Stanford
experience in the next millennium a
truly global one. And ultimately, the
future health of the University will
depend on the success or failure of the
American government.
In the following nine areas of the
University, prominent administra
tors outline their visions of Stanford
2000:
Academics
Instruction through osmosis? Pro
fessors replaced by multimedia com
puters? A mtuor in synthetic basket
weaving? Maybe not.
Still, any speculation on the future
of Stanford academics is tenuous
until the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education gets underway.
"I don't expect the nature of Stan
ford academics to be radically
changed," said History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"Stanford presents undergraduates with
the opportunity to learn in class, engage in
research with faculty and to partake in
structured public service.
"It is a liberal education that Stanford
graduates have put to great use and is the
hallmark of a Stanford education."
Camarillo suggested that the commission
should be concerned with the "personaliza
tion of a Stanford education.
"I would strive to make classes much
more interactive, closer," he said.
University President Gerhard Casper's
idea for a 3-year undergraduate program will
be under consideration by the committee.
According to Camarillo, "The 3-year plan
question is a fair question, but I think the big
question is what are our goals and objectives
of providing an undergraduate education.
Even if the length of a Stanford education
does not change, the student interest in cer
tain msyors seems to be changing.
"There is no clear pattern," said Camaril
lo, in terms of what majors students will be
interested in seven years.
But "international relations would be a
msyor that I believe will continue to grow due
to world affairs. Virtually all the world has
become international."
In addition, Camarillo noted that inter
disciplinary studies is "clearly a trend." Cur
rently, 20 percent of humanities and sci
ences students are in interdisciplinary fields.
Lorie Langdon, student services officer
for the Department of Biological Sciences,
said there has

been a "dramat
ic increase" in
the number of
students major
ing in biology —
from 239 in
1991-92 to 304
this year.
The number
completing hon
ors projects has
also increased
from approxi
mately 60 last
year to 70 in
1992-93.
Athletics
Will Bill Walsh
still be wearing
the red and
white in 2000?
"Hopefully, he'll
still be here,"
said Athletic Di
rector Ted Le
land. "I hope he
stays as long as
he has a good
time."
He added

that when a good program is created, it usu
ally continues, citing the San Francisco
49ers' post-Walsh success.
But Walsh is just the start of Leland's
wishes for the future. In the next seven
years, the Department of Athletics will try to
raise enough money to completely overhaul
the 72-year-old Stanford Stadium.
As soon as this fall, a partially renovated
Stanford Stadium with new aluminum
benches and a new press box could await re
turning Stanford students. These changes
will be funded by World Cup '94, the group
bringing some matches of the quadrennial
soccer tourney to The Farm next year.
Later, improved rest rooms, an expanded
walkway and new concession stands will re
place the presently aging facilities, said
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett.
The money for this and other Athletic De
partment goals will be raised in what the de-

partment is calling Campaign 2000.
The current donations goal of $5 million a
year will be doubled to $10 million to also add
three new women's varsity sports —
lacrosse, water polo and synchronized swim
ming — and 29 new endowed women's schol
arships.
Other goals include adding a softball field,
lights for Sunken Diamond and the golf dri
ving range, as well as another hole at the
Stanford Golf Course to replace one that
could be lost to future construction.
Another way Leland said he expected
Stanford athletics to improve over the next
several years is in the area of recruiting.
"Since Prop. 48 will get tougher in 1994,
Stanford stands to gain an edge over other
universities," Leland said. Proposition 48 is
a National Collegiate Athletic Association
amendment that restricts the type of stu
dents universities can recruit into their
sports programs.
Presently, any prospective student-ath
lete must have 12 semester units of high
school academics that average out to a "C"
and manage a minimum combined score of
700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
"Since Stanford has higher admittance
standards regardless of athletic talent, we
cannot pull from [the less academically tal
ented] pool of athletes anyway" — so Stan
ford will not be hurt by the tightening re
strictions, said Leland.
Leland added that Proposition 48 has al
ready "eliminated about 15 percent of our
opponents' talent pool" and that the tougher

requirements in 1994 will reduce the pool
another 15 percent.
The change will improve Stanford's
chances on the national level of sports, be
cause other schools with less stringent stan
dards of admission will be required to reject
those who cannot meet the new rule.
Rivalries will still be strong and encour
aged in the year 2000, according to Beckett
— "I would like to see others in the confer
ence match the rivalry of the Big Game. It
heightens the intensity of competition."
Problems in the future, Leland noted,
could be with the concept of amateurism and
the Olympic Committee's decision to give

stipends to successful athletes.
Social
Will Stanford still be a wet campus in
the year 2000? "I don't think we'll be
come a dry campus," said Heather
Dunn, program coordinator in the Of
fice of Student Activities.
By then, she said it "will be more in
tune with the student drinking cul
ture." She added that though the
Greek system probably will maintain
the status quo, sororities might have
their own residences by the year 2000.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see women
in houses," Dunn said. "It's certainly a
potential for the future."
A trend she has noticed and thinks
will continue into the future is the cre
ation of very specific student organiza
tions.
Some are formed for religious pur
poses, community service or "issue
oriented" campus groups
As for future planning, the Office of
Student Activities relies on "student
self-determination, current interests
and student contact" to evaluate fu
ture goals.
. "It's up to student initiative to
shape how our office will make an im
pact" in the future of Stanford, said
Dunn.
Similar to What the Office of Stu
dent Activities stated, Diana Conklin,
co-director of Residential Education,
doesn't specify definite long-range
plans, but emphasizes flexibility as the
students and other factors change.
"External influences such as the ef
fects of a three-year degree and the
changing national economy can have a
big impact on how we do what we do,"
Conklin said.
She added, "I finished my college
degree in less than three years, and
most of my time, including summers,
was spent on academics."
The proposed shift toward a three
year degree option would significantly
change the Stanford experience, thus
altering "the way we accomplish what
we accomplish" in residential educa
tion, said Conklin.
A constricted economy could force
students into the workplace to earn
money for tuition instead of pursuing
other interests.
More time spent away from extra-

curricrular activities could affect the
way Residential Education allocates res
idence staff and money for programming in
the dorms, she said.
Computer systems
Jeff Merriman, director of residential com
puting, is concerned that seven years from
now, computer technology will have ad
vanced so much as to leave some students
holed up in their dorm rooms all year.

how all students will be able to conduct their
business.
Payton talks about students using com

emerging from European unification.
Additionally, Pearson said he does not
expect an increase in the number of stu
dents from the former Soviet Union, citing
their unstable economies as a factor.
Moreover, Pearson predicts a slow de
crease in sub-Sahara African students, be
cause "the African students are not as pre
pared."
Expect more students to come from Pa
cific Rim countries.
An exceptional increase in the number of
students from China emerged during the
'80s. In 1980 there were two students from
China on campus. Now China represents
the largest number of students from any
single country, 233.
Pearson also pointed to the "tremen
dous number" of foreign-born faculty, all
the way up to German-born University
President Gerhard Casper.
Overseas studies
A map of overseas campuses in 1980 would
have the majority of Stanford flags in Eu
rope. That map in 2000 is more likely to have
flags spread evenly throughout the globe.
Begun in 1958, Overseas Studies opened
up a set of campuses that have flourished in
Western Europe.
In recent years, Overseas Studies ex
panded to Kyoto, Japan and Santiago, Chile
— as well as a new program in Moscow,
which starts this fall.
"All logic speaks to enriching the At
lanticist orientation of Overseas Studies
with a strong East Asia commitment," ac
cording to Russell Berman, director of
Overseas Studies.
Berman said the overseas studies pro
gram has to be expanded in light of the
enormous number of changes that have ex
pired due to the end of the Cold War, but
above all, because of "our growing interac
tion with other parts of the world, notably
Latin America, East Asia and Africa."
"We should not see this choice as a zero
sum game, by where we would have to give
up something in Europe in order to expand
elsewhere.
"The point for overseas studies is that
the intellectual opportunities that West
Europe offers have to be continued."
In the year 2000, Berman envisions "a
flourishing program in China and perhaps
a string of programs in parts of East and
Southern Asia "
Overseas Studies is building a program
in Latin America around the core in Santi
ago. "I hope long before the year 2000 we
will have some other location in the Ameri
cas," Berman said.
"Whether that will be in Latin America

proper or in the Caribbean is a matter of in
tellectual opportunity, faculty interest, stu
dent interest and the lands of organization
al and logistical issues that my office has to
deal with."
Additionally, Berman said, "it is high
time that we think of developing a strong
program in African Studies."
When asked if more students were
choosing to study overseas, Berman said,
"Our program in Oxford is always oversub
scribed. Kyoto is attractive. And Santiago is

extremely attractive and oversubscribed."
"I could imagine that the program in
Santiago could become the most popular,"
he said. "There is, of course an ongoing in
terest for Berlin, Florence and Paris. So the
student interest is there."
However, the Overseas Studies program
took a very hard hit in the budget cuts that
led to a reduction in capacity.
"Every budget cut means fewer students
going abroad and a grave loss, I think, to the
claim of Stanford to provide international
dimension to overseas education," he said.
"Because University President Casper
has repeatedly talked about the importance
of encountering another culture, I am
hopeful that in the year 2000 the overseas
program will not only continue, but will
have expanded beyond its current scope.
"Expanded in sites, expanded in charac
ter of program and expanded so that other
sorts of University activities may work
through the overseas studies program."
Such activities would include graduate edu
cation and faculty research, for example.
Libraries and information resources
Books may not become a thing of the past,
but Stanford libraries are in the midst of "a
mayor revolution in the way information is
stored and disseminated," says Rick
Biedenweg, assistant provost of Libraries
and Information Resources.
He said the trend to computerize is dri
ven by the need to communicate scholarly
information. "Today, virtually all the Stan
ford holdings are on an online catalogue."
But big questions remain unanswered,
especially in regards to who will have access
and who will have ownership to online in
formation.
The next step is to store source informa
tion, instead of just bibliography informa
tion.
According to Biedenweg, a person who is
looking for a journal article wants an arti
cle. They do not want all the articles in the
journal.
"What is going to happen when more
and more things are online, and more and
more journals are available through a sin
gle location at one place?" he asked.
"Maybe computer science is available at
Fremont, Nebraska, physics is available at
Stanford, and materials science available at
Cal Tech.
"However, you still have the need for
unique, rare material," he added. "That
may be how libraries differentiate them
selves. You will have access instead of own
ership to common materials."
Biedenweg said the vision is for a new
model:
"When a faculty member submits an ar
ticle to a journal, the journal is sent out to
four faculty members online for review. If
the article is approved, then the article is
posted by the publisher to a bulletin board
Now, from any terminal in the U.S. any
person can access that article."
Biedenweg remained optimistic that
there would not be costs placed on students
to browse through online information.
"The publishers are scared to death," he
said. "They are worried that their profit
margins are going to go away."

David Hung — Dally
The 21st century is only seven years
away.
Students might not levitate through the
Quad, but they will be able to enter the Geol
ogy Corner because the earthquake damage
will finally be repaired. In other construction
work, foreign dignitaries will not encounter
a single pothole as they drive down Palm
Drive in their limousines.
Although books will still be around, they
will be used less and less as they are read over
the network- Written e-mail messages will be
yesterday's technology, with students chat
ting through fiber-optic cables via live video.
But Stanford wannabes currently in fifth
grade should start saving now, because tu
ition will total around $28,000 per year.
Sweeping changes are underway
throughout all aspects of campus life in the
University as the 21st century nears. But
not all the changes will come from within, as

the dawning of a new international
ethos promises to make the Stanford
experience in the next millennium a
truly global one. And ultimately, the
future health of the University will
depend on the success or failure of the
American government.
In the following nine areas of the
University, prominent administra
tors outline their visions of Stanford
2000:
Academics
Instruction through osmosis? Pro
fessors replaced by multimedia com
puters? A mtuor in synthetic basket
weaving? Maybe not.
Still, any speculation on the future
of Stanford academics is tenuous
until the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education gets underway.
"I don't expect the nature of Stan
ford academics to be radically
changed," said History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"Stanford presents undergraduates with
the opportunity to learn in class, engage in
research with faculty and to partake in
structured public service.
"It is a liberal education that Stanford
graduates have put to great use and is the
hallmark of a Stanford education."
Camarillo suggested that the commission
should be concerned with the "personaliza
tion of a Stanford education.
"I would strive to make classes much
more interactive, closer," he said.
University President Gerhard Casper's
idea for a 3-year undergraduate program will
be under consideration by the committee.
According to Camarillo, "The 3-year plan
question is a fair question, but I think the big
question is what are our goals and objectives
of providing an undergraduate education.
Even if the length of a Stanford education
does not change, the student interest in cer
tain msyors seems to be changing.
"There is no clear pattern," said Camaril
lo, in terms of what majors students will be
interested in seven years.
But "international relations would be a
msyor that I believe will continue to grow due
to world affairs. Virtually all the world has
become international."
In addition, Camarillo noted that inter
disciplinary studies is "clearly a trend." Cur
rently, 20 percent of humanities and sci
ences students are in interdisciplinary fields.
Lorie Langdon, student services officer
for the Department of Biological Sciences,
said there has

been a "dramat
ic increase" in
the number of
students major
ing in biology —
from 239 in
1991-92 to 304
this year.
The number
completing hon
ors projects has
also increased
from approxi
mately 60 last
year to 70 in
1992-93.
Athletics
Will Bill Walsh
still be wearing
the red and
white in 2000?
"Hopefully, he'll
still be here,"
said Athletic Di
rector Ted Le
land. "I hope he
stays as long as
he has a good
time."
He added

that when a good program is created, it usu
ally continues, citing the San Francisco
49ers' post-Walsh success.
But Walsh is just the start of Leland's
wishes for the future. In the next seven
years, the Department of Athletics will try to
raise enough money to completely overhaul
the 72-year-old Stanford Stadium.
As soon as this fall, a partially renovated
Stanford Stadium with new aluminum
benches and a new press box could await re
turning Stanford students. These changes
will be funded by World Cup '94, the group
bringing some matches of the quadrennial
soccer tourney to The Farm next year.
Later, improved rest rooms, an expanded
walkway and new concession stands will re
place the presently aging facilities, said
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett.
The money for this and other Athletic De
partment goals will be raised in what the de-

partment is calling Campaign 2000.
The current donations goal of $5 million a
year will be doubled to $10 million to also add
three new women's varsity sports —
lacrosse, water polo and synchronized swim
ming — and 29 new endowed women's schol
arships.
Other goals include adding a softball field,
lights for Sunken Diamond and the golf dri
ving range, as well as another hole at the
Stanford Golf Course to replace one that
could be lost to future construction.
Another way Leland said he expected
Stanford athletics to improve over the next
several years is in the area of recruiting.
"Since Prop. 48 will get tougher in 1994,
Stanford stands to gain an edge over other
universities," Leland said. Proposition 48 is
a National Collegiate Athletic Association
amendment that restricts the type of stu
dents universities can recruit into their
sports programs.
Presently, any prospective student-ath
lete must have 12 semester units of high
school academics that average out to a "C"
and manage a minimum combined score of
700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
"Since Stanford has higher admittance
standards regardless of athletic talent, we
cannot pull from [the less academically tal
ented] pool of athletes anyway" — so Stan
ford will not be hurt by the tightening re
strictions, said Leland.
Leland added that Proposition 48 has al
ready "eliminated about 15 percent of our
opponents' talent pool" and that the tougher

requirements in 1994 will reduce the pool
another 15 percent.
The change will improve Stanford's
chances on the national level of sports, be
cause other schools with less stringent stan
dards of admission will be required to reject
those who cannot meet the new rule.
Rivalries will still be strong and encour
aged in the year 2000, according to Beckett
— "I would like to see others in the confer
ence match the rivalry of the Big Game. It
heightens the intensity of competition."
Problems in the future, Leland noted,
could be with the concept of amateurism and
the Olympic Committee's decision to give

stipends to successful athletes.
Social
Will Stanford still be a wet campus in
the year 2000? "I don't think we'll be
come a dry campus," said Heather
Dunn, program coordinator in the Of
fice of Student Activities.
By then, she said it "will be more in
tune with the student drinking cul
ture." She added that though the
Greek system probably will maintain
the status quo, sororities might have
their own residences by the year 2000.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see women
in houses," Dunn said. "It's certainly a
potential for the future."
A trend she has noticed and thinks
will continue into the future is the cre
ation of very specific student organiza
tions.
Some are formed for religious pur
poses, community service or "issue
oriented" campus groups
As for future planning, the Office of
Student Activities relies on "student
self-determination, current interests
and student contact" to evaluate fu
ture goals.
. "It's up to student initiative to
shape how our office will make an im
pact" in the future of Stanford, said
Dunn.
Similar to What the Office of Stu
dent Activities stated, Diana Conklin,
co-director of Residential Education,
doesn't specify definite long-range
plans, but emphasizes flexibility as the
students and other factors change.
"External influences such as the ef
fects of a three-year degree and the
changing national economy can have a
big impact on how we do what we do,"
Conklin said.
She added, "I finished my college
degree in less than three years, and
most of my time, including summers,
was spent on academics."
The proposed shift toward a three
year degree option would significantly
change the Stanford experience, thus
altering "the way we accomplish what
we accomplish" in residential educa
tion, said Conklin.
A constricted economy could force
students into the workplace to earn
money for tuition instead of pursuing
other interests.
More time spent away from extra-

curricrular activities could affect the
way Residential Education allocates res
idence staff and money for programming in
the dorms, she said.
Computer systems
Jeff Merriman, director of residential com
puting, is concerned that seven years from
now, computer technology will have ad
vanced so much as to leave some students
holed up in their dorm rooms all year.
With networking capabilities extending
throughout campus and the possibility by
the year 2000 of live video transmission over
computer networks, Merriman wonders,
"Will students leave their rooms? Will they
interact with faculty?"
With the ever-changing technology, these
decisions will be in the hands of the students
if Merriman's visions come true.
He said he sees fiberoptic networking — a
system 10 times faster than what presently
exists in dorms — as being available to all

students in their rooms by the year 2000.
The "backbone of the University" is al
ready wired for fiber optics, but the com
mensurate in-room connecting devices are
too expensive at the moment.
A computer with every student — well,
eveiy student with a computer — is a possi
bility Merriman foresees, as does Marick
Payton, director of the Network for Student
Information.
However, Payton envisions students log
ging onto Axess from portable computers
"like the Apple [Computer] Newton" over
radio modems.
When asked about the possibility of radio

or infrared modems being used by students,
Merriman was cautious, saying that type of
networking may be too slow for the comput
er users of the future.
The world of computers is "moving in two
divergent paths" — both toward computers
with bigger screens for more complex oper
ating systems, like the Next Inc. machines
and faster fiberoptic networking and, on the
other hand, toward more travel-friendly
portable computers.
What will the computer cluster of the year
2000 look like? Merriman explained that
since a very high percentage of students will
own their own computers by that time, the
clusters will "provide high-end peripheral
resources that will add value to the typical
student's computer."
For example, next year, all non-Row
house clusters will include CD-ROM drives.
Clusters of the future might also include

color scanners, color laser printers, Silicon
Graphics Inc. multimedia work stations and
other goodies.
The in-room connection process, which
does not require student modems, is slated
to be finished by 1998, signifying a change in
how all students will be able to conduct their
business.
Payton talks about students using com
puters to do business with the Bursar's Of
fice, the housing Draw and for financial ser
vices as well as for registration.
When asked if security was a big problem,
as the power of student-owned computers
increases, he replied that since Axess and all

of the information on grades are on a main
frame computer, its unfamilianty to hackers
and its custom operating system make it
"relatively easy to maintain a high level of
security."
Budget and tuition
A four-fold specter looms over Stanford's fi
nancial future.
Administrators say they are concerned
that income from research, tuition, the en
dowment and gifts will not be as strong as it
was in the '80s.
But changes in the labor market may help
ofiset these dwindling resources as the Uni
versity continues to tighten its belt.
According to Peter Van Etten, chief fi
nancial ofTicer, "A number of trends start
ed over the last two years, increasing and
maybe intensifying over the next several
years, lead us to be concerned regarding the

rate of increase in our revenues."
Of all the factors in question, research
funds contribute the largest proportion of
the budget — $500 million for this year, of
which 80 percent comes from the federal
government.
However, the government is reassessing
its priorities in terms of research spending
in the National Institutes of Health, De
fense Department and Department of En
ergy.
Although Van Etten noted that while
the University has not seen those changes
thus far, on the indirect-cost side of re
search Stanford just took a $25-million re-

duction and new regulations will
further reduce that payment by
"possibly $3 million or more de
pending on how the regulations are
interpreted."
Tuition also has limited potential
for increased revenues.
Of the $220 million that students
are billed for tuition, only $150-160
million is received by Stanford. The
difference is paid by the University
for financial aid.
Another factor reducing tuition
income is the Board of Trustees' de
sire to tame the rising cost of educa
tion.
"The trustees believe that Stan
ford cannot continue to raise tu
ition at 4-5 percent in real terms,"
said Van Etten.
But the indirect-cost crisis negat
ed the 1-2 percent increase policy
created by the trustees three years
ago.
Moreover, the endowment is an
area of budgetary concern. Stanford
is taking more money out to make
ends meet and getting less interest
income than in the 1980s.
In previous years, Stanford took
out only 4.75 percent of the merged
endowment, but under the Deficit
Financing Plan, the trustees ap
proved a 6.75 percent pay-out rate
for 1992-93 and 1993-94.
"We cannot expect to see the re
turns we saw in the '80s of 16 per
cent," said Van Etten. "The '90s
will not see as much growth."
A reduction in gifts is also project
ed. Even though gifts are quite
strong, totalling over $185 million
this year, Van Etten said, "The con
cern is that in the future it will be
harder to hold that number."
Fund raising "is getting particu
larly difficult given that we are
quite dependent on California for a
significant amount of our gifts. The
downturn in the California econo
my is bound to cause problems."
One area of the budget projected
to cost the University less than be
fore is faculty and staff salaries.
Van Etten said that until recently,
staff salaries have increased at
rates greater than inflation, but
that lower rates of salary increases
would translate into a slower rise in
the cost of education.

Careers
Many jobs of the year 2000 have not even
been invented yet, according to Ruth
Schneider, director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center.
But students will have to work harder to
get these new jobs.
In the area of technology and informa
tion systems, she said, "We are just running
to catch up.
"If you look at a dictionary of occupa
tional titles, it's amazing how many new job
titles emerge."
She believes students will have to spend
more time thinking and planning about
jobs, and she suggests that, "It will be in
creasingly important to take advantage of
internships and work experience."
"Right now it is amazing how many
firms look to students with previous experi
ence within the company," she said. "This

has become more and more significant over
the past 10 years.
"There are some employers that almost
never hire without previous experience."
Schneider said Stanford students must
be competitive in order to get future jobs.
"Our students will always be competitive;
however, students cannot sit and wait for
people to come to them."
Students will continue to see career op
portunities in the health services, small
businesses, management consulting and
technology and information sys-

tems.
"Health care fields are big, due in
part to the aging population," said
Schneider.
Schneider said that in the past
students thought more about work
ing for Fortune 500 companies.
"This is no longer true," she said.
More opportunities exist in small
businesses.
In addition, jobs entailing con
tractual work continue to be espe
cially hot.
Students in consulting jobs may
be contracted by many different
companies within a short amount of
time. Management consulting firms
are hired to solve a specific problem
within an organization.
The trend toward hiring consul
tants is growing because the area "is
cost-effective in the long run," said
Schneider.
"When a company brings in an
expert, they do not have to have long
term commitments."

International students and faculty
As the world turns, so does the composition
of international students on campus.
"Changes in world economics, not just in
ability of the students to pay," influence the
international student makeup, said John
Pearson, director of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Pearson anticipates a slight rise in Euro
pean students, suspecting little impact
from intra-European exchange programs
emerging from European unification.
Additionally, Pearson said he does not
expect an increase in the number of stu
dents from the former Soviet Union, citing
their unstable economies as a factor.
Moreover, Pearson predicts a slow de
crease in sub-Sahara African students, be
cause "the African students are not as pre
pared."
Expect more students to come from Pa
cific Rim countries.
An exceptional increase in the number of
students from China emerged during the
'80s. In 1980 there were two students from
China on campus. Now China represents
the largest number of students from any
single country, 233.
Pearson also pointed to the "tremen
dous number" of foreign-born faculty, all
the way up to German-born University
President Gerhard Casper.

have the majority of Stanford flags in Eu
rope. That map in 2000 is more likely to have

been a "dramat

the number of
students major
ing in biology —
from 239 in
1991-92 to 304
this year.
The number
completing hon

also increased
from approxi
mately 60 last

1992-93.
Athletics
Will Bill Walsh
still be wearing
the red and
white in 2000?
"Hopefully, he'll
still be here,"
said Athletic Di
rector Ted Le
land. "I hope he
stays as long as
he has a good
time."
He added

that when a good program is created, it usu
ally continues, citing the San Francisco
49ers' post-Walsh success.
But Walsh is just the start of Leland's
wishes for the future. In the next seven
years, the Department of Athletics will try to
raise enough money to completely overhaul
the 72-year-old Stanford Stadium.
As soon as this fall, a partially renovated
Stanford Stadium with new aluminum
benches and a new press box could await re
turning Stanford students. These changes
will be funded by World Cup '94, the group
bringing some matches of the quadrennial
soccer tourney to The Farm next year.
Later, improved rest rooms, an expanded
walkway and new concession stands will re
place the presently aging facilities, said
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett.
The money for this and other Athletic De
partment goals will be raised in what the de-

partment is calling Campaign 2000.
The current donations goal of $5 million a
year will be doubled to $10 million to also add
three new women's varsity sports —
lacrosse, water polo and synchronized swim
ming — and 29 new endowed women's schol
arships.
Other goals include adding a softball field,
lights for Sunken Diamond and the golf dri
ving range, as well as another hole at the
Stanford Golf Course to replace one that
could be lost to future construction.
Another way Leland said he expected
Stanford athletics to improve over the next
several years is in the area of recruiting.
"Since Prop. 48 will get tougher in 1994,
Stanford stands to gain an edge over other
universities," Leland said. Proposition 48 is
a National Collegiate Athletic Association
amendment that restricts the type of stu
dents universities can recruit into their
sports programs.
Presently, any prospective student-ath
lete must have 12 semester units of high
school academics that average out to a "C"
and manage a minimum combined score of
700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
"Since Stanford has higher admittance
standards regardless of athletic talent, we
cannot pull from [the less academically tal
ented] pool of athletes anyway" — so Stan
ford will not be hurt by the tightening re
strictions, said Leland.
Leland added that Proposition 48 has al
ready "eliminated about 15 percent of our
opponents' talent pool" and that the tougher

requirements in 1994 will reduce the pool
another 15 percent.
The change will improve Stanford's
chances on the national level of sports, be
cause other schools with less stringent stan
dards of admission will be required to reject
those who cannot meet the new rule.
Rivalries will still be strong and encour
aged in the year 2000, according to Beckett
— "I would like to see others in the confer
ence match the rivalry of the Big Game. It
heightens the intensity of competition."
Problems in the future, Leland noted,
could be with the concept of amateurism and
the Olympic Committee's decision to give

stipends to successful athletes.
Social
Will Stanford still be a wet campus in
the year 2000? "I don't think we'll be
come a dry campus," said Heather
Dunn, program coordinator in the Of
fice of Student Activities.
By then, she said it "will be more in
tune with the student drinking cul
ture." She added that though the
Greek system probably will maintain
the status quo, sororities might have
their own residences by the year 2000.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see women
in houses," Dunn said. "It's certainly a
potential for the future."
A trend she has noticed and thinks
will continue into the future is the cre
ation of very specific student organiza
tions.
Some are formed for religious pur
poses, community service or "issue
oriented" campus groups
As for future planning, the Office of
Student Activities relies on "student
self-determination, current interests
and student contact" to evaluate fu
ture goals.
. "It's up to student initiative to
shape how our office will make an im
pact" in the future of Stanford, said
Dunn.
Similar to What the Office of Stu
dent Activities stated, Diana Conklin,
co-director of Residential Education,
doesn't specify definite long-range
plans, but emphasizes flexibility as the
students and other factors change.
"External influences such as the ef
fects of a three-year degree and the
changing national economy can have a
big impact on how we do what we do,"
Conklin said.
She added, "I finished my college
degree in less than three years, and
most of my time, including summers,
was spent on academics."
The proposed shift toward a three
year degree option would significantly
change the Stanford experience, thus
altering "the way we accomplish what
we accomplish" in residential educa
tion, said Conklin.
A constricted economy could force
students into the workplace to earn
money for tuition instead of pursuing
other interests.
More time spent away from extra-

curricrular activities could affect the
way Residential Education allocates res
idence staff and money for programming in
the dorms, she said.
Computer systems
Jeff Merriman, director of residential com
puting, is concerned that seven years from
now, computer technology will have ad
vanced so much as to leave some students
holed up in their dorm rooms all year.
With networking capabilities extending
throughout campus and the possibility by
the year 2000 of live video transmission over
computer networks, Merriman wonders,
"Will students leave their rooms? Will they
interact with faculty?"
With the ever-changing technology, these
decisions will be in the hands of the students
if Merriman's visions come true.
He said he sees fiberoptic networking — a
system 10 times faster than what presently
exists in dorms — as being available to all

students in their rooms by the year 2000.
The "backbone of the University" is al
ready wired for fiber optics, but the com
mensurate in-room connecting devices are
too expensive at the moment.
A computer with every student — well,
eveiy student with a computer — is a possi
bility Merriman foresees, as does Marick
Payton, director of the Network for Student
Information.
However, Payton envisions students log
ging onto Axess from portable computers
"like the Apple [Computer] Newton" over
radio modems.
When asked about the possibility of radio

or infrared modems being used by students,
Merriman was cautious, saying that type of
networking may be too slow for the comput
er users of the future.
The world of computers is "moving in two
divergent paths" — both toward computers
with bigger screens for more complex oper
ating systems, like the Next Inc. machines
and faster fiberoptic networking and, on the
other hand, toward more travel-friendly
portable computers.
What will the computer cluster of the year
2000 look like? Merriman explained that
since a very high percentage of students will
own their own computers by that time, the
clusters will "provide high-end peripheral
resources that will add value to the typical
student's computer."
For example, next year, all non-Row
house clusters will include CD-ROM drives.
Clusters of the future might also include

color scanners, color laser printers, Silicon
Graphics Inc. multimedia work stations and
other goodies.
The in-room connection process, which
does not require student modems, is slated
to be finished by 1998, signifying a change in
how all students will be able to conduct their
business.
Payton talks about students using com
puters to do business with the Bursar's Of
fice, the housing Draw and for financial ser
vices as well as for registration.
When asked if security was a big problem,
as the power of student-owned computers
increases, he replied that since Axess and all

of the information on grades are on a main
frame computer, its unfamilianty to hackers
and its custom operating system make it
"relatively easy to maintain a high level of
security."
Budget and tuition
A four-fold specter looms over Stanford's fi
nancial future.
Administrators say they are concerned
that income from research, tuition, the en
dowment and gifts will not be as strong as it
was in the '80s.
But changes in the labor market may help
ofiset these dwindling resources as the Uni
versity continues to tighten its belt.
According to Peter Van Etten, chief fi
nancial ofTicer, "A number of trends start
ed over the last two years, increasing and
maybe intensifying over the next several
years, lead us to be concerned regarding the

rate of increase in our revenues."
Of all the factors in question, research
funds contribute the largest proportion of
the budget — $500 million for this year, of
which 80 percent comes from the federal
government.
However, the government is reassessing
its priorities in terms of research spending
in the National Institutes of Health, De
fense Department and Department of En
ergy.
Although Van Etten noted that while
the University has not seen those changes
thus far, on the indirect-cost side of re
search Stanford just took a $25-million re-

duction and new regulations will
further reduce that payment by
"possibly $3 million or more de
pending on how the regulations are
interpreted."
Tuition also has limited potential
for increased revenues.
Of the $220 million that students
are billed for tuition, only $150-160
million is received by Stanford. The
difference is paid by the University
for financial aid.
Another factor reducing tuition
income is the Board of Trustees' de
sire to tame the rising cost of educa
tion.
"The trustees believe that Stan
ford cannot continue to raise tu
ition at 4-5 percent in real terms,"
said Van Etten.
But the indirect-cost crisis negat
ed the 1-2 percent increase policy
created by the trustees three years
ago.
Moreover, the endowment is an
area of budgetary concern. Stanford
is taking more money out to make
ends meet and getting less interest
income than in the 1980s.
In previous years, Stanford took
out only 4.75 percent of the merged
endowment, but under the Deficit
Financing Plan, the trustees ap
proved a 6.75 percent pay-out rate
for 1992-93 and 1993-94.
"We cannot expect to see the re
turns we saw in the '80s of 16 per
cent," said Van Etten. "The '90s
will not see as much growth."
A reduction in gifts is also project
ed. Even though gifts are quite
strong, totalling over $185 million
this year, Van Etten said, "The con
cern is that in the future it will be
harder to hold that number."
Fund raising "is getting particu
larly difficult given that we are
quite dependent on California for a
significant amount of our gifts. The
downturn in the California econo
my is bound to cause problems."
One area of the budget projected
to cost the University less than be
fore is faculty and staff salaries.
Van Etten said that until recently,
staff salaries have increased at
rates greater than inflation, but
that lower rates of salary increases
would translate into a slower rise in
the cost of education.

Careers
Many jobs of the year 2000 have not even
been invented yet, according to Ruth
Schneider, director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center.
But students will have to work harder to
get these new jobs.
In the area of technology and informa
tion systems, she said, "We are just running
to catch up.
"If you look at a dictionary of occupa
tional titles, it's amazing how many new job
titles emerge."
She believes students will have to spend
more time thinking and planning about
jobs, and she suggests that, "It will be in
creasingly important to take advantage of
internships and work experience."
"Right now it is amazing how many
firms look to students with previous experi
ence within the company," she said. "This

has become more and more significant over
the past 10 years.
"There are some employers that almost
never hire without previous experience."
Schneider said Stanford students must
be competitive in order to get future jobs.
"Our students will always be competitive;
however, students cannot sit and wait for
people to come to them."
Students will continue to see career op
portunities in the health services, small
businesses, management consulting and
technology and information sys-

tems.
"Health care fields are big, due in
part to the aging population," said
Schneider.
Schneider said that in the past
students thought more about work
ing for Fortune 500 companies.
"This is no longer true," she said.
More opportunities exist in small
businesses.
In addition, jobs entailing con
tractual work continue to be espe
cially hot.
Students in consulting jobs may
be contracted by many different
companies within a short amount of
time. Management consulting firms
are hired to solve a specific problem
within an organization.
The trend toward hiring consul
tants is growing because the area "is
cost-effective in the long run," said
Schneider.
"When a company brings in an
expert, they do not have to have long
term commitments."

International students and faculty
As the world turns, so does the composition
of international students on campus.
"Changes in world economics, not just in
ability of the students to pay," influence the
international student makeup, said John
Pearson, director of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Pearson anticipates a slight rise in Euro
pean students, suspecting little impact
from intra-European exchange programs
emerging from European unification.
Additionally, Pearson said he does not
expect an increase in the number of stu
dents from the former Soviet Union, citing
their unstable economies as a factor.
Moreover, Pearson predicts a slow de
crease in sub-Sahara African students, be
cause "the African students are not as pre
pared."
Expect more students to come from Pa
cific Rim countries.
An exceptional increase in the number of
students from China emerged during the
'80s. In 1980 there were two students from
China on campus. Now China represents
the largest number of students from any
single country, 233.
Pearson also pointed to the "tremen
dous number" of foreign-born faculty, all
the way up to German-born University
President Gerhard Casper.
Overseas studies
A map of overseas campuses in 1980 would
have the majority of Stanford flags in Eu
rope. That map in 2000 is more likely to have
flags spread evenly throughout the globe.
Begun in 1958, Overseas Studies opened
up a set of campuses that have flourished in
Western Europe.
In recent years, Overseas Studies ex
panded to Kyoto, Japan and Santiago, Chile
— as well as a new program in Moscow,
which starts this fall.
"All logic speaks to enriching the At
lanticist orientation of Overseas Studies
with a strong East Asia commitment," ac
cording to Russell Berman, director of
Overseas Studies.
Berman said the overseas studies pro
gram has to be expanded in light of the
enormous number of changes that have ex
pired due to the end of the Cold War, but
above all, because of "our growing interac
tion with other parts of the world, notably
Latin America, East Asia and Africa."
"We should not see this choice as a zero
sum game, by where we would have to give
up something in Europe in order to expand
elsewhere.
"The point for overseas studies is that
the intellectual opportunities that West
Europe offers have to be continued."
In the year 2000, Berman envisions "a
flourishing program in China and perhaps
a string of programs in parts of East and
Southern Asia "
Overseas Studies is building a program
in Latin America around the core in Santi
ago. "I hope long before the year 2000 we
will have some other location in the Ameri
cas," Berman said.
"Whether that will be in Latin America

proper or in the Caribbean is a matter of in
tellectual opportunity, faculty interest, stu
dent interest and the lands of organization
al and logistical issues that my office has to
deal with."
Additionally, Berman said, "it is high
time that we think of developing a strong
program in African Studies."
When asked if more students were
choosing to study overseas, Berman said,
"Our program in Oxford is always oversub
scribed. Kyoto is attractive. And Santiago is

extremely attractive and oversubscribed."
"I could imagine that the program in
Santiago could become the most popular,"
he said. "There is, of course an ongoing in
terest for Berlin, Florence and Paris. So the
student interest is there."
However, the Overseas Studies program
took a very hard hit in the budget cuts that
led to a reduction in capacity.
"Every budget cut means fewer students
going abroad and a grave loss, I think, to the
claim of Stanford to provide international
dimension to overseas education," he said.
"Because University President Casper
has repeatedly talked about the importance
of encountering another culture, I am
hopeful that in the year 2000 the overseas
program will not only continue, but will
have expanded beyond its current scope.
"Expanded in sites, expanded in charac
ter of program and expanded so that other
sorts of University activities may work
through the overseas studies program."
Such activities would include graduate edu
cation and faculty research, for example.
Libraries and information resources
Books may not become a thing of the past,
but Stanford libraries are in the midst of "a
mayor revolution in the way information is
stored and disseminated," says Rick
Biedenweg, assistant provost of Libraries
and Information Resources.
He said the trend to computerize is dri
ven by the need to communicate scholarly
information. "Today, virtually all the Stan
ford holdings are on an online catalogue."
But big questions remain unanswered,
especially in regards to who will have access
and who will have ownership to online in
formation.
The next step is to store source informa
tion, instead of just bibliography informa
tion.
According to Biedenweg, a person who is
looking for a journal article wants an arti
cle. They do not want all the articles in the
journal.
"What is going to happen when more
and more things are online, and more and
more journals are available through a sin
gle location at one place?" he asked.
"Maybe computer science is available at
Fremont, Nebraska, physics is available at
Stanford, and materials science available at
Cal Tech.
"However, you still have the need for
unique, rare material," he added. "That
may be how libraries differentiate them
selves. You will have access instead of own
ership to common materials."
Biedenweg said the vision is for a new
model:
"When a faculty member submits an ar
ticle to a journal, the journal is sent out to
four faculty members online for review. If
the article is approved, then the article is
posted by the publisher to a bulletin board
Now, from any terminal in the U.S. any
person can access that article."
Biedenweg remained optimistic that
there would not be costs placed on students
to browse through online information.
"The publishers are scared to death," he
said. "They are worried that their profit
margins are going to go away."

The 21st century is only seven years
away.
Students might not levitate through the
Quad, but they will be able to enter the Geol
ogy Corner because the earthquake damage
will finally be repaired. In other construction
work, foreign dignitaries will not encounter
a single pothole as they drive down Palm
Drive in their limousines.
Although books will still be around, they
will be used less and less as they are read over
the network- Written e-mail messages will be
yesterday's technology, with students chat
ting through fiber-optic cables via live video.
But Stanford wannabes currently in fifth
grade should start saving now, because tu
ition will total around $28,000 per year.
Sweeping changes are underway
throughout all aspects of campus life in the
University as the 21st century nears. But
not all the changes will come from within, as

the dawning of a new international
ethos promises to make the Stanford
experience in the next millennium a
truly global one. And ultimately, the
future health of the University will
depend on the success or failure of the
American government.
In the following nine areas of the
University, prominent administra
tors outline their visions of Stanford
2000:
Academics
Instruction through osmosis? Pro
fessors replaced by multimedia com
puters? A mtuor in synthetic basket
weaving? Maybe not.
Still, any speculation on the future
of Stanford academics is tenuous
until the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education gets underway.
"I don't expect the nature of Stan
ford academics to be radically
changed," said History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"Stanford presents undergraduates with
the opportunity to learn in class, engage in
research with faculty and to partake in
structured public service.
"It is a liberal education that Stanford
graduates have put to great use and is the
hallmark of a Stanford education."
Camarillo suggested that the commission
should be concerned with the "personaliza
tion of a Stanford education.
"I would strive to make classes much
more interactive, closer," he said.
University President Gerhard Casper's
idea for a 3-year undergraduate program will
be under consideration by the committee.
According to Camarillo, "The 3-year plan
question is a fair question, but I think the big
question is what are our goals and objectives
of providing an undergraduate education.
Even if the length of a Stanford education
does not change, the student interest in cer
tain msyors seems to be changing.
"There is no clear pattern," said Camaril
lo, in terms of what majors students will be
interested in seven years.
But "international relations would be a
msyor that I believe will continue to grow due
to world affairs. Virtually all the world has
become international."
In addition, Camarillo noted that inter
disciplinary studies is "clearly a trend." Cur
rently, 20 percent of humanities and sci
ences students are in interdisciplinary fields.
Lorie Langdon, student services officer
for the Department of Biological Sciences,
said there has

been a "dramat
ic increase" in
the number of

A four-fold specter looms over Stanford's fi
nancial future.
Administrators say they are concerned
that income from research, tuition, the en
dowment and gifts will not be as strong as it
was in the '80s.
But changes in the labor market may help
ofiset these dwindling resources as the Uni
versity continues to tighten its belt.
According to Peter Van Etten, chief fi
nancial ofTicer, "A number of trends start
ed over the last two years, increasing and
maybe intensifying over the next several
years, lead us to be concerned regarding the

rate of increase in our revenues."
Of all the factors in question, research
funds contribute the largest proportion of
the budget — $500 million for this year, of
which 80 percent comes from the federal
government.
However, the government is reassessing
its priorities in terms of research spending
in the National Institutes of Health, De
fense Department and Department of En
ergy.
Although Van Etten noted that while
the University has not seen those changes
thus far, on the indirect-cost side of re
search Stanford just took a $25-million re-

duction and new regulations will
further reduce that payment by
"possibly $3 million or more de
pending on how the regulations are
interpreted."
Tuition also has limited potential
for increased revenues.
Of the $220 million that students
are billed for tuition, only $150-160
million is received by Stanford. The
difference is paid by the University
for financial aid.
Another factor reducing tuition
income is the Board of Trustees' de
sire to tame the rising cost of educa
tion.
"The trustees believe that Stan
ford cannot continue to raise tu
ition at 4-5 percent in real terms,"
said Van Etten.
But the indirect-cost crisis negat
ed the 1-2 percent increase policy
created by the trustees three years
ago.
Moreover, the endowment is an
area of budgetary concern. Stanford
is taking more money out to make
ends meet and getting less interest
income than in the 1980s.
In previous years, Stanford took
out only 4.75 percent of the merged
endowment, but under the Deficit
Financing Plan, the trustees ap
proved a 6.75 percent pay-out rate
for 1992-93 and 1993-94.
"We cannot expect to see the re
turns we saw in the '80s of 16 per
cent," said Van Etten. "The '90s
will not see as much growth."
A reduction in gifts is also project
ed. Even though gifts are quite
strong, totalling over $185 million
this year, Van Etten said, "The con
cern is that in the future it will be
harder to hold that number."
Fund raising "is getting particu
larly difficult given that we are
quite dependent on California for a
significant amount of our gifts. The
downturn in the California econo
my is bound to cause problems."
One area of the budget projected
to cost the University less than be
fore is faculty and staff salaries.
Van Etten said that until recently,
staff salaries have increased at
rates greater than inflation, but
that lower rates of salary increases
would translate into a slower rise in
the cost of education.

Careers
Many jobs of the year 2000 have not even
been invented yet, according to Ruth
Schneider, director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center.
But students will have to work harder to
get these new jobs.
In the area of technology and informa
tion systems, she said, "We are just running
to catch up.
"If you look at a dictionary of occupa
tional titles, it's amazing how many new job
titles emerge."
She believes students will have to spend
more time thinking and planning about
jobs, and she suggests that, "It will be in
creasingly important to take advantage of
internships and work experience."
"Right now it is amazing how many
firms look to students with previous experi
ence within the company," she said. "This

has become more and more significant over
the past 10 years.
"There are some employers that almost
never hire without previous experience."
Schneider said Stanford students must
be competitive in order to get future jobs.
"Our students will always be competitive;
however, students cannot sit and wait for
people to come to them."
Students will continue to see career op
portunities in the health services, small
businesses, management consulting and
technology and information sys-

tems.
"Health care fields are big, due in
part to the aging population," said
Schneider.
Schneider said that in the past
students thought more about work
ing for Fortune 500 companies.
"This is no longer true," she said.
More opportunities exist in small
businesses.
In addition, jobs entailing con
tractual work continue to be espe
cially hot.
Students in consulting jobs may
be contracted by many different
companies within a short amount of
time. Management consulting firms
are hired to solve a specific problem
within an organization.
The trend toward hiring consul
tants is growing because the area "is
cost-effective in the long run," said
Schneider.
"When a company brings in an
expert, they do not have to have long
term commitments."

International students and faculty
As the world turns, so does the composition
of international students on campus.
"Changes in world economics, not just in
ability of the students to pay," influence the
international student makeup, said John
Pearson, director of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Pearson anticipates a slight rise in Euro
pean students, suspecting little impact
from intra-European exchange programs
emerging from European unification.
Additionally, Pearson said he does not
expect an increase in the number of stu
dents from the former Soviet Union, citing
their unstable economies as a factor.
Moreover, Pearson predicts a slow de
crease in sub-Sahara African students, be
cause "the African students are not as pre
pared."
Expect more students to come from Pa
cific Rim countries.
An exceptional increase in the number of
students from China emerged during the
'80s. In 1980 there were two students from
China on campus. Now China represents
the largest number of students from any
single country, 233.
Pearson also pointed to the "tremen
dous number" of foreign-born faculty, all
the way up to German-born University
President Gerhard Casper.
Overseas studies
A map of overseas campuses in 1980 would
have the majority of Stanford flags in Eu
rope. That map in 2000 is more likely to have
flags spread evenly throughout the globe.
Begun in 1958, Overseas Studies opened
up a set of campuses that have flourished in
Western Europe.
In recent years, Overseas Studies ex
panded to Kyoto, Japan and Santiago, Chile
— as well as a new program in Moscow,
which starts this fall.
"All logic speaks to enriching the At
lanticist orientation of Overseas Studies
with a strong East Asia commitment," ac
cording to Russell Berman, director of
Overseas Studies.
Berman said the overseas studies pro
gram has to be expanded in light of the
enormous number of changes that have ex
pired due to the end of the Cold War, but
above all, because of "our growing interac
tion with other parts of the world, notably
Latin America, East Asia and Africa."
"We should not see this choice as a zero
sum game, by where we would have to give
up something in Europe in order to expand
elsewhere.
"The point for overseas studies is that
the intellectual opportunities that West
Europe offers have to be continued."
In the year 2000, Berman envisions "a
flourishing program in China and perhaps
a string of programs in parts of East and
Southern Asia "
Overseas Studies is building a program
in Latin America around the core in Santi
ago. "I hope long before the year 2000 we
will have some other location in the Ameri
cas," Berman said.
"Whether that will be in Latin America

proper or in the Caribbean is a matter of in
tellectual opportunity, faculty interest, stu
dent interest and the lands of organization
al and logistical issues that my office has to
deal with."
Additionally, Berman said, "it is high
time that we think of developing a strong
program in African Studies."
When asked if more students were
choosing to study overseas, Berman said,
"Our program in Oxford is always oversub
scribed. Kyoto is attractive. And Santiago is

extremely attractive and oversubscribed."
"I could imagine that the program in
Santiago could become the most popular,"
he said. "There is, of course an ongoing in
terest for Berlin, Florence and Paris. So the
student interest is there."
However, the Overseas Studies program
took a very hard hit in the budget cuts that
led to a reduction in capacity.
"Every budget cut means fewer students
going abroad and a grave loss, I think, to the
claim of Stanford to provide international
dimension to overseas education," he said.
"Because University President Casper
has repeatedly talked about the importance
of encountering another culture, I am
hopeful that in the year 2000 the overseas
program will not only continue, but will
have expanded beyond its current scope.
"Expanded in sites, expanded in charac
ter of program and expanded so that other
sorts of University activities may work
through the overseas studies program."
Such activities would include graduate edu
cation and faculty research, for example.
Libraries and information resources
Books may not become a thing of the past,
but Stanford libraries are in the midst of "a
mayor revolution in the way information is
stored and disseminated," says Rick
Biedenweg, assistant provost of Libraries
and Information Resources.
He said the trend to computerize is dri
ven by the need to communicate scholarly
information. "Today, virtually all the Stan
ford holdings are on an online catalogue."
But big questions remain unanswered,
especially in regards to who will have access
and who will have ownership to online in
formation.
The next step is to store source informa
tion, instead of just bibliography informa
tion.
According to Biedenweg, a person who is
looking for a journal article wants an arti
cle. They do not want all the articles in the
journal.
"What is going to happen when more
and more things are online, and more and
more journals are available through a sin
gle location at one place?" he asked.
"Maybe computer science is available at
Fremont, Nebraska, physics is available at
Stanford, and materials science available at
Cal Tech.
"However, you still have the need for
unique, rare material," he added. "That
may be how libraries differentiate them
selves. You will have access instead of own
ership to common materials."
Biedenweg said the vision is for a new
model:
"When a faculty member submits an ar
ticle to a journal, the journal is sent out to
four faculty members online for review. If
the article is approved, then the article is
posted by the publisher to a bulletin board
Now, from any terminal in the U.S. any
person can access that article."
Biedenweg remained optimistic that
there would not be costs placed on students
to browse through online information.
"The publishers are scared to death," he
said. "They are worried that their profit
margins are going to go away."

David Hung — Dally
The 21st century is only seven years
away.
Students might not levitate through the
Quad, but they will be able to enter the Geol
ogy Corner because the earthquake damage
will finally be repaired. In other construction
work, foreign dignitaries will not encounter
a single pothole as they drive down Palm
Drive in their limousines.
Although books will still be around, they
will be used less and less as they are read over
the network- Written e-mail messages will be
yesterday's technology, with students chat
ting through fiber-optic cables via live video.
But Stanford wannabes currently in fifth
grade should start saving now, because tu
ition will total around $28,000 per year.
Sweeping changes are underway
throughout all aspects of campus life in the
University as the 21st century nears. But
not all the changes will come from within, as

the dawning of a new international
ethos promises to make the Stanford
experience in the next millennium a
truly global one. And ultimately, the
future health of the University will
depend on the success or failure of the
American government.
In the following nine areas of the
University, prominent administra
tors outline their visions of Stanford
2000:
Academics
Instruction through osmosis? Pro
fessors replaced by multimedia com
puters? A mtuor in synthetic basket
weaving? Maybe not.
Still, any speculation on the future
of Stanford academics is tenuous
until the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education gets underway.
"I don't expect the nature of Stan
ford academics to be radically
changed," said History Prof. Albert
Camarillo, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"Stanford presents undergraduates with
the opportunity to learn in class, engage in
research with faculty and to partake in
structured public service.
"It is a liberal education that Stanford
graduates have put to great use and is the
hallmark of a Stanford education."
Camarillo suggested that the commission
should be concerned with the "personaliza
tion of a Stanford education.
"I would strive to make classes much
more interactive, closer," he said.
University President Gerhard Casper's
idea for a 3-year undergraduate program will
be under consideration by the committee.
According to Camarillo, "The 3-year plan
question is a fair question, but I think the big
question is what are our goals and objectives
of providing an undergraduate education.
Even if the length of a Stanford education
does not change, the student interest in cer
tain msyors seems to be changing.
"There is no clear pattern," said Camaril
lo, in terms of what majors students will be
interested in seven years.
But "international relations would be a
msyor that I believe will continue to grow due
to world affairs. Virtually all the world has
become international."
In addition, Camarillo noted that inter
disciplinary studies is "clearly a trend." Cur
rently, 20 percent of humanities and sci
ences students are in interdisciplinary fields.
Lorie Langdon, student services officer
for the Department of Biological Sciences,
said there has

been a "dramat
ic increase" in
the number of
students major
ing in biology —
from 239 in
1991-92 to 304
this year.
The number
completing hon
ors projects has
also increased
from approxi
mately 60 last
year to 70 in
1992-93.
Athletics
Will Bill Walsh
still be wearing
the red and
white in 2000?
"Hopefully, he'll
still be here,"
said Athletic Di
rector Ted Le
land. "I hope he
stays as long as
he has a good
time."
He added

that when a good program is created, it usu
ally continues, citing the San Francisco
49ers' post-Walsh success.
But Walsh is just the start of Leland's
wishes for the future. In the next seven
years, the Department of Athletics will try to
raise enough money to completely overhaul
the 72-year-old Stanford Stadium.
As soon as this fall, a partially renovated
Stanford Stadium with new aluminum
benches and a new press box could await re
turning Stanford students. These changes
will be funded by World Cup '94, the group
bringing some matches of the quadrennial
soccer tourney to The Farm next year.
Later, improved rest rooms, an expanded
walkway and new concession stands will re
place the presently aging facilities, said
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett.
The money for this and other Athletic De
partment goals will be raised in what the de-

partment is calling Campaign 2000.
The current donations goal of $5 million a
year will be doubled to $10 million to also add
three new women's varsity sports —
lacrosse, water polo and synchronized swim
ming — and 29 new endowed women's schol
arships.
Other goals include adding a softball field,
lights for Sunken Diamond and the golf dri
ving range, as well as another hole at the
Stanford Golf Course to replace one that
could be lost to future construction.
Another way Leland said he expected
Stanford athletics to improve over the next
several years is in the area of recruiting.
"Since Prop. 48 will get tougher in 1994,
Stanford stands to gain an edge over other
universities," Leland said. Proposition 48 is
a National Collegiate Athletic Association
amendment that restricts the type of stu
dents universities can recruit into their
sports programs.
Presently, any prospective student-ath
lete must have 12 semester units of high
school academics that average out to a "C"
and manage a minimum combined score of
700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
"Since Stanford has higher admittance
standards regardless of athletic talent, we
cannot pull from [the less academically tal
ented] pool of athletes anyway" — so Stan
ford will not be hurt by the tightening re
strictions, said Leland.
Leland added that Proposition 48 has al
ready "eliminated about 15 percent of our
opponents' talent pool" and that the tougher

requirements in 1994 will reduce the pool
another 15 percent.
The change will improve Stanford's
chances on the national level of sports, be
cause other schools with less stringent stan
dards of admission will be required to reject
those who cannot meet the new rule.
Rivalries will still be strong and encour
aged in the year 2000, according to Beckett
— "I would like to see others in the confer
ence match the rivalry of the Big Game. It
heightens the intensity of competition."
Problems in the future, Leland noted,
could be with the concept of amateurism and
the Olympic Committee's decision to give

stipends to successful athletes.
Social
Will Stanford still be a wet campus in
the year 2000? "I don't think we'll be
come a dry campus," said Heather
Dunn, program coordinator in the Of
fice of Student Activities.
By then, she said it "will be more in
tune with the student drinking cul
ture." She added that though the
Greek system probably will maintain
the status quo, sororities might have
their own residences by the year 2000.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see women
in houses," Dunn said. "It's certainly a
potential for the future."
A trend she has noticed and thinks
will continue into the future is the cre
ation of very specific student organiza
tions.
Some are formed for religious pur
poses, community service or "issue
oriented" campus groups
As for future planning, the Office of
Student Activities relies on "student
self-determination, current interests
and student contact" to evaluate fu
ture goals.
. "It's up to student initiative to
shape how our office will make an im
pact" in the future of Stanford, said
Dunn.
Similar to What the Office of Stu
dent Activities stated, Diana Conklin,
co-director of Residential Education,
doesn't specify definite long-range
plans, but emphasizes flexibility as the
students and other factors change.
"External influences such as the ef
fects of a three-year degree and the
changing national economy can have a
big impact on how we do what we do,"
Conklin said.
She added, "I finished my college
degree in less than three years, and
most of my time, including summers,
was spent on academics."
The proposed shift toward a three
year degree option would significantly
change the Stanford experience, thus
altering "the way we accomplish what
we accomplish" in residential educa
tion, said Conklin.
A constricted economy could force
students into the workplace to earn
money for tuition instead of pursuing
other interests.
More time spent away from extra-

curricrular activities could affect the
way Residential Education allocates res
idence staff and money for programming in
the dorms, she said.
Computer systems
Jeff Merriman, director of residential com
puting, is concerned that seven years from
now, computer technology will have ad
vanced so much as to leave some students
holed up in their dorm rooms all year.
With networking capabilities extending
throughout campus and the possibility by
the year 2000 of live video transmission over
computer networks, Merriman wonders,
"Will students leave their rooms? Will they
interact with faculty?"
With the ever-changing technology, these
decisions will be in the hands of the students
if Merriman's visions come true.
He said he sees fiberoptic networking — a
system 10 times faster than what presently
exists in dorms — as being available to all

students in their rooms by the year 2000.
The "backbone of the University" is al
ready wired for fiber optics, but the com
mensurate in-room connecting devices are
too expensive at the moment.
A computer with every student — well,
eveiy student with a computer — is a possi
bility Merriman foresees, as does Marick
Payton, director of the Network for Student
Information.
However, Payton envisions students log
ging onto Axess from portable computers
"like the Apple [Computer] Newton" over
radio modems.
When asked about the possibility of radio

or infrared modems being used by students,
Merriman was cautious, saying that type of
networking may be too slow for the comput
er users of the future.
The world of computers is "moving in two
divergent paths" — both toward computers
with bigger screens for more complex oper
ating systems, like the Next Inc. machines
and faster fiberoptic networking and, on the
other hand, toward more travel-friendly
portable computers.
What will the computer cluster of the year
2000 look like? Merriman explained that
since a very high percentage of students will
own their own computers by that time, the
clusters will "provide high-end peripheral
resources that will add value to the typical
student's computer."
For example, next year, all non-Row
house clusters will include CD-ROM drives.
Clusters of the future might also include

color scanners, color laser printers, Silicon
Graphics Inc. multimedia work stations and
other goodies.
The in-room connection process, which
does not require student modems, is slated
to be finished by 1998, signifying a change in
how all students will be able to conduct their
business.
Payton talks about students using com
puters to do business with the Bursar's Of
fice, the housing Draw and for financial ser
vices as well as for registration.
When asked if security was a big problem,
as the power of student-owned computers
increases, he replied that since Axess and all

of the information on grades are on a main
frame computer, its unfamilianty to hackers
and its custom operating system make it
"relatively easy to maintain a high level of
security."
Budget and tuition
A four-fold specter looms over Stanford's fi
nancial future.
Administrators say they are concerned
that income from research, tuition, the en
dowment and gifts will not be as strong as it
was in the '80s.

took a very hard hit in the budget cuts that
led to a reduction in capacity.
"Every budget cut means fewer students
going abroad and a grave loss, I think, to the
claim of Stanford to provide international
dimension to overseas education," he said.
"Because University President Casper
has repeatedly talked about the importance
of encountering another culture, I am
hopeful that in the year 2000 the overseas
program will not only continue, but will
have expanded beyond its current scope.
"Expanded in sites, expanded in charac
ter of program and expanded so that other
sorts of University activities may work
through the overseas studies program."
Such activities would include graduate edu
cation and faculty research, for example.
Libraries and information resources
Books may not become a thing of the past,
but Stanford libraries are in the midst of "a
mayor revolution in the way information is
stored and disseminated," says Rick
Biedenweg, assistant provost of Libraries
and Information Resources.
He said the trend to computerize is dri
ven by the need to communicate scholarly
information. "Today, virtually all the Stan
ford holdings are on an online catalogue."
But big questions remain unanswered,
especially in regards to who will have access
and who will have ownership to online in
formation.
The next step is to store source informa
tion, instead of just bibliography informa
tion.
According to Biedenweg, a person who is
looking for a journal article wants an arti
cle. They do not want all the articles in the
journal.
"What is going to happen when more
and more things are online, and more and
more journals are available through a sin
gle location at one place?" he asked.
"Maybe computer science is available at
Fremont, Nebraska, physics is available at
Stanford, and materials science available at
Cal Tech.
"However, you still have the need for
unique, rare material," he added. "That
may be how libraries differentiate them
selves. You will have access instead of own
ership to common materials."
Biedenweg said the vision is for a new
model:
"When a faculty member submits an ar
ticle to a journal, the journal is sent out to
four faculty members online for review. If
the article is approved, then the article is
posted by the publisher to a bulletin board
Now, from any terminal in the U.S. any
person can access that article."
Biedenweg remained optimistic that
there would not be costs placed on students
to browse through online information.
"The publishers are scared to death," he
said. "They are worried that their profit
margins are going to go away."
