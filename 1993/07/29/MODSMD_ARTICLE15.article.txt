## Concerns, complaints greet multicultural reform effort 
### 
Concerns, complaints, comments and
eventually proposals to improve the Office of
Multicultural Development were voiced by
about 60 members of the Stanford communi
ty Friday afternoon in Tresidder Union.
The President's Ad Hoc Advisory Com
mittee on the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment gathered information at the open
meeting to present to University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleeza
Rice. By Aug. 6, they will propose a new fu
ture direction and structure for the office.
The comments ranged from annoyance to
anger.
"The office needs to protect minority stu
dents from constant comments suggesting
the only reason they were admitted to the
University is because of affirmative action,"

said Rhonda Sharpe, a black graduate stu
dent in operations research.
Jewel Hudson from the Legal Counseling
Office reacted strongly and sympathetically
to Sharpe's complaint, saying "no student of
this University should have to come to plead
for this kind of protection."
David Bradfute, a graduate student in bi
ological sciences, criticized the Office of Mul
ticultural Development for ignoring gradu
ate students' needs. He also said he was con
cerned that the committee would fail to in
clude women, disabled people, gays, lesbians
and bisexuals in its defmition of multicultur
alism.
One faculty member complained of a re
luctance in the University to hire women and
blacks. Another said she resented the fact

that the office does not put any effort into in
tegrating incoming members of the Stanford
community.
Reflecting upon what she had heard,
alumna Penny Williams said, "I am experi
encing an enormous amount of deja vu. We
were discussing the same things in 1975."
Prof. Albert Camarillo, chair of the Advi
sory Committee, said he sympathized with
many of the comments, but he did not an
swer several of the questions. He assured the
attendees that the president and the provost
wanted to ensure an institutional commit
ment to multicultural development and
wanted to push the University into a health
ier environment.
The debate over the future of the office
was fueled by, among other things, the sud

den resignation in April of Sharon Parker as
director of the Office of Multicultural Educa
tion. In addition, some student groups have
questioned the level of commitment to multi
culturalism Casper showed during his first
year.
After the flurry of complaints Friday,
some constructive suggestions did emerge.
In an ideal situation, speakers said, there
would be an institution to harness and con
nect all the separate multicultural efforts of
the University. In addition, they said, there
would be a student representative in the of
fice, access to the president and provost re
garding these issues and constant self-analy
sis by the office to make sure statistics re
flected its established goals.
