# Angelou speaks to P.A. audience
## 
### 
In a hot, stuffy auditorium filled with ex
cited people, a voice rang out: "When it looked
like the sun would not shine anymore/God
put a rainbow in the clouds."
The slow, gospel-like song came from
Maya Angelou — world-renowned as a
dancer, novelist, poet, composer, actress,
playwright, community activist and inspira
tional speaker — who spoke Saturday morn
ing at a symposium sponsored by The Spring
Foundation for Research on Women in Con
temporary Society at Spangenberg Theatre in
Palo Alto.
The Spring Foundation is a non-profit re
search group with three Stanford staff mem
bers sitting on its board of directors. Spring
sponsors 11 different research grants on the
theme of "Resilience in Women."
Angelou picked up on that theme in her dy
namic talk to a packed house, recounting sto
ries from her childhood in Stamps, Ark., that
are well-known from her book, "I Know Why
the Caged Bird Sings."
A master storyteller, she moved around
the stage, gesturing and acting out her tales,
holding the audience of more than 2,000 cap
tivated.
Angelou asserted that "being a woman is
hard work" and that women must stand up
for themselves in a world which uses language
to de-emphasize women's roles as profession
als.
"If she is the thing, she must be the thing
and be called the thing," Angelou said.
She cited courage as the most important
virtue, for "without courage, you can't prac
tice other virtues consistently."
Angelou said that both sexes must learn to
not say one thing and then do another. She
noted that many people say they are against
racism, but then turn their heads when they
hear racial epithets in daily conversation.
"You must have the courage to say, 'Ex
cuse me. I beg your pardon; I don't agree with
that."'
After saying that she "doesn't trust people
who don't laugh," Angelou had everyone
laughing with her.
"Men must be as phenomenal as women
are," she joked. "That they don't know it
might explain their bad behavior."
After a standing ovation, Angelou came
back out on stage to sing a song she wrote,
"Take Time Out." The entire audience was
singing with her before it was over.
After the symposium, Emily Lyon,
founder and president of the foundation,
praised Angelou for the example she gives of
how women can be resilient.
"Maya embodies resilience," said Lyon,
who is also a volunteer clinical faculty mem
ber of Stanford's Department of Psychiatry.
Many young women in the audience said
they found Angelou's talk inspiring.
"She had so much power and feeling," said
Cameo Roberson, 17, from Woodside High
School. "I was very inspired... I think a lot of
women came out of there feeling like I feel."
"I liked her stories," said 11-year-old Kat
rina Bumside from Menlo Park. "She read
them slowly so you got the feeling — I admire
her because she's a very successful woman."
Angelou has received nominations for the
National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize for
Poetry and the Tony Award, as well as an
Emmy for her performance in the television
production of Alex Haley's "Roots."
She has written 10 books and holds more

than 30 honorary degrees. At President Clin
ton's inauguration she read her poem, "On
the Pulse of the Morning," to millions of peo
pb tuned in across the world. Some of her po
etry appears through the mouth of pop star
Janet Jackson, in John Singleton's new film,
"Poetic Justice."
