# Wilbur facelift brings the noise
## 
### 
Wilbur is in the final stages of being
stripped from the inside out. But not without
waking some people up.
Students in neighboring dorms have com
plained because of the noise from construc
tion, like early-morning jackhammers. But
according to Lynn Click, associate manager of
Undergraduate Student Housing, the jack
hammers will be restricted to after 7 a.m. in
an attempt to address student concerns.
The $8 million renovation, expected to be
completed by Sept. 1, should improve the rep
utation of the traditionally maligned 43-year
old dormitory. With renovations — including
new carpets, furniture, paint, lighting, re
strooms and showers — set for the summer,
Wilbur's popularity soared among students
last spring, as evidenced by its Draw ranking.
A few months ago, students were given the
opportunity to tour and critique models of the
planned rooms at Wilbur, and their input was
used in the designs for renovation, Glick said.
The discarded furniture and appliances
were donated to various needy organizations.
Some furniture in the dormitory, such as 400
chairs, will be kept and new furniture will be
of a similar style.
Exterior renovations are also taking place,

as the sidewalk and area m front of the dormi
tory are being torn up, Click said.
ers have been hired to produce a more aes
thetic effect.
Food Service at Wilbur will also see
changes, such as new dining-room equipment
and a choice between a la carte or full-board
meal plans.
