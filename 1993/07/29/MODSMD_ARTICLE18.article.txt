# Med School gets sporty, sort of
## 
### 
This fall, the School of Medicine will rein
troduce its multidisciplinary sports medicine
course with lecturers including local physi
cians, athletes and coaches.
"Everyone knows sports medicine as it re
lates to orthopedic surgery and injury," said
Dr. James McGuire, chief of staff at Stanford
Hospital and coach of the University's
lacrosse team. "But this course will include
more — such as the physical and psychologi
cal conditioning that occurs in sports."
The course, which will be offered through
the Medical School as a whole and not just the
Orthopedic Surgery Department, will cover a
broad spectrum of topics including women's
health issues, the physiology of sports at all
altitudes ranging from deep-water diving to
mountain climbing, biochemistry and bone
metabolism.
A practical element will even be show
cased in the course, as students learn about
all aspects of athletic training ranging from
nutrition to weight training. There will even
be an evening course at the weight room with
trainers and coaches from the Athletic De
partment, McGuire said.
"This is not a course that will teach

surgery techniques. It tries to approach ath
letics more from what it does for the body-like
general health and cardiovascular function,"
he said.
In addition, the course will present "hot,"
timely topics such as AIDS and the athlete,
including specific cases such as Magic John
son and the risk of contracting AIDS through
exposure in athletic competitions.
McGuire emphasized that the course is ac
tually a reactivation of a similar sports medi
cine course at Stanford that was extremely
popular in the 1980s.
Dr. Alfred Spivak, a longtime Palo Alto
cardiologist and clinical professor of medicine
at Stanford, first began the class in 1977, dri
ven by a strong interest in the sport and phys
iology of diving. The complexity of organizing
and coordinating such an interdisciplinary
course, however, made it difficult to oversee,
and it was discontinued five years ago.
But, according to McGuire, an increasing
interest in the topic of sports medicine was
the motivating force behind the recent re
vival of the popular '80s course. "So we're
making [Spivak] start it up again," McGuire
said.
There are no plans for a self-standing
sports medicine major, however. According
to McGuire, "The problem with a full major is
that it requires a lot of work and planning. It
would be easy to expand this course into
many courses, but we will have to see the in
terest we get before making any further
plans."
Sports Medicine 280, as the course will be
listed through the School of Medicine, will be
open both to medical students and to under
graduates. However, McGuire suggested
that the course "will be best suited for juniors
or seniors with an interest in psychology and
human biology. But there certainly will be
topics within the course that require no pre
vious training."
