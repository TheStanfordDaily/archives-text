More than half the recent graduates from
the Stanford senior class of 1993 favor the
current policy restricting "hate speech" on
campus, according to a recent survey.
John Marr, a graduate student at Ohio
State University, conducted the survey of
Stanford University students as part of his
doctoral dissertation at Ohio State. Marr
found that the approximately 25 percent who
completed the survey were against the policy
which prohibits discriminatory harassment.
Just over 50 percent of those who com
pleted the survey favored the policy. The rest
had no opinion.
Marr distributed questionnaires concern
ing the policy to 1,269 Stanford seniors during
winter quarter. Of the 555 respondents, about
half the senior class, 63 percent were white,
and the rest were from racial minorities.
Close to 80 percent of the students re
sponding to Marr's questionnaire thought
the policy had not prevented them from rais
ing subjects or questions — in class or in their
residences — that might have been viewed as
sensitive or controversial.
Marr said in a recent interview that his re
sults show that a policy restricting speech "on
a day to day basis doesn't have any real effect."
He added, "students understand multicul
turalism is a part of Stanford."
