## Stanford begins preparations for 1994 World Cup 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
The World Cup is still nearly a
year away, but preparations have
already begun for the world's
largest sporting event to descend
on Stanford, June 20-July 4,
1994.
The premier international soc
cer event, which is played every four
years, is being hosted by the United
States for the first time. During a
two-week period Stanford Stadium
will be the site of five early-round
games and a quarterfinal.
Most of the current prepara
tions involve renovating Stanford
Stadium and organizing security.
Roughly 83,000 fans are expected
for each game, along with scores
of players, trainers, coaches and
caravans of international media.
A circus? Probably. And Mar
vin Herrington, chief of Stanford
Police, is in charge of ensuring
the safety of all involved.
Planning began in earnest last
year, as Herrington and represen
tatives from the eight other
World Cup venues met in Virginia
with European police agencies to
discuss past World Cups and to
plan strategies to avoid problem
atic situations.
One past problem at European
matches is hooliganism, where
groups of ultra-nationalistic fans
provoke opposing spectators into
fistfights and brawls that some
times escalate into free-for-alls.
"They eryoy getting into physi
cal confrontations," Herrington
said, after seeing tapes of fan vio
lence at British matches.
Italy, which hosted the World
Cup in 1990, was plagued by sev
eral instances of hooliganism at
various sites, but Herrington
doubts that it will be a problem
here. However, he admitted that
the U.S. is in relatively unchar
tered waters when it comes to
hosting such an event.
"It's never been held here and
we've never seen anything like
this, so we can't take a chance," he
said. "None of us want any prob
lems."
European fans, of whom only a
small proportion are likely to in
stigate violence, will make up less
than half the total attendance,
since 60 percent of the tickets
were sold in the United States.
"We think the chances are
small that the experiences
they've had in Europe would be
played out here on the same
scale," Herrington said.
"Americans have no tradition

of that kind of
hooliganism. It's
not a tradition in
a lot of countries
— only in six or
seven countries,
primarily Eng
land," Herring
ton added.
Fans in many
European coun-

tries view soccer differently than
Americans do. Soccer is more
than a sport in many nations — it
is a passionate, sometimes ultra
nationalistic, event.
In contrast, soccer in the U.S.
is a family pursuit, a sport which
has flourished on the youth level
but has struggled professionally.
Most of the tickets, which sold
out at every venue hours after
going on sale, were purchased by
families.
Alcohol also plays a large role
in the violence. Often unruly fans
go pubbingbeforehand, get drunk
and go to the stadium. The possi
bility exists here, but to a lesser
extent, according to Herrington.
"In Norway they decided to set
up big beer tents outside the sta
dium. People got drunk and start
ed fighting," he said.
Exacerbating the problem in
Europe is the size of the countries

and ease of travel between
venues.
"When one team wins or loses,
it doesn't mean you jump in a van,
and in a couple of hours you're
there," Herrington said of the
U.S. sites which are spread from
New York to Los Angeles, Wash
ington D.C. to Dallas. "In Italy,
you could move from venue to
venue very easily and the (for
eign) fans could go to the host
country relatively easily."
Enforcing peace will be easier
for the U.S. because of special 30-
day visas that many foreign visi
tors will have. To get the tempo
rary visa, a traveller must sign
away any right to a hearing.
Thus, if any troublemakers are
from overseas, they can be de
ported almost immediately with
out the usual red tape.
Several segments of the federal
government will play supporting
roles in providing on-site securi
ty. The Federal Bureau of Investi
gation will help gather informa
tion on any potential deportee
while the Department of Defense
has offered communications
equipment for security person
nel. "The World Cup is here by
the invitation of the federal gov
ernment," Herrington said.
But even with such support,

Herrington will face a time
crunch. Security is scheduled to
be in place three hours after com
mencement ceremonies end on
June 13. That includes mobilizing
personnel to man all entrances to
the stadium to insure that no
weapons or alcohol get into Stan
ford Stadium.
"All entry points will be
checked, and we will bar anything
that looks like a weapon," Herring
ton said. "We're going to check and
search a lot closer than we would be
doing at Stanford events."
Over 300 officers will be orga
nized in beat systems to watch ac
tion in the stands, around the
field and near the players, with of
ficers on call in the surrounding
cities in case problems arise out
side the Stadium. "We will have
officers within seconds of any
problem," Herrington vowed.
While security preparations
continue, probably the most no
ticeable preparations will include
renovations of the stadium itself.
According to John Davis, facilities
and events coordinator, three
major changes will be done before
Stanford hosts a pre-Cup match
between Germany and the United
States on Dec 18.
The concrete has already been
poured for a lower level seating

tier underneath the press box,
which will give media and VIPs
more room, Davis said.
New seat tops will be added to
the remainder of the stadium,
which includes 58,000 seats. The
contract has beeh awarded and
the work will be completed in
stages between Aug. 9 and Dec. 18.
"They will be replacing as they
go," said Davis, explaining how
the work will be done with mini
mal impact on attendance of foot
ball games in the fall. "They will
tear out about 30 to 40 rows at a
time."
The third renovation deals
with the field itself. The crown of
the field will be leveled and re
duced. The crown is the added
height of the middle of the field
from the edges and is maintained
for drainage purposes.
In Europe, soccer pitch crowns
are usually 10-12 inches, and that
is the height it will be after the
World Cup team resods the field,
immediately after Big Game on
November 20. Stanford Stadium
started out with a crown of 12
inches and over the years it has
built up to 20 inches. Davis said
the renovated field and bluegrass
turf will improve conditions for all
sports which use the field.
"It will enhance football," he
said. "There is swale in-between
the hash marks, so the ground is
slightly higher along the hash
marks. You can't see it from the
stands, and you can't feel it when
you run over it, but World Cup
wants it perfect."
The costs of these changes will
be split by Stanford and the World
Cup, with Stanford paying for the
improvements permanent to
Stanford Stadium — covering the
seats and the addition to the press
box. The field alterations made
specifically for the soccer matches
will be covered by the World Cup.
Davis estimated the cost to
Stanford will be in the neighbor
hood of $1.5 million, while the re
sodding will cost several hundred
thousand dollars. Davis said he
expects Stanford's expenses to be
covered by revenue from the
matches. "Stanford is not in
volved in this to lose money,"
Davis said.
With field renovations to be
made and security strategy to
plan, Herrington has a simple
hope for the result of all the com
plex preparations.
"We hope it's going to be an in
teresting and enjoyable event,
and we'll all be tired when its
over."
