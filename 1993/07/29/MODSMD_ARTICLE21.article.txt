The U.S. Long Course National Swim
ming Championships may have seemed a lit
tle longer than usual for Stanford sprint
specialist Jenny Thompson.
The junior won the 100 free on Tuesday
with a time of 55.34 seconds, well off her
world record of 54.48 set at last year's U.S.
Olympic Trials.
"I was really excited this morning. It was
the first race of the day and that's how it was
when I set the world record," she said of the
preliminary heats in which she clocked a
54.80.
"I guess I was tired from a long day. I
haven't gone that slow since 1991," said
Thompson about her time in the finals. "It
doesn't bother me that much, though,
knowing that I won."
Florida's Nicole Haislett, Thompson's
Olympic teammate and rival, finished sec
ond in 55.70. Placing third was Angel Mar
tino, who along with Thompson, Haislett
and Dara Torres blew away the 400-free
relay field in Barcelona to take home
Olympic gold and shatter the world record
formerly held by the juiced up East Ger

man juggernaut.
Stanford's Mary Edwards placed fifth.
Senior Lea Loveless, who set an Ameri
can record in the 100 backstroke and
helped the U.S. to a 400-medley relay gold
medal in Spain, nabbed a victory in the 200
back.
Although the win was Loveless' first na
tional title, she put the victory in perspec
tive. "My brother is taking the bar tomor
row My sister is expecting a baby any day,
so I'll just call my family and tell them how 1
did," Loveless said.
On the men's side, several other Cardinal
Olympians placed highly although none hit
the wall first. Sophomore Joe Hudepohl
took second in the 100 free in 49.62 seconds,
three tenths of a second behind winner Jon
Olsen.
An Olympic silver medalist, graduate Jeff
Rouse placed seventh in the 200 back, two
places behind former teammate, senior
Derek Weatherford.
Senior Tyler Mayfield took third in the
200 breast. Michigan star Eric Wunderlich
notched the win in 2.14.46. Cardinal junior
Ray Carey placed second in the 200 butter
fly, nearly a second behind Olympic champi
on Melvin Stewart.
