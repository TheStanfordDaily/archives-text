Women's Softball
After sifting through about 50 appli
cations, the Stanford Department of
Athletics has named Sandy Pearce the
new women's softball coach.
Pearce, who coached UC-Santa Bar
bara from 1991-93, takes over the reins
from Hank Wallis, who led the Cardinal
to a 1-41 record in its first season as a
varsity sport.
"The Cardinal softball program is
moving into a new era of development,
and we are impressed with Sandy's abili
ties as a teacher and a coach," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
Pearce is quite familiar with collegiate
softball success. The 1987 UC-Santa Bar
bara graduate gained All-Big West honors
from 1985-87 and was named to the NCAA
Far West Second Team her senior year.
Pearce held the NCAA career record
for games pitched (168), games started
(139), and is fourth all-time in career in
nings pitched (1,075.1).
Pearce began her coaching career at
Buena High School and has served as as
sistant director of the UCLA Softball
Camp as well as numerous clinics and

camps in the United States and Canada.
Baseball
Two Stanford baseball players were
recently named to the All-Alaska League
Invitational Tournament team. First
baseman Dusty Allen and shortstop Jed
Hansen, who both played for the tourney
champion Anchorage Bucs, were named
to the team.
Both have played in all but one of the
Bucs 35 games this season. Hansen leads
the squad in runs-batted-in with 25 and
is tied for the team lead in hits and home
runs with 41 and five, respectively.
Hansen also tops the list in runs
scored with 33. Although consistent at
the plate, Hansen has been erratic in the
field. His 13 errors is second highest on
the Bucs.
Allen, who has had 26 fewer at-bats
than Hansen, has racked up some im
pressive numbers. He's hitting .321 and
is second only to Hansen in RBIs with 24.
The two juniors, who have both start
ed for Stanford since their freshman
year, will be expected to anchor the Car
dinal infield next year.
