## The 						black new wave & The Rebirth of Slick how long can john singleton and his audience stay cool like dat? 
### victor haseman 
Ladies and gents, say hello to Slick, a peddler
whose wonderful product has never fallen
out of favor with American pop culture.
Ages ago, when hands as dark as licorice worked
the land for free, when ebony breasts suckled ivory
mouths, when black genitalia were bred like stal
lions and forced to be receptacles for the wild oats
of antebellum, Slick's drums, ring shouts, field
hollers, spirituals even his food preferences

weren't for sale — they
were for Slick. These
trinkets softened the
foul odor of utter de
spair, sprinkling an an
imal's existence with
humanity.
Slick continued to
live for Slick, as content
as three-fifths of a a
human could be. But
word got around that
the peddler was sitting
on an item that was as
digable to George
Washington as it was
to Dred Scott. And the
crowds came. First in
timid twos and fours,
then later in bold hun
dreds. Slick couldn't
hang onto his product
long enough to get
paid. The frustrated
peddler thought, "If
they want it, let 'em
pay." Thus began the
sggressive marketing
of Black American
Culture.

Today oid Slick is
still Head Nigger In
Charge, and it's unlike
ly that the veteran mer
chant will ever bow
out. You don't bow out
after you popularize fe
male blues vocals as
Bessie Smith, bridge
the gap between rag
and jazz as pianist Jelly
Roll Morton, elevate
swing jazz to its logical
progression as Louis
Armstrong. You don't
bow out after you've
become Steppin'
Fetchit, coonish super
star; Ella Fitzgerald,
musical institution.
After your musical
contributions as Char
lie Parker, Miles Davis
and John Coltrane set
the musical establish-

mem spinning on its car like a child's toy top.
Slick is androgenous; he's übiquitous, she's all
style. Slick is every black man, woman and child
who's ever showed America the way to the aes
thetic promised land. Slick's the reason why '60s
poet Jack Kerouac wrote that he wished he was
black, the reason why little Tommy and Karen are
just as likely to don a pair of baggies and a sweat
shirt and slam with Onyx as to smell Nirvana's
teen spirit
Black is big. Black is angry. Black is beautiful.

Black is in. Black is Ice T, Ice Cube, Niggas With
Attitude, '90s niggas who can jump, dunk and
aren't paid to be role models. Black is buppy fam
ilies on NBC and angry black directors who say
fuck Hollywood, and love Malcolm X. Black is at
arm's length. Black is in a ghetto galaxy far, far
away from where you live. Black will jack your
Cabriolet at the stoplight, the Air Jordans off your
feet and the Whopper with cheese — no pickles,
no onions — out of your hand. Enjoy the visceral

playland of Black in hi-fi stereo, five minutes at a
time from the safety of your couch — it's the
American way.
Two months ago, Slick was calling his male
ego — among other things — the Hugh
es Brothers, the twin directors of "Men
ace II Society." A luridly engaging story of a
black kid's last summer in the Jordan Downs
Projects of Watts Los Angeles, it's a poorly writ
ten story with dynamic direction and cine
matography. Since Friday, Slick started using

the pseudonym John Singleton, director of'9ls
"Boyz N the 'Hood" and this summer's "Poetic
Justice," starring two more Slick personalities,
Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur.
The first, a pseudo-neo-realistic drama
about the complexities of inner-city life for
three black boys, promptly won Singleton two
Oscar nominations (best original screenplay
and best director, a first for a black director, pe
riod). The latter, a romantic comedy, has

prompted only tart disses from the very critics
who once swung from Slick Singleton's prover
bial nut sac.
Justice (Jackson) is a young hair dresser,
who expresses herself through poetry. Life in
the hood's alright until she loses her first love to
black-on-black violence. Devastated, she with
draws into herself and her poetry, until her best
friend lesha convinces her to drive to Oakland
with a couple of young black postal workers,
Chicago, lesha's dim-witted two-minute broth
er of a boyfriend, and his friend Lucky (Shakur).

As the foursome head for the Pacific Coast
Highway, an affair to remember seems unlikely.
Justice hasn't let go of her first love, and Lucky's
convinced he needs a gangsta bitch. Besides,
they're too preoccupied with making one an
other miserable. Lucky doesn't have time for
stuck-up women, "who think they're God's gift
to a muthafucka," and Justice can't stand skin
ny, bald-headed men with dirty finger nails.
But, oh, what a difference a winding road

makes. In a burst of Hol
lywood conventionality,
girl gets guy, and we're
supposed to believe that
they live happily ever
after.
Like "Menace II So
ciety," "Poetic Jus
tice" is a narrative
mess propped up by stur
dy direction. But at least
the Hughes didn't make
idle claims. They wanted
to make Singleton's debut
look like a Sunday school
picnic, and they do. John,
however, is more ambi
tious the second time out.
This is "Girlz N the
'Hood" spiced up with a
little romance to give it
sass. But Singleton's story
is neither insightful nor
engaging. It feels like a
slightly better
"Boomerang," not the
stirring cinema that
"Boyz" suggested he was
capable of.
Simply put, Slick
tricked the world into
thinking that his writing
was as solid as his direction
and then bought into the
myth, proving once again
that if there's any hype you
don't believe, it's your
own. But what has made
"Poetic" troubling for
many critics is the praise
they piled atop the relent
lessly conventional "Boyz."
The young director's film
merely confirmed the six
o'clock news: thousands of
young black males, not a
racist society, were killing
each other on a daily basis.
So white America could
shake its head sadly when
Morris Chestnut's good
natured jock ended up on
the wrong end of a sawed-

off shotgun and then go home believing they truly
understood the inner city.
Alas, "Poetic" doesn't provide that catharsis.
Aside from lacking a message as singularly reso
nant as "increase the peace," the film asks us to
return to South Central and swallow the same
kinds of events that gave us red eyes before the
street smarts of a South Central Native. There's
no moral center to hang on to. We're as vulnera
ble as the poorly written characters.. .and it's
frustrating as hell.
Damn. Slick used to take better care of us.

time from the safety of your couch — it's the
American way.
Two months ago, Slick was calling his male
ego — among other things — the Hugh
es Brothers, the twin directors of "Men
ace II Society." A luridly engaging story of a
black kid's last summer in the Jordan Downs
Projects of Watts Los Angeles, it's a poorly writ
ten story with dynamic direction and cine
matography. Since Friday, Slick started using

the pseudonym John Singleton, director of'9ls
"Boyz N the 'Hood" and this summer's "Poetic
Justice," starring two more Slick personalities,
Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur.
The first, a pseudo-neo-realistic drama
about the complexities of inner-city life for
three black boys, promptly won Singleton two
Oscar nominations (best original screenplay
and best director, a first for a black director, pe
riod). The latter, a romantic comedy, has

prompted only tart disses from the very critics
who once swung from Slick Singleton's prover
bial nut sac.
Justice (Jackson) is a young hair dresser,
who expresses herself through poetry. Life in
the hood's alright until she loses her first love to
black-on-black violence. Devastated, she with
draws into herself and her poetry, until her best
friend lesha convinces her to drive to Oakland
with a couple of young black postal workers,
Chicago, lesha's dim-witted two-minute broth
er of a boyfriend, and his friend Lucky (Shakur).

As the foursome head for the Pacific Coast
Highway, an affair to remember seems unlikely.
Justice hasn't let go of her first love, and Lucky's
convinced he needs a gangsta bitch. Besides,
they're too preoccupied with making one an
other miserable. Lucky doesn't have time for
stuck-up women, "who think they're God's gift
to a muthafucka," and Justice can't stand skin
ny, bald-headed men with dirty finger nails.
But, oh, what a difference a winding road

makes. In a burst of Hol
lywood conventionality,
girl gets guy, and we're
supposed to believe that
they live happily ever
after.
Like "Menace II So
ciety," "Poetic Jus
tice" is a narrative
mess propped up by stur
dy direction. But at least
the Hughes didn't make
idle claims. They wanted
to make Singleton's debut
look like a Sunday school
picnic, and they do. John,
however, is more ambi
tious the second time out.
This is "Girlz N the
'Hood" spiced up with a
little romance to give it
sass. But Singleton's story
is neither insightful nor
engaging. It feels like a
slightly better
"Boomerang," not the
stirring cinema that
"Boyz" suggested he was
capable of.
Simply put, Slick
tricked the world into
thinking that his writing
was as solid as his direction
and then bought into the
myth, proving once again
that if there's any hype you
don't believe, it's your
own. But what has made
"Poetic" troubling for
many critics is the praise
they piled atop the relent
lessly conventional "Boyz."
The young director's film
merely confirmed the six
o'clock news: thousands of
young black males, not a
racist society, were killing
each other on a daily basis.
So white America could
shake its head sadly when
Morris Chestnut's good
natured jock ended up on
the wrong end of a sawed-

off shotgun and then go home believing they truly
understood the inner city.
Alas, "Poetic" doesn't provide that catharsis.
Aside from lacking a message as singularly reso
nant as "increase the peace," the film asks us to
return to South Central and swallow the same
kinds of events that gave us red eyes before the
street smarts of a South Central Native. There's
no moral center to hang on to. We're as vulnera
ble as the poorly written characters.. .and it's
frustrating as hell.
Damn. Slick used to take better care of us.

Ladies and gents, say hello to Slick, a peddler
whose wonderful product has never fallen
out of favor with American pop culture.
Ages ago, when hands as dark as licorice worked
the land for free, when ebony breasts suckled ivory
mouths, when black genitalia were bred like stal
lions and forced to be receptacles for the wild oats
of antebellum, Slick's drums, ring shouts, field
hollers, spirituals even his food preferences

weren't for sale — they
were for Slick. These
trinkets softened the
foul odor of utter de
spair, sprinkling an an
imal's existence with
humanity.
Slick continued to
live for Slick, as content
as three-fifths of a a
human could be. But
word got around that
the peddler was sitting
on an item that was as
digable to George
Washington as it was
to Dred Scott. And the
crowds came. First in
timid twos and fours,
then later in bold hun
dreds. Slick couldn't
hang onto his product
long enough to get
paid. The frustrated
peddler thought, "If
they want it, let 'em
pay." Thus began the
sggressive marketing
of Black American
Culture.

Today oid Slick is
still Head Nigger In
Charge, and it's unlike
ly that the veteran mer
chant will ever bow
out. You don't bow out
after you popularize fe
male blues vocals as
Bessie Smith, bridge
the gap between rag
and jazz as pianist Jelly
Roll Morton, elevate
swing jazz to its logical
progression as Louis
Armstrong. You don't
bow out after you've
become Steppin'
Fetchit, coonish super
star; Ella Fitzgerald,
musical institution.
After your musical
contributions as Char
lie Parker, Miles Davis
and John Coltrane set
the musical establish-

mem spinning on its car like a child's toy top.
Slick is androgenous; he's übiquitous, she's all
style. Slick is every black man, woman and child
who's ever showed America the way to the aes
thetic promised land. Slick's the reason why '60s
poet Jack Kerouac wrote that he wished he was
black, the reason why little Tommy and Karen are
just as likely to don a pair of baggies and a sweat
shirt and slam with Onyx as to smell Nirvana's
teen spirit
Black is big. Black is angry. Black is beautiful.

Black is in. Black is Ice T, Ice Cube, Niggas With
Attitude, '90s niggas who can jump, dunk and
aren't paid to be role models. Black is buppy fam
ilies on NBC and angry black directors who say
fuck Hollywood, and love Malcolm X. Black is at
arm's length. Black is in a ghetto galaxy far, far
away from where you live. Black will jack your
Cabriolet at the stoplight, the Air Jordans off your
feet and the Whopper with cheese — no pickles,
no onions — out of your hand. Enjoy the visceral

playland of Black in hi-fi stereo, five minutes at a
time from the safety of your couch — it's the
American way.
