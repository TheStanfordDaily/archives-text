## Sexual conga line Chain of Desire 
### 
"Chain of Desire" may initially come off
as a porno trying to pass for high cinema. But
instead of collapsing into two hours of
"Porky's — The Adult Version," the film
thoughtfully examines the sexual mores of
modern America frightened by AIDS and the
loneliness of urban life.
Inspired by a turn-of-the-century Vien
nese play, "La Ronde," Venezuelan director
Temistocles Lopez covers a human chain
where X meets Y, who meets Z, who does A,
and so on, until C meets X, completing the
circle. We see sex as performance, sex as an
expression of love, sex as a demonstration of
lust and sex as a tool for revenge — in vary
ing human relationships that travel up and
down the social and emotional ladder.
Because it lacks a conventional plot or
protagonist, Lopez' film sometimes drifts
along aimlessly, but then grabs your atten
tion with a dash of humor or a nice character
sketch. Malcolm McDowell and Grace
Zabriskie, in particular, own the movie with
their allotted time on screen.

McDowell plays the host of a sleazy "Cur
rent Affair"-like show that features the lovers
of JFK, and feels badly about it. He's also gay,
doesn't feel bad about that and tries to keep
his regular dalliances with young male pros
titutes a secret. Zabriskie, his wife, is getting
awfully tired of the repetitious domination
routine going on between her and a friend,
and says, with perfect boredom, "I just want
to get laid."
"Chain of Desire" works best when it
doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the
more memorable scenes features a lonely
macho painter engaging in "sex at a dis
tance," representing the culmination of sex
ual paranoia in the age of AIDS.
Few of the members of the human chain
in "Chain of Desire" actually do the deed.
But the motivations and settings that estab
lish sexual situations are what interest Lopez
— not the sex act itself — and he manages to
show how sex unites the diverse group, yet at
the same time takes on a different meaning
for each person.
Though not perfect, the film succeeds in
revealing the emotional layers underlying
every sex act. But the overall tone is somber.
Barely visible within the wide shots of Man
hattan and its teeming masses, most of the
participants of the human chain seem lost,
unconnected to anyone and searching for
something deeper.
Luckily, Lopez' comedic sense helps re
lieve the heavy-handed moments, making
for some genuine entertainment rather than
health board preaching.
The talent behind "Chain of Desire" af
firms that we'll be hearing more from this
South American director.
