## Another Stakeout 
### 
"Another Stakeout" is the so-so sequel to
the slightly-better-than-so-so 1987 hit. The
original filled the typical Hollywood prescrip
tion for romance, adventure and comedy, but
it stopped a few bucks shy of success. This time
around, Rosie O'Donnell joins Emilio Estevez
and Richard Dreyfuss in their sophomoric —
although sometimes amusing — stakeout
stint.
When a witness protection assignment goes
awry, would-be mobster stool pigeon Lu De
lano (Cathy Moriarty) survives a massive ex
plosion that kills everyone else and floors her
so-called safe house. But the government des
perately needs to locate her for her key testi
mony or their case — much like the movie's
plot — becomes thinner than Oprah on Dick
Gregory's Bahamian Diet. They believe that
she's contacted a couple, the O'Haras, who live
on an island off the coast of Washington. The
obvious solution?
You got it: another stakeout.
Bill Reimers (Estevez) and Chris Lecce
(Dreyfuss) are transferred from lackluster un
dercover work to do what they do best: nothing.
Their boss, Assistant District Attorney Gina
Garrett (O'Donnell), tags along as they monitor
the harmless O'Haras from the plush house next
door. The inexperienced O'Donnell has the in
genious idea of posing as a family, which makes
for a relentless stream of "father-son" quips be
tween cop-buddies Dreyfuss and Estevez. Much
of the film's dialogue consists of an exchange of
insults and practical jokes among the three.

In a surprising turn, Dennis Farina as Mr.
O'Hara takes on a comedic role after a long
stint of playing burnt-out law enforcement of
ficers and ruthless underworld crime bosses.
His presence gives a much-needed lift to the
film's somewhat flat and all-too-familiar
comic exchanges.

Farina can't free "Another
Stakeout" from its mire of
ridiculousness, including
cops shooting at other
cops and, most tragically,
the destruction of a beau
tiful, new cherry-red Mer
cedes convertible.

Despite his noble attempt, however, Farina
can't free "Another Stakeout" from its mire of
ridiculousness, including cops shooting at
other cops and, most tragically, the destruction
of a beautiful, new cherry-red Mercedes con
vertible in a scene highly reminiscent of the
dock disaster in "Risky Business."
In fact, "Another Stakeout" borrowed
scenes and lines from several past Hollywood
mainstays, including one of Dreyfuss' own —
"The Goodbye Girl." Unfortunately, its juve
nile stunts and predictable humor prevent it
from filling the comic shoes of past classics.
While it's good for a few laughs, on the whole,
"Another Stakeout" is yet another case of the
sequel that couldn't.
