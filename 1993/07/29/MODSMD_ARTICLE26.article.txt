## Tne Bard is back Twelfth Night 
### 
Given just two weeks since closing their
two-week run of "Equus," Stanford's Red
Hoop Players have put together a tight, in
ventive production of "Twelfth Night," a
Shakespearean comedy that works best out
side, in the summer and for free.
Set in the present, but otherwise unadul
terated, the Red Hoop Players are able to in
clude the audience on the fun they are obvi
ously having performing on the little pas
toral stage they carved for themselves near
the Business School.

The cast flirts, climbs trees
and drives a jeep through
the middle of the stage, giv
ing direct interpretation to
the farfetched, uncon
trolled plot. There's even a
clever reference to their
"Equus" performance — a
friendly wink to the faithful
among the audience.

"Twelfth Night" combines the best plot
devices of Shakespearean comedy: cross
dressing, twins and love triangles. Viola

dresses up as a man (Cesario) so she can
serve Orsino, with whom she is in love.
Orsino sends her to hit on Olivia, who then
falls in love with Viola, much to her cha
grin. Meanwhile, Viola's long-lost twin
brother, who looks just like Viola as Ce
sario, shows up. As a subplot, the petty
bourgeois play a practical joke on Malvo
lio, Olivia's servant. It all ads up to a long,
confusing episode of "Three's Company"
with snappy dialogue.
The cast flirts, climbs trees and drives a
jeep through the middle of the stage, giving
direct interpretation to the farfetched, un
controlled plot. There's even a clever refer
ence to their "Equus" performance — a
friendly wink to the faithful among the audi
ence.
Adam Tobin and lan McCrudden bring a

cartoon-like comedy to Sir Andrew
Aguecheek and Sir Toby Belch. Without
completely oversimplifying their characters,
Tobin and McCrudden dutifully play them
to their full potential; Tobin, psyching him
self up for a fight, borrows from De Niro in
"Taxi Driver" and the boxing kangaroo from
Bugs Bunny.
Dan Hunt, as Sebastian, brings an air of
clarity and professionalism that, as he always
does, just runs short of stealing the play. As
the countess Olivia, Eve Conant offers a stage
presence that keeps some of the otherwise
hectic scenes together.
Where some of the actors fall short, the
others quickly pick them up. Clark Jackson
occasionally overplays the comedy of the vil
lanously idiotic Malvolio, but the perfor
mances of the ensemble force the audience to

fall on the side of laughter instead of criticism.
Student director Alexandra d'Arbeloff
is creative throughout, but most adept at
staging action during some of the longer,
more droll speeches of the comedy — al
most erasing them from text.
The setting, direction and perfor
mances give the play an air of intimacy that
cannot be achieved in a larger, indoor per
formance. The group works well together
and succeeds where too many other, more
Broadwayesque performances fail — they
interact with the audience. And best of all,
as David Letterman too often says, "Hey,
it's not like you paid for these tickets." And,
like at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, there's nothing
else going on around campus during the
summer.
