## Editorial Cleaning the slate It's summer, and the heat is on the incoming COP 
### 
The council of
Presidents is back,
and they need to be
better than ever. Because if
they're not, less than one
year from now, the student
body they represent is going
to boot them out of existence
once again.
But even though they're
not quite out of the gate,
they're already off to a bad
start. Faced with no opposi
tion in the spring election
the new COP didn't bother
to present much of a plat
form other than "We're free,
what's the worst we can do?"
Instead of putting together
a coherent strategy after being
elected, the new COP took it
upon itself to appoint a Cabi
net — just like real politi
cians, but without the messy
Senate approval process.
The Cabinet sounds just
like the kind of bureaucratic
resume-packing that an
noyed the student body
enough to elect-just two
years ago-the "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate in the ulti
mate vote of no-confidence.
In order for the 1993-94
COP to succeed against the
unbridled resentiment of the
campus, it will have to pull a
James K. Polk and delineate
three or four clear objectives
that it can accomplish by the
end of the year. And forming
a Cabinet doesn't count as
one of them.
In fact, the COP would do
well to downplay the Cabinet
and instead concentrate on
retaining the ASSU Senate
committees established dur
ing the "Prefer" era. The

committees, running against
the grain of past senates, felt
empowered enough to do
more than create more triv
ial election rules.
Working with the senate
committees, the COP could
accomplish concrete results if
it concentrates its efforts on
more long-term projects. The
only lasting success stories to
come out of the ASSU are
Flicks, Lecture Notes, Type
and Design and the Ad
Agency. The COP would do
well to augment these enter
prises with a summer storage
plan and a revival of its failed
Beat the Bookstore project.
As a final project a group
of students wrote a program
allowing students to buy and
sell used textbooks over the
network. Using this technol
ogy, the ASSU could give the
Bookstore — and its lacklus
ter buy-back policy — a run
for its money.
The Publications Board
also needs reinvigoration,
with firm ASSU support.
Upstart publications need
both financial and institu
tional support if they are to
continue to flourish.
In order to regain further
support, the COP must rec
ognize and understand the
graduate student body.
Graduate students should
be allowed to vote separately
on special fee requests for
graduate programs and reg
ularly consulted about their
specific needs.
The COP is going to have
to act quickly enough and
loudly enough that the cam
pus will have to take notice.
If it doesn't, someone just a
shade more serious than "I
Prefer" is going to demolish
student government beyond
all hope of recovery. And, given
the success of many ASSU ser
vices, that would be a waste of
considerable potential.
