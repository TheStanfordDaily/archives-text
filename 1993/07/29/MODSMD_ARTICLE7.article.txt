Think fast, what's the
chemical formula for cyto
sine? Who wrote "The
Oresteia?" Conjugate the irregu
lar verb tenir. Quote the first 16
lines of "The Canterbury Tales."
In Middle English, of course.
Admit it. You like being smart.
You're disgusted by people who
aren't as smart as you are. You're
turned on by people who are even
smarter. Knowledge, not power, is
the greatest aphrodisiac. Omni
science, not immortality, is the ul
timate goal. That's why you
picked Stanford, right? It certain
ly wasn't because of the low, bar
gain tuition price.
We're here because there's
nowhere else for us to go. We've
literally outsmarted not only our
high school friends, but also our
high school teachers, our parents
and a huge percentage of the gen
eral population.
Here, excellence is the par.
Stanford has the highest concen
tration of high school valedictori
ans, future astronauts and people
who've read "Walden" west of,
well, Walden. Our combined SAT
scores exceed the total population
of Australia. We're so well-round
ed, we bounce.
Think all college students get
The New York Times? C-SPAN?
Dennis Miller's jokes? Think again.

But in becoming intellectual,
we've become inaccessible, except
to equally inaccessible people —
namely, each other. Look at the
ever-growing number of alumni
couples. After all, why read "The
Epic of Gilgamesh" if you can't
play "Enkidu Meets The Harlot"
with your mate?
You'll certainly never play it
with anyone else. In between here
and Harvard, there's a whole
world of people who just don't care
about systemic hydrogeology, in
fantile sleep disorders or manifes
tations of lovesickness in 18th
century English literature and
culture.
We came to Stanford to broad
en our horizons; instead, we've be
come increasingly focused. Rather
than sharing the wealth of our
knowledge, we've isolated our
selves. The ivory tower has high
walls and tiny, tiny windows.
Wait until you go back home —
or, worse, into the work force —
and find yourself suddenly having
to spell out all those Nietzsche ref
erences. Tell people you go to
Stanford and they'll grow timid
and incredulous, saying things
like "Why are you working here?",
"Where's that?" or my personal
favorite, "You must be a genius."
You'll suddenly feel the need to
apologize for your education, or at

least defend it. You'll sheepishly
admit that you can't flunk a class
at Stanford. Most of us take an
it's-a-dirty-job-but-somebody's
got-to-do-it attitude. But, deep
down, we're fiercely protective of
our education, no matter how
cavalierly we disparage it at wed
ding receptions and family re
unions.
Maybe it's because we were en
vied and ostracized in high
school. Maybe it's because,
dammit, we actually worked hard
for this. Or maybe we put on
snobbish intellectual airs just be
cause we can.
But if all we take away from
Stanford is a red sweatshirt, a box
of old CIV books and a vague sense
of superiority, we've missed the
point. A college degree is not — nor
should it be — a status symbol.
Robert Frost wrote that educa
tion is the ability to listen to al
most anything without losing
your temper or your self-confi
dence. By that definition, we still
have much to learn.
