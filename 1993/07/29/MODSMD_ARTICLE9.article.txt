## Fiberoptic network may make scholarly sound bite of school 
### 
It gave me a start to read in
The Weekly (July 15) that Stan
ford has bought a fiberoptic
broadcasting system so as to en
able Stanford and Hoover experts
to appear on TV news programs
more quickly.
Stanford has become "the first
American university to enter the
world of fiberoptic networking."
Why? Because, according to Jack
Hubbard of Stanford News Ser
vice, "now it is just as easy for
Ted Koppel to get to us as it is for
him to get to someone at Yale,
Harvard, MIT or Caltech."
But what is it we are compet
ing for? Apparently, the chance
for a Stanford expert to give a 10-
second sound bite before a Har
vard expert can.
Since commercial TV news

broadcasts are known to put a
premium on brevity and speed
even when a situation requires
more complex analysis, Stan
ford's new venture is disconcert
ing.
Making a virtue of deadline
impelled reactions diminishes the
careful research and the weighing
of evidence, surely not always in
time to make the evening news.
It is possible that some Stan
ford and Hoover experts will
enjoy becoming household names
because of their skill at making
quickie TV commentaries. But I
hope the majority will stick to
their functions as scholars and
teachers, whose studies may lead
them to be social critics, but
hardly TV stars.
Meanwhile, two questions re
main: 1) How can Stanford afford
a new communications network
when it has had to cut back on
such items as library service and
the performing arts program?
and, 2) Will good looks and an ex

pensive haircut become require
ments for tenure?
