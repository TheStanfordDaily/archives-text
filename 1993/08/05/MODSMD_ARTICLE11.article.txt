# 'THE WELSH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY PASSIONATE.'
## A 						Conversation With: JEAN FETTER 
### 
~T~\orn in Wales, Jean Fetter "read"
physics at Oxford University. After
JLJ marrying an American Rhodes
Scholar, she came to the United States in
1962. She has worked at universities since
then, teaching physics for eight years at
San Jose State before coming to Stanford
when her husband received an invitation to
join the Physics Department.
At the Farm, "Dean Jean " has held a va
riety of administrative positions, serving
as associate director of the Center for
Teaching and Learning, special assistant
to President Richard Lyman, as well as her
best known position, dean of undergradu
ate admissions, from 1984 to 1991.
She was also executive vice-chairman of
the search committee that chose Gerhard
Casper to replace Donald Kennedy as Stan -
ford's president. She is now the special as
sistant to President Casper and is working
on a book about her experiences in college
admissions. In a recent interview, Fetter
discussed her career at Stanford with
Stanford Weekly staff writer Ali
Rowghani.
SW: How is the book that you are writing
on your experiences as dean of undergrad
uate admissions coming along ?
Fetter: Over there on my desk are the first
three chapters. It's an eight chapter book
and my tentative title is "Questions and
Admissions: Reflections on 100,000 Ad
missions Decisions at Stanford." It's not a
book about how to get into Stanford, but
rather all of the kinds of criteria for admis
sions — the kinds of things deans of admis
sions don't usually talk about.
SW: What are these criteria that influence
an admissions department?
Fetter: You are given the fundamental
policies which are determined by a faculty
committee. It isn't the whim of the admis
sions dean whom you select or how you se
lect a freshman class. There is a committee
on undergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid on which three students serve, and
the first year that I was in the job I asked
the committee to please provide us with an
unambiguous statement of criteria for ad
mission to Stanford.
You probably don't remember from
your application booklet, but there is a one
page description of these criteria for ad
mission. Roughly they are academic
achievement and potential, achievement
outside the classroom and personal quali
ties.
And it was then my job to select a class
from 14,000 applicants a year — except the
first year I was on the job, when there were
17, 652 applicants, a number which will
forever be emblazoned on my heart. Those
are the guidelines, but how you set about
translating the policy into action is really a
personal decision.
SW: What personal qualities did you value
in applicants? What types of personal
virtues did you like to see among the un
dergraduates at Stanford?
Fetter: One of the things that is extraor
dinary in the Stanford applicant pool is the
number of young men and women at the
age of 17 who have really triumphed in ad
versity. And so a trite answer would be
those who have been resilient in their per
sonal circumstances.
But not everybody has had an opportu
nity to show their resilience. If you grow up
in a comfortable, middle-class family in a
community which provides you with a
whole array of opportunities, how can you
measure up in the same way? So every stu
dent has different circumstances, and
what will be admirable in students is dif
ferent in each case.
One classic example is a young man who
had been a Cambodian refugee, separated
from his parents at the age of 10 and kept
in a refugee camp for two years. He made
his way through the jungles of Cambodia,

living off the duck eggs from the duck that
he carried in his backpack. And he some
how got to Hawaii, went to high school
there, and finally transferred to an East
ern prep school. Well that is an extraordi
nary profile. So each situation is very dif
ferent. That's why I really prize the special
attention that we at Stanford give to all ap
plicants, with three different readers for
each application.
So resilience in adversity, as well as love
of learning, intellectual curiosity, sense of
humor and independence are qualities that
I personally value and wish to see in Stan
ford students.
SW: How much does Stanford's location
and climate help or hurt the attraction of
applicants?
Fetter: I think that Stanford's location is
certainly an asset, but I would not rank it
high on my list of why Stanford is distinc
tive. Related to our California location is
the fact that Stanford is a pioneering insti
tution. It was founded 100 years ago,
whereas the Ivies were founded 300 years
ago. I went to an institution that was
founded in the 13th Century.
But Stanford has been a pioneer right
from the beginning since Stanford has al

ways been co-educational. So the spirit
here is very different from Harvard,
Princeton or Yale, who became co-educa
tional only 15 years ago. The very spirit of
the place has been one of egalitarianism
from its very inception. As one Harvard
sociologist said, Stanford is like "a rising
meteor" . . . and I think Stanford is still
finding its place nationally and interna
tionally.
SW: From your interaction with President
Casper, what issues do you feel are most
important to him ?
Fetter: This first year was full of chal
lenges of formidable dimensions, but 1
think that he is narrowing his focus for
this coming year, although "narrowing"
may be too optimistic a description. I know
that on his priority list for the coming year
is the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation, the financial state of the University
and the Medical Center Task Force
SW: Do you think that Stanford students
are less intellectual than their peers at Ivy
League schools ?
Fetter: Well, this raises one of the puzzles
of higher education Thirty years ago, 1
mvself was an undergraduate at Oxford I

have also known many students at Stan
ford. And both of these institutions — the
two that I know the best — have had
charges of anti-intellectualism. When I
was an undergraduate at Oxford it was ex
actly the same thing, and we were the top
four percent in the country.
The Harvard alumni magazine two
years ago published an article by a Har
vard undergraduate about anti-intellectu
alism at Harvard. Now what is it about the
qualities of these very successful students
at these very selective institutions that
makes them so self-critical? I've heard the
same charges at the other two institutions
that I know, so I don't think Stanford is
very different, although it may be differ
ent at the margins.
SW: If we were to agree that there is an el
ement of anti-intellectualism at Stanford,
what can the University do to correct it?
Fetter: This is another puzzle. When I
first became dean, this charge of anti-in
tellectualism existed at Stanford. Stan
ford students weren't intellectual
enough, so I should admit students who
were "intellectual." The Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid placed a high premium on academic
achievement. They also wanted us to
focus on students of extreme intellectual
ability. For example, the Math Depart
ment wanted to get involved in the selec
tion of potential math majors, and, in fact,
the math faculty reads about 450 files per
year selecting math talent for us. When
that hit The Daily, you wouldn't believe
the concerns raised by Stanford students
that this environment was somehow
going to change in such a way that would
transform the University into a place that
they no longer knew and loved.
When I went to talk to alumni and told
them that we were focusing on students of
extreme academic ability, it was somehow
extremely threatening to them. . .. This is
part of the puzzle of Stanford and higher
education in general — that there are al
ways elements of self-criticism, and when
you change, it threatens people and institu
tions.
SW: So you do not believe that Stanford
students are any more anti-intellectual
than other comparable institutions?
Fetter: No, but there is a segment of the
class here that says this is an anti-intellec
tual place and Harvard and Yale are not,
and this myth gets proliferated from class
to class. I find it the most frustrating thing
of all to deal with because I know what the
admissions statistics look like. In the seven
years that I was dean of admissions, the
only university that has a net gain in ad
mitted students over us was Harvard. Yale,
Princeton and MIT all had net losses to us.
So I can't believe that the students are any
different.
SW: What do you feel the goal of under
graduate education should be?
Fetter: My personal advice to my advisees
is to choose something that you love to
study. And if you can't find something you
love here, it's a sad commentary, because
the opportunities available are so incredi
ble. . . . Choose something you love, and
everything will follow. Choose something
that you have a passion for.
On reflection, one of the sad observa
tions that I would have about youth would
be that very few people have passions in
their lives. I happen to be Welsh and the
Welsh are supposed to be very passionate
about things. I come from Dylan Thomas'
home town. Butyou should find something
that you feel very strongly about, and I
don't care what it is as long as you give it
your all.
So you choose something you love, and
the institution provides you with a won
derful array of opportunities in which you
can become intellectually challenged
