# GRAD STUDENT LITE
## Does Stanford coddle its humanities graduate students? 
### Ali Rowghani 
Long before George Bush's first presidential cam
paign, Stanford's humanities departments dedicated
themselves to creating a kinder, gentler graduate
program through a non-competitive and egalitarian ap
proach to funding graduate students.
At Stanford, most humanities departments, including
the Departments of English, History, Comparative Litera
ture, and Modern Thought and Literature, have always
admitted relatively few graduate students because they
have chosen to fund them all on a non-competitive and
egalitarian basis.
Thus, while Stanford may not award as much money as
some others schools award to the students whom they
most esteem, most of Stanford's humanities departments
fund all of the graduate students that they accept.
In the high-stakes world of academia, where politics
and money sometimes seem at odds with scholarly cooper
ation, Stanford's nurturing approach is catching on. But
while the University's graduate students maintain that
the absence of competition creates a constructive environ
ment for learning, others warn against the dangers of ex
cessive coddling.
With more students wary of the job market and less
funds available for professorships, graduate programs in
the humanities are making difficult financial decisions.
And as the premium on careers in the humanities increas
es, the importance of this debate over the optimal method
of challenging Ph.D. candidates has become an essential
issue for the future of American higher education.
Sharing the wealth
Stanford's non-competitive funding policy means that
all of Stanford's graduate students in these depart
ments receive four-year fellowships which cover their
tuition expenses and provide them with stipends of ap
proximately $10,000.
Students who need fifth-year support may compete for
an additional year's funding through the Mellon "Time-to-
Degree" Program initiated to subsidize graduate students
for a fifth year in order to expedite the completion of their
dissertations. Stanford's humanities departments, there
fore, do not admit any graduate students whom they can
not fund, nor do their financial awards differ markedly in
amount.
According to graduate students who chose to attend
Stanford rather than other institutions, this type of
across-the-board non-competitive funding policy is dis
tinctive.
Unlike Stanford's more egalitarian approach, most hu
manities departments in comparable private institutions
offer gradated or competitive funding. Both these methods
base financial support on the scholastic merit of the stu
dent.
Graduate students studying in the Departments of His
tory, English, Comparative Literature and Modern
Thought and Literature at Stanford overwhelmingly pre
fer Stanford's funding policy to the gradated and competi
tive funding policies which predominate at most other
universities.
In fact, these students often cite Stanford's non-com
petitive approach as a chief reason that they decided to
pursue doctoral degrees at Stanford instead of at other in
stitutions.
According to David Schmid, a fifth year graduate stu
dent in the Modern Thought and Literature Ph.D. pro
gram, competitive funding policies impact the social and in
tellectual atmosphere of departments in a deleterious way.
"There is no question that non-competitive funding cre
ates a more convivial atmosphere among the students,"
Schmid said. "I have friends and colleagues at Columbia
and I know that their competitive funding situation total
ly transforms student-student and student-faculty rela
tionships.
"At Stanford, there is a greater willingness to share
work and ideas and it is easier to interrelate with faculty
because you don't have to try so hard to impress them."
Stanford's non-competitive and egalitarian approach
engenders a congenial intellectual atmosphere that has

fringe benefits. Some graduate students, in fact, turn
down larger financial packages from other universities in
order to study at Stanford for these very reasons.
Janet Kobrin, who recently finished her second year of
graduate work in the Department of History, is one such
student who passed up a more lucrative package to pursue
her Ph.D. at Stanford.
"I was offered more money by other places," she said,
"but one of the reasons I decided to come to Stanford was
that the History Department really fostered a sense of
community.
"We do things with each other and know each others
names," she added. "I think that a lot of that is because the
funding here is non-competitive. It makes the whole at
mosphere a lot more relaxed."
Kobrin also said that the History Department's reason
able teaching assistant load, as compared to the heavier
load at public institutions like the UC-Berkeley was an
other factor in her decision to attend Stanford.
Problem of preparation?
But is this more relaxed and congenial intellectual at
mosphere, created by Stanford's non-competitive
funding, beneficial to academic achievement and

production on the part of graduate students? Moreover,
does Stanford's emphasis on non-competition among its
students adequately prepare them for the bitterly compet
itive job market?
Prof. Seth Lerer, director of graduate studies in the
English Department, is not convinced of the superiority of
Stanford's approach.
"At Stanford, everyone is admitted with the same fund
ing package to avoid the competitive jockeying that you
have at other institutions," he said. "My guess is that the
different approaches (competitive versus non-competi
tive 1 are largely ideological."
Lerer illustrated the philosophical gulf between Stan
ford and other schools. "I was a graduate student at Chica
go and I taught at Princeton before coming here," he said.
"At those institutions, competition was seen to be a good
thing, because at the end, you got individuals who had
been honed on the whetstone of economic competition."
He added that there are "virtues and vices," to both ap
proaches. "Here, first-year graduate students are not wor
ried or anxious about maintaining a level of performance.
By the end of their time here, they become inured in a non
competitive coddling environment that may not prepare
them very well for the aggressive job market, not to men
tion for life as an assistant professor at an institution that

does not guarantee tenure."
Lerer's view, though certainly credible, seems to be in
the minority, both within Stanford and at other institu
tions that have a notoriously cut-throat image.
New directions
Institutions that offer competitive funding packages
admit a larger number of students than they plan to
support for more than one year. After the first year of
study, the departments select a handful of students whom
they will fund for four or five more years.
According to Stanford students in the English and His
tory Departments, Columbia University and the Universi
ty of Chicago are notorious for their cut-throat competi
tive funding policies.
In fact, the English Department at Columbia Univer
sity dramatically altered its funding policies four years
ago in response to student anxiety. Previously, according
to English Masters of Arts Coordinator Nigel Gibson, C o
lumbia's English Department annually administered a
competitive review of its graduate students in order to
determine the shapes and sizes of their funding pack
age.
The process is still competitive, but only in the first year

when about 35 graduate students are working towards
their master's degrees. Of these students, approximately
30 are admitted, based on merit, into the doctoral program
and are funded for four to five more years, according to
Gibson.
As a result of Columbia's new initiative to fund all of its
English doctoral candidates at roughly equal levels, the
program has shrunk considerably, said Gibson.
Gibson also said that the previous system of competi
tive funding had more serious problems.
"The system before was unfair, because it created a tier
of funding." she said "On one level, there was five years of
funding for the 'elite' students and little or no funding for
the rest. Then, all of our students were subject to a yearly
review, which often came to resemble a horse-trading ses
sion. From the view of both the faculty and the students, it
was a very tendentious process."
Several departments nationwide, including the Knglish
and History Departments at the University of Chicago,
however, continue to admit two or three times the stu
dents that they can fund
But according to Hick Hefley, assistant dean of stu
dents in the School of Social Sciences, even the Universi
ty of Chicago is moving towards a more non-competitive
funding system Hefley said that other equally presti

gious departments, like political science, have responded
to student pressure to adopt more non-competitive
schemes.
Hefley admits that the policies at Chicago create more
anxiety, but denies that admitting non-funded students
along with heavily subsidized students creates a hostile in
tellectual environment.
According to Julius Kirshner, Professor of Medieval
History at Chicago, whose department accepts twice as
many students as it can fund, humanities departments
have an obligation to reduce the enrollment in their grad
uate programs because of the increasingly sluggish acade
mic job market.
"Some people in the department, including myself,"
said Kirshner, "would prefer admitting only students with
funding. Given the soft market at this time, it doesn't
seem justifiable for us to continue to award so many
Ph.D.s to students who very well may not be able to find
jobs."
Naturaler selection
Though perhaps not at the University of Chicago,
universities like Columbia seem to be moving in the
direction of downsizing their departments and im
plementing more non-competitive funding policies. In
fact, as Nigel Gibson said, Columbia's admissions process
became much more rigorous when they decided to accept
fewer students, but to fund them all.
Stanford's graduate students, like English Ph.D. candi
date Gene Suarez, who served on the department's gradu
ate admissions committee last year, say that they would
trade a more competitive admissions process for a less
competitive environment in graduate school.
"I don't believe in 'trial by fire' theories," said seventh
year English Ph.D. candidate G.E. Light. "It is very com
petitive to get in, and if the admissions people do their jobs,
they should admit people who are already very dedicated
and intelligent, so there's no real need to have that kind of
competition once we are all here."
The non-competitive funding scheme, by most ac
counts, creates an easier working relationship with facul
ty members that students appreciate. They generally
enjoy the type of nurturing environment that Lerer fears
will leave them less competitive in the job market than
gome of their peers at institutions that encourage more
competition.
Said first-year history graduate student Lynne Hirsch:
"I think that what people mean by coddling is that we get
a lot of attention, and we should. We need it. But there is
no one leading you around. So we become less embittered
toward the process because we're not subject to the same
Social Darwinism."
The road ahead
Graduate programs in the humanities around the
country seem to be evolving to fit their students'
preferences. America's most notoriously competi
tive graduate schools, like Columbia and Chicago's Eng
lish and History programs, are becoming more responsive
to student demands for less competitive funding, but for
more selective admissions leading to smaller depart
ments.
University of Chicago's Kirshner described this evo
lution, as well as the need for a more nurturing envi
ronment, in order to educate the scholars of the 21st
Century.
"When I was in graduate school in the 60s, they used a
lot of military language to make us 'hit the ground run
ning.' But intellectual fashions are changing so rapidly
that you have to prepare students to meet the new inter
disciplinary character of scholarship," he said.
"Getting students into shape used to be the prevailing
attitude, but now we try to be much more welcoming and
nurturing to our students. This philosophy of progress
through competition may work very well in the sciences
where you're trying to win a Nobel Prize, but in the hu
manities it is retrograde." ♦

Though perhaps not at the University of Chicago,
universities like Columbia seem to be moving in the
direction of downsizing their departments and im
plementing more non-competitive funding policies. In
fact, as Nigel Gibson said, Columbia's admissions process
became much more rigorous when they decided to accept
fewer students, but to fund them all.
Stanford's graduate students, like English Ph.D. candi
date Gene Suarez, who served on the department's gradu
ate admissions committee last year, say that they would
trade a more competitive admissions process for a less
competitive environment in graduate school.
"I don't believe in 'trial by fire' theories," said seventh
year English Ph.D. candidate G.E. Light. "It is very com
petitive to get in, and if the admissions people do their jobs,
they should admit people who are already very dedicated
and intelligent, so there's no real need to have that kind of
competition once we are all here."
The non-competitive funding scheme, by most ac
counts, creates an easier working relationship with facul
ty members that students appreciate. They generally
enjoy the type of nurturing environment that Lerer fears
will leave them less competitive in the job market than
gome of their peers at institutions that encourage more
competition.
Said first-year history graduate student Lynne Hirsch:
"I think that what people mean by coddling is that we get
a lot of attention, and we should. We need it. But there is
no one leading you around. So we become less embittered
toward the process because we're not subject to the same
Social Darwinism."
The road ahead
Graduate programs in the humanities around the
country seem to be evolving to fit their students'
preferences. America's most notoriously competi
tive graduate schools, like Columbia and Chicago's Eng
lish and History programs, are becoming more responsive
to student demands for less competitive funding, but for
more selective admissions leading to smaller depart
ments.
University of Chicago's Kirshner described this evo
lution, as well as the need for a more nurturing envi
ronment, in order to educate the scholars of the 21st
Century.
"When I was in graduate school in the 60s, they used a
lot of military language to make us 'hit the ground run
ning.' But intellectual fashions are changing so rapidly
that you have to prepare students to meet the new inter
disciplinary character of scholarship," he said.
"Getting students into shape used to be the prevailing
attitude, but now we try to be much more welcoming and
nurturing to our students. This philosophy of progress
through competition may work very well in the sciences
where you're trying to win a Nobel Prize, but in the hu
manities it is retrograde." ♦

Fourth-year English Ph.D. Candidate Gene Suarez reclines at the English Department's graduate library, studying in preparation for his orals this winter. Suarez, who sits on the department's admissions committee, says he prefers a more se
lective admissions process for graduate students to the "trial by fire" approach of other universities, where students are weeded out as they advance toward a doctorate.
Long before George Bush's first presidential cam
paign, Stanford's humanities departments dedicated
themselves to creating a kinder, gentler graduate
program through a non-competitive and egalitarian ap
proach to funding graduate students.
At Stanford, most humanities departments, including
the Departments of English, History, Comparative Litera
ture, and Modern Thought and Literature, have always
admitted relatively few graduate students because they
have chosen to fund them all on a non-competitive and
egalitarian basis.
Thus, while Stanford may not award as much money as
some others schools award to the students whom they
most esteem, most of Stanford's humanities departments
fund all of the graduate students that they accept.
In the high-stakes world of academia, where politics
and money sometimes seem at odds with scholarly cooper
ation, Stanford's nurturing approach is catching on. But
while the University's graduate students maintain that
the absence of competition creates a constructive environ
ment for learning, others warn against the dangers of ex
cessive coddling.
With more students wary of the job market and less
funds available for professorships, graduate programs in
the humanities are making difficult financial decisions.
And as the premium on careers in the humanities increas
es, the importance of this debate over the optimal method
of challenging Ph.D. candidates has become an essential
issue for the future of American higher education.
Sharing the wealth
Stanford's non-competitive funding policy means that
all of Stanford's graduate students in these depart
ments receive four-year fellowships which cover their
tuition expenses and provide them with stipends of ap
proximately $10,000.
Students who need fifth-year support may compete for
an additional year's funding through the Mellon "Time-to-
Degree" Program initiated to subsidize graduate students
for a fifth year in order to expedite the completion of their
dissertations. Stanford's humanities departments, there
fore, do not admit any graduate students whom they can
not fund, nor do their financial awards differ markedly in
amount.
According to graduate students who chose to attend
Stanford rather than other institutions, this type of
across-the-board non-competitive funding policy is dis
tinctive.
Unlike Stanford's more egalitarian approach, most hu
manities departments in comparable private institutions
offer gradated or competitive funding. Both these methods
base financial support on the scholastic merit of the stu
dent.
Graduate students studying in the Departments of His
tory, English, Comparative Literature and Modern
Thought and Literature at Stanford overwhelmingly pre
fer Stanford's funding policy to the gradated and competi
tive funding policies which predominate at most other
universities.
In fact, these students often cite Stanford's non-com
petitive approach as a chief reason that they decided to
pursue doctoral degrees at Stanford instead of at other in
stitutions.
According to David Schmid, a fifth year graduate stu
dent in the Modern Thought and Literature Ph.D. pro
gram, competitive funding policies impact the social and in
tellectual atmosphere of departments in a deleterious way.
"There is no question that non-competitive funding cre
ates a more convivial atmosphere among the students,"
Schmid said. "I have friends and colleagues at Columbia
and I know that their competitive funding situation total
ly transforms student-student and student-faculty rela
tionships.
"At Stanford, there is a greater willingness to share
work and ideas and it is easier to interrelate with faculty
because you don't have to try so hard to impress them."
Stanford's non-competitive and egalitarian approach
engenders a congenial intellectual atmosphere that has

fringe benefits. Some graduate students, in fact, turn
down larger financial packages from other universities in
order to study at Stanford for these very reasons.
Janet Kobrin, who recently finished her second year of
graduate work in the Department of History, is one such
student who passed up a more lucrative package to pursue
her Ph.D. at Stanford.
"I was offered more money by other places," she said,
"but one of the reasons I decided to come to Stanford was
that the History Department really fostered a sense of
community.
"We do things with each other and know each others
names," she added. "I think that a lot of that is because the
funding here is non-competitive. It makes the whole at
mosphere a lot more relaxed."
Kobrin also said that the History Department's reason
able teaching assistant load, as compared to the heavier
load at public institutions like the UC-Berkeley was an
other factor in her decision to attend Stanford.
Problem of preparation?
But is this more relaxed and congenial intellectual at
mosphere, created by Stanford's non-competitive
funding, beneficial to academic achievement and

production on the part of graduate students? Moreover,
does Stanford's emphasis on non-competition among its
students adequately prepare them for the bitterly compet
itive job market?
Prof. Seth Lerer, director of graduate studies in the
English Department, is not convinced of the superiority of
Stanford's approach.
"At Stanford, everyone is admitted with the same fund
ing package to avoid the competitive jockeying that you
have at other institutions," he said. "My guess is that the
different approaches (competitive versus non-competi
tive 1 are largely ideological."
Lerer illustrated the philosophical gulf between Stan
ford and other schools. "I was a graduate student at Chica
go and I taught at Princeton before coming here," he said.
"At those institutions, competition was seen to be a good
thing, because at the end, you got individuals who had
been honed on the whetstone of economic competition."
He added that there are "virtues and vices," to both ap
proaches. "Here, first-year graduate students are not wor
ried or anxious about maintaining a level of performance.
By the end of their time here, they become inured in a non
competitive coddling environment that may not prepare
them very well for the aggressive job market, not to men
tion for life as an assistant professor at an institution that

does not guarantee tenure."
Lerer's view, though certainly credible, seems to be in
the minority, both within Stanford and at other institu
tions that have a notoriously cut-throat image.
New directions
Institutions that offer competitive funding packages
admit a larger number of students than they plan to
support for more than one year. After the first year of
study, the departments select a handful of students whom
they will fund for four or five more years.
According to Stanford students in the English and His
tory Departments, Columbia University and the Universi
ty of Chicago are notorious for their cut-throat competi
tive funding policies.
In fact, the English Department at Columbia Univer
sity dramatically altered its funding policies four years
ago in response to student anxiety. Previously, according
to English Masters of Arts Coordinator Nigel Gibson, C o
lumbia's English Department annually administered a
competitive review of its graduate students in order to
determine the shapes and sizes of their funding pack
age.
The process is still competitive, but only in the first year

when about 35 graduate students are working towards
their master's degrees. Of these students, approximately
30 are admitted, based on merit, into the doctoral program
and are funded for four to five more years, according to
Gibson.
As a result of Columbia's new initiative to fund all of its
English doctoral candidates at roughly equal levels, the
program has shrunk considerably, said Gibson.
Gibson also said that the previous system of competi
tive funding had more serious problems.
"The system before was unfair, because it created a tier
of funding." she said "On one level, there was five years of
funding for the 'elite' students and little or no funding for
the rest. Then, all of our students were subject to a yearly
review, which often came to resemble a horse-trading ses
sion. From the view of both the faculty and the students, it
was a very tendentious process."
Several departments nationwide, including the Knglish
and History Departments at the University of Chicago,
however, continue to admit two or three times the stu
dents that they can fund
But according to Hick Hefley, assistant dean of stu
dents in the School of Social Sciences, even the Universi
ty of Chicago is moving towards a more non-competitive
funding system Hefley said that other equally presti

gious departments, like political science, have responded
to student pressure to adopt more non-competitive
schemes.
Hefley admits that the policies at Chicago create more
anxiety, but denies that admitting non-funded students
along with heavily subsidized students creates a hostile in
tellectual environment.
According to Julius Kirshner, Professor of Medieval
History at Chicago, whose department accepts twice as
many students as it can fund, humanities departments
have an obligation to reduce the enrollment in their grad
uate programs because of the increasingly sluggish acade
mic job market.
"Some people in the department, including myself,"
said Kirshner, "would prefer admitting only students with
funding. Given the soft market at this time, it doesn't
seem justifiable for us to continue to award so many
Ph.D.s to students who very well may not be able to find
jobs."

tions that have a notoriously cut-throat image.
New directions
Institutions that offer competitive funding packages
admit a larger number of students than they plan to
support for more than one year. After the first year of
study, the departments select a handful of students whom
they will fund for four or five more years.
According to Stanford students in the English and His
tory Departments, Columbia University and the Universi
ty of Chicago are notorious for their cut-throat competi
tive funding policies.
In fact, the English Department at Columbia Univer
sity dramatically altered its funding policies four years
ago in response to student anxiety. Previously, according
to English Masters of Arts Coordinator Nigel Gibson, C o
lumbia's English Department annually administered a
competitive review of its graduate students in order to
determine the shapes and sizes of their funding pack
age.
The process is still competitive, but only in the first year

when about 35 graduate students are working towards
their master's degrees. Of these students, approximately
30 are admitted, based on merit, into the doctoral program
and are funded for four to five more years, according to
Gibson.
As a result of Columbia's new initiative to fund all of its
English doctoral candidates at roughly equal levels, the
program has shrunk considerably, said Gibson.
Gibson also said that the previous system of competi
tive funding had more serious problems.
"The system before was unfair, because it created a tier
of funding." she said "On one level, there was five years of
funding for the 'elite' students and little or no funding for
the rest. Then, all of our students were subject to a yearly
review, which often came to resemble a horse-trading ses
sion. From the view of both the faculty and the students, it
was a very tendentious process."
Several departments nationwide, including the Knglish
and History Departments at the University of Chicago,
however, continue to admit two or three times the stu
dents that they can fund
But according to Hick Hefley, assistant dean of stu
dents in the School of Social Sciences, even the Universi
ty of Chicago is moving towards a more non-competitive
funding system Hefley said that other equally presti

gious departments, like political science, have responded
to student pressure to adopt more non-competitive
schemes.
Hefley admits that the policies at Chicago create more
anxiety, but denies that admitting non-funded students
along with heavily subsidized students creates a hostile in
tellectual environment.
According to Julius Kirshner, Professor of Medieval
History at Chicago, whose department accepts twice as
many students as it can fund, humanities departments
have an obligation to reduce the enrollment in their grad
uate programs because of the increasingly sluggish acade
mic job market.
"Some people in the department, including myself,"
said Kirshner, "would prefer admitting only students with
funding. Given the soft market at this time, it doesn't
seem justifiable for us to continue to award so many
Ph.D.s to students who very well may not be able to find
jobs."
Naturaler selection
Though perhaps not at the University of Chicago,
universities like Columbia seem to be moving in the
direction of downsizing their departments and im
plementing more non-competitive funding policies. In
fact, as Nigel Gibson said, Columbia's admissions process
became much more rigorous when they decided to accept
fewer students, but to fund them all.
Stanford's graduate students, like English Ph.D. candi
date Gene Suarez, who served on the department's gradu
ate admissions committee last year, say that they would
trade a more competitive admissions process for a less
competitive environment in graduate school.
"I don't believe in 'trial by fire' theories," said seventh
year English Ph.D. candidate G.E. Light. "It is very com
petitive to get in, and if the admissions people do their jobs,
they should admit people who are already very dedicated
and intelligent, so there's no real need to have that kind of
competition once we are all here."
The non-competitive funding scheme, by most ac
counts, creates an easier working relationship with facul
ty members that students appreciate. They generally
enjoy the type of nurturing environment that Lerer fears
will leave them less competitive in the job market than
gome of their peers at institutions that encourage more
competition.
Said first-year history graduate student Lynne Hirsch:
"I think that what people mean by coddling is that we get
a lot of attention, and we should. We need it. But there is
no one leading you around. So we become less embittered
toward the process because we're not subject to the same
Social Darwinism."
The road ahead
Graduate programs in the humanities around the
country seem to be evolving to fit their students'
preferences. America's most notoriously competi
tive graduate schools, like Columbia and Chicago's Eng
lish and History programs, are becoming more responsive
to student demands for less competitive funding, but for
more selective admissions leading to smaller depart
ments.
University of Chicago's Kirshner described this evo
lution, as well as the need for a more nurturing envi
ronment, in order to educate the scholars of the 21st
Century.
"When I was in graduate school in the 60s, they used a
lot of military language to make us 'hit the ground run
ning.' But intellectual fashions are changing so rapidly
that you have to prepare students to meet the new inter
disciplinary character of scholarship," he said.
"Getting students into shape used to be the prevailing
attitude, but now we try to be much more welcoming and
nurturing to our students. This philosophy of progress
through competition may work very well in the sciences
where you're trying to win a Nobel Prize, but in the hu
manities it is retrograde." ♦

Fourth-year English Ph.D. Candidate Gene Suarez reclines at the English Department's graduate library, studying in preparation for his orals this winter. Suarez, who sits on the department's admissions committee, says he prefers a more se
lective admissions process for graduate students to the "trial by fire" approach of other universities, where students are weeded out as they advance toward a doctorate.
Long before George Bush's first presidential cam
paign, Stanford's humanities departments dedicated
themselves to creating a kinder, gentler graduate
program through a non-competitive and egalitarian ap
proach to funding graduate students.
At Stanford, most humanities departments, including
the Departments of English, History, Comparative Litera
ture, and Modern Thought and Literature, have always
admitted relatively few graduate students because they
have chosen to fund them all on a non-competitive and
egalitarian basis.
Thus, while Stanford may not award as much money as
some others schools award to the students whom they
most esteem, most of Stanford's humanities departments
fund all of the graduate students that they accept.
In the high-stakes world of academia, where politics
and money sometimes seem at odds with scholarly cooper
ation, Stanford's nurturing approach is catching on. But
while the University's graduate students maintain that
the absence of competition creates a constructive environ
ment for learning, others warn against the dangers of ex
cessive coddling.
With more students wary of the job market and less
funds available for professorships, graduate programs in
the humanities are making difficult financial decisions.
And as the premium on careers in the humanities increas
es, the importance of this debate over the optimal method
of challenging Ph.D. candidates has become an essential
issue for the future of American higher education.
Sharing the wealth
Stanford's non-competitive funding policy means that
all of Stanford's graduate students in these depart
ments receive four-year fellowships which cover their
tuition expenses and provide them with stipends of ap
proximately $10,000.
Students who need fifth-year support may compete for
an additional year's funding through the Mellon "Time-to-
Degree" Program initiated to subsidize graduate students
for a fifth year in order to expedite the completion of their
dissertations. Stanford's humanities departments, there
fore, do not admit any graduate students whom they can
not fund, nor do their financial awards differ markedly in
amount.
According to graduate students who chose to attend
Stanford rather than other institutions, this type of
across-the-board non-competitive funding policy is dis
tinctive.
Unlike Stanford's more egalitarian approach, most hu
manities departments in comparable private institutions
offer gradated or competitive funding. Both these methods
base financial support on the scholastic merit of the stu
dent.
Graduate students studying in the Departments of His
tory, English, Comparative Literature and Modern
Thought and Literature at Stanford overwhelmingly pre
fer Stanford's funding policy to the gradated and competi
tive funding policies which predominate at most other
universities.
In fact, these students often cite Stanford's non-com
petitive approach as a chief reason that they decided to
pursue doctoral degrees at Stanford instead of at other in
stitutions.
According to David Schmid, a fifth year graduate stu
dent in the Modern Thought and Literature Ph.D. pro
gram, competitive funding policies impact the social and in
tellectual atmosphere of departments in a deleterious way.
"There is no question that non-competitive funding cre
ates a more convivial atmosphere among the students,"
Schmid said. "I have friends and colleagues at Columbia
and I know that their competitive funding situation total
ly transforms student-student and student-faculty rela
tionships.
"At Stanford, there is a greater willingness to share
work and ideas and it is easier to interrelate with faculty
because you don't have to try so hard to impress them."
Stanford's non-competitive and egalitarian approach
engenders a congenial intellectual atmosphere that has

fringe benefits. Some graduate students, in fact, turn
down larger financial packages from other universities in
order to study at Stanford for these very reasons.
Janet Kobrin, who recently finished her second year of
graduate work in the Department of History, is one such
student who passed up a more lucrative package to pursue
her Ph.D. at Stanford.
"I was offered more money by other places," she said,
"but one of the reasons I decided to come to Stanford was
that the History Department really fostered a sense of
community.
"We do things with each other and know each others
names," she added. "I think that a lot of that is because the
funding here is non-competitive. It makes the whole at
mosphere a lot more relaxed."
Kobrin also said that the History Department's reason
able teaching assistant load, as compared to the heavier
load at public institutions like the UC-Berkeley was an
other factor in her decision to attend Stanford.
Problem of preparation?
But is this more relaxed and congenial intellectual at
mosphere, created by Stanford's non-competitive
funding, beneficial to academic achievement and

production on the part of graduate students? Moreover,
does Stanford's emphasis on non-competition among its
students adequately prepare them for the bitterly compet
itive job market?
Prof. Seth Lerer, director of graduate studies in the
English Department, is not convinced of the superiority of
Stanford's approach.
"At Stanford, everyone is admitted with the same fund
ing package to avoid the competitive jockeying that you
have at other institutions," he said. "My guess is that the
different approaches (competitive versus non-competi
tive 1 are largely ideological."
Lerer illustrated the philosophical gulf between Stan
ford and other schools. "I was a graduate student at Chica
go and I taught at Princeton before coming here," he said.
"At those institutions, competition was seen to be a good
thing, because at the end, you got individuals who had
been honed on the whetstone of economic competition."
He added that there are "virtues and vices," to both ap
proaches. "Here, first-year graduate students are not wor
ried or anxious about maintaining a level of performance.
By the end of their time here, they become inured in a non
competitive coddling environment that may not prepare
them very well for the aggressive job market, not to men
tion for life as an assistant professor at an institution that

does not guarantee tenure."
Lerer's view, though certainly credible, seems to be in
the minority, both within Stanford and at other institu
tions that have a notoriously cut-throat image.
