## U.S. research cost rules damaging, not 'drastic' 
### 
New federal regulations on government
funding for university research "will not
have a drastic impact" on Stanford, accord
ing to Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten.
However, the University still stands to
lose several million dollars in overhead costs
that under the new rules will be unrecover
able.
"I wouldn't characterize it as a drastic
change," Van Etten said. "But it is evidence
of the federal government's unwillingness to
pay for legitimate costs for research."
Reed Brimhall, Stanford's director of gov
ernment cost and rate studies, said that al
though the specific effect of the changes to
Federal Circular A-21 are uncertain, "we
know that they are not changes that will
work to our benefit."
The revisions to A-21, which were ap
proved by the Clinton administration on
July 15 and published in the July 26 Federal
Register, were originally adopted in the final
days of the Bush administration.
However, Clinton administration Budget
Director Leon Panetta suspended enact
ment of the new measures until last month.
The measure will affect Stanford beginning
in the 1994-95 fiscal year.
Perhaps the most controversial and sub
stantial change to A-21 involves the elimina

tion of tuition remission for graduate stu
dents. Until these changes took place, the
government provided indirect-cost sudsidies
for some of the tuition of graduate students
involved in federally-sponsored research.

University administra
tors originally estimated
that elimination of tuition
remission would mean the
loss of 25 percent of its
graduate students. But
Dean of Research Charles
Kruger said that current
projections indicate that
the chances of such sub
stantial cuts are "highly
unlikely."

"The president and provost are commit
ted to graduate education," he added. "And
they have no intention to let the graduate
student population suffer a 25 percent de
cline."
Although officials could not quantify its
precise impact, the University still stands to
withstand a financial blow when the tuition
remission is terminated in 1997. Caltech,
along with Stanford, is one of the four uni
versities to use tuition remission and will lose
about $1 million in unrecoverable costs, said
Hall Daily, Caltech's director of government
relations and community affairs.

Jim Culliton, vice president for financial
operations at MIT, said the government's de
cision to delay the expiration date for remis
sion gives the four schools a "transition peri
od." Earlier termination, he said, "would
have been catastrophic."
Stanford will also be hit by the addition of
student services to the expenses that fall
under "capped" administrative costs that
can be reimbursed. A-21 continues the 26
percent cap on administrative expenses that
can be reported as indirect costs.
"I have a problem with the concept of a
cap of any kind," Brimhall said, "Other gov
ernment contractors, like Lockheed, don't
have a cap on costs, and they have a built-in
profit (in their contracts). We aren't trying to
make any money." He said that the Univer
sity will lose about $2 million to $2.5 million
in previously recoverable expenses.
Brimhall said that the impact of other
provisions of A-21, including changes in the
reporting of administrative costs and possi
ble requirements to disclose cost-accounting
practices, is still uncertain.
Both Van Etten and Kruger said the revi
sions to A-21, on balance, are not as damag
ing as they could have been. "Compared to
what has been proposed in Washington —
like capping the indirect-cost rate at 40 per
cent — this is good news," Kruger said.

Van Etten said he is hopeful that the
government's actions are more of a "defen
sive nature" in response to the indirect
cost scandal at Stanford than a harbinger
of soured relations between Washington
and higher education.
MlT's Culliton agreed. "(The changes)
are not driven by any insidiousness towards
the University," he said. "There are just a
scarce amount of resources, and everything
that comes up is looked at as a cost-cutting
opportunity."
Van Etten also cited the raising of the
University's indirect-cost rate from 60.3 per
cent in 1992-93 to 61 percent in 1993-94 as
evidence of improving relations with the gov
ernment.
"Sixty-one percent is quite close to about
where we believe our costs will be," he said.
"We are very gratified to reach that agree
ment with the government. We are close to
what you could call a'normal' relationship —
if there is such a thing."
But Brimhall warned that the govern
ment now has its "foot in the door" in regards
to cutting benefits to universities.
"We're still a target," he said. "It's like
being radioactive and having a half-life.
Maybe one half-life goes by, but it's some time
more before you're not radioactive anymore."

ted to graduate education," he added. "And
they have no intention to let the graduate
student population suffer a 25 percent de
cline."
Although officials could not quantify its
precise impact, the University still stands to
withstand a financial blow when the tuition
remission is terminated in 1997. Caltech,
along with Stanford, is one of the four uni
versities to use tuition remission and will lose
about $1 million in unrecoverable costs, said
Hall Daily, Caltech's director of government
relations and community affairs.

Jim Culliton, vice president for financial
operations at MIT, said the government's de
cision to delay the expiration date for remis
sion gives the four schools a "transition peri
od." Earlier termination, he said, "would
have been catastrophic."
Stanford will also be hit by the addition of
student services to the expenses that fall
under "capped" administrative costs that
can be reimbursed. A-21 continues the 26
percent cap on administrative expenses that
can be reported as indirect costs.
"I have a problem with the concept of a
cap of any kind," Brimhall said, "Other gov
ernment contractors, like Lockheed, don't
have a cap on costs, and they have a built-in
profit (in their contracts). We aren't trying to
make any money." He said that the Univer
sity will lose about $2 million to $2.5 million
in previously recoverable expenses.
Brimhall said that the impact of other
provisions of A-21, including changes in the
reporting of administrative costs and possi
ble requirements to disclose cost-accounting
practices, is still uncertain.
Both Van Etten and Kruger said the revi
sions to A-21, on balance, are not as damag
ing as they could have been. "Compared to
what has been proposed in Washington —
like capping the indirect-cost rate at 40 per
cent — this is good news," Kruger said.

Van Etten said he is hopeful that the
government's actions are more of a "defen
sive nature" in response to the indirect
cost scandal at Stanford than a harbinger
of soured relations between Washington
and higher education.
MlT's Culliton agreed. "(The changes)
are not driven by any insidiousness towards
the University," he said. "There are just a
scarce amount of resources, and everything
that comes up is looked at as a cost-cutting
opportunity."
Van Etten also cited the raising of the
University's indirect-cost rate from 60.3 per
cent in 1992-93 to 61 percent in 1993-94 as
evidence of improving relations with the gov
ernment.
"Sixty-one percent is quite close to about
where we believe our costs will be," he said.
"We are very gratified to reach that agree
ment with the government. We are close to
what you could call a'normal' relationship —
if there is such a thing."
But Brimhall warned that the govern
ment now has its "foot in the door" in regards
to cutting benefits to universities.
"We're still a target," he said. "It's like
being radioactive and having a half-life.
Maybe one half-life goes by, but it's some time
more before you're not radioactive anymore."
