# Solar car rolls to sunny finish
## 
### 
The Stanford Solar Car Project rebound
ed from last spring's flaring disaster by tak
ing fifth place at the Department of Energy
Sunrayce in June. The team is now preparing
for November's World Solar Challenge in
Australia.
The solar cars used in the Sunrayce con
vert the heat emitted by the sun into energy.
This energy, absorbed on solar cells, is used to
charge the batteries that power the vehicle.
Michigan University won the Sunrayce,
which took 36 university teams from Dallas
to Minnesota (1,100 miles) in seven days.
Over 70 teams will compete in the 2,000 mile
trek across Australia.
Most of the vehicle, the Sunburner, was
destroyed in a fire ignited during transport to
a test site last April. Thousands of hours and
$8,000 were sacrificed in rebuilding the car
and getting it back to its previous status in
time for the Sunrayce.
Due to the fire, the Stanford team was un
able to attend the qualifier and started the
Sunrayce in 20th place. During the first day
they passed 21, teams which put them near
the lead for the duration of the race.
Team leader Alex Tilson was pleased with
the results and the team's accomplishments;
the Sunburner traveled the 1,100 miles with
no mechanical or electrical breakdowns and
only three flat tires.
Tilson hopes the success will bring more
attention to the Solar Car project.
"Our goal is to raise interest in our pro
gram and to educate people that more can be
done with less. We present an alternative and
offer an unique education to those interest
ed," Tilson said.
In preparation for Australia, four square
inches of solar cells will be added, the car's
aerodynamics will be refined, 240 pounds of
battery weight will be cut and a second pas
senger will be added Tilson said. The new bat
tery is not legal in America
The entire vehicle was custom made by
Stanford students. The construction, which
began in January 1991, has involved over 70
students, although only 16 went to the Sun
rayce.
The six meter long Sunburner is com
posed of several innovations of modern tech
nology. The composite material used for its
body is similar to that used on the Stealth
Bomber. The 12 square meters of solar cells
put out about 1,500 watts of energy, which is
roughly equivalent to that of a hair dryer.
The car can reach speeds of up to 35 to 40
mph on the mere two horse powers of energy,
Tilson said.
Funds to support the car came from the
University, outside corporations and the
team members. After the fire, many funds
were in jeopardy, but the Sunrayce got the
program back on track.

The cost of the fire was covered by insur
ance; however, Tilson estimated the Aus
tralia trip will cost $35,000 to $40,000.
Tilson hinted at competing in the next
Sunrayce if support is strong enough. How
ever, many members of the team core who
have worked on the Sunburner for two to
three years are planning to "retire" after
Australia. The team is seeking new blood,
Tilson explained.
The team will leave in mid-October for the
summer down under.
