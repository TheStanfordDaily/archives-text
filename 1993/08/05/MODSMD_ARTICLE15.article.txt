# Fire at Meyer: power is sour
## 
### 
Knocking out power for over six hours, a
faulty electrical cable in the conduits under
neath Meyer Library blacked out most of the
east side of campus last Saturday night.
Except for the emergency hallway lights,
residents in Toyon Hall, Branner Hall and
Crothers Memorial Hall were without power
from 8 p.m until 2 a.m. Sunday. Other build
ings affected included Meyer Library, Me
chanical Engineering, Press, Publication, 565
Cowell Lane, Old Union, Witman Cluster,
Lomita and Quad 1.
Even though smoke was billowing out of a
manhole near Meyer, and the cables were
rated at 4,000 volts, High Voltage Shop Su
pervisor Tore Haraldsen said there was no
danger.
A relay switch opens the main breaker
"faster than you can blink your eye," he said.
According to Haraldsen, one of the few re

maining Simplex power cables, which Stan
ford installed in the '30s and '40s, was re
sponsible for the power failure. Almost 99 per
cent of the aging cables have been replaced,
said Haraldsen, and the rest will be replaced
with money from the University's General
Plant Improvement Fund.
He estimated that the damage will run
$10,000 to $15,000, with the majority of ex
penses in overtime labor.
"After 34 years in the business," Harald
sen said he has seen "too many" power out
ages.
Facilities has an emergency response
schedule to handle disasters like power out
ages and, Haraldsen emphasized, safety.
"We will take time to be safe," he said. "We
can replace equipment, but we cannot re
place people."
Because power could not be resumed in
Meyer until 4 p.m. Sunday, the library re
mained closed all of Sunday, said Don Inter
simone, facilities manager for University Li
braries.
Although Toyon and Branner residents
did not seem concerned with the length of the
power outage (for many it was "an excuse to
go to the movies," said Ab Winsemius, a
Toyon resident from Amsterdam), students
were surprised when the emergency lights
started going out.
By 10 p.m. Saturday, some wings of Toyon
and Branner were entirely dark.
"People worried that once the emergency
lights went out, there would be complete
darkness, and it would be too dangerous to
walk down the steps to leave," said Jason
Menayan, resident assistant in Toyon.
According to I laraldsen, the batteries pow
ering the emergency lights are only good for
about four hours.
"There is no way of guaranteeing the bat

teries," he said. "These things will happen."
Furthermore, Marvin Moore, patrol cap
tain at Police Services, recommended stu
dents be prepared, since there is always the
possibility that the University could lose
power.
"Keep a good flashlight, a candle, and in
vest in a small light for the backpack," said
Moore. "Anytime there is darkness — for
women and men alike — it will help avoid ac
cidents."
