# Plans for Knoll are at standstill
## 
### 
Plans for construction of a residence on
the Knoll, which were delayed by the pres
ence of an endangered species, will remain
halted until a full environmental report can
be completed.
In light of these complications, any new
housing possibilites may be moved to an al
ternate location, Robin Hensley, the new
residences project coordinator at the Office
of Residential Education said.
Earlier last year, Res Ed's plans for build
ing a new residence on the Knoll were inter
rupted when it was discovered that a family
of salamanders was occupying the area.
This species of salamander is protected
under the Endangered Species Act, so any
construction that would disrupt their habi
tat had to be delayed, according to Hensley.
Hensley added that "|the salamanders)
combined with the fact that the demand
numbers for undergraduate housing were
lower than what was originally expected"
caused the cancellation of construction.
"(Res Ed] is presently looking into the
status of the salamander situation —
whether it is permanent or if it could be mit
igated in the future," Hensley said. An en
vironmental impact report is underway,
but it has not yet been completed, Hensley
said.
A Habitat Conservation Plan was being
conducted by Judy Chan, the associate direc
tor of the Planning Office, but it has been put
on hold while she is on maternity leave, said
Andrew Oman of the University Planning
Office.. He added that the office is "trying to
put something together for the fall."
However, not all new construction plans
have been discontinued. Hensley said that
Res Ed is still looking at the undergraduate
and graduate demand for housing and at
the financial feasibility of building.
"If (building is) feasible, it would be un
likely that the building would be on the
Knoll site," Hensley »aiu. "Most likely it
would be on the Manzanita Trailer Park
site." She added that, depending on de
mand, the possible new building would be
for graduates or undergraduates or "per
haps a flexible place for both."
