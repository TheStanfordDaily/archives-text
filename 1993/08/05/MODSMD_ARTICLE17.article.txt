## Cardinal scores three-of-a-kind at Sr. Nationals Mayfield, Hudepohl lead swimmers 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Last week, Jenny Thompson
and Lea Loveless led the Stanford
charge at the United States Long
Course National Swimming
Championships; this week the
Cardinal men ended their individ
ual title drought with victories by
senior Tyler Mayfield, sophomore
Joe Hudepohl and alum Jeff
Rouse.
Mayfield out-touched three
other swimmers in a blanket fin
ish to the 100-meter breaststroke.
The Cardinal sprinter, who was
fourth at the 50-meter mark, took
first in 1:02.31 seconds, barely
nipping runner-up Seth Van
Neerden by two-hundredths of a
second.
Michigan's Eric Wunderlich
placed third and Texas' JefT Com
mings finished fourth, touching
the wall .15 seconds behind May
field after leading by over half a
second at the turn.
Mayfield's time, although a full
second off of Nelson Diebel's
American record, ranks him as
the 10th fastest American of all
time in the event.
"Getting up there and being
compared to the 10 best swim
mers in American history is flab
bergasting," said the senior from
Las Vegas. "I still look at myself as

a local chump."
Also making the finals of the
100 breast was Stanford junior
Kurt Grote, who placed eighth.
Senior J.J. Freitag finished sixth
in the consolation final.
While Mayfield's victory was a
surprise to some, Hudepohl's win
in the 200 freestyle was expected.
As a 17-year-old, Hudepohl cap
tured the Pan Pacific Champi
onships title in the 200 and swam
a personal best 1:48.30 in the
1992 Olympics.
Hudepohl clocked a 1:49.22 at
the National Championships,
which serves as a qualifying meet
for this year's Pan Pacific Cham
pionships in Kobe, Japan, Aug.
12-15.
"I just wanted to win," Hude
pohl said. "I had other goals com
ing in, but I didn't feel good, so I
forgot about them and focused on
just winning. Maybe with a few
weeks of rest I'll be able to pick it
up a little and swim better in
Japan."
Although Hudepohl and May
field nabbed their crowns without
a little friendly competition from
their Cardinal teammates, 1992
graduate Jeff Rouse led a Stan
ford sweep in the 100 back. Rouse,
the world record holder, easily
took the title in 54.21, over a sec
ond faster than Stanford senior
Brian Retterer. Senior Derek

Weatherford placed third in a time
of 55.32.
"It was a pleasant surprise to
be that fast," said Rouse, who
clocked the eighth fastest time
ever. "You always want to prepare
mentally for a race like it's the
Olympics. This was a mental
drill."
In other events, Hudepohl
placed fourth and Retterer eighth
in the 50 free. Senior Trip Zedlitz
grabbed second in the 200 individ
ual medley, finishing over two sec
onds behind Greg Burgess.
While the Stanford men were
making up for lost ground, the
Cardinal women were falling
back. After taking two races in the
first week, the Stanford contin
gent failed to reach the victory
platform again.
Swimming as members of vari
ous club squads, Cardinal competi
tors managed no better than one
second and one third place finish.
Sprinter Jenny Thompson
clocked the fastest time in the

qualifying heats of the 50 free, but
got out-touched at the wall by vet
eran Angel Martino in the final.
Stanford senior Mary Edwards
placed sixth.
Martino, 26, was Thompson's
teammate in the 1992 Olympics
and helped the United States to
victory in the 400-free relay. In
1988, Martino qualified for sever
al sprint events at the United
States Olympic Trials but was
ousted from the Olympic squad
after she failed a drug test.
In the 200IM, a race typified by
seesaw lead changes, Lea Loveless
surged from next-to-last to first
and finally finished third. The
Cardinal senior and Olympic
medalist got off to a sluggish start
in the butterfly leg, hitting the
turn in sixth place. Loveless then
powered to nearly a full second
lead in the backstroke, her special
ty-
But eventual champion Allison
Wagner made up nearly three sec
onds in the breaststroke to grab

the lead, onto which she hung on
to despite a furious sprint by
Nicole Haislett in the freestyle.
Stanford junior Kendra Thayer
placed sixth.
The top place-getters at Senior
Nationals will get a short break
before representing the United
States at the Pan Pacifics.
In Japan, Thompson is sched
uled for the 100 free, and Loveless
will likely take the blocks in both
the 100 and 200 back. Ex-Cardi
nal star Janet Evans is still going
strong in the 800 free.
Six current members of the
Stanford men's team and Rouse
will compete at the Pan Pacifics,
making the 26-person squad over
a quarter Cardinal.
Hudepohl is set for the two
sprint freestyle events while
Rouse, Weatherford and Retterer
will all compete in the 100 back.
Junior Ray Carey is scheduled for
the 200 fly while Mayfield will hit
the 100 breast and Zedlitz will
start the 200 IM.

field nabbed their crowns without
a little friendly competition from
their Cardinal teammates, 1992
graduate Jeff Rouse led a Stan
ford sweep in the 100 back. Rouse,
the world record holder, easily
took the title in 54.21, over a sec
ond faster than Stanford senior
Brian Retterer. Senior Derek

Weatherford placed third in a time
of 55.32.
"It was a pleasant surprise to
be that fast," said Rouse, who
clocked the eighth fastest time
ever. "You always want to prepare
mentally for a race like it's the
Olympics. This was a mental
drill."
In other events, Hudepohl
placed fourth and Retterer eighth
in the 50 free. Senior Trip Zedlitz
grabbed second in the 200 individ
ual medley, finishing over two sec
onds behind Greg Burgess.
While the Stanford men were
making up for lost ground, the
Cardinal women were falling
back. After taking two races in the
first week, the Stanford contin
gent failed to reach the victory
platform again.
Swimming as members of vari
ous club squads, Cardinal competi
tors managed no better than one
second and one third place finish.
Sprinter Jenny Thompson
clocked the fastest time in the

qualifying heats of the 50 free, but
got out-touched at the wall by vet
eran Angel Martino in the final.
Stanford senior Mary Edwards
placed sixth.
Martino, 26, was Thompson's
teammate in the 1992 Olympics
and helped the United States to
victory in the 400-free relay. In
1988, Martino qualified for sever
al sprint events at the United
States Olympic Trials but was
ousted from the Olympic squad
after she failed a drug test.
In the 200IM, a race typified by
seesaw lead changes, Lea Loveless
surged from next-to-last to first
and finally finished third. The
Cardinal senior and Olympic
medalist got off to a sluggish start
in the butterfly leg, hitting the
turn in sixth place. Loveless then
powered to nearly a full second
lead in the backstroke, her special

But eventual champion Allison
Wagner made up nearly three sec
onds in the breaststroke to grab

the lead, onto which she hung on
to despite a furious sprint by
Nicole Haislett in the freestyle.
Stanford junior Kendra Thayer
placed sixth.
The top place-getters at Senior
Nationals will get a short break
before representing the United
States at the Pan Pacifics.
In Japan, Thompson is sched
uled for the 100 free, and Loveless
will likely take the blocks in both
the 100 and 200 back. Ex-Cardi
nal star Janet Evans is still going
strong in the 800 free.
Six current members of the
Stanford men's team and Rouse
will compete at the Pan Pacifics,
making the 26-person squad over
a quarter Cardinal.
Hudepohl is set for the two
sprint freestyle events while
Rouse, Weatherford and Retterer
will all compete in the 100 back.
Junior Ray Carey is scheduled for
the 200 fly while Mayfield will hit
the 100 breast and Zedlitz will
start the 200 IM.

Tyler Mayfietd shows his form in the breaststroke. The Stanford senior came from behind to win the 100-
meter breaststroke at the U.S. Long Course National Championships.
Last week, Jenny Thompson
and Lea Loveless led the Stanford
charge at the United States Long
Course National Swimming
Championships; this week the
Cardinal men ended their individ
ual title drought with victories by
senior Tyler Mayfield, sophomore
Joe Hudepohl and alum Jeff
Rouse.
Mayfield out-touched three
other swimmers in a blanket fin
ish to the 100-meter breaststroke.
The Cardinal sprinter, who was
fourth at the 50-meter mark, took
first in 1:02.31 seconds, barely
nipping runner-up Seth Van
Neerden by two-hundredths of a
second.
Michigan's Eric Wunderlich
placed third and Texas' JefT Com
mings finished fourth, touching
the wall .15 seconds behind May
field after leading by over half a
second at the turn.
Mayfield's time, although a full
second off of Nelson Diebel's
American record, ranks him as
the 10th fastest American of all
time in the event.
"Getting up there and being
compared to the 10 best swim
mers in American history is flab
bergasting," said the senior from
Las Vegas. "I still look at myself as

a local chump."
Also making the finals of the
100 breast was Stanford junior
Kurt Grote, who placed eighth.
Senior J.J. Freitag finished sixth
in the consolation final.
While Mayfield's victory was a
surprise to some, Hudepohl's win
in the 200 freestyle was expected.
As a 17-year-old, Hudepohl cap
tured the Pan Pacific Champi
onships title in the 200 and swam
a personal best 1:48.30 in the
1992 Olympics.
Hudepohl clocked a 1:49.22 at
the National Championships,
which serves as a qualifying meet
for this year's Pan Pacific Cham
pionships in Kobe, Japan, Aug.
12-15.
"I just wanted to win," Hude
pohl said. "I had other goals com
ing in, but I didn't feel good, so I
forgot about them and focused on
just winning. Maybe with a few
weeks of rest I'll be able to pick it
up a little and swim better in
Japan."
Although Hudepohl and May
field nabbed their crowns without
a little friendly competition from
their Cardinal teammates, 1992

took the title in 54.21, over a sec
