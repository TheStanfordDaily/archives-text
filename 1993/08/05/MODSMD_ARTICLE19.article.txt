## Forward nabs boards, paces squad to split 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
There are very few arenas in interna
tional women's basketball where the Unit
ed States does not excel. One of those fields
is the Junior World Championships, an
event in which the United States women
have never placed better than fiflh.
Stanford junior Rachel Hemmer is
hoping to change that. The 6-foot-3 for
ward and the rest of the American squad
have notched a 1-1 record in early-round
play of the six-team tournament that is
being hosted by Seoul, South Korea.
The United States opened competi
tion on Sunday with an 85-75 victory
over Japan. Hemmer started the game
and scored 12 points on 6-for-9 shooting
while pulling down seven rebounds â€” all
in only 16 minutes of play.
The Americans battled Japan through
the first half, finally taking control of the
contest when they held their opponents
to only three points for nearly nine min
utes at the beginning of the second half.
The University of Connecticut's Rebecca
Lobo led the United States with 19 points
and 19 rebounds.
"Our defense was the key in the sec
ond half as well as our inside game," said
United States coach Jim Foster of Van-

derbilt. On Monday, the
United States was blast
ed by the home team of
Korea, 82-64. Hemmer
started again and nailed
all four of her free
throws while adding one
bucket for a total of six
points. She again hit the
boards and grabbed
eight rebounds.

The Americans fell behind 14-0 at the
outset but managed to climb to within
one point early in the second half. But
then Korea gained momentum from
United States miscues and steamrolled
the Americans.
Lobo scored a team-high 16 points.
"Playing against an experienced Kore
an team in front of their home crowd
made this a very difficult game for us,"
Foster said. "Whenever you play an expe
rienced team like Korea, a younger team
like ours that has not played together as
much will be at a disadvantage."
The United States continues its bru
tal schedule with three more match-ups
with no rest days. Next the Americans
face Bulgaria, then Russia and, finally,
Zaire. The top four teams advance to Sat
urday's semifinal round and the gold
medal game is scheduled for Sunday.
