## 49er-Raiders' preseason clash set for Stanford 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Bill Walsh is no longer with the 49ers â€”
Stanford already has him. Joe Montana
took his beleaguered but magical arm to
Kansas City. And neither Ronnie Lott, Mar
cus Allen nor Bo Jackson wear the Silver
and Black anymore.
There seems to be no reason left to check
out this weekend's preseason match-up be
tween the San Francisco 49ers and the Los
Angeles Raiders at Stanford Stadium.
But Sunday's 1 p.m. showdown does give
the Stanford football fan something he or
she does not already get from college games.
There's the opportunity to perhaps see
James Lofton's last game at Stanford Stadi
um.
The former Cardinal, now a Raider wide
receiver, is nearing the end of a brilliant pro
fessional career and will likely go down in
history as one of the premier deep threats in
the sport.
There's also Steve Young, the chronically
under-appreciated 49er quarterback whose
performances the last few years have been
eclipsed by Montana's legacy.
Oh, and there's a real, live, professional
football game in Stanford's own backyard.
San Francisco is coming off a2l -14 victo
ry over the Pittsburgh Steelers in last week
end's American Bowl in Barcelona, Spain,
site of the 1992 Olympics.
Young drove the 49ers 70 yards in just
over five minutes to notch the first touch
down. Young tossed a 7-yard TD pass to
tight end Brent Jones in the middle of the

first quarter.
The veteran quarterback connected on 8-
for-12 passes for 101 yards and one touch
down in the first half and then gave way to
backups Steve Bono and former Oregon
Duck signal caller, Bill Musgrave.
Bono padded the lead with a 38-yard
touchdown strike to Odessa Turner in the
third quarter. The Steelers came back and
scored two TDs in the fourth quarter, taking
advantage of a sagging 49er defense.
But San Francisco nailed the win with
Adam Walker's one-yard touchdown run
with 59 seconds remaining in the game.
One Bay Area product who was conspicu
ous by his lack of playing time was former
San Jose running back Sheldon Canley. The
ex-Spartan, now a 49er, ran the ball only
twice for a total of nine yards.
Like the 49ers, the Raiders are also com
ing off a preseason win. Los Angeles defeat
ed the Green Bay Packers 19-3 in its presea
son opener. The Packers' head coach, Mike
Holmgren, is a former San Francisco 49er
assistant coach under Bill Walsh and
George Seifert.
