## Protocols of the Elders of NIPPON Japaranoia rears its ugly need in film adaptation of ""Rising Sun" by ed yoon 
### 
tft' we're to believe the mainstream
■media, director Philip Kaufman has
" done us all a favor by making "Rising
Sun," based on the eponymous Michael
Crichton novel, which is supposed to en
lighten us to the mysteries of the Japan
ese mind.
The opening sets the film's tone by
featuring a Japanese man pushing
around his white girlfriend in a Los
geles karaoke bar and singing "Don't
Fence Me In" with his four goons.
After the lady die* at a party hosted by
some Japanese bigwigs, John Connor
(Sean Connery), billed as an expert on
Japanese culture, struggles to deal with
their attempts to obstruct the murder
investigation. So, as a stony-faced repre
sentative speaks broken English and
stonewalls Connor, another Japanese
man takes pictures of the body while
■ other goons prevent the police from
doing their work. j
Kaufman deepens his complex look at
the Japanese by having Connor, whose
omniscience is never, in question, give
lectures on how the Japanese are a se
vere, alien people, who obsessively play
Byzantine games of saving face and say
"no" when they mean "yes." Later, when
the bad guys engage in a high-tech cover
up, Connor chimes in by saying, "We re
not even able to do that." Throughout
the film, Connor gives us an annoying
Japanese play-by-play like a tour guide
on the Jungle Boat Cruise.
Because "Rising Sun" tries to be a
thriller, it's incumbent on Kaufman to
create an aura of omnipotent menace
that threatens to crush our heroes,
which he does by showing the Japanese
buying off the LARD, and L.A. Times,
spying on American businessmen in
high-level trade negotiations, and black
mailing principled U.S. senators. In
essence, Kaufman argues, the Japanese
get what they want, and they get it their
way — which isn't the American way.
Some critics argue that because Wes
ley Snipes stars in the movie (as Lt. Web
Smith), Kaufman can legitimately say to
the audience, "See, I put a black guy in
the movie. I can't be a racist." They em

phasize how Wesley and Sean make such
a likable pair as they kick Jap ass and dig
deeper into eoverups, dirty tricks and
corruption — all of which bear the
dreaded "Made in Japan" label.
There's even a cute scene where Wes
ley breaks a few verbs of his own, as he
jive-talks and mentions his football
playing days in order to sic some home
boys on annoying Japanese gangsters —
as he puts it, "Bad neighborhoods may be
America's last line of defense." Need
some tough help fast? Drive to the ghet
to, says Kaufman, because those willfully
unemployed minorities are just standing
around, waiting to kick somebody's head
in. Kaufman displays his complex racial
sensibilities like a banner with this scene.
Bl ack in the early '80s, "Rising Sun"
I would have packed more punch,
when hysterical media coverage
showed the Japanese rapaciously buying
up American real estate, motion picture
companies and computer firms. People
smashed up Toyotas—even if they were
made by Americans — and columnists
were saddling their horses to proclaim
the Japanese were sacking the country.
Now that the Japanese economy, in
vestments and politicians have hit the
skids, "Rising Sun" often seems so ridicu
bus and cartoonish as to be worth ignor
ing. That was until a woman behind me at
the screening said, "The people who made
the movie really knew their Japanese cul
ture" and another remarked, "Those
Japanese, they can do anything."
But because Kaufman made some cos
metic changes in the original book —< al
legedly toning down the book's racism —
critics have forgotten that the story cen
ters on distorting another people and
their culture, presenting them .is preda
tors, who want to rape our women and
our wealth, with as little regard for our
culture as a pillaging army.
Two "complex" Japanese characters in
"Rising Sun," for instance, supposedly
allow Kaufman to duck' the cnarge of
racism. One is the aforementioned Japan
ese playboy, who beats up his girlfriend
and is constantly surrounded by naked

white women. Cary Tagawa's perfor
mance consists of faking a bad Japanese
accent and pretending to have fun at the
parties he attends. But his character is so
flat, it's pathetic some people call it a leap
for Asian-American actors.
The other cornucopia of complexity?
Tia Carrere, of "Waynes World" fame,
who we're supposed to believe is a physi
cally deformed half-black, half-Japanese
high-tech video expert. She, like Connery,
spends all of her time giving us expository
lectures on how the Japanese — all of
them, mind you — shun people with de
formities and tainted Japanese ancestry.
How much more damning when a
Japanese criticizes her own people. How
cleverly Kaufman dodges another racism
barb. Unfortunately, Carrere's acting is so
atrocious and her hatred so overheated
and pat that she's nothing jiiore than a
Kaufman-Crichton billboard, advertising
how bad those Japanese really are.
Jjk nyone who has even casually
studied Japanese culture or the
Pi history of U.S.-Japan trade rela
tions will realize that the portrayal of the
Japanese in "Rising Sun" is more than
unfair — it's offensive and racist. The
mere fact that the audience is supposed
to rely on a dimensionless white charac
ter to lecture them about Japanese cus
toms is in itself presumptuous and re
flects how shallow Crichton's agenda is.
-The incessant sexual imagery — pri
marily between Japanese men and white
womenbears an ugly racial tinge that
brings to mind turn-of-the-century ,
tears of miscegenation. The beautiful
blond women must be bought, and the
graphic sex must be violently kinky, best
to lan the fear and paranoia in every
white man's heart.
At its core, Rising Sun" is a paranoid
fantasy that dares to make one unchal
lenged and sweeping generalization
after another about the Japanese — all
In the context of portraying them as
hegemonic foreigners trying to make off
with our country. A sense of shared hu
inanity, a sense of what makes the
Japanese unique — th«se are ideas that

don't interest Kaufman, no matter how
much he tries to hide behind the pathet
ic shield of his producer-son, an alleged
Asian studies major.
Connery's didactic sessions never try
to expand our knowledge of the Japan
ese. Instead, as the movie progresses, his
fragmentary lectures on this oddity or
that bizarre custom only convince us that
the Japanese cannot be understood, or if
they can, they're not worth understand
ing anyway, because they're so alien.
In a film that had months to do its re
search and a chance to explore the com
plex and competitive relationship be
tween two different cultures, no one —
certainly not Kaufman nor anyone asso
ciated with him at 20th Century Fox —
thought to portray,,the Japanese as
human beings first, foreigners later. It's a
discouraging., dismaying movie, one
that shows the smugness and self-adula
tion of Hollywood at its worst
The poster for the film sums ujptheir d
deliberate failure. The symbol of imper
ial Japan — a sun with radiating beams
— looms ominously over an American
cityscape. The Japanese people have long
since rejected that symbol, as it reminds
them of an era of pain, political tolly and
suffering. Th.it ''Rising Sun" revives that
symbol shows how deep its disrespect
and dishonesty extends. ■

Editors note: Here's some food for thought.
Kaufman and (Irichton claim to warn us of
the dangers of Japanese business — the
source no\'el ends with a quote from the
chairman of Sony, "If you don't want Japan
to buy it, don't sell it."
But both Kaufmans last film ("Henry
and June") and the adaptation ofCruhton's
last novel ("Jurassic Park") were produced
by Universal Pictures. That studio is owned
by MCA, which is in turn owned by Mat
sushita — a Japanese corporation.
It woidd seem that Kaufman and Crich
ton, far from the wise prophets they purport
to be, are in fact hypocritical whores who
can't wait to be pimped by corporate Japan.
As long as the price is right.
