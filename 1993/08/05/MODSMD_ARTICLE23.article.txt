## Don't consume it Coneheads 
### 
"The Coneheads" was a funny skit on
Saturday Night Live because you couldn't
believe they were actually putting this on
television — Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtain
strapping cones to their heads and pretend
ing they were aliens. It's the same comedy
logic that fuels so many of David Letter
man's gags. But after 10 minutes, the hey
they've-got-cones-on-their-heads joke
wears as thin as the '70s version of
Aykroyd's physique.
Basically, the plot hasn't changed. The
Coneheads come to earth as part of an inva
sion wave, but get stranded. So until their
backup arrives, they're forced to fit in
among gullible earthlings — by pretending
that they've just emigrated from France.
Where the comedy in "Wayne's World"
was fresh, the humor of "Coneheads" is
mired irrevocably in the 19705. There are
Blues Brothersesque car chases, Piscopo
reminiscent Jersey jokes and a "Strange
Brew" oddness that too often fails to trans
late into anything resembling humor.
Aykroyd's portrayal of weirdness and lan
guage creation is a poor attempt at what
Andy Kaufman did so well as Latka on
Urn • T>
Taxi.
When the movie does try to break out of
the '70s, it succeeds. Although somewhat
didactically presented, the vilification of the
Immigration and Naturalization Services is
very clever throughout the film and well
played by David Spade, who riffs on his
sycophantic assistant character from SNL.
Lome Michael — the Canadian mind
behind SNL — evokes cheap thrills from
the audience through an unrelenting series
of cameos from current SNL players and
alumni. Most are fun to see, adding a level
of energy to what would otherwise be a
completely uninspired joke about earthling
habits — a two-hour long episode of "ALF"
with better makeup.
But unlike "ALF," which devoted some of
its 22 minutes to creating and establishing
character, "Coneheads" sacrifices personal
ity for lame visual jokes. Even for a genera
tion raised on MTV and dizzying Nike com
mercials, the movie moves unbearably
quickly. Director Steve Barron — who di
rected such videos as Michael Jackson's
"Billie Jean" and A-ha's "Take on Me" —
loses control of the pacing of the movie, and
ends up with an Eisensteinian montage of
the Coneheads doing silly things, adding up
to no known end.
Admittedly, we get to see Dan Aykroyd
naked. But that would have been a lot better
in the '70s.

Apparently Robin Hood (Cary Elwes) hasn't mastered the subtle nuances of chandelier-swinging in Mel Brooks pseudo-comedy,
"Men In Tights."
