## So, I Married an Axe Murderer 
### 
Despite the unwarranted success of
"Sleepless in Seattle," it's still possible to
make a romantic comedy that is timely with
out soaking it in syrup. Tri-Star's newest re
lease, "So I Married an Axe Murderer,"
proves this and in the process establishes
Mike Myers as more than just a one-hit won
der. Myers brings to this film all the person
ality and enthusiasm he displayed in

"Wayne's World," but tones it down for a
slightly older audience.
"Axe Murderer" stars Myers as Charlie
MacKenzie, a young man who makes his liv
ing reciting quasi-beatnik poetry in a San
Francisco cafe, accompanied by a jazz
combo. Life is great for Charlie except for
one small problem — he has an intense fear
of commitment. Whenever he becomes too
fond of a woman, he finds some far-fetched
excuse to end the relationship and then
writes a poem about it.
So when Charlie falls in love with the local
butcher, Harriet (Nancy Travis), his happi
ness is short-lived — his mother shows him
a story in the Weekly World News about Mrs.
X, a woman who marries and kills her hus
bands on their honeymoon. Though he is
convinced Harriet is Mrs. X, Charlie vows
not to ruin another relationship because of
his paranoia. So he marries her, only to dis
cover that his fears about her may not be un
founded.
A solid cast of comedic actors, paired with
Robbie Fox's well-written script, makes for a
thoroughly enjoyable and light-hearted film.
Some of the funnier scenes center around
Charlie's parents and their household. Myers
doubles as his own father, a crusty and fer
vent Scotsman who sports a Scottish Wall of
Fame in his house. Charlie's mother ("My
Left Foot" 's Brenda Fricker) is a good-na
tured woman who enjoys hitting on his
friends. Anthony LaPaglia does a good job as
Tony, Charlie's police friend who wishes his
job were more like a TV cop show.
Travis' performance as the likable woman
with a shady past keeps us guessing 'til the
end as to her intentions. In addition, Charles
Grodin and Phil Hartman appear in a couple
of small but riotous scenes. Like most films
aimed at the twentysomething crowd, "Axe
Murderer" also features an upbeat sound
track of modern and old classics, which will
no doubt be available at your local CD store.
Under the direction of Thomas

Schlamme, the film avoids many of the cliche
elements of the romantic comedy genre.
Much of the humor derives from the person
alities of the characters rather than the situa
tion. With its cohesive, yet outrageous plot,
it's an exaggerated look at the general desire
for but fear of commitment faced by young
adults. And it's ultimately this theme which
holds our interest in a summer that has failed
to do so.
