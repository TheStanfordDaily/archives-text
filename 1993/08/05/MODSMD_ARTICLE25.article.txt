# Mel's life stinks
## Men in Tights 
### 
Mel Brooks' roving eye, ever in search of
new material to parody, has fastened upon
the legend of Robin Hood. Even if this should
be a great idea for a comedy, it never really de
livers, lacking the entertainment we've come
to expect from a Mel Brooks film.
Plain English: "Men in Tights" is not
funny.
In his most successful films, Brooks sati
rized entire genres or time periods, giving
him ample room to exercise his comedic tal
ent. Here, Brooks chooses instead to attack
"Prince of Thieves," the recent Kevin Costner
version of the Robin Hood story and a Holly
wood hack-job that doesn't give him enough
material to work with. "Men in Tights" hews
so closely to "Prince of Thieves" that we find
ourselves predicting each scene, waiting for
jokes that never materialize.
With his near-terminal inability to bring
the requisite blend of humor and heroism to
his role as Robin Hood, Cary Elwes proves
once again that an inept dramatic actor does
not a comedic actor make. Apparently no one
bothered to give Elwes a remedial course in
timing, irony or understatement. His over
emphasized English accent notwithstanding,
he is woefully out of place in the film.
Amy Yasbeck plays Maid Marian with the

giddy charm of Mary Hart on nitric oxide.
Peeking out from under a red wig, she hears a
vague resemblance to a young Madeleine
Kahn, but lacks the presence and talent that
allowed Kahn to shine in early Brooks clas
sics. Yasbeck reduces her character to a walk
ing, giggling chastity belt. In fact, most of the
characters contribute nothing more than a
single over-used gag. Watching blind servant
Blinkin (Mark Blankfield) bumping into wall
after wall quickly becomes annoying. And is
it really necessary to cast Megan Cavanagh as
Broomhilde, Marians fat attendant, just so
that we can watch her strike the pavement as
she misses her horse — from atop a balcony?
Mel, babe, you're breaking our hearts.
Instead of showing the humor inherent in
a situation, Brooks milks each contrived
scene for what it's worth. And in case we don't
get it the first time, he repeats each joke sev
eral times in the movie, without the punch
and wit of his earlier works. Such compar
isons may seem unfair, but Brooks invites
them when he cribs from his old films, such
as the hunchback hangman from "Blazing
Saddles." Ironically, "Prince of Thieves" ends
up doing a better job with the comic element
of Robin Hood — Alan Rickman's Sheriff of
Nottingham comes off far more humorously
than Roger Rees' Sheriff.
Still, Dom DeLuise delivers an uncanny
impersonation of Brando in his role as Don
Giovanni, the renaissance Mafiosi hired to
knock off Robin Hood. David Chappelle,
who plays Robin's Arab side-kick Achoo,
shows promise as a comedic actor, but his tal
ents arc barely used in this film, except for the
painfully obvious "bless you" jokes. But the
few humorous moments hardly outweigh the
general insipidity of the rest of the film.
Sadly, "Men in Tights" is another film in
the recent string of duds from the once leg
endary Mel Brooks. If you've seen the trailers,
you've probably already seen the best parts of
this movie — for a whole lot less.
