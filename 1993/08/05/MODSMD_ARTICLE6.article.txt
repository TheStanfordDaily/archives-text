## Editorial Reveal roommates It's time Stanford stopped keeping frosh in the dark 
### 
Leaving for college
is the second most
nerve-racking experi
ence in any young person's
life. And Stanford, for the
most part, realizes this —
sending home an overly
comprehensive "Approach
ing Stanford" catalogue
with quotes from real-life
Stanford students and a
cover picture that most cer
tainly depicts someone of
your very own personal race
or ethnicity
But Stanford falls short in
one area, and, in many ways,
the most important one.
Most other schools send
their nervous little fresh
men-to-be a letter that tells
them their new roommate's
name and phone number.
The freshman-to-be then
calls his or her new room
mate and they both pretend
not to be nervous and con
each other into bringing a
hair dryer. Everyone is
happy.
But Stanford maintains
that this information will
cause pre-conceptions.
Thoughts will race through
the freshman-to-bes' head,
ruining their future rela
tionship:
"Can I really live with an
Aleutian roommate?"
"Will I ever learn to com
prehend that Alabama ac
cent?"
"What kind of a dork is so
concerned about a hair
idryer?"
Stanford seems to feel
that only under the guise of
Residential Education can
students meet without prej

udice and discrimination.
Although the Stanford
environment does have an
equalizing effect on stu
dents and does force stu
dents to interact directly, a
phone conversation or two
before the future roomies
meet face-to-face would not
endanger that environment.
For the most part, students
are just as meek, malleable
and nervous the month be
fore they get here as they are
their first day in Branner.
The phone conversation
is unlikely to be the kind of
deep interaction that will
leave formulative impres
sions. The most it is likely to
do is calm the students so
they can be more relaxed at
their first meeting.
"Gee, hair dryers can play
an important role in my life
as well."
Giving students the
names of their roommates
several weeks before school
starts is simply practical.
With students coming from
all over the country, as well
as from all over the world,
being able to talk to a future
roommate may mean impor
tant savings in shipping
costs, at the very least.
More often, it will allay
unnecessary fears that
cause the kind of pre-college
anxiety that leads kids to
hang out with their high
school teachers over the
summer.
If Stanford students are
to be treated like adults,
that policy should be insti
tuted right away — from the
moment they apply. And un
less Stanford truly believes
that only within its adobe
walls can people interact
without the prejudices and
preconceptions it fears, then
maybe it should comb
through its application pool
more carefully.
