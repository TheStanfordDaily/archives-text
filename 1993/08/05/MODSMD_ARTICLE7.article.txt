## Seize the summer 
### 
DON'T PANIC. Summer is
only half over. As your col
leagues on the East Coast
don their galoshes and head back
to school, you're free to enjoy
what could very well be the best 55
days of your life, and quite possi
bly the hottest.
Stop waiting for summer to
happen. It's happening without
you.
This may be your last chance to
sit up and take notice before the
grim monotony of the school year
or (worse) the real world sets in.
Seize upon it, if only so you'll have
an answer for your classmates
when they ask you what you did
over vacation.
Now's the time to write that
screenplay, take that road trip or
initiate that summer romance.
Don't fret, you've got plenty of
time. Remember, you only have to
do one thing. But it had better be
one good thing, and it had better
be soon.
'Fess up. You've spent your en
tire summer vacation making
summer vacation plans you no
longer have any intention of car
rying out. It all started innocently
enough, like some sort of late
breaking New Year's resolution.
You were going to get in shape, get
a tan, learn to cook and start tak
ing advantage of the Bay Area's

clean and efficient public trans
portation system.
Chances are, you haven't even
unpacked.
There's a distinctly short-term
mentality that goes along with
summer vacation, the net result of
too much sun, sleep anu mottled
water. Even the term "vacation"
implies something unspeakably
fleeting and finite.
All too often, "summer" con
notes demeaning jobs, half-fin
ished letters, half-cooked spaghet
ti and way too much "Barney."
Less frequently, it involves air
conditioned double features at the
Stanford Theatre and fountain
hopping with a vengeance. Only
rarely does anyone take the time
to admire the evening skyline as
the campus assumes the blue and
orange hues of a Magritte paint
ing.
These are the simple pleasures
of summer. No one will care.
This is Stanford. Your fellow
students will come back to school
in the fall with newly-packed re
sumes, having spent their idle
months leisurely obliterating ob
scure viral diseases, directing
flood relief efforts in the Midwest
and revitalizing the Eastern Eu
ropean economy.
You, on the other hand, have
been to the city a few times.

It's not your fault that your
parents made you stay on campus
to study/work/punish you. But it's
your duty as a future pillar of soci
ety to do something meaningful in
your oppressed state â€” if not
meaningful to humanity, then
meaningful to yourself.
Propping for the GRE doesn't
count. Seeing "Jurassic Park"
doesn't count. Going to a lot of
weddings doesn't count. Unless,
of course, one of them happens to
be your wedding. But that's an
other column.
Act now, or prepare to lie. Plant
a garden. Boycott the offending
product of your choice. Rent every
single James Bond movie ever
made, including "Casino Royale."
Shave your head. Dye your hair.
Go vegan.
Forget that pipe dream of mov
ing to France and losing 30
pounds and fixate on something
you can actually accomplish, if
only temporarily.
It's time to drop your books
and get the hell outta Dodge while
you still can.
After all, you're already
packed.

Kimberly Chrisman is goin' to
Graceland.
