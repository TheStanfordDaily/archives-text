## Africans not unprepared, they've got bad schools 
### 
Thank you for including com
ments about international stu
dents in last week's preview of
Stanford in the year 2000. Howev
er, did I really say that there will
be fewer Sub-Saharan African
students at Stanford because they
are not as well prepared?
Let me clarify. What I meant
was that the economic conditions
in many African countries com
bined with disruptions in many
systems of secondary and higher
education in Africa make it in
creasingly difficult for African
students to study in the U.S.
Add to this a limited approach
to development aid for students
from Africa by the U.S. and the
long-term situation does not look
promising. Out of approximately
2,500 non-immigrant interna-

tional students at Stanford, less
than 35 are from Sub-Saharan
Africa (including white South
African students).
