An article on the condition
of workers' housing at Webb
Ranch in the July 29 edition
of The Weekly attributed
quotes to a Jack Webb. Those
statements were made by
Gary Webb.
In its July 15 edition, The
Weekly reported that funding
of the University's fiber optic
communications system "will
come from Stanford's general
fund." The system is being
funded by a private donor.
The Weekly regrets the er
rors.
