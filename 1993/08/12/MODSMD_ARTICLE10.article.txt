# 'ENVISION IS GOING TO COVER THE REST OF THE STORY FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES.'
## A 						Conversation With: Tim Marklein 
### 
1r m l>rmer Stanford Daily editor Tim
H Marklein left his job at the public rela-
JL tions firm Jennings and Company
this year to start Envision magazine. Envi
sion, one of the first magazines aimed at the
"twentysomething generation," hit the cam
puses of California this spring. The next
edition is due out in the fall. Marklein dis
cusses the birth of his magazine and his fu
ture plans with Weekly writer Natasha De
ganello.
SW: How will Envision be different from
other magazines for people in the twenties ?
Marklein:There aren't really magazines
created for people in their twenties. There
are magazines that exist right now that tar
get people in their twenties, whether
they're music magazines like Rolling
Stones or Spin, or fashion magazines like
Details or Cosmopolitan. But nothing real
ly covers the rest of the interests of people in
their twenties — the political and social
concerns that people have, the daily inter
ests that people are trying to figure out,
such as careers and money management.
Envision is going to cover the rest of the
story for people in their twenties.
SW: What have been some of the major ob
stacles in creating the magazine?
MarkleinrThe biggest obstacle is getting
people to believe that something like this
can be done by a few people that aren't a big
major publishing company, especially with
advertisers. They want to advertise in
something that they see will be around for a
while, because their ad isn't going to be
worth anything in a magazine that dies
quickly.
The other big thing is the generational
focus and trying to figure out what people
are interested in without pandering or
without making people feel like we're tak
ing advantage of them as a generation
We're looking at Envision as something
that won't really target a particular view
point that people have of this generation —
whether people think we're Slackers or
Grungers or Generation X or the Lost Gen
eration. We're really going to get past the
identity stage that we're in right now.
where we're trying to figure out who we
are, and other people are trying to pin la
bels on us. We're going to get beyond that
and go into the issues that really matter to
us.
It's been difficult, from that standpoint,
to figure out what those issues are and to re
ally have something that reflects as many
people as possible and reflects the different
viewpoints that are out there
HW: I hear you're going to have a corre
spondent in Russia. What's that about ?
MarkleinrThere are several people that I
worked with at The Daily who are involved
in a project called Montage the Soviet-
American student journal, and one of the
people who was working on that project is
currently working in Russia. We're working
with him to write an article on what life is
like for people in their twenties in the for

mer Soviet Union.
We're dealing with what their day-to-day
life is like in terms of economics, jobs and
getting food and some more philosophical
things like what their outlook is like for the
future of their country. One of the most in
teresting things that can come out of it is
what the political viewpoints are and how
they are different from the people in the
United States given the incredible amount
of change that's happening or given the in
credible amount of change that isn't hap
pening I think that could be really interest
ing.
SW: In general, how do you feel the Infor
mation Age is dealing with those in their
twenties?
Marklein:Up until now, it's mostly been a
process of coming up with labels or stereo
types or sound byte descriptions of what we
are, and nobody's really given us a chance to
stake our claim
It's partially been our problem, too, be
cause as a generation we've had people who
have been out there as our spokespeople —
saying this is what we are, and this is what
we believe To a certain extent, they only
represent one piece of the picture. And
there really isn't one single description that

works. The media's problem, in trying to
figure out who we are, is that they want to
find a simple answer that can be boiled
down to a few sentences.
Today, people are working on a bunch of
different fronts: environmentally, race is
sues, gender issues, even just things they do
daily in their jobs where people are working
to promote change or promote progress.
But it's not as vocal a thing or it's not as uni
fied an effort as it was in the '60s, for exam
ple. So people are trying on the outside to
lump everything together, but, because
people are working in different directions,
it's really impossible to lump us together.
SW: What life experiences have prepared
you to be in charge of this project?
Marklein:Primarily, being editor-in-chief
of The Stanford Daily and also being in
volved with other campus publications like
the Stanford Directory
The Daily experience was obviously the
most intense experience that I've had so far
It's an ideal training ground for dealing
with ideas, thinking about issues and figur
ing out what the purpose of journalism is all
about. Although The Daily doesn't always
live up to the standards that we've tried to
achieve, it's a training ground for people.

That's one of the experiences that has
led me to believe that I can do something
like Envision and also led me to see that
there's a purpose for something like Envi
sion.
SW: What are some of the lessons you
learned as the Stanford Daily editor ?
Marklein:l think the primary one was
how easy it is to get caught up in the day-to
day routines of finding news or putting out
a paper, forgetting about the real issues and
the real trends beneath the surface of the
day*B news. And that's one of the things
that a magazine allows you to do, to take a
step back from those issues that are hap
pening and look at them in a different light
and to figure out what's really happening
underneath the surface.
The other thing that I learned is that the
vitality of the publication depends on the
people who are working for it. It can't just
be the editor-in-chief who's making things
happen. There have to be a lot of really solid
contributors to a lot of different aspects,
and the quality of the writing and the qual
ity of the reporting and the quality of the
people doing the work is really the lifeblood
of the publication.
SW: Who's the lifeblood of Envision ?
Marklein:The way we have the magazine
structured is minimal. Essentially we have
four people running the magazine, and
we're relying on contributors from all
across the state and the country to con
tribute articles, photographs, illustrations.
Keeping a small staff really allows us to in
clude a variety of opinions and viewpoints
and to promote a lot of different people. If
we had a big staff of 20 people that would
probably mean that only the staff writers
would be able to contribute, and we really
see a lot of people out there who are the bud
ding journalists of the next 20 to 30 years,
who we really want to give a chance to be
seen on a broader scale.
SW: How would you like people who are in
their twenties today to be remembered?
Marklein:l think the best thing that can
happen for us as a 'generation' is to be given
a chance to make a mark So far everything
that's been written about us has been fo
cused on the forces that are acting upon us
— whether it is the recession or the threat
of AIDS or the legacy of the Reagan years or
the deficit or whatever it is.
What's gotten lost is what we're really
about and what people's reactions are to
that. I think it's going to be impossible, re
ally, for us to be able to make our own mark
without the outside opinions now. So, pri
marily, I hope that we can really be seen as
people who are taking responsibility for our
own actions, for our own place in the world.
Whether that something is as grandiose as
starting a public service organization or
something as routine as being environmen
tally conscious in our jobs and our daily
lives, I think we'd be best remembered as
people who took action and who took re
sponsibility for what's happening.
