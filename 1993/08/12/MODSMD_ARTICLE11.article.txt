# The 						15 most intriguing people at Stanford
## 
### 
Intriguing doesn't mean popular. It doesn't mean
important. And it certainly don't mean ugly.
When we went about selecting the 15 most in-

triguing people at Stanford, we kept several criteria in mind. Have
these people arrested the interest of the Stanford community? Do they
have an air of mystery about them? Are they individuals in the truest
sense, defying expectation and rejecting conformity?
This led us away from some of the more well-known people on cam
pus. Often these people were as interesting, sometimes more so, than
the people we chose. However, the very nature of their exposure has
taken some of the mystique, some of the intrigue, away from them.
Those we did choose — poets and professors, bandleaders and
'bladers — are intriguing precisely because they forced us to press for
explanation, to wonder why they do the things they do.
Finally, we should point out that intrigue abounds at this University.
So if you don't like this list, well, go out and make one of your own.

Philip Zimbardo

I laughed. I cried. He was better
than "Cats." I want to interview
him again and again.
Philip Zimbardo, professor of
psychology, may best be known for
his work with hypnosis. But accord
ing to Zimbardo, he uses hypnosis
only as a tool to study other topics
that he finds interesting — topics
such as arousal, amnesia, motiva
tion and fear.
"I use hypnosis to begin lectures
and talks with dramatic demonstra
tions. The audience is skeptical;
they don't want to believe it," Zim
bardo said.
Before practicing the technique
on others, Zimbardo first mastered
self-hypnosis, gaining the ability to
control pain and to maximize his
concentration skills.
In a lecture to the International
Congress of Psychology on the cog
nitive control of motivation, he
demonstrated his self-hypnotic
prowess.
"I placed a suggestion to myself
in my notes — 'your left hand will
now become numb.' Then a col
league came, pinched the skin on
the back of my hand and put a lady's
hat pin through it; it really created
a tremendous impact."
According to Zimbardo, his
teaching styles are not widely ap
preciated among all members of the
Stanford community. "A lot of the
faculty members think it's too
showy. They confuse style with an
absence of substance."
But hypnosis is not his major
focus. Next week Zimbardo will join
a Brazil-based research team to gain
insight into how one can train ordi
nary people to become torturers.

"People always say, 'I could never
do it,' but anyone could do it. There
is a whole set of social and psycho
logical procedures to allow people to
become torturers," he said.
The notion for this research
comes from his earlier, acclaimed
Stanford Prison Experiment, in
which ordinary Stanford students
were asked to role-play prison
guards and within days they as
sumed sadistic, dominating behav
iors. "Some situations are more
powerful than the people," Zimbar
do commented.
What does Phillip Zimbardo do
when he's not hypnotizing people or
creating sadists?
"I'm a collector," he says."I
enjoy collecting masks, because
they have an interesting connection
with anonymity. What can you do
behind a mask that you can't do
normally as an individual?"
In addition, Zimbardo is in nego
tiations with Tri-Star Pictures
about a possible film deal based on
his prison study. He will do consult
ing on the picture, but "only if it's
not about a mad scientist that be
comes a sadistic beast," he added.
Despite all this activity, Zimbar
do still insists that he leads a pretty
normal existence. In fact, he con
cluded, "Someone looking at this
from Harvard would say, 'These are
your 15 most intriguing people;
God, they're boring as shit.'"

Last year Rosa de la Vega was one
of three "out" resident assistants.
This year there are about 10, said

Rosa de la Vega

the senior feminist studies major,
who is a consultant for RA training.
Last year, along with her RA du
ties at Soto, de la Vega coordinated
Beyond Het — a social and support
network for lesbian, bisexual or
questioning women — while orga
nizing a Stanford contingent for the
March on Washington.
De la Vega, who will be one of
three paid student staffers at the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Community
Center this fall, is now producing a
resource guide for queer or ques
tioningyouth in the mid-Peninsula.
With the help of a $1,500 Donald
Kennedy Public Service Summer
Fellowship, she'll provide informa
tion for youth who are dealing with
issues of sexuality, which are rarely
addressed in schools.
"I know when I was in high
school that it would have been so
cool if somebody just talked about it
openly, and nobody did," she said.
When she got to Stanford, the
structured social atmosphere pro
moted by Res Ed was what she
needed, said de la Vega, who began
coming out freshman year.
"I was living with 100 people, and
there was the unspoken expectation
that you'd be best friends with all
these people by the time you leave,
which is completely unrealistic, but its
not a bad thing to aim for," she said.
When she applied to be an RA, de
la Vega decided to be out from the
beginning. "I can't not be out. It's
too much a part of my life now for
me to spend a whole year running
from my residents because I don't
want to share that part of myself."

Dean Seldomridge

Need a pick-me-up? Something
to get you going? Instead of coffee,
go see Dean Seldomridge.
With an endless reservoir of
smiles and laughter, her demeanor
is sure to turn the blue into the
most bright and sunny.
Dean can be found working as a
sales clerk on the second floor of the
Bookstore, celebrating 21 years
there this past June. However, she
is a fixture on campus not because
of the time she has spent, but be
cause people remember Dean's
warm and friendly service.
"Dealing with the public keeps
me mentally sober and more empa
thetic, and sympathetic," she said.
"I love the kids. They're wonder
ful. The campus is beautiful and the
bookstore is laid back."
Dean, who also enjoys hugs, said
she is "always pleasantly surprised"
by the reciprocation she receives
from the hugs she gives.
Over the years students have in
cluded Dean in a number of Big
Game Gaieties productions which
poke fun at Berkeley and campus
life. Her most memorable skit is
"Nightmare on Palm Drive".
"I always wanted to be an
actor," she said. "My part was to
come in to save the day. I saved stu
dents from being possessed by
binder people, I think, or some
such other demons."
Some of the most influential peo
ple in Dean's life have been people
at the bookstore and around cam
pus, particularly Maria Dallas, who
sells fresh fruit outside the book
store. They have been good friends
for the past four years.
"This may sound corny," said
Dean. "But Maria hands out
warmth and love with each piece of
fruit. She knows the fine art of lov
ing unconditionally."
In addition, Dean hopes people
remember her as a kind person. But
she was quick to add, "I want to be
more giving and generous — I'm
working on that."

John Manley

Political Science Prof. John F.
Manley is not only a thorn in the
Hoover Institution's lion-colored
tower.
Since he arrived in 1972, Manley
has sparked debate on issues rang
ing from the University's relation
ship with Webb Ranch to Stanford's
investments in South Africa.
"I've spoken out to show a
counter position," he said. "To
show not everybody agrees with the
institution."
Manley said he tries to honor the
Stanford motto that University
President Gerhard Casper often
quotes: Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow.
But he said that "money has cor
rupted the institution.
"There is little I find enjoyable
toward Stanford University. But I
do enjoy the students and teaching
and speaking out on issues."
Manley said he involves himself
with campus issues because, "We
are in the education business and
part of this should be to set moral
standards.
"Stanford University students
come here fundamentally knowing
right form wrong, but I think their

elders are quite defi
cient in these areas."
When referring to the
University, Manley said
he also has "a grudging
respect for people on the
right" because they are
often more principled
than liberals.
"Liberals don't have
the courage of convic-

tions." He said, then added,
"They can be had."
Manley appears to prac
tice with courage what he
preaches.
At a rally near Hoover Li
brary in August of 1990, he
was arrested along with four
members of the United
Stanford Workers union.
Their demonstration and

civil disobedience was in re
sponse to the University's budget
cutting measures. According to

Manley, USW mem
bers were being laid
off and replaced
with workers mak
ing poverty-line
wages.
"I kind of grew up
with a set of values —
if one had to put a label

on it — working class values," he said

"With
that
back
ground I
identify
with the
have
nots in
stead of
the
haves."
In

1983, Manley and others urged
public debate over a proposed

Ronald Reagan li
brary complex,
fearing that the
lack of open dis
cussion regard
ing the library
would risk the
long term wel
fare and reputa
tion of Stanford.
A debate ensued,
and eventually
plans for the li-

brary at Stanford were shelved.
Manley said he identifies
with Daniel Berrigan, a Jesui
priest and playwright in the
'60s and '70s who raised
questions regarding Ameri
can society through acts of
civil disobedience.
"(Berrigan is] someone

who was
willing to
put it on
the line in
terms of
what he be
lieved. 1 ad
mire that."

Alexandra d'Arbeloff
Krista Hoeppner

They had a dream, they had an
awesome dream.
And they made it happen.
Krista Hoeppner — a 21-year-

old master thespian and Stanford
Class of '93 graduate — and co-

producer Alexandra
d'Arbeloff formed In
side Out Theater, a new
student theater group

that exploded on the
Stanford scene this
summer.

The two directed
and acted in three out-

door theater productions
this summer: "Equus,"
"Twelfth Night" and "A
Midsummer Night's

Dream." The group has re
ceived wide acclaim and re-

cently appeared on the
front page of the San Jose
Mercury News.
Hoeppner, once a shy 10-

year-old, grew up in a town
near Denver, Colo. Prodded
by her parents to "open up,"

Hoeppner took drama lessons at
the local Jewish

Community Center.
It was all a meteor
shot to stardom from
there.
After being

"quite involved" in
high school drama,
Hoeppner partici
pated in a number of
productions at Stan
ford, including an

impres-

sive
perfor
mance
as the
star
ring
role in
"The
Duch
ess of

Malfi."
Both Hoeppner and

d'Arbeloff
acted in
Chekov's "The
Seagull," "The
Phycisist," the
Women's The
ater's "Beyond
Stereotypes"
and "Serious
Money."

At Stanford, Hoeppner
majored in English with a
concentration in feminist
studies.

Hoeppner — who says,
with some mystery, that she
is "tangentially affiliated"
with a lot of aspects of Stan
ford theater — is returning
to Denver at the end of this

summer to
rob banks.
Otherwise,
her future
plans are
"unclear."
She and
d'Arbeloff
are room
mates in a
house with
the other
members

of the group. Hoeppner said that
"all rumors are true" about what
goes on in the house. Weekly re
porters are currently finding out
what those rumors are.
Hoeppner has what she called a
"slowly accelerating" friendship
with co-producer Alex d'Arbeloff, a
native of Brookline, Mass.
D'Arbeloff, a 1992 Stanford
graduate who typecasts herself as
"the loud mouth, comic-depressed
woman," was an interdisciplinary
English major who studied race and
ethnicity in America. She got in
volved in theater after quitting the
crew team after two quarters.
After Stanford, d'Arbeloff
taught bilingual theater in The Mis
sion in the fall and worked as a
baker at St. Michael's Alley in Palo
Alto.
D'Arbeloff, 23, will work at the
Mountain School of Milton Acade
my near Boston this year, teaching
English to high school juniors.
After this year, she plans to either
apply to Teach for America in Oak
land or make a movie with Hoeppn
er about "complicated women in a
complicated world."

Lisa Koven

The Daily almost had Lisa
Koven. Midway through last fall,
Koven, then a columnist at the
Stanford Review, found herself dis
enchanted with the management
practices of the Review and the
pressure of working there. "I con
sidered working for The Daily," she
says now. "But I didn't want to
throw away everything I had
worked for in the last two-and-a
half years."
So she stayed, and this fall she
will reap the rewards of her persis
tence. Koven will serve as the first
full-time female editor-in-chief of
the Review, the campus' most
prominent source of student con
servatism.
"It is a male-dominated paper,"
Koven says of the Review. "I'd like
to see more women in the conserva
tive movement work for the paper."
But she shrugs off the suggestion
that the publication's old-boy net
work is hostile to women.
"I love working with men — sex
hasn't been an issue," she says."It
would be nice to have more women,
but you have to be a really strong
person to voice your opinions."
Koven, interning this summer at
CBS and CNN in Los Angeles,
maintains that her unpopular views
have not led to estrangment from
other women. "A lot of women say,
'I don't agree with you, but I really
respected you for what you had to
say,'" she says."I received not
alienation, but respect."
She uses the word "cutting
edge" — pun intended — liberally.
The Review, hampered by inconsis
tent production last year, will take a
"cutting-edge stance . . . more con
troversial, not so much outra
geous."
Koven believes her right-of-cen
ter perspective is needs to be heard
as the ongoing debate over femi
nism's future intensifies. "A lot of
women need to hear they have
other options," she says. "There
isn't just radical right-wing femi
nism and radical left-wing femi
nism; there's a position in the mid
dle, and that's where I consider my
self.
"A little more cutting-edge, pos
sibly," she adds.

Barbara Babcock is used to being
first. In 1972, she became the first
female professor at the Law School.
Later, she would be the first woman
honored with an endowed position
there. But when her name surfaced
on President Clinton's short list of
potential nominees for the first fe
male attorney general in January,
Babcock politely removed herself
from consideration.
At the time, Babcock said her
work on a biography of the first fe
male member of the California bar
and what she considered to be views
"America isn't ready for" prompted
her withdrawal. Nearly six months
later, she says she is thoroughly sat
isfied with her decision.
"I'm even happier now that real
ly terrific people are involved," she
says. She points to the overwhelm
ing success of both Janet Reno,
Clinton's eventual choice for attor
ney general, and Supreme Court ap
pointee Ruth Bader Ginsburg as ev
idence that "there are lots and lots
of good women out there."
"Women are coming into their
own," she says."I think this repre
sents a big step towards the day
when people are chosen for their
qualities, not because they are a
man or woman."
Babcock, who served as a deputy
attorney general under President
Carter, ardently backed her long
time-friend Ginsburg's nomination
and calls Reno "the first woman to
appear on the scene that could be a
serious presidential candidate.
She's an absolute star who rises
above gender."
Yet Babcock harbors no linger
ing regret that she could have been
that star. "When I started my ca
reer, the idea that a woman could be
attorney general was a wild idea,"
she says.
Back then, she aspired to be a
Supreme Court justice, a position
considered more accessible to women
and minorities. But "that's like get
ting struck by lightning," she admits.
For all the accolades bestowed
upon her, Babcock remains com
mitted to improving the lives of oth
ers, whether by leading the effort to
increase female representation at
Stanford or by writing on fair trial
procedure.
While she calls the University's
record of female hiring "de
plorable," Babcock says, "we can re
ally point to the Law School with
pride" for its appointment of 10
women to its faculty since 1972.
Asked if she still considers her
self a trailblazer for women in law,
Babcock replies, "I think of myself
as a real lonely scout that went a
long, long way ahead."

For 18 days, Admiral Stockdale
will tour Vietnam with his wife
Sybil and some 90 Stanford alumni,
staging their excursions from a
cruise ship chartered by the Stan
ford Alumni Study/Travel program.
Stockdale will lecture on the origins
of the war, providing personal in
sight into such subjects as the Gulf
of Tonkin incident.
On Aug. 4, 1964, the day of the
supposed North Vietnamese PT
boat attack on a U.S. naval craft,
Stockdale flew exercises over the
area. He claims he saw no North
Vietnamese boats in that part of the
Gulf.
'Though a scholar and a military
hero Stockdale will most likely be
remembered for running as vice
president alongside of his long-time
friend, Ross Perot, in the 1992 elec
tion.
At the vice-presidential debate,
Stockdale intrigued a nation jaded
by slick sound bytes and pup
peteered candidates. He seemed the
antithetical politician: unpolished
yet earnest, bewildered yet intelli
gent.
The debate won him both
ridicule and praise, best illustrated
through the varied responses of the
nation's premier comic institution.
While Saturday Night Live poked
fun at his "Who am I? Why am I
here?" line, ex-cast member Dennis
Miller applauded the performance,
questioning the political-media sys
tem that could make a war hero and
doctor of philosophy seem less im
pressive than Dan Quayle.

Barbara Babcock

John Stockdale

While it might not become a Ken
Follet book, Admiral John Stock
dale's return to Vietnam this winter
will hardly lack significance. Twenty
years have passed since the Admiral
left the country where, as the high
est ranking Navy prisoner of war, he
endured eight years at the infamous
"Hanoi Hilton." His return to the
area will serve as yet another break
from his academic work with stoic
philosophy as a senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution.

Gil Masters

Believe it or not, some Stanford
professors aren't required to do re
search.
While other professors have the
burden of consistently publishing
papers in their respective areas, Gil
Masters enjoys the freedom that ac
companies his rare title — professor
of civil engineering (teaching).
The "parentheses teaching" as
Masters calls it, prioritizes teaching
as his first and only responsibility.
From there, it's a breeze.
"I have a different set of ground
rules ... I'm evaluated on what 1
like to do and what I think I'm good
at... If it's a nice day, I'll go to the
beach. Then, I'll stay up late that
night, but it's my call."
During the summers, most profes
sors write proposals for research pro
jects; Masters favors building on a
second home near the Klamath River,
traveling with his wife or writing a
textbook for an upcoming course.
These activities provide him "en
ergy when September comes; my
batteries are charged."
Masters' analogies indicate the
closeness he has with his academic
subjects. Twice a year, he espouses
the ins-and-outs of energy use in
the popular CEI7O, Autumn quar
ter, and in his Spring courses
CEI76/177.
He doesn't just teach about ener
gy, he also lives in an energy-efficient
house in Menlo I'ark. He remodeled
in 1980, doubling the square
footage, but halving the energy bill.
If you include K4O, he supposes
about half of all Stanford students
at any one time have taken a class
from him.

Masters enjoys a rare occupation
and the happiness he receives is
self-evident. Oh, and if you're inter
ested in marriage, he can do that
too, seeing that he is an official min
ister in the Universal Life Church.
Masters' first postdoctoral job,
(his Ph.D. is in electrical engineer
ing) was at Stanford in 1967, but he
quit after a year as he felt he want
ed to do something else: "Earth Day
1970 had affected me."
From there, he embraced the spir
it of late '60s and traveled around the
country living in the back of a Volk
swagen bus, complete with wooden
stove and smokestack, for two years.
Masters recounts a time in his
life when he lived in his bus in a
parking lot behind Lagunita Court,
now Governor's Corner.
There, he audited Stanford
classes in preparation for teaching
his first environmental engineering
course at Santa Clara University in
the early '70s.

Anna Deavere Smith

Anna Deavere Smith is only one
person — except when she's on
stage.
This award-winning play
wright/actress, also an associate
professor in Stanford's drama de
partment, jumped into the national
limelight after the success of two
one-person plays, "Fires in the Mir
ror" and "Twilight Los Angeles,
1992." Deavere Smith lit up con
temporary theater as she played to
capacity crowds in Los Angeles,
where "Twilight" closed July 13.
Both plays are written on mater
ial from interviews done by Deavere
Smith herself. She created the 26
characters in "Twilight" from 180
interviews of Los Angeles residents.
"Fires in the Mirror" — which
ran last year in New York, Wash
ington D.C. and Connecticut —
drew its material from interviews of
Jews and blacks in the racially torn
Crown Heights neighborhood in
Brooklyn.
"Fires in the Mirror" won an
Obie Award and Drama Desk
Award, and was the runner-up for
the Pulitzer Prize. The book based
on "Fires in the Mirror" is sched
uled to be printed Oct. 1.
Next week, Deavere Smith will
fly to New York City to work with
the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater where she will use her in
terview format to help choreogra
pher Judith Jameson.
"I'm very excited about it," she
said.
And Stanford students will be ex
cited to know that Deavere Smith is
teaching a special workshop on one
person shows in January.
Though Deavere Smith is now a
big commercial success, she retains
a commitment to Stanford and the
academic world in general.
"Academia has been a very im
portant part of my career," Deavere
Smith said. "If it hadn't been for
Stanford, I couldn't have written
'Fires in the Mirror.'"
Stanford supported Deavere
Smith while she was in residency at
the Bunting Institute in New York.
Exploring the American identity











Continued from previous page
is easier to do in an academic set
ting rather than in theater, which
is not always the reflection of real
life that it claims to be, she said.
Deavere Smith, 42, began
teaching in 1975 at Carnegie-
Mellon University. After some
freelance teaching at NYU, Yale
and the National Theater, Dea
vere Smith came to Stanford in
1990.
She is a Baltimore native and
went to Beaver College in Penn
sylvania where she was given an
honorary doctorate this past
May.

Marin Melchior

Marin Melchior has done more
things to her hair than Cher has
go to her body.
Green, black, red, shaved,
spiked, mohawked — Melchior
has done it all. And those exploits,
among several others, have
brought her fame, strange looks
and the most visible post of the Le
land Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Come fall, Melchior will don
silly costumes at football games as
the first female band major since
1981, and the third in Stanford
history.
In a group that is about 75 per
cent male, Melchior thinks a fe
male head-of-state on the field will
be a pleasant change.
"Dealing with the dollies is
going to be easier because, well,
past drum majors have dated
them."
Melchior joined the band in her
sophomore year after arriving on
campus in the fall of 1986. She has
been involved with the Band since
then, even though she has not al
ways been a student.
"I found out two years ago that
I was dyslexic and that was why I
was having a lot of trouble in
school. It's a learning disability in
reading. I read probably about
three times as slowly as the aver
age person — not the average
Stanford person — but the aver
age person."
In her three years out of school,
Melchior cycled through several
jobs including manager of
Hobee's, an au pere and an assis
tant to the police department. On
campus she carved out a niche as
the Niiya-driving rebel amongst
pre-yuppies.

"I was so bad ass. People were
so afraid of me. It was really amus
ing."
Now a visual arts major, Mel
chior has calmed down with her
hair, returning to her natural,
strawberry blonde color, which
hasn't been seen in over three
years.
Melchior's grandmother, who
lives in Menlo Park, is the most re
lieved at the change. When she
first witnessed Melchior's first
hair demolition (bleached top,
green back, black ermine-like tips
and bleached lightning bolts on
the sides), "Oh why did you do
that. You look like something that
hasn't been born yet," she said, al
most crying, when she first saw
her shaven pate.
But she's always going to have
to live with the giant dragon tattoo
on her granddaughter's chest.

JonJones

The Bookstore considers him a
public hazard.
Cops often sit down and watch
him jump over hand rails.
The rapidly growing Stanford
Rollerblading community looks to
him as the University's experi
enced skater.
Whether he happened to leap
from the sky and roll away before
your eyes, whizzed by you as you
were making your way through a
crowd, or jumped over the flight of
stairs you were coming down, it
seems as though Jon Jones, 25,
has crossed everyone's path at
Stanford.
He's been around for a while.
Having grown up in the area, the
University campus has been
Jones's backyard. In the past, he
used to bike here. These days, the
wheels are under his feet, as he
comes up Palm Drive on his
Rollerblades.
A bread baker in the non-blad
ing hours ("The smell is so nice
and killer in there"), Jones can
more often be seen giving advice to
students jumping the stairs in
front of Braun Music Center. "I'm
a learner that will ask and if I can
be a teacher that doesn't mind
someone asking that feels just as
good," he says in his laid back Cal
ifornia drawl.
There's a scar on his shoulder,
another one on his stomach and
another on his arm. All are from
Rollerblading. "There have been
times, like when I avoided a bus,

that I've come pretty close to
dying. Its all hard and scary and it
hurts in way."
On the other hand, he says,
"I'm not even doing it for a race or
a competition or anything. I'm
stuck in just having fun doing this.
It feels so good."
When he skates, Jones concen
trates on his approach, his speed,
the height of his jump, the order it
will all come in, the zone, the way
it will all fit together. . ..
"At that moment, when it all
clicks, its like this big, juicy smile
that I feel coming up through my
back.
"I'm an adrenaline junkie. Its a
way of feeling alive. There's more
to being awake than time sched
ules and reputations and status."
—Natasha Deganello

Eric Alterman

If you were asked to map out
the ideal beginning to a career as a
political pundit, you could do
worse than to use Eric Alterman
as a prototype: degrees from Cor
nell and Yale, senior fellow at a
Washington think tank, colum
nist for Mother Jones magazine,
author of a piquant and acclaimed
book on politics and the media,
hailed by one reviewer as "the
next H.L. Mencken" — and not
yet 35.
But don't count on seeing Al
terman, who's pursuing a Ph.D. in
history at Stanford, seated next to
Elanor Clift on the "McLaughlin
Group" anytime soon. "I hope I
don't end up there," he says.
After all, his 1991 book,
"Sound and Fury," was a scathing
attack on the corruption of Amer
ican politics by the Washington
"punditocracy," a small group of
enormously powerful talking
heads. Alterman was first in
trigued by the subject 11 years
ago "when I first saw the
"McLaughlin Group," and I
thought how incredible stupid it
was, how it wasn't addressing is
sues that I had learned were im
portant."
Based on four years of research
in Washington, Sound and Fury
was released in 1991 to consider
able publicity and favorable re
views, bolstered by a nationwide
promotional tour and Alterman's
appearance on "The Tonight
Show."
Yet by 1990, Alterman had
enrolled as a doctoral candidate
at Stanford. Why? "I'm sort of at
odds with mainstream
thought," he says."I wanted a
security policy — I wanted to be
able to say what I wanted to say
without worrying about
money."
Alterman hopes to lead a life in
the academy while keeping his
foot in the door of political jour
nalism, as he has since receiving a
monthly column in Mother Jones
in January. "I try to combine the
virtues of both, while not being en
tirely comfortable in either set
ting," he says.
Even with two "Crossfire" ap
pearances — which he regrets —
behind him, Alterman is unim
pressed with his precocious suc
cess. "It looks better from a dis
tance," he says.

Nicole Krauss

Nicole Krauss introduced her
self to the Stanford reading public
with a line about seaweed.
But those in-the-know are prob
ably now memorizing the opening
of "Argonata Moon-Rise," the first
work published at Stanford by the
18-year-old Krauss, a freshman last
year, for if acclaim from a Nobel
laureate means anything, Krauss
may soon be a familiar voice to a far
larger literary audience.
Krauss' warm, textured work is
intensely personal, often building
from a passing encounter to a deeper,
universal truth. "My poems are first
and foremeost for me, to help me to
figure something out," shesays. "But
a good poem transcends the artist's
life and extends to the reader."
That style caught the eye last
fall of no less an authority than
Joseph Brodsky, the 1987 Nobel
Prize winner for literature. Dur
ing Brodsky's visit to Stanford in
October, Krauss approached
Brodsky and asked him to look
over some of her poems. His inter
est piqued, Brodsky called Krauss
the next day, and the two spent
five hours discussing her work.
Since then, Brodsky has be
come a virtual mentor for Krauss,
who frequently asks him for criti
cal advice. "He said, 'I know what
you are, and what you are going to
be,'" Krauss says. "Compared to
talking with him, everything
shrinks in importance."
This summer, Krauss is one of
just three college interns at The
New Yorker, the country's most fer
tile breeding ground for young writ
ers. In her first year at Stanford, she
was active in the modest student lit
erary community, contributing five
poems to the nascent journals Con
ceptions and the mind's eye, and
participating in weekly poetry read
ings at the Deke house.
Despite her auspicious start,
Krauss knows the road ahead will
not always be smooth. "Who knows
what will happen?" she says. "But
if I don't give Writing a try, I don't
think I could ever forgive myself."

Babak Ebrahimian

Known to some people as a gift
ed teacher, others as an avant
guard theater director and still
others as an "enfant terrible,"
Babak Ebrahimian is neither an
"enfant" nor "terrible."
Beyond the myths that sur
round him, there's a man with
hope and compassion seeking to
resolve human issues through his
stage, his classes and sometimes
through conflict.
Ebrahimian, a fourth year
graduate student in French and
Italian, walks through campus
with an air of inquisitive sereni
ty. In his Walkman there's a
Mozart cassette. He speaks of his
fascination with filmmaking.
One day he hopes to direct a film
himself. He waves to the bar
beque man at Tressider who
smiles back.
Four years ago, Ebrahimian
"founded the ensemble tradition"
at Stanford when he created his
theater group. He considers his
work experimental rather than
avant-garde; according to
Ebrahimian, his work is some
times misinterpreted, and the use
of nudity in some of his produc
tions has often been sensational
ized. His ensemble emphasizes the
importance of the play as a jour
ney that begins from the first re
hearsal.
"The term avant-garde the
ater really doesn't mean any
thing." Originally he came to
Stanford to study drama and said
he ended up transfering depart
ments to satisfy his intellectual
quest through increased theory
and rigor.
Ebrahimian said he prefers to
be a little man when it comes to
mass media. "The last thing I
thought I would do was let [The
Weekly] write this article," he
said smiling. "If someone wants
to know who I'm about they can
come see my plays or take a class
of mine. I don't like People maga
zine and I don't like the star sys
tem."
