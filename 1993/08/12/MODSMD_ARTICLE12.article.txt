## 'Lots of holes' in ongoing SLAC racial investigation 
### 
A sherifFs investigation of a May 17
racial incident at Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center has turned up a big goose egg —
but some workers are still crying foul
play.
After spending a week and a half on cam
pus and interviewing 15 to 20 people, Detec
tive David W. Hayes of the San Mateo Coun
ty SherifFs Department was not able to de
termine who chalked the message, "Go
Home, Jap" and stuck a knife into the office
door of Chuck Taniguchi, a SLAC store
room manager.
"I felt like I was spinning my wheels,"
Hayes said. "Everybody said they didn't see
anything."
Hayes said most of the workers thought
the idea that the incident was a hate crime
was "bizarre."
"I've pretty much ruled out the hate
crime aspect of the incident," Hayes said.
Hayes attributed the crime — and possi
bly the May 21 burglary of another office at
SLAC — to recent disputes within the
SLAC workers' union and the fact that
many people "just didn't like" Taniguchi.
But many workers at SLAC are less than
happy about the conclusions of the investi
gation.
Lon Warneke, a union shop steward and
executive committee member of the Unified
Stanford Workers, is concerned that the in
vestigation was not thorough.
"I'm not really pleased with what I've
seen so far," Warneke said.
"It's a new type of crime, and I'm not
sure detectives are up on how to investigate
this."
The sheriff s office has refused to release
a copy of the investigation report to Chuck
Taniguchi and his attorney, who are consid
ering obtaining a subpoena for it. The USW
has also been denied access to the report,
Warneke said. SLAC management received
a copy with the sheriff s request not to re
lease it, according to SLAC Personnel Direc
tor Lee Lyon.

On Tuesday, Taniguchi and Warneke at
tained a copy of the investigation report
from an anonymous e-mail message.
"It's a sham," Warneke said. "It's all opin
ion, and no fact... .We believe there's some
kind of cover-up going on here." Taniguchi
could not be reached for his response.

Warneke said that the report did not list
all the people interviewed and did not offer a
balanced account. Warneke accused Hayes
having an anti-union attitude.
"There's lots of holes in it," Warneke
said. "[Hayes) took every union bias and put
it in the report."

Warneke said that the USW is "just fed
up" with what he perceives as consistent ig
noring of union demands to address racism
at SLAC.
"We've tried to use all the due process,
but Stanford just doesn't do anything about
it," Warneke said.
If Stanford does not address the USW's
concerns, Warneke said, he is prepared to
talk to the Office of Fair Housing and Em
ployment, the Department of Energy or
local legislators.
He said that Hayes' assertion that fric
tion within the USW was the motive for the
crime was "the last thing it could be."
Warneke has notified the University
through Keith Smith, manager of employee
relations, that the USW would like to have a
conference about racism in the workplace.
Engineer and long-time union supporter
Jack Truher was one of those interviewed by
Hayes during the investigation. His conver
sation with Hayes showed that Hayes came
into the investigation without understand
ing the subtleties of racism, Truher said.
"I'm troubled by the process," Truher
said. "Thus kind of problem is not well-han
dled by a criminal investigation bureau. I'm
not happy with the detective's conclusion."
Truher organized a rally about a week
after the Taniguchi incident for workers to
voice their concerns about racism.
"SLAC has a record of abusive supervi
sion that's well-documented," Truher said.
"When such abuse is set in place and en
abled, it can easily get out of control."
Hayes has suspended the investigation
for now, but it will remain open for a year in
accordance with the statute of limitations.
He said that Rick Yeager of Laboratory Pro
tection is carrying on an internal investiga
tion for SLAC management.
Yeager would not confirm this informa
tion, and Lyon would not comment on any
findings of the investigation, saying that
"further fact-gathering" was necessary.
