# Stanford West faces problems
## 
### 
Seeking an equilibrium between a high de
mand for affordable housing and a delicate
environment, Stanford is walking a tightrope
over its latest land development project.
The University is building Stanford West,
a 1,120-unit complex on the vacant land be
tween Sand Hill Road and San Francisquito
Creek. The problem — at least in the eyes of
the critics — is that the creek could be envi
ronmentally devastated by the construction.
Stanford's project "will in all probability
place the San Francisquito ('reek ecology and
natural environment in jeopardy, because ex
cessive development and environment of the
creek and area do not go hand in hand," said
Ira E. Bonde, former mayor of Menlo Park.
The concerns range from protection for
fish spawning areas to toxic discharge into
the creek.
Market studies and surveys show that fac
ulty, staff and other workers in the area de
sire affordable housing near their jobs. For
years now, the city of Palo Alto has been pres
suring for construction.
At first glance, the proposed land seems to
be the ideal place because of its convenient lo
cation and infrastructure.
However, the same community that needs
the housing is concerned about the environ
mental well-being of the bordering San Fran
cisquito Creek. They question the Universi
ty's placement choice for the massive com
plex that entails a 16-acre construction pro
ject over a period of seven years, bringing over
2,000 residents in proximity to the creek.
Stanford has been accused of "heartily
promoting a high-density housing project,
bordering on the creek, with little realistic
concern for the effects on the surrounding
community," said Cynthia A Garland, an en
vironmental activist in nearby Menlo Park.
The University, though, sees the situation
under a different light.
"With the building of Stanford West, we
have an opportunity to do something good
without damaging the small environment of
San Francisquito," said Michael McKnight,
manager of facilities at Stanford. "We take
great pride in working to make the environ

ment of the creek better."
Stanford is convinced that the only accept
able way to address the controversial project
Ls to strike a precise balance between the
pressure to build convenient, affordable
housing and the responsibility to preserve
the environment and minimize the effect of
development on nature.
One by one, the University has tried to
deal with the environmental problems.
For steelhead trout, the San Francisquito
Creek is the last spawning environment left
in the South Hay Area. Since the University
diverted their environment, these fish are not
able to swim upstream to lay their eggs. In an
attempt to preserve this species' environ
ment, Stanford is designing devices called
fish ladders that help the fish reach their
spawning destinations. Approximately
$85,000 — mostly from the state — is being
spent on the project.
The University has also been involved
with an archaeological project on the Stan
ford West site. Construction has been set
back from the water from 50 to 300 feet to
protect coals and artifacts found there, some
dating back thousands of years.
"I don't know of any other land developer
in this state who would put aside that much
valuable land for these purposes," said An
drew Doty, director of community relations
in the Office of Public Affairs at Stanford.
Another environmental concern involves
erosion and toxic discharge into the creek.
Water, from parking lots drained into the
creek could carry toxic wastes threatening
the environmental stability.
To deal with thus, Stanford has installed a
storm drain system that channels some of the
water from the non-permeable surfaces into
the sewer system. The rest is drained into a
single 96-inch pipe that empties into the
creek at a single point where the water can be
tested.
Since the system's installation about a
year ago, no unacceptable water has been
found and the system has worked smoothly,
according to McKnight.
An active Menlo Park group, Friends of
San Francisquito Creek, which stands in de
fense of the creek, hopes to play an active role
in helping Stanford carry out its construction
with the highest level of environmental con
sciousness and responsibility.
The University has been asked to show
sensitivity toward the environmental issues

and concern for the effects this large project
will have on the communities. "We look to
Stanford to show leadership in this matter,"
said Bonde, also a member of the Friends of
San Francisquito Creek.
