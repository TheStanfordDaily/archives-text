# Americans owe huge sleep debt
## 
### 
Millions of Americans operate on dan
gerously inadequate amounts of sleep, cost
ing the nation billions of dollars in lost pro
ductivity and sometimes costing lives, ac
cording to researchers at Stanford's Sleep

Disorders Research Center.
Dr. William Dement
founded the center in 1970
and has studied sleep since
1952, when he discovered
rapid eye movement, or
REM sleep, with col
leagues at the University
of Chicago. These days he
spends much of his time
crusading around the
country, spreading the

word about the costs of sleep deprivation.
"One of our goals is to make napping re
spectable," said his assistant, Michael Gulevich.
As president of the National Commis
sion on Sleep Disorders Research, Dement
pushed for the establishment of a national
sleep research center. His efforts paid off in
June when President Clinton signed legis
lation that made one of the centers a reality,
sort of.
So far, Congress has not agreed to pay for
it. Dement and his commission are request
ing $16.4 million to fund the national cen
ter, which would coordinate research and
educate the public about the values of sleep
— and the costs of failing to get enough.
Last October, Dement submitted a
haunting report to Congress:
"At this moment, sleepy individuals are
operating millions of motor vehicles, in
cluding high-tonnage trucks. . . .[Theyare]
monitoring nuclear power plants and space
missions, controlling air traffic, and
staffing military installations."
Dement maintains that a national center

could play a significant role in deflating
sleep myths. He would start the attack on
misinformation by educating the nation's
doctors.
The National Commission estimated in
its report that 60 to 70 million Americans
suffer from sleep-related problems.
Americans have miles to go before they
can sleep. Before sleep disorders can be di
agnosed, Dement says, the medical profes
sion has to be convinced that a problem ex
ists. Unfortunately, its practitioners are
model sleep debtors.
