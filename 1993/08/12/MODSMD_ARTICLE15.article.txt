# Bomb threat at SLAC blown up
## 
### 
A bomb scare at Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center prompted a partial evacuation at
9:50 a.m. yesterday. Plus, an air conditioner
maintenance man lost a bundle.
Personnel Director Lee Lyon said that a
suspicious-looking cardboard package
wrapped in rubber bands had been left on the
desk of one of his employees. The package had
wires sticking out of it and was deemed a pos
sible bomb, so the sheriff s office was notif ed.
A metal device protruding from the pack
age was identified as a common tool for
checking air conditioners, Lyon said. Police
were puzzled.
Police told Lyon that the bomb-detection
dog had "alerted" three times when it sniffed
the package.
Shortly after an X-ray scan revealed elec
tronic equipment in the package, a black
charge was attached to the bundle. It was
promptly brought outside and blown to bits.
It wasn't until after the incident that an
air conditioner maintenance man came in
looking for his equipment. He had accidental
ly left it on a desk while talking to a secretary
and had forgotten it.
Sgt. Rich DiLorenzo, night shift supervi
sor at the San Mateo County Sheriffs office,
confirmed that officers and the bomb squad
were dispatched to Building 40 at SI AC. No
official report had been filed as of last night.
By 12:30 p.m., the area had been cleared,
DiLorenzo said.
