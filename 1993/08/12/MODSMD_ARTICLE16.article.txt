## Despite Young's injury, 49ers roll overs Raiders 
### Chris Dahl 
Despite losing starting quar
terback Steve Young to injury,
the San Francisco 49ers (2-0
preseason) dominated the Los
Angeles Raiders (1-1) en route to
a 27-0 victory in Sunday's pre
season contest at Stanford Sta
dium.
Four different San Francisco
quarterbacks ran the 49er at
tack, which relied heavily on a
short passing game for much of
its offensive spark.
Most of the passes went to
wide open running backs like
Ricky Watters, who helped
spearhead the 49er attack and
led both teams in rushing and
receiving yardage.
The 49ers' trademark ball
control offense took some of the
pressure off the San Francisco
quarterbacks and gave them an
opportunity to enjoy some quali
ty playing time.
"All the quarterbacks on our
side did a good job," said San
Francisco head coach George
Seifert. "Each man that was in
there handled himself well."
The San Francisco quarter
backs may not have seen so
much action, though, were it not
for Young's injury suffered mid
way through the first quarter.
As the left-handed Young was
completing his throwing motion,
his hand struck the helmet of a
Raider defender, and he sus
tained a hairline fracture to his
left thumb.
Young remained in the game
for several plays, though, before
coming out.
"It was numb, and it didn't
really hurt," Young said. "Right
now the only problem is in grip

ping the ball."
"[The injury) won't be serious
in the long run," said Dr.
Michael Dillingham, the 49ers'
team doctor.
"He will possibly play in the
first regular season game, but
we're not sure." The longest
Young might be out is six weeks,
Dillingham added.
Young had a more optimistic
assessment of his injury. "I ex
pect to be out the shortest
amount of time instead of the
longest," he said. "There's no
way I'll miss any regular season
games."
Seifert said that Young
should start the season opener
against the Pittsburgh Steelers
if he is able to practice the full
week before the game.
However, Seifert also said
that in Young's absence, backup
quarterback Steve Bono may
have an expanded role in the
49er offense.
With regard to Young's in
jury, Bono said, "It's an oppor
tunity for me to get more prac
tice time and playing time. Now
I'll just have to step it up, but I'll
be ready."
Bono, who led the 49ers to a
5-1 record when Young was in
jured during the 1991 season,
said he felt pretty good about his
own performance against the
Raiders.
He completed 8 of 12 passes
for 101 yards and a touchdown
Sunday in only a quarter-and-a
half of action.
The touchdown pass came on a
seven-yard slant to Pro Bowl wide
receiver Jerry Rice, who made a
leaping catch at the back of the
endzone to put San Francisco up
17-0 early in the second quarter.

While San Francisco quarter
backs combined to throw for 252
yards, they were hampered by
numerous breakdowns in the of
fensive line's pass protection.
The line's performance
should improve, though, when
49er tackle Steve Wallace and
guard Guy Mclntyre return to
the starting lineup. They missed
the game because of injuries
suffered earlier in the presea
son.
"The offensive line needs to
be more solid," Seifert said.
If the 49er offense runs into
some problems, the defense
demonstrated on Sunday that it
should be able to pick up some of
the slack.
Besides coming up with a
fumble recovery and four inter
ceptions (two by ex-Stanford
cornerback Alan Grant in the
fourth quarter), the San Fran
cisco defense only let the Raider
offense into 49er territory for a
total of 10 plays, with the
Raiders' deepest penetration
being to the San Francisco 31-
yard line.
Seifert said he saw improve
ments in the play of the defense,
and he was especially pleased
with Alan Grant.
"If we were to start the season
now, Alan Grant would start,"
Seifert said. "He did an excellent
job today, but there's still some
preseason left to go, so we'll
see."
Overall, the 49ers perfor
mance gave San Francisco fans
something to look forward to,
and left the Raiders shaking
their heads.
As Rice said, "We came out
today and did exactly what we
wanted to do."

longest," he said. "There's no
way I'll miss any regular season
games."
Seifert said that Young
should start the season opener
against the Pittsburgh Steelers
if he is able to practice the full
week before the game.
However, Seifert also said
that in Young's absence, backup
quarterback Steve Bono may
have an expanded role in the
49er offense.
With regard to Young's in
jury, Bono said, "It's an oppor
tunity for me to get more prac
tice time and playing time. Now
I'll just have to step it up, but I'll
be ready."
Bono, who led the 49ers to a
5-1 record when Young was in
jured during the 1991 season,
said he felt pretty good about his
own performance against the
Raiders.
He completed 8 of 12 passes
for 101 yards and a touchdown
Sunday in only a quarter-and-a
half of action.
The touchdown pass came on a
seven-yard slant to Pro Bowl wide
receiver Jerry Rice, who made a
leaping catch at the back of the
endzone to put San Francisco up
17-0 early in the second quarter.

While San Francisco quarter
backs combined to throw for 252
yards, they were hampered by
numerous breakdowns in the of
fensive line's pass protection.
The line's performance
should improve, though, when
49er tackle Steve Wallace and
guard Guy Mclntyre return to
the starting lineup. They missed
the game because of injuries
suffered earlier in the presea
son.
"The offensive line needs to
be more solid," Seifert said.
If the 49er offense runs into
some problems, the defense
demonstrated on Sunday that it
should be able to pick up some of
the slack.
Besides coming up with a
fumble recovery and four inter
ceptions (two by ex-Stanford
cornerback Alan Grant in the
fourth quarter), the San Fran
cisco defense only let the Raider
offense into 49er territory for a
total of 10 plays, with the
Raiders' deepest penetration
being to the San Francisco 31-
yard line.
Seifert said he saw improve
ments in the play of the defense,
and he was especially pleased
with Alan Grant.
"If we were to start the season
now, Alan Grant would start,"
Seifert said. "He did an excellent
job today, but there's still some
preseason left to go, so we'll
see."
Overall, the 49ers perfor
mance gave San Francisco fans
something to look forward to,
and left the Raiders shaking
their heads.
As Rice said, "We came out
today and did exactly what we
wanted to do."
