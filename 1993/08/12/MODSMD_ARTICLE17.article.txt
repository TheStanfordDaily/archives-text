# Back to the Future — Oden returns
## Former Card volleyball star, Kim Oden, takes asst. coaching job 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Just when Stanford's opponents thought they had
survived to see the post-Oden era in Cardinal women's
volleyball, another one joins the team.
No, it's not a fourth Oden sister following in the foot
steps of 1993 graduate Bev Oden, but the eldest Oden —
Kim — returning to Stanford as an assistant coach to
Don Shaw.
Kim, a 1986 graduate and two-time U.S. Olympic
team captain, will replace Lara Asper, who is taking an
assistant position at Colorado College.
"We're very sad to lose to lose a coach the caliber of
Lara Asper. Lara did a great job and was a key part of the
championship season last year," Shaw said of the 1992
season in which the Cardinal won its first-ever women's
volleyball national championship with a shocking four
game upset over undefeated UCLA.
"But the good news is we're hiring a more than able
replacement," Shaw said. "Kim has the personality and
the experience to be a tremendous asset to the Stanford
program. We're confident her abundant international
experience will rub off on our players."
Kim Oden came to Stanford as the nation's top re
cruit in 1982. She was a four-time All-American and was
twice named Player of the Year while leading the Cardi
nal to four Final Four appearances. She was named the
AVCA Collegiate Player of the Decade and still is Stan
ford's all-time leader in blocks.
After graduation, Kim logged six years with the na
tional team, five-and-a-half as team captain. Regarded
by many as one of the best players in the world, she ex
celled at the international level during the late 1980s.
She recorded the highest hitting percentage of any
player at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and
was named Best Blocker at the 1990 World Champi
onships.
In 1992, Oden teamed up with younger sister Elaina,
a 1989 University of the Pacific graduate, to guide the
U.S. women to a bronze medal in Barcelona.
Following the Olympics, Oden played professionally
in Italy for a season and then competed on the four
woman professional beach volleyball tour, along with
another former Cardinal standout, Kristin Klein.
If Kim Oden does help the Cardinal capture a second
straight national title, all three of the soft-spoken but
hard-hitting Oden sisters will have garnered NCAA ti
tles. Bev won last year and Elaina's UOP Tigers upset
Kim's top-ranked Cardinal in the 1985 championship.
