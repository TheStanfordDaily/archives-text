## Good Fellas, 90210 Amongst Friends 
### 
What do well-heeled, suburban kids do
when having everything means less than
zero? If they're three under-achievers from
Five Towns, Long Island with the names of
Andy, Trevor and Billy, then they exchange
their birthrights for imitation ghetto passes
and the lawless excitement of the street. Not
the typical point of departure for a self-im
portant coming-of-age story that shuffles
towards a dull finish, right?
Wrong. With "Amongst Friends," fresh
man director Rob Weiss takes a pot shot at a
reasonable premise with a rubber bullet,
giving it the flair and light-hearted serious
ness of a John Hughes teen flick from the
Reagan Era — with guns.
Our three underachievers, Andy (Steve
Palavecchio) tells us, are childhood friends,
who hustle their way through junior and se
nior high, all the while maintaining a vicious
contempt for the good life their middle
class parents have handed them. The good
ol' days for these twerps were before they
were born, back when Andy's grandfather
and his pals made their money the old-fash
ioned way — illegally.
Andy, Trevor (Patrick McGraw) and Billy
(Joseph Lindsey) want to be gangsters so bad
they can taste it. So when high school ends,
they give yuppie life the finger and hustle
narcotics. Being rich and white, they never
expect to get caught until Trevor takes the
fall during a deal gone sour.
When he returns as an "easy rider" sever
al years later, a mixture of guilt, indifference
and O.P.P. (Billy's been scheming on
Trevor's girl) insure that the trio's reunion
is stiff and insincere. Billy's in the big time
and is connected, Andy's scuffling for
chump change, waiting for the perfect score
and Trevor's trying to convince his girl
friend Laura (Mira Sorvino) that Cali's
where they belong.
If this storyline strikes you as a bit soap
operatic, you're absolutely right. The prob
lem lies in the execution of the story. Weiss
knows his beginning and ending, but can't
take us from point A to point B in a credible
fashion. He goes for the grungy irony of
Scorsese's "Good Fellas" and comes up with
a high school short story project choked
with "Fuckin'-A" and "Quit dissin' on me."
It's as if he thinks it's easy to create a bunch
of flawed characters that we'll love and miss
once they've passed to the other side.
It doesn't help that the three main actors
share more in common with Jason Priestly
than Ray Liotta. Weiss' dialogue is bad. The
actors make it worse. In most instances, they
deliver their lines with the verve and fluidity
of poor television drama, making us wish for
such actors as Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and
Ice Cube — all of whom have perfected the
art of cursing on camera.
"Amongst Friends" is a film without legs.
It sits on the floor and waits to be pushed
forward by freak coincidence, clever visuals
or Palavecchio's entertaining but incom
plete narration. Still, Weiss' debut shows us
he can direct. Visually, he knows how to
spark interest and fend off boredom. Even
when it's over the top, it remains entertain
ingly forgivable.

Don't let the fearful look or the Made in Mom's Kitchen look fool you — the Meteor Man (Robert Townsend) is kicking serious pos
terior in the film of the same name.
