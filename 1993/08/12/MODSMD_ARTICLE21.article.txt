# Gay 'Green Card'
## The 						Wedding Banquet 
### 
Hollywood has long been too busy
stroking the fragile male ego to take a serious

look at homosexuality. So it isn't surprising
that one of the most honest and sensitive por
trayals of a gay couple to date comes from a
Taiwanese filmmaker.
"The Wedding Banquet" establishes Ang
Lee's formidable directorial skills in an in
dustry whose idea of substantial gay or les
bian roles consist of the ice pick-wielding
psycho-bitch of "Basic Instinct," or the
friendly gay neighbors if other movies. This
comedy, which relates the story of a New
York couple and their artist friend, is at once
entertaining and refreshing.
Wai-Tung (Winston Chao), a successful
Manhattan real-estate broker, lives comfort
ably with his boyfriend Simon until he begins
to receive pressure from his Taiwanese par
ents to marry and produce grandchildren.
Simon encourages him to arrange a bogus
marriage with their mutual friend and ten
ant, Wei-Wei, in order to satisfy his parents
— and help Wei-Wei obtain a green card. But
his parents insist on attending the wedding
and are appalled by the simple city hall cere
mony in which their son is married. To atone
for the shame of such a bare event, a huge
wedding banquet is arranged for the newly
weds.
Winston Chao does an admirable job of
portraying an individual trying to reconcile
his two conflicting cultures. He has the diffi
cult task of trying to keep both his parents
and his lover happy, while dealing with Wei-
Wei, who happens to be attracted to hand
some gay men. The parents manage to avoid
the usual Asian stereotypes while retaining
their comic appeal. Only Simon's role comes
off a bit one-dimensional. His actions and
motives are never really explored and, ironi
cally, he assumes the stereotypical role of
friendly gay neighbor.
Ang Lee's first major motion picture is an
ambitious film which addresses not only gay
themes but also issues of Asian-American
cross-cultural identity and the generation
gap. And it manages to do so surprisingly
well. If this film is any indication of his abili
ty, Ang Lee is a director to watch.
Currently, the only theater showing "The
Wedding Banquet" is the Gateway theater in

San Francisco — understandable if it were a
foreign film with the production values of a
hand-held camcorder. But this is a glossy
production. The only apparent reason for the
limited release of this film is because it's par
tially subtitled. Perhaps the distributors be
lieve the majority of moviegoers to be illiter
ate. Hopefully they will be proven wrong.
So, if you're looking for a movie that actu
ally delves into Asian culture, skip "Rising
Sun." Attend "The Wedding Banquet" in
stead.
