## Meteor Man 
### 
Remember when comic books told simple
stories of single-minded men with high-tech
gadgets and super powers who chased das
tardly criminals around the world in colorful
get-ups? Pure fiction now, baby. Batman's a
sadomasochistic vigilante with a short fuse,
Superman died from a worse beating than
even the L.A.P.D. would dish out, and only
Stan Lee knows what creepy stuff Spider-
Man, Captain America or ex-alcoholic Iron
Man do for kicks.
The days of the straight, WASPish, clean
cut hero are over. Maybe we're ready for a
black version? At least that's what filmmaker
Robert Townsend is betting on for his third
picture, "Meteor Man." The story of Jeffer
son Reed, a mild-mannered substitute
teacher turned altered-human, Townsend's
latest caper offers us everything Tim Burton
hoped we'd disown after "Batman" and
"Batman Returns.''
Reed (Townsend) is a wuss, and everyone
from his D.C. 'hood knows it — he's the kind
of brother that would say "I'm a lover not a
fighter," if he were drop-dead gorgeous. In
stead, he's a struggling jazz bassist when he's
not playing Gandhi at the local grade school
(we learn that Jeffs non-violence musings
are indirectly responsible for the severe beat
ing of a pupil).
One evening on the way to a jazz gig, our

hero has a run-in with the Golden Lords, a
local gang known for drug pushing, highly
aggressive recruiting— the youngest mem
bers are kindergardeners — and golden -tone
'fros. A practitioner of his beliefs, Jeff dodges
the roughnecks by ducking into a garbage
bin. Minutes later, the coast is clear ... or is
it?
The brother forgot a cardinal movie rule:
never stand with your back to the sky, be
cause big green rocks fall without warning.
Suddenly, Jeff is holding the Superhero
sandwich — extra, extra powers, hold the se
cret weakness — that his besieged communi
ty's been craving for. Just the thing to chase
away Golden Lord pains, right? Too bad
moms (Maria Gibbs), pops (Robert Guil
lame) and the neighbors want to heal the
world.

Meteor Man Reed is a
wuss, and everyone from
his D.C. 'hood knows it —
he's the kind of brother
that would say "I'm a lover,
not a fighter," if he were
drop-dead gorgeous.

Townsend is Black Hollywood's greatest
con artist; "Hollywood Shuffle" cleverly
cloaked his candy apple sensibility in searing
satire — the ethnic kind. Riding high on crit
ical praise, his second film, "The Five Hear
beats," flaunted his wholesomeness like the
kid showed off his ice cream in Eddy Mur
phy's "Delirious," minus the humor. Now, it
turns out Townsend really is funny — he's
just most comfortable above the belt.
"The Meteor Man," with its "Super
friends" meets Michael Jackson video plot —
the villains are as intimidating as the arch
dancers in "Bad" and look just as silly — is an
absurdly funny ride ... if you don't mind
tip-toeing around land mines of dullness.
