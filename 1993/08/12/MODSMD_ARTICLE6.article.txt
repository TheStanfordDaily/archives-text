At midnight, the
campus closes its
doors to students

IF STUDENTS ON THIS
campus are never quite
awake, well, then they're
never quite asleep either. The
far-too-crowded dining rooms
of Denny's, Lyons and Taco
Bell — the only all-night
eateries in town — testify to
this.
But the University just
doesn't get it. Whereas most of
our Ivy League counterparts
have 24-hour libraries, cafete
rias and study rooms, Stan
ford shuts down promptly at
midnight — if not earlier.
Keeping the campus open into
the wee hours is expensive,
but if President Casper is seri
ous about making Stanford a
more intellectual environ
ment, then longer study hours
are a worthwhile investment.
Library attendance in the
dead of night — when such
work is somehow more social
ly acceptable — might dispel
those charges of anti-intellec
tualism that seem to plague
Stanford. At a school that
spends $140,000 on a sculp
ture that looks like a hill, hir
ing a couple of extra students
to staff the circulation desk
doesn't seem terribly extrava
gant.
Likewise, the Coffee House
would do well to break into
the a.m. hours. Instead of los
ing, students to places like
Lyons Denny's and Taco Bell,
the CoHo should foster a con
venient cafe atmosphere
where students could study
and socialize late into the
night. As the only hangout on
campus, bleary-eyed students
would certainly congregate
there. Currently, the CoHo —
like the library — literally has
to shove patrons out at mid

night. There's an untapped
gold mine of 2 a.m. frosty
mint drinkers.
Always on the cutting edge,
University Food Service rec
ognized this potential and
achieved unprecedented suc
cess with its Late Night pizza
plan. Even in the bowels of
Stern, the pizza pulled huge
crowds, as did the grill. When
Food Service caters to the
needs of students as campus li
braries and eateries fail them,
something is clearly off-kilter.
Even Palo Alto lags behind
Food Service. Very few local
establishments are open as
late as one would expect in a
college town. Although the
campus is irreparably isolat
ed, the bars, cafes and restau
rants of Palo Alto would do
well to leave their doors open
just a little later.
The all-night study facili
ties in History Corner are a
step in the right direction, but
the atmosphere is more scary
than studious. The always-ac
cessible LaIR computer clus
ter is a much-appreciated ne
cessity and should be matched
by other campus services.
Stanford's libraries are
currently making vast im
provements in their services.
The addition of CD-ROM, the
conversion from cards to bar
codes, and that nifty comput
er at Green Library that maps
each library are wonderful ad
ditions.
But at Stanford, like most
colleges, those resources are
most valuable the night be
fore the paper is due. And 10
p.m. — the time the loan desk
closes — is only the beginning
of panic time.
There may not be a con
stant buzz around Stanford,
but there is a sort of persistent
hum. And to force that hum to
stop at midnight is a danger
ous, dangerous thing.
The Stanford Daily never
closes. Why should anyone
else?
