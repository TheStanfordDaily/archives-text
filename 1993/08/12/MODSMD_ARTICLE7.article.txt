Forget androgyny.
Forget "The Crying
Game." These days, it's
easy to tell the men from the
women. The men are the ones
with their hands in their pants.
Jane Austen was right. One
half of the world cannot under
stand the pleasures of the other.
More often than not, the dividing
line falls between the sexes. For a
woman, there's just no fathom
ing why anyone would nickname
their genitalia "Excalibur," or
anything else, for that matter.
In the battle of the sexes, some
borders will remain forever dis
puted, and we're all probably bet
ter off because of it.
Not that human beings are ul
timately defined by gender. But
it's much easier to give civiliza
tion the benefit of the doubt, to
blame such baffling behavior as
channel surfing on chromosomes
rather than on actual, conscious
choices.
And few will deny that there is
a distinctly male sensibility at
work in our society — one that
goes way beyond sports trivia and
breastjokes.
Any self-respecting woman
would be insulted if you expected
her to know who's trapped in that
coffin on "Days of Our Lives," or
how to achieve that trendy no

eyebrows look.
But ask a group of guys to
name last year's RBI leader, or
what kind of engines Mazdas
have, and they'll be falling all
over each other to shout "Cecil
Fielder" and "rotary."
Men embrace their stereo
types. They revel in them.
They're unabashedly fascinated
by clear products and Slinkys.
They get excited by Tang and
Quik and other things you have
to stir. Men — straight men —
can't comprehend homosexuali
ty, but they have no problem with
wrestling each other at parties.
I once made the mistake of ac
cusing a male friend of wearing
clashing clothes. "I'm a guy," he
said. "I don't have to match."
How could I argue with that
logic?
Another friend spent his sum
mer vacation visiting all the base
ball stadiums in the country. Be
fore he left, he shaved his head so
he wouldn't have to take a comb
on the trip. Why ask why?
The difference between men
and women is not biology. It's
competitive consumption. It's
comparing and congratulating
each other on bodily emissions.
It's quoting lines from bad
movies. Has a woman ever ut
tered the words, "It's all ball

bearings these days?"
1 never play my music at full
volume, except on those rare occa
sions when I crank up the "Les
Miserables" soundtrack to drown
out the Pink Floyd fans down
stairs. I have yet to meet a woman
who sat through "Reservoir
Dogs." When was the last time a
sorority member got busted for
urinating off the roof at a party?
Inexplicable as they may seem,
these and other traits have his
torically united the male sex in a
kind of worldwide fraternity, a
giant tree house bearing the sign,
"No girls allowed." The secret
handshake is a high five and a
slap on the butt. The secret pass
word is "Nice hooters!" The only
thing we fe-males can count on
understanding is that we can't be
a part of it. Whether we want to
be or not.
I, for one, am sick of begging to
be admitted into the inner sanc
tum. If shaving one's legs is a
crime, then let me be guilty.
When you boys get tired of your
stupid old tree, I'll be over here in
the sandbox, building the castles
of tommorrow.

Kimberly Chrisman enjoys being
a girl.
