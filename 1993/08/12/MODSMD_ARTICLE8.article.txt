## Christian Scientist was empowered by convention's success 
### 
As a Stanford alumna, I was
pleased to read of The Weekly's
interest in preserving Stanford's
integrity, as noted in your editori
al of July 22.
And, as a volunteer who
worked on the Christian Science
Young Adult meeting that you re
ferred to in your editorial, I am
puzzled by your objection to its
being held on the Stanford cam
pus.
The meeting was open to any
one wishing to explore individ
ual and global issues in the
framework of spiritual values.
Scholarships were available to
anyone aged 12-30. No questions
about religious affiliation were
asked.
Most participants came from
California, Nevada and Hawaii.

However, other young people
came from many parts of the
United States, Mexico, Canada,
Peru, Germany, Kenya and the
Ukraine.
The program included general
sessions, panels and workshops
on topics including the environ
ment, ethics, homelessness, aca
demics, diversity and prejudice,
careers, world hunger, the media,
crime and violence, relation
ships, politics and the arts, as
well as the Christian Science ap
proach to health care, including
AIDS.
Speakers included university
professors, school teachers, astro
physicists, environmentalists, law
enforcement officers, professional
artists and athletes, lawyers and
journalists, to name a few. More
than a few of these were Stanford
alumni.
There were more than 800 par
ticipants on campus for the week
end-long conference. Stanford
students and alumni were among
the participants.

We received requests from
Stanford students and staff — not
a part of the conference — to keep
the signs bearing the conference
theme, "Empowered by Love."
Those people found the message a
welcome one.
Stanford's housing this confer
ence is a clear indication to me of
the University's strong commit
ment to fostering the thoughtful
consideration of truly significant
issues that can result in progress
for individuals and for our world
community.
I salute Stanford for providing
its campus, which set the tone
for deep thought, respectful
questioning and earnest deliber
ation.
As a Stanford alumna who re
ceives repeated requests for fi
nancial donations, the fact that
Stanford gained some income
from the conference seems fitting
to me.
