Such a visually arresting tapestry testifies
to the unparalleled cross-cultural appeal of
jazz as an art form — an appeal Williams vig
orously confirms. "This is definitely the world
music," he said. "Every culture falls in love
with it, because the elements of jazz are the
same elements of human life."
This summer, the jet-setting Williams and
a bevy of talented instructors and students
from around the world landed at Stanford. At
the renowned Stanford Jazz Workshop — a
perennial affair, which ended last Sunday —
artistic promise is honed, brilliant music is
created and the wisdom of Williams and the
elder jazz masters is passed down to a new
generation of smart swingers. •
One of those disciples is drummer Tony
Montalbano. A 15-year-old high school stu
dent from Fresno, Montalbano was invited
after a "blind" audition to participate in the
workshop's week-long advanced adult ses
sion.
At the workshop, Montalbano had the op
portunity to interact with one of his idols,
drummer Ignacio Berroa, and beamed, "You
see someone like Ignacio all your life, you hear
him on records, and you'd say 'no way am I
ever going to meet him, play like him'.... But
then you eat lunch with him and find out he's
a regular guy. Amazing! And I've learned so
much.''
Lowly beginnings
The workshop was founded in 1963 by cur

rent director Jim Nadel, who, armed with a
brand new Stanford music degree, set up shop
in humble quarters at Tresidder Union. Since
then, the workshop has moved to Braun
Music Center and has grown into what Nadel
calls "one of the most important centers of
jazz education. I don't know of any other pro
gram of this intensity and variety."
Students, ages 12 to 17, attend a week-long
jazz camp during the first week of August.
While living in University housing, they at
tend workshop classes during the day with in
vitations to faculty concerts in the evenings.
A second session is offered to adults during
the second week of August. Tuition charges
for this year's programs ranged from $275 to
$450, with additional charges for accommo
dations. Many participants receive financial
aid, much of which is need-based.
Because the 25-member faculty (guest lec
turers may swell the daily total to 40) changes
from year to year, Nadel says each summer's
workshop brings a new flavor to the musical
cornucopia enjoyed by more than 150 stu
dents, who hail from as far away as Hong
Kong and Germany. This summer the work
shop focused on Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz,
drawing on the wealth of the expertise of such
faculty members as Berroa, fellow percus
sionist John Santos, trombonist Wayne Wal
lace and renowned composer/saxophonist
Benny Golson.
More than the right notes
Yet, despite its annual exploration of varied
jazz idioms, the workshop and its students
maintain constant goals.
Nadel asserts that, instead of seeking vast
strides in technical skill, many students
"come because in one week they get inspira-

Percussionist John Santos conducts a master class on Afro-Latin rhythmic structures. Santos utilizes a set of Yoruba drums in his demonstrations of complex syncopation
tion for a year's worth of practice." The faculty channels the muse of
inspiration that the students court, providing examples of virtuosic
playing and sterling musical judgment through the workshop's con
cert series.
In addition, instructors advise their students directly, instilling in
them the emotive savvy and taste that separate great jazz from good.
As Buster Williams lectured a saxophone student, "Know when not
to play. .. let your solo breathe; if you play fast through the whole
solo, people may say, 'man, he knows his horn | technically ],' but your
solo won't say anything."
Such thinking permeates the workshop's pedagogy; musical wis
dom, more than technical advice, is the prized commodity in trans
actions between workshop instructors and their pupils. And Montal
bano, for one, thinks that the program has succeeded in its purpose:
"[Berroa] has helped me a lot. Not with technical things, so much,
but more with the mental part of drumming. I play more musical
than technical now, and I'm a better listener."
Which is not to say that technical skills go ignored. According to
Nadel, "There's a great span of experience levels; members of each
work group are of like experience, so they can be challenged at ap
propriate levels."
Keeping the beat
Students at all levels stand to inherit a wealth of wisdom from jazz
greats of another generation. Williams sees the passing on of his own
knowledge as essential to the survival of his art form: "The workshop
is purely an artistic endeavor... to create worthy, capable, meaning
ful performers to perpetuate the art and legacy of jazz.. .(which will]
ensure in the future the consistency and purity of the art."
The primary focus of the workshop, in Williams' eyes, is not on
classroom work, but on public performance. Performance, the telos
of the learning process, is not just for the sake of the listener, he says,
but is "for the art itself."
But even as the mantle of this heritage is passed on to a new gen
eration, changes are inevitable. Like many students at the workshop,
Indiana University junior Rachel Caswell was thrilled at the oppor
tunity to learn from top-notch instructors in a variety of settings. But
Caswell's very presence was notable in light of one of jazz's more in
famous traditions.
"There are 90 jazz studies majors at 1.U.," she says, "but only six
or seven non-vocalists who are female. People look at you and say,
'Oh, you're a chick.. .you can't play jazz."'
But Caswell sees jazz as a flexible realm. "Jazz is merging so many
areas and cultures," she says. "That's the thingabout jazz, the whole
concept is progress toward integration, in every way." And general
societal changes are now allowing such progress to take place more
rapidly than was previously possible, so that gender relations within
the jazz community can catch up to its long tradition of racial inte
gration.
"If [a female] grew up in a '50s home, [herl mom isn't going to say,
'Honey, why don't you become a jazz musician?"' Caswell says. But
today's jazz fields are opening up to women, and female jazz musi
cians want to integrate fully with their male band-mates.
"Most of the women don't want to be 'the women of jazz.' I don't
want to have to go to a book called 'Women of Jazz' (to find out about
them)," Caswell says.
A vital gift
The transmission of jazz's rich heritage is revered as a serious and
meaningful event by both generations involved. "If you play a musi
cal instrument, and you burn it up, you know, play great all your life,
but don't teach anyone, you're selfish," Montalbano says. "You're
killing your art. Teaching is a generous thing to do."
Williams, in this spirit, undertakes his teaching with a solemnity
and earnestness befitting the urgent need he sees to preserve his
beloved art form.
Student and teacher, therefore, appreciate one another's atti
tudes toward their mutual endeavor, and the resulting product of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop — the music — is marvelous. The trans
mission is working, for Montalbano, at his tender age, shows a re
markably eloquent understand' "g of his art.
"Jazz .. ..It's a whole different language, just like English. There
are many ways to say things, like 'red' or 'read.' It's a very hard lan
guage to learn, but once you know it, you can express yourself just
righ*, in so many ways!"
Buster Williams likes to say, "Profundity must be sought, and jazz
is profound music." Williams can feel assured that Tony Montalbano
is seeking profundity, giving hope that the art of jazz will live long
after Williams' own illustrious career ends. Says Montalbano defi
antly. "I'm going to carry on the torch."
