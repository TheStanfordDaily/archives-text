■ case of jazz bassist Buster Williams: fes-
JL tival decals from Sardinia and Newport,
customs stamps from India, Japan and
France and a host of colorful airline insignia
labels from around the globe.
Such a visually arresting tapestry testifies
to the unparalleled cross-cultural appeal of
jazz as an art form — an appeal Williams vig
orously confirms. "This is definitely the world
music," he said. "Every culture falls in love
with it, because the elements of jazz are the
same elements of human life."
This summer, the jet-setting Williams and
a bevy of talented instructors and students
from around the world landed at Stanford. At
the renowned Stanford Jazz Workshop — a
perennial affair, which ended last Sunday —
artistic promise is honed, brilliant music is
created and the wisdom of Williams and the
elder jazz masters is passed down to a new
generation of smart swingers. •
One of those disciples is drummer Tony
Montalbano. A 15-year-old high school stu
dent from Fresno, Montalbano was invited
after a "blind" audition to participate in the
workshop's week-long advanced adult ses
sion.
At the workshop, Montalbano had the op
portunity to interact with one of his idols,
drummer Ignacio Berroa, and beamed, "You
see someone like Ignacio all your life, you hear
him on records, and you'd say 'no way am I
ever going to meet him, play like him'.... But
then you eat lunch with him and find out he's
a regular guy. Amazing! And I've learned so
much.''
Lowly beginnings
The workshop was founded in 1963 by cur

rent director Jim Nadel, who, armed with a
brand new Stanford music degree, set up shop
in humble quarters at Tresidder Union. Since
then, the workshop has moved to Braun
Music Center and has grown into what Nadel
calls "one of the most important centers of
jazz education. I don't know of any other pro
gram of this intensity and variety."
Students, ages 12 to 17, attend a week-long
jazz camp during the first week of August.
While living in University housing, they at
tend workshop classes during the day with in
vitations to faculty concerts in the evenings.
A second session is offered to adults during
the second week of August. Tuition charges
for this year's programs ranged from $275 to
$450, with additional charges for accommo
dations. Many participants receive financial
aid, much of which is need-based.
Because the 25-member faculty (guest lec
turers may swell the daily total to 40) changes
from year to year, Nadel says each summer's
workshop brings a new flavor to the musical
cornucopia enjoyed by more than 150 stu
dents, who hail from as far away as Hong
Kong and Germany. This summer the work
shop focused on Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz,
drawing on the wealth of the expertise of such
faculty members as Berroa, fellow percus
sionist John Santos, trombonist Wayne Wal
lace and renowned composer/saxophonist
Benny Golson.
More than the right notes
Yet, despite its annual exploration of varied
jazz idioms, the workshop and its students
maintain constant goals.
Nadel asserts that, instead of seeking vast
strides in technical skill, many students
"come because in one week they get inspira-
