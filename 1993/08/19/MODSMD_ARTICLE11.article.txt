# Renowned Red Rodney rocks workshop's final weekend
## 
### Josh Green 
Listening to the Red Rodney Quintet in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium last Friday night was like
rushing down a dangerous waterslide.
You start out with the cool tones of Rodney's sweet
sounding fluglehorn lapping at your ears. Then the
twisting and turning riffs from Danilo Perez's piano
run you up the side of a wall.
Without warning, Buster Williams breaks out with a
deep, dipping glissando from one end of a bass string to
the other, droppingyou down a steep incline. You might
even bump your head listening to the thumping
rhythms of Ignacio Berroa's incredible drum solos.
All of their sounds weave together to bring you crash -
ing into a frothy finale pool. But little do you know,
there's another ride just around the corner.
Red Rodney capped off the 21st Annual Stanford
Jazz Festival Concert Series with a sparkling perfor
mance that covered the Be-Bop era from beginning to
end. All of the players taught in jazz festival workshops
in the days before the concert.
Filling in the tenor sax part for the quintet was John
McKenna, a faculty member in Stanford's Music De
partment. McKenna held his own and ran off some pret
ty decent solos. But he wore a perpetually bewildered,
awed look on his face that seemed to say, "Am I really
with Red Rodney?"
The group needed the first two tunes to get warmed
up and to adjust the sound equipment to their liking. By
the time they got to the fast-moving "Red Snapper,"
they were ready to shoot down the waterslide. Danilo
Perez rattled off a scorching piano solo, followed by a
stunning drum solo that alternated from thundering,
fast toms to crackling snares.
They followed it with a Cole Porter ballad called
"Every Time We Say Goodbye" featuring Perez. He
hunched over the keyboard, his facial expressions mov
ing and contorting with the music. Somehow, he had
the same intensity playing slow, beautiful melodies that
he had during faster be-bop runs. He was all over the
keyboard, using the higher registers in an unusual but
effective way. His feet stomped in time to the rhythm of
his hands.
Rodney showed an understanding of his players by
recognizing that Williams had something to say after

the last piece.
"After that bass solo, I gotta hear some more," Rod
ney said.
So Williams played some more in the jazz standard,
Miles Davis' "So What." The crowd sat in awe as
Williams ran through a lengthy, emotional rollercoast
er of a solo, exploring the upper and lower reaches of his
instrument, and straining the bounds of sound a bass
can make with lazy glissandos and rhythmic, repetitive
strokes on the higher strings. When he was done, the
audience roared its approval.
Rodney himself contributed to each song with smok
ing solos that reached climaxes on high notes one
wouldn't have thought possible on a fluglehorn. His
horn gave off a reddish tint, appropriate for the aging
redhead who played it. Throughout the concert, Rodney
strolled around the stage, laughing and at ease, reas
suring McKenna and cracking jokes.
The concert was genuine, because it smacked of what
jazz is truly about: spontaneity and improvisation.
At one point, Rodney gave the stage to Perez,
Williams and Berroa, saying, "And now, I give you the
Perez Trio, playing anything they'd like to play."
Rodney waved off the rest of the band in the middle
of one song, because he wanted to play a cadenza. The
band obediently remained silent until they sensed he
was ready to move on and then joined in together, as if
they were all thinking the same thing at the same time.
The quintet added a new twist to the classical piece,
"Greensleeves," playing it with an upbeat jazz rhythm.
Switching into the key of B, they segued nicely into the
widely recognized jazz piece, "Giant Steps."
Berroa did what most drummers can only dream of
doing: he played the drums expressively. Whether it was
simple or inhumanly complicated, Berroa shaped the
volume, tone and rhythm of his set in a way that made
one think of the drums as an instrument, rather than
just a percussion. His back-up rhythms for instrumen
tal solos followed the ideas of his colleagues, as if he
could read their minds.
Rodney explained it by saying that true jazz musi
cians learned to "listen to each other" and can therefore
"relate to each other" no matter where they're playing.
"Even when we messed up, nobody knew about it,"
Rodney said with a smile.
