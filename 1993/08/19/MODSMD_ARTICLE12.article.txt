# BIG TIME
## STANFORD FOOTBALL TAKES AIM AT NATIONAL PROMINENCE STORY BY MIKE LANGFORD PHOTOS BY PATRICK TOWER 
### 
When Hall-of-Famer Bill
Walsh decided to return to
college football, he did more
than just attract the nation's best
coaches and players to Stanford
University. He changed the Uni
versity itself.
It has now become official:
Stanford is a football school. If
there were any doubts during the
Denny Green era, then they have
been squashed by the combined
weight of a Pac-10 co-champi
onship trophy, the 19 Super Bowl
rings owned by the coaching staff
and numerous prep Ail-American
recruits.
And not just a football school,
but a big football school. The
praises sung by everybody — from
the magazine sportswriters hail
ing Stanford's combination of aca
demics and winning athletics to
the less recognizable and probably
more knowledgeable die-hard fans
never failing to line the fences at
practice — attest to the fact that
the Cardinal has hit the big time.
"Stanford is now on the West
Coast instead of an Ivy League
school on the East Coast — some
thing I thought for a long time,"
said senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom.
The media guide is bigger than
the telephone books for most
Northern California towns. The
coaches provide weekly telecon
ferences linking the Farm to the
entire nation. And for the first
time in quite a while, Stanford is
mentioned in the same sentences
with Notre Dame, USC and Penn
State, especially since the Cardi
nal beat all three last season.
However, the performance of
the 1992 edition of the Cardinal
created high expectations for
Walsh, who inherited a tough and

experienced defense and some key
offensive weapons. And it's hard
to improve on a 10-win season
ending in a conference co-champi
onship, a bowl win on New Year's
Day and a No. 9 national ranking.
"Fans have high expectations,"
said Walsh. "They're prepared to
have winning Saturdays. With our

schedule, I think we'll win a few
and lose a few."
But if preliminary indications
of the Cardinal's promise in the
preseason mean anything, per
haps the expectations aren't all
that unreasonable. And while it
will take an impressive effort to
match the successes of last season,
Walsh and the rest of the coaching
staff are poised to show that big
time football on the Farm may be
here to stay.
The Blockbuster season
When Walsh and his staff arrived
at Stanford, the Cardinal was al
ready in position to burst on the
national scene
But mistakes in a Stanford loss
to Texas A&M in the Pigskin Clas
sic caused many to question if
Walsh could make the transition
back to college football.
Walsh began to quiet the critics
in the following weeks, finally si
lencing them on Oct. 3 when Stan
ford came back from a 16-point
deficit to soundly beat then-6th
ranked Notre Dame 33-16 in
South Bend.
The season rolled along, Stan
ford finished the year looking like
it couldn't lose. And it didn't, win
ning its final four games, the last
of which was a 24-3 win over Penn
St. in the Blockbuster Bowl on
Jan. 1.
To top it off, the year ended
with Stanford's best recruiting
class of all time. Walsh and his as
sistant coaches lured 22 players to
the Farm, 19 of them All-Ameri
cans. Most publications rated the
crop among the top five in the na
tion.
But at the same time, the Car
dinal suffered severely from grad
uation, losing seven members of
the defense, five members of the
offense and other key players.
Sudden impact
Holes left by departing seniors be
came question marks staring
Stanford's coaches in the face.
How to replace the outside line
backers, which helped the sec
ondary finish the year with the
4th-best passing efficiency de
fense in the nation? How to fill a
completely vacant offensive and
defensive backfield? How to solid
ify a crucially important offensive
line and a still-inexperienced wide
receiver corps?
The answers to those questions
are still being found and will likely
be continuously discovered
throughout the 1993 season as the
team improves.
"We may not be the same team
a month from now that we are

today," said Walsh, who added
that Stanford fans will need to
have patience as the new starters
learn.
The rate at which new players
develop will most likely determine
the level of Stanford's success this
season. Rapid development could
mean another bowl game. Slow
development could get Stanford a
winning season at best.
But a bowl appearance is a le
gitimate possibility, and with
Walsh at the helm, Stanford fans
and alumni will probably accept
nothing less. To that end, fresh
men, along with other players
having little or no experience, are
being counted on to make an im
pact on this year's team.
"Freshmen may not start, but
they will play a lot right away,"
said Walsh. "Many will play on
special teams. ... They are pick
ing up the system very well."
In fact, coaches said the fresh
men look so promising that few
will be red-shirted. Most are too
good to waste.

"We feel we got
the best athletes in
the nation," said
Stenstrom, refer
ring to the 22-mem
ber recruiting class.
Openly offensive
While the offense of
Walsh and Sten
strom should prove
to be the strength of
this year's team,
new players are of
such quality that
many should be able
to contribute imme
diately.
"Mike Mitchell
and Greg Cornelia
are going to be
tremendous backs
for Stanford," said
Stenstrom. "It's just
a question of how
fast they'll develop."
Mitchell, a con
sensus high school
All-American and
two-time Arizona
state player of the
year, may be able to
contribute at either
halfback or fullback

very soon, according to coaches.
His size (6-0, 210 lbs.) and speed
are already at a level to allow him
to compete for the shallow back-
Held positions.
Coaches are equally impressed
with Cornelia, who, at 6-1 and 215
lbs., is slated as the fullback of the
future, drawing comparisons al
ready with Tommy Vardell, John
Volpe and Brad Muster. Mitchell
and Cornelia have been seeing
nearly as much practice time with
the first team as starters Ellery
Roberta and Ethan Allen.
However, the starting assign
ments of Allen and Roberts aDoear

to be theirs to lose. Coaches look at
Roberts in particular as the cen
terpiece of the running game, if
not of the offense.
"Ellery Roberts looks like a dif
ferent guy from a year ago," said
Walsh. "He's quicker and 10 lbs.
lighter. He's now a guy with a lot
of confidence. I don't know if
you'll see a better Pac-10 back."
"I love Glyn Milburn to death,
but there's no doubt that by the
end of last season, Ellery was the
go-to guy," said Stenstrom. "I
wouldn't be surprised if he be
came one of the top running backs
in the country."
Joining Roberts in the back
field will be Stenstrom, who en
ters his third season as the Cardi
nal's starting quarterback. Walsh
is looking for Stenstrom, who
owns a 17-4 record as the team's
starting signal caller, to lead the
offense by taking his game to yet
another level.
"Steve is learning to get rid of
the ball faster, and he's learning

quicker decision making," said
Walsh. "This year he has excellent
command of what he is doing. He
should be one of the best, if not the
best, quarterbacks in the West."
According to Walsh, the most
critical factor in the effectiveness
of Stenstrom and the rest of the
offense will be the play of the of
fensive line. But according to
Monte Clark, the new head offen
sive line coach and former head
coach of the NFL's San Francisco
49ers and Detroit Lions, the five
men up front should be better
than last year.
"The line is looking srood." said

Clark. "There's a lot of prospect,
especially with (center Sean) Ca
vanaugh, (right guard Jeff) Buck
ey and (right tackle Steve)
Hoyem. I'm really high on their
future. If some team doesn't take
Cavanaugh or Hoyem in next
year's draft, they'll be making a
big mistake."
Coaches are particularly im
pressed with Buckey, a sopho
more who will step into a starting
position after playing sparingly
last season.
"If there's something he
doesn't have, I don't know what it
is," said Clark.
"Out of the guards that I've
seen, he's one of the 10 best in the
country," said Cavanaugh, a fifth
year senior starting his third year
on the line. "By next year, he'll be
the top guard in the country."
By contrast, the wide receiver
position is neither deep nor expe
rienced. Justin Armour, after a
brief spring stint at tight end, will
return as the starting split end.

With size (6-6, 215 lbs.) and great
catching ability, Armour should
prove to be one of the top receivers
in the Pac-10.
However, the Cardinal lacks
any experienced receiver to com
plement Armour. David Shaw,
Ozzie Grenardo, Marlon Evans
and Andre Kirwan are all in the
hunt to see playing time at receiv
er, with starter Shaw as the only
one with a collegiate reception.
Newcomers should make an
immediate impact here, as well.
Junior college transfer Mark Har
ris was a JC All-American last
vear and has shown tremendous

catching ability, drawing compar
isons to Mike Cook and Chris
Walsh. Other big recruits at re
ceiver include freshmen prep Ail-
Americans Brian Manning and
Leroy Pruitt, both of whom
should see immediate action.
Senior Tony Cline will start at
tight end after marked improve
ment from last year, according to
the coaching staff. His backup will
be Paul Nickel, who played in
1991 but sat out last season for
personal reasons.
Wunderkind Eric Abrams re
turns as Stanford's kicker. Last
year, Abrams garnered Third-
Team Freshman All-America hon
ors after making 16 of his 20 field
goal attempts. His continued of
fensive production should remain
a key constant for the Cardinal.
Getting defensive
Although the offense will win
games for the Cardinal, the de
fense will have to come through if
Stanford wants to make a repeat

appearance on New Year's
Day.
"I'm very optimistic
about the offense," said
Walsh. "But defensively,
we do not have the same
expectations as we did last
year."
Inexperience and lack of
depth on the defensive pe
riphery could prove detri
mental. However, coaches
seem to think that the
new starters can come
through.
"The loss of Lynch,
George and the others . . .
we haven't been able to re
place them," said Walsh.
"We'll be at the lower end
speed-wise in the Pac-10,
but our response and ex
plosiveness might com
pensate."
With two returning
starters, the defensive
line should be able to
maintain that pressure up
front. Defensive end Ty
rone Parker, who should
be fully recovered from in
jury by Sept. 4 for Stan
ford's opening game
against Washington, and

nosetackle Jason Fisk
form two-thirds of a line that
should build on last year's suc
cesses at pressuring the passer
and stopping the run.
Two newcomers, David Carder
and Pete Swanson, will also see
extensive time on the line. Either
sophomore Swanson or Carder, a
junior with little playing experi
ence, could start at the third de
fensive line spot. Both have looked
excellent in practice, according to
coaches and fellow players.
In addition to the defensive
line, the most experience ! posi
tion is inside linebacker, junior
Cov Gibbs and senior Tobv Nor-

wood return as
starters, and with
senior Mark
Hatzenbuhlc r
backing up both,
the position
seems to be well
stocked with
tenacity and ex
perience.
However, the
remainder of the
defense, while
long on tenacity,
is still callow. The
sole exception to
that rule is
Vaughn Bryant,
who will start at
cornerback for
the third season.
After conference
honorable men
tion honors last
season, Bryant is
expected to be on 3
of the top corners
in the Pac-10, if
not the nation.
The other cor
nerback position
will belong to
Kwame Ellis. The
sophomore saw
extensive playing
time last year on
special teams as a
backup to Bryant
and possesses the
speed and cover
abilities neces
sary to be a solid
corner, according
to coaches.
Senior Tommy
Knecht, a con
verted quarter-

back, will start at strong safety.
Knecht, who has started games at
outside linebacker, makes up for
any lack in speed with strength
and alert play on the field; many
compare Knecht with last year's
starter, All-American John Lynch.
The performance of the sec
ondary will depend mightily upon
the outside linebackers' ability to
pressure the passer. But, again,
this position is wide open, with
early nods going to John Sims and
Jason Wingard.
Sims looks impressive, accord
ing to players and coaches.
Wingard, a converted tight end,
has the speed and size (6-4, 220
lbs.) necessary to play the posi
tion, but has played sparingly in
his Stanford career, and never on
defense.
Others likely to see plenty of
playing time at outside 'backer in
clude juniors Mike Hall and Brian
Batson, and frosh phenoms Brian
Batson and Nick Watts.
The punting duties will fall into
the hands of Aaron Mills, who, al
though lacking experience in this
area, definitely has a strong leg.
The special teams will suffer most
in the area of returns, where Mil
burn's absence will be sorely felt.
Rocky road ahead
Once again, Stanford has a very
difficult schedule, playing Notre
Dame and Colorado for two of its
non-conference games, and Wash
ington, Arizona and USC on the
road.
But according to players, the
challenging schedule is a benefit.
"You actually thrive on playing
the big games," said Stenstrom.
"We played Cornell a couple of
years ago and beat them 56-6.
That's no fun. Beating a good
team like Notre Dame back in
South Bend — that's what it's all
about."
Apparently, the preseason
prognosticators feel that Stanford
will overcome any development
problems; the Cardinal is ranked
anywhere from No. 10 to No. 15 in
the nation. Football News ranked
Stanford No. 2 behind Florida
State.
"We're flattered by the early
top 10 rankings, but more realisti
cally we are looking for a winning
season," said Walsh.
But the attitude around the

Stanford practice facilities seems
to say much more. Players are
practicing with intensity. Coaches
are optimistic. And although bowl
aspirations are not openly talked
about, the date "1 -1 -94 "is printed
on the practice shorts, exhibiting
the team's not-so-subtle goal to
make it to a New Year's Day bowl
game.

But will just any bowl game do?
For an answer, all one has to do is
look at the T-shirts worn by the
coaching staff and the players.
Printed on the back is "No Guts,
No Glory." And at the bottom is
printed the number "367." What
is 367?
The number of miles to the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
