# Genius meets Genesis
## 
### 
With three Super Bowl wins,
three winning seasons with the
Cardinal, induction into the
Football Hall of Fame and a
stint as NBC's number one pro
football analyst, the Rose Bowl
should be all that is left in Bill
Walsh's extraordinary coaching
career.
But it is not. Get ready for a
digitized Bill Walsh in the new
Sega Genesis video game, Bill
Walsh College Football.
When the game hits store
shelves next week, Walsh joins
the ranks of Michael Jordan,
John Madden, Tony La Russa
and Shaquille O'Neal. All en
dorse video games of their
sport.
In addition, Stanford and
48 other teams are represent
ed in the game, including
powerhouses like Alabama of
'92, Michigan of '85 and Ne
braska of '83. But due to Na
tional College Athletic Asso
ciation restrictions, the
names of the schools have
been modified and no names
are associated with the digital
football players.
"Notre Dame is named
South Bend," said Mary Snow,
Associate Publicist at Electron
ic Arts Sports, the company
that developed the game. "We
can give teams names like Al
abama because that is the name
of a state. "Stanford is Stanford
due to our relationship with
Walsh."
The game "very much re
flects Bill's philosophy and per
sonality," said Scott Orr, execu
tive producer for EA Sports.
Unlike the action oriented John
Madden Football video game,
Orr said BWCF emphasizes
teaching.
Walsh creates strategies for
the game buff, including defen
sive maneuvers for stopping the
"notoriously successful" triple
option play, said Orr, but rarely
will Walsh suggest the same
play twice.

"There is logic built into the
game so that Bill suggests dif
ferent strategies depending on
the match up," said Orr. "It is a
good way to take advantage of
Bill and his coaching expertise."
However, "The real teaching
element comes in with [Bill's]
explanation of the two teams'
strengths and weaknesses,"
said Orr.
With real scouting informa
tion that Walsh collected on last
year's top 24 teams, arm-chair
football players make the criti
cal decisions necessary to score
massive touchdowns.
Right now Walsh's advice is
printed on the screen, but, in a
CD version due out by the new
year, video Walsh will speak di
rectly to the game player.
The game is unique in that it
is the first video football game
in the United States with four
player capability. Players team
up to control their favorite posi
tions.
