# Dog days at UW
## 
### 
The most important date in
determining Stanford's Rose
Bowl aspirations may not be
Sept. 4, when the Cardinal bat
tles three-time defending Pac
-10 champ Washington in its
season opener. Instead, the Run
for the Roses could very well be
decided off the field, before the
season even starts.
On August 22, Pac-10 offi
cials are expected to announce
extensive penalties against the
Washington program, includ
ing a ban on post-season play
this year.
Washington has already ad
mitted to 17 of 31 alleged
NCAA improprieties, virtually
assuring itself of punitive mea
sures from the Pac-10. Includ
ed in the 17 is the admission of
the most publicized and damag
ing charge — that former quar
terback Billy Joe Hobert ac
cepted $50,000 in loans last
summer.
Meanwhile, a mixture of res
ignation and resentment has
settled upon the Seattle cam
pus, according to Wes Kelman,
news editor of the UW Daily.
"UW has a tarnished image,
and people are upset about this,
but most people feel everyone
else does it,"he said. "We feel
we are way more ethical than
Oklahoma, for example."
Kelman said there is plenty
of blame to go around for the
scandal, including a fanciful
conspiracy theory that has at its
insidious root, as a recent Daily
editorial wrote, "a pack of envi

ous Californians hell-bent on
exacting their revenge on once
proud National Champions."
Such California-phobia, Kel
man said, extends to the belief
that it is mainly Husky players
from the Golden State that are
giving the school a bad name.
"There is a feeling that if Wash
ington didn't recruit so many
Californians, the quality of
players would be higher."
However, Washington boost
ers, administrators and even
head coach Don James — gener
ally regarded as "a saint," Hel
man said — have come under
fire for the program's public hu
miliation.
In a speech to Stanford
alumni in May, Stanford coach
Bill Walsh jumped on the UW
bashing bandwagon, charging
that Washington ran an "out
law program" that made merce
naries of students. Walsh was
reprimanded by the Pac-10 for
the remark and later issued a
formed apology.
"It was taken out of con
text," quarterback Steve Sten
strom said of his coach's com
ments. "It was not directed at
Washington."
Though his words may well
be used as a motivational tool
for the Huskies, Walsh con
tends the fateful Aug. 22 deci
sion will not affect his team's
preparation for the opening-day
showdown.
"You have to detach yourself
from that," he said.
