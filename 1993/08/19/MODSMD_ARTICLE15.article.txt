# Mourning the Mansoleum
## Time and neglect have destroyed a once proud monument 
### Josh Green 
Once, a beautiful bronze
vase stood outside the
Mausoleum, and seniors
made sure that fresh flowers
would always be placed in it. A
large cactus garden planted by
Jane Stanford was a favorite
hangout for students, especially
couples.
Not any more. But nobody
cares.
In essence, the University has
decided that restoring the
memorial to its former glory is
not a priority in these budget
burdened times.
"If you have a choice are you
going to get a new typewriter for
the Stanford Daily office, or are
you going to put ivy on the walls
outside of it?" asked Bruce Wig
gins, project manager for facili
ties. "It's just a matter of priori
ties."
So today, most Stanford peo
ple don't even know that the
family that provided them with
one of the most beautiful cam
puses in the country lies beneath
an obscure, disheveled and for
gotten part of the Stanford land
scape, frequented more by va
grants by than scholars.
What a waste
It's easy to miss the Mausoleum
as you head down Campus Drive
West off of Palm Drive. If you
have a car, you're out of luck; the
road that leads to the Mau
soleum was blocked off with a
dead tree trunk a few years ago
and is riddled with potholes.
But if you really want to see
the final resting places of the
University's founders — Leland
Stanford, his wife Jane Lathrop
Stanford and son and University
namesake, Leland Stanford Jr.
— you can walk into the Arbore
tum.

Clearly, the place has seen
better days.
The Mausoleum itself is the
only place in the whole area that

is well-kept. The verdant lawn is threatened by the dead,
overgrown and yellowed vegetation around it.
Two sphinxes guard the front steps, unaware of the
weeds growing at the entrance. Two more watch over the
rear of the Mausoleum, where an empty wine bottle and
other refuse show that homeless people probably visit the
arboretum more than gardeners do
A few yards away from the Mausoleum, an old, musty
sleeping mat and a cardboard box were once the posses
sions of someone with nowhere to go. Traces of humans
— sun-bleached cigarette packs, playing cards, remnants
of food — are scattered around the area.
A famous, looming 300-year-old oak stands a few paces
away, its pruned dead branches in piles beneath it like
severed fingers. The diseased oak, supposedly Leland
Stanford Jr.'s favorite climbing tree, will be cut down
soon.

Small creatures rustling through desiccated, waist
high plant life sound like restless spirits and ghosts. The
only other sounds that break the dead silence are the faint
noises of trucks at nearby Stanford Shopping Center, a
world away.
Signs close to forgotten dirt roads proclaim, "No
Dumping."
High rank, low budget
The Mausoleum acts in an official capacity only once a
year. On Founder's Day, the Sunday closest to March 9
(Leland Stanford Jr.'s birthday), a procession of the uni
versity president, the senior class presidents and the
choir marches to the Mausoleum to lay flowers at its en
trance.
Then the site is forgotten for another year, except
when students descend upon it for an annual Halloween

night bash.
Curiously, the Stanford Histor
ical Society considers the Mau
soleum one of the "untouchables"
among other campus buildings,
according to Linda Long, a librari
an in the Special Collections Li
brary. It is untouchable because it
ranks high on the list of old build
ings the university does not want
to alter.
Yet its maintenance budget does
not reflect that importance.
Herb Fong, grounds division
manager, said that the Mausoleum
receives a limited budget of
$15,000 per year. Though he called
the amount "not a lot of money,"
Fong believes that it's adequate to
cover minimum maintenance.
"There are just a lot of other pri
orities." Fong said.
Wiggins, a Stanford graduate in
1948, recalls a time when the Ar
boretum was frequented by stu
dents and drew tourists daily.
He remembers that the paths
were well-defined, and after sunset
the cactus garden was a good place
for couples looking for privacy.
"If someone asks, 'Where were
you?,' and you answered, 'I was in
the cactus garden,' that meant
something," Wiggins said.
Wiggins thinks that the access
road should be repaired, so the
Mausoleum can once again at
tract visitors. The road was
closed a few years ago, because
vandals ran through the area late
at night.
Rich Kurovsky, director of The
Public Affairs Office, said that his
staff has been researching a possi
ble clean-up project for the Ar
boretum and Mausoleum. After
receiving a complaint from a near
by resident who had biked past the
Mausoleum with her family,
Kurovsky said he has been looking
into hiring volunteers to keep the
area clean. A concrete project pro
posal should be ready in a few
weeks, he said.

Armless angel
For now, though, the Mausoleum is a tableau of neglect.
Henry Lathrop, Jane Stanford's brother, is also buried in
obscurity a few yards away from the Mausoleum. The
weeds and rust on the gates surrounding the grave have
almost fully taken over. A statue of an angel with her head
in her arms, called the Angel of Grief by the historical so
ciety, is missing an arm.
An inscription on two marble slabs that once were part
of Leland Stanford Jr.'s temporary tomb reflects the eerie
decrepitude of the Arboretum. Perhaps Jane Stanford
foresaw the Arboretum's fate when she chose this part of
one of her favorite poems:
"Have I not under these whispering leaves,
Woven such dreams as young happy heart weaves
Shadows yet unto which life seemed bound,
And is it not, is it not haunted ground?"

tum.

Clearly, the place has seen
better days.
The Mausoleum itself is the
only place in the whole area that

is well-kept. The verdant lawn is threatened by the dead,
overgrown and yellowed vegetation around it.
Two sphinxes guard the front steps, unaware of the
weeds growing at the entrance. Two more watch over the
rear of the Mausoleum, where an empty wine bottle and
other refuse show that homeless people probably visit the
arboretum more than gardeners do
A few yards away from the Mausoleum, an old, musty
sleeping mat and a cardboard box were once the posses
sions of someone with nowhere to go. Traces of humans
— sun-bleached cigarette packs, playing cards, remnants
of food — are scattered around the area.
A famous, looming 300-year-old oak stands a few paces
away, its pruned dead branches in piles beneath it like
severed fingers. The diseased oak, supposedly Leland
Stanford Jr.'s favorite climbing tree, will be cut down
soon.

Small creatures rustling through desiccated, waist
high plant life sound like restless spirits and ghosts. The
only other sounds that break the dead silence are the faint
noises of trucks at nearby Stanford Shopping Center, a
world away.
Signs close to forgotten dirt roads proclaim, "No
Dumping."
High rank, low budget
The Mausoleum acts in an official capacity only once a
year. On Founder's Day, the Sunday closest to March 9
(Leland Stanford Jr.'s birthday), a procession of the uni
versity president, the senior class presidents and the
choir marches to the Mausoleum to lay flowers at its en
trance.
Then the site is forgotten for another year, except
when students descend upon it for an annual Halloween

night bash.
Curiously, the Stanford Histor
ical Society considers the Mau
soleum one of the "untouchables"
among other campus buildings,
according to Linda Long, a librari
an in the Special Collections Li
brary. It is untouchable because it
ranks high on the list of old build
ings the university does not want
to alter.
Yet its maintenance budget does
not reflect that importance.
Herb Fong, grounds division
manager, said that the Mausoleum
receives a limited budget of
$15,000 per year. Though he called
the amount "not a lot of money,"
Fong believes that it's adequate to
cover minimum maintenance.
"There are just a lot of other pri
orities." Fong said.
Wiggins, a Stanford graduate in
1948, recalls a time when the Ar
boretum was frequented by stu
dents and drew tourists daily.
He remembers that the paths
were well-defined, and after sunset
the cactus garden was a good place
for couples looking for privacy.
"If someone asks, 'Where were
you?,' and you answered, 'I was in
the cactus garden,' that meant
something," Wiggins said.
Wiggins thinks that the access
road should be repaired, so the
Mausoleum can once again at
tract visitors. The road was
closed a few years ago, because
vandals ran through the area late
at night.
Rich Kurovsky, director of The
Public Affairs Office, said that his
staff has been researching a possi
ble clean-up project for the Ar
boretum and Mausoleum. After
receiving a complaint from a near
by resident who had biked past the
Mausoleum with her family,
Kurovsky said he has been looking
into hiring volunteers to keep the
area clean. A concrete project pro
posal should be ready in a few
weeks, he said.

Armless angel
For now, though, the Mausoleum is a tableau of neglect.
Henry Lathrop, Jane Stanford's brother, is also buried in
obscurity a few yards away from the Mausoleum. The
weeds and rust on the gates surrounding the grave have
almost fully taken over. A statue of an angel with her head
in her arms, called the Angel of Grief by the historical so
ciety, is missing an arm.
An inscription on two marble slabs that once were part
of Leland Stanford Jr.'s temporary tomb reflects the eerie
decrepitude of the Arboretum. Perhaps Jane Stanford
foresaw the Arboretum's fate when she chose this part of
one of her favorite poems:
"Have I not under these whispering leaves,
Woven such dreams as young happy heart weaves
Shadows yet unto which life seemed bound,
And is it not, is it not haunted ground?"

in brighter, better days.
Once, a beautiful bronze
vase stood outside the
Mausoleum, and seniors
made sure that fresh flowers
would always be placed in it. A
large cactus garden planted by
Jane Stanford was a favorite
hangout for students, especially
couples.
Not any more. But nobody
cares.
In essence, the University has
decided that restoring the
memorial to its former glory is
not a priority in these budget
burdened times.
"If you have a choice are you
going to get a new typewriter for
the Stanford Daily office, or are
you going to put ivy on the walls
outside of it?" asked Bruce Wig
gins, project manager for facili
ties. "It's just a matter of priori
ties."
So today, most Stanford peo
ple don't even know that the
family that provided them with
one of the most beautiful cam
puses in the country lies beneath
an obscure, disheveled and for
gotten part of the Stanford land
scape, frequented more by va
grants by than scholars.
What a waste
It's easy to miss the Mausoleum
as you head down Campus Drive
West off of Palm Drive. If you
have a car, you're out of luck; the
road that leads to the Mau
soleum was blocked off with a
dead tree trunk a few years ago
and is riddled with potholes.
But if you really want to see
the final resting places of the
University's founders — Leland
Stanford, his wife Jane Lathrop
Stanford and son and University
namesake, Leland Stanford Jr.
— you can walk into the Arbore
tum.

Clearly, the place has seen
