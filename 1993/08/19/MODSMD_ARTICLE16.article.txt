## So long to warm summer nights on Terman Pond 
### 
But where do the ducks go?
The babbling waters and charming
faux marine life of Terman Pond have
suddenly disappeared with the com
mencement of the construction of an
annex to Terman Engineering Center
this month. Now, the sound of heavy
machinery and the glare of spotlights
greet studious Terman techies
"It seems like kind of a shame," said
one observer, who works at the Mitchell
Earth Sciences building across the
street from Terman. "People used to
eat their lunch here and relax."
However, the pond's vanishing act
won't last forever.
The new building, the Thornton Cen
ter for Engineering Management, is
scheduled to be completed by the begin
ning of the 1994-95 academic year, ac
cording to Facilities Project Manager
Vojka Ivanek.
Terman Pond, meanwhile, will re
turn as part of the new Litton Plaza,
which will be located between the two
buildings and will incorporate both Ter
man's oak grove and the pond. The
modified pond will be "narrower," with
a "mild slope from the upper level to a
pool level," Ivanek said.
Ivanek said the plaza is necessary to
establish the "visual connection" of the
new structure with the existing build
ing. In addition the pond will be re-in
stalled because the Engineering De
partment conducts ongoing experi
ments in the waterway.
The new two-story, 10,762-square
foot building will house several new lab
oratories and two 70-seat "case-study"
classrooms and will serve to increase
partnership between the Engineering
and Business schools in modern manu
facturing teaching and research.
In conjucntion with the unveiling of
the new building, both the Business and

Engineering schools are developing in
terdisciplinary courses taught by a vari
ety of instructors and disciplines.
The cost of the project, which is being
financed by private gifts, will likely be
upwards of $3 million, Ivanek said.

Because of conferences and research
being conducted at Terman, much of the
initial stages of construction — which
amount mainly to demolition of the
pond structure and the felling of some
trees near Terman — has taken place at

night.
Ivanek said the nocturnal activity
will continue for another week, after
which time construction will return to a
normal daytime schedule.

Construction crews demolish the former site of Terman Pond to make way for a new engineering building.
