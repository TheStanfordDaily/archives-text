# 'Unique' major hits end of road
## 
### 
Four Stanford students from the class of
1993 are the last of their kind.
This fall, the Department of Microbiology
and Immunology will no longer exist for un
dergraduates, because of a decision made
three years ago to discontinue the joint
m^jor.
The four students from the class of '93
who declared microbiology and immunology
were allowed to complete the joint
since the decision to discontinue it was made
after they had already declared.
Prof. Emeritus Robert Roan tree said the
department decided to discontinue the m^jor,
the only one in the medical school offered to
undergraduates, because there was little fac
ulty support at the undergraduate level.
"We were running a mqjor for a relatively
small department," said Roantree. "There
was too much work involved for the number
of students we were having."
According to Roantree, who served as an
adviser to almost all the undergraduates in
the department, about 10 students graduat
ed each year with microbiology and im
munology as their mqjor.
"I declared microbiology and immunology
my sophomore year and was then told spring
quarter that the mqjor had been canceled,"
said graduated senior James Mendoza, who
came to Stanford specifically for the m£yor.
"That's how my year ended."
Mendoza made many complaints to the
department, and his persistence finally paid
off.
The summer after his sophomore year,
Mendoza was told that he would be allowed to
do the mqjor so long as he completed all the
requirements by June, 1993.
Despite this news, he and the other three
students still experienced difficulties in con
tinuing the mtyor.
Mendoza explained that one required
course, Microbiology 101 A, a lab on tech
niques, was canceled halfway through the
quarter because there were only four stu
dents.
"The conundrum was that while the class
had to be canceled because it was too small,
three out of the four of us needed the credits

for the lab to complete the major," Mendoza
said.
The small number of students didn't keep
Roan tree from supporting the Unlike
other department members, he made efforts
to keep the major intact because he believed
the mqjor offered a unique opportunity.
"The microbiology and immunology
major added an extra dimension to the un
dergraduate curriculum and had been in
place for many years," Roan tree said.
But Mendoza acknowledged the faculty's
change in commitment to graduate-level
work.
"The microbiology and immunology
was created at a time when the faculty
had the brilliant stroke of genius that under
graduates are made from graduates," Men
doza said. "The reasons for why the faculty
wanted to end the mqjor are valid, but it's a
shame."
