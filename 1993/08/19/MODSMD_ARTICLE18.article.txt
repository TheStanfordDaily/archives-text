# Director Doty to leave Farm
## 
### 
If one had to pinpoint the person behind
Stanford's struggle to establish a balance
among development needs, a delicate envi
ronment and community outroar, it would be
Andy Doty.
Next week he is retiring, leaving behind
the position of director of community rela
tions in the Office of Public Affairs and three
decades of work at the University.
Along with being immersed in the Sand
Hill Road controversy, Doty has been in
volved with the construction of the Stanford
West housing complex between the road and
San Franrisquito Creek.
In general, he says he feels the University
has gone "beyond the EIR (Environmental
Impact Report] requirements in trying to be
a conscientious developer." For example, to
further ease the traffic in the 1,150-unit
housing complex at Stanford West, the Uni
versity has considered implementing a bus
system similar to the Marguerite.
Andy Coe, the government and public af
fairs manager at the Sun Microsystems Inc.,
will be Doty's successor.
Doty said he plans to remain on Palo Alto's

Comprehensive Plan Advisory Committee,
the Palo Alto school's 21st Century Commit
tee, and the Leadership Palo Alto Board.
