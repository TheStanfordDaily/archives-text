Provost, schmovost. What's an iddy-biddy
title next to an oil tanker?
Condoleezza Rice, Stanford's incoming
provost, isn't letting her new administrative
position slow her down. In a week, she will
travel to Rio de Janeiro to christen a 260-foot
oil tanker bearing her name.
Rice's namesake will be able to carry
132,000 tons of cargo — equivalent to about
42 million gallons of oil.
Rice will receive this rare honor because of
her membership on the board of directors of
Chevron, Corp., which is in the practice of
naming its tankers after their directors. In ad
dition to the tribute, she will receive a $25,000

annual retainer.
Rice will join the ranks of
former Secretary of State
George Shultz, co-founder
of Hewlett-Packard Co.
David Packard, former
Hewlett-Packard chairman
John Young, forest prod
ucts company executive
George H. Weyerhaeuser
and Bush administration
U.S. Trade Representative

Car la A. Hills, who all have tankers named
after them.
When she returns from the christening,
Rice will continue working toward the com
pletion of a book about German unification;
she is collaborating with Philip Zelico, a pro
fessor from Harvard.
With all this activity, though, she is not
shirking from her duties as provost. In May,
Rice was named the successor of interim
Provost Gerald Lieberman and will be sworn
in officially in the fall.
In the coming year, she will focus on un
dergraduate education, because of University
President Gerhard Casper's newly formed
commission, Rice said.
"We will spend a great deal of time trying to

keep Stanford excellent and move it forward
— even with the budget concerns," she said.
In the past few weeks and months, Rice
said she has attempted to acquaint herself
with the provost's office and has been trying
to talk to colleagues about their particular
concerns and aspirations. "It's been kind of
fun, actually."
