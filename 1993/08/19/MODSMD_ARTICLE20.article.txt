# Irish movement needs some luck

### 
The student leader of the Irish-American
Student Association at Stanford University,
Chip Cumin has received quite a bit of media at
tention outside of the Stanford community. His
student group and quest for a class on Irish-
American history at Stanford were perceived by
the national media as a white backlash.
After receiving national media attention,
one man read of Curran's group in the Wichi
ta paper and contacted Curran shortly after
wards, offering financial support.
National and international radio stations
have also picked up the story. Curran has par
ticipated in numerous interviews.including
stories run by UPI Radio and the BBC in
Northern Ireland.
"My main goal for the group is to provide a
forum for students" with academic interests
related to Irish-American history as diverse
as "the Civil Rights Movement in Ireland," or
"abortion in Ireland," Curran said.
Unlike the media's often tongue-in-cheek
attitude toward his group, Curran views its
purpose quite seriously. Curran said, "It is a
movement for a class" and for "our group,
which has not been studied."
Curran articulated how he understood
Irish-American studies to fit into the context
of multiculturalism at Stanford. "There have
been traditional studies, and since the sixties
groups that have been oppressed have been
studied," Curran said. "Ireland is the only
European nation which was a colony," Cur
ran said.
The group has communicated with Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart Thomas
as well as American Studies Prof. Joe Corn,
but no decisions about future Irish-American
classes have yet been made, Curran said.
