## Thompson bags six gold medals at Pan Pacifics 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Although Jenny Thompson is
often viewed as a sprint freestyle
specialist, she proved at last
week's Pan Pacific Champi
onships that she is as versatile as
she is explosive.
The junior from Dover, N.H.,
pocketed six gold medals at the
Pan Pacs, over a fourth of the
United States' total of 23 out of 34
races. Besides her victories in the
50-meter free, 100 free, 400 free
relay, 800 free relay and 400 med
ley relay, Thompson clocked a per
sonal best of 59.33 seconds to win
the 100 butterfly.
Even after notching the eighth
fastest mark of all-time, Thomp
son said she could have sliced a few
fractions off her time.
"I think I could have broken 59
if I hadn't jammed the finish,"
said Thompson, who bruised her
fingers at the finish when she hit
the wall mid-stroke.
"This gives me a lot of confi
dence for [the World Champi
onships] next summer," added the
recently-crowned 100 fly national
champion.
The Pan Pac veteran then
showcased her skills in the fly
when she swam the third leg of the
400 medley relay, instead of the
freestyle anchor. Thompson
clocked her leg at 58.70, the third
fastest split in history behind
"Madame Butterfly" Mary T.
Meagher and 1992 Olympian
Crissy Ahman-Leighton.
Thompson also won individual
Pan Pac titles in her better known
events, the 50 and 100 free. She
broke her own meet record in the
50 free with a time of 25.60, al
most two-tenths of a second better
than her old mark. Thompson
owns the ultra-sprint at Pan Pacs,
having won the last three.
Although she also won the 100,
in which she holds the world
record, Thompson was not happy
with her race.
"I was happy to win, but my
time was not where I wanted it to

be," she said after clocking 55.25,
nearly three-quarters of a second
over her world-record time. "Oth
ers have been faster this year in
the world. This is the first time
I've won the 100 free at Pan Pacs,
so I guess I'm happy."
On the same night she won the
50, Thompson anchored the 800
free relay, swimming after
Olympic teammates Nicole
Haislett, Janet Evans and new
comer Sarah Anderson. The
Americans, who set a mark of
8:06.28, were a second-and-a-half
faster than the runner-up Aus
tralians.
While Thompson bore probably
the most grueling schedule in
terms of number of races, senior
backstroker Lea Loveless also
logged time in multiple individual
events and the 400 medley relay.
Loveless and Barbara Bedford
have developed a heated rivalry in
their specialty, with Bedford win
ning the 100 and Loveless the 200
at the U.S. Long Course National

Championships two weeks ago.
At the Pan Pacs, the results
were reversed as Loveless, the
American record-holder, took the
100 on Friday and Bedford the 200
on Saturday. Bedford swam a per
sonal best (2:10.97) in her victory
and beat Loveless by nearly half a
second.
"I didn't expect to win that
race," Bedford said. "I have a lot of
respect for Lea. I think she's a
great athlete and I never expect to
do great against her."
Many of Stanford's nine
strong men's contingent didn't
fare as well as the women, with
most of their success coming in
the relays.
Backstroker Jeff Rouse led off
the United States 400 medley
relay foursome, who easily out
paced Australia in 3:39.52. Japan
finished third. Sophomore Joe
Hudepohl spearheaded the 400
free squad which won in 3:17.50.
On Sunday the 400 anchor, Jon
Olsen, edged out Hudepohl to cap

ture the 50 free title. Hudepohl
placed fourth in the 100 free, half
a second behind Olsen.
Several Cardinal swimmers did
touch first in their races, but they
were consolation finals. Derek
Weatherford won the 200 back
"B" final. Tyler Mayfield took the
"B" final in the 100 and 200
breast.
During the course of the meet
several up-and-coming swimmers
made their mark on the interna
tional scene. Allison Wagner, a 15-
year-old from Gainesville, Fla.,
started the year with a personal
best of 2:17.72 in the 200 individ
ual medley.
At the summer nationals she
dropped it to 2:14.54 and at Pan
Pacs she won in 2:12.54, more
than five seconds faster than eight
months ago. Her time was a meet
record and the second fastest time
ever by an American.
While youth made its mark on
the Pan Pacs, so did age. Two-time
Olympian, Janet Evans, grabbed

titles in her specialties, the 400
and 800 free, the former Cardinal
standout was expected to retire
after the 1992 Olympic Games in
Barcelona but decided to aim for
1996 in Atlanta.
"I really thought I was going to
retire, but I've always thought it
would be great to swim in an
Olympics in my own country, so
I'm going to take the next three
years season-by-season and see
what happens," she said.
Evans had a two-second cush
ion in the 400 and three-second
lead in the 800.
"My coach said to look at this
season as gravy on mashed pota
toes. I'm happy with the season
and this meet," said Evans, who is
taking a break until fall training
for the Short Course World Cham
pionships and will prepare, in
part, by running a marathon.
"We've thought about New
York, but we'll probably stay in
California. It has to be flat," she
added.

touch first in their races, but they
were consolation finals. Derek
Weatherford won the 200 back
"B" final. Tyler Mayfield took the
"B" final in the 100 and 200
breast.
During the course of the meet
several up-and-coming swimmers
made their mark on the interna
tional scene. Allison Wagner, a 15-
year-old from Gainesville, Fla.,
started the year with a personal
best of 2:17.72 in the 200 individ
ual medley.
At the summer nationals she
dropped it to 2:14.54 and at Pan
Pacs she won in 2:12.54, more
than five seconds faster than eight
months ago. Her time was a meet
record and the second fastest time
ever by an American.
While youth made its mark on
the Pan Pacs, so did age. Two-time
Olympian, Janet Evans, grabbed

titles in her specialties, the 400
and 800 free, the former Cardinal
standout was expected to retire
after the 1992 Olympic Games in
Barcelona but decided to aim for
1996 in Atlanta.
"I really thought I was going to
retire, but I've always thought it
would be great to swim in an
Olympics in my own country, so
I'm going to take the next three
years season-by-season and see
what happens," she said.
Evans had a two-second cush
ion in the 400 and three-second
lead in the 800.
"My coach said to look at this
season as gravy on mashed pota
toes. I'm happy with the season
and this meet," said Evans, who is
taking a break until fall training
for the Short Course World Cham
pionships and will prepare, in
part, by running a marathon.
"We've thought about New
York, but we'll probably stay in
California. It has to be flat," she
added.

Junior Jenny Thompson won the 100-butterfly, 50-and 100-free and a trio of relays at the Pan Pacific Championships held at Kobe, Japan
last weekend. The Olympian led all medal winners, as the United States took 23 gold medals, 11 silver and 11 bronze during the three-day
competition.
Although Jenny Thompson is
often viewed as a sprint freestyle
specialist, she proved at last
week's Pan Pacific Champi
onships that she is as versatile as
she is explosive.
The junior from Dover, N.H.,
pocketed six gold medals at the
Pan Pacs, over a fourth of the
United States' total of 23 out of 34
races. Besides her victories in the
50-meter free, 100 free, 400 free
relay, 800 free relay and 400 med
ley relay, Thompson clocked a per
sonal best of 59.33 seconds to win
the 100 butterfly.
Even after notching the eighth
fastest mark of all-time, Thomp
son said she could have sliced a few
fractions off her time.
"I think I could have broken 59
if I hadn't jammed the finish,"
said Thompson, who bruised her
fingers at the finish when she hit
the wall mid-stroke.
"This gives me a lot of confi
dence for [the World Champi
onships] next summer," added the
recently-crowned 100 fly national
champion.
The Pan Pac veteran then
showcased her skills in the fly
when she swam the third leg of the
400 medley relay, instead of the
freestyle anchor. Thompson
clocked her leg at 58.70, the third
fastest split in history behind
"Madame Butterfly" Mary T.
Meagher and 1992 Olympian
Crissy Ahman-Leighton.
Thompson also won individual
Pan Pac titles in her better known
events, the 50 and 100 free. She
broke her own meet record in the
50 free with a time of 25.60, al
most two-tenths of a second better
than her old mark. Thompson
owns the ultra-sprint at Pan Pacs,
having won the last three.
Although she also won the 100,
in which she holds the world
record, Thompson was not happy
with her race.
"I was happy to win, but my
time was not where I wanted it to

be," she said after clocking 55.25,
nearly three-quarters of a second
over her world-record time. "Oth
ers have been faster this year in
the world. This is the first time
I've won the 100 free at Pan Pacs,
so I guess I'm happy."
On the same night she won the
50, Thompson anchored the 800
free relay, swimming after
Olympic teammates Nicole
Haislett, Janet Evans and new
comer Sarah Anderson. The
Americans, who set a mark of
8:06.28, were a second-and-a-half
faster than the runner-up Aus
tralians.
While Thompson bore probably
the most grueling schedule in
terms of number of races, senior
backstroker Lea Loveless also
logged time in multiple individual
events and the 400 medley relay.
Loveless and Barbara Bedford
have developed a heated rivalry in
their specialty, with Bedford win
ning the 100 and Loveless the 200
at the U.S. Long Course National

Championships two weeks ago.
At the Pan Pacs, the results
were reversed as Loveless, the
American record-holder, took the
100 on Friday and Bedford the 200
on Saturday. Bedford swam a per
sonal best (2:10.97) in her victory
and beat Loveless by nearly half a
second.
"I didn't expect to win that
race," Bedford said. "I have a lot of
respect for Lea. I think she's a
great athlete and I never expect to
do great against her."
Many of Stanford's nine
strong men's contingent didn't
fare as well as the women, with
most of their success coming in
the relays.
Backstroker Jeff Rouse led off
the United States 400 medley
relay foursome, who easily out
paced Australia in 3:39.52. Japan
finished third. Sophomore Joe
Hudepohl spearheaded the 400
free squad which won in 3:17.50.
On Sunday the 400 anchor, Jon
Olsen, edged out Hudepohl to cap

ture the 50 free title. Hudepohl
placed fourth in the 100 free, half
a second behind Olsen.
