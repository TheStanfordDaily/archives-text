# Sawyer named interim coach
## Soccer to open 1993 season with ex-assistant at helm 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
Lan Sawyers, former assistant coach
under Berhane Andeberhan, was recently
named interim head coach for the women's
soccer team 1993 season.
"With the soccer season upon us, there
was not enough time for a thorough search,"
said Senior Associate Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick. "As a result, our search will
continue at the end of the upcoming soccer
season."
The Department of Athletics began look
ing for Andeberhan's replacement in the
spring and received over 50 applications for
the position.
Sawyers served as assistant coach for the
past two seasons, during which the Cardinal
notched a 34-4-1 record and was ranked in
the top 10.
Before coming to Stanford, Sawyers was
the director of soccer at the Mission Viejo
Soccer Club. His squad captured the na
tional championship in the 1990-91 sea
son. Sawyers was also the Olympic region
al coach in the Western Region for four
years.
"In lan, we have someone who is not only
very familiar with our team and the incom
ing recruits, but who also has a strong tech
nical knowledge of the game," Levick said.
"We are pleased lan has accepted this posi
tion and confident he will carry on Stan
ford's national reputation in women's soc
cer."
Sawyers not only has a soccer coaching li
cense from the United States Soccer Feder
ation but also an English soccer coaching li
cense. Sawyers played professionally for
Rotherham United in England before turn

ing to coaching.
"I am really excited to continue my in
volvement with the Stanford women's soc
cer program," Sawyers said. "With the re
turn of several veteran players and the addi
tion of the incoming freshman, the team has
great potential."
The biggest loss is center midfielder Julie
Foudy, a national team starter and Ail-
American, who graduated last spring.
Sophomore Carmel Murphy played under
study to Foudy last season will likely be
asked to fill that hole this year.
Returning for the Cardinal are an experi
enced fullback corps, goalkeeper Leslie Gar
rard and high-scoring forward Sarah
Rafanelli.
Stanford opens its season at home Sept. 4
with a match against UC-Davis.
Tournaments pack the Cardinal's sched
ule, as the squad takes a late September
jaunt to the rural south for the Arkansas
Tournament.
The following week Stanford hosts Notre
Dame, Texas Christian University and St.
Mary's in the Bank of America Cardinal
Classic.
After showdowns with USC and San
Diego State in the San Diego State Invita
tional, the Cardinal will face Duke and
North Carolina in the Challenge Club Col
lege Tournament.
The perennially powerful Tar Heels
racked up another national champi
onship last season, their seventh
straight, and are favored to take the title
again.
Stanford finishes up the regular season
with a Nov. 6 clash with Bay Area rival
Santa Clara, who beat the Cardinal in the
NCAA quarterfinals in 1992.
