## close encounters of the goodbye guy kind actor richard dreyfuss stakes out Stanford to share his secrets of the stage and screen by joel stein 
### 
If Bill Clinton can successfully merge
Washington and Hollywood, then it al
most seems fair to let Richard Dreyfuss
merge Hollywood with Stanford.
Like Clinton smoothly arranging to have
Sharon Stone sit next to him at a White
House dinner, Dreyfuss seemed to just slip
onto campus last week, a place he claims
he'd like to become more involved with in
the future.
But for now, Dreyfuss ("American Graffi
ti," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"
"Whose Life is it Anyway?") — along with fel
low actors Marsha Mason and Ann Jackson
— has fallen to the earth for a brief two-week
stay, teaching an acting seminar for amateur
and professional actors. The program, run by
the British American Drama Academy, is the
glitzy Hollywood sister to an eight-year old
Shakespearean program at Oxford.
Anthony Branch, a British actor who co
founded the Academy nine years ago, said he
was skeptical about establishing an insti-

tute where ac
tors could study
from film
celebrities — the
likes of which
have never be
fore been estab
lished.
"A lot of peo
ple said Ameri
can actors
weren't interest
ed — they just
wanted to make
money. I proba
bly pay Richard
Dreyfuss what
he makes for
breakfast."

The pat excuse
Dreyfuss gives to
his friends and
his accountants
for making the
world's poorest
economic deci
sion — teaching
— is that it will
ultimately help
his craft.
By presenting
techniques to a
class, he had to
force himself to
dissect his craft, a
process that took
more preparation
than he had an
ticipated, he said.
"Many years
ago I spent a lot
of time thinking

about it, but not since then. Teaching it re
minded me that I was doing it without much
scrutiny. That was one of the most frighten
ing things about coming here."
But Dreyfuss seemed more enamored of
the University setting than simply the op
portunity to study acting. From day one, he
became "Professor Dreyfuss" not only in
class, but on all memos and bulletins posted
in the halls of the drama department.
"It's on my tombstone: 'Professor Drey
fuss,'" he said. "I'm already looking for
tenure."
By the second day of the program, Drey
fuss could already be seen trucking through
campus on his rented bike with appropriate
ly professorial front-end basket. "I've al
ways assumed I would teach. But not acting.
History," he said.
Studying history — both Western and
East Asian — is a pastime Dreyfuss said he
hopes to turn into a full-time profession after
he retires from acting; even if it means teach -

ing junior college or high school. He said his
experience both in class and in tutorials with
the 30 students in the program only gave
him more confidence about teaching.
"I wanted to see what it was like to teach
students. And I would like to get a similar in
vitation in the History department."
Although he was comfortable in the
classroom, and looked almost academic ex
cept for his giveaway Hollywood sunglasses,
Dreyfuss said he didn't know how to ap
proach professors.
But a man who hires a political consultant in
order to involve himself in Washington politics
can certainly find a way to adapt to the world of
the university. And when he does, Stanford
wouldn't be a bad place to do it, he said.
"I had a kind of mythic image of Stan
ford," he said. "And for the most part its
been fulfilled."
Stanford meets de Mille
Along with Professor Dreyfuss' classes, the

seminar offers one-day guest lectures. And,
in the grand tradition of Hollywood, a subtle
combination of hob-nobbing and contacts
were the key to landing this year's guests.
Dreyfuss' appearance materialized after
a call from Anthony Branch's friend Marsha
Mason (Dreyfuss' co-star in "The Goodbye
Girl"). Guest lecturer Eli Wallach came at
the behest of his wife, Ann Jackson. And
guest lecturer Ed Asner was probably per
suaded to come by Dreyfuss, who shares
leftist political affiliations with the feisty
president of the screen actors guild. The per
mutations would make even Samuel Beck
ett dizzy.
Branch seems confident that he can go
back down to Malibu next year and come
back with similar catches. After taking his
acting school on the road for eight years,
passing through schools like Yale and Sarah
Lawrence, Branch said he is ready to settle
down at Stanford and start building an
American program to match the British one.

If the drama de
partment agrees
to handle the
program again
next year,
Branch intends
to double its size
and make it a
week longer.
Branch
said he liked
Stanford be
cause the
drama depart
ment was so
helpful in orga
nizing the pro
gram, particu
larly Assoc.
Prof. Michael
Ramseur and
Ron Davies, the
department ad
ministrator.
And, he admit
ted, unlike the
other schools he
looked into —
Boston Univer
sity, Brown,
Cornell, Chapel
Hill and USC -
Stanford of
fered the draw
ing appeal of it's
name. And not
just to the pay
ing students,
many of whom
traveled from
the East Coast.
"To im
press the actors
we picked Stan
ford, " he said.
