## Nowhere to run The 						Fugitive 
### 
Despite a career that spans four decades,
Harrison Ford's repertoire of expressions
hasn't increased past two; if he were in ele
mentary school, he'd be one of those kids who
gets held back year after year for a "lack of de
velopment." But for each of those two expres
sions — a dopey grin and an intense look that
represents fear, anger and surprise — Ford
has a role to match. He's spent his entire
movie career chasing others ("Blade Runner,"
"Frantic") or being chased ("Witness" and
much of the "Star Wars" trilogy), so it doesn't
come as any surprise that he's on the run in
"The Fugitive" — having hunted IRA volun
teers in "Patriot Games," it's time for him to
shift gears from Role One to Role Two.
Andrew Davis, unlike "Games" director
Philip Noyce, understands that we don't go
to Harrison Ford films for his acting, we go
for the action. So he wisely cuts to the chase;
the film opens with Dr. Richard Kimble's
wife (Sela Ward) being killed in grainy black
and-white — a shattering event that relieves
Ford of Expression Number One, the dopey
grin. All of the evidence points to Kimble, so
no one believes his story about the one
armed man he claims murdered his wife. As
a result, he's sentenced to death, which ex
plains Ford's subsequent reliance on Expres
sion Number TVvo.
On his way to death row, some of Kimble's
fellow felons attempt a breakout that culmi
nates in a bus-train collision. Good Samari
tan Kimble pauses to help a black prison
guard out of the bus, allows a black inmate to
unlock his shackles, then admonishes said
inmate to "be good." With that, Ford kicks
into perpetual motion, which Davis captures
in crystal-clear slo-mo, turning Kimble into
a modern-day version of America's first ac
tion hero — Hawkeye of "Last of the Mohi
cans."
Since Ford is wrapped up in the action, it
falls on the rest of the cast to provide the act
ing. Unlike Kimble, they more than acquit
themselves, led by Tommy Lee Jones' Deputy
U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard. Jones plays Ger
ard as an intelligent mongrel — part retriev
er, part greyhound and all pit bull; once he
catches a whiff of Kimble's scent, he won't
give up the chase. He takes the serviceable di
alogue that the screenwriter provides him
and delivers the lines so oddly that we think
we're hearing verse; yet somehow it's entirely
appropriate, and we could listen to him
speak for the rest of the film without getting
bored. Like fellow character actors Gene
Hackman and John Malkovich, Jones' work
is so effortless that you can't believe he's act
ing; if he weren't such a generous performer,
he'd upstage everyone around him.
The script isn't much more than a coat
rack upon which Davis hangs a few enter
taining set pieces. Once Ford gets back to his
hometown of Chicago, writers Jeb Stuart and
David Twohy throw us a curve ball by having
Ford track down the one-armed man, syn
thesizing Ford's archetypal Roles One and
Two; however, the fear of being caught res
cues him from having to add another expres
sion. At this point, the film changes from a
chase picture into a muddled medical mys
tery that's particularly annoying, since it
doesn't grow out of what's already happened,
giving us no opportunity to solve the crime
along with Kimble — in fact, some of us will
be confused even after he figures out what's
going on.
The film can only end one way, but despite
our cheers, it doesn't satisfy us. Perversely, we
don't want him cleared; instead, we want him

to keep running so that Gerard can keep chas
ing him — a Sisyphusian pas de deux for the
'90s. Perhaps they'll turn it into TV series.
