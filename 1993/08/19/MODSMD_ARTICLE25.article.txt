# Marked for death
## Manhattan Murder Mystery 
### 
Say goodbye to Mia Farrow, Woody
Allen's leading woman for more than a
decade. Diane Keaton, who held that role for
quite a stretch herself, is back. Cynics may
snipe that Allen only settled for her after he
discovered that Soon-Yi couldn't act, but
whatever the circumstances of Farrow's de
parture from Allen's company, Keaton's re
turn is a boon. Her loopy, unbalanced excite
ment brings "Manhattan Murder Mystery,"
Allen's new film, a large dose of the riotous
humor that Allen's films at times seemed to
have lost in recent years.
The film opens with Larry (Allen) and
Carol (Keaton) being corralled into coffee
with an old couple that lives across the hall in
their apartment building — a fate worse
than death for Larry, who hilariously tries to
escape — and really gets moving when the
old woman suddenly dies days later.
After meeting the complacent old couple,
Carol, who has worried aloud to Larry that
they might be turning old and boring them
selves, sees a possibility for renewed excite
ment in the old woman's death — perhaps
the old man murdered her. Larry's not buy
ing, so Carol calls their old writer friend Ted
— a congenially lecherous Alan Alda — and
imagines elaborate murder schemes with
him. Before we know it, she breaks into the
old man's apartment and rifles through his
mail.
For the first time in years, Allen obsesses
over something other than death, morality
and the state of humankind. First he worries
about Keaton's state of mind, then about her
increasingly intense friendship with Alda,
and, finally, about what he might have done
to cause the whole situation.

When Larry finally resolves to make his
relationship with Carol better, and joins her
in her quest to solve the mystery, it's a touch
ing tribute to adult responsibility, and to the
lesson he first began exploring with the do
mesticities of "Husbands and Wives" — the
"mysteries" in life worth solving arc often
right under your nose.
But none of this weighty stuff can ob
scure the fact that "Manhattan Murder
Mystery" is a comedy as well, with some of
the best slapstick Allen has turned out in
years. Add to this Anjelica Huston's star
turn as a New York male intellectual's wet
dream — she dresses in black leather, put
herself through college playing poker and
writes novels that "make 'Finnegan's Wake'
look like airplane reading" — and a slew of
classic Allen one-liners — "there's nothing
wrong with you that can't be cured with
Prozac and a polo mallet" — and the result
is richly hilarious.
"Manhattan Murder Mystery" isn't
"Annie Hall"; the ending is rushed and far
too neatly resolved, tying up all the loose
ends that make Keaton's search for midlife
meaning interesting. But its "Bananas"
meets "Husbands and Wives" style seems
an appropriate direction, both artistically
and personally, for a man who's learned
the hard way that relationships can be
both painfully difficult and comically ab
surd.
