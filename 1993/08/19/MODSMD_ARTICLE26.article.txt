Cliffhanger
The Italian Stallion takes a half step toward
recovery with this "Die Hard-on-a-moutain
top" flick. Renny Harlin — who directed Die
Hard II — provides Stallone with a dizzying
set of action sequences that will leave you
quaking in your multiplex. Unfortunately,
Sly's heavy hand fell on the screenplay, be
stowing upon us the lamest wisecracks this
side of "Howard The Duck." R

Like Water For Chocolate
In Mexico, hot chocolate is prepared by
adding cocoa to boiling water. So when a
person is sexually aroused, they are termed
"like water for chocolate." The youngest
daughter of ranching family is forced to stay
at home with her mother despite the atten
tions of a virile suitor. But her passion can't
be contained, so she releases it in the food
that she painstakingly prepares. A delec
table banquet of love, magic and food
served up by Mexican director Alfonso Arau.
Not Rated
Menace II Society
John Singleton's boyz couldn't hang in the
Hughes brothers' 'hood — they wouldn't last II
minutes. Caine Lawson, having just graduated
from high school, tries to survive a long, hot
summer on Los Angeles' mean streets. But
when a simple liquor store run turns into a
homicide, it kicks off a series of events that can
only end in death or a disappearing act. An im
pressive debut. R
Much Ado About Nothing
Don't let the title fool you. Kenneth Branagh
whips out a Bardful of tricks to bring this
Shakespearean comedy to the screen. Two
sets of couples — Benedick and Beatrice,
Claudio and Hero — fight, fuss and fall in
love in a picturesque 18th century Italian
villa. Though the American actors (Keanu
Reeves and, surprisingly, Denzel Washing
ton) can't really hang, the largely British
cast pulls off a bawdily magical comedy.
PG-13
What's Love Got To Do With It
If nothing else, this movie teaches us that
Tina Turner knew how to roll with the many
punches that fate — and husband Ike —
kept throwing at her. From a church choir in
Nutbush, Tenn. to opening for the Rolling
Stones, Angela Bassett does her best to
capture Tina's electrifying stage presence.
Still, Laurence Fishburne steals the show as
her talented terror of a husband. Check it
out. R
In The Line of Fire
No, it's not a classic. But it is the best mass
entertainment film to come out of Hollywood
this year — Spielberg, Schwarzenegger
and Seattle-based insomniacs included.
Clint Eastwood stars as a Secret Service
agent haunted by his failure to save JFK in
'63. thirty years later, can he stop an un
known psychotic (John Malkovich) from
causing lightning to strike twice? Take a
hint from Clint's tagline — "That's not
gonna happen" — and put your money on
the real last action hero. R
