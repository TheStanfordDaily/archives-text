## Editorial Editor's farewell 
### 
May the spirit of
of the summer be
with you always

I FAT TIMES WE seemed
thoughtless, forgive us.
If on occasion we were
snide, sensational or sim
plistic, please know we did it
with the best intentions.
The Stanford Daily is an
award-winning newspaper
with a proud tradition of
honest reporting, straight
forward writing and care
ful editing. It also has a tra
dition of being a little bor
ing.
In an effort to put out a
professional product, The
Daily sometimes over-com
pensates by shying away
from irreverent or uncon
ventional prose. Editors
tend to be suspicous of sto
ries that aren't "straight
news." The result is a paper
that too often reads like a
copy of The New York Times
— from 1912.
This summer, we tried to
deliver what conservative
guru John McLaughlin
might call "a complete meta
physical rollback," and long
time readers might term "a
lighter, zippier flavor."
Our staffers, accustomed
to laboring over endless sto
ries about ASSU meetings
and indirect costs, were, by
the end of the summer, argu
ing over whether Psy
choblader should or
shouldn't be included in
"The 15 Most Intriguing
People at Stanford."
The staff made this tran
sition without ever losing
touch with their journalistic
roots. They produced high
quality, investigative stories,
all the while knowing their

cover would boast a picture
of a cheerleader in mid
flight. They had fun without
sacrificing quality. And it
translated into a better,
more readable product.
We learned that a newspa
per can be interesting with
out being sensational. That
creative writers and editors
can be molded into success
ful journalists without
squelching the creative
spark.
And we discovered that
talent isn't linear: a sports
writer can whip news sto
ries into shape, a photogra
pher can conduct lucid in
terviews and a receptionist
can turn out to be an in
spired writer.
I hope that when next
year's editors look back on
the nine issues we put out
this summer, they don't dis
miss us as an alien entity —
a weekly magazine separate
and apart from their daily
newspaper.
And I hope they realize
that The Daily can change
for the better without giving
up an inch of the profession
alism and respect it has
achieved for more than 100
years of hard work and dedi
cation.
Because starting next
month, I'm gong to be mak
ing the transition from
writer to reader. And I want
The Daily to translate the
fun, enjoyment and excite
ment I've eryoyed as an edi
tor into the words I'll be
reading.
But, then again, even we
couldn't make those indi
rect-cost stories interesting.

of the summer be
