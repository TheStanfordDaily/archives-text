## Just say 'I do' 
### 
I'M GETTING MARRIED.
Never mind when. Or to
whom. Minor details, those.
The question is, to say "I do" or
not to say "I do"?
"I don't," alas, is not an op
tion.
It's all or nothing, people. And
I want it all. I want the band, the
limo, the ice sculptures, the
whole ostentatious white-cake
and-rental-tux thing. I want the
SCUBA apparatus, the tattoo
artists, the presidential look
alikes. I want bread machines.
My mom will be thrilled.
To parents, a wedding is a
photo-op worth a lifetime of grad
uations. To the rest of us, it's the
sugar-coated nadir of an outdat
ed, heterosexist institution that
inevitably ends in either children
or divorce — or both. But it's as
much a part of the American
Dream as a talking mouse.
Especially in college, when
every conversation eventually
works its way around to mar
riage. Especially in the summer,
when every mail delivery carries
the threat of another very large,
very stiff, very white envelope —
another childhood friend or
drinking buddy lost. Especially in
the 90s, when monogamy isn't
just a trend, but a matter of life
and death.

Forget midterms — we've got
marriage on the mind.
In fact, we're obsessed. This
goes way beyond biological clocks.
The looming spectre of congugal
bliss brings out our deepest inse
curities like high school gym class
never could. One friend is sudden
ly convinced he's going bald. An
other worries that his legs are too
hairy. And I just found a tiny blue
vein on my left calf.
At this stage in life, every lit
tle imperfection take on crush
ing significance, because who's
going to want to marry a
bald/hairy/veiny person? An irra
tional fear, of course, but a very
real one.
In the great mating ritual we
call marriage, there's no room for
errors, especially genetic ones.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Darwinism in action.
As an ingenuous freshman, I
overheard a battle-scarred senior
discussing a recent breakup:
"Once I realized we weren't going
to get married, there wasn't any
point." No wonder there's no dat
ing at Stanford.
And now I'm about to become
that battle-scarred senior. And,
frightening as it is, I'm beginning
to understand.
We all grew up thinking we'd
be married by 22, just like Mom

and Dad. Married and rich. Then
we did some math and realized we
won't even be out of college by 22,
and will probably be deeply in
debt. And if there's one thing we
learned from Jane Austen, it's
that you can't get married with
out money.
But we do it anyway. Our very
own Memorial Church churns
out hundreds of newlyweds per
year, all of them Stanford-affili
ated. And that's not including all
the people who get married off
campus. Or the people you went
to high school with. Or the people
in Australia. Or Julia Roberts.
Call it peer pressure if you
must, but the fact is most of us
will marry someone sooner or
later, and it might as well be
sooner, before all the good ones
get snapped up.
Do it for your parents. Do it for
the gifts. Do it for the tax break.
Do it, if only to see what happens
when you get everyone you've
ever known together in the same
tinsel-strewn hotel ballroom.
I'm going to do it. And you're
all invited.

blue veins are sexy. Especially
