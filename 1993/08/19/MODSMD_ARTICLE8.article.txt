## Membership has its privileges â€” and its petty problems 
### 
Your feature article, "Selling
the Farm" (July 22) and the as
sociated editorial reveals a
ridiculous and selfish myopia.
Though Stanford has invested in
superb facilities, it seems you
would have them sitting idle
during the summer months
rather than being enjoyed by
hundreds of children and adults
who will not be or were not for
tunate enough to spend four
years here.
By your reasoning, a letter of
acceptance justly differentiates
those who should and should not
use the vacant fields, courts,
classrooms and dorm rooms.
Membership certainly has its
privileges.
Moreover, you easily denigrate
the innocent cheerleaders, sports

campers and corporate executives
who subsidize your education,
while forgetting that this "venera
ble institution" has cheerleaders of
its own, pays handsomely to re
cruit and support its own sports
teams, and sends many of its grad
uates off to work at places like
State Farm.
Your stance is particularly
troubling given the financial dif
ficulties the University faces. If
your wish comes true and the
dreaded campers are forced to go
elsewhere, would you not be the
first to protest the associated tu
ition increases? Or maybe you'd
advocate cutting library re
sources some more? The admin
istration should be praised, not
criticized, for finding creative
ways to alleviate its budgetary
problems.
Besides, universities are
uniquely suited for hosting
week-long athletic camps and, to
a lesser extent, extended confer
ences. In addition to the added
income, these benefit Stanford

by building ties to the local and
business communities, thereby
increasing its support (political,
financial, etc.) within these im
portant non-academic circles.
While there may be question
able practices on the part of a
few organizations regarding de
partmental sponsorship and the
use of the Stanford name, these
abuses merely warrant greater
diligence at the administrative
level, not abolition.
While some here at Stanford
liken it to a country club, its aca
demic reputation outside the
Farm remains formidable. Gen
uine issues, like rampant grade
inflation, lax policies regarding
dropping and failing classes, and
shoddy student journalism do
much more to tarnish Stanford's
image than its hosting summer
camps for high school yearbook
editors.
Then again, your sentiments
guarantee that one rather unflat
tering element of Stanford coveted
reputation remains intact: the petty

snobbery of some of its students.
