SHARKS SHOOT OH
THIS END TWICE
If you can't make it to every Sharks game in
the new San Jose Arena, don't worry. Here's
how you can be in the seats you want, for the
games you want, without breaking your schedule,
your budget or a sweat.
Introducing the eleven-game
or more hockey season
Just pick out the one or more of these
introductory-size eleven game plans that fits you
best. SharkPaks allow you to buy part or all of the
Sharks schedule in eleven-game sets, letting you
design your own hockey season.
With a SharkPak, about twice a month you will be
able to see the best teams in the NHL from the best
seats in hockey. And for those of you can never get
enough hockey, there are still excellent season
seats available.
More than a great seat
Along with this experience, plan holders will get
"Shark Stats," hot-off-the-ice information about both
teams before each game and "Rink Report," the
Sharks official year round newsletter.
Come on down or up
To our loyal North Bay fans, we have not deserted
you, we've only moved about forty minutes south.
And to our new fans in the South Bay who have
waited for this opportunity for two years, the
Sharks especially offer these plans to all of you.
For best seats, mail in this coupon as soon as
possible.
We've moved so that more of you can come and
see us at your convenience.
