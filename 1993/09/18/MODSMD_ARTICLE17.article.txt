# Kevin Garnett proves to be a diamond in the rough
## Senior free safety leads inexperienced Cardinal defense into battle with Buffaloes 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
For three years, Stanford free
safety Kevin Garnett has watched
and waited.
He has backed up standout de
fensive backs like Darrien Gordon,
John Lynch and Seyon Albert.
Now, the time has come for Gar
nett to step into a starting role, and
he has wasted no time in showing
that his new status suits him well.
He currently leads the Cardinal
with 17 unassisted tackles and 27
total tackles this season, including
three tackles for a loss. He has also
intercepted one pass and deflected
another in two games.
Garnett, a 5-11, 190-pound se
nior from Naperville, 111., was orig
inally recruited as a running back,
but was converted to cornerback
prior to the 1991 season. He re
sponded by becoming an outstand
ing backup player, contributing ex
tensively on special teams while
recording three tackles in the 1991
season and nine tackles (seven
unassisted) as a junior.
His aggressive playing style and
hard hits have provided some relief
to a Cardinal secondary that has
given up 565 passing yards in the
first two games. His prowess in
those two games prompted Walsh
to name him defensive captain for
tonight's game. "Kevin really has
been waiting his turn for a long
time, and he's played very well,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"He has probably been our most
consistent performer defensively."
Despite his accomplishments,
Garnett was modest about his role
in the Cardinal seconday. "[My
role] is just to try and play the best
I can, and execute, " Garnett said.
"I'm just another player, trying to
get the job done."
Garnett will spearhead new de
fensive schemes added this week by
defensive coordinator Fred VonAp
pen to contain the explosive Col

orado receiving corps. "We've got a
few new defenses in this week, and
we're just trying to tighten up our
coverage and play a lot of one-on
one coverage we should be all
right," Garnett said.

Stanford fans likely remember
Garnett's brother Dave, who com
bined with Ron George over the
last three seasons to form one of
the best outside-linebacking corps
in Cardinal history. He is currently

playing for the Minnesota Vikings
after signing as a free agent.
"[Dave's] doing really well," the
younger Garnett added. "He's a
second-team outside linebacker
and he's playing a lot of special

teams."
If defensive prowess runs in the
family and Kevin Garnett contin
ues his agressive play, the Cardinal
secondary will have a lot to look
forward to this year.
