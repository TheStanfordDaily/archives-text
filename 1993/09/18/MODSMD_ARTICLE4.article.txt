# Stanford hopes to avoid Buffaloes' stampede
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
Stanford resumes its series with
Colorado today after a one-year
hiatus. The last time these two
teams met, Colorado quarterback
Darian Hagan led the Buffaloes'
option-style offense against an im
posing Cardinal defense anchored
by defensive backs Darrien Gordon
and Albert Richardson, and line
backers Ron George and Dave Gar
nett.
Further, quarterback Jason
Palumbis and Ail-American run
ning backs Tommy Vardell and
Glyn Milburn drove the Cardinal
against an impressive Colorado de
fense led by cornerback Deon Fig
ures and defensive tackle Leonard
Renfro. In that game, Dennis
Green coached the Aloha Bowl
bound Cardinal to a 28-21 victory
over the Buffaloes.
Since that time, much has
changed on both sides of the field.
Green has moved on to coach the
Minnesota Vikings, giving way to
Bill Walsh. Vardell and Milburn
have launched successful careers
with the Cleveland Browns and
Denver Broncos, respectively; Fig
ures, Renfro, and Hagan have also
made key contributions in Pitts
burgh, Philadelphia, and with the
Canadian Football League's
Toronto Argonauts.
Bill Walsh will look for an en
core performance from the Cardi
nal today. Stanford will face a Col
orado team that has dominated its
early-season opponents, outscor
ing them 81-35 in the last two
games and 56-7 in the first half.
The Buffaloes have also outgained
their opponents by a 1,065-yard to
877-yard margin.
Colorado's new pass-oriented
offense is led by junior quarterback
Kordell Stewart and an Ail-Ameri
can wide-receiving corps of Charles
Johnson and Michael Westbrook.
Last week against Baylor, Johnson
scored three touchdowns while

Westbrook scored one. Colorado's
running attack features junior La
mont Warren, who led the Buf
faloes in rushing last year, and
fifth-year senior James Hill, both
of whom have gained over 120
yards each in their first two games.
Leading the Stanford offense
will be senior quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, who completed 30 of 39
passes for 330 yards and a career
high four touchdowns last week.
After two games in 1993, Sten
strom has put up numbers that
rank him among the best in college

football, completing 47 of his 71
passes (.662) for 521 yards and five
touchdowns in two games.
For the second consecutive
week, Stanford will start two fresh
men, Brian Batson and Nick Watts,
at outside linebacker. Stanford
coach Bill Walsh sees promise in
the new squad members; "[They]
have a lot to learn, but they're ex
cellent athletes; they're very active
and quick, and I think they'll be
outstanding players as a combina
tion," said Walsh.
However, Walsh acknowledged

Batson and Watts may commit a
few errors due to a lack of experi
ence. "They'll make their share of
mistakes, which they made last
week that hurt us a little bit, but
that's the only way, really, that we
can get them ready," Walsh added.
"They're the logical successors to
[Dave] Garnett and Ron George
and I think they're as good as [Gar
nett and George] would have been
had they been freshmen."
According to Walsh, the Stan
ford defense will have to rise to the
occasion today if the Cardinal hopes

to win. In their first two games, the
porous Cardinal defense has given
up 1,116 yards of total offense.
"[Colorado is] distinctly better than
Washington and San Jose State on
offense; they're averaging on of
fense what we're giving up on de
fense, " said the Stanford coach.
"We hope that the matchup of
[playing] styles will be in our best
interests, and that our approach to
the passing game and running
game will be more difficult for Col
orado to [defend] than Baylor or
Texas was."

The Cardinal relies on its youthful defenders, such as linebacker Nick Watts, to frustrate opposing teams.
