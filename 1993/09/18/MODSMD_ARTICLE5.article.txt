# Cardinal beats Spartans; succumbs to Washington
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Stanford coach Bill Walsh arrived in Seat
tle for the September 4 season-opener
against Washington clad in Groucho Marx
glasses, mustache and nose to lighten up a
less-than-friendly welcoming committee
waiting to greet him and left probably
wishing he had kept the costume on to dis
guise his disappointment after the Huskies
pounded the Cardinal 31-14.
Last Saturday, there was no need for a
disguise. Walsh left the Stanford Stadium
field smiling as Stanford recorded its first
win of the 1993 football season over South
Bay rival San Jose State.
Yet, until the final minutes, Walsh proba
bly was prepared to go incognito once again.
After trailing for most of the fourth quarter,
Stanford was able to take the lead when
quarterback Steve Stenstrom tossed a 14-
yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David
Shaw with just under two minutes remain
ing.
However, San Jose State was far from fin
ished. Quarterback David Garcia, starting at
the Spartans' own 20-yard fine, marched his
team to the Cardinal 37 in four plays. But se
nior cornerback Vaughn Bryant who saw
limited action due to an injured hamstring
intercepted Garcia with 56 seconds left to
preserve a 31-28 Stanford victory.
"They had us off-balance the entire day,"
said Walsh of the Spartans. "I don't know if

we even slowed them down. But just by attri
tion we were sble to come back and win the
game."
Garcia gave the young Stanford defense
fits. While he completed 23 of 37 passes for
380 yards and a touchdown, he was also San
Jose State's second-leading rusher on the
day. When his receivers were covered, Garcia
did not hesitate to scramble, racking up 74
yards and two touchdowns on the ground.
"He's just a great, spontaneous player,"
Walsh said. "I just feel he's the best we'll see
all year. He almost singlehandedly [won the
game]."
In contrast to the Washington game,
Stanford got some offensive production of its
own through a better performance by the of
fensive line in protecting Stenstrom. Against
the Huskies, the senior signal-caller was
sacked six times and threw two intercep
tions. But Stenstrom spent the majority of
last Saturday on his feet. With fullback
Nathan Olsen brought in on passing downs
to provide extra blocking, Stenstrom had
plenty of time to find his receivers, and
burned the Spartans by completing 30 of 39
passes for 330 yards and four touchdowns.
This included a 51-yard scoring strike to
flanker David Shaw in the second quarter.
"They(the offensive line) did a great job,"
Stenstrom said. "I knew they were going to.
Washington caused them to have a lot of
breakdowns, but this is the type of game
