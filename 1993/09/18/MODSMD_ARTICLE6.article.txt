# Johnson and Westbrook lead Colorado passing attack

### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
If Stanford hopes to win today,
the beleaguered Cardinal sec
ondary will have to contend with
Colorado's explosive receiving
corps of Charles Johnson and
Michael Westbrook. The two re
ceivers have been referred to by
many as the best pair of wide re
ceivers in the nation. Both are solid
candidates for the Heisman trophy
and All-Am erica honors. Last sea
son, Johnson and Westbrook be
came just the fourth pair of re
ceivers in NCAA history to each go
over 1,000 yards receiving in the
same season.
Johnson, a 6-1, 185-pound se
nior from San Bernadino, Calif,
leads the Buffaloes this season
with 10 receptions for 210 yards
and three touchdowns. He scored
all of these touchdowns last week
against Baylor, including one on a
spectacular hail-maiy pass deflec
tion off of fellow receiver West
brook. He is Colorado's all-time
leader in receiving yardage, with
1,480 yards.
Johnson's off-the-field statis
tics are equally impressive. As a

marketing major at Colorado, he
graduated in only three years, a
feat accomplished nationwide by
only 23% of college students and
very few college athletes. "I set my
goals to [graduate] in three years,
and it was a very difficult task a
lot of hard work, a lot of stress, "
Johnson said. "I made a few sacri
fices I didn't go out to parties
and everything like that. I stayed
in and studied, and I was commit
ted to pulling that goal off."
Westbrook, a 6-4, 210-pound ju
nior from Detroit, Mich., is an ex
cellent complement to Johnson.
Westbrook is second among Col
orado receivers in career recep
tions with 108, three behind leader
Monte Huber, and has caught at
least three passes in 10 straight
games. In the 1991 meeting be
tween Colorado and Stanford, he
scored on a 20-yard pass from Dar
ian Hagan to give Colorado a 14-7
lead in a game that Stanford even
tually won 28-21.
Johnson has nothing but posi
tive things to say about his fellow
pass-catcher. "Michael Westbrook
is a great receiver; I personally feel

Charles Johnson (9) and Michael Westbrook (81), both leading candidates for the Heisman Trophy, are a
devastating one-two punch for the Colorado offense.
