# Colorado/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Johnson, a senior, is considered
by many to be the premier wide re
ceiver in the country and a leading
candidate for the Heisman Tro
phy. Last week, he scored three
touchdowns in the Buffaloes' 45-
21 rout of Baylor. He is Colorado's
all-time leader in receiving
yardage with 1,575 yards. Bryant,
also a senior, is the most experi
enced cornerback in the young
Cardinal secondary. He has start
ed for the past two seasons and led
the Cardinal last season with five
interceptions.

As if Johnson wasn't tough
enough for the Cardinal to handle,
Westbrook, a junior, packs an
equally impressive punch. The 6-4,
210-pound wide receiver is four re
ceptions shy of becoming Col
orado's all-time receiving leader,
and scored one touchdown last
week against Baylor. Ellis, a
sophomore, was elevated to the
starting role prior to last week's
game against San Jose State. The
Cardinal coaching staff was im
pressed with Ellis, a highly recruit
ed prep star out of Oakland's Sky
line High School, who played ag
gressively last season and during
the first two games of 1993.

Stewart, a junior, leads the Col
orado offense into Stanford Stadi
um. He has directed the Buffaloes
to 1,065 yards of total offense in
their first two games. Originally
recruited as a top option quarter
back, Stewart has shown in the
past two games that he can throw
the ball with touch as well. Senior
defensive end Tyrone Parker, the
mainstay of the Cardinal defensive
line for the past two seasons, will
try to keep the pressure on Stewart
tonight. Last season, Parker
recorded three quarterback sacks
and nine tackles for a loss.

Senior Steve Stenstrom is in his
second full season as the Cardinal
signal-caller. Last week he set ca
reer-highs in completions and
touchdowns with a 30-for-39, 330-
yard, four-touchdown effort. Sten
strom is 18-5 as a starter and his
.782 winning percentage is second
all-time for Stanford. Woolfork, a
fifth-year senior, is a top candidate
for All-America honors as well as
the Dick Butkus Award, given to
the top linebacker in the nation.
Last season, he led the Big Eight
with 13 and 1/2 sacks and had 21
tackles for losses.

Junior tight end Justin Ar
mour, Stenstrom's favorite target,
caught a career-high nine passes
for 103 yards and a touchdown in
last week's victory over San Jose
State. A year ago, he led the Cardi
nal with a 17.4-yard average per
reception and seven touchdown
catches. Davis, a fifth-year senior
free safety, has been a three-year
starter in the Buffaloes' defensive
backfield. He was an honorable
mention All-Big Eight selection
last season at strong safety with 30
solo tackles and one interception.

This will mark the first game
matching up Stanford Coach Bill
Walsh against Colorado Coach Bill
McCartney. McCartney owns a 76-
51-4 record and is in his 12th sea
son at the reins of the Colorado
football program, a tenure which
includes a national championship
in 1990. In 1992, in his first year
back at the helm of the Cardinal
football program, Walsh led Stan
ford to a 10-3 record and its first
share of the Pac-10 championship
since 1971. Walsh's daughter at
tends the University of Colorado.
