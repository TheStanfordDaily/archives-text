Salomon Brothers
Quantitative Research Analyst
Salomon Brothers is an international investment banking firm that makes
markets in securities and provides a broad range of underwriting, financial
advisory and research services to governments, corporations, and
institutional investors.
The BOND PORTFOLIO and EQUITY PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS CROUPS work with Sales,
Trading and Investment Banking to help Salomon Brothers' clients quantify and implement investment,
capital raising, hedging, and asset allocation strategies. This work includes the development of new
theoretical models for securities valuation, statistical analysis of data, and the development of
customized client presentations.
Quantitative Analysts often act as generalists for up to two years, after which they specialize in one or
more of the following areas:
• Modeling financial products such as mortgage-backed securities and options
• Portfolio structuring and/or asset allocation
• Analysis integrated with Sales, Trading, or Investment Banking activities
• Analysis of stock and bond market returns and yields
• Analytical systems development.
Qualified candidates will have a 8.5., M.S., or Ph.D. in a quantitative field such as Computer Science,
Engineering, Finance, Mathematics, Operations Research, or Statistics. Good analytical and computer
skills (C/Unix preferable) are required. Because so much of the analyst's work involves direct
interaction with the Finn's clients, strong interpersonal, writing and speaking skills are also important.
While a background in finance or economics is helpful, we believe that an analyst with exceptionally
strong quantitative skills can come to a deep understanding of the financial markets.
