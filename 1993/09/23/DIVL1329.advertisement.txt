A comprehensive overview of the primary sources of energy: oil,
natural gas, coal, nuclear and hydroelectric, and emerging sources
such as wind, solar, geothermal, and energy efficiency. The course
will provide an understanding of the distribution of each resource
and how each is recovered and converted to useful forms of energy
Environmental, technical, regulatory and economic considerations of
each resource will be discussed.
There will be five field trips offered and each student must attend
two:
■ MobilS San Ardo Oil Field
■ SMUDS Rancho Seco Nuclear and PV Plants
■ Unocal* Geothermal Operation at The Geysers
■ San Luis Reservoir Hydropowerplant and
Altamont Pass Windfarm
■ PG&ES Pacific Energy Center (energy efficiency) /g?
