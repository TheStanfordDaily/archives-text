Consider a Linguistics Course this Fall!
Linguistics tries to understand the miracle of language. Why can a child of four,
who can't even add six and eight, still perform extraordinarily complex opera
tions in speech that the most sophisticated computers can't? Why is it that all
human languages have certain structural properties in common? What role does
language play in differentiating people by social class, ethnicity, and sex? What
are the systematic differences between dialects and other varieties of a language?
Here are some reasons why students find linguistics exciting:
• Students in introductory courses can be trained to do original research
• The data for linguistic investigation is all around you in daily life: in cafeterias
and restaurants, on TV, in party conversations, etc.
• Linguistics courses are intellectually stimulating and FUN
