Attention Engineering
Students! â€” 1993-'94
Picture/Information Booklet
We will be putting together a picture/infor
mation booklet on all of the lE/EM/MSE
students (new and returning). This not only
helps you get to know each other, but is an
invaluable tool for the faculty and staff. We
will have a photographer in Terman 340 on
Thursday, September 30, 1993, from
12:30-4:30. This is mandatory. If you don't
show, we will be tracking you down.
Returning students: if you had your picture
taken by the photographer last year, and it
was included in last year's book, we do not
need another picture of you. If your picture
was not included in last year's book, please be
sure to have it taken on September 30, 1993.
We want to include you this year!
Don't be the only one on the page without
a picture!
