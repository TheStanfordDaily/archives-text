IS THERE AN
■BBfflpyl ABSOLUTE TRUTH
■— FOR ALL MANKIND?
Many of us ore looking for firmer convictions we can
stand on. How do we find them?
In all ages there have been those who have held high
ideals - incorruptible integrity, moral courage, unselfish action,
individuals gleoned some insight into a Truth which
I motivated and strengthened them.
Today there is a religion which penetrates the instability
i of human life. It reveals the provable laws of Cod's goodness
and provides a solid basis for faith.
