STAN
Stanford Student Alumni Network
STAN invites you to take part in the hottest events on campus!
Are you interested in:
• becoming a true Stanford man or woman at Full Moon on the Quad?
• returning to high school to talk about Stanford and college life?
• meeting and networking with some incredible alums?
STAN does all this and more through its student-alumni, class identity,
and undergraduate admissions programs
And those stylin' Stanford keychains are compliments of STAN, too.
To learn more about STAN and how to plan events such as these for students and
alumni, come to our Ist meeting at
J3T Bowman Alumni House (behind Tresidder)
