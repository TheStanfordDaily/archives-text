The new Federal Work-Study
Funds for Community Service
program will allow students
who qualify to be paid for
working in non-profit
community agencies.
Approximately 80-85 Stanford
students will receive funding
from this program.
Participants may be involved
in direct service, planning, or
community-sponsored
research activities.
Funding will be allocated
on a first-come,
first-serve basis.

Service Clearinghouse.
