## Yeltsin battles parliament for political power 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - President
Boris Yeltsin's bid to control Russia
gained strength yesterday, buoyed
by support from the army and
cheering crowds.
His hard-line opposition sat bar
ricaded in parliament, struggling to
respond.
Bonfires burned for a second
night outside the Russian parlia
ment building, where as many as
5,000 anti-Yeltsin demonstrators
ringed the building to protest his
suspension of parliament Tuesday.
Protesters waved red Soviet flags
and stockpiled rocks, pipes and
Molotov cocktails.
But despite appeals by Yeltsin's
opponents for a nationwide strike,
there were no reports of protests
elsewhere.
Yeltsin told the crowd he would
avoid bloodshed. "We would not like

and do not intend to use any force,"
he said. "We want everything to go
peacefully, without blood."
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev
said the military "unequivocally
supports the president as comman
der-in-chief." In an apparent show
of force, the army held troop exer
cises in several cities.
A public opinion poll taken yes
terday in Moscow showed that 51
percent of 880 respondents support
ed Yeltsin and 25 percent opposed
him, although nearly a quarter of
those polled either had not heard
about Yeltsin's decree or had no
opinion.
Yeltsin has been locked in an 18-
month power struggle with lawmak
ers who want to slow the country's
transition to free markets, prop up
state industries and pursue a more
nationalistic foreign policy.

Support for Yeltsin poured in
from world leaders, including Presi
dent Clinton, and from neighboring
republics of the former Soviet
Union.
Led by speaker Ruslan Khasbula
tov, about 150 members of the
Supreme Soviet, the country's
standing legislature, declared
Yeltsin's action unconstitutional
and moved to impeach him.
They named Vice President
Alexander Rutskoi acting president
and voted to replace the heads of the
military, police and security police.
They also unanimously adopted
amendments to Russia's criminal
code to add a new article imposing
capital punishment for the "violent
alteration of the constitutional sys
tem."
Legislators were trying to bring
Yeltsin's ouster to a vote before the

full parliament, the Congress of
People's Deputies. Legislator Ivan
Shashviashvili said 600 of the 1,041
members of the congress had signed
up for a session set for today; 689
are needed for a quorum.
The lawmakers urged Prime Minis
ter Viktor Chernomyrdin to join them.
But in an emotional speech to regional
leaders yesterday, Chernomyrdin
called his support for Yeltsin
"unequivocal" and said new elections
are necessary to bring stability to Rus
sia. He urged calm until then.
Constitutional Court chief Valery
Zorkin, who ruled that Yeltsin's dis
solution of parliament was uncon
stitutional and grounds for
impeachment, called for a mediator
and urged the president and parlia
ment to agree to simultaneous elec
tions. Yeltsin has previously reject
ed such a plan.
