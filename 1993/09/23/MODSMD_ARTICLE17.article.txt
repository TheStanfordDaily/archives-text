Elected last spring as presi
dent of the Faculty Senate,
Jones will be important in
presenting faculty viewpoints
to Casper's administration.
Jones said she expects that
this year will include a lot of
routine senate business, but
she hopes the senate will play
an instrumental role in
endorsing and forming Uni
versity policies such as the
sexual harassment policy.
Although the senate's votes
do not directly change Univer
sity policies, its endorsement
is crucial to their success.
Jones, an award-winning
biology professor, said other
important issues facing the
senate will be the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement's report on the
grading system, interdepart
mental programs and a conflict
of interest policy regarding
research.
