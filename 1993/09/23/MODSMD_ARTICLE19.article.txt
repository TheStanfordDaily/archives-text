The often-rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institu
tion and Stanford has
improved since Raisian took
over as Hoover director in
1988, replacing W. Glenn
Campbell, the institution's
head for 30 years.
The Hoover-Stanford rela
tionship hit a low point during
the mid-1980s when faculty
successfully stopped the Rea
gan Presidential Library from
locating on campus and sup
ported a movement to bring
the institution under "normal
academic governance."
Raisian has worked diligent
ly to improve relations since
then, and it seems to have been
successful. Three years ago, he
was appointed to the Universi
ty Cabinet — Stanford's high
est policy-making body which
includes the president, the
seven deans, the provost, the
director of SLAC and Raisian.
