# Undergraduate education team to begin study
## High expectations for year-long effort 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
After a first year filled with
tantalizing hints and informal
proposals, University President
Gerhard Casper this fall embarks
on the business of defining his
legacy at Stanford.
Much of that legacy may well
hinge upon the work of the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, which Casper created last
spring to conduct a comprehen
sive, year-long study, the first
such undertaking at Stanford
since 1968.
Expectations will be high for
the 19-member commission when
it meets for the first time next
month. When Casper announced
the commission's formation in his
State of the University address

last April, he said a study of un
dergraduate education is neces
sary "in light ... of the emerging
opportunities and challenges of
the 21st century."
Early indications from Casper
and commission chair James
Sheehan suggest that no area of
Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram will be exempt from scruti
ny. That means anything — from
the number and nature of distrib
ution requirements, to the length
of the bachelor's degree, to funda
mental assumptions about what
constitutes quality in teaching
and learning — will be fair game
for reconsideration.
"If it is done correctly, [the
study) should be very influential,"
Casper said in a recent interview.
