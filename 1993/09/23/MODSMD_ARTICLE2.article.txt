# Undergraduate education team to begin study
## High expectations for year-long effort 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
After a first year filled with
tantalizing hints and informal
proposals, University President
Gerhard Casper this fall embarks
on the business of defining his
legacy at Stanford.
Much of that legacy may well
hinge upon the work of the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, which Casper created last
spring to conduct a comprehen
sive, year-long study, the first
such undertaking at Stanford
since 1968.
Expectations will be high for
the 19-member commission when
it meets for the first time next
month. When Casper announced
the commission's formation in his
State of the University address

last April, he said a study of un
dergraduate education is neces
sary "in light ... of the emerging
opportunities and challenges of
the 21st century."
Early indications from Casper
and commission chair James
Sheehan suggest that no area of
Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram will be exempt from scruti
ny. That means anything — from
the number and nature of distrib
ution requirements, to the length
of the bachelor's degree, to funda
mental assumptions about what
constitutes quality in teaching
and learning — will be fair game
for reconsideration.
"If it is done correctly, [the
study) should be very influential,"
Casper said in a recent interview.
"If the commission takes its
charge seriously, it will have a
profound impact on higher educa
tion."
Though the work of the com
mission thus far has been skeletal
and its final conclusions will not
be released until next October,
the notoriety it has received
already is striking. In June,
Casper appointed Sheehan, a
prominent scholar in German his
tory, to head the commission and
sent a letter to Stanford alumni
asking for their opinions on the
proposed study. The response,
Casper said, "has been over
whelming — I literally got hun
dreds of letters."
Add to the mix national media
attention and a $400,000 grant
from the Irvine Foundation ear
marked for the new commission,
and the result is a remarkable bal
lyhoo for a study that is still yet to
commence. Administration offi
cials said no work will be done
until the two student members of
the commission are chosen in
October.
Defining a philosophy
Support for the president's
proposal was nearly unanimous
when it was announced in April.
Characteristic is the view of Jean
Fetter, special assistant to the
president: "Any system worth its
salt merits periodic review," she
said.
But it is still unclear where,

under the wide rubric of under
graduate education, the commis
sion's energies will be thrust.
"The president's mandate is very
broad," Sheehan said. "Our first
task is to convert that into some
manageable set of particular
issues that we can focus on."
Casper himself has publicly
offered suggestions for the com
mission in an effort to, as he said
in his State of the University
speech, "begin the debate." He has
called into question Stanford's
system of distribution require
ments, the role of the mtyor, and
the depth of the University's com
mitment to both analytical think
ing and the study of foreign cul
tures and American history.
Sheehan agrees that the presi
dent's sweeping ambitions are
worth aspiring to. "My feeling is
that we shouldn't take anything
off the table," he said. "I don't
think we can deal with every last
item, but we should take as broad
a view as we possibly can."
Sheehan said the commission
will initiate its work by examining
the "philosophical assumptions"
upon which Stanford's under
graduate curriculum rests. "We
will begin with 'philosophy* —
defining our basic purposes and
goals," he said.
Commission member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences, said
that when the commission meets,
"one of its starting points should
be a determination of what we do
exceptionally well, what we do
moderately well, and being criti
cal, to say what we don't do well. I
hope we operate from the basis of
determining our strengths and

weaknesses."
Potential problems
The commission may run into
conflict, however, when it turns
its attention from abstract goals
to concrete curricular issues,
where personal and political
interests enter the fray.
"Inevitably, there will be some
disagreement," Fetter said. "One
only has to look at the CIV debate
to see how complex it can
become."
In 1988, the Faculty Senate
approved the changing of the
Area One distribution require
ment from the old Western Civi
lization course to a more "multi
cultural" offering titled Cultures,
Ideas and Values. The senate's
decision became the subject of
numerous accusations that the
University and then-President
Donald Kennedy had bowed to
political exigencies.
In his first year, Casper experi
enced the kind of sharp criticism
that can result from the slightest
policy proposals, ranging from let
ters opposing the concept of a
three-year undergraduate pro
gram, to an flier posted last May
that questioned his commitment
to multiculturalism.
Even in the wake of his State of
the University musings on the
new commission, Casper came
under mild attack from professors
who felt he was already subordi
nating larger issues of education
al quality to curricular reform.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, in response to
Casper's address, said that the
president's "main thrust was at
the policy level .... In my opin

ion, you don't necessarily need to
alter the curriculum in order to
improve education."
"Political issues are political
issues," Casper said at the sugges
tion that the study could be ham
pered by special interests. "But
what a good education consists of
is not a political question."
Partly to account for the
countless and often delicate issues
that accompany curricular
reform, Sheehan said the commis
sion will actively seek student
opinion, even beyond the two stu-

dents who will sit
on the panel.
"The most
important thing
about this is that
it be open in
every sense," he
said. "We want
to encourage as
many people as
possible to think

and talk to us about what they're
doing. The commission's success
not only depends on how hard we
work, but how successful we are
in engaging large numbers of peo
ple outside ourselves."
Seizing the moment
Casper's decision to authorize a
study on undergraduate education
was the product of his own, char
acteristically prudent ruminations
on the subject working in tandem
with unforeseen events in his first
year as president. "[The an
nouncement) was the result of a
number of factors coming togeth
er that I didn't expect to come
together," he said.
While still a law professor at
the University of Chicago, Casper

said, he had decided that the pur
pose and structure of undergradu
ate education "needed to be looked
at fresh." When he became
provost at Chicago in 1989, he
became further alarmed by the
increasing financial pressures on
college students.
"When I accepted the Stanford
presidency, I clearly said to myself
that I would like to engage the
community in an abstract discus
sion about the purposes of col
lege," he said. "But since I had
my hands full in my first year,
Til 1_ x T

I thought 1
wouldn't begin
testing the waters
until my second
year."
Were it not for
a casual sugges
tion at a meeting
with the editorial
board of the San
Francisco Chron-

icle in February, he might have
succeeded in keeping his inten
tions under wraps. But at that
now-fabled, off-the-record discus
sion, Casper opined that "every
thing about a college education
should be reconsidered, and that
nothing should be taken for grant
ed, including whether or not it
should take four years to com
plete."
The Chronicle promptly
reported Casper's remark on its
front page, and soon enough, the
president contends, newspapers
across the country were trumpet
ing his support for a three-year
degree.
In fact, Casper maintains that
he only said "four years is not a
sacred cow," not that Stanford

would shorten its undergraduate
program to three years.
Still, Casper said he "came to
the conclusion that, rather than
wait, I should seize the moment...
By April, I was more or less ready
to make a move." On April 29, in
his speech before the Academic
Council, Casper announced the
commission's formation and set a
May 1994 deadline for its final
report.
However, due to delays in
staffing the commission, it is like
ly that only a draft report will be
ready by May. The commission's
final conclusions are targeted for
release next October.
Gauging the impact
Although the new panel's task
will be arduous, their eventual
proposals may not have a lasting
impact.
"Universities are difficult to
change — they tend to be deeply
conservative places," Sheehan
said. "I wouldn't count on Stan
ford looking radically different
from what it is today in two
years."
Still, Sheehan shares Casper's
belief that the time is ripe in high
er education for a survey such as
this to effect ground-breaking
change both at Stanford and on a
national level.
"We have to go into this believ
ing that our first task is to figure
out what's best for Stanford. We
can't go into this with the idea
that we're going to re-shape high
er education," he said.
"Our goals are domestic in a
way. But I suppose if we do this
right, we might have an impact
beyond Palm Drive."

October.
Defining a philosophy
Support for the president's
proposal was nearly unanimous
when it was announced in April.
Characteristic is the view of Jean
Fetter, special assistant to the
president: "Any system worth its
salt merits periodic review," she
said.
But it is still unclear where,

under the wide rubric of under
graduate education, the commis
sion's energies will be thrust.
"The president's mandate is very
broad," Sheehan said. "Our first
task is to convert that into some
manageable set of particular
issues that we can focus on."
Casper himself has publicly
offered suggestions for the com
mission in an effort to, as he said
in his State of the University
speech, "begin the debate." He has
called into question Stanford's
system of distribution require
ments, the role of the mtyor, and
the depth of the University's com
mitment to both analytical think
ing and the study of foreign cul
tures and American history.
Sheehan agrees that the presi
dent's sweeping ambitions are
worth aspiring to. "My feeling is
that we shouldn't take anything
off the table," he said. "I don't
think we can deal with every last
item, but we should take as broad
a view as we possibly can."
Sheehan said the commission
will initiate its work by examining
the "philosophical assumptions"
upon which Stanford's under
graduate curriculum rests. "We
will begin with 'philosophy* —
defining our basic purposes and
goals," he said.
Commission member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences, said
that when the commission meets,
"one of its starting points should
be a determination of what we do
exceptionally well, what we do
moderately well, and being criti
cal, to say what we don't do well. I
hope we operate from the basis of
determining our strengths and

weaknesses."
Potential problems
The commission may run into
conflict, however, when it turns
its attention from abstract goals
to concrete curricular issues,
where personal and political
interests enter the fray.
"Inevitably, there will be some
disagreement," Fetter said. "One
only has to look at the CIV debate
to see how complex it can
become."
In 1988, the Faculty Senate
approved the changing of the
Area One distribution require
ment from the old Western Civi
lization course to a more "multi
cultural" offering titled Cultures,
Ideas and Values. The senate's
decision became the subject of
numerous accusations that the
University and then-President
Donald Kennedy had bowed to
political exigencies.
In his first year, Casper experi
enced the kind of sharp criticism
that can result from the slightest
policy proposals, ranging from let
ters opposing the concept of a
three-year undergraduate pro
gram, to an flier posted last May
that questioned his commitment
to multiculturalism.
Even in the wake of his State of
the University musings on the
new commission, Casper came
under mild attack from professors
who felt he was already subordi
nating larger issues of education
al quality to curricular reform.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, in response to
Casper's address, said that the
president's "main thrust was at
the policy level .... In my opin

ion, you don't necessarily need to
alter the curriculum in order to
improve education."
"Political issues are political
issues," Casper said at the sugges
tion that the study could be ham
pered by special interests. "But
what a good education consists of
is not a political question."
Partly to account for the
countless and often delicate issues
that accompany curricular
reform, Sheehan said the commis
sion will actively seek student
opinion, even beyond the two stu-

dents who will sit
on the panel.
"The most
important thing
about this is that
it be open in
every sense," he
said. "We want
to encourage as
many people as
possible to think

and talk to us about what they're
doing. The commission's success
not only depends on how hard we
work, but how successful we are
in engaging large numbers of peo
ple outside ourselves."
Seizing the moment
Casper's decision to authorize a
study on undergraduate education
was the product of his own, char
acteristically prudent ruminations
on the subject working in tandem
with unforeseen events in his first
year as president. "[The an
nouncement) was the result of a
number of factors coming togeth
er that I didn't expect to come
together," he said.
While still a law professor at
the University of Chicago, Casper

said, he had decided that the pur
pose and structure of undergradu
ate education "needed to be looked
at fresh." When he became
provost at Chicago in 1989, he
became further alarmed by the
increasing financial pressures on
college students.
"When I accepted the Stanford
presidency, I clearly said to myself
that I would like to engage the
community in an abstract discus
sion about the purposes of col
lege," he said. "But since I had
my hands full in my first year,
Til 1_ x T

I thought 1
wouldn't begin
testing the waters
until my second
year."
Were it not for
a casual sugges
tion at a meeting
with the editorial
board of the San
Francisco Chron-

icle in February, he might have
succeeded in keeping his inten
tions under wraps. But at that
now-fabled, off-the-record discus
sion, Casper opined that "every
thing about a college education
should be reconsidered, and that
nothing should be taken for grant
ed, including whether or not it
should take four years to com
plete."
The Chronicle promptly
reported Casper's remark on its
front page, and soon enough, the
president contends, newspapers
across the country were trumpet
ing his support for a three-year
degree.
In fact, Casper maintains that
he only said "four years is not a
sacred cow," not that Stanford

would shorten its undergraduate
program to three years.
Still, Casper said he "came to
the conclusion that, rather than
wait, I should seize the moment...
By April, I was more or less ready
to make a move." On April 29, in
his speech before the Academic
Council, Casper announced the
commission's formation and set a
May 1994 deadline for its final
report.
However, due to delays in
staffing the commission, it is like
ly that only a draft report will be
ready by May. The commission's
final conclusions are targeted for
release next October.
Gauging the impact
Although the new panel's task
will be arduous, their eventual
proposals may not have a lasting
impact.
"Universities are difficult to
change — they tend to be deeply
conservative places," Sheehan
said. "I wouldn't count on Stan
ford looking radically different
from what it is today in two
years."
Still, Sheehan shares Casper's
belief that the time is ripe in high
er education for a survey such as
this to effect ground-breaking
change both at Stanford and on a
national level.
"We have to go into this believ
ing that our first task is to figure
out what's best for Stanford. We
can't go into this with the idea
that we're going to re-shape high
er education," he said.
"Our goals are domestic in a
way. But I suppose if we do this
right, we might have an impact
beyond Palm Drive."


Casper


Sheehan
After a first year filled with
tantalizing hints and informal
proposals, University President
Gerhard Casper this fall embarks
on the business of defining his
legacy at Stanford.
Much of that legacy may well
hinge upon the work of the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, which Casper created last
spring to conduct a comprehen
sive, year-long study, the first
such undertaking at Stanford
since 1968.
Expectations will be high for
the 19-member commission when
it meets for the first time next
month. When Casper announced
the commission's formation in his
State of the University address

last April, he said a study of un
dergraduate education is neces
sary "in light ... of the emerging
opportunities and challenges of
the 21st century."
Early indications from Casper
and commission chair James
Sheehan suggest that no area of
Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram will be exempt from scruti
ny. That means anything — from
the number and nature of distrib
ution requirements, to the length
of the bachelor's degree, to funda
mental assumptions about what
constitutes quality in teaching
and learning — will be fair game
for reconsideration.
"If it is done correctly, [the
study) should be very influential,"
Casper said in a recent interview.
"If the commission takes its
charge seriously, it will have a
profound impact on higher educa
tion."
Though the work of the com
mission thus far has been skeletal
and its final conclusions will not
be released until next October,
the notoriety it has received
already is striking. In June,
Casper appointed Sheehan, a
prominent scholar in German his
tory, to head the commission and
sent a letter to Stanford alumni
asking for their opinions on the
proposed study. The response,
Casper said, "has been over
whelming — I literally got hun
dreds of letters."
Add to the mix national media
attention and a $400,000 grant
from the Irvine Foundation ear
marked for the new commission,
and the result is a remarkable bal
lyhoo for a study that is still yet to
commence. Administration offi
cials said no work will be done
until the two student members of
the commission are chosen in
October.

In 1988, the Faculty Senate
approved the changing of the
Area One distribution require
ment from the old Western Civi
lization course to a more "multi
cultural" offering titled Cultures,
Ideas and Values. The senate's
decision became the subject of
numerous accusations that the
University and then-President
Donald Kennedy had bowed to
political exigencies.
In his first year, Casper experi
enced the kind of sharp criticism
that can result from the slightest
policy proposals, ranging from let
ters opposing the concept of a
three-year undergraduate pro
gram, to an flier posted last May
that questioned his commitment
to multiculturalism.
Even in the wake of his State of
the University musings on the
new commission, Casper came
under mild attack from professors
who felt he was already subordi
nating larger issues of education
al quality to curricular reform.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, in response to
Casper's address, said that the
president's "main thrust was at
the policy level .... In my opin

ion, you don't necessarily need to
alter the curriculum in order to
improve education."
"Political issues are political
issues," Casper said at the sugges
tion that the study could be ham
pered by special interests. "But
what a good education consists of
is not a political question."
Partly to account for the
countless and often delicate issues
that accompany curricular
reform, Sheehan said the commis
sion will actively seek student
opinion, even beyond the two stu-

dents who will sit
on the panel.
"The most
important thing
about this is that
it be open in
every sense," he
said. "We want
to encourage as
many people as
possible to think

and talk to us about what they're
doing. The commission's success
not only depends on how hard we
work, but how successful we are
in engaging large numbers of peo
ple outside ourselves."
Seizing the moment
Casper's decision to authorize a
study on undergraduate education
was the product of his own, char
acteristically prudent ruminations
on the subject working in tandem
with unforeseen events in his first
year as president. "[The an
nouncement) was the result of a
number of factors coming togeth
er that I didn't expect to come
together," he said.
While still a law professor at
the University of Chicago, Casper

said, he had decided that the pur
pose and structure of undergradu
ate education "needed to be looked
at fresh." When he became
provost at Chicago in 1989, he
became further alarmed by the
increasing financial pressures on
college students.
"When I accepted the Stanford
presidency, I clearly said to myself
that I would like to engage the
community in an abstract discus
sion about the purposes of col
lege," he said. "But since I had
my hands full in my first year,
Til 1_ x T

I thought 1
wouldn't begin
testing the waters
until my second
year."
Were it not for
a casual sugges
tion at a meeting
with the editorial
board of the San
Francisco Chron-

icle in February, he might have
succeeded in keeping his inten
tions under wraps. But at that
now-fabled, off-the-record discus
sion, Casper opined that "every
thing about a college education
should be reconsidered, and that
nothing should be taken for grant
ed, including whether or not it
should take four years to com
plete."
The Chronicle promptly
reported Casper's remark on its
front page, and soon enough, the
president contends, newspapers
across the country were trumpet
ing his support for a three-year
degree.
In fact, Casper maintains that
he only said "four years is not a
sacred cow," not that Stanford

would shorten its undergraduate
program to three years.
Still, Casper said he "came to
the conclusion that, rather than
wait, I should seize the moment...
By April, I was more or less ready
to make a move." On April 29, in
his speech before the Academic
Council, Casper announced the
commission's formation and set a
May 1994 deadline for its final
report.
However, due to delays in
staffing the commission, it is like
ly that only a draft report will be
ready by May. The commission's
final conclusions are targeted for
release next October.
Gauging the impact
Although the new panel's task
will be arduous, their eventual
proposals may not have a lasting
impact.
"Universities are difficult to
change — they tend to be deeply
conservative places," Sheehan
said. "I wouldn't count on Stan
ford looking radically different
from what it is today in two
years."
Still, Sheehan shares Casper's
belief that the time is ripe in high
er education for a survey such as
this to effect ground-breaking
change both at Stanford and on a
national level.
"We have to go into this believ
ing that our first task is to figure
out what's best for Stanford. We
can't go into this with the idea
that we're going to re-shape high
er education," he said.
"Our goals are domestic in a
way. But I suppose if we do this
right, we might have an impact
beyond Palm Drive."
