# Presidents promise change after regaining seats
## Officers will encourage more student involvement in issues 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Stanford's student government is not known for
its accomplishments but f:r its elected offi
cials, such as Bart Simpson and a slate which
promised to do nothing while in office.
But this year, they're insisting it will be different.
The ASSU Council of Presidents and Senate chair
Greg Waldorf plan to renew their commitment to
students and make a concerted effort to spark more
involvement in student issues.
"Students should go out and grab a senator and
ask them what the ASSU is doing," Waldorf said. "If
we're not providing value for the average student,
we might as well refund their money."
The COP — the four-person executive branch of
the ASSU — directs most of the ASSU activities and
acts as a link between students and administration.
In addition, 20 undergraduate and 20 graduate stu
dents serve as senators in the government's legisla
tive body.
Attitudes towards student government have
been largely negative in the past few years. In 1990,
Dart Simpson was elected to the senate, and last
year so few graduate students ran for senate seats
that some write-in candidates won with only three
votes.
In 1992, students elected to the ASSU's highest
office the"I Prefer Not to Have a COP" slate, who
promptly kept their promise to do nothing if elected.
Prefer's inactivity forced the senate to operate the
ASSU alone last year.
Despite the absence of a COP, the ASSU still had
several successful projects last year, including a
$100,000 project which vastly improved the Memo
rial Auditorium sound system.
The ASSU's speaker's bureau also brought
speakers such as Kurt Vonnegut and Ice-T to cam
pus.
Last spring, though, students chose to restore the
office of COP and elected "A Clean Slate." Slate
members promised that student government would
take a more active role in the University this year. In

addition, Clean Slate members have turned down
the $5000 salaries traditionally allotted to COP
members.
COP members Delia L6pez, Ron Brown, Ying-
Ying Goh and Jason Snyder plan to become more
involved in student issues — something many stu
dents say the ASSU has not done effectively for the
past several years.
"As COP, we will walk dorms. ... We'll talk to
people and find out what their concerns are," Ldpez
said.
"Our big goal is communication — having stu
dents know what's going on at the ASSU." She
added that the COP cabinet, senate associates and,
possibly, COP interns will work to inform students
of the ASSU's activities.

Whatever way the ASSU leadership intends to
interact with the student body, the goal remains the
same — making an impact.
"I can't provide all of the senate's legislation for
the year," Waldorf said. "But if we don't have some
thing substantive by the end of fall quarter, there'll
be hell to pay."
"I can't force the senate to improve the student
government's effectiveness," he said. "But hopefully
we can sponsor projects with broad appeal."
With widespread student apathy and deep-rooted
problems within the ASSU, this year may be crucial
in determining the future of student government at
the University.
"We just hope students will get involved," said
Lopez. "That's all we can ask."
