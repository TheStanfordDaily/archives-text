# Campus builds up

Bulldozers and jackhammers
aren't pictured in Stanford's
viewbook, but the amount of con
struction on campus makes them
as common as bicycles and
Birkenstocks.
Here's an update on campus
construction:
Green Earth Sciences
Building: Delayed by excessive
rain earlier in the year, the build
ing was completed in August, sev
eral months later than originally
scheduled.
It was planned as a high-tech
research facility to keep Stanford
up to date with other schools and to
provide additional teaching space
after the Loma Prieta earthquake
left a shortage of undamaged office
and classroom space. The $23 mil
lion building was funded by private
grants and donations.
Arrillaga Family Sports
Center: This three-story, 107,00
square-foot athletic complex is
scheduled to be completed by the
fall of 1994.
The sports center, located
between Maples Pavilion and the
varsity tennis courts, will house
administrative offices, a full bas
ketball court, a heritage room for
trophy display, a dining room, a
kitchen, locker rooms, a sports
information center and space for
martial arts, wrestling and foot
ball.
The $16.6 million project is
being funded mainly by donations
and gifts.
Economics Building: Origi
nally scheduled to be completed

this fall, the economics building
was delayed by plans to add
another 2,450 square feet to it,
and is now expected to be occu
pied this spring.
The 50,450 square-foot build
ing, situated in the Memorial
Auditorium parking lot, will be
renamed once the identity of an
anonymous donor is revealed. It
will house the Economics Depart
ment, the Center for Economic
Policy Research, classrooms and a
small conference center. The
building's total cost is $11.5 mil
lion.
Thornton Center for Engi
neering Management: This
building's construction, which
prompted the demolition of Ter
man Pond, will be completed by
the beginning of the 1994-95 aca
demic year.
The facility, a 10,762-square
foot annex to the Terman Engi
neering Center, will house several
new laboratories and two 70-seat
case-study classrooms.
The approximately $3 million
project is being funded by private
gifts. After the completion of the
center, Terman Pond will be
incorporated into Terman's oak
grove.
Gates Computer Sciences:
With a $6 million donation from
Microsoft CEO and founder Bill
Gates, the Computer Science
Department will finally have its
own home. The building will be
located at the intersection of
Serra Street and Campus Drive
West, adjacent to the Gilbert Bio
logical Sciences building. The pro
jected completion date is July
1995.

Planned as a 96,530 square
foot building, its fundraising suc
cess has allowed for other addi
tions including a 48,200 square
foot fully outfitted basement.
Wilbur Hall: One of Stan
ford's most infamously dreaded
dorms recently underwent an
$8.1 million renovation.
The facelift included new car
peting, furniture, paint, lighting,
restrooms, showers, landscaping
and food-service facilities.
The renovations greatly
increased Wilbur's popularity
among students, allowing it to
fare much better in last spring's

undergraduate housing lottery.
Wilbur was traditionally one of
the last dorms chosen.
Earthquake Repairs: The
effects of the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake are still visible across
campus as several buildings still
remain closed due to insufficient
funds.
Green Library West: One of the
hardest hit buildings, the West
Wing of Green Library needs
$34.5 million to reopen. The pro
jected completion date is June
1996.
Language Corner: Repairs in
this corner of the Quad are

expected to be finished in May
1994. These renovations will cost
$11.55 million. The telecommuni
cations system will also be
upgraded, and an elevator will be
installed to comply with the
recent Americans with Disabili
ties Act.
Geology Corner: Although
there is no projected completion
date yet, plans are in the works to
repair and improve this corner of
the Quad. It will cost about
$10.65 million and will include
repairs and the addition of a new
telecommunications system and
an elevator.
