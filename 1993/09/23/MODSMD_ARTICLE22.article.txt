## Grants make undergrad research dreams a reality Rainforest, coastal pollution inspire summer projects 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
Instead of working for their parents this past sum
mer, various students studied a rainforest in Mexico,
wrote a computer language for kids and helped to
save marine life in British Columbia.
The students both initiated and ran their own pro
jects. And although they had faculty sponsors, they
did not work for scientists — they worked as scien
tists.
They were able to do this under the auspices of the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities office, which
specifically earmarks research funds for undergradu
ates and helps students shape their research ideas
into workable projects.
In science and engineering research, undergrads
often have to take a back seat to graduate and post
doctoral students because the material is too complex.
So one of the best ways for them to conduct solo scien
tific research is through the URO, a strictly under
graduate program with a $332,000 annual budget.
URO grants range from $500 to $2,500, giving
students the chance to spend their summers engaged
in independent research some fulfilling lifelong
goals.
Research can be conducted in almost any field and
can be extended from year to year, possibly culmi
nating in an honors thesis or graduate study.
These are a few students who received URO
grants to conduct their scientific research this sum
mer:
Saving marine life
Shannon Bard received her first URO grant as a
freshman. But that was only to continue a study she
started as a concerned 15-year-old on the beaches of
her home province, British Columbia. Noticing a
steady deterioration of local beaches during high
school, she started her own environmental group —
Project Save Our Shores. Since then, she has
received numerous grants every summer to go back
and continue her research.
Her purpose was two-fold. Bard, a senior and biol
ogy major, wanted to survey beaches and find out if

the disappearance of certain species
was linked at all to a coastal paper
and pulp mill dumping chemicals
into the ocean. She also wanted to
teach others to continue her work.
She focused her research on
determining the diversity of
species living on one beach as well
as the relative abundance of each
species, such as the number of
crabs compared to the number of

periwinkles.
To collect the appropriate information, Bard used
a population study called a quadrant survey. This is
akin to taking a poll that infers a national attitude by
interviewing a representative sample of Americans,
not all Americans. The method produces excellent
results if corrected implemented.
She concluded that species increased exponential

ly the greater the distance from the mill.
Bard also taught community groups, such as ele
mentary school science classes, to survey the beaches
themselves — so her initial research could be carried
on by others in her absence.
She wants to establish a continuing database of
the various species that exist on several beaches
extending in concentric circles from the polluting
mill. This will make possible a comprehensive study
of the beaches' and ocean's pollution levels, which
will enable environmental organizations to more
effectively control polluting coastal mills.
Bard presented her report at the Save Georgia
Strait Alliance conference, where she was also able to
exchange ideas with other experts in the area. "I met
lawyers and found out what other fields were inter
ested in this kind of research," she said. "I got an idea
of what real scientists do."

Bard even slept on beaches to conduct her
research. She said she wants to "greatly encourage
anyone to do independent research ... It opens a lot
of doors."
Forest conservation
Bathing in a snake-infested river and sleeping on
a burlap sack couldn't deter senior Sergio Knaebel
from researching forest conservation at a biological
preserve in Chiapas, Mexico.
His mission was to find out why El Triunfo, an
exotic high-altitude rainforest containing some of
Mexico's rarest plant and animal species, was still
thriving, and why it had not been consumed by
neighboring peoples.
He conducted his research in an impoverished vil
lage located near the forest, where he interviewed the
local coffee farmers and village residents about their

relationship with the forest.
Before arriving in Mexico, Knaebel had hypothe
sized that the people may have been economically
dependent on the forest to find food or to keep the
coffee crop healthy. He also thought they might
have felt spiritually connected to the forest, or that
they held the more Western view that the forest
should be conserved for aesthetic and environmen
tal purposes.
But his experiences betrayed him. His initial ideas
were disproved gradually and replaced with the real
ization that these people had "protected" the forest
through neglect, not purpose.
He learned through his interviews that the people
had no concrete reason for not touching the forest.
These were people, he found, who had no concept
of maps, and therefore no idea of the global implica
tions of conserving forest. They were actually
"resource users, not resource managers," Knaebel
said. They were more concerned with living from day
to day, staying healthy, and providing food for every
one in the village, he said.
While conducting his research, Knaebel a human
biology major, learned not only about forest conserva
tion in this important Mexican reserve, but also about
the people. He even picked coffee alongside the farm
ers, and was moved by "how [these] people could be so
warm and friendly when they had so little."
When he left, he said, he gave most of his posses
sions and research equipment to the people who had
helped him survive an arduous, but worthwhile sum
mer.
Programming for kids
A 12-year-old keeping baseball stats in a computer
program? Even more intriguing, the 12-year-old
writes the program that stores the statistics.
This summer, senior Justin Kish, a Science, Tech
nology and Society major, worked on creating a pro
gram that lets 12-14-year-old kids write their own

programs.
He wrote his program in the lan
guage C++, but the kids will have a
simpler, more user-friendly pro
gram that will employ a graphical
rather than textual facade — much
like the Macintosh operating sys
tem that uses windows and a
mouse, instead of the IBM/DOS for
mat that is purely textual.
Kish first became inspired to
write a programming language for

kids after deciding to write a thesis paper on children
and computers.
By enabling them to write programs, Kish wants
children to start thinking "powerful ideas" at an
early age. "Powerful ideas" are ideas such as decom
position, which teaches kids to organize thoughts
and ideas into an outline form — a boon when it
comes to writing papers or giving speeches.
"The goal is to keep [the computer program] sim
ple, and still make it a creative tool," Kish said. "I
don't want an abstraction. I want the kids to know
they're getting deep inside a computer, not playing a
video game."
Kish's final product, anticipated this December,
will include an animated tutorial, that shows stu
dents in a step-by-step process how to learn comput
er programming.
Just think, programming at age 12.

Mexico's rarest plant and animal species, was still
thriving, and why it had not been consumed by
neighboring peoples.
He conducted his research in an impoverished vil
lage located near the forest, where he interviewed the
local coffee farmers and village residents about their

relationship with the forest.
Before arriving in Mexico, Knaebel had hypothe
sized that the people may have been economically
dependent on the forest to find food or to keep the
coffee crop healthy. He also thought they might
have felt spiritually connected to the forest, or that
they held the more Western view that the forest
should be conserved for aesthetic and environmen
tal purposes.
But his experiences betrayed him. His initial ideas
were disproved gradually and replaced with the real
ization that these people had "protected" the forest
through neglect, not purpose.
He learned through his interviews that the people
had no concrete reason for not touching the forest.
These were people, he found, who had no concept
of maps, and therefore no idea of the global implica
tions of conserving forest. They were actually
"resource users, not resource managers," Knaebel
said. They were more concerned with living from day
to day, staying healthy, and providing food for every
one in the village, he said.
While conducting his research, Knaebel a human
biology major, learned not only about forest conserva
tion in this important Mexican reserve, but also about
the people. He even picked coffee alongside the farm
ers, and was moved by "how [these] people could be so
warm and friendly when they had so little."
When he left, he said, he gave most of his posses
sions and research equipment to the people who had
helped him survive an arduous, but worthwhile sum
mer.
Programming for kids
A 12-year-old keeping baseball stats in a computer
program? Even more intriguing, the 12-year-old
writes the program that stores the statistics.
This summer, senior Justin Kish, a Science, Tech
nology and Society major, worked on creating a pro
gram that lets 12-14-year-old kids write their own

programs.
He wrote his program in the lan
guage C++, but the kids will have a
simpler, more user-friendly pro
gram that will employ a graphical
rather than textual facade — much
like the Macintosh operating sys
tem that uses windows and a
mouse, instead of the IBM/DOS for
mat that is purely textual.
Kish first became inspired to
write a programming language for

kids after deciding to write a thesis paper on children
and computers.
By enabling them to write programs, Kish wants
children to start thinking "powerful ideas" at an
early age. "Powerful ideas" are ideas such as decom
position, which teaches kids to organize thoughts
and ideas into an outline form — a boon when it
comes to writing papers or giving speeches.
"The goal is to keep [the computer program] sim
ple, and still make it a creative tool," Kish said. "I
don't want an abstraction. I want the kids to know
they're getting deep inside a computer, not playing a
video game."
Kish's final product, anticipated this December,
will include an animated tutorial, that shows stu
dents in a step-by-step process how to learn comput
er programming.
Just think, programming at age 12.

Instead of working for their parents this past sum
mer, various students studied a rainforest in Mexico,
wrote a computer language for kids and helped to
save marine life in British Columbia.
The students both initiated and ran their own pro
jects. And although they had faculty sponsors, they
did not work for scientists — they worked as scien
tists.
They were able to do this under the auspices of the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities office, which
specifically earmarks research funds for undergradu
ates and helps students shape their research ideas
into workable projects.
In science and engineering research, undergrads
often have to take a back seat to graduate and post
doctoral students because the material is too complex.
So one of the best ways for them to conduct solo scien
tific research is through the URO, a strictly under
graduate program with a $332,000 annual budget.
URO grants range from $500 to $2,500, giving
students the chance to spend their summers engaged
in independent research some fulfilling lifelong
goals.
Research can be conducted in almost any field and
can be extended from year to year, possibly culmi
nating in an honors thesis or graduate study.
These are a few students who received URO
grants to conduct their scientific research this sum
mer:
Saving marine life
Shannon Bard received her first URO grant as a
freshman. But that was only to continue a study she
started as a concerned 15-year-old on the beaches of
her home province, British Columbia. Noticing a
steady deterioration of local beaches during high
school, she started her own environmental group —
Project Save Our Shores. Since then, she has
received numerous grants every summer to go back
and continue her research.
Her purpose was two-fold. Bard, a senior and biol
ogy major, wanted to survey beaches and find out if

the disappearance of certain species
was linked at all to a coastal paper
and pulp mill dumping chemicals
into the ocean. She also wanted to
teach others to continue her work.
She focused her research on
determining the diversity of
species living on one beach as well
as the relative abundance of each
species, such as the number of
crabs compared to the number of

periwinkles.
To collect the appropriate information, Bard used
a population study called a quadrant survey. This is
akin to taking a poll that infers a national attitude by
interviewing a representative sample of Americans,
not all Americans. The method produces excellent
results if corrected implemented.
She concluded that species increased exponential

ly the greater the distance from the mill.
Bard also taught community groups, such as ele
mentary school science classes, to survey the beaches
themselves — so her initial research could be carried
on by others in her absence.
She wants to establish a continuing database of
the various species that exist on several beaches
extending in concentric circles from the polluting
mill. This will make possible a comprehensive study
of the beaches' and ocean's pollution levels, which
will enable environmental organizations to more
effectively control polluting coastal mills.
Bard presented her report at the Save Georgia
Strait Alliance conference, where she was also able to
exchange ideas with other experts in the area. "I met
lawyers and found out what other fields were inter
ested in this kind of research," she said. "I got an idea
of what real scientists do."

Bard even slept on beaches to conduct her
research. She said she wants to "greatly encourage
anyone to do independent research ... It opens a lot
of doors."
Forest conservation

a burlap sack couldn't deter senior Sergio Knaebel

preserve in Chiapas, Mexico.
