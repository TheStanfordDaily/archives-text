# Computer choices cause undue confusion
## Mac or IBM? To buy or not to buy? How to decide what you need 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
Choosing the "right" computer
can be like deciding between a
Porsche 911 and a Pinto.
If you never drive faster than
45 mph, the speedy Porsche
engine has way too much power.
Similarly, the difference between
buying a Macintosh Classic and a
Quadra depends on what you
need.
To buy a computer, Residen
tial Computer Consultant Adam
Elman recommends the Book
store's Microdisc department, for
good prices on a Macintosh. He
also suggests local businesses
such as Central Stores, located on
campus, or Fry's Electronics,
within biking distance from cam
pus, for alternative choices such
as IBMs or clones.
Most computer sellers usually
have several models on the floor
for hands-on demonstrations.
In order of importance, here
are some of the most-asked ques

tions by computer buyers at Stan
ford, according to Elman, RCC
Kevin Morris of Rinconada,
Microdisc director Chester Rice,
and other Microdisc staff mem
bers.
Do I need to buy a computer?
Every dorm has a 24-hour
computer cluster with four or five
Macintoshes, although you may
sometimes have to wait for an
available computer.
If you're worried about power
or capability, the clusters have
more than enough for multimedia
use, computer programming or
just word processing.
