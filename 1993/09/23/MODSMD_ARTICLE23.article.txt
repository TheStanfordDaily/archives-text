# Computer choices cause undue confusion
## Mac or IBM? To buy or not to buy? How to decide what you need 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
Choosing the "right" computer
can be like deciding between a
Porsche 911 and a Pinto.
If you never drive faster than
45 mph, the speedy Porsche
engine has way too much power.
Similarly, the difference between
buying a Macintosh Classic and a
Quadra depends on what you
need.
To buy a computer, Residen
tial Computer Consultant Adam
Elman recommends the Book
store's Microdisc department, for
good prices on a Macintosh. He
also suggests local businesses
such as Central Stores, located on
campus, or Fry's Electronics,
within biking distance from cam
pus, for alternative choices such
as IBMs or clones.
Most computer sellers usually
have several models on the floor
for hands-on demonstrations.
In order of importance, here
are some of the most-asked ques

tions by computer buyers at Stan
ford, according to Elman, RCC
Kevin Morris of Rinconada,
Microdisc director Chester Rice,
and other Microdisc staff mem
bers.
Do I need to buy a computer?
Every dorm has a 24-hour
computer cluster with four or five
Macintoshes, although you may
sometimes have to wait for an
available computer.
If you're worried about power
or capability, the clusters have
more than enough for multimedia
use, computer programming or
just word processing.
For the student who writes


Dongmin Shim - Daily

only a few papers a quarter, usu
ally you can find a spare comput
er in the cluster or a friend's
room.
Both University computing
centers, at Meyer Library and
Tresidder Union, have been
equipped with the latest technol
ogy: the Centris 650 with BMB of
RAM, a 230 MB hard drive, and
an internal CD-ROM drive is now
the standard.
With all of these resources
available for free to Stanford stu
dents, is your own computer real
ly necessary?
Should I buy a Mac or an
IBM?
At Stanford, the IBM is
absent. Although some students
still own a few IBMs or IBM
clones, they're the exception, not
the rule.
The campus network — which
allows you to register for classes,

vote in ASSU elections and check
your e-mail — is more easily
accessible from Macs, especially if
you have an in-room connection.
Simple activities such as send
ing a paper to a University print
er are very difficult from an IBM,
according to Elman and Morris.
And software that professors
generate as parts of their courses
are usually made for the Macin
tosh.
Both RCCs said they would
"very seriously recommend buy
ing a Macintosh." Elman added,
"The only reason to get an IBM is
if you've been using one all your
life or if you absolutely hate
Macs."
If you don't know how to use a
Mac, fear not, because the RCC
in every dorm offers the one-unit
CS-001C, an easy class designed
to teach you all about it.
Should I get a laptop or a
desktop computer?
Now that laptops and desk
tops are within a comparable
price range, there's room to seri
ously consider this question.

For taking your computer to
the library, the Oval, or for sav
ing desk space, the Mac Power
books are the right choice,
according to Elman and Morris.
The desktops with equal speed
and capability as these portables
may be a little cheaper, but they
stay put and require costly moni
tors. However, for large screens,
excellent color, and optimum
speed, a desktop might be a bet
ter choice.
"All things equal [between
desktops and laptops), I would
buy a Powerbook," Elman said.
What's the best laptop?
The Macintosh Powerbook
165, with a 33Mhz 68030
Motorola processor, can be pur
chased at Microdisc for $1,579.
But, for $45 less, you can get a
Powerbook 165 c, the same com
puter with a color screen and a
68882 floating-point math copro
cessor, which allows the comput
er to redraw the color screen
faster.
(The color screen costs less
because it still eats up battery

power much faster than the 16
shades of gray available on the
165.)
On the low end, the Power
book 1458, 25Mhz 68030, comes
in at $1,146. For word processing
and spreadsheets, Elman said he
thought this would be adequate.
Remember, adding a color
screen will tax battery power,
thus reducing extended "out
side" usage.
Both RCCs agreed that the
Powerbooks 180 and 180 c, with
33Mhz 68030 chip and a math
coprocesssor, are not enough
computer for the money. The
Powerbook Duos 210, 25Mhz
68030, and 230, 33Mhz 68030,
would also be a premature buys,
since Apple is expected to release
a new line soon.
If you're still thinking IBM,
the portable ThinkPad,
50/25 MHz 486SLC2 processor,
comes in at almost $3000.
What's the best desktop?
Morris recommended a Mac
LC 111. If you need more power or
a CD-ROM, you can find it in

your dorm clusters, he said.
Remember, each dorm cluster
will have a Quadra and a new
Centris with a CD-ROM drive.
If you can afford it, Elman
said he thought the Centris 650
or 660AV would be worthwhile
purchases.
At the Bookstore, Rice pre
dicted that the LC 111 and the
Centris 610 "will be big sellers"
this fall.
How do I service my comput
er if it breaks down?
On the side of the Bookstore
facing the post office, there is a
window where you can bring
your Macs for service.
Do I need a printer?
Every dorm computer cluster
has a laser printer available to all
students for 5 cents a sheet. The
only drawback is the possibility
that 10 other students who have
the same CIV class as you might
want to print at the same time.
A Stylewriter (for Macs) at
$288 is also a good printer for the
money.
