# Combining the natural and social sciences
## Interdisciplinary programs offer unique opportunities for techies

Just as McDonald's combines the four food
groups to produce its Big Mac, Stanford com
bines classes and professors from different
departments to produce its interdisciplinary
mtyors.
Interdisciplinary majors are intended to
fuse the ideas of multiple departments into
one mtyor, often allowing techies a chance to
formally incorporate fuzzy classes into their
m*yor.
For example, the human biology mtyor
brings social and psychological issues into the
study of biology. And the recently created
earth systems combines chemistry,
biology, physics, geology, engineering, and
computer science with public policy and eco

nomics to explore environmental studies.
Here's a closer look at these particular
interdisciplinary majors:
Earth systems
• Combines natural sciences and engineer
ing with economics
• Requires an environment-related intern
ship
• Some mtyors have gone to the Stanford
in-Washington program during the environ
ment-focused quarter for an internship and
classes
Gary Ernst, dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, calls earth systems "fundamentally
and structurally different" than any other
environmental studies in the nation.
Although most universities carry a gradu
ate program in the environment, a few, such

as Rice and Duke, are joining Stanford in
offering an undergraduate major, according to
Ernst.
"In today's world, you have to speak sever
al scientific languages," said senior Sarah
Posey, an earth systems mf\jor.
Ernst explains the philosophy behind earth
systems with this analogy: "Just as air pollu
tion transcends country boundaries, so does
the study of the environment transcend
departmental boundaries."
Human biology
• Combines social and psychological issues
with biology
• Requires an internship in the student's
field
• Very flexible, allows students to choose
their focus
The human biology major,
popular with pre-med students,
offers optimum flexibility for the
student whose interests aren't
satisfied by traditional majors.
It is also frequently a stepping
stone to research for an honors
thesis.
Senior Natalie Shukov has
begun to write an honors thesis
based on her research with a pro
fessor in the School of Medicine's
cardiovascular department. She
hopes to use new technology to
explore basic heart research on
how the atrium affects or does
not affect the ventricle's blood
pumping mechanism.
Graduate Lorriana Leard
thought the major gave her "a
chance to see the whole picture . .
. I took [classes in] anthropology
and engineering and still got a
sound background for applying to
med school."
