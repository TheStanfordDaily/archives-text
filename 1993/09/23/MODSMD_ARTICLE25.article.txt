# Exam woes? Aspirin won't settle stomach
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Since many of the readers
this week are new to what the
Orientation literature (and no
one else) calls "The Farm,"
allow me to explain this col
umn's raison d'etre: Even at a
technically oriented institution
like Stanford, people occasion
ally have science-related ques
tions that simply cannot be sat
isfied by a 50-minute trip to
your friendly

neighborhood lec
ture hall.
But hey, no
worries — you've
got me.
So if you have
a burning scien
tific query that
even your RA
cannot answer,

ask me. Drop written questions
in the Bug Box, located just
outside The Daily's office at the
west entrance of Storke Publi
cations Building, or send elec
tronic mail to
cpatil@leland.stanford.edu. I
never make up questions; ergo,
I need my readership's help.
So come on. Don't be shy.
My 22 inches are waiting.
Q: Why does aspirin upset
your stomach? Are Tylenol
and Advil equally bad ?
— Bellyaching in Branner
a : Many years ago, some sage
•rediscovered that an infusion
of willow bark can cure body
aches, joint pains and fever.
The willow — a tree which has
one of the lowest incidences of
headache in the entire veg
etable kingdom — contains in
its tissues the wonder drug
acetylsalicylate ("aspirin" to
you).

As the years went by and
purification techniques
improved, aspirin became the
Western World's painkiller of
choice. It is cheaply acquired,
even more cheaply synthesized,
and has a broad range of anal
gesic effects.
Unfortunately, about one in
five people can't take very
much of it without getting a
sore tummy.
To understand why, consid
er the everyday plight of the

stomach. Food
fares the same
chance in the
stomach as the
proverbial snow
ball in Hell. It's a
very hostile envi
ronment: acidic,
rich in degradative
enzymes, and good

at breaking down
foods as unnatural as a Big
Mac™. Miraculously, the stom
ach digests everything you put
into it without digesting itself.
Your stomach owes its con
tinued healthy existence to its
mucosal lining. Aspirin dis
rupts this protective layer in
two major ways.
Acetylsalicylate is a slippery
little molecule, and can pass
through mucus directly into
the cells of the stomach wall.
There, it damages essential
proteins and disrupts the salt
balance of the cells. Excess acid
secretion and bleeding can
result.
. But that ain't the half of it.
Aspirin (and ibuprofen/-
Advil™*) works by inactivating
the enzyme cyclooxygenase.
This enzyme synthesizes
prostaglandins, which are fatty
compounds released at sites of
ii\jury and infection to signal


The Science Bug
local immune cells to inflame the
surrounding tissue.
Inflammation does assist the
healing process in some ways — a
swollen, painful joint remains
immobile, convincing its owner to
use it less frequently until repairs

are complete — but in these days
of Ace™ bandages and air casts,
who needs a fatty messenger
molecule telling other cells what to
do?
Prostaglandins form an essential
component of the stomach lining,
inhibiting gastric secretion of acid
and stimulating production of natu
ral buffers and mucus. Chronic con
sumption of aspirin removes this
line of defense, making your poor

tummy more susceptible to the rav
ages of its own digestive abilities.
Happily, there are aspirin alter
natives available over the counter.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) has
almost no gastrointestinal side
effects at normal doses. Ibuprofen
(ak.a. Advil) is a cyclooxygenase
inhibitor like aspirin, but is easier
on the gastrointestinal system. It is
more specific for the type of
cyclooxygenase found in other tis

sues, so it lets the stomach's
enzyme get by with less interfer
ence.
When you chose Stanford, you
put yourself in a high-risk group
for ulcers. My amateur medical
advice to you is this: Don't make it
worse by taking aspirin for your
aches and pains. Try Advil or
Tylenol instead.
And no — the companies aren't
paying me.
