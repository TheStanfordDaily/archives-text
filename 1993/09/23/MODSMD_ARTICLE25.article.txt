# Exam woes? Aspirin won't settle stomach
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Since many of the readers
this week are new to what the
Orientation literature (and no
one else) calls "The Farm,"
allow me to explain this col
umn's raison d'etre: Even at a
technically oriented institution
like Stanford, people occasion
ally have science-related ques
tions that simply cannot be sat
isfied by a 50-minute trip to
your friendly

neighborhood lec
ture hall.
But hey, no
worries — you've
got me.
So if you have
a burning scien
tific query that
even your RA
cannot answer,

ask me. Drop written questions
in the Bug Box, located just
outside The Daily's office at the
west entrance of Storke Publi
cations Building, or send elec
tronic mail to
cpatil@leland.stanford.edu. I
never make up questions; ergo,
I need my readership's help.
So come on. Don't be shy.
My 22 inches are waiting.
Q: Why does aspirin upset
your stomach? Are Tylenol
and Advil equally bad ?
— Bellyaching in Branner
a : Many years ago, some sage
•rediscovered that an infusion
of willow bark can cure body
aches, joint pains and fever.
The willow — a tree which has
one of the lowest incidences of
headache in the entire veg
etable kingdom — contains in
its tissues the wonder drug
acetylsalicylate ("aspirin" to
you).

As the years went by and
purification techniques
improved, aspirin became the
Western World's painkiller of
choice. It is cheaply acquired,
even more cheaply synthesized,
and has a broad range of anal
gesic effects.
Unfortunately, about one in
five people can't take very
much of it without getting a
sore tummy.
To understand why, consid
er the everyday plight of the

stomach. Food
fares the same
chance in the
stomach as the
proverbial snow
ball in Hell. It's a
very hostile envi
ronment: acidic,
rich in degradative
enzymes, and good

at breaking down
foods as unnatural as a Big
Mac™. Miraculously, the stom
ach digests everything you put
into it without digesting itself.
Your stomach owes its con
tinued healthy existence to its
mucosal lining. Aspirin dis
rupts this protective layer in
two major ways.
Acetylsalicylate is a slippery
little molecule, and can pass
through mucus directly into
the cells of the stomach wall.
There, it damages essential
proteins and disrupts the salt
balance of the cells. Excess acid
secretion and bleeding can
result.
. But that ain't the half of it.
Aspirin (and ibuprofen/-
Advil™*) works by inactivating
the enzyme cyclooxygenase.
This enzyme synthesizes
prostaglandins, which are fatty
compounds released at sites of
ii\jury and infection to signal
