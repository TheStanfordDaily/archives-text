# From Gorbachev to earthquakes: A little Farm history
## 
### 
There's always something hap
pening at Stanford. Whether it be
a speech by a Supreme Court jus
tice or an important medical dis
covery, Stanford shapes the
events of the country and world as
well as the surrounding commu
nities.
Here are highlights from the
past four years:
April 1989
The University Committee on
Minority Issues report was
released. The report compiled
statistics from interviews with
more than 1,300 students, docu
mented underlying racial tensions
on campus and offered more than
100 recommendations for improv
ing minority life at Stanford.
May 1989
Police in riot gear arrested
more than 50 students after
protesters took over University
President Donald Kennedy's
office, demanding an immediate
meeting with Kennedy to discuss
multicultural issues.
October 1989
A devastating earthquake mea
suring 7.1 on the Richter scale
rocked the Bay Area on October
17. The Loma Prieta quake —
which caused $160 million worth
of damage on campus — was the
largest in the area since the 1906
tremor that destroyed much of
San Francisco.
February 1990
Facing a budget deficit for the
second year in a row, the Universi
ty announced a massive $22 mil
lion cut in its operating budget.
Known as "repositioning," the
cuts focused on administrative
expenses.

April 1990
Controversy over the invalida
tion of write-in ballots in the
ASSU elections prompted more
than 2,000 students to sign a peti
tion demanding a recall of the
"People's Platform" Council of
Presidents. Among the victorious
candidates was cartoon character
Bart Simpson.
May 1990
After a year of relative silence
about free speech, the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
approved a revised interpretation
of the Fundamental Standard that
outlawed discriminatory harass
ment.
June 1990
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev took a whirlwind tour of
Stanford and delivered a historic

address to 1,700 students, faculty
and staff in Memorial Auditorium.
October 1990
In response to the govern
ment's recently passed Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, the
University announced a new alco
hol and dtug policy explicitly pro
hibiting the unlawful use of alco
hol and drugs on campus by stu
dents, faculty and staff.
Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing privileges
to gay and lesbian students. The
change in policy extended hous
ing, facilities and health-care ben
efits to the domestic partners of
gay and lesbian students, as well
as to partners of heterosexual stu
dents.
November 1990
A divided Faculty Senate voted

to revamp the distribution
requirements, placing a greater
emphasis on the study of race, reli
gion and gender.
March 1991
University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beating
before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations.
The event marked the climax of
the controversy over how Stanford
charges the government for the
indirect costs of federally spon
sored projects.
April 1991
The Office of Naval Research
delivered a punishing blow to the
University, terminating nearly
100 accounting agreements, and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost
rate from 74 percent to 55.5 per
cent.
May 1991
Stuart Reges, senior lecturer in
computer science, was fired for
carrying illegal drugs on campus
and buying alcohol for underage
students. Reges had written a let
ter to national drug czar Bob Mar
tinez admitting he carried and
used drugs to protest U.S. drug
policy.
July 1991
In the face of the indirect-cost
controversy, University President
Donald Kennedy announced his
resignation, effective August
1992.
October 1991
The University announced a
$43-million deficit-reduction pro

March 1992
Gerhard Casper, provost of
the University of Chicago, was

ty employees.
January 1993
The Cardinal football team

son since it won the Rose Bowl
in 1971.
President Casper proposed a
three-year undergraduate
degree option in an interview
with the San Francisco Chroni
cle, but later said his remarks

it more financially stable.
April 1993

"A Clean Slate," the only slate
placed on the Council of Presi
dents election ballot, won a land
slide victory in the election,
restoring the COP after one year
in absentia.
About 70 people protested the
lack of an Asian-American stud
ies major at a rally in White
Plaza, which ended in a march to
President Casper's office.
During his State of the Uni
versity address, President
Casper announced plans to
establish a commission to re

evaluate Stanford's undergradu
ate curriculum, including the
four-year degree and the distri
bution requirement system.
May 1993
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop

resignation was addressed on
anonymous flyers that also criti
cized President Casper's policies
on multiculturalism.
Stanford's Haas Center for
Public Service was chosen as one
of a handful of universities
nationwide to participate in a
pilot program for President Bill

al service project.
President Casper appointed
Political Science Prof. Condoleez
za Rice, nationally known for her
stint on the National Security
Council, as provost, the universi
ty equivalent of a vice president.

replaced Acting Provost Gerald
Lieberman. Casper also appoint
ed Economics Prof. John Shoven
as Dean of Humanities and Sci
ence. Shoven replaced Ewart
Thomas, who stepped down to
return to teaching.
A newly formed student coali
tion of about 150 students held a
teach-in in White Plaza, calling
for the University to listen to
student voices and to renew its
commitment to multicultural
ism.

There's always something hap
pening at Stanford. Whether it be
a speech by a Supreme Court jus

events of the country and world as
well as the surrounding commu
nities.
Here are highlights from the
past four years:
April 1989
The University Committee on

mented underlying racial tensions
on campus and offered more than
100 recommendations for improv
ing minority life at Stanford.

Controversy over the invalida

hol and dtug policy explicitly pro
hibiting the unlawful use of alco

Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing privileges

gay and lesbian students, as well
as to partners of heterosexual stu

gion and gender.
March 1991

rate from 74 percent to 55.5 per
cent.

Stuart Reges, senior lecturer in
computer science, was fired for

policy.

In the face of the indirect-cost
controversy, University President
Donald Kennedy announced his
