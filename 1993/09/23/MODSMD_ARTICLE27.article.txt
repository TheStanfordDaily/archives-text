# Bookstore manager Eldon Speed retires
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
A year-and-a-half after a man
agement scandal at the Stanford
Bookstore, general manager Eldon
Speed has taken early retirement,
citing health concerns.
In an Aug. 31 letter to Book
store employees, Speed wrote, "I
do not have to tell you all that the
past 19 months have been difficult.
The stress of it has worn on all of
us. Unfortunately, it has created
some health problems for me."
Speed and his chief deputy,
Philip Chiaramonte, have been
under investigation by the Attor
ney General of California for vio
lating compensation laws applica
ble to non-profit organizations.
In February 1992, The Daily
reported that Bookstore employees
enjoyed perquisites unheard of in
the college bookstore industry,
including a vacation home leased
from the two men's consulting
company, and luxury company cars
available to at least eight managers.
The store, run by a board of fac
ulty, students and staff, is a non
profit corporation separate from
the University.
Law Prof William Lazier, a mem

ber of the board, will serve as interim
acting general manager. Lazier is a
businessman who has been a lectur-

er at the Graduate
School of Busi
ness.
Acting director
of the Bookstore
Board Robert
Weisberg said
a search will begin
"very soon" for a
new chairman.
"We're very

sorry to see him go," said Weisberg.
"We're very grateful for his many
years of service to the Bookstore."
In addition to the perquisites,
the Bookstore has also experienced
financial problems including a $1.8
million investment loss in 1990.
The slew of problems led to an
expansion of the Bookstore board
last year and a modification of
compensation practices. In addi
tion, the vacation home, located in
Twain Haute, Calif., is currently
for sale for $450,000.
Speed said his request for early
retirement was granted by the
Board in late August.
Speed will continue to serve as a
consultant to the Bookstore, Weis
berg said.
