# Almost there
## Class of '97 achieves nearly perfect gender balance 
### John Hall Editorial staff 
This year's incoming class is
the most gender-balanced class
in Stanford history, with men
accounting for 50.5 percent of
the 1,616 class members and
women, 49.5 percent.
Ethnic minorities and inter
national students also comprise
half the Class of '97.
Students come from all 50
states and 43 foreign countries,
including Brazil, Bulgaria, Eng
land and the United Arab Emi
rates, among others.
Californians make up 42 per
cent of the class, the largest
state representation, followed
by Texas, New York, Washing
ton, Illinois and New Jersey.
Statistically, this year's
freshman class closely mirrors
last year's, in both ethnic diver
sity and academic qualifica
tions, said Dean of Admissions
James Montoya.
Of the 13,608 applications
received by the Admissions
Office, 2,926 students — or 21.5
percent — were offered admis
sion.
Among 1,616 matriculating
students, 73 percent achieved
grade-point averages between
3.8 and 4.0 during high school.
Montoya noted "a small
improvement" in this figure
from last year's 71 percent.
Eighty-eight percent of the
freshmen fell into the top tenth
of their high school class; 95
percent were in the top 20 per
cent. Seventy percent attended
public schools, while the
remainder attended private
schools. Students with SAT
scores over 700 in the verbal
and math sections number 22
percent and 59 percent, respec
tively.
In this year's transfer class,
there are 120 new students rep

resenting 89 colleges in 29
states and Washington, D.C. Of
these institutions, 28 percent
were community colleges.
Seven students transferred
from colleges in other nations,
including Bulgaria, Malaysia,
China, the Philippines, Singa
pore, Sweden and Thailand.
Thirty-nine percent of the

transfer class are ethnic minori
ties and international students.
Students who scored over
1300 on the SAT compose 46
percent of the transfer class;
students who scored over 1200
account for 72 percent.
Seventy-two percent of the
transfers maintained college
GPAs between 3.6 and 4.0.
