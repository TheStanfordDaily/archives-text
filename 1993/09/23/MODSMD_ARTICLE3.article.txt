### Lindsey Marcus Editorial staff 
The University Cabinet lauded
Stanford's overall progress on mi
nority issues yesterday, but said
stronger efforts are needed to at
tract minority faculty and staff.
In its official response to the
1991 review of the University
Committee on Minority Issues re
port, the cabinet also expressed
support for cultural and ethnic
centers as well as theme houses,
"insofar as they provide educa
tional benefits for, and stimulate
interaction and mutual learning
among, students from a wide vari
ety of backgrounds."

The cabinet labeled minority
faculty hiring "a source of urgent
concern" in its response. While
budget reductions have caused an
overall shrinking of the Universi
ty's staff, the cabinet noted that
the percentage of minority em
ployees stayed the same from be
tween April 1992 and April 1993.
It reiterated a commitment to cre
ating a diverse community "even
while responding to the ongoing
fiscal problems that the Universi
ty will face in the coming years."
The cabinet also reinforced the
importance of Stanford's cultural
and ethnic community centers
and theme houses. It stated that
despite budget cuts, funding for
student support and services
should not "fall below acceptable
levels." It added that support for
these services is among the Univer
sity's main development objectives.
Although the response did not
specify how the University would
raise the money or whether a
monetary goal had "been set for
cultural center funding, History
Prof. A 1 Camarillo said "by
putting it as a high priority for
development, then you stand a
good chance of getting money."
Another issue of concern is the
graduate student body, in which
"there are some significant areas
of underrepresentation." Camar
illo, who chaired the original
UCMI, also said he believes this is
a pressing multicultural concern
for the cabinet. The University
has to "take stock of what's being
done and why departments
haven't been able to recruit,
admit and retain minority gradu
ate students," he said.
The UCMI was established in
1987 by the president and
provost after students demanded
a formal investigation and evalu
ation of the University's multi
cultural aims.
Composed of 21 faculty, staff,
students and outside experts,
UCMI published its findings in a
1989 report that included 130
recommendations on how Stan
ford could further diversify its
community. The report was to be
reviewed periodically.
To evaluate Stanford's

progress in reaching the goals
defined in UCMI, the cabinet
response said the University will
conduct "an internal review of
key areas" this year. This summa
ry review will prepare Stanford
for a "comprehensive" review no
later than 1995, which will incor
porate perspectives from outside
the University as well.
Camarillo said it is costly to

perform a com
prehensive
review, and he
agreed it is not
necessary before
1995 because the
state of multicul
tural affairs has
not changed
rapidly enough to
warrant a large
scale analysis.

"It makes the most sense to
have a summary review now to
see where we are and where defi
ciencies exist," he said.
The cabinet also noted in its
response that the curriculum has
been diversified since 1989, with
at least 20 new courses and 18
modified courses with multicul
tural emphases.
The response also contained
an affirmation of the review
panel's recommendation that the
UCMI report include an evalua
tion of gender, sexual orientation
and disability issues.
Law School Dean Paul Brest,
who authored the response, said
he was pleased with the cabinet's
response.
"It's certainly an attempt to
cover all the major bases," he
said. "The next step is outlined â€”
an internal review panel."
