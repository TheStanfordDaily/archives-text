# Orientation highlights unity
##

Even before classes start, new
Stanford students face a schedule
packed with lectures and place
ment tests, panels and presenta
tions.
But don't worry, there are no
grades given here.
The University's Orientation
week has dozens of activities
planned to introduce new stu
dents to Stanford, and one facet
of campus life in particular. Ori
entation for the Class of '97 will
encourage students to explore the
ethnic, sexual, and religious
facets of Stanford life, said head
student Orientation coordinator
Victor Madrigal.
These different facets are pre
sented through programs such as
"Community Kaleidoscopes,"
receptions for students and par
ents sponsored by Asian-Ameri
can, black, Chicano/Latino,
Native American and interna
tional student orientation
groups.
A religious diversity program,
"Faith In Academics," will focus
on finding a balance between reli
gious beliefs and academics.
Organized by Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiya
ma, the program will take the
form of a roundtable discussion

with three people each from dif
ferent religious groups.
"Faces of the Community"
also introduces new students to
Stanford's diversity. Created
three years ago by former Multi
cultural Educator Greg Ricks,
"Faces" will focus on Stanford's
history and diversity.
Akiyama said that the pro
gram will include slides which
chronicle the history of multicul
turalism at Stanford, as well as
the history of student rallies on
campus.
"We've tried to put together a
program that is engaging and
interesting without shaving the
edges off of tough diversity
issues," she said. "It will chal
lenge them to think about who
they are in a diverse communi
ty."
But by stressing diversity, Ori
entation does not intend to be
divisive, organizers say.
Victor Madrigal, head student
Orientation coordinator, agreed.
"We want to emphasize a unified
campus, rather than a fractured
community," he said. "We want
to make all students feel wel
come."
The range of events and pro
grams for certain ethnic groups
are only part of Orientation's
goal to "try to accommodate
everyone and not to exclude any

one," said Monte Klaudt, student
director of the Native-American
orientation.
"Some may question why
there is a retreat for the Native-
American students ... they are
coming straight from reserva
tions and need help adjusting to
city life," said Klaudt. "Orienta
tion is for everybody ... everyone
should feel welcome here."
"I see [Orientation] as a 'wel
coming by' each ethnic group
rather than a 'welcoming for' a
particular group," said Una Lee,
student director of Asian-Ameri
can orientation.
Unfortunately, this year's wel
comes will be slightly fewer and
further between than in the past.
The Orientation directors are
working with a smaller budget
than previous years, so there will
be fewer programs across the
board.
"We haven't changed the cal
endar that much," Porteus said.
"Although we have spread the
events out so as not to have too
many programs on the same day.
The major programs are the same:
MuFuUnSun, Sex in the '90s and
Faces of the Community."
But Porteus added that the
spreading and cutting of pro
grams gives the new students
"breathing space" and more time
to reflect on them.
