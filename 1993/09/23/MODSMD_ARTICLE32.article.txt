# Indirect costs continue to confuse
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
Summer ended on an uncertain
note for Stanford in its continuous
wrangling with the federal gov
ernment over indirect-costs.
On the bright side for the Uni
versity, its indirect cost rate was
increased slightly, from 60.3 per
cent to 61 percent for the 1993-94
year.
The new rate means about $1
million more per year for the Uni
versity, according to Chief Finan
cial Officer Peter Van Etten.
The indirect-cost rate is the
amount the University is reim
bursed by the federal government
for overhead costs that cannot be
charged to a specific research pro
ject, such as building depreciation.
The University has also neared
completion of a 35-point program
recommended by the Arthur
Andersen & Co. accounting firm
to improve its indirect-cost
accounting methods.
The program was implemented
in 1991, in response to scandals
affecting several universities over
the last few years concerning inap
propriate indirect costs charges.
Stanford, for example, was
accused of charging the govern
ment for a yacht and for antiques
in the University president's
house.
On the other hand, the long
awaited adoption by the Clinton
administration of changes to Fed
eral Circular A-21 — the regula
tions which govern how indirect
costs are determined — has

added even more procedures and
prohibitions to the already com
plex indirect-cost accounting pro
cess.
While the A-21 changes are
"exactly what we expected,"
according to Reed Brimhall, direc
tor of costs and rate studies, he
could not give any estimate of
what the total costs for imple
menting them would be.
The only certainty is that the
future impact of the changes is
unclear. Though the new regula
tions were adopted on July 15, the
University has not yet been able to
coherently interpret them, Van
Etten said.
For instance, the new regula
tions say that the only administra

tive costs that can be charged as
"direct costs" are those that are
associated with projects.
However, the word "mtyor" is not
defined, creating confusion over
which administrative costs can be
directly charged, Van Etten said.
Other unresolved issues
include the expected end of tuition
remission — the system of govern
ment reimbursement for a part of
the tuition of graduate students
involved in federally sponsored
research — which will take effect
September 1997.
While Van Etten said he is
uncertain of the amount it will
cost the University, officials last
year calculated a possible loss of
$12 million from the end of tuition

remission. They also estimated
that the positions of about 25 per
cent of graduate students would
be jeopardized when the change is
implemented.
The new regulations also keep
the amount of administrative
costs that can be charged indirect
ly at 26 percent of total indirect
costs. Stanford's administrative
costs over the past year are
already estimated to exceed that
threshold by several million dol
lars.
And since student services are
now included in these administra
tive costs, Stanford may lose the
more than $2.5 million it used to
receive for graduate student sup
port.
Finally, the A-21 changes put a
more complex accounting method
in place, which will cost the Uni
versity more time and effort to
comply with, Van Etten said.
However, in spite of the confu
sion over the effects of A-21, Van
Etten said he feels the University
and federal government negotia
tions are back on track. While he
hesitated to call the relationship
normal — "What exactly does nor
mal mean?" he asked — he main
tained that Stanford's well-publi
cized indirect-cost scandal is in the
past.
"It's a rational process with
both parties. We negotiate with
out any regard to the scandal,"
Van Etten said, noting that the 61
percent rate the University has
now is only 2 percent away from
the rate he thinks it should be
paid.
