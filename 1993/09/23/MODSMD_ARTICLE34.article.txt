As helpful as your RA may be, your first few
weeks at Stanford can be a little disorienting. We at
The Daily remember that feeling all too well. So, to
make your first weeks at Stanford as worry-free as
possible, we compiled this list of answers to some of
the most frequently asked Orientation week ques
tions:

How do I pay my University Bill
and ensure my financial aid?
To pay your bill, go to the Oak West
lounge on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. If you already have a check for

the amount due, just look for the big box in which to
deposit your yellow envelope. If you suspect an error
in your bill, or need to get loan disbursements or
pick up scholarship money, there are several specif
ic counters to assist you. But if you have questions,
come early — lines can get really, really long. And
for those who have no clue where to begin, there is
even a "No Clue" line to stand in.

I What happens if I miss an Orienta
tion activity?
Relax. Orientation programs are rec
ommended but not mandatory. Every
opportunity to get to know Stanford

and the people around you will pay off in the long
run, but things may come up that prevent you from
attending every activity that you'd like to attend.

Do I need to take a math, chem
istry or foreign language place
ment test?
Math: If you do not have Advanced
Placement credit or college transfer

credit and wish to take a math class, you need to
take the math placement test. All math placement
tests are taken using computers in dorm clusters
and last one hour. You should plan to take the test
before you meet with your adviser. Your score,
which you will get as soon as you finish the test, is
strictly to help you determine which math class you
should enroll in. In other words, no one will see it
but you.
Chemistry: All students, including those with AP
credit, must take the chemistry placement test to en
roll in a chemistry class at Stanford. Check your Ori
entation calendar for times and locations. As with the
math test, your score is personal information.



Foreign Language: The Uni
versity requires all students to
achieve competency in a foreign
language equal to a third quarter,
first year course. If you do not
have AP language credit or have
not completed a third-year high
school language course, you
should plan to take this test. Even
if you do have AP credit, check

with the proper language depart
ment to find out if you are
required to take the language test.

How do I find my
way around cam
pus?
First, some words of
wrrning. Hoo'er

Tower serves as a poor landmark
because it looks the same from all
four sides. And if you try to use
the sun to navigate, beware — for
some strange reason, maps of

Stanford are oriented upside
down, so North is inconveniently
at the bottom. Your best advice?
Carry a map with you, and don't
be afraid to ask for directions —
we all did when we were frosh.

If I'm having
trouble with a
class, can I get a
tutor?
The answer is prob-

ably yes. The Center for Teaching
and Learning gets about 2,000

requests for help each year, and is
usually able to accommodate
them, said Tutoring Director Jack
Prostko. Students looking for help
with introductory classes can get
up to eight hours of free tutoring
per quarter, he said. In addition,
CTL offers math and chemistry
tutoring at Meyer Library, Mon
day through Thursday, 7 p.m.-9
p.m. Writing tutors are also avail
able at Meyer. In addition, many
dorms have tutors, and some
departments offer tutoring for
their classes.
