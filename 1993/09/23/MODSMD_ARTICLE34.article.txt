As helpful as your RA may be, your first few
weeks at Stanford can be a little disorienting. We at
The Daily remember that feeling all too well. So, to
make your first weeks at Stanford as worry-free as
possible, we compiled this list of answers to some of
the most frequently asked Orientation week ques
tions:

How do I pay my University Bill
and ensure my financial aid?
To pay your bill, go to the Oak West
lounge on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. If you already have a check for

the amount due, just look for the big box in which to
deposit your yellow envelope. If you suspect an error
in your bill, or need to get loan disbursements or
pick up scholarship money, there are several specif
ic counters to assist you. But if you have questions,
come early â€” lines can get really, really long. And
for those who have no clue where to begin, there is
even a "No Clue" line to stand in.

I What happens if I miss an Orienta
tion activity?
Relax. Orientation programs are rec
ommended but not mandatory. Every
opportunity to get to know Stanford

and the people around you will pay off in the long
run, but things may come up that prevent you from
attending every activity that you'd like to attend.

Do I need to take a math, chem
istry or foreign language place
ment test?
Math: If you do not have Advanced
Placement credit or college transfer

credit and wish to take a math class, you need to
take the math placement test. All math placement
tests are taken using computers in dorm clusters
and last one hour. You should plan to take the test
before you meet with your adviser. Your score,
which you will get as soon as you finish the test, is
strictly to help you determine which math class you
should enroll in. In other words, no one will see it
but you.
Chemistry: All students, including those with AP
credit, must take the chemistry placement test to en
roll in a chemistry class at Stanford. Check your Ori
entation calendar for times and locations. As with the
math test, your score is personal information.
