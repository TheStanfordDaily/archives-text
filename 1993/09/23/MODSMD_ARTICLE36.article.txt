# The 						match game: How roomies are made
## 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Did it matter to Stanford that
you specifically requested living
with a non-smoking Californian
classical music lover? Or did that
only increase your odds of being
matched up with a nicotine-addict
ed rapping Southerner?
The answer lies somewhere in
the middle.

"We like to pair students with
some differences together so they
can learn from each other," said Bill
Georges, director of the Stanford
Housing Center. "But at the same
time we make sure roommates
have some things in common on
which to build a friendship."
The basic philosophy of the
Housing Center is not to create best
friends but to make compatible
roommate pairs, Georges said.

Matching specific couples is left
to the New Undergraduate Studeit
Information Project, a pair of stu
dent coordinators who began the
process last spring.
The first step in pairing room
mates is placing the new students
into dorms, then dividing dorm
groups into men and women. The
possibilities are winnowed away as
the new students are further divid
ed into Californians and non-Cali

fornians.
"We never pair two Californians,
two varsity athletes or two people in
the same CIV section," said project
coordinator Carolyn Laub. "But
those are pretty much the only
hard-and-fast rules we follow."
Then, the formula becomes a bit
more subjective.
The coordinators try to focus on
basic similarities, like musical taste
or a common interest in sports,
while maintaining some academic
and cultural differences.
And though they strive to create
winning pairs the first time
around, often making the perfect
match takes a few tries.
"It can get kind of frustrating,"
Laub said. "I get really attached to
some of my roommate pairs, and
then it turns out we're left with

two people who look like they'll kill
each other and we have to re-room
mate."
The more information new stu
dents provide about themselves, the
easier the whole process becomes.
"It's really hard to feel like you
know someone from a piece of
paper," Laub said. "The littlest
detail that someone shares can
make you feel like you know them a
whole lot better."
In addition to pairing room
mates, the project coordinators
spend the summer fielding calls
from concerned students and par

ents "wanting to know what it's
like here," said Undergraduate
Housing Supervisor Beth Schmid.
"One of the main reasons that
the coordinators are students is
because they can really convey a
realistic picture of student life to
other students," Schmid said.
Curious callers are often disap
pointed to learn that the Housing
Center does not release the names
of roommates until the student
arrive on campus.
The reasons behind this policy
are both practical and philosophi
cal, Georges said.

"We don't want students to
arrive with any preconceived
notions. Everyone should be on
equal footing," Georges said. "Also,
it's not fair that some pairs may
have already built up a relationship
before coming to Stanford."
Roommate pairs might also
have to be split up in the fall
because of people who decide not to
come to Stanford at the last
minute.
Most of the summer pairings,
however, make it into the dorms,
and into each other's first year
memories.
