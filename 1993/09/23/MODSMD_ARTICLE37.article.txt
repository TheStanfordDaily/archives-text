# At Stern, dorm is where the heart is
## Resident fellows reap benefits from bringing up babies in Serra

Can you imagine living in Stern Hall
for three years?
Can you imagine living in Stern Hall
for your entire life?
Can you imagine how great that
could be?
If not, just ask Serra's two youngest
residents, Naomi and Simon, the chil
dren of Serra Resident Fellows Ross
Shachter and Ruth Yamawaki. Since
moving into the dorm three years ago
("We started eating at Stern food ser
vice before there were points," be
moans Shachter) the two tykes have
made a home out of a dorm.
At 3-3/4 years old, Naomi has called
Serra home most of her life; 16-month
old Simon has known no other home.
And, according to the family members
(well, everyone except Simon), the ex
perience has been generally positive for
the parents, the children and the stu
dents who live in the dorm.
Having small children in a dorm fills
a hole in the lives of some Stanford un
dergraduates who miss the patter of lit
tle feet, virtually unheard elsewhere on
campus, said Shachter, a professor of
engineering-economic systems.
"It's kind of an unnatural communi

ty to have everybody be just between
the ages of 18 and 21. . . .Having some
kids here really adds a different ele
ment," he said.
"To see little kids makes a differ
ence — to see a family," added Ya
mawaki, who works in the Psychology
Department.
Just as students in Serra benefit
from the chance to see the younger
generation, Shachter said his children
benefit from the chance to see and
meet the incredibly diverse groups of
Serra residents that drift in and out of
their lives.
"This is the most diverse communi
ty in the area in which (we) can raise
(our) children," he said.
College life also stresses learning, try
ing new things and exercising your tal
ents, ideas that Shachter thinks Naomi
and Simon absorb to a large degree.
For Simon, being born in the dorm
provided at least one more tangible
benefit — his name. "Simon" was the
winning entry of about 18 names sug
gested last year by Serra residents in a
baby-naming contest, and Shachter
said he and his wife decided to use the
name for their son.
And if you don't believe Mom or
Dad's account of the beauties of grow
ing up in the dorm, a quick conversa

tion with Naomi will end any doubt.
From having a huge pool of potential
friends to "eating at the dining hall,"
dorm life has many benefits, Naomi
said.
As for himself, Shachter said, the
advantages of raising two young chil
dren in a dorm extend beyond those the
children see. Having your own children
in the dorm "helps to define our role"
as resident fellows, he said.
"We're sort of aunts and uncles,"
Shachter said. "You don't want to be a
parent" to the undergraduates, be
cause they already have parents and he
has children, Schachter said.
Living and dealing with undergrad
uates has helped Shachter and his wife
in other ways, he said. "It has improved
her speaking skills and my listening
skills, and I think it has improved my
teaching in some important ways," he
said.
Finally, Shachter said, there is one
big benefit: "I've met a number of won
derful people."
Naturally, there are some draw
backs to the arrangement. The primary
problem is scheduling, both RFs said —
college students and daycare "stu
dents" don't keep similar hours. Often,

Serra Resident Fellows Ross Shachter and Ruth Yamawaki share a moment of tranquili
ty with children Naomi and Simon. Both parents and children enjoy family life in a dorm.
