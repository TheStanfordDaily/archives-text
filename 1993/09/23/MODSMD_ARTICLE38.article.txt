# Diversity a source of campus vitality
## Stanford students enhance their education with multiculturalism 
### Colleen Krueger Cathy Siciliano Staff writers 
It's not exactly culture shock,
but arriving at Stanford can be a
truly eye-opening experience for
many students.
Asian-Americans comprise 24
percent of the class of '97; Mexi
can-Americans, 10 percent;
African-Americans, 9 percent;
American Indians, 2 percent and
international students, 5 percent
— all of which add up to a part of
what's called "multiculturalism"
at Stanford.
Multiculturalism is about em
bracing diversity — learning
about, and learning to appreciate,
the differences as well as the simi
larities among people. And multi
culturalism encompasses more
than just different ethnicities.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents as well as students with dis
abilities and others are also in
cluded in Stanford's definition of
multiculturalism.
And at Stanford, multicultur
alism is evident in various classes,
dorm events, ethnic community
centers, and other aspects of daily
campus life — from top-level cur
riculum decisions all the way

down to what you'll be eating for
dinner tonight.
It's in the pounding of a dozen
drums at the annual Stanford
Powwow. It's

part of the mo
mentum that
gathers as stu
dents protest a
speaker's ho
rnoph ob i c
comments. It's
in the welcom
ing smile of an
AASA big sib,
and the sad de
parture of a

friend from overseas.
It's in the sounds and colors
that bring the Stanford communi
ty to life and urge its members to
become familiar with what is new
and make new what is familiar.
"Multiculturalism is a broad
educational program with many
varied formats," said incoming
Multicultural Educator Tommy
Lee Woon. "Everyone is a multi
cultural educator. It's not some
thing that has just taken the form
of a workshop led by the so-called
'multicultural educator.' "
For sophomore Kristina


Little
Stanier, who went to a predomi
nantly white high school, coming
to Stanford meant breaking
down her share of cultural
stereotypes.
"All the Asian-Americans I
had met and interacted with fit
into a neat little mold of what I
thought Asian should be: neat,
studious, problem sets and vol
leyball, all that," Stanier said.
"Now I know it was more the
way I looked at them."
After spending her freshman
year at Stanford with an Asian-
American roommate, Stanier
said she has found a whole new
perspective.
"Now, most everyone I hang
out with is Asian," Stanier said,
adding that she drew in the
housing lottery with four Asian-
Americans.
"I don't see them first as
'Asian' though, I see them as my
friends."
Senior Cheryl Clark also had
to adjust to living in a new cul
tural environment when she
came to Stanford.
"I had to expand my ideas
about what it meant to be
African-American," Clark said.
Even as an African-American
woman living in Ujamaa, the
black theme house, she said, "I
was surrounded by a lot of people
who came from totally different
backgrounds, even though we
were supposed to be one cultural
group."
And although Clark's first
encounter with Stanford's great
diversity took place within her
"own" cultural group, she has
translated that experience into
much broader terms.
New students get their first
taste of multiculturalism at
Stanford during Orientation.
Several of this year's activities
are geared specifically toward
building new students' aware
ness of the many cultures and
needs that surround them, said
Victor Madrigal, head Orienta
tion coordinator.
The programs "are just some
of the many opportunities to
start exploring what [students]
are all about and what their
peers are about," Madrigal said.
"They give a preview of what
[students] can expect for their

next four years at Stanford."
The concept of multicultural
ism also comes through in vari
ous classes.
Through its system of distri
bution requirements and CIV,
the University makes sure no
one graduates without ponder
ing issues of culture and gender
in a formal academic setting.
Stanford attracted national
attention in 1988 when it decid
ed to change its primarily Euro
pean-based Western Culture
requirement to the current Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program.
Multicultural perspectives in
the classroom are reinforced by
Stanford's strong commitment
to building open, vibrant com
munities within the dorms, said
Ann Porteus, associate director
of Residential Education.

'We want everyone
to feel like they are
a vital and included
part of the commu
nity.'

"We want everyone to feel like
they are a vital and included part
of the community," she said.
The Office of Residential Edu
cation, responsible for training
new residence staff and setting
the tone of dorm programming,
sees multiculturalism as an
essential link to building com
munity within the dorm, said
Porteus.
"At Zapata, we get a really
mixed group of students . . .
every year is like a new experi
ment," said RA Oscar Valadez.
"We try to stress the Mexican
concept of la familia above all
else: an extended family where
you accept people for who they
are."
Multiculturalism really
becomes an active force on cam
pus when it is part of each indi
vidual's ideas and attitudes, said
Judith Little, acting director of
the Office of Multicultural
Development.
Multiculturalism begins when
people "keep their minds and
hearts open to different kinds of
people and experiences," Little
said.
