# Diversity a source of campus vitality
## Stanford students enhance their education with multiculturalism 
### Colleen Krueger Cathy Siciliano Staff writers 
It's not exactly culture shock,
but arriving at Stanford can be a
truly eye-opening experience for
many students.
Asian-Americans comprise 24
percent of the class of '97; Mexi
can-Americans, 10 percent;
African-Americans, 9 percent;
American Indians, 2 percent and
international students, 5 percent
— all of which add up to a part of
what's called "multiculturalism"
at Stanford.
Multiculturalism is about em
bracing diversity — learning
about, and learning to appreciate,
the differences as well as the simi
larities among people. And multi
culturalism encompasses more
than just different ethnicities.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents as well as students with dis
abilities and others are also in
cluded in Stanford's definition of
multiculturalism.
And at Stanford, multicultur
alism is evident in various classes,
dorm events, ethnic community
centers, and other aspects of daily
campus life — from top-level cur
riculum decisions all the way

down to what you'll be eating for
dinner tonight.
It's in the pounding of a dozen
drums at the annual Stanford
Powwow. It's

part of the mo
mentum that
gathers as stu
dents protest a
speaker's ho
rnoph ob i c
comments. It's
in the welcom
ing smile of an
AASA big sib,
and the sad de
parture of a

friend from overseas.
It's in the sounds and colors
that bring the Stanford communi
ty to life and urge its members to
become familiar with what is new
and make new what is familiar.
"Multiculturalism is a broad
educational program with many
varied formats," said incoming
Multicultural Educator Tommy
Lee Woon. "Everyone is a multi
cultural educator. It's not some
thing that has just taken the form
of a workshop led by the so-called
'multicultural educator.' "
