# Res Ed aims to ease stresses of dorm life
## 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Even after new students survive
the first-day jitters and finish drag
ging tons of luggage to the third
floor of Branner, the potentially
traumatic transition to dorm living
looms before them.
Luckily, unlike hauling bags up
three flights of stairs, new students
are not asked to make this trip
alone.
Stanford's Residential Educa
tion program — known to all Stan
ford students as Res Ed — provides
an extensive team to help students
with everything from organizing ski
trips to planning an academic pro
gram.
A new student's brush with Res
Ed begins upon arrival, when he or
she is mysteriously recognized by

name by an enthusiastic resident
assistant (more commonly known
as an RA).
Though this unexpected show of
familiarity is often what Stanford
students remember most about
their first day on campus, learning
the names and faces of new students
is a very small part of what RAs have
been doing in preparation for Orien
tation.
New RAs have been spending the
last two weeks in intensive training
classes and workshops.
"First of all, we're working on
creating a community where every
one feels welcome and can express
themselves without fear," said
Branner RA Saydeah Howard.
"Then there's the other side — in
troducing that group to the larger
Stanford community."
RAs handle day-to-day dorm
life, planning residence-based activ
ities, supervising dorm government
and spending countless hours just
hanging out with residents.
"I see RAs as resource people,"
said Roble RA Christine Nash. "A

lot of being an effective RA is know
ing where to send people for infor
mation and letting them know
what's available."
And while Nash admits that, as
an RA, "you need the ability to wear
a lot of different hats," she is quick
to point out that a police cap Ls not
among them.
Stanford RAs are not expected to
play the role of hall monitors
regarding drinking and overnight
visitors.

"We're not going to be looking
over shoulders — these people are
adults," said Nash.
New students should rest easier
knowing that RFs — faculty or stafT
members who live in dorms —
share Nash's respect for their resi
dents.
Although RFs live in residences
with students, often eat meals in
dorm dining halls and even receive
a copy of each resident's grades,
Roble RF Mitzi Van Sant summa

rized her role in two words: "Not
parental.
"I think a lot of new students
worry about RFs being parents, and
that's not what we're here for at
all," said Van Sant.
RFs and RAs, along with resi
dent computer coordinators (RCCs)
and advising associates (AAs), cre
ate a residence-based support sys
tem that will be in place long after
Orientation week is over.
An AA can come in handy when

freshmen feel they need to talk with
"someone who has already stum
bled through freshman year, and
can hopefully make it a little easier
for them," Junipero AA Adam
Miller said.
Each part of the residence staff
is working toward a common goal,
said Assoc. Director of Res Ed Ann
Porteus.
"One of the great things about
the system is that you've got vari
ous houses finding their own ways

to work together," said Porteus.
"But we're all working to build
community, and there's a whole lot
of help available."
And if, after all that help, you're
still stuck at the bottom of the sec
ond flight of stairs with suitcases in
hand, Res Ed hasn't forgotten you
— orientation volunteers (OVs) will
be around all week to make sure
scheduled events are running
smoothly and to help new students
with cumbersome luggage.
