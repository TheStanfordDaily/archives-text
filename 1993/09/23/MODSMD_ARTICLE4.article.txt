# Multicultural office narrows focus
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Following the recommendations of an ad
hoc advisory committee, the Office of Multicul
tural Development will re-focus its attention
on staff affairs, principally affirmative action
issues, University President Gerhard Casper
announced yesterday.
"Our goal remains a campus of truly 'inter
active pluralism,' and a vital tool in fulfilling
that goal is affirmative action," Casper said in
a statement.

In its recommendations, the Ad Hoc Com
mittee on the Office for Multicultural Develop
ment proposed finding other ways to promote
the broader multicultural affairs the office cur
rently handles.
The committee's report lamented the of
fice's shift in focus from a strictly affirmative
action-based organization to an agency with
broader functions within the community. In
1990, the report states, former director Sharon
Parker, "with all good intentions . . . began to
shift the goals of the office away from affirma
tive action per se to multicultural affairs in

volving more than staff."
One of the consequences was "a de-empha
sis of the mandated (affirmative action) re
porting functions for which the office has al
ways been responsible."
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences A 1
Camarillo, who chaired the committee, said
the members strived to return the office to its
"historic objectives," namely, staff affairs. The
office was called the Affirmative Action OfTice
through 1990.
The committee recommended
that the office re-assert its com
mitment to staff affairs by assum
ing greater responsibility for
"evaluation, analysis, and report
ing of findings to the President
and Provost and to federal and
state agencies." Individual schools
and disciplines, meanwhile, would
be responsible for internal collec
tion of affirmative action data.
In his statement, Casper
agreed that the Office of Multicul

tural Development "will best serve
the University and the campus
community with a sharper focus,
centered on staff affirmative
action."
Casper's announcement
accompanied the release of the
committee's recommendations,
which were forwarded to him on
Aug. 6.
He authorized the study in late
April following Parker's resigna
tion. Judith Little has served as
interim director of the office since
May.
The committee's report also
recommended "that other ways be

explored to address broader issues
of affirmative action and multicul
tural affairs for faculty, staff and
students."
Among "more general consider
ations made by the committee"
was the suggestion that the
provost appoint a faculty member
to serve in the part-time position
of vice provost for faculty affirma
tive action affairs. "It is an appro
priate time for the University to
think creatively and boldly about
ways to achieve progress on affir
mative action and multicultural
affairs in general," the report said.
Finally, citing "the prolifera

tion of multicultural-related activ
ities and programming at Stan
ford," the report suggested three
"possible ways to facilitate plan
ning, coordination and promotion
of multicultural affairs."
The proposals include creating
a broad-based task force to discuss
integration of multicultural pro
gramming in the University; orga
nizing activities under a single
office, perhaps the Office of Multi
cultural Development "with a sub
stantial augmentation of staff and
redesign of its mission"; and invit
ing an external evaluating panel to
campus "to provide advice and

guidance."
Camarillo praised Casper for
"reiterating his commitment to
affirmative action and multicul
tural affairs, and more important
ly, attaching actions to that com
mitment."
He said he was especially
pleased with Casper's announce
ment that Provost Condoleezza
Rice will appoint a new vice
provost for faculty affirmative
action in accord with the commit
tee's recommendations. "That is a
particularly significant develop
ment for faculty affairs," Camaril
lo said.

Casper also announced yester
day that Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga will head an internal
search for a permanent director
for the office.
"I think President Casper cares
about using this institution appro
priately as a forum for intellectual
discourse ... this is one of the
actions he has tied to commit
ment," Camarillo said. "When you
have commitments that are just
statements, they don't resonate
unless there are actions which fol
low. These actions put the presi
dent in good stead on multicultur
alism."
