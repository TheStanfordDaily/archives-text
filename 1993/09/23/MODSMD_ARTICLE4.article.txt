# Multicultural office narrows focus

### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Following the recommendations of an ad
hoc advisory committee, the Office of Multicul
tural Development will re-focus its attention
on staff affairs, principally affirmative action
issues, University President Gerhard Casper
announced yesterday.
"Our goal remains a campus of truly 'inter
active pluralism,' and a vital tool in fulfilling
that goal is affirmative action," Casper said in
a statement.

In its recommendations, the Ad Hoc Com
mittee on the Office for Multicultural Develop
ment proposed finding other ways to promote
the broader multicultural affairs the office cur
rently handles.
The committee's report lamented the of
fice's shift in focus from a strictly affirmative
action-based organization to an agency with
broader functions within the community. In
1990, the report states, former director Sharon
Parker, "with all good intentions . . . began to
shift the goals of the office away from affirma
tive action per se to multicultural affairs in

volving more than staff."
One of the consequences was "a de-empha
sis of the mandated (affirmative action) re
porting functions for which the office has al
ways been responsible."
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences A 1
Camarillo, who chaired the committee, said
the members strived to return the office to its
"historic objectives," namely, staff affairs. The
office was called the Affirmative Action OfTice
through 1990.
