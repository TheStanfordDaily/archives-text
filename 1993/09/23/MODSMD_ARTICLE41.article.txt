# Playing it safe on the Farm
## From locking your door to peeking under your car, Stanford Police captain notes, you're better safe than sorry 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Lock your bike. Lock your door. Be aware of
strangers. Don't be afraid to call the police.
The advice is basic, but it is also good protection
against harm to you or your property. While Stanford
is certainly not the most dangerous place you could be
living, students here still fall prey to hundreds of
thefts and multiple assaults each year.
And according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, there are several simple steps students can
take to make their stay here a safer, happier one.
Bike theft rampant
The number one crime problem on the Stanford

campus is bike theft. In 1992, cam
pus police logged reports of 682
stolen bikes. As of last week,
Niemeyer said, 587 bikes had been
taken from campus in 1993, and
that will rise as bike thieves "have
a bumper crop in September and
October" when students return to
campus, Niemeyer said.
The recovery rate of bikes stolen
from campus, Niemeyer said, is
"virtually nil."

While Stanford is a bike thief s
oyster, you need not lose your pearl. Buying and using
a good, strong lock will make your bike much less like
ly to be stolen, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer recommended students buy a U-lock, and
make sure to insert the lock through both the frame of
the bike and its front tire before locking it to a station
ary object, such as a bike rack. Furthermore, Niemey
er recommended the use of "Bad Bones" or a similar
device that spans the arms of the U-lock. Such span
ning devices can make U-locks several times stronger,
he said.
Students should also make sure to register their
bikes with the police department so police can return
recovered bikes to their proper owners, Niemeyer said.
In addition to theft protection, students should be
sure they don't cause problems with the police by
improperly using their bikes, Niemeyer said. For
example, California law requires riders to use lights
when biking at night, he said.
Students should also be sure to follow traffic rules
— such as stopping at stop signs and riding on the
right side of the road — Niemeyer said. Bikers can ride
either on bike paths or on the road, he added. In years
past, Stanford police have issued tickets to students
who break bike traffic laws.
As one last measure of bike safety, Niemeyer urged
students to wear helmets when they ride.
"Those things are really saving a lot of noggins,"
Niemeyer said.
Lock a lot
Bikes aren't the only targets for thieves at The
Farm. Next in popularity, Niemeyer said, are comput
ers. So far in 1993 there have been 39 incidents of

computer theft at Stanford to the tune of $93,745, he
said.
More broadly, 178 cases of buiglaries to structures
or vehicles on campus were reported in the first seven
months of 1993, as well as 19 car thefts.
IxKking cars and rooms is a simple step students
can take to help stop these thefts, especially during the
moving process, Niemeyer said.
"A lot of thefts occur also when people are moving
in ... loading and unloading their vehicles," he said.
Students should also lock their dorm room doors
when they leave their rooms, even for a short period of
time, Niemeyer said. Some thieves know when stu
dents are likely to be away from their rooms with their
doors unlocked — during morning shower time or
mealtimes, for example — and go from room to room
until they find an unlocked door.
"Bingo! They're in there, they take valuables,
they're out," Niemeyer said.
Suspicious strangers
Students who stay on the lookout for suspicious
people doing suspicious things can be a big help in pre
venting robberies, Niemeyer said.
Reports of people sneaking around campus have led
to several important arrests, he said. Recently, a call to
the police about two youths looking at bikes on a bike
rack uncovered a major theft, Niemeyer said. When
Stanford police pulled over the car the suspects drove
off in, they discovered that one had a bolt cutter
strapped to the bottom of a skateboard, so he could
transport the tool and still look natural. (Unbe
knownst to the young man, skateboarding and
rollerblading are forbidden on much of Stanford's
land.) The youths, Niemeyer said, had stolen several
power tools from a hotel in Redwood City.
Sound strange? Not really, Niemeyer said. "This
kind of stuff happens all the time."
So students who see suspicious activity should call
the police, Niemeyer said. But what is suspicious?
Students should be on the lookout for other people
— especially groups of people — who don't fit the pro
file of Stanford students and possibly look much older
than students or adolescents, Niemeyer said. He esti
mated that between 70 and 80 percent of campus
crimes are committed not by students but by out
siders.
"What's not suspicious is you have a guy walk up to
a rack, get on a bike and ride away," Niemeyer said.
But if you spot someone who looks out of place lurk
ing in a hall or near a bike rack you should not be
afraid to call the police at 9-911, Niemeyer added.
"9-911 is not only for emergencies," Niemeyer said.
"It's for any time you want or need a police officer, or
you need medical or fire."
Assault prevention
Compared to theft, assault is not a major problem
on Stanford's campus. Police logged four aggravated
assaults and one forcible sex offense in 1992, and
recorded two aggravated assaults for the first seven
months of this year.
Assault is still a concern, however, and students can

act in ways that make them less attractive to potential
attackers. When going out, especially at night, stu
dents should try to travel in groups and through high
er-traffic and better-lighted areas of campus. If you
feel uncomfortable walking at night, Stanford has an
escort service called SURE Escort, that will transport
students in golf carts. You can reach SURE by calling
725-SURE.
Niemeyer also suggested carrying noise makers,
such as a whistle, and raising a ruckus if you think
you're in danger.
When traveling to a car or dorm at night, he sug
gested students have their keys in hand so they do not
have to linger outside hunting for their keys and pre
senting a target for criminals. Niemeyer also recom
mended that students check inside and under their
cars before they get in lest someone in wait.
Finally, students must be aware of sexual assault.
While reports of sexual assault are relatively rare, the
incidence of the crime is thought to be significantly
higher than reported.
At Stanford, most rapes are committed-by acquain
tances of the victims. A 1989 University study found
that 98 percent of women and 94 percent of men who

had been sexually assaulted at Stanford knew their
attackers.
To help prevent rape, all people involved in a sexu- ;
al situation need to be sure their partners consent to •
any sexual activity. Students should also know that •
using drugs — especially alcohol — can erase some- !
one's ability to consent to a sexual act.
If you have been sexually assaulted you should call \
the police and not shower or douche. You should also •
avciJ destroying or washing the clothes you had on •
when assaulted. Students can report an assault to the \
University without prosecuting the case. There are J
many services available locally to help people who have J
been sexually assaulted, including the Sexual Assault
Information and Resource Center located in Cowell
Student Health Center.
The most important goal of the police, Niemeyer
said, is for students to safely make their way through
their Stanford education so they can get the most out
of their school years. That, Niemeyer said, is what the
Stanford Police department is for.
"We're not here to bust anybody that doesn't need
busting," he said. "We're here to get you folks your ;
education and get you through here safely."

To help keep your bike safe from thieves, Stanford Police suggest using a strong U-lock with "Bad
Bones," and locking your bike through the frame and wheel to a stationary object, like this.
