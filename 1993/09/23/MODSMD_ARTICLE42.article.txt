# Exercise: Your campus options
## 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Having feasted on your first
couple of delectable Food Service
meals you may wonder how any
one could gain weight at college.
But statistics say many students
are prone to gaining the "Fresh
man 15."
Fear not, young Cardinal, for
the Farm offers plenty — from
foot trails to free weights — to
keep you fit.
A good pair of running shoes is
all that's required for a quick jog
or walk around campus, to Palo
Alto or up in the Foothills behind
campus. The Campus Drive loop
is approximately four miles and is
a good way to familiarize yourself
with Stanford's layout. The "fac
ulty ghetto" in the streets
branching off Mayfield Avenue
offers quiet roads and pleasant
residential views.
Beyond the "ghetto," to the
southwest, lie the Foothills, a
favorite destination for runners
and walkers alike. You may enter

the fenced area at three points
along Junipero Serra Boulevard:
near the intersection of Campus
Drive East, at the intersection of
Stanford Avenue or up a driveway
near the intersection of French
man's Road.
The main paved loop is slightly
more than three miles, but there
are plenty of dirt paths there as
well if you wish to lengthen or
shorten your trip. The Dish
(Stanford's large satellite dish)
and the Stanford Solar Observa
tory are located in the area, and
the hills are home to a variety of
wildlife including jackrabbits,
squirrels, moles, snakes, skunks,
foxes, birds and the occasional
tarantula.
Stanford's golf course — at the
intersection of Campus Drive
West and Junipero Serra — is
excellent not only for golfing but
also for jogging. Its lush rolling
hills provide respite from the hus
tle and bustle of central campus.
Mondays (when the course is
closed to golfers) are particularly
enjoyable, since you don't have to

dodge golf balls, golf carts and
golfers who have gone astray —
but watch out for the sprinklers.
Lake Lagunita — or Lakebed
Lagunita, depending on the sea
son — is another good place for a
stroll. The circumference is about
nine-tenths of a mile, and the
area is particularly enjoyable in
spring when the lake is full.
If biking is more your speed,
take a ride around Palo Alto for
starters. For ideas on longer
rides, a guide to local bike paths
and rides is available at the Book
store, or you can contact the
Stanford Cycling Club for ideas.
Oh, and don't forget your helmet.
For those who like to cruise on
more than two wheels, the cam
pus has some idyllic rollerblading
venues. For smooth cruising,
check out the pavement in front
of the Physics Tank on the west
side of campus, or try the Quad's
sandstone walkways (but beware
of pedestrians). Avoid the area
around the Clock Tower.

After a few weeks at Stanford, many freshman find their waistlines expanding along with their minds.
To shed these excess pounds, many students enjoy mountain biking on the various bike trails around
Stanford. But for those who prefer the indoors, there are always the Lifecycles at Encina Gym.
In-line skates can be rented
for about $10 at a number of
local stores such as Palo Alto
Sport Shop and Toy World (in
the Town and Country shopping
center). For a couple extra
bucks, you can protect yourself
with helmets, knee pads and
wrist guards. But be warned:
skating is frowned upon by cam
pus police.
If you prefer indoor exercise
(and you will, come January),
Stanford offers several facilities
to non-varsity athletes. In the
winter, the new DAPER sports
facility near Maples Pavilion will
open, equipped with a huge
weight room and basketball
courts.
For now, you can use the free
weights, weight machines and
exercise bicycles at Encina and
Roble Gyms. Stairmasters and
Lifecycles are located in the Ford
Center. Volleyball and basket
ball may be played in the adja
cent Burnham Pavilion.
Racquetball, handball and

squash courts and outdoor
swimming facilities are located
in the deGuerre complex
between the Tennis Stadium
and Sunken Diamond on the
northeast side of campus. Roble
Pool is also open fall quarter.
Tennis courts can be found at
the corner of Arguello Way and
Serra Street, in Escondido Vil
lage, and across from the golf
driving range near Governor's
Corner.
Intramural and club sports,
in addition to regular Athletics

Department activities, are a way
to build physical fitness into
your life. Classes and intramural
sports vary by quarter, and sign
ups are usually held the day
before classes begin each quar
ter.
If you've never seriously exer
cised before, or would like to
develop a structured exercise
program, contact a physician at
Cowell Student Health Center
for advice. Cowel-'s nutritionist
is also available by appointment.
