# Reaching out to the 'real world'
## Numerous public service programs at Haas Center 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
With the exception of some co-ops,
Stanford housing is fairly clean and liv
able. Everyone here has plenty of cloth
ing for both California sun and winter
showers. And complain as you might
about its quality, the abundance of food
is never questioned.
Stanford is not the real world.
For many students, life at the Univer
sity can become a "bubble," shielding
them from reality, said Timothy Stan
ton, the newly appointed director of the
Haas Center for Public Service.
The Haas Center offers hundreds of
ways for students to break out of the
campus bubble by becoming involved in
public service opportunities. Stanton
urges new students to "stay real" by
becoming involved in what the Haas Cen

ter has termed "service learning."
"Service learning is an integrating
force for students," he said. "It pulls
together issues that get them in the gut
as well being intellectually challenging."
Service learning stems from the idea
that when students perform public ser
vice, "they are inevitably going to be
learning and getting back a great deal,"
said Shellye McKinney, coordinator of
Haas' Public and Community Service
Opportunities Clearinghouse.
And often, Stanton said, service puts a
human face on academic interests. Stan
ton said he has seen many students dis
cover their life's work or combine seem
ingly diverse interests with the help of a
service project.
"A lot of students here find that ser
vice is more than just one more extracur-
ricular," Stanton said. "It can
provide a focus, a real motivating
force behind an academic interest.
When it becomes that it is really a
great boost of energy."
Stanton cited the Stanford in
Washington program as one
example of mixing academics and
service. The program gives juniors
and seniors the chance to take
classes, but also learn through
internships in government and
policy-making organizations.
For students eager to start

working in public service but
unsure how, Haas' clearinghouse
has catalogued numerous ways to
become involved in service on the
local, national and international
levels, McKinney said. Haas also
offers grants and fellowships to
students who wish to pursue pub
lic service projects.
The clearinghouse is open
weekdays 11 a.m.-5 p.m., and is
staffed by nine peer advisers
trained to answer questions and
steer you toward an ideal position.
Students can also use Odyssey, a
computer database which lists
over 600 opportunities, and can be
accessed 24 hours a day.
