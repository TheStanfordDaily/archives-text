# Shopping for more than just classes?
## Where to find the stuff you forgot to bring from home 
### John Hall Editorial staff 
An empty dorm room, a little cash,
and really ugly walls that you desperate
ly want to cover up — the opportunity for
self-expression approaches galactic pro
portions.
If you tend toward the minimalist
approach, forget it. Cinder block walls
and strange stains demand a large quan
tity of interior decor, at least until you
can draw into one of those new Manzani
ta dorms.
Good taste is apparently optional.
Good shopping, however, is not.
Here's a quick tour of the most bril
liant bargain places to hit in the Palo Alto
area, for everything from Stanford
sweatshirts to posters to U-locks.
Even without a car, you've got a few
good starting places. The centrally locat
ed, but sometimes expensive Stanford
Bookstore in White Plaza carries every
conceivable piece of Stanford-logoed
paraphernalia: the obligatory sweat
shirts and other clothing, mugs, pens,
rocking chairs, board games and post
cards. You can also pick up stationery,

school supplies and appointment books.
Microdisc, located on the lower level of
the Bookstore, has discounts on comput
ers, printers and software for registered
Stanford students.
During several weeks of the year, wall
posters of every size and subject are
available from vendors in front of the
Bookstore or Tresidder Union. Upstairs
in Tresidder, the ASSU Shirt Shak offers
low-cost student-produced T-shirts and
other clothing. Tresidder Express, down
stairs, can provide groceries, snacks,
aspirin, magazines and other small
items, though at rather steep prices. But
hey, it's open until midnight and is
ridiculously close to your dorm.
As an alternative to the Bookstore, the
obscure but often inexpensive Central
Stores, located at 330 Bonair Siding off
Campus Drive, offers good values on sta
tionery, computers, boxes and much
sought-after engineering supplies.
Safeway, just north of Stanford at 525
El Camino Real, is a standard suburban
grocery store with all the standard stuff.
More importantly, it's open 24 hours and
has a good selection of ice cream. The dis
tance is easily bikeable if you can't find a

car.
Just next door to Safeway is Pay Less
Drug, at 625 El Camino. Pay Less carries
some writing supplies, birthday cards,
lots of soap, hair spray, rubbing alcohql,
cotton balls and papaya-mango-seaweed
extract shampoo. They're open until -9
p.m. on Sunday and 10 p.m. on other
nights.
The premier destination within tlje
st ill-feel-corn fortable-dri ving-a-bor
rowed-car radius is Target (tar-ZHAY io
the sophisticated), located at 2485 El
Camino in Redwood City. To get theiie,
go out Palm Drive, hang a left onto El
Camino and just keep going. This low
budget consumer's Eden can do a lot to
chop away at your "to get" list, ofTeriug
toiletries, bath towels, potted plants,
clock-radios, lamps, CDs, clothes, U-locks
and snack food. Selection is less compre
hensive than at specialty stores, and
brand-name products are less common.
Final hint: the Stanford Shopping
Center was not exactly designed for the
cash-strapped student. Look around
and decide what you like. Then drop
not-too-subtle hints when Mom and
Dad come to visit.
