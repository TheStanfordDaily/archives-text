# Get used to rejection: Dates few and far between at Stanford
## A 						student discovers that Romeo and Juliet is just another paper topic 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Yes, people do date at Stan
ford.
In their dreams.
Why does this rumor persist?
Because Orientation issues of
The Daily always run a story
about it? No, the rumor persists
because it is true.
One old joke asserts that nine
of 10 women in California are
beautiful and the other goes to
Stanford. Another equally old
joke says that nine of 10 Califor
nia men are obnoxious, and they
all go to Stanford. With this kind
of animosity going around, it's
no wonder there's no dating.
Oh sure, some upperclassper
son will try to convince you that
they've gone out on dates here.
And, the poor souls, they actually
think they have gone out on dates.
But going to Flicks with
someone is not a date. Going
bowling with the dorm and shar
ing bowling balls with the most
attractive person in the dorm is
not a date either. Asking some
one to a wild night of studying in
Meyer or Green is definitely not
a date.
Jogging together is not a date.
Sharing the super-grimy joystick
of the "Teenage Mutant Super
Mario Bros." game at the Tresid
der game room is not a date,
unless you both wear pocket pro
tectors. Going to The City for a
wild night on the town is a date,

but the percentage of students
who actually leave this little bub
ble to go off campus is negligible.
Why is there such a dearth of
romance? It's called homework.
Extracurriculars. Staying in
shape. On the surface, we have
to look calm and collected, but
underneath the water our legs
are flailing like mad. We feel
guilty if we're not doing some
thing "productive."
However, even though most
students here are dateless, there
are a few who have to take up
the slack. One of these individu
als will undoubtedly be your
roommate.
The folks at Res Ed, who rel
ish their power to assign room
mates and ruin lives, will proba
bly pair you up with Mr. or Mrs.
Studmuffin Deluxe so the two of
you can "learn how to find com
mon ground."
Sure, a lot of people will come
by and visit your room, but it
won't be to see you. Then there
are the phone calls. You pick up
the phone. The voice says, "Oh
hi." (Long, awkward pause.) "Is
your roommate there?"
If you begin to bemoan your
sorry state, don't fret. My first
quarter at Stanford was a dis
festival.
During the first few weeks of
the quarter, I began to realize
that a blond dormmate of mine
— who had the enviable distinc
tion of being the only frosh from
North Dakota — was a goddess.

As we grew a little closer, I
eagerly overstepped my bound
aries and walked out on a limb: I
asked her if she wanted to get
something at the Coffee House.
Answer: "No, I've got a lot of
work to do tonight."
This is only the second week
of the quu.i iti, I thought. So I
interpreted this as a dis. Later,
however, I realized that intense
studying was her thing. She
studied all the time, it seemed.
So maybe it wasn't really a
dis? Oh, get real. It was.
Strike One.
Later, when my dorm pur
chased San Francisco Symphony
tickets, I decided that a pleasant
trip to The City - elegant dinner,
public transportation and all -
with another dormmate would
be just peachy. She was not easi
ly convinced of the good karma
of such an idea, though, and I
found myself groveling for a
date.
Eventually she agreed —
reluctantly — and I made plans.
And then I got dissed.
Cardenas, a
Mexican opposition leader, was
coming to campus the same
night as the concert. As soon as I
heard that news, I knew it'd only
be a matter of time before I
heard that knock on my door.
"Jeff, did you know that Car
denas is going to be here the
night of the concert?"
Oh well, at least the "other
man" for whom I was dumped

was a 60-year-old Mexican polit
ical figure and not my room
mate.
Strike Two.
A week or two later I rode
with a bunch of friends to Los
Angeles to see the Stanford-USC
football game. Another dorm
mate — let's call her "Zelda" —
and I shared the driving, and
part of that time the group
stayed at her house.
I was enjoying myself
immensely, and actually got the
impression that this might be
something undissable. There
was a spark, or at least some
static electricity.
After we returned to Stan
ford, she asked me what I was
doing for Thanksgiving. "Noth
ing," I replied eagerly. "Well,"
she said, "how would you like to
spend it with me and my family
in L.A.?"
Fireworks shot off in my
head. Zelda and I, alone, travel
ing to Los Angeles together, see
ing the sights (or whatever it is
you do in Los Angeles.) During
the next week I picked out china
patterns and names for our
future children.
Then she dropped the dis
bomb.
"Jeff, I don't think you're
going to be able to go with me for
Thanksgiving. I'd already asked
four other people and now the
car is full."
Strike Three.
Dude, yer out.

Come to Stanford for the weather, not the romance. Unfortunately,
dating on the Farm is as rare as rain.
