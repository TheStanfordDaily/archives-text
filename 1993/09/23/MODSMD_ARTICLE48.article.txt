# 'Town and gown': Stanford's link with local communities
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Stanford students often feel like
islanders, blissfully cut off from the
mainland of American life.
Sometimes, students will spend days
or weeks on end without crossing Cam
pus Drive, the concrete moat separating
the Farm from the city. Indeed, when the
campus has its own administration,
police and fire departments and medical
facilities, places to eat, sleep, bank, play,
study and exercise — even stores that
carry many of the supplies students need
to get by — Stanford can seem more like
a little city than a school.
The perception that the school stands
alone is deceptive. In fact, the University

contributes to the surrounding towns
and counties and interacts constantly
with local governments and residents in
myriad ways.
Stanford has more than 8,000 acres of
land holdings throughout Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties. In addition,
some Stanford lands have been annexed
to four local cities for revenue-generating
purposes. Palo Alto has annexed almost
1,200 acres and Menlo Park, Portola Val
ley and Woodside have each annexed
small amounts of land.
The value of this annexation in Palo
Alto is significant. The city is able to col
lect tax revenue on the land it has
annexed, which in Palo Alto's case
includes the Stanford Shopping Center.
In 1991-92, Stanford land within the

city of Palo Alto generated almost $30
million in sales, property and utility taxes
and utility income, according to figures
compiled by retired University Director
of Community Relations Andy Doty.
The sales tax generated by transac
tions that took place on Stanford's land
amounted to one quarter of Palo Alto's
sales tax revenue last year, said Betsy
Bartlett, marketing coordinator for the
shopping center.
Furthermore, Stanford students and
faculty bring a good deal of income into
the area, and Stanford provides many
local jobs. Employing an estimated
10,000 people, the University is the
largest employer in Palo Alto, said Susan
Frank, executive director of the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce.

Stanford students also boost the local
economy by renting property and visiting
businesses in Palo Alto and other areas.
Frank said Palo Alto stores "definitely
see a difference" in sales when students
are on campus, especially downtown
restaurants and bars.
"You're talking about another 10,000
or 12,000 people who wouldn't normally
be here," she said.
And Bartlett said stores in the shop
ping center "definitely see an upturn in
sales when they (the students) are com
ing back."
Of course, economic benefits go both
ways. Many students, for example, earn
money while at Stanford by working for
local businesses. Many of the jobs at the
mall, Bartlett said, go to students, and lie

vacant in the summer when students
leave campus.
But Stanford's link to the surrounding
counties and towns is more than finan
cial. In planning and administrating both
the University and local towns, work and
ideas are often shared.
Stanford's police, for example, are
funded by the University but derive their
law-enforcement power from being
sworn as Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies. Stanford's fire protection is
provided through a contract with Palo
Alto.
Stanford also works with Palo Alto
and other surrounding jurisdictions
when developing land. In April, for exam-
