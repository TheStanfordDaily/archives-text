# Sobering tips about drinking and drugs
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
It's Orientation week, and the
party's just begun. No parents, no
curfew — but wait, there are still a
few rules left, and the drinking age
is still 21.
Stanford has several specific
policies set forth by the adminis
tration regarding the use of alco
hol and drugs. The policies outline
rules for dormitories and fraterni
ties that hold parties where alco
hol is served. For example, dorm
funds in all-frosh dorms are not to
be used to purchase alcohol.
The policy generally encour
ages students to use caution with
controlled substances.
"People have to learn to be
responsible — that's the main
thing we try to teach here," said
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son.
The University attempts to
combat drug and alcohol-related
problems through rehabilitation,
education and, if necessary, disci
plinary action.
According to Jackson, offenses
related to alcohol and drugs can
lead to loss of housing, suspension
and even expulsion, depending
upon the specific circumstances.
Jackson added that students
should read the alcohol and drugs
policy, which is in each student's
orientation packet. And students

and residence staff should discuss
the information, he said.
Further discipline on alcohol
and drugs is provided by the cam
pus police. California laws clearly
prohibit the use of many drugs,
including the use of alcohol by any
one under 21 years old — and the
police intend to enforce the law,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
He warned that there has
recently been "a lot of concern
about the alcohol problem," and
he has scheduled meetings with
local judges and the district attor
ney about the issue.
Because alcohol use often
encourages or is related to other
crimes, Niemeyer said police want
to deter prohibited uses, including
underage drinking, public intoxi
cation and drunk driving, among
others. Niemeyer also warned that
he considers using fake IDs a seri
ous offense.
In addition to disciplining stu
dents for drug and alcohol infrac
tions, the University offers pro
grams to rehabilitate students
who have problems with alcohol or
drugs.
"There's a fairly typical spread
of difficulties throughout the stu
dent body regarding alcohol and
drug use," said Robert Matano,
director of the alcohol and drug
program at Stanford.
"We see a full range of prob

lems," he said. "Students have
actually died during the past few
years from alcohol-related acci
dents."
More commonly, students have
less serious problems with alcohol
that can hamper their academic
performance.
"There are more subtle forms
of difficulties," said Matano.
"Students who drink heavily over
the weekend may very well be
impaired cognitively during the
week and have difficulty taking
exams and paying attention in
class."

Though less pervasive, drug use
has also taken its toll on the Uni
versity. "We have seen students
that have had drug problems from
amphetamines to cocaine to mari
juana," said Matano.
The most important fact for
students to know, he said, is that
addictions can develop quickly.
"Students newly here can develop
problems rapidly — but we are
here if they need help."
Students seeking help for alco
hol and drug problems should
contact Cowell Student Health
Center.

Freshman fun or folly? While scenes like this aren't hard to find
on the Farm, Stanford's administration and police stress playing
it safe and obeying the law.
