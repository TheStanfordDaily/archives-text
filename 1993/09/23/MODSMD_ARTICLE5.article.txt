Stanford graduate Amy Biehl
became the first American victim
of South African township vio
lence when she was murdered this
summer by a mob of black youths
who mistook her for a native.
A 1989 graduate in internation
al relations, Biehl had been work
ing at University of the Western
Cape on a Fulbright Scholarship,
developing voter-education pro
grams for South Africa's first mul
tiracial elections and studying

women's issues.
"The irony is that she wasn't a
'settler' — she came to help the
transition to a democratic state —
and that she was on her way
home," said Mike McFaul, a friend
of Biehl's and a research associate

ut Stanford's Institute for Inter
national Studies. Biehl, a resident
of Newport Beach, California, was
scheduled to return to the United
States Aug. 27 and begin a doctor
al program in political science at
Rutgers University.
She was driving friends home to
the township of Guguletu Aug. 25,
when her car was stoned by a line
of people along the road. She was
then pulled out of the car, beaten
in the face with half of a brick, and
when she tried to flee, the mob re
peatedly stabbed her in the head.
The three passengers in the car
escaped, but passenger Singiswa
Bevu was stabbed in the right
hand after trying to help Biehl.
Bevu said the mob targeted Biehl
because they thought she was a
"settler," what radical black South
Africans often call white citizens.
The perpetrators shouted, "Set
tler, go home" as they killed her,
according to McFaul.
Two black youths have been ar
rested for the murder, and are
being tried in the country's
supreme court, the only court with
the power to impose the death
penalty.
Biehl's murder increased racial
tensions in South Africa and fur
ther strained relations between
the militant Pan African Congress
and the liberal African National
Congress. During the Sep. 13
hearing of the two youths, Pan
African Congress members
demonstrated and disrupted the
hearing. The next hearing is
scheduled for Sept. 27.
At Stanford, Biehl is remem
