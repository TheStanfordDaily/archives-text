### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Stanford graduate Amy Biehl
became the first American victim
of South African township vio
lence when she was murdered this
summer by a mob of black youths
who mistook her for a native.
A 1989 graduate in internation
al relations, Biehl had been work
ing at University of the Western
Cape on a Fulbright Scholarship,
developing voter-education pro
grams for South Africa's first mul
tiracial elections and studying

women's issues.
"The irony is that she wasn't a
'settler' — she came to help the
transition to a democratic state —
and that she was on her way
home," said Mike McFaul, a friend
of Biehl's and a research associate

ut Stanford's Institute for Inter
national Studies. Biehl, a resident
of Newport Beach, California, was
scheduled to return to the United
States Aug. 27 and begin a doctor
al program in political science at
Rutgers University.
She was driving friends home to
the township of Guguletu Aug. 25,
when her car was stoned by a line
of people along the road. She was
then pulled out of the car, beaten
in the face with half of a brick, and
when she tried to flee, the mob re
peatedly stabbed her in the head.
The three passengers in the car
escaped, but passenger Singiswa
Bevu was stabbed in the right
hand after trying to help Biehl.
Bevu said the mob targeted Biehl
because they thought she was a
"settler," what radical black South
Africans often call white citizens.
The perpetrators shouted, "Set
tler, go home" as they killed her,
according to McFaul.
Two black youths have been ar
rested for the murder, and are
being tried in the country's
supreme court, the only court with
the power to impose the death
penalty.
Biehl's murder increased racial
tensions in South Africa and fur
ther strained relations between
the militant Pan African Congress
and the liberal African National
Congress. During the Sep. 13
hearing of the two youths, Pan
African Congress members
demonstrated and disrupted the
hearing. The next hearing is
scheduled for Sept. 27.
At Stanford, Biehl is remem


Amy Biehl
bered as an enthusiastic and dedi
cated student. Her academic
interests centered on bringing
greater democracy to South
Africa. She wrote her undergrad
uate honors thesis about the Rea
gan administration's undersecre
tary of state for African affairs
and his role in the political elec
tions of Namibia.
"[She] was one of the most
spirited students in terms of
interacting with other students
[and] material she was studying,"
said Prof. Kennell Jackson, who
supervised her honors thesis.
"What I always was impressed
by," said McFaul," was that Amy
combined her academic interests
and her intellectual capacities
with a very activist approach to
dealing with the world. It wasn't
just sitting in the ivory tower. .. .
She wanted to both theorize about
and resolve these problems."
Head diving coach Richard
Shavone recalls Biehl as "probably
the most outstanding lady I've
ever coached." Biehl walked on to
the diving team freshman year and
worked her way up to becoming
team captain by her senior year.
In her honor, Biehl's family
has established a Stanford schol
arship fund to provide fellowships
in Africa for Stanford students
interested in the region. The fund
will also provide scholarship aid
for University of the Western
Cape students who wish to attend
Stanford.
Memorial services for Biehl
will be held October 7 in Memori
al Church.
