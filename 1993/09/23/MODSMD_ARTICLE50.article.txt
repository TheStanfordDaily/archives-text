# Filling your study list with the best classes
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Three quarters of CIV ... at
least one quarter of freshman
English . . . eight other distribu
tion requirements to fill ... a
major... .
And you haven't even finished
unpacking.
Yes, Stanford has what some
times seems like an overwhelm
ing number of required classes. A
student taking a normal load of
only courses that fulfill distribu
tion requirements could spend
about four quarters before he was
done. When you add the require
ments of a major on top of this —
which often adds at least a dozen
more classes — freshmen can feel
straitjacketed into a course of
study.
Beware. Students who spend
their whole academic career at
Stanford chasing credits simply
because they fulfill a major or
requirement can miss out on
some of the best academics Stan
ford has to offer.
Take some advice from the for
mer frosh, the students who have
already done this: stop and smell
the scholastic roses. You'll still
have time to take all your
required classes, and you'll broad
en your horizons and see how
truly great a great University can
be.

With that in mind, the follow
ing are some of the prize roses in
the garden of classes open to
Stanford freshmen:
• American Literature and
Culture to 1855 (American
Studies 150, 5 units). Not the eas
iest course at Stanford, but one of
the most interesting. Students
read many early American books,
but works of art, period furniture
and other cultural documents are
also used to look at our forefa
thers and mothers. The professor,
Jay Fliegelman, has dozens of fas
cinating, sometimes offbeat theo
ries. His lecture on chairs in early
America is solid gold.
• Introduction to American
Law (American Studies 179, 5
units). A guided tour through the
sometimes murky waters of the
American legal system, this
course has proven incredibly pop
ular. In the past, students have
had the opportunity to play out
their Perry Masonesque fan
tasies, reading and arguing case
law in class. Fulfills DR 9.
• The Question Course
(Center for Teaching and Learn
ing 116, 3 units). A class that
aims to teach students how to
think critically, evaluate argu
ments and ask probing questions.
Dennis Matthies teaches this
course out of the center, which is
dedicated to teaching students
how to learn and is located in
Sweet Hall.
• Environmental Science
and Technology (Civil Engi
neering 170, 3 units). A peren
nial favorite, despite its tradi
tional 8 a.m. starting time.
Professor Gil Masters lectures
on the environment, its deteri
oration and how to avert such
damage. As an added bonus,
this one fulfills DR 6.
• Improvisation (Drama
103, 3 units). A fun class.
Patricia Ryan leads her impro
visers through exercises teach
ing you how to act without a
script! A good class to teach
you how to think spontaneous
ly and non-linearly and, darn
it, a good time as well. Put a lit
tle liberal arts in your educa
tion.
• Elementary Economics
(Economics 1, 5 units). Two
words: Tim Taylor. Students
who have taken this "intro to
econ" course from the good
doctor have rated the experi
ence as one of their best at
Stanford. Check the time
schedule and try to catch the
class when Tim Taylor takes
the podium. Added value? Ful
fills DR 9.
