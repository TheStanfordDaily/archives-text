# Coming out during freshman year: Gays recount experiences
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Adjusting to life at Stanford
is a process laced with appre
hension for first-year students.
The process can be much less
certain for students who are
gay, lesbian, bisexual or ques
tioning, who have to address
issues of sexuality not often
accepted by mainstream culture
— or by their dorm mates.
Whether to stay closeted or
come out — and to whom — is a
major decision facing gay stu
dents at Stanford. But, despite
the apprehension, some upper
classmen say they have noticed
more first-year students are
coming out.
Senior Seth Boyd transferred
from Columbia University two
years ago because he felt Stan
ford had an easier environment
in which to come out.
"I transferred with the very
specific intention of maturing
in my identity as a gay man,"
Boyd said. As a closeted fresh
man, Boyd said he felt over
whelmed by Columbia's outspo
ken gay community.
"It seemed like almost all the
gay people at Columbia could
have been charter members of
ACT-UP," he said. "They were
very militant, very aggressive,
very political."
And while Boyd said he feels
that Stanford may not meet the
need for students seeking a
more diverse gay social scene,
he said it is a comfortable place
for someone taking the first
steps out of the closet.
Senior Jason Menayan said
that the presence of five out
upperclassmen in Ujamaa his
freshman year helped ease his
coming out process.
"I would suggest coming out
to another queer person," he
said. "Straight people, as sup
portive as they might seem,
sometimes just don't under
stand."

Junior Angela Young decided
to come out aflter an upperclass
man in Kimball came out.
Though she heard several resi
dents make openly homophobic
remarks, Young said the Bible
study meetings her roommate
held in their room caused her
the most unease during her
coming-out process.
"We had both grown up with
the church and gone through
the born-again experience, but I
was turning away from it and
getting more comfortable with
my sexuality," said Young.
She didn't recall specific
instances where homosexuality
was brought up but she said,
"Some of the things they were
saying were hitting really hard.
I thought, 'They have no idea
what they're talking about or
who they're talking to.' "
Although her roommate
didn't agree with homosexuali
ty, they stayed friends.
"She didn't support the
lifestyle but she supported me,"
Young said.
She said that, while the dorm
was not free of homophobic
remarks, being in a four-class
dorm "made a good space for me
to come out."
However, one of Young's
dormmates in Kimball, Lazaro
Cuevas, had several frustrating
experiences the previous year in
Soto, also a four-class residence.
"I never really got the feeling
of any gay awareness in the
dorm," Cuevas said. When the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Speak
ers' Bureau came to the dorm,
some residence staff members
severely questioned the pan
elists about whether a room
mate had the 'right' to know his
roommate is gay, Cuevas said.
When his attempts to come
out to his roommate and RA
were unsuccessful because of
miscommunication, Cuevas
said he became more with
drawn, finally opting for a "don't
tell, don't deny" approach.
"Even then, if I wasn't com
fortable with the person and they
asked, I would answer, 4 I don't
know,' " he said. "I still wanted to
cover up in case I had to retract
anything later — sort of like
smoking marijuana but not inhal
ing."
One upperclasswoman and
varsity athlete said overt, homo
phobic jokes made in her all
frosh, two-thirds male Wilbur

Hall dorm deterred her from com
ing out.
"I didn't really have any gay
positive experiences my freshman
year at all," she said.
"Not only was I a woman but I
wasn't straight. There was no
way I would have come out to
anyone because it was just so
male heterosexual," she said.
But not every all-frosh dorm is
predominantly homophobic.
Junior Aida Croal said her fresh
man dorm Paloma, which has a
history of several freshmen com
ing out each year, was "beyond
tolerant."
While Croal made no declara

tions of her sexual orientation,
she never tried to hide it, either.
"If I was going to a Queer Be-In
and someone asked what I was
doing I'd say, 'I'm going to the
Coffee House for the Queer Be-
In.' " The usual reaction was,
" 'Oh, Cool,' or 'I'll stop by,' " she
said.
"So that's how I came out to
people in the dorm. Then I think
people just ran with it, so it's not
like I had to tell everyone," she
continued. With an out, gay
Structured Liberal Education
tutor and several out dorm resi
dents, Croal said, "people had to
be thinking from the beginning."

in which to come out.
"I transferred with the very
specific intention of maturing
in my identity as a gay man,"
Boyd said. As a closeted fresh
man, Boyd said he felt over
whelmed by Columbia's outspo
ken gay community.
"It seemed like almost all the
gay people at Columbia could
have been charter members of
ACT-UP," he said. "They were
very militant, very aggressive,
very political."
And while Boyd said he feels
that Stanford may not meet the
need for students seeking a
more diverse gay social scene,
he said it is a comfortable place
for someone taking the first
steps out of the closet.
Senior Jason Menayan said
that the presence of five out
upperclassmen in Ujamaa his
freshman year helped ease his
coming out process.
"I would suggest coming out
to another queer person," he
said. "Straight people, as sup
portive as they might seem,
sometimes just don't under
stand."

Junior Angela Young decided
to come out aflter an upperclass
man in Kimball came out.
Though she heard several resi
dents make openly homophobic
remarks, Young said the Bible
study meetings her roommate
held in their room caused her
the most unease during her
coming-out process.
"We had both grown up with
the church and gone through
the born-again experience, but I
was turning away from it and
getting more comfortable with
my sexuality," said Young.
She didn't recall specific
instances where homosexuality
was brought up but she said,
"Some of the things they were
saying were hitting really hard.
I thought, 'They have no idea
what they're talking about or
who they're talking to.' "
Although her roommate
didn't agree with homosexuali
ty, they stayed friends.
"She didn't support the
lifestyle but she supported me,"
Young said.
She said that, while the dorm
was not free of homophobic
remarks, being in a four-class
dorm "made a good space for me
to come out."
However, one of Young's
dormmates in Kimball, Lazaro
Cuevas, had several frustrating
experiences the previous year in
Soto, also a four-class residence.
"I never really got the feeling
of any gay awareness in the
dorm," Cuevas said. When the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Speak
ers' Bureau came to the dorm,
some residence staff members
severely questioned the pan
elists about whether a room
mate had the 'right' to know his
roommate is gay, Cuevas said.
When his attempts to come
out to his roommate and RA
were unsuccessful because of
miscommunication, Cuevas
said he became more with
drawn, finally opting for a "don't
tell, don't deny" approach.
"Even then, if I wasn't com
fortable with the person and they
asked, I would answer, 4 I don't
know,' " he said. "I still wanted to
cover up in case I had to retract
anything later — sort of like
smoking marijuana but not inhal
ing."
One upperclasswoman and
varsity athlete said overt, homo
phobic jokes made in her all
frosh, two-thirds male Wilbur

Hall dorm deterred her from com
ing out.
"I didn't really have any gay
positive experiences my freshman
year at all," she said.
"Not only was I a woman but I
wasn't straight. There was no
way I would have come out to
anyone because it was just so
male heterosexual," she said.
But not every all-frosh dorm is
predominantly homophobic.
Junior Aida Croal said her fresh
man dorm Paloma, which has a
history of several freshmen com
ing out each year, was "beyond
tolerant."
While Croal made no declara

tions of her sexual orientation,
she never tried to hide it, either.
"If I was going to a Queer Be-In
and someone asked what I was
doing I'd say, 'I'm going to the
Coffee House for the Queer Be-
In.' " The usual reaction was,
" 'Oh, Cool,' or 'I'll stop by,' " she
said.
"So that's how I came out to
people in the dorm. Then I think
people just ran with it, so it's not
like I had to tell everyone," she
continued. With an out, gay
Structured Liberal Education
tutor and several out dorm resi
dents, Croal said, "people had to
be thinking from the beginning."
