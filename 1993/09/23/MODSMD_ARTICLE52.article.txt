# Campus traditions
## Partying nude and playing with fire are just part of a Stanford education 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
You're here, you got in, you
picked out some semi-attractive
yet reasonably priced bedding,
and you're getting the hang of
Stanford. Congratulations, you
made it. But now is not the time
to rest on your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes
here on campus, it's imperative
you make the most of a few fun
damental traditions — which will
soon become second-nature, like
clapping too fast and jumping at
just the right time when the Band
plays "All Right Now."
First things first. You'll soon
get one tradition under your belt
by way of the Orientation square
dance. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, you'll
look like a redneck. But get out
there and do-si-do your tiny little
heart out — it will be one of those
Hallmark memories of years to
come, unforgettable if only for the
fact that you actually put aside
your embarrassment and kept

your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on
the Quad, your one chance for
guilt-free tongue jousting with a
total stranger: you submit
because you're supposed to. In
order to become a Stanford man
or woman, according to legend, a
freshman must kiss a senior in
the Quad under the light of the
full moon. It's a little sleazier and
not quite as poetic as it sounds,
but be a good sport. Hopefully the
moon won't provide enough light
for anyone to recognize you later
and incriminate you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be
seen at Stanford's one regular
weekly social outing, Flicks.
These almost-up-to-date movie
offerings staged in Mem Aud are a
great opportunity to check out
male pattern baldness trends
among those in the orchestra
seats, as well as your one shot to
nail that prep school kid in your
CIV class during the pre-show
paper fight. Word has it that to

achieve the master nirvanic state
of true senior status one must
successfully float a paper airplane
from the balcony and hit the
movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a
less wholesome, frenzied rite as
the student body heads on down
to the resting place of our beloved
founders, Mom, Dad and little
Leland, and dances on their

graves. A little morbid and
ungrateful, perhaps, but the Mau
soleum provides a perfectly eerie
backdrop for the wickedness of
the holiday.
Once November rolls around,
all the cosmic energy on campus
focuses on one deliciously mali
cious goal: to beat Cal. Out comes

No one said becoming a woman was easy. Here one Stanford
student follows tradition at her own risk as two zealous men
pucker up at Full Moon on the Quad.
