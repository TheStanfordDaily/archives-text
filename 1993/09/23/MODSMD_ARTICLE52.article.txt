# Campus traditions
## Partying nude and playing with fire are just part of a Stanford education 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
You're here, you got in, you
picked out some semi-attractive
yet reasonably priced bedding,
and you're getting the hang of
Stanford. Congratulations, you
made it. But now is not the time
to rest on your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes
here on campus, it's imperative
you make the most of a few fun
damental traditions — which will
soon become second-nature, like
clapping too fast and jumping at
just the right time when the Band
plays "All Right Now."
First things first. You'll soon
get one tradition under your belt
by way of the Orientation square
dance. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, you'll
look like a redneck. But get out
there and do-si-do your tiny little
heart out — it will be one of those
Hallmark memories of years to
come, unforgettable if only for the
fact that you actually put aside
your embarrassment and kept

your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on
the Quad, your one chance for
guilt-free tongue jousting with a
total stranger: you submit
because you're supposed to. In
order to become a Stanford man
or woman, according to legend, a
freshman must kiss a senior in
the Quad under the light of the
full moon. It's a little sleazier and
not quite as poetic as it sounds,
but be a good sport. Hopefully the
moon won't provide enough light
for anyone to recognize you later
and incriminate you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be
seen at Stanford's one regular
weekly social outing, Flicks.
These almost-up-to-date movie
offerings staged in Mem Aud are a
great opportunity to check out
male pattern baldness trends
among those in the orchestra
seats, as well as your one shot to
nail that prep school kid in your
CIV class during the pre-show
paper fight. Word has it that to

achieve the master nirvanic state
of true senior status one must
successfully float a paper airplane
from the balcony and hit the
movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a
less wholesome, frenzied rite as
the student body heads on down
to the resting place of our beloved
founders, Mom, Dad and little
Leland, and dances on their

graves. A little morbid and
ungrateful, perhaps, but the Mau
soleum provides a perfectly eerie
backdrop for the wickedness of
the holiday.
Once November rolls around,
all the cosmic energy on campus
focuses on one deliciously mali
cious goal: to beat Cal. Out comes

No one said becoming a woman was easy. Here one Stanford
student follows tradition at her own risk as two zealous men
pucker up at Full Moon on the Quad.
the name calling (they're a bunch
of Weenies), the Axe wielding and
the most high-schoolesque display
of Stanford spirit you're gonna
get out of a group of semi-apa
thetic smart people.
Stanford has won Big Game for
the last five years, thus giving The
Farm long-standing possession of
the Axe — a hallowed article that
is zealously kept out of the hands
of Berkeley thieves by the Axe
Committee and awarded to the
winner of each Big Game.
Big Game week includes many
can't-miss-or-you're-lame events
such as the Big Game Bonfire,
where you get your eyebrows
singed 200 yards away from the
towering inferno built in Lake
Lag. You learn the Axe Cheer
(highlighted by such tricky and
complex lines as "Give 'em the
Axe" and "Right in the neck").
Gaieties, a student-written
comedy revue, takes the opportu
nity to playfully go for the Cal
jugular — as well as send the
more visible Stanford icons up in

flames — in a joking, pseudo-plot
filled musical. Hey, and when
they say "Branner sucks," they're
only teasing. Don't take it person
ally.
Big Game itself is the one time
you can do the "We Got In" cheer
without feeling like your ego's the
size of Montana. As the Band
dodges frozen oranges thrown
from the stands and the Axe Com
mittee protects their baby, the
players show Cal who's got Bill
Walsh on the field. And that elec
trical night, no matter what the
score, the campus erupts in snooz
ing, boredom-ridden silence as the
all-day tailgaters take their toll and
campus turns lame, lame, lame.
From there, Stanford takes a
turn for the worse as everybody
and anybody tries to reverse the
dateless trend that has crushed
the campus under its weight. As
fun as the whole blind date con
cept is in theory, in reality it
proves even more painful as
dorms throw Screw-Your-Room
mate parties each quarter.
Although you may not meet your
potential soulmate, it is a good
way to get back at your roommate
for their snooze button addiction.

More twisted, but no less sexu
ally frustrated is Exotic Erotic in
the spring. Trying to pretend they
haven't gotten out of shape yet,
students flock together in scantily
clad, shameless public ecstasy.
This is the one time all year peo
ple get to press their naked flesh
against the naked flesh of others,
reveling in semi-lust and ogling
the disappointingly small socked
penises and see-through bras of
their dormmates.
And when romantic frustra
tion doesn't outweigh academic
frustration, which usually lasts
for two weeks each quarter during
Dead and Finals weeks, another
tradition rears its ugly head. At
midnight, every night of Dead
Week, students cough their ton
sils out in the Primal Scream,
yelling out CFV reading frustra
tions and writer's-block woes.
These are just a few of the tra
ditions which give Stanford its
distinctly kicked-back yet amus
ingly offbeat atmosphere. No one
takes them very seriously now,
but you'll miss them all-too-soon
when you undergo that last tradi
tion — graduation — and become
a Geritol-popping alum.
