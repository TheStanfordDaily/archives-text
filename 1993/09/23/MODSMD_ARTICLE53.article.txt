# Where to get medical care at Stanford
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Editorial staff 
Colds, flu, sprained wrists â€” unfortu
nately, these common ailments don't disap
pear when you become a resident of the
seemingly Utopian Stanford community.
In fact, college life can often encourage ill
nesses because students overly stressed can
often neglect their health, said John Dor
man, a physician at Cowell Student Health
Center.
But don't panic. Students who get sick
can receive medical attention on campus at
either Cowell or the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, depending on the severity of their ail
ment.
Students should always go to Cowell
instead of the Medical Center unless there is
"a life-threatening problem," such as badly
broken bones, unconsciousness or excessive
bleeding, Dorman said.
Cowell, located at 606 Campus Drive
(across from Wilbur Field), is open weekdays
8:30 a.m.-5 p.m., with after-hours care 5-8
p.m. and on weekends 10:15 a.m.-6 p.m. A
Cowell doctor is on call at all times, Dorman

said.
All general services at Cowell are pre-paid
with students' tuitions; special services,
however, such as allergy shots, physical
therapy and physicals for health insurance
are not free.
When students go to the Medical Center,
their insurance company is billed. Stanford's
student insurance policy has a $200
deductible per policy year.
Prescriptions can be filled at the Cowell
pharmacy if they are from one of the eight
Cowell doctors or nurse practitioners. Pre
scriptions are competitively priced, Dorman
said.
Because Cowell serves a large student
population, patients may wait as long as an
hour to receive medical attention, said Julie
Ziert, who works at the front desk. Dorman
said waiting times vary, but warned that
Mondays are generally the busiest days.
"The best way to be seen at Cowell is by
appointment," he said.
Cowell also houses several medical ser
vices, including the Contraceptive Informa
tion Center, CPR/First Aid training, free and
anonymous HIV testing, nutritional services

and the Sexual Assault Information and
Resource Center.
In addition, Cowell offers specialty stu
dent-run clinics, like the Cold Clinic, the
Health Library, and the Peer Health Educa
tion program, a dorm-based informational
source.
Students also may speak with a Cowell
psychiatrist, social worker or psychologist
free of charge, although the number of visits
to one of these professionals is limited to five
per year.
Another resource for students seeking
counseling is the Bridge, a student-run peer
counseling organization "for people who
want to talk about anything," said peer
counselor Christopher Li, a junior.
The Bridge offers a 24-hour hotline and is
open for drop-in visits from 9 a.m. to mid
night. It is located at 640 Campus Drive,
next to the new Haas Center for Public Ser
vice.
Of course, the best advice for any situa
tion is not to get sick at all, said Dorman.
"Eat well, get enough exercise, get plenty of
sleep and don't overdo it. You know, exactly
what your mom would tell you."
