## High hopes after learning the ropes: the Class of '97 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
Never mind Stanford's four NCAA
team titles last year. Pay no heed to its
record-tying five titles the year before, or
even to the 19 medals Cardinal athletes
won at the 1992 Olympics.
The freshman Class of '97 threatens
to rewrite Stanford's already prolific ath
letic history in the course of starting a
dynasty of their own. With several
national-caliber and world-class pro
spects competing in red and white this
fall, Stanford has definitely secured its
place at the forefront of collegiate athlet
ics for years to come.
Here's just a sampling of new frosh
talent on the Farm this fall:

Amanda White
Freshman Amanda
White has accomplished
things that most colle
giate runners can only
dream about. After tak
ing second place in the
prestigious Kinney
Cross Country meet as a
junior, White crossed
the finish line as cham
pion last season, com-

pleting a dominating season in distance
running.
The eventual Maryland state champi
on in the cross-country, 800-meter, one

mile and two-mile races, White then pro
pelled herself onto the national scene
with an easy victory at the prestigious
Penn Relays. In running the 3,000
meters White recorded the second-fastest
time for high-school girls in 1993.
As if her running achievements were
not impressive enough, White is also a
national-caliber swimmer who will com
pete for the defending NCAA champion
Cardinal squad this spring.

Gregory Jimmerson
Just one of coach Vin
Lananna's top recruits
this season, Gregory
Jimmerson joins the
Stanford cross-country
squad as one of the
nation's most sought
after runners.
At the 1992 Kinney
Cross Country meet,
Jimmerson capped his

rj
senior year by crossing the line in second
place, beating out his future Cardinal
teammate, fellow freshman J.J. White,
who finished third.
The South Dakota native then fin
ished his season with the state titles in
both cross country and the two-mile run.
Before joining the Cardinal squad this
summer, Jimmerson ran away with the
Golden West Championship, putting him
in good shape to compete with the some
of the nation's top runners this season.

Colleen Miniuk
This second-team
high-school Ail-Ameri
can joins Stanford's
defending NCAA Cham
pionship women's vol
leyball squad after a
brief stint on the United
States Olympic Festival
team this summer. As
one of the nation's top
outside hitters, Colleen

Miniuk competed as the team's sole high
school representative.
Armed with a 30-inch vertical leap and
a devastating spike, Miniuk gained
national attention after a stellar senior
year, one which she capped off with the
Illinois Player of the Year title.
Since joining the Cardinal, Miniuk has
set her sights on competing for signifi
cant playing time with veteran hitters
Wendy Hromadka and Marnie Triefen
bach.
"Right now Colleen's our first outside
hitter off the bench, and I definitely see a
nuyor role for her this season," said
coach Don Shaw. "In our games so far,
she's come in for Wendy and Marnie, and
we're looking to interchange the three of
them at outside hitter later on."
Catherine Juillard
Also joining the defending NCAA
women's volleyball champions this fall
will be freshman walk-on Catherine Juil-

lard, who has captured
the attention of many
coaches and players as
the only non-recruited
member of this year's
team. Noted as a "pleas
ant surprise and a wel
come addition" on the
squad by coach Shaw,
Juillard will see some
playing time this season

as a setter and a back-row specialist.
"It's usually a tough transition from
high school to college, especially on a
team of this caliber," said Shaw. "But
Catherine is surprisingly skilled at adapt
ing to such a high level. She still has
things to learn, but she'll be contributing
to the team this year in spot positions."
Mat Foley

After graduating
seven seniors last year,
the men's soccer squad
will look to rebuild
around freshmen play
makers like Mat Foley
this season. Selected as
Gatorade's Minnesota
Player of the Year last
year, Foley looks to
strengthen the Cardinal

backfield at the stopper or defensive mid
field positions.
"Coming in as a freshman, I'm just

looking to start," said Foley. "But after a
while I'd like to become a leader and real
ly make an impact on this team. The ulti
mate goal, of course, is to win a national
title."
Foley, a member of the United States
Olympic Festival team this summer, has
already made a smooth transition into
the Cardinal lineup, but coach Colin Lin
dores insists that Foley must "find a
playing personality on the field" before
becoming a player for Stanford.

Brad Davies
A product of
Burnsville, Minn., Brad
Davies played alongside
of his teammate Foley in
high school before the
two friends captured
coach Lindores' atten
tion at a Florida soccer
tournament last spring.
An all-state and all-

conference selection his
senior year, Davies carries a "great deal
of natural talent" into the Cardinal back
field, according to Lindores.
"Brad is a very solid addition to our
team," Lindores said. "He understands
what areas he needs to improve in, and
he's a very coachable individual. I see
him being a big-time player for us before
he leaves here."







Susan Fishman
Coming off of
a recent appoint
ment to the U.S.
Junior Olympic
team, freshman
Susan Fishman
has already pro
ven herself as a
strong front-line
starter on the
Cardinal's young

field hockey team. Right-winger
Fishman carved her niche in
Stanford's talent-laden squad
by scoring the first goal of the
1993 campaign in their season
opener against Boston Universi
ty-
Nicknamed "Dash" by her
teammates, Fishman has the
speed and coordination to become
a dominant Division I player.
Karla Petersen
Hailing from nearby San Jose,

Karla Petersen
served as an
alternate on the
United States 18-
and-under
National Field
Hockey Team
this summer.
After garnering
All-League and
All -Cou nt y

awards her senior year, Petersen
has made a smooth transition from
being a top high-school defender to
being a nuyor contributor in the
Cardinal backfield.
"Karla has done a wonderful
job for us so far," said assistant
coach Stacy Gilburg. "The left
back marks the other team's right
wing, which is usually their best
offensive player, and Karla has
already stalled a lot of drives this
season."
Despite what she's already
accomplished, Gilburg is still
looking for Petersen to drastical
ly improve during the season. All
eyes are on her now, as Petersen
will become the nucleus of the
Cardinal backfield both this fall

and in the future
Brian WallLn
Following in
brothers Mark
and Chris' foot
steps, high sc
hool All-Ameri
can Brian be
comes the latest
Wallin to storm
onto Stanford's
water polo team.
The 6-4, 195-

pound center-forward will be the
only freshman on the Cardinal's
opening day roster, as Stanford
tries to break its second-place jinx
and finish as NCAA champions
this season.
Despite finishing second in
the nation for three consecutive
years, Stanford retains most of
its starting position players this
fall. As a result, Wallin will be
used primarily as junior Frank
Schneider's back-up and one of
the top players off the bench.
"I plan on playing him a lot,"
said coach Dante Dettamanti.
"But this year, we're really solid

through nine or 10 players, and
you only start seven guys. This is
the best talent we've assembled
since our 1986 Championship
year, and Brian will be a major
contributor to it."
Stacy Cook

Joining Stan
ford in its hunt
for the national
women's soccer
title this fall will
be high school
standout Stacy
Cook, who
recently received
an appointment
to the United

States Under-20 National Team.
Having proven her defensive
skills at various levels, including
playing for the national team,
Cook looks to be a stabilizing fac
tor in the Cardinal midfield. Five
games into the 1993 campaign,
Cook has already secured a start
ing position alongside three fresh
man teammates, giving Stanford a
young but powerful combination
of rookies and veterans.

Erin Martin
As Califor
nia's Soccer Pla
yer of the Year
and a member of
the Under-20
National Pool,
Erin Martin has
proven that she
can excel at all
levels.
Coming off of

a national record-setting 288-goal
performance during her high
school career, Martin has since
made the transition to being one of
the Cardinal's dominant forwards
this season.
"Erin has a tremendous repu
tation for scoring goals," said
interim coach lan Sawyers.
"She's proven that she can score
at every level, because she's skill
ful around the ball and not afraid
to get back into goal-scoring posi
tion after missing the first time.
"Overall, she's a very confi
dent player, and we'll be look
ing to her for goals and to take
the pressure off of Sarah
Rafanelli."

of the nation's top runners this season.

Colleen Miniuk
This second-team
high-school Ail-Ameri
can joins Stanford's
defending NCAA Cham
pionship women's vol
leyball squad after a
brief stint on the United
States Olympic Festival
team this summer. As
one of the nation's top
outside hitters, Colleen

Miniuk competed as the team's sole high
school representative.
Armed with a 30-inch vertical leap and
a devastating spike, Miniuk gained
national attention after a stellar senior
year, one which she capped off with the
Illinois Player of the Year title.
Since joining the Cardinal, Miniuk has
set her sights on competing for signifi
cant playing time with veteran hitters
Wendy Hromadka and Marnie Triefen
bach.
"Right now Colleen's our first outside
hitter off the bench, and I definitely see a
nuyor role for her this season," said
coach Don Shaw. "In our games so far,
she's come in for Wendy and Marnie, and
we're looking to interchange the three of
them at outside hitter later on."
Catherine Juillard
Also joining the defending NCAA
women's volleyball champions this fall
will be freshman walk-on Catherine Juil-

lard, who has captured
the attention of many
coaches and players as
the only non-recruited
member of this year's
team. Noted as a "pleas
ant surprise and a wel
come addition" on the
squad by coach Shaw,
Juillard will see some
playing time this season

as a setter and a back-row specialist.
"It's usually a tough transition from
high school to college, especially on a
team of this caliber," said Shaw. "But
Catherine is surprisingly skilled at adapt
ing to such a high level. She still has
things to learn, but she'll be contributing
to the team this year in spot positions."
Mat Foley

After graduating
seven seniors last year,
the men's soccer squad
will look to rebuild
around freshmen play
makers like Mat Foley
this season. Selected as
Gatorade's Minnesota
Player of the Year last
year, Foley looks to
strengthen the Cardinal

backfield at the stopper or defensive mid
field positions.
"Coming in as a freshman, I'm just

looking to start," said Foley. "But after a
while I'd like to become a leader and real
ly make an impact on this team. The ulti
mate goal, of course, is to win a national
title."
Foley, a member of the United States
Olympic Festival team this summer, has
already made a smooth transition into
the Cardinal lineup, but coach Colin Lin
dores insists that Foley must "find a
playing personality on the field" before
becoming a player for Stanford.

Brad Davies
A product of
Burnsville, Minn., Brad
Davies played alongside
of his teammate Foley in
high school before the
two friends captured
coach Lindores' atten
tion at a Florida soccer
tournament last spring.
An all-state and all-

conference selection his
senior year, Davies carries a "great deal
of natural talent" into the Cardinal back
field, according to Lindores.
"Brad is a very solid addition to our
team," Lindores said. "He understands
what areas he needs to improve in, and
he's a very coachable individual. I see
him being a big-time player for us before
he leaves here."







Susan Fishman
Coming off of
a recent appoint
ment to the U.S.
Junior Olympic
team, freshman
Susan Fishman
has already pro
ven herself as a
strong front-line
starter on the
Cardinal's young

field hockey team. Right-winger
Fishman carved her niche in
Stanford's talent-laden squad
by scoring the first goal of the
1993 campaign in their season
opener against Boston Universi
ty-
Nicknamed "Dash" by her
teammates, Fishman has the
speed and coordination to become
a dominant Division I player.
Karla Petersen
Hailing from nearby San Jose,

Karla Petersen
served as an
alternate on the
United States 18-
and-under
National Field
Hockey Team
this summer.
After garnering
All-League and
All -Cou nt y

awards her senior year, Petersen
has made a smooth transition from
being a top high-school defender to
being a nuyor contributor in the
Cardinal backfield.
"Karla has done a wonderful
job for us so far," said assistant
coach Stacy Gilburg. "The left
back marks the other team's right
wing, which is usually their best
offensive player, and Karla has
already stalled a lot of drives this
season."
Despite what she's already
accomplished, Gilburg is still
looking for Petersen to drastical
ly improve during the season. All
eyes are on her now, as Petersen
will become the nucleus of the
Cardinal backfield both this fall

and in the future
Brian WallLn
Following in
brothers Mark
and Chris' foot
steps, high sc
hool All-Ameri
can Brian be
comes the latest
Wallin to storm
onto Stanford's
water polo team.
The 6-4, 195-

pound center-forward will be the
only freshman on the Cardinal's
opening day roster, as Stanford
tries to break its second-place jinx
and finish as NCAA champions
this season.
Despite finishing second in
the nation for three consecutive
years, Stanford retains most of
its starting position players this
fall. As a result, Wallin will be
used primarily as junior Frank
Schneider's back-up and one of
the top players off the bench.
"I plan on playing him a lot,"
said coach Dante Dettamanti.
"But this year, we're really solid

through nine or 10 players, and
you only start seven guys. This is
the best talent we've assembled
since our 1986 Championship
year, and Brian will be a major
contributor to it."
Stacy Cook

Joining Stan
ford in its hunt
for the national
women's soccer
title this fall will
be high school
standout Stacy
Cook, who
recently received
an appointment
to the United

States Under-20 National Team.
Having proven her defensive
skills at various levels, including
playing for the national team,
Cook looks to be a stabilizing fac
tor in the Cardinal midfield. Five
games into the 1993 campaign,
Cook has already secured a start
ing position alongside three fresh
man teammates, giving Stanford a
young but powerful combination
of rookies and veterans.

Erin Martin
As Califor
nia's Soccer Pla
yer of the Year
and a member of
the Under-20
National Pool,
Erin Martin has
proven that she
can excel at all
levels.
Coming off of

a national record-setting 288-goal
performance during her high
school career, Martin has since
made the transition to being one of
the Cardinal's dominant forwards
this season.
"Erin has a tremendous repu
tation for scoring goals," said
interim coach lan Sawyers.
"She's proven that she can score
at every level, because she's skill
ful around the ball and not afraid
to get back into goal-scoring posi
tion after missing the first time.
"Overall, she's a very confi
dent player, and we'll be look
ing to her for goals and to take
the pressure off of Sarah
Rafanelli."





Never mind Stanford's four NCAA
team titles last year. Pay no heed to its
record-tying five titles the year before, or
even to the 19 medals Cardinal athletes
won at the 1992 Olympics.
The freshman Class of '97 threatens
to rewrite Stanford's already prolific ath
letic history in the course of starting a
dynasty of their own. With several
national-caliber and world-class pro
spects competing in red and white this
fall, Stanford has definitely secured its
place at the forefront of collegiate athlet
ics for years to come.
Here's just a sampling of new frosh
talent on the Farm this fall:

Amanda White
Freshman Amanda
White has accomplished
things that most colle
giate runners can only
dream about. After tak
ing second place in the
prestigious Kinney
Cross Country meet as a
junior, White crossed
the finish line as cham
pion last season, com-

pleting a dominating season in distance
running.
The eventual Maryland state champi
on in the cross-country, 800-meter, one

mile and two-mile races, White then pro
pelled herself onto the national scene
with an easy victory at the prestigious
Penn Relays. In running the 3,000
meters White recorded the second-fastest
time for high-school girls in 1993.
As if her running achievements were
not impressive enough, White is also a
national-caliber swimmer who will com
pete for the defending NCAA champion
Cardinal squad this spring.

Gregory Jimmerson
Just one of coach Vin
Lananna's top recruits
this season, Gregory
Jimmerson joins the
Stanford cross-country
squad as one of the
nation's most sought
after runners.
At the 1992 Kinney
Cross Country meet,
Jimmerson capped his

rj
senior year by crossing the line in second
place, beating out his future Cardinal
teammate, fellow freshman J.J. White,
who finished third.
The South Dakota native then fin
ished his season with the state titles in
both cross country and the two-mile run.
Before joining the Cardinal squad this

Golden West Championship, putting him
in good shape to compete with the some
of the nation's top runners this season.

looking to start," said Foley. "But after a
while I'd like to become a leader and real
ly make an impact on this team. The ulti
mate goal, of course, is to win a national
title."
Foley, a member of the United States
Olympic Festival team this summer, has
already made a smooth transition into
the Cardinal lineup, but coach Colin Lin
dores insists that Foley must "find a
playing personality on the field" before
becoming a player for Stanford.

Brad Davies
A product of
Burnsville, Minn., Brad
Davies played alongside
of his teammate Foley in
high school before the
two friends captured
coach Lindores' atten
tion at a Florida soccer
tournament last spring.
An all-state and all-

conference selection his
senior year, Davies carries a "great deal
of natural talent" into the Cardinal back
field, according to Lindores.
"Brad is a very solid addition to our
team," Lindores said. "He understands
what areas he needs to improve in, and
he's a very coachable individual. I see
him being a big-time player for us before
he leaves here."







Susan Fishman
Coming off of
a recent appoint
ment to the U.S.
Junior Olympic
team, freshman
Susan Fishman
has already pro
ven herself as a
strong front-line
starter on the
Cardinal's young

field hockey team. Right-winger
Fishman carved her niche in
Stanford's talent-laden squad
by scoring the first goal of the
1993 campaign in their season
opener against Boston Universi
ty-
Nicknamed "Dash" by her
teammates, Fishman has the
speed and coordination to become
a dominant Division I player.
Karla Petersen
Hailing from nearby San Jose,

Karla Petersen
served as an
alternate on the
United States 18-
and-under
National Field
Hockey Team
this summer.
After garnering
All-League and
All -Cou nt y

awards her senior year, Petersen
has made a smooth transition from
being a top high-school defender to
being a nuyor contributor in the
Cardinal backfield.
"Karla has done a wonderful
job for us so far," said assistant
coach Stacy Gilburg. "The left
back marks the other team's right
wing, which is usually their best
offensive player, and Karla has
already stalled a lot of drives this
season."
Despite what she's already
accomplished, Gilburg is still
looking for Petersen to drastical
ly improve during the season. All
eyes are on her now, as Petersen
will become the nucleus of the
Cardinal backfield both this fall

and in the future
Brian WallLn
Following in
brothers Mark
and Chris' foot
steps, high sc
hool All-Ameri
can Brian be
comes the latest
Wallin to storm
onto Stanford's
water polo team.
The 6-4, 195-

pound center-forward will be the
only freshman on the Cardinal's
opening day roster, as Stanford
tries to break its second-place jinx
and finish as NCAA champions
this season.
Despite finishing second in
the nation for three consecutive
years, Stanford retains most of
its starting position players this
fall. As a result, Wallin will be
used primarily as junior Frank
Schneider's back-up and one of
the top players off the bench.
"I plan on playing him a lot,"
said coach Dante Dettamanti.
"But this year, we're really solid

through nine or 10 players, and
you only start seven guys. This is
the best talent we've assembled
since our 1986 Championship
year, and Brian will be a major
contributor to it."
Stacy Cook

Joining Stan
ford in its hunt
for the national
women's soccer
title this fall will
be high school
standout Stacy
Cook, who
recently received
an appointment
to the United

States Under-20 National Team.
Having proven her defensive
skills at various levels, including
playing for the national team,
Cook looks to be a stabilizing fac
tor in the Cardinal midfield. Five
games into the 1993 campaign,
Cook has already secured a start
ing position alongside three fresh
man teammates, giving Stanford a
young but powerful combination
of rookies and veterans.

Erin Martin
As Califor
nia's Soccer Pla
yer of the Year
and a member of
the Under-20
National Pool,
Erin Martin has
proven that she
can excel at all
levels.
Coming off of

a national record-setting 288-goal
performance during her high
school career, Martin has since
made the transition to being one of
the Cardinal's dominant forwards
this season.
"Erin has a tremendous repu
tation for scoring goals," said
interim coach lan Sawyers.
"She's proven that she can score
at every level, because she's skill
ful around the ball and not afraid
to get back into goal-scoring posi
tion after missing the first time.
"Overall, she's a very confi
dent player, and we'll be look
ing to her for goals and to take
the pressure off of Sarah
Rafanelli."
