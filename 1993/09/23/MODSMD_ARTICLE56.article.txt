# Stanford soars over Buffaloes with aerial attack

### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With eight seconds remaining, quarterback Steve
Stenstrom hit tight end Tony Cline with a five-yard
touchdown pass, lifting Stanford to an improbable 41-
37 victory over Colorado at Stanford Stadium Saturday
night.
The 17th-ranked Cardinal (2-1) rallied from a 10-
point fourth-quarter deficit with two touchdown drives
in the final five minutes of the contest to defeat the
then-No. 7 Buffaloes (2-1).
"We needed to win, to beat a big-time team like
this," Stenstrom said. "We needed some momentum.
We still haven't played our best game yet, but we did
show everybody around the country what we're made
of."
After the two teams traded scoring drives through
out the first half, Colorado turned to a ball-control
attack in the third quarter, forcing the young Cardinal
defense to spend an inordinate amount of time on the
field, while making the Stanford offense mere specta
tors to the Buffaloes' ground game.
Colorado recorded two consecutive touchdowns on
long drives that consumed 9:43 off the game clock.
Quarterback Kordell Stewart continually frustrated
the Stanford defense, using the quarterback option
repeatedly to march the Buffaloes 80 yards on the first
drive. Then, after forcing Stanford to punt, Colorado
went on the attack again.
Led by tailback Rashaan Salaam, Colorado traveled
84 yards in 15 plays, repeatedly bruising through the
middle of the Cardinal iinebacking corps for short
gains. Stewart capped the drive with a four-yard keep
er to give the Buffaloes a 37-27 lead with 12:41 left in
the game. However, kicker Mitch Berger missed the
point-after attempt.
Colorado then stopped the Stanford offense once
again, and on the next series had the chance to put the
game out of reach. But with fourth-and-one at their
own 46-yard line with just over five minutes left, Buf
falo coach Bill McCartney elected to punt rather than
try for the first down. This decision surprised many, as
both Salaam (114 yards) and tailback Lamont Warren
(109 yards) were producing consistently all evening.
"We're not playing defense," Stanford head coach
Bill Walsh said. "Let's face that. We're one of the poor
est teams in the country defensively. We've been fortu
nate the last two weeks to stop the opposition on the
last drive or two and win."
Stanford made the most of McCartney's decision.
Starting from its own 33-yard line, the Cardinal record
ed two quick first downs on short passing plays. Then,
on a broken play, a scrambling Stenstrom (30-42, 382

yards, 5 touchdowns) found Colorado native Justin
Armour for a 38-yard touchdown pass down the right
sideline to cut the Buffaloes' lead to three.
"My initial route was just a post," Armour said. "I
saw Steve scrambling out right and I saw tw6 guys
coming forward, so I just stuttered for a minute and
then I took off on a deep angle for the end zone, because
Steve and I talked about that for a scramble drill. He
had the same idea I did, and just laid it up perfectly."
The Stanford defense stopped Colorado on three
plays during the next series. On fourth down, Berger
shanked a 27-yard punt, giving the Cardinal the ball at
the Colorado 46-yard line with 2:32 remaining.
Fullback Ethan Allen began the game-winning drive
with a 19-yard run around the right end. After tailback
Ellery Roberts picked up 15 yards on a screen pass,
Stenstrom found Armour for 13 yards, setting up flrst
and-goal on the seven-yard line. Roberts went up the
middle for two yards on first down, and Stenstrom
threw incomplete on the next play.
On third-and-five, Stenstrom fired over the middle
to Cline, who was immediately rocked by Colorado free
safety Dwayne Davis. Cline held the ball for a brief
instant before falling in the end zone. After an officials'
conference, the play was ruled a touchdown.
"It's hard to recollect what happened because I got
hit so hard," Cline said. "I believe I caught it, my feet
hit, then I got hit real hard and lost the ball. They called
it a touchdown, so it was a touchdown."
"The kids feel like he didn't have the ball long
enough," McCartney said. "I don't know."
As a team, Stanford did not have the ball — or any
thing else — for long enough in the season opener
against Washington in Seattle. Many preseason prog
nosticators felt the game would determine the Pacific
10 Conference's Rose Bowl representative. However,
the Pac-10's imposition of sanctions upon the Wash
ington program deprived the game of any such impor
tance. Those sanctions included a two-year Rose Bowl
probation and prompted head coach Don James to
resign. The Huskies needed something upon which to
vent their anger and the Cardinal provided a conve
nient outlet.
Washington dominated the game from start to fin
ish. Tailback Napoleon Kaufman racked up 195 yards
rushing in leading the Huskies to a 31-14 victory.
Meanwhile, the Husky defense sacked Stenstrom six
times and intercepted him twice.
Stanford fared better the next week, defeating
South Bay rival San Jose State, 31-28, to record its first
win of the 1993 football season. Stenstrom completed
30 of 39 passes for 330 yards and four touchdowns, and
