# Cardinal coaches please the palate, serve four crowns
## 
### M. Scott Walker Staff writer 
A pinch of this, a touch of
that; cooking can be an inexact
science. You never know how
your creation will turn out —
until you take a bite. But for
Stanford athletes in the last aca
demic year, competition had a
very sweet taste to it.
Don Shaw, Richard Quick,
Skip Kenney and Sadao Hamada
all used different recipes, yet had
the same results — these Cardi
nal coaches all cooked up cham
pionships.
The facts are simple: Stanford
came away with four NCAA team
championships last year and 21
individual championships, both
more than any other school in
the nation. Titles in women's
volleyball, men's and women's
swimming and men's gymnastics
gave Stanford an unprecedented
nine national championships in
two years.
The first serving came on the
night of Dec. 19, when the
women's volleyball team van
quished UCLA in what was pos
sibly Stanford's most delicious
triumph.
Stanford barbecued the Bru
ins at the Pit in Albuquerque,
netting the squad's first NCAA
title.
UCLA came into the match
heralded as the best collegiate
squad ever assembled in the
sport.
Furthermore, they defeated
the Cardinal twice during the
regular season. But those two
defeats set up a David-and-
Goliath scenario, as UCLA was
burdened with media attention,
great expectations and unbeliev
able pressure. The heat was
clearly on the Bruins.
"As much as I hate to lose, I
was almost glad when we didn't
win that match [Stanford's first
loss to UCLAI, because it helped
keep that scenario in place. We
could kind of see we were going
to need that pressure on them,
all the attention on them," said
coach Shaw.
And while UCLA felt pres
sured, Stanford felt confident.
"We lost [the first match] in five,
but we expected to get killed,"

said current senior Heidi Eick. "I
remember Bev [Oden] saying
something like 'Gosh, is this as
good as they are? If this is it,
then we definitely have it in
us.' "
The Cardinal certainly had
the talent necessary for success.
Four-time Ail-American Bev
Oden was the leader of the
squad. Carrie Feldman was a
first-team All-Pac-10 selection,
along with Cary Wendell. Wen
dell was also named National
Freshman of the Year.
Talent wasn't the only ingre
dient in their national title mix.
"Chemistry is really impor
tant. People understanding their
roles, going out there and trust
ing that everyone is going hard
— I think that's really an impor
tant part of it," said Shaw. "Peo
ple don't realize how hard it is,
and how lucky you have to be for
everything to fit into place, and
(for) things to go your way to
win a national championship.
You can be very very good, but
the best team doesn't always
win."
Unless the sport in question is
women's swimming and diving.
Coach Quick's squad won its sec
ond-consecutive title in grand
fashion March 20, setting an
NCAA Championships record for
the largest margin of victory
while outpacing No. 2 Florida,
649.5-421.0.
The victory capped a perfect
season for the Cardinal, during
which they went unbeaten in
eight dual meets.
A heaping helping of prepara
tion was the main ingredient in
this championship.
"It's easier than I expected,"
said Jenny Thompson, who gar
nered two individual titles. "I
thought the other teams weren't
as mentally and physically pre
pared as us."
The squad was ranked second
to Florida much of the season.
But, while Florida had the top
ranking, the Cardinal possessed
the individual standout perform
ers necessary to effect such a
decisive win in the Minneapolis
held championships.
Thompson won national
championships in the 50-and
100-meter freestyles, while cap
tain Janel Jorgensen closed out
her Stanford career with victo
ries in the 100 and 200 fly.
Senior Lea Loveless glided her
way to backstroke victories at
100-and 200-meters, and sopho
more Lisa Jacob broke through
to win the 500 free.
Meanwhile, Stanford's lone
competing diver, Eileen Richetel
li, won NCAA Diver of the Year
honors by taking the three-meter

springboard and platform events,
giving Stanford nine total indi
vidual titles.
Next week in Indianapolis, the
men's swimming and diving
team followed the women's lead
by defeating runner-up Michigan
by a whopping 124.5 points.
Their 520.5 total points rein
forced Stanford's reign as
national champions and con
firmed deGuerre Pool's reputa
tion as the unofficial "Swimming
Capital of the World."
At first glance, swimrmng
seems to be, primarily, an indi
vidual sport.
But it was teamwork that led
the men to their second consecu
tive NCAA title. A plethora of
second-and third-place finiMhes
racked up the points necessary
for victory.
"There's no one guy on this
team who has to be a superstar
and carry the load," said coach
Kinney in the aftermath of their
title. Derek VVeatherford, Tyler
Mayfield and Ray Carey did win
individual national titles, but it
was clearly a team effort.
Sadao Hamada may have had
the most intriguing recipe for a
championship.
Take the same ingredients as
last year, throw in a slew of
injuries and then turn up the
heat slowly but powerfully on
your squad. Serve at the NCAA
Championships.
It came out perfectly.

On April 17, on the same floor
which produced women's volley
ball's first title, men's gymnas
tics defended its title against
Nebraska, last year's runner-up.
And, as they did in the previous
year, they peaked at perfect time.
Stanford performed high-risk
routines in the preliminaries,
which produced 12 falls during
the competition.
The Cardinal finished third,
barely placing them in the finals.
But once in the finals, Stanford's
high-risk preparation paid off,
culminating in a heart-stopping
276.5-275.5 triumph.
All of this was accomplished
despite numerous injuries dur
ing the season, including a
severely broken ankle to junior
Jing-Wei Liang.
But the biggest loss was co
captain Mark Booth, who was
injured in the NCAA Western
Regionals and did not compete in
the NCAA Championships. Chris
Sey and Andrew Manson filled in
admirably, and the Cardinal
returned to the Farm victorious.
The glory of these champi
onships is now transformed into
the hope which marks the
upcoming year.
But 1992-93 was another
shining season for Stanford, one
in which all the cardinal ingredi
ents — teammork, dedication,
and talent — blended into a
savory dish.
How sweet it is.

first-team All-Pac-10 selection,
along with Cary Wendell. Wen
dell was also named National
Freshman of the Year.
Talent wasn't the only ingre
dient in their national title mix.
"Chemistry is really impor
tant. People understanding their
roles, going out there and trust
ing that everyone is going hard
— I think that's really an impor
tant part of it," said Shaw. "Peo
ple don't realize how hard it is,
and how lucky you have to be for
everything to fit into place, and
(for) things to go your way to
win a national championship.
You can be very very good, but
the best team doesn't always
win."
Unless the sport in question is
women's swimming and diving.
Coach Quick's squad won its sec
ond-consecutive title in grand
fashion March 20, setting an
NCAA Championships record for
the largest margin of victory
while outpacing No. 2 Florida,
649.5-421.0.
The victory capped a perfect
season for the Cardinal, during
which they went unbeaten in
eight dual meets.
A heaping helping of prepara
tion was the main ingredient in
this championship.
"It's easier than I expected,"
said Jenny Thompson, who gar
nered two individual titles. "I
thought the other teams weren't
as mentally and physically pre
pared as us."
The squad was ranked second
to Florida much of the season.
But, while Florida had the top
ranking, the Cardinal possessed
the individual standout perform
ers necessary to effect such a
decisive win in the Minneapolis
held championships.
Thompson won national
championships in the 50-and
100-meter freestyles, while cap
tain Janel Jorgensen closed out
her Stanford career with victo
ries in the 100 and 200 fly.
Senior Lea Loveless glided her
way to backstroke victories at
100-and 200-meters, and sopho
more Lisa Jacob broke through
to win the 500 free.
Meanwhile, Stanford's lone
competing diver, Eileen Richetel
li, won NCAA Diver of the Year
honors by taking the three-meter

springboard and platform events,
giving Stanford nine total indi
vidual titles.
Next week in Indianapolis, the
men's swimming and diving
team followed the women's lead
by defeating runner-up Michigan
by a whopping 124.5 points.
Their 520.5 total points rein
forced Stanford's reign as
national champions and con
firmed deGuerre Pool's reputa
tion as the unofficial "Swimming
Capital of the World."
At first glance, swimrmng
seems to be, primarily, an indi
vidual sport.
But it was teamwork that led
the men to their second consecu
tive NCAA title. A plethora of
second-and third-place finiMhes
racked up the points necessary
for victory.
"There's no one guy on this
team who has to be a superstar
and carry the load," said coach
Kinney in the aftermath of their
title. Derek VVeatherford, Tyler
Mayfield and Ray Carey did win
individual national titles, but it
was clearly a team effort.
Sadao Hamada may have had
the most intriguing recipe for a
championship.
Take the same ingredients as
last year, throw in a slew of
injuries and then turn up the
heat slowly but powerfully on
your squad. Serve at the NCAA
Championships.
It came out perfectly.

On April 17, on the same floor
which produced women's volley
ball's first title, men's gymnas
tics defended its title against
Nebraska, last year's runner-up.
And, as they did in the previous
year, they peaked at perfect time.
Stanford performed high-risk
routines in the preliminaries,
which produced 12 falls during
the competition.
The Cardinal finished third,
barely placing them in the finals.
But once in the finals, Stanford's
high-risk preparation paid off,
culminating in a heart-stopping
276.5-275.5 triumph.
All of this was accomplished
despite numerous injuries dur
ing the season, including a
severely broken ankle to junior
Jing-Wei Liang.
But the biggest loss was co
captain Mark Booth, who was
injured in the NCAA Western
Regionals and did not compete in
the NCAA Championships. Chris
Sey and Andrew Manson filled in
admirably, and the Cardinal
returned to the Farm victorious.
The glory of these champi
onships is now transformed into
the hope which marks the
upcoming year.
But 1992-93 was another
shining season for Stanford, one
in which all the cardinal ingredi
ents — teammork, dedication,
and talent — blended into a
savory dish.
How sweet it is.

The Cardinal men's swimming team celebrates after winning one of
Stanford's four NCAA championships last year.
A pinch of this, a touch of
that; cooking can be an inexact
science. You never know how
your creation will turn out —
until you take a bite. But for
Stanford athletes in the last aca
demic year, competition had a
very sweet taste to it.
Don Shaw, Richard Quick,
Skip Kenney and Sadao Hamada
all used different recipes, yet had
the same results — these Cardi
nal coaches all cooked up cham
pionships.
The facts are simple: Stanford
came away with four NCAA team
championships last year and 21
individual championships, both
more than any other school in
the nation. Titles in women's
volleyball, men's and women's
swimming and men's gymnastics
gave Stanford an unprecedented
nine national championships in
two years.
The first serving came on the
night of Dec. 19, when the
women's volleyball team van
quished UCLA in what was pos
sibly Stanford's most delicious
triumph.
Stanford barbecued the Bru
ins at the Pit in Albuquerque,
netting the squad's first NCAA
title.
UCLA came into the match
heralded as the best collegiate
squad ever assembled in the
sport.
Furthermore, they defeated
the Cardinal twice during the
regular season. But those two
defeats set up a David-and-
Goliath scenario, as UCLA was
burdened with media attention,
great expectations and unbeliev
able pressure. The heat was
clearly on the Bruins.
"As much as I hate to lose, I
was almost glad when we didn't
win that match [Stanford's first
loss to UCLAI, because it helped
keep that scenario in place. We
could kind of see we were going
to need that pressure on them,
all the attention on them," said
coach Shaw.
And while UCLA felt pres
sured, Stanford felt confident.
"We lost [the first match] in five,
but we expected to get killed,"

said current senior Heidi Eick. "I
remember Bev [Oden] saying
something like 'Gosh, is this as
good as they are? If this is it,
then we definitely have it in
us.' "
The Cardinal certainly had
the talent necessary for success.
