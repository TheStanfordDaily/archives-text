# NCAA champions suffer shaky start
## Spikers stuffed in Southern Cal.

The Stanford women's volley
ball team might need a set of
name tags.
With five freshmen replacing
the seniors lost from last year's
National Championship team,
the squad's eight returning play
ers have had to acquaint them
selves to several unfamiliar team
mates.
"With new faces on the floor
on a regular basis, we're going to
be learning as we go," said coach
Don Shaw.
Unfortunately, the formerly
top-ranked Cardinal team ran
into two more-polished rivals
while on a recent early-season
Southern California swing. The
squad's relative inexperience was
evident in a forgettable series
against perennial Pacific 10 Con
ference rivals UCLA and USC.
UCLA started the onslaught
last Thursday at Pauley Pavilion.
After handily defeating the Bru
ins in the first two sets, the Car
dinal was unable to dispose of its
rival, allowing the Bruins to gain
an eventual 7-15, 2-15, 15-8, 15-
10, 15-12 upset.
Looking to rebound against
USC the next day, Stanford
instead suffered another rude
awakening, this time at the hands
of the Trojans. Dropping the
match 16-14, 19-17, 15-8, the
Cardinal returns home this week
with a blemished 5-2 record.
Despite this recent slump,
Stanford remains a national pow
erhouse. Captained by seniors
Piper Hahn and Heidi Eick and
junior Anne Wicks, the squad
demonstrated its still consider
able strengths while opening its
season with three consecutive
road wins against Big Ten
schools.
On Sept. 1, the Cardinal came
out on top in its season-opener
for the 10th consecutive year, as
it overcame Wisconsin in a 15-7,
15-13, 15-6 sweep. Two days
later, Stanford again proved itself
a definite contender for the
national title as it secured first
place in the Pacific Ten / Big Ten
Challenge by shutting down
Michigan (15-4, 15-7, 15-11) and
No. 13 Ohio State (15-13, 15-12,
7-15, 15-12), both in Ann Arbor.
The following weekend, the
Cardinal traveled to Stockton
where it rallied after a shaky
start to defeat University of
Pacific, 7-15, 15-4, 16-14, 15-8.
Stanford then brought the
momentum generated by that
victory to Maples Pavilion the
next night to soundly stomp Pep
perdine, 15-4, 15-13, 15-6 in its
first home contest.
"We accomplished what we

wanted to get accomplished,"
Shaw said. "We learned more
about ourselves as a team. I felt
pretty good about the way we
competed — we struggled at
times, but that didn't cost us any
matches."
While Shaw still considers it
too early to clearly assess techni
cal strengths, he was pleased with
the team's blocking statistics in
its first three games.
"Our stats were better than I
anticipated," Shaw said. "I would
like to maintain our level of
blocking and coordinate with the
rest of our back-court defense, on
which we can improve vastly."
Yet it will be difficult to
improve on last year's overall per
formance. The team has changed
drastically since last season,
when Oden, a four-time first
team All-American, led the Cardi
nal to a 31-2 finish. Second-team
Ail-Americans Carrie Feldman,
Jennifer Jackson, Kristi Paason
and Laurie Sawin also graduated
with Oden.
This year, the team's four
upperclassmen will be called
upon to fill the shoes of the five
graduates — no small task.
Hahn, at five-foot-seven, steps
into the crucial role of starting
setter. Taking on the job as team
controller, she is responsible for
coordinating offensive plays and
placing the ball in the best posi
tion for the hitters. Already prov
ing capable of the task, Hahn
accumulated 108 assists in her
first three matches. In addition,
she served a career-high six aces
against Michigan.
Wicks joins Hahn as the Cardi
nal's second returning starter.
Shaw expects the 6-2 hitter to be
Stanford's prime force in the mid
dle court. After ending the '92
season with a .262 average and
187 kills, she spent the summer
in Germany playing on the U.S.
National B Team.
"Anne is a player that doesn't
get a lot of credit, but is always
there battling it away," Shaw
said. "She's right in the middle of
the action — and does a good job
at that spot."
In the position of role-player,
5-11 Eick will enter the game
when needed to assist in specific
situations. Shaw cites her work
ethic as one of the "keys to suc
cess on the team." Junior Denise
Rotert completes the upperclass
foursome. At 5-10, Rotert will vie
for a starting spot as an outside
hitter or defensive specialist.
Furthermore, the Cardinal's
sophomore and freshman talent
should further aid Stanford's
quest to repeat as champions.
