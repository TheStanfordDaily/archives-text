# NCAA champions suffer shaky start
## Spikers stuffed in Southern Cal. 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team might need a set of
name tags.
With five freshmen replacing
the seniors lost from last year's
National Championship team,
the squad's eight returning play
ers have had to acquaint them
selves to several unfamiliar team
mates.
"With new faces on the floor
on a regular basis, we're going to
be learning as we go," said coach
Don Shaw.
Unfortunately, the formerly
top-ranked Cardinal team ran
into two more-polished rivals
while on a recent early-season
Southern California swing. The
squad's relative inexperience was
evident in a forgettable series
against perennial Pacific 10 Con
ference rivals UCLA and USC.
UCLA started the onslaught
last Thursday at Pauley Pavilion.
After handily defeating the Bru
ins in the first two sets, the Car
dinal was unable to dispose of its
rival, allowing the Bruins to gain
an eventual 7-15, 2-15, 15-8, 15-
10, 15-12 upset.
Looking to rebound against
USC the next day, Stanford
instead suffered another rude
awakening, this time at the hands
of the Trojans. Dropping the
match 16-14, 19-17, 15-8, the
Cardinal returns home this week
with a blemished 5-2 record.
Despite this recent slump,
Stanford remains a national pow
erhouse. Captained by seniors
Piper Hahn and Heidi Eick and
junior Anne Wicks, the squad
demonstrated its still consider
able strengths while opening its
season with three consecutive
road wins against Big Ten
schools.
On Sept. 1, the Cardinal came
out on top in its season-opener
for the 10th consecutive year, as
it overcame Wisconsin in a 15-7,
15-13, 15-6 sweep. Two days
later, Stanford again proved itself
a definite contender for the
national title as it secured first
place in the Pacific Ten / Big Ten
Challenge by shutting down
Michigan (15-4, 15-7, 15-11) and
No. 13 Ohio State (15-13, 15-12,
7-15, 15-12), both in Ann Arbor.
The following weekend, the
Cardinal traveled to Stockton
where it rallied after a shaky
start to defeat University of
Pacific, 7-15, 15-4, 16-14, 15-8.
Stanford then brought the
momentum generated by that
victory to Maples Pavilion the
next night to soundly stomp Pep
perdine, 15-4, 15-13, 15-6 in its
first home contest.
"We accomplished what we

wanted to get accomplished,"
Shaw said. "We learned more
about ourselves as a team. I felt
pretty good about the way we
competed — we struggled at
times, but that didn't cost us any
matches."
While Shaw still considers it
too early to clearly assess techni
cal strengths, he was pleased with
the team's blocking statistics in
its first three games.
"Our stats were better than I
anticipated," Shaw said. "I would
like to maintain our level of
blocking and coordinate with the
rest of our back-court defense, on
which we can improve vastly."
Yet it will be difficult to
improve on last year's overall per
formance. The team has changed
drastically since last season,
when Oden, a four-time first
team All-American, led the Cardi
nal to a 31-2 finish. Second-team
Ail-Americans Carrie Feldman,
Jennifer Jackson, Kristi Paason
and Laurie Sawin also graduated
with Oden.
This year, the team's four
upperclassmen will be called
upon to fill the shoes of the five
graduates — no small task.
Hahn, at five-foot-seven, steps
into the crucial role of starting
setter. Taking on the job as team
controller, she is responsible for
coordinating offensive plays and
placing the ball in the best posi
tion for the hitters. Already prov
ing capable of the task, Hahn
accumulated 108 assists in her
first three matches. In addition,
she served a career-high six aces
against Michigan.
Wicks joins Hahn as the Cardi
nal's second returning starter.
Shaw expects the 6-2 hitter to be
Stanford's prime force in the mid
dle court. After ending the '92
season with a .262 average and
187 kills, she spent the summer
in Germany playing on the U.S.
National B Team.
"Anne is a player that doesn't
get a lot of credit, but is always
there battling it away," Shaw
said. "She's right in the middle of
the action — and does a good job
at that spot."
In the position of role-player,
5-11 Eick will enter the game
when needed to assist in specific
situations. Shaw cites her work
ethic as one of the "keys to suc
cess on the team." Junior Denise
Rotert completes the upperclass
foursome. At 5-10, Rotert will vie
for a starting spot as an outside
hitter or defensive specialist.
Furthermore, the Cardinal's
sophomore and freshman talent
should further aid Stanford's
quest to repeat as champions.
Cary Wendell heads the sopho
more contingency some have
dubbed Stanford's "Fab Four."
The 6-0 outside hitter has already
been named Pac-10 Player of the
Week for her performances in
Stanford's first three games, in
which she hit .298 with 37 kills,
30 digs, four aces, 11 blocks and
19 assists.
With numbers like these, it's
not hard to see why Shaw
described Wendell as his "best all
around volleyball player this
year." She was an essential figure
on last year's team, earning the
titles of Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year and Volleyball Monthly's
National Freshman of the Year.
Wendell's classmates include

Marnie Triefenbach, a 6-0 hitter
who racked up 18 kills and 10 digs
against Ohio State, 6-1 hitter
Maureen McLaren and 5-11 hit
ter Wendy Hromadka, a member
of the Pac-10 All-Freshman team
last year.
McLaren, also a member of the
Stanford swimming team, became
the first Cardinal woman to win
two NCAA titles in one year. She
finished the season with the team's
highest hitting average at .485.
"Right now I'm looking to see
what I can get from specific play
ers," Shaw said. "I think the team
will soon start to develop its own
chemistry and character."
While much of that character
will come from the team's second
year veterans, it helps to have
what most agree to be the top
recruiting class in the country.
Already displaying the talent

which earned them that distinc
tion, Colleen Miniuk, a 6-0 outside
hitter from St. Charles, 111.,
slammed three aces against Michi
gan to begin her college career,
while 6-0 hitters Eileen Murfee
from Tampa, Fla., and Nikki Otto
from Baden, Pa., also came off the
bench in that match. These three
newcomers are joined by 6-0 hitter
Paula McNamee from Wheaton,
Md., and 5-8 setter Catherine Juil
lard from Los Angeles.
Based on the relative youth of
the team, Shaw does not see the
pressure of being returning
national champions having too
much of an effect on the Cardi
nal's performance.
"The defending national cham
pions lost five starters," Shaw
said. "We have a whole new team.
Whether we're better or worse
remains to be seen."
