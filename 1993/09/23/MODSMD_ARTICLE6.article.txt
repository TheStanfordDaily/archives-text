# 'George Shultz brings with him prestige'
## Former statesman keeps a feverish pace 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Have you ever wanted to trade places with someone?
Someone with international acclaim and influence?
How about with someone who has served on the presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, taught at MIT and
directed the University of Chicago's Graduate School of
Business? Someone who has also been secretary of labor,
director of the Office of Management and Budget, secre
tary of the Treasury and secretary of state?
Because George Shultz is willing to swap.
"I wish I were a freshman," says Shultz, a distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, an on-campus think tank.
"They'll be here for four years, with these wonderful re
sources. The people at Stanford are very exciting . . . it's
stimulating."
Actually, Shultz is a senior of sorts, having been back on
campus for about four years since he finished serving as
secretary of state under President Reagan. And while
some Washington refugees prefer to languish in universi
ty life, the former statesman has been reluctant to aban
don a feverish pace and regimented schedule.
From participating in dormitory talks to hosting world
dignitaries, Shultz has been anything but a recluse at
Stanford.
"He's terrifically productive," says former University
President Donald Kennedy. "What he's brought to the
campus is a wonderful enthusiasm about what goes on
here, from basketball to Res Ed, Hoover and students."
In 1990 and '91, Shultz was a natural ambassador in
the University's international Centennial Celebrations,
shoring up donor relations and extending 100 th year fes
tivities to Stanfordites in Canada, England, Hong Kong
and Mexico.
Back on campus, he's played host to a virtual "Who's
Who" of world leaders, from South Korean President Roh
Tae Woo to former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
In the process, he's played a key role in bolstering Stan
ford's and Hoover's image both nationally and abroad.

the Hoover Institution, recently published his 1,184-page memoirs.
He is currently working on a public-television documentary about
diplomacy.
what few people can bring," says
Richard Sousa, Hoover's associate
director. "He attracts visitors of
prestige, and he lends a voice of
experience to our discussions."
"Any department or organiza
tion has its illuminaries . . .
George Shultz is one of our stars,"
says Hoover Director John
Raisian.
Shultz, who holds an emeritus
professorship at the Graduate
School of Business, has also
attracted numerous dignitaries
to advise the Stanford-based
Institute for International Stud
ies, which explores ways coun
tries can map out solutions to
issues of international political
economy, the environment and
diplomacy.
With all the pomp and circum
stance surrounding Shultz, one
would expect he would have little
time for — let alone interest in —
students. Nothing could be fur

ther from the truth.
"I enjoy doing things around
Stanford, with groups and various
departments and with students in
the dorms," says Shultz, who lives
on campus and says his favorite
places to visit include the Rodin
Garden and the top of Hoover
Tower.
As if his resume weren't
enough to go on, Shultz's willing
ness to involve himself in the
community has earned him fur
ther esteem throughout the Uni
versity. "He's been a teacher to a
whole legion of beneficiaries,"
says Kenrfedy. "George accom
plished an incredible amount of
teaching without offering a single
course."
Somehow, between appoint
ments with various ambassadors,
students and international digni
taries, Shultz also recently man
aged to complete "Turmoil and
Triumph," a 1,184-page tome
about his six and a half years at
the helm of the State Depart
ment. But he admits it wasn't all
from memory.
"It was based on notes; they

would help me remember things,"
confesses Shultz. "When you have
been in the midst of a huge flow of
events — I liken it to drinking
from a fire hose — this is what
you do."
The memoirs reveal, in great
detail, the intricacies of diploma
cy, covering everything from the
gradual warming of relations with
the Soviets, White House infight
ing, the Iran-Contra affair and
the excruciating search for peace
in the Middle East.
"It was a long book, but there
was a lot that happened," says
Shultz matter-of-factly. "I wanted
to put it down in an interesting
way, a precise way, but also with
the kind of supporting details that
give it credibility and also useful
ness as a document for histori
ans."
With that task behind him,
Shultz is already forging ahead
with his next project — most like
ly a public television documentary
accompanied by a book — on what
he calls "statecraft."
Statecraft, explains Shultz, is
thinking about "how nations deal

with each other, partly from a his
torical perspective — American
diplomatic history — but really
kind of projecting into the new
world of diplomacy and the inter
relations of nations what to make
of today's conditions."
But in spite of his recent aca
demic projects, Shultz won't let
you forget for a minute that his
finger is still on the pulse of the
international scene.
He's optimistic that Tuesday's
move by Boris Yeltsin dissolving
Russian Parliament and calling
for new elections will lead to
faster reform.
Yeltsin "stands for things that,
it seems to me, are good for Rus
sia," says Shultz. "The Parlia
ment he's had to contend with is
basically a holdover form the
Soviet days and I think that it
should be refreshed by elections.
"I think he's entitled to be
frustrated. ... I think the (Clin
ton) administration did well to
step right up and support the pro
cess of elections."
While Shultz endorses the cur
rent U.S. support of Yeltsin, he's

not afraid to criticize his succes
sors and their policies, especially
when it comes to the civil war in
the former Yugoslavia.
"I think what has happened in
Bosnia is a disgrace," says Shultz.
"I am ashamed at . . . the degra
dation of the people, particularly
of the Muslims, in Bosnia who are
being forced to accept something
that isn't workable.
"We have been an accomplice
because we accepted early on —
during the Bush administration
— the Serbian suggestion that
there be an arms embargo. It's a
great thing to have an arms
embargo when you're heavily
armed and your opponent isn't.
There's nothing neutral about
that, but somehow, we've stuck to
it."
As cease fires and peace negoti
ations ebb and flow, Shultz says
he's become increasingly frustrat
ed with the lack of resolve — on
the part of the United States,
NATO and the United Nations —
to use force.
"The U.N. secretary-general
says, 'We must not use force, it

might disrupt the negotiations,'
and I say to myself, 'He must be
living on a different planet. Force
is being used every day, it's just
one-sided force.' "
While he is pessimistic regard
ing lasting peace in Bosnia, the
recent accord between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation brought Shultz — who
toiled endlessly in the quest for
Middle East peace throughout the
Reagan years — much delight.
Shultz, who was secretary of
state when the United States rec
ognized the PLO in 1988, attend
ed the White House ceremony cel
ebrating the pact between the two
long-time enemies. To see Yasir
Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shake
hands was an "electric moment,"
says Shultz.
An exhibit about Shultz and
his work as secretary of state is on
display Monday-Friday from 11
a.m.-4 p.m. through Sept. 30 in
Hoover Memorial building.
"It's interesting, and not just
because it's about me," says
Shultz. "There's a lot of history,
too."

While he is pessimistic regard
ing lasting peace in Bosnia, the
recent accord between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organi

Reagan years — much delight.

long-time enemies. To see Yasir
Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shake

says Shultz.
An exhibit about Shultz and
his work as secretary of state is on
display Monday-Friday from 11
a.m.-4 p.m. through Sept. 30 in
Hoover Memorial building.
"It's interesting, and not just
because it's about me," says
Shultz. "There's a lot of history,
too."
Have you ever wanted to trade places with someone?
Someone with international acclaim and influence?
How about with someone who has served on the presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, taught at MIT and
directed the University of Chicago's Graduate School of
Business? Someone who has also been secretary of labor,
director of the Office of Management and Budget, secre
tary of the Treasury and secretary of state?
Because George Shultz is willing to swap.
"I wish I were a freshman," says Shultz, a distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, an on-campus think tank.
"They'll be here for four years, with these wonderful re
sources. The people at Stanford are very exciting . . . it's
stimulating."
Actually, Shultz is a senior of sorts, having been back on
campus for about four years since he finished serving as
secretary of state under President Reagan. And while
some Washington refugees prefer to languish in universi
ty life, the former statesman has been reluctant to aban
don a feverish pace and regimented schedule.
From participating in dormitory talks to hosting world
dignitaries, Shultz has been anything but a recluse at
Stanford.
"He's terrifically productive," says former University
President Donald Kennedy. "What he's brought to the
campus is a wonderful enthusiasm about what goes on
here, from basketball to Res Ed, Hoover and students."
In 1990 and '91, Shultz was a natural ambassador in
the University's international Centennial Celebrations,
shoring up donor relations and extending 100 th year fes
tivities to Stanfordites in Canada, England, Hong Kong
and Mexico.
Back on campus, he's played host to a virtual "Who's
Who" of world leaders, from South Korean President Roh
Tae Woo to former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
In the process, he's played a key role in bolstering Stan
ford's and Hoover's image both nationally and abroad.
"George Shultz brings with him prestige equivalent to

Former Secretary of State George Shultz, a distinguished fellow at
the Hoover Institution, recently published his 1,184-page memoirs.
He is currently working on a public-television documentary about
diplomacy.
what few people can bring," says
Richard Sousa, Hoover's associate
director. "He attracts visitors of
prestige, and he lends a voice of
experience to our discussions."
"Any department or organiza
tion has its illuminaries . . .
George Shultz is one of our stars,"
says Hoover Director John
Raisian.
Shultz, who holds an emeritus
professorship at the Graduate
School of Business, has also
attracted numerous dignitaries
to advise the Stanford-based
Institute for International Stud
ies, which explores ways coun
tries can map out solutions to
issues of international political
economy, the environment and
diplomacy.
With all the pomp and circum
stance surrounding Shultz, one
would expect he would have little
time for — let alone interest in —
students. Nothing could be fur

ther from the truth.
"I enjoy doing things around
Stanford, with groups and various
departments and with students in
the dorms," says Shultz, who lives
on campus and says his favorite
places to visit include the Rodin
Garden and the top of Hoover
Tower.
As if his resume weren't
enough to go on, Shultz's willing
ness to involve himself in the
community has earned him fur
ther esteem throughout the Uni
versity. "He's been a teacher to a
whole legion of beneficiaries,"
says Kenrfedy. "George accom
plished an incredible amount of
teaching without offering a single
course."
Somehow, between appoint
ments with various ambassadors,
students and international digni
taries, Shultz also recently man
aged to complete "Turmoil and
Triumph," a 1,184-page tome
about his six and a half years at
the helm of the State Depart
ment. But he admits it wasn't all
from memory.
"It was based on notes; they

would help me remember things,"
confesses Shultz. "When you have
been in the midst of a huge flow of
events — I liken it to drinking
from a fire hose — this is what
you do."
The memoirs reveal, in great
detail, the intricacies of diploma
cy, covering everything from the
gradual warming of relations with
the Soviets, White House infight
ing, the Iran-Contra affair and
the excruciating search for peace
in the Middle East.
"It was a long book, but there
was a lot that happened," says
Shultz matter-of-factly. "I wanted
to put it down in an interesting
way, a precise way, but also with
the kind of supporting details that
give it credibility and also useful
ness as a document for histori
ans."
With that task behind him,
Shultz is already forging ahead
with his next project — most like
ly a public television documentary
accompanied by a book — on what
he calls "statecraft."
Statecraft, explains Shultz, is
thinking about "how nations deal

with each other, partly from a his
torical perspective — American
diplomatic history — but really
kind of projecting into the new
world of diplomacy and the inter
relations of nations what to make
of today's conditions."
But in spite of his recent aca
demic projects, Shultz won't let
you forget for a minute that his
finger is still on the pulse of the
international scene.
He's optimistic that Tuesday's
move by Boris Yeltsin dissolving
Russian Parliament and calling
for new elections will lead to
faster reform.
Yeltsin "stands for things that,
it seems to me, are good for Rus
sia," says Shultz. "The Parlia
ment he's had to contend with is
basically a holdover form the
Soviet days and I think that it
should be refreshed by elections.
"I think he's entitled to be
frustrated. ... I think the (Clin
ton) administration did well to
step right up and support the pro
cess of elections."
While Shultz endorses the cur
rent U.S. support of Yeltsin, he's

not afraid to criticize his succes
sors and their policies, especially
when it comes to the civil war in
the former Yugoslavia.
"I think what has happened in
Bosnia is a disgrace," says Shultz.
"I am ashamed at . . . the degra
dation of the people, particularly
of the Muslims, in Bosnia who are
being forced to accept something
that isn't workable.
"We have been an accomplice
because we accepted early on —
during the Bush administration
— the Serbian suggestion that
there be an arms embargo. It's a
great thing to have an arms
embargo when you're heavily
armed and your opponent isn't.
There's nothing neutral about
that, but somehow, we've stuck to
it."
As cease fires and peace negoti
ations ebb and flow, Shultz says
he's become increasingly frustrat
ed with the lack of resolve — on
the part of the United States,
NATO and the United Nations —
to use force.
"The U.N. secretary-general
says, 'We must not use force, it

might disrupt the negotiations,'
and I say to myself, 'He must be
living on a different planet. Force
is being used every day, it's just
one-sided force.' "
