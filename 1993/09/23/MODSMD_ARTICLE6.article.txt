# 'George Shultz brings with him prestige'
## Former statesman keeps a feverish pace 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Have you ever wanted to trade places with someone?
Someone with international acclaim and influence?
How about with someone who has served on the presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, taught at MIT and
directed the University of Chicago's Graduate School of
Business? Someone who has also been secretary of labor,
director of the Office of Management and Budget, secre
tary of the Treasury and secretary of state?
Because George Shultz is willing to swap.
"I wish I were a freshman," says Shultz, a distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, an on-campus think tank.
"They'll be here for four years, with these wonderful re
sources. The people at Stanford are very exciting . . . it's
stimulating."
Actually, Shultz is a senior of sorts, having been back on
campus for about four years since he finished serving as
secretary of state under President Reagan. And while
some Washington refugees prefer to languish in universi
ty life, the former statesman has been reluctant to aban
don a feverish pace and regimented schedule.
From participating in dormitory talks to hosting world
dignitaries, Shultz has been anything but a recluse at
Stanford.
"He's terrifically productive," says former University
President Donald Kennedy. "What he's brought to the
campus is a wonderful enthusiasm about what goes on
here, from basketball to Res Ed, Hoover and students."
In 1990 and '91, Shultz was a natural ambassador in
the University's international Centennial Celebrations,
shoring up donor relations and extending 100 th year fes
tivities to Stanfordites in Canada, England, Hong Kong
and Mexico.
Back on campus, he's played host to a virtual "Who's
Who" of world leaders, from South Korean President Roh
Tae Woo to former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
In the process, he's played a key role in bolstering Stan
ford's and Hoover's image both nationally and abroad.
