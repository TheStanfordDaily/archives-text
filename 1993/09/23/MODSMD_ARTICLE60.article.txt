# In with the new
## Frosh and coach revamp program 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The 1993 Stanford women's
soccer team entered the season
with the notable absences of star
player Julie Foudy and coach
Berhane Andeberhan. However,
despite signs of shakiness early in
the year, the squad seems to be
well on its way to another success
ful season.

In Foudy and Andeberhan, the
Cardinal lost the player and coach
who were largely responsible for
lifting Stanford women's soccer
into national prominence.
Foudy's graduation left the
Cardinal squad without its four
time Ail-American. Foudy also
received the 1991 Soccer America
Player of the Year award and has
since joined the U.S. National
team. She led the Stanford squad

in goal-scoring with 13 last year.
In an unexpected off-season
development, Andeberhan re
signed after allegations of miscon
duct. Players had charged that
Andeberhan was overly critical
and had once threatened to slap a
team member.
Former assistant coach lan
Sawyers was named interim head
coach. Sawyers will assume leader
ship of a team that posted a 17-2-1

record last year en route to a
NCAA quarterfinals appearance.
Even with Foudy's absence,
Stanford has returned a very pow
erful lineup from a team that was
ranked as high as No. 2 in nation
al polls last year. Anchored by
seniors Sarah Rafanelli and Leslie
Garrard, the Cardinal has stars on
both offense and defense.
Midfielder Rafanelli is one of
the best at finding the back of the
net, scoring 12 goals last year:
Garrard is nearly her equal in
defending the goal, with a 0.77
goals-against average and five solo
shutouts a year ago.
Also returning are second-team
All-Far West selections Jessica
Fischer and Carmel Murphy. Fis
cher, a sophomore fullback, scored
five goals from her defensive posi
tion and started all 20 games as a
freshman last year.
Midfielder Murphy, also a
sophomore and 20-game starter,
was-the fourth-leading scorer on
the team last year. Named to Soc
cer America 's Freshman All-
American team, Murphy is rapidly
becoming one of the top playmak
ers in the country.
In addition to losing Foudy, the
Cardinal also graduated Chris
Massell, Leni Nonoshita, Jen
Potok and Carolyn Einstein.
Despite losing this core of experi
enced seniors, Stanford is already
on their way to rebuilding the
team's nucleus.
"We're trying to avoid having a
transitional year this season,"
Sawyers said. "Hopefully, with the
returning players and our new
freshmen, we'll be able to pick up
right where we left off last year."
This season, Rafanelli is joined
by sophomores Dena Dey and Vicki
Haring and junior Andrea John
son. This quartet accounted for 25
goals and 19 assists last year.
The midfield is also loaded with
talent this year, with four key
members returning. Along with
Murphy, senior Anna Patitucci
and juniors Jen Stephan and
Amanda Tyler provide a veteran
corps at this key position.
Finally, Stanford's defense

This Cal Poly-SLO defender can't hold on to Cardinal midfielder Sarah Rafanelli, who is preparing to
score one of her two goals against the porous Mustang defense.
Finally, Stanford's defense
returns three fullbacks. Along
with Fischer, juniors Melinda
Minstrell and Laura Wilkes look
to make up for the loss of senior
co-captain Anita Koshy, out for
the season with a knee injury.
In addition to the returning
players, Stanford brought in one
of the country's top recruiting
classes. Boasting four Parade
Magazine Ail-Americans among a
talented cast of 11 newcomers,
the Cardinal looks to strengthen a
young, but potent team.
With this balance between vet
erans and youth, the Cardinal
began the season with a 4-0
whitewash of UC-Davis. Johnson,
Murphy, Stephan and Haring
provided the offense against the
Aggies.
Journeying to Washington for
its first road trip of the year, Stan
ford followed a 2-0 defeat of the
Huskies with a surprise loss to
unranked Washington State. Last
week, the Cardinal got back on
track with a 3-0 shutout of San
Francisco, followed by a 5-0
pounding of California Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
"We never train to be
mediocre, we always want to come
out on top," Sawyers said.
