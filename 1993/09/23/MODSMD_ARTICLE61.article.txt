# Men's soccer stars talented additions
## 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
After cruising to a second
place finish in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation and
garnering an NCAA Tourna
ment bid last year, this season
the men's soccer squad will try
to surpass their tremendous
1992 finish with a talented
young team and 13 new faces
on the field.
Dubbed a "reloading" year
by coach Colin Lindores, the
Cardinal will try to compensate
for the loss of seven key seniors
by assimilating freshman and
sophomore talent into an expe
rienced line-up.
"We are rebuilding to a cer
tain extent," Lindores said.
"But it's not a case of the cup
board was bare and now we're
starting all over. We have a lot
of experienced players with us,
more than (we) expected after
losing seven seniors."
This experience wl'l come in
the form of senior midfielder
Joel Russell and junior
defenseman JefT Kogl, both of
whom hope to guide the young
team.
On offense, Russell will lead
a powerful scoring unit staffed
with junior Ryan Collins,
sophomore Carmen D'Onofrio
and senior Ricky Goad. Collins
assumes the playmaker role
this season after topping all
Cardinal scorers his freshman
year and then tallying six goals
last year, the third-highest
total for Stanford.
Joining him is forward
D'Onofrio, a MPSF All-Star
and a former member of the
Canadian national team. A ver
satile player, Goad will comple
ment the front line by charging
in from the midfield.
Niels Bruckner, a perennial
standout and an experienced
ball-handler on offense, also
returns to the Cardinal mid
field. Behind him in the back
field, co-captain Kogl serves as
a stabilizing force in the defen
sive third of the field, while

goalkeeper Terry Favazza tries
to keep opponents at bay by
maintaining his excellent
goals-against average (0.58).
In addition to returning
solid starters on both sides of
the field, Stanford looks to bol
ster its lineup this season with
talented recruits, who hope to
fill the holes left by the gradu
ated seniors.
"Even with our returning
starters, this year's team will
have a completely different
personnel with three, possibly
four freshmen starting at
times," Lindores said.
The team's highly touted
recruits include a duo hailing
from Burnsville, Minn. High
school teammates Brad Davies
and Mat Foley captured Lin
dores' attention at a regional
soccer competition last year.
This fall, they have become two
of Stanford's most promising
players.
Both Davies and Foley are
expected to see considerable
playing time this year in the
backfield, with Davies man
ning the stopper position and
Foley taking on the defensive
midfielder role.
Defense specialists Ryan
Craig and Duncan Hill, along
with midfielders Crowan
Roberts and Paul Phillips and
forward Daniel Eisenberg, are
also receiving significant atten
tion from the coaching staff, as
well as ample experience on the
field.
"As a coach it's great to
know that you have capable
freshmen, who can contribute
right off the bat," Lindores
said. "That means you have a
solid starter at that specific
position for years to come."
Last season, the Cardinal
capitalized on its strengths to
finish second behind Washing
ton. Despite squandering two
chances to catch and surpass
the Huskies during the last two
weeks of the regular season,
Stanford nevertheless earned
its second play off berth in 13
years.
However, the team, led by top
scorer Jason Vanacour and veter
an goalkeeper Kyle Krpata, fell
short of NCAA glory as they suc
cumbed to San Diego State's
crushing offense, 3-0, in the first
round.
With an almost entirely new
cast this season, the Cardinal
has expressed guarded optimism
toward this year's play-off
hopes.
"It would be a major accom
plishment for us to get to the
Tournament," Lindores said.
"In theory, we shouldn't be
able to repeat last year's finish. In
theory, we don't have as good a
team, experience-wise, as last
year, but what you don't know
about is the chemistry of the
team. Early on, this team has
shown a lot of fighting power and
determination to win."
