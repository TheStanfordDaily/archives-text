# Club sports: a ball
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
So, your days of high-school
athletic glory are over. It seems
like ages since you- won, or lost,
the championship game in your
local district.
You packed away your letter
man's jacket, and chose not to
attempt to make one of Stanford's
varsity teams because you were
burnt out, happy to be done with
high school, or just afraid of rid
ing the pine in Division I.
Never fear, brave soul, there is
still hope. Club sports, an assort
ment of different athletic disci
plines, may be just what you need
to focus the athlete in you and get
back to competition. Included
under the heading of "club
sports" are various teams, all of
which work out regularly and rep
resent Stanford on local, regional
and national levels.
Participants on these squads
take their sports seriously, but
the main difference between club
sports and varsity athletics is that
first-time players are more wel
come on the club sports scene.
Students can choose from spe
cialized sports such as polo,
equestrian events and squash, or
participate in more everyday

sports like bowling and running.
Club sport status is often
reflection of the relative populari
ty of certain sports here on the
West Coast and in the Bay Area.
Lacrosse, for example, is virtu
ally nonexistent in California
high-school athletics, as opposed
to its East Coast popularity. The
sport flourishes here at Stanford,
however, under the category of
club sports.
Badminton, cricket, judo, rac
quetball, men's and women's
rugby and women's water polo
are only a few of the sports that
are looking for new talent.
Teams such as Ultimate Fris
bee, synchronized swimming,
cycling and ice hockey are fre
quently vying for national and
regional championships, reflect
ing the seriousness of their com
mitment to their respective
sports.
Team members put in hours of
practice each week, in the off-sea
son as well as during competitive
periods. Although they do not
benefit from varsity standing,
club sport programs provide a
serious forum for athletic compe
tition, as well as fun.
The cycling club, for example,
invites all students to come out
and ride in the afternoons. The

club has appiuxin««U;ly 100 mem
bers of all different levels, as well
as a racing team of 30 members
who compete iiom February
through Daily workouts
vary from easy rides such as the
"loop," a 12-mile route in Palo

Alto, to 70-100 mile endurance
rides. This is typical of the varied
abilities featured in the different
clubs, providing the opportunity
for all members to improve their
individual skills.
Students should contact the

club sports office or look for tables
in White Plaza staffed with team
representatives during the first
few weeks of school. Some sports
are also included in the time
schedule and units can be earned
for participation.
