# Stanford football:
## Stellar freshmen electrify Cardinal football faithful 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
So, you're doing the fresh
man thing. Unpacking those
bags, getting that phone hooked
up and trying to sincerely thank
your parents their sup
port while pushing them out the
door. Perhaps you're even
perusing the New Student Pic
ture Book for some Orientation
"get-togethers." So much to do,
so little time.
But there are a number of
freshmen that have already
been here for a while — since
Aug. 8, in fact. And although
many newcomers to Stanford
are waiting to make their mark
on the University, there are sev
eral that have already done so.
The freshman members of
the Stamford football team are
arguably the best group of
incoming freshmen ever to play
for the Cardinal.
The group was considered
the fourth-best incoming class
in the nation by some publica
tions, and was generally regard
ed as the best in the Pacific 10
Conference. It seems that
everyone except Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh was surprised
by the recruiting coup. But the
team discovered the new play
ers' talent immediately.
"We feel that we got the top
athletes in the nation," said
quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
The redshirt junior has had
great success throwing the ball
to several of those "top ath
letes," as the talented group of
newcomers has been asked to
contribute from the get-go.
The 20-member group boasts
18 high-school All-Americans,
including the third- and fifth
rated quarterbacks in the
nation and the third- and ninth
rated running backs as well as a

small posse of highly touted
receivers. Some of the frosh are
watching and waiting for their
chances to make an impact on
the team, but an unusually high
number of freshmen are seeing
extensive playing time right
now.
"Freshmen will play," said
Walsh at the start of the season.
"[They] may not start, but will
play a lot right away. A lot will
play on special teams ....
They're picking up the system
very well."
Among those "playing right
away" have been halfTback Mike
Mitchell and fullback Greg
Cornelia, who start as the Cardi
nal's kick-off receivers. But
their talents go far deeper than
mere special-teams play.
"Mike Mitchell and Greg
Cornelia are going to be tremen
dous backs for Stanford," said
Stenstrom. "It's just a question
of how fast they'll develop."
Mitchell and Cornelia are
both second-stringers at their
respective positions. And
because the Cardinal running
game has not yet matched the
success achieved by Stenstrom
and the air attack, both Mitchell
and Cornelia have seen a lot of
snaps, receiving long looks by
the coaching staff.
Stepping right into the spot
light means making some big
leaps quickly, including learn
ing a playbook that looks more
like a telephone book.
"Walsh is throwing every
thing at us at once," said Cornel
ia. "And it's one thing to learn it
on paper, and another to go out
there and do it."
Mitchell agrees that adapting
to the system can sometimes be
an arduous process, but some
thing that will have to come
quickly to him.
"I learn things at every prac
tice," said Mitchell after the

Sept. 11 San Jose State game.
"What I did this week I couldn't
have done last week."
Quarterback Scott Frost, from
Wood River, Neb., is also getting
a lot of playing time. With oppos
ing defenses looking for a pass
oriented offense, Walsh said that
Frost poses a different problem
for Cardinal foes with his run
ning abilities. In four rushing
attempts he has already racked
up 44 yards.
The very first offensive play
of the year came against Wash
ington when Stenstrom sent a
long bomb to a streaking Brian
Manning. Although the pass fell
incomplete, the play showed
that Walsh was not afraid to use
his freshmen in important
roles. Manning, a speedy receiv
er from Kansas City, Mo., has
seen significant playing time.
He has already caught two pass
es for 48 yards, including a cru
cial touchdown against Col
orado.
Other active newcomers on
offense include freshman receiv
er Leroy Pruitt, who serves as
the team's punt returner,
junior-college transfer Mark
Harris at split end and tight end
Adam Salina, a converted prep
All-American fullback. The
quicker the frosh learn, the
more they will play.
Freshmen are used according
to their "readiness to play," said
Walsh before the Washington
game. "But by the fact of attri
tion, they are thrust into play.
Three or four will play exten
sively, 10 on special teams."
The Cardinal defense suf
fered significant attrition from
last year's team. The squad lost
seven starters, forcing the
incoming frosh to take a larger
role than on offense. Holes in
the defensive periphery created
immediate needs at outside
linebacker and defensive back.

True to Walsh's words, the
freshmen have played important
roles to date, supplanting upper
classmen in the course of filling
three positions. Freshmen Brian
Batson and Nick Watts have
started two straight games as
the Cardinal's outside lineback
ers. Eliel Swinton, a converted
All-American running back, has
started two straight games at
cornerback, first replacing
injured senior Vaughn Bryant,
then taking over for sophomore
Kwame Ellis.
In addition to those starters,
freshmen play prominent roles
as back-ups on the defensive
side of the ball. Leon Vickers
and converted receiver Charlie
Young are listed as second

string strong and free safety,
respectively. As a backup defen
sive end, Matt Harper saw a lot
of playing time against Col
orado.
But the talents of the frosh
class go beyond the playing field.
"In practice, the freshmen
bring youthful enthusiasm and
energy," said defensive captain
Toby Norwood. "And they're
expected to play with that ener
gy and get to the ball. They're
improving every day."
Beyond the starters and back
ups on offense and defense,
other players have also made an
impact on special teams. Players
such as Quincy Jacobs and
inside linebacker Justin Strand
have abandoned any thought of

redshirting in order to con
tribute immediately.
Furthermore, freshmen such
as highly touted quarterback
Tim Carey, tight end Tommy
Hanson, offensive guard Brian
Badger, inside linebacker Evan
Wagner and defensive end Brian
Werner are also likely to con
tribute, if not this year, then
soon after.
In all, of the 20 freshmen, an
amazing 15 are on track to letter
this year. And with such a large
portion of the team learning
new things week-to-week, the
Cardinal is likely to become bet
ter with each game.
"We may not be the same
team a month from now that we
are today," said Walsh.

A highly touted recruit, freshman Mike Mitchell is already making significant contributions for the Car
dinal as a running back and return specialist.

tice," said Mitchell after the

Sept. 11 San Jose State game.
"What I did this week I couldn't
have done last week."
Quarterback Scott Frost, from
Wood River, Neb., is also getting
a lot of playing time. With oppos
ing defenses looking for a pass
oriented offense, Walsh said that
Frost poses a different problem
for Cardinal foes with his run
ning abilities. In four rushing
attempts he has already racked
up 44 yards.
The very first offensive play
of the year came against Wash
ington when Stenstrom sent a
long bomb to a streaking Brian
Manning. Although the pass fell
incomplete, the play showed
that Walsh was not afraid to use
his freshmen in important
roles. Manning, a speedy receiv
er from Kansas City, Mo., has
seen significant playing time.
He has already caught two pass
es for 48 yards, including a cru
cial touchdown against Col
orado.
Other active newcomers on
offense include freshman receiv
er Leroy Pruitt, who serves as
the team's punt returner,
junior-college transfer Mark
Harris at split end and tight end
Adam Salina, a converted prep
All-American fullback. The
quicker the frosh learn, the
more they will play.
Freshmen are used according
to their "readiness to play," said
Walsh before the Washington
game. "But by the fact of attri
tion, they are thrust into play.
Three or four will play exten
sively, 10 on special teams."
The Cardinal defense suf
fered significant attrition from
last year's team. The squad lost
seven starters, forcing the
incoming frosh to take a larger
role than on offense. Holes in
the defensive periphery created
immediate needs at outside
linebacker and defensive back.

True to Walsh's words, the
freshmen have played important
roles to date, supplanting upper
classmen in the course of filling
three positions. Freshmen Brian
Batson and Nick Watts have
started two straight games as
the Cardinal's outside lineback
ers. Eliel Swinton, a converted
All-American running back, has
started two straight games at
cornerback, first replacing
injured senior Vaughn Bryant,
then taking over for sophomore
Kwame Ellis.
In addition to those starters,
freshmen play prominent roles
as back-ups on the defensive
side of the ball. Leon Vickers
and converted receiver Charlie
Young are listed as second

string strong and free safety,
respectively. As a backup defen
sive end, Matt Harper saw a lot
of playing time against Col
orado.
But the talents of the frosh
class go beyond the playing field.
"In practice, the freshmen
bring youthful enthusiasm and
energy," said defensive captain
Toby Norwood. "And they're
expected to play with that ener
gy and get to the ball. They're
improving every day."
Beyond the starters and back
ups on offense and defense,
other players have also made an
impact on special teams. Players
such as Quincy Jacobs and
inside linebacker Justin Strand
have abandoned any thought of

redshirting in order to con
tribute immediately.
Furthermore, freshmen such
as highly touted quarterback
Tim Carey, tight end Tommy
Hanson, offensive guard Brian
Badger, inside linebacker Evan
Wagner and defensive end Brian
Werner are also likely to con
tribute, if not this year, then
soon after.
In all, of the 20 freshmen, an
amazing 15 are on track to letter
this year. And with such a large
portion of the team learning
new things week-to-week, the
Cardinal is likely to become bet
ter with each game.
"We may not be the same
team a month from now that we
are today," said Walsh.

A highly touted recruit, freshman Mike Mitchell is already making significant contributions for the Car
dinal as a running back and return specialist.
So, you're doing the fresh
man thing. Unpacking those
bags, getting that phone hooked
up and trying to sincerely thank
your parents their sup
port while pushing them out the
door. Perhaps you're even
perusing the New Student Pic
ture Book for some Orientation
"get-togethers." So much to do,
so little time.
But there are a number of
freshmen that have already
been here for a while — since
Aug. 8, in fact. And although
many newcomers to Stanford
are waiting to make their mark
on the University, there are sev
eral that have already done so.
The freshman members of
the Stamford football team are
arguably the best group of
incoming freshmen ever to play
for the Cardinal.
The group was considered
the fourth-best incoming class
in the nation by some publica
tions, and was generally regard
ed as the best in the Pacific 10
Conference. It seems that
everyone except Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh was surprised
by the recruiting coup. But the
team discovered the new play
ers' talent immediately.
"We feel that we got the top
athletes in the nation," said
quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
The redshirt junior has had
great success throwing the ball
to several of those "top ath
letes," as the talented group of
newcomers has been asked to
contribute from the get-go.
The 20-member group boasts
18 high-school All-Americans,
including the third- and fifth
rated quarterbacks in the
nation and the third- and ninth
rated running backs as well as a

small posse of highly touted
receivers. Some of the frosh are
watching and waiting for their
chances to make an impact on
the team, but an unusually high
number of freshmen are seeing
extensive playing time right
now.
"Freshmen will play," said
Walsh at the start of the season.
"[They] may not start, but will
play a lot right away. A lot will
play on special teams ....
They're picking up the system
very well."
Among those "playing right
away" have been halfTback Mike
Mitchell and fullback Greg
Cornelia, who start as the Cardi
nal's kick-off receivers. But
their talents go far deeper than
mere special-teams play.
"Mike Mitchell and Greg
Cornelia are going to be tremen
dous backs for Stanford," said
Stenstrom. "It's just a question
of how fast they'll develop."
Mitchell and Cornelia are
both second-stringers at their
respective positions. And
because the Cardinal running
game has not yet matched the
success achieved by Stenstrom
and the air attack, both Mitchell
and Cornelia have seen a lot of
snaps, receiving long looks by
the coaching staff.
Stepping right into the spot
light means making some big
leaps quickly, including learn
ing a playbook that looks more
like a telephone book.
"Walsh is throwing every
thing at us at once," said Cornel
ia. "And it's one thing to learn it
on paper, and another to go out
there and do it."
Mitchell agrees that adapting
to the system can sometimes be
an arduous process, but some
thing that will have to come
quickly to him.
"I learn things at every prac
tice," said Mitchell after the

Sept. 11 San Jose State game.
"What I did this week I couldn't
have done last week."
