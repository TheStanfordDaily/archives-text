						Rose-y outlook
## Professor Walsh teaches winning ways 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
When Bill Walsh returned to
Stanford one-and-a-half years ago
to reclaim his old position as head
football coach — a job he had not
held since 1978 — he made it
immediately clear that Cardinal
fans should not immediately rush
out to purchase Rose Bowl tickets.
"The best you are going to get
out of me is, hopefully, an ade
quate replacement for (former
Stanford coach) Denny Green,"
said Walsh at his Jan. 16, 1992
homecoming press conference.
"Don't expect anything better."
Yet such a conservative state
ment fell mostly on deaf ears. After
all, this was future Hall-of- Famer
Bill Walsh, owner of three Super
Bowl rings and one of the most
successful coaches in National
Football League history.
Not surprisingly, on the same
day as Walsh's press conference,
more than 100 inquiries were
made for 1992 football season tick
ets. In fact, ever since Walsh has
been back on the Farm, he has
generated a great deal of excite
ment within the Stanford commu
nity. But amid all the hoopla have
come higher expectations from
both the fans and his own players.
"Since coach Walsh has gotten
here, people expect a lot more out
of us," said senior inside lineback
er Mark Hatzenbuhler. "We expect
a lot more out of us as well."
Walsh responded to this chal
lenge brilliantly in the 1992 sea
son, despite his earlier misgivings.
The veteran coach guided the
Cardinal to an impressive 10-3
record, marking Stanford's first
10-win season since 1940, and a
share of the Pacific 10 Conference
championship. Included in those
victories were a 33-16 upset of
Notre Dame in South Bend and a
24-3 shellacking of Penn State in
the New Year's Day Blockbuster
Bowl.
Clearly, Walsh had no problem
dealing with the heavy expecta
tions placed on his shoulders —
even though the Stanford squad he

inherited was coming off an
extremely successful 1991 cam
paign that landed the Cardinal in
its first bowl game in five years.
"People expected a lot, but
there wasn't any pressure," Walsh
said. "I came in with a lot of confi
dence."
He also came in with a lot of
patience.
Instead of being known just as a
remote head coach to his players,
Walsh takes on an appearance
more like that of an educator who
spends as much time as necessary
to get a point across.
"A lot of (college) coaches, when
they're out on the field, they just
sit back and watch and let the
other coaches do the work,"
Hatzenbuhler said. "(Walsh) steps
in and says what he needs to. He
explains things,."
Like a teacher, Walsh tends to
look for signs of improvement in
his team's first few games rather
than immediate perfection. After
Stanford's come-from-behmd 31-
28 victory over San Jose State two
weekends ago, Walsh did not dwell
on the fact that the Cardinal had
almost begun the season with a
record of 0-2.
"I think that game was one of
the best things for Stanford, to
come from behind and win," he
said. "It was the right experience
for us to grow with."
While Walsh's coaching talent
has helped bring Stanford and its
football squad further into the
national spotlight, his accomplish
ments in the NFL have also
brought prominence to the school.
This past summer, Walsh
became one of only 14 coaches ever
to be inducted into the Profession
al Football Hall of Fame, an honor
which ranks at the peak of his
illustrious career.
"That's the ultimate when
you're named to the Hall of
Fame," Walsh said. "I still couldn't
believe as I was making my speech
that I was actually being inducted
into the Hall of Fame. Just being
grouped with some of the most
famous people in all of football is a
tremendous point of pride for me."

Walsh's NFL achievements
have also proven beneficial in lur
ing top recruits to the Farm. (Who
wouldn't want to play for someone
who's won a Super Bowl and
coached Joe Montana?) His pres
ence has enabled the Cardinal to
round up one of the top freshman
classes in the nation this year.
"When I knew coach Walsh was
coaching here, it definitely sealed
my decision to come," freshman
outside linebacker Nick Watts
said. Watts is one of just several
freshmen who played a significant
role in the Cardinal's improved
performance against San Jose St.
Admittedly, it is a thrill to be
playing for as esteemed a person as

Walsh, but Watts is quick to note
that in person, his legendary coach
is not an overwhelming figure. In
fact, Walsh comes across as a very
genuine, down-to-earth person.
"He doesn't have an aura
around him," Watts said. "He com
municates well with the players."
This ability to relate with his
team, comoined with Walsh's
respected stature, seems to bring
out the best in his players, much to
the dismay of Stanford's opponents.
And if the Cardinal continues to
get better as the season progresses,
Walsh will have even more stellar
achievements to add to his long
resume. Hopefully a trip to Pasade
na will finally be among them.
