# High-octane polo team guns for No. 1
## 
### Kyle Utsumi 
For the returning members of
the 1993 Stanford water polo team,
last season ended just a little too
soon. To be exact, it ended when
California's Dirk Zeien scored with
slightly less than a minute left in
sudden-death overtime of the 1992
NCAA Championship match in
Long Beach, CA.
But many Stanford players
gained valuable experience in the
eight-team tournament, beating
Princeton and USC before meeting
defeat in the finals. In one of the
most exciting championship match
es in NCAA history, the Golden
Bears prevailed in three overtime
periods, 12-11.
The Cardinal hopes to reverse
this outcome with a National
Championship of their own in
1993.
Overall, the 1992 team posted a
22-6 record, placing second at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament and finishing the
year ranked No. 2 in the nation.
Furthermore, last year's gradu
ates Chip Blankenhorn and J.T.
Matarangas garnered All-American
honors, as did returning players
Antonio Busquets, Wolf Wigo and
goaltender Larry Bercutt.
Led by that experienced trio, the
1993 squad is a team with out
standing depth and balance. Stan
ford's offense features size, speed
and an impressive amount of fire
power. The team's two leading scor
ers in 1992 — junior Wigo (42
goals) and senior Chris Wallin (34

goals) — will lead the Stanford
offense from the perimeter. Junior
Frank Schneider (25 goals) will see
a good deal of action at the pivotal
2-meter position (akin to a center
forward in soccer) and is a perpetu
al threat to score from close range.
In all, Stanford returns eight of
their top 11 scorers from a year ago,
accounting for 208 of the team's
287 goals. Furthermore, the Cardi
nal's abundance of left-handed
shooters makes Stanford a threat
to score from all areas of the pool.
Making matters more difficult
for opponents, the Cardinal
defense will be exceptionally hard
nosed and stingy. Bercutt, a two
time All-American goaltender,
anchors the defensive unit. The
senior is a veteran of two NCAA
championship games (1990 and
1992); Both times he saw Stanford
place second to California. A junior
who red-shirted his freshman year,
Jack Bowen will also see playing
time in the goal.
Head coach Dante Dettamanti
figures his team to be in the thick of
the national championship hunt.
Dettamanti, entering his 16th year
as head of the Cardinal program,
understands what it takes to bring
home the national title.
During his years at Stanford,
Dettamanti has had spectacular
success, coaching five National
Champion squads, including unde
feated teams in 1981 and 1986. Det
tamanti has been honored for his
efforts by being named NCAA
Coach of the Year three times and
the Pacific 10 Conference Coach of

the Year eight times.
"This team has the best talent
since the 1986 championship
team," said Dettamanti. "We're
really solid through nine or 10 play
ers, but you only play seven guys at
once."
This year, his team is currently
ranked No. 2 in the coaches' poll,
behind No. 1 California.
In addition to returning talent,
Dettamanti also had great success
in bringing several highly-touted
recruits to deGuerre Pool. After the
stellar first-year performances of
Wigo and Schneider in 1991 and
Laster, Leachman and Pyle in
1992, Dettamanti will not hesitate
to give his newest players an oppor
tunity to make an impact in the
water.
New recruit Brian Wallin, at 6-4
and 195 pounds, is the third mem
ber of the Wallin family to play,
water polo for the Cardinal and will
play alongside his brother Chris
this year. Brother Mark's final sea
son with Stanford was 1991.
Dettamanti also recruited two
outstanding goalkeepers in Nick
Fullerton and Tin Gazivoda.
New faces will not be the only
changes seen in the play of the
Stanford water polo team. Begin
ning this season, two significant
rule changes will go into effect.
First, two points will be awarded to
any goal scored from seven yards
beyond the goal line. The other
change will affect out-of-bounds sit
uations. When a goalkeeper deflects
a shot out-of-bounds, the ensuing
free pass will be taken from the

two-meter line in front of the goal, I
rather than the traditional corner- ;
throw. These changes have been -
made in an effort to increase the •
action and scoring in water polo.
So far this season, these rule .
changes appear to have had the
desired effect. The Cardinal has *
fought several high-scoring battles
in early-season action, including
respective 16-8 , 25-6 and 12-7 vic
tories over UC-Santa Barbara,
UC-Riverside and Pepperdine at
the University of Southern Cali- .
fornia Invitational, held Sept. 17-
19. While USC defeated the Stan- ;
ford squad by a narrow 7-6 margin
in second-day tournament action,' *
the Cardinal rebounded on Sun
day to defeat the Trojans 9-4 and *
bring home the championship tro- *
phy.
The most interesting effect of
the new rules is the possibility of a
team overcoming a deficit late in
the game via the two-point shot. -
Comparable to basketball's three
pointer, the new shot will force
teams to revise their strategies
when protecting a slim lead near i
the end of a match.
Bercutt, who won the outstand
ing player award in the USC tour
nament, would love to be protecting
a slim lead in late November, ;
preferably in the championship \
match.
"I've been in two close games for
second-place finishes. Those games
were heartbreakers, but both times
I was proud of how Stanford came
back (from large deficits). This
year, we're hoping to win it all."
