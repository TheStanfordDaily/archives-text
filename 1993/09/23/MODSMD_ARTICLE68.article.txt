# X-country pursuing success
## Stolz and Watson lead promising Cardinal squads 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
In attempting to qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships while also adding a highly-touted
recruit class, members of the Stanford men's and
women's cross-country squads have much on
their minds as they enter the 1993 season.
The Cardinal program has shown great
promise after one year under head coach Vin
Lananna, the former cross-country and track
coach at Dartmouth. While attempting to "get
the runners accustomed to a new coach," Lanan
na guided both teams to fourth-place finishes at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships last
season, with individual honors going to seniors
Louise Watson (second place in the five-kilome
ter race) and Gary Stolz (second in the 8K com
petition). In addition, Stolz earned Ail-American
honors by placing second at the NCAA Champi
onships.
"Last year's performance was Stanford's best
in a few years," Lananna said. "The athletes
exceeded my expectations."
This season, expectations have risen.
"[Both teams] have a good shot at finishing in
the top three in the [Pac-10] and a good shot at
qualifying for NCAAs," Lananna said.
Lananna is confident despite steep competi
tion from within the Pac-10. On the men's side,
defending conference champion Oregon returns
its entire squad, while second-place Arizona and
third-place Washington also remain strong. For
the women, Oregon and Washington are again
favored for the division title.
To qualify for NCAAs, a team must first place
first or second at the District-8 meet which fol
lows the Pac-10 Championships. The Cardinal
men's and women's cross-country teams look to
accomplish this goal with strikingly dissimilar
teams.
The women return a veteran unit led by Wat
son and senior team captain Sarah Truitt. In all,
the Stanford women retain six of their seven top
runners from last year, including juniors Melissa
Freeberg, Andrea Garner, Kay Luo and Jeannie
Rothman and sophomores Christine Dehlendorf,
Laura Hayward and Ann Sheehy.
"We're going to be tough to beat," Truitt said.
"This is the best depth we've had in eight or nine
years."
Indeed, in addition to the host of returning
runners, top high-school talents such as Amanda
White and Monal Chokshi will join the Cardinal.
White was the 1992 Kinney National Cross
Country champion, while Chokshi is a three-time
finalist at the same meet.

Only collegiate women's cross-country retains
the 5,000-meter run, the standard distance in
high school. However, both Truitt and Lananna
warn against high expectations for these talented
freshmen.
"Your whole lifestyle is changed at the college
level," said Truitt.
"It may not be different on the running end of
things, but keep in mind other freshman transi
tions," Lananna said. "It's not often that a fresh
man can step into a program like Stanford's and
make a tremendous impact."
The same caveat applies to the men's squad, a
primarily young team, in contrast to the experi
enced women runners.
"The men are talented, but very young,"
Lananna added. "I expect some of the freshmen
to make contributions, but the top five runners
will still be returnees."
As the nation's top returning cross-country
runner, Stolz will lead the men's quest to com
pete at NCAAs. Senior Todd Lewis, junior Brian
McCaffery, sophomore Rob Reeder and junior
transfer Mark Fadil (from Dartmouth) will pro
vide veteran legs.
Meanwhile, the remainder of the men's talent
resides in the incoming freshmen. Gregory Jim
merson, J.J. White and Andrew Cowgill head the
list of recruits Lananna considers one of the best
in the country. These three runners finished sec
ond, third and seventh respectively at the Kinney
Meet last year.
"We have a good group of freshmen," Stolz
said. "But, ideally, the freshmen will mean little
impact. We have good returning talent."
Lananna hopes the young runners will under
go a smooth transition into collegiate running
and help establish a quality Cardinal cross-coun
try program. Lananna's captains share this same
ideal.
"I want everyone to run as a team," Truitt
said. "When I was a frosh, Stanford wasn't that
good and people seemed more concerned about
beating [teammates] to earn a top running spot
on the team than focusing on beating runners
from other schools. We're so much stronger now
and a lot more confident. I want us to chase the
jerseys of other teams."
"Qualifying for the NCAAs is nice," Stolz said,
"but our primary goal is to develop as a team.
When that happens, the rest will come."
"We want to maintain composure in the first
meets," Lananna said. "We'll work hard early
and peak at Pac-10's and Districts. Every meet
will be a challenge. Momentum is good, though.
Everyone is healthy, enthusiastic and looking
forward to a good season."
