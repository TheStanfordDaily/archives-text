# Michael and Mel: Men Without Faces N'GAI CROAL
## 
### 
All children, except one, grow up.
—J.M. Barrie, "Peter Pan"

Michael Jackson lives apart from
everyone else on a grand estate,
hiding his diseased face |rom the
world. He loves animals — he own| a snake
and a chimpanzee, ajftioijg others, |pr com-J
pany. Jackson also loves children, having
tirelessly raised funds on their behalf, even
as allegations ofsexual abuse threaten to de
stroy his career and possibly put him in
prison. But he's a performer at heart, never
more alive than when he dances and sings
songs from his mega-platinum albums for
an audience ofthousands.
The for the life of the man
that the Brits dubbed "Wacko Jacko" was
laid when young Tito Jackson played guitar
for his father under threat of an ass-whip
ping. Michael, who started performing at
the age of five, immediately proved himself
the most talented of the lot, and never
looked back on the halcyon days of youth..
. until he got older, and could afford a per
manent suite at Disneyland, his own estate

(Neverland) complete with petting zoo and
the company of such mature talents as Em
manuel Lewis and Macaulay Culkin. In
short, Michael could now live out the
childhood that early starc^fit denied him.
Now, however, hi» penchant for slumber
parties With ba|jtly pubescent boys has
tlb# ugly, as dbfr them alleges that
Michftsd molested him.
Ti that it (points |.. is that what you
see? Because if that's all you see, well, then you
don't realty see meMMk
—Mel Gibson, "Man Without A Voce*'
Justin McCloud (Mel Gibson) lives
apart from everyone else in a grand
house, hiding his scarred face from
the world. He loves animals — he has only a
dog and a horse for company. McCloud also
loves children, having been a schoolteacher
for several years, until allegations of sexual
abuse destroyed his career and put him in
prison. But he's a performer at heart, never

more alive than when he acts out scenes from
Shakespeare plays for an audience of one.
Yes, Michael's plight is mirrored in the
film "Man Without A Face," in which Gibson
is accused of molesting a boy whom he tu
tors. But the differences between Michael's
life and the film are far more instructiveas to
why he may never fully convince the public
of his i|uiQceri|e. In the Isabelle Holland
novel upon which the film is based, Mc«
Cloud isflot only gay, but he has a homosex
ual episode with a student. In the film, how
ever, his character is portrayed as ruggedly
heterosexual he's got a bass-laden voice,
he rides horses and was once married— and
there isn't a hint of impropriety with the boy.
In contrast* Michael has never seemed to
have a serious female love interest. As of his
recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, he's
still a gentleman (read: virgin). He sings in a
high falsetto, his hair reaches down to his
shoulders and he's rebuilt his face to look like
Janet's fair-skinned twin. Gibson, it seems, is
far more canny in the (reconstruction of

McCloud; no androgynous, crotch-grab
bing theatrics for this lethal weapon.
"Man Without A Face" is just as instruc
tive about the consequences of such allega
tions: McCloud is ordered to have no fur
ther contact with his student; eventually, he
moves away. But even though we know that
he's innocent the film, we begin to doubt
ourselves. When the child sneaks out to see
McCloud after they've been told not see
each other, and the sheriff comes upon them
hugging each oth|r, we cringe, because we
know how it mustiook, despite McCloud's
carefully constructed "normality."
Michael doesn't haVe that kind of control
over his image. And the media, in its rush to
judgement, isn't interested in the truth —
they just wanttolcnow whether he's danger
ous or just off the wall. So they endlessly re
cycle their reductive descriptions of
Michael: weird, tortured, elfin, shy, child
like, abnormal, wacko, providing us with a
persona that conveniently fits our stereo
type of a child molester. That's all we can see.
And if that is all we can see, do we really
see him? |
All children, except one, grow up.
