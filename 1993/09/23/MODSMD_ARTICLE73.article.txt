# Sunday samplings on the screen
## 
### Ed Yoon 
It's Sunday and the awful realization that you
haven't considered anything even remotely
linked to the humanities or the sciences since
2:05 Friday afternoon is mildly disconcerting. In
fact, it's damn frightening. "Gotta lock myself up
and study," you mumble. Too late.
Your friends have found you. You whine about
your problems sets and tests and papers, but you
know it's hopeless: it's the weekend's last hurrah,
and you just can't hide.
Of course, no one goes to Flicks to just watch a
movie. You can go to Blockbuster, rent one and
stick it into your box at home. Might as well talk
to yourself, too. But at Flicks, you can watch peo
ple with 1,400 SATs and 3.7 GPAs in high school
throw paper and laugh maniacally at Bugs Bunny
cartoon shorts in an orgy of infantile reversion.
Flicks has always been a torum for baser forms
of behavior. Last spring a slate running for ASSU
Council of Presidents streaked the stage in a bid
for election. They lost, but so what? And there's
always lively commentary from the audience
during ihe film, some of it funny, some of it pret
ty damn stupid.
Since the price of a Flicks pass beats any other
deal to a bloody pulp, there's no reason for you
frosh not to get one. When you get to become
world-weary seniors and your rotator cuff can't
take throwing paper anymore, then maybe you
won't need one.
We have a delectable lineup of films this quar
ter, a nice mixture of recent releases and old
timers. Here they are:
Indecent Proposal, Oct. 3: Woody Harrelson
gets all bent out of shape because he thinks his
wife Demi Moore, sporting her new silicone
blobs, might be schtupping Robert Redford. I
forget if he pays her or she pays him or if Woody
pays Rob. A moral film of Bergman-like dimen
sions, this is what they used to call "thought pro
voking."
Dave, Oct. 10: Kevin Kline looks just like the
president, but he's a nice, honest guy. A true fairy

tale, "Dave" is what's known as a "nice" comedy,
and stars real Congresspeople playing themselves
and Stanford grad Sigourney Weaver as the first
lady.
Cliffhanger, Oct. 17: Sly Stallone grunts and
flexes his pecs in the great outdoors against bad
die John Lithgow, who sports a crappy British ac
cent. Janine Turner from "Northern Exposure"
plays Sly's girlfriend and bad-guy punching bag.
Shot in the Italian Dolomite mountains, the
scenery is inspiring, the acting less so.
Like Water for Chocolate, Oct. 24: A sleep
er hit, both at the box office and bookstores (in
both Spanish and English). "Like Water for
Chocolate" deals with lush magical-realism top
ics such as unrequited love, the art of fine dining
and the link between the two. Haven't met a soul
who disliked this one. Sorry, no stars in this one,
and yeah, you have to read subtitles.
Taxi Driver, Oct. 25: A lean, mean Bobby De
Niro in a classic Scorsese New York story. Also
stars a pubescent Jody Foster and pre-Moon
lighting Cybil Shepherd. 'Nuff said.
Menace II Society, Oct. 31: Two 21-year-old
brothers, Allen and Albert Hughes, shot their
first film venture about the agony of urban black
life in Los Angeles. An unflinching "Boyz 'N the
Hood" without stabilizers, fillers or sweeteners.
Man Bites Dog, Nov. 7: Shot in a documen
tary style, this controversial Belgian flick has a
threadbare plot: the death-to-death life of a so
ciopath and the various ways he assaults people.
Unique, often absurdist and probably disturbing.
Sleepless in Seattle, Nov. 14: Nora Ephron,
queen of Hollywood schmaltz, packs in scenes
with doe-eyed Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan until
you can't take it anymore. Tom plays the insom
niac widower who blabs over the radio airwaves
about his plight, and Meg Ryan his trans conti

nental admirer.
In The Line of Fire, Nov. 21: They all thought
Clint was ripe for the nursing home until he
roared back with "Unforgiven" and this unsur
prising but serviceable story of a geriatric Secret
Service man up against a meticulous psychopath
and an unlikely romance with a very young Rene
Russo. John Malkovich plays the bored psycho
and nearly robs the show from Flinty.
The Killer, Nov. 29: Bullets fly as fast as the
Cantonese in this film directed by recent Holly
wood immigrant John Woo, often dubbed the
grand duke of action films. Chow Yun Fat (that's
his name) plays a debonair and lethal assassin
who wants to hang up his gun, but he has to save
a couple rounds — make that a couple thousand
— for his treacherous employers, and a cop called
Dumbo. Eye-popping action.
The Firm, Dec. 5: Tom Cruise plays yet an
other youthful firebrand who needs to grow up.
As a lawyer who unwittingly ends up in a firm
that does more than chase ambulances, Cruise
will probably be playing these roles until he's eat
ing Metamucil and worrying about his prostate.
Wilford Brimley stars as the bad guy, but he
doesn't eat any Quaker oats.
Heathers, Dec. 12: A classic that launched
Winona Ryder's and Christian Slater's careers
into the stratosphere and Shannon Doherty
into the Beverly Hills area code. Slater sounds
like a mini-Jack Nicholson while wooing a
waifish pre-siliconized Winona during this tale
of naughty white-bread prep-school cruelty
with surrealist touches and plenty of black
humor.

Flicks show in Memorial Auditorium at 7p. m. and
10 p.m. on Sundays and on Mondays when there
are no classes. Passes for the quarter cost $18 and
are available in White Plaza, through resident as
sistants and at the door.

gets all bent out of shape because he thinks his
wife Demi Moore, sporting her new silicone
blobs, might be schtupping Robert Redford. I
forget if he pays her or she pays him or if Woody
pays Rob. A moral film of Bergman-like dimen
sions, this is what they used to call "thought pro
voking."
Dave, Oct. 10: Kevin Kline looks just like the
president, but he's a nice, honest guy. A true fairy

tale, "Dave" is what's known as a "nice" comedy,
and stars real Congresspeople playing themselves
and Stanford grad Sigourney Weaver as the first
lady.
Cliffhanger, Oct. 17: Sly Stallone grunts and
flexes his pecs in the great outdoors against bad
die John Lithgow, who sports a crappy British ac
cent. Janine Turner from "Northern Exposure"
plays Sly's girlfriend and bad-guy punching bag.
Shot in the Italian Dolomite mountains, the
scenery is inspiring, the acting less so.
Like Water for Chocolate, Oct. 24: A sleep
er hit, both at the box office and bookstores (in
both Spanish and English). "Like Water for
Chocolate" deals with lush magical-realism top
ics such as unrequited love, the art of fine dining
and the link between the two. Haven't met a soul
who disliked this one. Sorry, no stars in this one,
and yeah, you have to read subtitles.
Taxi Driver, Oct. 25: A lean, mean Bobby De
Niro in a classic Scorsese New York story. Also
stars a pubescent Jody Foster and pre-Moon
lighting Cybil Shepherd. 'Nuff said.
Menace II Society, Oct. 31: Two 21-year-old
brothers, Allen and Albert Hughes, shot their
first film venture about the agony of urban black
life in Los Angeles. An unflinching "Boyz 'N the
Hood" without stabilizers, fillers or sweeteners.
Man Bites Dog, Nov. 7: Shot in a documen
tary style, this controversial Belgian flick has a
threadbare plot: the death-to-death life of a so
ciopath and the various ways he assaults people.
Unique, often absurdist and probably disturbing.
Sleepless in Seattle, Nov. 14: Nora Ephron,
queen of Hollywood schmaltz, packs in scenes
with doe-eyed Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan until
you can't take it anymore. Tom plays the insom
niac widower who blabs over the radio airwaves
about his plight, and Meg Ryan his trans conti

nental admirer.
In The Line of Fire, Nov. 21: They all thought
Clint was ripe for the nursing home until he
roared back with "Unforgiven" and this unsur
prising but serviceable story of a geriatric Secret
Service man up against a meticulous psychopath
and an unlikely romance with a very young Rene
Russo. John Malkovich plays the bored psycho
and nearly robs the show from Flinty.
The Killer, Nov. 29: Bullets fly as fast as the
Cantonese in this film directed by recent Holly
wood immigrant John Woo, often dubbed the
grand duke of action films. Chow Yun Fat (that's
his name) plays a debonair and lethal assassin
who wants to hang up his gun, but he has to save
a couple rounds — make that a couple thousand
— for his treacherous employers, and a cop called
Dumbo. Eye-popping action.
The Firm, Dec. 5: Tom Cruise plays yet an
other youthful firebrand who needs to grow up.
As a lawyer who unwittingly ends up in a firm
that does more than chase ambulances, Cruise
will probably be playing these roles until he's eat
ing Metamucil and worrying about his prostate.
Wilford Brimley stars as the bad guy, but he
doesn't eat any Quaker oats.
Heathers, Dec. 12: A classic that launched
Winona Ryder's and Christian Slater's careers
into the stratosphere and Shannon Doherty
into the Beverly Hills area code. Slater sounds
like a mini-Jack Nicholson while wooing a
waifish pre-siliconized Winona during this tale
of naughty white-bread prep-school cruelty
with surrealist touches and plenty of black
humor.

Flicks show in Memorial Auditorium at 7p. m. and
10 p.m. on Sundays and on Mondays when there
are no classes. Passes for the quarter cost $18 and
are available in White Plaza, through resident as
sistants and at the door.

It's Sunday and the awful realization that you
haven't considered anything even remotely
linked to the humanities or the sciences since
2:05 Friday afternoon is mildly disconcerting. In
fact, it's damn frightening. "Gotta lock myself up
and study," you mumble. Too late.
Your friends have found you. You whine about
your problems sets and tests and papers, but you
know it's hopeless: it's the weekend's last hurrah,
and you just can't hide.
Of course, no one goes to Flicks to just watch a
movie. You can go to Blockbuster, rent one and
stick it into your box at home. Might as well talk
to yourself, too. But at Flicks, you can watch peo
ple with 1,400 SATs and 3.7 GPAs in high school
throw paper and laugh maniacally at Bugs Bunny
cartoon shorts in an orgy of infantile reversion.
Flicks has always been a torum for baser forms
of behavior. Last spring a slate running for ASSU
Council of Presidents streaked the stage in a bid
for election. They lost, but so what? And there's
always lively commentary from the audience
during ihe film, some of it funny, some of it pret
ty damn stupid.
Since the price of a Flicks pass beats any other
deal to a bloody pulp, there's no reason for you
frosh not to get one. When you get to become
world-weary seniors and your rotator cuff can't
take throwing paper anymore, then maybe you
won't need one.
We have a delectable lineup of films this quar
ter, a nice mixture of recent releases and old
timers. Here they are:
