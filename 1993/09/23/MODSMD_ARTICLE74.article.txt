# John Woo: Stranger in a familiar land
## 
### Victor Haseman 
Out in front of the AMC Kabuki Eight
Theater, none of us knew the color of
the sky. And we didn't care. We were
united singularly, if only for 90 minutes, in
spirit and in mission — getting to the theater
at the end of the corridor, with the tiny sign
reading "Hard Target," before half-past
seven.
Objective reached, my associates and I set
tled into four seats amid a throng of free
lance movie critics curious to see how Hong
Kong filmmaker John Woo's first American
feature would fare, along with parent-tug
ging Jean-Claude Van Damme fans and curi
ous tag-alongs, who weren't quite sure what
they were getting into.
I fell into the free-lance category. My
friends, chums from high-school days, were
strictly taggers, albeit well-informed ones. I'd
been tugging coats to the delectable absurdi
ty of Woo action flicks ever since I saw "The
Killer" (1989) and "Hard Boiled" (1990)
nine months earlier. That night, my preach
ing would either pay off or explode in my
face.
After watching Van Damme purge a law
less New Orleans of a rotten bunch of
scoundrels headed up by Lance Henrikson
("Dog Day Afternoon," "Jennifer Eight")
with a lotta help from Woo, we left the the
ater g'ggl' n g like a bunch of characters fresh
ly escaped from a "Beavis and Butthead"
episode.
"Hard Target" wasn't as good as either of
Woo's Hong Kong films, but the feeling was
the same. He has a way of complicating the
simplest action sequences (say a lone guy tak
ing out 10 thugs) in the most unique ways
imaginable, transforming episodes of brute
savagery into delicate ballets of organized
chaos. And he never chokes. Never.
"When I'm shooting an action sequence, I
feel like I'm making a dance routine. Every
thing's got to be perfect and I need to show
enough coverage. So I set up six or seven
cameras for a sequence to show the same ac
tion from many different angles. Then I just
choose the pieces and cut them to music to
find a musical rhythm."
I'm still thinking about organized chaos
when a glass of water is placed before me
on a coffee table. Woo sits across the table
musing about how comfy a San Francisco
summer afternoon can feel after a couple of
sticky months in Louisiana filming "Hard
Target." Nothing about Woo — not his small
frame, his "Froggy from 'Our Gang' " bari
tone, his ensemble of sensible, semi-business

separates nor his disarming graciousness —
says "master of ultraviolent pop art." I was
expecting twisted daemonic genius. I got
hard-working family man.
Steering the conversation from our sur
roundings to the importance of music in his
films, I notice that Woo is half-consciously
fidgeting with a pack of cigarettes and a
lighter on the coffee table in front of him.
Eloquence in Mandarin Chinese is easy, hut
in broken English it's a drag he'd just as soon
ditch. If he wasn't so polite, a few pulls on a
cig might help him regroup his thoughts. He
abstains and struggles on.
"I always try to use Western music in my
movies, since my themes and directing
(style) arc very close to Western culture. But
it's hard to do this all of the time because it's
hard to capture the feelings of jazz — the ro
manticism, the blueness, the happiness and
the sadness."
Then again, when Woo uses jazz the way
he likes to, it's often unappreciated. In an
early preview of "Hard Target," one memo
rable sequence (a wild mixture of patented
Van Damme roundhouses and slow-motion
editing) featured a Louis Armstrong-esque
number. But the fighting Dutchman's

younger fans couldn't relate. It was shafted
for a more Bon Jovi sound. Even in Hong
Kong, where he has enjoyed total artistic free
dom and record-breaking box office receipts,
audiences haven't gone for jazz.
"Audiences don't like subtle. They go for
the music of great impact. In a big action
scene, they like the 'Rah! Rah!' of hero-type
music. What I like to do is use music, espe
cially jazz, to give my movies more soul."
And soul they have. Woo tells twisted,
tragic tales of loyalty and honor,
where forces of good and evil meet,
shake hands and come out blasting.
In "The Killer," a hired gun (Chow Yun
Fat) dusts his Glock off one last time to pay
for an eye operation for a nightclub singer
he accidentally injured during a job gone
sour. The sentiment is noble; only everyone
wants him to fail. An obsessive renegade cop
(Danny Lee) is aiming to bring our anti
hero to justice, while the double-crossing,
paranoid-stricken crime boss who hired
him wants him six feet under. "The Killer" is
bloody and spiritual and melodramatic and
complicated and confusing and corny all at
once. I dare you to beat it.

More importantly, "The Kiiier" garnered
Woo the kind of global recognition from fans
and critics alike that prompted Universal
Studios to hire him for "Hard Target." So
with long-time producing partner Terrence
Chang in tow, Woo headed for California and
his first taste of Hollywood studio filmmak
ing.
"In two and a half years, I have received
over 40 scripts. 'Hard Target' had the best
theme. It's about man hunting man and the
cruelness of the world. Also, (screenwriter)
Chuck Pfarrer provided a lot of great action
elements."
Humility aside, Pfarrer may have
penned "Hard Target," but the fin
ished product was as original a Woo
film as any of his Hong Kong efforts. Pro
pelled from scene to scene by the kind of
stunts that only little boys dream of, the
screenplay's major problems (dialogue and
story continuity) loiter on the sidelines
where they can't offend anyone. It's the per
fect setup for a mixed cast of actors (Henrik
son) and posturers (Van Damme and Yancy
Butler); actions invariably speak louder than
lines. And from all accounts, Woo had a blast
making it happen — even if nine producers
really aren't better than one.
"I haven't gotten used to the system here
yet. In Hong Kong, I had total freedom be
cause I produced my own films. Everything
was simpler because we just aimed to make
good movies. The studio had confidence in
me."
All right. So the concept of the studio as
Big Brother takes some getting used to for the
auteur accustomed to getting six-month
shooting schedules (not eight weeks). No one
ever said showing your producers daily
footage of a work in progress would be
thrilling. Just ask Spike Lee.
"Still," Woo grins, "I feel much happier
hen- than in Hong Kong. Even though the
system is difficult, I got great support from
the studio. They provided me with whatever
I wanted. Of course, within the budget. Also
I find the people here more professional,
more dedicated. And they have more passion
for film."
What remains to be seen is the effect
"Hard Target" will have on traditional Amer
ican action audiences. Sure, Woo has pocket
fuls of fans ... on the coasts, where Asian
film festivals frequent headline marquees. It's
America's midriff he's got to worry about.
Someone better tell Jean-Claude to kick
harder. ■
