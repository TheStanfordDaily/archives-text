# Avoiding Stanford's idea of fun — ways to escape CIV
## Story by Angie Chuang Photos by Patrick Tower

Stanford seemed like such a fun place
during Orientation.But the blissful first
two weeks of school have flown by, and
you're starting to notice that nobody's telling
you how lucky you arc to be a freshman. Your
study list is due in 15 minutes and Axess is still
a mystery, "Cultures, Ideas and Values"
turned out to be a fancy term for "A whole
buttload of reading," and you nearly lost your
Wilbur spinach-cheese loaf when you discov
ered your first midterm is in a week.
Suddenly, Stanford — the expansive Cali
fornia paradise with its tawny stucco arches
and palm trees extending as far as the eye can
see — seems, well, a little cramped. Claustro
phobic, even. Let's face the truth: You've got to
get out.
But no well-planned escape can be com
plete without a destination. So with the help
of this handy guide, start planning your
study-recuperation hours now.
Once you've successfully fled and crossed
the official "off-campus" line where Palm
Drive turns into University Avenue, Palo Alto
offers a small sampling of hangouts and en
tertainment — many within biking distance.
But if you're really itching to temporarily
make Stanford a distant memory, the approx
imate half-hour (sans traffic) drive or Cal-
Train ride up to San Francisco will immerse
you in rich and colorful urban night life with
endless possibilities. The choice is yours.
Palo Alto
So Palo Alto isn't exactly what Greenwich
Village is for NYU and downtown Berkeley is
for that other school across the Bay. But a lit
tle investigating will get you beyond that Taco
Bell on El Camino.
Bars and movie theaters probably consti
tute the two most abundant forms of night life
in Palo Alto and its vicinity. Both tend to re
flect Palo Alto's small-town, suburban atmos
phere.
Stanford hangouts lean toward the small,
crowded beer-and-burger joints, the epitome
of which is The Oasis on El Camino. Even the

walls are greasy at this
loud and friendly
place, which frequently
broadcasts Stanford
sporting events.
The Stanford Pub
(on Emerson) offers a
casual atmosphere,
and is well-known for
its burgers. Another

quintessential Stanford hangout, The Dutch
Goose in Menlo Park (on Alameda De Las
Pulgas), is affectionately referred to as "The
Goose."
With regard to movie theaters, University
Avenue and thereabouts remain a bastion of
the quaint and non-mainstream. The Stan
ford Theater (University) has become a fa
vorite place to wax nostalgic or to take a first
date (yes, there really are those lucky few at
Stanford who date). After all, the lavish art
deco interior, live organ music and classic
films can bring out the sentimental side of
anyone.
If you enjoy quality foreign films, look no
further than the Aquarius (on Emerson). And
the Varsity (University) shows more popular
"artsy" flicks, as well as "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show" — complete with a live, unso
licited cast — on Fridays and Saturdays at
midnight. "Rocky Horror" is a burlesque ex
perience not to be missed. However, the Var
sity s shows tend to be a little less rambunc
tious and outrageous than the Berkeley show
at the UC Theater, often touted as the original
"Rocky."
Hollywood box-office hits show at the Palo
Alto Square (El Camino at Page Mill) and the
multi-multi-screen Century 10 in Mountain
View (Shoreline Blvd.). However, Century 10-
goers beware: on weekends, the place is over
run by hordes of local residents.
Dance club options in Palo Alto arc limit
ed, but The Edge (California) is about as
dance-clubby as they get. An 18-and-over
modern/alternative rock club, the crowd is
young and sometimes predominantly high
school, but the atmosphere is lively and
friendly, rhc Edge also hosts regular live
bands, attracting some reasonably big-name
groups and artists.
L.A. Fox (El Camino) offers dancing to
Fop-40 tunes in a bar-like setting. Or, if an
urban atmosphere is more your style, cross
the Bayshore Freeway to East Palo Alto and
Club Afriquc (O'Connor), which plays an in
ternational range of music from reggae to
salsa.

Live music venues
aren't exactly abun
dant in Palo Alto, but
a few local clubs gen
erally offer a more in
timate atmosphere
than San Francisco's
larger, more-crowded
spaces.
Caft Montmartrc

(University) features local favorite "The Ba
sics," an acoustic-based group, as well as other
artists in a chic setting. St. Michaels Alley
(Emerson) also offers a good sampling of local
musicians, and is open every night.
Jazz aficionados can check out The Gate
house (Lytton) and Jose's Caribbean Restau
rant (El Camino). For those who prefer a little
international flavor, Jose's also has samba,
salsa and reggae nights.
A few small companies headline local the
ater, most notably Theatre Works, which per
forms in Mountain View and Palo Alto, and
-the historic Palo Alto Players Guild, which
takes the stage at the Lucie Stern Theater
(Middlefield).
San Francisco
When Palo Alto starts seeming a bit too
small (as it often does), "The City" — as true
Bay Area residents call it, not "S.F." or the god
awful "Frisco" — offers a wide variety of en
tertainment as diverse as its many districts.
While there are no cut-and-dry bound
aries, each area of The City has its own dis
tinctive character, and its establishments re
flect this. Even a compilation of "War and
Peace" proportions could not cover all of the
great bars, clubs and venues in The City, so the
best way to go is to pick a district and explore.
Market and North of Market
If there's a main drag in San Francisco, it's
the ever-busy Market, which cuts a neat diag
onal slash across the east side of the city. Mar
ket between Civic Center (Van Ness) and the
downtownyfinancial district area (Battery) is
usually considered the cultural center of the
city.
Civic Center features all the uppcrcrust en
tertainment an intellectual could ask for, in
cluding the city's opera company, symphony
and ballet venues, all located on Van Ness Av
enue.
Market and North of Market bring togeth
er an interesting mix of yuppies from the fi
nancial district, young people from all over the
Bay Area flocking to the big-name clubs and
politicians from the city's political club
(whom you're more likely to find at five-star
restaurants than bars and clubs, however).
Perhaps San Francisco's most high-profile
live music venue, The Warfield (Sixth and
Market) attracts big names and big crowds,
and has no minimum-age requirement for ad
mission. A few blocks north of Civic Center,
The Great American Music Hall (O'Farrell

near Polk) tends to have slightly more off-beat
billings, but is well-attended.
A paradox brought to life, The Upper
Room (Grove at Market) is the city's first alco
hol and tobacco-free nightclub. The music
tends toward rap and Top 40 R&B.
The place for jazz is Kimball's (Grove at
Market), a club as popular as its star-laden
billings. North of downtown heading into
North Beach, Pearl's (Columbus near Broad
way) approaches Kimball's legendary status.
One of the city's largest dance clubs, The
Palladium (Kearney near Broadway) attracts a
young 18-and-over crowd and plays modern
rock into the wee hours of the morning. The
Palladium attracts some big-name Bay Area
DJs, but like many mainstream dance clubs,
tends to be somewhat of a meat market.
San Francisco's most well-known comedi
ans can be seen north of Market at The Im
prov (Mason near Geary) and The Punch Line
(Battery between Washington and Clay).
Though not in the downtown area, Cobb's
Comedy Club completes the mainstream
comedy triumvirate, offering one of the few
incentives to venture into the Cannery, on the
tourist-infested Fisherman's Wharf.
To see one of the most-renowned regional
theater companies, head on over to San Fran
cisco's American Conservatory Theater
(Geary at Mason). The talented and increas
ingly diversified company performs a wide

range of works, from
the classic to the
modern, as well as
seasonal traditions,
such as the annual
run of "A Christmas
Carol."
SoMa
Borrowing from a
New York naming
tradition of calling
the neighborhood
South of Houston
Street "SoHo," South

of Market is at least as colorful and lively as its
Manhattan counterpart. Like SoHo, the
young and offbeat tend to flock to SoMa, and
the community's diversity is amazing.
Gays and straights of all races, rich and
poor, convene South of Market for its wide
range of distinctive quality night life. There's
truly something for everyone.
Live music venues abound in SoMa, often
attracting top billings as well as up-and-com
ing local bands. The only drawbacks are that
cover charges tend to be high, and many places
enforce a strict 21-and-over policy, complete
with superhumanly large bouncers at the
door.
A long-standing city favorite, Slim's (11th

between Folsom and Harrison) always packs a
crowd in with its impressive billings. The DNA
Lounge (11 th near Folsom) and the Paradise
Lounge (11th and Folsom) are also popular
spots for live pop, punk and hip-hop.
Very South of Market lies a cozy, dark,
bouncer-free little bar called Bottom of the
Hill (17th at Texas), which hosts local bands
and has good beer, the likes of Anchor Steam
and Red Hook, on tap at great prices.
If you're looking to shake your thang in the
city, SoMa boasts perhaps the largest concen
tration of 18-and-over dance clubs. You can
dance with a view of the stars at DVB (Howard
between Ist and 2nd), which features an ultra
modern dance floor design and modern rock
(mixed with house music and disco) to match.
Other well-known dance clubs include
Club Mirage (Kansas at Division), and The X
(Harrison at 3rd), which plays modern rock or
hip-hop, depending on which night you go. If
you long to whip out those bell-bottoms and
tromp around in platform clogs, Club 1970
(Howard between 2nd and 3rd), though not
the institution it is in Los Angeles, will provide
a disco fix.
SoMa is often characterized as a gay-but
not-exclusively-gay neighborhood, as reflect
ed by many of its establishments. Perhaps
more than any other neighborhood, gays and
straights party together without obvious sep
arations.
Ask San Franciscans to name a gay bar, and
they'll probably tell you about the unmistak
ably green, wooden building that looks like an
old-West saloon, The Stud (9th and Harri
son). This bar and dance club is a big, loud and
friendly place where you'll find a fairly mixed
crowd of men and women, gays and straights.
The Elbo Room (Valencia at 20th) has a simi
lar atmosphere, as well as quality live perfor
