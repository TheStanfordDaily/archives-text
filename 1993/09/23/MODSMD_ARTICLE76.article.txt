# Out of the dorm and into the night... Venue-hopping on campus

### Linda Friedlieb 
You came to Stanford for the acade
mics, for the weather, for the prestige,
maybe even for the football team (just
maybe). But there's more to life on the Farm
than sunshine, studying and sports.
For those who have an ultra-fuzzy bent or
just an appreciation for things deemed artis
tic, there's a plethora of on-campus amuse
ments to occupy the time that might be
more productively spent reading Aristotle.
Your first taste of Stanford's arts might
come during Orientation when a group of
people pop into your first house meeting
(they're usually several hours long) and sing
a few songs a cappella. Many groups (both
single-sex and mixed) spread their own
brand of music — and often their humor —
in scheduled shows and dorm visits
throughout the year.
From the religious tone of Testimony to
the international flavor of Talisman to the
tradition of the Mendicants, Stanford's first
a cappella phenomenon, these baritones,
altos and sopranos provide many needed
study breaks.
But if you're not into group sings, croon
ers abound at the Coffee House, where
melodies can make your cappuccino go
down smoothly. In addition, the Stanford
Concert Network arranges and subsidizes
many concerts (past performers have in

cluded Toad the Wet Sprocket and The Sam
ples) throughout the year. Scheduled con
certs this year attempt to satisfy every taste,
including everything from the Cajun blues
of Tab (Oct. 1) to the reggae of Inca Inca
(Sept. 27).
For music sans words, the Stanford Sympho
ny Orchestra and the Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching Band provide
two extremely different sounds.
While the Band is likely to pop up playing
"All Right Now" in its customary disorderly
fashion, the symphony schedules regular
concerts complete with varied programs of
classical works.
In addition, The Lively Arts at Stanford
brings entertainment in all forms to
campus life. Performances to anticipate
include the juggling of the Flying Karamazov
Brothers (Oct. 8) and the jazz-modern
dance combination of the Wynton Marsalis
Septet and Garth Fagan Dance (Oct. 19).
Other upcoming dance performances in
clude Spring Migration, an annual extrava
ganza choreographed and performed by stu
dents. In addition, Stanford boasts numerous
"ethnic" dance troupes including the skirts
and sombreros of El Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford and Kuumba Dance Ensemble, a group
which specializes in African and African-

American dance
traditions.
Some interac
tive annual
traditions
include the Rag
time Ball for those
who love to swing
and the Viennese
Ball for waltzing
fools. Required
equipment for the
latter event in
cludes a sleeping
bag, as students
oftentimes camp
out to ensure
themselves tick
ets.
Yet another
on-campus diver
sion is the Mau
soleum party
which is held (you
guessed it) at the

Stanford Mausoleum on Halloween each
year. Crazy costumes, music and dancing
abound. Go to see and be seen.
Several organizations stage plays and mu
sicals for those who just want to watch.
Rams Head, a student-run organization,
produces three of Stanford's annual enter
tainment institutions — Big Game Gaieties

in November, Winter
One Acts during win
ter quarter and the
spring musical,
which in 1994 will be
"Guys and Dolls."
Each year's Gai
eties boasts an origi
nal script which usu
ally hinges on the
premise that Stan
ford is awesome and
Cal (in other words,
UC-Berkeley) is full
of weenies — perfect
for psyching every
one up for Big Game.

In addition to
Ram's Head, the Drama Department stages
several plays each year, giving their acting
and technical students a chance to strut their
stuff.
This year's performances will include
"Crux," an April Deangeles play set in a me-

dieval village, and"The Little Tommy Park
er Celebrated Colored Minstrel Show,"
which examines the lives of African-Ameri
can minstrels touring the United States dur
ing the late 19th century.
Other dramatic (and comedic) perfor
mances throughout the year will come from
the Women's Performance Collective and
the Gilbert-and-Sullivan performances of
the Stanford Savo-

yards.
Less-structured
theater is also pre
sented at Stanford by
improvisatory
groups. Spontaneous
Generation (Sponge)
and the Stanford Im
provisers (Simps)
each provoke lots of
laughter with their
skits and games. Be
prepared to become
part of the fun by
yelling out sugges-

tions and getting in
volved in games; participation is more than
half the fun.
For whatever reason you chose Stanford,
take advantage of more than just your pro
fessors. Every once in a while, forget study
ing and entertain yourself instead. ■
