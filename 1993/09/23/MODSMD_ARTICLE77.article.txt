# True romance
## Martin Scorsese's 'Age of Innocence' 
### 
Almost reprising Louis Malle's "Dam
age," Newland Archer (Daniel Day-
Lewis) looks into the eyes of Count
ess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) and
finds love at first sight. But this isn't the
20th-century England of "Damage." It's
turn-of-the-century New York, where the
Archers are one of the city's most respected
families, so it wouldn't do for Newland to
adopt Jeremy Irons' reckless abandon. Be
sides, he doesn't even realize that he's in love
until much later.
He can't fool us, though. Newland an
nounces his engagement to May Welland
(Winona Ryder) to stifle gossip about
Ellen's impending divorce. He goes to high
society's equi/aknt of a Mafia godfather
and asks him to broker Ellen's acceptance
into the socially closed ranks. To modern
day audiences, these might seem like the
actions of a gentleman. But in the world of
author Edith Wharton, where the slightest
gesture speaks volumes, Newland's actions
add up to a declaration of love — a love that
can't be consummated without declaring
war on the world they live in.
"Age" inverts the premise of "Goodfel
lasin which Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) was
an outsider who wanted in. Newland is an
insider who wants out. But his goal is no
less dangerous — the world he lives in is as
complex and treacherous as any director
Martin Scorsese has ever created. Its
denizens are as tribal and violent as the
thugs of "Goodfellas," but their weapons
are carefully couched barbs, gossip and,
worst of all, complete ostracism. It isn't
surprising that Scorsese wanted to make
this film. Though he doesn't jump to mind
as the director of this Merchant-Ivory-type

period piece, the themes — repression,
honor and the conflict between love and
duty — are pure Scorsese. He boldly goes
where angels fear to tread and proves him
self right at home.
Armed with one of the largest budgets
of his career, Scorsese painstakingly repro
duces the period, from the restrictive
clothing and lavish homes to the place set
tings for a 13-course formal dinner. He
doesn't simply use the production design
as a backdrop; every painting, every piece
of jewelry has a purpose, and the camera
obsessively seeks out each one, over
whelming us with the sheer volume of de
tail. And where Merchant-Ivory might be
content to direct the film in a classical,
stately manner, allowing the script and the
acting to tell the story by themselves,
Scorsese's direction is like that of a raging
bull in a china shop, shaking up Wharton's
genteel world with all of his favorite tricks
— slow-motion shots, quick cuts and rad
ical changes in lighting — to get his points
across.
But his love for this world is purely aes
thetic, so the tragedy affects us intellectual
ly, not emotionally. The first line in "Good
fellas" is "Ever since 1 was a kid, I wanted to
be a gangster," and Scorsese identifies
strongly with that statement, displaying an
enormous amount of affection and am
bivalence toward each of the hoods in his
film. Here, neither he nor Wharton respect
this society or its traditions. They recreate
it only to mock it, and if they don't care for
it, why should we?
In that vein, Joanne Woodward's narra
tion — taken verbatim from the novel —
doesn't work at all. Scorsese fs a past master

at using narration; in
"Goodfellas" and "Taxi
Driver," the voice
overs deepened our
understanding of the
characters because a
personage from within
the story acts as narra
tor. In "Age," the narra
tor isn't a character;
she's an outside voice
explaining events and
telling us what to
think, alternating be
tween play-by-play
commentary and pa
tronizing editorials.
The acting, though
always adequate, is
largely hit-or-miss.
Pfeiffer fails to eroti
cize the threat she
poses to Newland,
coming across as a
wounded free spirit
instead. And while
Winona Ryder seems

more concerned about her accent than her
acting (admittedly, the script doesn't make
much use of her) she rises to the occasion
toward the end, inexorably shattering
Newland's dream of a life spent with Ellen.
Daniel Day-Lewis is left to carry the
emotional core of the film. His stunning
portrayal of Newland combines Travis
Biclde's repression ("Taxi Driver") with
Jesus' longing for a different life ("The Last
Temptation of Christ") to create a 19th
century version of God's lonely man. It's a
difficult task to portray both Newland's

inner strength and his inability to defy the
rules of the world he lives in, but Day-Lewis
pulls it off with a subtle aplomb that he
hasn't had to use since "The Unbearable
Lightness of Being."
"Age of Innocence" has many things to
recommend it, but emotional impact isn't
one of them. Now that Scorsese has proven
that he can tackle drawing-room politics,
he ought to return to New York's meaner
streets. It's a stage where he can rage more
effectively.

Newland's dream of a life spent with Ellen.
Daniel Day-Lewis is left to carry the
emotional core of the film. His stunning
portrayal of Newland combines Travis
Biclde's repression ("Taxi Driver") with
Jesus' longing for a different life ("The Last
Temptation of Christ") to create a 19th
century version of God's lonely man. It's a
difficult task to portray both Newland's

inner strength and his inability to defy the
rules of the world he lives in, but Day-Lewis
pulls it off with a subtle aplomb that he
hasn't had to use since "The Unbearable
Lightness of Being."
"Age of Innocence" has many things to
recommend it, but emotional impact isn't
one of them. Now that Scorsese has proven
that he can tackle drawing-room politics,
he ought to return to New York's meaner
streets. It's a stage where he can rage more
effectively.

Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis) and Ellen Olenska
(Michelle Pfeiffer) share a stolen moment in Martin Scorsese's
"Age of Innocence."
Almost reprising Louis Malle's "Dam
age," Newland Archer (Daniel Day-
Lewis) looks into the eyes of Count
ess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) and
finds love at first sight. But this isn't the
20th-century England of "Damage." It's
turn-of-the-century New York, where the
Archers are one of the city's most respected
families, so it wouldn't do for Newland to
adopt Jeremy Irons' reckless abandon. Be
sides, he doesn't even realize that he's in love
until much later.
He can't fool us, though. Newland an
nounces his engagement to May Welland
(Winona Ryder) to stifle gossip about
Ellen's impending divorce. He goes to high
society's equi/aknt of a Mafia godfather
and asks him to broker Ellen's acceptance
into the socially closed ranks. To modern
day audiences, these might seem like the
actions of a gentleman. But in the world of
author Edith Wharton, where the slightest
gesture speaks volumes, Newland's actions
add up to a declaration of love — a love that
can't be consummated without declaring
war on the world they live in.
"Age" inverts the premise of "Goodfel
lasin which Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) was
an outsider who wanted in. Newland is an
insider who wants out. But his goal is no
less dangerous — the world he lives in is as
complex and treacherous as any director
Martin Scorsese has ever created. Its
denizens are as tribal and violent as the
thugs of "Goodfellas," but their weapons
are carefully couched barbs, gossip and,
worst of all, complete ostracism. It isn't
surprising that Scorsese wanted to make
this film. Though he doesn't jump to mind
as the director of this Merchant-Ivory-type

period piece, the themes — repression,
honor and the conflict between love and
duty — are pure Scorsese. He boldly goes
where angels fear to tread and proves him
self right at home.
Armed with one of the largest budgets
of his career, Scorsese painstakingly repro
duces the period, from the restrictive
clothing and lavish homes to the place set
tings for a 13-course formal dinner. He
doesn't simply use the production design
as a backdrop; every painting, every piece
of jewelry has a purpose, and the camera
obsessively seeks out each one, over
whelming us with the sheer volume of de
tail. And where Merchant-Ivory might be
content to direct the film in a classical,
stately manner, allowing the script and the
acting to tell the story by themselves,
Scorsese's direction is like that of a raging
bull in a china shop, shaking up Wharton's
genteel world with all of his favorite tricks
— slow-motion shots, quick cuts and rad
ical changes in lighting — to get his points
across.
But his love for this world is purely aes
thetic, so the tragedy affects us intellectual
ly, not emotionally. The first line in "Good
fellas" is "Ever since 1 was a kid, I wanted to
be a gangster," and Scorsese identifies
strongly with that statement, displaying an
enormous amount of affection and am
bivalence toward each of the hoods in his
film. Here, neither he nor Wharton respect
this society or its traditions. They recreate
it only to mock it, and if they don't care for
it, why should we?
In that vein, Joanne Woodward's narra
tion — taken verbatim from the novel —
doesn't work at all. Scorsese fs a past master

at using narration; in
"Goodfellas" and "Taxi
Driver," the voice
overs deepened our
understanding of the
characters because a
personage from within
the story acts as narra
tor. In "Age," the narra
tor isn't a character;
she's an outside voice
explaining events and
telling us what to
think, alternating be
tween play-by-play
commentary and pa
tronizing editorials.
The acting, though
always adequate, is
largely hit-or-miss.
Pfeiffer fails to eroti
cize the threat she
poses to Newland,
coming across as a
wounded free spirit
instead. And while
Winona Ryder seems

more concerned about her accent than her
acting (admittedly, the script doesn't make
much use of her) she rises to the occasion
toward the end, inexorably shattering
Newland's dream of a life spent with Ellen.
Daniel Day-Lewis is left to carry the
emotional core of the film. His stunning
portrayal of Newland combines Travis
Biclde's repression ("Taxi Driver") with
Jesus' longing for a different life ("The Last
Temptation of Christ") to create a 19th
century version of God's lonely man. It's a
difficult task to portray both Newland's

inner strength and his inability to defy the
rules of the world he lives in, but Day-Lewis
pulls it off with a subtle aplomb that he
hasn't had to use since "The Unbearable
Lightness of Being."

recommend it, but emotional impact isn't
one of them. Now that Scorsese has proven
