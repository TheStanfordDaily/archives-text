## the Good Son 
### 
Dig the scene as mom in her heels and pop in his Dockers head
out without junior for an autumn evening's entertainment at the
local cine-plex with Macaulay Culkin, because in the "R"-rated
fiasco "the Good Son," the child mega-star murders a dog,

knocks his mommy off a cliff
and pushes his kid sister onto
the dangerously brittle ice of a
frozen lake.
Yet remember that
Macaulay was at his most
wholesome while pummeling
Joe Pesci (his "Home Alone"
co-star) with an assortment
of makeshift household
weapons.
Ironically, "the Good Son"
isn't nearly as entertainingly
violent as either of Culkin's
prior scores. But that's the
least of its problems. As writ
ten, Joseph Ruben's earnest
attempt at childhood-psy
cho-drama is an exercise in
no-no's for scripted enter
tainment.
Never let your widower dad
go away on business — you
won't be emotionally ready
for a visit with your uncle's
family.
Don't tell your cousin's

mother (Wendy Crewson) that he tried to kill his sister or that
she's really your mother come back from the dead—no one likes
a tattle-tale. And never, ever threaten your cousin with a pair of
scissors (even if you're positive he means to off the entire family)
when his father is standing behind you — he won't warn you
again about playing with sharp objects.
Sure it sounds interesting, but cocky collegiate film critics
enjoy making terrible premises sound c 001... just before they rip
them to shreds.
Ruben doesn't have to try very hard to keep things moving to
ward a "compelling crescendo." Just a few odd-angled shots, some
menacing pans of wintry Cape Ann, Mass., and a couple of close
ups of a smirking Culkin and bug-eyed co-star Elijah Wood is all it
takes, because we want to see Macaulay pull an "Omen" on us.
Unfortunately neither lad is the kid actor Jodie Foster or Lau
rence Fishbume were at their ages. Writer lan McEwan envisions
"the Good Son" as the story of a couple of sparring intellectuals
trapped in pre-pubescent bodies. The dialogue for the boys makes
us remember that kids rarely exhibit intelligence when they mimic
adults, just cuteness.
But flaws aside, "The Good Son" is a bit twisted. In a bizarre
casting move, the sister Macaulay attempts to kill and the broth
er who's already dead at the film's start are his real siblings.
What's Papa Culkin trying to tell us?
