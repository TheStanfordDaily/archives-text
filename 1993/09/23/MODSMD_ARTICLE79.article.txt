There's no doubt about it; gender-bending is the hot new
topic at the local art house.
From Neil Jordan's romantic opus "The Crying Game" to
Sally Potter's sterile "Orlando" and David Cronenberg's up
coming "M. Butterfly," men and women dissatisfied with

their gender are throwing on the opposite sex's clothes faster
than you can say "Tootsie."
Director Maggie Greenwalds latest film, "The Ballad of
Little Jo," is the genre's most straightforward offering to date,
but that doesn't prevent it from being an absorbing piece of
drama.
Suzy Amis stars as Josephine "Little Jo" Monahan, a soci
ety girl from the East whose husband casts her out after he
discovers her infidelity. After a seemingly kind traveling sales
man attempts to sell her into slavery, Josephine decides to
head out west ... as Little Jo, a shy young man looking for
peace and solitude.
She soon finds that "passing" as a man isn't as easy as
throwing on some store-bought duds and scarring her face
with a razor. Upon arriving in Ruby City, the local cowboys
demand to see Jo's feet to make sure that she doesn't wear yel
low stockings like the last "dude" (gay man) that passed
through town.
Jo learns to smoke a pipe, ride a horse, herd sheep and
shoot a moving target — and with each male-gendered skill
that she learns, the townspeople stop questioning her pecu
liarities. But she is never truly comfortable with the white
men of Ruby City, instead preferring the company of Russian
immigrants and a Chinese man that she takes as her lover.
Tilda Swinton look-alike Suzy Amis takes some getting
used to as a man, but she captures the nuances of Jo's predica
ment without slipping into stereotype. Greenwald creates a
vivid portrait of the Old West that hasn't been seen before,
even in Clint Eastwood's vaguely feminist "Unforgiven." She
doesn't have Eastwood's understanding of myth-making.
Greenwald uses our preconceptions about gender to de
mythologize the West and tell a compelling, often hilarious
story in the process. "The Ballad of Little Jo" is a song well
worth hearing.
