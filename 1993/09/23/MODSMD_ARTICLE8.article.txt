## Clinton unveils new plan for universal health coverage 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Proposing a
top-to-bottom makeover of the nation's
health care system, President Clinton
last night called for ambitious reforms
guaranteeing every American compre
hensive medical benefits "that can
never be taken away."
Clinton, in a nationally broadcast
speech to a session of Congress, said his
plan would reform "the costliest and
most wasteful health care system on
Earth without any new broad-based
taxes."
Laying out his rationale for the
biggest social initiative since the New
Deal, Clinton said the current system is
"too uncertain and too expensive, too
bureaucratic and too wasteful. It has
too much fraud and too much greed."
Pointing to his own proposal, which
would require all employers to provide
health insurance to their workers, the
president said, "Let us guarantee every
American comprehensive health bene
fits."

In a direct challenge to lawmakers,
Clinton said, "Let us pledge tonight:
before this Congress adjourns next
year, you will pass and I will sign legis
lation to guarantee health security to
every citizen of this country."
The product of eight months of work,
the administration's plan is based on
the premise that it can extend health
coverage to the 37 million uninsured
and at the same time shrink the
nation's $900 billion medical bill.
Clinton said that under his plan,
some Americans would be asked to pay
more but that the vast majority would
pay the same or less for health care cov
erage that would be the same or better
than they currently have.
Currently, health care costs are ris
ing at more than twice the rate of other
prices and represent one-seventh of all
U.S. spending.
Clinton's plan would require all
employers to pay 80 percent of the aver
age health premium for their workers.

Employees would pay the rest. Small
businesses and low-income workers
would get subsidies.
Giant insurance-purchasing pools
called health alliances would be created
in each state to negotiate with doctors,
hospitals and insurers. Consumers
would buy their coverage through the
alliances.
The plan would vastly expand the
government's power to control health
costs if competition alone doesn't work.
To help pay for it, Clinton said he
would impose new taxes on tobacco but
he dropped the idea of increases for
beer, wine or hard liquor. Clinton also
said he would seek a "modest" tax on
corporations that opt out of the health
alliances and set up their own pro
grams.
Growth in the government's two
biggest health programs, Medicare and
Medicaid, would be slowed by $238 bil
lion over five years, though many in
Congress say it's politically unrealistic

to cut that deeply on care for the elder
ly and the poor.
The White House was intentionally
vague in releasing details on the financ
ing, one of the plan's thorniest issues.
Clinton came equipped last night
with a prototype of the health care card
that every American would get under
his plan. Emblazoned with the seal of
the United States, it resembles a credit
card.
Polls show that while most Ameri
cans believe the system needs to be
fixed they uncertain about ways to
change it. A half-dozen rival plans
already have sprung up.
The president signaled a willingness
to compromise over the course of what
is sure to be months of debate. "On this
journey, as on all others of consequence,
there will be rough stretches in the road
and honest disagreements" about how
to proceed, he said.
"There will be some who will stoutly
disagree with what I have proposed and

with all other plans in the Congress for
that matter," Clinton said. "Let us
write that new chapter in America's
story and guarantee every American
comprehensive health benefits that can
never be taken away."
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole said
Republicans would work with Clinton
to fashion a new health care system, but
warned of disagreements ahead. "In the
complex debate that will come in the
months ahead, let's keep in mind four
key issues: choice, quality, jobs and
cost," Dole said.
Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, chair of the
American Medical Association's board
of trustees, said "the president may be
creating expectations that cannot be
met."
A health reform coalition chaired by
former Presidents Carter and Ford
praised the "comprehensiveness and
strength" of Clinton's plan and said it
was encouraged by bipartisan support
for changing the system.
