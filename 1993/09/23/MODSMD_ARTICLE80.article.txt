# An affair to remember
## The 						alternative nation's 'Judgment Night' 
### 
Pop music's most virile black sheep, hip
hop and alternative rock, recently gave
birth, to their first documented love
child: a bouncing baby soundtrack named
"Judgment Night." But hold onto your cigars
and pass the skepticism, because reality has a
secret to share.
We're not talking about a couple of mature
music forms here. We're talking about awk
ward, teenage prima donnas who, as kinder
gartners, were laughed off the playground by
older, jealous bullies and declared disagreeable
by out-of-touch "pop educators" — neither of
whom cared admitting that the grating chaos
dubbed "music" was the logical extension of
past innovations. Fans helped them see the
light.
Today it probably feels grand to be an Ever
last, Mark Arm, B-Real, Page Hamilton or
Dave Pirner. But are they really in control or
just some producer's ho? Don't misunder
stand. It's just that a love child can be a dan
gerous thing. It can be the embodiment of
recklessness, frenzied passion, insensitivity,
arrogance, excess — all the things that make
hip-hop and alternative rock the sound of
choice for a host of pseudo-rebels.
But when it's the bright idea of some record
industry ad wizard anxious to push into the
blossoming movie soundtrack market (more
of a controlled breeding for profit than for the
love of innovation), it feels too much like Hel
met and House of Pain's "Just Another Vic-

Tim" — a collaboration of musical strangers
performing at each other as opposed to in uni
son.
And 11 cuts later "Judgment Night," de
spite avant-garde pairings of everyone from
Dinosaur Jr. and Del The Funky Homosapien
to Faith No More and 800-Ya T.R.1.8.E., still
hasn't reached the levels of elegant dissonance
its contributing artists swear it should.
"Me, Myself and My Microphone" (Living
Colour and Run), a metallic funk hitched to
Old School rhyme, and "Disorder" (Slayer
and Ice-T), a punchy, (probably) uninten
tional continuation of the Body Count aes
thetic that rattled Warner Bros, less than a
year ago, are seductively simplistic in their ap
peal. It's as if the names of the groups alone are
enough to set heads nodding and slam-danc
ing bodies in motion.
It doesn't matter that the sound is out
dated, that the artists, once praised individual
ly as the movers and shakers of their assorted
pop genres, are doing little more than retread
ing a celebrated old tire.
Maybe they're not hungry enough. De La
Soul, on the come back trail from one of
1991 *s most mis-understood rap albums ("De
Li Soul Is Dead"), feel discernibly leaner on
the lackadaisically whimsical "Fallin.' " Pos
D'Nos, Trugoy and Mase aren't just perform
ing over a Teenage Fanclub ditty, they're
dropping lyrical bombs that'd make vocal ac
robat Bobby McFerrin grin. Even more satis-

fying is tht unmistak
able vibe of friendship
between the two bands.
"Fallin* " sounds like
the beginning of a hip
new collaboration.
Likewise Biohazard
and Onyx find a mutu
al grime to play in for
"Judgment Day," while
Mudhoney and Sir
Mix-A-Lot submit a
Top 40-friendly
grunge version of
"Baby Got Back"
(Freakmomma) for
popular approval. Tak
ing their lead from
"Fallin* " both tracks
accentuate the necessi
ty for interactive
music-making in ways
that "Real Thing" (Cy
press Hill and Pear
jam) and"I Love Yo*.
Mary Jane" (Sonic
Youth and Cypress
Hill) never think twice
about.

What "Judgment Night" needs most is a
shot of originality, something to convince the
majority of the soundtrack's acts that genre
team-ups don't need to depend on the cramp

ing musical traditions musicians tend to sur
round themselves with. Until then, collabora
tive recordings will continue standing on the
portal that separates works of love and passion
from marketing strategies and profits.
