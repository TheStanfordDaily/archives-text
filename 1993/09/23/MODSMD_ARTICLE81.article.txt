## Sarah Brightman Dive 
### 
Sarah Brightman sang the role of Christine in Andrew
Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera" with a poignancy
that stirred many to tears.
Now her new album "Dive" just makes listeners want to
cry out in pain.
Perhaps the photo on the album cover should be consid
ered a hint regarding the quality of Brightman's new sound.
While she was married to Broadway legend Webber, Bright
man acted and sang with genuine emotion in a number of
plays, including "Phantom." Her Christine was a tortured
soul torn between the safe, gentle man who loved her and the
phantom of the opera house who both terrified and wor
shipped her. The stage seemed the perfect venue for her light

soprano. But in the record
ing studio she sounds more
like a caged bird.
Although some of her
music is reminiscent of
former teen pop diva Deb
bie Gibson, Brightman
lacks the relative freshness
and originality that made
Gibson's initial work
somewhat bearable. (In
addition, Brightman
should remember that it's
no longer the 1980s and
she is definitely no longer a
teenager.)
One of the few things that
can be said in her favor is
that Brightman didn't
write the songs she sings
(though her selections do
reflect poorly on her taste
in music as well as her

singing). In "Ship of Fools," Brightman sings tritely, "Endless
nights of loving / All my doubts and fears went away / So tell
me what went wrong / Now i need you." Perhaps she should
let her pop contemporaries Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey
deal with earth-shattering concerns such as these. Bright
man's music is empty and meaningless, without any sort of
soul, energy or feeling.
In reality, Brightman seems to have selected her songs
based on their connection to ships rather than their musical
quality (or lack thereof). Titles such as "Captain Nemo,"
"Ship of Fools," "A Salty Dog," "Seven Seas" and "Island"
leave one wondering if Brightman shouldn't forsake a singing
career in favor of sailing the seven seas.
While a strong beat attempts to turn some of the songs into
dance-floor tunes, even the most upbeat of her work appears
plaintive and uninspired. In other songs such as "By Now"
and"The Second Element," Brightman combines a series of
high, whiny lyrics with whispers that she must mistakenly
think are sexy. However, she seems more like a spoiled, crying
child than a sultry adult singer.
So rather than taking a "Dive" into Brightman's quasi-pop
album, pull out a tried-and-true recording of "Phantom" and
lose yourself in "The Music of the Night."
