# Manic Street Preachers Gold Against the Soul
## 
### 
It has been 29 years since the Beatles proved that British
youth could make better American rock 'n' roll than Ameri
cans could.
Well, if "Gold Against the Soul"— the second release from
the proudly androgynous Manic Street Preachers — is any in
dication of what the U.K. has to offer in the wake of grunge
rock's semi-revolution, any fears of a second British Invasion
can be put to rest. Seattle out-angsts South Wales any day.
Simply put, "Gold Against the Soul" is an overwrought,
underwhelming mess, oozing with hackneyed guitar lines
and clumsy prose. The Preachers advertise themselves as a

group that "went back and rediscovered the great bands." As
a result, they combine Rolling Stones-esque hooks and string
arrangements with Sex Pistol frenzy, and come up with some
thing along the lines of mid-'Bos glam-rock with a dance beat.
The album's first track, "Sleepflower," presents maybe
three chord changes and dire lines like "Endless hours in bed,
no peace in this mind / No one knows where innocence dies."
By the second song, ominously titled "From Despair to
Where," the band has laid out its lyrical groundwork; "There's
nothing nice in my head / The adult world took it all away."
The problem is that the farthest the Preachers go in con
fronting their teenage turmoil is lamenting the fact that they've
been pushed to coke and booze.
But while "Roses" suggests that the band might try to set
the debauchery of its youth aside, the Preachers sink back into
apathy on the next track, "Nostalgic Pushead," on which they
bemoan popular music's "slavery to the God" of'6os rock cul
ture while still resigning to cocaine and"the Stones on CD."
Throughout the album, the Preachers throw together a
mishmash of disparate influences that never coalesce into any
semblance of a definitive sound. And that is where their at
tempt to engage the jaded alternative audience fails.
Unfortunately, the Preachers have not yet caught on to the
fact that what this generation wants most is simplicity. Nir
vana's genius lies in the band's willingness to accept the limita
tions of its members' intellects and from there create sparse
beauty. Nirvana, like most in the 18-25 set, isn't quite sure what
it's rebelling against.
"Gold Against the Soul," on the other hand, complains about
everything. The title track, which closes the album, rails against
both conservatives and the

"white liberals" who don't
practice what they preach.
That sort of tiresome carp
ing should leave even
grunge-weary listeners
wishing they were back —
sleepless or otherwise — in
Seattle.
