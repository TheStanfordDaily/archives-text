Boxing Helena
It's finally here — the infamous film
that scared off Madonna and made
Kim Basinger bankrupt. Yes, it is
about a surgeon who amputates
the arms and legs of the woman he
"loves," and keeps her in a box.
Writer-director Jennifer Lynch takes
the story so seriously that it threat
ens to become another woman
hating "erotic thriller." But the
screenplay is so bad that it be
comes an unintentionally hilarious
parody. R
Hard Target
Hong Kong über-director John
Woo makes his U.S. debut and re
vives Jean-Claude Van Damme's
career in the process. The script,
which centers on a pair of merce
naries who hunt homeless veterans
for sport, doesn't give Woo much to
work with. But his brilliantly choreo
graphed action sequences enable
him to transcend the cliched
screenplay and create an entertain
ing piece of work. R

Into the West
You think you have problems? Llh
uh. Alcoholic "traveler" Gabriel
Byrne and his two boys have prob
lems. Mostly they're missing the
woman who moonlighted as wife
and mother until a poorly handled
birth prematurely pushed her
through to the other side. Fortu
nately for them all, she returns from
the dead as a horse to remind them
that self-pity and mourning should
only be taken so far. Sounds like
words of wisdom to me. But horses
don't speak English and directors
caught up in mystical stories lose
sight of the audiences they're trying
to reach. PG
Kalifornia
It's the worse kind of d6ja vu — the
kind that reminds you of something
bad, that reminds you of something
worse, that makes you wag your
head and ask, "Whatever hap
pened to the good old days?"
They're dead. Buried. What's left is
stuff like "Kalifornia," interesting

premises — a hick-ish serial killer
(Brad Pitt) and his dim-witted girl
friend (Juliette Lewis) go "kill-rid
ing" with a couple of snooty liberal
lovers — that never quite reach the
end of the line. Still, Dominic Sena
of Propaganda Films fame has vi
sual sense enough to hold things
together. R
King of the Hill
Former wunderkind Steven Soder
bergh ("sex, lies, and videotape")
starts to redeem his career after his
sophomore slump, "Kafka." New
comer Jesse Bradford makes a
stunning debut as Aaron Kurlander,
a 13-year-old boy left to fend for
himself in the Depression-era Mid
west. Soderbergh directs the film
beautifully, but he rarely connects
with the ugliness of Aaron's plight.
Worth a look. PG-13
Man Without A Face
Would you believe the notoriously
homophobic Mel Gibson as a gay
teacher who has a sexual en-

counter with his 13 year-old stu
dent? Neither could Mel — that's
why Isabelle Holland's novel under
went a few crucial changes on its
trip to the big screen, shedding its
more interesting aspects for the
sake of big box-office receipts. All
that remains is the story of a boy
learning to learn from his hideously
disfigured tutor, and that's much
too banal to be worth our time. PG
-13
True Romance
No, it's not a "Bonnie and Clyde for
the '905." It's your basic boy meets
ho, boy gets ho, boy kills ho's pimp
and heads for L.A. with suitcase full
of pimp's cocaine story — the kind
we'd expect to find in a trashy ro
mance magazine. Written by auteur
du jour Quentin Tarantino ("Reser
voir Dogs"), the film is as breathless
and shallow as one of those dime
a-dozen stories. But the script is a
$10 gem that rescues the film from
director Tony Scott's two-bit hack
job. R
