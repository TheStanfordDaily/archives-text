# The 						last word on...

### 
The only thing worse than living
in Branner as an upperclassman is
the futile hunt for that favorite
recording artist whose albums are
out of print
Never fear, boxed compact disc
sets are here. That's right, kids, prati
cally every musician who's ever
made you swoon, plus all the ones
that haven't,

lave 20 disk retrospectives of
their sordid musical histo-

ries.
You too can have access to the
small-talk behind the studio door,
the snapshots of musicians in com
promising poses and those ever
popular rarities recorded in reverse
for your listening confusion.
Let s face it, seldom has the
recording industry given us a better
deal —as if. Wores still, even groups

like the Police, whose five albums
have never been pulled from the
shelves, are getting into the action.
Does the inclusion of "Fall Out,"
the one single that doesn't appear on
an album and a color-photo book
make really make much of a differ
ence? Color this scene excessive.
