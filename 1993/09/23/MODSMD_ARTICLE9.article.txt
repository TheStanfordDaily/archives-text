China may test nukes
LONDON (AP) â€” Commercial satellite pic
tures indicate that China prepared more than a
year ago to detonate several nuclear devices, a
physicist who helped predict China's two 1992
tests said yesterday.
The revelation came less than a week after
the United States said a Chinese nuclear test is
imminent and asked Bering to call it off. China
said Monday it had "taken note" of the U.S.
appeal, but gave no indication whether it would
relent.
If China does conduct an underground nucle
ar test, it would be the first by any country in a
year. Clinton warned that if another country
tests before Sept. 30, 1994, he would seek con
gressional authorization to resume U.S. testing.
Vipin Gupta of London University's Imperial
College, who has monitored China's Lop Nor
test site for three years, said the commercial
satellite pictures are too old and not detailed
enough to confirm U.S. intelligence reports that
China inserted a nuclear device into a hole at
the site earlier this month.
