# Milburn dazzles opponents in his Bronco debut
## Former Stanford star's moves leave opponents gasping for air, grasping for plaudits

Each time Glyn Milburn carried the ball
for Stanford, we knew he had "NFL" writ
ten all over him. What fan couldn't imagine
Milburn's Cardinal jersey suddenly trans
forming into the colors of his favorite pro
team? But when the all-purpose back with
the looks of a cherub and the moves of a Tas
manian Devil was selected by the Denver
Broncos in the second round of the draft,
non-Stanfordites still had lingering doubts
could a 5-foot-8, 177-pounder make an
impact at the next level?
Milburn didn't waste much time answer
ing this question. He was merely dazzling in
carrying his new team to a 26-20, season
opening victory over the New York Jets.
And Milburn did it just like he did in college
on hand-offs, receptions and punt re
turns. He finished the day with 148 all-pur
pose yards and an outrageous 25-yard
shake, rattle 'n' roll into the end zone that
made every highlight film in the country.
He also won some new fans. "I haven't seen
a back like him come out in a long time,"
said All-Pro safety Ronnie Lott after the
game. "He won them the game."
It was the kind of performance Cardinal
fans expected of Milburn. The super-pow
ered dynamo set the Stanford record for all
purpose yardage in a season with 2,222 yards
in 1990. He led the Pacific 10 Conference in
all-purpose yardage two years later with
2,121 yards. During that year, his final sea
son on the Farm, Milburn was named Pac-10
player of the week three times. He ended up
winning first-team All-Pac-10 honors.
So Milburn's debut against the pros didn't
seem that different from his days as a BMOC.
After the victory over the Jets, Milburn said
he hadn't found the jump to the NFL as
tough as it was made out to be. "The quality
of the athlete across the board is better, but
everybody in the pros was in college once,"
said Milburn. Some critics might have called
him a brash rookie to make such a comment

after only one regular-season game, but Mil
burn is too contemplative for that label.
Nonetheless, his assessment proved a bit
premature. In the two games that followed,
Milburn did not fare nearly as well as in his
debut. In a 34-17 Bronco victory over the
San Diego Chargers, Milburn finished with
just 24 all-purpose yards. The next week
against the Kansas City Chiefs, he caught
eight passes but fumbled once a dismal 15-7
loss on Monday Night Football.
As a rookie, Milburn has a lot to learn and
is bound to make more mistakes before the
season is over. "I need to try to understand
defenses better, to understand coverages bet
ter," Milburn said. His confusion becomes
more apparent as statements turn to ques
tions: "When do the linebackers rush, [and]
when do they drop back into coverage?"
He'll get help answering those questions
from a familiar support network. Milburn
isn't the only Cardinal alumnus playing for
Denver; Stanford's living legend, John
Elway, directs the Broncos new short-pass
ing game. And the man who designed that of
fense, Jim Fassel, is another Stanford man.
So in order to set things straight, when
Milburn carries the ball, he gets the hand-off
from a Stanford grad in a play designed by a
Stanford grad. But who's that snapping the
ball? Yes, Bronco starting-center Keith Kartz
is ... gasp ... a weenie. He's the only thing
marring this beautiful picture, and Milburn,
Elway and Fassel have let him know it. It's
this kind of Stanford connection that Mil
burn said has helped him adjust off the field.
After all, Stanford degree or no Stanford
degree, he's just like any other rookie going
through the ritual hazing led by the team's
veterans. Milburn's role in his first year
isn't just about carrying footballs, it's also
about carrying eggs and hashbrowns. He's
supposed to serve breakfast to the older
running backs on the team, as well as bring
them their meals on team plane rides.
Showing remarkable versatility, Milburn
belted out Rick James's "Fire and Desire"
when asked to sing before a team dinner.

Rick James?
"It just kind of came out," Milburn apol
ogized.
Between games, practices and catching
his breath in the Mile High city, Milburn still

manages to keep tabs on the Cardinal. He
tried desperately but in vain to catch the
Washington game (lucky for him), but vows
to keep an eye on them. "Tell them," Mil
burn said, "big brother is watching."
