# Cardinal looks to run all over Bruin defense
## Hot-handed quarterback Stenstrom needs lift from disappointing running game

What a difference ten years can make.
On Oct. 10, 1983, UCLA defeated Stanford
39-21, sending the Cardinal to its fifth de
feat of the season. In all, the 1983 Stanford
football team finished 1-10, sending coach
Paul Wiggin into retirement.
Ten years later, No. 17 Stanford has a
winning record, a national ranking and a
head coach who came out of retirement to
lead the team into today's game against
UCLA.
UCLA, however, has gone winless so far
in the 1993 season, dropping close games to
California and Nebraska, both ranked in
the top 20. Nevertheless, the Cardinal is not
looking past the Bruins to next weekend's
Notre Dame contest. Head coach Bill Walsh
sees today's game as both a difficult contest
and an opportunity to make improvements.
Some improvements will certainly have
to be made to the Cardinal's anemic rushing
attack. It ranks last in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a 71.3-yards-per-game aver
age. "We've got to just practice, practice,
practice," Walsh said. "We've spent a lot of
time on [improving our running game], and
I believe at some point we'll get into sync,"
said Walsh. He added: "A year ago, we were
very, very good at [rushing]."
Fortunately, the Cardinal passing attack
has looked impressive in its early-season
games. Steve Stenstrom has been magnifi
cent, passing for 330 yards against San Jose
State and 382 yards in the Cardinal's game
against Colorado. Stenstrom ranks second
in the Pac-10 and 18th in the NCAA with
281.3 yards of total offense per game. Many
of Stenstrom's passes have found their way
into the hands of wide receiver Justin Ar
mour, who is averaging eight receptions per
game.
On defense, the Cardinal has suffered
greatly from the losses of All-Americans
Ron George and Dave Garnett and safety
John Lynch. Stanford is currently ranked
last in the Pac-10 in total defense, having al
lowed an average 0f548 yards to their oppo
nents.
This young defensive unit will be tested
by the pass-catching prowess of J.J. Stokes,
currently third in the Pac-10 in receiving.

Yet the Bruins are primarily a young team
as well, with 19 juniors and 23 sophomores
on scholarship, compared to only 14 seniors.
One such junior is redshirt starting quar
terback Wayne Cook, who has been solid if
unspectacular in his two starts this season.
Finally, strong safety Marvin Goodwin
and linebacker Jamir Miller, also juniors,

lead a UCLA defense hoping to contain the
rampaging Cardinal offense. Miller, who
has battled off-the-field problems in the off
season, is considered a candidate for the
Butkus Award, given to the year's out
standing collegiate linebacker.
The Bruins have been successful in sti
fling their opponents' passing game so far

this season, holding California and Nebras
ka to only 358 yards in the two games. But
the Bruins defense against the run has been
dismal, giving up a combined 405 yards on
the ground to the Golden Bears and Corn
huskers. If the Cardinal can get its running
game on track, the Bruins will likely be in
for a long afternoon.

The Cardinal will look to running back Ellery Roberts (33) to help carry the offensive load against UCLA today. The running game
has been a major concern for Stanford this year.
