# Cline catches on to new offensive role

With twelve seconds left in the
game, Stanford trails by three
points. It's third down and goal
from the Colorado seven-yard
line. Stenstrom drops back, fires
over the middle, and hits Cline for
the game-winning touchdown!
Wait a minute, he hit Cline for a
touchdown? Who is this guy?
Despite his lack of notoriety, se
nior tight end Tony Cline has be
come a valuable receiving threat
for the Cardinal this season. Prior
to the 1993 campaign, Cline had
only nine career receptions for 70
yards in three full seasons, being
used primarily as a blocker and a
backup tight end.
However, Stanford's 41-37
come-from-behind victory over
Colorado last Saturday could have
been renamed the Tony Cline
Show. In the contest, Cline caught
11 pivotal passes for 120 yards and
a touchdown.
The 11 receptions against the
Buffaloes tied him for 12th place
on Stanford's single-game recep
tion list with four other players,
and were the most receptions by a
single Cardinal receiver since
tight end Jim Price caught 14
passes from Steve Smith against
Notre Dame in 1989.
"[The Colorado game] was a
great win for us, because it really
brings [the team] together," Cline
said. "It compares to the Notre
Dame game last year it gives us
confidence that we can come from

behind and win in the end."
Cline's play has impressed
Stanford coach Bill Walsh. "He's
improved dramatically from a
year ago," Walsh said. "This last
spring practice he began to catch
the ball very well, and his confi
dence has really improved."
Cline partly attributes his re
cent success to the fact that the
opposition has played loose pass
defense against the Cardinal re
ceivers in the first two games, al
lowing him to get open.
"[Colorado ran] a zone where
they dropped their linebackers re
ally deep it really gives you the
opportunity to exploit the mid
dle," Cline said. "As a tight end,
you can sit down in the middle of a
zone and be open."
Cline said successfully filled the
void in the Cardinal offense creat
ed by tight end Ryan Wetnight's
graduation after last season.
This season, Cline has 18 recep
tions for 218 yards and a touch
down. He ranks fourth in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference and 22nd in the
nation with six receptions per
game. Also, his 72.3 yards per game
places him eighth in the Pac-10.
Cline stressed that the Cardi
nal needs to run the ball better in
order to have continued aerial suc
cess. "We really need to get our
running game going to be a com
plete offense," Cline said. "As
soon as we get our running game
going, our passing game will be
that much more effective."
And Cline will be over the mid
dle, just waiting to catch the ball.
