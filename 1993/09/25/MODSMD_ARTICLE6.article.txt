# Balance of power in Pacific 10 takes northward turn
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
On Oct. 3, 1987, the Cardinal football team faced
UCLA at Stanford Stadium much like today's
matchup. On that woeful Saturday, the Bruins hu
miliated the Cardinal 49-0.
Leading the UCLA charge was junior quarterback
Troy Aikman, who completed 12 of 15 passes for 187
yards and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, UCLA's All-
American running back Gaston Green gained 139
yards on 14 carries, including a 91-yard touchdown
run, as UCLA trampled Stanford on its way to a 10-2
record and a Pacific 10 Conference Co-Champi
onship.
Throughout the 1980s, UCLA thoroughly domi
nated the Bay Area teams, compiling a 16-4 record
against Stanford and California. In fact, before a 38-
31 win in 1990, the Weenies hadn't beaten UCLA
since 1971. When New Year's Day rolled around,
UCLA or USC always seemed to be occupying the
Rose Bowl.
However, the 1990s have been a markedly differ
ent era for the Bruins. During the '9os, UCLA has a
1-6 record against Bay Area teams the lone victo
ry coming on a 32-31 squeaker against the Cardinal

in 1991. Furthermore, the Bruins haven't played in
the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day since 1985.
These statistics seem to suggest a shift in the bal
ance of power in the Pac-10. The years of dominance
by the Los Angeles teams appear to have finally
ended, and the Bay Area teams are anxious to take
their turns on the Rose Bowl stage.
Cardinal coach Bill Walsh attributes this change
to an increased interest in Bay Area football shown
by top athletes. "There has just been more interest in
the Northern California teams," said Walsh. "For
whatever reasons, the great athletes aren't quite as
attracted to USC and UCLA as they have been, and I
think it's just a cycle."
The Bay Area teams are currently on the upswing
of this cycle. Entering this weekend, 17th-ranked
Stanford enjoys a 2-1 record, while 18th-ranked Cal
ifornia boasts a perfect 3-0 record. So far this season,
Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom and Califor
nia quarterback Dave Barr have had much better sta
tistics than their counterparts in Los Angeles (UCLA
quarterback Wayne Cook and USC's Rob Johnson).
The Los Angeles teams are evidently experiencing
the cycle's nadir. The Bruins are 0-2 and risk having

their worst start since 1971, when
they opened 0-4 on their way to a
2-7 season. Things are not much
better across town, as the 1-2 Tro
jans's system hasn't begun to click
yet. John Robinson's second
tenure features a close loss last
week to Penn State and a throt
tling by North Carolina in the sea
son opener.
Whatever the reasons for the

northward shift in football
prowess, the increasing balance in
the league certainly makes for an
interesting race in the Pac-10, es
pecially with Washington banned
from postseason play this year.
Walsh and the Cardinal hope to
stake their claim to the Rose Bowl
in the near future, even at the ex
pense of the Cardinal's perennial
nemeses in Los Angeles.
Remarked Walsh, "I think
we're going to be playing [USC and
UCLA] head-to-head very evenly
in the future, and we'll maybe even
win more than our share."
