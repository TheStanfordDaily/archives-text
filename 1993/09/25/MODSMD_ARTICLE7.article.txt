# UCLA/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Stokes, a junior, has taken over
the bulk of the Bruin receiving du
ties since the graduation of Ail-
American Sean LaChapelle, and is
considered the top deep threat at
UCLA. Last season, he had 41 re
ceptions for 720 yards and seven
touchdowns. Bryant, a senior,
leads an inexperienced Cardinal
secondary that is rated ninth in
the Pacific 10 Conference in pass
efficiency defense, giving up 358
yards in three games.

Quarterback Wayne Cook is final
ly healthy; now UCLA hopes to
see what he can do. The junior
opened last season as the team
starter, then blew out his knee.
One reconstructive surgery later,
he's still got the strong arm, but
with questionable mobility. He'll
face pressure from right defensive
end David Carder. Carder, a ju
nior, is struggling to make the
breakthrough Stanford coaches
expected of him this season.

It's Parker vs. Parker. UCLA's
Ail-American Vaughn Parker is
considered the finest offensive
tackle in the nation and his excep
tional blocking ability places him
in the mold of NFL legends like
Anthony Munoz and Jackie
Slater. Stanford defensive end Ty
rone Parker, a fifth-year senior,
will duel with his UCLA counter
part in the trenches and try to put
the heat on Cook.

Probably the most crucial
matchup of the game. Miller
opened the season with eight tack
les against Nebraska. He is a
Butkus Award candidate who led
his team in quarterback sacks last
season despite missing three
games with an injury. Miller will
be chasing a quarterback with a
hot hand. Stenstrom threw for a
career-high five touchdowns and
382 yards against Colorado. He's
the second-ranked passer in the
Pac-10.

Goodwin leads the Bruins in tack
les, averaging nine per game. He
tied for second on the squad with
61 tackles last season as a strong
safety. He returns to that position
after opening the season at free
safety. Shaw, a senior, provides
leadership and experience on the
Stanford receiving corps. Had a
big game against San Jose State
with 72 yards receiving and two
touchdowns.

So far in the 1993 NFL season,
Stanford alumnus John Elway
has led the Denver Broncos to a 2-
1 record with a productive quar
terback rating of 98.&, while the
Dallas Cowboys, led by UCLA
graduate and Super Bowl XXVIII
MVP Troy Aikman, have strug
gled with a 1-2 record. Aikman
hasn't had as much success with
the passing game this season as he
did in 1992 but that should im
prove with the recent signing of
running back Emmitt Smith.
