Soviets may have taken POWs
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. govern
ment has confronted Moscow for the first time
with evidence that hundreds of U.S. Korean
War prisoners were secretly moved to the Soviet
Union, imprisoned and never returned.
The allegation, supported by new informa
tion from a variety of American and Russian
sources, was made in a detailed presentation by
a State Department official at a meeting with
Russian officials in Moscow earlier this month.
The evidence is spelled out in a government
report titled "The Transfer of U.S. Korean War
POWs to the Soviet Union." It was given to the
Russians at the Moscow meeting, but the Clin
ton administration has refused to release it.
A copy of the report was obtained by The
Associated Press.
"The Soviets transferred several hundred
U.S. Korean War POWs to the U.S.S.R. and did
not repatriate them," the report says. "This
transfer was mainly politically motivated with
the intent of holding them as political hostages,
subjects for intelligence exploitation and skilled
labor within the camp system."
The report does not assess how long the
American servicemen — mostly Air Force avia
tors — may have lived, or whether any might
still be alive in the chaotic former Soviet Union.
Biosphere crew emerges
ORACLE, Ariz. (AP) — Biosphere 2's crew
emerged yesterday from a two-year experiment
in self-sufficiency, filling their lungs with fresh
air and waving to some 2,500 reporters and
cheering well-wishers.
"They said it couldn't be done," said crew
member Mark Nelson. "But here we are —
healthy, happy."
Operators say the crew set a record for living
inside an essentially closed structure.
The previous records for people in a closed
system were a six-month stay by a group of Sovi
ets in a closed Earth environment and a one
year stay by Soviet cosmonauts aboard the Mir
space station.
