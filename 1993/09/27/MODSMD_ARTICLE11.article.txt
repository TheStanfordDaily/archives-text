# Clinton urges regulation of insurance industry

WASHINGTON (AP) - Fearing
that insurers might dump sick patients,
President Clinton will ask Congress to
impose strict regulations on the insur
ance industry during the transition to
his new health care system.
"We want to make sure that the
insurance market doesn't go crazy
during the interim period," Ira Maga
ziner, the president's senior health
care adviser, said yesterday.
The reforms would bar insurers
from cutting off anyone's health
insurance if he or she became sick and
would allow workers to stay insured
when they switched jobs, even if they
or their children have chronic health
problems.
Clinton hopes to have a universal

health care system in place by mid
-1997, with a new rating system mak
ing insurance more expensive for the
young and healthy and cheaper for the
older and sickly.
His advisers expect many small
companies to get out of the health
insurance business when they are
forced to compete on the basis of man
aging care rather than avoiding risks.
"A lot of insurers might look at (the
future) and say, 'Well, I'm not going to
be able to be around two years from
now, so I'm just going to raise my
prices or drop all my sick people,' "
Magaziner said. "We've got to make
sure that doesn't happen."
Insurance and health executives
expressed alarm at the prospect of

tighter regulations.
Thomas 0. Pyle, the incoming chief
executive of Met Life Health Care and
a former consultant to Clinton's
health team, said, "If you combine an
inability to go out of business with
some control of rates, then you're in
effect confiscating corporate proper
ty."
Whatever the fate of Clinton's
Health Security Act, Congress is likely
to pass legislation next year forcing
changes on the insurance industry
and making it easier for consumers to
get coverage.
A 239-page draft of the White
House reform plan says that "to
reduce the potential for disruption,"
Clinton's Health Security Act would

impose interim rules that:
• Bar insurers from cutting off any
one's health insurance for any reason
"except for non-payment of premiums
or other strictly defined cause."
• Require insurers to develop a sin
gle rate manual with only three cate
gories: individuals, groups of fewer
than 100 and larger groups. Any pre
mium increases would have to apply
equally to all three.
• Forbid exclusions for pre-existing
conditions for new employees and
their families who had insurance in
the previous 90 days. If they had been
uninsured, only medical conditions
that occurred in the previous six
months would be grounds for exclu
sion.
