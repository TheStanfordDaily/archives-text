## Editor's welcome 
### 
WHEN UNIVERSITY Presi
dent Gerhard Casper
formed the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, he
charged the group with critically
questioning the fundamentals of a
Stanford education.
In reality, the commission will
examine only part of what students
should learn. All that students gain
from activities outside the Quad —
so-called "extracurriculars" — will
not be researched, debated or rec
ommended by the 19-member
group.
While extracurriculars have
rightly been left beyond the com
mittee's purview, they are some
thing that should not be left unex
amined in this year of University
wide self appraisal. As former Uni
versity President Don Kennedy said
during my Orientation week, half of
what makes Stanford special can be
found outside the classroom.
And in the last few years, that
half of Stanford has been decaying
faster than "undergraduate educa
tion."
Some evidence: When student
leaders held a rally in White Plaza in
May to protest the lack of student
input in administrative decisions,
fewer than 150 people showed up.
When Webb Ranch workers were
left without heat, there was no rally,
and only a handful of letters to the
editor; in fact, our reporter had to
call students to see if they were con
cerned. When the ASSU held its
election in the spring, only 30 stu
dents ran for 40 senate seats.
It's not just a drop in political
activism. The Ravenswood-Stan
ford tutoring program reported a
40 percent drop in freshmen inter
ested in tutoring last year. Fewer
and fewer students have been
interested in working at The Daily,
and in my time here, I've heard
other groups bemoan a lack of new
blood and enthusiasm as well.
Some have attributed this
extracurricular malaise to self-cen
teredness. Others say a tepid econ
omy with fewer jobs for the college
graduate is forcing students to
study more, double major or write
an honors thesis in hopes of getting
a leg up in the job market.
Couple that with skyrocketing

tuition and increased federal work
study requirements and you get a
university environment that effec
tively discourages extracurricular
activities.
These same forces are driving
increasing numbers of students to
complete college in three years. But
cutting one's education by 25 per
cent is not the appropriate panacea
for these difficulties. Sure, students
can complete the 180 units, but
what's to become of the rest of their
education? Will they have time to
tutor? To act in a dorm musical? To
be a resident assistant?
Life outside the classroom mat
ters — for both undergrads and
graduate students. The skills and
experiences you garner outside a
lecture hall, seminar room or
library are, I'm told, often the first
things you'll recall when reminisc
ing about life here. The leadership
and organizational experience to be
had from student organizations is
invaluable. Political activism — on
campus, locally or nationally —
provides students the skills to
make a difference in the real world.
Sports, performance art, communi
ty service work — they're all part of
our education.
The commission can propose all
the new policies it wants, but our
"education" won't be but half
fixed. The rest is up to us.
As you pour through Courses
and Degrees, stop and think before
deciding to take 20 units this quar
ter. Visit the student activities fair
in White Plaza tomorrow. Play a
sport. Run for office. Volunteer.
Write for The Daily.
Usually new editors use this
space to tell you what's different
with the paper. But what's in the
paper is really up to you. You can
work for us — our doors are always
open. Or you can write to us. Or you
can make news by getting involved

A healthy and vibrant Daily is
only possible with a lively campus.
The choice is yours.
