## A 						consultation involving the commission 
### 
IT HAS BEEN a good
week, because a for
mer student's invita
tion to write a guest op
ed piece for The Daily
coincided with a phone
call from Prof. Jim Shee
han, chair of the just
getting-to-work Com
mission on Undergradu
ate Education. He appar-

ently intends to ask for my views, and I
am grateful. But I have a lot of views, and
we're only scheduled for an hour. So I
thought I'd use this space to deliver the
down payment on an extra consultation.
First of all, the commission is a good
idea whose time has come; it has been
thoughtfully assembled and will be wisely
led. If it is like similar bodies elsewhere, it
will be strongly tempted to concentrate on
The Major, advising, distribution require
ments and other matters that are essen
tially curricular. As an antidote, I want to
remind the commission that two vitally
important issues outside this domain are
still high on the agenda.
The first is the evaluation of teaching
quality, and its employment in the incen
tive structure for faculty appointment and
promotion. The Advisory Board and the
relevant deans have been asked to review
the criteria for balancing research and
teaching in these processes. A first order
of business for the new commission should

be to ask how that is going, and then to
develop its own view of how we can reward
the best teachers more effectively.
Of course we cannot do so without
effective instruments for making judg
ments about teaching quality. Now, most
appointment and promotion forms make
reference to collected student evaluations,
and little more. These are of value, but
they cannot do the job alone; and only a
very few departments at Stanford take
collective responsibility for teaching qual
ity through systems of peer review. The
Subcommittee on Evaluation of Teaching
of the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, under the chairman
ship of Prof. Lee Schulman, has under
taken a year-long study of this problem
with the aid of a special grant. It is due to
deliver its recommendations later this
year; the commission should be prepared
to listen hard, because no project is more
central to the improvement of undergrad
uate education at Stanford than identify
ing and rewarding good teaching.
The second subject that deserves
prompt attention from the commission is
residential education. This is not an easy
one to handle; Res Ed here has been huge
ly successful, but it has always suffered
from an odd kind of tension. Faculty
members sometimes feel that "residential
education" means bringing the curricu
lum into the dorms, and see the commu
nitarian part of Res Ed as an unimportant

distraction. Res Ed staff lay more stress
on making residential life lively and pleas
ant; while they respect the faculty view
that residential life should be more aca
demic, they mistrust the willingness of
most faculty members to live out a per
sonal commitment to make it so.
Resolving these old tensions and com
ing up with a solution that can preserve
and even improve one of Stanford's great
assets ought to be a first order of busi
ness for the commission. A good way to
start would be to consult the real pio
neers of this system â€” especially Profes
sor Mark Mancall, who in the 1960s
developed the very first successful
"theme house" (He is also the original
source of much that is good in SLE and
Overseas Studies, so he gives the com
mission a consulting trifecta on innova
tion in undergraduate education).
Attention to Res Ed is imperative for
two reasons. First, the program has lost
two of its most knowledgeable and capa
ble staff, and some loss of momentum is
possible. Second, our attention has been
captured by other things, and it may be
tempting to treat this area with benign
neglect. That would be a tragic mistake,
and the commission can ensure that we
don't make it.
