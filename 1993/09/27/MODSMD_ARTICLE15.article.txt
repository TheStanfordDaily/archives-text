# From soccer to SLAC: Summer at Stanford
## 
### 
June 1993
Berhane Andeberhan resigned
as Stanford's women's soccer
coach amid charges of player
abuse, accepting a new position
within the Athletic Department
as liaison to U.S. Soccer and
World Cup 1994.
The reassignment was report
edly spurred by complaints that
Andeberhan verbally abused
team members. Players com
plained that the coach engaged in
psychological tug-of-wars. Fifteen
players and three parents filed
complaints with Stanford Athletic
Director Ted Leland last April.
In response to the charges,
Leland issued a statement assert
ing that "there is no excuse for
any student to be physically or
psychologically demeaned in any
setting."

A task force appointed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
announced plans for major orga
nizational changes in the struc
ture of Stanford Medical Center.
The restructuring is meant to
keep the hospital competitive in
the changing health care market
place.
"The task force has proposed
solutions to problems that affect
Stanford and all other academic
medical centers," Casper said. "A
response now to the changing
marketplace is essential to pre
serving the academic mission of
the School of Medicine, and that
is the number one priority of the
task force."

The Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society CIV track was
canceled for the 1993-94 academ
ic year due to the loss of the pro
gram's coordinator and the reor
ganization of the program.
Senior Lecturer Barry Katz,

who coordinated the VTSS track,
is on leave from Stanford this
year, and an appropriate substi
tute cannot be secured until the
end of this quarter, according to
Walter Vincenti, chair of the
VTSS program.

rebounded from last spring's fire

the Department of Energy Sun
rayce. The team is now preparing

lenge in Australia.

July 1993
Faced with an unusually low
percentage of alumni who are
annual donors, the Office of
Development announced plans to
significantly change its fund-rais
ing approaches over the next year.
According to John Ford, vice
president for development, new
programs focusing on market
research as well as the "segmen
tation" of direct-mail programs
would attempt to broaden the
support base among alumni.
Currently, 23 percent of all
Stanford graduates donate annu
ally, one of the lowest rates
among leading research institu
tions. Some Ivy League schools
have participation rates as high as
40 or 50 percent.

The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center received small quanti
ties of plutonium and neptunium
on July 9 to be used in a set of
experiments investigating safer
ways of storing nuclear wastes.
A group of experts from Los
Alamos National Laboratory
arrived with the plutonium at the
end of June. The early experi
ment experienced no problems.
The experiments are being con
ducted at the Stanford Syn

chrotron Radiation Laboratory at
SLAC, because it is one of the few
places in the world that is able to
create the needed X-ray.
