# From soccer to SLAC: Summer at Stanford
## 
### 
June 1993
Berhane Andeberhan resigned
as Stanford's women's soccer
coach amid charges of player
abuse, accepting a new position
within the Athletic Department
as liaison to U.S. Soccer and
World Cup 1994.
The reassignment was report
edly spurred by complaints that
Andeberhan verbally abused
team members. Players com
plained that the coach engaged in
psychological tug-of-wars. Fifteen
players and three parents filed
complaints with Stanford Athletic
Director Ted Leland last April.
In response to the charges,
Leland issued a statement assert
ing that "there is no excuse for
any student to be physically or
psychologically demeaned in any
setting."

A task force appointed by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
announced plans for major orga
nizational changes in the struc
ture of Stanford Medical Center.
The restructuring is meant to
keep the hospital competitive in
the changing health care market
place.
"The task force has proposed
solutions to problems that affect
Stanford and all other academic
medical centers," Casper said. "A
response now to the changing
marketplace is essential to pre
serving the academic mission of
the School of Medicine, and that
is the number one priority of the
task force."

The Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society CIV track was
canceled for the 1993-94 academ
ic year due to the loss of the pro
gram's coordinator and the reor
ganization of the program.
Senior Lecturer Barry Katz,

who coordinated the VTSS track,
is on leave from Stanford this
year, and an appropriate substi
tute cannot be secured until the
end of this quarter, according to
Walter Vincenti, chair of the
VTSS program.

The Stanford Solar Car Project
rebounded from last spring's fire
disaster by taking fifth place at
the Department of Energy Sun
rayce. The team is now preparing
for November's World Solar Chal
lenge in Australia.

July 1993
Faced with an unusually low
percentage of alumni who are
annual donors, the Office of
Development announced plans to
significantly change its fund-rais
ing approaches over the next year.
According to John Ford, vice
president for development, new
programs focusing on market
research as well as the "segmen
tation" of direct-mail programs
would attempt to broaden the
support base among alumni.
Currently, 23 percent of all
Stanford graduates donate annu
ally, one of the lowest rates
among leading research institu
tions. Some Ivy League schools
have participation rates as high as
40 or 50 percent.

The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center received small quanti
ties of plutonium and neptunium
on July 9 to be used in a set of
experiments investigating safer
ways of storing nuclear wastes.
A group of experts from Los
Alamos National Laboratory
arrived with the plutonium at the
end of June. The early experi
ment experienced no problems.
The experiments are being con
ducted at the Stanford Syn

chrotron Radiation Laboratory at
SLAC, because it is one of the few
places in the world that is able to
create the needed X-ray.

Law Prof. Tom Campbell, a
former member of the U.S. House

of Representatives, announced he

Webb Ranch employee Augustin Gonzalez, displaced from his trail
er home since February, stands outside the workers' spartan dor
mitory; delays In completing housing for workers' families stand at

The United Stanford Workers,
the University's labor union, said
it will file a formal complaint with
the National Labor Relations
Board if worker's trailers are not
improved by Aug. 1, four months
later than the original March
deadline set by the USW.
August 1993
Much-anticipated changes to
Federal Circular A-21 — the reg

ulations that govern indirect
costs — were finally adopted by
the Clinton administration.
One of the mtyor changes in
the regulations is the end of
tuition remission, the system of
government reimbursement for a
part of the tuition of graduate
students involved in federally
sponsored research, effective
September 1997.
Other A-21 changes included:
the continued cap on administra
tive costs at 26 percent of total indi
rect costs, the inclusion of student
services in these administrative
costs and the implementation of a
more complex accounting system.

A sheriffs investigation of a
May 17 racial incident at Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center turned
up a big goose egg — but some
SLAC workers still cried foul play.
After spending a week and a
half on campus and interviewing
15 to 20 people, Detective David
W. Hayes of the San Mateo Coun
ty Sheriffs Department was not
able to determine who chalked
the message, "Go Home, Jap" and
stuck a knife into the office door
of Chuck Taniguchi, a SLAC
storeroom manager.
September 1993
A fire destroyed a shed
between Otero and the resident
fellow's cottage Sept. 4. Damage
extended to the resident fellow's
kitchen and the residence hall's
stairwell. There were no injuries.
