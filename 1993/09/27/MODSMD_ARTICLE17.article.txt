## Cardinal fumbles game away against UCLA Mistakes costly in Stanford's narrow 28-25 loss to Bruins 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Gunning for its third come
back win in as many weeks, the
cardiac Cardinal fell about one
minute, one long pass play or one
time-out short of a victory as
Stanford succumbed to a strong
UCLA ground game to lose 28-25
at home Saturday.
Once again, Stanford suffered
from an inconsistent defense and
their lack of a running game. But
unlike in their previous two out
ings, those setbacks, along with a
healthy number of turnovers,
created too big of a hole for quar
terback Steve Stenstrom to
throw out of.
"The bottom line is the easy
scores we gave the Bruins, and
that was the difference," said
Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh, whose lifetime record
against UCLA fell to 2-2.
At first, it didn't look like
there was going to be any UCLA
scoring at all. On the Bruins' first
possession, the Cardinal defense
was nearly impenetrable and held
UCLA to three plays before forc
ing a punt.
But then Stanford began to
play like the young team it is.
Freshman Leroy Pruitt received
the Bruin punt and looked like a
reincarnation of Glyn Milburn as
he dodged and dashed for 21
yards — before fumbling the foot
ball. This gave the Bruins excel
lent field position, leading to a
UCLA field goal after the Cardi
nal defense made an impressive

stand at their own 20-yard-line.
But when the Stanford finally
earned possession of the ball,
their offense wasn't up to the
task. After three plays, Stanford
was forced to punt. The almost
total absence of a running game
manifested itself early.
"I sense frustration from
everyone on offense that we can't
run the football," said Stenstrom.
"And I think we have the person
nel to do it — that's the most
frustrating thing. We've got good
backs, a great [offensive! line, we
do well in practice, the coaching
staff gives us good schemes, but
we can't do it in the games."
That wasn't the case for
UCLA. Bruin running back Shar
mon Shah, who wasn't even sup
posed to play, burned the incon
sistent Cardinal run defense for
187 yards.
"I was worried — I didn't take
a hand-off or hit all week," said
Shah, a sophomore. "My line
blocked great. We really needed
this win, and I felt that if I could
contribute, I would."
"He actually came in on the
last minute," said UCLA coach
Terry Donahue. "His knees are
really bad and he had a lot of pain
between games. He asked me if
he could come play."
After the Stanford punt,
UCLA marched down the field
until it faced a first-and-goal situ
ation at the Stanford six-yard
line. But the Cardinal defense
held their ground, forcing the
