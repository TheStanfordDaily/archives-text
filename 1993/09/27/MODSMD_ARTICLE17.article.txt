## Cardinal fumbles game away against UCLA Mistakes costly in Stanford's narrow 28-25 loss to Bruins 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Gunning for its third come
back win in as many weeks, the
cardiac Cardinal fell about one
minute, one long pass play or one
time-out short of a victory as
Stanford succumbed to a strong
UCLA ground game to lose 28-25
at home Saturday.
Once again, Stanford suffered
from an inconsistent defense and
their lack of a running game. But
unlike in their previous two out
ings, those setbacks, along with a
healthy number of turnovers,
created too big of a hole for quar
terback Steve Stenstrom to
throw out of.
"The bottom line is the easy
scores we gave the Bruins, and
that was the difference," said
Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh, whose lifetime record
against UCLA fell to 2-2.
At first, it didn't look like
there was going to be any UCLA
scoring at all. On the Bruins' first
possession, the Cardinal defense
was nearly impenetrable and held
UCLA to three plays before forc
ing a punt.
But then Stanford began to
play like the young team it is.
Freshman Leroy Pruitt received
the Bruin punt and looked like a
reincarnation of Glyn Milburn as
he dodged and dashed for 21
yards — before fumbling the foot
ball. This gave the Bruins excel
lent field position, leading to a
UCLA field goal after the Cardi
nal defense made an impressive

stand at their own 20-yard-line.
But when the Stanford finally
earned possession of the ball,
their offense wasn't up to the
task. After three plays, Stanford
was forced to punt. The almost
total absence of a running game
manifested itself early.
"I sense frustration from
everyone on offense that we can't
run the football," said Stenstrom.
"And I think we have the person
nel to do it — that's the most
frustrating thing. We've got good
backs, a great [offensive! line, we
do well in practice, the coaching
staff gives us good schemes, but
we can't do it in the games."
That wasn't the case for
UCLA. Bruin running back Shar
mon Shah, who wasn't even sup
posed to play, burned the incon
sistent Cardinal run defense for
187 yards.
"I was worried — I didn't take
a hand-off or hit all week," said
Shah, a sophomore. "My line
blocked great. We really needed
this win, and I felt that if I could
contribute, I would."
"He actually came in on the
last minute," said UCLA coach
Terry Donahue. "His knees are
really bad and he had a lot of pain
between games. He asked me if
he could come play."
After the Stanford punt,
UCLA marched down the field
until it faced a first-and-goal situ
ation at the Stanford six-yard
line. But the Cardinal defense
held their ground, forcing the

Bruins to settle for three points.
After another short offensive
series, the Cardinal defense took
the field and looked impressive
once again, slowing the Bruin
offense and then forcing a fumble.
"We're playing better defense
every week," said Walsh.
"I feel just frustrated because
in the first quarter we were play
ing just great," said Stanford
defensive end David Carder. "And
then we didn't."
After Stanford recovered the
fumble, Stenstrom and the
offense drove down the field in 13

plays and scored a touchdown on a
Stenstrom pass to Elleiy Roberts.
With the Cardinal leading 7-6,
the Stanford defense began to give
way as the Bruins drove 80 yards,
mostly on the ground, for a touch
down and a six-point lead.
Once again the offense misfired
when given their chance with the
ball. On the first play from scrim
mage after the kick-off, Roberts
fumbled the football, giving UCLA
excellent field position which
eventually led to a field goal, giv
ing the Bruins a 16-7 lead at the
half.
The Cardinal offense seemed to
be getting on track after a 29-yard
pass play to Roberts. On the very
next play, however, freshman
running back Mike Mitchell fum

bled the ball, which was recovered
by the Bruins and returned for a
touchdown.
"Mistakes are all right for
spring ball, but this is the regular
season," said Stenstrom. "We
can't do that."
After Stanford noseguard
Jason Fisk blocked the extra point
attempt, the ensuing kickoff
return saw Cornelia catch the ball
and then lateral it across the field
to Mitchell, who returned it for an
electrifying 34 yards. On the ensu
ing play, the Cardinal saw another
freshman complete the scoring
drive as Stenstrom tossed a 36-
yard touchdown strike to Brian
Manning.
"It's pleasing to see Brian Man
ning coming into his own," said

Walsh. Manning finished the day
with five catches for 93 yards.
After an exchange of punts,
UCLA capped a 51-yard scoring
drive with a six-yard pass to Bruin
receiver J.J. Stokes. In an unusu
al turn of events, Fisk again
blocked the extra-point attempt.
Then the turnover bug bit
again as Stenstrom threw an
interception which gave UCLA
excellent field position. But after a
49-yard drive, the UCLA field-goal
attempt was no good.
Stanford took the ball from
their own 33 and, in four straight
passing plays, rattled off three
straight first downs, capped by a
30-yard pass from Stenstrom to
Justin Armour for a touchdown.
The two-point conversion, a bullet

down the middle to Tony Cline,
closed the margin to 25-28.
After Stanford failed to recover
an onside kick, the defense
stopped the Bruins in three plays.
However, Stanford's lack of time
outs allowed the clock to run down
to 39 seconds before the offense
took possession of the ball on their
own 14-yard line.
A few long pass plays fell
incomplete, and the game ended
with Stanford comeback falling
just short of its goal.
"The frustrating thing is that
we left [the scoring] to the end of
the game," said Stenstrom, who
ended the day 22-for-34 for 313
yards and three touchdowns. "It's
better if we don't do this to our
selves every week."

49-yard drive, the UCLA field-goal
attempt was no good.
Stanford took the ball from
their own 33 and, in four straight
passing plays, rattled off three
straight first downs, capped by a
30-yard pass from Stenstrom to
Justin Armour for a touchdown.
The two-point conversion, a bullet

down the middle to Tony Cline,
closed the margin to 25-28.
After Stanford failed to recover
an onside kick, the defense
stopped the Bruins in three plays.
However, Stanford's lack of time
outs allowed the clock to run down
to 39 seconds before the offense
took possession of the ball on their
own 14-yard line.
A few long pass plays fell
incomplete, and the game ended
with Stanford comeback falling
just short of its goal.
"The frustrating thing is that
we left [the scoring] to the end of
the game," said Stenstrom, who
ended the day 22-for-34 for 313
yards and three touchdowns. "It's
better if we don't do this to our
selves every week."
Gunning for its third come
back win in as many weeks, the
cardiac Cardinal fell about one
minute, one long pass play or one
time-out short of a victory as
Stanford succumbed to a strong
UCLA ground game to lose 28-25
at home Saturday.
Once again, Stanford suffered
from an inconsistent defense and
their lack of a running game. But
unlike in their previous two out
ings, those setbacks, along with a
healthy number of turnovers,
created too big of a hole for quar
terback Steve Stenstrom to
throw out of.
"The bottom line is the easy
scores we gave the Bruins, and
that was the difference," said
Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh, whose lifetime record
against UCLA fell to 2-2.
At first, it didn't look like
there was going to be any UCLA
scoring at all. On the Bruins' first
possession, the Cardinal defense
was nearly impenetrable and held
UCLA to three plays before forc
ing a punt.
But then Stanford began to
play like the young team it is.
Freshman Leroy Pruitt received
the Bruin punt and looked like a
reincarnation of Glyn Milburn as
he dodged and dashed for 21
yards — before fumbling the foot
ball. This gave the Bruins excel
lent field position, leading to a
UCLA field goal after the Cardi
nal defense made an impressive

stand at their own 20-yard-line.
But when the Stanford finally
earned possession of the ball,
their offense wasn't up to the
task. After three plays, Stanford
was forced to punt. The almost
total absence of a running game
manifested itself early.
"I sense frustration from
everyone on offense that we can't
run the football," said Stenstrom.
"And I think we have the person
nel to do it — that's the most
frustrating thing. We've got good
backs, a great [offensive! line, we
do well in practice, the coaching
staff gives us good schemes, but
we can't do it in the games."
That wasn't the case for
UCLA. Bruin running back Shar
mon Shah, who wasn't even sup
posed to play, burned the incon
sistent Cardinal run defense for
187 yards.
"I was worried — I didn't take
a hand-off or hit all week," said
Shah, a sophomore. "My line
blocked great. We really needed
this win, and I felt that if I could
contribute, I would."
"He actually came in on the
last minute," said UCLA coach
Terry Donahue. "His knees are
really bad and he had a lot of pain
between games. He asked me if
he could come play."
After the Stanford punt,
UCLA marched down the field
until it faced a first-and-goal situ
ation at the Stanford six-yard
line. But the Cardinal defense
held their ground, forcing the

Bruins to settle for three points.
After another short offensive
series, the Cardinal defense took
the field and looked impressive
once again, slowing the Bruin
offense and then forcing a fumble.
"We're playing better defense
every week," said Walsh.
"I feel just frustrated because
in the first quarter we were play
ing just great," said Stanford
defensive end David Carder. "And
then we didn't."
After Stanford recovered the
fumble, Stenstrom and the
offense drove down the field in 13

plays and scored a touchdown on a
Stenstrom pass to Elleiy Roberts.
With the Cardinal leading 7-6,
the Stanford defense began to give
way as the Bruins drove 80 yards,
mostly on the ground, for a touch
down and a six-point lead.
Once again the offense misfired
when given their chance with the
ball. On the first play from scrim
mage after the kick-off, Roberts
fumbled the football, giving UCLA
excellent field position which
eventually led to a field goal, giv
ing the Bruins a 16-7 lead at the
half.
The Cardinal offense seemed to
be getting on track after a 29-yard
pass play to Roberts. On the very
next play, however, freshman
running back Mike Mitchell fum

bled the ball, which was recovered
by the Bruins and returned for a
touchdown.
"Mistakes are all right for
spring ball, but this is the regular
season," said Stenstrom. "We
can't do that."
After Stanford noseguard
Jason Fisk blocked the extra point
attempt, the ensuing kickoff
return saw Cornelia catch the ball
and then lateral it across the field
to Mitchell, who returned it for an
electrifying 34 yards. On the ensu
ing play, the Cardinal saw another
freshman complete the scoring
drive as Stenstrom tossed a 36-
yard touchdown strike to Brian
Manning.
"It's pleasing to see Brian Man
ning coming into his own," said

Walsh. Manning finished the day
with five catches for 93 yards.
After an exchange of punts,
UCLA capped a 51-yard scoring
drive with a six-yard pass to Bruin
receiver J.J. Stokes. In an unusu
al turn of events, Fisk again
blocked the extra-point attempt.
Then the turnover bug bit
again as Stenstrom threw an
interception which gave UCLA
excellent field position. But after a
49-yard drive, the UCLA field-goal
attempt was no good.
Stanford took the ball from
their own 33 and, in four straight
passing plays, rattled off three
