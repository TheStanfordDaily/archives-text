# Slip-sliding away: turnovers Cardinal's Achilles heel
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
The much-maligned Stanford defense
began Saturday's game by stuffing the
Bruins. Three-and-out; Cardinal faithful
could not ask for a more hopeful sign.
Soon, the ball would be in the competent
clutches of the highly-potent Stanford
offense, and a few Steve Stenstrom-to-
Justin Armour passes would put the game
under Cardinal control.
But the sawy senior quarterback was
not going to get his hands on the football.
For before the Cardinal offense could take
the field, Stanford punt returner Leroy

Pruitt coughed up the ball after a 21-yard
return, setting up a quick Bruin field goal.
It was a play that would set the tone for the
entire game.
"It was a middle return on the punt,"
Pruitt, a freshman from Lees Summit,
Mo., said. "It was set up well by the block
ers. I saw a little hole and was running for
it. I tried to leap over a defender and when
I was coming down I got careless with the
ball and got stripped."
Over the course of the game, the boys
from Westwood snatched four turnovers
from the hands of the Stanford offense —
three fumble recoveries and a pass inter
ception — resulting in 13 UCLA points.

More importantly, the Bruins were able to
hold the ball for over 13 minutes in posses
sions begun with either an interception or
fumble recovery. These minutes made the
difference in the game, as time ran out on
the Cardinal's final drive.
Interestingly enough, though, the Car
dinal offense was back on the field only sec
onds after the most crucial turnover of the
game. With UCLA up by a 16-10 margin,
Stanford's offense was driving, and a 29-
yard pass to Ellery Roberts gave the home
team a first down on their own 36-yard
line.
On the ensuing play Stenstrom tossed a
lateral to freshman running back Mike

Mitchell, who was stopped immediately,
stood up and then knocked back by the
swarming Bruin defense. Then the pigskin
squirted free and backwards, toward the
Cardinal goal line. Bruin strong safety
Mavin Goodwin tracked down the ball and
pranced into the end zone untouched to
stretch the UCLA lead to 22-10.
"I had the ball, then I lost it," Mitchell
said. "I thought I was down. They were
yanking at the ball and it just popped
out. ... It ended up costing us the game."
"I think some of our younger players
made some tragic mistakes, but they
showed great potential," said
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh.
"We just want to capitalize on
that potential."
And capitalize they did, on the
following kickofT. Freshman Greg
Cornelia hauled in the kick, took a
few steps, then lateraled the ball
fifteen yards sideways to Mitchell.
The Phoenix native danced away
from a would-be Bruin tackier,
then raced upfield, neatly avoid
ing most of UCLA's kickoff team.
But, after running into a fellow
Cardinal, Mitchell was pulled
down from behind, 37 yards from
where Cornelia originally caught
the kick. Without question, it was
the most dazzling play of the
game.
"I had to make up for it (the
fumble)," a disconsolate Mitchell
said afler the game. "I had to take
[the kickoffl back."
The freshmen were not the
only Cardinal players responsible
for the rash of turnovers. Senior
leaders Roberts and Stenstrom
were also guilty of Cardinal mis
cues.
Toward the end of the first half
fullback Roberts broke free and
rumbled for 24 yards. But once in
the open field, Roberts was
stripped from behind. The ball
was jarred loose and UCLA cor
nerback Teddy Lawrence covered
it up quickly, giving Roberts an
ignominious finish to his longest
run of the game.
"I felt someone grab my waist

but I felt all these arms ripping at
my top," Roberts said. "I should
have remembered that I was in
the open field and I had gotten a
lot of yards. Don't struggle for
yards there; protect the ball."

Goodwin, the Bruin hero who
scored the touchdown off
Mitchell's fumble, also came up
with another big play against
Stenstrom. With 12 minutes
remaining in the game, the UCLA
strong safety nabbed a deep pass
that seemed intended for the
Bruin secondary, rather than any
member of the Cardinal receiving
corps.
"I didn't read the play well,"
Stenstrom said. "I thought I had
an open middle of the field. I was
just trying to lay it out for Justin
Armour; it was a misread on my
part."
In Stanford's last two wins, it
was a powerful Cardinal offense
that had to bail out an ailing
defense which was giving up more
than 500 yards a game. Against
UCLA, though, it was the offense
that could not produce, forcing
the defense onto the field for
more than 37 minutes. But senior
captain and starting cornerback
Vaughn Bryant would not blame
the loss solely on critical
turnovers.
"We put a lot of pressure on
the offense because we can't stop
people on third down," he said.
"It goes hand-in-hand."
"Big plays and turnovers win
football games," said a frustrated
Roberts. "If we had held on to the
ball, even if we hadn't scored,
they would have had to work a lot
harder to score points."

Brian Manning makes a spectacular touchdown catch. Although he dropped the ball, the officials ruled
the play a touchdown.
