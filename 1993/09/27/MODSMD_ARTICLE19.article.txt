# Slip-sliding away: turnovers Cardinal's Achilles heel
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
The much-maligned Stanford defense
began Saturday's game by stuffing the
Bruins. Three-and-out; Cardinal faithful
could not ask for a more hopeful sign.
Soon, the ball would be in the competent
clutches of the highly-potent Stanford
offense, and a few Steve Stenstrom-to-
Justin Armour passes would put the game
under Cardinal control.
But the sawy senior quarterback was
not going to get his hands on the football.
For before the Cardinal offense could take
the field, Stanford punt returner Leroy

Pruitt coughed up the ball after a 21-yard
return, setting up a quick Bruin field goal.
It was a play that would set the tone for the
entire game.
"It was a middle return on the punt,"
Pruitt, a freshman from Lees Summit,
Mo., said. "It was set up well by the block
ers. I saw a little hole and was running for
it. I tried to leap over a defender and when
I was coming down I got careless with the
ball and got stripped."
Over the course of the game, the boys
from Westwood snatched four turnovers
from the hands of the Stanford offense —
three fumble recoveries and a pass inter
ception — resulting in 13 UCLA points.

More importantly, the Bruins were able to
hold the ball for over 13 minutes in posses
sions begun with either an interception or
fumble recovery. These minutes made the
difference in the game, as time ran out on
the Cardinal's final drive.
Interestingly enough, though, the Car
dinal offense was back on the field only sec
onds after the most crucial turnover of the
game. With UCLA up by a 16-10 margin,
Stanford's offense was driving, and a 29-
yard pass to Ellery Roberts gave the home
team a first down on their own 36-yard
line.
On the ensuing play Stenstrom tossed a
lateral to freshman running back Mike

Mitchell, who was stopped immediately,
stood up and then knocked back by the
swarming Bruin defense. Then the pigskin
squirted free and backwards, toward the
Cardinal goal line. Bruin strong safety
Mavin Goodwin tracked down the ball and
pranced into the end zone untouched to
stretch the UCLA lead to 22-10.
"I had the ball, then I lost it," Mitchell
said. "I thought I was down. They were
yanking at the ball and it just popped
out. ... It ended up costing us the game."
"I think some of our younger players
made some tragic mistakes, but they
