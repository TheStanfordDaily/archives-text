# Casper examines multicultural issues
## In speech, president urges balance between personal heritage and 'interactive pluralism' 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Defining his views on Stanford's role in
promoting multiculturalism in student life,
University President Gerhard Casper said
last week that students should take more re
sponsibility in developing their own cultural
agendas.
The University itself has to create a deli
cate balance of encouraging each person's
own cultural exploration while maintaining a
strong environment for "interactive plural
ism," he said.
"It is not for the university in its institu
tional role to tell you to blend in or to remain
separate, to embrace an 'amalgam' or to reject
it," Casper said to an audience of more than
1,000 at Frost Amphitheater on Thursday.
Stanford's policy is "a commitment to active
ly learning about and interacting with a vari

ety of different people."
Casper told the members of Class of '97
and their parents that students should use re
sources provided by Stanford to form their
cultural views while the University itself de
votes its energy to education.
The speech, titled "Concerning Culture
and Cultures," encouraged the freshmen to
take full advantage of the opportunities at
Stanford to meet "strangers" of other cul
tures.
"The University is an institution dedicated
to the search to know, the search to know of
each member in her or his individual capaci
ty," he said.
In his speech, Casper responded to a ques
tion posed to him in a letter from the parent of
recent graduate. The parent addressed the
apparent ethnic segregation in the schedule
of events in last year's Commencement and
asked, "Aren't we trying to create an amal

gam of American culture rather than a ca
cophony?"
Casper addressed this question by saying
that it is the University's business to create
neither. Students, like everyone else, have
their own individual aspirations and inter
ests, he said, and when they are congregating
together they are not necessarily segregating
themselves from everyone else.
"Almost all of us have a tendency to hang
out with people who are familiar . . . who are
'our own kind,' " he said.
While defending the purpose of ethnic
theme houses, Casper said he believes it is the
responsibility of the University and its stu
dents, parents and alumni to do "their utmost
to minimize the chances for exclusion, even as
we provide opportunities for identifying one's
social heritage."
