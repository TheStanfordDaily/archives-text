# Casper examines multicultural issues
## In speech, president urges balance between personal heritage and 'interactive pluralism' 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Defining his views on Stanford's role in
promoting multiculturalism in student life,
University President Gerhard Casper said
last week that students should take more re
sponsibility in developing their own cultural
agendas.
The University itself has to create a deli
cate balance of encouraging each person's
own cultural exploration while maintaining a
strong environment for "interactive plural
ism," he said.
"It is not for the university in its institu
tional role to tell you to blend in or to remain
separate, to embrace an 'amalgam' or to reject
it," Casper said to an audience of more than
1,000 at Frost Amphitheater on Thursday.
Stanford's policy is "a commitment to active
ly learning about and interacting with a vari

ety of different people."
Casper told the members of Class of '97
and their parents that students should use re
sources provided by Stanford to form their
cultural views while the University itself de
votes its energy to education.
The speech, titled "Concerning Culture
and Cultures," encouraged the freshmen to
take full advantage of the opportunities at
Stanford to meet "strangers" of other cul
tures.
"The University is an institution dedicated
to the search to know, the search to know of
each member in her or his individual capaci
ty," he said.
In his speech, Casper responded to a ques
tion posed to him in a letter from the parent of
recent graduate. The parent addressed the
apparent ethnic segregation in the schedule
of events in last year's Commencement and
asked, "Aren't we trying to create an amal

gam of American culture rather than a ca
cophony?"
Casper addressed this question by saying
that it is the University's business to create
neither. Students, like everyone else, have
their own individual aspirations and inter
ests, he said, and when they are congregating
together they are not necessarily segregating
themselves from everyone else.
"Almost all of us have a tendency to hang
out with people who are familiar . . . who are
'our own kind,' " he said.
While defending the purpose of ethnic
theme houses, Casper said he believes it is the
responsibility of the University and its stu
dents, parents and alumni to do "their utmost
to minimize the chances for exclusion, even as
we provide opportunities for identifying one's
social heritage."
Casper used himself as an
example of someone who has
integrated into a community
while maintaining personal
cultural heritage. He talked
about the difficulties he first
faced when he came to the
United States 30 years ago,
particularly trying to overcome
the image that all Germans
were Nazis.
He added that now he has
"only one identity . . . [that]
reflects myriad cultural influ
ences and role expectations"
such as father, son, professor and
university president.
Senior Dana Weeks, coordina
tor for the Black Recruitment
Orientation Committee, said she
was impressed that Casper men
tioned "some multicultural
issues, including his own differ
ences."
As an example of a University
policy to prevent exclusion,
Casper pointed out that no more
than 50 percent of the residents
in an ethnic theme house can
belong to that ethnic group.
At this point in the speech,
Casper warned the freshmen of
the dangers of simply thinking
along racial lines.
"In a university discussion,
your first question in a response
to an argument must never be
'Does she belong to the right
group?' Instead, the only criteri
on is 'Does she have a valid argu
ment?' "

Casper said that in "'a nation
of immigrants such as ours,"
one cannot afford to create cul
tural boundaries. Quoting
Anthropology Prof. Renato Ros
aldo, Casper added that "we all
cross social boundaries in our
daily lives. ... a round that
includes home, eating out,
working hours, adventures in
consumerland, and a range of
relationships, from intimacy to

collegiality and friendship to
enmity."
Casper added that it is the
freedom of expression Stanford
fosters that makes multicultur
alism so strong here. "Studies
cannot blossom and minds can
not move unless these (consti
tutional) rights prevail, unless
the winds of freedom blow" —
the translation of Stanford's
motto.
