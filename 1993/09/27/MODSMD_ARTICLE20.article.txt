# Back on the winning track
## Women's spikers defeat Arizona and Arizona St. in Maples Pavilion sweep 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The defending national champions are
certainly not used to holding an 0-2 Pacific
Ten Conference record.
However, the No. 5 Stanford women's
volleyball team (7-2, 2-2 in the Pac-10)
hastily improved upon this record over the
weekend by defeating No. 17 Arizona State
(7-2, 1-2 in the Pac-10) in four games on
Thursday night in Maples Pavilion, then
chalking up another victory the following
evening by sweeping No. 20 Arizona (6-3, 2-
1 Pac-10) at home.
"I'm happy with the way we played,"
said coach Don Shaw. "We're a team that
usually wins, then we lost two in a row —
we weren't really used to that."
Yet the weekend did not get off to a per
fectly smooth start. Both the Thursday
night crowd and the Stanford squad could
feel the tension mounting as the Cardinal
dropped the first game of their match to the
Sun Devils, 15-5. Accustomed to hitting
near .200 percent, Stanford hit a miserable
-.029 in the game.
"We got off to a shaky start," Shaw said.
"I was at a loss. It seemed like we were com
pletely self-destructing."
The start of the second game was closely
contested, with an early score of 5-5. On the
verge of an embarrassing loss, Stanford
managed to turn things around. The Cardi
nal surged out in front and outpaced Ari
zona State for the rest of the battle, hitting
.343 to the Sun Devils' .049 .
"We knew we could play better than
that," said sophomore Cary Wendell. "Once
we loosened up, we got more aggressive and
really went for balls — we just started hav
ing more fun."
After working through its early-game jit
ters, Stanford settled into a groove and
dominated the last two games, winning the
match 5-15, 15-8, 15-4, 15-7.
The Cardinal continued its winning
drive on Friday, downing the Wildcats 15-4,
15-10, 15-9 while topping Arizona's offense
.343 to .103.
Shaw's goal is a team hitting average at

least .100 points above that of each oppo
nent, a feat which Stanford accomplished
against both Arizona and Arizona St.. He
attributed much of this wide margin to an
increased defensive effort.
"If we can hold our opponents down,
that's when we're going to get our
chances," Shaw said.
Offensively, Shaw believed improve
ments in the Cardinal's middle attack bol
stered the team's performance. Against the
Wildcats, middle blockers Maureen
McLaren and Anne Wicks generated 13 kills
between them, thereby keeping Arizona off
balance.
Stanford also tried to keep their oppo
nent's defense unaware of where the Cardi
nal attack would be centered by varying the
speed and direction of its shots.
"The hitters tend to develop certain ten
dencies," Shaw said. "We're trying to devel
op a repertoire of shots so we can mix up
our offense."

Wendell led this weekend's offensive
blitz with a .429 hitting percentage against
Arizona State, with match highs of 18 kills
and 17 digs. Her stats dispelled any notions
of an early season downturn.
"I could feel us really starting to come
together," Wendell said. "We're a really
close group; we just had to start playing
that way."
Sophomore Marnie Triefenbach also
played a crucial offensive role. After sitting
out the first game against Arizona State
due to knee pain, she entered the match in
game two and hit .400 for the night, record
ing 16 kills in 30 attempts. Triefenbach
racked up a team high 12 kills for a .632
percentage against the Wildcats the follow
ing night.
In addition, senior setter Piper Hahn
turned in a typically strong performance
with 43 sets and 11 digs on Thursday, fol-

lowed by 34 sets and 9 digs
against Arizona. Pivotal to a suc
cessful Cardinal offense, Hahn
skillfully placed the ball in the
optimal positions for the setters
without alerting the defense of
the attack route.
Sophomores Wendy Hromad
ka and Maureen McLaren added

to the offensive drive by hitting
.316 and .364. Freshman Colleen
Miniuk saw her first collegiate
start Thursday night and gener
ated five kills.
The Cardinal looks to extend
its winning role in its home duel
against San Jose State Thursday
night. Stanford will play under
neath its 1992 Championship
banner, which will be unfurled
in a ceremony before the match.
"We've got to play well —
there's no doubt," Shaw said.

"They are definitely not to be
taken lightly."
He plans to place different
mixes of players on the court,
still experimenting with new
combinations and hoping for an
chance to view players who
didn't play over the weekend.
"I want to develop the depth
that we know we're capable of
having," Shaw said. "The key in
the end will be our ability to go
to the bench. Over the long haul,
that will be our advantage."

its winning role in its home duel
against San Jose State Thursday
night. Stanford will play under
neath its 1992 Championship
banner, which will be unfurled
in a ceremony before the match.
"We've got to play well —
there's no doubt," Shaw said.

"They are definitely not to be
taken lightly."
He plans to place different
mixes of players on the court,
still experimenting with new
combinations and hoping for an
chance to view players who
didn't play over the weekend.
"I want to develop the depth
that we know we're capable of
having," Shaw said. "The key in
the end will be our ability to go
to the bench. Over the long haul,
that will be our advantage."
The defending national champions are
certainly not used to holding an 0-2 Pacific
Ten Conference record.
However, the No. 5 Stanford women's
volleyball team (7-2, 2-2 in the Pac-10)
hastily improved upon this record over the
weekend by defeating No. 17 Arizona State
(7-2, 1-2 in the Pac-10) in four games on
Thursday night in Maples Pavilion, then
chalking up another victory the following
evening by sweeping No. 20 Arizona (6-3, 2-
1 Pac-10) at home.
"I'm happy with the way we played,"
said coach Don Shaw. "We're a team that
usually wins, then we lost two in a row —
we weren't really used to that."
Yet the weekend did not get off to a per
fectly smooth start. Both the Thursday
night crowd and the Stanford squad could
feel the tension mounting as the Cardinal
dropped the first game of their match to the
Sun Devils, 15-5. Accustomed to hitting
near .200 percent, Stanford hit a miserable
-.029 in the game.
"We got off to a shaky start," Shaw said.
"I was at a loss. It seemed like we were com
pletely self-destructing."
The start of the second game was closely
contested, with an early score of 5-5. On the
verge of an embarrassing loss, Stanford
managed to turn things around. The Cardi
nal surged out in front and outpaced Ari
zona State for the rest of the battle, hitting
.343 to the Sun Devils' .049 .
"We knew we could play better than
that," said sophomore Cary Wendell. "Once
we loosened up, we got more aggressive and
really went for balls — we just started hav
ing more fun."
After working through its early-game jit
ters, Stanford settled into a groove and
dominated the last two games, winning the
match 5-15, 15-8, 15-4, 15-7.
The Cardinal continued its winning
drive on Friday, downing the Wildcats 15-4,
15-10, 15-9 while topping Arizona's offense
.343 to .103.
Shaw's goal is a team hitting average at

least .100 points above that of each oppo
nent, a feat which Stanford accomplished
against both Arizona and Arizona St.. He
attributed much of this wide margin to an
increased defensive effort.
"If we can hold our opponents down,
that's when we're going to get our
chances," Shaw said.
Offensively, Shaw believed improve
ments in the Cardinal's middle attack bol
stered the team's performance. Against the
Wildcats, middle blockers Maureen
McLaren and Anne Wicks generated 13 kills
between them, thereby keeping Arizona off
balance.
Stanford also tried to keep their oppo
nent's defense unaware of where the Cardi
nal attack would be centered by varying the
speed and direction of its shots.
"The hitters tend to develop certain ten
dencies," Shaw said. "We're trying to devel
op a repertoire of shots so we can mix up
our offense."

Wendell led this weekend's offensive
blitz with a .429 hitting percentage against
Arizona State, with match highs of 18 kills
and 17 digs. Her stats dispelled any notions
of an early season downturn.
"I could feel us really starting to come
together," Wendell said. "We're a really
close group; we just had to start playing
that way."
Sophomore Marnie Triefenbach also
played a crucial offensive role. After sitting
out the first game against Arizona State
due to knee pain, she entered the match in
game two and hit .400 for the night, record
ing 16 kills in 30 attempts. Triefenbach
racked up a team high 12 kills for a .632
percentage against the Wildcats the follow
ing night.
In addition, senior setter Piper Hahn
turned in a typically strong performance
with 43 sets and 11 digs on Thursday, fol-

lowed by 34 sets and 9 digs
against Arizona. Pivotal to a suc
cessful Cardinal offense, Hahn
skillfully placed the ball in the
optimal positions for the setters
without alerting the defense of
the attack route.
Sophomores Wendy Hromad
ka and Maureen McLaren added

to the offensive drive by hitting
.316 and .364. Freshman Colleen
Miniuk saw her first collegiate
start Thursday night and gener
ated five kills.
