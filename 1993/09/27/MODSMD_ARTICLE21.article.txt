The top-ranked Stanford
water polo team displayed offen
sive and defensive balance Satur
day at deGuerre Pool, winning
their league- and home-opener
11-6 over the No. 4 UCLA Bruins.
Six different Cardinal players
scored, led by four goals by junior
Wolf Wigo.
Despite the lopsided score, the
game was intially much closer
than the final tally would indi
cate. Stanford trailed 2-1 at the
end of the first quarter after
UCLA's Scott Turner scored from
seven meters out, beyond the two
point line.
However, the new two-point
shot proved advantageous to
Stanford later in the second quar
ter when the 2-1 deficit turned
into a 5-2 Cardinal lead as Anto
nio Busquets and Wigo put the
ball in the net from long range.
"You definitely pay attention
to the (two-point) line," said
Wigo. "When you are free at
seven meters, you are looking to
get the ball to shoot. Those two
shots turned the game around
and were the key to our getting
out ahead."
Others were quick to praise the
junior's performance. "Wigo
sparked us today," said Cardinal
coach Dante Dettamanti. "He's
very talented offensively and has
been our leading scorer since he
was a freshman. When we really
needed a goal today, he put one
in."
"Most teams aren't using the
two-point shot until late in the
game, but it had an impact early
today," Dettamanti added. "We
usually try to give the opposi
tion's weaker shooters the shot
from outside, and one (Turner's

shot) went just over (goalie Larry)
Bercutt's arm."
With Stanford leading 6-2 in
the second quarter, a controver
sial call by the referee sparked the
Bruins, allowing them to score
three consecutive goals. UCLA's
Chris Kellerman capped off the
rally by scoring from close range
with just six seconds remaining in
the half.
"We gave them a chance to get
back in the game. We were up
four goals, then made a series of
mistakes and turnovers, " Detta
manti said. "Jeremy Laster was
ejected (for 20 seconds) for his
defense on the center-forward
position, and the game turned for
UCLA."
The Cardinal came out of half
time with an intense pressing
defense and proceeded to shut out
the Bruins until 20 seconds
remained in the game.
Dettamanti said he made no
specific changes to Stanford's
defense at halftime.
"We knew we just had to keep
playing our style of defense. We
couldn't continue to give up cheap
goals."
Throughout the second half,
the Cardinal defense consistently
held UCLA while playing short
handed due to ejected Stanford
players. The Bruins were score
less in six different 20-second
man-advantage situations and
scored only a penalty shot in the
final seconds of the game.
The key to Stanford's smother
ing of the Bruin attack was Ail-
American goalie Bercutt, who tal
lied 14 saves. Bercutt s most
important save came with just
four seconds left in the third
quarter when he stuffed UCLA's
