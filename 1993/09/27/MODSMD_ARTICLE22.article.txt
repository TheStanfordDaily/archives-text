# A 						slow beginning
## Men's kickers drop three matches, fall to 1-4-1 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
After beginning the season
with three closely fought match
es, the Stanford men's soccer
squad has since hit a three-game
skid, with their record dropping
to 1-4-1 after a loss to Old Domin
ion on Saturday.
The Cardinal entered last
weekend's Met Life Classic at Old
Dominion with hopes of rebound
ing from a 3-0 whitewashing at
the hands of Santa Clara on Tues
day. However, host Old Dominion
would not be stood up on their
home turf, as they pounded Stan
ford, 4-1.
Senior midfielder Ricky Goad
tried to ignite the Cardinal
defense in the first period by
rifling the ball past Monarch goal
keeper Tim Figureido 26 minutes
into the game. Despite 11 more
shots on goal during the match,
Stanford never put together

another goal-scoring rally.
After Goad tallied the first
point, Old Dominion answered
five minutes before the end of the
period with a Milo Iniguez goal.
Assisted by teammate Geof
Thompson, Iniguez powered the
ball past Cardinal goalkeeper
Terry Favazza.
In a poor defensive game,
Favazza was only able to save
four goals, while allowing the
same amount, before backup Jim
Masetti took over. Overall, the
Cardinal allowed 17 shots on goal,
as the Monarchs controlled the
Stanford backfield for most of the
game.
Entering the second period,
the Monarchs came out shooting
again, as Mike Moyer's attempt
found the back of the Cardinal
net. Teammates Gene Bowman
and Bucky Silva then put the
game out of reach with two more
goals within four minutes of each
other.

With this loss, the Cardinal's
disappointing record took anoth
er blow. At this time last year,
Stanford was off to a promising 5-
2 start, which would eventually
lead to a second-place finish in the
MPSF and an NCAA Tourna
ment berth.
However, this year, with a
plethora of young talent and a vis
ible lack of experience on this
squad, team members still predict
either a tremendous season, sur
passing last year's fmish, or a
rebuilding season with a weak
showing in the standings.
Coach Colin Lindores has indi
cated that the chemistry of this
team should be able to produce
quite a few championship years
for the Cardinal, despite the slow
start. Stanford will try to turn
things around this weekend as
they play host for the Bank of
America Cardinal Classic against
UC-Irvine and William and Mary
this weekend.
