# Women's soccer takes trifecta
## Victories over UCSB, Arkansas and Little Rock fill week 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The women's soccer team
rebounded from its surprise
upset at the hands of Washing
ton State with an important
win over a ranked team and
impressive overall play in a
weekend tournament in
Arkansas.
The Cardinal started off the
week with 3-0 victory over the
19th-ranked Gauchos of UC-
Santa Barbara Sept. 21. Stan
ford's defensive backfield limit
ed the Gauchos to only six shots
on goal, proving the Cardinal
capable of dominating top
teams.
Freshman Erin Martin was
the first Cardinal to find the net
against the Gauchos, heading
the ball in off a pass from Sarah
Rafanelli at the 18:29 mark of
the first half.
Fullback Jessica Fischer
scored on a penalty kick 38 min
utes into the game, and Martin
added her second goal of the
game off another assist from
Rafanelli in the second half.
Fischer's goal was her fourth in
the past three games.
The women's soccer team
then journeyed to Arkansas this
weekend for the second annual
Subway Classic.
The Cardinal defeated
Arkansas 3-0 on Saturday and

the University of Arkansas-Lit
tle Rock 8-0 on Sunday.
In Saturday's game, sopho
more Carmel Murphy opened
the scoring for Stanford with
her fourth goal of the year. The
score remained 1-0 until the
Cardinal forward duo of
Rafanelli and Martin scored
successive goals within a one
minute span.

'Stanford is by far
the best team that
we have faced this
season.'
â€” Janet Rayfield

"Obviously I'm disappointed
with the result, but I'm not dis
appointed with the effort put
out by our team," Arkansas
head coach Janet Rayfield said.
"Stanford is by far the best
team that we have faced this
season."
The Cardinal rounded out its
week of action by whitewashing
the Arkansas-Little Rock Tro
jans 8-0.
Overwhelming the Trojans,
Stanford outshot their oppo
nent by a 35-3 margin, led by
Martin's finest offensive game
of her short Stanford career.
The Cardinal first appeared on

the scoreboard via a goal by Mar
tin, her first of three in the game.
She added her second goal 29
minutes into the game, and
assisted on a mystery goal
attributed to Andrea Johnson
in the second half. The ques
tionable shot rebounded off Lit
tle Rock starter Tanya Franck,
with Johnson getting credit
because she was the closest Car
dinal to the goal.
Martin finished her hat trick
65 minutes into the game on an
assist by Rafanelli.
Freshman Alyze Lowen
added another goal, the first of
her Stanford career, and
Rafanelli tallied Stanford's
sixth goal of the game two min
utes later. Johnson scored the
Cardinal's last two goals in the
final five minutes of the game,
giving her the second Cardinal
hat trick of the day.
Cardinal goalkeeper Leslie
Garrard recorded her fifth and
sixth solo shutouts of the sea
son in the Santa Barbara and
Arkansas games, and combined
with Jennifer Poehler for a
shared shutout against Little
Rock. Stanford's defense has
only allowed two goals this
year, both coming in the 2-1
loss to the Cougars.
With the three wins this
week, the Cardinal pushed its
record to 7-1 for the season, 1-1
in Pacific 10 Conference play.
