The Twain Harte vacation home that has been
the center of a controversy surrounding the Stan
ford Bookstore has been sold to private owners for
$385,000, according to Robert Weisberg, interim
president of the Bookstore's.
The Daily reported in February 1992, that top
executives at the Stanford Bookstore enjoyed
perquisites unheard of in the college bookstore
industry, including company cars and the vaca
tion home.
The report prompted the California Attorney
General to open an investigation of possibly illegal
compensation practices at the non-profit organi
zation.
The vacation home was put on the market in
February after the Bookstore went through a
number of legal procedures last spring to obtain
the house from Colleagues Management Services,
Inc., a consulting company owned by the Book

store's top two executives, Philip Chiaramonte
and Eldon Speed. The consulting company owned
the vacation home and allowed top Bookstore
executives to use it free of charge.
Weisberg said Speed and Chiaramonte "gifted"
all of their stock in the consulting company to the
Bookstore, making the Bookstore the owner of
the company and the house. The Bookstore then
placed the vacation home on the market for
$450,000.
The $385,000 offer "was pretty good in a
depressed real estate market," Weisberg said. He
added that the house was sold to a private party
from Southern California who had no connection
with the Bookstore.
Weisberg would not disclose the closing date of
the deal.
The money from the sale of the house went to
Colleagues Management Services, but after the
sale, the consulting company was dissolved and
the money became part of the Bookstore's
assets.
