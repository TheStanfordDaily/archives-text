# Slum to swank — Wilbur's fairy-tale facelift
## But some residents irked by fire doors, unfinished work 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
There were whispers in the spring and jackham
mers in the summer, and when all the noise and dust
subsided, it seemed that Stanford's planners and
contractors did what only Rumplestiltskin had done
before them: they wove gold from straw.
One year and $8.4 million worth of planning and
construction have transformed Wilbur Hall, former
ly the drab ghetto of undergraduate housing, into a
developer's wildest pastel dream.
"I think it's a miracle," said Director of Student
Housing Services Rodger Whitney, who has been
closely involved with the Wilbur project since its be
ginning. "Some of the students see it and their
mouths just drop wide open — they can't believe it's
Wilbur."
Gone are the days of dark corridors, crumbling
wood, and cruel jokes about Stanford's largest dor
mitory. In their place are cheerily painted walls, win
dows sunnier than those in greenhouses, and what
Whitney describes as an "overwhelmingly positive"
response.
Even a fire this summer that destroyed a shed
next to Otero and damaged the resident fellow's cot
tage did not hinder the grand plans for Wilbur.
But the new shinier, happier Wilbur still has its
share of problems. New residents have complained
of keys and locks that don't work, bathrooms with no
signs indicating gender jurisdiction, and showers
with no curtains and only two water temperatures

— really hot and really cold. Some
computers in the computer clus
ters are not yet operational, but
will be ready for students when
classes begin, housing officials
said.
Whitney regarded such small
complications as inevitable in
such a project.
"We call them 'little things,'"
he said. "When you do a project of
this complexity in this sort of time
frame, there are bound to be
things like that. They shouldn't
affect student's lives."
Wilbur residents having diffi
culties with the "little things,"
aside from those who simply love
to complain, should call the hot
line they were furnished with
upon moving in, at 3-3000.
At least one problem with the
new Wilbur, however, is not a
small detail, but perhaps a design
problem. All the rooms are
equipped with doors which shut
automatically and violently after
each opening.
"I don't understand why they
have them," said sophomore and
new resident Christine Wong.
"They wake my roommate up
when I come in at night."
The doors are actually a fire
safety measure that was less
expensive than adding a sprinkler
system to the dorm. They are
designed to protect students'
rooms by confining a fire to the
area where it starts.
But the perpetually slamming
doors are troublesome not only in
their vigorous closing, but
because they are always closed.
"The closed doors don't con
tribute to a dorm atmosphere,"
one sophomore resident said.
Rich Holeton, a resident fellow
in Rinconada, agreed. In a meet
ing with the fire marshall tomor
row, Holeton hopes to find out if
students may prop their doors
open while in their rooms.
"We like people to open their
doors so they can get to know
each other" he said. "If they tell
us we can't open the doors,
there's going to be a real prob
lem."
In addition to its closed doors,
Wilbur's whole new look has
given it an atmosphere which
seems clean to some, and sterile
to others.
"One of our main goals was to

lighten and brighten," Whitney
said. "It brings the dorm into the
'905."
But Jeff Sarti, a sophomore
who lived in Wilbur as a freshman
but no longer lives there, found
Wilbur's new ambiance some
what disconcerting.
"It looks too much like a
hotel," he said. "It's nice and new,
but it's too cold. It's just not as
comfortable as before."
The success of another aspect
of Wilbur will also be determined
this week as the redesigned din
ing room's redesigned meal plan
begins to go into full swing. The
new plan, a combination of the
existing meal plans and points
plans, will offer both all-you-can
eat and a la carte items.
Some a la carte items, such as

special desserts and entrees, will
be sold for extra points at meals,
while other snack items, such as
candy bars and chips, will be sold
all day.
Clearly marked signs and dif
ferenty colored plates for points
items, will hopefully prevent con
fusion in the new system, said
Sue Nunan, the unit manager of
Wilbur's dining services. But, as
with the rest of the dorm, all
remains to be seen.
Pending evaluation forms will
allow for more student feedback
on all aspects of the dorm. For
now, though, most of Wilbur's
new residents feel they have a lot
to be thankful for.
"Well, I drew 2550," sopho
more Wong said. "It's a great bar
gain."

Large bricks are needed to keep residents' doors in Wilbur Hall
open. The doors offer fire protection, and close automatically.
