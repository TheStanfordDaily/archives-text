# Slum to swank — Wilbur's fairy-tale facelift
## But some residents irked by fire doors, unfinished work 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
There were whispers in the spring and jackham
mers in the summer, and when all the noise and dust
subsided, it seemed that Stanford's planners and
contractors did what only Rumplestiltskin had done
before them: they wove gold from straw.
One year and $8.4 million worth of planning and
construction have transformed Wilbur Hall, former
ly the drab ghetto of undergraduate housing, into a
developer's wildest pastel dream.
"I think it's a miracle," said Director of Student
Housing Services Rodger Whitney, who has been
closely involved with the Wilbur project since its be
ginning. "Some of the students see it and their
mouths just drop wide open — they can't believe it's
Wilbur."
Gone are the days of dark corridors, crumbling
wood, and cruel jokes about Stanford's largest dor
mitory. In their place are cheerily painted walls, win
dows sunnier than those in greenhouses, and what
Whitney describes as an "overwhelmingly positive"
response.
Even a fire this summer that destroyed a shed
next to Otero and damaged the resident fellow's cot
tage did not hinder the grand plans for Wilbur.
But the new shinier, happier Wilbur still has its
share of problems. New residents have complained
of keys and locks that don't work, bathrooms with no
signs indicating gender jurisdiction, and showers
with no curtains and only two water temperatures
