# Casper faces packed fall-quarter agenda
## Six major policy proposals on the table 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Displaying the ambition expected of a
seasoned sophomore, University President
Gerhard Casper has packed his autumn
agenda with a dizzying array of policy ini
tiatives.
After a well-reviewed if relatively un
eventful first year in office, the President
rushes headlong into his second fall at
Stanford with six major proposals covering
a wide spectrum of University issues on his
calendar.
That's not to mention the pet projects
Casper is wont to authorize, such as a sym
posium announced last week titled "Cul
ture and Cultures in the 21st Century," a
series of discussions on multiculturalism
he will sponsor.
And looming over all this, of course, is
the review of the Commission on Under
graduate Education, which the president
has promised to supplement with requisite
visits to dorms and speeches to parents and
alumni.
Casper is well aware of the heavy traffic
ahead. "It will be a busy fall, winter and
spring," Casper said, when asked merely if
this would be a busy fall.
This Thursday, Casper presents the
Faculty Senate with a revised draft of the
policy on unacceptable sexual conduct. The
senate had advised Casper to revise an ini
tial draft submitted for consideration last
April.
Casper and an eight-person work group

spent the summer following the recom
mendations and criticisms voiced, the most
influential being those of Asst. Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl. She told the sen
ate that the "current draft is not ade
quate," in particular its insufficient in
structions on grievance procedure and a
weak confidentiality clause.
Casper said the policy was "re-drafted
extensively" this summer. He will submit
the new draft for senate consider
ation, although this particular
policy is "not for them to formally
pass." The president, ultimately,
has jurisdiction over when and in
what form the policy will be
enacted.
That said, it is likely that
Casper will immediately promul
gate the policy if it receives senate
endorsement this time around.
Further delays would be a setback
for the president, who has repeat
edly insisted that the University
cannot continue without an offi
cial stance on sexual harassment.
Shortly after considering the

sexual harassment policy — prob
ably by mid-October — the senate
will turn its attentions to the
Casper-sponsored policy which
spells out potential conflicts of
interest for University faculty.
The policy may curtail some
research activity and revenue
that, under the proposed guide
lines, would be considered to be
threats to the University's
integrity. "This is an explosive
issue," Casper said. "All the ques
tions are politically very contro
versial."
Biology Prof. Craig Heller,
head of the committee drafting
the policy, said the proposal
underwent "massive changes"
this summer, primarily in the
organization and wording of its
regulations. "It's going to be pret

ty straightforward," he said.
However, though the senate
gave the draft policy preliminary
approval in May, Heller will make
no predictions on how the Senate
will react to the final policy.
"Nothing is ever smooth," he
said. "I don't want to lull myself
into a sense of complacency.
Nobody likes more rules and reg
ulations imposed on them."
While these two debates
promise to set the tone for the
senate's activities this year,
Casper himself will continue the
arduous process of revamping the
academic structure of the Univer
sity's schools.
Most notable of these is the
proposed restructuring of the
Medical Center, the blueprint for
which was released in June.

Casper, who chairs the task force
on the restructuring, said he will
be "very busy with discussions"
concerning the Medical Center,
which aims to eliminate adminis
trative boundaries between its in
patient and out-patient services.
The reorganization effort
could become increasingly perti
nent as a national health-care pol
icy emphasizing managed compe
tition emerges. The consolidation
of Medical Center functions, offi
cials said, would be attractive in a
system where providers will be
competing to offer the maximum
amount of services with the great
est efficiency.
"It's a radical proposal,"
Casper said. He addtxl that he
hopes to have a report prepared
sometime next quarter, and that

recommendations "move very
speedily to the Board of
Trustees."
Other schools may come under
organizational scrutiny, too. Last
year, Casper announced reforms
to the School of Humanities and
Sciences that compartmentalized
similar disciplines into three
major areas — natural sciences,
social sciences, and humanities —
each with its own dean, thus giv
ing individual departments
greater control over administra
tive decisions.
He promises more aggressive
efforts beginning this fall. "Busi
ness as usual is not business as
usual," he said.
Casper concedes that with the
excitement of initiating new pro
jects comes the inheritance of old

problems. "I hope that we can
make some progress on settling
our (indirect cost) differences
with the government," he said.
"That's a hope."
And as he learned in his first
year, the presidency also entails
public relations demands; this
fall, Casper will make his first trip
to Tokyo, Kyoto, Taipei and Hong
Kong, and will address a mam
moth alumni gathering, to be held
on campus Sept. 30 - Oct. 3.
The uncertainty — and possi
bility for setback — that accompa
nies such an ambitious agenda is
perhaps best symbolized by the
goal that lies at the end of
Casper's fall to-do list. "On Nov.
20, we will beat Cal in the Big
Game," he said with a wary smile.
"Right?"

system where providers will be
competing to offer the maximum
amount of services with the great
est efficiency.
"It's a radical proposal,"
Casper said. He addtxl that he
hopes to have a report prepared
sometime next quarter, and that

recommendations "move very
speedily to the Board of
Trustees."
Other schools may come under
organizational scrutiny, too. Last
year, Casper announced reforms
to the School of Humanities and
Sciences that compartmentalized
similar disciplines into three
major areas — natural sciences,
social sciences, and humanities —
each with its own dean, thus giv
ing individual departments
greater control over administra
tive decisions.
He promises more aggressive
efforts beginning this fall. "Busi
ness as usual is not business as
usual," he said.
Casper concedes that with the
excitement of initiating new pro
jects comes the inheritance of old

problems. "I hope that we can
make some progress on settling
our (indirect cost) differences
with the government," he said.
"That's a hope."
And as he learned in his first
year, the presidency also entails
public relations demands; this
fall, Casper will make his first trip
to Tokyo, Kyoto, Taipei and Hong
Kong, and will address a mam
moth alumni gathering, to be held
on campus Sept. 30 - Oct. 3.
The uncertainty — and possi
bility for setback — that accompa
nies such an ambitious agenda is
perhaps best symbolized by the
goal that lies at the end of
Casper's fall to-do list. "On Nov.
20, we will beat Cal in the Big
Game," he said with a wary smile.
"Right?"
Displaying the ambition expected of a
seasoned sophomore, University President
Gerhard Casper has packed his autumn
agenda with a dizzying array of policy ini
tiatives.
After a well-reviewed if relatively un
eventful first year in office, the President
rushes headlong into his second fall at
Stanford with six major proposals covering
a wide spectrum of University issues on his
calendar.
That's not to mention the pet projects
Casper is wont to authorize, such as a sym
posium announced last week titled "Cul
ture and Cultures in the 21st Century," a
series of discussions on multiculturalism
he will sponsor.
And looming over all this, of course, is
the review of the Commission on Under
graduate Education, which the president
has promised to supplement with requisite
visits to dorms and speeches to parents and
alumni.
Casper is well aware of the heavy traffic
ahead. "It will be a busy fall, winter and
spring," Casper said, when asked merely if
this would be a busy fall.
This Thursday, Casper presents the
Faculty Senate with a revised draft of the
policy on unacceptable sexual conduct. The
senate had advised Casper to revise an ini
tial draft submitted for consideration last
April.
Casper and an eight-person work group

spent the summer following the recom
mendations and criticisms voiced, the most
influential being those of Asst. Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl. She told the sen
ate that the "current draft is not ade
quate," in particular its insufficient in
structions on grievance procedure and a
weak confidentiality clause.
Casper said the policy was "re-drafted
extensively" this summer. He will submit
the new draft for senate consider
ation, although this particular
policy is "not for them to formally
pass." The president, ultimately,
has jurisdiction over when and in
what form the policy will be
enacted.
That said, it is likely that
Casper will immediately promul
gate the policy if it receives senate
endorsement this time around.
Further delays would be a setback
for the president, who has repeat
edly insisted that the University
cannot continue without an offi
cial stance on sexual harassment.
Shortly after considering the

sexual harassment policy — prob
ably by mid-October — the senate
will turn its attentions to the
Casper-sponsored policy which
spells out potential conflicts of
interest for University faculty.
The policy may curtail some
research activity and revenue
that, under the proposed guide
lines, would be considered to be
threats to the University's
integrity. "This is an explosive
issue," Casper said. "All the ques
tions are politically very contro
versial."
Biology Prof. Craig Heller,
head of the committee drafting
the policy, said the proposal
underwent "massive changes"
this summer, primarily in the
organization and wording of its
regulations. "It's going to be pret

ty straightforward," he said.
However, though the senate
gave the draft policy preliminary
approval in May, Heller will make
no predictions on how the Senate
will react to the final policy.
"Nothing is ever smooth," he
said. "I don't want to lull myself
into a sense of complacency.
Nobody likes more rules and reg
ulations imposed on them."
While these two debates
promise to set the tone for the
senate's activities this year,
Casper himself will continue the
arduous process of revamping the
academic structure of the Univer
sity's schools.
Most notable of these is the
proposed restructuring of the
Medical Center, the blueprint for
which was released in June.

Casper, who chairs the task force
on the restructuring, said he will
be "very busy with discussions"
concerning the Medical Center,
which aims to eliminate adminis
trative boundaries between its in
patient and out-patient services.
The reorganization effort
could become increasingly perti
nent as a national health-care pol
icy emphasizing managed compe
tition emerges. The consolidation
of Medical Center functions, offi
cials said, would be attractive in a
system where providers will be
competing to offer the maximum
amount of services with the great
est efficiency.
"It's a radical proposal,"
Casper said. He addtxl that he
hopes to have a report prepared
sometime next quarter, and that

recommendations "move very
