# Education group's meetings delayed

### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The much-publicized Commission
on Undergraduate Education will not
convene until mid-October, primarily
because two student seats have not yet
been filled, administration officials
said.
The delay pushes the 18-member
commission's targeted completion date
back by about four months. A final re
port is now scheduled to be issued in
October 1994.
Any hopes of staffing the com
mission before summer were
dashed by the administration's
decision late last spring to delay
the ASSU's appointment of stu
dent members. ASSU Senate
Chair Greg Waldorf said the
Office of Student Activities had
not yet settled on "the exact num
ber of qualifications" it wanted
prospective students to have.
The ASSU Committee on
Committees, which is responsible
for placing students on the com
mission, is still waiting to receive
the selection criteria from the
Office of Student Activities, Wal
dorf said. The ASSU committee
will not meet until after tomor
row's's senate meeting, he said.
Students nominated by the
ASSU must be approved by Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper.
Casper created the commis
sion last April and authorized it
to conduct a sweeping, year-long
review of undergraduate educa
tion. He said in his announce
ment that he expected the com
mission to meet in the summer
and have a final report ready by
the end of the 1993-94 academic
year. With the commission's
delay, Casper pushed back the
deadline for the final report to
Oct. 1, 1994.
In his charge to the commis
sion, the president instructed the
panel to "clarify the goals of a

Stanford undergraduate educa
tion and to recommend ways to
insure that our programs are
appropriate and effective in sup
port of those goals."

Sheehan hopes to
have the commission
in place for an Oct.
16 retreat to plan its
study strategy.

Among the specific issues
Casper charged the commission
to examine are the structure of
the curriculum, the length of the
bachelor's degree, the "special
educational requirements" of
engineering and science students,
teaching methods, and "ancillary
services," such as advising and
Residential Education.
Casper will officially release
the statement of the commis
sion's charge at Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Seated on the commission so
far are two alumni, Vice Provost
for Institutional Planning Geof
frey Cox, and these faculty mem
bers: Sheehan, Political Science

ence and Engineering Prof. John
Bravman, Economics Prof. Don

Sciences A 1 Camarillo, Art Prof.

Italian Prof. Nelee Langmuir,

guistics Prof. John Rickford,
Education Prof. Guadalupe
Valdes and Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg.
Commission chair James
Sheehan said he is "eager to have
[the students] named as soon as
possible." Sheehan hopes to have
the commission in place in time
for a scheduled Oct. 16 retreat to
plan its study strategy.
When the commission does
convene, Sheehan said it will
begin with an examination of the
abstract goals of undergraduate
education at Stanford, and then
move to concrete issues.
"The president's mandate is
very broad," Sheehan said. "Our
first task will be to convert it into
some manageable set of particu
lar issues." From there, the com
mission will form working groups
to study each issue and solicit
advice from the community,
Sheehan said, stressing that he
wants to keep the commission's
work "open in every sense." He
added that he hopes the full panel
will meet weekly.
The current timetable for the
study calls for a draft report to be
completed by this spring, with
"final editing over the summer,
and a final report for considera
tion before the Stanford commu
nity as the fall quarter opens,"
Casper said.
Sheehan, too, is aiming for a
fall 1994 finish. "It's very hard to
keep an organization going
beyond a year," he said.
