# Health reform's forgotten father
## Enthoven reacts to Clinton's plan

Prof. Alain Enthoven wasn't
part of Hillary Clinton's task
force on health care reform, but
the national health care plan
unveiled Thursday couldn't
have been written without him.
Enthoven is the mastermind
behind "managed competition,"
a system that strives to make
health care more efficient by
making health care more sus
ceptible to free market competi
tion.
The idea has been widely dis
cussed. All three front-runners
in the 1992 presidential elec
tion, for example, met with En
thoven to discuss managed com
petition before the vote.
Yet, strangely, Enthoven
wasn't asked to be one of the
members of the task force that
drafted the new national plan,
so he had to wait seven months

to see how much the proposal
borrowed from managed com
petition.
But Enthoven's wait is over,
and the professor can take some
satisfaction that the plan an
nounced Thursday by President
Clinton clearly stemmed from
managed competition.
"They've picked up on a lot of
my ideas," Enthoven said.
At the same time, Enthoven
said he worries about the places
where Clinton's plan departs
from managed competition, be
cause such departures may hin
der the effort to give every
American efficient, total health
care coverage.
Now the man The New York
Times called the "abandoned fa
ther of health care reform" is
ready to work to move Clinton's
plan back toward his own ideal.
