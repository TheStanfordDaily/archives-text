# Health reform's forgotten father
## Enthoven reacts to Clinton's plan

Prof. Alain Enthoven wasn't
part of Hillary Clinton's task
force on health care reform, but
the national health care plan
unveiled Thursday couldn't
have been written without him.
Enthoven is the mastermind
behind "managed competition,"
a system that strives to make
health care more efficient by
making health care more sus
ceptible to free market competi
tion.
The idea has been widely dis
cussed. All three front-runners
in the 1992 presidential elec
tion, for example, met with En
thoven to discuss managed com
petition before the vote.
Yet, strangely, Enthoven
wasn't asked to be one of the
members of the task force that
drafted the new national plan,
so he had to wait seven months

to see how much the proposal
borrowed from managed com
petition.
But Enthoven's wait is over,
and the professor can take some
satisfaction that the plan an
nounced Thursday by President
Clinton clearly stemmed from
managed competition.
"They've picked up on a lot of
my ideas," Enthoven said.
At the same time, Enthoven
said he worries about the places
where Clinton's plan departs
from managed competition, be
cause such departures may hin
der the effort to give every
American efficient, total health
care coverage.
Now the man The New York
Times called the "abandoned fa
ther of health care reform" is
ready to work to move Clinton's
plan back toward his own ideal.
Enthoven first presented
managed competition two years
ago in Jackson Hole, Wyo. That is
where he had been meeting with
corporate CEOs, health care execu
tives and others to try to hammer
out a new way to give every Amer
ican more efficient health care.
The idea that differentiated
managed competition from
Enthoven's previous work on
health care was called Health Plan
Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs).
The cooperatives are administrative
groups that would enlist small busi
nesses, with up to 100 employees,
and broker health care coverage for
them. This would drive down
health care costs because health
insurers wouldn't have to spend the
large amounts of time and effort for
the low return they get from selling
insurance to very small businesses.
The businesses, meanwhile, would
also be saving time and effort by
having someone else come up with
options of different-priced health
plans to choose from.
The government would help
coordinate the system. Everyone in
the countiy would enroll and get
all necessary health coverage. Ben
efit packages would have to be
standard, and records would be
kept listing the quality of different
health plans so consumers could
compare plans.
It would cheaper and easier, in
other words, to go to one location
and compare the price and quality
of different makes of the same gen
eral product. Buying health care
would become more like going to
the mall to buy a shirt.
The issue of concern in health
reform, Enthoven said, is
"whether we do this in a system
that relies on market forces and is
driven by informed consumers.
"The competitive market, when
properly configured, is by far the
best guarantee of bringing down
costs and prices."
In other words, managed com
petition would theoretically allow
every American the chance to com
parison shop for health care, which
would force the health care givers
to compete and offer the best possi

ble service for the lowest possible
price.
"Why didn't Honda charge
$150,000 for a new car?" Enthoven
asked. "In a true market economy,
the guarantee that prices won't
soar is competition and incen
tives."
The Clinton plan has adopted
many of Enthoven's ideas — such
as HPPCs, offering standard bene
fit packages and having health care
providers compete. However, the
federal proposal has made some
changes from Enthoven's plan,
and these changes have Enthoven
concerned.
Indeed, while Enthoven said
health care reform is desperately
needed, he said he is not sure Clin
ton's draft plan is a step forward.
"I think that's uncertain,"
Enthoven said. "We certainly have
to do something, and it has to be
something comprehensive and
bold, as Clinton proposes. . . . But I
do have some real concerns."
Enthoven has articulated four
main concerns with the Clinton
plan. One concern is that regional
health alliances — the Clinton
plan's version of HPPCs — are too
large. In the Clinton plan, compa
nies with fewer than 5,000 employ
ees — not 100 employees, as
Enthoven suggested — would have
to join alliances. States could tax
large companies who chose to run
their own plans instead of joining
regional alliances.
Regional alliances, Enthoven
fears, will become too large and
bureaucratic, especially because
even big businesses may be per
suaded to join to avoid taxes on
corporate alliances.
The alliances, Enthoven fears,
would be like a state-by-state "sin
gle payer" system, where one gov
ernmental agency funds and man
ages all health care, similar to
Canada's system. This "will
inevitably lead to allocation of
resources based on political consid
erations rather than economic
merit," Enthoven wrote in a state
ment on the plan.
Furthermore, Enthoven said,
"government is not capable of
being a selective, cost-conscious
purchaser."
What Clinton must do,

Enthoven said, is make it clear
that alliances "are market makers,
not regulatory agencies."
A second big problem Enthoven
sees with the proposed reform is
that it does not have a "tax cap" —
people offered a choice of different
priced health plans can pay more
for a more expensive plan and
deduct the extra money from their
taxes. The problem with this,
Enthoven says, is that it insulates
employees from the costs of their
health care decisions.
This, Enthoven wrote, "cuts in
half the marketplace reward" for
being cost-effective, because con
sumers only feel half the added cost.
His proposed cure for this problem
would be to end the tax deduction
on the extra money paid for health
plans that cost more than the
cheapest approved plan "to sharpen
up incentives" to be frugal.
The third problem Enthoven
sees with the Clinton plan is the
guarantee that no employer will
have to pay more than 7.9 percent
of their payroll on health care. If
an employer's required contribu
tion exceeded 7.9 percent of pay
roll, the government would pick up
the rest of the tab.
The problem, Enthoven says, is
that health care costs have been
rising faster than wages, and if this
trend continues, more and more
businesses would likely hit the 7.9
percent cap. This would create a
huge strain on the federal budget.
In addition, it amounts to placing a
7.9 percent tax on company pay
rolls, which will be a disincentive to
hire people.
The final concern Enthoven has
with the Clinton plan is that it sets
an absolute ceiling for the growth
of health care costs — by 1996,
costs will be allowed to rise no
faster than the Consumer Price
Index plus 1.5 percent; by 1999,
cost increases cannot exceed the
CPI. Clinton says this measure is a
"backstop," put in place so that the
nation can be sure to control sky
rocketing costs. Enthoven, howev
er, is concerned that the timetable
for slowing the cost growth is unre
alistic. More importantly, he says,
price controls simply don't work.
"I think it's a mirage,"
Enthoven said of price controls.

The timetable of Clinton's plan
also "strikes me as being very
ambitious," Enthoven said, partic
ularly the idea that health care cost
increases can be cut to CPI plus 1.5
percent in just over two years.
But, Enthoven said, "this is an
urgent problem, and it requires
strong, forceful action."
Enthoven said he feels the flaws
in Clinton's plan "can definitely be
fixed" by a move back toward pure
managed competition.
But this move may not be easy,
and the professor said he realizes
this. Politicians, he knows, must
deal with the possible and the art
of compromise, and Enthoven said
he does not want to imply that
compromise can't happen.
Personally, however, Enthoven
will work for his ideas. "I sort of
see my role as to be hammering
away on this," he said.
Enthoven has been hammering
away at health care reform for
decades. Born Sept. 10, 1930,
Enthoven graduated from Stan
ford in 1952 with a bachelor's in
economics, and earned his doctor
ate in economics from MIT four
years later.
His work with the government

began in the 19605, in the Depart
ment of Defense where he worked
to make the department's decision
making process more efficient. In
1965, Enthoven became an assis
tant secretary of Defense.
He then focused his eye for effi
ciency on health care. Enthoven
has worked with a hospital in
Santa Monica, the National Acade
my of Sciences' Institute of
Medicine. He advised President
Carter on health care and helped
set up health-care systems for
Georgetown University and the
state of California. He is currently
a consultant with the giant health
maintenance organization Kaiser-
Permanente.
Enthoven also redesigned Stan
ford's health benefit plan in 1989,
when the University spent about
$17 million on employee health
plans and was facing potential pay
ments of more than $20 million in
1990. At that time, Stanford
employees were offered several
health plans of different cost, but
the University would pay for all
the plans, so there was little incen
tive for employees to choose a
cheap plan.
Enthoven, who chaired the Uni

versity Committee on Faculty and
Staff Benefits, worried that there
was no incentive under the Univer
sity plan for employees to choose
low-cost health care. So, the com
mittee recommended that Stan
ford pay the cost of the least expen
sive health plan, and employees
who wanted a more expensive plan
could pay the remainder. In addi
tion, the committee said employees
should pay $10 for every trip to the
doctor's office to sensitize them to
the costs.
Some of the ideas from Stan
ford's plan have made it into Clin
ton's plan — paying $10 per doc
tor's visit, for example.
The initial reaction to Stan
ford's new plan — which may mir
ror some reaction to the new
national plan — was largely nega
tive. Enthoven said he even
received personal letters from
angry employees.
"Going to managed competition
here at Stanford meant that previ
ously, Stanford paid . . . essentially
the full price, so employees saw it
as a take-away," Enthoven said.
Some Americans who are cur
rently among the best-insured may
feel the same under Clinton's plan.
Others will also get their toes
stepped on, Enthoven said.
"An awful lot of interests are
going to see their ox get gored by
this," he said. "A whole lot of bro
kers and agents see this as destroy
ing their business. That's true."
But Enthoven said this is not
necessarily bad. These businesses
are going to be destroyed because
they are inefficient, and will be
replaced ideally with a much better
way to provide health care.
And after all the planning and
politics, a much better way to pro
vide health care is what Enthoven
wants and thinks he has created.
Now, the challenge for
Enthoven will be lobbying Wash
ington's clique of health care
reformers, trying to convince them
that more of his ideas should see
the final plan.
"A string of first downs is not
enough. I want to see a touch
down on this," Enthoven said.
"I'm focused on trying to see this
thing through, done in the best
possible way."
