Hoover Director

few options be
fore him at the
end of his term
as chairman, the
University work
ed hard to come

up with a package that would
entice the well-known econo
mist back to Stanford, Raisian
said.
The offer of a joint position at
the Hoover Institution and a
newly endowed chair in the Eco


Boskin
nomics Department did the trick.
"He finally came to his senses,"
Raisian said jokingly.
