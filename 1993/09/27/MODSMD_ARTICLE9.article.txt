## Russians show support for Yeltsin at rally Hard-liners in parliament want simultaneous elections in March 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of Russians cheered
Boris Yeltsin at a concert on Red Square yesterday,
and at least 10,000 people marched in the biggest
demonstration of support for the president since he
disbanded parliament five days ago.
Across town, the hard-liners who have sought to
impeach Yeltsin and name their own government dug
in their heels.
"If need be, we will stay here for a year," said par
liament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, leader of the
approximately 100 lawmakers who remain holed up
in the building, known as the White House.
Late yesterday, in a potentially significant devel
opment, a top aide was quoted as saying that he
believed Yeltsin would agree to simultaneous elec
tions for parliament and president. But Deputy
Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai stressed he was
expressing his personal opinion, an official said.
Shakrai's comments came at a meeting of region
al leaders on the crisis, in which they urged both
sides to cancel the decrees they have issued during

the crisis and hold simultaneous elections immedi
ately.
Yeltsin has set new parliamentary elections for
December and said presidential elections could be
held in June. Khasbulatov's parliament, elected in
Soviet times, wants simultaneous elections in
March.
Yeltsin dissolved parliament last Tuesday after
struggling for 18 months with hard-line lawmakers
opposed to his reforms. Lawmakers responded by
impeaching Yeltsin and naming Vice President
Alexander Rutskoi as acting president.
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, speaking Sun
day on NBC's "Meet the Press," said that if there is a
"growing mood" in the country, Yeltsin might com
promise on his plan.
But Kozyrev said he believes simultaneous elec
tions are "very, very dangerous," and could destabi
lize the country. "Someone has to be in office," he
said.
Yeltsin, accompanied by Defense Minister Pavel

Grachev and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, waded
into surging crowds on Red Square for a free concert
by the Washington-based National Symphony
Orchestra and its conductor, former dissident
Mstislav Rostropovich.
Later, pro-Yeltsin demonstrators chanting
"Yeltsin! Yeltsin!" linked arms and marched down
broad Tverskaya Street — Gorky Street in Soviet
times. A small band headed the procession.
Outside the White House, Yeltsin's rebellious vice
president, Alexander Rutskoi, urged 3,000 to 4,000
anti-Yeltsin demonstrators "to stand 'til the end."
Rutskoi has condemned Yeltsin's actions as unconsti
tutional and declared himself president.
The anti-Yeltsin demonstrators are a mix of Com
munists and extreme nationalists, and are mostly
older than Yeltsin's supporters.
At a ne\ys conference, Khasbulatov said he would
not deal with Yeltsin, and said elections could be held
only if the "former president leaves his Kremlin
office."
