## 200 frosh to have orientation again 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Orientation may be over, but
some freshmen are already mak
ing plans for a 'second orienta
tion" during the weekend of Oct.
8-10.
Two hundred lucky freshmen
will take part in the new off-cam
pus orientation trips organized
by the Recreational Educational
& Developmental Workshops
Out Doors program. RED
WOOD, a pilot program this year,
was created by the ASSU through
a $74,000 grant in January.
Nine different trips, ranging
from backpacking and camping
to community-service outreach
es, are designed to help freshmen
in their orientation process while
exposing them to social and envi
ronmental issues.
"The main goal is to provide a
place for people to meet and be
come friends with a small com
munity before being thrust into
Stanford," said Wally Mann, a
staff member in the Electrical
Engineering Department and
one of the program's founders.
The price for each of the stu
dents who participate in the pro
gram is $100, though some finan
cial aid is available.
The enrollment is limited,
with participants selected at ran
dom from the received applica
tions. Incoming freshmen were
informed of the program through
the mail during the summer.
But freshmen are not the only
participants in the REDWOOD
trips — upperclassmen who are
trained throughout the year
direct the trips in the fall. "We
already have 35 outdoor leaders,"
said Mann, who is optimistic the
program will be expanded next
year. "We hope to have twice that
number by the end of the year."
There are no prerequisites for
joining the program as an outdoor
leader, he said. REDWOOD
intends to recruit students at the
activities fair today and through
out the year.
In addition to organizing pro
grams for freshmen, the RED
WOOD project is also designed to

provide funding and supplies for
students who wish to pursue out
door trips on their own.
Quarterly outings, similar to
those offered to freshmen, will
also be sponsored by the program,
Mann said.
A larger expedition course —
including two quarters of training
and a month-long summer trip —
will also be offered this year.
Academic credit is not yet
available for any of the RED
WOOD trips, but Mann said that
the University may soon grant
credit for the summer expedition
course.
The program's coordinators
include Mann and students
Katherine Chen, Jackie Daley and
Nathan Gove, all of whom have
been involved in various aspects
of REDWOOD'S activities.
"We've all worked hard to
make this project come together,"
said Mann. "Our hope is that it
will meet the needs of the incom
ing freshmen and the community
as a whole."
