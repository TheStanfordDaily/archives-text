### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Orientation may be over, but
some freshmen are already mak
ing plans for a 'second orienta
tion" during the weekend of Oct.
8-10.
Two hundred lucky freshmen
will take part in the new off-cam
pus orientation trips organized
by the Recreational Educational
& Developmental Workshops
Out Doors program. RED
WOOD, a pilot program this year,
was created by the ASSU through
a $74,000 grant in January.
Nine different trips, ranging
from backpacking and camping
to community-service outreach
es, are designed to help freshmen
in their orientation process while
exposing them to social and envi
ronmental issues.
"The main goal is to provide a
place for people to meet and be
come friends with a small com
munity before being thrust into
Stanford," said Wally Mann, a
staff member in the Electrical
Engineering Department and
one of the program's founders.
The price for each of the stu
dents who participate in the pro
gram is $100, though some finan
cial aid is available.
The enrollment is limited,
