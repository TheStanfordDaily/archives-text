# Stanford sixth in U.S. News rankings
## 
### Kevin Wack 
A U.S. News and World
Report survey published yester
day ranked Stanford sixth among
the nation's top universities.
Stanford, which dropped from
fourth last year, has fallen in the
poll for the last three years.
Harvard was chosen as the
top-ranked national university
for the fourth time in as many
years. Princeton finished second
and was followed by Yale, MIT
and Cal Tech.
The annual rankings are
determined by combining the
school's academic reputation, as
judged by administrators at
comparable institutions, and a
number of statistical barome
ters. Among the data provided
by the universities were indices
on student selectivity, faculty
resources, financial resources
and graduationTate.
Although Stanford's reputa
tion remains as good as any
school's, its statistical rankings
have slipped, causing the lower
overall ranking.

Probably the statistic that
hurt Stanford most was alumni
satisfaction, where the school
finished just 77th out of the 204
national universities surveyed,
said Robert Morse, who conduct
ed the survey for U.S. News and
World Report.
University administrators
were quick to downplay the sig
nificance of Stanford's slow
decline in the rankings.
Vivian Barry, associate dean
for administration in the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions,
said she does not expect the
rankings to hurt Stanford's
application pool.
"This is in the general area
that we have been ranked in pre
vious years," she said. "People
have a gradually acquired sense
of Stanford being one of the best
colleges in the nation."
Barry added that, to some
prospective applicants, "the
number one [ranking] is appeal
ing. We don't see it as a
factor unless you're number
one."
Jason Snyder, a member of

the Council of Presidents, ques
tioned the ability of the U.S.
News survey to capture some of
Stanford's intangible advan
tages over other schools.
"No one told U.S. News and
World Report when we turned
our fountains back on," he joked.

However, some students
feared that a consistent drop
could have a negative effect on
Stanford. Freshman Aashish
Didwania noted that some of his
high school friends had applied
to only the top-ranked schools in
certain specialized fields.
