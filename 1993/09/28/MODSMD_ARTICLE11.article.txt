# First time on the Row: Frosh join Muwekma

### Johnathon Briggs Staff writer 
For the first time in Muwekma-Tah-Ruk's his
tory, freshmen are living in the Native-American
theme house.
According to Andrew Lisac, Muwekma's resi
dent fellow, it's not only a first for the dorm, but
for the Row as well.
"The main reason we decided to have frosh this
year was because we were the last theme house
not to have frosh," Lisac said.
Lisac said the second reason was a community
based decision.
A large number of Native-American upper

class students stay in the dorm and, historically,
frosh could not. "[This caused] a separation
between the older students and the younger
ones," he said.
Lisac said the freshmen, who have an academ
ic adviser and a resident assistant won't miss out
on traditional first-year activities. "When (Flo
rence Moore Hall) has a career day or some activ
ity, we'll participate," Lisac said.
Freshmen were not placed in Muwekma due to
any housing shortage, Lisac said.
However, he added that there is a possibility
Muwekma may move to a bigger house on the
Row because there is more demand than space for
students wanting to live there.
