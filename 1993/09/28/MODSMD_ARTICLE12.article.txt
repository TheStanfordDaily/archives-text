# For the record

The Daily incorrectly reported
in the Orientation issue that the
Bookstore will soon "begin search
ing for a new chairman. The
search will be for a new general
manager. In addition, Robert
Weisberg's title is interim presi
dent of the Bookstore Board, not
acting director.
An article titled "Where to get
medical care at Stanford" in the
Orientation issue's Campus Life
section misstated the waiting
period for patients at Cowell Stu

dent Health Center.
For those without appoint
ments, the wait is generally no
longer than 30 minutes, not as
long as an hour, as reported. For
problems that are not urgent,
Cowell recommends that stu
dents make appointments so they
will not have to wait when they
come in.
Furthermore, the women's
volleyball match against San Jose
State will be played tonight at
Maples Pavilion, not on Thurs
day, as was originally reported.
