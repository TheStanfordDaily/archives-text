## Clinton tells U.N. to scale back peacekeeping missions 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Clinton
toid the United Nations yesterday the American
people will support sending U.S. troops to keep
peace around the world only if new missions are
sharply limited. "The United Nations must know
when to say 'no,' " he declared.
Noting that he is the first president born after
creation of the organization, Clinton insisted on new
rules for "new times" as he outlined his foreign pol
icy views with a mixture of caution and high pur
pose.
Clinton is prepared to send as many as 25,000
American troops to Bosnia if peace terms can be
worked out, and he defended keeping 4,700 U.S.
peacekeepers in Somalia. But he told the represen
tatives of more than 180 nations that the U.N. must
limit its involvement in international fighting,
beginning "by bringing the rigors of military and

political analysis to every U.N. peace mission."
He also proposed a network of nuclear arms
restraints, including a worldwide ban on stockpiling
of weapons-grade uranium. And yet he hinted he
might abandon his three-month old ban on under
ground weapons blasts if China resumed its testing
program.
At a news conference later with Japanese Prime
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Clinton said the Unit
ed States sent peacekeepers to Somalia in December
"with our eyes open" but "may have underestimat
ed" the difficulty of restoring political stability. "I
still believe President Bush made the right deci
sion," he said
He also listed conditions for deploying American
forces to a NATO peacekeeping unit in Bosnia.
"I would want a clear understanding of what the
command and control was and I would want the

NATO commander in charge of the operations,"
Clinton said. "I would want a clear timetable for
first review and ultimately for the right to terminate
American involvement."
Clinton said there would have to be "a clear polit
ical strategy" for the peacekeeping mission, and the
deployment would have to be endorsed by Congress.
Elaborating on his speech, Clinton said none of
the current peacekeeping missions was "ill founded"
but that "there are limits to what we can do" in the
future. "I want to see us go into these things with
our eyes open," he said.
Clinton, in proposing curbs on mushrooming
international peacekeeping ventures — there are
now 17 involving 80,000 troops — appeared to be
looking for a practical way out of a growing dispute
with members of Congress who are questioning
American intervention in foreign conflicts.

"The United Nations simply cannot become
engaged in every one of the world's conflicts," Clin
ton said.
Still, he said, the U.N. must have "the technical
means to run a modern world-class peacekeeping
operation." And he pledged that the United States
intended to "remain engaged and to lead" in post-
Cold War world affairs.
He offered to pay within the next few weeks a
$400 million U.S. debt for peacekeeping, but he also
said the United States was paying too heavy a load.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the idea was to scale back from 30.4
percent to 25 percent and have Germany and Japan,
among others, make up the difference.
Clinton said the United Nations must "weed out
waste" and he suggested the appointment of an
inspector general to investigate any abuses.
