AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Just 16
weeks after her election to the U.S. Sen
ate, Kay Bailey Hutchison was indicted
yesterday on charges of misconduct dur
ing her 2 1/2-year tenure as state trea

She denied any wrongdoing and called

the treasury.

N. Korea may have nukes
VIENNA, Austria (AP) â€” North
Korea refused yesterday to resume talks
on the monitoring of its nuclear facili
ties.
The country called off the talks as the
International Atomic Energy Agency,
the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, opened its
annual general conference in Vienna.
North Korea denies building nuclear
arms, but suspicions were raised in
March when it stopped allowing full
inspections of its nuclear facilities. The
communist country has since announced
it intends to withdraw from the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.
Japan and the United States confirmed
earlier this year that North Korea has
tested a missile capable of reaching Japan.
