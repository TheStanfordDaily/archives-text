## Shevardnadze forced to flee government's last stronghold 
### 
TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Abk
hazian separatists captured Sukhumi
yesterday after 12 days of bitter com
bat, forcing Georgian leader Eduard
Shevardnadze to flee the devastated
city he had vowed to defend.
Abkhazian forces fought their way
to the center of the city and raised their
flag over City Hall, Shevardnadze said
in a message to his office in Tbilisi, the
Georgian capital.
The fall of Sukhumi, the Georgian
government's last stronghold -in the
coastal province of Abkhazia, gave the
separatists virtually complete control
of the region.
More than 3,000 people have been
killed and 100,000 made homeless in
the yearlong war, one of the fiercest
ethnic conflicts to rise from the ruins of
the Soviet Union.
The Georgian government fears an

Abkhazian victory could inspire other
ethnic groups to revolt and could lead to
civil war across the Caucusus Mountain
region.
The message from Shevardnadze,
who had personally led the defense of
Sukhumi, blamed Russia for the defeat.
"Georgia lost an unequal battle,"
Shevardnadze was quoting as saying.
"We could have saved Sukhumi yester
day, but only Russia could do this and
we sent an appeal to Moscow for such
help."
Shevardnadze's office said he had
left Sukhumi and was somewhere in
the Gulprish region, a few miles south
of Sukhumi, but declined to say exactly
where.
Shevardnadze's aides in Tbilisi said
he might have to accept a Russian offer
for evacuation, but would try to avoid
that humiliating step.

Although Russia has officially main
tained neutrality in the conflict, Geor
gia's government has accused the Rus
sian military of supplying arms and
other aid to Abkhazia.
Russia has both ships and aircraft in
the region and evacuated 10,000 civil
ian refugees yesterday. The ITAR-Tass
news agency said. Shevardnadze's per
sonal airplane, a Soviet-built Yak-40,
was still at Sukhumi Airport, which the
separatists have been shelling for days.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin
ordered his Defense Ministry to give
"maximum" assistance to get Shevard
nadze safely out of-the region, officials
in Moscow said.
Georgia's parliament, which gave
Shevardnadze special powers and dis
banded itself two weeks ago, went back
into an emergency session yesterday
night.
