## Editorial Wanted: experience Undergrad commission must actively seek out students' involvement. 
### 
STANFORD'S COMMISSION
on Undergraduate Education
is not a commission — not
yet. At least, not until two students
are selected to complete its mem
bership.
Hopefully, postponing business
until students can participate
reflects the commission's respect
for student opinion. Remember, it
is the students' academic careers,
and therefore their futures, which
the commission has been designed
to evaluate.
Students' opinions will be valu
able for two reasons. First, as accu
rate sources of information about
the quality and demands of a Stan
ford education. Students are, after
all, the people who experience the
joys and horrors of Stanford's
course offerings.
Second, the results of the com
mission's work could conceivably
alter the definition of higher educa
tion. Therefore, students have a
stake in the commission's findings
and are likely to be enthusiastic
participants. The University can
capitalize on both the experiences
and interest of students.
It appears that many students
are concerned with the what com
mission will find: more than 12 stu
dents already volunteered to serve
on the commission, said Commis
sion Chair James Sheehan.
The two students who actually
sit on the commission are vital, but
they cannot represent all the views
held by Stanford's 6,500 under
graduates.
In order for President Casper
and the University as a whole to
improve its undergraduate instruc
tion, the commission must solicit
student input at every step in the
evaluation.
An effective way for the commis
sion to incorporate the thoughts of

students beyond those of its two
members is to use a two-step
approach: First, by allowing stu
dents to suggest which areas of an
undergraduate education need to
be looked at, and second, after
these facets have been identified,
asking students what they think of
the proposed changes.
Students should have the oppor
tunity during fall quarter to sug
gest what issues should be
explored. The most effective
method for receiving these student
responses is for members of the
commission to visit campus resi
dences to explain the commission's
purpose.
In addition to dorm conversa
tions, public forums are also an
effective mechanism to solicit stu
dent input. Opening an electronic
mail account, distributing surveys
through resident assistants and
having a box where students can
submit statements with their ideas
would all serve to encourage stu
dent views.
After the commission formulates
its plan, it should return to the stu
dents for input on the curriculum,
the length of a bachelor's degree
and other issues on its agenda. By
returning to the residences and
keeping the student body informed
of the commission's progress, stu
dents will remain interested in the
findings and will keep contributing
to the process.
If the commission wants to eval
uate teaching methods, for exam
ple, members of the commission
should visit classes of varying sizes
and in multiple disciplines. It
would be a shame if commission
professors lost the chance to evalu
ate their proposals from a stu
dent's perspective.
When the commission outlines
its strategy, it will hopefully reiter
ate the importance of student opin
ion to all its members.
If students know their opinions
count and are given a channel for
their views, they will be more will
ing to participate.
After all, it is the students whose
educations will be ultimately
helped or hampered.
