## Mary Edmonds Student affairs, self assessment and safety 
### 
In this column I will
address three topics:
What Student Affairs
is; periodic self-assess
ment; and safety and
substance abuse.
What is Student
Affairs?
I welcome this opportu
nity to respond to the
question asked most often

of me by students since I came to Stanford
18 months ago. The question is, "What
does a vice provost and dean for Student
Affairs do?" The programs and units in
VPSA include student health services, such
as psychological counseling; judicial affairs;
student union, student organizations and
fraternal organizations; ethnic cultural
organizations; undergraduate admissions;
financial aid; registration; academic advis
ing; learning and teaching skills improve
ment; career planning and placement;
international student programs; housing
facilities and food services; graduate family
services; the disability resource center;
public service center; student information
systems; classroom scheduling; classroom
maintenance, and crisis intervention.
Student Affairs is the support system
for academic pursuits, a seven-days-a
week, 24-hours-a-day operation. Student
Affairs staff, with the able assistance of
students, are charged with creating the
climate and providing the safety nets so

that living and the enhancement of intel
lectual curiousity can be developed.
Periodic Self Assessment
You begin the academic year with a
blank sheet. You will determine what is
written on it. It is a time to reflect on
what did not go well in the past and take
measures to either correct situations or
avoid similar negative ones in the future.
Take time to ask yourself a few questions:
1. What do I think about myself?
2. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would I rate
my self esteem?
3. Can others persuade me to do things I
really do not wish to do in order to be
popular (negative peer pressure)? If yes,
why do I allow this to happen?
4. What is my value system and how does
it define my behavior and my relation
ship with other people?
5. What exactly is my lifestyle? Do I work
and think better in the morning or later
in the day? Knowing the answer to these
questions may make the difference in
how well you study.
6. What do I do to relax? Is it a healthy
practice?
Revisit your responses periodically to see
how you are acting upon them.
Safety and Substance Abuse â€¢
To become good citizens of the Univer
sity and society, you must understand
what it means to assume responsibility
for your own behavior. Equally impor
tant is the recognition that all actions

have consequences. Both safety and sub
stance abuse at Stanford are issues that
can have negative impacts on both the
community and the individual.
We strive to have a safe campus but all
of us must keep it that way. We must pro
tect ourselves from harm by not propping
open doors, by not walking or jogging alone
day or night in unprotected areas, being
alert to potential problems and knowing
what to do when such situations arise.
It should be no secret that illegal
drinking and substance abuse on college
campuses is rampant. To make the most
of your academic pursuits and your rela
tionships, consider the impact of under
age or non-responsible drinking upon
yourself. The University policy on the use
of alcohol is clear. I hope you will famil
iarize yourself with it.
Programs in dorms will be presented
on both safety and substance abuse
issues. Additionally, information on
these topics as well as many others are
available at Cowell Student Health Ser
vice. If you need information on a subject,
do not hesitate to ask. There are also peer
counselors around to assist you.
This can be the most productive and
memorable time in your life. Live each
day to its fullest because this is not a
dress rehearsal. It is the real thing.

Mary Edmonds is the vice provost and
dean for Student Affairs.
