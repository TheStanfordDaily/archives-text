## Academics taking 'second seat' behind first-year trips 
### 
IWAS SHOCKED to find in my mail
box a mailing from the ASSU directed
at the Program Coordinator of Cul
tures, Ideas and Values. A pilot program
for frosh and transfer students, First
Year Trips, hopes to take about 200 stu
dents out during the weekend of Oct. 8-
10, 1993. Notice that the weekend
includes a weekday.
"Similar to those of other colleges and
universities, but with Stanford's own fla
vor," First Year Trips will take these stu

dents "with upperclass leaders on both
outdoor and public-service trips. The
purpose of both trips is to create an
immediate sense of friendship for stu
dents coming to Stanford, while opening
the realms of the nature and public ser
vice to them, and exposing them to a
world outside the campus."
To "avoid scheduling conflicts with
class assignments and exams as much as
possible," First Year Trips, in this mail
ing, asks "that professors not penalize

these students for going on these trips
and ... HI remember this program when
planning their syllabi."
I shall remember this indeed as yet
another symptom that sizable segments
of the Stanford population believe that
academics should take second seat
behind whichever extracurricular or
resume-enhancing pursuit one can
dream of. There have been clamors for
more attention to be given to teaching.
Won't people realize that a necessary

condition of good teaching is adequate
student time spent on studying? One can
not teach people who don't have enough
time for the books.
The nice Californian combination
between the discovery of nature, instant
friendship (I recommend Nescafe instant
as well — for better taste) and public ser
vice is especially savory. Is this "Stan
ford's own flavor?" Some trip!
