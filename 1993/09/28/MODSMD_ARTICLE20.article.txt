# N'Gai Croal: Notes of a non-native son

Hype is dead. He's passe. In the '80s,
selling a product was as simple as
buying more ads, bigger ads and
more spectacular ads — the better to sell
the heck out of your wares. Sometimes
the slogans worked ("Where's the Beef'),
sometimes they didn't (Burger King's
"Herb" campaign). Product placement
was a must; sometimes it worked (Reece's
Pieces in "E.T."), sometimes it didn't
(Atari in "Blade Runner"). And the once
maligned music video became essential to
reach those who wanted their MTV.
Hype is dead. He's been overexposed.
Big names guaranteed success, so every
thing that the Schwarzeneggers, Jack
sons and Clancys of the world touched
turned to gold. These stars didn't actually
have to do anything to get our attention;
the fact that we saw their movies, bought
their records or read their books was
news. Box-office results, pop charts and
best-seller lists became as übiquitous as
box scores and point spreads. We didn't
even need to see, read or listen to the fla
vor of the month; as long as everyone

talked about it, we felt as though we had.
Hype modeled himself on "The Termina
tor;" we could run from him, but we damn
sure couldn't hide. And if by some freak of
fute we escaped, it was just temporary —
he'd be back.
Hype is dead. He was a victim of his own
success. When eveiyone hypes their prod
uct in the same way, we become immune.
Now we're hip to all of their tricks — the
use of a familiar voice that we can't quite
place to sell us a product (Infiniti), using
the score of a successful film in the trailer
for another film to promise us an equally
satisfying experience ("Sliver"), or disguis
ing a commercial as an authentic TV pro
gram (anything by Cher).
Hype is dead. But he won't rest in
peace.
Those product pushers still have to
hustle us, and they're using Hype's bas
tard children to do it. And if one of those
kids doesn't get the job done, there are
two others who'll take his place. We'd bet
ter learn to recognize them when we see
them if we want to regain control of our

lives, so here's a partial list.
Quiet hype. The least offensive of
Hype's offspring. A star releases his or
her product, lets us know that it's out
there, but doesn't hit us over the head
with interviews, tie-ins and other schlock.
Examples: Garth Brooks, "The Fugitive."
Anti hype. An overnight success pro
ceeds to attack the business they've suc
ceeded at, the corporate structure that
supports them, the critics that champi
oned them and even their fans. It often
backfires; witness Peter Greenaway
("The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her
Lover") and Terence Trent D'Arby. But
that won't stop Nirvana and other grunge
bands from giving this approach — the
non-hip-hop equivalent of "No Sellout" —
all they've got.
Less-is-more hype. Warner Bros,
adopted this child in 1989 with "Bat
man." One logo. One concept. 250 million
dollars. Need I say more? Make sure that
your product is as appealing as your logo;
otherwise, the image is everything —
Spike Lee found that out the hard way

last year.
Critical hype. Occasionally, the
nation's critics, working in concert, can
will an entertainment to success. The best
instance of critical hype is "Unforgiven";
how many action flick/Clint Eastwood
fans actually liked the movie?
Self-referential hype. Why let others
define you when you can (re)define your
self first? Prince, Madonna and U2 live or
die by this ethic, remaking themselves in
their own image on virtually every album.
More-is-more hype. Greatest hits,
double albums, special effects, sequels to
books that were written by long dead
writers and special effects all fit into this
category. Most often than not, they suc
ceed ("Use Your Illusion I & II," "Scar
lett," "Jurassic Park") because these
products have an inherent hype factor
that allows the creators to sit back and
watch the voracious media machine go to
work overtime, falling all over itself to
repeatedly print the same story — just so
it doesn't miss the boat.
Faux-underdog hype. A film with

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan is not an
underdog. An "E.T." rip-off with a cute
white kid, a friendly whale and a Michael
Jackson anthem is not an underdog. A
Sylvester Stallone action movie — even in
the wake of "Stop! Or My Mom Will
Shoot" — is definitely not an underdog.
Don't waste your sympathy on this brood.
The worst offender is Hubris hype.
Michael Jackson and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, among others, haven't
realized that hype, '80s style, is dead.
They live in the shadow of their past suc
cesses, forever trying to outdo them
selves. But proclaiming oneself "The King
of Pop" or declaring "This is the best
movie I've ever made" doesn't make it so.
Don't they know that we'll just wait for
the other shoe to drop, put it on and kick
them in the butt?
Hype is dead . . . but as long as his kids
live, our job isn't over.
