## Hammonds a hit for Orioles after Farm training 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Former Stanford outfielder Jeffrey
Hammonds was brought up to the Balti
more Orioles' big-league club after playing
just 56 games of minor-league baseball.
Some say the rookie was overdue for
the promotion.
"Actually, all of [the Orioles' coaches]
kind of felt he should have made the club
in spring training," said Orioles' third
base coach Mike Ferraro. "He's so far
advanced from other people that come into
the game. It takes three years of profes
sional baseball to learn how to play the
game. He's one of these players who's
doing it already."
It's hard not to get excited about Ham
monds, who hits to all fields for average
and power, rarely strikes out and has
exceptional speed.
But it wasn't until late June, when reg
ular Oriole left fielder Brady Anderson was
collared by the chicken pox, that Ham
monds received his call-up.
"I feel this is the right time for me," said
Hammonds after batting over .300 in
month-long stints with Baltimore's Dou
ble-A and Triple-A teams. "I think that I
have gotten what I could out of both levels
(in the minors) and now is the time for me
to get my feet wet."
Hammonds got his feet wet in a hurry,
singling in each of his first two
league at-bats and belting a home run in
his second game.
Indeed, neck spasms have proven to be
tougher on Hammonds than American
League pitching. Before going on the dis
abled list in early August, he was hitting
.305 with three home runs and 19 runs
batted in over 105 at-bats.
Hammonds' success sent no shock
waves through the Farm, however. Since
graduating from Scotch Plains-Fan wood
(N.J.) High in 1989, the right-hander has
made an immediate impact in every orga
nization he has joined.
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess signed
Hammonds to a letter of intent in 1989.
Without the letter of intent, Hammonds
was a shoo-in first-round pick in the June
1989 professional draft. Even with the let
ter, the Toronto Blue Jays selected Ham
monds in the ninth round of the draft.
"He was definitely the best position

player in the U.S. coming out of high
school that year," Marquess said. "The
only question surrounding Jeffrey was
whether or not he'd sign a pro contract.
But he was always pretty emphatic about
going to college."
As a frosh, the 6-foot, 195-pound Ham
monds was given the Cardinal starting
center field job by Marquess, a designation
reserved for few freshmen in Marquess'
17-year tenure.
"If you have one or at most two fresh
man playing, it's a sign of team strength,"
Marquess said. "But I thought he would be
our starting center fielder when we
recruited him."

'Let's not put him in the
Hall of Fame yet. Let
him earn it.'

Batting in the leadoff position, Ham
monds had the best freshman campaign in
Cardinal history, establishing single-sea
son school records for runs scored (83) and
stolen bases (48) and stringing together a
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
record 37-game hitting streak. Hammonds
hit .355 for the year and gained consensus
All-America honors, the first Cardinal
freshman ever to do so.
More impressively, Stanford finished
with an NCAA-leading 59 victories, hold
ing the No. 1 national ranking most of the
season before losing to eventual-champion
Georgia in the College World Series semifi
nals.
"We had a lot of talent on that team,"
Marquess said, "But Jeffrey was the icing
on the cake."
Bolstered by the powerful bats of Ail-
Americans Paul Carey and Tim Griffin,
the 1990 Cardinal had the flexibility to use
Hammonds in a leadoff role. With Carey
and Griffin gone in 1991, Marquess moved
Hammonds from leadoff to cleanup in the
lineup.
Responding to the demands of the
cleanup spot, Hammonds doubled his
home run output to 14 and finished second
on the squad with 57 runs batted in, more
than compensating for a 28-point drop in
batting average.

"He made some adjustments for
power," Marquess said. "It was more diffi
cult for him because he was more of a line
drive hitter."
While Hammonds adapted to his new
role, Stanford first baseman David McCar
ty, who hit in the No. 3 slot most of the
year, had a monster season, batting .420
with 24 home runs.
"We figured that teams would have to
pitch to McCarty with Hammonds hitting
behind him," Marquess said. "McCarty
owed a lot of what he did to Hammonds."
When McCarty left after the 1991 sea
son, Hammonds returned to his leadoff
role and earned his second All-America
honors. Despite battling a wrist injury
most of the year, Hammonds led the Six-
Pac with a .377 average. For the season, he
struck out only five times in almost 250 at
bats.
"He had so much pressure on him all
the time, yet he made it look so easy," Mar
quess said.
The class of the 1992 draft, Hammonds
was chosen fourth overall by the Orioles,
passed up by three teams in favor of less
costly signees.
The decision not to draft Hammonds
may prove far more costly than the
$975,000 bonus he received from Balti
more. After pacing the U.S. Olympic Team
with a .414 average last summer, Ham
monds made the Orioles' 1993 spring
major league roster. Bothered by a pulled
hamstring for must of the preseason,
Hammonds batted .500 in limited action.
Baltimore manager Johnny Oates,
mindful of the ups and downs of Oriole
pitcher Ben Mac Donald, another high
draft pick who rose quickly to the big
leagues, assigned Hammonds to Balti
more's Double-A club in Bowie, Md., to
start the year.
"I wasn't surprised at all by Jeffrey's
start this year," Marquess said. "He's
excelled at virtually every possible level."
Indeed, Hammonds has already been
compared to Rickey Henderson and Willie
Mays in his brief career. Oates, however,
avoids such suggestions.
"You can see that he has a lot of talent,"
Oates said. "But let's not label him yet so
that he ha.s goals that are unreachable
right away.
"Let's not put him in the Hall of Fame
yet. Let him earn it."
