# Irish eyes are always smiling on gridiron
## 
### 
I remember watching my first
Notre Dame football game at
the age of six.
Down by three touchdowns
midway through the fourth quar
ter of the 1979 Cotton Bowl, the
Irish won the game with no time
left on the clock when Joe Mon
tana hit Kris Haynes in double
coverage in the right corner of the
end zone.

My father jumped up and down,
hugging my grandfather. My moth
er burst into tears. My grandmoth
er clutched her rosary beads close to
her heart and smiled. It was a beau
tiful day, one of the most memo
rable experiences in my young life.
Thus began my indoctrination
into the ways of Notre Dame foot
ball.
At a sprinkling of colleges in the
United States, a group which
includes Stanford, football is merely
a sport, one dish on a varied menu
of intercollegiate athletic entrees.
Sure, we've got Bill and we've
got the Axe, but we've also got a
women's soccer team that's a heck
of a lot more competitive than our
football team.
Other schools, mostly big state
schools in the South and Midwest,
are known as football factories. At
these institutions the gridiron is a
mystical place, a gathering spot
where students, faculty, alumni and
community members join together
in opposing another entity — Michi
gan vs. Ohio State, Oklahoma and
Texas. Such rivalries have taken on
almost epic proportions.
In these matchups, bitterness
and bad feelings can last for years,
even decades. But when the dust
settles in Ann Arbor or Austin, foot
ball is football, life is life, and a dis
tinct gulf divides the two.
Notre Dame is difTerent. It is not
a large university; its student botjy
of 8,750 undergraduates pales in
comparison to those at state
schools in the region. In the state of
Indiana alone, five colleges boast
bigger student populations.
Notre Dame also prides itself on

its selectivity. Less than 30 percent
of freshmen applicants are accept
ed, and SAT scores among students
hover in the 1,200 range.
But perhaps the most intriguing
element of the school is its religious
focus. Notre Dame is a Catholic
school, run by the brothers and
fathers of the Order of the Holy
Cross. Dormitories are single-sex,
there are student curfews and sexu
al behavior is not allowed between
unwed students.
The effects of this combination
of ethics and intelligence become
clearer on the football field. The
Fighting Irish represent what is
good and pure in the big bad world
of intercollegiate football. Period.
I awoke to these revelations
early in my life. In my family, we
were not allowed to watch television
while we ate dinner, unless we hap
pened to be watching the Notre
Dame game.
In church, the priest who led the
Saturday evening mass in my
parish would begin his sermon by
asking who knew the most updated
score of the Notre Dame game.
Ten minutes before the end of
services, fathers would sneak out
side to their cars and tune their
radios to Notre Dame's national
radio network. Inside, the priest
would hurry through his Final
Blessing, saying a special prayer for
his beloved Irish.
When I was 13, Notre Dame lost
58-7 to the University of Miami,
closing out one of the most disap
pointing seasons in the 100-year
history of the program. Miami dom
inated every aspect of the game, as
they would dominate almost every
other opponent who had the misfor
tune to face the Hurricanes that
season.
But none of that mattered.
Miami had humiliated the Irish.
And this was unforgivable. Televi
sion announcers screamed in indig
nation. A former Notre Dame coach
talked of the team "rising from the
ashes" of the defeat. Miami football
players were burned in effigy.
And while Notre Dame did get its
revenge, beating the Hurricanes in
a grudge match a few years later,
memories of the defeat remain.
When former Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson entered the Notre Dame
football offices a few months ago, a
secretary in the office referred to
him as "Satan".
Satan?
All of this only makes me wonder

how Notre Darners view the Farm,
our haven of promiscuity, homosex
uality and 00-ed showers.
Three years ago, Stanford
defeated a top-ranked Notre Dame
squad 36-31 on the road. Last year,
the Cardinal cruised to a 33-16 vic
tory, again spoiling Notre Dame's
shot at a national championship.
Both victories were treated as
pleasant surprises on our campus,
as they were.
At Notre Dame, you might have
thought that the Pope had been
shot. People stayed in their dorm
rooms and locked their doors.
Restaurants and gas stations closed
up shop. The Notre Dame school
flag flew at half mast.

Two of my best friends from
home go to Notre Dame. I grew up
with them, I learned to walk and
talk with them, and I watched foot
ball with them on countless week
ends.
Both refused to talk to me for
weeks following the Stanford wins.
There is no separation of life and
football at Notre Dame.
From time to time, grumblings
surface on our campus that stu
dents "don't care" enough about
the Cardinal football team. And
maybe these complaints are true.
Our stadium almost never fills to
capacity and our fans are often
outcheered by fans from the visiting
team.
There is no right way or wrong
way to support a team. There are
only different ways.
After three years at Stanford, I
think I prefer our way.

Three years ago, Stanford
defeated a top-ranked Notre Dame
squad 36-31 on the road. Last year,
the Cardinal cruised to a 33-16 vic
tory, again spoiling Notre Dame's
shot at a national championship.
Both victories were treated as
pleasant surprises on our campus,
as they were.
At Notre Dame, you might have
thought that the Pope had been
shot. People stayed in their dorm
rooms and locked their doors.
Restaurants and gas stations closed
up shop. The Notre Dame school
flag flew at half mast.

Two of my best friends from
home go to Notre Dame. I grew up
with them, I learned to walk and
talk with them, and I watched foot
ball with them on countless week
ends.
Both refused to talk to me for
weeks following the Stanford wins.
There is no separation of life and
football at Notre Dame.
From time to time, grumblings
surface on our campus that stu
dents "don't care" enough about
the Cardinal football team. And
maybe these complaints are true.
Our stadium almost never fills to
capacity and our fans are often
outcheered by fans from the visiting
team.
There is no right way or wrong
way to support a team. There are
only different ways.
After three years at Stanford, I
think I prefer our way.
I remember watching my first
Notre Dame football game at
the age of six.
Down by three touchdowns
midway through the fourth quar
ter of the 1979 Cotton Bowl, the
Irish won the game with no time
left on the clock when Joe Mon
tana hit Kris Haynes in double
coverage in the right corner of the
end zone.

My father jumped up and down,
hugging my grandfather. My moth
er burst into tears. My grandmoth
er clutched her rosary beads close to
her heart and smiled. It was a beau
tiful day, one of the most memo
rable experiences in my young life.
Thus began my indoctrination
into the ways of Notre Dame foot
ball.
At a sprinkling of colleges in the
United States, a group which
includes Stanford, football is merely
a sport, one dish on a varied menu
of intercollegiate athletic entrees.
Sure, we've got Bill and we've
got the Axe, but we've also got a
women's soccer team that's a heck
of a lot more competitive than our
football team.
Other schools, mostly big state
schools in the South and Midwest,
are known as football factories. At
these institutions the gridiron is a
mystical place, a gathering spot
where students, faculty, alumni and
community members join together
in opposing another entity — Michi
gan vs. Ohio State, Oklahoma and
Texas. Such rivalries have taken on
almost epic proportions.
In these matchups, bitterness
and bad feelings can last for years,
even decades. But when the dust
settles in Ann Arbor or Austin, foot
ball is football, life is life, and a dis
tinct gulf divides the two.
Notre Dame is difTerent. It is not
a large university; its student botjy
of 8,750 undergraduates pales in
comparison to those at state
schools in the region. In the state of
Indiana alone, five colleges boast
bigger student populations.
Notre Dame also prides itself on

its selectivity. Less than 30 percent
of freshmen applicants are accept
ed, and SAT scores among students
hover in the 1,200 range.
But perhaps the most intriguing
element of the school is its religious
focus. Notre Dame is a Catholic
school, run by the brothers and
fathers of the Order of the Holy
Cross. Dormitories are single-sex,
there are student curfews and sexu
al behavior is not allowed between
unwed students.
The effects of this combination
of ethics and intelligence become
clearer on the football field. The
Fighting Irish represent what is
good and pure in the big bad world
of intercollegiate football. Period.
I awoke to these revelations
early in my life. In my family, we
were not allowed to watch television
while we ate dinner, unless we hap
pened to be watching the Notre
Dame game.
In church, the priest who led the
Saturday evening mass in my
parish would begin his sermon by
asking who knew the most updated
score of the Notre Dame game.
Ten minutes before the end of
services, fathers would sneak out
side to their cars and tune their
radios to Notre Dame's national
radio network. Inside, the priest
would hurry through his Final
Blessing, saying a special prayer for
his beloved Irish.
When I was 13, Notre Dame lost
58-7 to the University of Miami,
closing out one of the most disap
pointing seasons in the 100-year
history of the program. Miami dom
inated every aspect of the game, as
they would dominate almost every
other opponent who had the misfor
tune to face the Hurricanes that
season.
But none of that mattered.
