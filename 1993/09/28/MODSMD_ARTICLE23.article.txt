# Strong break from gate
## Runners dominate at San Diego, Davis 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford cross country ran over the hills,
through the woods and all over their opponents
to open their 1993 schedule.
The Cardinal season began a week ago at the
Aztec Invitational in San Diego, where the
men's team placed first and the women came in
second. Following up on this victory, the team
handily disposed of California last weekend at
the UC-Davis Invitational, a dual-meet compe
tition.
Despite encountering solid competition from
squads such as UCLA and Northern Arizona at
the Aztec Invite, the No. 21 Cardinal men cap
tured first place among the 18 entrants with a
score of 62. The Bruins were hot on their tails,
posting a total of 71.
With a 69-point tally, the No. 12 women's
team finished second in a 14-team field. Unlike
the men, who did not have to face top-ranked
Arkansas, the Stanford women ran behind the
similiarly top-ranked Razorback women, who
scored 26 points. Third-place UCLA trailed
with 127 points.

Individually, the top five runners for both
Stanford squads all placed in the top twenty.
In cross country, the top five runners on a
team score points based on how they place in a
race. A second-place finish earns two points,
third garners three, and so forth. The winner is
the squad with the fewest points.
For the men, All-American senior captain
Gary Stolz led the way with a first-place perfor
mance. As a surprise to head coach Vin Lanan
na, Stanford's top five included three highly
recruited freshmen. Andrew Cowgill, Gregory
Jimmerson and J.J. White secured 11th, 13th
and 14th respectively, while senior Todd Lewis
sealed the win with a 18th-place finish.
"It's unusual that three of the top five are
freshmen," said Lan anna. "I'm very impressed.
They ran exceedingly well. Their transition |to
collegiate runningl seems to be going quite well
so far."
On the women's side, senior Louise Watson
led the Cardinal with a seventh-place perfor
mance. Sophomore Laura Hayward followed
closely with a ninth-place finish, while senior
captain Sarah Truitt, junior Stephanie Jensen
and freshman Leila Burr came in 16th, 18th

and 19th respectively.
"Louise [Watson] is just getting into shape
after taking some time off," Lananna added.
"Laura [Hayward] and Sarah [Truitt] are in
very good shape."
The close finishes between individuals on
both the men's and women's squads reflect the
strategy employed in cross country.
"In cross country, you try to keep the gap
[between your runners] small, in both time and
distance [so that your last runner doesn't hurt
the team's standing]," Lananna said. "That's
what happened. If we keep that kind of gap,
we're gonna have a very good season."
At the UC-Davis Invitational last Sunday,
only two Division I schools — Stanford and
Berkeley — participated, along with various
Division II and club teams. Although scoring
still depended upon individual finishes in the
15-team field, each squad's final tally was com
puted against runners from the same division.
In both the men's and women's cases, the Car
dinal was victorious, 15-50, over the Golden
Bears.
Although they managed to
achieve great success, neither the
Stanford men nor women pushed
themselves to their limits in the two
meets.
According to Lananna, while the
Arkansas women "bunched up
early and established a lead," Stan
ford's strategy was to start the race
in a conservative fashion.
"Cross country is not like football
or basketball, where your record is
very importt t," Lananna ex
plained. "Cross country is more of a
one-shot deaL Every [Pacific 10 Con
ference] team will go to Pac-lOs.
However you do in that one race is

how you finish in the Pac-10."
"Over the season, you want to
make sure you don't overwork,"
Lananna added.
"If you do, you'll get overuse
iryuries and simple tiredness. I'd
rather be good at the end of the sea
son.
Lananna especially heeds his
own warning when it comes to the
men's squad.
In collegiate cross country, only
women retain the standard 5000-
meter distance commonly run in
high school. College men must run
8000-meter and 10,000-meter
races, a significant factor for a Stan
ford men's team which had three
freshmen finishing in their top five.
"We have a long way to go,"
Lananna said.
"But we're optimistic."

distance [so that your last runner doesn't hurt
the team's standing]," Lananna said. "That's
what happened. If we keep that kind of gap,
we're gonna have a very good season."
At the UC-Davis Invitational last Sunday,
only two Division I schools — Stanford and
Berkeley — participated, along with various
Division II and club teams. Although scoring
still depended upon individual finishes in the
15-team field, each squad's final tally was com
puted against runners from the same division.
In both the men's and women's cases, the Car
dinal was victorious, 15-50, over the Golden
Bears.
Although they managed to
achieve great success, neither the
Stanford men nor women pushed
themselves to their limits in the two
meets.
According to Lananna, while the
Arkansas women "bunched up
early and established a lead," Stan
ford's strategy was to start the race
in a conservative fashion.
"Cross country is not like football
or basketball, where your record is
very importt t," Lananna ex
plained. "Cross country is more of a
one-shot deaL Every [Pacific 10 Con
ference] team will go to Pac-lOs.
However you do in that one race is

how you finish in the Pac-10."
"Over the season, you want to
make sure you don't overwork,"
Lananna added.
"If you do, you'll get overuse
iryuries and simple tiredness. I'd
rather be good at the end of the sea
son.
Lananna especially heeds his
own warning when it comes to the
men's squad.
In collegiate cross country, only
women retain the standard 5000-
meter distance commonly run in
high school. College men must run
8000-meter and 10,000-meter
races, a significant factor for a Stan
ford men's team which had three
freshmen finishing in their top five.
"We have a long way to go,"
Lananna said.
"But we're optimistic."
