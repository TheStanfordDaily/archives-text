# Athletes of the Week

The Daily's Athletes of the Week — One if
by air, two if by sea: if Cardinal athletes were
the subjects of Longfellow's poem, this line
might have to be revised to read, "six if by
land, four if by sea," in honor of this week's
goal-scoring efforts by women's soccer rookie
sensation Erin Martin and men's water polo
star Wolf Wigo.

Martin, a freshman from Arcadia, Calif.,
accumulated her astonishing total over three
games. The California Soccer Player of the
Year in 1992, Martin has started the 1993
season right where she left off a year ago —
terrorizing opponents with her goal-scoring
prowess. The forward began her scoring bar
rage against the Gauchos of UCSB by heading
in a pass from Sarah Rafanelli; the Rafanelli
to-Martin combination later combined on
another goal which clinched a 3-0 Cardinal
win.
After scoring another goal against
Arkansas last Saturday, Martin single-hand
edly embarrassed the Trojans of the Universi
ty of Arkansas-Little Rock, completing a hat
trick and leading Stanford to an 8-0 victory.
In all, Martin has certainly merited coach
lan Sawyers' plaudit, "She came in as a fresh
man with a tremendous reputation for scoring;
fortunately for us, she stepped right into Divi
sion I and was able to continue her success."

Cardinal men's water polo coach Dante
Dettamanti was also looking for a goal-scorer
over the weekend, and found him in the per
son of Wigo. A junior from New York, Wigo
scored four goals in Stanford's 11-6 victory
over UCLA at deGuerre pool on Saturday.
While scoring four goals in a game may be
a once-in-a-lifetime achievement for most
water polo players, it is just another day at

the office for Wigo, who was the Cardinal's
leading scorer in 1991 and '92, with 46 and
42 goals, respectively; furthermore, he was a
second-team Ail-American last year.
Wigo's success did not go unnoticed by the
Cardinal coach. After the game, Dettamanti
stated, "When we needed a g0a1... he put one
in."
