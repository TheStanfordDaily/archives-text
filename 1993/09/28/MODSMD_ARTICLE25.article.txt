# Field hockey hopes for increased success
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
After a season's hiatus from
NCAA post-season play, the Stan
ford women's field hockey team is
aiming to recapture the Northern
Pacific Conference championship
and net its third NCAA tourna
ment bid in four years.
The Cardinal finished second in
NorPac last year with a league
mark of 2-3-1 and an overall record
of 4-9-2. Head coach Sheryl John
son said that the squad's success in
1993 hinges on consistency.
"We've had close games and
we've played well, so the victories
will come," she said.
Stanford is aided by the return
of its most prolific scorer, Sara Hal
lock, a 1992 Ail-American and Nor-
Pac Player of the Year. The senior
provided much of the Cardinal's
offensive sting last year, knocking
in 12 of the team's 18 goals.
And while Hallock's strong
swing will spark the offense, fellow
senior tri-captain Danielle Beynet
will anchor the defense and the
third senior tri-captain, Gina Bian
chini, is expected to spearhead the
attack from midfield.
Two key holes will have to be
plugged as 1992 All-NorPac selec
tions — midfielder Chris Trevino
and goalkeeper Kristina Vidal —
graduated. Loretta Hidalgo, a
sophomore goalie, will bear the
pressure of keeping the squad close
in crucial matches.
In the season opener against
Boston University, the squad took a
2-1 lead on the strength of freshman
Susan Fishman's early tally, Hal

lock's first goal of the year and Hidal
go's 10 first-half saves. Then the
Terriers str i<' r or two unanswered
goals in id half to the
oome-foom-beinnd victor
After Rutgers routed Stanford,
the Cardinal lost another close
game, this time to NorPac rival
California. With a goal from
Anneliese Lodge in the opening
minutes of the game, the Bears
grabbed an early lead.
Hallock, who leads the squad in
scoring with six goals and one
assist, evened the score in the sec
ond half. The squads fought back
and forth until Cal scored four min
utes into overtime to clinch the win.
Hallock was again a dominant
player on offense Thursday when
Stanford notched its second victory
of the season with a 4-0 shutout of
the University of the Pacific.
The senior was in on the first
and last scoring plays of the game
as she made the assist on Fish
man's first-half goal and slammed
home the last score.
But junior midfielder Tina Syer
and sophomore midfielder Elise
Morgan put the game away mid
way through the match with two
unanswered tallies. Morgan, who
has balanced Hallock's offensive
attack with five goals and an assist
of her own, capitalized on her only
shot on goal and added an assist on
Hallock's score.
The squad's next match-up is
on Thursday, when the Cardinal
hosts California, who knocked
Stanford out of NCAA playoff
contention last season and took
three out of four games from the
Cardinal in 1992.
