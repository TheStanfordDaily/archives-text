# Off to Washington
## Med School prof, awarded White House fellowship

Medical School Asst. Prof.
Kevin Grimes is hanging up his
stethoscope for a year and head
ing off to Washington, D.C.,
with the newly acquired rank of
a four-star general. But since it
is only a protocol rank, the only
military maneuvers he will per
form will be in the Pentagon's
soon-to-be revamped area of
health care polity.
Grimes, who has served Stan
ford both as a Medical School
educator and a practicing doctor
of general internal medicine, was
appointed as one of 17 White
House Fellows for 1993-94. On
Sept. 1, he began his year-long
fellowship as special assistant to
the Secretary of Defense.
In the Pentagon, Grimes
works most closely with Assis
tant Secretary of Health Affairs
Edward D. Martin, whom he will
assist in planning the implemen
tation of health care reform for
the nearly 8.5 million Depart
ment of Defense employees and
dependents.
Each Fellow is assigned to a
White House or Cabinet agency
as a special assistant employed
by the government and is
involved in a mqjor project. The
hands-on experience in gover
nance complements the educa
tional component consisting of
meetings with business and gov
ernment leaders and other
prominent figures.
Although it is still early in the
fellowship, "it's getting excit
ing," Grimes said. "Reforming
the entire health care delivery in
the military is a msyor transi
tion," he said.
Grimes, 35, is also making his
own transition. Because his
leave of absence will have
expired before he returns to
Stanford, he resigned from med

ical practice at Stanford, where
he also recently completed his
M.B.A. in health management.
Grimes said he is committed
to performing further public ser
vice after his year at the Pen
tagon. While he will continue to
see patients, he hopes to work on
improving health care access.
Though President Clinton's
health care reform accomplishes
a great deal in "fixing the finan
cial difficulties of the system,"
Grimes said, "some rural areas
and urban areas like East Palo
Alto will still be underserved.
"I'd like to gain experience in
getting things accomplished in
government, get a better sense
of how government runs, hew
change is implemented," Grimes
said.
President Lyndon Johnson
began the White House Fellows
program in 1964. Each year, 11
to 17 men and women in the for
mative years of their careers are
selected as White House Fellows
to foster a sense of involvement
in the nation's leadership.
This year, about 1,000 people
applied for the fellowship, whose
alumni include General Colin
Powell and Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Henry
Cisneros.
"The program brings Ameri
ca's best and brightest up close
to the highest level of govern
ment to understand how public
polity is made. Then they return
to and help their own localities
and professions," said Will
Wechsler, special assistant to
the Director of the White House
Fellows program.
"He was one of the fmest
house officers, one of the more
senior primary care doctors and
the chosen doctor of many facul
ty members," said Prof. Ed
Shortliffe, chief of Stanford
Medical Center's division of gen
eral internal medicine.
