A policy that bans smoking in all University
buildings, vehicles and covered walkways will
go into effect Oct. 15, according to Tom Matte
oli, University director of employee relations
and development.
The new policy will also ban cigarette sales
on campus. However, this part of the policy
will not be enforced until Sept. 1, 1994, the
starting date of a new lease between Tresidder
Express and Tresidder Union which will take
into account the convenience store's loss of to
bacco sales.
Matteoli said the policy, which was ap
proved by the University Cabinet in late sum
mer, is being implemented partly in response
to studies about the dangers of secondhand

smoke. The University also made the change in
order to develop "positive relations" with
neighboring municipalities, which are entirely
smoke-free.
Banning tobacco sales is "a big bite for us in
terms of revenue," said Paul Szczesiul, associ
ate director of Tresidder Union. "The provost
has given us a one-year exemption I from the
policy] to find some alternative revenue
sources."
Tobacco products currently comprise 10
percent of total sales revenue at Tresidder Ex
press, the only campus store that sells ciga
rettes.
The new lease agreement should reflect
these changes, Szczesiul said. The current
lease agreement mandates that the Bookstore,
which owns Tresidder Express, pay the Uni
versity 10 percent of the store's gross profits or
a minimum of $120,000 annually. If sales fall

10 percent and the lease agreement were to re
main the same, the Bookstore could lose up to
$12,000 a year.
The new policy is different from the propos
al printed for community feedback in Campus
Report last year, in that it adds residence halls
to the areas where smoking is prohibited.
However, the Bmoking ban in residence
halls will not go into effect until the 1994-95
school year, Matteoli said, because students'
contracts with the residence halls that would
have enforced the policy were signed last
spring, before the policy had been approved.
Once that part of the policy goes into Pifect,
residents who are currently allowed to smoke
— such as students living in singles or students
whose roommates do not object to their smok
ing — will no longer be allowed to smoke.
