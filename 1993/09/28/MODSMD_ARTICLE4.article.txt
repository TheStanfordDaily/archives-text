# Feminist Studies cancels course on self-defense
## Class charged with Title IX violations 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
A class teaching self-defense
for women will not be offered this
quarter because of charges that it
violates a federal gender-equity
law.
The U.S. Department of Edu
cation's Office for Civil Rights no
tified the University of possible
violations after receiving an
anonymous complaint in mid-Au
gust against the course, titled "Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women."
For the past few weeks, the
Feminist Studies Department
and the Women Defending Our
selves Collective — who sponsor

and teach the course, respectively
— have been scrambling to
change the course to comply with
the Title IX anti-discrimination
statute.
But the collective decided last
week to pull the course until a
suitable format could be
arranged.
According to collective
spokesperson Kris Carpenter,
there was difficulty deciding what
that new approach might be, with
equal concern over whether it
would both meet the statute and
at the same time not compromise
the program's integrity.
The University's legal office
received notice of the complaint
from the civil rights office in a let
ter dated Aug. 16, leaving little
time to make a proper decision,
Carpenter said.
After the Program in Feminist
Studies assumed sponsorship of
the class last year, it was offered
for the first time to men as well as
women.
Three separate components
were emphasized: readings and
discussion, assertiveness training
and physical self-defense train
ing.
According to Assoc. University
Counsel Iris Brest, the unnamed
complainant alleged discrimina
tion because the class was offered
to two sections limited by sex, and
because the men's section did not
include the physical self-defense
component.
"The physical training is based
on women's bodies," said Alyson
Yarus, a member of the 15-mem
ber collective, in a statement.

"We know how women should
defend themselves."
Jeannie Alcouloumbre, the
department's program coordina
tor said: "By offering the special
class for men, technically we
weren't offering the same class."
Though Title IX allows for sep
arating sexes if physical force is
involved, separate discussions
and non-physical interactions
were also segregated in the self
defense classes.
In a statement by Jane Collier,
chair of the Feminist Studies
Department, class organizers
believed that since many of the
women in the self-defense class
were sexual-abuse or assault vic
tims, they would not be comfort
able talking in a mixed-sex group.
Since the allegation's facts
were not in dispute, Brest said
the standard procedure of a for
mal investigation and negotiation
of remedy was bypassed.
"It was clear to all of us that
the class couldn't continue the
way it was going," said Brest, not
ing that no advice was given to
the collective on how to take
action. "(The collective's action)
was voluntary."

Carpenter said the collective
couldn't agree on how to run the
program on such short notice.
"We don't have enough infor
mation right now to deal with
this," Carpenter said. "We were
not prepared as instructors (to
teach men) in a class (originally)
designed for women by women."
In addition, said Carpenter,
"there were too many issues
involved to make a decision. We
had to take a step back to effec
tively find and teach the course,
whatever the format."
The collective will be conduct
ing discussions this quarter to
explore "options on various lev
els," said Collier. "(We're) hoping
to open up a general discussion,
maybe a town meeting. There's a
lot of need and want for the
course among the students," she
said.
Alcouloumbre said both the
Feminist Studies Department
and the collective need time to
"regroup" and wrestle with how
to "comply with the needs of the
people who want to take the
course and (still) comply with the
law."
Cancellation of the class has

angered some students, who
believe that the course should not
have to be dropped because of
such pressure.
Though supporting an "obliga
tion to Title IX," senior Susie Fox
expressed surprise and disap
pointment at the loss of the pro
gram.
"This is something that was
keeping me safe and sane at Stan
ford," said Fox. "It's something
you always carry with you."
Junior Abby Reyes expressed
anger at the loss of what she
believed was "my most crucial
part of my introduction to Stan
ford."
"To think that it's not going to
be there makes me irate," she
said. "How much more can (peo
ple) ask for? What is this defen
siveness coming from the men on
campus? The reason we teach
this class is so that someday we
won't have to."
Echoing Reyes' feelings,
Matthew Mizel — the founder of
the men's collective established
as a counterpart to the women's
organization last year — said the
decision represents a "backwards
approach to crimes of sexual vie

lence."
"I don't totally understand
how the (complainant's) claim
can be legitimate since a men's
class is offered," said Mizel, one of
three men who signed up for the
men's self-defense class last
spring. "It was very empowering
to be with men (in that situa
tion)."
"It's changed the way I live my
life," said senior Christa Farmer,
a weekend instructor of the
course. "I think it's very sad to
lose such a great resource for
women."
Collier said she frequently
hears that kind of comment,
recalling numerous faculty not
ing that the class "does wonders
for women's self image. It turns
shy and uncertain people into
ones who speak out in class."
However, she supported the
collective's decision to cancel the
class rather than integrate both
sections.
"Given how little time we had
to consider all the possibilities,
the decision to cancel the class
was made so we could make a
sensible decision as opposed to a
rushed one."
