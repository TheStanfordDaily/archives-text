# Feminist Studies cancels course on self-defense
## Class charged with Title IX violations 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
A class teaching self-defense
for women will not be offered this
quarter because of charges that it
violates a federal gender-equity
law.
The U.S. Department of Edu
cation's Office for Civil Rights no
tified the University of possible
violations after receiving an
anonymous complaint in mid-Au
gust against the course, titled "Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women."
For the past few weeks, the
Feminist Studies Department
and the Women Defending Our
selves Collective — who sponsor

and teach the course, respectively
— have been scrambling to
change the course to comply with
the Title IX anti-discrimination
statute.
But the collective decided last
week to pull the course until a
suitable format could be
arranged.
According to collective
spokesperson Kris Carpenter,
there was difficulty deciding what
that new approach might be, with
equal concern over whether it
would both meet the statute and
at the same time not compromise
the program's integrity.
