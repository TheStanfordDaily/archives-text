# New plan to address grad housing needs
## 
### Johnathon Briggs Staff writer 
Spurred by graduate students'
concerns about housing, a Univer
sity committee is drawing up a pro
posal to focus more of Stanford's
10-year housing plan on graduate
students' needs.
However, the committee, which
hopes to submit a definite construc
tion plan to the Board of Trustees
by early winter, cannot make any
formal plans until they have a clear
er understanding of graduate hous
ing demand, said Jacqueline Wen
der, a University facilities planner.
Once the committee has gath
ered data on both undergraduate
and graduate housing needs, the
committee will decide whether to
build a new residence for under
graduates, graduates or both on the
site of the Manzanita trailers.
To "come up with something for
all students, we need (to know) the
graduate demand," Wender said.
"The planning wouldn't start until
we got that data. We have to re
spond to new information."

Planning will begin based on
data and recommendations from
Mary Edmonds, vice provost and
dean for student affairs, Wender
said.
Wender said the graduate-hous
ing proposal is part of the Universi
ty's $110 million capital improve
ments plan and not another hous
ing project. The capital improve
ments plan originally intended to
create two new residences, in addi
tion to refurbishing older dorms,
make buildings accessible to dis
abled people and bring buildings up
to state-mandated earthquake
standards.
"This is not a separate plan. We
don't have other sources or funds,"
she said. "The costs of the plan will
have to be met within the (budget of
the) 10-year plan. Just because you
have new ideas, doesn't mean you
have new resources. We have to
budget."
While the demand for under
graduate housing has been "fairly
stable," acting Housing Center di
rector William Georges predicts
that it will increase due to Stan
ford's promise to guarantee hous
ing for all students, beginning with
the Class of '96.
Within one year, the University
will need more housing to accom
modate the increase of guaranteed
students on campus because three
classes will have guaranteed hous
ing.
Most students in the Class of
'95, who will be seniors, will be
drawing guaranteed, he said. Most
students choose to draw unguaran
teed their junior year.
