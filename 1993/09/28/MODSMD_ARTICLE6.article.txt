For car owners returning to campus
this fall, another sign of rising prices
could be served up on their windshield.
The cost of a parking violation has in
creased throughout the University, the
result of a new state law that took effect
July 1.
The cost of a basic violation, which
includes parking at an expired meter

Gibbs, Assistant to Santa Clara County
Supervisor Diane McKenna.

violations. The cost of parking in a
crosswalk or on a sidewalk is now $35,
up from the previous $25. A violation
that poses a safety risk, such as parking

now $250, up from $100. Illegally park-
