# Tickets break car owners' pocketbooks
## 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
For car owners returning to campus
this fall, another sign of rising prices
could be served up on their windshield.
The cost of a parking violation has in
creased throughout the University, the
result of a new state law that took effect
July 1.
The cost of a basic violation, which
includes parking at an expired meter
or parking without a permit, has gone
up by more than 66 percent, from $15
to $25. Other violations will cost
more.
"The law has changed significantly
since July 1. |The new lawl removed

parking violations from the criminal
court and made them a civil violation,"
said Sgt. Hilary Karp, traffic division su
pervisor for the Stanford Department of
Public Safety.
Control over parking violations, in
cluding the setting of fines, shifted from
state to local jurisdictions. For the Uni
versity as well as all other unincorporat
ed areas of Santa Clara County, that au
thority is the County Board of Supervi
sors, which approved the countywide in
crease.
The increase is both a sign of the
state's current fiscal situation as well as
the county's own attempt to bring park
ing violation penalties in some localities
to parity with those in others, said John

Gibbs, Assistant to Santa Clara County
Supervisor Diane McKenna.
According to a county survey, the
cost of a parking ticket in unincorporat
ed areas like Stanford had been less than
the cost in surrounding cities, he said.
The attempt to bring costs to a com
parable level affects almost all kinds of
violations. The cost of parking in a
crosswalk or on a sidewalk is now $35,
up from the previous $25. A violation
that poses a safety risk, such as parking
in a fire zone or near a hydrant, is $50.
Abandoning a car, or leaving it on cam
pus without a permit over summer, is
now $250, up from $100. Illegally park-
ing in a disabled space or blocking
access ramps remains the most
costly, at $280.
"[The higher fines] will proba
bly have an impact on how many
people buy permits. It doesn't
take too many citations to exceed
the cost of a permit," Karp said.
Non-permitted vehicles will be
less likely to take parking spaces,
making it easier for people with
permits to find parking, he said.
The University's Department
of Public Safety, which enforces
the regulations, has already begun
issuing the higher priced tickets.
However, during the move-in peri
od, the department is not citing
for parking without a permit in
residential "C" lots. The period of
leniency will end some time in

'It doesn't take too
many citations to
exceed the cost
of a permit.'
— Sgt. Hilary Karp

early October, Karp said.
Each year nearly 35,000 park
ing citations are issued on cam
pus, Karp said. These citations
are both for violations of state law
and University regulation.
The number of tickets issued
at Stanford exceeds that of most
other universities, said a cus
tomer service representative at
the county's Office of Parking
Violations, which handles park
ing tickets and keeps records for
106 cities and colleges.
