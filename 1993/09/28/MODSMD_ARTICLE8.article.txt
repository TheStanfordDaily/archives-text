# A 						man of many voices
## Grad student tells unique historical narrative 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
He speaks for many cultures, telling
the stories of Spanish, Chinese and Na
tive Americans. His voice rings through
the centuries, speaking as an 18th-centu
ry sergeant and a 1906 earthquake vic
tim. His is the voice of men and women,
children and th'eir ancestors, the victori
ous and the vanquished.
He is Hilton Obenzinger, a white Jew-

ish man and a Stanford student who re
cently published a book titled "Cannibal
Elliot and the Lost Histories of San Fran
cisco," which explores the region's past
from the perspective of those who lived it.
"People could ask, 'Who are you? What
right do you have to speak for these peo
ple?' " Obenzinger said. "I can see that —
I'm a Polish Jew.
"But these stories need to be told, and

we all need to tell them, not just
the few," he said.
Through fictional documents
and oral histories, Obenzinger
tells the sad, amusing and some
times lurid stories of the men and
women who laid the foundations
for today's San Francisco, span
ning the years 1776 to 1906.
Many accounts of San Francis
co's history begin in 1848, with
the Gold Rush, Obenzinger said,
yet the region's history is far rich
er.
"San Francisco is an Indian
place, a Spanish, a Mexican place.
All of that is part of our history,"
he said. "What I wanted to do is
incorporate that as part of the
identity of this place."
A third-year student in the
Modern Thought and Literature
doctoral program and a Bay Area
resident since 1971, Obenzinger
said his fascination with finding
San Francisco's lost voices began
when he was commissioned to
write a history of the New York
City Fire Department.

Though the job was never fin
ished, Obenzinger's award-win
ning poem "New York on Fire"
was born, and with it his interest
in telling the stories of cities.
To ensure the accuracy of the
historical pieces, Obenzinger
researched the writing style of
each era using primary docu
ments, often splicing his findings
into the text.
One selection, "Spite Fence,"
recounts the 1877 worker rebel
lions that turned into anti-Chi
nese riots. Obenzinger obtained a
copy of the letter written from
Chinese companies to the mayor
of San Francisco and incorporat
ed it into a chapter.
"The language of the letter and
what it says is incredibly
restrained and powerful, very
moving," Obenzinger said.
"At a certain point, it's like
encountering ghosts," Oben
zinger said. "The people write
through me. It's a very eerie expe
rience."
At one point, he includes a
character speaking directly to the
"interviewer" — Obenzinger him
self.
"I didn't actually plan on that.
All of a sudden the character

started to speak to me, saying
'You gonna write this? You better
get it straight,' " Obenzinger said.
"What this book does is recover
people who are forgotten, it's hav
ing these people live and speak, to
feel what they're feeling."
But "Cannibal Elliot" does
more than tell the history of San
Francisco in the voices of its for
gotten and displaced. Oben
zinger's sense of these popula
tions comes largely from his own
identity and his experiences on
the Houpa Valley Indian Reserva
tion in Humboldt County.
"I was the representative of
the American government, every
day I had to raise the American
flag," Obenzinger said. "And this
was the time of the Vietnam War,
Alcatraz and really the beginning
of the contemporary American
Indian consciousness revolt —
and I was the only one there that
wasn't related."
Even after leaving the reserva
tion, Obenzinger continued work
ing with the American Indian
Movement through the 19705.
His previous book, "This
Passover or the Next I Will Never
Be In Jerusalem," winner of the
Before Columbus American Book

Award, compares the experiences
of Palestinians and Native Ameri
cans.
"It became very much a part of
my understanding about nature
— the nature of America," Oben
zinger said. "This country is a set
tler, colonial country and that has
shaped our identity."
At Stanford, Obenzinger sees
some of the same cultural rich
ness "Cannibal Elliot" is trying to
keep alive, he said.
"Much of my own college edu
cation happened outside the
classroom in discovering things
that were kept from me," Oben
zinger said, citing the writings of
Frederick Douglass and Rebecca
Harding Davis. "Now all that
stuff is just accepted as main
stream — it's extremely satisfy
ing."
While such progress must be
defended from backlash forces on
campus, more can be done, Oben
zinger said.
"There's a great deal of gentili
ty on campus, but . . . there are
clashes all the time," Obenzinger
said. "Live with the clash, thrive
on it. Don't try to soften the
edges. Try to learn from the way
in which cultures clash."

At Stanford, Obenzinger sees
some of the same cultural rich

"Much of my own college edu

that were kept from me," Oben

While such progress must be
defended from backlash forces on

"There's a great deal of gentili

clashes all the time," Obenzinger
said. "Live with the clash, thrive
on it. Don't try to soften the
edges. Try to learn from the way
in which cultures clash."

from the perspective of those who lived it.
"People could ask, 'Who are you? What
right do you have to speak for these peo

I'm a Polish Jew.

Ph.D. candidate and novelist Hilton Obenzinger recently published a book about
the history of San Francisco.
we all need to tell them, not just
the few," he said.
Through fictional documents
and oral histories, Obenzinger
tells the sad, amusing and some
times lurid stories of the men and
women who laid the foundations
for today's San Francisco, span
ning the years 1776 to 1906.
Many accounts of San Francis
co's history begin in 1848, with
the Gold Rush, Obenzinger said,
yet the region's history is far rich
er.
"San Francisco is an Indian
place, a Spanish, a Mexican place.
All of that is part of our history,"
he said. "What I wanted to do is
incorporate that as part of the
identity of this place."
A third-year student in the
Modern Thought and Literature
doctoral program and a Bay Area
resident since 1971, Obenzinger
said his fascination with finding
San Francisco's lost voices began
when he was commissioned to
write a history of the New York
City Fire Department.

Though the job was never fin
ished, Obenzinger's award-win
ning poem "New York on Fire"
was born, and with it his interest
in telling the stories of cities.
To ensure the accuracy of the
historical pieces, Obenzinger
researched the writing style of
each era using primary docu
ments, often splicing his findings
into the text.
One selection, "Spite Fence,"
recounts the 1877 worker rebel
lions that turned into anti-Chi
nese riots. Obenzinger obtained a
copy of the letter written from
Chinese companies to the mayor
of San Francisco and incorporat
ed it into a chapter.
"The language of the letter and
what it says is incredibly
restrained and powerful, very
moving," Obenzinger said.
"At a certain point, it's like
encountering ghosts," Oben
zinger said. "The people write
through me. It's a very eerie expe
rience."
At one point, he includes a
character speaking directly to the
"interviewer" — Obenzinger him
self.
"I didn't actually plan on that.
All of a sudden the character

started to speak to me, saying
'You gonna write this? You better
get it straight,' " Obenzinger said.
"What this book does is recover
people who are forgotten, it's hav
ing these people live and speak, to
feel what they're feeling."
But "Cannibal Elliot" does
more than tell the history of San
Francisco in the voices of its for
gotten and displaced. Oben
zinger's sense of these popula
tions comes largely from his own
identity and his experiences on
the Houpa Valley Indian Reserva
tion in Humboldt County.
"I was the representative of
the American government, every
day I had to raise the American
flag," Obenzinger said. "And this
was the time of the Vietnam War,
Alcatraz and really the beginning
of the contemporary American
Indian consciousness revolt —
and I was the only one there that
wasn't related."
Even after leaving the reserva
tion, Obenzinger continued work
ing with the American Indian
Movement through the 19705.
His previous book, "This
Passover or the Next I Will Never
Be In Jerusalem," winner of the
Before Columbus American Book

Award, compares the experiences
of Palestinians and Native Ameri
cans.
"It became very much a part of
my understanding about nature
— the nature of America," Oben
zinger said. "This country is a set
tler, colonial country and that has
shaped our identity."
At Stanford, Obenzinger sees
some of the same cultural rich
ness "Cannibal Elliot" is trying to
keep alive, he said.
"Much of my own college edu
cation happened outside the
classroom in discovering things
that were kept from me," Oben

ty on campus, but . . . there are

said. "Live with the clash, thrive
on it. Don't try to soften the
edges. Try to learn from the way
