We book bands.
We want you to help us.
The Stanford Cunccrt Network, formed
in 1984, is a voluntary student
organization devoted strietly to
improving an often atrophied campus
culture by providing a consistent
dosage of LIVE MUSIC. We book some
biggies and we book unknowns. We
book shows in dorms, in White Plaza,
even Frost Amphitheatre. We book
rock, jazz, folk, hip-hop — we try to
book anything that students want to
hear, and sometimes bands we think
they should hear.
Putting on concerts, large or small, can
be extensive productions. We need
techies who know how to run sound
and light systems. We need graphic
design freaks who can obsess over cool
poster designs. We need large, brazen
intimidating types who will look
authoritative in our chic security t
shirts. We need Hollywood hot-shots to
schmooze agents and managers. We
need button-down, pre-business
wiinderkinds to hit up big corporations
to sponsor our concerts.
Actually, you don't have to be any of
the types listed above to be part of the
Concert Network. If you like your
music live, and have your own dream
band you'd like to see play Stanford,
that's all it takes. We'll teach you the
MHHBN FIRST MEETING!
