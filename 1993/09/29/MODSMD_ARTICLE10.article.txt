## Standoff in Moscow Troops encircle parliament 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - President
Boris Yeltsin tried to break the
nerve of defiant hard-line law
makers yesterday, surrounding
the Russian parliament with
thousands of riot police and
troops in his biggest show of force
yet.
Trucks and barbed wire
blocked roads leading to the par
liament building. Senior Interior
Ministry officials barked through
loudspeakers, ordering the law
makers and their supporters to
surrender their weapons and
leave the building by today.
But top presidential aides later
backed off the 24-hour deadline
and said Yeltsin had no intention
of using force.
The ultimatum triggered a
protest by about 3,000 hard-line

demonstrators, some of whom
tried to break through police lines
and march near parliament, beat
ing on cars, throwing rocks at riot
police and building a barricade
across a main street.
Shouting "Shame!" and
"Death to Yeltsin!," the
protesters marched past the U.S.
Embassy, stopping at an under
pass where three young men
died during the August 1991
hard-line coup attempt. Hun
dreds of police in full riot gear
and armed with shields dis
persed the crowd, which threw
rocks at the troops.
Yeltsin has ruled out compro
mise with his opponents, and the
deployment of more troops
stepped up the war of nerves with
the increasingly demoralized and

isolated lawmakers who have
been holed up in the parliament
building — the Russian White
House — since Yeltsin dissolved
parliament a week ago, on Sept.
21.
Many lawmakers were desert
ing the hard-line cause to work in
Yeltsin's administration. More
than 200 deputies are negotiating
job offers with the government,
which set up an employment
office for lawmakers and their
staff.
Yeltsin ordered December elec
tions for a new parliament in an
attempt to end a bitter power
struggle with parliamentary
hard-liners over his political and
free-market reforms. He has
called for presidential elections in
June.
