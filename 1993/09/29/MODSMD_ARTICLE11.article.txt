# Clinton sets goal for Somalia pullout
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton said yesterday there must be a
"date certain" for withdrawing U.S.
troops from Somalia.
Without setting a deadline for U.S.
withdrawal, the president said he
wants the United Nations to first devel
op a political strategy ensuring that
starvation and chaos will not revisit the
East Africa nation after U.N. troops
pull out.
Clinton's push for an exit comes
under pressure from Congress, where
concern is growing that the United
States could become mired in a long
military engagement. His comments
shifted gears from the hunt for fugitive
warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, plac
ing new urgency on achieving political
stability.
"Every peacekeeping mission or
every humanitarian mission has to
have a date certain when it's over,"
Clinton said in a picture-taking session
as he met with Democratic congres

sional leaders.
While the administration still
believes the capture of Aidid would
make it easier to ensure lasting peace in
Somalia, the White House is trying to
change the view that the U.S. is a com
batant.
"The enforcement strategy did not
change," Clinton said. "But what I
wanted to emphasize at the U.N. yes
terday was that there has to be a politi
cal strategy that puts the affairs of
Somalia back into the hands of Soma
lia; that gives every country . . . that
comes into this operation the sense
that they're rotating in and out, that
there is a Fixed date for their ultimate
disengagement in Somalia."
His announcement came as the
House neared a vote on a resolution
asking him to report to Congress by
Oct. 15 on the goals of the Somalia
operation. It also urges Clinton to seek
congressional authorization by Nov. 15
for continued U.S. involvement.

The Senate approved the same pro
vision earlier this month by a resound
ing vote of 90-7.
White House Press Secretary Dee
Dee Myers would not take a position on
the resolution, saying only, "We will
continue to work with Congress to fig
ure out the best strategy."
Criticism over the mission mounted
after it slowly evolved from a humani
tarian effort into a nation-building
operation. The cries grew louder after
three American soldiers were killed
Saturday in Somalia.
The number of U.S. troops in Soma
lia has dropped from 25,000 to 5,000
since the operation began last year.
Myers said the U.S. is negotiating
with the United Nations to replace "a
certain amount" of U.S. troops with
soldiers from other nations or with
civilians. She said existing U.N. plans
call for the United States to reduce its
forces as other countries bring in
troops.
