Abortion ban not lifted
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
refused yesterday to lift the 17-year-old
ban on federally financed abortions for
poor women, rebuffing abortion-right 9
supporters who had hoped that 1993
would be their year.
By a surprisingly decisive 59-40 roll
call, senators defeated an effort to jetti
son the restrictions and instead narrowly
eased them. The move to kill the limita
tions had the backing of President Clin
ton.
Currently, only poor women whose
lives are threatened can use Medicaid to
pay for an abortion.
But the provision approved today
would widen the exemption to allow use
of the funds when pregnancies result
from rape or incest — a change that
abortion-rights supporters had sought
for a decade.

The vote sealed the issue for the year,
because the House noted 255-178 last
June for an identical provision.
The roll call also raised questions
about whether Congress will be willing to
follow Clinton's plan to include abortion
among the procedures that would be cov
ered under his proposed revamping of
the nation's health-care system.
But abortion-rights senators conceded
nothing, predicting that ultimately law
makers would vote to include abortion
coverage in whatever new health plan
emerges from Congress.
"It was the first vote," said Sen. Patty
Murray, D-Wash., who led the fight to
remove the restrictions. "There will be
more, and I predict that one day we will
win"
The restrictions on Medicaid financ
ing of abortions have been in effect since
1977 when the so-called Hyde amend
ment took effect.
