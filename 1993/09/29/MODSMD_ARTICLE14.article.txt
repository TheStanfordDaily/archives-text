The ASSU Senate and
COP must fulfill major
spring promises now

AT MANY UNIVERSITIES,
the hectic back-to-school
period is aggravated by
swarms of student politicians cam
paigning for year-long positions in
student government.
However, at Stanford, the ASSU
holds its student elections during
the first few weeks of spring quar
ter. Ostensibly, this schedule allows
new officers to spend the summer
preparing for the coming year and
helps new students acquaint them
selves with campaign issues before
they have to vote.
Yet the schedule also tends to
force ASSU politicians to spend
winter quarter preparing slates
and candidates for the upcoming
campaign. The election frenzy and
transition confusion during spring
quarter sap what little energy sen
ators or Council of Presidents
members may have left for effec
tive advocacy of student needs.
Fall quarter is, for all intents
and purposes, the time to achieve
students' goals. If the "Clean
Slate" COP and ASSU senators
intend to achieve their campaign
promises, they had better start
their work now — before the politi
cal ambitions of the spring cam
paign appear on the horizon.
The return of an active COP
after a year of nonexistence makes
swift and effective work this quar
ter doubly important. For over a
year, the 13,800 members of the
ASSU have not been directly repre
sented in negotiations with Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper and
his administration, and students
have already faced some of the con
sequences.
First, summer storage for stu
dents has evaporated, despite
efforts by last year's ASSU sena
tors. Former graduate senator
Kevin Murdock admitted last April

that a COP could have dealt more
effectively with the storage issue
than the senate. After a summer of
renting off-campus storage spaces
and astronomical shipping costs,
returning students expect action
from the members of "A Clean
Slate," who promised "revival" of
the service in their campaign.
Next, the graduate membership
of the ASSU has become increas
ingly disgruntled with its repre
sentation. Suggestions by gradu
ate senators last spring included
the separation of graduate votes
from those of undergraduates in
the student-group funding pro
cess. If such a proposal succeeds,
undergraduates may find their
ASSU fees skyrocketing in the face
of decreased graduate support for
what are seen as mainly under
graduate activities.
The COP should work to defuse
such tensions between the two con
stituencies by focusing on more
graduate concerns, including the
promise to advocate more-equi
table graduate housing options.
Perhaps the most vital responsi
bility of "A Clean Slate" during fall
quarter will be to establish a suc
cessful record lobbying President
Casper and his administration. As
the first COP Casper has had to
deal with directly, "Slate" members
will likely set the tone for ASSU
administration relations for years
to come.
For this reason, students will
expect measurable efforts to advo
cate their concerns and improved
communication between studefTts""~
and the ASSU as a whole. By aban
doning the Council of Presidents
for a year, the constituents of the
ASSU have demonstrated their
ability to judge the effectiveness of
the organization, and their willing
ness to shake it up if it's not meet
ing their needs. Now that the COP
is attempting a comeback, they
should keep the lesson in mind.
In the words of senate chair
Greg Waldorf, "If we don't have
something substantive by the end
of fall quarter, there'll be hell to
pay."
Indeed there will.
