## Why Stanford is not a great university John Manley 
### 
A GREAT Universi
ty is not measured
by the number of
volumes in its library,
the tuition it can charge,
the size of its endow
ment, the market value
of its degrees, the num
ber of Nobel laureates on
its faculty, the CPAs and
SAT scores of its stu-

dents or opinion surveys of educators.
These are mere quantitative measures; on
all of them, Stanford is a great success.
Vet, on the measure that counts the
most tlie university as an upholder
and teacher of human values — Stanford
is a terrible failure. James B. Conant, late
President of Harvard, said on that uni
versity's tercentenary, "He who enters a
university walks on hallowed ground." I
do not know about Harvard, but 22 years
at Stanford have shown me there is noth
ing hallowed about our ground.
Consider some of the evidence:
• A few years ago, hundreds of Stan
ford students petitioned the Stanford
administration to take a moral stand
against apartheid in South Africa by
divesting from corporations that contin
ued to seek profits there. Stanford's
response: a case-by-case review of corpo
rate policies which ensured that progress
would occur, if at all, at a geological pace.
• Stanford is the only university in the

country with its own migrant farm.
When the evidence of Webb Ranch was
first made public, the president of the
University was quoted as saying that
Stanford has no more responsibility for
the condition of Webb workers than for
Macy's employees who also work on
Stanford land. His successor has taken a
similar position, including rejecting a call
by The Daily to ensure the farm workers
a decent standard of living.
• When principled objections to the
Hoover Institution were made on the
grounds that no self-respecting university
should affiliate with an institution whose
purpose was defined as demonstrating
"the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx,"
the Trustees and two Presidents ignored
the principle involved and assured the
Institution that its connections with
Stanford would be strengthened.
• In keeping with its amoral bent,
Stanford has accepted Coe Endowment
money for a program in American Stud
ies "designed as a positive and affirma
tive method of meeting the threat of
Communism, Socialism, Collectivism,
Totalitarianism and other ideologies
opposed to the preservation of our Sys
tem of Free Enterprise."
• Perhaps worst of all for a university,
demands to discuss such issues are often
stonewalled by the administration. In
1986, the administration did meet in open
forum with members of the Stanford com-

munity. Despite an administration perfor
mance described by The Daily as "mini
mal," calls were made to institutionalize
such forums. None has been held since.
Stanford enjoys a AAA rating from
Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
According to one study, if "Stanford Inc."
were a regular business, it would place
320 th among the Fortune 500. Included
in our multi-billion-dollar assets are a
shopping center, office complex, industri
al park, venture capital operation and
research centers funded by the Defense
Department and leading high-tech corpo
rations. Nestled amid all this is a gojlege,
where moral and humanistic considera
tions are supposed to matter.
Can Stanford change? I doubt it. But if
change is possible a lot will depend on the
students who, fortunately, continue to
arrive at Stanford with their ideals
intact. For them, I can do no better than
quote again from James Conant: "Behav
ior which appears superficially correct
but is intrinsically corrupt always irri
tates those who see below the surface."
Look below the surface of Stanford. You
will not like what you see. But do not look
to the leadership of Stanford for a
change. They are too busy acquiring the
accouterments of success to realize or
care about what has been lost.
