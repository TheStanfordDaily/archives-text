## Ethernet eases information highway traffic Fiber optics link Wilbur dorms, Row houses to computer network 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
With the installation of more than 1,000
in-room computer connections this sum
mer, Stanford is well on its way to creating
a state-of-the-art information highway for
students.
In-room connections to the SUNet were
installed in 13 residences this summer,
including the newly renovated Wilbur Hall
and some Row houses. The newly wired
rooms are also networked with Ethernet, a
faster and more efficient system.
In Wilbur, rooms were linked to the
SUNet with fiber-optic cabling at a cost of
about $160,000. Fiber-optics is a glass-like
material that carries information at light
speed, much faster than the typical copper
wiring.
Other cables supporting the information
highway throughout campus are also being
changed from the older copper wires to
fiber-optics.
These new installations are just another
step in the University's effort to extend
networking services to every room on cam
pus within the next few years according to
Residential Computing Director Jeff Merri
man. By the end of this year, every major
residence will have a cluster connected to
the SUNet.
The University has decided that in-room
connections are now as important to a stu
dent's room as electricity, according to
Sandy Senti, manager of SUNet facilities
and services. There are now more than
6,000 in-room connections throughout the
University.

And as early as 1987, it was reported
that "over 80 percent of all students make
some use of the network in the course of
their studies."
The installation of Ethernst is intended
to prepare the Stanford network to accom
modate more users who have growing
needs, such as the use of multimedia and
other graphically oriented files, according
to Director of Networking and Communi
cation Services William Yundt. Ethernet
should increase network speed and facili
tate large information packages skirting
across the network cables.
Currently on the University network,
there are several switchers — called
routers, repeaters, fast paths, hubs, and
other devices — that slow the network
down. A student logging onto a Roble com
puter from an Otero room could navigate
over several switchers, all slowing down
the transmission and the network.
Although these switchers are necessary,
faster cabling will speed up an information
packet's travel between the devices.
Wire running from the fiber-linked clus
ters to the rooms is usually either phone
wire for Localtalk or twisted pair (lObaseT)
for Ethernet. Ethernet connections run
between University buildings and to the
main backbone on fiber-optic cabling.
Theoretically, a network run on Ether
net cables that have a throughput of 10
megabits per second should clock 44 times
faster than its Localtalk counterpart which
meanders at 230 thousand bits per second.
In reality, however, Ethernet only

increases network speeds four to
five times that of Loral talk and in
rare instances up to 20 times,
according to Mark Rogowsky, infor
mation systems director in the
president's office.
Why the upgrade if the speed
increase isn't visible?
Ethernet has more bandwidth
than Local talk, allowing it to carry
more information. Fiber-optics has
a bandwidth that allows speeds of
100 million bits per second and
even faster depending on the tech

nology driving the network.
More bandwidth, found in Eth
ernet twisted pair and then in fiber
optics, allows a speedier transmis
sion of a 2MB movie or IMB sound
file, things that Stanford students
are sending more often to their
friends across the network. (One
MB equals 8 million bits.)
Ethernet can also run over any
cabling as fast as 10 million bits per
second or faster because of fiber
optic cabling. That's why dorms
with Local talk cabling can't go any
faster than 230 million bits per sec
ond. But it does mean that fiber
optics with a potential of 100 mil
lion bits per second speed can carry
Ethernet.

Rogowsky referred to Ethernet,
which is now the standard for stu
dent rooms, as a 44-lane highway
when compared to Local talk, a ver
itable country road.
However, only one transmission
at a time occurs on Ethernet. With
interruptions bordering on the mil
liseconds, each transmitted file
travels across networks in a stacca
to manner, sharing time on the
cables with other people making
transactions at the same time.
For example, if a student was lis
tening to music over the network, it
would break up every 10 seconds or
so — sounding much like a compact
disc skipping — depending on the
number and intensity of other net

work users.
The increase in speed for the
average computer user switching
from Local talk to Ethernet will be
most evident in opening file servers
across campus and copying files
from other computers, said Merri
man.
Even though Wilbur Hall was
the main project this summer,
some Row houses were also con
nected to SUNet, enabling students
at these residences to register and
send e-mail from their rooms this
year. The Row houses include
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Beta House,
Theta Xi, Roth, and Columbae
(Synergy was hooked up last year).
These houses had cabling con

nected during renovations done
over the past couple of years due to
earthquake damage and deteriora
tion, according to Sandy Senti,
manager of SUNet facilities and
services.
For those students without in
room hook-ups, but with modems,
they can call Networking and Com
munication Services and log onto
one of the 300 modems available for
remote access to the network. The
numbers are 723-8000 or 723-8012.
Director of Networking Raman
Khanna envisions students work
ing on portables on the lawn in
front of Tresidder and logging onto
the network via wireless communi
cations. His office Has already

experimented and come up with
favorable results for radio network
ing.
But before that happens, Khan
na simply said that he wants a typi
cal student to be able to access all
sorts of information "anywhere,
anyplace, anytime."
For example, perhaps a student
could leaf through the on-line card
catalog of the Library of Congress
in the middle of the night from his
or her dorm room.
"The access to global informa
tion and the ability to collaborate
without regard to geographic loca
tion are the main promises of the
information highways being built,"
Khanna said.

ing on portables on the lawn in
front of Tresidder and logging onto
the network via wireless communi
cations. His office Has already

experimented and come up with
favorable results for radio network
ing.
But before that happens, Khan
na simply said that he wants a typi
cal student to be able to access all
sorts of information "anywhere,
anyplace, anytime."
For example, perhaps a student
could leaf through the on-line card
catalog of the Library of Congress
in the middle of the night from his
or her dorm room.
"The access to global informa
tion and the ability to collaborate
without regard to geographic loca
tion are the main promises of the
information highways being built,"
Khanna said.
With the installation of more than 1,000
in-room computer connections this sum
mer, Stanford is well on its way to creating
a state-of-the-art information highway for
students.
In-room connections to the SUNet were
installed in 13 residences this summer,
including the newly renovated Wilbur Hall
and some Row houses. The newly wired
rooms are also networked with Ethernet, a
faster and more efficient system.
In Wilbur, rooms were linked to the
SUNet with fiber-optic cabling at a cost of
about $160,000. Fiber-optics is a glass-like
material that carries information at light
speed, much faster than the typical copper
wiring.
Other cables supporting the information
highway throughout campus are also being
changed from the older copper wires to
fiber-optics.
These new installations are just another
step in the University's effort to extend
networking services to every room on cam
pus within the next few years according to
Residential Computing Director Jeff Merri
man. By the end of this year, every major
residence will have a cluster connected to
the SUNet.
The University has decided that in-room
connections are now as important to a stu
dent's room as electricity, according to
Sandy Senti, manager of SUNet facilities
and services. There are now more than
6,000 in-room connections throughout the
University.

And as early as 1987, it was reported
that "over 80 percent of all students make
some use of the network in the course of
their studies."
The installation of Ethernst is intended
to prepare the Stanford network to accom
modate more users who have growing
needs, such as the use of multimedia and
other graphically oriented files, according
to Director of Networking and Communi
cation Services William Yundt. Ethernet
should increase network speed and facili
tate large information packages skirting
across the network cables.
Currently on the University network,
there are several switchers — called
routers, repeaters, fast paths, hubs, and
other devices — that slow the network
down. A student logging onto a Roble com
puter from an Otero room could navigate
over several switchers, all slowing down
the transmission and the network.
Although these switchers are necessary,
faster cabling will speed up an information
packet's travel between the devices.
Wire running from the fiber-linked clus
ters to the rooms is usually either phone
wire for Localtalk or twisted pair (lObaseT)
for Ethernet. Ethernet connections run
between University buildings and to the
main backbone on fiber-optic cabling.
Theoretically, a network run on Ether
net cables that have a throughput of 10
megabits per second should clock 44 times
faster than its Localtalk counterpart which
meanders at 230 thousand bits per second.
In reality, however, Ethernet only

increases network speeds four to
five times that of Loral talk and in
rare instances up to 20 times,
according to Mark Rogowsky, infor
mation systems director in the
president's office.
Why the upgrade if the speed
increase isn't visible?
Ethernet has more bandwidth
than Local talk, allowing it to carry
more information. Fiber-optics has
a bandwidth that allows speeds of
100 million bits per second and
even faster depending on the tech

nology driving the network.
More bandwidth, found in Eth
ernet twisted pair and then in fiber
optics, allows a speedier transmis
sion of a 2MB movie or IMB sound
file, things that Stanford students
are sending more often to their
friends across the network. (One
MB equals 8 million bits.)
Ethernet can also run over any
cabling as fast as 10 million bits per
second or faster because of fiber
optic cabling. That's why dorms
with Local talk cabling can't go any
faster than 230 million bits per sec
ond. But it does mean that fiber
optics with a potential of 100 mil
lion bits per second speed can carry
Ethernet.

Rogowsky referred to Ethernet,
which is now the standard for stu
dent rooms, as a 44-lane highway
when compared to Local talk, a ver
itable country road.
However, only one transmission
at a time occurs on Ethernet. With
interruptions bordering on the mil
liseconds, each transmitted file
travels across networks in a stacca
to manner, sharing time on the
cables with other people making
transactions at the same time.
For example, if a student was lis
tening to music over the network, it
would break up every 10 seconds or
so — sounding much like a compact
disc skipping — depending on the
number and intensity of other net

work users.
The increase in speed for the
average computer user switching
from Local talk to Ethernet will be
most evident in opening file servers
across campus and copying files
from other computers, said Merri
man.
Even though Wilbur Hall was
the main project this summer,
some Row houses were also con
nected to SUNet, enabling students
at these residences to register and
send e-mail from their rooms this
year. The Row houses include
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Beta House,
Theta Xi, Roth, and Columbae
(Synergy was hooked up last year).
These houses had cabling con

nected during renovations done
over the past couple of years due to
earthquake damage and deteriora
tion, according to Sandy Senti,
manager of SUNet facilities and
services.
For those students without in
room hook-ups, but with modems,
they can call Networking and Com
munication Services and log onto
one of the 300 modems available for
remote access to the network. The
numbers are 723-8000 or 723-8012.
