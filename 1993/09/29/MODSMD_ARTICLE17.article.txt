## Ethernet eases information highway traffic Fiber optics link Wilbur dorms, Row houses to computer network 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
With the installation of more than 1,000
in-room computer connections this sum
mer, Stanford is well on its way to creating
a state-of-the-art information highway for
students.
In-room connections to the SUNet were
installed in 13 residences this summer,
including the newly renovated Wilbur Hall
and some Row houses. The newly wired
rooms are also networked with Ethernet, a
faster and more efficient system.
In Wilbur, rooms were linked to the
SUNet with fiber-optic cabling at a cost of
about $160,000. Fiber-optics is a glass-like
material that carries information at light
speed, much faster than the typical copper
wiring.
Other cables supporting the information
highway throughout campus are also being
changed from the older copper wires to
fiber-optics.
These new installations are just another
step in the University's effort to extend
networking services to every room on cam
pus within the next few years according to
Residential Computing Director Jeff Merri
man. By the end of this year, every major
residence will have a cluster connected to
the SUNet.
The University has decided that in-room
connections are now as important to a stu
dent's room as electricity, according to
Sandy Senti, manager of SUNet facilities
and services. There are now more than
6,000 in-room connections throughout the
University.

And as early as 1987, it was reported
that "over 80 percent of all students make
some use of the network in the course of
their studies."
The installation of Ethernst is intended
to prepare the Stanford network to accom
modate more users who have growing
needs, such as the use of multimedia and
other graphically oriented files, according
to Director of Networking and Communi
cation Services William Yundt. Ethernet
should increase network speed and facili
tate large information packages skirting
across the network cables.
Currently on the University network,
there are several switchers — called
routers, repeaters, fast paths, hubs, and
other devices — that slow the network
down. A student logging onto a Roble com
puter from an Otero room could navigate
over several switchers, all slowing down
the transmission and the network.
Although these switchers are necessary,
faster cabling will speed up an information
packet's travel between the devices.
Wire running from the fiber-linked clus
ters to the rooms is usually either phone
wire for Localtalk or twisted pair (lObaseT)
for Ethernet. Ethernet connections run
between University buildings and to the
main backbone on fiber-optic cabling.
Theoretically, a network run on Ether
net cables that have a throughput of 10
megabits per second should clock 44 times
faster than its Localtalk counterpart which
meanders at 230 thousand bits per second.
In reality, however, Ethernet only
