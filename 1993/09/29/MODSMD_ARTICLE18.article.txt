# Networked rooms standard at Dartmouth, new at MIT

At Dartmouth College, known for
requiring every student to own a com
puter, students often tell each other to
"Blitz me" instead of "call me."
Blitz? The e-mail system at Dart
mouth, called Blitz Mail, is so widely
used that "Blitzing" someone there has
nothing to do with football.
Dartmouth's information highway
resembles Stanford's in that it also has
fiber-optic cabling running between
buildings and Ethernet and Localtalk
running into individual rooms. But
Dartmouth's main software program,
Blitz Mail, includes more functions than
Stanford's newest e-mail program Mail
strom (not to be confused with the
game).
A Dartmouth student has easy access
to bulletin boards and, three out of four
times, turns in a paper over the net

work.
Blitz Mail has an "enclose" function
that allows students to mail anything,
not just text files, to other students, said
Malcolm Brown, director of academic
computing at Dartmouth.
Most Dartmouth students have
Localtalk, so some Stanford students
have faster in-room connections than
their Big Green counterparts. Every
student at Dartmouth has an in-room
connection, although Stanford has more
total connections, with over 6,000.
At Harvard University, only fresh
men in the Yard have in-room Ethernet
connections to the computer network.
Non-connected students rely on clus
ters and also have the option to call in to
the main network by modem.
At the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, there are plans this year to
put in-room Ethernet connections into
every student's room by the end of this
upcoming year.
