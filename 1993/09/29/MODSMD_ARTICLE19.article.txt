# Theory of evolution doesn't account for sloppy eaters
## Tresidder defies Darwinism

Q: IjOts of the birds that hang out at Tresidder
seem to have wounded (or mutated) feet and
wings. Is this due to radiation from SIAC, some
pesticide in the environment, or what?
— The Lorax
A: The probable cause of abnormal bird mor
phology at Tresidder Union is much less sinister
than the aforementioned environmental insults. To
the contrary, injured avians may be abundant near

our beloved student union because
we humans have made life too easy
on them.
Take the example of the purple
martin, Violet-sheened member of
the swallow family and conspicu
ous local pest. An extremely unsci
entific survey of purple martins at
Tresidder (conducted by Yours
Truly over a pint or five of delicious
Coffee House ale) indicates that as
many as 20 percent of birds forag
ing in the area bear evidence of
gross injury to the wing, beak or
claw.

A concerned lover of nature might reasonably
wonder how one in five martins has managed to sus
tain such wounds. Since these birds live and scav
enge in a region heavily populated by humans, it is
reasonable to guess that some human interaction
with the environment has caused them to be, in the
words of a dead English poet, "thus abused."
But soft — what objection to this hypothesis
through yonder window breaks? Simply this: The
risk factors of living near humans — power lines, bay
windows, tasty-looking cigarette butts — all exist in
the suburbs, where another unscientific survey (per
formed, I assure you, under the same circumstances
as the first) has established that a substantially
smaller fraction of martins is visibly ii\jured.
It is indeed human influence that is responsible
for this difference, but it's not in the direction of

greater injury rates near Tresidder. Rather, the
walking wounded prevail near the CoHo because
they're not dying off the way nature intended them
to.
Many theories of population biology invoke the
concept of a "carrying capacity" — essentially, the
equilibrium population of a species in a given envi
ronment. The carrying capacity is largely dependent
on resources available for use by that species — e.g.,
food and shelter — and also on variables like tem
perature and rainfall.
Below the carrying capacity, resources are plenti
ful and the population grows. Above this limiting
population density, death rates — due to competition
with members of the same species, predation, and

overcrowding — rise, and the pop
ulation shrinks.
The culling of excess
members of the species usually
occurs via deaths among the weak
and injured animals in the popula
tion. A martin that is missing a
foot, or that can't fly< is less able to
compete for scarce resources than
its fitter fellows, and is eliminated.
Now let's do a little
thought experiment: Suppose we
artificially increase the food sup
ply, and hence the carrying

capacity. Accidental injury rates
will stay about the same, but starvation death rates
among injured animals will plummet. Hence, you
will no longer see only the fittest, but also the tired,
the p<x)r, the huddled masses, yearning to eat free.
Speaking simplistically, purple martins in the
vicinity of this building have attained the mythical
free lunch: plentiful shelter, no predation, and boun
ties of potato chips accessible to even the toughest
luck cases.
We're not doing anything to hurt the birds — if
anything, we're standing in the way of selection pres
sures against the iryured by making life easy on the
sick and wounded.
Like, um, Florence Nightingale. Heh.
