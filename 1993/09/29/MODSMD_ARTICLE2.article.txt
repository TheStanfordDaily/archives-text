# Taco Bell makes run for Tresidder Union
## Bon Appetit to operate franchise; could open by winter quarter 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Stanford students soon won't need a car
to make a run for the border — unless they
want, say, a Nacho Supreme.
Taco Bell and Bon Appetit — the San
Francisco-based company that runs food op
erations at Tresidder Union — signed a li
censing agreement last week that would per
mit a small Taco Bell franchise to open in
Tresidder, according to Mary Clark, Bon Ap
petit's general manager.
The franchise would be owned and oper
ated by Bon Appetit, employing three people
per shift, Clark said.
The one caveat, however, is that the
restaurant will only sell six food items: tacos,
soft tacos, Taco Supremes, bean burritos,
Combo Burritos and Burrito Supremes.
If everything goes smoothly, students
could see a Taco Bell in Tresidder as early as
winter quarter.
The only stumbling block may be Santa
Clara County, which must issue a construc
tion permit before Bon Appetit can renovate
the space for the new franchise. Bon Appetit
has not formally filed the permit request be
cause Taco Bell has not supplied the con
struction specifications for the restaurant.
"We hope it fills a niche and doesn't drive
anyone away" from other Bon Appetit fran
chises in Tresidder, Clark said. "I think this
will make a lot of students happy."

The restaurant will be open until 1 or 2
a.m., later than all other Tresidder food out
lets. It will open for lunch at 11 a.m.
The Taco Bell franchise will be located in
part of the recreation center on the ground
level of Tresidder, according to Clark.
Tresidder will pay for the necessary renova
tions.
The food basics, such as the ground meat
for tacos, will be cooked in Bon Appetit's
main kitchen and carried to the restaurant,
where items will be prepared to order.
Clark said the plan materialized largely
through the efforts of Tresidder Director
Bobbi Braden and Assoc. Director Paul
Szczesiul. Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds approved the
plan.
Although there have been discussions be
tween Taco Bell and Bon Appetit for about a
year, Szczesiul said the current situation
does not represent a breakthrough, but
rather another step in a slow process of
bringing Taco Bell to Tresidder.
"We know students want this," Szczesiul
said, noting that several ASSU senators in
cluded "Taco Bell in Tresidder" planks on
their platforms last year.
Other than the election promises, the
ASSU has not been directly involved in
bringing Taco Bell to Tresidder, Szczesiul
said.
He added that Food Service is
aware of the contract but has
expressed no opposition to the
plan.
He does not anticipate any
adverse effect on Food Service.
"Most people are tied into their
meal plans."
Though the franchise license at
Stanford would be unique, prices
would be "substantially the same"
as those at regular Taco Bell fran
chises.
As with other Bon Appetit out
lets, the restaurant would accept
Tresidder dollars. Bon Appetit
could begin hiring student
employees as early as Dec. 1.
