# Taboo diseases chlamydia, warts no strangers to Stanford sex life

### Delia Garigan 
Take a look in your wallet. Is
there a condom inside?
It may be bit optimistic on
your part.
But as a well-educated Stan
ford student, you know that
condoms are the most effective
way to protect against pregnan
cy and sexually-transmitted dis
eases (STDs).
If anything happens, you
want to be prepared. Right?
Increasingly though, the evi

dence shows that college
students aren't pre
pared.
According to a recent
study released by the
American Association of
Social Health, two
thirds of the 12 million
new cases of sexually
transmitted infections
each year are among
people under 25.
Stanford students
are no exception to the
national trend, accord
ing to Jane Schupay, a

nurse practitioner at Cowell
Student Health Center.
I)r. John Dorman, a physi
cian at Cowell, noted that
although Stanford students are
well educated in STD preven
tion, many have multiple sex
partners or do not use a con
dom, putting them at high risk
for contracting an STD.
"What students know and
what they do are two different
things," Dorman said.
Schupay echoed his concern,
"Forty-eight percent of Stan
ford freshmen in a 1990 study
did not use contraception, peri
od."

The three STDs Cowell staff
members encounter most fre
quently are chlamydia, herpes,
and human papilloma virus
(HPV), which causes genital
warts.
Schupay said HPV in particu
lar has reached epidemic pro
portions among Stanford stu
dents: "I see it at least once a
week," she noted.
So how do you know if you
have an STD?
Often, you can't tell.
While these viral infections

STD: Symptoms:
chlamydia Mild mucous dis
charge;stinging when
urinating
HPV infection Painless growths
(genital warts) around genitals
genital herpes Sores around gerntaJs
or anus; often with bfeters

can be controlled by medication,
they may never be eliminated
from the body.
"Viral lesions and recur
rences are more prevalent dur
ing periods of stress," Schupay
said, because the patient's
immune system is weakened.
HPV is very contagious, even
if no genital warts are visible.
Herpes, known for being
transmitted through its sores,
is also transmissible immediate
ly before the sores appear.
Herpes and HPV (warts) are
spread by viruses that penetrate
the delicate mucous membranes
of the genital areas during vagi-

nal or anal intercourse.
In addition, herpes can be
transmitted between the mouth
and the genitals during oral sex.
HPV may never manifest
itself as warts, but if a woman
has it, she runs greater risk of
getting cervical cancer. While
men are in less danger, they can
unknowingly give it to their
partners.
Although herpes has fewer
long-term effects, its painful
sores cause more discomfort
than warts.

Herpes has also been
linked to cervical cancer
in women.
Chlamydia is a bacterial
infection that is also
spread through sexual
intercourse.
Bacteria flourish in the
male urethra and the
female reproductive
tract, eventually result
ing in infection.
A case of chlamydia can
sometimes lead to infer
tility.

When used correctly,
condoms are helpful in prevent
ing chlamydia, and they may
protect against HPV and herpes
if lesions are confined to the
shaft of the penis or the vaginal
tract.
Men, as well as women,
should consider yearly checkups
especially because they "are not
seen routinely the way women
are," said Schupay.
Schupay recommends that
men get annual exams and
receive the same information
that women customarily obtain.
