## Stanford's Laster a water polo star in any language 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Sophomore Jeremy Laster has seen the
world. He has visited such famous cities as
London, Cairo, Prague and Budapest. How
ever, Laster did not spend his time in these
locales viewing magnificent sites and touring
beautiful museums.
Laster spent his most of his time in the
pools of these renowned cities.
With six years of water polo experience
under his belt, Laster has accumulated an
impressive list of accomplishments. His
career began when his father and uncle, both
former water polo players, got him interested
in joining a swim team in the eighth grade.
He oegan playing water polo a year later, and
quickly became one of the premier high
school players in the nation.
As a senior, Laster was named California
Interscholastic Federation 4A Player of the
Year after leading San Clemente High School
to the 4A title. A first-team All-American,
Laster chose to attend Stanford over UCLA,
Pepperdine and Harvard.
"Stanford is a great school, and the water
polo program had a lot of young up-and-com
ing players," Laster said. "It was hard for me
to pass up that combination."
Laster joined the US Water Polo National
Team program after his sophomore season of
high school, when he was named to the
National Youth Team. The following year,
whilt- in Canada with the youth team, Laster
was approached by National Junior Team
coach Ricardo Azevedo and shortly thereafter
was promoted to his squad.
In 1991, Laster joined Stanford goal
tender Larry Bercutt for the Junior World
Championships in Southern California.
Laster was the only high-school athlete on
the team.
"Being the youngest is good for me; I learn
a lot from the older players who have lots of
international experience," Laster said.

"Sometimes I have to carry all the equip
ment, which is a drag, but it's worth it."
Last December, Laster began training
with the National Senior Team and traveled
to Cuba for training camp in February. Since
then, he has participated in the Control Cup
tournament in Hungary and the Aiamo Cup
in California. He was also invited to go to
Russia in April for the FINA Cup, water
polo's second-most-important championship,
next to the Olympic Games.
Stanford head coach Dante Dettamanti
has found many uses for Laster's interna
tional experience.
"His participation on the national team
helps our team, experience-wise." Dettaman
ti said. "But we use Jeremy in different ways
than the national team does. We want him to
have control on offense. Jeremy came here
with a tendency to shoot from all areas of the
pool. The national team wants him shooting
more."
"It is a different style of play," Laster
agreed. "The players are bigger (in interna
tional competition) so there isn't as much
driving. The style is more pass and shoot.
Stanford plays a much faster game."
Dettamanti has also been training Laster
to play at both the holeman position and the
hole defense position. The holeman, compa
rable to a center in basketball, controls the
inside game and usually is situated directly in
front of the goal. The position requires excep
tional size and strength.
"I couldn't believe a player of his size (6-5,
200 pounds) wasn't used in the hole at all in
high school," Dettamanti said. "We're using
him now for hole defense. He's always been a
good defender, [using hisl long arms to make
lots of steals. He's learning the position."
Through water polo, Laster has traveled
throughout North America and to Cuba,
England, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Ger
many, Italy, Austria and, most recently,

UCLA Laster was spectacular, smothering the Bruin's All-American candidate Chris Kellerman.
