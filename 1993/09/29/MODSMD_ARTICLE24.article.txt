# Looking for revenge
## Irish come to Farm with No. 4 ranking 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A mere week ago, the Stanford
football team was ranked in the
top 25 in the national polls, had a
winning record and was in a state
of euphoria after beating then-
No. 8 Colorado before a national
television audience.
Now, after dropping a 28-25
decision to unranked Pacific 10
Conference foe UCLA last Satur
day, the Cardinal (2-2) finds itself
out of the national rankings and,
with two league losses, at a decid
ed disadvantage in the Rose Bowl
race.
All this, and Notre Dame too.
The undefeated Fighting Irish
will venture to Stanford Stadium
on Saturday afternoon with
national championship hopes in
tow and a score to settle.
Notre Dame (4-0) has won 11
consecutive games, dating back
to last season. Their last loss was
Oct. 3, 1992, when Stanford
administered a 33-16 beating at
Notre Dame Stadium.
"They've given a lot of time to
defensing Stanford," said Cardi
nal head coach Bill Walsh. "Let's
face it — they've been working on
us for a long time."
Not as if Notre Dame has been
taking it easy the past few weeks.
The Irish have faced four Big 10
Conference squads to start the sea
son — including No. 3 Michigan.
And yet despite their record,
Irish head coach Lou Holtz char
acteristically continues to down
play his team's ability.
"We just aren't a good offen
sive football team at the present
time," Holtz said. "Whether you

talk about running power or the
option or throwing the ball, there
just aren't many segments of our
offense we can rely on on a con
sistent basis."
Holtz's concerns may be eased
on Saturday. The young Cardinal
defense ranks last in the Pac-]0
in total defense, and is yielding a
league-worst 265 yards per game
to opposing rushers.
Walsh thinks that he, rath2r
than Holtz, is the one who should
be concerned.
"If we can force them to punt
at least three or four times, we'll
be OK, because we're not going to
completely stop them," Walsh
said. "If we can hold Notre Dame
to 450 total yards, we're probably
doing a good job.
Notre Dame quarterback
Kevin McDougal could pose prob
lems for Stanford, as he is equal
ly comfortable throwing or run
ning the football.
But for Stanford, the goal on
Saturday will be to keep the Irish
offense on the sidelines.
"We need to get going on the
first drive and establish our
offense," said Stanford offensive
tackle Jeff Buckey. "We need to
control the ball better to keep our
defense off the field."
That goal will hinge on Stan
ford's ability to establish a run
ning game to mix with its potent
passing attack.
The imbalance in Stanford's
offensive attack is nowhere more
apparent than in the Pac-10
offensive statistics, where as a
team the Cardinal ranks first in
passing and last in rushing.
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom
continues to be among the best
at his position in the country.
Last week marked the third con
secutive game in which the
senior signalcaller passed for
more than 300 yards. A year ago,
Stenstrom passed for 215 yards
and two touchdowns against the
Irish.
"I remember meeting Steve
Stenstrom at a banquet where he
was being honored when he was a
senior in high school, and I
remember him telling me he was
going to Stanford," Holtz said. "1
told him, 'That's great — I'll look
forward to following your career.'
1 never imagined that I'd be fol
lowing it this closely."
The so-called "Notre Dame
mystique," while intimidating to
many teams, does not instill the
same fear in the Cardinal, who
have bettered the Irish two of the
past throe years.
"We're improving every week,
although we botched the last one
with turnovers," Walsh said.
"Notre Dame stands for a lot. 1
look forward to this contest."
