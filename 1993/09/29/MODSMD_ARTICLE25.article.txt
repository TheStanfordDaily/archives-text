# Spikers squash Spartans in straight sets
## Stanford wins behind dominating net play of Triefenbach, Wendell 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The No. 4 Stanford women's
volleyball team (8-2, 2-2 in the
Pacific Ten Conference) swept
unranked San Jose State (7-6,
3-2 in the Big West Conference)
last night underneath the red
and white of the Cardinal's
newly unfurled 1992 National
Championship banner.
Although San Jose managed
to unnerve the Stanford defense
for a stretch in the third game,
the Cardinal overpowered the
Spartans in the lopsided 15-7,
15-10, 15-13 match.
"I saw good and bad
moments from the players,"
said coach Don Shaw.
"The match was a bit
streaky, but we were able to
focus in when we really needed
to."
San Jose was able to keep
pace with the Cardinal for the
first half of game one. With
freshman outside hitter Colleen
Miniuk starting in place of
Wendy Hromadka, the Spartans
contained the Stanford offense
and kept the score at an even 6-
6.
The Cardinal returned from
a time-out with five straight
points, hitting over the heads of
the Spartan's small middle
blockers. Sophomore Marnie
Triefenbach's lethal left-side
smash overwhelmed the Spar
tan defense and Stanford hand
ily finished the game with a
.256 hitting percentage to San
Jose State's .132.
While Stanford was called for
four net violations at the outset
of the second game, the hitting
combination of sophomores
Cary Wendell and Maureen
McLaren redeemed the Cardi
nal offense, hitting a total of 28
kills in the match.
Furthermore, Triefenbach
led the Stanford defensive
effort with a solo block for a 6-2
Cardinal lead. Freshman hitter
Eileen Murfee then entered the
game to jump for three blocks
on her first play.
Using Stanford's advantage
as an opportunity to try differ
ent combinations of players,

Shaw proceeded to place three
freshmen on the court with the
substitution of freshman hitter
Nikki Otto.
"The bench really came
through for us tonight," Shaw
said. "Our strength there is an
important factor."
Shaw continued experiment
ing with the lineup in the third
game with the entrance of
freshman setter Catherine Juil
lard.
The Cardinal's lack of experi
ence playing as a team started
to show when it allowed the
Spartans to pull ahead for the
first time in the match. San
Jose seized the opportunity pro
vided by the Cardinal's inexpe
rience and racked up five con
secutive points to build a 12-6
lead.
Wendell finally ended the
run with a string of kills, all set
by senior Piper Hahn. Junior
Denise Rotert entered the
match at outside hitter to pro
vide support in the back court;
for the match, she would come
up with seven digs.
Triefenbach then blasted two
shots across the net to bring the
score to an even 13-13. Stan
ford stayed ahead for the rest of
the night, with Wendell serving
for the victory.
While the Cardinal offense
clearly dominated the second
game, with a .188 hitting per
centage to San Jose's .094, the
two teams hit an even .154 in
the third game.
"We tried out new lineups to
use later," McLaren said.
"We're really trying to work on
our attitude on the court —
being aware of what's going on
and staying at a constant men
tal level."
For the match, McLaren and
Wendell led the squad's offense
with .444 and .480 percentages,
respectively. Wendell further
helped the Cardinal with 12
sets and eight digs. Rotert and
Otto ended their second match
es of the season hitting .400 and
.333, respectively, while Murfee
finished her second outing with
seven kills.
It was ultimately Triefen
bach's night to shine on both

offense and defense, however.
She swung for a match-high 15
kills, then backed up her
onslaught with 19 digs. Junior
Anne Wicks also bolstered the
Cardinal backcourt with 11
digs.
"We served very well and
really put them on defense,"
Wendell said. "I think our pass
ing and blocking could have
been better though."
While Stanford's attacks
showed some signs of weakness,
the Spartan offense came up

short in comparison. Sopho
more outside hitter Crista Koch
came up with the team-high 13
kills, but a total of seven errors
lowered her hitting percentage
to .150. San Jose's second
power hitter, senior Erin Gin
ney, pounded down 11 kills.
"We're feeling more and
more confident with each
game," Wendell said. "It's nice
to know we have fight left in us
in the end. Each time we play
together, we see more and more
potential."

night, along with seven kills.
