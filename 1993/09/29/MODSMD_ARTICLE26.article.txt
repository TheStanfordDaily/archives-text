# Cardinal athletics enjoy prosperous summer
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
With the flood of enthusiastic new frosh and
the foot-dragging return of upperclassmen,
Stanford has once again come to life, leaving
behind the dull days of summer.
However, despite Stanford's summertime
doldrums, the campus was a hotbed of sports
related activity.
First, on June 19 the United States women's
basketball team, coached by the Cardinal's Tara
VanDerveer, squared off against a male Bay
Area all-star team in Maples Pavilion.

While the men, coached by Golden State head
coach Don Nelson, soundly beat Team USA, the
sen mm ape provided the warm-up the women
needed for the upcoming Tournament of the
Americas. In this competition, Team USA fin
ished in the top four, thereby qualifying for the
World Championship later this year.
Early preparat ion was also key in the renova
tion work performed on Stanford Stadium in
order to prepare the venue for the six World Cup
games to be held there next summer The facelift
included such projects as recovering seats,
expanding the press box and resodding the turf.

Herrington began to organize the security
efforts for the biggest single sporting event in the
world. Several arms of the federal government
will be involved as the FBI and the Department
of Defense will provide communication equip
ment and information-gathering services for the
three-week multi-game extravaganza
"It's never been held here and we've never
seen anything like this, so we can't take a
chance," Herrington said. "None of us want any
problems."
However, stadium preparations for the World
Cup didn't prevent a preseason
exhibition game between the San
Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles
Raiders.
In this matchup, the 49ers
destroyed the Raiders, 27-0, with
the help of two interceptions by for
mer Stanford cornerback Alan
Grant.
Kim Oden was another ex-Cardi
nal who returned to her former
playground. Oden recently retired
from the United States women's
volleyball team and accepted an
assistant coaching job for the Cardi
nal, hoping to teach another genera
tion of spikers the skills which made
her a dominant threat for Stanford.
While former stars came back to
Stanford, the University's current
athletes traveled abroad. Several
Cardinal swimmers made a splash
at the international Pan-Pacific
Championships in Kobe, Japan,
Aug. 12-15.
Junior Jenny Thompson flaunt
ed her speed and versatility at the
Pan-Pacs, netting six gold medals in
three individual events and three
relays. Perhaps most impressive for
a swimmer known more for her
freestyle sprinting abilities was her
victory in the 100-meter butterfly.
Thompson clocked in at 59.33, a
personal best and one of the 10
fastest times in history. And that
was in a performance marred by a
mis-timed finish.
"I think I could have broken 59
(seconds) if I hadn't jammed the fin
ish," said Thompson, who bruised
her fingers when she hit the wall in

mid-stroke.
Thompson's Stanford and
Olympic teammate, Lea Loveless,
was the only other Cardinal to
strike gold in the Pan-Pact, taking
the 100-meter backstroke.
While representatives of the
Stanford men's swimming team did
not fare as well in Japan as the
women, several excelled at the U.S.
Long Course Nationals in late July.
Sophomore Joe Hudepohl, a 1992
Olympian, captured the 200 free
title while Tyler Mayfield surprised
the field in the 100 breaststroke. The
senior nipped several top contenders
in a blanket finish and clocked a time
of 1:02.31, the 10th fastest time in
American history.
"Getting up there and being
compared to the 10 best swimmers
in American history is flabbergast
ing," said the senior from Las
Vegas. "I still look at myself as a
local chump."
As Mayfield was opening some
eyes at senior nationals, other less
amphibious Cardinal athletes were
battling for gold at the World Uni
versity Games in Buffalo.
First, 1992 graduate and NCAA
champion sprinter Chryste Gaines
anchored the U.S. women's 4xloo
relay team, which sped to a first
place finish in 43.37 seconds.
Furthermore, 1993 Stanford
graduate Bev Oden and sophomore
Cary Wendell led the women's vol
leyball squad to a silver medal, while
senior setter Canyon Ceman took
ninth place as part of the men's vol
leyball team.
Finally, senior Sarah Rafanelli
and 1993 graduate Julie Foudy had
to settle for a silver med;d £5 the
women's soccer team was upset by
China in the final, 2-1.
