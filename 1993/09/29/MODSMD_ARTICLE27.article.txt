# Ceremony to honor WWII relocation camp internees
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Fifty-one years ago, the federal gov
ernment abruptly relocated 24 Stanford
students to WWII minority internment
camps, some of them a scant two weeks
before graduation.
Those students, all of Japanese
ancestry, left the campus unwillingly,
their future clouded with doubt. Of
them, a few received their degrees,
but others never returned to Stan
ford.
Tomorrow, nine of the former
internees will return to be honored in a
ceremony hosted by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper. They will be
awarded medallions in recognition of
their bravery during the war. The honor
comes amid a spirit of renewed student

interest and sentiment.
"This (the awarding of the medals) is
not to say Stanford is guilty," said Elisa
Kamigaki, a coordinator of the Japanese
American Alumni Reunion. "After all,
they're not the ones that sent them to
the camps.
"This ceremony is to honor the
internees, and it's meant to educate the
community," she said.
The ceremony will be the highlight
of the three-day Japanese American
Alumni Reunion, to be held from
tomorrow through Saturday. Panel
discussions, a presentation of rele
vant documents at the Hoover
Archives, as well as the recognition
ceremony and the rededication of
Okada House are open to the entire
Stanford campus.
Stanford University Nikkei, a

Japanese-American student group,
raised more than $10,000 in donations
for the event from a number of sources,
including the Asian-American Activities
Center, the Asian Languages Depart
ment, the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the History Department, Bechtel
International Center and private philan
thropists such as Board of Trustees
member Peter Bing.
The idea of holding a reunion was
first sparked in History Prof. Gordon
Chang's Asian-American studies class
last winter, according to Kamigaki.
"It had sort of a chain effect," Kami
gaki said. "After Gordon's students, the
Asian-American Activities Center got
involved and [Nikkei) too."
Kamigaki also said that Nikkei
members became pen pals with some of
the alumni in order to provide the

alumni with current personal contacts
at Stanford.
"Interested INikkei] members were
assigned alumni and called them over
the summer to keep in touch. It gave
them a buddy communication system,
and some members even went to visit
their alumni," she added.
The reunion kicks off tomorrow
night with a film presentation and
panel discussion featuring Chang and
former internee Sue Tokushige, who
has spoken to many groups about her
experiences. "We really hope that
everybody will come to this," Kamigaki
said. "But all the events are all-cam
pus."
The internees will have a private pre
view of an exhibit of documents related
to Stanford's involvement with the
Japanese-American internment on Fri

day at noon, which will be followed by a
closed reception for the internees. The
exhibit will then officially be on display
from Oct. 18 to Dec. 8.
A Law School panel discussion on the
constitutional aspects of the internment
will be hosted by Dean Paul Brest at
2:15 p.m.
At 3:15 p.m. Friday, there will be a
rededication of Okada House and a lay
ing of the Memorial Plaque dedicated to
Japanese-American Alumni.
The recognition ceremony, held at
Campbell Recital Hall, will begin at 7
p.m. Friday and will be followed by a
reception.
The weekend reunion will conclude
Saturday morning with a brunch
attended by Nikkei and invited faculty
and staff at the Asian-American Activi
ties Center Ballroom.
