# Homecoming weekend to court alums
## University hopes four-day reunion encourages donations 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Current Stanford students are not the only
ones going back to school this week.
Beginning tomorrow, as many as 5,000 Stan
ford alumni are expected to descend on campus
to participate in a four-day homecoming week
end that will include parades, a roundtable dis
cussion led by several prominent faculty mem
bers, and "Classes without Quizzes."
Sponsored by the Alumni Association and
the development office, the event is both a
response to positive alumni reaction to the Cen
tennial celebration and the University's desire
to increase alumni donations.
Although class reunions are an annual event,
this is the first time the University has ever had
a homecoming celebration of this magnitude.
While some of the programs are designed pri
marily for members of those classes with
reunions scheduled for 1993, Stanford alumni
from all years are invited to take part in the fes
tivities.
"The mission statement of the Alumni Asso
ciation is 'reach out, serve and engage.' We want
to have more alumni involved by a stronger
homecoming aspect to our reunions, as most
other schools do," said D.J. Dull, assistant direc
tor of classes for the Alumni Association.

Though planning for a larger reunion event
has been in the works for a long time, this year's
homecoming is largely based on positive feed
back from alumni following the 1991 Centenni
al celebration, Dull said.
"We heard from alumni how nice it was to
come back for a weekend that had all the aca
demics and parties," said Lucy Kohlmeier, asso
ciate director of reunion-giving for the Develop
ment Office. She added that the weekend will
set a precedent for reunions in future years.
In addition to better catering to alumni
needs, both the Development Office and the
Alumni Association hope that a larger celebra
tion will inspire increased alumni donations.
While 23 percent to 25 percent of Stanford
alumni give money in reunion years, other
schools with more traditional homecoming
reunions receive gifts from an average of 40
percent to 60 percent of their returning alum
ni.
Quite simply, said Kohlmeier, "positive
involvement creates goodwill, and this trans
lates into gifts."
Since most of Stanford's donations come
from a small, focused group of donors, Dull said
the school hopes the reunion will increase the
number of givers across the economic spectrum.
"We're not concerned about how much people
give, but just that we get the concept of giving

into their heads — that we get people into the
habit of both coming back to the University and
giving to it,"he said.
In order to make the weekend more of an
inclusive celebration, many of this year's events
will reunite members of student groups such as
freshman dorms or sports teams, rather than
separating alumni by the year of their gradua
tion. According to Dull, this change follows sev
eral alumni surveys showing that "people's
affinities are to the University in general, not
just to their classes."
The surveys showed that alumni enjoyed
revisiting academic life at Stanford as well, Dull
said. In response, there will be 77 different
"Classes without Quizzes" taught by current
Stanford faculty members. Alumni will also be
able to attend open houses, parties and speech
es, as well as the traditional alumni tailgate par
ties before the football game against Notre
Dame.
Several of this weekend's events are also
open to students. Highlights include a
roundtable forum at 9 a.m. in Frost
Amphitheater on Friday titled "Who's
Responsible for America?", a dance in the
Inner Quad Saturday at 8 p.m., and an
address by Distinguished Hoover Fellow and
former Secretary of State George Shultz Sun
day at 10 a.m. in Frost.
