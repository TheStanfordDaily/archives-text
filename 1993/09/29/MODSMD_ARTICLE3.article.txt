# Plans to refocus OMD receive positive reviews

### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
Response from faculty and staff mem
bers to recent changes in the focus of the
Office of Multicultural Development has
been generally positive, despite some reser
vations that student concerns may be ig
nored by the restructured office.
The University Cabinet decided to nar
row the scope of the multicultural office
after the Ad Hoc Committee on the Office
of Multicultural Development — commis
sioned by University President Gerhard
Casper in May — issued its report last
week.
Supporting the committee's recommen
dations, several administrators said the
cabinet's decision to redirect the office's
focus is a necessary move if the University
is to increase its hiring and retention of mi
nority faculty. According to University
data, the percentage of minority staff mem
bers has remained constant in recent years.
The move essentially returns the Office
of Multicultural Development to an affir
mative action agency, which is the role it
originally played in the 19705.
That was "the period of the greatest mi
nority recruitment in the history of the
University," said Cecilia Burciaga, associ
ate vice provost for student affairs.

The accomplishments of that period are
"the precedent to meet," said Humanities
and Sciences Assoc. Dean Albert Camarillo,
the committee's chair.
For example, Camarillo said the com
mittee recommended that the University
have one office focus on affirmative action
and also have a vice provost for faculty af
firmative action — two areas that were
eliminated as the multicultural office
changed over the years. With the restruc
turing, it is hoped minority hiring will in
crease.
However, sophomore Vanessa Alvarado,
an ASSU senator and an active member of
the Chicano /Latino community, said she
some reservations about the changes.
"I'm glad that they're going to focus on
faculty and staff," she said. "But I don't
think that's the whole picture.
"I'm afraid they're going to ignore the
student part of multiculturalism," she said.
"They have to realize that faculty and staff
deal with students."
Hut Andrew Lisac, resident fellow of
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, said he believes that
the issues the office will no longer deal with
can be addressed by the different ethnic
communities.
"We can take care of those on our own,"
he said.
Burciaga, a former afTirmative
action coordinator, said Stanford's
affirmative action policy has lost
its focus over the past few years.
However, she said she hoped
the restructuring means a true
commitment to multiculturalism,
and that the new office would not
merely become a government
compliance office.
Judith Little, interim director
of the Office of Multicultural

Development, said she felt confi
dent that her office would not be
hindered by the narrowed focus.
"I don't think it's a limiting rec
ommendation," she said. "One of
the things that became apparent
[to the committee] was that there
was a lack of focus in the office."
Camarillo said it was under
former director Sharon Parker
that the office began to lose focus.
Under Parker, the Affirmative
Action Office was renamed the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, and affirmative action
became only one in a handful of
priorities. Staff affirmative action
sometimes took a backseat to

other issues, Camarillo said.
For example, Parker chaired an
ad hoc committee in the Depart
ment of Athletics that examined
sex-equity issues in 1990. In addi
tion, in November 1991, she dis
banded the Affirmative Action
Council — a group of representa
tives from various vice-presiden
tial and staff areas who discussed
issues and policies that addressed
staff affirmative-action matters.
"Sharon Parker brought some
additional programming objec
tives that weren't formally
approved," he said. "The historic
functions of the office were de
emphasized."
