# Reorganization to offer improved, cost-efficient patient care
## Health reform hits Medical Center 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
President Clinton isn't the only one
changing a health care system.
In an effort to be more cost-efficient
and provide better patient care, the
Medical Center is also moving toward a
new system by changing its structure,
integrating some of the services it of
fers and trying to be more open to out
side doctors.
The reorganization, which grew out
of a task force created in January by
University President Gerhard Casper,
will create a not-for-profit corporation
called Stanford Health System, Inc.
that will oversee the medical care pro
vided at Stanford Hospital and coordi
nate the clinical work of hospital physi
cians, School of Medicine faculty and

local community.
The new corporation will also over
see health care contracts and insurance
offerings, as well as general adminis
trative tasks.
The Children's Hospital and Med
ical School will not be controlled by the
new corporation, but rather, the
groups will work together through a se
ries of agreements.
A new group called the Medical Cen
ter Liaison Committee will work on is
sues that affect the center as a whole,
such as major building projects and
land development.
The reorganization is intended to
make the Medical Center's care more
accessible and easier to use for pa
tients, while maintaining its strong
academics, according to the recommen
dations issued by Casper's task force.

In addition, the recommendations
aim to bolster the Medical Center's
revenue — the report says some of the
center's sources of income have be
come "problematic" — by increasing
the amount and efficiency of clinical
care.
The overall plan for the reorganiza
tion was created over the summer.
Now six different work groups are fill
ing in the details of the master plan,
and everything seems to be moving
along, said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost
for institutional planning and a mem
ber of Casper's task force.
The work groups are performing
"very, very well," Cox said. "They're all
working very hard — most of them are
meeting almost weekly."
The work groups should have
planned out the details for their
individual areas by late October,
and the plan will then go back to
the task force, which will synthe
size the parts to meet its goal of
having a complete plan ready by
about the end of the year.
After the plan returns to
Casper's task force, Cox said the
University's Board of Trustees
and the Hospital's Board of Direc
tors would review the plan.
Currently, the report says, the
Medical Center tends to be "an
expensive provider of routine
medical care."
Stanford, like most medical

schools nationwide, has "become
increasingly dependent on clinical
revenues," the report notes, rec
ognizing that "the health care
system of the future will be based
less on the traditional in patient
hospital and more on a variety of
modes of delivery, including in
patient, outpatient and home
health care."
If the plan works as expected,
the center will provide more cost
competitive care and attract more
patients, since cost-efficiency is a
concept stressed both in Clinton's
national health plan and by
increasingly popular Health
Maintenance Organizations.
Extra revenue is particularly
needed by the Medical Center
because its academic mission and
advanced research add costs
many hospitals do not have.
