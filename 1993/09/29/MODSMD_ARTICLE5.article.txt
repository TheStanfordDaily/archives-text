# Stanford scholars approach South Africa with caution in wake of Biehl's murder
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Stanford graduate Jory Steele has been
advised not to take public transportation,
not to work in South African townships and
to always tell someone where she is going —
all this to ensure her safety while working as
a Fulbright Exchange Scholar in South
Africa.
In light of fellow Stanford graduate and
Fulbright Scholar Amy Biehl's murder in
South Africa, Steele said she is both excited
and scared. Amy's death "is very disturb
ing," she said. "It gave me a lot of second
thoughts about going."
She is going though, despite some fears.
"My parents are very concerned about my
safety. They have lots of questions about me

going, especially
after what hap
pened to Amy
Biehl," Steele
said.

Biehl was murdered last month while dri
ving friends home to the township of
Guguletu. Her car was stoned by a mob lin
ing the street, and when she attempted to
escape, she was repeatedly stabbed in the
head. Six young men have been charged
with her murder in South Africa's supreme
court.
"Amy's death was a huge blow. .. . She
and I have a lot of parallels," Steele said.
Both women were Stanford international re
lations mtyors and Fulbright Scholars who
focused their studies on women's
issues in South Africa.
"There are a lot of parallels that
make [the murder] close to home
and very scary," she said.
From October 1992 to August
1993, Biehl worked at the Univer
sity of the Western Cape in South
Africa. She focused on women's
issues with the African National

Congress
Women's League
and the National
Association of
Democratic
Lawyers.
At the same
time, Biehl also
helped develop a
voter registra
tion program for
South Africa's

first multiracial election, which
will be held in April 1994. She was
living in Cape Town with a black
family in the Guguletu township,
located outside of Cape Town.
Because of safety questions
raised by Biehl's murder, Steele is
considering changing her research
focus while in South Africa from
studying the education of high
school and college women in South
Africa, to studying only college
women — because interviewing
high schoolers would mean travel
ing into townships.
"I'll probably modify [my
research project] somehow," she
said, "but it will have something to
do with black women's education."
Steele has met via teleconfer
ence with people in South Africa
and has gone to the South African
embassy in the United States to
help prepare for her security and
safety while working Ln the coun
try. The Fulbright program takes
violence very seriously, she said,
and is preparing the 20 or so Ful
bright scholars traveling to South
Africa to be very cautious.
Stanford's South Africa Faculty

Initiatives Committee is also tak
ing added precaution measures.
In light of the Biehl murder,
"the [South Africa Faculty Initia
tives Committee] has talked about
a whole set of issues. We feel that
it is very important to provide the
best and most up-to-date informa
tion about conditions affecting the
personal safety of Stanford-affili
ated individuals who go to UWC,"
said Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, the committee's co
chair.
He suggested that the next stu-

dent traveling to
South Africa as
part of his com
mittee will most
likely meet with
people in the
townships to find
the safest places
to live. He said it
would be helpful
for prospective
students going to

South Africa to talk with South
Africans by phone to get a grasp of
the changing circumstances.
In senior Becca Gettelman's
experience, though, South Africa
is not as dangerous for foreigners
as the Biehl killing has made it
appear. Gettelman worked in
South Africa in 1992 as a soccer
coach through the World Teach
Organization and then as an
English teacher near Guguletu,
where Biehl lived.
She said that in a few instances,
individuals threw objects at her,
yelled at her or would watch her
while she taught in the school
playground — but 99 percent of
the people she interacted with
were very friendly and excited to
have an American and a white per
son teaching.
"My feeling on it is that, in any
society and any group, there are
going to be people who are angry
and bitter, especially in South
Africa — where people have every
right to be angry. I was amazed
how the overwhelming majority of
people were not carrying around
bitterness," Gettelman said.

said Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, the committee's co
chair.
He suggested that the next stu-

dent traveling to
South Africa as
part of his com
mittee will most
likely meet with
people in the
townships to find
the safest places
to live. He said it
would be helpful
for prospective
students going to

South Africa to talk with South
Africans by phone to get a grasp of
the changing circumstances.
In senior Becca Gettelman's
experience, though, South Africa
is not as dangerous for foreigners
as the Biehl killing has made it
appear. Gettelman worked in
South Africa in 1992 as a soccer
coach through the World Teach
Organization and then as an
English teacher near Guguletu,
where Biehl lived.
She said that in a few instances,
individuals threw objects at her,
yelled at her or would watch her
while she taught in the school
playground — but 99 percent of
the people she interacted with
were very friendly and excited to
have an American and a white per
son teaching.
"My feeling on it is that, in any
society and any group, there are
going to be people who are angry
and bitter, especially in South
Africa — where people have every
right to be angry. I was amazed
how the overwhelming majority of
people were not carrying around
bitterness," Gettelman said.
