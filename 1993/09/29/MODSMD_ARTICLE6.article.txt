# Spike Lee to speak in Mem Aud
## Senate approves $12,500 price tag 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
In its first meeting of the year, the
ASSU Senate voted last night to spend
$16,500 to bring both renowned film
maker Spike Lee and former Democratic
presidential candidate Paul Tsongas to
campus.
The senate unanimously approved
the honoraria, which would comprise
about three-fourths of the ASSU Speak
ers' Bureau's fall budget, after some sen
ators questioned the size of Lee's
$12,500 fee.
Undergraduate senator Anthony
Westerfield went so far as to suggest cut
ting some of the money available for
Lee's lodging — now set at $110 for one
night. "Will he not come if we get him a
cheaper hotel?" he asked.
But Speakers' Bureau Chair Melind
John assured senators the money allot
ted to Lee was a far cry from the $17,500
that he usually is paid for making such
appearances.
In addition, John said that a survey
conducted by the Speakers' Bureau last

year indicated a large number of stu
dents would be pleased to see Lee come to
campus.
"I think he will attract a large number
of students," John said, noting that
Lee's speech will probably fill Memorial
Auditorium, which holds more than
1,700 people.

Senate Chair Greg Waldorf also an
nounced that the two student appoint
ments to the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education will be made in the next
few weeks. "We need to find one gradu
ate and one undergraduate student to

serve on the commission," he
said.
The delayed selection of the
two student members is the pri
mary reason that the commis
sion's meetings have been
pushed to mid-October, four
months after it was scheduled
to first meet. The ASSU's
appointment of the students
was held up because the Office
of Student Activities had not
yet determined the qualifica
tions the student members
would need.
According to graduate senator
Nawwar Kasrawi, the two seats
are open to all students, and
applications will be available
beginning Monday in the ASSU
office.
The ASSU committee on com
mittees — an arm of the senate
— will select the two representa
tives.
But Council of Presidents
member Ron Brown said the
COP is "hoping that the Univer
sity will work with us to increase
the number of students on the
commission."
The senate also recognized the

accomplishments of the senate
outreach board, which held an
orientation meeting for 50 fresh
men in Old Union yesterday.
"This is the first time we've
really had an organized outreach
program," said undergraduate
senator Gabe Lucas, one of the
board's co-chairs.
The board "is going to be an
all-year thing," said Lucas. "Fall
quarter we will reach out to resi
dences and winter quarter we'll
discuss the nominations commis
sion with students."
The COP also announced
plans to reach out to students
through town meetings in gradu
ate and undergraduate resi
dences.
"We're going to hold meetings
every other week or so," said
COP member Jason Snyder. "A
COP member and senate mem
bers will be at the meetings."
Various issues will be dis
cussed at the meetings, he said.
"It will depend upon what's
important to the student body at
the time."
The first town hall meeting
will be held tomorrow in Lantana
House at 7 p.m. and will focus on
the cost of higher education,
financial aid packages and Clin
ton's reform of the student-loan
process, Snyder said.
