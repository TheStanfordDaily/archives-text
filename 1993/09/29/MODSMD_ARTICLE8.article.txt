# Are students studying abroad in danger?
## Venturing into politically volatile countries raises issues of safety 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Every year, about 400 Stanford students
choose to study abroad. And every year,
dozens more accept grants to perform
research in foreign countries.
Are these students in danger?
The violent death of Stanford graduate
Amy Biehl in South Africa left many stu
dents, parents and educators questioning the
wisdom of sending the nation's top minds
overseas to face the challenges of politically
volatile countries.
Stanford students have the enviable
option of studying almost anywhere in the
world. Official University programs exist in
Berlin, Florence, Oxford, Paris, Kyoto,
Rome and Santiago, as well as the newly
opened campus in Moscow.
In addition, students with a good idea
and a little drive can receive grants to
study in any foreign country through the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities
office.
But the very existence of so many choices
can pit academic opportunity against good
judgment. As young scholars tear down
national walls and build a global community,
the issue of personal safety can get lost in the
rubble.
"Last year, news from Germany about
hostility aimed at foreigners gave us an
opportunity to review security and safety
issues" on international campuses said Rus
sell Berman, director of the Overseas Studies
Center.
While the University has its own security
measures in place, evacuation or temporary
closure of any overseas campus would take its
cue from the State Department, trusting
embassies to "alert American citizens to sig
nificant threats," said Pam McNaughton,
student services coordinator for the Overseas
Studies Center.
Stanford has also developed resources to
make it easier for students to be safe around
the globe.
"The International Center has a binder on

State Department warnings for each coun
try," said Laura Selznick, director of the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities
office. "Any interested student should just
take a few minutes and research their
options. I'm sure a lot of people would be
pleasantly surprised to read how secure must
places really are."
"Luckily, we haven't had significant inci
dents," Berman said. "This doesn't mean
incidents don't occur," she said, but it means
that students can expect to live safely if they
simply use common sense.
"I trust the intelligence of Stanford stu
dents," Berman said.
"When students get into a danger situa
tion, all you can do is hope that their head is
in the right place," Selznick said. "You can't
always be there to protect everyone."
'Learning another culture'
Stanford places a great deal of emphasis on
overseas cultural orientation programs,
Berman said. While the programs don't dic
tate student behavior, they point out basic
safety information for international travel, he
added.
Some students attending international
programs are seasoned travelers, Berman
said. Others are first-time travelers whose
combination of eagerness and naivete can
spell "easy target" in any language.
"What would you do if you were moving to
New York?" McNaughton asked. "Make sure
you know where you're going so you don't
have to consult a map, don't just disappear
for the weekend without telling anyone â€”
really basic information."
Overseas orientation programs stress cul
tural awareness as the best form of protection
from all international menaces, from com
mon pickpockets to political terrorists. Cul
tural learning not only broadens students'
experiences, but it gives them the tools they
need to blend into their surrounding, Berman
said.
"If they (students) pursue American con
ventions they will appear to be American,"
Berman said. "This kind of knowledge is part

of learning another culture. .. it's up to you
to decide whether to participate in a new cul
ture or stick out."
"We can't control what they (students) do,
but the school has an obligation to warn them
of the challenges some parts of each city
might present, he added.
Expert advice
"Safety is something that we think about a
lot," Selznick said. "Our approach is not to
legislate but to make sure students are
knowledgeable about where they're going."
Beyond making sure that students have a
basic cultural and geographical understand
ing of the region they are visiting, the URO
uses the expertise of University faculty to
evaluate whether a "realistic threat" exists,
Selznick said.
"We had several students studying in India
this year, and we were really concerned about
factional violence," Selznick said. "But
instead of legislating whether or not these
students could go, we talked to knowledge
able faculty about the particular regions they
were going to to see if they were really at
risk."
In addition, special measures can be taken
in response to specific hazards. The hotlines
set up for concerned parents and students
during the Gulf War were only a small part of
the protection Stanford was prepared to
employ, Selznick said.
Although parents sometimes forbid stu
dents from researching in dangerous loca
tions, "we're not in a stage any more where
mom and dad should say 'you may not go,' "
Selznick said.
"There was a time when Washington was
the murder capital of the U.S., but we were
safely sending people to Stanford-in-Wahing
ton," Selznick said. "And for a time East Palo
Alto held that title, yet people go there from
the Haas center everyday."
Many of the risks associated with overseas
research are no different from the inherent
risk of day-to-day living, Selznick said. "You
could be taking a train to Memphis and fall
into a bayou," she added.
