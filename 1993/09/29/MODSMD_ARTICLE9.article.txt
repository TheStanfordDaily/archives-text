JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)- Six
suspects in the killing of former Stanford student
Amy Biehl will be charged with murder, public
violence and robbery, the attorney general's office
said Monday.
All six, including a 15-year-old youth, appeared
in court near the black township outside Cape
Town where Biehl, 26, was stabbed to death Aug.
25. A Fulbright scholar, Biehl was just finishing
10 months research in South Africa on women's
role in the country's transition from apartheid to
democracy.
The case was postponed until Oct. 8, with five
of the six suspects remaining in custody, and the
youth released to his mother.
The suspects are members of the Pan African
ist Student Organization, which is linked to the
radical Pan Africanist Congress. The congress
advocates armed struggle against police and
whites.

According to witnesses, Biehl, a friend to many
leaders of the African National Congress, was
attacked by a crowd while driving friends home in
the Guguletu black township. One witness said an
attacker told her that Biehl, who in two days was
to have returned to the United States to begin
graduate school, was targeted because she was
white.
If convicted of murder, the suspects could
receive the death penalty. However, executions
have been suspended in South Africa until a post
apartheid government considers the issue of capi
tal punishment.
Political violence has killed thousands of blacks
in recent years and is considered the greatest
threat to the nation's first multiracial election,
planned for April 27.
Police said yesterday that more than 40 people
died in weekend violence in black townships
nationwide.
