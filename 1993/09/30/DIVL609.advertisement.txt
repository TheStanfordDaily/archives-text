Zen Palate
Many vegetarian menus will provide the protein usually found
in meat and poultry by offering tofu. However, tofu is high in
water content and may not fill the appetite. To add
substance to a meal, vegetarian menus often are overridden
with pasta and rice entrees that are high in calories.
In Ming's Zen Palate say gluten, a popular Chinese
vegetarian ingredient provides protein without the calories.
Say gluten is solid and contains the fiber and protein of
soybean but is starch-free and cholesterol-free At Ming's, we
prepare soy gluten dishes the same way we prepare some of
our most popular meat and poultry dishes. For instance, in the
vegetarian versions of our famous Chicken and Cashew
Chicken, we substitute shredded, cubed, and diced soy
gluten for the meat items. These delicious and healthy dishes
satiate your appetite ... and leave you hungry for more
More of Ming's, that is. Stop by to see our new vegetarian
menu ... or try our traditional meat and poultry favorites.
