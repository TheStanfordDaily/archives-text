# Moscow program begins

While post-Soviet Russia
makes its transition to a democra
cy, students at the new Stanford
in Moscow Center will witness the
changes first-hand.
Twelve Stanford students
started taking classes this week in
subjects such as Russian lan
guage, history and politics at the
University's newest overseas
studies center, located in the heart
of Moscow.
Initially, there were apprehen
sions about setting up a center in
the then-Soviet Union amid polit
ical upheaval, said Overseas Stud
ies Director Russell Berman. "But
after it was clear in Russia that
there was a political shift and [the
government was] moving toward
democratic institutions, we got
the green light."
The program is located at the
Russian Science Foundation's
Center for Public Research, which
is located across from many gov
ernment buildings. The center
was chosen as the site for Stan
ford's program because it was
thought to provide a good environ
ment for the "young, dynamic
group eager to create ties between
Russia and the Western world,"
Berman said. The foundation's
faculty will teach the Stanford
students.
In May, the Russian faculty vis
ited Stanford for two-weeks to
meet students and faculty, and to
familiarize themselves with the
California lifestyle. While no Stan
ford faculty members are teaching
at the Moscow Center this quar
ter, next year when the center
opens for fall and winter quarter,
there will be Stanford instructors.
Berman said it is important to
get students into countries while
they are undergoing monumental
historical changes — instead of
waiting until everything settles
down — so that they have the
opportunity to witness such events
first-hand.
Stanford students involved in
the Overseas Studies program were
in Berlin when the Berlin Wall came
down and in Krakow, Poland when
that nation held its first free elec
tions in 40 years.
Right now is a "pretty exciting
time for Stanford students to be
there especially since they can work
with Russian faculty to help them
understand what is going on," said

Corb Smith, deputy director of
Overseas Studies.
Prof. Gregory Friedin of the
Slavic Department, who recently
visited the Stanford-in-Moscow cen
ter, said he was "very favorably
impressed" by the program. "They
have the best people teaching, and
it's the best that the country has to
offer," Friedin said.
There are some concerns about
the student's security, he said,
although they are minimal.
"It's safe to be in the eye of the
storm," he said.
Berman, who will visit the center
in November, said he is optimistic
about the program's success.
"I think it's an extraordinary
opportunity for Stanford students
to be able to witness one of the
grandest transformations of the
century," he said.
