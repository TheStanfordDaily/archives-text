Self-defense class must
include men if students
receive academic credit

LAST WEEK'S decision to
cancel "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women" after it was
charged that the class violates a
federal anti-discrimination law has
sparked impassioned student reac
tion, from surprise and disappoint
ment to fierce anger.
"To think that it's not going to
be here makes me irate," said
junior Abby Reyes, who called the
class the "most crucial part of my
introduction to Stanford."
It's true that self-defense for
women has historically been one of
the most popular classes on cam
pus, with wait lists extending for
quarters and sometimes even
years.
The class' popularity and histo
ry, however, do not change the fact
that it clearly violated Title IX of
the Education Amendments of
1972. That law requires schools
that receive federal funding to end
practices that discriminate on the
basis of sex, race or religion. Last
spring, the class was opened to men
for the first time, but it was sepa
rated by sex, and the men's section
included only readings, discussion
and assertiveness training. The
women's section had an additional
component: physical self-defense
training.
While Title IX allows for separat
ing sexes if physical force is
involved, it prohibits segregation in
discussions and non-physical inter
actions. Both the Feminist Studies
Department and the Women
Defending Ourselves Collective —
which respectively sponsor and
teach the course — agreed that the
course was in violation and
embarked upon a modification plan.
The most obvious remedy — cre
ating co-ed discussion groups —
was apparently rejected. Feminist
Studies Chair Jane Collier said in a

statement that class organizers
believed that, since many of the
women in the class were victims of
sexual assault or abuse, they would
be uncomfortable talking in co-ed
groups.
Undeniably, it is important for
all women to talk about their expe
riences and hear about others to
understand "issues in self
defense." But providing an aca
demic forum for discussion is quite
distinct from providing a support
group.
Indeed, in the classes giving aca
demic credit, the privilege of one
student's comfort cannot super
sede another's entitlement to an
education.
While this may appear an
unpopular stance, given the larger
than-life reputation of the self
defense class, the pitfalls of
putting comfort ahead of knowl
edge are made lucid by analogy:
Just as whites must not be exclud
ed from a class on violent racism,
or straights from a class on gay
bashing, males must not be exclud
ed from a class on violence against
females. To do so impedes under
standing and learning, and estab
lishes a dangerous precedent
incompatible with the quest for
knowledge and education.
In working out its revisions, the
Feminist Studies Department and
the collective should come up with
a compromise that provides for a
co-ed class, and at the same time
offers a not-for-credit outlet for
women who wish to discuss sexual
assault issues in a non-threatening
atmosphere. Perhaps a women's
group sponsored by the Bridge or
Cowell Student Health Center
would fit the bill.
While "Issues in Self-Defense
for Women" has been a long-time
favorite offering as is, it's time to
recognize the inequity that has
developed, and proceed to correct
this imbalance. It is the commu
nity's responsibility to provide
support groups, but the Universi
ty's to provide an education to all
students, without regard to race,
religion or gender.
