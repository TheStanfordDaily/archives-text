## Jeremy Cohen Questioning the propaganda of perception 
### 
THE HAND-addressed, legal-sized
envelope lying flat in my post office
box seemed inviting enough.
Inside, however, the writer's hand
embraced a chilling inventory of Stan
ford's high crimes and misdemeanors:
our failure to "teach Americanism"; our
commitment to diversity; our support of
President Clinton's attempt to eviscerate
the nation's official policy of discrimina
tion against gays in the military; our lack
of academic concern over national issues
such as violence and educational medi
ocrity. For four single-spaced pages my
correspondent unleashed a howl of frus
tration with what he believes is taking
place at Stanford.
"Jeremy," he concluded on a neatly
printed postscript, "as our schools
become more liberal and U.S. societal
indicators go down the toilet, shouldn't
we rethink liberalism, political correct
ness and multiculturalism? We're los
ing the greatness we had." Are political
correctness, liberalism and multicultur
alism the problem at Stanford? The
place to begin is with a look at the labels
— where they come from and what they
mean.
There is a broad national perception
of Stanford and other universities as
palaces of liberal political conformity —
a vision that simply does not reflect the
day-to-day routine of classes, research
and activities. The perception is there,

however, because it is in line with the
disfigured view of students and univer
sities reported in countless sound bites
and newspaper columns. Walter Lipp
mann recognized the phenomenon in
1922 when he wrote that the mass
media distort our sense of reality
"because events have to be compressed
into very short messages." The prob
lem, he said, is "the difficulty of making
a small vocabulary express a complicat
ed world." The media-created percep
tion of the university expressed by my
correspondent does not adequately rep
resent the complicated world in which
we live.
Whatever its origins, however, the
popular view of campus political cor
rectness congers an image of a mass of
students blindly following the coercive
leftist orthodoxy of the university. Yet
to accept the charge that students are
puppets of professorial propaganda is to
reject the underlying tenet not only of
liberal arts education, but of our
national experiment with democracy as
well. The basis of the American vision of
self-government is the radical Age of
Reason view expressed by the Framers
that people are capable of enlighten
ment. The term 'liberal arts education'
refers to educating students in the arts
of liberty — the familiarity with infor
mation and the skill at reasoning that
make enlightenment possible. In defer

ence to Lippmann, we might think of a
liberal arts education as the develop
ment of a vocabulary large enough to
understand a complicated world.
My correspondent's letter is chilling.
At one level I have to ask if there is a
basis for any of his concerns. I'm not
prepared to say no. The freeze turns icy,
however, when I consider my writer's
readiness to assume that universities
lack the enlightenment necessary to
continue the experiment in self-govern
ment. That loss of faith in the liberal
arts process, along with my writer's
personal disengagement, are body blows
that weaken the core of who we are.
My correspondent has put voice to
his perception of Stanford in declaring,
"I refuse to contribute (anymore to
Stanford] since I object to the direction
our formerly great university is going."
Is it is the perception that counts?
"Whatever we believe to be the true pic
ture we treat as if it were the environ
ment itself," Lippmann wrote. As a
classroom teacher I have to wonder how
many people share my writer's picture
of us and how many will join him in
treating that perception as if it were the
environment itself.
