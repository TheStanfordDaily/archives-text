# Letters
## First Year Trips were scheduled to avoid conflict with classes 
### 
-1 WOULD LIKE to clarify several con
cerns Asst. Prof. Philippe Buc raised
in his Sept. 28 letter to The Daily
about a departmental mailing from the
First Year Trips program to faculty mem
bers. Our purpose in writing the letter to
faculty was to inform them of the First
Year Trips program and schedule. The
following items are clarifications of Buc's
concerns:
• First Year Trips does begin on Friday,
Oct. 8, but does not start until 3 p.m. for
outdoor trips and 6 p.m. for public service
trips. These departure times were specifi
cally chosen so that they would not con
flict with academic classes. We also told
students to discuss any problems concern

ing departure times with their trip leaders
and the First Year Trips staff. We regret
that our letter did not include these
departure times for the trips.
• Our mailing did state that "We are
hoping to avoid scheduling conflicts with
class assignments and exams." In no way
did we ask faculty to rearrange schedules
around the First Year Trips schedule. We
simply wrote to inform faculty about the
program and its schedule. Realizing that
students would be concerned about aca
demic schedules, we specifically moved
our trips to an earlier date to better avoid
midterms.
• Asst. Prof. Buc observed that "siz
able segments of the Stanford popula

tion believe that academics should take
second seat," and asked, "Won't people
realize that a necessary condition of
good teaching is adequate student time
spent of studying?" First Year Trips rec
ognizes the latter truism but disagrees
with the former assumption. Stanford
students are concerned about study
time, as evidenced by the many calls we
received from first-time Stanford stu
dents about how the First Year Trips fit
into the academic schedule. We have
actively advised concerned students
about the nature of academic schedules
and emphasized our withdrawal policy.
If a participant feels overwhelmed by
his/her academic schedule, then he/she

may withdraw from the program at any
point. A few have already exercised this
option.
Since this is First Year Trips' first
year, we would especially welcome any
input from academic and other depart
ments, as well as the student body. First
Year Trips is a pilot program funded by
the ASSU and sponsored by Recreational
Educational Development Workshops
Out of Doors (REDWOOD). If you would
like to learn more about our program,
please contact the REDWOOD office. We
welcome your comments and suggestions.
