## The 						ups and downs of the bungee-jumping business The 						meteoric rise and equally rapid fall of a would-be American sporting pastime 
### Kyle Graham Editorial staff 
A year ago, Stanford students
could not walk across campus
with being accosted by a legion
of fliers, posters and salesmen pitch
ing the new and unique sport of
bungee-jumping.
It was exciting, they said. It gave
participants a rush. It was the sport to
end all sports.
But now, the fliers have disap
peared. The posters have faded. The
pitchmen are gone. And bungee-jump
ing, formerly sold as the activity Stan
ford students had to do has quietly
vanished from the campus scene.
And Stanford is not the only place
where it is growing harder and harder
to find anyone offering to conduct
bungee jumps.
Across the nation, and especially
in California, bungee jumping has
gone from a cutting-edge adventure to

an adventure that didn't make the
cut.
The collapse of the industry has
driven approximately 150 out of 180
bungee-jumping operators out of busi
ness, hitting the Northern California
operators, who once advertised to
Stanford students, especially hard.
Several local companies have either
ceased scheduling jumps altogether or
limited their activities to a by-reserva
tion basis.
Ironically, bungee jumping first

appeared

on the North
American conti
nent in the Bay

Area six years ago.
Originally an activity ere

ated by the Dangerous Sports
man's Club of Oxford, England, in
1987 brothers John, Paul and Peter
Kockelman introduced the sport to
America and opened Bungee Adven
tures, which conducted jumps out of
the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Moun
tain View before discontinuing jumps
earlier this year.
In bungee jumping, participants
leap from platforms, hot-air balloons
or bridges, at heights of up to 300 feet
(though professional jumps are some
times measured in the thousands).
Their only savior is a thin latex cord,
which is either attached to a chest har
ness or tied about the jumper's feet,
participants genererally record experi
encing a "rush" while both falling and
rebounding after their leap.
Despite, or perhaps because of, its
daredevil appeal, soon after its
introduction to the U.S. bungee
jumping became the darling of the
national media, meriting stories in
Time, Forbes, Newsweek and even
Christianity Today.
Operators rushed into what

appeared to be a boom industry —
bungee-jumping establishments could
recover their $2,000 investment in
latex cord and crane rental fees in just
over an hour.

But that summer also
witnessed events which
would toll a death knell

for the industry. In July,
there were three heavily

publicized accidents in
which cords alter

nately snapped or
were made too
long.
These acci

dents resulted in two

deaths and two injuries. Further

more, since most

jumps are video
taped for poster

ity, the trag
edies received

heavy airtime in
the national press.

"Media killed the

sport," said Peter Kockelman. "It
ruined consumer confidence in
bungee jumping." Suddenly, people
were unwilling to lend their cranes,
property or cords to bungee operators
for fear of lawsuits. Insurance rates
skyrocketed.
"These shows would say, 'Before
bungee-jumping, make sure you watch
this,' and then they would show some
one's cord snap," added Kockelman.
"If they did the same thing for car
crashes, nobody would drive a car."
The comments of many Stanford
students seem to support Kockelman's
statement. Junior Jeff Benesch, who
jumped frequently before the acci
dents, stated, "The accidents con
vinced me not to jump with an orga
nized company."
In addition to the difficulties oper
ators faced in finding sites and equip
ment, the lack or repeat business also
served to doom many operators.

"About four-fifths of (the jumpers]
were men and only one-fifth were
women," said Kockelman, who added
that women have a greater tendency
to be repeat jumpers.
Furthermore, the heavy media
exposure of the sport — some might
say overexposure — probably made

'Shows would say, 'Before
bungee-jumping, make
sure you watch this,' and
then they would show
someone's cord snap.'

jumping appear dramatically more
popular than it in fact was. As of

this summer, only approxi

mately 25,000 peo
ple had participat-

Ed in bungee
jumping nation
wide in the

six years
since its
introduction.

Now, even long
time establish
ments are trying to

sell their cranes and

cords, making it
increasingly difficult

for Stanford-thrill seekers

to find nearby jumping sites.

However, former operators are finding
it troublesome to find buyers. "Obvi
ously, bungee-jumping companies
aren't buying (the equipment)," said
Kockelman.
Despite the demise of the vast
majority of jump operators, Bungee
Adventures still offers Stanford stu-

dents and others still interested in
jumping a training course and equip
ment so that they may enjoy the sport
on their own. Furthermore, although
most of the business which promote
jumping have closed, several groups
still conduct private jumps of their
own.
Meanwhile, Bungee Adventures
is busy promoting its new
invention, the Ejection Seat,
to be introduced to the Bay Area this
Saturday at the Shoreline Ampithe
atre.
Currently touring the Canadian
fair circuit, the ejection seat is a sling
shot-like device which propels partici
pants 150 feet into the air while
strapped into a chair.
Promoters are optomistic regard
ing the chair's future success; the gen
der split between particpants has been
fairly equal, and since the Ejection
Seat is significantly safer than bungee
jumping (the cords used in the Seat
have been pre-stretched), Bungee
Adventures' insurance costs have
been halved.
Indeed, promoters are optimistic;
maybe, they add, it will be even more

popular than

bun g e e
jumping.
