# Full of good cheer
## 
### 
Can you imagine me as a
cheerleader, bursting with spirit
and sporting my little skirt and
undies in front of thousands at
Stanford Stadium this weekend
against Notre Dame?
Does my tomboyish mug
below not convey the enthusiasm
and the long tan legs required to
excite the crowd during timeouts?

Even so, someone has to do it,
because Stanford fans are notori
ous for their lack of crowd sup
port during games.
Against UCLA last Saturday,
you could almost hear Bill Walsh
calling the plays from the side
lines during the third quarter.
The entire student section must
have been out buying hot dogs or
Snapples.
Now think back to the fourth
quarter of the Colorado game,
when the crowd came alive and
the Stanford defense actually
stopped the Buffaloes on three
downs for the first time all
evening. The stadium then con
tinued to rock with enthusiasm,
as Steve Stenstrom and the offen
sive unit posted 14 quick points
and ran away with a victory.
It is only when the crowd
achieves that level of excitement
that the fans actually become the
12th player on the field. And at
times our defense does needs a
12th player on the field.
In any case, I decided to make
my contribution to Stanford foot
ball this season by taking a quick

clinic in cheerleading before the
Fighting Irish come knocking
down our doors.
Although I am not perfect
cheerleading material, three male
cheerleaders agreed to give me an
improptu lesson after I stopped
by their sign-up booth in White
plaza on Tuesday.
Starting with the cheerleading
basics, I could not convince
myself that "Push it in Big Red"
is the most appropriate cheer to
do at any time, especially when
the crowd starts getting excited.
Besides, there is always the stan
dard "Go Stanford."
In addition, no female cheer
leader is complete without learn
ing the necessary aerial lifts and
maneuvers. Although our cheer
leaders do not perform the Liber
ty, which requires the male to bal
ance the standing female in the
palm of his hand, I experimented
with one easy toss and one lift
before calling my career quits.
Jumping up and being tossed
eight feet into the air, or better yet,
jumping up and being tossed into
the air before landing on some
one's shoulders, is nauseating.
Alas, I seriously doubt that I
will be be called back anytime
soon, considering I almost cas
trated a cheerleader while he
tried to lift me above his head. So
instead, I will be cheering my
brains out in the student section,
like a good Cardinal fan should.
But even if I can not be on the
sidelines on Saturday, jumping
up and down with a megaphone, I
expect everyone to be out there
with extra coats of face-paint and
extra loud bullhorns. And instead
of throwing water balloons and
nasty remarks at our cheerlead
ers this time, try it on the Irish.
If that happens, the eight-and
one-half-point spread will be
meaningless; if that does not hap
pen, you might see me on the side
lines against Arizona in two weeks.
