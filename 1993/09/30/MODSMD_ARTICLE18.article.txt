### Sam Wu Staff writer 
A message to all duffers on the
Stanford Golf Course — Get out
of the way, or be trampled.
A horde consisting of 145
cross-country teams will be run
ning on, over and around the
Stanford fairways at the Stanford
Invitational this Saturday. Boast
ing 38 collegiate squads and over
100 high-school teams, the Stan
ford Invite is the largest meet in
the western United States.

'We have a good
chance of placing
high this year.'
— Sarah Truitt

The Cardinal will compete
against the Division I entrants.
Brigham Young, whose men's and
women's teams are both ranked
sixth in the nation, will provide
the primary obstacle for the No.
12 Stanford women and the No.
21 men. On the men's side, Michi
gan State will also pose a chal
lenge, while UCLA is another
solid competitor in both the
men's and women's races.
The Invite will start at the sec
ond tee. The women will race at 4
p.m. and the men at 5 p.m. Nei
ther Cardinal squad has won in
recent years.
"[The Invitel will be a good
indicator of where we are," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "We
have a shot at winning. The
women are going to be close. They
have a good shot at upsetting
BYU."
Ail-American senior Gary Stolz
will captain the men. Senior Todd
Lewis, sophomores Eric Spayde

and Rob Reeder and freshmen
Greg Jimmerson, J.J. White and
Andrew Cowgill will join Stolz,
along with three other runners
yet to be announced.
"I'm looking for a very good fin
ish from us," Stolz said. "We did
well [in our previous meets]. Our
goal is to keep three or four run
ners together. .. . The upperclass
men should Ireacquaint them
selves with] running as pack, and
the freshmen should get used to
running in collegiate meets."
Senior and defending District
-8 champion Louise Watson will
lead the women's charge. Senior
captain Sarah Truitt, sophomore
Laura Hayward, junior Step
hanie Jensen and freshmen
Monal Chokshi and Leila Burr
will also compete. Lananna has
yet to name the four other run
ners who will round out the
women's team.
"[The event 1 is a chance for us
to break some barriers," said
senior women's captain Sarah
Truitt. "We used to be national
contenders in the early '80s. We
have a good chance of placing high
this year. BYU's N0.6, but not
unbeatable."
As Stolz suggests, winning is
not the Cardinal's primary con
cern. The Invite will be a time for
the Cardinal to prepare them
selves for the Pacific 10 Champi
onships and perhaps the NCAA
Championships as well.
"We'll be more aggressive
now," Lananna said. However,
the coach is also mindful of the
Cardinal's relative inexperience.
"We have to be careful because
you can't send young kids all
out."
Team members are also opti
mistic. "I hope to see a solid per
formance," Watson said. "It'll be
a time for us to get used to run
ning in meets and get into the

competitive sort of mind. [Our
earlier races] have been more like
work-outs. It's time to think
beyond that."
Speaking of her own training,

Watson adds, "It's all heading in
the right direction. I'd rather just
be solid now and go for the
rewards in November at the Dis
tricts and NCAAs."
