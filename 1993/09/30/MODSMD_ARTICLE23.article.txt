Your entertainment
ain't like mine. It's
bittersweet to the
taste.

There was once a jazz diva's diva, who
could seduce a supper club crowd with her
sultry takes of "He's Funny that Way" and
"God Bless the Child." She was hip, she had
swing and could improvise on practically
any tune you pitched her way. Man how
they dug her.
But she was never in control. She wasn't
a "Ms. Jackson."
Her product was a strange fruit. In lily
white downtown, it was a exotic delicacy to
die for. In coffee-brown uptown, it was a
slice of down-home comfort black folks
couldn't get enough of. So the diva's diva
sang and sang and sang until the darkness
of exploitive relationships and substance
abuse tore her silver chords and feeble life
to shreds.
Man how they dug her. But they dug her
so completely that now there's nothing left.
Just CD boxed memories that most cats

like me can't afford. Still the digging con
tinues, because most modern-day "divas"
lip-synch their way to stardom.
Your entertainment ain't like mine. It's
confounded by repetition. Our first black
superstars were shufflers and minstrels.
They had to be. Either you got with that —
and were a nappy-headed, wild-eyed
negro, sad-faced mammy, mealy-mouthed
butler or tragic mulatto — or you got with
nothing. Hollywood wouldn't tolerate any
thing more. They did once and got burned
— terribly.
A football player turned lawyer turned
singer turned actor turned voice of his
people, whose version of "Old Man River"
made neck hair rise and who brought real
color to an otherwise black-faced "Othel
lo," wasn't having it. He turned their
paper-mach£ world inside-out and then
said, "You're welcome." Tinseltown never
bothered to say "Thank you." Instead they

labeled Mr. Head Nigger In Charge a Com
mie lover and sent him packing off to Eu
rope and obscurity.
Can you truly blame today's black su
perstars for rocking the boat gently as op
posed to violently? A Malcolm here, a Tina
there, a Furious out yonder and a Mookey
'round the corner? It's tough. Put yourself
in their oxfords.
If only I could click my heels three times
and mutter under my breath, "Don't insult
me, don't compromise me, don't exploit
me...Maybe then I'd wake up in a land
where people of color — brothers and sis
ters in particular — were regularly in films
as meaningful to them as "Age of Inno
cence" is to Scorsese or "Husbands and
Wives" was to Allen. But Ice-T knows the
truth and isn't afraid to say it. "SHIT
AIN'T LIKE THAT." I concur.
Your entertainment ain't like mine.
Today's pain is tomorrow's fad. Black

males paint cach other red
with tech-nine spray while
funky break beats escape
from the Kenwood pullout

system in some fool's Six-Tray. Time and
Newsweek tell us that these young broth
ers' white counterparts think they're so
cool that middle America better start keep
ing better tabs on its future CEO's and
heads-of-state. Lock'em up early — make
sure they ditch the baggy jeans, the hooded
sweatshirts and the baseball caps worn
crooked or pulled down sinisterly over the
eyes. One more thing, discourage them
from singing that god awful "Nothing-
But-a G-Thing" song. Rap is a ghetto
music.
The nation knows what's going on in the
'hood and is prepared to pull up a sofa and
pop a bag of kernels to enjoy the action. It's
even better than "90210," provided it's on
an inner-city airwave far away.
Your entertainment ain't like mine.
Hopefully mine is better informed, more
sensitive — humane. ■
