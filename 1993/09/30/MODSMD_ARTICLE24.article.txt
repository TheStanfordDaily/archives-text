# Richard Linklater: Hazed and Abused
## by N'Gai Croal 
### 
Mc xcusc mc, I have to vomit." These
are the first words out of writer
director Richard I.inklater's
mouth when he's asked about the role the
media has cast him in; namely, that of
spokesman for an entire generation. Their
rush to label him is understandable, though.
His debut feature, "Slacker," captured the
ennui of a previously undocumented sub
section of society — one with no employ
ment and even less ambition; hence, the term
"slacker."
(Un)fortunately for Linklater, his film
came out around the same time as Douglas
Coupland's critical and commercial success,
"Generation X," so the two works became in
extricably linked. Both were recast as texts
necessary to understand the 13th Generation:
born between 1962 and 1981, after the baby
boomers, and doomed to a lower standard of
living than the previous generation. This, no
doubt, explains the blasd fatalism that res
onates through every frame of "Slacker."
But Linklater refuses to buy into the hype.
"I don't understand the spokesman thing,"
he says genuinely. "Who needs spokespeo
ple? It's a joke. I'm adopting a real Nirvana
esque attitude these days.... I>eave me the
fuck alone, y'know?"
Not content to simply adopt Nirvana's
"fuck-you" pose, Linklater goes on to explain
exactly what's wrong with the Generation X
hype. "It bugs me the way the whole genera
tion thing has been so commodified and clas
sified. Now we're being sold to. It's kind of
ridiculous, don't you think?
"Everybody's resenting it, so I think that
the message should go back in a big way, like
'Hey! Don't sell your Honda to us, don't make
a TV show for us, don't condescend to us> just
let everybody do their thing.' " In a burst of
self-deprecation, he adds, "Filmmakers — I
mean, speaking for myself — don't really
make very good spokespeople anyway. I just
happened to make a film that was about

something that people could relate to."
iinklatcr could say the same thing about
his witty, heartfelt new film, "Dazed
and Confused." Loosely based on his
own high-school experiences, the film takes
place in a single day and night — the last day
of school before summer break-— in the lives
of 1976 Middle America teenagers. But don't
think that we can't relate to the diverse group
of characters and their situations.
"The '70s are really just a backdrop," says
the director- "I was kinda hoping for a time
less feel, as far as what teenagers do, go
through and all that."
Don't expect to hear the Bee Gees and
Donna Summer on this soundtrack —
"Dazed and Confused," like the eponymous

Led Zeppelin song, rocks all night long. Says
I.inklater, "Culturally speaking, I wanted to
depict the rock n' roll '70s, not the disco 70s,
which a lot of people think of as the '70s. It
was just a time that I remember, those years.
Music played such a big part in your life. All
of that teen-age energy. *
His voice trails off wistfully, but he quick
ly recovers. "Actually, I never tell the studio
or anybody that," he says in a semi-conspira
torial tone. "The reason it's set in the '70s is
because the movie's not realty about much,
y'know? But if you put it in the '70s, it seemed
to have some substantial value, like it was
about ihe '705."
Linklater's ruse worked like a charm on
the profit-minded Universal Pictures brass.
"They were like, 'Oh, cool,' " he continues,

adopting the drone of a marketing executive,
" 'it's a teen-age rock n' roll movie? It takes
place in the '70s? That's two [selling points]
right there.' So they didn't really notice that
nothing happens."
He co-produced the film with James Jacks
and Sean Daniel, two men with a knack for
taking critically acclaimed talents mainstream
— they've been involved with "Do the Right
Thing," "Raising Arizona" and "American Me"
— while enabling Spike Lee, the Coen brothers
and Edward James Olmos to retain their
unique voices. Linklater must have breathed a
little easier at the prospect of working with the
duo — until he saw how the Jacks-Daniel team
and the MPAA ratings board conspired to ho
mogenize John Woo's "Hard Target."
Linklater quickly admits that working
under the aegis of a major studio brings with
it certain pressures. "The pressure is more fi
nancial — they really squeeze you on the
money, on the schedule and on all the ad
ministrative things, y'know... it's just a cor
porate American abuse kind of thing. But on
the movie itself— the script, the cast, the way
I wanted to shoot it, my editing— I didn't re
ally have a lot of interference. I think that was
the benefit of being the lowest-budget movie
at the studio ... but the downside of that is
"Dazed" was kind of the black sheep of the
family, that didn't get much attention when it
needs it. It's a trade-off."
He acknowledges that "Dazed" needed the
kind of backing that only a studio could pro
vide. "I couldn't have made this on any other
level — I needed the music rights, etc." Nor
does he romanticize his days as a guerrilla
filmmaker on "Slacker." "A film on that level
has another set of problems — they're differ
■ . . #t . , „
ent problems, but problems nonetheless.
Fortunately for us, Linklater triumphs over
the forces of eviL "At the end of the day,"he
says proudly, "I got to make my movie." And
in the dicey world of mass entertainment, he
can't ask for much more than that. ■
