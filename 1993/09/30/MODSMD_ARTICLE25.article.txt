# From Gaieties to Goldie – The work of Colin Higgins
## 
### Kyle Graham 
/ "m While working as a tennis
court sweeper and handy
y Y man to support himself, a
young UCLA film school student spent his
free time working on a screenplay. The
script, his master's thesis, involved the un
likely friendship and romance between a
death-obsessed young man and an older
lady who teaches him to enjoy life. Once his
work was completed, he showed the finished
product to his employer, a Paramount Stu
dios executive. The businessman purchased
the script in a weekend, and the young man
seemed well on his way to immediate suc
cess.
However, the ensuing film flopped.
Rushed into release when Paramount's other
late-1971 release, "The Godfather," ran be
hind schedule, the movie was unable to draw
crowds into the monumental theatres that
Paramount had booked for the larger, more
celebrated film. Despite excellent reviews
(Film Quarterly called it "one of the best
movies to come out of 1 lollywood in years"),
the screenwriter's first effort ended its intial
release as a financial fiasco.
This disastrous debut could have spelled
the end to both the movie in question and its
author's career. However, at this point, fate
took a strange twist. Slowly, audiences began
to warm to the quirky black comedy. In
smaller theatres, the film packed the house
for months — even years — at a time. One
Minneapolis theatre ran it for seven consec
utive years. Today, "Harold and Maude" is
considered one of the most-loved films of re
cent years.
Furthermore, its author, who in the
words of a friend, "couldn't get himself hired
in Hollywood after Harold and Maude, is

now often regarded as one of the last quar
ter-century's greatest comedic writers and
directors. Colin Higgins, who entered Stan
ford as a member of the Class of' 63, went on
to direct such films as "Silver Streak," "Foul
Play," "Nine to l ive" and"The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas," among others. Start
ing today and running through Saturday, the
English Department will honor Higgins and
his works with a film festival to be held
nightly at 7 and 9 p.m. in Cubberley Audito
rium.
W iggins, who died in 19K8, began
his writing career here at Stan-
M M ford, scripting the big Game Gai
eties. Also a skilled actor, he occasionally
took the stage at Gaieties, sometimes in the
role of Stanford freshman "Wilbur Hall."
While on the Farm, 11 iggins majored in Eng
lish and studied under noted professors such
as Wallace Stegner of the Creative Writing
Program.
After spending two years at Stanford, the
future screenwriter dropped out and eventu
ally began his creative-writing career as a
sports reporter for The Stars and Stripes.
"He knew very little about sports, but he fig
ured it was OK as long as he brought some
one along to explain the game to him," said
Higgins' mother, |oy. In addition, the young
sportswriter also found shortcuts in com
pleting his work: "He often cribbed what he
wrote from the daily papers, since they came
out daily and he wrote a weekly column,"
said James Rogers, Higgins' friend and head
of the Colin Higgins Foundation, based in
Los Angeles.
Following his discharge, Higgins re
turned to Stanford and completed his educa
tion. Later, he earned a master's at UCLA.
After his taste of both joyous success and ab
ject defeat with "Harold and Maude," Hig
gins was asked by English stage director Ru
pert Brook to write a play based on an an
thropological study of the Ik. This group of
nomads had been displaced from their tradi
tional lands and forced to resettle atop a
mountain, whereupon all of their social
bonds and familial ties disintegrated.
Though the finished work that 11 iggins pro
duced was widely praised, scripting the play
left Higgins emotionally drained. "The more
serious |a script was], the more difficult it
was for him, since he had to dig deep within
him to make dramas," commented Rogers.
Higgins then made an enormously suc
cessful television movie entitled "The Devil's
Daughter," which in turn earned him a bar
gain from studio executives. If Higgins

agreed

to write a

come d i c

screenplay

which proved

successful, he would

be given the opportuni

ty to both write and direct

an ensuing project. It was an
offer I iiggins couldn't refuse.

The work Higgins produced was
"Silver Streak," starring Gene Wilder

and Richard Pryor in their first silver

screen teaming. "Silver Streak" proved to be
a monster hit, and so I liggins was allowed to
direct his next effort, the San Francisco
based "Foul Play." Both works may roughly
be defined as "Comedic 1 litchcock"; the lat
ter movie's concert-hall finale mirrors that
of the British director's "The Man Who
Knew Too Much." However, in paying
homage to the master of suspense, Higgins
still managed to have fun — in the climax to
"Foul Play," the distinguished-looking lady
and gentleman in the concert hall's first row
are none other than the director's mother
and father.
In 1980, Higgins worked with Lily Tom
lin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton on "Nine to
Five." Two years later, he directed his last
film, "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."
Higgins completed his final production
in 1986, collaborating with Shirley
MacLaine on the 1986 television mini-series

"Out

on a

Limb."

However, he

left several pro
jects unfinished at

the time of his death.

Among these were a
screen adaptation of Geof

frey Chaucer's "Canterbury
Tales" and a screenplay entitled

"The Wizard's Fool."
In 1984, Higgins established a non-profit
foundation which bears his name. The
Foundation funds community-based
human rights and civil-liberties groups at a
rate of approximately 12 grants per year.
Furthermore, the Foundation sponsors sev
eral scholarships, including a graduate fel
lowship in Stanford's English Department.
Another cause of the Foundation involves
fighting the spread of AIDS, the disease that
claimed Higgins' life in 1988.
Stanford's festival of Higgins' films would
likely please the writer and director, Rogers
said. "All he wanted to do was make people
laugh and enjoy his movies. As long as they
would do that, he was happy.' ■

screen adaptation of Geof

frey Chaucer's "Canterbury
Tales" and a screenplay entitled

"The Wizard's Fool."
In 1984, Higgins established a non-profit
foundation which bears his name. The
Foundation funds community-based
human rights and civil-liberties groups at a
rate of approximately 12 grants per year.
Furthermore, the Foundation sponsors sev
eral scholarships, including a graduate fel
lowship in Stanford's English Department.
Another cause of the Foundation involves
fighting the spread of AIDS, the disease that
claimed Higgins' life in 1988.
Stanford's festival of Higgins' films would
likely please the writer and director, Rogers
said. "All he wanted to do was make people
laugh and enjoy his movies. As long as they
would do that, he was happy.' ■

/ "m While working as a tennis
court sweeper and handy
y Y man to support himself, a
young UCLA film school student spent his
free time working on a screenplay. The
script, his master's thesis, involved the un
likely friendship and romance between a
death-obsessed young man and an older
lady who teaches him to enjoy life. Once his
work was completed, he showed the finished
product to his employer, a Paramount Stu
dios executive. The businessman purchased
the script in a weekend, and the young man
seemed well on his way to immediate suc
cess.
However, the ensuing film flopped.
Rushed into release when Paramount's other
late-1971 release, "The Godfather," ran be
hind schedule, the movie was unable to draw
crowds into the monumental theatres that
Paramount had booked for the larger, more
celebrated film. Despite excellent reviews
(Film Quarterly called it "one of the best
movies to come out of 1 lollywood in years"),
the screenwriter's first effort ended its intial
release as a financial fiasco.
This disastrous debut could have spelled
the end to both the movie in question and its
author's career. However, at this point, fate
took a strange twist. Slowly, audiences began
to warm to the quirky black comedy. In
smaller theatres, the film packed the house
for months — even years — at a time. One
Minneapolis theatre ran it for seven consec
utive years. Today, "Harold and Maude" is
considered one of the most-loved films of re
cent years.
Furthermore, its author, who in the
words of a friend, "couldn't get himself hired
in Hollywood after Harold and Maude, is

now often regarded as one of the last quar
ter-century's greatest comedic writers and
directors. Colin Higgins, who entered Stan
ford as a member of the Class of' 63, went on
to direct such films as "Silver Streak," "Foul
Play," "Nine to l ive" and"The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas," among others. Start
ing today and running through Saturday, the
English Department will honor Higgins and
his works with a film festival to be held
nightly at 7 and 9 p.m. in Cubberley Audito
rium.
W iggins, who died in 19K8, began
his writing career here at Stan-
M M ford, scripting the big Game Gai
eties. Also a skilled actor, he occasionally
took the stage at Gaieties, sometimes in the
role of Stanford freshman "Wilbur Hall."
While on the Farm, 11 iggins majored in Eng
lish and studied under noted professors such
as Wallace Stegner of the Creative Writing
Program.
After spending two years at Stanford, the
future screenwriter dropped out and eventu
ally began his creative-writing career as a
sports reporter for The Stars and Stripes.
"He knew very little about sports, but he fig
ured it was OK as long as he brought some
one along to explain the game to him," said
Higgins' mother, |oy. In addition, the young
sportswriter also found shortcuts in com
pleting his work: "He often cribbed what he
wrote from the daily papers, since they came
out daily and he wrote a weekly column,"
said James Rogers, Higgins' friend and head
of the Colin Higgins Foundation, based in
Los Angeles.
Following his discharge, Higgins re
turned to Stanford and completed his educa
tion. Later, he earned a master's at UCLA.
After his taste of both joyous success and ab
ject defeat with "Harold and Maude," Hig
gins was asked by English stage director Ru
pert Brook to write a play based on an an
thropological study of the Ik. This group of
nomads had been displaced from their tradi
tional lands and forced to resettle atop a
mountain, whereupon all of their social
bonds and familial ties disintegrated.
Though the finished work that 11 iggins pro
duced was widely praised, scripting the play
left Higgins emotionally drained. "The more
serious |a script was], the more difficult it
was for him, since he had to dig deep within
him to make dramas," commented Rogers.
Higgins then made an enormously suc
cessful television movie entitled "The Devil's
Daughter," which in turn earned him a bar
gain from studio executives. If Higgins

agreed

to write a

come d i c

screenplay

which proved

successful, he would

be given the opportuni

ty to both write and direct

an ensuing project. It was an
offer I iiggins couldn't refuse.

The work Higgins produced was
"Silver Streak," starring Gene Wilder

and Richard Pryor in their first silver

screen teaming. "Silver Streak" proved to be
a monster hit, and so I liggins was allowed to
direct his next effort, the San Francisco
based "Foul Play." Both works may roughly
be defined as "Comedic 1 litchcock"; the lat
ter movie's concert-hall finale mirrors that
of the British director's "The Man Who
Knew Too Much." However, in paying
homage to the master of suspense, Higgins
still managed to have fun — in the climax to
"Foul Play," the distinguished-looking lady
and gentleman in the concert hall's first row
are none other than the director's mother
and father.
In 1980, Higgins worked with Lily Tom
lin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton on "Nine to
Five." Two years later, he directed his last
film, "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."
Higgins completed his final production
in 1986, collaborating with Shirley
MacLaine on the 1986 television mini-series

"Out

on a

Limb."

However, he

left several pro
jects unfinished at

the time of his death.

Among these were a
screen adaptation of Geof

frey Chaucer's "Canterbury
Tales" and a screenplay entitled

"The Wizard's Fool."
