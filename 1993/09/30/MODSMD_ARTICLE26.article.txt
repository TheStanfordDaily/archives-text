# Odd Men Out A Cinematic Longshot Of Olympic Proportions
## Slory by Victor Haseman Graphics by Dan Kim 
### 
A Walt Disney picture is what it is and
there's no getting around it — relent
lessly mushy, manipulative family fare.
Just the kind of schlock inquiring minds
don't want any part of. So why circle the the
ater for the 12th time looking for parking on
an overcrowded residential-meets-trendy
shopping district of San Francisco?
Curiosity, point blank.
Could Disney pull off a feels-groovy
sports-comedy about four brothers whose
one chance at Olympic gold hinges on their
success in a sport foreign to Jamaica's tropi
cal climate? More importantly, what movie
crowd in complete possession of their men
tal faculties would get themselves all hot and
bothered to go see it? Hey, we suffered
through (and some even enjoyed) Penny
Marshall's over-the-top, "play-ball" antics in
"A League of Their Own." Don't we owe the
true story of the first Jamaican Olympic
bobsled team, "Cool Runnings," at least as
much?
Lounging, looking only vaguely conspic
uous, in the choicely furnished lobby of
downtown San Francisco's Pan Pacific
Hotel, the smug ebony mugs of standup
comic-turned-actor Doug E. Doug and his
fresh-faced costar Rawle D. Lewis are search
ing for an excuse to break down a million
and one reasons why America owes their
project more.
Doug, with the dreads he's been cultivat
ing at least since his '91 film debut ("Hang
ing With the Homeboys") hidden almost
rough-neck style under a floppy fisherman's
cap, decides on one to set the ball rolling

down the hill.

"They're many
stories to

be told.
A s

ridiculous as a Jamaican bobsled movie
sounds, it did happen. You can't walk away
from it. It's a story that happened. It's a story
that's worthy of being told period. It's a piece
of black history."
After 13 times around the block, who's
thinking of anything profound? In fact,
guilt, dressed to the teeth in "colored peo
ple" time, doesn't even bother to rear its
nappy head 30 minutes after "Cool Run
nings" has begun, when someone finally de
cides to give up a parking space. But that has
more to do with the flick's episodic narra
tive. Within the first hour, any time's a good
time to jump right in. The 4-1-1 is simple.
Derice Bannock (Leon) a young sprinter
with Olympic dreams, chokes during his
qualifying heat. Refusing to toss in the towel,
he enlists the help of Sanka Coffie (Doug),
Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil
(Lewis) and ex-Olympian Irv (John Candy)
to put together an Olympic long-shot — a
bobsled team from a country that's never
known a harsh winter.
With a screenplay by Lynn Siefert,
Tommy Swerdlow and Michael Goldberg,
not to mention direction from Jon
Turteltaub of "3 Ninjas" fame, "Cool Run
nings" is Walt Disney filmed entertainment
at its most conventional. So why aren't audi
ences, even critical members who miss the
opening act, dissing it entirely?
"Our film is good," suggests Doug, "be
cause it's an alternative. It's not the regular
drug-ridden, ghetto urban film. Nobody
gets shot, nobody dies."
A suddenly animated Lewis adds, "No
body packs a forty in the sled," eliciting
hearty laughter from both interviewer and
interviewees. Seldom missing a beat, Doug
connects with the sobering counter, "And
nobody is pimp slapping a woman."
So went the late morning interview the

day after the parking fiasco.
Pleasant, equally joc

ular and se
rious

never stuffy. Both brothers were comfortable
with themselves and their surroundings.
Their bearings said veterans of the press jun
ket, even though the "Cool Runnings" tour
was Lewis' first and only Doug's second, or
possibly third. They were a classic team, re
lying on each other's energy for inspiration
in the traditional showbiz vein. And they
were friends.
Lewis' pre-"Cool Runnings" career was
low-key. Starting in his native Trinidad
he performed in children's theater under
the tutelage of his mother until they moved
to the U.S., eventually arriving in the City of
Angels where he continued his work in the
ater and occasionally won bit parts on televi
sion. But for the soft-spoken Lewis, acting

'As ridiculous as a
Jamaican bobsled movie
sounds, it did happen.
You can't walk away from
it. It's a story that
happened.'

was never a life-long dream, "It was always
just a fun thing to do, after I'd work a job.
You know, go in the evenings and do a play in
the theater.
"It didn't become a big deal until I moved
to L.A. and started acting. You're constantly
approached by agents who are like, 'You
know, there's a TV show here.' Then you re
alize how big a deal it is there. It's no longer
just a cute, fun thing to do."
Pausing to adjust his "Cool Runnings"
cap, Lewis recalled his early roles on shows
like "MacGyver" and "Bronx Zoo," with a
jaded cynicism reminiscent of many young
brothers and sisters involved in showbiz,
whose acting ambitions have yet to be real

izcd.
"I'd always get lines like
'More coffee, sir?' But I was proud

of those. As a matter of fact, this is my first
character where I had a first and last name.
Usually 1 was like, 'Haitian Workman.' So I
never really thought about (acting], I just
sort of did it. It's like breathing. You never re
ally think, 'Well I'm breathing now,' you just
do."
"I was a big trouble-maker in high
school," offered Doug in contrast. "I got
kicked out of 21 classes in one month."
Under threat of expulsion, a dean convinced
him to clean up his academic act and take his
"grand" sense of humor someplace where it
would cause him less trouble. "So I went to a
local comedy club and that's where I began
my stand-up comedy career."
After finishing up high school, Doug
went on to St. John's University, where he
continued to blossom as a personality on
New York's comedy circuit, until a chance
encounter with Spike Lee at the Apollo The
ater got him a bit part in "Mo' Better Blues."
"I went back to the bursar's office and
asked for my money back because |Spike]
said he was going to hook me up. He gave me
one line. He's a great guy."
Nice or not, working in "Mo' Better
Blues" was one of the many attributes that
eventually netted him his roles as Willie in
Joe Vasquez's "Hangin' With the Home
boys," "Class Act" and an assortment of
other commitments including his own ABC
show, "Where I Live." This last effort met
critical acclaim when it premiered in the
spring, and is scheduled to return next sea
son. Finally, he is planning a one-man show
destined to open in January.
"Is anything here writable?" Doug asks as
the presence of a hotel waitress breaks the
flow of the interview long enough to drag the
conversation from things promotional to
things nonsensical. To reiterate, Doug and
Lewis are friends, nay, pat'nas, in that "you
my nigga" sense that can throw concentra
tion to the four winds at the drop of a dime.
It's a fight not to throw in the serious jour
nalist hat and just chill. They're good people,
always ready to spend some studio's cash to
make the writer more comfortable, more at
ease, shaking the conversation of unneces
sary formality to cut to the chase.
"I liked the opportunity to work on a film

in New York. Shooting a film here... it's just
the energy of the city, is what it is." Doug re-
turns for a moment to "Hangin' With the
Homeboys," with a warmness that could
only be on the stream of consciousness tip.
He's just finished his poached salmon and
bagel with cream cheese. Food — the ulti-
mate sedative.
"It's alive. Also, it gave me an opportunity
to work at home. The whole film, in some
ways, has taken cult status. People watch the
film over and over again. It's a major, major
hit on video. In some ways it has helped my
career more than a lot of the other subse
quent opportunities that I've had. I'd like to
work with Joe Vasquez again cause he's a un-
talent/
Rj ever mind underrated. It's just hard to
11 find work as a director when you're of
color, but not Spike Lee and John Sin-
gleton — and everybody knows it, especially
Lewis and Doug.
"That is the problem," declares Doug.
"For the most part, some people are dubbed
'black filmmakers' and then opportunities
aren't extended to people who are, if not as
talented, even more so. People like Wendell
B. Harris, people like Charles Burnet. White
directors always get opportunities to fail and
fail and fail and fail. Black filmmakers must
bring commercial success to their project or
they're eliminated."

All at the table are in agreement that di
rectors of color need time to develop, to
grow and that two or three films are not a
body of work. Francis Coppola, Woody
Allen, Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese
have made between 10 to 20 films apiece,
They're the cinematic giants of our era.
Spike and John with their collective eight are
our "Arrogant Black Hope." This paucity of
new films reflects why Doug and Lewis are so
proud of their work in "Cool Runnings." Re-

member, they feel it's alternative black enter
tainmcnt.
No guns, no blood, no bitches, no hoes.
"Some of the characters have antagonistic
relationships," cautions Doug. "But it's not
rooted in violence, but in misunderstand
ings. Those were the human things we want
ed to share. Not everyone has a dispute with

their friend and whips out a gun and shoots
them. That's animalistic. That is brute. And
that is typical these days of black males in
film"

"A fine film for example," continues
Doug his blazing eyes staring down
from an imaginary soap box six feet
high, "was 'What's Love Go to Do With
It.' It was a good piece of work, but

here, once again, was a black male thrust
ed into a situation where he is once again
an animal. Larry Fishburne pulls Angela

Bassett by the hair. All we need is a loin cloth
and a club an we're back to prehistoric
times.
"For the most part, when we're given op
portunities to do something a little different,
it's usually the same. So here we are with this
film giving people the opportunity to see
four black men that arc heroes. And even
with all of the distractions, like silly names
(Sanka Coffie, Yul Brenner) and all the other
things, rooted underneath are some really
good intentions — some really purposeful
movie making."
Perhaps this idea, less tangible than real, is
what will carry "Cool Runnings" past its
opening weekend. But we can't forget too
soon the purposeful filmmaking beneath the
hokey exterior of Robert Townsend's "Mete
or Man." All the brightest and biggest inten
tions in the world couldn't conspire to carry
homcboy's "black superfriends" past its
hideous opening weekend. Still, Doug and
Lewis remain optimistic, convinced that it
was the kryptonite of poor publicity that
dealt the ethnic avenger its mortal blow.
To let Doug and Lewis tell it, "Cool
Runnings" has "more purpose and
more honorable intentions than all the
black films that have been released this
year. They'll never be another Jamaica
bobsled movie. But there will be another

drug
ridden
ghetto

urban
film. There

was one last
week on
HBO and

there will be one
next week and
next year."

Strong words for a film
nowhere near perfection.

Strong words, but likely
well-founded words. What
"Cool Runnings" needs is a

publicity steroid. Disney has been

very energetic in pushing the film,
staging about as good a media blitz as

"Aladdin" or "Sleeping Beauty" or any of
their other wildly successful animated fea
tures that have sold themselves. Realistically,
the fact that "Cool Runnings" is a family film
with mostly black characters isn't necessarily
a good thing. To convince families that its the
wholesome feature of fall they've been wait
ing for, the Jamaican bobsleders talc will need
a bite the size of a polar bear.
Let's hope everyone knows what they're
up against. ■

brothers and sisters involved in showbiz,
whose acting ambitions have yet to be real

izcd.
"I'd always get lines like
'More coffee, sir?' But I was proud

of those. As a matter of fact, this is my first
character where I had a first and last name.
Usually 1 was like, 'Haitian Workman.' So I
never really thought about (acting], I just
sort of did it. It's like breathing. You never re
ally think, 'Well I'm breathing now,' you just
do."
"I was a big trouble-maker in high
school," offered Doug in contrast. "I got
kicked out of 21 classes in one month."
Under threat of expulsion, a dean convinced
him to clean up his academic act and take his
"grand" sense of humor someplace where it
would cause him less trouble. "So I went to a
local comedy club and that's where I began
my stand-up comedy career."
After finishing up high school, Doug
went on to St. John's University, where he
continued to blossom as a personality on
New York's comedy circuit, until a chance
encounter with Spike Lee at the Apollo The
ater got him a bit part in "Mo' Better Blues."
"I went back to the bursar's office and
asked for my money back because |Spike]
said he was going to hook me up. He gave me
one line. He's a great guy."
Nice or not, working in "Mo' Better
Blues" was one of the many attributes that
eventually netted him his roles as Willie in
Joe Vasquez's "Hangin' With the Home
boys," "Class Act" and an assortment of
other commitments including his own ABC
show, "Where I Live." This last effort met
critical acclaim when it premiered in the
spring, and is scheduled to return next sea
son. Finally, he is planning a one-man show
destined to open in January.
"Is anything here writable?" Doug asks as
the presence of a hotel waitress breaks the
flow of the interview long enough to drag the
conversation from things promotional to
things nonsensical. To reiterate, Doug and
Lewis are friends, nay, pat'nas, in that "you
my nigga" sense that can throw concentra
tion to the four winds at the drop of a dime.
It's a fight not to throw in the serious jour
nalist hat and just chill. They're good people,
always ready to spend some studio's cash to
make the writer more comfortable, more at
ease, shaking the conversation of unneces
sary formality to cut to the chase.
"I liked the opportunity to work on a film

in New York. Shooting a film here... it's just
the energy of the city, is what it is." Doug re-
turns for a moment to "Hangin' With the
Homeboys," with a warmness that could
only be on the stream of consciousness tip.
He's just finished his poached salmon and
bagel with cream cheese. Food — the ulti-
mate sedative.
"It's alive. Also, it gave me an opportunity
to work at home. The whole film, in some
ways, has taken cult status. People watch the
film over and over again. It's a major, major
hit on video. In some ways it has helped my
career more than a lot of the other subse
quent opportunities that I've had. I'd like to
work with Joe Vasquez again cause he's a un-
talent/
Rj ever mind underrated. It's just hard to
11 find work as a director when you're of
color, but not Spike Lee and John Sin-
gleton — and everybody knows it, especially
Lewis and Doug.
"That is the problem," declares Doug.
"For the most part, some people are dubbed
'black filmmakers' and then opportunities
aren't extended to people who are, if not as
talented, even more so. People like Wendell
B. Harris, people like Charles Burnet. White
directors always get opportunities to fail and
fail and fail and fail. Black filmmakers must
bring commercial success to their project or
they're eliminated."

All at the table are in agreement that di
rectors of color need time to develop, to
grow and that two or three films are not a
body of work. Francis Coppola, Woody
Allen, Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese
have made between 10 to 20 films apiece,
They're the cinematic giants of our era.
Spike and John with their collective eight are
our "Arrogant Black Hope." This paucity of
new films reflects why Doug and Lewis are so
proud of their work in "Cool Runnings." Re-

member, they feel it's alternative black enter
tainmcnt.
No guns, no blood, no bitches, no hoes.
"Some of the characters have antagonistic
relationships," cautions Doug. "But it's not
rooted in violence, but in misunderstand
ings. Those were the human things we want
ed to share. Not everyone has a dispute with

their friend and whips out a gun and shoots
them. That's animalistic. That is brute. And
that is typical these days of black males in
film"

"A fine film for example," continues
Doug his blazing eyes staring down
from an imaginary soap box six feet
high, "was 'What's Love Go to Do With
It.' It was a good piece of work, but

here, once again, was a black male thrust
ed into a situation where he is once again
an animal. Larry Fishburne pulls Angela

Bassett by the hair. All we need is a loin cloth
and a club an we're back to prehistoric
times.
"For the most part, when we're given op
portunities to do something a little different,
it's usually the same. So here we are with this
film giving people the opportunity to see
four black men that arc heroes. And even
with all of the distractions, like silly names
(Sanka Coffie, Yul Brenner) and all the other
things, rooted underneath are some really
good intentions — some really purposeful
movie making."
Perhaps this idea, less tangible than real, is
what will carry "Cool Runnings" past its
opening weekend. But we can't forget too
soon the purposeful filmmaking beneath the
hokey exterior of Robert Townsend's "Mete
or Man." All the brightest and biggest inten
tions in the world couldn't conspire to carry
homcboy's "black superfriends" past its
hideous opening weekend. Still, Doug and
Lewis remain optimistic, convinced that it
was the kryptonite of poor publicity that
dealt the ethnic avenger its mortal blow.
To let Doug and Lewis tell it, "Cool
Runnings" has "more purpose and
more honorable intentions than all the
black films that have been released this
year. They'll never be another Jamaica
bobsled movie. But there will be another

drug
ridden
ghetto

urban
film. There

was one last
week on
HBO and

there will be one
next week and
next year."

Strong words for a film
nowhere near perfection.

Strong words, but likely
well-founded words. What
"Cool Runnings" needs is a

publicity steroid. Disney has been

very energetic in pushing the film,
staging about as good a media blitz as

"Aladdin" or "Sleeping Beauty" or any of
their other wildly successful animated fea
tures that have sold themselves. Realistically,
the fact that "Cool Runnings" is a family film
with mostly black characters isn't necessarily
a good thing. To convince families that its the
wholesome feature of fall they've been wait
ing for, the Jamaican bobsleders talc will need
a bite the size of a polar bear.
Let's hope everyone knows what they're
up against. ■

A Walt Disney picture is what it is and
there's no getting around it — relent
lessly mushy, manipulative family fare.
Just the kind of schlock inquiring minds
don't want any part of. So why circle the the
ater for the 12th time looking for parking on
an overcrowded residential-meets-trendy
shopping district of San Francisco?
Curiosity, point blank.
Could Disney pull off a feels-groovy
sports-comedy about four brothers whose
one chance at Olympic gold hinges on their
success in a sport foreign to Jamaica's tropi
cal climate? More importantly, what movie
crowd in complete possession of their men
tal faculties would get themselves all hot and
bothered to go see it? Hey, we suffered
through (and some even enjoyed) Penny
Marshall's over-the-top, "play-ball" antics in
"A League of Their Own." Don't we owe the
true story of the first Jamaican Olympic
bobsled team, "Cool Runnings," at least as
much?
Lounging, looking only vaguely conspic
uous, in the choicely furnished lobby of
downtown San Francisco's Pan Pacific
Hotel, the smug ebony mugs of standup
comic-turned-actor Doug E. Doug and his
fresh-faced costar Rawle D. Lewis are search
ing for an excuse to break down a million
and one reasons why America owes their
project more.
Doug, with the dreads he's been cultivat
ing at least since his '91 film debut ("Hang
ing With the Homeboys") hidden almost
rough-neck style under a floppy fisherman's
cap, decides on one to set the ball rolling

down the hill.

"They're many
stories to

be told.
A s

ridiculous as a Jamaican bobsled movie
sounds, it did happen. You can't walk away
from it. It's a story that happened. It's a story
that's worthy of being told period. It's a piece
of black history."
After 13 times around the block, who's
thinking of anything profound? In fact,
guilt, dressed to the teeth in "colored peo
ple" time, doesn't even bother to rear its
nappy head 30 minutes after "Cool Run
nings" has begun, when someone finally de
cides to give up a parking space. But that has
more to do with the flick's episodic narra
tive. Within the first hour, any time's a good
time to jump right in. The 4-1-1 is simple.
Derice Bannock (Leon) a young sprinter
with Olympic dreams, chokes during his
qualifying heat. Refusing to toss in the towel,
he enlists the help of Sanka Coffie (Doug),
Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil
(Lewis) and ex-Olympian Irv (John Candy)
to put together an Olympic long-shot — a
bobsled team from a country that's never
known a harsh winter.
With a screenplay by Lynn Siefert,
Tommy Swerdlow and Michael Goldberg,
not to mention direction from Jon
Turteltaub of "3 Ninjas" fame, "Cool Run
nings" is Walt Disney filmed entertainment
at its most conventional. So why aren't audi
ences, even critical members who miss the
opening act, dissing it entirely?
"Our film is good," suggests Doug, "be
cause it's an alternative. It's not the regular
drug-ridden, ghetto urban film. Nobody
gets shot, nobody dies."
A suddenly animated Lewis adds, "No
body packs a forty in the sled," eliciting
hearty laughter from both interviewer and
interviewees. Seldom missing a beat, Doug
connects with the sobering counter, "And
nobody is pimp slapping a woman."
So went the late morning interview the

day after the parking fiasco.
Pleasant, equally joc

ular and se
rious

never stuffy. Both brothers were comfortable
with themselves and their surroundings.
Their bearings said veterans of the press jun
ket, even though the "Cool Runnings" tour
was Lewis' first and only Doug's second, or
possibly third. They were a classic team, re
lying on each other's energy for inspiration
in the traditional showbiz vein. And they
were friends.
Lewis' pre-"Cool Runnings" career was
low-key. Starting in his native Trinidad
he performed in children's theater under
the tutelage of his mother until they moved
to the U.S., eventually arriving in the City of
Angels where he continued his work in the
ater and occasionally won bit parts on televi
sion. But for the soft-spoken Lewis, acting

'As ridiculous as a
Jamaican bobsled movie
sounds, it did happen.
You can't walk away from
it. It's a story that
happened.'

was never a life-long dream, "It was always
just a fun thing to do, after I'd work a job.
You know, go in the evenings and do a play in
the theater.
"It didn't become a big deal until I moved
to L.A. and started acting. You're constantly
approached by agents who are like, 'You
know, there's a TV show here.' Then you re
alize how big a deal it is there. It's no longer
just a cute, fun thing to do."
Pausing to adjust his "Cool Runnings"
cap, Lewis recalled his early roles on shows
like "MacGyver" and "Bronx Zoo," with a
jaded cynicism reminiscent of many young
brothers and sisters involved in showbiz,
whose acting ambitions have yet to be real

izcd.
"I'd always get lines like
'More coffee, sir?' But I was proud

of those. As a matter of fact, this is my first

high, "was 'What's Love Go to Do With
It.' It was a good piece of work, but

here, once again, was a black male thrust
ed into a situation where he is once again
an animal. Larry Fishburne pulls Angela

Bassett by the hair. All we need is a loin cloth

times.
"For the most part, when we're given op
portunities to do something a little different,
it's usually the same. So here we are with this
film giving people the opportunity to see
four black men that arc heroes. And even
with all of the distractions, like silly names
(Sanka Coffie, Yul Brenner) and all the other
things, rooted underneath are some really
good intentions — some really purposeful
movie making."
Perhaps this idea, less tangible than real, is
what will carry "Cool Runnings" past its
opening weekend. But we can't forget too
soon the purposeful filmmaking beneath the
hokey exterior of Robert Townsend's "Mete
or Man." All the brightest and biggest inten
tions in the world couldn't conspire to carry
homcboy's "black superfriends" past its
hideous opening weekend. Still, Doug and
Lewis remain optimistic, convinced that it
was the kryptonite of poor publicity that
dealt the ethnic avenger its mortal blow.
To let Doug and Lewis tell it, "Cool
Runnings" has "more purpose and
more honorable intentions than all the
black films that have been released this
year. They'll never be another Jamaica
bobsled movie. But there will be another

drug
ridden
ghetto

urban
film. There

was one last
week on
HBO and

there will be one
next week and
next year."

Strong words for a film
nowhere near perfection.

Strong words, but likely
well-founded words. What
"Cool Runnings" needs is a

publicity steroid. Disney has been

very energetic in pushing the film,
staging about as good a media blitz as

"Aladdin" or "Sleeping Beauty" or any of
their other wildly successful animated fea
tures that have sold themselves. Realistically,
the fact that "Cool Runnings" is a family film
with mostly black characters isn't necessarily
a good thing. To convince families that its the
wholesome feature of fall they've been wait
ing for, the Jamaican bobsleders talc will need
a bite the size of a polar bear.
Let's hope everyone knows what they're
up against. ■

A Walt Disney picture is what it is and
there's no getting around it — relent
lessly mushy, manipulative family fare.
Just the kind of schlock inquiring minds
don't want any part of. So why circle the the
ater for the 12th time looking for parking on
an overcrowded residential-meets-trendy
shopping district of San Francisco?
Curiosity, point blank.
Could Disney pull off a feels-groovy
sports-comedy about four brothers whose
one chance at Olympic gold hinges on their
success in a sport foreign to Jamaica's tropi
cal climate? More importantly, what movie
crowd in complete possession of their men
tal faculties would get themselves all hot and
bothered to go see it? Hey, we suffered
through (and some even enjoyed) Penny
Marshall's over-the-top, "play-ball" antics in
"A League of Their Own." Don't we owe the
true story of the first Jamaican Olympic
bobsled team, "Cool Runnings," at least as
much?
Lounging, looking only vaguely conspic
uous, in the choicely furnished lobby of
downtown San Francisco's Pan Pacific
Hotel, the smug ebony mugs of standup
comic-turned-actor Doug E. Doug and his
fresh-faced costar Rawle D. Lewis are search
ing for an excuse to break down a million
and one reasons why America owes their
project more.
Doug, with the dreads he's been cultivat
ing at least since his '91 film debut ("Hang
ing With the Homeboys") hidden almost
rough-neck style under a floppy fisherman's
cap, decides on one to set the ball rolling

down the hill.

"They're many
stories to

be told.
A s

ridiculous as a Jamaican bobsled movie
sounds, it did happen. You can't walk away
from it. It's a story that happened. It's a story
that's worthy of being told period. It's a piece
of black history."
After 13 times around the block, who's
thinking of anything profound? In fact,
guilt, dressed to the teeth in "colored peo
ple" time, doesn't even bother to rear its
nappy head 30 minutes after "Cool Run
nings" has begun, when someone finally de
cides to give up a parking space. But that has
more to do with the flick's episodic narra
tive. Within the first hour, any time's a good
time to jump right in. The 4-1-1 is simple.
Derice Bannock (Leon) a young sprinter
with Olympic dreams, chokes during his
qualifying heat. Refusing to toss in the towel,
he enlists the help of Sanka Coffie (Doug),
Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil
(Lewis) and ex-Olympian Irv (John Candy)
to put together an Olympic long-shot — a
bobsled team from a country that's never
known a harsh winter.
With a screenplay by Lynn Siefert,
Tommy Swerdlow and Michael Goldberg,
not to mention direction from Jon
Turteltaub of "3 Ninjas" fame, "Cool Run
nings" is Walt Disney filmed entertainment
at its most conventional. So why aren't audi
ences, even critical members who miss the
opening act, dissing it entirely?
"Our film is good," suggests Doug, "be
cause it's an alternative. It's not the regular
drug-ridden, ghetto urban film. Nobody
gets shot, nobody dies."
A suddenly animated Lewis adds, "No
body packs a forty in the sled," eliciting
hearty laughter from both interviewer and
interviewees. Seldom missing a beat, Doug
connects with the sobering counter, "And
nobody is pimp slapping a woman."
So went the late morning interview the

day after the parking fiasco.
Pleasant, equally joc

ular and se
rious

never stuffy. Both brothers were comfortable
with themselves and their surroundings.
Their bearings said veterans of the press jun
ket, even though the "Cool Runnings" tour
was Lewis' first and only Doug's second, or
possibly third. They were a classic team, re
lying on each other's energy for inspiration
in the traditional showbiz vein. And they
were friends.
Lewis' pre-"Cool Runnings" career was
low-key. Starting in his native Trinidad
he performed in children's theater under
the tutelage of his mother until they moved
to the U.S., eventually arriving in the City of
Angels where he continued his work in the
ater and occasionally won bit parts on televi
sion. But for the soft-spoken Lewis, acting

'As ridiculous as a
Jamaican bobsled movie
sounds, it did happen.
You can't walk away from
it. It's a story that
happened.'

was never a life-long dream, "It was always
just a fun thing to do, after I'd work a job.
You know, go in the evenings and do a play in
the theater.
"It didn't become a big deal until I moved
to L.A. and started acting. You're constantly
approached by agents who are like, 'You
know, there's a TV show here.' Then you re
alize how big a deal it is there. It's no longer
just a cute, fun thing to do."
Pausing to adjust his "Cool Runnings"
cap, Lewis recalled his early roles on shows
like "MacGyver" and "Bronx Zoo," with a
jaded cynicism reminiscent of many young
brothers and sisters involved in showbiz,
whose acting ambitions have yet to be real

izcd.
"I'd always get lines like
'More coffee, sir?' But I was proud

of those. As a matter of fact, this is my first
character where I had a first and last name.
Usually 1 was like, 'Haitian Workman.' So I
never really thought about (acting], I just
sort of did it. It's like breathing. You never re
ally think, 'Well I'm breathing now,' you just
do."
"I was a big trouble-maker in high
school," offered Doug in contrast. "I got
kicked out of 21 classes in one month."
Under threat of expulsion, a dean convinced
him to clean up his academic act and take his
"grand" sense of humor someplace where it
would cause him less trouble. "So I went to a
local comedy club and that's where I began
my stand-up comedy career."
After finishing up high school, Doug
went on to St. John's University, where he
continued to blossom as a personality on
New York's comedy circuit, until a chance
encounter with Spike Lee at the Apollo The
ater got him a bit part in "Mo' Better Blues."
"I went back to the bursar's office and
asked for my money back because |Spike]
said he was going to hook me up. He gave me
one line. He's a great guy."
Nice or not, working in "Mo' Better
Blues" was one of the many attributes that
eventually netted him his roles as Willie in
Joe Vasquez's "Hangin' With the Home
boys," "Class Act" and an assortment of
other commitments including his own ABC
show, "Where I Live." This last effort met
critical acclaim when it premiered in the
spring, and is scheduled to return next sea
son. Finally, he is planning a one-man show
destined to open in January.
"Is anything here writable?" Doug asks as
the presence of a hotel waitress breaks the
flow of the interview long enough to drag the
conversation from things promotional to
things nonsensical. To reiterate, Doug and
Lewis are friends, nay, pat'nas, in that "you
my nigga" sense that can throw concentra
tion to the four winds at the drop of a dime.
It's a fight not to throw in the serious jour
nalist hat and just chill. They're good people,
always ready to spend some studio's cash to
make the writer more comfortable, more at
ease, shaking the conversation of unneces
sary formality to cut to the chase.
"I liked the opportunity to work on a film

in New York. Shooting a film here... it's just
the energy of the city, is what it is." Doug re-
turns for a moment to "Hangin' With the
Homeboys," with a warmness that could
only be on the stream of consciousness tip.
He's just finished his poached salmon and
bagel with cream cheese. Food — the ulti-
mate sedative.
"It's alive. Also, it gave me an opportunity
to work at home. The whole film, in some
ways, has taken cult status. People watch the
film over and over again. It's a major, major
hit on video. In some ways it has helped my
career more than a lot of the other subse
quent opportunities that I've had. I'd like to
work with Joe Vasquez again cause he's a un-
talent/
Rj ever mind underrated. It's just hard to
11 find work as a director when you're of
color, but not Spike Lee and John Sin-
gleton — and everybody knows it, especially
Lewis and Doug.
"That is the problem," declares Doug.
"For the most part, some people are dubbed
'black filmmakers' and then opportunities
aren't extended to people who are, if not as
talented, even more so. People like Wendell
B. Harris, people like Charles Burnet. White
directors always get opportunities to fail and
fail and fail and fail. Black filmmakers must
bring commercial success to their project or
they're eliminated."

All at the table are in agreement that di
rectors of color need time to develop, to
grow and that two or three films are not a
body of work. Francis Coppola, Woody
Allen, Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese
have made between 10 to 20 films apiece,
They're the cinematic giants of our era.
Spike and John with their collective eight are
our "Arrogant Black Hope." This paucity of
new films reflects why Doug and Lewis are so
proud of their work in "Cool Runnings." Re-

member, they feel it's alternative black enter
tainmcnt.
No guns, no blood, no bitches, no hoes.
"Some of the characters have antagonistic
relationships," cautions Doug. "But it's not
rooted in violence, but in misunderstand
ings. Those were the human things we want
ed to share. Not everyone has a dispute with

their friend and whips out a gun and shoots
them. That's animalistic. That is brute. And
that is typical these days of black males in
film"

"A fine film for example," continues
Doug his blazing eyes staring down
from an imaginary soap box six feet
high, "was 'What's Love Go to Do With
It.' It was a good piece of work, but

here, once again, was a black male thrust
