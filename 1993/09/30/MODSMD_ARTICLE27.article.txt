# The 						retro days of summer
## Richard Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused' is cool, way cool 
### 
With numerous scenes of men smoking
dope, women chugging beer and a perpetual
ly stoned class clown snapping into a brief
moment of lucidity to insist that George and
Martha Washington grew marijuana side by
side with their cherry trees, there's just no
doubt about it — Nancy Reagan would hate
this film.
Writer-director Richard Linklater, who
burst onto the filmmaking scene in 1991 with
"Slacker," goes back to the future, circa 1970,
to deliver a sly rebuke to the hypocritical
morality of the "Me" decade. During the '80s,

films about young adults degenerated into
bland, suburban wish-fulfillment, d la "Ferris
Bueller's Day Off" and "Some Kind of Won
derful." But it may be time for us to give the
genre another chance.
Linklater's sophomore effort, "Dazed and
Confused" arrives amid the increasing popu
larity of all things '70s. But he resists the facile
assumptions of such generation-defining
films as "American Graffiti" and "Singles."
Instead, Linklater concentrates on capturing
the essence of his own high-school experi
ences, leaving us to draw our own conclu

sions — and resuscitating the teen-angst
genre in the process.
The result is a hybrid of Robert Altman's
multi-character portrait "Nashville" and
Spike Lee's "School Daze" — for white peo
ple. The film opens at the end of the school
year, with the soon-to-be seniors salivating at
the thought of initiating next year's crop of
freshmen. Armed with their imitation
Gamma Phi Gamma paddles, the men prowl
the streets of suburbia looking for ripe fresh
man posterior to harvest ... while their fe
male counterparts get themselves a bushel of
"bitches" to cover with assorted food prod
ucts. Those who aren't cool enough to haze or
be hazed cither plan keg parties, get stoned or
deconstruct the behavior of the hazers, party
planners and stoners around them.
Still, people from different cliques interact
in other ways than fistfights and insults — re
member, this isn't the socially segregated
campus of a John Hughes '80s teen flick.
We're in 1976 West Texas, 200 years after
American Independence, six years after the
decade of idealism ended and four years be
fore the dawn of the decade of materialism;
the problems teens faced are depicted differ
ently than in a Hughes film, and a Saturday of
detention with complete strangers or a rous
ing rendition of "Twist and Shout" won't
solve them.
Randy "Pink" Floyd, a junior and star
quarterback, must decide whether he'll sign
the administration-imposed team pledge not
to use drugs or alcohol, or risk being kicked
off the team. Mitch has to navigate the tran
sition to senior high as the juniors single him

out for their hazing bccause of his popular
older sister. Sabrina accepts the abuse but has
second thoughts about what it means to be
"cool." Slater wants to find another joint and
smoke it. Mike tries to psyche himself up to
take on his white-trash antagonist, Wooder
son graduated years ago but uses his "bad
ass" car to recapture his high school experi
ence and Cynthia, a nerdy junior, is starting
to look awfully good.
All of these subplots sound like the mak
ings of a night in "Beverly Hills, 90210," but
writer-director Linklater pulls it off with
seeming ease, submerging the various con
flicts beneath a screenplay filled with enter
taining dialogue. He's aided and abetted by a
cast composed largely of young unknowns
who reel off their lines with a naturalism that
complements his unobtrusive, near-docu
mentary style.
This isn't the "Don't hate me bccause I'm
beautiful" crowd; each member of the
"Dazed" cast has a look that's off-kilter
enough for them to pass as recognizable
human beings, and that's refreshing in a film
of such commercial potential.
Unlike such recent generational films as
"Indian Summer" and "Calendar Girl,"
"Dazed and Confused" refuses to wallow in
nostalgia. The film may be set in the '70s, but
it's pitched squarely at a '90s audience — a
vital, witty and reflective look at a maligned
sub-section of American history. Teenage
angst may have paid off well for Richard Lin
klater, but we'll never get old and bored as
long as he keeps turning out films like this.

human beings, and that's refreshing in a film
of such commercial potential.
Unlike such recent generational films as
"Indian Summer" and "Calendar Girl,"
"Dazed and Confused" refuses to wallow in
nostalgia. The film may be set in the '70s, but
it's pitched squarely at a '90s audience — a
vital, witty and reflective look at a maligned
sub-section of American history. Teenage
angst may have paid off well for Richard Lin
klater, but we'll never get old and bored as
long as he keeps turning out films like this.
