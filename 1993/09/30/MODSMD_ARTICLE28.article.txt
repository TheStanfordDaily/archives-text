## For Love or Money 
### 
Underfed coquette and tango partner of
Al Pacino in "Scent of a Woman," Gabrielle
Anwar didn't say much in that minuscule
part — and for good reason. She can't act. AT
ALL.
Her brutalizing performance in "For Love
Or Money," along with pedestrian humor
and a limp storyline, topple Michael J. Fox's
best efforts to pull off typical summer fluff
that's not even good fluff and only intermit
tently funny.
Fox plays yet another money-grubber who
can't help being a likable guy: he's a concierge
at a posh New York hotel who wants to ditch
the job and start his own five-star place on

Roosevelt Island.
Unfortunately,
he's got to deal with a
typical British bad
guy named Christian
Hanover who has the
cash to get the build
ing started.
Fox, who hasn't
changed one bit
since his days on
"Family Ties," is ac
tually semi-funny
and is able to grab

the audience's laughter. But stock plot de
vices and Anwar's high-school-level perfor
mance as a perfume pusher make Fox look
like he's desperately trying to revive a rapid
ly dying patient about halfway through the
film.
Barry Sonncnfeld ("The Addams Fami
ly") knows how to direct with a squeaky
clean Hollywood style, but with a slightly
weird twist that feels promising. But the ma
terial is so old and tired Sonnenfeld can't kick
it into shape or keep the tone consistent. One
moment we see Fox playing Spiderman with
a barely clothed Anwar at some chic dinner
party, and the next we're supposed to feel the
emotional agony of his choosing between
love and wampum.
As for the moral dilemma in the movie's
title, it's hard to take seriously with all the
cheesy jokes and plaster characters. Fox is a
likable little chipmunk with the emotional
range of Mr. Rogers. Anwar's character is
easy on the eyes, sings jazz songs and wears
tight little dresses, but possesses the brain of
a gnat. She seems so dull you begin to wonder
how she found her way to the audition for
this thing.
Fox, however, manages to survive this film
with his comedic WASP persona intact. Just
let your brain run along elsewhere before you
sit down for this one.
