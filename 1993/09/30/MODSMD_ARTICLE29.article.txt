# The
						Joy Luck Club

### 
As much a woman's movie as a Chinese/Chi
ncse-Amcrican one, "The Joy Laiclc Club" is dif
ficult to distinguish as one or the other. The
moving and gorgeous adaptation of Amy Tin's
best-selling novel speaks richly and often
painfully of being Asian, being female and the
unique experience of being both.
A series of interrelated vignettes, the film
tells the stories of four young Chincse-Amer
ican women and their four Chinese mothers
who make up "The Joy Luck Club," a mah
jongg group. We arc offered a window into
each of the eight main characters' lives as
events in the course of one evening trigger a
heartrending flood of memories and tears.
Many, including Tan herself, doubted that
the novel — 16 stories woven together like a
complex tapestry — could ever be converted
into a motion picture. But largely because of
Tan's close involvement as co-screenplay
writer and a producer (not to mention a tiny
cameo role), the movie successfully condens
es the stories without losing their essence,
while brilliantly tying them together.
The film is beautiful — almost to distrac
tion. The sets, costumes and actresses are im
maculate and stunning, giving the film an ex
oticized if not grandiose aura. Both these qual
ities will likely guarantee "The Joy Luck Club"

a placc among I lollywood succcss stories.
However, the filmmakers have created a
product that is almost too clean at times,
overlooking the power of grit and grime
without the silver screen sheen — especially
during scenes in war-torn historical China.
Director Wayne Wang ("Dim Sum" and
"Eat a Bowl of Tea"), the remarkable Asian-
American leading actresses and a supporting
cast of epic proportions will finally garner the
recognition they have long sought and de
served in an industry that previously did not
offer them opportunities of this quality and
visibility.
Hopefully, "The Joy Luck Club" will not go
down in movie history as the comprehensive
Asian-American woman's movie, but instead
will pave the way for new and different Asian-
American stories, perspectives and faces.
