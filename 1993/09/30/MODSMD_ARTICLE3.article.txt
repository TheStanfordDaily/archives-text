# New sex harassment policy sent to Fac Sen
## Revised draft 'a significant improvement' 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
After two years of painstaking revisions
and deliberations, a revised draft of the Uni
versity's sexual harassment policy will be pre
sented to the Faculty Senate today for its en
dorsement.
The new version contains a stronger confi
dentiality clause and more specific guidelines
on how to address grievances. If approved in
its current form by the University Cabinet,
the policy will be enacted for a two-year trial
basis.
The previous version, presented to the sen
ate last spring, was augmented in several
ways over the summer by a specially chosen
senate steering committee.
"The revised version is much improved
(from the one that was submitted last spring)
and I hope it will be supported," said Biology
Prof. Patricia Jones, chair of the Faculty Sen

ate.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl, who ex
pressed several concerns to the senate in May
about the first draft, agreed that the current
draft is better.
"The original was not strong enough and
not clear enough about what to do if you were
being harassed," Karl said.
"I think the new draft is a significant im
provement," she said. "It's clearer, more
forceful, and it gives better weight to Informal
procedures, which research has shown is one
of the most effective ways to deal with sexual
harassment."
The updated draft has made the Universi
ty's stance on complainant anonymity more
specific, with a detailed pledge that upon con
sulting any sexual harassment adviser, "no
records will be kept, and no steps will be taken
that identify the person requesting advice â€”
unless and until that person states
in writing that the University may
take such steps."
When the draft was first pre
sented in May, senate members
endorsed the document condition
ally, raising concerns about ambi
guities in the draft and about
whether there would be effective
methods to evaluate the policy
once it went into effect. The senate
suggested that discussion on the
draft continue over the summer,
and that the draft be presented in
the fall for a final endorsement.
Last year, University President
Gerhard Casper had set a deadline
of the end of the 1992-93 academic
year for the completion of the offi
cial polity. Although receiving the
final senate endorsement would

mean extending that deadline,
Education Prof. Myra Strober said
in May that she hoped Casper
would be willing to wait until
today's meeting.
Also in May, Karl had expressed
concern about the draft's state
ment that "every effort will be
made to protect confidentiality,"
claiming it was too vague and left
little assurance for complainants.
The current policy draft does
not guarantee full anonymity, but
states that "the more information
the complainant can provide, the
more likely it is that a full investi
gation can be conducted effective
ly." The policy draft does allow
names to be divulged under a sub
poena or when dealing with securi
ty clearances or professional
licenses.
Detailed definitions of key
terms such as charges and "more
serious complaints," as well as the
difference between informal and

formal resolutions, have also been
provided.
In addition, the draft elaborates
on steps that can be taken once a
complaint has been filed and
encourages faculty, staff and stu
dents to "feel free to discuss any
concerns, even when they do not
amount to charges."
Various options in seeking
informal resolutions, which offer
anonymity in most cases, were list
ed in detail. These changes follow
several complaints that the previ
ous policy drafts were not "user
friendly" enough and encouraged
the use of formal resolution proce
dures, which required the com
plainant to talk first to the alleged
perpetrator.
Because maintaining anonymi
ty becomes more difficult with
more formal charges, Karl encour
aged fleshing out different infor
mal procedures at May's senate
meeting.

According to the current draft,
complainants' options range from
receiving basic advice to different
levels of mediation and investiga
tions.
A clause in the current draft
also states that "regardless of
whether an individual is following
an informal procedure or a formal
grievance, a request that it be
reviewed by someone other than
his of her immediate supervisor
will always be honored."
Graduate women had expressed
concern last spring about the poli
cy draft's confidentiality clause,
because they are statistically more
likely to experience harassment
but may also suffer greater reper
cussions within their departments
if their identity is revealed.
The policy draft establishes a
committee of faculty, staff and stu
dents to evaluate and make recom
mendations for improvement after
two years.

Karl said she still has several
reservations about the draft that
she will address at today's meet
ing.
She said the most important
part of the draft is that it will be
enacted on a two-year trial basis.
"That will give us a chance to
review it and make changes for the
future," she said.
Jones remarked that, after
months of debate, she believes the
issues have been thoroughly dis
cussed and expressed hope that
this current version will be
endorsed.
By adding more details about
the processes and discussions
about informal evaluations before
formal grievances, she said, a vari
ety of avenues for the complainant
are given.
Though the draft will not be
able to please everyone, "it covers
all the important issues and con
cerns well," Jones said.
