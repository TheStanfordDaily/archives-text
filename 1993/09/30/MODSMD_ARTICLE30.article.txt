# A 						metaphysical escapade
## Billy Joel sails down a 'River of Dreams' of his own making 
### 
Listening to Billy Joel's latest album,
"River of Dreams," has the same feel as those
conversations you have about the meaning of
life at 4 a.m. in your freshman dorm with
friends. In other words, it's deep ... and
meaningless.
But it never bores you. From the first song
to the last, Joel uses strong guitar segments
and thought-provoking lyrics to focus his
music on everything from politics and soci
ety to relationships and mid-life crisises,
moving from concrete problems to life's
more abstract questions.
"No Man's Land," a hard-edged strike
against land development and societal ills,
begins our journey down the river. Joel
croons "There ain't much work out here in
our consumer power base / No major indus
try, just miles and miles of parking space /
This morning's paper says our neighbor's in
a cocaine bust / Lx>ts more to read about Loli
ta and suburban lust."
While the tune's green sentiment recalls the
concern for the destruction of the seas and the
fishing industry demonstrated in "Downcast -
er 'AJexa' " ("Storm Front," 1989), "No Man's
Land" substitutes intense anger for the
poignancy and longing of the earlier song.
But Joel also goes beyond the society
around him and sings about his own life —
both the good and the bad. The album's sec
ond track, "The Great Wall of China," focus
es on the hurt caused by a friend's betrayal,

namely Joel's former business manager and
ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber whom he is
currently fighting in court. Although Joel
sings "Charlie, you should have looked after
me," we know he really means Frankie.
I'hrec later tunes ("Blonde over Blue," "All
About Soul" and "Lullabye (Goodnight, My
Angel)" ) concentrate on the happiness and
fulfillment in his relationships with his
equally famed wife Christie Brinkley and
daughter Alexa Ray.
"And she gives me all the love I need to
keep my faith alive," Joel sings in tribute to
his wife in a ballad that rivals "Honesty"
("52 nd Street," 1978) as his best. Of course,
Brinkley's tribute to him comes in the cover
portrait she painted for his 12th album of
new songs.
"Lullabye" is definitely the sweetest song
on the album, demonstrating Joel's early
classical training and his love for Alexa Ray
while just barely avoiding causing sugar
shock. The story goes that Joel wrote the song
for his seven-year-old daughter after she
asked him about death. But it definitely
doesn't put you to sleep in the tradition of the
lullabye; instead the song allows Joel to
stretch his vocal range and demonstrate once
again why people continue to call him the
"Piano Man."
Sadly, few songs on "River" demonstrate the
keyboard techniques that make Joel stand out
from the crowd. What they do show is his un-

mistakable ability in
more than one genre
of music. While all
Joel songs are un
mistakably destined
to be Top 40 hits
(such as the title
track first release
"River of Dreams"),
Joel uses this album
to dabble in the blues
("A Minor Varia
tion") and modern
African rhythms A la
Paul Simon ("River
of Dreams").
The common
thread in Joel's
songs is the fear of
time passing, of not
knowing what you
are doing or looking
for. It's amazing
how much the mus
ings of a middle
aged man can look
like those of a sopho
more searching for a
major or a senior

seeking a job. Call it mid-life crisis; call it
sophomore slump; call it "A Minor Variation."
So when there are no friends up late
around the dorm to help you muse about life,

death and relationships, pull out the Piano
Man and take a ride on the "River of
Dreams."
