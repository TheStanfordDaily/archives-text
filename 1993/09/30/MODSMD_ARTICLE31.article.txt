## "Giant Steps" Boo Radleys 
### 
Just the name of Britain's 800 Radleys and
the title of their latest release, "Giant Steps,"
arc enough to make some people consider a
listen. 800 Radley, of course, was the omi
nous but eventually cool figure from "To Kill
a Mockingbird." And "Giant Steps" is, per
haps more subtly, a bow to the John Coltrane
masterpiece of the same name. Dennis Miller
would be proud of such knowing, wink-wink
references.
Thankfully, the content of the Radleys'
third album lives up to the brightness of its
marquee. "Giant Steps" is an eclectic, satisfy
ing disc that incorporates horns, strings, TV
jingles, airplane roars and guitar feedback
into catchy, intelligent melodies.
Witness "I Hang Suspended," the album's
first track, which opens with a thumping,

recorded heartbeat
and heavy guitars
which soon give way
to the dreamy lilt of
lead singer Sice, who
asks plaintively,
"Don't you care? I
don't / read minds
and if I did I'd be /
elsewhere."
By the third
song,"Wish I Was
Skinny," a breezy,

hand-clapping pop ditty, you'll probably be
hooked.
But to the Radleys' credit, what is expect
ed isn't necessarily what will happen. On
"Butterfly McQueen," for instance, the
Radleys seem to head toward a chiming cho
rus, only to interrupt the song with a flugel
horn solo.
Even the juxtaposition of their tunes is un
conventional. "Spun Around" is the proto
typical jaded-and-wasted lament, with Sice
moaning that "I've swallowed all the pills,
I'm cold / and the dreams are starting to take
hold." That's followed, however, by the love
ly, tuneful "If You Want It, Take It," which
complements the resolve of its lyrics ("If you
want it, make it yours / There's nothing
bright about being undecided") with a
melody worthy of the Replacements at their
best.
Clearly, the Radleys are still working on
cohesivcness. While a tune like "Lazarus"
combines a melancholy sweetness with sonic
guitar, other efforts like the puzzling "Rod
ney King," the psychedelic "One is Four," and
the airplane engine-aided "Run My Way
Runway" are throwaways which add little but
extra minutes to the exhausting 64-minute
disc.
But stay to the end, because you'll hear
perhaps the record's best track, "The White
Noise Revisited," which, through a muffled
vocal, expounds on the disillusion of a gener
ation reared on rock and roll, then bursts into
an affecting, almost giddy chorus: "Hey!
What's that noise? Do you remember?" After

listening to this fine work from a band that
openly embraces its '60s roots, maybe we
will.
"Giant Steps" suggests that the 800
Radleys, like their fictional namesake, arc
going to be around for awhile.
