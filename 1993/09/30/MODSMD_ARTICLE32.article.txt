# "Smooth" Smooth

It's taken a long time for the female rapper
to earn respect in the chauvinistic world of
hip-hop.
Many of rap's best selling artists have
maintained their audiences by lyrically deni
grating females over phat tracks and slam
min' bass lines.
But female hip-hoppers like Queen I-ati
fah have challenged rap's gender barriers by
demanding and eventually earning respect.
Smooth is a new female rap artist who tries to
blend bland R&B tracks with uninteresting
lyrics and vocals.
This extremely talented woman, who co
wrote and co-produced 10 of the 12 tracks on
her debut album, seems to have no musical
direction. She tries to convey the incongru
ous image of a no-nonsense girl accompa
nied by black-bourgeoisie music.
The opening cut "Ready Or Not" is sup
posed to be Smooth's introduction into the
hip-hop elite, but instead comes off as a bad
imitation of Yo-Yo. It sounds like one of

KMEL's "home jams".
Her forceful raps and soul tracks clash,
leaving listeners confused about what she is
trying to say.
Smooth's title track and contribution to
the "Menace II Society" soundtrack, "You
Been Played" is also mundane. The keyboard
generated R&B tracks aren't dope and she
tries to copy the forceful lyrical style of yet
another successful female rap artist, MC
Lyte. Plus, she throws in some Dig-ga-de
DAS EFX lyrics that make listeners lose even
more respect for her.
In an effort to satisfy her male audience,
"Get Inside My," is a poor attempt to recre
ate a toned down "Nasty Girl." Now, the
Vanity wannabe annoys her audience with
cacophonous music and rhythms that
sound like they were made by a drum ma
chine. This is a pitiful attempt at musical
erotica. Smooth wastes her great voice try
ing to imitate the soft vocals of Vanity's song
to reproduce the sexual tension of the club
hit.
Unfortunately, Smooth's a "schizo
phrenic," ready to play the role of any suc
cessful female musical artist. She seems to be
in the category of hip-hop artists who have
God-given ability that has been misdirected
by the wrong people.
If she doesn't learn to influence her
brother's amateur production and her label,
TNT, they may eventually doom this attrac
tive lady to a future of musical unemploy
ment.
