# Sugar shock?

### 
If your into "reckless collisions of white gospel and
country honk," have we got an event for you. After nearly a
year of touring the U.S. and Europe, The Jay Hawks meet
their own brand of saccharine when they open for Matthew
Sweet. The band will perform on Monday, Oct. 4 at The
Edge, in Palo Alto. Tickets for the performance are $9.
