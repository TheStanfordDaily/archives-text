# The 						last word on...
## movie deaths 
### 
In the exquisite film of "The
Joy Luck Club," there are a host of
scenes set in war-torn China, the
land from which four young
women emigrated in hopes of
finding a better life for their
daughters.
But these scenes, the flashbacks
memories of the women, do not
reflect the grime and gore of the
death surrounding them. Instead
the scenes remain glossy and the

beautiful, reflecting more of
Hollywood's romanticism
of death and dying than the

true atmosphere of the time.
Even when one of the women,
is extremely ill while traveling on
a dusty road pushing a cart with
her twin baby girls — so ill that
she is convinced of her pending
death and decides to leave her
children — she remains a beauti
ful picture to behold.
"The Joy Luck Club" demon
strates Hollywood's view that

death is beautiful, sometimes
even more beautiful than life.
Witness "Steel Magnolias," where
Julia Roberts becomes only more
beautiful as she comes closer to
death; the same thing happens to
Barbara Hershey's character in
"Beaches."
If that's what it takes to look
like a movie star, then save me
from Hollywood.
