party, sophomore Brodie
Van Wagenen pleaded no
contest to one felony
count of battery with seri
ous bodily injury Tuesday.
Van Wagenen accepted
a plea bargain in Santa
Clara County Superior

Court that stipulates he Van Wagenen
will serve no formal prison time if he com
plies with several specific requirements,
including 30 days of public-service work,
according to District Attorney Hector
Moreno.
Van Wagenen was accused of hitting se
nior Scott Francis, who suffered a broken
nose, at a party in Cedro last October.

Superior Court Judge Charles Gordon,
Moreno and Van Wagenen agreed to the
plan, which requires Van Wagenen to com
plete 30 days of public service work in the
county's public service program, along
with 200 hours of "non-baseball related"
community service dealing with victims of
violent crime, Moreno said.
If Van Wagenen, a member of the base
ball team, fulfills the settlement plan be
fore a scheduled May 23 hearing, he will
only be sentenced for a misdemeanor and
placed on probation until October 1994,
when the incident could be removed from
his record.
Prior to his sentencing, Van Wagenen
has been ordered to avoid all contact — per
sonal or otherwise — with Francis. Van
Wagenen is also prohibited from any alco
hol consumption during this period and
must pov Francis' medical costs.
