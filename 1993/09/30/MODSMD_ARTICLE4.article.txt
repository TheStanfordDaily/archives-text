# Settlement reached in party assault incident
## 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
Nearly a year after hit
ting another student at a
party, sophomore Brodie
Van Wagenen pleaded no
contest to one felony
count of battery with seri
ous bodily injury Tuesday.
Van Wagenen accepted
a plea bargain in Santa
Clara County Superior

Court that stipulates he Van Wagenen
will serve no formal prison time if he com
plies with several specific requirements,
including 30 days of public-service work,
according to District Attorney Hector
Moreno.
Van Wagenen was accused of hitting se
nior Scott Francis, who suffered a broken
nose, at a party in Cedro last October.

Superior Court Judge Charles Gordon,
Moreno and Van Wagenen agreed to the
plan, which requires Van Wagenen to com
plete 30 days of public service work in the
county's public service program, along
with 200 hours of "non-baseball related"
community service dealing with victims of
violent crime, Moreno said.
If Van Wagenen, a member of the base
ball team, fulfills the settlement plan be
fore a scheduled May 23 hearing, he will
only be sentenced for a misdemeanor and
placed on probation until October 1994,
when the incident could be removed from
his record.
Prior to his sentencing, Van Wagenen
has been ordered to avoid all contact — per
sonal or otherwise — with Francis. Van
Wagenen is also prohibited from any alco
hol consumption during this period and
must pov Francis' medical costs.

Van Wagenen has already paid
for the victim's surgical expenses
resulting from a broken nose, but
Francis is considering another
surgery.
"Brodie takes responsibility that
he struck the blow and caused
injury, and his no contest plea shows
that he has taken responsibility for
it," Van Wagenen'B lawyer, Leonard
Levine, said yesterday."I think [the
resolution! was severe for what the
incident involved. It was fair that the
court agreed to give him a misde
meanor, but the sentence was
severe."
Van Wagenen has been suspend
ed from classes this fall, according to
Levine, but will be applying for rein
statement winter quarter. Mean
time, Levine added, the sophomore
will be serving his 30 days of public
service, which could include clean-up
work on freeways or in forestry. The
type of work will be determined by
the county probation department.
University Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole declined to comment on
whether or not an internal Universi
ty investigation was underway.
The Cedro altercation was "a very
regrettable incident which had seri
ous repercussions for everyone

involved," Cole said.
Francis, now a senior, felt the
court's decision was "fair," and did
not express disappointment that the
case had not gone to trial.
"I didn't feel like it had to get to
trial to get justice," Francis said. "I
don't know Brodie. It's possible this
was a fluke. The sentence would
have been harsher if it had gone to
trial, but he also might not have been
convicted at all.
"Based on the restrictions they've
put on him, I have all confidence that
if this is in his nature, he'll break the
law again. Either he's learned his les
son or he hasn't," Francis said. "I
stopped being mad about this a long
time ago."
Van Wagenen could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Levine said Van Wagenen hopes
to start classes in the winter and will
be able to play baseball at Stanford
this year.
Athletic Director Ted Leland said
the Athletics Department will need
to confer with the baseball coach and
decide what action to take based on
the court's resolution.
"This is truly a tragedy all the
way around," Leland said. "We feel
badly for eveiyone involved."
A starting right fielder on the
Cardinal baseball team last year,
Van Wagenen had no criminal
record prior to last October's inci
dent.
