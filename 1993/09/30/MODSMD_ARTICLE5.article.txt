As she prepares to lead the first
Faculty Senate meeting of this
academic year, Biology Prof. Pa
tricia Jones is hoping the senate
will become a forum for more dis
cussion of campus issues.
Jones, the new senate chair,
said she would "like to see the
Faculty Senate be as useful as
possible to the University." She
has already encouraged Universi-

ty President Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice to use the senate as a forum to discuss
issues for which commissions have been charged.
"I care a lot about Stanford and feel the Faculty
Senate has a big role to play," said Jones, a 16-year

faculty member.
For example, when Casper unveiled the sexual
conduct policy last spring, he received many recom
mendations from the senate. Jones said engaging in
such discussion is one of the senate's important
roles. Final revisions were made on the policy dur
ing the summer.
While the senate may not have any official power
over many of these commissions or issues, she
added, the senate provides a powerful voice "and
wants to be informed.
"The great thing is that the faculty is interested
in the University — to make it a good place to work
and teach," she added. "If we continue to all work
together, we'll do OK."
In addition to today's unveiling of the sexual ha
rassment policy's latest revisions, the next two
meetings will include reports on issues that Jones


Jones
said are of particular interest to
faculty — benefits and the policy
on conflicts of commitments and
interests.
The report from the Committee
on Faculty and Staff Benefits will
be recommending a revised system
of flexible benefits, while the Com
mittee on Research will be submit
ting its revised policy on faculty's
conflicts of commitments and inter
est. This policy, like the one on sex
ual harassment, has been submit
ted once for input and revised.
The third woman to lead the sen
ate, Jones said she is not too ner
vous about her new leadership role.
In a previous term as the sen
ate's vice-chair, she had to fill in
for a period of time for the chair
who was on medical leave.
