## New director wants center to include faculty, staff 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Tucked away in a corner of Meyer Library, the
Disability Resource Center isn't well known to
most people on campus.
However, new director Nancy Deason plans to
change that.
Deason, who began work Sept. 1, said she wants
"to see disabled issues included more as an integral
part of the larger multicultural issue." She said she
was disappointed that "disabled issues were in
cluded more as a footnote (in the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report]."
But Deason does believe that Stanford is taking
positive steps in the right direction.
"What's happening in the dorms I making them
more accessible to disabled personsl shows the Uni
versity is addressing the issues. At Stanford you
feel that the disabled community is a small com
munity that is part of a larger multicultural envi
ronment," she said.
Her plans as director include working with the

University's Americans with Disabilities Act com
pliance officer and task force to make the student
focused center a resource for faculty and staff as
well.
Formerly the disability resource director at the
University of California's Hastings College of Law,
Deason was chosen afler an extensive nationwide
search that began early this year and was complet
ed over the summer.
"The primary objective [of the center) is to pro
vide the best academic services we can — to allow
[disabled students) to realize their potential and
abilities in the classroom," Deason said.
Only one month into her appointment, Deason
has already "hit the ground running," said Andree
Sursock, associate director of the Undergraduate
Advising Center, who served as the search commit
tee's chair. "She's been getting a sense of Stanford
quickly and talking to many groups."
Deason said she wants to maintain the center's
focus, particularly its "emphasis on community."
