# DRC plans to increase visibility
## New director wants center to include faculty, staff 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Tucked away in a corner of Meyer Library, the
Disability Resource Center isn't well known to
most people on campus.
However, new director Nancy Deason plans to
change that.
Deason, who began work Sept. 1, said she wants
"to see disabled issues included more as an integral
part of the larger multicultural issue." She said she
was disappointed that "disabled issues were in
cluded more as a footnote (in the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report]."
But Deason does believe that Stanford is taking
positive steps in the right direction.
"What's happening in the dorms I making them
more accessible to disabled personsl shows the Uni
versity is addressing the issues. At Stanford you
feel that the disabled community is a small com
munity that is part of a larger multicultural envi
ronment," she said.
Her plans as director include working with the

University's Americans with Disabilities Act com
pliance officer and task force to make the student
focused center a resource for faculty and staff as
well.
Formerly the disability resource director at the
University of California's Hastings College of Law,
Deason was chosen afler an extensive nationwide
search that began early this year and was complet
ed over the summer.
"The primary objective [of the center) is to pro
vide the best academic services we can — to allow
[disabled students) to realize their potential and
abilities in the classroom," Deason said.
Only one month into her appointment, Deason
has already "hit the ground running," said Andree
Sursock, associate director of the Undergraduate
Advising Center, who served as the search commit
tee's chair. "She's been getting a sense of Stanford
quickly and talking to many groups."
Deason said she wants to maintain the center's
focus, particularly its "emphasis on community."

Nancy Deason, newly appointed director of the Disability Resource Center, began work Sept. 1.
The DRC currently provides
services for approximately 170 stu
dents with physical and learning
disabilities. The assistance
includes converting written text
into Braille, and providing notetak
ers, interpreter services and read
ers for the learning and visually
disabled.
"We're here to provide services
and at the same time to lead stu
dents to being their own advocate,"
Deason said.
Disability issues are not only a
professional concern, but also a
personal one for Deason, who has a
learning disability. After graduat
ing from the University of North

Carolina, Deason worked with stu
dents who had similar disabilities.
She earned a master's degree in
learning disabilities at New York
University.
"She is an advocate, not only in
ensuring access. Her strengths
include an interest in working with
students directly. She's a hands-on
director. She also helps in develop
ing identity, a sense of what [dis
abled students] can do," Sursock
said.
"First and foremost, we will
continue the work and continue
dispelling the myths about disabled
persons. We should be seen for
what we can do, not what we can't
do," Deason said.
Deason hopes to raise con
sciousness of disabled issues by
conducting workshops and partici
pating in multicultural programs.
