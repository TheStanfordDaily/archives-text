# A 						voice of experience
## Kennedy teaches hard lessons 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
When it comes to dealing with
the trials and tribulations, pitfalls
and pickles of university life, for
mer University President and Biol
ogy Prof. Donald Kennedy is prob
ably the authority on campus.
Now, the man who has faced
everything from a student
takeover of his office to Congres
sional scrutiny of his bedsheets is
taking his experience to the class
room in a new seminar, "Profes
sional Responsibility and Academ
ic Duty."

The two-unit class, intended for
dissertation-level Ph.D. candidates
who are planning careers in acade
mia, will cover everything from
grading disputes to sharing "intel
lectual property" with graduate
students, romantic relationships
with students, and government
policies.
"It's based in part on what I
learned in 25 years or so as a facul
ty member and in part on what I
learned in 13 years as 'the final ap
pellate link' in the grievance
chain," says Kennedy of his profes
sorship and presidency. "You expe
rience first-hand the problems that

never got solved (on a lower level)."

While the class appears to be the
first comprehensive examination
of ethics of university life offered
anywhere, the seeds of the seminar
were sown in the 19605, when
Kennedy was chair of the Biology
Department. At that time,
Kennedy and a few other faculty
members offered an evening semi
nar on "what life is like once you
finish — grant applications, how to
deal with manuscript referees" and
the like, he says.
But having weathered the
storms that frequent Building 10,
Kennedy now says the class didn't go
far enough.
"Where I think [the class] was defi
cient, now, is that we didn't talk
enough about where things could
come unstuck," he says."I don't mean
to suggest that this course will focus
on the difficulties — it will be quite
upbeat — but I don't want to duck the
areas that continue to produce the real
controversies in scholarship."
The course coincides with a
heightened awareness on a national
level of the need for classes on aca
demic ethics. According to Biological
Sciences Chair Robert Simoni, the
National Institutes of Health are
now requiring all researchers who
apply for NTH pre-doctoral training
grants to demonstrate that their
graduate students will be instructed
in ethics. Such grants are probably
the single largest source of funding
for biology graduate students,
Simoni said.
"I think it's useful for a lot of rea
sons, not just because we're required
to do it," Simoni said. "It allows
[Kennedy] to do something impor
tant that he's worked a lot on, and
also meets the department's teach
ing need."
While preference will be given to
students in the biological sciences,
Kennedy hopes that a wide variety of
disciplines will be represented in the
class so that participants learn how
attitudes vary by subject area.

"I hope that students from a
number of different fields begin a
really lively conversation about hov.
to handle these problems, and in par
ticular, the differences in custom and
tradition in their fields," Kennedy
says.
"The way things develop now,
microbiologists absorb the culture
that is particular to microbiology,
historians develop the culture partic
ular to history ... without knowing
that it's different in other disci
plines," he explains.
The class will focus more on dis
cussing "real" situations — such as
what happens if one becomes physi
cally attracted to a student — rather
than analyzing policies, rules and
guidelines.
Kennedy said he hopes the class
will fill a void in the training of aca
demicians. "The Law School and the
Business School have ethics pro
grams ... as does the Med School.
The only class of doctorate-level pro
fessionals in the University to whom
we don't offer such a course is those
who will be taking our places," says
Kennedy.
"It would be funny if it weren't
sad," he says.
While Kennedy recognizes that
his close ties to the indirect-cost
scandal may cause some people to
see irony in his teaching of the class,
he says such whispering doesn't con
cern him.
"The people I care about know
(the reality of what happened)," says
Kennedy. "I'm really quite passion
ate about this. I think it will be terri
bly informative to me, and I hope it
will be to [the students]."
