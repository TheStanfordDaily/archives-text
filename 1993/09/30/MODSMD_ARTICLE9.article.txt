Health plan gains support
WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rod
ham Clinton picked up the first Republi
can support in the Senate for the admin
istration's health care plan yesterday.
Sen. James Jeffords, a moderate from
Vermont, announced his support of Pres
ident Clinton's plan at a Senate Labor
and Human Resources hearing where she
was testifying.
"I am pleased to be the first, but I am
absolutely confident I will not be the
last," Jeffords. Although the White
House is courting many Republicans —
and believes no bill will get through
Congress if it turns into a partisan fight
like the budget battle — Jeffords is the
first GOP lawmaker who's been willing to
put his name on President Clinton's bill.

No Republicans backed the president on
the budget.
No more gas guzzlers
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton unveiled an ambitious alliance
with the Big Three automakers yesterday
with the goal of creating an 80 mile-per
gallon, low-pollution passenger car.
The initiative envisions merging
automakers' expertise with the muscle of
government laboratories to create a new
generation of cars that would triple gas
mileage over the next decade.
Automakers have made little improve
ments in overall fuel efficiency in the last
eight years, with cars and trucks averag
ing about 28 miles per gallon, although
same subcompact cars have achieved.
