# 'We have a structural problem'
## Additional budget cuts looming for University 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Although many had hoped that Stan
ford had seen the worst of its budget cuts,
Provost Condoleezza Rice informed the
Faculty Senate yesterday that there "is
more coming."
In her first speech to the senate as
provost, Rice announced her plan to make
significant, long-term improvements in
the University's budget structure.
Despite weathering the last four years
of what Rice called Stanford's "time of
troubles," the University faces an addi
tional deficit on top of next year's planned
$10-15 million shortfall.
These added budget woes are due in
large part to maintenance projects that
were put on hold during the last round of
budget cuts but now must be completed.
The cost of these projects will force the

University to once again
examine its overall
structure and opera
tion.
"Rather than just
thinking about closing
deficits year after year
after year, I think what
we really have to under
stand at Stanford is that
we have a structural
problem," Rice said.

Rice said the situation is so serious
that if she were approached "tomorrow
with the greatest idea since the silicon
chip, I'd have to say, 'Sorry, we can't af
ford that.' "
She added after the meeting that her
plan is going to call for "a University-wide
effort to try and understand how to man-


Rice
age costs."
Rice told the members of the
senate that she has come up with
a "specific plan for an administra
tive-restructuring effort."
This plan, which the Universi
ty Cabinet will oversee, will look
at ways Stanford can anticipate
good, balanced and flexible bud
gets for years to come rather
than planning "year to year,"
Rice said after the meeting. She
has not yet released the specifics
of the plan.
"Rather than just continuing
to cut across the board — which
we have done a lot of in recent
years — we have to think about
how we do our work, whether we
can do it in other ways and
whether there are programs
which we might well be able to do
without," the provost informed
the senators.
She added that the University
cannot continue its policy of try
ing "to do the same with less but
we have to restructure and look at
where there may be inefficien
cies."
Even though the academic
areas have already endured many
cuts, Rice warned that they are
"not immune" from further cuts.
Hoping that this plan will
receive some guidance from the

new Commission on Undergradu
ate Education, Rice said that the
University will have to really
think about the cost of creating
new programs, as well as the need
to maintain old ones.
She summed up the Universi
ty's problem by saying that the
school has spent more unrestrict
ed money than it has taken in — a
major problem for a school that is
as "creative and innovative" as
Stanford.
She emphasized that one of
the main ways to start remedy
ing the problem is for people to
begin thinking of Stanford and
its budget as one body — not
divided between administrators
and faculty, offices and depart
ments.
"People just need to be more
attentive to costs. Every member
of the University has a part in
thinking how to hold down costs,"
Rice said afterwards.
Rice told the senate that she
hopes, once all who are associated
with the University become more
thrifty with their money, there
will be "enough flexibility in the
budget on the unrestrictive side
to continue to push the fron
tiers."
Rice also announced the
planned creation and appoint
ment of a vice provost for faculty
recruitment and development.
She said that this person will
have "a broad role," as more
attention needs to be focused on

faculty affirmative action as well
as the needs of junior faculty
members.
In other senate business,
English Prof. Robert Polhemus
expressed a concern with the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education even before its first
meeting.
Polhemus, who participated in
the previous study of undergrad
uate education 25 years ago, said
he expressed the dismay of his
colleagues in the literature and
English departments regarding
the absence of a regular faculty
member from these departments
on the committee.
He said he was disappointed
that the commission included no
one from this important area of
undergraduate education, and
questioned how valid its eventual
proposals would be in light of the
omission.
Commission Chair James
Sheehan responded that in select
ing the commission's members,
he "thought about the humani
ties as a whole," and therefore felt
the area of writing and literature
was sufficiently covered.
He added that, at 19 members,
the commission was already too
big, and "opening the lid" of
membership would encourage
countless and untenable demands
for representation from other
academic areas.
That answer, however, did not
satisfy English Prof. Ron Reb

holz. "I think it is terribly impru
dent not to have represented on
the commission itself any full
time faculty from the language
and literature departments," he
said. Rebholz called lan'guage, lit
erature and religious studies
"core disciplines of the humani
ties."
After Sheehan refused to yield
on the proposition that another
member be added to the commis
sion, Rebholz suggested that he
might petition Casper to autho
rize another position.
Sheehan announced that Ken
Oshman, Class of '68 and Lor
raine Fox, Class of '79, would
serve as the alumni members of
the commission. Mathematics
Prof. Brad Osgood, who had
been inadvertently omitted
from the commission's list of
faculty members, will also serve
on the project, Sheehan
announced.
Sheehan admitted that the
commission has "a daunting task,
and we must entertain the possi
bility that we will fail."
"What I hope, however, is that
we will succeed at one thing," he
said. "And that is encouraging
everybody — all members — to
think systematically about the
undergraduate programs ... as
broadly and as creatively as possi
ble."
