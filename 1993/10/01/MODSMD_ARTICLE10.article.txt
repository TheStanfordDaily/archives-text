Powell steps down
WASHINGTON (AP) - Gen. Colin
Powell ended his career as the nation's
top military officer yesterday amid pomp
and pageantry, hailed by President Clin
ton simply as "first and foremost, a good
soldier."
At a retirement ceremony under
sunny autumn skies, Powell saluted the
troops, then bade an emotional and elo
quent farewell.
"I loved every single day of it and it's
hard to leave," the outgoing chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff told a crowd of
hundreds assembled on reviewing field at
Fort Myer in suburban Virginia.
Clinton awarded Powell the presiden
tial Medal of Freedom — the general had
received the same award earlier from
President Bush — as Powell was feted
with a cascade of awards, 21-gun salute
and military flyover. Former President
and Mrs. Bush were among the honored
guests.
"His remarkable balance of prudence
and courage . . . and bis unfailing sense
of humor have been there through the
difficult times of now two presidencies,"
Clinton continued. Queen Elizabeth 11,

adding accolades from afar, approved an
honorary knighthood for Powell.
MeinholcTs ruling reinforced
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A federal
judge yesterday strengthened his earlier
ruling in the case of Navy Petty Officer
Keith Meinhold that the Pentagon's ban
on homosexuals is unconstitutional by
specifying that the military cannot dis
charge or alter the status of service mem
bers because of their sexual orientation.
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr.
also warned that if the Defense Depart
ment is later found to be in contempt of
his order "there will be substantial sanc
tions," including monetary penalties "at
a minimum of $10,000 per day."
The order was issued after attorneys for
Meinhold, an officer at Palo Alto's MofTet
Naval Air Station, asked that the Depart
ment of Defense be held in contempt of
Hatter's November 1992 ruling that Pen
tagon policy calling for the discharge of
homosexuals was unconstitutional.
In that ruling, Hatter also ordered
reinstatement of Meinhold, 31, who was
discharged last year after admitting on
national television that he is homosexual.
