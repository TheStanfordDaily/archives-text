# India still counting its losses
## 6.4 quake's death toll rises to 16,000 
### 
UMARGA, India (AP) - The death toll
in yesterday's earthquake in India has
risen to more than 16,000, officials said.
The earthquake shattered the dawn
yesterday, collapsing mud and mortar
homes onto sleeping families in villages
across southern India. Authorities
feared the death toll would rise sub
stantially in India's worst quake in a
half century.
More than 50 villages sustained
heavy damage and casualtiss, officials
said. Minor damage also was reported
from towns and villages hundreds of
miles away.
The International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies on
Thursday sent $66,000 in emergency
funds to help. The Geneva-based feder
ation groups national Red Cross and
Muslim TVd Crescent societies world
wide.
Many villages were leveled so quick
ly as the earth shook violently and
opened crevices that people were
crushed inside their homes while sleep
ing, news agencies reported.
"The rising sun created darkness for

us this morning, swallowed up our vil
lages, and made our houses into
tombs," a survivor told one reporter.
Some survived when frantic rescuers
heard them shouting for help beneath
toppled walls and roofs or saw a hand
reaching out from the wreckage.
Friends, neighbors and police
strained to lift stone, brick and wood by
hand to free victims.
Soldiers and policemen rushed to the
remote area of southwestern India
bringing stretchers, tents, medical sup
plies, earth movers, bulldozers and
mobile hospitals. But relief workers had
trouble reaching some villages that
recently lost their roads and bridges to
heavy monsoon rains.
The quake, which measured between
6.0 and 6.4 on the Richter scale, ripped
through sout' wo 3:56 a.m.
The d ih given Ly sta n offi
cials and news reports varied from
6,200 to 16,000, and all appeared to be
based on confirmed statistics and esti
mates.
By nightfall the death toll was more
than 6,200, said N. Raghunathan, chief

secretary of Maharashtra, the hardest
hit state, adding that more than 2,000
bodies had been recovered.
State-run Doordarshan TV raised
the toll to more than 10,000 and said
more than 12,000 people could still be
trapped. The United News of India news
agency later put the death toll at 16,000.
The epicenter was near Maharash
tra's southeastern border with Madhya
Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh states.
One of the worst hit towns was
Umarga, 270 miles southeast of Bom
bay. Some 3,000 people died and 60 per
cent of the town's buildings were
destroyed, Raghunathan said.
Inside the town's small, overcrowded
hospital, hundreds of injured people lay
wailing on floors or in a tent set up in a
courtyard.
"We don't have enough drugs and
bandages," D Ahiwin Solekar said as
he rushed from one patient to another.
In shattered villages, crowds of peo
ple roamed through the debris, praying
for lost relatives. Many others lit funer
al pyres in the streets to cremate their
friends and families.
