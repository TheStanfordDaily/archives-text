Support for diversity in
faculty and staff should
remain a critical concern

ONCE AGAIN, Stanford has
turned a corner on the road
toward a more diverse com
munity. It appears that there is no
easy answer to the nagging prob
lem of limited campus diversity
among faculty and staff.
In response to recommenda
tions from an ad hoc University
committee, the Office of Multicul
tural Development is changing its
course — heading back to its origi
nal primary goal of promoting
affirmative action in staff hiring at
Stanford.
While this is a step in the right
direction, the University should
also ensure that the office's other
responsibilities and its primary
mission — to foster a multicultural
environment on campus, not just
among students but faculty and
staff as well — is not ignored.
The shift in focus counters
recent trends that saw the office
serving a broader function of gen
eral ethnic community outreach
and involvement.
Unfortunately, however, this
broader function was achieved at
the expense of the office's original
purpose, as it let affirmative action
reporting requirements fall by the
wayside, starting in the late 1980s.
From its creation in the 19705, the
then-titled Affirmative Action
Office was in charge of monitoring
affirmative action statistics with
regard to staff members — study
ing recruiting, retention, counsel
ing and other concerns.
Under the guidance of former
director Sharon Parker, the office
stopped producing its annual
report on affirmative action, effec
tively de-emphasizing the formal
study of minority staff recruitment
at Stanford.
Ideally, the office will once again
compile the statistics that will

ensure Stanford's ability to com
pete on a national level for a
diverse, qualified faculty and staff.
However, the University must also
recognize the fact that such a swift
change often does not come with
out its drawbacks.
The office's recent agenda
included personal dealings with
ethnic communities on the stu
dent, faculty and staff levels. It
remains to be seen whether the
University infrastructure can pick
up the slack in this regard, offer
ing a point of reference and com
munication for these various
groups.
It was implied in the 1989 report
of the University Committee on
Minority Issues that while Stan
ford had achieved an acceptably
diverse community by the late
1980s, the lack of support infras
tructure to deal with diversity
issues could have added to racial
tension on campus.
Although student community
centers will most likely be able to
keep their interests heard and
maintain a tight support group for
the different ethnic and religious
student populations, the Universi
ty also must remain conscious of
multicultural issues involving fac
ulty and staff. There must be an
emphasis on outreach and support
for these vital segments of the
Stanford community.
University President Gerhard
Casper should closely monitor the
effects of de-emphasizing multicul
tural outreach among staff and fac
ulty members. If significant prob
lems arise within those sectors of
the University over the ensuing
year, Casper must address the
problem head on, perhaps by creat
ing a new position, separate from
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, that can fill the void.
The University is making a posi
tive change, in that affirmative
action policies on campus should be
actively pursued by the office. But
good intentions are not enough.
There is a long, steep road yet to be
traveled if Stanford is to truly
become a multicultural communi
ty.
