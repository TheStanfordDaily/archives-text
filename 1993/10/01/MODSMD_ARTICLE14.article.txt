## Ron Glass The 						point of education: one man's story 
### 
WHEN I entered
college I was
headed toward a
career in medicine. This
goal satisfied my intel
lectual interests and my
moral commitments to
alleviate suffering, and it
built on broad experi*
ence. I planned a major
in biology, with a scat-

tering of electives in literature and the
social sciences to round out a liberal edu
cation which took advantage of the Har
vard faculty.
Then I discovered deeper interests
when I encountered certain philosophical
issues in two courses. I was also being
moved by suffering beyond the reach of
medicine, such as that associated with
racism, war and poverty. I began to envi
sion other possible futures for myself,
futures both exciting and frightening. I
feared disappointing my parents, and
perhaps myself, so my sophomore year
contained many long afternoons on the
banks of the Charles River, watching the
flow of water for some clue that my choic
es were right.
By my junior year, I was happily
engaged in an interdisciplinary major
which linked my interests in philosophy,
history, and science and kept open a
broad range of career options. But war
raged on in Vietnam and on the streets,

and racism and poverty still blighted the
community.
Every career seemed shallow in
response to the depth of the need for a
new society. My friends and I protest
ed, marched and organized our way to
commitments to devote our lives to
struggle for justice. Education became
a means for seeing reality more clearly
in order that it might be changed more
readily.
By my senior year, I had volunteered
to be drafted into the armed forces, never
intending to fight but rather to help
other draftees learn of their rights and
their freedom to resist. Rejected by the
military as wholly unfit, I embarked on
twenty years of work with community
and movement-based organizations to
develop educational programs seeking
justice and peace.
So, what's the point of an education
from the point of view of this one man's
life? A college education should help us
learn more deeply who we are and who
we might be, and challenge us to be the
most we can by making the world all it
can be.
Part of finding ourselves is trying to
put ourselves in the place of others so
that we can come back to ourselves with
a deeper and surer understanding, so our
college education should help us appreci
ate different times, places and cultures.
Another part of finding ourselves is see

ing that we are already inhabited by and
indebted to others, from family, friends
and teachers to countless anonymous
others who have formed our language,
culture and institutions.
I think we can't really know ourselves
until we have struggled to know the oth
ers both inside and outside us, and strug
gled to make the world a place where
everyone has the freedom and privilege of
discovering themselves.
So be sure to take some time every
now and then, in the midst of reading
and writing assignments or exam
preparations to get in touch with what
YOUR point is, what you are being
called to do.
If you don't pause, you cannot listen to
the call. Then use your college education
to seek generosity of spirit, depth of char
acter, capacity for caring, courage in the
face of adversity and oppression, humor
in midst of absurdity, delight in relief of
suffering, joy in friendship, satisfaction
in steadfastness in love, strength of con
viction, humility in the certainty of
errors and shortcomings and curiosity
that sees the wonder in the ordinary.
Then what a wonderful place Stanford
and the world would be.
