## Administration must not ignore Asian-American issues 
### 
LAST WEEK, University President
Casper announced a broad program
of facing the challenge of meeting
the diversity needs of the campus. I wel
come his initiative. One area in which we
need to face up to this challenge is in meet
ing the needs of Asian-Americans at Stan
ford. I will address two major such needs.
The first and foremost is the establish
ment of an Asian-American studies pro
gram. This issue was first brought to the
attention of the administration by Asian-
American students in the early 1970s in
the midst of heightened ethnic move
ments on campuses throughout the coun
try. While other schools met the demands
of students and established ethnic stud
ies programs, including Asian-American
Studies, our administration turned deaf
ears to the request. Its answer was sim

ply to fund courses mostly of SWOPSI
types, which were considered "extra" and
"frill," taught mostly by hired hands
from surrounding schools.
Lack of commitment by the adminis
tration meant that courses were of a low
intellectual level, disorganized, lacked
coherence and could not meet the chal
lenge of students. Student interest dissi
pated.
Since then the Asian-American stu
dent body has increased to 24 percent of
undergraduates. Last year they
expressed their need to have an Asian-
American studies program on campus,
but the administration took no action.
Note that African-Americans and Mexi
can-Americans, with far fewer students,
have had their programs in place for
years. I, of course, am not saying they

don't deserve them simply because
Asian-Americans don't have one. On the
contrary, I am saying if they deserve
theirs, as they do, why don't Asian-
Americans?
If President Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice are serious about their
commitment to multiculturalism on cam
pus, why do they not come forth on their
own initiative to announce the establish
ment of an Asian-American Program?
Are they waiting to be awakened?
The second and related issue has to do
with the minuscule number of Asian-
American faculty and total absence of
Asian-Americans in the higher adminis
tration. With 24 percent of undergrads
being Asian-American, looking to Asian-
American faculty as their role models, as
their official and informal advisers and

counsels and as teachers of Asian-Ameri
can courses, the small number of Asian-
American faculty and lack of Asian-
American administrators at the upper
echelon is simply a shame. The trouble is
that the administration refuses to recog
nize the Asian-American as a targeted
minority for faculty recruitment. Part of
this trouble is a Catch-22; it arises from
the absence of Asian-American adminis
trators at high levels to use their posi
tions to press for this recognition.
Unless President Casper and Provost
Rice come forth to face these issues with
out waiting to be reluctantly button
holed, I have serious doubts about their
sincerity in their commitment to multi
culturalism.
