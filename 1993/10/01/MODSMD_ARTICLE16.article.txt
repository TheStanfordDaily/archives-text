## The 						power within — being the best gosh darn me I can be 
### 
Lately a lot of men have been staring
at my breasts. OK, so maybe I've
been wearing a lot of tight shirts.
And those little tiny Dallas Cowboy cheer
leaderesque shjrts. And maybe, just
maybe, I have been delving into the final
frontier that is hairspray and makeup use.
You like to watch, don't you?
I know, I know. I'm a sell-out. Selling
out all that is a backward Stanford hat and
a big, baggy sweatshirt. All that is people
focusing on personality instead of embar
rassingly low neck lines. All that is an insti
tution of higher learning, a high-powered
research university where people can put
their J Crew evil twins aside and go brain-to
brain in bacchanalian academic frenzy.
I feel so cheap.
There's no excuse for my behavior. I just
got that urge, the urge to make any kind of
mark, the easiest way possible. The urge to
have reasonably athletic men offer to push
their way through other reasonably athletic
men to get to the keg and grab me a beer —
instead of those tangible, hard-to-come-by
academic and personal accomplishments.
Simple pleasures.
It's all a part of these fears that wake me

up in the middle of two-hour lectures with
comfortable chairs. These fears that tell me
my time left on campus is short, and I've
got to do something, anything, my parents
can condense into a witty phrase for the
license-plate holder on their mini van.
The demonic workings of my misguided
brain kicking into overdrive, screaming at
the top of its lungs at me that I'm a senior.
This is it. The end all, be all. This is the
finale, and I've gotta do some of that carpe
diem stuff in a big way.
Push it in Stanford, push it in.
Soon, they're gonna throw me and my
impotent resume out into the cold, where
people don't like jokes about how suave
and debonaire frat boys are. Where people
don't care what womyn is or was or will be.
Where people don't want to have weenie
roasts with you and your fire within.
Say it ain't so.
So now, as my stolen-bike toll swells and
the number of units I need to graduate
trickles, it's time to make that statement I
meant to make back when I came to Stan
ford. Back when I thought Bookstore fash
ion shows were cool. Back when I thought
leaving messages on answering machines

was humiliating. Back when I thought this
whole no dating at Stanford thing was just
communist propaganda.
I have never been so blind.
I sit here and look at all the years I could
have spent taking Stanford by the jugular.
All the years I could have spent asking
informed questions in large lecture classes.
All the years I could have gone to office hours.
All the years I could have seduced my TAs.
But I didn't. I sat back and let the
resume-packers divide up campus like a
freshly-slaughtered side of beef. Let others
run for COP. Let others kiss Casper's ring
in the pale moonlight. Let others dance on
top of tables at Delt parties, while I blend
ed into the mosh pit below.
I've been oppressed.
When my parents kicked me out of our
poor-cornering American car onto theFlo
Mo curb three years ago, I had so many
dreams. Pitiful dreams involving flannel
pajama parties, but dreams nonetheless.
Now I've lost all that, hitting the prover
bial wall with such force that I couldn't
even tell you my neighbors' names —
although the paper-thin elegance of Ster
ling Quad walls lets me listen in on their

scandalous late-night heart-to-hearts.
Couldn't even identify more than a dozen of
them if I ever actually ate dinner in the din
ing hall. Couldn't even tell you which ones
fold other's laundry when they take it out
of the dryer and which ones wad it up.
A look at the statistics that shape
America.
So I've got to stop this evil trend of apa
thy which has been keeping me away from
classes preceeded by asterisks and big,
bold, scary letters. Keeping me away from
parties where I might possibly meet possi
ble people to make semi-rewarding
exchanges foreshadowing potential future
contact. Keeping me from sucking the
marrow out of this University and getting
my dad's money's worth.
It's time to be sociable. Time to actually
enter a library. Time to fill out lots of appli
cations and go head-to-head with Mr.
ASSU down the hall. Time to be one of
those people who can get studying done at
the Coffee House — in between hand
shakes with loud snaps from the thousands
of handsomely dressed people they know.
Dream the impossible dream.
But it's not out of my grasp yet; I can be

an enthusiastic, overachieving Stanford
student once more. A few insightful com
ments in Poli Sci section. A few looks down
my top at crowded parties with Elysian
male-to-female ratios. A few concrete
name-and-face recognition encounters with
the professors from whom I hope to get
grossly hyperbolic recommendation letters.
It's all coming back to me now.
Here I am, perched on the 3-meter
board of life — watching the clear pool of
Stanford ripple below me. I was pushed up
the ladder based on so many somewhat
encouraging marks written in the margins
of A papers. But the time is now; I have to
dive. Take the day and run with it, or do a
belly flop and put to rest all that reliance on
the potential-thing. Sink or swim.
I want my mommy.

I've been oppressed.
When my parents kicked me out of our
poor-cornering American car onto theFlo
Mo curb three years ago, I had so many
dreams. Pitiful dreams involving flannel
pajama parties, but dreams nonetheless.
Now I've lost all that, hitting the prover
bial wall with such force that I couldn't
even tell you my neighbors' names —
although the paper-thin elegance of Ster
ling Quad walls lets me listen in on their

scandalous late-night heart-to-hearts.
Couldn't even identify more than a dozen of
them if I ever actually ate dinner in the din
ing hall. Couldn't even tell you which ones
fold other's laundry when they take it out
of the dryer and which ones wad it up.
A look at the statistics that shape
America.
So I've got to stop this evil trend of apa
thy which has been keeping me away from
classes preceeded by asterisks and big,
bold, scary letters. Keeping me away from
parties where I might possibly meet possi
ble people to make semi-rewarding
exchanges foreshadowing potential future
contact. Keeping me from sucking the
marrow out of this University and getting
my dad's money's worth.
It's time to be sociable. Time to actually
enter a library. Time to fill out lots of appli
cations and go head-to-head with Mr.
ASSU down the hall. Time to be one of
those people who can get studying done at
the Coffee House — in between hand
shakes with loud snaps from the thousands
of handsomely dressed people they know.
Dream the impossible dream.
But it's not out of my grasp yet; I can be

an enthusiastic, overachieving Stanford
student once more. A few insightful com
ments in Poli Sci section. A few looks down
my top at crowded parties with Elysian
male-to-female ratios. A few concrete
name-and-face recognition encounters with
the professors from whom I hope to get
grossly hyperbolic recommendation letters.
It's all coming back to me now.
Here I am, perched on the 3-meter
board of life — watching the clear pool of
Stanford ripple below me. I was pushed up
the ladder based on so many somewhat
encouraging marks written in the margins
of A papers. But the time is now; I have to
dive. Take the day and run with it, or do a
belly flop and put to rest all that reliance on
the potential-thing. Sink or swim.
I want my mommy.

for Jocks conflicts at all with personal great

Lately a lot of men have been staring
at my breasts. OK, so maybe I've
been wearing a lot of tight shirts.
And those little tiny Dallas Cowboy cheer
leaderesque shjrts. And maybe, just
maybe, I have been delving into the final
frontier that is hairspray and makeup use.
You like to watch, don't you?
I know, I know. I'm a sell-out. Selling
out all that is a backward Stanford hat and
a big, baggy sweatshirt. All that is people
focusing on personality instead of embar
rassingly low neck lines. All that is an insti
tution of higher learning, a high-powered
research university where people can put
their J Crew evil twins aside and go brain-to
brain in bacchanalian academic frenzy.
I feel so cheap.
There's no excuse for my behavior. I just
got that urge, the urge to make any kind of
mark, the easiest way possible. The urge to
have reasonably athletic men offer to push
their way through other reasonably athletic
men to get to the keg and grab me a beer —
instead of those tangible, hard-to-come-by
academic and personal accomplishments.
Simple pleasures.
It's all a part of these fears that wake me

up in the middle of two-hour lectures with
comfortable chairs. These fears that tell me
my time left on campus is short, and I've
got to do something, anything, my parents
can condense into a witty phrase for the
license-plate holder on their mini van.
The demonic workings of my misguided
brain kicking into overdrive, screaming at
the top of its lungs at me that I'm a senior.
This is it. The end all, be all. This is the
finale, and I've gotta do some of that carpe
diem stuff in a big way.
Push it in Stanford, push it in.
Soon, they're gonna throw me and my
impotent resume out into the cold, where
people don't like jokes about how suave
and debonaire frat boys are. Where people
don't care what womyn is or was or will be.
Where people don't want to have weenie
roasts with you and your fire within.
Say it ain't so.
So now, as my stolen-bike toll swells and
the number of units I need to graduate
trickles, it's time to make that statement I
meant to make back when I came to Stan
ford. Back when I thought Bookstore fash
ion shows were cool. Back when I thought
leaving messages on answering machines

was humiliating. Back when I thought this
whole no dating at Stanford thing was just
communist propaganda.
I have never been so blind.
I sit here and look at all the years I could
have spent taking Stanford by the jugular.
All the years I could have spent asking
informed questions in large lecture classes.
All the years I could have gone to office hours.
All the years I could have seduced my TAs.
But I didn't. I sat back and let the
resume-packers divide up campus like a
freshly-slaughtered side of beef. Let others
run for COP. Let others kiss Casper's ring
in the pale moonlight. Let others dance on
top of tables at Delt parties, while I blend
ed into the mosh pit below.
