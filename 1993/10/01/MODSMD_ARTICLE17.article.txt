## Cardinal looks to beat Cal 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
It's been a long time since a
Cardinal water polo team has
beaten arch-rival California.
Two runner-up finishes at the
NCAA tournament, three consec

and no Big Splash victories. The
current members of the team
have suffered all this at the hands
of the Golden Bears. In fact, no
member of the current Stanford
squad has been part of a victory
over Cal.
This Saturday, coach Dante
Dettamanti's team will look to

"None of the current players
have beaten Cal," Dettamanti
said. "We've come close several
times, placing second to them
twice at NCAAs in 1990 and 1992
(in three overtimes). We also lost
in overtime at the conference
tournament last season."
The Bears are three-time
defending national champions
and are currently the country's
third-ranked team. Stanford's
offensive captain Chris Wallin
stressed that prior rankings are
unimportant.
"They have lost to both USC
and UC-Irvine by one goal this
season," Dettamanti said. "Cal
was the pre-season No. 1 team -
they're still the team to beat."
"This is a big game," Wallin
agreed. "Even though we're No.

us. If we do, we'll be in good
shape for the season."
