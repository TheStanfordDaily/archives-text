## Cardinal looks to beat Cal 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
It's been a long time since a
Cardinal water polo team has
beaten arch-rival California.
Two runner-up finishes at the
NCAA tournament, three consec
utive second-place league finishes
and no Big Splash victories. The
current members of the team
have suffered all this at the hands
of the Golden Bears. In fact, no
member of the current Stanford
squad has been part of a victory
over Cal.
This Saturday, coach Dante
Dettamanti's team will look to
break that losing streak and pre
serve their current No. 1 national
ranking.
"None of the current players
have beaten Cal," Dettamanti
said. "We've come close several
times, placing second to them
twice at NCAAs in 1990 and 1992
(in three overtimes). We also lost
in overtime at the conference
tournament last season."
The Bears are three-time
defending national champions
and are currently the country's
third-ranked team. Stanford's
offensive captain Chris Wallin
stressed that prior rankings are
unimportant.
"They have lost to both USC
and UC-Irvine by one goal this
season," Dettamanti said. "Cal
was the pre-season No. 1 team -
they're still the team to beat."
"This is a big game," Wallin
agreed. "Even though we're No.
1, we need to get this win behind
us. If we do, we'll be in good
shape for the season."
California has also been virtu
ally unbeatable at home in the
past few seasons. They have not
lost a match in their home pool
since the 1990 season and have
been defeated at home only twice
since 1987.
The Bears graduated some
key members of their 1992 cham
pionship team, but are led by
holeman Troy Barnhart, the
team's leading scorer with 19
goals, defensive specialist Gavin
Arroyo and driver Tony Barnes.
All three seniors are members of
the U.S. National Team. The
California defense is led by Sean
Nolan, formerly of Palo Alto
High School.
"Cal was carried by Dirk
Zeien, a German National Team
member, last year and Chris
Humbert the year before," Detta
manti said. "This year they don't
have that kind of big gun or
superstar. They have four very
formidable players and a host of
others who can contribute. Cal
always has plenty of depth."
When asked how the Cardinal

plans to keep the California
offensive attack in check, Wallin
pointed to the importance of suc
cessfully defending holeman
Barnhart, who plays directly in
front of the goal.
"We have to make sure he
(Barnhart) doesn't score," the
senior said. "Barnhart and
Arroyo are their main players,
but their team is not as balanced
as it has been. If we can contain
those two, we should be in good
shape."
While the outcome of this
game may not have a huge
impact on the team's season, a
loss could be a setback for the
team's goal of entering the
NCAA championships as the top
seed.
"We could play Cal up to six
times this season, but our first
goal is to be the No. 1 seed," Det
tamanti said. "Right now, we just
have to keep winning."
Wallin acknowledged that get
ting his first win over California
would be like lifting a weight off
the team. "We just need to play
well as a team, come out hard
and have confidence," he said.
