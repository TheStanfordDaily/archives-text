# Mad Greek picks the games
## Football guru takes on Leland 
### 
Let me see: I am 5 feet, 8 inches tall, have
bushy eyebrows, think grape leaves are
delectable and consider Michael Dukakis an
embarassment. I must be a Greek.
Yes, we have arrived at that time of year
again, when every hack with a year of Daily edit
ing experience thinks he knows more about the
gridiron than those fickle Las Vegas oddsmak
ers. That's why I get to run the Greek football
picks contest this year, albeit a modified version
in which I square off with only one campus
celebrity-type a

week.
For my first
installment, I
bring you Athlet
ics Director Ted
Leland, a love
able character
who has not shied
away from the
delights of Greek
food in the past

and does not figure to do so any time soon.
So without further ado, here are the picks,
accompanied by the latest lines from Wednes
day's San Francisco Chronicle. And remember,
the home team is in ALL CAPS and that this
exercise is solely for entertainment purposes. So
as always, please, no wagering.
Notre Dame -9-1/2 vs. STANFORD
Andy: Stanford +9-1/2. Notre Dame's ranked
way too high at No. 4, we're looking to rebound
from an unexpected defeat and Kevin McDougal
is no Rick Mirer, no matter what any Irish parti
san says.
Ted: Stanford +9-1/2. Leland laid his relation
ship with Bill Walsh on the line and predicts a
30-27 Cardinal victory. Here's hoping 30 points
will be enough.
CALIFORNIA -11-1/2 vs. Oregon
Andy: Cal -11-1/2. The undefeated Golden
Bears will return to earth (and the loss column)
when they hit the meat of their schedule. Unfor
tunately, wounded Ducks are mostly skin and
bones.
Ted: Oregon +11-1/2. Begging to differ, Leland
felt that the Ducks could win the game outright.
They could, just not this year. Looks like I'll
have some room to breathe heading into next
week.
Arizona State —17 vs. OREGON STATE
Andy: Oregon State +17. Even though the
Beavers have already notched their season-quota
one victory, they should cover a three-possession
spread against a Sun Devil squad that can only
wish they had the defense of their downstate
neighbors.
Ted: Oregon State +17. Leland thought the
Beavs are due for a good game. Even if they are
not, Corvallis is a tough place to visit (sort of).
ARIZONA -1-1/2 vs. USC
Andy: USC +1-1/2. My parents met at USC, and
I was born and bred a Trojan fan, so I owe some
body this pick. Besides, we need Arizona to lose.

Real bad.
Ted: Arizona -1-1/2. Ever the pragmatist,
Leland pointed out minor details like the Wild
cats' stifling defense and the raucous Tucson
crowd as reasons 'Zona will prevail. Traitor.
SYRACUSE -7-1/2 vs. Boston College
Andy: Syracuse -7-1/2. Marvin Graves and the
Carrierdome spell too many Orangemen for the
Eagles to handle.
Ted: Syracuse -7-1/2. For Leland, it was as sim-

pie as Northwest
ern 22, Boston
College 21.
Alabama —13
vs. SOUTH
CAROLINA
Andy: South Car
olina + 13.1 know
I'm going out on a
limb here, but the
Tide onlv rolls ud

»uv wiiij a una up
so many points per game, and Steve Taneyhill is
a pretty fair Gamecock quarterback.
Ted: Alabama —13. "South Carolina hasn't
faced a top-quality opponent like Alabama yet,"
Leland said. Yes, but what about rising to the
occasion, especially at home?
SAN FRANCISCO -9-1/2 vs. Minnesota
Andy: San Francisco -9-1/2. The 'Niners need a
win to maintain a pulse. Luckily, the Vikings
should roll over and play dead after upsetting the
Packers last week.
Ted: San Francisco -9-1/2. "I'm too chicken to
pick otherwise," Walsh, er, Leland, stated. 'Nuff
said.
N.Y. JETS —1 vs. Philadelphia
Andy: Jets —1. The Eagles are 3-0, but none of
those wins came easily and the defense is still
suspect. The Jets looked impressive in downing
the Dolphins in Miami three weeks ago.
Ted: Jets —1. That's what being college team
mates with Jet head coach Bruce Coslet will do
to you.
BUFFALO -6 vs. N.Y. Giants
Andy: N.Y. Giants +6. It's a Super Bowl
rematch, so you have to like the National Foot
ball Conference team. Besides, the Bills forgot to
show up for last week's game against Miami and
could be truant again.
Ted: Buffalo —6. Leland thought that the Giants
will be intimidated by the crowd in Buffalo. Has
he been to New York lately?
MIAMI -4-1/2 vs. Washington
Andy: Washington +4-1/2. Again, it is a Super
Bowl thing. Cary Conklin should give the Red
skins enough offense to beat an overconfident
Dolphin colony.
Ted: Miami -4-1/2. Believing that Monday nights
do strange things to Dan Marino at home, Leland
picked yet another also-ran, er, American Football
Conference team to knock off an NFC counterpart.
Is nine years not enough to scare him off?

Leland said. Yes, but what about rising to the
occasion, especially at home?
SAN FRANCISCO -9-1/2 vs. Minnesota
Andy: San Francisco -9-1/2. The 'Niners need a
win to maintain a pulse. Luckily, the Vikings
should roll over and play dead after upsetting the
Packers last week.
Ted: San Francisco -9-1/2. "I'm too chicken to
pick otherwise," Walsh, er, Leland, stated. 'Nuff
said.
N.Y. JETS —1 vs. Philadelphia
Andy: Jets —1. The Eagles are 3-0, but none of
those wins came easily and the defense is still
suspect. The Jets looked impressive in downing
the Dolphins in Miami three weeks ago.
Ted: Jets —1. That's what being college team
mates with Jet head coach Bruce Coslet will do
to you.
BUFFALO -6 vs. N.Y. Giants
Andy: N.Y. Giants +6. It's a Super Bowl
rematch, so you have to like the National Foot
ball Conference team. Besides, the Bills forgot to
show up for last week's game against Miami and
could be truant again.
Ted: Buffalo —6. Leland thought that the Giants
will be intimidated by the crowd in Buffalo. Has
he been to New York lately?
MIAMI -4-1/2 vs. Washington
Andy: Washington +4-1/2. Again, it is a Super
Bowl thing. Cary Conklin should give the Red
skins enough offense to beat an overconfident
Dolphin colony.
Ted: Miami -4-1/2. Believing that Monday nights
do strange things to Dan Marino at home, Leland
picked yet another also-ran, er, American Football
Conference team to knock off an NFC counterpart.
Is nine years not enough to scare him off?

Let me see: I am 5 feet, 8 inches tall, have
bushy eyebrows, think grape leaves are
delectable and consider Michael Dukakis an
embarassment. I must be a Greek.
Yes, we have arrived at that time of year
again, when every hack with a year of Daily edit
ing experience thinks he knows more about the
gridiron than those fickle Las Vegas oddsmak
ers. That's why I get to run the Greek football
picks contest this year, albeit a modified version
in which I square off with only one campus
celebrity-type a

week.
For my first
installment, I
bring you Athlet
ics Director Ted
Leland, a love
able character
who has not shied
away from the
delights of Greek
food in the past

and does not figure to do so any time soon.
So without further ado, here are the picks,
accompanied by the latest lines from Wednes
day's San Francisco Chronicle. And remember,
the home team is in ALL CAPS and that this
exercise is solely for entertainment purposes. So
as always, please, no wagering.
Notre Dame -9-1/2 vs. STANFORD
Andy: Stanford +9-1/2. Notre Dame's ranked
way too high at No. 4, we're looking to rebound
from an unexpected defeat and Kevin McDougal
is no Rick Mirer, no matter what any Irish parti
san says.
Ted: Stanford +9-1/2. Leland laid his relation
ship with Bill Walsh on the line and predicts a
30-27 Cardinal victory. Here's hoping 30 points
will be enough.
CALIFORNIA -11-1/2 vs. Oregon
Andy: Cal -11-1/2. The undefeated Golden
Bears will return to earth (and the loss column)
when they hit the meat of their schedule. Unfor
tunately, wounded Ducks are mostly skin and
bones.
Ted: Oregon +11-1/2. Begging to differ, Leland
felt that the Ducks could win the game outright.
They could, just not this year. Looks like I'll
have some room to breathe heading into next
week.
Arizona State —17 vs. OREGON STATE
Andy: Oregon State +17. Even though the
Beavers have already notched their season-quota
one victory, they should cover a three-possession
spread against a Sun Devil squad that can only
wish they had the defense of their downstate
neighbors.
Ted: Oregon State +17. Leland thought the
Beavs are due for a good game. Even if they are
not, Corvallis is a tough place to visit (sort of).
ARIZONA -1-1/2 vs. USC
Andy: USC +1-1/2. My parents met at USC, and
I was born and bred a Trojan fan, so I owe some
body this pick. Besides, we need Arizona to lose.

Real bad.
Ted: Arizona -1-1/2. Ever the pragmatist,
Leland pointed out minor details like the Wild
cats' stifling defense and the raucous Tucson
crowd as reasons 'Zona will prevail. Traitor.
SYRACUSE -7-1/2 vs. Boston College
Andy: Syracuse -7-1/2. Marvin Graves and the
Carrierdome spell too many Orangemen for the
Eagles to handle.
Ted: Syracuse -7-1/2. For Leland, it was as sim-

pie as Northwest
ern 22, Boston
College 21.
Alabama —13
vs. SOUTH
CAROLINA
Andy: South Car
olina + 13.1 know
I'm going out on a
limb here, but the
Tide onlv rolls ud

so many points per game, and Steve Taneyhill is
a pretty fair Gamecock quarterback.
Ted: Alabama —13. "South Carolina hasn't
faced a top-quality opponent like Alabama yet,"
Leland said. Yes, but what about rising to the
occasion, especially at home?
SAN FRANCISCO -9-1/2 vs. Minnesota
