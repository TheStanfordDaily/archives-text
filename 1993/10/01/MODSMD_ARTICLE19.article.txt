# Manning makes all the right adjustments
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
As any football player that has
ever participated in a Bill Walsh

style offense can tell you, being a
wide receiver is not an easy job. In
much the same way that the quar
terback must read the defense and
call the appropriate play, the

receiver must figure out how the
cornerbacks and safeties are
defending him and make the
appropriate adjustments in his
patterns.

Freshman Brian Manning is
learning to make many adjust
ments, and not just how to find
the soft spot in zone coverage.
Manning is also quickly learning
— on the job — how be a featured
receiver in Division I college foot
ball.
"The biggest adjustments have
been learning the new plays and
learning the proper techniques to
running my routes," Manning
said. "And the plays — there are a
tremendous amount of plays we
have to learn."
But adjustments haven't been
a difficult thing for Manning, who,
at different stages in his career,
has been a quarterback, a running
back, a cornerback and even a 50-
pound lineman way back in the
Kansas City Pee Wee League,
when his biggest competition was
current Cardinal teammate and
fellow receiver Leroy Pruitt.
"I grew up playing against
[Pruitt] — ever since we were lit
tle," Manning said. "He was
always on the championship team
and I was always on the losing
team."
After entering high school and
going through a few adjustments,
Manning finally found a home
playing both cornerback and slot
back, which is a cross between a
running back and a receiver. And
he also found success, scoring 15
touchdowns as a senior — includ
ing five on punt and kickoff
returns.
By spring of his junior year,
Manning had another adjustment
to make when he found that col
leges were looking at him for
potential scholarships and that
the possibility of playing collegiate
football was very real.
He narrowed his choices to Col
orado, Kansas, Tennessee, Illinois
and Stanford, with the Cardinal
eventually winning out. Aca
demics had always been important
to Manning, and he wanted to go
to a college where they would
remain an important part of his
life.

"Stanford had the best academ
ic reputation," Manning said.
"They had the best combination of
both (academics and sports). They
had the best to offer."
His friend Leroy Pruitt was
most likely thinking along the
same lines, which meant that
Manning would once again be
competing against his old rival —
only now for playing time. And if
that was not enough, two other
highly regarded wide receivers
also signed letters of intent to play
for the Cardinal.
"It was kind of weird knowing
that I was going to Stanford with
three other great receivers," Man
ning said "But once I got here,
things kind of looked different.
Everybody was new, and you
could really tell that when [we] got
here, because there were some
things we couldn't do. We couldn't
run little basic routes — it was
kind of funny. We were dropping
balls every time."
But after a few adjustments,
the pieces began to fall into place
for Manning and the others.
"The more comfortable we got,
the more we developed," Manning
said. "And now look at us. One of
the four receivers (Charlie Young)
is playing free safety. And Alistair
(White) is developing still and so is
Leroy — everything leveled out."
However, Manning still had
some further developing of this
own to do.
"Another adjustment is that
the intensity is a lot higher than in
high school," Manning said. "In
high school you didn't have to
always go 100 percent, but college
football is very intense. In order to
win you must be intense. Coach
Walsh always talks about explod
ing on your opponent. You've just
gotta play faster than your oppo
nent. It's a big thing."
And if speed is a big thing, then
it is not hard to see why Manning
has become such a big part of

Stanford's team in such a short
time. Having been clocked at 4.33
seconds in the 40-yard dash, Man
ning was tabbed early on as a
speedy deep threat to complement
Justin Armour, a more heavily fea
tured possession receiver on the
other side. But that adjustment
was no problem.
"I'm happy with that role,"
Manning said. "Right now I'm just
doing it on situations, because
there's a lot I need to learn."
When Manning does finish
"learning," opposing coaches will
have a difficult time adjusting.
Already, Manning has made his
presence known. Against Colorado,
he caught a critical touchdown
pass, and against UCLA, he caught
five passes for 95 yards and a
touchdown. But despite the break
through, the loss to the Bruins did
not rest easy with Manning.
"It felt good, but on the other
hand we lost, so that kind of down
played everything," Manning said.
"It wasn't as good as it could have

been if we had won."
Winning is something that
Manning and his teammates are
thinking about very seriously for
this weekend, when No. 4-ranked
Notre Dame comes to the Farm.
"We're looking better than how
we have been looking," Manning
said. "Spirits aren't down like
everybody thought they would be.
We're pretty much ready to go in
there and beat them."
Manning will likely beat many
more competitors this spring when
he competes on the track team in
the triple jump. In high school, he
was the three-time state champion
in that event, with a personal best
of 51 feet (which would place him
near the top of the list of Stanford's
all-time best jumps).
But until track season gets here,
Manning will have to deal with the
cornerbacks, who may soon be dou
ble-covering him. And that will
probably take another adjustment.
"[The defensive players arel a
lot faster, and a lot stronger," Man
ning said. "Everything's an adjust
ment. I didn't have a quarterback
in high school — the arm and the
passes and everything. That was a
real big adjustment, too. All

receivers got here and it was like
you were getting a bullet, like you
were catching a bullet."
And was that difficult?

"At first it was, but now it's
nothing," said Manning with a
shrug of the shoulders, "now that
I've adjusted."

"It wasn't as good as it could have

been if we had won."
Winning is something that
Manning and his teammates are
thinking about very seriously for
this weekend, when No. 4-ranked
Notre Dame comes to the Farm.
"We're looking better than how
we have been looking," Manning
said. "Spirits aren't down like
everybody thought they would be.
We're pretty much ready to go in
there and beat them."
Manning will likely beat many
more competitors this spring when
he competes on the track team in
the triple jump. In high school, he
was the three-time state champion
in that event, with a personal best
of 51 feet (which would place him
near the top of the list of Stanford's
all-time best jumps).
But until track season gets here,
Manning will have to deal with the
cornerbacks, who may soon be dou
ble-covering him. And that will
probably take another adjustment.
"[The defensive players arel a
lot faster, and a lot stronger," Man
ning said. "Everything's an adjust
ment. I didn't have a quarterback
in high school — the arm and the
passes and everything. That was a
real big adjustment, too. All

receivers got here and it was like
you were getting a bullet, like you
were catching a bullet."
And was that difficult?

"At first it was, but now it's
nothing," said Manning with a
shrug of the shoulders, "now that
I've adjusted."
As any football player that has
ever participated in a Bill Walsh

style offense can tell you, being a
wide receiver is not an easy job. In
much the same way that the quar
terback must read the defense and
call the appropriate play, the

receiver must figure out how the
cornerbacks and safeties are
defending him and make the
appropriate adjustments in his
patterns.

Freshman Brian Manning is
learning to make many adjust
ments, and not just how to find
the soft spot in zone coverage.
Manning is also quickly learning
— on the job — how be a featured
receiver in Division I college foot
ball.
"The biggest adjustments have
been learning the new plays and
learning the proper techniques to
running my routes," Manning
said. "And the plays — there are a
tremendous amount of plays we
have to learn."
But adjustments haven't been
a difficult thing for Manning, who,
at different stages in his career,
has been a quarterback, a running
back, a cornerback and even a 50-
pound lineman way back in the
Kansas City Pee Wee League,
when his biggest competition was
current Cardinal teammate and
fellow receiver Leroy Pruitt.
"I grew up playing against
[Pruitt] — ever since we were lit
tle," Manning said. "He was
always on the championship team
and I was always on the losing
team."
After entering high school and
going through a few adjustments,
Manning finally found a home
playing both cornerback and slot
back, which is a cross between a
running back and a receiver. And
he also found success, scoring 15
touchdowns as a senior — includ
ing five on punt and kickoff
returns.
By spring of his junior year,
Manning had another adjustment
to make when he found that col
leges were looking at him for
potential scholarships and that
the possibility of playing collegiate
football was very real.
He narrowed his choices to Col
orado, Kansas, Tennessee, Illinois
and Stanford, with the Cardinal
eventually winning out. Aca
demics had always been important
to Manning, and he wanted to go
to a college where they would
remain an important part of his
life.

"Stanford had the best academ
ic reputation," Manning said.
"They had the best combination of
both (academics and sports). They
had the best to offer."
His friend Leroy Pruitt was
most likely thinking along the
same lines, which meant that
Manning would once again be
competing against his old rival —
only now for playing time. And if
that was not enough, two other
highly regarded wide receivers
also signed letters of intent to play
for the Cardinal.
"It was kind of weird knowing
that I was going to Stanford with
three other great receivers," Man
ning said "But once I got here,
things kind of looked different.
Everybody was new, and you
could really tell that when [we] got
here, because there were some
things we couldn't do. We couldn't
run little basic routes — it was
kind of funny. We were dropping
balls every time."
But after a few adjustments,
the pieces began to fall into place
for Manning and the others.
"The more comfortable we got,
the more we developed," Manning
said. "And now look at us. One of
the four receivers (Charlie Young)
is playing free safety. And Alistair
(White) is developing still and so is
Leroy — everything leveled out."
However, Manning still had
some further developing of this
own to do.
"Another adjustment is that
the intensity is a lot higher than in
high school," Manning said. "In
high school you didn't have to
always go 100 percent, but college
football is very intense. In order to
win you must be intense. Coach
Walsh always talks about explod
ing on your opponent. You've just
gotta play faster than your oppo
nent. It's a big thing."
And if speed is a big thing, then
it is not hard to see why Manning
has become such a big part of

Stanford's team in such a short
time. Having been clocked at 4.33
seconds in the 40-yard dash, Man
ning was tabbed early on as a
speedy deep threat to complement
Justin Armour, a more heavily fea
tured possession receiver on the
other side. But that adjustment
was no problem.
"I'm happy with that role,"
Manning said. "Right now I'm just
doing it on situations, because
there's a lot I need to learn."
When Manning does finish
"learning," opposing coaches will
have a difficult time adjusting.
Already, Manning has made his
presence known. Against Colorado,
he caught a critical touchdown
pass, and against UCLA, he caught
five passes for 95 yards and a
touchdown. But despite the break
through, the loss to the Bruins did
not rest easy with Manning.
"It felt good, but on the other
hand we lost, so that kind of down
played everything," Manning said.
