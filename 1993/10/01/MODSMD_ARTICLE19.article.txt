# Manning makes all the right adjustments

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
As any football player that has
ever participated in a Bill Walsh

style offense can tell you, being a
wide receiver is not an easy job. In
much the same way that the quar
terback must read the defense and
call the appropriate play, the

receiver must figure out how the
cornerbacks and safeties are
defending him and make the
appropriate adjustments in his
patterns.

Freshman Brian Manning is
learning to make many adjust
ments, and not just how to find
the soft spot in zone coverage.
Manning is also quickly learning
— on the job — how be a featured
receiver in Division I college foot
ball.
"The biggest adjustments have
been learning the new plays and
learning the proper techniques to
running my routes," Manning
said. "And the plays — there are a
tremendous amount of plays we
have to learn."
But adjustments haven't been
a difficult thing for Manning, who,
at different stages in his career,
has been a quarterback, a running
back, a cornerback and even a 50-
pound lineman way back in the
Kansas City Pee Wee League,
when his biggest competition was
current Cardinal teammate and
fellow receiver Leroy Pruitt.
"I grew up playing against
[Pruitt] — ever since we were lit
tle," Manning said. "He was
always on the championship team
and I was always on the losing
team."
After entering high school and
going through a few adjustments,
Manning finally found a home
playing both cornerback and slot
back, which is a cross between a
running back and a receiver. And
he also found success, scoring 15
touchdowns as a senior — includ
ing five on punt and kickoff
returns.
By spring of his junior year,
Manning had another adjustment
to make when he found that col
leges were looking at him for
potential scholarships and that
the possibility of playing collegiate
football was very real.
He narrowed his choices to Col
orado, Kansas, Tennessee, Illinois
and Stanford, with the Cardinal
eventually winning out. Aca
demics had always been important
to Manning, and he wanted to go
to a college where they would
remain an important part of his
life.

"Stanford had the best academ
ic reputation," Manning said.
"They had the best combination of
both (academics and sports). They
had the best to offer."
His friend Leroy Pruitt was
most likely thinking along the
same lines, which meant that
Manning would once again be
competing against his old rival —
only now for playing time. And if
that was not enough, two other
highly regarded wide receivers
also signed letters of intent to play
for the Cardinal.
"It was kind of weird knowing
that I was going to Stanford with
three other great receivers," Man
ning said "But once I got here,
things kind of looked different.
Everybody was new, and you
could really tell that when [we] got
here, because there were some
things we couldn't do. We couldn't
run little basic routes — it was
kind of funny. We were dropping
balls every time."
But after a few adjustments,
the pieces began to fall into place
for Manning and the others.
"The more comfortable we got,
the more we developed," Manning
said. "And now look at us. One of
the four receivers (Charlie Young)
is playing free safety. And Alistair
(White) is developing still and so is
Leroy — everything leveled out."
However, Manning still had
some further developing of this
own to do.
"Another adjustment is that
the intensity is a lot higher than in
high school," Manning said. "In
high school you didn't have to
always go 100 percent, but college
football is very intense. In order to
win you must be intense. Coach
Walsh always talks about explod
ing on your opponent. You've just
gotta play faster than your oppo
nent. It's a big thing."
And if speed is a big thing, then
it is not hard to see why Manning
has become such a big part of
