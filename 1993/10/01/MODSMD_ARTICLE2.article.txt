# Sexual harassment policy gets Faculty Senate's endorsement
## Some still question wording, suggest more revisions

The Faculty Senate unanimously en
dorsed the University's sexual harass
ment policy draft yesterday, virtually as
suring its prompt implementation.
The endorsement comes four months
after the senate initially recommended
that University President Gerhard
Casper revise an earlier draft of the pol
icy. In May, the senate approved the doc
ument on the condition that certain
parts concerning confidentiality and
ambiguities in wording be improved.
Various members of the senate
praised Casper's efforts to rectify the
problems identified last spring, though
additional recommendations and mis
givings were presented in yesterday's
90-minute discussion.
Despite such criticisms, Provost Con
doleezza Rice said that the policy will re

main "pretty much as is."
"I'm glad the senate gave its support
of the policy," she said. "It's a good, de
fensible policy that will protect people
and give us an opportunity to deal with
these horrible situations."
In presenting his policy to the senate
yesterday, Casper highlighted the main
revisions made to the draft over the
summer. Specifically, the revised policy
expanded complainants' options in re
porting informal complaints and fell
"squarely on the side of confidentiality,"
according to Casper.
Casper said that in the revised policy,
"premium is placed on informal resolu
tions (versus formal grievances) of sexu
al harassment complaints" in order to
increase the possibility of maintaining
complainant anonymity.
While faculty members seemed to ap
plaud the new draft's emphasis on infor
mal resolutions, several advised further
revisions, demonstrating that the con

troversies that have surrounded and
often impeded the two-year effort to im
plement an updated policy still remain.
Some raised issue with the formal
grievance procedure, which first in
structs a victim to confront the perpe
trator, department chair, or dean of the
school with the complaint.
Medical School Prof. Frances Conley,
who suggested changes in the policy's
formal grievance procedure during yes
terday's session, agreed that "there is no
question that the University needs a pol
icy in place and we have to have it before
changes take place."
But in an impassioned speech, Conley
— herself a victim in a much-publicized
sexual harassment case — expressed
concern that under the policy, a com
plaint "may well be heard only by a su
pervisor, department chair or dean."
Conley maintained that "power pro-
