# Sexual harassment policy gets Faculty Senate's endorsement
## Some still question wording, suggest more revisions 
### Nami Kim Romesh Ratnesar Staff writers 
The Faculty Senate unanimously en
dorsed the University's sexual harass
ment policy draft yesterday, virtually as
suring its prompt implementation.
The endorsement comes four months
after the senate initially recommended
that University President Gerhard
Casper revise an earlier draft of the pol
icy. In May, the senate approved the doc
ument on the condition that certain
parts concerning confidentiality and
ambiguities in wording be improved.
Various members of the senate
praised Casper's efforts to rectify the
problems identified last spring, though
additional recommendations and mis
givings were presented in yesterday's
90-minute discussion.
Despite such criticisms, Provost Con
doleezza Rice said that the policy will re

main "pretty much as is."
"I'm glad the senate gave its support
of the policy," she said. "It's a good, de
fensible policy that will protect people
and give us an opportunity to deal with
these horrible situations."
In presenting his policy to the senate
yesterday, Casper highlighted the main
revisions made to the draft over the
summer. Specifically, the revised policy
expanded complainants' options in re
porting informal complaints and fell
"squarely on the side of confidentiality,"
according to Casper.
Casper said that in the revised policy,
"premium is placed on informal resolu
tions (versus formal grievances) of sexu
al harassment complaints" in order to
increase the possibility of maintaining
complainant anonymity.
While faculty members seemed to ap
plaud the new draft's emphasis on infor
mal resolutions, several advised further
revisions, demonstrating that the con

troversies that have surrounded and
often impeded the two-year effort to im
plement an updated policy still remain.
Some raised issue with the formal
grievance procedure, which first in
structs a victim to confront the perpe
trator, department chair, or dean of the
school with the complaint.
Medical School Prof. Frances Conley,
who suggested changes in the policy's
formal grievance procedure during yes
terday's session, agreed that "there is no
question that the University needs a pol
icy in place and we have to have it before
changes take place."
But in an impassioned speech, Conley
— herself a victim in a much-publicized
sexual harassment case — expressed
concern that under the policy, a com
plaint "may well be heard only by a su
pervisor, department chair or dean."
Conley maintained that "power pro-
tects power" and that these peo
ple may have a "vested interest
maintaining their work unit ...
(and) do not necessarily have
unblemished records them
selves."
She advocated that com
plainants go directly to a sexual
harassment adviser, bypassing
those with possible biases. Conley
said that without such a change,
the policy would not be "user
friendly" and "will serve only to
show the world that, 'Yes, Stan
ford has a sexual harassment pol
icy in place.' "
Casper conceded that there are
potential abuses of power, but
said that "we should not build on
distrust." He added that "no ver
sion of any policy will be able to
deal with the trust issue."
The president further insisted
that the policy has more than just
nominal importance. "We are
doing something special," he said.
"We are providing a different set
of people to turn to."

Other senate members
expanded upon Conley's com
plaints, raising questions pre
dominantly about details in the
specific wording of the policy.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott inquired about the qual
ifications, selection process and
ultimate jurisdiction of the sexual
harassment adviser, a position
the policy creates.
Meanwhile, Political Science
Prof. Terry Karl, the senate's
most vocal critic of the draft poli
cy last spring, offered further
suggestions for making the policy
easier for victims to use.
Karl advocated adding provi
sos to the policy that stress the
illegality of reprisals by the
accused and the possibility for
outright dismissal based on an
informal complaint. She also said
that any time limits for raising a
complaint should be eliminated,
noting that "timeliness is more
the exception than the rule in
these cases."
While accepting Karl's first
advice, Casper maintained that
the policy already accounts for
delayed reports of harassment
and that dismissing a faculty

member because of an informal
complaint "would be quite unlike
ly." Further, "the possible out
comes listed are meant to give
examples and not exclude other

another year without
a policy on the books.'

possibilities."
Casper, who seemed to grow
more restless as the new criti
cisms mounted, left the discus
sion early to attend an alumni
reception and refused to com
ment on the proposed changes to
the policy.
As the debate wore on, senate
members, too, displayed increas
ing agitation. Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner, for
instance, directly attacked Con

ley's misgivings, claiming that
the procedures outlined in the
policy are necessary to "monitor
complaints systematically."
But Rice managed to wrest
control of the situation, calling it
"a dire mistake" to take the
department chair and school
deans out of the formal grievance
procedure. Such a decision, she
said, would deny complainants "a
wide avenue of choices."
"It's not our place to tell some
one you must see one person
before the other," she said.
Rice also reminded the senate
that the policy would be open for
further elaboration and supple
mentary material, and will be up
for formal review in two years by
a committee comprised of faculty,
staff and students. Those assur
ances appeared to satisfy the sen
ate, which quickly moved for the
vote.
"We're treading on very thin
water," Rice said as the debate
closed. "We've started yet anoth
er year without a policy on the
books."
