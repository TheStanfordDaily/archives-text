# Spikers' sights set on sweep
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
With defeats at the hands of
UCLA and USC now fading into
early season memory, the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team
will try to add two more Pacific 10
Conference victories to its record
this weekend.
Riding a three-game win streak
after sweeping San Jose State on
Tuesday, the Cardinal (8-2, 2-2 in
the Pac-10) heads to the North
west to do battle with No. 19
Washington State (9-1, 2-1 in the
Pac-10) tonight and Washington
(3-8, 0-3 in the Pac-10) the follow
ing evening.
Although the Cardinal out
ranks both of its weekend oppo
nents, Stanford will approach the
matches with its usual intensity.
Last Thursday, the team downed
No. 17 Arizona State 5-15, 15-8,
15-4, 15-7 in front of a home
crowd and then went on to domi
nate No. 20 Arizona 15-4, 15-10,
15-9. Next, the Cardinal contin
ued its Maples run, making easy
prey of the Spartans 15-7, 15-10,
15-13.
During its trip north, Stan
ford's primary challenge will be
combating the unfamiliar offen
sive systems of both teams.
"What I've seen from Washing
ton State and Washington is that
they have the tendency to get a lit
tle wild — a little sloppy," said
head coach Don Shaw.
Hoping to maintain a stable
offense despite the play of its
opponents, Stanford will concen
trate on eliminating its unforced
hitting errors.
"I want to play consistently on
offense," Shaw said. "If they play
a sloppy style, where there are a
lot of errors being made and
unusual ball control and contacts,
we don't want to be brought down
to their level, so to speak."
While all six players must coop
erate in order to eliminate these
errors, Stanford's front-line hit
ters are primarily responsible for
executing a steady attack. Sopho
mores Cary Wendell and Marnie
Triefenbach lead the Cardinal
offensive campaign.
The "spark plug" player of the
starting six, Wendell's fierce left
shot has pounded down 132 kills
on the season along with 334
attacks, for a hitting percentage
of .266. Triefenbach has also tal
lied 132 kills this year, hitting
.275 with 310 attacks and 103
digs. These two are joined by
classmate Wendy Hromadka on

the front line, who has smacked
down 103 kills with 291 attacks
for a .225 percentage.
Orchestrating the Cardinal's
offensive plays, senior Piper
Hahn has set for 416 assists and
has a total of 95 digs. Freshman

Colleen Miniuk, seeing her first
collegiate start against San Jose
on Tuesday, has accumulated 52
kills with 130 attacks.

In what Stanford expects to be
the tougher of the two matches,
Stanford's strategy will be based
on the Cougar's strong ability to
gain the side-out.
"We're going to focus on play
ing better defense," Wendell said.
"We'll try to keep siding-out, no

matter how many times they do."
Shaw hopes that Stanford's
side-outs will halt Stanford's
opponents by controlling both
the ball and the mental advan
tage.
"We want to keep them out
there and get them frustrated,
thinking something must be
wrong because they're not scor
ing points," Shaw said.
His second area of concern lies
in Stanford's high percentage of

hitting errors. The Cardinal has
botched shots 249 times this
year, compared to its opponents'
254.
In the middle of a swing of
four games in seven days, the
defending national champion
hopes to stay atop its winning
crest by staying mentally alert.
"We're trying to stay at a high
level of consistency," Shaw said.
"We need to be a little sharper on
a concentration level."

ford's primary challenge will be
combating the unfamiliar offen
sive systems of both teams.
"What I've seen from Washing
ton State and Washington is that
they have the tendency to get a lit
tle wild — a little sloppy," said
head coach Don Shaw.
Hoping to maintain a stable
offense despite the play of its
opponents, Stanford will concen
trate on eliminating its unforced
hitting errors.
"I want to play consistently on
offense," Shaw said. "If they play
a sloppy style, where there are a
lot of errors being made and
unusual ball control and contacts,
we don't want to be brought down
to their level, so to speak."
While all six players must coop
erate in order to eliminate these
errors, Stanford's front-line hit
ters are primarily responsible for
executing a steady attack. Sopho
mores Cary Wendell and Marnie
Triefenbach lead the Cardinal
offensive campaign.
The "spark plug" player of the
starting six, Wendell's fierce left
shot has pounded down 132 kills
on the season along with 334
attacks, for a hitting percentage
of .266. Triefenbach has also tal
lied 132 kills this year, hitting
.275 with 310 attacks and 103
digs. These two are joined by
classmate Wendy Hromadka on

the front line, who has smacked
down 103 kills with 291 attacks
for a .225 percentage.
Orchestrating the Cardinal's
offensive plays, senior Piper
Hahn has set for 416 assists and
has a total of 95 digs. Freshman

Colleen Miniuk, seeing her first
collegiate start against San Jose
on Tuesday, has accumulated 52
kills with 130 attacks.

In what Stanford expects to be
the tougher of the two matches,
Stanford's strategy will be based
on the Cougar's strong ability to
gain the side-out.
"We're going to focus on play
ing better defense," Wendell said.
"We'll try to keep siding-out, no

matter how many times they do."
Shaw hopes that Stanford's
side-outs will halt Stanford's
opponents by controlling both
the ball and the mental advan
tage.
"We want to keep them out
there and get them frustrated,
thinking something must be
wrong because they're not scor
ing points," Shaw said.
His second area of concern lies
in Stanford's high percentage of

hitting errors. The Cardinal has
botched shots 249 times this
year, compared to its opponents'
254.
In the middle of a swing of
four games in seven days, the
defending national champion
hopes to stay atop its winning
crest by staying mentally alert.
"We're trying to stay at a high
level of consistency," Shaw said.
"We need to be a little sharper on
a concentration level."
