# Booters try to erase a bad start

Excuses, excuses, excuses.
Our lives are full of them.
But for the Cardinal men's
soccer squad and head coach
Colin Lindores, no alibi is good
enough to explain a 1-5-1 record
and a lack of cohesiveness which
is threatening to plague their 18-
game season.
"This team is in a phase of
transition," said Lindores
of his squad, which lost seven
seniors from last year's team.
"But we shouldn't be playing so
poorly. We've got enough experi
ence on this team, so it's not like
we've got eight or nine freshmen
out there stumbling and bum
bling."
The first seven games of the
season have been a disappoint
ment for the team, which has
made NCAA post-season appear
ances the last two years. The Car
dinal has been outscored 20-6
this year, including three
shutouts.
"It's kind of frustrating," said
senior forward Rick Goad, who
has scored four of Stanford's six
goals this season. "This is the
first time we've had a losing
record since I've been here. We're
just not functioning as a unit."
So what exactly is the sore
spot keeping this team from win
ning?
"We don't have an Achilles'
heel this year," Lindores said.
"Our whole leg is struggling.
We're constantly finding ways to
lose rather than ways to win."
And Stanford's chance to
change those ways arrives this
weekend at the annual Cardinal
Classic. Stanford will host UC-
Irvine, the University of San
Francisco and powerhouse St.
Louis in the two-day tourney that
could make or break the Cardinal
season.
"We still have a chance to play
well," Lindores said. "Whether
we're going to do it or not is a dif
ferent story."
Today, Stanford's first
matchup will pit the Cardinal
against the Aardvarks. UCI is
only 3-5 this the season, but has
made mincemeat of opposing
defenses, accumulating 138 shots
and scoring 13 goals in their first
eight games. However, Cardinal

players enter the game with con
fidence.
"This is one of those games
that we expect to win," Goad said.
"We expect to play a lot better
than we have been."
Stanford's second contest in
the tourney will be against the
bullet-biting Billikens from St.
Louis, who have allowed only
four goals in seven games and col
lected three shutouts. Billikens
star forward Brian Mcßride has
scored 10 goals on the year and
nabbed 22 points to lead St.
Louis.
"It would really help our team
out if we got a win against a top
-10 team," Cardinal senior mid
fielder and team captain Joel
Russell said of the St. Louis
matchup. "The defense is losing
confidence, and we're going to try
and tighten things up."
Stanford doesn't play USF
this weekend, but in an earlier
meeting this year the two teams
tied 3-3 after the Cardinal had
three goals called back. "We
played with a lot of passion (dur
ing) that first game," Goad said.

"Unfortunately, our play has
dropped off since then."
Lindores' immediate tactics
for his struggling team include
solidifying the defense and tak
ing the pressure off of the
offense. "We don't want to
always have to come from
behind," Lindores said. "We need
to give our. people the opportuni
ty to score."
Another goal of the team is to
simply win. "The players are
starting to question their abili
ties," Lindores said. "But our
record doesn't indicate what kind
of a team we are."
The team is not looking for
excuses, but Lindores sees his
squad's difficulties as a melting
pot of varied problems. "So much
of this game is the mental
approach. You can talk pass and
receive until you're blue in the
face, but if they're not mentally
prepared it just won't click."
Perhaps that click will kick in
this weekend. "I don't have my
head in the clouds," Lindores
said. "We've just got to look out
ourselves and fix what's broken."

Forward Ryan Collins provides some much-needed offense for
the Cardinal, as he slips by defenders on his way to the goal.
