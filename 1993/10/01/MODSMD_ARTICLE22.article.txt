# Women's soccer battle the Irish
## Stanford hosts a showdown of top-ranked teams 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Stanford's best chance to beat
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame
this weekend may not come from
the efforts of Bill Walsh, Steve
Stenstrom and Justin Armour.
Instead, the ninth-ranked
women's soccer team, led by
senior Sarah Rafanelli and fresh
man Erin Martin, look to topple
the third-ranked Irish from their
lofty perch on Friday, as the two
teams collide at the Bank of
America Cardinal Classic. St.
Mary's and Texas Christian kick
off the tournament, followed by
Stanford vs. Notre Dame at Mal
oney Field. Action continues
Sunday as Notre Dame faces St.
Mary's and Stanford plays TCU.
This tournament comes at a
vital moment in the Cardinal
season.
Stung by an early-season
upset at Washington State, the
Cardinal has not been as focused
as coach lan Sawyers would pre
fer.
"After the loss to Washington
State, it kind of reaffirms how
important every game is,"
Sawyers said. "We can't afford to
lose another game like that, oth
erwise they'll crucify us in the
polls. I think the players got a
good early wake-up call from
that result, and I think they are
mentally tough enough now."
Sawyers is also empathetic to
his players' off-field demands

during this first week of classes.
"That's the most important rea
son they're here. As a coaching
staff, we have to be very con
scious of not pushing them to
where they can't get to."

nal's lack of game-finishing

like [WSU], other

us in the polls.'

power, Sawyers worked the team
extensively this week on high
percentage shots during practice.
He also restructured practice
to start off at an intense pace,
hoping to pick up the playing
speed, as Stanford has had diffi
culty this season starting games
strongly.
A well-played first half will be
a key for Friday's game. The
Midwestern Collegiate Confer
ence champion the last two
years, Notre Dame looks to the
1993-94 campaign as their
breakthrough season.
Sophomore Ragen Coyne, a
second team Ail-American last
year, triggers the Irish offense
from her midfielder position.

The Irish also return seniors Ali
son Lester and Stephanie Porter,
second and third, respectively,
on the all-time Notre Dame scor
ing list in goals scored and total
points.
Much like the Cardinal, Notre
Dame has an outstanding fresh
man class, with midfielder Cindy
Daws topping the list. A
Northridge, Calif., native, Daws
was rated as one of the top high
school players in the nation.
In their only previous meet
ing, Stanford defeated Notre
Dame 3-0 last year. Jen Stephan
scored twice for the Cardinal,
with Rafanelli adding the other
goal.
Stanford's other opponent
this weekend, the Horned Frogs
of Texas Christian, bring anoth
er challenge to the Cardinal.
A very hard-working team,
TCU will force Stanford to play
two complete halves, something
the Cardinal has had trouble
doing this year.
"They're going to be a team
that comes in and plays hard and
never quits," Sawyers said. "Any
time you get a team like that, you
have to beat them, they won't
beat themselves."
Sophomore forward Dena
Dey remains sidelined with
shin splints. Suffering from
the injury incurred this sum
mer, Dey has no specific sched
ule for her rehabilitation or
date she expects to be back in
the lineup.
