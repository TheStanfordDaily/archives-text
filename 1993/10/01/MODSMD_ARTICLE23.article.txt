## Stealing my cradle: a sophomoric plea 
### 
As I watched the OV's doting and the
AA's breast feeding them I couldn't
help myself from thinking, "Hey,
wasn't that my nipple?"
This is an article for Sophomores.
Juniors, Seniors and beyond who still mourn
the loss of their infancy may read on. But
Freshmen specifically, with their bibs and
their bottles and lost puppy charms, should
read no further. They've already taken
enough.
They don't need another stupid article.
They certainly haven't done anything to
deserve it. So I want all those Stanfor
dopolized pugs to know that they can't have
this little corner of page 10.
It's reserved for the Sophomores, my
brethren.
Last week I was a Sophomore. They call
me Junior now. Like some preadolescent
pseudonym for toddlers named after their
parents. "Look at how Junior can tie his own
shoes."
It's been over a year out of Res Ed's nest
and I still don't feel any better. So for now,
at least in spirit, consider me one of you. A
Sophomore.
Question: How long ago were we the
babies?
Answer: Not very.
Days ago we were the loved ones expected
to be clueless on the grounds of Froshness.
We could get away with pooing in their pants
and accidently saying "black." And no one
wanted anything more than for us to try out
for the cushy Mendicants.
Just last quarter the Sophomores of now
were living the life in a cradle. The comfort
able, coddled, carried carnival of a Freshman
year that they — those diapered, drooling,

residentially educated newborns — have
stolen away. Just like the Cuckoo, they've
tossed out our eggs and turned us into
omelets.
Now we're left the jealous older child try
ing to figure out what all the fuss over the
drooling poppin' fresh Dough Boy in the
wicker baby-basket is about.

The little pisher ain't even that cute.
Think. No more live-in advisers. No more
perky RAs who know our names before we
get there. No more, "Excuse me, but do you
know where I might purchase additional
Tresidder Dollars?" Goodbye Mr. CSIC.
The cradle was ours and they came in and
took it and now everyone expects us not only
to help take care of them, but, to pour lemon
juice on the razor burn, to take care of our
selves as well. I idly wonder where anyone
got the idea that we know any better now
than we did last year?
In the eyes of the mysterious bureaucrat
ic "THEY," we're all grown up now. "Wise
fools," THEY say.
At least half right.
Sure we know our way around somewhat.
We've seen Gaieties; watched the Presidents
come and go; and made it through the Draw
without turning all our friends into bitter
foes. We even figured out which side of the

Hum Bio Core is the Fuzzy one, or at least
we know who to ask.
But none of that means that one can find
the Physics Tank. Or locate anything in the
library. And it certainly doesn't qualify any
one to declare a major. \
There's nothing "wise" about us. We're
so confused and starving for THEY's affec
tion that some are actually considering the
Hum Bio core just to carry on the illusion of
CIV.
We have our defenses, of course.
Hypocrisy being number one among them.
We can spot a pack of them all holding hands
on their way back from Sigma Chi, laugh in
listless demur at their white-white Keds and
say, "Look at the Freshmen" with a smug
ness that can only be described as — well . . .
sophomoric.
And then we can hit on them.
Not much else on our side. We're left
choking in the melancholic smog left by the
realization that industrious Res Ed doesn't
distribute its love and attention among their
children as fairly as one's parents might.
The University giveth Sex in the Nineties
and the University taketh away.
Solution?
I'm not quite sure. Whining should cer
tainly help.
Just do something. Anything not to let
the THEY forget about us. Yell and kick and
scream and maybe THEY'II buy you a
Powerbook for Christmas/Hannukah.
Or if we're really really lucky THEY'II
organize a square dance. Just for us. Not
quite the same as a nipple, but it's a start.
Oh, one more thing. If you do happen to
bump into any Freshmen, ask them if they
want to buy my old CIV books.

I'm not quite sure. Whining should cer
tainly help.
Just do something. Anything not to let
the THEY forget about us. Yell and kick and
scream and maybe THEY'II buy you a
Powerbook for Christmas/Hannukah.
Or if we're really really lucky THEY'II
organize a square dance. Just for us. Not
quite the same as a nipple, but it's a start.
Oh, one more thing. If you do happen to
bump into any Freshmen, ask them if they
want to buy my old CIV books.

As I watched the OV's doting and the
AA's breast feeding them I couldn't
help myself from thinking, "Hey,
wasn't that my nipple?"
This is an article for Sophomores.
Juniors, Seniors and beyond who still mourn
the loss of their infancy may read on. But
Freshmen specifically, with their bibs and
their bottles and lost puppy charms, should
read no further. They've already taken
enough.
They don't need another stupid article.
They certainly haven't done anything to
deserve it. So I want all those Stanfor
dopolized pugs to know that they can't have
this little corner of page 10.
It's reserved for the Sophomores, my
brethren.
Last week I was a Sophomore. They call
me Junior now. Like some preadolescent
pseudonym for toddlers named after their
parents. "Look at how Junior can tie his own
shoes."
It's been over a year out of Res Ed's nest
and I still don't feel any better. So for now,
at least in spirit, consider me one of you. A
Sophomore.
Question: How long ago were we the
babies?
Answer: Not very.
Days ago we were the loved ones expected
to be clueless on the grounds of Froshness.
We could get away with pooing in their pants
and accidently saying "black." And no one
wanted anything more than for us to try out
for the cushy Mendicants.
Just last quarter the Sophomores of now
were living the life in a cradle. The comfort
able, coddled, carried carnival of a Freshman
year that they — those diapered, drooling,

residentially educated newborns — have
stolen away. Just like the Cuckoo, they've
tossed out our eggs and turned us into
omelets.
Now we're left the jealous older child try
ing to figure out what all the fuss over the
drooling poppin' fresh Dough Boy in the
wicker baby-basket is about.

The little pisher ain't even that cute.
Think. No more live-in advisers. No more
perky RAs who know our names before we
get there. No more, "Excuse me, but do you
know where I might purchase additional
Tresidder Dollars?" Goodbye Mr. CSIC.
The cradle was ours and they came in and
took it and now everyone expects us not only
to help take care of them, but, to pour lemon
juice on the razor burn, to take care of our
selves as well. I idly wonder where anyone
got the idea that we know any better now
than we did last year?
In the eyes of the mysterious bureaucrat
ic "THEY," we're all grown up now. "Wise
fools," THEY say.
At least half right.
Sure we know our way around somewhat.
We've seen Gaieties; watched the Presidents
come and go; and made it through the Draw
without turning all our friends into bitter
foes. We even figured out which side of the

Hum Bio Core is the Fuzzy one, or at least
we know who to ask.
But none of that means that one can find
the Physics Tank. Or locate anything in the
library. And it certainly doesn't qualify any
one to declare a major. \
There's nothing "wise" about us. We're
so confused and starving for THEY's affec
tion that some are actually considering the
Hum Bio core just to carry on the illusion of
CIV.
We have our defenses, of course.
Hypocrisy being number one among them.
We can spot a pack of them all holding hands
on their way back from Sigma Chi, laugh in
listless demur at their white-white Keds and
say, "Look at the Freshmen" with a smug
ness that can only be described as — well . . .
sophomoric.
And then we can hit on them.
Not much else on our side. We're left
choking in the melancholic smog left by the
realization that industrious Res Ed doesn't
distribute its love and attention among their
children as fairly as one's parents might.
The University giveth Sex in the Nineties
and the University taketh away.
Solution?
I'm not quite sure. Whining should cer
tainly help.
Just do something. Anything not to let
the THEY forget about us. Yell and kick and
scream and maybe THEY'II buy you a
Powerbook for Christmas/Hannukah.
Or if we're really really lucky THEY'II
organize a square dance. Just for us. Not
quite the same as a nipple, but it's a start.
