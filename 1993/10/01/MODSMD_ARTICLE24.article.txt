# Come greet the stars of the Class of '97
## Diversions introduces the four foremost Farm newcomers. Yay! 
### 
To some they are nameless new
comers to laugh at and give wrong
directions to. To Stanford, they are
the future.
And while every new Stanford
student has something to offer our
community, only a few shine at
their own patented wavelength.
These elite students mark them
selves by excelling in their own
fields â€” having changed the world
by such a young age.
After careful searching and
meticulous interviews, Diversions
Tbfeserttyfbtir of the most interest
ing new students at Stanford.
All should take the time to wel
come newcomer Jacob Petty,
famed brother of Tom, who, in his
own little way, has made a name
for himself in rock music.

Rebelling against the "southern
rock" appeal of his brother, Jacob
has traded in his Bender 12-sf,ring
for bagpipes in adopting a new per
sona for himself: McCloud
McHugh, "Balladeer of the Lochs."
This break has brought him beau
coups bucks for our lofty tuition.
From the Band to the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, and all the
way down to a cappella, they cried
for someone like him.
Anyone involved in music at Stan
ford has been awaiting the arrival of
Swedish born, Alabama raised, Hein
rich "Lips" Tanenbaum.
Tanenbaum, the first student to
receive a scholarship for the sousa
phone, has spent the last year tour
ing Eastern Europe with his
unique jazz/conga renditions of
early Beatles tunes.

"I never imagined such a warm
acceptance," said Lips. "Suddenly
all these people want to be my
friends."
The first recognition of Tanen
baum's abilities came at the young
age of 10 when Tanenbaum had
the honor of playing with Dizzy
Gillespie in the 1984 hip-hop
recording of "We Are the World."
Since then his career has skyrock
eted, taking him, along with his 30-
pound horn, to recording studios
around the world.
In one of the boldest moves of
the decade, Niffer Liverpool, the
famed albino dog-child of Farming
dale, N.J., showed the courage to
step from the doghouse into main
steam society.
After years of living in hiding
dodging tabloid paparazzi, Niffer

now has no problem shaking paws
with the public. Indeed, most of
her once-lonely life to this date has
been spent with no one but her
mother, Rex Liverpool, and a tele
vision to keep her company.
"It was so hard changing the
channels with no thumbs," she said.

All hail the grace and style of the
Olympic single-synchronized air
swimming silver medalist Cody
Belmont of Coalinga, Calif.
While Belmont spends most of
his time in the air training, his
favorite hobbies are writing poetry
and gardening.
Belmont was gracious enough
to accept the offer to accompany
University President Gerhard
Casper, himself a weekend air
swimmer, in performing an inter
pretive routine on interactive plu
ralism during the Homecoming
halftime show.
