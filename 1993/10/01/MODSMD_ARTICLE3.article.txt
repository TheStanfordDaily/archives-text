versity!
As part of a Pacific coast tour,
ABC Television's "Good Morning
America" has been filming on
campus for the past two days,
putting together a story titled,
"This is Stanford."
The story will air one day dur
ing the week of Nov. 8, when the
show's anchors broadcast from
the University as part of their
"Great Pacific Coast Highway Bus
Tour."
The actual broadcast with an
chors Charlie Gibson and Joan
Lunden is expected to be filmed
outside of Memorial Church, said
producer Bill Cunningham.
In addition to Stanford, other
"bus tour" stops include the Napa
Valley, San Simeon, Carmel and
Monterey. The roadshow will end
in San Francisco.
It will be the fifth road trip the
show has taken in America, ac
cording to Good Morning Ameri
ca's spokesperson Kathy Rehl.
The first was in the Midwest two
years ago, followed by trips to the
South, Southwest and New Eng
land.
To discover what Stanford is,
the Good Morning America crew
spent two days interviewing stu
dents, staff and faculty while dri
ving around in a golf cart. They

graabed bikers and rollerfcladers
along the way to interview, Cun
ningham said.
Few details seem to have es
caped the producers' eyes; in fact,
students attending the first day of
class Wednesday morning were
serenaded by a rendition of the
show's theme songchimingon the
Hoover Tower bells. The show's
crew filmed carillonneur Timothy
Zerlang playing the song.
While in the neighborhood of
the Hoover Institution, they in
terviewed Distinguished Hoover
Fellow and former Secretary of
State George Shultz, who will be a
guest on the November broadcast.
The crew also interviewed
Roble Hall residents about dorm
life. Keri Bolding, a resident assis
tant in Roble, was asked what it
was like to be a minority and a
woman on campus, Cunningham
said.
"The story will show how stu
dious the kids are here, but also
show how much fun they all
have," he said.
Though they didn't capture
any bike wrecks on film, they did
see some other "pretty comical
things," Cunningham said, such
as "a Japanese physicist scaling
the wall of a building. We will
most probably use that in our
show."
The Hoover carillon was also a
treat for them, Cunningham
said.
"I'm sure that the students
recognized the Stanford hymn
. . . they might have recognized
Good Morning America's theme

song, but I'm sure they were
wondering why they were hear
ing the Addams' Family song
which we made Tim play for us,"
Cunningham said.
Although Good Morning
America is usually aired live,
the two-hour Stanford broad
cast will be filmed a day in
advance because of the time dif
ference.
