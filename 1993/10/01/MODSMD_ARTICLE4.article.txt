# COP hosts first town meeting
## Only 15 students turn out to discuss education costs 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Last night in a town-hall style meeting in
Lantana, the ASSU Council of Presidents
made their first official attempt to generate
student discussion on University issues.
The meeting focused on the costs of higher
education and the ways in which universities
can work to lower tuition and trim excessive
budgets.
Arthur Hauptman and Maureen Mclaugh
lin, both experts in the field of educational
costs, answered students' questions for near
ly an hour on a range of topics from indirect
costs to student loans.
Despite the turnout of only 15 students,
COP member Jason Snyder called the meet
ing a success. "We really didn't expect that
many people," he said. "We will have more
town meetings which will be much better ad
vertised." The COP plans to hold these meet
ings about every two weeks on a variety of top
ics.
After the meeting, the discussion quickly
turned into a referendum on University poli

cies in general, largely focusing on the recent
ly formed Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation.
Students expressed concern about too little
student representation on the commission,
which will be reviewing the undergraduate
curricula at Stanford. The 19-member com

mission will include two students who have
not yet been chosen.
COP members Delia Lopez and Snyder
agreed that students' perspectives are crucial.
"We are planning to set up 'focus groups,' "
L6pez said.

Arthur Hauptman, a higher-education consultant, discusses the rising costs of a college ed
ucation with Council of Presidents member Jason Snyder and others who attended the
ASSU's first town meeting.
These groups would each
focus on specific issues and
explore options, she said.
Snyder also suggested that a
student report might be created
to "complement the work of the
undergraduate education com
mission with more student
input."
But both Lopez and Snyder
admitted that creating change is
more difficult than "just saying
the words."
"We have already met with
(History Prof. James) Sheehan,"
chairman of the undergraduate
education commission, Snyder
said. He added that the COP
plans to hold more student
forums to discuss relevant
issues.
"What we really need is stu
dent interest," said L6pez. "We
encourage students to voice their
opinions by contacting the
ASSU."
The meeting's intended focus
also sparked discussion. Stu

dents asked Hauptman and
Mclaughlin a range of questions
regarding spiraling tuition
costs.
"Almost all of the discussion
over the past few years has said
that cost containment . . . relies
on government grants," Haupt
man said.
But Mclaughlin said, "the gov
ernment has a limited number of
things it can do. ... Its mqjor
role would be to look at exactly
what is happening with research
activities."
Hauptman agreed, saying that
"students should get to the bot
tom of the exact numbers about
where tuition goes.
"I believe that the federal gov
ernment should only provide a
certain level of aid," he said.
That amount, he argued, would
not depend on the specific
tuitions at institutions, but
would apply universally.
"Students would be eligible
for fewer loans at first," he
admitted. "But such a program
would slow tuition increases by
forcing institutions to take into
account the limited amount of
aid available."
