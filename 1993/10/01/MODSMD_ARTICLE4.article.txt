# COP hosts first town meeting
## Only 15 students turn out to discuss education costs 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Last night in a town-hall style meeting in
Lantana, the ASSU Council of Presidents
made their first official attempt to generate
student discussion on University issues.
The meeting focused on the costs of higher
education and the ways in which universities
can work to lower tuition and trim excessive
budgets.
Arthur Hauptman and Maureen Mclaugh
lin, both experts in the field of educational
costs, answered students' questions for near
ly an hour on a range of topics from indirect
costs to student loans.
Despite the turnout of only 15 students,
COP member Jason Snyder called the meet
ing a success. "We really didn't expect that
many people," he said. "We will have more
town meetings which will be much better ad
vertised." The COP plans to hold these meet
ings about every two weeks on a variety of top
ics.
After the meeting, the discussion quickly
turned into a referendum on University poli

cies in general, largely focusing on the recent
ly formed Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation.
Students expressed concern about too little
student representation on the commission,
which will be reviewing the undergraduate
curricula at Stanford. The 19-member com

mission will include two students who have
not yet been chosen.
COP members Delia Lopez and Snyder
agreed that students' perspectives are crucial.
"We are planning to set up 'focus groups,' "
L6pez said.
