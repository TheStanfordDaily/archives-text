# Stanford to establish program in Jerusalem

Stanford students will soon be
able to witness the historic
changes in the Middle East first
hand, through a new University
program in Jerusalem.
After a failed attempt to start a
similar program in the late 1980s,
the Jewish Studies Department is
initiating a new program, begin
ning in 1995, that will allow a
number of students to study at the
University of Jerusalem and re
ceive transfer credit at Stanford.
Jewish Studies Prof. Aron Ro
drigue, who headed the commit
tee that launched the program, ex
pects greater student interest in
the program now because it will
allow students to see first-hand
the ramifications of the recent
peace accord between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation.
"Many universities already had
programs in Jerusalem, and we
thought it would be advantageous
for students to witness the variety
of life and experience in the Mid

die East," he said.
Coordinators of the program
considered several universities in
the Middle East before determin
ing the site, but decided on
Jerusalem because of its devel
oped overseas studies opportuni
ties and because of the city's im
portance as a cultural, historical
and religious center.
Since students selected for the
program must arrange to pay for
the University of Jerusalem's tu
ition, housing and other expenses,
the program will not be a mtyor
expense for Stanford, making it
immune to budget cuts which
caused the programs in Salaman
ca, Spain, and Tours, France, to
close in recent years.
Rodrigue emphasized that the
new campus "is not a Stanford
Overseas Studies Center and is
substantially different from the
other programs," noting that stu
dents will have the opportunity to
directly become a part of the cul
ture in Jerusalem, while living
