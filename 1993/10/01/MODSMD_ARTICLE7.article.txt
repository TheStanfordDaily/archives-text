# Stanford to establish program in Jerusalem
## 
### Cametra Thompson 
Stanford students will soon be
able to witness the historic
changes in the Middle East first
hand, through a new University
program in Jerusalem.
After a failed attempt to start a
similar program in the late 1980s,
the Jewish Studies Department is
initiating a new program, begin
ning in 1995, that will allow a
number of students to study at the
University of Jerusalem and re
ceive transfer credit at Stanford.
Jewish Studies Prof. Aron Ro
drigue, who headed the commit
tee that launched the program, ex
pects greater student interest in
the program now because it will
allow students to see first-hand
the ramifications of the recent
peace accord between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation.
"Many universities already had
programs in Jerusalem, and we
thought it would be advantageous
for students to witness the variety
of life and experience in the Mid

die East," he said.
Coordinators of the program
considered several universities in
the Middle East before determin
ing the site, but decided on
Jerusalem because of its devel
oped overseas studies opportuni
ties and because of the city's im
portance as a cultural, historical
and religious center.
Since students selected for the
program must arrange to pay for
the University of Jerusalem's tu
ition, housing and other expenses,
the program will not be a mtyor
expense for Stanford, making it
immune to budget cuts which
caused the programs in Salaman
ca, Spain, and Tours, France, to
close in recent years.
Rodrigue emphasized that the
new campus "is not a Stanford
Overseas Studies Center and is
substantially different from the
other programs," noting that stu
dents will have the opportunity to
directly become a part of the cul
ture in Jerusalem, while living
and studying with Israeli stu
dents.
Initially, around 10 students
will participate in the two-quar
ter program, which begins in the
winter. The number of partici
pants may increase as student
interest grows and the program
develops.
Participants in the program
will live in dormitories at the Uni
versity of Jerusalem and be
immersed fully in life in Israel.
Because of the "thousands of
American students" already
studying at the University and in
Jerusalem, coordinators do not
foresee any problems with the
safety for the Stanford students,
since there have never been any
previous incidents.
Students will take classes
directly at the University of
Jerusalem, as well as a special
seminar open only to Stanford
students and taught by a local
scholar. One Stanford adminis
trator will also live with the stu

dents in Jerusalem and oversee
the program.
The program, which will be
open to all upperclassmen,
requires students to have four
quarters of Hebrew or the equiva
lent before participating. Howev
er, classes taught in English will
also be available.
Jerusalem will become one of
four non-western sites for Stan
ford students to study overseas,
adding to Kyoto, Krakow, and the
new program in Moscow which
opened this year. Overseas Stud
ies Director Russell Berman is
still working on plans for a new
center in China, which would fur
ther strengthen Stanford's oppor
tunities for study abroad.
Berman said he is continuing
to explore possible sites for a cen
ter, which might be located in Bei
jing or Hong Kong. "We have had
discussions there (in China) and
here to try to find a correct match
between Stanford and the pro
posed site."
Although it is premature to set
a date for opening, Berman said
the center will open as soon as
"the conditions are right and the
site is right."
