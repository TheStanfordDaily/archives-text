# Betas take back old house â€” with new furnishings
## After a year without their digs, 24 new members rejuvenate fraternity 
### Kevin Wack 
A fresh coat of paint, new furniture and a
remodeled kitchen aren't the only new things
about the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house at
557 Mayfield Ave. The Betas themselves have
undergone a rebirth.
After spending a year without a house due
to insufficient membership, the fraternity,
riding the crest of 24 new members, took back
its home this fall.
For Beta president Sloan Johnson, a junior,
the return was especially sweet. As a fresh
man, Johnson pledged the Betas, expecting to
move into the house last fall. But because of
the small size of Johnson's pledge class, oper
ating the house would have run the fraternity
into $12,000-$13,000 of debt. After consider
ing the fraternity's history of acquiring debt
and their general apathy, the University

repossessed the house last fall.
"They were unable to fill their house even
with boarders. We decided it would be better if
we took over the house," said Heather Dunn,
fraternal affairs adviser.
The University gave the fraternity five
years to rebuild adequate membership. But in
only one year, the fraternity gathered enough
members to reclaim their house, which is now
much different than what Johnson and about
30 mostly new fellow Betas remember.
As part of a University-wide capital
improvements plan independent of the frater
nity's membership problems, the building was
slated for a facelift over the past summer. So,
as the Betas worked to gather a pledge class
large enough to reclaim the house, they had a
unique selling point: a beautiful "new" house.
Nonetheless, Johnson said, "It was a risk
because we didn't know for sure Iwhether the

renovations would occur)."
As it happened, they did. Among the
improvements, which cost around $800,000,
were new carpets and furniture, a new
kitchen, a refurbished balcony and a re-paved
basketball court.
"It's beautiful. It's an amazing looking
place," said Matt Mizel, a residential assistant
in the house.
Dunn expressed confidence that the Betas
would remain strong enough to hold their
house. "They seem to really have come togeth
er as a fraternity. I have high hopes," she said.
Johnson said that this year's goal of 15 new
members will not be difficult to attain. "Basi
cally our main problem last year was a lack of
visibility," he said. "[Now] there's a lot more
pride in the house and in the fraternity as a
whole. There's no question we'll hold the
house. We are a stronger fraternity."
