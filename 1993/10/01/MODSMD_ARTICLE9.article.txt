## Yeltsin agrees to church-mediated talks with lawmakers 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris
Yeltsin agreed yesterday to break the
siege of parliament and end Russia's 10-
day-old political crisis through talks
mediated by church officials.
Yeltsin's announcement came after a
meeting at the Kremlin with Patriarch
Alexy 11, head of the Russian Orthodox
Church. The patriarch's offer to mediate
the power struggle underscored the
church's growing influence since the
decline of Communism.
There was no immediate comment
from the leaders of the 100 or so lawmak
ers who have holed up in the parliament
building with a few hundred volunteer
defenders since Yeltsin dissolved parlia
ment on Sept. 21 and called new elec
tions.
Earlier yesterday, Yeltsin's rebellious

vice president, Alexander Rutskoi, toted a
machine gun at a news conference and
vowed no compromise as long as Yeltsin
remains president.
Other hard-line lawmakers have said
they were willing to negotiate if the
church acted as mediator.
Thousands of riot troops continued to
ring the building, known as the White
House. Power, water and phones have
been cut off to the building, and food sup
plies were running low.
Yeltsin said he disbanded the Soviet
era parliament to break 18 months of
political deadlock in which the lawmak
ers slowed the president's free-market
reforms and rolled back his powers.
On Wednesday, Yeltsin gave lawmak
ers until Monday to surrender their
weapons and leave the White House or

face "serious consequences."
A statement issued jointly by Yeltsin
and the patriarch said Alexy urged that
bloodshed be avoided. "The need was
stressed to take measures making it pos
sible to alleviate the situation without
allowing violence," it said.
The government will be represented at
the talks by Sergei Filatov, the presi
dent's chief of staff, and Oleg Soskovets,
a first deputy prime minister. Yeltsin's
aides said parliament would be represent
ed by Ramazan Abdulatipov and Veni
amin Sokolov, high-ranking parliament
officials but not among the lawmakers
inside the parliament building.
Sokolov said earlier yesterday that
lawmakers would surrender their
weapons if the police blockade ends and
the government gives "firm guarantees"

not to punish the hard-liners.
Despite agreeing to talks, Yeltsin
showed no signs of bending on the sub
stance of his dispute with parliament.
Hard-liners have been demanding
simultaneous presidential and parlia
mentary elections in March. But the
president's aides stressed again yesterday
that Yeltsin would not agree to simulta
neous elections, which he has argued
would destabilize the country.
He has called for parliamentary elec
tions in December and a presidential
poll six months later. Yeltsin met with
leaders of his election committee yester
day to continue work on preparing the
ballot.
Meanwhile, he has been issuing
decrees giving pay raises and higher wel
fare benefits to Russia's poor. His oppo

nents, who argue that Yeltsin's reforms
have caused undue economic suffering,
now accuse him of trying to buy popular
allegiance at the cost of accelerating infla
tion.
Some regional government represen
tatives meeting in Moscow yesterday
urged both sides to resolve the confronta
tion and demanded Yeltsin end the block
ade. They warned that otherwise, the
conflict could widen.
Regional power struggles echo those in
the capital: Local administrators appoint
ed by Yeltsin are vying for power with
regional parliaments.
Many regional legislators represent
the same military, industrial, nationalist
and ex-Communist interests that many
national lawmakers do, and they often
lack meaningful popular support.
