# Fighting Irish seek to avenge upset, extend winning streak
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
Fourth-ranked Notre Dame rolls into today's
matchup with the Cardinal at Stanford Stadium with
an 11-game winning streak, including four victories
thus far in the 1993 campaign. In fact, the Stanford's
33-16 victory over the Fighting Irish in South Bend
was the last defeat the Fighting Irish suffered. That
defeat crushed Notre Dame's hopes for a national
championship and vaulted Stanford to No. 11 in the
Associated Press Top 25, which at the time was the
Cardinal's highest ranking in over a decade.
But the 1993 Fighting Irish have been able to con
tinue their traditional winning ways, despite the re
duction in their offensive firepower that came with
the departures of quarterback Rick Mirer, running
backs Jerome Bettis and Reggie Brooks and tight end
Irv Smith, all lost to the NFL.
The Irish defense has more than picked up the
slack; in 1993, the Notre Dame defense has allowed
an average of only 213.8 yards of total offense per
game. Furthermore, their intimidating pass rush has
accumulated 11 sacks this season.
This defensive line has been bolstered by the
strong performances of seniors. "The best guy on our
defensive line right now is Bryant Young," said Notre
Dame coach Lou Holtz. "He's playing outstanding
football." Young, a senior defensive tackle, leads the
team with 3.5 sacks.
Meanwhile, Stanford's defense, ranked third
worst in the nation, has struggled grievously over the
first four games, giving up 516.8 yards of total of
fense per game, 265.3 of them via the run.
Despite these defensive shortcomings, the Stan
ford offense has frequently managed to bail out the
Cardinal with last-minute clutch offensive drives in
its first four games. Two of these contests were de
cided by winning pass plays in the waning moments
of the game. The Cardinal has begun six drives in the
final 5:00 of the game and has scored five touchdowns
— the only time Stanford didn't score was in last
week's 28-25 loss to UCLA, when time ran out on a
late campaign.

Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom, ranked sec
ond in the Pacific-10 Conference in total offense, has
led the Cardinal offensive charge. In 1993, Stenstrom
has completed 67.3 percent of his passes for a Pacific
10 Conference-high 1,216 yards and 13 touchdowns.
Last week against UCLA, he became the first Cardi
nal passer to throw for more than 300 yards in three
consecutive games since 1985, when John Paye accom

plished the feat. His 12 TD passes over the past three
games is the highest total for a three-game stretch since
John Elway tossed 13 during three games in 1980.
In fact, Stenstrom has fond memories of the last
time the Cardinal hosted the Fighting Irish. In 1991,
Stenstrom saw his first significant action at quarter
back in the second half of the Notre Dame match
after the Irish had built a sizable advantage, and led
the Cardinal to three scoring drives. The following
week, Stenstrom was named the starter by then-
Stanford coach Dennis Green and has started every
game for the Cardinal since then.
Holtz had nothing but positive things to say about
Stenstrom. "He's an excellent young man, " Holtz
said. "He shows great courage when he throws, he's
very accurate, he's very smart, he has good peripher
al vision, he protects the ball well. He may be the best
quarterback in the country. That would not be an ex
aggeration. You can make a good case to say that."
Despite Stenstrom's success throwing the ball, the
Cardinal running game has struggled considerably
during the first four games of the 1993 campaign, av
eraging a paltry 61.8 yards per game. However, it has
shown some signs of improvement — last week
against UCLA, Cardinal tailback Ellery Roberts
rushed for a season-high 56 yards, including a sea
son-long 24-yard run.
"I think there have just been a lot of breakdowns
as far as one person missing a block that have stopped
the running game," said Stanford offensive guard
Jeff Buckey. "Everybody has just got to be working
on the same page. There has just been one time where
I've missed a block, or somebody else has missed a
block, and it stopped the whole thing."
According to Cardinal split end Justin Armour,
Notre Dame's style of play will necessitate a nearly
mistake-free performance by the Cardinal squad if
they hope to repeat last year's victory.
"They play a lot of zone, and they're very basic —
they don't try and throw a lot of crazy stuff at you,"
Armour said. "But what they do they do very well —
they force you to beat them. If you execute right, you
can beat this team, but they're certainly not going to
make mistakes."

Last year against Notre Dame, the Cardinal
played precisely that type of mistake-free football in
the second half, outscoring Notre Dame 26-0. "Hope
fully, we won't wait till [the second half] to turn it on,
because we may not have that luxury — we had a lot
of experience last year," Armour said. "If we come
out early and know our assignments and execute
them properly, we should be fine."
