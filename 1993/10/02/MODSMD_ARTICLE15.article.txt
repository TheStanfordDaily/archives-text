# McDougal the answer to Notre Dame's questions
## Senior leads Fighting Irish into today's game 
### Seth Goldstein 
At the beginning of the 1993-94 season,
the biggest question facing the Notre Dame
football team involved the quarterback po
sition.
Record-setter Rick Mirer had been lost to
graduation and the National Football
League, leaving the responsibility of guiding
the Irish offense in the hands of relatively
inexperienced senior Kevin McDougal.
So far this season, McDougal has per
formed admirably, leading Notre Dame to a
4-0 record and a No. 4 national-ranking. In
deed, it is growing clear that the senior may
have provided the solution to the Fighting
Irish's quarterback query.

McDougal's stellar season is all the more
surprising because prior to this year his
game experience consisted of merely run
ning a few series in relief of Mirer. His ca
reer passing statistics were 14 completions
in 21 attempts for 233 yards and three
touchdowns. These may be good numbers
for a single game, but not for an entire ca
reer. It was expected that Notre Dame
coaches and fans alike would feel jittery
about turning over the team to a player as
green as McDougal.

However, when Rick Mirer joined the
Seattle Seahawks, Notre Dame head coach
Lou Holtz had no choice but to give the reins
to either McDougal or the even more inex
perienced junior Paul Fallia. The two quar
terbacks engaged in a friendly competition
for the starting role.
The contest concluded in spring practice,
when McDougal looked impressive and Fallia
was distracted by his baseball-team activities.
Holtz elected to make the senior the No. 1
quarterback, citing his slightly better arm
strength and his extra year of involvement
with the program as the reasons for his choice.
This was not the complete vote of confi
dence that McDougal would have liked,
though; Holtz named Fallia the "number
one-A" quarterback, not a second-stringer,
and said that both the junior and McDougal
would see playing time.
However, when the season actually
began, McDougal took steps to ensure that
he would remain the starter. "I was there [in
the back-up role] for three years, and after a
while I started thinking that maybe that
time [to start] would never come, and when

I got that chance, I had to take advantage of
it." After struggling during the first half in
the Irish's season opener against North
western, the quarterback helped Notre
Dame rally in the second half for the victory.
In the second game of the season, with
Notre Dame in the unfamiliar role of under
dog against Michigan, McDougal had an
outstanding game to lead the team over the
Wolverines, 27-23, in a game less competi
tive than the score suggests. McDougal
completed 12 of 21 pass attempts for 208
yards, rushed for 66 yards and two touch
downs and engineered a crucial touchdown
drive at the end of the first half, a perfor
mance which netted him the Notre Dame
MVP award for the game.
The next weekend, McDougal posted an
other superior performance in a 36-14 victo
ry over Michigan State. However, in last
week's 17-0 win against Purdue the Notre
Dame defense scored seven of the Irish
points directly and caused key turnovers to
set up the other two scores. However, Mc-
Dougal and the rest of the offense sputtered,
a situation Holtz found troubling. "I'm
greatly concerned with our inability to move
the football on anybody," Holtz stated.
In all, coming into this week's game
against Stanford McDougal has completed 38
of 61 pass attempts for 562 yards and
twotouchdowns and rushed for 61 yards and
two touchdowns. He has been given good pro
tection by his offensive line and he knows that
he will have to use that time well to put some
points on the board if the Irish want to com
pete with the high-octane Stanford offense.
"In order to beat a team like Stanford,
we'll really have to play better [than last
week against Purdue] as a team," said Mc-
Dougal. And although the Stanford defense
has had its problems so far this season, Mc-
Dougal is still wary. "I think that Stanford
has made a lot of changes on defense, and
they'll keep on getting better week by week."
McDougal may not be the player that
Mirer was, but in his first four games as the
Notre Dame starting quarterback he has
shown that he knows how to win. But the
senior knows that he still has more work
ahead of him. "I've played well and I've just
got to continue [playing well]," he said.
Only time will tell if McDougal has what it
takes to keep the Fighting Irish where they
want to be — in contention for a national title.

outstanding game to lead the team over the
Wolverines, 27-23, in a game less competi
tive than the score suggests. McDougal
completed 12 of 21 pass attempts for 208
yards, rushed for 66 yards and two touch
downs and engineered a crucial touchdown
drive at the end of the first half, a perfor
mance which netted him the Notre Dame
MVP award for the game.
The next weekend, McDougal posted an
other superior performance in a 36-14 victo
ry over Michigan State. However, in last
week's 17-0 win against Purdue the Notre
Dame defense scored seven of the Irish
points directly and caused key turnovers to
set up the other two scores. However, Mc-
Dougal and the rest of the offense sputtered,
a situation Holtz found troubling. "I'm
greatly concerned with our inability to move
the football on anybody," Holtz stated.
In all, coming into this week's game
against Stanford McDougal has completed 38
of 61 pass attempts for 562 yards and
twotouchdowns and rushed for 61 yards and
two touchdowns. He has been given good pro
tection by his offensive line and he knows that
he will have to use that time well to put some
points on the board if the Irish want to com
pete with the high-octane Stanford offense.
"In order to beat a team like Stanford,
we'll really have to play better [than last
week against Purdue] as a team," said Mc-
Dougal. And although the Stanford defense
has had its problems so far this season, Mc-
Dougal is still wary. "I think that Stanford
has made a lot of changes on defense, and
they'll keep on getting better week by week."
McDougal may not be the player that
Mirer was, but in his first four games as the
Notre Dame starting quarterback he has
shown that he knows how to win. But the
senior knows that he still has more work
ahead of him. "I've played well and I've just
got to continue [playing well]," he said.
Only time will tell if McDougal has what it
takes to keep the Fighting Irish where they
want to be — in contention for a national title.

At the beginning of the 1993-94 season,
the biggest question facing the Notre Dame
football team involved the quarterback po
sition.
Record-setter Rick Mirer had been lost to
graduation and the National Football
League, leaving the responsibility of guiding
the Irish offense in the hands of relatively
inexperienced senior Kevin McDougal.
So far this season, McDougal has per
formed admirably, leading Notre Dame to a
4-0 record and a No. 4 national-ranking. In
deed, it is growing clear that the senior may
have provided the solution to the Fighting
Irish's quarterback query.

McDougal's stellar season is all the more
surprising because prior to this year his
game experience consisted of merely run
ning a few series in relief of Mirer. His ca
reer passing statistics were 14 completions
in 21 attempts for 233 yards and three
touchdowns. These may be good numbers
for a single game, but not for an entire ca
reer. It was expected that Notre Dame
coaches and fans alike would feel jittery
about turning over the team to a player as
green as McDougal.

However, when Rick Mirer joined the
Seattle Seahawks, Notre Dame head coach
Lou Holtz had no choice but to give the reins
to either McDougal or the even more inex
perienced junior Paul Fallia. The two quar
terbacks engaged in a friendly competition
for the starting role.
The contest concluded in spring practice,
when McDougal looked impressive and Fallia
was distracted by his baseball-team activities.
Holtz elected to make the senior the No. 1
quarterback, citing his slightly better arm
strength and his extra year of involvement
with the program as the reasons for his choice.
This was not the complete vote of confi
dence that McDougal would have liked,
though; Holtz named Fallia the "number
one-A" quarterback, not a second-stringer,
and said that both the junior and McDougal
would see playing time.
However, when the season actually
began, McDougal took steps to ensure that
he would remain the starter. "I was there [in
the back-up role] for three years, and after a
while I started thinking that maybe that
time [to start] would never come, and when

I got that chance, I had to take advantage of
it." After struggling during the first half in
the Irish's season opener against North
western, the quarterback helped Notre
Dame rally in the second half for the victory.
In the second game of the season, with
Notre Dame in the unfamiliar role of under
dog against Michigan, McDougal had an
outstanding game to lead the team over the
Wolverines, 27-23, in a game less competi
tive than the score suggests. McDougal
completed 12 of 21 pass attempts for 208
yards, rushed for 66 yards and two touch
downs and engineered a crucial touchdown
drive at the end of the first half, a perfor
mance which netted him the Notre Dame
