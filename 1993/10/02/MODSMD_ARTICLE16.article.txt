# Defensive struggles due to graduation, initiation
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
Of the 108 teams in NCAA Di
vision I-A football, only two have a
defense that is statistically worse
than Stanford's. That's one indi
cation of how much the Stanford
defense has struggled during the
first four games this season.
This year, the Cardinal has
given up an astronomical 516.8
yards of total offense per game. In
the Pacific 10 Conference, that
ranks dead last, over 100 yards
away from ninth-place Washing
ton State.
The party which bears most of
the guilt is the Cardinal run de
fense, which has given up 265.3
yards per game. Among the list of
running backs to gain over 100
yards against the Stanford run de
fense are four tailbacks: Washing
ton's Napoleon Kaufman, Nathan
Dupree of San Jose State and Col
orado's Lamont Warren and
Rashaan Salaam.
Last week, UCLA sophomore
Sharmon Shah became the latest
rushing superstar for the away
team at Stanford Stadium, gain
ing 187 yards.
Though the Cardinal defense
was ranked third in the Pac-10
last season in total defense and
first in passing efficiency defense,
the squad has been crippled by
the graduation and departure of
solid defenders like Ail-American
outside linebacker Ron George,
All-Pac-10 outside linebacker
Dave Garnett and defensive
backs John Lynch and Darrien
Gordon, all of whom currently
play in the NFL.
This season, the Cardinal de
fense has three freshmen at
tempting to fill the shoes of their
predecessors — cornerback Eliel
Swinton and outside linebackers
Nick Watts and Brian Batson. Ac
cording to Stanford Coach Bill
Walsh, playing freshmen at key
positions has almost becoine a ne
cessity.
"Some schools have a program

so deep in talent that they don't
ever have to play their freshmen,"
Walsh said. "But Stanford will al
ways be in the position where we
don't have nearly the depth that
some of the other teams have, and
some of the young guys will have

to play a bit earlier."
Thus far, Stanford's freshmen
defenders have struggled in their
new roles, but Walsh believes
that they have made significant
strides in the first four weeks of
the season. "They're making ex

cellent progress," Walsh said.
"From the first game, there's no
comparison."
Walsh emphasized that going
through the experience of playing
a difficult college football schedule
is the only way his young fresh

men defenders can truly improve.
"A lot of the younger players
just aren't conditioned to the hard
hitting that goes on in college foot
ball," Walsh said. "Give them a
full season, with spring practice,
and they'll be ready."
