# Allegations denied by Holtz and Irish
## 
### Peter Marks Editorial staff 
They are the fourth-ranked
team in the country and boast a
half-dozen All-America candi
dates, but the Notre Dame Fight
ing Irish are only slowly emerging
from the turmoil surrounding a
recently published book.
The work, entitled "Under the
Tarnished Dome: How Notre Dame
Betrayed its Ideals for Football
Glory" is the most controversial
book that no one has actually read
since Salman Rushdie's "Satanic
Verses." It alleges, among other
things, widespread steroid abuse in
head coach Lou Holtz's program.
"Tarnished Dome" authors
Don Yaeger and Douglas S.
Looney also accuse the Notre
Dame football program of player
abuse, double-standards for ad
missions and booster hand-outs.
Their portrayal of Holtz as a win
at-all-costs coach has infuriated
the Notre Dame faithful, a group
with a devotion nearly as fervent
as that which threatens Rushdie.
Notre Dame policy has prevented
Holtz from commenting on the book;
instead, the University released a
statement through the school's exec
utive vice president. In it, the Rev
erend William Beauchamp denies
any wrongdoing in the Notre Dame
football program. "Notre Dame em
phatically denies the premise of the
book," reads the statement. "The
university strives for excellence in
everything it does, including inter
collegiate athletics, but never at the
price of compromising its integrity."
The statement goes on to deny
the steroid allegations, saying not
one Notre Dame football player
out of 1,000 has tested positive for
steroids since 1990. "The position
of coach Holtz on this issue is un
equivocal, and he has on numerous
occasions spoken to Notre Dame
players on the dangers of drug use
and his intolerance for the use of
steroids," writes Beauchamp.
The university also says that in
the most recent NCAA study,
Notre Dame football players'
graduation rate of 85 percent was
matched by only two of 298 uni

versities. And the university de
nies the existence of a double
standard between its athletes and
other students.
The Notre Dame faithful are not
the only ones rallying to Holtz's de
fense. Stanford coach Bill Walsh
testified to his rival coach's integri
ty at a press conference this week.
"Lou Holtz stands for the best in
college athletics," said Walsh. "My
feeling is that he would never allow
steroids (and) he would never allow
cheating by his coaches." Holtz
also received a vote of confidence
from the athletic director of the
University of Arkansas, the school
where he served as head football
coach for seven years, and from
Gerry Faust, the coach whom
Holtz replaced at Notre Dame.
The book's critics are also fo
cusing on the authors' methods of
compiling their information. Sev
eral of Holtz's former players
quoted in "Tarnished Dome" have
complained of being quoted out of
context. "I refuse to allow a man
like Don Yaeger to benefit from
such blatant misrepresentations
of me and the University of Notre
Dame without my public expres
sion of contempt and disgust to
ward him," wrote one player.
Looney said in an interview
that he was not surprised by the
recantations of several players. He
claims it was to be expected of
young men facing the repercus
sions of attacking an institution as
powerful as Notre Dame's. Notre
Dame admits sending former
players copies of their quotes and
asking if they were aware of how
they were being quoted. One play
er, John Askin, told the university
he was unable to approve his
quotes in a letter dated only one
day after telling Yaeger he was
proud of his statements.
Yaeger says 90 percent of the
84 players interviewed are on
tape. But some critics question the
validity of those quotes. "The alle
gations somehow have to be fabri
cated in a third-hand testimony,"
said Walsh.
Fabricated testimony or not,
the questions surrounding the
Fighting Irish will linger.

of me and the University of Notre
Dame without my public expres
sion of contempt and disgust to
ward him," wrote one player.
Looney said in an interview
that he was not surprised by the
recantations of several players. He
claims it was to be expected of
young men facing the repercus
sions of attacking an institution as
powerful as Notre Dame's. Notre
Dame admits sending former
players copies of their quotes and
asking if they were aware of how
they were being quoted. One play
er, John Askin, told the university
he was unable to approve his
quotes in a letter dated only one
day after telling Yaeger he was
proud of his statements.
Yaeger says 90 percent of the
84 players interviewed are on
tape. But some critics question the
validity of those quotes. "The alle
gations somehow have to be fabri
cated in a third-hand testimony,"
said Walsh.
Fabricated testimony or not,
the questions surrounding the
Fighting Irish will linger.

Despite starting the season with a 4-0 record, Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz has plenty to frown about.
