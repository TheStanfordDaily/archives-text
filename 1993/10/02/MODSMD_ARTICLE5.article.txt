# Armour finds comfortable niche in Stanford offense
## 
### Peter Marks Editorial staff 
For Justin Armour, Stanford's
star split end, the days of being
student government and senior
class president are over. And in
stead of editing the school news
paper, Armour now appears in it,
usually making yet another spec
tacular catch for the Cardinal.
Yes, those glory days at Manitou
High in Colorado are long gone.
"[In high school,] everything was
fun," said Armour. "That's all it
was, was fun."
But college has placed limita
tions on Armour. Since his arrival
on the Farm three years ago, the
junior just hasn't had the time for
a wide array of activities. Well,
maybe a few. He has managed to
play football and basketball for
the Cardinal. And he has also been
able to participate in numerous
outreach programs, all while
maintaining a 3.35 grade-point
average as a public policy major.

Football is the extracurricular
activity in which Armour has ex
celled. The split end has caught a
touchdown pass in each of Stan
ford's last three games. Armour,
of course, catches a lot more pass
es than just touchdowns. He
ranks second in the Pacific 10
Conference and fifth nationally in
receptions per game with 7.5. (He
also ranks second in the Pac-10
and fifteenth nationally in receiv
ing yardage at 104 yards per
game.) If he keeps his current
pace, Armour will catch 82 passes
this year, breaking Brad Muster's
single-season record of 78 catches,
set in 1985.
That Armour is catching any
passes at all is surprising. After
all, the junior came to Stanford as
one of the most highly-touted
quarterbacks in the country. Soon
after his arrival at Stanford, Ar
mour was converted into a wide
receiver. Then he was converted
into a tight end. Then into a split
end. Armour now plays a combi
nation of the latter two positions
in order to get him onto the field
as often as possible.

Armour convinced Stanford
coaches he belonged on the field
last year, when he averaged 17.4
yards per catch. This year, howev
er, he has played like a man pos
sessed. Against UCLA, Armour
was knocked out of the game with
a minor concussion in the third
quarter. He missed only two se
ries, and caught a touchdown pass
later in the fourth quarter. "He's
stepping forward every week, get
ting more confidence," said Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh. "He just
does a marvelous job."
While Armour may not have
tremendous speed, at 6-foot-6 and
215 pounds he is a big target for

Justin Armour makes one of his six catches against UCLA last week, boosting his already prodigious season totals.
