# Armour finds comfortable niche in Stanford offense
## 
### Peter Marks Editorial staff 
For Justin Armour, Stanford's
star split end, the days of being
student government and senior
class president are over. And in
stead of editing the school news
paper, Armour now appears in it,
usually making yet another spec
tacular catch for the Cardinal.
Yes, those glory days at Manitou
High in Colorado are long gone.
"[In high school,] everything was
fun," said Armour. "That's all it
was, was fun."
But college has placed limita
tions on Armour. Since his arrival
on the Farm three years ago, the
junior just hasn't had the time for
a wide array of activities. Well,
maybe a few. He has managed to
play football and basketball for
the Cardinal. And he has also been
able to participate in numerous
outreach programs, all while
maintaining a 3.35 grade-point
average as a public policy major.

Football is the extracurricular
activity in which Armour has ex
celled. The split end has caught a
touchdown pass in each of Stan
ford's last three games. Armour,
of course, catches a lot more pass
es than just touchdowns. He
ranks second in the Pacific 10
Conference and fifth nationally in
receptions per game with 7.5. (He
also ranks second in the Pac-10
and fifteenth nationally in receiv
ing yardage at 104 yards per
game.) If he keeps his current
pace, Armour will catch 82 passes
this year, breaking Brad Muster's
single-season record of 78 catches,
set in 1985.
That Armour is catching any
passes at all is surprising. After
all, the junior came to Stanford as
one of the most highly-touted
quarterbacks in the country. Soon
after his arrival at Stanford, Ar
mour was converted into a wide
receiver. Then he was converted
into a tight end. Then into a split
end. Armour now plays a combi
nation of the latter two positions
in order to get him onto the field
as often as possible.

Armour convinced Stanford
coaches he belonged on the field
last year, when he averaged 17.4
yards per catch. This year, howev
er, he has played like a man pos
sessed. Against UCLA, Armour
was knocked out of the game with
a minor concussion in the third
quarter. He missed only two se
ries, and caught a touchdown pass
later in the fourth quarter. "He's
stepping forward every week, get
ting more confidence," said Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh. "He just
does a marvelous job."
While Armour may not have
tremendous speed, at 6-foot-6 and
215 pounds he is a big target for

Justin Armour makes one of his six catches against UCLA last week, boosting his already prodigious season totals.
quarterback Steve Stenstrom to
hit. And when Stenstrom does fire
to Armour, the split end finishes
the play. "He's just a great all
around athlete," said Stenstrom.
Armour is not just a great all
around athlete, he is a great all
around student-athlete. Last year,
Armour received an Academic All-
Pac-10 honorable mention award.
This week, Armour will be pre
sented with the Honda Scholar
Athlete Award, granted to Division
I football players who show excep
tional performance in scholastic
and athletic endeavors. Honda will
donate $3,000 to the Stanford Uni
versity general scholarship fund in

the junior's honor.
If Notre Dame had its way, that
$3,000 would be going to its schol
arship fund. When Armour in
formed Notre Dame during his se
nior year that he would be attend
ing Stanford, he got an earful.
"You're saying you want to go
4-7 every year and never play in a
major bowl," replied a Notre
Dame assistant coach. Three
years later, Armour still remem
bers that response. But the split
end knows that his game goes be
yond mere individual perfor
mances. "We're at a part in our
season where a win in this type of
game could just do wonders for
us," said Armour.
Win or lose, Armour will get an
other crack at the Fighting Irish.
"He still has another year and I
think by the end of that year he'll be

one of the top guys in the country,"
said Walsh. "I think he'll be an All-
American before he graduates."
And after that?
The NFL may call, though Ar
mour would likely be converted
back to a tight end. If not, the ju
nior said he won't feel set back. He
plans an emphasis on educational
systems in his public policy major
and would like to settle in an occu
pation where he can work with
people in a hands-on capacity. "I
can't imagine seeing myself sitting
behind a desk," said Armour.
As he strides down the field,
hands spread in front of him ready
to cradle another touchdown pass,
or speaks to a group of Oakland
teenagers from broken homes
about staying in school, can any
one imagine Justin Armour sit
ting behind a desk?
