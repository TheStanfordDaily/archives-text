# Notre Dame/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Dawson is the lone returning reg
ular at any of the skill positions
for Notre Dame this season. He's
not a burner, but when the Fight
ing Irish aren't pounding the ball
on the ground, Dawson is a solid
possession receiver. His counter
part, Armour, is having a brilliant
season that could etch him into
the Stanford record books for
most receptions in a season. Ar
mour has caught a touchdown in
each of the last three games and is
a key to the Cardinal attack.

McDougal showed what he could
do against a strong Michigan de
fensive line, now he's liclring his
chops at the thought of running
the option against the Cardinal
defense. However, McDougal'may
not be totally comfortable after
coach Lou Holtz failed to give him
an unequivocal vote of confidence
this past week. Stenstrom, by con
trast, is riding high, averaging 304
yards passing per game. At his
current pace, he would break
John Elway's 1982 school record
for yardage in a season.

McDougal has only been sacked
twice this season, and Taylor, a
Lombardi award semifinalist, is
one of the main reasons why.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh is
singing Taylor's praises, too, call
ing Taylor perhaps the best offen
sive lineman in the country.
Carder, like most of his cohorts on
the defensive line, hasn't regis
tered a sack yet this season. He'll
have his hands full trying to get
past Taylor.

Burris recorded nine tackles for
the Fighting Irish against Stan
ford last season. This season, the
senior tri-captain was tabbed a
pre-season All-American by sever
al publications. He is a great ath
lete who occasionally plays tail
back in goal-line situations. Shaw,
the veteran of the Stanford receiv
ing corps, had a big game against
San Jose State. But freshman
Brian Manning is showing great
potential and will be getting a
good deal of Shaw's playing time.

Young, a senior, is averaging al
most a sack a game and has 37
tackles. He is another preseason
Ail-American pick. He's part of a
defensive line that has limited op
ponents to just 85.2 rushing yards
per game. Buckey, one of the top
offensive line recruits in the na
tion two years ago, will try to hin
der, if not halt, Young.

The Notre Dame mascot appears
to be a leprechaun, but his fight
ing stance demonstrates a violent
demeanor. He should be out pick
ing four-leaf clovers, blue stars,
purple diamonds. ... He must be
the shrimp whose gold was stolen
in the classic film "Leperachaun."
Also, he seems to be smoking a
joint rather than a pipe. Now look
at the Stanford tree. Those eyes,
those leaves. Is there any compar
ison?
