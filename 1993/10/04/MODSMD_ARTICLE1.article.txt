# Stanford honors interned alums
## 24 Japanese-American students sent to camps in 1942 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
At a Friday night recognition ceremony for Japanese-
American alumni, University President Gerhard Casper
acknowledged the past discrimination and wrongs that
put 24 Stanford students in World War II internment
camps in the spring of 1942.
"All three branches of government failed," Casper
said. "It was not the Constitution that failed, but the in
stitutions that failed the Constitution.
"The discrimination was based on ethnic, cultural
stereotypes... and the assumption that the assimilation
of Japanese-Americans was less than perfect," he said.
Former internees were presented with plaques, T
shirts and posters from Stanford University Nikkei, a
Japanese-American student group, commemorating the
reunion of those Japanese-American students who were
evacuated during the war.
In an attempt to defer the honors showered upon
them, one of the internees, Wataru Takeshita, said, "We
didn't do anything. We were just in the wrong place at
the wrong time."
The ceremony in Campbell Recital Hall, which was
filled close to its 200-seat capacity, honored the in
ternees who returned with remarks from the Rev. Diana
Akiyama, associate dean of Memorial Church; Ray
Lyman Wilbur, 111, whose grandfather was president of
the University in 1942; Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako; student leaders from campus Japanese-
American and Native American organizations, as well as
Casper.

Yanagisako noted that some from the war period
would be surprised to see the former internees honored
at a ceremony led by Akiyama "a sansei — third-genera
tion Japanese-American — priest, and even more sur
prisingly, a Japanese-American woman . . . myself, an
anthropology professor who is also a sansei Japanese-

American woman, and that the
president inviting them back
would be a German immigrant."
She placed much of the blame
for "America's worst wartime mis
take" on cultural stereotypes. "We
can recognize these caricatures for
what they are (now). Fifty years
ago it was much harder to do so,"
she said.
Sophomore Maris sr. Flannery
and junior Myra Parker of the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation gave each of the nine for
mer internees who attended silver

feathers to recognize their
strength and the "little-known
connection between Native Ameri
cans and Japanese-Americans ...
both forced against our wills onto
reservations."
The ceremony was the culmina
tion of a weekend of events honor
ing and recognizing the wartime
internment of the Japanese-Amer
icans.
The rededication of Okada
house also honored the former
internees. To allow access to dis
abled students, the Japanese-
American theme house was
moved this fall from its original
location, now occupied by
Junipero, to the space that was
formerly Madera.

At the ceremony held earlier in
the afternoon, Asian-American
student leaders called attention to
the original charter of the house
and "what it is to be an Asian-
American at Stanford."
A plaque was presented to the
former internees after a reading of
its inscription, which recalled the
federally ordered evacuation of
1942 and asked for the remem
brance of Japanese-American
alumni not present.
The occasion also served to con
tinue discussion on the issue of
Asian-American studies. Anthro
pology Prof. Harumi Befu urged
students to take a strong stance on
their agenda.
"Unless there's a movement

from the student body asking and
demanding aggressively (for an
Asian-American studies program,
Stanford University) is not going
to budge because of the budget,"
Befu said.
"The Asian-American popula
tion is 24 percent of the school, he
continued.
"There's no reason Stanford
shouldn't have an institutional
ized program."
Befu also invoked memories of
past Asian-American students at
Stanford in his speech, referring to
Vietnam War-era activism.
"Okada has been very active
since the first year... and I trust
that you people will carry on that
legacy into this year," Befu said.

Tetsuo Okada, one of 24 former Stanford students who were evacuated to Japanese internment camps in 1942,
greets University President Gerhard Casper in Campbell Recital Hall on Friday after a recognition ceremony for
the Japanese-Americans.
American woman, and that the
president inviting them back
would be a German immigrant."
She placed much of the blame
for "America's worst wartime mis
take" on cultural stereotypes. "We
can recognize these caricatures for
what they are (now). Fifty years
ago it was much harder to do so,"
she said.
Sophomore Maris sr. Flannery
and junior Myra Parker of the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation gave each of the nine for
mer internees who attended silver

feathers to recognize their
strength and the "little-known
connection between Native Ameri
cans and Japanese-Americans ...
both forced against our wills onto
reservations."
The ceremony was the culmina
tion of a weekend of events honor
ing and recognizing the wartime
internment of the Japanese-Amer
icans.
The rededication of Okada
house also honored the former
internees. To allow access to dis
abled students, the Japanese-
American theme house was
moved this fall from its original
location, now occupied by
Junipero, to the space that was
formerly Madera.

At the ceremony held earlier in
the afternoon, Asian-American
student leaders called attention to
the original charter of the house
and "what it is to be an Asian-
American at Stanford."
A plaque was presented to the
former internees after a reading of
its inscription, which recalled the
federally ordered evacuation of
1942 and asked for the remem
brance of Japanese-American
alumni not present.
The occasion also served to con
tinue discussion on the issue of
Asian-American studies. Anthro
pology Prof. Harumi Befu urged
students to take a strong stance on
their agenda.
"Unless there's a movement

from the student body asking and
demanding aggressively (for an
Asian-American studies program,
Stanford University) is not going
to budge because of the budget,"
Befu said.
"The Asian-American popula
tion is 24 percent of the school, he
continued.
"There's no reason Stanford
shouldn't have an institutional
ized program."
Befu also invoked memories of
past Asian-American students at
Stanford in his speech, referring to
Vietnam War-era activism.
"Okada has been very active
since the first year... and I trust
that you people will carry on that
legacy into this year," Befu said.
