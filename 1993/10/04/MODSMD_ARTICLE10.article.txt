## Editorial Clearing campus air

The banning of cigarette
sales on campus violates
personal rights, liberties

SOON THOSE SMELLY,
cough-inducing clouds of
smoke commonly found out
side building doors, inside a profes
sor's office or wafting over the
seats at an athletic event will be a
distant memory.
Spurred by studies demonstrat
ing the dangers of second-hand
smoke, the University will ban
smoking in all closed buildings,
covered walkways and University
sponsored events, whether inside
or outside, effective Oct. 15.
Such a stringent policy is a
breath of fresh air for non-smok
ers. Previous University policy,
which prohibits smoking "in indoor
locations where smokers and non
smokers occupy the same area,"
did little to prevent non-smokers
from having to inhale smoke-filled
air when leaving a building or
entering a private office.
But when it comes to forbidding
the sale of cigarettes on campus,
the policy goes too far. While moti
vations behind the sales ban may
be noble — it will be harder for
those living and working on cam
pus to get cigarettes, leading to
fewer violations of the policy — it's
an overzealous encroachment on
personal liberty.
Granted, many medical experts
have long documented the dangers
of smoking — and more recently,
the carcinogenic effects of second
hand smoke. But that doesn't give
Stanford the right to tell people
they can't harm themselves in loca
tions far removed from others.
Banning the sale of cigarettes on
campus also discriminates against
less well-to-do smokers. Students
who have cars can easily drive off
campus for a pack of menthols. But
many, especially foreign graduate
students, have little more than a
bicycle with which to trek to local

stores.
Banning the sale of tobacco
products at Tresidder Express will
not benefit students or the Univer
sity. It will not deter brazen smok
ers who will insist on violating the
policy, and it will unnecessarily
inconvenience smokers who will
abide by the new regulations.
If the University's motivation
for the sales ban is not simply to
curtail infractions by curbing sup
ply, but to reach a moral high
ground by rejecting any financial
reward from the sale of tobacco
products, there are compromises
available:
• The University could re-negoti
ate a lease with Tresidder Express
in which the lease fee is based on
non-tobacco revenues;
• The University could continue
the current revenue-based (tobacco
included) lease, but donate a por
tion of the lease money to either
smoking cessation programs or
Medical Center cancer research;
• In conjunction with either of
the two other compromises, Stan
ford could also prepare a brief
informational sheet detailing spe
cific aspects of the new smoking
policy that would be given to every
purchaser of cigarettes at Tresid
der.
Also, if Stanford doesn't want to
be associated with the sale of tobac
co products, it should divest from
tobacco companies. At the end of
1992, Stanford had invested over
$28.6 million in four tobacco com
panies: American Brands, Hanson
Trust PLC, Loew's Corp. and
Philip Morris. The University
should not be profiting from a uni
versally deleterious product.
But while the University can,
and should, take a strong stance
against smoking, it cannot act as a
"morals police" for its students,
staff and faculty.
Allowing the sale of cigarettes
by a private establishment will not
compromise the policy.
Forbidding it will seriously
question the University's commit
ment to the rights of privacy and
individual expression of those on
campus.
