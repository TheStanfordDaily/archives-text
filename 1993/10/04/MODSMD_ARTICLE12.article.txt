## Gerhard Casper Shaping Stanford's educational future 
### 
FOUR MAJOR chal
lenges that Stanford
faces this year (and,
indeed, in the years to
come) will go far to shape
the nature of a Stanford
education in the future.
The first challenge con
cerns the format, length,
content and quality of
undergraduate educa-

tion. Put most simply, the question is: Col
lege for what? How should we define the
purposes of college education and related
programs (such as advising, residential
education, overseas studies, athletics,
extracurricular activities)? Should there be
requirements in college? If so, what should
they be? What should be the role of the
msyor? What should be the role of values in
undergraduate education? What should be
special about the Stanford college experi
ence? How can we best deal with issues of
class size and research opportunities?
I have attempted to help raise such
questions and have appointed the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education at
Stanford to seek answers. However, Stan
ford's success in finding the best answers
depends not only on the commission's
work, but on students, faculty, staff and
alumni all taking the questions seriously,
discussing them whenever they can and
conveying their views to the commission.
Closely related to undergraduate edu
cation is the question of what stance
Stanford should take on cultural issues.
Some alumni criticize Stanford as having

abandoned a commitment to an "Ameri
can culture." They tell me they will not
support us because they disapprove of
this or that policy. Stanford, including its
recent and present students, has not
been particularly effective in communi
cating with those alumni who are bewil
dered by what they perceive we are doing
and, perhaps, by what they see happen
ing in the country more generally.
I said to the entering freshmen recent
ly that I do not believe that the universi
ty has a right to tell its students who they
should become. This view may be unpop
ular with some. We can expect some live
ly debate, but we must all be sure to
respond with neither slogans nor self-sat
isfaction. Stanford's culture must be tied
to the work of the university: creating
and maintaining the conditions that
make possible the search to know.
A third challenge is how to meet the
rising costs of providing an education
without overburdening students and
their parents. Only 23 percent of Stan
ford undergraduate alumni participate in
annual giving (as compared with 55 per
cent at Princeton). A young alumna of
ours, a lawyer, said to me: "I will not give
to Stanford. Stanford does not need my
$100." But Stanford does need her $100,
and the $100 of each of her fellow alum
ni, if future generations are to have expe
riences equal to hers and your own.
Every student at Stanford, even
among the 40 percent of undergraduates
who receive no financial aid, is subsidized
by the generosity of alumni and friends;

even "full-freight" tuition covers sub
stantially less than the full costs of the
education the university provides. Stan
ford is not a wealthy institution if our
resources are measured against the
quantity, quality and worth of the many
things we do. Stanford's goals are ambi
tious. To reach such goals, it needs every
one's support, including that of present
students when they become alumni.
The fourth challenge is perhaps the
most formidable. As the United States is
seeing substantial productivity gains,
universities, too, must do a better job
with less. That means we must review
our administrative structures and aca
demic programs to improve our effective
ness, and we must maintain opportuni
ties for innovation by terminating activi
ties that are no longer useful or that we
simply cannot afford. This will involve
some difficult choices.
We must continually reexamine all
facets of the university — these and such
others as graduate education and
research. It would be dangerously naive
to assume that universities will be the
only American institutions that can
ignore the changes being wrought by,
among other things, the demographics of
American society, our place in the world
and modern technologies. However, if all
of us take these challenges seriously, I
am confident that Stanford can remain a
leader among leaders worldwide.

and the $100 of each of her fellow alum
ni, if future generations are to have expe
riences equal to hers and your own.
Every student at Stanford, even
among the 40 percent of undergraduates
who receive no financial aid, is subsidized
by the generosity of alumni and friends;

even "full-freight" tuition covers sub
stantially less than the full costs of the
education the university provides. Stan
ford is not a wealthy institution if our
resources are measured against the
quantity, quality and worth of the many
things we do. Stanford's goals are ambi
tious. To reach such goals, it needs every
one's support, including that of present
students when they become alumni.
The fourth challenge is perhaps the
most formidable. As the United States is
seeing substantial productivity gains,
universities, too, must do a better job
with less. That means we must review
our administrative structures and aca
demic programs to improve our effective
ness, and we must maintain opportuni
ties for innovation by terminating activi
ties that are no longer useful or that we
simply cannot afford. This will involve
some difficult choices.
We must continually reexamine all
facets of the university — these and such
others as graduate education and
research. It would be dangerously naive
to assume that universities will be the
only American institutions that can
ignore the changes being wrought by,
among other things, the demographics of
American society, our place in the world
and modern technologies. However, if all
of us take these challenges seriously, I
am confident that Stanford can remain a
leader among leaders worldwide.
