## Hope and fear characterize violent life in South Africa 
### 
AMY BIEHL'S memorial service will
be held Thursday, Oct. 7, at 7 p.m.
in Memorial Church. I did not
know Amy; I did know of her while I was
in South Africa. I was working only a few
kilometers away when she was killed. I'll
be at her service to pay my respects.
I've been asked countless times, why
would anyone want to go to South Africa
now? It's a fair question: South Africa is
in a period of sweeping change. Laws that
shaped people's thinking and behavior
have been swept away in the past few
years. It is a time of great fear. It is also
an opportunity to help a fragile, frag
mented nation make its transition
toward democracy. How could anyone
refuse such an opportunity?
I was invited to work in South Africa
by the Human Science Research Council;
the Universities of Cape Town, Natal,
and the Western Cape; and a small,
impoverished black community just out
side of Cape Town. They wanted to learn
about empowerment evaluation, a new
form of evaluation I've developed during
my tenure as president of the American
Evaluation Association. Empowerment
evaluation is designed to help people in
various social and educational programs
evaluate — or teach others to evaluate —
their own programs in order to foster
greater self-determination. This is a time
when everyone in this new nation is
rethinking and re-evaluating everything
— from reformulating national educa
tional goals to land redistribution. My
hosts felt that empowerment evaluation
would enable South Africans to chart and
track their own course intelligently and
independently.
My first days in South Africa were
spent in Kruger Park, a magnificent free
game park. Majestic lions and elephants
were meters away. Zebras, giraffes, and
impales ranged everywhere. On the third
day I saw a group of lions corner one buf
falo; I could hear the buffalo's moans

behind the brush as the lions devoured it.
This, I was told, was the law of the jungle.
This experience captured the essence of
the jungle, but it was also a poignant
marker between the jungle and civiliza
tion, a reminder that the law of the jun
gle need not apply to human beings. I
wondered if South Africa would succumb
to the viciousness and devastation that
other new nations were experiencing.
I was a little surprised to find normal
cy and routine in the daily life of South
Africans. Johannesburg, Pretoria, Dur
ban and Cape Town are bustling with
activity. Good people in urban and rural
communities are addressing pressing
problems and plan-

ning for the future.
Unfortunately,
violence is also a
part of daily life.
Violence and fear
permeate the con
sciousness of every
South African. The
newspapers have
become a daily
record of stonings,
stabbings, and
shootings.

There is also
anxiety about the future and guilt about
the past. Some young white students,
trained to be cultural and intellectual
leaders, are asking themselves "If I didn't
understand what apartheid really was,
what else don't I understand?" Many
black people are asking themselves the
same question, but from a different van
tage point. Many whites wonder if there
will be a place for them in the new South
Africa, and if so, where. Some blacks are
beginning to question the sincerity of
their black leaders and the likelihood that
they will fulfill their expectations. Every
one is concerned about their safety.
My own sense of safety and security
has been shaken as well. My drive to a

Apartheid has so deeply
permeated the conscious
ness of every South
African that it invades
every meaningful discus
sion.

black community outside Cape Town
passed directly by Guguletu, where Amy
Biehl was stabbed and beaten to death.
The day after her death, while driving
that route, I found myself thinking about
the fact that only one road goes in and
out of the community I was working in; it
would be easy for anyone to close off my
passageway.
These fears slowly erode our sensibili
ties. They operate in the background of
our consciousness and periodically con
front us directly when violence erupts in
daily life.
No one likes to speak of a culture of
violence, but one exists here. Apartheid

has so deeply per
meated the con
sciousness of every
South African that
it invades every
meaningful discus
sion. This perva
sive and systematic
institution created
a clear blueprint
for every town: the
luxurious areas for
the white commu
nity, the downtown

area where the
signs delineating black and white areas
have mostly been taken down, the town
ship for those referred to as "coloured,"
and a rapidly growing community of
squatters representing the black African
community. Although it has officially
ended, the legacy of apartheid continues.
In its most invidious form it robs people
of their future, focusing their passions
and energies on the past rather than on
what is to come. Whites fear that the
oppressed will become the oppressors, as
they listen to the cry "one settler, one
bullet," repeated only days after Amy
Biehl's death.
Many people, however, do not accept
the law of the jungle for human beings,

and maintain a resilience despite this
overriding destructive mentality. Black
students abhor the violence that threat
ens to steal their education away from
them. They organize motorcades to
escort their white teachers to school to
ensure their safety.
Reconstruction demands a radical
transformation of thought and behav
ior. South Africans cannot continue to
drive forward by staring in the rear
view mirror. That mindset is responsi
ble for the continuing culture of vio
lence that diminishes every South
African. In some townships and com
munities, a shift toward empowerment
and self-determination has begun. Elec
tions are on the horizon, and there is no
turning back. The new South Africans
are filled with both hope and fear and
are working toward an open, democrat
ic society.
The task that lies ahead is enormous.
South Africans have no tradition of
democracy, and they have not been served
well by isolation. In addition, the pace of
social change is increasing geometrically.
The new South Africans must carve out
their own destiny. However, they need
not re-invent the wheel. Americans have
some insight into Apartheid, given our
own history of oppression and racial seg
regation. Many of the lessons we have
learned can be adapted to their needs.
Amy Biehl clearly believed that we
could and should encourage the growth
of democracy in the new South Africa. I
believe that we must continue to support
the small islands of hope that may other
wise be lost in a sea of hostility.

have mostly been taken down, the town

squatters representing the black African
community. Although it has officially
ended, the legacy of apartheid continues.
In its most invidious form it robs people
of their future, focusing their passions
and energies on the past rather than on
what is to come. Whites fear that the
oppressed will become the oppressors, as
they listen to the cry "one settler, one
bullet," repeated only days after Amy
Biehl's death.
Many people, however, do not accept
the law of the jungle for human beings,

and maintain a resilience despite this
overriding destructive mentality. Black
students abhor the violence that threat
ens to steal their education away from
them. They organize motorcades to
escort their white teachers to school to
ensure their safety.
Reconstruction demands a radical
transformation of thought and behav
ior. South Africans cannot continue to
drive forward by staring in the rear
view mirror. That mindset is responsi
ble for the continuing culture of vio
lence that diminishes every South
African. In some townships and com
munities, a shift toward empowerment
and self-determination has begun. Elec
tions are on the horizon, and there is no
turning back. The new South Africans
are filled with both hope and fear and
are working toward an open, democrat
ic society.
The task that lies ahead is enormous.
South Africans have no tradition of
democracy, and they have not been served
well by isolation. In addition, the pace of
social change is increasing geometrically.
The new South Africans must carve out
their own destiny. However, they need
not re-invent the wheel. Americans have
some insight into Apartheid, given our
own history of oppression and racial seg
regation. Many of the lessons we have
learned can be adapted to their needs.
Amy Biehl clearly believed that we
could and should encourage the growth
of democracy in the new South Africa. I
believe that we must continue to support
the small islands of hope that may other
wise be lost in a sea of hostility.

AMY BIEHL'S memorial service will
be held Thursday, Oct. 7, at 7 p.m.
in Memorial Church. I did not
know Amy; I did know of her while I was
in South Africa. I was working only a few
kilometers away when she was killed. I'll
be at her service to pay my respects.
I've been asked countless times, why
would anyone want to go to South Africa
now? It's a fair question: South Africa is
in a period of sweeping change. Laws that
shaped people's thinking and behavior
have been swept away in the past few
years. It is a time of great fear. It is also
an opportunity to help a fragile, frag
mented nation make its transition
toward democracy. How could anyone
refuse such an opportunity?
I was invited to work in South Africa
by the Human Science Research Council;
the Universities of Cape Town, Natal,
and the Western Cape; and a small,
impoverished black community just out
side of Cape Town. They wanted to learn
about empowerment evaluation, a new
form of evaluation I've developed during
my tenure as president of the American
Evaluation Association. Empowerment
evaluation is designed to help people in
various social and educational programs
evaluate — or teach others to evaluate —
their own programs in order to foster
greater self-determination. This is a time
when everyone in this new nation is
rethinking and re-evaluating everything
— from reformulating national educa
tional goals to land redistribution. My
hosts felt that empowerment evaluation
would enable South Africans to chart and
track their own course intelligently and
independently.
My first days in South Africa were
spent in Kruger Park, a magnificent free
game park. Majestic lions and elephants
were meters away. Zebras, giraffes, and
impales ranged everywhere. On the third
day I saw a group of lions corner one buf
falo; I could hear the buffalo's moans

behind the brush as the lions devoured it.
This, I was told, was the law of the jungle.
This experience captured the essence of
the jungle, but it was also a poignant
marker between the jungle and civiliza
tion, a reminder that the law of the jun
gle need not apply to human beings. I
wondered if South Africa would succumb
to the viciousness and devastation that
other new nations were experiencing.
I was a little surprised to find normal
cy and routine in the daily life of South
Africans. Johannesburg, Pretoria, Dur
ban and Cape Town are bustling with
activity. Good people in urban and rural
communities are addressing pressing
problems and plan-

ning for the future.
Unfortunately,
violence is also a
part of daily life.
Violence and fear
permeate the con
sciousness of every
South African. The
newspapers have
become a daily
record of stonings,
stabbings, and
shootings.

There is also
anxiety about the future and guilt about
the past. Some young white students,
trained to be cultural and intellectual
leaders, are asking themselves "If I didn't
understand what apartheid really was,
what else don't I understand?" Many
black people are asking themselves the
same question, but from a different van
tage point. Many whites wonder if there
will be a place for them in the new South
Africa, and if so, where. Some blacks are
beginning to question the sincerity of
their black leaders and the likelihood that
they will fulfill their expectations. Every
one is concerned about their safety.
My own sense of safety and security
has been shaken as well. My drive to a

Apartheid has so deeply
permeated the conscious
ness of every South
African that it invades
every meaningful discus
sion.

black community outside Cape Town
passed directly by Guguletu, where Amy
Biehl was stabbed and beaten to death.
The day after her death, while driving
that route, I found myself thinking about
the fact that only one road goes in and
out of the community I was working in; it
would be easy for anyone to close off my
passageway.
These fears slowly erode our sensibili
ties. They operate in the background of
our consciousness and periodically con
front us directly when violence erupts in
daily life.
No one likes to speak of a culture of
violence, but one exists here. Apartheid

meated the con
sciousness of every

it invades every

sive and systematic
institution created
a clear blueprint
for every town: the
luxurious areas for
the white commu
nity, the downtown

area where the
signs delineating black and white areas
have mostly been taken down, the town
ship for those referred to as "coloured,"
and a rapidly growing community of
