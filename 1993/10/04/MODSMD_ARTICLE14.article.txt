# Post-Cold War progress, peril
## Shultz warns of ethnic, economic roadblocks ahead 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Ethnic and economic differ
ences — along with a reluctant
world community — could easily
undermine the world's promising
future, former U.S. Secretary of
State and Distinguished Hoover
Fellow George Shultz warned yes
terday.
Addressing several hundred
alumni at Frost Amphitheater,
Shultz lamented the challenges to
progress that have arisen since the
promising end of the Cold War.
Shultz's speech was the keynote
address for Stanford Reunion
Homecoming 1993.
Calling the maxim "Force
should be used only as a last
resort" a "bad piece of advice,"
Shultz argued that problem situa
tions should be addressed before
they get out of hand, a strategy
which requires much less involve
ment — unlike the United States'
handling of Bosnia's problem.
"I'm standing here as a man
who's trigger happy," Shultz said,
adding that he fought in World
War 11. "I know what force can do.
The world must be willing to use
it.
"I just feel a terrible sense of
shame with what's going on" in
Bosnia, he said. "Europe and the
United States are standing there
looking at this and not doing one
thing about it. . . . We are partici
pants in carving it up."
The problem, according to
Shultz, is that countries are not
willing to use military power to
back up their policies on Bosnia. "I
don't see how you can change [this
situation] without a willingness to
use force," he said.
Shultz criticized the Secretary-
General of the United Nations for
his concern that the use of force
could disrupt negotiations: "I
think the man must be on another
planet. Force is being used all the
time."
The former Secretary of State
under President Reagan also criti
cized the weapons embargo
imposed on the former
Yugoslavia, calling it a "partisan

act" since it preserved the existing
arms imbalance.
While regretting these develop
ments, Shultz also noted the
incredible economic progress
around the world recently.
"We've seen development [in a
variety of countries becausel
they've found their way to market
based economic policies.... Policies
that work economically are policies
that let you have contact with the
outside world," Shultz said.
He explained that more liberal
economic polices will tend to open
up the political environment as
well.
"China is beyond the point of
no return," Shultz said, implying
that political reforms could soon
follow the changes in the country's
economic policy.
More democratic governments

also tend to be less aggressive,
Shultz added. And yet, he said, in
spite of all this promise, "We're all
uneasy."
Shultz also touched on interna
tional trade, praising the open sys
tem fostered by the United States
after World War 11.
He lamented current chal
lenges to free trade, such as the
interruption to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
negotiations, talks which Shultz
said could easily collapse by
December.
"If that fails, protectionism
wins big," he said.
He also commented on the
North American Free Trade
Agreement: "It's incredible that
there's even a debate.... It's a
tremendous political opportuni
ty."
