## Stanford cursed by the luck of the Irish 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Third and long. That may be
the easiest way to describe Satur
day's football game between
Stanford and Notre Dame. While
both teams often found them
selves in situations where they
needed big yardage for the first
down, Notre Dame more often
than not came up with the big
play to get it — and more.
"We played an outstanding
Notre Dame team, and they
played very, very well," said
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh.
"I think early on we held our
own, and then big plays
destroyed us — the kickoff
returns, the long passes. We were
positioned to play the ball and we
were just out-athleted. The man
who was a better athlete — the
bigger and faster man — he just
caught the ball and ran away
from us."
Notre Dame's Clint Johnson
ran away from everyone. He was
barely even touched on two kick
off returns, one for 79 yards, and
the other for 100 yards and a
touchdown. The latter return
came directly after an Eilery
Roberts touchdown run which
cut Notre Dame's lead to 14.
"Offensively, we were all
smiles in the huddle in the third
quarter," said Roberta. "At 13-
27, we were thinking if we can
hold them, it's our game. But
then came the kickofT return for
the touchdown ... and now we
were forced to make the big
plays."
Stanford often found itself
needing a lot of yardage to con
vert on third downs; the Cardinal
had to cover seven or more yards
nine times for the first down,
converting on three. Seven times
on third downs, Stanford needed
at least 12 yards — sometimes

more — for the first.
"We had so many third and
long situations where we had to
convert," said quarterback Steve
Stenstrom. "Third and 10, third
and 12, third and 20, even, and
that makes it tough to be suc
cessful in a game like this."
Notre Dame, which also found
itself having to get the big play on
several occasions, often came up
with a long pass or run. On the
day, the Fighting Irish were eight
of 12 on third-down conversions,
including nine of their first 10.
While the Stanford defense did
show occasional flashes of excel
lence for two downs, it often let
Notre Dame convert on the
third.
"We made as lot of big plays
today," said Notre Dame head
coach Lou Holtz. "I don't want to
be a big play offense, but today
we did. Our receivers had some
great catches, I can't say enough
about them."
Five times, the Cardinal
defense allowed the Irish to make
the first down on third and long
(distances greater than seven
yards). Notre Dame scored three
touchdowns on third downs. And
on a few key second and long sit
uations, Notre Dame was also
able to make the first down.
"I'd be lying if I didn't say it
doesn't demoralize you," said
defensive end David Carder.
"But you just gotta pick yourself
up and say, OK, let's get them
this time, three and out. And
we'd get them third and long and
they'd make a big play, and we
just have to learn to start right
over."
Carder added that despite
Stanford's inexperience on
defense, the players are doing an
above-average job of learning on
the job, which many have been
forced to do. With an injury to
starting cornerback Eliel Swinton,
Stanford's defense saw its 16th
new starter and seventh new defen
sive back with cornerback Branyon
Davis. It was inexperience such as
this that perhaps brought about
many of the defensive mistakes.
"We have a number of first-year
men playing and they're very anx
ious," Walsh said. "They want to do
very, very well, but on occasion, maybe
on many occasions, they make gross
mistakes, catastrophic mistakes."
And according to senior defensive
end Tyrone Parker, those mistakes
are coming a bit too frequently.
"We're coached that if you make
a mistake, just don't make the mis
take a second time," said Parker.
"And we made mistakes too often,
we made the same mistakes a lot
and we have to improve on that. We
have to go out there and each
down, as a defense, get better, and

we didn't do that today."
In all, the defense gave up 475
yards, including 264 yards on the
ground and 211 through the air.
"We're just giving up huge
chunks of yardage up from out of
nowhere and playing very hard as
we do it," Walsh said. "So, all I can
say is that we just want to keep
working to improve. That's about
all a coach can do and all a squad
can do, keep working to improve."
One area where the Cardinal is
still improving is defending the
option. Notre Dame, the latest team
to find the play effective against the
Cardinal, used that play to rack up
79 yards and three touchdowns.
But teaching a young defense to
compete against probably the
toughest schedule in the nation is a
tricky and often frustrating process.
"All I can say is that we're work
ing to improve," Walsh repeated.
"The attitude of the team is excel
lent, and by and large we'll be get
ting better and better. There may
be a very bright future somewhere.
There'll be something out there for
us as we go through the year."

forced to do. With an injury to
starting cornerback Eliel Swinton,
Stanford's defense saw its 16th
new starter and seventh new defen
sive back with cornerback Branyon
Davis. It was inexperience such as
this that perhaps brought about
many of the defensive mistakes.
"We have a number of first-year
men playing and they're very anx
ious," Walsh said. "They want to do
very, very well, but on occasion, maybe
on many occasions, they make gross
mistakes, catastrophic mistakes."
And according to senior defensive
end Tyrone Parker, those mistakes
are coming a bit too frequently.
"We're coached that if you make
a mistake, just don't make the mis
take a second time," said Parker.
"And we made mistakes too often,
we made the same mistakes a lot
and we have to improve on that. We
have to go out there and each
down, as a defense, get better, and

we didn't do that today."
In all, the defense gave up 475
yards, including 264 yards on the
ground and 211 through the air.
"We're just giving up huge
chunks of yardage up from out of
nowhere and playing very hard as
we do it," Walsh said. "So, all I can
say is that we just want to keep
working to improve. That's about
all a coach can do and all a squad
can do, keep working to improve."
One area where the Cardinal is
still improving is defending the
option. Notre Dame, the latest team
to find the play effective against the
Cardinal, used that play to rack up
79 yards and three touchdowns.
But teaching a young defense to
compete against probably the
toughest schedule in the nation is a
tricky and often frustrating process.
"All I can say is that we're work
ing to improve," Walsh repeated.
"The attitude of the team is excel
lent, and by and large we'll be get
ting better and better. There may
be a very bright future somewhere.
There'll be something out there for
us as we go through the year."
Third and long. That may be
the easiest way to describe Satur
day's football game between
Stanford and Notre Dame. While
both teams often found them
selves in situations where they
needed big yardage for the first
down, Notre Dame more often
than not came up with the big
play to get it — and more.
"We played an outstanding
Notre Dame team, and they
played very, very well," said
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh.
"I think early on we held our
own, and then big plays
destroyed us — the kickoff
returns, the long passes. We were
positioned to play the ball and we
were just out-athleted. The man
who was a better athlete — the
bigger and faster man — he just
caught the ball and ran away
from us."
Notre Dame's Clint Johnson
ran away from everyone. He was
barely even touched on two kick
off returns, one for 79 yards, and
the other for 100 yards and a
touchdown. The latter return
came directly after an Eilery
Roberts touchdown run which
cut Notre Dame's lead to 14.
"Offensively, we were all
smiles in the huddle in the third
quarter," said Roberta. "At 13-
27, we were thinking if we can
hold them, it's our game. But
then came the kickofT return for
the touchdown ... and now we
were forced to make the big
plays."
Stanford often found itself
needing a lot of yardage to con
vert on third downs; the Cardinal
had to cover seven or more yards
nine times for the first down,
converting on three. Seven times
on third downs, Stanford needed
at least 12 yards — sometimes

more — for the first.
"We had so many third and
long situations where we had to
convert," said quarterback Steve
Stenstrom. "Third and 10, third
and 12, third and 20, even, and
that makes it tough to be suc
cessful in a game like this."
Notre Dame, which also found
itself having to get the big play on
several occasions, often came up
with a long pass or run. On the
day, the Fighting Irish were eight
of 12 on third-down conversions,
including nine of their first 10.
While the Stanford defense did
show occasional flashes of excel
lence for two downs, it often let
Notre Dame convert on the
third.
"We made as lot of big plays
today," said Notre Dame head
coach Lou Holtz. "I don't want to
be a big play offense, but today
we did. Our receivers had some
great catches, I can't say enough
about them."
Five times, the Cardinal
defense allowed the Irish to make
the first down on third and long
(distances greater than seven
yards). Notre Dame scored three
touchdowns on third downs. And
on a few key second and long sit
uations, Notre Dame was also
able to make the first down.
"I'd be lying if I didn't say it
doesn't demoralize you," said
defensive end David Carder.
"But you just gotta pick yourself
up and say, OK, let's get them
this time, three and out. And
we'd get them third and long and
they'd make a big play, and we
just have to learn to start right
over."
Carder added that despite
Stanford's inexperience on
defense, the players are doing an
above-average job of learning on
the job, which many have been
forced to do. With an injury to
starting cornerback Eliel Swinton,
Stanford's defense saw its 16th
