# Women's soccer upsets third-ranked Irish in home tourney
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Continuing its climb up the
women's soccer rankings, No. 9
Stanford defeated two quality

teams this weekend in the 1993
Bank of America/Cardinal Classic,
topping No. 3 Notre Dame Friday
afternoon 3-1 in overtime and
then putting away Texas Chris
tian University 4-0 on Sunday.

Despite controlling the ball
throughout the game, Stanford
had difficulty finishing its scoring
opportunities against the Fight
ing Irish. Falling behind Notre
Dame 1-0 after a defensive break
down halfway through the first
half, the Cardinal didn't get on
the board until 15 minutes into
the second half. At that point,
Sarah Rafanelli scored off a pass
from Emily Burt in front of the
Irish goal.
The game remained knotted at
one goal apiece through regula
tion play. The aggressive pace of
the game continued through the
first 15-minute overtime, with
Stanford breaking the tie on
Rafanelli's second goal of the
game. Erin Martin fired a shot off
the left goal post, and Rafanelli
was in position to put the
rebound past a diving Irish goal
keeper.
The Cardinal added their final
goal in the second half of over
time on a breakaway by Carmel
Murphy. Racing ahead of Notre
Dame's defenders, Murphy pulled
Notre Dame's keeper out of goal
and dumped the shot in for the
final 3-1 margin.
"After Notre Dame's goal, we
knew we were still in the game,"
said goalkeeper Leslie Garrard.
"We knew we were going to score
sometime, but we just had to
work harder to get that score."
Sarah Rafanelli lived up to her
reputation as one of the best
women's soccer players in the
country by controlling the offen
sive pace against both Notre
Dame and TCU. Named the tour

nament MVP, Rafanelli's three
goals over the weekend brought
her season total to eight, to go
along with eight assists.
"We're always looking for play
ers who are going to take respon
sibility and change the game for
us," said Stanford coach lan
Sawyers. "She definitely stepped
up and did that for us. She draws
a crowd wherever she is, and
she's really starting to dish the
ball off out of the double- and
triple-teams and create a lot of
scoring opportunities for other
players."
Stanford's defense was a major
key in defeating Notre Dame, as
it shut down top Irish scorers
Rosella Guerrero and Cindy
Daws. "Our defenders played
great. It would be a little unfair to
single one player out, but Jessica
Fischer played one of the best
games I've ever seen her play. She
was in the right position, step
ping in and taking charge when
she needed to and backing off and
covering well," said commented
Sawyers.
"Lan likes to refer to our full
backs as bruisers," Garrard said.
"Mel [Minstrellj is very intense,
Jess [Fischer! is our organizer
and playmaker and [Suziel Boots
has done a great job as a freshman
stepping in and contributing."
The first major challenge for
the Cardinal this year, Notre
Dame came in to the match with
an 8-0 record After beating up on
teams like Arkansas-Little Rock
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo the
past two weeks, Stanford finally
got a chance to show how good

they can be against a top team.
"We knew Notre Dame was a
good team, but we didn't let their
ranking intimidate us," Minstrell
said. "We were excited to play
against a good team, and I think
we controlled our energy from
that excitement well."
Avoiding a post-Notre Dame
letdown, the Cardinal again took
care of business Sunday by domi
nating TCU. Controlling the ball
in both halves, Stanford patiently
worked around the Horned
Frogs' goal before getting on the
scoreboard with a highlight-reel
goal by Rafanelli. Following a
Cardinal corner kick, Rafanelli
scored on an acrobatic header off
the goal post.
Stanford continued its scoring
barrage when Martin headed in a
goal off a beautiful cross-field
pass by fullback Melinda Min
strell. Fischer added her fifth goal
of the year when the TCU goal
keeper deflected a Stanford cor
ner kick, leaving an open net for
Fischer. Martin added another
goal with less than two minutes
to play in the game, giving her a
team-high ten scores for the year.
The Cardinal will again be
tested at next weekend's San
Diego State Invitational, but for
now the team will savor its recent
victories. "It feels great [to beat
Notre Dame]," said Sawyers.
"Not the result itself, but just the
fact that we were a goal down and
we came back. The kids showed
so much resolve just to get the
problems sorted out and get back
on track. It was a tremendous
effort by our players."

women's soccer players in the
country by controlling the offen
sive pace against both Notre
Dame and TCU. Named the tour

nament MVP, Rafanelli's three
goals over the weekend brought
her season total to eight, to go
along with eight assists.
"We're always looking for play
ers who are going to take respon
sibility and change the game for
us," said Stanford coach lan
Sawyers. "She definitely stepped
up and did that for us. She draws
a crowd wherever she is, and
she's really starting to dish the
ball off out of the double- and
triple-teams and create a lot of
scoring opportunities for other
players."
Stanford's defense was a major
key in defeating Notre Dame, as
it shut down top Irish scorers
Rosella Guerrero and Cindy
Daws. "Our defenders played
great. It would be a little unfair to
single one player out, but Jessica
Fischer played one of the best
games I've ever seen her play. She
was in the right position, step
ping in and taking charge when
she needed to and backing off and
covering well," said commented
Sawyers.
"Lan likes to refer to our full
backs as bruisers," Garrard said.
"Mel [Minstrellj is very intense,
Jess [Fischer! is our organizer
and playmaker and [Suziel Boots
has done a great job as a freshman
stepping in and contributing."
The first major challenge for
the Cardinal this year, Notre
Dame came in to the match with
an 8-0 record After beating up on
teams like Arkansas-Little Rock
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo the
past two weeks, Stanford finally
got a chance to show how good

they can be against a top team.
"We knew Notre Dame was a
good team, but we didn't let their
ranking intimidate us," Minstrell
said. "We were excited to play
against a good team, and I think
we controlled our energy from
that excitement well."
Avoiding a post-Notre Dame
letdown, the Cardinal again took
care of business Sunday by domi
nating TCU. Controlling the ball
in both halves, Stanford patiently
worked around the Horned
Frogs' goal before getting on the
scoreboard with a highlight-reel
goal by Rafanelli. Following a
Cardinal corner kick, Rafanelli
scored on an acrobatic header off
the goal post.
Stanford continued its scoring
barrage when Martin headed in a
goal off a beautiful cross-field
pass by fullback Melinda Min
strell. Fischer added her fifth goal
of the year when the TCU goal
keeper deflected a Stanford cor
ner kick, leaving an open net for
Fischer. Martin added another
goal with less than two minutes
to play in the game, giving her a
team-high ten scores for the year.
The Cardinal will again be
tested at next weekend's San
Diego State Invitational, but for
now the team will savor its recent
victories. "It feels great [to beat
Notre Dame]," said Sawyers.
"Not the result itself, but just the
fact that we were a goal down and
we came back. The kids showed
so much resolve just to get the
problems sorted out and get back
on track. It was a tremendous
effort by our players."

Stanford controls the ball while pouncing on No. 3 Notre Dame for a
3-1 upset.
Continuing its climb up the
women's soccer rankings, No. 9
Stanford defeated two quality

teams this weekend in the 1993
Bank of America/Cardinal Classic,
topping No. 3 Notre Dame Friday
afternoon 3-1 in overtime and
then putting away Texas Chris
tian University 4-0 on Sunday.

Despite controlling the ball
throughout the game, Stanford
had difficulty finishing its scoring
opportunities against the Fight
ing Irish. Falling behind Notre
Dame 1-0 after a defensive break
down halfway through the first
half, the Cardinal didn't get on
the board until 15 minutes into
the second half. At that point,
Sarah Rafanelli scored off a pass
from Emily Burt in front of the
Irish goal.
The game remained knotted at
one goal apiece through regula
tion play. The aggressive pace of
the game continued through the
first 15-minute overtime, with
Stanford breaking the tie on
Rafanelli's second goal of the
game. Erin Martin fired a shot off
the left goal post, and Rafanelli
was in position to put the
rebound past a diving Irish goal
keeper.
The Cardinal added their final
goal in the second half of over
time on a breakaway by Carmel
Murphy. Racing ahead of Notre
Dame's defenders, Murphy pulled
Notre Dame's keeper out of goal
and dumped the shot in for the
final 3-1 margin.
"After Notre Dame's goal, we
knew we were still in the game,"
said goalkeeper Leslie Garrard.
"We knew we were going to score
sometime, but we just had to
work harder to get that score."
