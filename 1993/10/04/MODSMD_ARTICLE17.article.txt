# How sweet it is: water polo finally beats Golden Bears at Cal
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Saturday witnessed a first for almost
everyone on the Stanford water polo team.
Before that day, only Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti, in his 16th year at Stan
ford, had been part of a Cardinal victory over
the California Golden Bears. For everyone
else, including fifth-year assistant coach Ben
Quittner, Saturday's win over Cal was a new
experience.
"It feels great. It's about time," said senior
Chris Wallin after the Cardinal downed the
Bears 6-4 at Berkeley's Speiker Pool.
The top-ranked Cardinal (8-1, 2-0 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) won a
defensive battle against No. 8 Cal (6-3,1-1 in
the MPSF). The low-scoring match featured
outstanding goalie play from Stanford senior
Larry Bercutt and California's Sean Nolan.
One key to Stanford's victory was the
defensive pressure put on Cal's All-American
holeman Troy Barnhart.

"Jeremy (Laster) did a good job on Barn
hart," said Dettamanti. "We always had one
man in position to help back when he got the
ball. We stole the ball from him a few times
and forced him into taking some bad shots."
In addition, the Cardinal managed to draw
two 20-second ejection fouls against the Gold
en Bear standout. One more foul would have
forced Barnhart from the game.
The match came down to how well each
team fared defensively while playing a man
short, due to 20-second ejection fouls. Both
squads found themselves at a man-disadvan
tage eight times, with Cal converting only
twice. Stanford capitalized four times in man
advantage situations. Three of those scores
came in the second quarter when the Cardi
nal built a 5-2 lead before halftime.
After a Cal goal by Matt Maclear trimmed
the Stanford lead to 5-3 with five minutes to
play in the third quarter, it was all Cardinal
the rest of the way.
Stanford goaltender Bercutt shut down
the Bears and capped the third quarter with

a save on a wide-open, close-range shot from
Barnhart.
In the fourth quarter, Bercutt put an
exclamation point on his performance by
stuffing Barnhart on a penalty shot that
would have brought the Bears to within one
goal with five minutes left to play.
"I was pretty sure of where he was going
to shoot it," Bercutt said. "He shot the first
one (a penalty shot in the first quarter) in the
upper right. I guessed lower left and got two
hands on it."
Instead of closing to 5-4, the Bears found
themselves down 6-3, as the Cardinal scored
one minute later.
With time running out on the 35-second
shot-clock, freshman Brian Wallin put a pass
right on the hand of brother Chris, who
turned and fired the ball past Nolan and into
the net.
"I saw the goalie start to cheat out of the
goal," the younger Wallin said. "I looked at
Chris and he gave me a look."
The goal broke the back of the three-time

defending national champions. California
was unable to score in the fourth quarter
until Gavin Arroyo tallied the final goal with
just four seconds remaining in the contest.
"In the last seconds of the game, our con
cern is to not give up a two-pointer (awarded
for a shot outside of seven meters from the
goal)," Bercutt said. "We are willing to give
up a one-point goal at that point."
Bercutt also praised his teammates for
their defensive efforts throughout the match.
"As a goalie, you can't ask for more,"
Bercutt said. "We played a lot of the time
down a man, and once even six-on-four (when
two Cardinal players were ejected at the same
time)."
Senior Antonio Busquets, Laster and Wolf
Wigo all made key steals to end California's
final rally.
"We did what we had to do," Laster added.
"We were able to hold Bam hart and Arroyo.
We expected them to shoot some two-pointers,
