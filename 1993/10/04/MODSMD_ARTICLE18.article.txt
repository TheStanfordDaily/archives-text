# Notre Dame routs Cardinal, 48-20

Football players come to Stan
ford to get an education.
They got one Saturday.
No. 4 Notre Dame pursued a les
son plan consisting of big plays,
speed, and continual third-down
conversions, scolding the Cardinal
48-20 before a near-sellout crowd at
Stanford Stadium.
"We're in the throes of trying to
develop a young team and we ran
into a great team today that took us
apart," said Stanford head coach
Bill Walsh. "We're trying to learn
as we go along."
Coach Lou Holtz and his Notre
Dame staff certainly knew Stan
ford's weaknesses — and exploited
them. Although the Fighting Irish
only ran the option play four times,
three of those calls resulted in
touchdowns. Quarterback Kevin
McDougal scored twice on runs of
his own, and another option pitch
led to a nine-yard end-zone journey
for tailback Willie Clark.
Even after the game, the Stan
ford defense remained befuddled by
the option. "I still don't think we
can stop it," said inside linebacker
Coy Gibbs.
Notre Dame (5-0) effectively
controlled the football on its offen
sive series. Of the six Irish scoring
drives, two were 92 yards in length
and two others were 80 yards.
And then there were the big
plays. Just when it appeared that
the Cardinal defense would stall
Notre Dame, the Irish found a way
to keep their drives going. Notre
Dame converted eight of twelve
third-down chances, including
passes of 24 and 32 yards to split
end Lake Dawson on successive
drives, both in third-and-long situa
tions. The Irish only punted three
times the entire afternoon.
"We made a lot of big plays when
we had to," Holtz said. "We wanted
to play an error-free football game.
We almost did."
Stanford (2-3) contributed to
that success. The Cardinal defense,
rated last in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, gave up 475 net yards on the

day, and for the fifth time in as
many games, yielded over 100
yards to an opposing running back.
This time, that back was Irish
freshman Randy Kinder, who ran
for a game-high 104 yards on 16
carries.
Additionally, Cardinal pass cov
erage made a sparsely used Notre
Dame aerial attack very effective.
Irish quarterbacks McDougal and

Paul Failla threw just 10 passes,
but completed eight of those for 211
yards and two touchdowns.
"We were giving up huge chunks
of yardage out of nowhere," Walsh
said.
The Stanford offense tried to
keep pace with Notre Dame's scor
ing barrage, as quarterback Steve
Stenstrom completed 34 of 46
attempts — both career highs —

and passed for over 300 yards for
the fourth straight game. The Car
dinal showed progress in its run
ning game for the first time, as
freshman Mike Mitchell gained 31
yards on six carries to go along with
Ellery Roberts' 58 yards on 14 car
ries.
