# Pen-pal program pairs students with internees
## 
### Allison Short 
For most students, the Japanese internment
camps of World War II are simply another chapter in
their school textbooks â€” a tragic yet distant histori
cal event. But for junior Eiko Itoh, this part of her
heritage crystallized this summer in a written corre
spondence with one of the internees.
"You don't learn about these things in classes,"
Itoh said. "A firsthand experience is what makes it
real."
Itoh was one of several students who participated
in a "buddy" program with nine
Japanese-American alumni who
were removed from Stanford dur
ing the 1941-42 academic year
and placed in internment camps.
Planned by the Stanford Univer
sity Nikkei organization, a
Japanese-American club, the pro
gram was intended to give stu
dents and alumni a chance to get
to know each other before this
weekend's reunion festivities.
Itoh was paired with alumni
Eric Andow in May, and the two
exchanged several letters over the
summer. In her first letter, Itoh
introduced herself and invited
Andow to the alumni reunion on
Oct. 1.
"It was awkward at first
because I didn't know anything
about his personality and what he
felt about the war," Itoh said. "For
a lot of people [the memory of
internment] is not a positive event.
I wanted to keep everything
upbeat."
The friendship the two "bud
dies" had developed through their
letters was cemented when Andow
sent Itoh a copy of the book "Yam
ato Colony" so that Itoh could
learn more about the lifestyle of
Japanese-American farmers.
Andow had served as a historical
consultant on the book.
Shortly after, Andow invited
Itoh, her brother and two other
Nikkei members to his farm in
Wynton, Calif. At Andow's farm,
Itoh toured his almond and grape
fields, ate meals prepared by his

wife and spent time talking to him
about his wartime experiences and
years at Stanford.
"They were just like our grand
parents," Itoh said. "They took us
in like they had known us a long
time."
Andow, who spent two quarters
at Stanford before he was evacuat
ed to Japan, remembers being
"miserable not knowing what was
going to happen next. I was getting
ready for finals during Pearl Har
bor," Andow said.
Going to Japan gave Andow a
new perspective on his back
ground, which he shared with Itoh
through the program.
"We were raised with the con
cept that we had to be American,"
Andow said. "For me, having visit
ed Japan, it changed my whole
outlook on Japanese heritage.
Now, I feel proud to say I'm
Japanese-American."
After hearing Andow's sur
vival stories, Itoh said she has
acquired a new appreciation for
her current lifestyle. "We think
we have a lot of problems as stu
dents, but imagine having to
think about your family, studying
and everything he (Andow) went
through," Itoh said. "His stories
make me not want to give up on
anything. Nothing seems as hard
anymore."
Itoh has "adopted" Andow and
his wife as her "American grand
parents," and she has already been
invited to spend another weekend
at their farm.
Sophomore David Tanaka, pro
ject coordinator and co-president
of Nikkei, has worked since March
to organize this buddy project,
which has sparked several friend

ships between Japanese-American
students and alumni. He thought
the idea of helping them build a
correspondence during the sum
mer would personalize the fall
alumni visit.
Organizers hoped the program
would increase students' knowl
edge about the internment camps,
Tanaka said. "We wanted to show
our respect, educate people and
show the alumni their campus,"
he added.
Junior Julie Kikuchi and her
alumni buddy Wataru Takeshita
wrote and joked about everyday
life at Stanford. Takeshita, whose
son is a freshman at Stanford,
asked Kikuchi in his letters about
what size bedsheets his son should
bring and which dorms were co-ed.
Kikuchi and Takeshita finally
met at the reunion. "It felt like I
already knew him," Kikuchi said.
"It was really neat to see him
interact with all his friends and his
old roommate."

Sophomore Liane Nomura,
used the buddy program to learn
about the experiences of her
grandfather, who was also placed
in an internment camp during the
war. She never talked to him about
this part of his life prior to his
death two years ago.
Being paired up with an
internee gave her an opportunity
to learn more about her grandfa
ther. "I'm glad I got to talk to him
(Yamakawa) about it," Nomura
said. "Otherwise I never would
have had a chance to know what
happened."
Although the "buddy" program
officially ended this weekend with
the Japanese-American Alumni
Reunion, participants hope others
will have the chance to learn first
hand about an often neglected part
of their cultural history.
"It feels great to have it finally
happen," Itoh said. "Everyone
should have a chance to meet
someone like this."
