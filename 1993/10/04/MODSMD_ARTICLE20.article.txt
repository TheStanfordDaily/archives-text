# Breaking out of a slump
## Booters encouraged with play at Cardinal Classic 
### Reagan Demas 
The Stanford men's soccer team played in
this weekend's Cardinal Classic with an
improved flair — snarling, growling and real
ly showing its teeth.
Unfortunately, there's still some much
needed dental work for the team to get where
it wants to be.
"I saw some positive things this weekend
that I hadn't seen before," said Stanford coach
Colin Lindores following his team's 4-1 victory
over UC-Irvine and 3-0 loss at the hands of St.
Louis. "But we didn't all of a sudden break out
and say, We aren't going to go back to the way
we were.' It's a laborious process."
Not to say that getting a win for the 2-6-1
Cardinal is like pulling teeth — they beat a
very physical UC-Irvine squad by finishing
their opportunities and kept the seventh
ranked St. Louis Billikens in check for the
first half. But in the end, the Cardinal suc
cumbed to the speed and one-on-one offensive
style of St. Louis.
"We spent most of the game chasing them,"
said Stanford forward Rick Goad, who scored
twice in the win over Irvine on Friday. "They
(St. Louis) played much faster than we did."
The Cardinal offense in the first half of the

St. Louis match bore a resemblance to the
mythical tale of Tantalus — rewards were so
close and yet so far away. Numerous unfin
ished opportunities at the Billiken goal and
many great crosses in the middle of the box all
fizzled, and Stanford was left scoreless, lifeless
and breathless.
"We were playing a good team today," said
Cardinal captain Jeff Russell. "They finished
their chances and we just missed ours."
The Billiken's first chance came 27 min
utes into the game. After Stanford had kept
the pressure on the St. Louis goal by keeping
the ball on the Billiken's side of the midfield
stripe, a single drive into Cardinal territory
and a chip shot from the right side by Billiken
sensation Brian Mcßride gave St. Louis a 1-0
lead.
However, the Cardinal played tough
defense throughout the first half. Stanford
goalie Jim Masetti collected seven saves in the
first 45 minutes as his team held the offen
sive-minded Billikens to only one goal before
the half. St. Louis couldn't convert on five cor
ner kicks, and the halftime break saw the Car
dinal still alive.
But the Billikens, who were rebounding
from a 3-2 overtime loss to the University of
San Francisco on Friday, came out with light

ning speed in the second half. It took only
eight minutes for St. Louis midfielder Chris
Santel to make it 2-0, after he emerged from a
mob of mixed jerseys that were juggling for
the ball and tapped it in the goal.
"We lost to a much more composed team,"
Lindores said. "No one wants to lose, but
you'd like to think the younger players will
learn something. Otherwise, you just got wal
loped."
St. Louis lives and dies with Mcßride, who
has 13 goals this season. The Billikens have
won every game in which Mcßride has scored
and have lost the two games in which he
hasn't. On this day they thrived, as he scored
for the second time on a spectacular cross-goal
shot 13 minutes into the half for the game's
final score.
"They had two very good players up front,"
Russell said of St. Louis' quickness in
Mcßride and Mike Byrne. "We just couldn't
stop them."
Stanford's loss Sunday was preceded by
the victory over Irvine in the tourney. In a
physical matchup that sometimes led to heat
ed and controversial calls, the Cardinal didn't
get going until the end of the first half. Irvine
scored 13 minutes into the game, only seconds
after two consecutive corner kicks failed for

the Anteaters.
But by the end of the half, the Cardinal
roared back into the game. Irvine's lack of
depth and Lindores' decision to shake up
Stanford's lineup with substitutions may
have contributed to the comeback, which saw
Goad score twice in the last 15 minutes of the
first half.
"We established firm control of the game at
the end of the first half," Goad said. "They
knew they weren't going to get back into it."
And, sure enough, the Anteaters didn't.
The ball crossed into Cardinal territory only
once in the first 12 minutes of the second half,
and two more goals by Ryan Collins and Car
men D'Onofrio gave Stanford the 4-1 victory.
The Cardinal begins league play this Fri
day at home against Air Force, where they
hope to sharpen their game and continue
their uphill climb for a slot in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
Yet despite the mixed results for the Cardi
nal over the weekend, Stanford's opponents
acknowledged the team's potential. "Our
team played hard and we moved the ball very
well," said St. Louis coach Joe Clarke. "Stan
ford's record may not be the greatest, but
they're the best team in the country right now
with six losses."

The Cardinal offense in the first half of the

St. Louis match bore a resemblance to the
mythical tale of Tantalus — rewards were so
close and yet so far away. Numerous unfin
ished opportunities at the Billiken goal and
many great crosses in the middle of the box all
fizzled, and Stanford was left scoreless, lifeless
and breathless.
"We were playing a good team today," said
Cardinal captain Jeff Russell. "They finished
their chances and we just missed ours."
The Billiken's first chance came 27 min
utes into the game. After Stanford had kept
the pressure on the St. Louis goal by keeping
the ball on the Billiken's side of the midfield
stripe, a single drive into Cardinal territory
and a chip shot from the right side by Billiken
sensation Brian Mcßride gave St. Louis a 1-0
lead.
However, the Cardinal played tough
defense throughout the first half. Stanford
goalie Jim Masetti collected seven saves in the
first 45 minutes as his team held the offen
sive-minded Billikens to only one goal before
the half. St. Louis couldn't convert on five cor
ner kicks, and the halftime break saw the Car
dinal still alive.
But the Billikens, who were rebounding
from a 3-2 overtime loss to the University of
San Francisco on Friday, came out with light

ning speed in the second half. It took only
eight minutes for St. Louis midfielder Chris
Santel to make it 2-0, after he emerged from a
mob of mixed jerseys that were juggling for
the ball and tapped it in the goal.
"We lost to a much more composed team,"
Lindores said. "No one wants to lose, but
you'd like to think the younger players will
learn something. Otherwise, you just got wal
loped."
St. Louis lives and dies with Mcßride, who
has 13 goals this season. The Billikens have
won every game in which Mcßride has scored
and have lost the two games in which he
hasn't. On this day they thrived, as he scored
for the second time on a spectacular cross-goal
shot 13 minutes into the half for the game's
final score.
"They had two very good players up front,"
Russell said of St. Louis' quickness in
Mcßride and Mike Byrne. "We just couldn't
stop them."
Stanford's loss Sunday was preceded by
the victory over Irvine in the tourney. In a
physical matchup that sometimes led to heat
ed and controversial calls, the Cardinal didn't
get going until the end of the first half. Irvine
scored 13 minutes into the game, only seconds
after two consecutive corner kicks failed for

the Anteaters.
But by the end of the half, the Cardinal
roared back into the game. Irvine's lack of
depth and Lindores' decision to shake up
Stanford's lineup with substitutions may
have contributed to the comeback, which saw
Goad score twice in the last 15 minutes of the
first half.
"We established firm control of the game at
the end of the first half," Goad said. "They
knew they weren't going to get back into it."
And, sure enough, the Anteaters didn't.
The ball crossed into Cardinal territory only
once in the first 12 minutes of the second half,
and two more goals by Ryan Collins and Car
men D'Onofrio gave Stanford the 4-1 victory.
The Cardinal begins league play this Fri
day at home against Air Force, where they
hope to sharpen their game and continue
their uphill climb for a slot in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
Yet despite the mixed results for the Cardi
nal over the weekend, Stanford's opponents
acknowledged the team's potential. "Our
team played hard and we moved the ball very
well," said St. Louis coach Joe Clarke. "Stan
ford's record may not be the greatest, but
they're the best team in the country right now
with six losses."
The Stanford men's soccer team played in
this weekend's Cardinal Classic with an
improved flair — snarling, growling and real
ly showing its teeth.
Unfortunately, there's still some much
needed dental work for the team to get where
it wants to be.
"I saw some positive things this weekend
that I hadn't seen before," said Stanford coach
Colin Lindores following his team's 4-1 victory
over UC-Irvine and 3-0 loss at the hands of St.
Louis. "But we didn't all of a sudden break out
and say, We aren't going to go back to the way
we were.' It's a laborious process."
Not to say that getting a win for the 2-6-1
Cardinal is like pulling teeth — they beat a
very physical UC-Irvine squad by finishing
their opportunities and kept the seventh
ranked St. Louis Billikens in check for the
first half. But in the end, the Cardinal suc
cumbed to the speed and one-on-one offensive
style of St. Louis.
"We spent most of the game chasing them,"
said Stanford forward Rick Goad, who scored
twice in the win over Irvine on Friday. "They
(St. Louis) played much faster than we did."
