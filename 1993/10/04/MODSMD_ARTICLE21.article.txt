# Spikers get back on winning track with victories in Washington
## Despite slow starts, Stanford rallies to beat Pac-10 rivals 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Pull it off at the last possible second.
That has become the motto of the Stan
ford women's volleyball team, as the
No. 4 Cardinal escaped Washington
with two more come-from-behind victo
ries this weekend.
Stanford (9-2, 4-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference) pulled out a four-game vic
tory Friday night against No. 19 Wash
ington State (9-2, 2-2 in the Pac-10) and
then went on to another narrow tri
umph, outscoring Washington (4-9, 1-4
in the Pac-10) in five games.
"We struggled in the beginning of
both matches," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We got ourselves in a real hole,
especially against Washington, but we
fought back and managed to come
through."

Washington State was the first vic
tim of the Cardinal's persistence, falling
15-8, 13-15, 15-13, 15-6. But Stanford
had to struggle through the first half of
the match before coming alive during
the second portion of the contest.
"We got off to a really slow start,"
said sophomore Cary Wendell. "We
didn't have the right mental attitude
and really lacked aggression."
Washington State kept close pace
with the Cardinal in both early games.
After hitting .205 in game one, the
Cougars took advantage of Stanford's
mistakes in the second game, coming
out on top with 14 kills in 36 total
attacks for a .222 hitting percentage.
Both teams tallied 24 kills in the
closely contested third game. Stanford
managed to come up with the win
despite another ten attack errors. The
Cougars actually topped the Cardinal

offensively, hitting .239 to Stanford's
.192 in game three.
Picking up steam in the fourth game,
the Cardinal reduced its hitting errors
to four, prevailing with 15 kills and a
.282 hitting percentage.
"It was pretty much the same pat
tern," Shaw said. "We get behind in the
beginning, then battle back to retake
the lead, but by then the match is so
close that we're left with a very small
margin of error."
While the Cardinal offense displayed
a shaky performance at times during
the evening, a stepped-up defensive
effort gave Stanford the advantage. The
team ended the match with five solo
blocks and eight block assists.
"I thought we sided-out very well
against Washington State," Shaw said.
"We did a good job of slowing them
down."

While Stanford expected its bout
against Washington to be the easier of
the two meetings, the Cardinal fell
behind early in the night and spent
most of the match recovering from the
deficit. Stanford hit .150 to the Huskies'
.265 in game one followed by .182 to
.228 in the second game.
"It was amazing," Wendell said.
"Nothing seemed to work, we pretty
much let them take control of the
match."
Stanford turned the tide in the third
game, then fought to capture the
remaining two games with 23 kills in
the last two games to Washington's 12.
"We fought to turn it around really
well," Wendell said. "We really had
heart in the end."
Sophomores Cary Wendell, Marnie
Triefenbach and Wendy Hromadka led
the Stanford efforts in both matches.

Wendell hit .297 against the Cougars
with 15 kills and 11 digs. She added 12
kills against the Huskies.
Triefenbach swung for 14 kills,
adding 12 digs against Washington and
16 kills the next night. Hromadka con
tributed 11 kills for a .250 hitting per
centage on Friday, followed by 10 kills
against the Huskies. Senior Piper Hahn
ended with 42 sets against the Cougars
followed by 43 sets against Washington.
The Cardinal will continue experi
menting with its lineup in hopes of elim
inating its offensive errors in Tuesday
night's Big Match at Berkeley and then
in the Stanford/Bank of America Invita
tional next weekend.
"We still haven't found the right
combination," Shaw said. "We still
haven't put six on the court that have
given us a full match but it's early —
that's going to happen."

"We got off to a really slow start,"
said sophomore Cary Wendell. "We
didn't have the right mental attitude
and really lacked aggression."
Washington State kept close pace
with the Cardinal in both early games.
After hitting .205 in game one, the
Cougars took advantage of Stanford's
mistakes in the second game, coming
out on top with 14 kills in 36 total
attacks for a .222 hitting percentage.
Both teams tallied 24 kills in the
closely contested third game. Stanford
managed to come up with the win
despite another ten attack errors. The
Cougars actually topped the Cardinal

offensively, hitting .239 to Stanford's
.192 in game three.
Picking up steam in the fourth game,
the Cardinal reduced its hitting errors
to four, prevailing with 15 kills and a
.282 hitting percentage.
"It was pretty much the same pat
tern," Shaw said. "We get behind in the
beginning, then battle back to retake
the lead, but by then the match is so
close that we're left with a very small
margin of error."
While the Cardinal offense displayed
a shaky performance at times during
the evening, a stepped-up defensive
effort gave Stanford the advantage. The
team ended the match with five solo
blocks and eight block assists.
"I thought we sided-out very well
against Washington State," Shaw said.
"We did a good job of slowing them
down."

While Stanford expected its bout
against Washington to be the easier of
the two meetings, the Cardinal fell
behind early in the night and spent
most of the match recovering from the
deficit. Stanford hit .150 to the Huskies'
.265 in game one followed by .182 to
.228 in the second game.
"It was amazing," Wendell said.
"Nothing seemed to work, we pretty
much let them take control of the
match."
Stanford turned the tide in the third
game, then fought to capture the
remaining two games with 23 kills in
the last two games to Washington's 12.
"We fought to turn it around really
well," Wendell said. "We really had
heart in the end."
Sophomores Cary Wendell, Marnie
Triefenbach and Wendy Hromadka led
the Stanford efforts in both matches.

Wendell hit .297 against the Cougars
with 15 kills and 11 digs. She added 12
kills against the Huskies.
Triefenbach swung for 14 kills,
adding 12 digs against Washington and
16 kills the next night. Hromadka con
tributed 11 kills for a .250 hitting per
centage on Friday, followed by 10 kills
against the Huskies. Senior Piper Hahn
ended with 42 sets against the Cougars
followed by 43 sets against Washington.
The Cardinal will continue experi
menting with its lineup in hopes of elim
inating its offensive errors in Tuesday
night's Big Match at Berkeley and then
in the Stanford/Bank of America Invita
tional next weekend.
"We still haven't found the right
combination," Shaw said. "We still
haven't put six on the court that have
given us a full match but it's early —
that's going to happen."
