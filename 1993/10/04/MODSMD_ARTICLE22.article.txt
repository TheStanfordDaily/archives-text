# Runners motor to a second-place finish
## Stanford Invitational a success as Cardinal cross-country team blossoms 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
As the Cardinal men's and women's
cross-country teams ran their home
opener on the Stanford Golf Course this
weekend, they raced under the warmth of
the setting sun.
But the Stanford teams generated
some heat of their own over the weekend.
Of four squads that competed in Satur
day's Stanford Invitational, all finished
either first or second. Both the No. 12
women and No. 21 men placed second in
the Invitational race and first in the Open
race.
In the featured Invite, it took Brigham
Young, which boasts the sixth-ranked
men's and women's teams in the nation,
to prevent Stanford from earning a
quadruple crown. The Cardinal men lost
to the Cougars 35-101, while the women
pushed BYU before falling short by a
close margin of 72-84. All other
formidable competitors such as UCLA,
Michigan State and Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo fell to Stanford.
"To make a sweeping comment, for all
four races, there was a commanding pres
ence for Stanford University this Satur
day," said head coach Vin Lananna.
The Cardinal women put on a particu
larly impressive performance.
In the Invitational, freshman Leila
Burr, junior Stephanie Jensen, senior
captain Sarah Truitt, freshman Monal
Chokshi and senior Louise Watson fin
ished 13th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 21st
respectively.
"We're training to run in a tight pack,"
Lananna said. "The time between our top
six runners was 17:45 and 18:11, only a
26-second gap. Anybody who coaches
cross country will tell you . . . that's fan
tastic."
The women accomplished such a feat
despite missing sophomore Laura Hay
ward, a consistently excellent runner for
Stanford who did not run because of a
cold.
"The gap hasn't been like that since
I've been here," said Truitt. "I'm really
proud of the team. We're improving every
week, especially the ones who got off to
rocky starts."
"Me aside, the race was very encourag
ing," said defending District-8 champion
Watson. "I've been training hard, I felt
tense, and I never really got into the
rhythm. I'm going to train in a more
relaxed manner and hopefully I'll laugh
the race off. It's better to get these days
out of the way rather than at the champi
onship meets. We can make up 30 points

just like that."
Meanwhile, still-developing Cardinal
runners dominated the women's Open.
Freshman Amanda White, sophomores
Ann Sheehy and Beanie Dehlendorf,
senior Debby Wells and freshman Amy
Mac Arthur placed second, fourth, fifth,
seventh and 15th respectively.
"We have one of the deepest teams in
the country," Lananna said. "I was really
excited to see White improve. Imagine

To make a sweeping com
ment, for all four races,
there was a commanding
presence for Stanford.'

when we get her into the [top] line-up."
The Cardinal men also gave Lananna
encouragement. Ail-American senior cap
tain Gary Stolz led the Invitational team
with a second-place performance. Fresh
men J.J. White and Andrew Cowgill,
sophomore Eric Spayde and senior Todd
Lewis followed with 15th, 25th, 28th and
3lBt-place finishes respectively.
"BYU is a very strong and experienced
team," Lananna said. "On the right day,
they could win the NCAAs. I think we
could have run better, but we ran in a
good pack and ran well. The Invitational
was the first real measure for where we
are, and as far as that goes, the guys had
passing grades for their midterm, so to
speak."
Stolz was also optimistic about the
team.
"I thought the race went well," Stolz
said. "Our main goal was to have our top
seven runners run in a pack. For most of
the race, our second through seventh
runners did that. The race started out
fast, we were supposed to stay back a lit
tle then move up, but we stayed back a lit
tle too long. Now we just need to work on
running higher up in the pack."
The men's Open squad did just what
Stolz wanted. Freshmen Gil Serrano,
Bryan Zmijewski, Michael Prindiville and
Jason Perscheid and junior Brian McCaf
fery placed fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth
and 12th respectively.
"We're much better than we were last
year," Lananna said in regard to the Car
dinal teams. "We made good strides
toward gearing up for the [Pacific 10]
Championships."

"Me aside, the race was very encourag
ing," said defending District-8 champion
Watson. "I've been training hard, I felt
tense, and I never really got into the
rhythm. I'm going to train in a more
relaxed manner and hopefully I'll laugh
the race off. It's better to get these days
out of the way rather than at the champi
onship meets. We can make up 30 points

just like that."
Meanwhile, still-developing Cardinal
runners dominated the women's Open.
Freshman Amanda White, sophomores
Ann Sheehy and Beanie Dehlendorf,
senior Debby Wells and freshman Amy
Mac Arthur placed second, fourth, fifth,
seventh and 15th respectively.
"We have one of the deepest teams in
the country," Lananna said. "I was really
excited to see White improve. Imagine

To make a sweeping com
ment, for all four races,
there was a commanding
presence for Stanford.'

when we get her into the [top] line-up."
The Cardinal men also gave Lananna
encouragement. Ail-American senior cap
tain Gary Stolz led the Invitational team
with a second-place performance. Fresh
men J.J. White and Andrew Cowgill,
sophomore Eric Spayde and senior Todd
Lewis followed with 15th, 25th, 28th and
3lBt-place finishes respectively.
"BYU is a very strong and experienced
team," Lananna said. "On the right day,
they could win the NCAAs. I think we
could have run better, but we ran in a
good pack and ran well. The Invitational
was the first real measure for where we
are, and as far as that goes, the guys had
passing grades for their midterm, so to
speak."
Stolz was also optimistic about the
team.
"I thought the race went well," Stolz
said. "Our main goal was to have our top
seven runners run in a pack. For most of
the race, our second through seventh
runners did that. The race started out
fast, we were supposed to stay back a lit
tle then move up, but we stayed back a lit
tle too long. Now we just need to work on
running higher up in the pack."
The men's Open squad did just what
Stolz wanted. Freshmen Gil Serrano,
Bryan Zmijewski, Michael Prindiville and
Jason Perscheid and junior Brian McCaf
fery placed fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth
and 12th respectively.
"We're much better than we were last
year," Lananna said in regard to the Car
dinal teams. "We made good strides
toward gearing up for the [Pacific 10]
Championships."

Senior captain Gary Stolz blazes to a close sec
ond-place finish in the Stanford Invitational, as his
team takes second overall as well.
As the Cardinal men's and women's
cross-country teams ran their home
opener on the Stanford Golf Course this
weekend, they raced under the warmth of
the setting sun.
But the Stanford teams generated
some heat of their own over the weekend.
Of four squads that competed in Satur
day's Stanford Invitational, all finished
either first or second. Both the No. 12
women and No. 21 men placed second in
the Invitational race and first in the Open
race.
In the featured Invite, it took Brigham
Young, which boasts the sixth-ranked
men's and women's teams in the nation,
to prevent Stanford from earning a
quadruple crown. The Cardinal men lost
to the Cougars 35-101, while the women
pushed BYU before falling short by a
close margin of 72-84. All other
formidable competitors such as UCLA,
Michigan State and Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo fell to Stanford.
"To make a sweeping comment, for all
four races, there was a commanding pres
ence for Stanford University this Satur
day," said head coach Vin Lananna.
The Cardinal women put on a particu
larly impressive performance.
In the Invitational, freshman Leila
Burr, junior Stephanie Jensen, senior
captain Sarah Truitt, freshman Monal
Chokshi and senior Louise Watson fin
ished 13th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 21st
respectively.
"We're training to run in a tight pack,"
Lananna said. "The time between our top
six runners was 17:45 and 18:11, only a
26-second gap. Anybody who coaches
cross country will tell you . . . that's fan
tastic."
The women accomplished such a feat
despite missing sophomore Laura Hay
ward, a consistently excellent runner for
Stanford who did not run because of a
cold.
"The gap hasn't been like that since
I've been here," said Truitt. "I'm really
proud of the team. We're improving every
week, especially the ones who got off to
rocky starts."
"Me aside, the race was very encourag
ing," said defending District-8 champion
Watson. "I've been training hard, I felt
tense, and I never really got into the
rhythm. I'm going to train in a more
relaxed manner and hopefully I'll laugh
