# Bosnian exiles tell of war's atrocities
## 
### Jeff Israely 
Two Bosnian women, exiled
from their embattled home
land, made an impassioned
plea for international action to
halt the systematic rape of
thousands of Bosnian women
at a speech Friday.
Aida Daidzic and Diana
Kapidzic argued that the rapes
committed by Serbian soldiers
are a specifically designed tool
in a Serbian campaign of geno
cide against Bosnia's mostly
Muslim population.

'It is the responsi
bility of every sin
gle person of the
"Holocaust — never
again!" generation
to let their words
be followed by
actions.'
— Diana Kapidzic

The two speakers urged the
more than 60 students and
alumni who attended the talk
at the Medical School to find
out "the real truth" about the
atrocities being committed in
Bosnia.
"It is the responsibility of
every single person of the
'Holocaust — never again!'
generation to let their words be
followed by all the actions that
are necessary to free the cap
tives from concentration camps
and besieged cities," Kapidzic
said.
Though both women were
living in Germany when the
fighting in the former
Yugoslavia began — and have
been unable to return to Bosnia
— they have spent the last two
years gathering evidence of
Serbian atrocities committed
against women. The women
have gathered most of their evi
dence from conversations with
Bosnian refugees.
Daidzic and Kapidzic are
members of an international
women's rights organization

that is involved in a lawsuit
charging the Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic with
genocide. They have been
speaking out around the Unit
ed States trying to call atten
tion to the human rights condi
tions in their homeland.
Daidzic recounted how she
first learned of "rape-death
camps" in which Bosnian
women were subject to repeat
ed sexual attacks. "Gang rapes,
forced impregnation and public
humiliation are part of a strat
egy to destroy an entire peo
ple," she said.
Tying individual accounts of
atrocities to larger issues of
politics and international
responsibility, the two women
urged members of the audience
to get involved and informed
about the human rights condi
tions in Bosnia.
"Everyone who knows about
the atrocities is responsible for
when they stop," Daidzic said.
"What is killed in Bosnia is not
only thousands of people but
the idea of democracy and
multi-ethnicity."
The presentation also
included photographs of Bosni
an women who had been raped,
as well as a 45-minute video
about the atrocities in Bosnia.
Senior Walter Lin attended
the presentation because he
said he wanted to learn more
about the situation in Bosnia.
"I didn't realize the extent of
the atrocities going on there,"
he said. "I knew there were
rapes, but I didn't know they
were committed systematical
ly"
"It strikes many compar
isons to the Holocaust," said
Medical School student Sheri
Fink, a member of the Stanford
chapter of the California Coali
tion Against Ethnic Cleansing,
which sponsored the talk. "I
feel that if enough people had
mobilized then, something
could have been done to pre
vent it."
Along with graduate stu
dent Brad Blitz, who heads the
Stanford chapter of the coali
tion, Fink has been urging stu
dents to get involved with this
issue.
"We must make it clear that
things can be done," Blitz said.
"Protest is essential."
