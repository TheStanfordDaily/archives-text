# Town meeting brings Eshoo to campus
## 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Rep. Anna Eshoo wasn't afraid of hashing
out the issues when she exchanged pleas
antries with a handful of demonstrators out
side a town meeting held at the Graduate
School of Business yesterday.
A newly elected congresswoman represent
ing the district that includes Stanford, Eshoo
spoke on a variety of local and national issues
for nearly an hour to more than 100 students
and local residents.
Five demonstrators from the Mid-Peninsu
la Chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union held placards showing their support for
changes in a civil-asset forfeiture law, manda
tory minimum sentences for non-violent
crimes, and racially slanted sentences for
crack and cocaine use.
"We don't have any particular beef with
Anna," said Stanford graduate Mark Carter, a
Palo Alto resident who organized the protest.
"We just want to make her aware of some of
these issues."
After briefly chatting with the demonstra
tors, Eshoo stepped up to the podium and
voiced her support for reforms in civil-asset
forfeiture and invasions of privacy that go
unrestricted in the war on drugs.
Eshoo, a Democrat, also voiced her support
for Clinton's deficit-reduction plan, despite its
admitted imperfections.
"I don't believe that it's the 'Bill from Hell'
the Republicans have described, nor the Nir
vana the Democrats have described," Eshoo
said. "It was the toughest vote I'll ever have to
make, and it may be the vote that takes me out
of office. But we can't operate out of fear."
Eshoo handled questions on everything
from national health care, to the North Amer
ican Free Trade Agreement, to the National
Service Act.

Despite voting with other Democrats on
most issues, Eshoo emphasized that she
casts her vote according to what she thinks
will be good for her constituents and the coun
try as a whole, not according to the party line.
"I don't respond to force," Eshoo said.
"And I don't need a party to tell me how to
vote."
Eshoo called the debate on health care "a
healthy conversation," and pointed out that
universal health care is imperative for a fai
tering U.S. economy. Health care accounts for
14 percent of the nation's gross national prod
uct, of which 25 percent is spent on adminis
trative costs, Eshoo said.
"We need to get socks on this octopus.. . .
We need to concentrate on health care, not
health paperwork," Eshoo said, eliciting a
loud round of applause.
After the meeting, Eshoo fielded more
questions from a crowd that gathered around
her.
Doneld Dunnett, a Redwood City resident,
was pleased with Eshoo's comments. "She
embodies the idea that we have to assume
responsibility for each other," Dunnett said.
Senior Ken Kyniyuki, a former Clinton
campaign worker, was impressed with
Eshoo's commitment to ideals.
"She seems sincere, and a very principled
policy-maker," Kyniyuki said. "I think she's
willing to risk political damage to make a vote
based on principles."
Although the audience was mostly support
ive of Eshoo, several voiced doubts about the
country's ability to pay for national health care.
Eshoo responded by offering suggestions for
saving money through prevention programs,
including prenatal care for young women.
After the meeting, Eshoo spoke about the
reform of federal student loans.
She said the House has already begun
enacting reforms specified by the recently

passed National Service Act. Eventually, addi
tional reforms will eliminate secondary loan
sources such as private banks, Eshoo said.
She criticized the present system, which
gives advantages to banks, who are guaran
teed payment from the government.
"I mean, that's a cockamamie system!" said
Eshoo. "With more direct loans and the new
National Service Act, there will be more
accountability, because there is a return of
community service."
The federally funded town hall meeting was
co-sponsored by Stanford In Government and
Stanford's Office of Government Relations.

willing to risk political damage to make a vote
based on principles."
Although the audience was mostly support
ive of Eshoo, several voiced doubts about the
country's ability to pay for national health care.
Eshoo responded by offering suggestions for
saving money through prevention programs,
including prenatal care for young women.
After the meeting, Eshoo spoke about the
reform of federal student loans.
She said the House has already begun
enacting reforms specified by the recently

passed National Service Act. Eventually, addi
tional reforms will eliminate secondary loan
sources such as private banks, Eshoo said.
She criticized the present system, which
gives advantages to banks, who are guaran
teed payment from the government.
"I mean, that's a cockamamie system!" said
Eshoo. "With more direct loans and the new
National Service Act, there will be more
accountability, because there is a return of
community service."
The federally funded town hall meeting was
co-sponsored by Stanford In Government and
Stanford's Office of Government Relations.
