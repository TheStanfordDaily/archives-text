# Fire official OKs open doors at Wilbur
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Fortunately for residents and staff of
Wilbur Hall who yearn to live in an open-door
"community" atmosphere, the county fire
marshal has agreed to recognize that even
within the law, there is room for a few excep
tions.
The law, in this case, is the Santa Clara
County fire code that, if read strictly, will not
allow residents to prop open automatically
closing fire doors. But Deputy Fire Marshal
Allison Pena agreed at a meeting last week
with Wilbur's residence staff and project
supervisors not to penalize students for, in
effect, breaking the law by keeping their doors
open.
"I can't condone it, but I can't enforce it,"
Pena said. "I can't go down the corridor col
lecting doorstops. It's not reasonable."
Many residents in the newly renovated

Wilbur have complained that the automati
cally closing doors hinder the community
atmosphere, and are employing bricks and
other objects to keep their doors open.
Pena said as long as students do not dis
mantle the device that makes the doors swing
shut, they will not be cited for propping the
doors open, a decision which pleased those
involved with the Wilbur project.
"She understands dorm life," Wilbur Facil
ities Supervisor Clark Vitt said of the fire
marshal. "Some people want these doors open
so there can be a community."
The importance of Pena's decision to look
the other way will become more evident in the
next year, as students in other dorms face the
same situation. The county has set a Septem
ber 1994 deadline for the University to install
automatically closing doors in all residences
without fire sprinklers.
These include Lagunita Court, Branner
Hall, Toyon Hall, Crothers Hall, Crothers

Memorial Hall, and possibly Florence Moore
Hall and Stern Hall.
Now that the county and the University
have done their part, it is up to the students to
decide how they will deal with the doors, Pena
said.
"I've done my job by enforcing the code,
and the University has done its job by com
plying with it," she said. "Students have to
take some level of responsibility on them
selves."
Stephanie Huie, a resident assistant in the
all-freshman Otero, was relieved at the deci
sion.
She said Wilbur RAs were stunned when
they first arrived and thought that all the
doors would have to remain closed.
"[Pena] was understanding and came up
with a solution we could all live with," Huie
said. "It's ridiculous for her to be spending all
her time writing up 90 people when there's so
many other things for her to do."
