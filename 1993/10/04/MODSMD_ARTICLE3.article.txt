# Wilbur refurbishing delays other clusters
## Row, Suites, Governor's Corner won't get computers until Oct. 22 
### Elissa Lee 
Although the University
promised in February to install
computer clusters in all under
graduate residences by the begin
ning of this quarter, most of the
dorms on the Row, in the Suites
and Governor's Corner will not
have computer clusters until Oct.
22.
ATO, Grove and Xanadu are
the only Row houses that now
have computer clusters. These
were given first priority because
the resident computer coordina
tors for the Row live there, said
Director of Residential Comput
ing JefT Merriman.
The installation of computers
at other residences will continue
along the Row and progress to

ward the west side of campus, end
ing at the Suites.
"We are generally going by the
areas in which RCCs live in to get
the work done," Merriman said.
While the summer was spent
designing and furnishing comput
er facilities in all the Row houses,
most houses still lack the Macin
tosh LCI I, Centris 610 and Laser
writer that will make up their
computer cluster.
"The delay occurred because of
the Wilbur project. With fresh
men in Wilbur needing to take
math and chemistry placement
tests, the Wilbur project had to be
finished first," Merriman said.
Merriman said he expects to
have some type of delay almost

every year with the computer
clusters in the Row houses,
because of their "insecure loca
tion." The computers in the clus
ters will have to be removed at
the end of every school year and
reinstalled at the beginning of the
next year.
Along with new computer clus
ters, each of the Row houses will

have a computer manager. The
three RCCs will each serve a desig
nated geographical area, Merriman
said. Computer managers, trained
by RCCs, will handle basic prob
lems, and RCCs will handle larger
problems such as disk recovery.
Merriman said the Row hous
es, Suites and Governor's Corner
still will not have access to high
er-end computers and equipment
— such as Next computer sta
tions and scanners — that other
dorms have. Because each Row
house is so small, the costs of

installing Next computer stations
in each were too high.
However, Merriman said he is
looking into creating a centralized
computer cluster with higher-end
computers for the Row in order to
provide residents with the oppor
tunity to use such equipment.
While relocation of funds in
Residential Education allowed for
the installation of the new forth
coming clusters, Housing and Food
Service will be responsible for
upgrading the computer clusters
every three years.
