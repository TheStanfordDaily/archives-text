dorms on the Row, in the Suites
and Governor's Corner will not

ATO, Grove and Xanadu are
the only Row houses that now

were given first priority because

Director of Residential Comput

The installation of computers
at other residences will continue
along the Row and progress to

most houses still lack the Macin
tosh LCI I, Centris 610 and Laser
writer that will make up their
computer cluster.
"The delay occurred because of
the Wilbur project. With fresh
men in Wilbur needing to take
math and chemistry placement
tests, the Wilbur project had to be
finished first," Merriman said.
Merriman said he expects to
have some type of delay almost
