# Casper's full agenda: Trying for too much?
## Aides claim ambitious reforms are feasible News Analysis 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Comparisons between University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and President Clin
ton have been irresistible since the two
men took office within four months of each
other last year.

From the start,
both were saddled

with no less a duty
than to restore faith in diseased institu
tions searching for new direction.
The last nine months have uncovered
still more similarities. Both Casper and
Clinton are policy wonks who relish the op
portunity to expound on complex issues, be
it health care or speech codes. Both men
prefer to throw ideas out for wide discus
sion than to make precipitous decisions.
And both have struggled through their
first year in office to portray themselves as
leaders with farsighted, if at times unpopu
lar, visions for the future.
Now Casper, firmly established in his
second year as president, is introducing
this fall a series of reforms that may signif
icantly redefine Stanford's very founda
tions. And that activism raises a question
that has dogged Clinton since January: Is
he trying to do too much?
With the Faculty Senate's endorsement
of Casper's sexual harassment policy
Thursday, the president gained a vital vic
tory for a project which consumed much of
his attention last year. But forthcoming is
a review of undergraduate education, re

structuring of the Medical Center, in
creased attention to multicultural affairs,
continued negotiations with the govern
ment, efforts to revitalize slumping alumni
activity and a wave of recently announced
budget cuts.
Administrators insist that Casper's
whirlwind agenda, while ambitious, is not
untenable. The perception that the presi
dent has bitten off more than he can chew,
they maintain, ignores those who are help
ing him eat.
With the appointment of Provost Con
doleezza Rice and the filling of other ad
ministrative posts last spring, Casper had
assembled a team of assistants who suit his
penchant for rigorous, lively examination
of University issues. That new blood has
apparently inspired Casper himself, who
toward the end of last year seemed harried
and enervated.
"I think it will be an exciting year," said
Senior Assoc. Provost Lowell Price.
"There's an increased sense of energy
here."
Jean Fetter, special assistant to the
president, described the mood among
Casper and his advisers as "energetic and
optimistic."
"We are in a much stronger position
than we were in last year," she said. "Ger
hard is in his second year, and he's tackling
with confidence the issues he's identified."
That Casper is an eager and spirited
president seriously concerned with the
well-being of both Stanford and
higher education in general is
undisputed. What was at times
frustrating for students and
administrators alike is that in his
first year, Casper was wont to
float ideas — the most-publicized
being his three-year degree pro
posal — and then back away frum
tangible, policy-making.
But that reluctance may well
have been due to both an unfamil
iarity with the Stanford scene and
the lack of hand-picked assistants
in key places. Casper can hardly
be blamed if he occasionally felt
like a general leading a charge
without a cavalry behind him.
This year, however, all the
president's men and women have
arrived. "We've been helped mas
sively by administrative positions
being filled," Fetter said. "With
new people come new energies
and new ideas."
The most important of these,
administrators agree, is Provost
Rice, a former professor of politi
cal science whose stature as the
youngest provost in University
history is reflected in the buoyan
cy she brings to the job.
"She's an extremely active per
son who has a lot of experience in
the policy domain," Price said.
"She helps Gerhard a lot. They
work very effectively together —
they complement each other in
styles and interests."
Last Thursday, Rice made a
stirring debut as provost at the
year's first Faculty Senate meet
ing. After Casper left the meeting
to attend an alumni reception,
Rice steered the lengthy debate
on the harassment policy to a
vote, then announced plans for
sweeping budget cuts she herself
will oversee.
Though Casper will certainly be
actively involved in those discus
sions, the budget-cutting effort
demonstrates the critical differ
ence between this year and last for
the president, and speaks to the
impetus for his aggressive agenda
In some respects, the load on
his shoulders may actually have
lessened. This leaves the presi
dent time to dabble in abstract
discussions on undergraduate
education, which he has
promised as a supplement to the
formal Commission on Under

graduate Education, and multi
culturalism, as evinced by his
introduction of a campus-wide
symposium titled "Culture and
Cultures in the 21st Century."
His assistants all maintain that
Casper has returned from sum
mer vacation in rested and san
guine spirits. That's a far cry from
the man who showed visible signs
of wear and tear last spring, par
ticularly when he angrily — and
quite unnecessarily — insisted to
the Faculty Senate in late May
that he was deluged with work
and that anyone who wanted an
appointment could meet him
when he arose at 4 a.m.
For now, that frustration seems
to be behind Casper. But will it stay
there? Though it is dangerous to
draw conclusions from a single
event, Thursday's senate meeting
offered hints of what confronts him.
Casper entered the senate's
meeting room in an affable vein,
chatting casually with professors
and curiously peering around the
room like a returning student
seeking out familiar faces at a
first lecture. The president was
relaxed and funny, joking about
Rice's knowledge of football and
laughing when hammers pound
ed above in the heat of the sexual
harassment discussion.
But as misgivings about the
revised draft increased in num
ber and intensity, Casper became
clearly unnerved. He restlessly
began packing his notes and pre
emptively said "yes, yes" when a
speaker tried to explain the rea
sons for her objections. The pres
ident bolted from the discussion
to attend a homecoming func
tion, but not before he gruffly
brushed aside two members from
the Council of Presidents and a
Daily reporter who had hoped to
talk with him.
And so the question remains
whether Casper can handle all he
has set out for himself — and the
University — with the equanimi
ty and success he customarily dis
plays but at times escapes him.
"He's an energetic man, and he
can handle the tasks he sets out
for himself," English Prof. Ron
Rebholz said. "He's not proposing
any inappropriate projects.
"But you may remember that
at the end of last year he
expressed frustration — no, exas
peration — at having so much to
do," Rebholz said. "I hope he can
deal with that better this year. It
remains to be seen."
