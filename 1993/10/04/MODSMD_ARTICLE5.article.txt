# Casper's full agenda: Trying for too much?
## Aides claim ambitious reforms are feasible News Analysis 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Comparisons between University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and President Clin
ton have been irresistible since the two
men took office within four months of each
other last year.

From the start,
both were saddled

with no less a duty
than to restore faith in diseased institu
tions searching for new direction.
The last nine months have uncovered
still more similarities. Both Casper and
Clinton are policy wonks who relish the op
portunity to expound on complex issues, be
it health care or speech codes. Both men
prefer to throw ideas out for wide discus
sion than to make precipitous decisions.
And both have struggled through their
first year in office to portray themselves as
leaders with farsighted, if at times unpopu
lar, visions for the future.
Now Casper, firmly established in his
second year as president, is introducing
this fall a series of reforms that may signif
icantly redefine Stanford's very founda
tions. And that activism raises a question
that has dogged Clinton since January: Is
he trying to do too much?
With the Faculty Senate's endorsement
of Casper's sexual harassment policy
Thursday, the president gained a vital vic
tory for a project which consumed much of
his attention last year. But forthcoming is
a review of undergraduate education, re

structuring of the Medical Center, in
creased attention to multicultural affairs,
continued negotiations with the govern
ment, efforts to revitalize slumping alumni
activity and a wave of recently announced
budget cuts.
Administrators insist that Casper's
whirlwind agenda, while ambitious, is not
untenable. The perception that the presi
dent has bitten off more than he can chew,
they maintain, ignores those who are help
ing him eat.
With the appointment of Provost Con
doleezza Rice and the filling of other ad
ministrative posts last spring, Casper had
assembled a team of assistants who suit his
penchant for rigorous, lively examination
of University issues. That new blood has
apparently inspired Casper himself, who
toward the end of last year seemed harried
and enervated.
"I think it will be an exciting year," said
Senior Assoc. Provost Lowell Price.
"There's an increased sense of energy
here."
Jean Fetter, special assistant to the
president, described the mood among
Casper and his advisers as "energetic and
optimistic."
"We are in a much stronger position
than we were in last year," she said. "Ger
hard is in his second year, and he's tackling
with confidence the issues he's identified."
That Casper is an eager and spirited
president seriously concerned with the
