# New Guinea totem pole garden slated for Roble
## 
### Vanessa Arrington 
Though still in the planning stages, a
sculpture garden made up of carved New
Guinean totem poles will be the next
art installment on campus.
Construction of the sculpture, which is
estimated to cost $120,000, will begin next
spring near Roble Hall if everything goes as
scheduled, said campus planner Charles
Carter.
The artwork, which is being directed
by anthropology graduate student James
Mason, is part of a research project su
pervised by the Anthropology Depart
ment.
One-sixth of the budget for the New
Guinea sculpture garden, which will be
located at the corner of Lomita Drive
and Santa Teresa Street, is being provid
ed by the General Plant Improvement
Fund.
The fund, which usually has a $2-4 mil
lion annual budget, grants money for such
things as landscaping, lighting and outdoor
art, Carter said.
The other $100,000 needed for the pro
ject will come from grants and donations.
A similar, controversial project was re

cently completed in Rains graduate hous
ing. According to Mike Kuntz, a Facilities
assistant project manager, the final cost of
this sculpture is not yet known, but will be
close to the projected $140,000.
The Rains sculpture was funded by the
University, billed as a part of building
costs.
Decisions about outdoor art placement
on campus are made by the University
Committee on Outdoor Art, which is com
prised of representatives from such areas
as the Stanford Museum and the Art De
partment, Carter said. This committee de
termines what to do with outdoor art and
how to spend money from the improvement
fund.
Money from this fund also contributed
to the building of the Rains sculpture, a
concrete structure covered with plants that
looks like half a hill rising up from the mid
dle of a grassy field.
The committee, which has met off and
on for about 25 years, has been responsible
for almost all the campus' outdoor artwork,
according to Art Prof. Albert Elsen, a mem
ber of the committee.
