# Chaos revisited
## 400 band alums strut their wackiness at halftime show

Instruments lay forgotten as the old and new
members of the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, practicing the halftime show,
stumbled in and out of formation. As the frustrated
announcer tried unsuccessfully to gather hi 3 wan
dering flock, Band alumnus Stu Weiss, Class of'B2,
revelled in the chaos.
"This is the way it's always been,"he said, laugh
ing.
This weekend's Band reunion, part of the Uni
versity's first all-class homecoming reunion week
end, brought over 400 of the University's merry
minstrels back for music, carousing and the football
game between Stanford and Notre Dame. The
homecoming festivities included the Band's tradi
tional pre- and post-game celebrations and a Friday
night blowout at the Mausoleum.
But, to the more than 80,000 spectators that
packed Stanford Stadium on Saturday, the re
union's most memorable event was the halftime
show.
Former drum mtyor Dylan Johnson braved the
afternoon heat to appear as the
Band's own version of Elvis, com
plete with a crimson polyester
jumpsuit and sideburned wig. Not
to be outdone, this year's leader
Marin Melchior sported a Lady
Godiva-esque mane and a cone
shaped bustier.
Among the sea of red band
jackets and resurrected costumes
were squads of former Dollies, the
Band's dance team, from the late
'60s to the present. Though the
Dollie alumnae continued to swiv
el and grind beside this year's
squad, a few also used their hips
to hold their small children as

they danced, while others were
visibly pregnant.
Alumni who returned for the
reunion weekend had their first
chance to reacquaint themselves
with the Band and its new mem
bers at Friday afternoon's practice.
"Walking back here [to the
field], it was like the first time I'd
been in band. There was this sea
of new faces," Weiss said.
"Rehearsals haven't changed.
There's still a lot of yelling and
chaos and confusion."
The idea of graduates continu
ing to play is not altogether new
to the infamous musicians. The
Band has an informal policy that
anyone who lives near enough to
make the rehearsals and can play
the music is welcome.
While some Band alumni still

hang out at the Band Shak, many
find themselves creeping into a
respectable lifestyle. "My life in
the Band was so different than
my life now," said Lisa Morando,
Class of '82. "I'm just this conser
vative, suburban mom now, and
then I was this crazy hellion."
"We were the ones who got us
kicked off national television for
continually forming Phallic forma
tions on the field," Morando added.
"On airplanes, we'd all move to one
side or the other crazy stuff."
And while Morando got a
chance to revert to her "hellion"
roots for the weekend, the subur
ban mom in her still noticed a few
housekeeping details. "The Band
Shak is exactly the same,"
Morando said. "I don't think
they've vacuumed since we left!"
