## Yeltsin's forces storm parliament building Tanks, gunfire rattle Moscow; white flag waved from White House 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Battle tanks and
armored personnel carriers carrying forces
loyal to President Boris Yeltsin fired on the
Russian White House today in an assault
aimed at flushing out hard-line lawmakers
inside.
The T-72 battle tanks fired their can
nons, smashing rows of windows in the
building and raising clouds of smoke and
dust. Helicopters circled the White House.
Three hours into the battle there were
bodies in the streets surrounding the build
ing and Interfax news agency reported a
white flag was waved from a White House
window. There was no confirmation of the
report.
The early morning attack followed riots
yesterday in which parliament supporters
smashed through police lines, stormed the
mayor's office and attacked the headquar
ters of the state television company.
At least 24 people were killed yesterday
as Russia's long political crisis exploded
into the worst political violence in Moscow
since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Many
more casualties were expected from today's
assault.
"There can be no forgiveness, because
they raised their hands against innocent

people," Yeltsin said on nationwide televi
sion, explaining the reasons for the assault
on parliament.
"The armed revolt is doomed," he said.
Following the tank fire, Vice President
Alexander Rutskoi issued an appeal from
the White House for a renewal of peace
talks, Interfax news agency reported. There
also was an unconfirmed report that Rut
skoi, a leader of the uprising against Yeltsin,
was prepared to surrender.
Armored personnel carriers hit the front
of the white marble parliament building
with heavy fire. Smoke briefly rose from
the clock tower atop the riverfront building.
Parliament defenders were believed to have
snipers in the tower.
The Russian tricolor flag continued to
fly above the building, but was obscured by
thick black and white smoke that billowed
into the blue sky. Military helicopters flew
over the building.
American diplomats and their families
took refuge in underground shelters as the
guns roared at the White House, across the
street from the U.S. Embassy.
The attack came after Yeltsin's govern
ment gave the hard-line lawmakers one last
chance to surrender their arms and end

their two-week defiance of Yeltsin's decree
dissolving parliament and calling new elec
tions. Yeltsin and the parliament had been
locked in a bitter struggle over reform for
months.
Yeltsin issued another decree today
ordering the ministries of defense, interior
and security to restore order in Moscow.
That was the official sanction for the
assault on the White House.
Elite commandos of the Interior Min
istry's KGB Dzerzhinsky Division, wearing
civilian clothes but riding on armored per
sonnel carriers, approached the building
from two directions at about 7 a.m.
They were followed by tanks and sol
diers from the Russian army's Taman Divi
sion and by paratroopers from the Tula
Division. All of the units apparently had
come into Moscow overnight from bases
around the capital.
The attack caught motorists by surprise.
Men waving pistols kept pedestrians and
journalists off a bridge leading to the par
liament. A city bus passed through the area
as frightened passengers crouched in their
seats and the driver wore a look of terror.
The new fighting followed a day of vio
lence in which screaming hard-line

protesters hurling rocks and firing guns
broke the government siege of parliament
and seized other key installations.
Yeltsin, rushing back to the Kremlin
from his countiy home, declared a state of
emergency, giving police wide power to
crack down on unrest, and appealed to peo
ple not to aid the protest.
"We call upon your common sense and
responsibility for the fate of your children,"
a government statement said.
Heavy fighting also raged around the
capital's main TV complex early today with
red tracer bullets soaring through the night
sky. Thousands of unarmed Yeltsin sup
porters took to the streets to support the
president.
Armored vehicles poured into central
Moscow early today and took up positions
outside the Defense Ministry and near the
Kremlin in the army's first msyor show of
support for Yeltsin. Several tanks stood
outside a irayor Moscow railway station,
and 1,500 army troops entered the city,
news agencies reported.
Anti-Yeltsin protesters overwhelmed riot
police yesterday in vicious street fighting
and later seized the headquarters of the
Moscow city government and the headquar

ters of ITAR-Tass, the Russian news agen
cy. Interior Ministry troops later retook the
Tass building without violence.
The protesters attacked Russia's main
television complex with rocket-propelled
grenades as government commandos shot
back in a blazing fire fight. Government
paratroopers in armored personnel carriers
attacked the protesters, blasting them with
machine-gun fire. Three TV channels went
off the air as fighting raged for hours with
red tracer bullets soaring through the night
sky. Government forces continued to hold
the complex.
Hard-line lawmakers urged their tri
umphant followers to seize other key instal
lations and take control of the government.
They called for Yeltsin's overthrow and the
"liquidation" of his government.
"We have to take the Kremlin," parlia
ment speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov told the
parliament, referring to the government
seat of power where Yeltsin was in his
office.
Yeltsin spent the night meeting with top
advisers and key security officials, his
spokesman said. He also ordered increased
security to protect Russia's arsenal of nucle
ar missiles, said Gen. Konstantin Kobets.
