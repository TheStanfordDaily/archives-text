NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - At
least five Americans were killed
yesterday during a U.N. military
operation against Somali warlord
Mohamed Farrah Aidid, the Pen
tagon reported.
Some U.S. troops were also
wounded and two U.S. Army
Blackhawk helicopters were shot
down during the operation, said a
statement issued in Washington.
Details were not clear because the
military operation was still under
way, the statement said.
About 20 Somalis, including at
least one high-ranking member of
Aidid's leadership, were detained

during the operation, the state
ment said. The operation involved
elite U.S. Rangers, it said, referring
to the troops sent to Somalia in
August to try to seize Aidid.
Earlier yesterday, a Somali U.N.
employee was killed and three U.S.
Marines were wounded when a
mine explosion ripped through
their military vehicle in
Mogadishu, a U.N. spokesman
said.
The latest violence underscored
the difficulty the U.N. forces have
had in trying to capture Aidid, who
is blamed for masterminding
attacks that have killed 56 peace

keepers since June.
Aidid says the U.N. troops
have become an unwanted occu
pying force. Some U.S. lawmak
ers have called for a pullout of
U.S. troops.
President Clinton offered sym
pathy to the friends and families of
the Americans who were killed, but
gave no indication he had second
thoughts about continuing the
U.S. role in the U.N. mission in
Somalia.
U.S. Defense Secretary Les
Aspin rejected suggestions that the
United States immediately with
draw from U.N. peacekeeping

efforts in Somalia, saying such a
move would lead to a return of
famine in the African nation.
Three Americans were killed
Sept. 25 when their Blackhawk
helicopter was downed by a rocket
propelled grenade fired by Somali
militiamen. That was the first loss
of a helicopter by U.S. forces to
hostile fire in Somalia
Earlier yesterday, a mine explo
sion occurred about a quarter-mile
from the U.N. port complex, the
U.N. spokesman, Maj. David
Stockwell, said by telephone from
the Somali capital.
Three Marines were hospitalized

in stable condition yesterday evening
with shrapnel wounds and burns.
Stockwell said the mine was
remotely detonated and apparently
specifically targeted the Humvee
utility vehicle. After the explosion,
Somali gunmen ambushed the
Humvee, he said.
"It is just another in a series of
unprovoked attacks on U.N. troops
in general and on U.S. troops in
particular," he said.
A Blackhawk helicopter was
shot at when it arrived at the scene,
but managed to land and rescue
the survivors, Stockwell said.
The Blackhawk and two other

helicopters returned fire with
machine guns and cannons, Stock
well said. He said there were
"undoubtedly" casualties on the
other side, but said he did not know
how many.
Clinton said the U.N.-led "effort
in Somalia has succeed in bringing
order to most of the country with
district councils being chosen,
schools and hospitals reopening
and crops harvested.
"These positive developments
must not be lost because of the will
ingness of a few to reject the peace
ful political process and seek to
achieve power by force," he said.
