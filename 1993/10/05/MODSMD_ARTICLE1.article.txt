# Clinton endorses $237 million SLAC project
## B factory upgrade will keep, create jobs; proposal awaits congressional approval 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
As part of his plan to strength
en California's economy, Presi
dent Clinton announced yester
day that the Department of Ener
gy has recommended granting the
$237 million, federally funded B
factory project to Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
"There was strong competition
for this project by scientists who
have worked in this area for liter
ally years," Clinton said. "The B
factory is a $240 million interna
tional project to create an elec

tron-positron collider . . . for
studying the underpinning of all
science — the relationship of mat
ter and antimatter. It will involve
hundreds of scientists and build
on decades of previous work at the
Stanford facility."
Clinton, on a three-day tour of
California, announced the deci
sion at a packed San Francisco
press conference attended by
University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost Condoleezza
Rice, SLAC Director Burton
Richter and several legislators
who have pushed for the B facto
ry's placement at Stanford.

"We're delighted the adminis
tration is finally going to recom
mend putting the B factory at
SLAC," Richtersaid.
The project is now winding its
way through the Senate and vari
ous congressional committees.
Richter predicted that the con
gressional decision will be made
within the next few weeks. The
chances for approval are "pretty
good," he said, "but I don't want
to be presumptuous about Con
gress."
"I keep reminding my staff,
'The administration proposes,
Congress disposes.' And it still has
to go through the appropriations
process," he said.
Stanford's success in landing
the project over its competitor
Cornell University — which had
offered the government a cheaper
proposal for the B factory —
means that SLAC will retain 200
to 300 employees who would have
been laid off if the project had
been given to another laboratory.
"This is the latest in the cycle of
renewal projects for the laborato
ry. .. . This assures that the lab
will be at the frontier of science for
another decade," Richter said.
