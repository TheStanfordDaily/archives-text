First-come, first-served
improves over past; cost
for Spike is questionable

LAST WEEK, the ASSU Sen
ate approved the fees neces
sary to bring the two featured
guests on the Speakers' Bureau's
1993-94 lineup to campus. Spike
Lee and Paul Tsongas will undoubt
edly be thought-provoking and
intriguing performers when they
appear at Stanford, and the Bureau
should be applauded for arranging
their campus appearances.
However, the upcoming presenta
tions evoke a series of questions
regarding both the logistics of Lee's
and Tsongas' speeches and what
appears to be the fundamental phi
losophy of the Speakers' Bureau
and many other organizations that
bring speakers to campus.
First, the Speakers' Bureau is to
be commended for instituting a
first-come, first-serve method of
ticket distribution for the Lee
speech.
The lottery system used in the
past defeats its intended purpose —
the fair distribution of tickets to
high-turnout events — in two
ways. First, it oftentimes frightens
away students who believe that
their odds of receiving a ticket to a
given event are slim. One example
of this reaction occurred last year,
preceding the Ice-T speech. Though
campus interest was piqued by both
the speaker and his message, Ice-T
spoke before a less-than-capacity
house because of students' chari
ness concerning the lottery system.
A first-come, first-serve system
eliminates this problem by allowing
the most-motivated students the
opportunity to ensure their atten
dance at particular events.
Furthermore, the lottery system
is, bluntly, a series of nuisances.
Students must first pick up their
ticket, then check a posted list to see
if they were admitted to the event,
then pick up their actual entrance

ticket. The new system is easier, and
should be used in the future as well.
Second, there would be a great
advantage for the University to
allow the Speakers' Bureau and
other groups flexibility in schedul
ing different event sites in the event
of larger-than-expected crowds.
Since most speeches are held at
night, there is a wide array of empty
auditoriums available for the
events; if, for example, more people
sign up to attend a certain speech
than Memorial Auditorium can fea
sibly hold, then that event could be
transferred to a larger on-campus
venue.
Of more concern is the Speakers'
Bureau's distribution of funds so far
in the year. Bringing Spike Lee to
campus is certainly a coup from a
media perspective; his speech will
undoubtedly receive a good deal of
press coverage.
But the question must be asked:
Is it preferable to bring one or two
big names to campus each quarter,
or several other lesser-known but
perhaps equally important speak
ers? Lee's speech will be well
attended. It will probably draw from
all campus communities. It will like
ly be thoughtful and intriguing. But
it is only one speech. And it will cost
at least $12,500, almost $1 per reg
istered student.
Of course, many other speakers
will come to campus over the quar
ter. But for the future, it may be bet
ter if the policy of bringing big-tick
et speakers to campus comes under
closer review. Four or five Paul
Tsongas speeches may likely mean
more to Stanford students than just
one by Spike Lee.
The Speakers' Bureau's hono
raria budget for the 1993-94 calen
der year is $60,000, a figure which
was approved by 66 percent of stu
dents during the April elections.
This vote of confidence in the
Speakers' Bureau is largely justi
fied; the Bureau is perhaps the most
effective of the ASSU Service Pro
jects.
But at this rate of spending, stu
dents won't see too much of that
effectiveness in a year.
