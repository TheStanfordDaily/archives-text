## Tom Seligman Museum exhibitions, repairs to building 
### 
I WANT TO welcome all the new
members of the Stanford communi
ty and to tell you about our exhibi
tion program this fall at the Art Gallery
as well as a few particulars about the
museum — its past, present and future.
Two exhibitions open Oct. 19 at the
Art Gallery. "Nuclear Enchantment,"
Patrick Nagatani's large-format pho
tographs, suggests a world altered by
nuclear-weapons photographs tested in
the New Mexico deserts. In his pho
tographs Nagatani places missiles and
planes, combined in scenes with irradi
ated people, in shockingly saturated
colors.
In conjunction with this exhibition,
the photographer will speak on Oct. 21
at 5 p.m. in the Cummings Art Build
ing.
The poet Denise Levertov will give a
special reading of her work at the Art
Gallery on Nov. 1 and a symposium,
"Re-Thinking the Unthinkable: Per
sonal Reflections on the Nuclear Age,"
is scheduled for Nov. 13.
A smaller exhibition, "Dreams of
Terror/Scenes of Destruction," com
prised of prints, drawings and pho
tographs from the museum's perma
nent collection, surveys our deeply felt
anxieties and our fear of death and a
last judgment, and documents many
acts of violence, rape, massacre and
warfare from the 17th into the 20th

century. Artists from Durer to Goya,
Blake to Kollwitz and Picasso are rep
resented.
Let me tell you also about the special
circumstances of the grand old museum
building which currently stands behind
cyclone fencing, in isolation, off Palm
Drive. The structure of the building,
but remarkably few of the art objects in
its collections, was damaged by the
Loma Prieta earthquake of October
1989.
The collections are now in storage,
awaiting a renovated building for rein
stallation, but fortunately the exten
sive collection of Auguste Rodin's
sculpture, given by the B. Gerald Can
tor, can be seen in the garden adjacent
to the museum.
And throughout the campus are
located examples of contemporary
sculpture by Alexander Calder, Henry
Moore, Rodin and others, including our
newest piece "Fragment: The Hidden
Sea" by John Roloff, sited in Rains
housing.
Docent guided tours of the Rodin
sculpture garden are offered through
the Committee for Art, which also
offers special student memberships.
We are currently raising funds to
renovate the handsome historic muse
um structure and build a new wing.
And while we are making great
progress, the project is complex and

costly. We recently have had good news
with our fund raising and now can esti
mate that we will reopen in 1997. The
museum had been much more severely
damaged by the 1906 earthquake,
which destroyed almost three-quarters
of the original building.
At that time it had been one of the
largest private museums in the world.
The Stanfords in their European trav
els in the early 1880s had exposed their
son, Leland Jr. to classical art. After his
sudden death in Florence, they deter
mined to establish a university in his
memory and saw the museum as play
ing a vital educational role.
Today we carry on the tradition of
the Stanfords' belief in the importance
of education. We offer docent tours of
both of our exhibitions on a regular
schedule and by appointment to special
groups as well as related programs of
lectures and symposia. We encourage
students to become involved with the
Museum's programs and welcome them
as volunteer workers. We also maintain
a study room in the gallery for Art
Department classes and offer volunteer
opportunities to students in the Muse
um. We welcome you and look forward
to seeing you at some of these events
this coming year.
