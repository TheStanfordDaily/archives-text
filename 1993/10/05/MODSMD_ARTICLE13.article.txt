## Stanford's greatness: a more 'conventional' standard 
### 
THE SEPT. 29 edition of The Daily
contained an article written by
Prof. John Manley in which he
attempted to demonstrate that Stanford
is not a great university. Although I am
not particularly interested in determin
ing the greatness of Stanford University,
I think the standard he uses for measur
ing Stanford is a particularly unimpor
tant one. Stanford should set its sights on
more conventional standards for institu
tional performance.
Manley claims that Stanford is "a terri
ble failure" at the most important measure
for greatness of a university: the degree to
which it upholds and teaches human val
ues. Unfortunately, he never defines what
human values are.
Presumably, human values are things
that humans value. With the world's
human population approaching five billion,
however, that becomes a rather long list. By
human values, does Manley mean the val
ues that all humans share? Not likely.
In his article Manley clearly demon

strates that he and the administration do
not share the same human values. In fact,
he cites examples where students and fac
ulty have unsuccessfully tried to influence
University policy when these "human val
ues" were threatened. This power struggle
with the administration is essentially a
political one. Thus, human values necessar
ily constitute a political agenda for Manley.
What is the basis for these for these so
called human values? Manley tips his hand
when he says "22 years at Stanford have
shown me there is nothing hallowed about
our grounds." He is apparently censuring
Stanford on moral grounds, no pun intend
ed. Morality, particularly secular morality,
is extremely subjective.
If there is little consensus in the aca
demic community on what constitutes
moral conduct, there is even less consensus
on how to promote justice. Yet this is exact
ly what Manley condemns Stanford for not
doing: not promoting justice in a way that
he sees fit. He is not criticizing Stanford for
racist hiring practices, or for using funds

inappropriately (the Federal government
already got us on that one). His case for
Stanford's turpitude (e.g. investments in
South Africa, having a migrant farm, asso
ciation with the Hoover Institution) rests
on the principle of guilt by association. By
this standard, Manley would feel guilty for
his employment at Stanford.
But Manley shouldn't feel guilty for his
employment at Stanford, because his
integrity doesn't rest on the moral standing
of its business partners. Manley would
impose upon Stanford a standard of ethics
that he doesn't apply to himself.
Just because certain actions are avail
able to Stanford University, actions intend
ed to promote equity in the world, doesn't
mean those actions are appropriate, just or
even effective.
In addition, Stanford University is not
in the business of using its financial
resources to further Prof. Manley's political
agenda, however noble it may be. Manley
would have us believe that his agenda is the
only morally responsible course of action.

But at a university, our attention should
focus on a dialogue and investigation of
available courses of action, not the presen
tation and implementation of the "correct"
solution. When a university takes upon
itself the prerogative of upholding a politi
cal agenda, the collective focus of student
attention is turned from the search for
truth to the institutionalization of truth. I
am not against the institutionalization of
truth per se, but it runs contrary to the
spirit of a university, the spirit University
President Gerhard Casper elucidated in his
inauguration address.
Naturally, for a university to excel in
certain virtues (e.g. impartiality, honesty)
is in its own best interests. Such virtues fos
ter an atmosphere conducive to the pursuit
of knowledge. But I think that a university
functions best when it provides a forum for
the discussion of ideas, and allows the stu
dents to decide which ones to take home.
