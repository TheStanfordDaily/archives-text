## 'Goodfellas,' 'The Joy Luck Club' and thou 
### 
An open letter to 51 percent of the
earth's population:
Dear sistas,
I cram to understand you ... but I still
can't figure you out — especially when
it comes to movies. As one of my best
friends said recently, your entertainment
ain't like mine, and I'm starting to think
that it ain't nuttin' but a G thang: G for
guy, G for girl and G for the widening gen
der gap between us in pop culture.
Case in point: we read "The Joy Luck
Club," we loved it and we all tripped out
when Hollywood announced that they
would make it into a movie, proving that
one G could appreciate another G's culture.
So what if it was about four first-generation
Chinese-American mothers and their sec
ond-generation daughters struggling to
resolve their deeply rooted animosities?
Tan's graceful prose and elliptical structure
kept this brotha flipping the pages until the
very end, then wishing she'd pulled a "War
& Peace," 'cause I could've kept going and
going and going....

Flash-forward to the present. One of you
calls me up and asks if I'd like to see a
movie. I suggest "The Joy Luck Club"and
that's fine by you. Cool. El Camino, Alma,
Shoreline — we get there just as they kick
the flick. As a disembodied female voice
tells the tale of her mother's magical swan
feather, said feather cuts through the black
screen, leaving white opening credits in its
wake. Visions of "Once Upon A Time in
China" dance through my head; even
though we're at the Century 10, I'm in art
house heaven.
I snap out of it pretty quickly once the
story takes off. As soon as one of the women
gets a daydreamy look on her face and the
camera closes in on her eyes, I start think
ing "cliche." Sure enough, she's having a
flashback to her childhood. Worse, her adult
self narrates the entire memory, explaining
everything to the point where we could close
our eyes to eliminate the now-redundant
visuals. Perhaps they're trying to capture
the feel of the novel, to reproduce the first
person narratives. Let's give them the bene
fit of the doubt — for now.
At the twenty-five-minute mark, I'm

definitely concerned about the quality of
this picture, but you seem to be enjoying
yourself. The actresses playing the daugh
ters get on my nerves because they don't
have any flavor. To me, they come across as
white women in virtual yellowface; that
might be part of Tan's message about
assimilation, but it just doesn't draw me in.
In fact, it seems like an attempt to univer
salize the novel (read: make sure white peo
ple don't feel alienated). The mothers fare
somewhat better, especially the irrepress
ible Auntie Lindo. I start waiting for Gong
Li ("Raise the Red Lantern") to magically
appear onscreen and liven things up, but
she, like Godot, won't be coming tonight.
After seventy-five minutes, I give up.
What has Amy Tan (who co-wrote the
screenplay) done to her novel? The enig
mas and mysteries of the book are
replaced with ham-fisted platitudes and
characterizations, and the wall-to-wall
narration destroys what little subtlety
that remains. At least Alice Walker didn't
design Spielberg's hack construction of a
"The Color Purple." My only perverse
pleasure comes from watching a theater

ful of sistas shed tears in perfect syn
chronicity, but I don't know why you both
er to shed them — the actresses weep
enough for an entire stadium. What was
an insightful novel has become a banal
tale of feminine uplift through crying your
eyes out in mother's arms — a Chinese
"Terms of Endearment."
On the way back, I think about why I
didn't like the film. The problem isn't cul
tural; otherwise, how could I dig Zhang
Yimou's Chinese tragedies? I toss out a
thought. What if this G was raised to not
appreciate your narrative — assuming that
narrative is gendered? You like "Ghost," I
like "Goodfellas;" you like "Terms of
Endearment," I like "Terminator." Makes
sense, doesn't it? You nod your head, we
figure that's the end of it.
A week later, I round up a posse of my
fellow G's to check Robert De Niro's "A
Bronx Tale." Same bat-time, same bat-the
ater, same bat-experience. Overuse of bad
narration, preachy message, completely
unsubtle — you know, sappy, corny and
over-done. But I enjoyed it, despite its prob
lems, for its tough-guy Italian dialogue,

bone-crushing violence and top-notch
soundtrack. It was mobster heaven, so I fig
ure you'll hate it.
Color me wrong; you share my reserva
tions, but you kind of liked it. Now you con
fess that you enjoyed "Terminator" and
could appreciate "Goodfellas," even if the
Sicilian guns-'n'-testosterone thing didn't
always make sense. Well riddle me this,
Batman: if you like guy movies and I like
guy movies is there such a thing as a guy
movie? My head's staring to hurt.
I'd wish I could return to my earlier
prognosis — it ain't nuttin' but a G thang,
baby — but it doesn't hold up. Just when I
think that I've got you figured out, you
change up on me faster than Madonna in a
Macy's department store. Maybe you can
explain it to this loc'ed out G goin' crazy
when you get a chance.
Dazed and confused,
N'Gai
