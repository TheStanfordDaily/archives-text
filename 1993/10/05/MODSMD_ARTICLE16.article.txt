## Stanford's newest spiking star Triefenbach shines for Cardinal 
###

Marnie Triefenbach was not given
much of a choice when it came to learn
ing how to play volleyball.
"My sister and I used to practice in
the back yard," Triefenbach said. "I
learned how to pass when she started
throwing balls at my face until I started
returning them."
The 6-foot outside hitter has come a
long way since those early informal
training sessions at home in southern
Illinois. Armed with incredible natural
athletic ability, Triefenbach has secured
a place as one of the starting six on the
defending national champion Stanford
women's volleyball team. Having played
in all 12 Cardinal matches so far this sea
son, she possesses a .259 hitting percent
age with 162 kills, 129 digs and 12 aces.
Triefenbach arrived on the Farm last
year in impressive company. She joined
classmates Cary Wendell, Wendy Hro
madka and Maureen McLaren as a mem
ber of the number one recruiting class in
the country, according to Volleyball
Monthly magazine.
Suddenly alongside players with
tremendous experience, Triefenbach was
once again called upon to learn the ropes
quickly as she began the adjustment
from high school volleyball to top-ten,
Division I play. Seeing action in 29 of
Stanford's 33 matches in her first sea
son, Triefenbach ended the year with a
.203 hitting percentage, tallying 96 kills
in 249 total attacks with 47 digs and nine
aces.
"She has tremendous ability," said
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw. "That's
something that's nice to start with."
Guided by this natural athletic
prowess, Triefenbach is still making the
transition to the fast-paced, complex col
legiate volleyball court.
"She's learning things as she goes,"
Shaw said. "It can be a frustrating time
for her and for me because I see this abil
ity and I want it to happen immediately.
I also realize I have to be patient and she
needs to be patient and continue to focus
in on what she's doing."
For as long as she can remember, ath

letics have been one of Triefenbach's pri
mary focuses. Inspired by her older sis
ter, Triefenbach set her sights on mak
ing her high-school volleyball team.
Not only did she land a spot on the
Belleville West squad, she ended up lead
ing the team to two Illinois state titles
and a No. 2 national ranking her senior
year. She was named the High School
Player of the Year by USA Today and
twice earned the honor of Illinois State
Player of the Year.
'She's got all the ability in
the world. Not just physi
cal ability, but mental
capability too. Once she
learns to really focus as
she needs to, she's going
to become a tremendous
player.'

Triefenbach got her first taste of
international competition the summer
before her junior year of high school. She
earned a spot on the U.S. Elite Junior
Team which won first place in the Junior
Olympic tournament in Canada.
This past summer she broadened her
scope, traveling to Germany on the
National "B" Team along with teammate
Anne Wicks. After training in San Diego
for two weeks, the squad faced both the
German Junior and Senior national
teams.
"Overall, it was a good experience,"
Triefenbach said. "But it did have its ups
and downs, mainly because we were
playing for eight hours a day, every day,
for a month — it was pretty intense."
During the Stanford volleyball sea
son, the players are expected to practice
and compete with much the same inten
sity level. While Triefenbach's determi
nation to improve is one source of moti
vation, she is also spurred on by her

teammates.
"Off the court we're all great friends,"
Triefenbach said. "I think a lot of that
friendship carries onto the court. There
is a lot of competition out there, but it
never gets to a stage where it's so hard
core competitive that people are snap
ping at each other, or just focusing on
themselves. Everyone works for the ben
efit of the team."
While a certain amount of competi
tion among players is inevitable on any
team, playing as the defending national
champion can definitely add extra ten
sion. Triefenbach cited Shaw, together
with assistant coaches Denise Corlett
and Kim Oden, as the force responsible
for alleviating this pressure.
"The coaches really help us focus on
one game at a time one play at a time,"
Triefenbach said. "They don't put any
pressure on us like, hey, you guys are the
national championship defenders, you
should be out there playing like it."
Although Triefenbach tries not to let
these outside expectations effect her, she
maintains a constant awareness of her
position as a Stanford athlete, a role she
takes very seriously.
"Kim Oden was telling us one time
that it's hard to imagine not having
this," Triefenbach said. "It's like a gift
that you have, to be an athlete and to
play at this level, to have that desire to
be competitive. She was always telling us
to make sure you take advantage of what
you have now, and go hard all the time
because some time it might not be there
again. I think about that a lot, it really
fired me up."
After her Stanford career, Triefen
bach hopes to continue playing volley
ball, possibly on the National Team or on
the beach circuit. "It basically depends
on me, and how hard I'm willing to
work," she said. Even if she chooses to
pursue a future in volleyball, Triefen
bach also hopes to eventually attend den
tal school.
For now, Triefenbach will concentrate
on the task at hand —improving her hit
ting game in hopes of returning to the
NCAA Final Four in December and
boosting the team in its shot at second
national title. Both Shaw and Triefen

bach know that experience will only
come with time for the developing sopho
more.
"She's got all the ability in the world,"

Shaw said. "Not just physical ability, but
mental capability too. Once she learns to
really focus as she needs to, she's going
to become a tremendous player."

NCAA Final Four in December and

national title. Both Shaw and Triefen

come with time for the developing sopho

"She's got all the ability in the world,"

Shaw said. "Not just physical ability, but
mental capability too. Once she learns to
really focus as she needs to, she's going
to become a tremendous player."

Marnie Triefenbach was not given
much of a choice when it came to learn
ing how to play volleyball.
"My sister and I used to practice in
the back yard," Triefenbach said. "I
learned how to pass when she started
throwing balls at my face until I started
returning them."
The 6-foot outside hitter has come a
long way since those early informal
training sessions at home in southern
Illinois. Armed with incredible natural
athletic ability, Triefenbach has secured
a place as one of the starting six on the
defending national champion Stanford
women's volleyball team. Having played
in all 12 Cardinal matches so far this sea
son, she possesses a .259 hitting percent
age with 162 kills, 129 digs and 12 aces.
Triefenbach arrived on the Farm last
year in impressive company. She joined
classmates Cary Wendell, Wendy Hro
madka and Maureen McLaren as a mem
ber of the number one recruiting class in
the country, according to Volleyball
Monthly magazine.
Suddenly alongside players with
tremendous experience, Triefenbach was
once again called upon to learn the ropes
quickly as she began the adjustment
from high school volleyball to top-ten,
Division I play. Seeing action in 29 of
Stanford's 33 matches in her first sea
son, Triefenbach ended the year with a
.203 hitting percentage, tallying 96 kills
in 249 total attacks with 47 digs and nine
aces.
"She has tremendous ability," said
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw. "That's
something that's nice to start with."
Guided by this natural athletic
prowess, Triefenbach is still making the
transition to the fast-paced, complex col
legiate volleyball court.
"She's learning things as she goes,"
Shaw said. "It can be a frustrating time
for her and for me because I see this abil
ity and I want it to happen immediately.
I also realize I have to be patient and she
needs to be patient and continue to focus
in on what she's doing."
For as long as she can remember, ath

letics have been one of Triefenbach's pri
mary focuses. Inspired by her older sis
ter, Triefenbach set her sights on mak
ing her high-school volleyball team.
Not only did she land a spot on the
Belleville West squad, she ended up lead
ing the team to two Illinois state titles
and a No. 2 national ranking her senior
year. She was named the High School
Player of the Year by USA Today and
twice earned the honor of Illinois State
Player of the Year.
'She's got all the ability in
the world. Not just physi
cal ability, but mental
capability too. Once she
learns to really focus as
she needs to, she's going
to become a tremendous
player.'

Triefenbach got her first taste of
international competition the summer
before her junior year of high school. She
earned a spot on the U.S. Elite Junior
Team which won first place in the Junior
Olympic tournament in Canada.
This past summer she broadened her
scope, traveling to Germany on the
National "B" Team along with teammate
Anne Wicks. After training in San Diego
for two weeks, the squad faced both the
German Junior and Senior national
teams.
"Overall, it was a good experience,"
Triefenbach said. "But it did have its ups
and downs, mainly because we were
playing for eight hours a day, every day,
for a month — it was pretty intense."
During the Stanford volleyball sea
son, the players are expected to practice
and compete with much the same inten
sity level. While Triefenbach's determi
nation to improve is one source of moti
vation, she is also spurred on by her

teammates.
"Off the court we're all great friends,"
Triefenbach said. "I think a lot of that
friendship carries onto the court. There
is a lot of competition out there, but it
never gets to a stage where it's so hard
core competitive that people are snap
ping at each other, or just focusing on
themselves. Everyone works for the ben
efit of the team."
While a certain amount of competi
tion among players is inevitable on any
team, playing as the defending national
champion can definitely add extra ten
sion. Triefenbach cited Shaw, together
with assistant coaches Denise Corlett
and Kim Oden, as the force responsible
for alleviating this pressure.
"The coaches really help us focus on
one game at a time one play at a time,"
Triefenbach said. "They don't put any
pressure on us like, hey, you guys are the
national championship defenders, you
should be out there playing like it."
Although Triefenbach tries not to let
these outside expectations effect her, she
maintains a constant awareness of her
position as a Stanford athlete, a role she
takes very seriously.
"Kim Oden was telling us one time
that it's hard to imagine not having
this," Triefenbach said. "It's like a gift
that you have, to be an athlete and to
play at this level, to have that desire to
be competitive. She was always telling us
to make sure you take advantage of what
you have now, and go hard all the time
because some time it might not be there
again. I think about that a lot, it really
fired me up."
After her Stanford career, Triefen
bach hopes to continue playing volley
ball, possibly on the National Team or on
the beach circuit. "It basically depends
on me, and how hard I'm willing to
work," she said. Even if she chooses to
pursue a future in volleyball, Triefen
bach also hopes to eventually attend den
tal school.
For now, Triefenbach will concentrate
on the task at hand —improving her hit
ting game in hopes of returning to the
NCAA Final Four in December and
boosting the team in its shot at second
national title. Both Shaw and Triefen

bach know that experience will only
