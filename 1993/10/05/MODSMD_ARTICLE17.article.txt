# A
						few words of warning for would-be intramural referees
## 
### 
Alex, a freshman in my dorm, told me she
wanted to referee intramural football. "I
don't know anything about football," she said.
"I just like the idea of getting out there and being a
ref."
I just like the idea of being a ref.
Alex, I don't know if I admire your bravery or pity
your naivete, but I definitely fear for your physical
and mental well-being.
It is not healthy to like the idea of being a ref. Ref
erees have no friends. They are born to be hated.
It is especially unhealthy to want to be an IM ref,
to subject one's self to abuse from athletes who in
many cases aren't even all that athletic.
But what could be worse than being an IM ref at
Stanford, an object of ridicule for bad athletes who
think they know more than you do about the game
you officiate?
Maybe I'm a bit too harsh â€” I've never been an
IM official myself. But let me tell you, Alex, the
world of intramural football at Stanford is a differ
ent world indeed. Personalities are transformed and
primal instincts emerge on those six football fields
down by El Camino Real. There are several factors
to consider before accepting your striped jersey and
whistle.
For one, there's the dedicated IM'er. "Interest
in intramural football has declined sharply over the
past few years," says veteran ref Gabe Lucas. You
wouldn't have been able to guess that from the looks

of Ford Center last Wednesday night. By 1 a.m., 40
hardy souls had gathered by the doors of the intra
mural office to secure their dorm/frat/department a
good time slot in football, volleyball or inner-tube
water polo. By the time the IM directors began reg
istering teams at 8 a.m., the number of those wait
ing had swelled to over 100.
That's right, Alex,

people sleep on the
ground all night for a
good time slot. We're
talking about the differ
ence between playing
football at 3 p.m. and 4
p.m. on Friday. And
sure, many of those out
side Ford were frosh fol
lowing the orders of an
overzealous, dictatorial

RA. But many of them weren't, which brings us to . .
the overdedicated IM'er. There's a fine line
between having fun out there and taking things too
seriously, and many competitors don't know where
that line lies. If you know how many catches and
receiving yards you picked up in your last game, you
might fit into this category. If you're on a first-name
basis with referees in your league, you probably fit
into this category. If you're doing your senior honors
thesis on Howie Dallmar, you definitely fit into this

category. (If you have no idea who Howie Dallmar is,
you're OK).
The psychopathic IM'er. Whole teams can fall
prey to intramural hysteria. These squads, which
annually sprout up under names such as "Domina
tor" and "Biz" (do they really take classes at the
Business School?), are perennial powerhouses.
They've also forgotten somewhere along the way
that intramurals are supposed to be fun. Their quar
terbacks call audibles that Bill Walsh himself
couldn't understand. Even their fans are somber.
Remember, Alex, teams wearing matching IM t
shirts are cute and fun-loving. Teams wearing
matching headbands, athletic shorts and cleats are
dangerous.
The complainers. The intramural handbook
boldly states, "It is hoped that many of the thou
sands of Stanford students and staff participants
will ... be tolerant with the conscientious and dedi
cated young officials."
It is also hoped that Clinton will balance the bud
get, that "Cheers" will return to NBC and that our
men's basketball team will win the Pacific 10 Con
ference title. Sorry, Alex, but none of these things
will happen.
Nowhere is this more evident than on the grid
iron. People complain they were or weren't touched
(IM football is two-hand touch). Defenders complain
about holding by offensive linemen, who themselves
complain that the defense was offsides. And if dis

crepancies in these, the most basic football rules,
aren't enough to discourage you, Alex, there's . . .
the "special" rules. When the ball is snapped,
three of seven offensive players must be positioned
no less than one yard from the line of scrimmage.
The center and two people closest to the ball must
remain on the line of scrimmage, but everyone else
can go into motion, simultaneously if they desire.
The defense cannot move until the ball is snapped.
However, the offense is penalized if it attempts to
trick the defense into moving before the snap. Line
men can block with their hands open, their palms
extended outwards and their elbows no more than
shoulder width apart. However, if the lineman cross
es the line of scrimmage, he or she cannot block at
all.
The defense cannot cross the line of scrimmage on
a kick, unless the offense attempts a kick on the sly,
in which case the defense can charge the kicker. . .
but if the defense hits the kicker, it is penalized.
Unless, of course, co-ed rules are in effect, in which
case the kicking team could be penalized if (a) the
kicker were male, (b) no female had touched the ball
on the previous play and (c) the previous play was not
an incomplete pass.
Intramurals are fun, and I have a lot of respect for
the referees who make them possible. But Alex,
before you're trapped by thoughts of an easy $6.60
an hour, be sure you know what you 're stepping into.
Maybe hashing at Wilbur isn't so bad after all.
