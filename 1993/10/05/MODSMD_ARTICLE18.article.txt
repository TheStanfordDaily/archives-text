# Athletes of the Week

### 
The Daily's Athletes of the Week â€” Leader
ship. Statistically, this quality is immeasur
able, but a team without a leader is like a boat
without a rudder. It floats, but is without direc
tion.
Steve Stenstrom and Sarah Hallock, this
week's Athletes of the Week, are both major
generators of this uncountable trait. By shin
ing individually in defeat as well as in victory,
these two seniors are role models for their

young and inexperienced teams.
Steve Stenstrom is no stranger to this box.
Starting his third year at quarterback for Stan
ford, Stenstrom has had enough sterling
games to make him a preseason Heisman tro
phy candidate. This year the senior from El
Toro, Calif., has put together a string of four
games in which he has thrown for more than
300 yards. In last Saturday's loss to Notre
Dame, Stenstrom set career highs for both
completions, with 34, and attempts, with 46.
He is currently ranked 15th nationally in pass
ing efficiency and 11th in the nation in total
offense.
More impressive statistics are generated if
you project Stenstrom's numbers from the
first five games through an 11-game season. If
the quarterback continues at his present pace,
he will break six Cardinal single-season pass
ing records, four of which are held by John
Elway.
In his three seasons of play, Stenstrom cur
rently ranks fifth in most major career passing
statistics. He does have one year of eligibility
left afler the season is complete.

A Cardinal field hockey fan should be famil
iar with this call: "Forward Sarah Hallock
shoots ard scores!" In fact, of the team's 18
total goals scored last year, Hallock was
responsible for 12. In doing so, the senior from
San Diego garnered All-American honors.

This year Hallock, one of the team's three
captains, already has 11 goals, including a hat

trick against University of the Pacific on Sat
urday.
In the spring, Hallock trades in her hockey
stick for golf clubs. She walked on to the team
her sophomore year and made an immediate
impact. Although this year is her last on the
field hockey field, she has two years of golf eli
gibility left, giving Cardinal fans an extra year
to watch this outstanding, multi-talented ath
lete perform.
