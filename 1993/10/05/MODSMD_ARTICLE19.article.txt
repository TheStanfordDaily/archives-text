The Stanford field hockey team,
after a crushing overtime loss to
California on Friday, destroyed the
University of Pacific for the third
time this year Saturday afternoon.
A hat trick by All-American Sarah
Hallock led the Cardinal to a 4-0
win.
Despite the lopsided score, Pacif
ic came out fighting. The Tigers
dominated in the early going with
ball control and tough defense, but
freshman goalie Kory Taylor's dra
matic saves kept the game score
less.
Forward Susan Fish man then
led a Stanford charge downfield, a
drive which resulted in a short cor
ner (like a corner kick in soccer).
Then, off a great pass by Danielle
Bey net, Stanford's leading scorer,
Hallock, slapped a shot past the
helpless Tiger goalie.
But Pacific was not discouraged.
Immediately after the goal, Wendy
Dushane drove the ball upfield,
drew two defenders and dumped
the ball off to an open Michele
Baker, who scored easily. However,
the play was called back because of
an offside penalty.
Afler a few crisp passes, Pacific
again put the ball in the net, only to

have it called back once more
because another player was off
sides. The squad was beating Stan
ford to every ball, passing well and
getting good shots, but after a well
played first half they found them
selves losing to a sluggish Cardinal.
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
did not have much to say during
halflime. "We were really slow and
flatfooted out there. They were beat
ing us to a lot of balls. I told them to
try to keep possession and try to con
trol the game," said Johnson.
The second half was a complete
ly different story as the Cardinal
picked up their defensive intensity
and created several scoring oppor
tunities.
Hallock attributed the Cardi
nal's second-half turnaround to
more spirited play. "We were fired
up after losing to Cal. We knew we
had to get psyched (in the second
half)."
Goalie lay lor agreed, "It was
time for us to get mad and start
winning some games."
The few mistakes the Cardinal
made in the second half were reme
died by senior defender Markley
Bavinger, who stepped up at all the
right moments to break up numer
ous fast breaks and preserve the
shutout.
