Choosing Stanford
Prefacing the announcement
with remarks about the need for
more government investment in
California, Clinton couched the B
factory decision in terms of the Uni
versity's location in California, a
state that is of great political conse
quence to him.
"It is clear to me that the econo
my of this nation cannot recover
unless the economy of this state
recovers," he said. "There is a lot of
genius in California that has been
inadequately used today. If nur
tured, it will help to bring about not
only an economic turnaround for
California, but for the entire
nation."
Legislators attending the press
conference applauded the decision
in terms of its impact on California.
"It is of such importance
[because of] the linkage to Silicon
Valley," said Rep. Anna Eshoo,
whose district includes Stanford.
"It is of enormous significance
scientifically, but also economi
cally for California."
Casper called the decision
mutually beneficial. "Anything
that benefits Stanford will neces
sarily benefit California as well.
And I think it is a happy coinci
dence Stanford is ... in Califor
nia," he said.
While SLAC's California loca
tion tilted the scales in Stanford's
favor, Clinton acknowledged
SLAC's scientific work and its
lobbying efforts after the press
conference.
"You won it fair and square,"
he said to Casper. "You want to
thank all your members of
Congress."
Bidding for the project
The decision was a hard

earned victory for SLAC, which
has championed the construction
of the B factory for four years.
Working with lawmakers
including Sen. Diane Feinstein,
Sen. Barbara Boxer, Rep. Nor
man Mineta and Eshoo, the cen
ter has been pushing the adminis
tration to choose Stanford over
competitors such as Cornell's Wil
son Laboratory of Nuclear Stud
ies, which submitted a proposal
estimated to be $80 million less
than Stanford's bid.
"Five minutes after I was
sworn in, I started working on it
and I haven't stopped since,"

'What we have done
is remind everybody
that this project was
very important and
excellent physics.'
— Gerhard Casper

Eshoo said. "We've been working
on it every single day."
The first hurdle for Stanford
and local lawmakers was convinc
ing the government to fund a B
factory, no matter where it would
ultimately be located. Once that
was accomplished, the next step
was to convince the government
that the project should be awarded
to Stanford.
Casper said that the most
important move for the University
was to keep reminding decision
makers of the results of a peer
review judgment which concluded
that the government should sup
port the project.

"What we have done is remind

everybody along the way ... that
at the peer review, this project —
the B factory — was considered to
be very important and very excel
lent physics," he said.
Other persuasive moves includ
ed talks with Clinton about the
importance of keeping the country
at the forefront of basic research.
Despite the higher cost of
SLAC's proposal, other factors
besides its California location
worked in its favor. Michael Rior
dan, Richter's assistant, said in an
interview last year that the adminis
tration would be more likely to
choose SLAC over the Cornell lab
because SLAC is run through the
University by the Department of
Energy. The Cornell lab is operated
by the National Science Foundation.
With nearly 1,400 employees,
SLAC's larger size — Cornell's
staff numbers only 170 — also
played in its favor
Putting it all together
In June budget discussions, the
House of Representatives
approved $36 million in B-factory
funding for 1994, but final appro
priations must still be worked out
in a conference committee.
The rest of the $237 million will
be spread out over the next three
years, in $45 million yearly pay
ments.
The collider itself will cost an
estimated $170 million. An addi
tional $60 million will build a new
particle detector, which will be
funded both by SLAC's detector
fund and an international fund.
The funding for the detector is not
yet certain, Richter said.
SLAC will collaborate on the
project with the Lawrence Berke
ley Laboratory and the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory,
which are also Department of
Energy laboratories.

If Congress approves the fund
ing, the project should be complet
ed in five years, and be usable by
1998, according to Physics Prof.
Johnathan Dorfman, the project's
director.
The massive project has not yet
been completely planned out.
"We'll start putting together the
total picture by the end of the sec
ond year," he said.
A relief for workers
If SLAC had not won the bid, it
was likely that 200 to 300 employees
would have been laid off during the
next three to five years. Clinton's
1994 budget sliced SLAC's annual
$138 million budget by 11 percent.
"[The funding] gives us justifi

cation to keep employment level
(the same) through the year
2000," Riordan said.
He said SLAC will also be
increasing the number of contract
ed employees by 100.
SLAC employees who heard the
news yesterday all breathed a col
lective sigh of relief.
"We've done a lot of hard work
and it's paid off for the whole com
munity. Thank God," said Jamie
Davis, SLAC fabrications special
ist. The pending decision "was tax
ing our minds. We worked long
and hard to get this. ... I am
extremely happy."
Roger Miller, a professor of
accelerator theory at SLAC, said
the news was "definitely an

upper."
"Certainly over the past few
years there have been a lot of prob
lems. . . . and morale has been
quite low," he said. But, "over the
short term, at least the people I
have talked to are in high spirits
now."
The grant is good news for the
Physics Department too, said
department Chair Steve Chu. "If
SLAC does well, we (the depart
ment) do well."
Overall, "we kept our faith,"
said Robert Moore, mechanical
technician at SLAC.

SLAC will undergo several modifications under the $237 proposal to turn the existing facility into an
asymmetric B factory.
