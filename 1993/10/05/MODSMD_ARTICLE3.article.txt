# Project to answer questions about how universe formed

Why does the universe exist?
The asymmetric B factory, the $237 mil
lion collider project slated for construction
at SLAC, is in large part an effort to answer
this question.
A fraction of a second after the Big Bang,
matter and antimatter existed in equal
quantities.
All things being equal, every particle of
matter should have found a corresponding
antiparticle — protons with antiprotons,
electrons with positrons. Since matter and
antimatter destroy each other in collisions,
the bulk of material in the universe should
have simply annihilated itself.
But all things were not equal. A stable,
matter-dominated universe evolved from
the cosmic fire of the Big Bang. Roughly 10
billion years later, certain issues still have
physicists confused.
In a collider, beams of charged particles
— in this case, electrons and their antiparti-

cles, positrons — are accelerated to high ve
locities. Where the beams intersect, colli
sions take place, and new particles are creat
ed from the energy released.
The B factory will consist of a new beam
storage ring, to be built in the circular tunnel
which currently houses SLAC's Positron
Electron Project storage ring. Also planned
is a new detector, which is required to ob
serve the rapid, high-energy collisions.
When the B factory is in operation,
positrons will circulate in the new ring while
electrons circulate at even higher energies in
the older ring. At the intersection of the
beams, electrons and positrons will collide
and form particles known as "B mesons."
B mesons are short-lived, and decay
rapidly into more stable particles. Physicists
will make measurements of the B particles'
decays; the data they collect may answer
fundamental questions about why the uni
verse evolved the way it did.
According to the Standard Model, physi-
