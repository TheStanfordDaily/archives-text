# Project to answer questions about how universe formed

Why does the universe exist?
The asymmetric B factory, the $237 mil
lion collider project slated for construction
at SLAC, is in large part an effort to answer
this question.
A fraction of a second after the Big Bang,
matter and antimatter existed in equal
quantities.
All things being equal, every particle of
matter should have found a corresponding
antiparticle — protons with antiprotons,
electrons with positrons. Since matter and
antimatter destroy each other in collisions,
the bulk of material in the universe should
have simply annihilated itself.
But all things were not equal. A stable,
matter-dominated universe evolved from
the cosmic fire of the Big Bang. Roughly 10
billion years later, certain issues still have
physicists confused.
In a collider, beams of charged particles
— in this case, electrons and their antiparti-

cles, positrons — are accelerated to high ve
locities. Where the beams intersect, colli
sions take place, and new particles are creat
ed from the energy released.
The B factory will consist of a new beam
storage ring, to be built in the circular tunnel
which currently houses SLAC's Positron
Electron Project storage ring. Also planned
is a new detector, which is required to ob
serve the rapid, high-energy collisions.
When the B factory is in operation,
positrons will circulate in the new ring while
electrons circulate at even higher energies in
the older ring. At the intersection of the
beams, electrons and positrons will collide
and form particles known as "B mesons."
B mesons are short-lived, and decay
rapidly into more stable particles. Physicists
will make measurements of the B particles'
decays; the data they collect may answer
fundamental questions about why the uni
verse evolved the way it did.
According to the Standard Model, physi-
cists' working picture of matter
and forces, most subatomic pro
cesses conserve something called
"CP" — a combination of charge
and parity. Charge distinguishes a
particle from its antiparticle, pari
ty distinguishes a particle from its
mirror image.
To say that a process conserves
CP is to say that if one were to sub
stitute matter for antimatter and
observe the process in a mirror, it
would look exactly the same.

Physicists believed that CP was
always conserved, until 1964,
when experiments leading to a
Nobel Prize showed that the decay
of unstable particles known as "K
mesons" violated CP symmetry.
Because subatomic processes
that violate CP conservation treat
matter and antimatter differently,
such phenomena may be responsi
ble for the dominance of matter
over antimatter in the universe.
The Standard Model for some
CP asymmetry, but physicists
believe it isn't enough to explain
the dramatic observed bias in
favor of matter.
The Standard Model predicts

that CP violation should be especial
ly striking in the decay of B mesons.
By studying B particle
closely, scientists may be able to
understand why the universe
doesn't reflect Standard Model pre
dictions, and eventually deduce why
the cosmos is dominated by matter.
To make significant inroads into
these issues, however, physicists
must observe large numbers of B
meson decays. Currently, no collid
er exists that is able to produce
even a small fraction of the
required number of B particles.
The SLAC B factory will fill this
need and allow measurements of
CP violation in B meson decay.
