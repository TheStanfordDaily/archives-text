# Toyon's Terrace thrives
## Student-run eatery boon for night owls 
### Eliza Patten 
There may be only a handful
of late-night eateries on cam
pus, but the managers of the
new Terrace Cafe aren't com
plaining.
The primarily student-run
cafe at Toyon Eating Clubs is
thriving off the limited late
night options available to hun
gry Stanford students.
Open from 10 a.m. to 1 a.m.,
the cafe serves smoothies,
frozen yogurt, baked goods, cof
fee and sandwiches, offering
students an alternative to Food
Service's late-night menu at
Stern Hall, where the big draw
is pizza.
The cafe started up this fall,
funded by a small reserve from
the Toyon Eating Clubs which
owns the operation. It occupies
the site of the former El Tigre
Eating Club.
Jen Smith and Tracy Kim,
1993 graduates, joined with ju
i

nior Toyon residents Nick
Mang and Kibo Kitahama last
year as division managers of
the cafe. The eatery is managed
by Matt Pozos, general manag
er of Toyon Eating Clubs.
Smith and Kim formerly
managed El Cuadro, one of
Toyon's three primarily under
graduate eating clubs, when
Pozos suggested opening a
frozen yogurt shop on campus.
Last year, Mang and Kita
hama "were always mixing
smoothies and perfecting their
recipes," Smith said. "We knew
they were thinking of doing
something entrepreneurial."
"In New Orleans, they have
a lot of smoothie shops," Kita
hama said. "I invited Nick
down to visit; we had a few and
thought they'd be very popular
in California. We agreed that
college is a good place to experi
ment."
