# Hoover experts give Yeltsin mixed reviews
## Despite victory over hard-liners, Russian president faces uphill battle

News of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's defeat of hard-line
resistance met with mixed feelings
from Russian experts at the
Hoover Institution as they closely
monitored yesterday's latest de
velopments.
The future of Yeltsin's democ
ratic reforms seemed hazy amid
the dissension in Moscow, but the
elimination of the reforms'
strongest opponents, according to
some Hoover scholars, bodes well
for the future.

Research Fellow Mike McFaul
said he is hopeful that the con
flict's resolution might pave the
road to free elections.
Although McFaul said his first
reaction to the violence was that
"it's a national tragedy," he specu
lated that in a best-case scenario,
"a new parliament [will] come into
place, followed by . . . the embryo
of democracy in Russia."
Yesterday morning in Moscow,
Yeltsin's troops crushed a band of
resistance from armed hardlin
ers, leaving hundreds dead and
constituting the bloodiest upris

ing in Moscow since the 1917 Bol
shevik Revolution. The leaders
opposed to Yeltsin — Parliamen
tary Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov
and Vice President Alexander
Rutskoi — surrendered to
Yeltsin's troops.
"Obviously, Yeltsin has won
and really won big. Khasbulatov
and Rutskoi have been detained,"
said Hoover Senior Fellow Richard
Staar. "I think he acted very deci
sively. From now on, the future
looks pretty good for him."
Despite the rebellion, popular
support for Yeltsin remains strong

in Russia, according to Hoover Se
nior Fellow John Dunlop, who
cited as evidence Yeltsin's ability
to keep almost all of the Russian
provinces and most of the army in
line.
"That's a pretty impressive
achievement," Dunlop said.
However, not everyone at
Hoover was as optimistic about
Russia's future. Senior Hoover
Fellow Bruce Buena de Mesquita
said Yeltsin is "facing a very uphill
battle."
Whether Yeltsin will be able to
hold together an under-supplied
army, control inflation, prevent
outlying provinces from seceding,
and pass democratic reforms in
the new parliament remains to be
seen.
Although Yeltsin's victory by
no means assures his re-elec
tion, some Hoover fellows
agreed that the last two weeks'
events will help, not hurt, the
president.
Elections for a new Russian
parliament have been set for Dec.
11 and 12, with a presidential elec
tion to follow in 1994.
Senior Research Fellow Robert
Conquest said he doubts there will
be much backlash among the Rus
sian people to Yeltsin's decision to
use force. "It was an armed rebel
lion. How else do you expect him

to put it down?" he said.
McFaul acknowledged that
Yeltsin will enjoy certain divi
dends by acting decisively, but in
contrast to Conquest's view, he
said, "Any leader who uses force
against his own people ... that's a
very hard thing to do and main
tain popularity."
In the days to come, individual
Russian provinces declaring inde
pendence would pose a threat to
Yeltsin's power, some Hoover fel
lows say.
Staar said that the farther one
moves from Moscow, the fewer
loyalties the people have to the
Russian nation. "If it does come to
fruition that these provinces are
able to break away, then you have
a Russia that's a fraction of its for
mer size," he said.
But the true provincial threat
may be lessened by Yeltsin's con
vincing victory, said Buena de
Mesquita. "I see [provincial lead
ers taking power] as a possibility
but not a likelihood."
