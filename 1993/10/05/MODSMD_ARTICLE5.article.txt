# Hoover experts give Yeltsin mixed reviews
## Despite victory over hard-liners, Russian president faces uphill battle

Boris Yeltsin's defeat of hard-line
resistance met with mixed feelings
from Russian experts at the
Hoover Institution as they closely
monitored yesterday's latest de
velopments.
The future of Yeltsin's democ
ratic reforms seemed hazy amid
the dissension in Moscow, but the
elimination of the reforms'
strongest opponents, according to
some Hoover scholars, bodes well
for the future.

Research Fellow Mike McFaul
said he is hopeful that the con
flict's resolution might pave the
road to free elections.
Although McFaul said his first
reaction to the violence was that
"it's a national tragedy," he specu
lated that in a best-case scenario,
"a new parliament [will] come into
place, followed by . . . the embryo
of democracy in Russia."
Yesterday morning in Moscow,
Yeltsin's troops crushed a band of
resistance from armed hardlin
ers, leaving hundreds dead and
constituting the bloodiest upris

ing in Moscow since the 1917 Bol
shevik Revolution. The leaders
opposed to Yeltsin — Parliamen
tary Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov
and Vice President Alexander
Rutskoi — surrendered to
Yeltsin's troops.
"Obviously, Yeltsin has won
and really won big. Khasbulatov
and Rutskoi have been detained,"
said Hoover Senior Fellow Richard
Staar. "I think he acted very deci
sively. From now on, the future
looks pretty good for him."
Despite the rebellion, popular
support for Yeltsin remains strong

in Russia, according to Hoover Se
nior Fellow John Dunlop, who
cited as evidence Yeltsin's ability
to keep almost all of the Russian
provinces and most of the army in
line.
"That's a pretty impressive
achievement," Dunlop said.
However, not everyone at
Hoover was as optimistic about
Russia's future. Senior Hoover
Fellow Bruce Buena de Mesquita
said Yeltsin is "facing a very uphill
battle."
