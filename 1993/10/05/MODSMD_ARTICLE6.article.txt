# Summer of Service elicits praise, criticism
## 
### Johnathon Briggs Staff writer 
While Stanford community members who
participated in President Clinton's Summer of
Service program expressed concerns about its
focus, recruitment and training, they lauded
the project as a valuable learning experience.
Haas Center for Public Service program co
ordinator Sue Gray said the service program
was problematic in some ways because it did
not adequately address the needs of those par
ticipants who joined to help serve their own

community, and because the financial compen
sation was not sufficient for some students.
Gray, the Summer of Service director for
Haas, coordinated service programs in the
East Palo Alto area.
This summer the Haas Center joined with
the East Bay Conservation Corps in Oakland,
UC-Berkeley and other local groups to form
the largest of 16 nationwide federally funded
pilot programs in the Summer of Service. The
Bay Area program employed 250 students,
aged 17 to 25, and focused on education and tu
toring.

The Haas Center coordinated efforts in the
East Palo Alto area for 34 students, about one
third to one-fourth of whom were Stanford
students, said Gray.
Clinton's service program was established
earlier this year to provide money to college
students, help offset the rising costs of college
tuition and involve more young people in com
munity service. Participants in the program
earned minimum wage plus a $1,000 stipend
for educational expenses.
Gray said Haas has not yet
decided if it will continue Stan
ford involvement with the Sum
mer of Service. "At this point I
don't think we will be. We need to
continue to do what we're already
doing."
For program participant and
coterminal student Stacey
Blankenbaker, Clinton's Summer
of Service program was a success,
although she had problems with
training and recruitment aspects
of the program.
One issue of concern to pro
gram participants was the pro
gram's selection process, and
which groups and communities
were represented, Blankenbaker

said. While each agency and
group represented had different
recruitment methods, some stu
dents in the program felt it
should have been more diverse
and included people from the
communities being served as well,
she said.
"The service movement has
always been looked at as white
middle-class college students,"
she said. But in the program, "it
was a very different picture."
"The whole curriculum and
training was based on people who
were outside of the community,"
she said.
Gray also said that "tools on
how to affect social change" were
missing from the program. "The
program supposedly is about
change, but without skills on how
to do so, what we will continue to
do is to put Band-Aids on open

sores," she said.
However, Blankenbaker said
the program's problems were
more or less limited to its first
week training camp.
Senior Brita Lombardi, who
also participated in the program,
agreed, adding that the national
training camp seemed to be
"media hype," which detracted
from its true purpose of teaching
important service-oriented skills.
She said the planned shift to
regional training camps should
remedy that problem next year,
when the national service plan is
fully implemented.
Blankenbaker said she "got a
lot out" of the service program.
She worked in East Palo Alto
with a summer school program
in the Ravenswood School Dis
trict.
"It was one of the best things

I've ever done," she said. "I
wouldn't change any of it."
Other participants at Haas
worked at six East Palo Alto non
profit agencies, including the
Consortium for Young Women,
the Shule Mandela Academy and
the Center for a New Genera
tion.
Gray also expressed concern
that the program, with its mini
mum-wage compensation, was
geared toward middle-income
families. She said others who
need still more money for college
won't be able to participate.
Blankenbaker said her earn
ings and stipend from the Sum
mer of Service program helped
her pay her University bill this
quarter, and that she can use the
money toward her student loans
or graduate school expenses as
well.
