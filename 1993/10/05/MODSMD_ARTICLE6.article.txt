# Summer of Service elicits praise, criticism

While Stanford community members who
participated in President Clinton's Summer of
Service program expressed concerns about its
focus, recruitment and training, they lauded
the project as a valuable learning experience.
Haas Center for Public Service program co
ordinator Sue Gray said the service program
was problematic in some ways because it did
not adequately address the needs of those par
ticipants who joined to help serve their own

community, and because the financial compen
sation was not sufficient for some students.
Gray, the Summer of Service director for
Haas, coordinated service programs in the
East Palo Alto area.
This summer the Haas Center joined with
the East Bay Conservation Corps in Oakland,
UC-Berkeley and other local groups to form
the largest of 16 nationwide federally funded
pilot programs in the Summer of Service. The
Bay Area program employed 250 students,
aged 17 to 25, and focused on education and tu
toring.

The Haas Center coordinated efforts in the
East Palo Alto area for 34 students, about one
third to one-fourth of whom were Stanford
students, said Gray.
Clinton's service program was established
earlier this year to provide money to college
students, help offset the rising costs of college
tuition and involve more young people in com
munity service. Participants in the program
earned minimum wage plus a $1,000 stipend
for educational expenses.
