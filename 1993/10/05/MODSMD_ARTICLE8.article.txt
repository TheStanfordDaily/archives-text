## More U.S. soldiers dead, hurt in Somalia fighting 
### 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) â€” Supporters
of a Somali warlord dragged the body of
an American soldier through the streets of
Mogadishu yesterday, where at least 12
Americans were reported killed in the
recent round of fighting.
Pentagon officials, meanwhile, said "a
small number" of U.S. Army Rangers
were missing in Somalia and may have
been taken hostage or killed in the latest
phase of a U.N. operation against warlord
Mohamed Farrah Aidid.
In light of the American casualties and
possible American hostages, Washington
was preparing to send about 200 infantry
men, tanks and armored vehicles to
Mogadishu, Pentagon officials told The

Associated Press. Other news reports said
about seven Rangers had been captured.
Two other Pentagon officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said initial
reports indicate at least 12 U.S. soldiers
had been killed in Mogadishu since Sun
day and 75 had been wounded.
The soldier dragged through the
streets of the Somali capital today was one
of five Americans who died Sunday in the
first day of the U.N. assault on
Aidid's military command. It was not
immediately clear whether the five were
aboard two U.S. Blackhawk helicopters
shot down in the U.N. search for Aidid's
key lieutenants or killed in a subsequent
gunbattle.
