# Yeltsin ousts hard-line holdouts

### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin won
a bloody victory in the battle for Rus
sia's future yesterday, his tanks and
paratroopers flushing his hard-line
opponents from a flaming Russian par
liament building. Scores died as Yeltsin
crushed the strongest power bid yet by
remnants of the old Communist regime.
The mass surrender of lawmakers
and their armed supporters seemed like
ly to allow Yeltsin to move ahead with
plans to elect a new parliament in
December and pursue long-frustrated
economic reforms. But he still faced
daunting challenges in his effort to
transform Russia's economy and soci
ety.
Parliament leaders gave up after
1,000 soldiers raked the white marble
parliament relentlessly with fire from T
-72 tank cannons and heavy machine
guns, but at least some holdouts
remained at large.
The search for holdouts was difficult
because the 19-story parliament build
ing is an often-confusing labyrinth of
twisting corridors and hidden rooms.
After nightfall, red and green tracer
bullets streaked across the sky as flames
shot up the sides of the parliament,

known as the White House. Armored
vehicles and heavy trucks rumbled
through the city, and Muscovites rushed
home to beat a new military curfew.
Early today, firefighters began trying
to douse the flames, braving sniper fire
from within the White House and near
by buildings.
Sniper fire was reported in a wide
area of Moscow early Tuesday. ITAR-
Tass news agency reported that its
offices came under heavy fire, but there
were no injuries. It said 200 to 300
armed hard-liners remained in central
Moscow.
The storming of the White House
broke hard-line opposition in parlia
ment, but many people harbor deep
resentment against the soaring prices
and other painful changes under
Yeltsin's reforms. The attack also could
make martyrs of his opponents.
President Clinton and other Western
leaders were quick to support Yeltsin,
but they can be expected to closely
watch how he treats his foes in the com
ing days and weeks.
Parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbu
latov, Vice President Alexander Rutskoi
and other leaders of the two-week occu

pation of the White House were taken
from parliament to the high-security
Lefortovo Prison.
Yeltsin spent yesterday closeted with
his closest aides in the Kremlin, where
he had remained overnight since rush
ing there by helicopter during Sunday's
street fighting. Late yesterday, he
returned to his country dacha.
He struck back just after dawn yes
terday with the assault on the parlia
ment building.
"All that was and still is going on in
Moscow — was an armed revolt planned
in advance," he said on nationwide tele
vision, explaining the attack while it was
still raging.
"It was organized by Communists
seeking revenge, by fascist leaders and
some of the former lawmakers . . . .
There cam be no forgiveness, because
they lifted their hand against peaceful
people" in Sunday's rioting, he added.
Authorities had no firm figures on
casualties from the 10-hour battle at the
White House, but soldiers stacked
dozens of bodies outside the building.
Russian television reported that Sun
day's battle at the TV complex alone left
62 dead and 400 wounded.
