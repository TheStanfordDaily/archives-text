ASSU Fee Refunds
are currently available for
registered Stanford students.
To use the
UNIX fee refund system, you must have
a Leland or Cardinal account. To get an
account, go to either the Tresidder or Meyer
Computer Clusters, or the 2nd floor of Sweet
Hall, and ask the consultants to help you if the
directions there are not clear.
Further Instructions: To request your fee
refunds, log on to Cardinal, any elaine (Sparc
station), any rs station, or any adelbert (DEC
station). Then, at the prompt, type:
feerefund
That should put you into the Fee Refund
Program! However, if it does not work, at the
prompt, type:
/afs/i r/g ro u p/assu/bi n/sta rtq u es
Deadline to request fee refunds is
October 20. NO exceptions!
For any questions, contact Tom Tsao, Fee Refund
Coordinator, via email: ttsao<s)tresidder J
