# Deficits force look at additional cuts, restructuring plan
## Rice to lead expense-trimming effort 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
A few days after hinting at
plans for further budget cuts
and restructuring, Provost
Condoleezza Rice in an inter
view Monday outlined in broad
terms the process which she
hopes will prepare the Univer
sity for the 21st century.
Saying that there are not yet
any specific numbers, details or
timelines, Rice discussed her
plans on how the University
will go about restructuring the
administration and ensuring
long-term financial stability
while finding a way to manage

next year's budget deficit, pro
jected to exceed $15 million.
"There is not as much poten
tial for an upside on the rev
enue side," Rice said, adding
that it is up to the University to
find ways to better utilize the
resources it already has.
The University, she said,
now has to contend with two fi
nancial problems: dealing with
next year's higher-than-expect
ed deficit and finding a way to
ensure that these deficits do not
continue in the future.
University President Ger
hard Casper said yesterday that
these steps must be taken in
order for Stanford "to act in the
interest of long-term viability."
Three teams, three plans
Rice's plan, which deals with
the latter of the two problems,
will be overseen by the newly cre
ated Restructuring Steering Com
mittee, which is under the aus
pices of the University Cabinet. It
calls for the creation of three ad
hoc groups to look at three differ
ent ways to reduce costs within
the University.
The first team, the Business
Practices Steering Committee, will
look to re-engineer and streamline
administrative processes. Rice said
this committee will first focus on
the tremendous bureaucracy asso
ciated with the research adminis
tration and on the way procure
ment decisions are made.
The second team, the Adminis
trative Information Systems Core
Team, will be responsible for
looking at ways "to squeeze out
costs and try to increase produc
tivity." Rice said this will mean
asking the vice presidents to real
ly think about their costs while
continuing to produce positive
results.
Rice said the committee will
not look to ask those within the
University to do the same amount
of work with fewer resources, but
will examine which tasks the Uni
versity performs that are truly
productive.

"We have to ask whether we
can do what we do less expensive
ly and bureaucratically," Casper
said.
The final team in the provost's
plan is to look at restructuring
the University and to examine
"whether or not it can continue to
do everything that it has been
doing, or whether or not we might
have to choose to get out of some
things," she said.
While Rice said she hopes the
team responsible for the third
part of the plan — called the Plan
ning/Budgeting/Reporting Pro
ject — gets ideas and feedback
from the Commission on Under
graduate Education, she empha
sized that it will require broad
University discussions.
"We absolutely have to be
ruthless with ourselves in saying
if an activity at Stanford is not
truly excellent, do we really want
to be in that? Or do we have the
resources to make it truly excel
lent? Or should we, perhaps,
think that maybe it's something
Stanford shouldn't do," Rice
said.
While she currently has no
specific programs in mind target
ed for more cuts or elimination,
she did say that to make room for
innovative programs that are
"pressing frontiers, we may have
to take a hard look as a communi
ty at some activities that have
either outlived their usefulness
or just can't be brought back to
life."
Although a specific timeline
has not been set, Rice said she
hopes that these committees can
begin reporting their findings to

the Restructuring Steering Com
mittee by the end of the quarter,
as well as in monthly reports to
the Cabinet, so the administra
tion can "see where we are in
terms of recommendations on the
administrative side of how to
bring down our administrative
costs."

'We absolutely have
to be ruthless with
ourselves In saying if
an activity at Stanford
is not truly excellent,
do we really want to
be in that?'

Adding to $43 million cuts
Rice is following in the foot
steps of her immediate predeces
sors, James Rosse and Gerald
Lieberman, in trying to deal with
an annual deficit. While Rosse
and Lieberman had to work
through Stanford's previous $43
million reduction program, Rice
assumed the burden of a planned
$10-15 million deficit for next
year's budget.
The irony of the situation is
that the $43 million program
caused delays in other costs,
which will end up adding to next
year's deficit. The $10-15 million

deficit "was the administration's
estimate" two years ago for the
1994-95 budget, Rice said.
According to Rice, the admin
istration is "still working to try to
figure out" the exact amount, but
deferred capital and maintenance
costs will create a substantial bur
den on next year's budget.
An additional increase in the
deficit will likely come from
uncertainty about the govern
ment's reimbursement for
research.
The effects of the government's
changes in the Office of Manage
ment and Budget Circular A-21,
which are the guidelines for reim
bursement of the indirect costs
associated with research, are still
trying to be determined. Although
the cap on reimbursements for
administrative costs now stands
at 26 percent, Rice said the admin
istration still has to look at the fig
ures and come up with one that is
"not wildly out of line."
While Rice did say that the
University's previous deficit
reductions paid off, she also con
ceded that it is up to this adminis
tration to "deal with problems we
knew were there but did not
address."
However, she said that because
there is no firm number yet, the
administration does not yet have
a definite plan to deal with the
additional deficit.
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning and a mem
ber of the Restructuring Steering
Committee, said yesterday that as
the group oversees the achieve
ment of long-term financial stabil
ity, it will also look at ways to

address next year's deficit.
But dealing with next year's
problems is a more pressing issue
since the administration has to
submit its proposed budget to the
Board of Trustees in April.
Looking to alums
It is the fact that the deficit has
become a staple of University
operating budgets during the last
few years that spurred Rice to try
to come up with a way to elimi
nate financial uncertainty.
According to Rice, the first step
in fixing the budget is identifying
one of the fundamental problems
within the structure of the Uni
versity's budgets — "we spend
more unrestricted funding than
we take in."
This "basic structural issue"
that the University is facing with
regard to its budget is common
across the country, Cox said.
Rice blames part of the unique
ness of Stanford's problem to the
University's exceptionally low
percentage of alumni who make
annual donations.
Saying that Stanford's statis
tics in this area were "a shock" to
University President Gerhard
Casper, Rice said the University
has to do more to "appeal to alum
ni to help out."
Funds for innovation
Rice said she tends to shy away
from the analogy that a universi
ty is a business, and prefers the
comparison to "a mini-economy ..
. where entrepreneurial ideas"
can flourish.
She believes that a continual
lack of unrestricted funds could

seriously jeopardize Stanford's
academic environment. Rice
points to the fact that this year's
operating budget has set aside
only $2 million to support new
academic programs.
While Rice firmly stated that
she does not want to create u a
strategic plan for Stanford aca
demics," she believes having a
substantial supply of unrestricted
funds is vital to allow any mem
ber of the Stanford community
"to run with a good idea."
Casper concurred: "We have to
find the resources for new innova
tions."
It is through her plan to re
engineer and restructure the Uni
versity that Rice hopes to access
more unrestricted funds. She said
an important first step is to ask
administrators first to think hard
about use of their restricted
funds.
"Trying to bring restricted and
unrestricted funds into a better
balance," is a necessary part of
the process, Rice said.
She said she is not sure yet
where the rest of the money for
more unrestricted funds will come
from — "all is on the table to get
administrative costs down." Pre
vious increases in the administra
tive structure were due to faculty
and student demand, she said.
Rice did say that one of the
main targets are the tremendous
amount of paperwork and systems
that are involved in the day-to-day
processes of the University.
Members of the community
have "to think in terms of 'us,'
and 'us' is the ones that drive aca
demic overhead," she said.

Rice is following in the foot
steps of her immediate predeces
sors, James Rosse and Gerald
Lieberman, in trying to deal with
an annual deficit. While Rosse
and Lieberman had to work
through Stanford's previous $43
million reduction program, Rice
assumed the burden of a planned
$10-15 million deficit for next
year's budget.
The irony of the situation is
that the $43 million program
caused delays in other costs,
which will end up adding to next
year's deficit. The $10-15 million

deficit "was the administration's
estimate" two years ago for the
1994-95 budget, Rice said.
According to Rice, the admin
istration is "still working to try to
figure out" the exact amount, but
deferred capital and maintenance
costs will create a substantial bur
den on next year's budget.
An additional increase in the
deficit will likely come from
uncertainty about the govern
ment's reimbursement for
research.
The effects of the government's
changes in the Office of Manage
ment and Budget Circular A-21,
which are the guidelines for reim
bursement of the indirect costs
associated with research, are still
trying to be determined. Although
the cap on reimbursements for
administrative costs now stands
at 26 percent, Rice said the admin
istration still has to look at the fig
ures and come up with one that is
"not wildly out of line."
While Rice did say that the
University's previous deficit
reductions paid off, she also con
ceded that it is up to this adminis
tration to "deal with problems we
knew were there but did not
address."
However, she said that because
there is no firm number yet, the
administration does not yet have
a definite plan to deal with the
additional deficit.
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning and a mem
ber of the Restructuring Steering
Committee, said yesterday that as
the group oversees the achieve
ment of long-term financial stabil
ity, it will also look at ways to

address next year's deficit.
But dealing with next year's
problems is a more pressing issue
since the administration has to
submit its proposed budget to the
Board of Trustees in April.
Looking to alums
It is the fact that the deficit has
become a staple of University
operating budgets during the last
few years that spurred Rice to try
to come up with a way to elimi
nate financial uncertainty.
According to Rice, the first step
in fixing the budget is identifying
one of the fundamental problems
within the structure of the Uni
versity's budgets — "we spend
more unrestricted funding than
we take in."
This "basic structural issue"
that the University is facing with
regard to its budget is common
across the country, Cox said.
Rice blames part of the unique
ness of Stanford's problem to the
University's exceptionally low
percentage of alumni who make
annual donations.
Saying that Stanford's statis
tics in this area were "a shock" to
University President Gerhard
Casper, Rice said the University
has to do more to "appeal to alum
ni to help out."
Funds for innovation
Rice said she tends to shy away
from the analogy that a universi
ty is a business, and prefers the
comparison to "a mini-economy ..
. where entrepreneurial ideas"
can flourish.
She believes that a continual
lack of unrestricted funds could

seriously jeopardize Stanford's
academic environment. Rice
points to the fact that this year's
operating budget has set aside
only $2 million to support new
academic programs.
While Rice firmly stated that
she does not want to create u a
strategic plan for Stanford aca
demics," she believes having a
substantial supply of unrestricted
funds is vital to allow any mem
ber of the Stanford community
"to run with a good idea."
Casper concurred: "We have to
find the resources for new innova
tions."
It is through her plan to re
engineer and restructure the Uni
versity that Rice hopes to access
more unrestricted funds. She said
an important first step is to ask
administrators first to think hard
about use of their restricted
funds.
"Trying to bring restricted and
unrestricted funds into a better
balance," is a necessary part of
the process, Rice said.
She said she is not sure yet
where the rest of the money for
more unrestricted funds will come
from — "all is on the table to get
administrative costs down." Pre
vious increases in the administra
tive structure were due to faculty
and student demand, she said.
Rice did say that one of the
main targets are the tremendous
amount of paperwork and systems
that are involved in the day-to-day
processes of the University.
Members of the community
have "to think in terms of 'us,'
and 'us' is the ones that drive aca
demic overhead," she said.
A few days after hinting at
plans for further budget cuts
and restructuring, Provost
Condoleezza Rice in an inter
view Monday outlined in broad
terms the process which she
hopes will prepare the Univer
sity for the 21st century.
Saying that there are not yet
any specific numbers, details or
timelines, Rice discussed her
plans on how the University
will go about restructuring the
administration and ensuring
long-term financial stability
while finding a way to manage

next year's budget deficit, pro
jected to exceed $15 million.
"There is not as much poten
tial for an upside on the rev
enue side," Rice said, adding
that it is up to the University to
find ways to better utilize the
resources it already has.
The University, she said,
now has to contend with two fi
nancial problems: dealing with
next year's higher-than-expect
ed deficit and finding a way to
ensure that these deficits do not
continue in the future.
University President Ger
hard Casper said yesterday that
these steps must be taken in
order for Stanford "to act in the
interest of long-term viability."
Three teams, three plans
Rice's plan, which deals with
the latter of the two problems,
will be overseen by the newly cre
ated Restructuring Steering Com
mittee, which is under the aus
pices of the University Cabinet. It
calls for the creation of three ad
hoc groups to look at three differ
ent ways to reduce costs within
the University.
The first team, the Business
Practices Steering Committee, will
look to re-engineer and streamline
administrative processes. Rice said
this committee will first focus on
the tremendous bureaucracy asso
ciated with the research adminis
tration and on the way procure
ment decisions are made.
The second team, the Adminis
trative Information Systems Core
Team, will be responsible for
looking at ways "to squeeze out
costs and try to increase produc
tivity." Rice said this will mean
asking the vice presidents to real
ly think about their costs while
continuing to produce positive
results.
Rice said the committee will
not look to ask those within the
University to do the same amount
of work with fewer resources, but
will examine which tasks the Uni
versity performs that are truly
productive.

"We have to ask whether we
can do what we do less expensive
ly and bureaucratically," Casper
said.
The final team in the provost's
plan is to look at restructuring
the University and to examine
"whether or not it can continue to
do everything that it has been
doing, or whether or not we might
have to choose to get out of some
things," she said.
While Rice said she hopes the
team responsible for the third
part of the plan — called the Plan
ning/Budgeting/Reporting Pro
ject — gets ideas and feedback
from the Commission on Under
graduate Education, she empha
sized that it will require broad
University discussions.
"We absolutely have to be
ruthless with ourselves in saying
if an activity at Stanford is not
truly excellent, do we really want
to be in that? Or do we have the
resources to make it truly excel
lent? Or should we, perhaps,
think that maybe it's something
Stanford shouldn't do," Rice
said.
While she currently has no
specific programs in mind target
ed for more cuts or elimination,
she did say that to make room for
innovative programs that are
"pressing frontiers, we may have
to take a hard look as a communi
ty at some activities that have
either outlived their usefulness
or just can't be brought back to
life."
Although a specific timeline
has not been set, Rice said she
hopes that these committees can
begin reporting their findings to

the Restructuring Steering Com
mittee by the end of the quarter,
as well as in monthly reports to
the Cabinet, so the administra
tion can "see where we are in
terms of recommendations on the
administrative side of how to
bring down our administrative
costs."

where the rest of the money for
more unrestricted funds will come
from — "all is on the table to get
administrative costs down." Pre
vious increases in the administra
tive structure were due to faculty
and student demand, she said.
Rice did say that one of the
main targets are the tremendous
amount of paperwork and systems
that are involved in the day-to-day
processes of the University.
Members of the community
have "to think in terms of 'us,'
and 'us' is the ones that drive aca
demic overhead," she said.
A few days after hinting at
plans for further budget cuts
and restructuring, Provost
Condoleezza Rice in an inter
view Monday outlined in broad
terms the process which she
hopes will prepare the Univer
sity for the 21st century.
Saying that there are not yet
any specific numbers, details or
timelines, Rice discussed her
plans on how the University
will go about restructuring the
administration and ensuring
long-term financial stability
while finding a way to manage

next year's budget deficit, pro
jected to exceed $15 million.
"There is not as much poten
tial for an upside on the rev
enue side," Rice said, adding
that it is up to the University to
find ways to better utilize the
resources it already has.
The University, she said,
now has to contend with two fi
nancial problems: dealing with
next year's higher-than-expect
ed deficit and finding a way to
ensure that these deficits do not
continue in the future.
University President Ger
hard Casper said yesterday that
these steps must be taken in
order for Stanford "to act in the
interest of long-term viability."
Three teams, three plans
Rice's plan, which deals with
the latter of the two problems,
will be overseen by the newly cre
ated Restructuring Steering Com
mittee, which is under the aus
pices of the University Cabinet. It
calls for the creation of three ad
hoc groups to look at three differ
ent ways to reduce costs within
the University.
The first team, the Business
Practices Steering Committee, will
look to re-engineer and streamline
administrative processes. Rice said
this committee will first focus on
the tremendous bureaucracy asso
ciated with the research adminis
tration and on the way procure
ment decisions are made.
The second team, the Adminis
trative Information Systems Core
Team, will be responsible for
looking at ways "to squeeze out
costs and try to increase produc
tivity." Rice said this will mean
asking the vice presidents to real
ly think about their costs while
continuing to produce positive
results.
Rice said the committee will
not look to ask those within the
University to do the same amount
of work with fewer resources, but
will examine which tasks the Uni
versity performs that are truly
productive.

"We have to ask whether we
can do what we do less expensive
ly and bureaucratically," Casper
said.
The final team in the provost's
plan is to look at restructuring
the University and to examine
"whether or not it can continue to
do everything that it has been
doing, or whether or not we might
have to choose to get out of some
things," she said.
While Rice said she hopes the
team responsible for the third
part of the plan — called the Plan
ning/Budgeting/Reporting Pro
ject — gets ideas and feedback
from the Commission on Under
graduate Education, she empha
sized that it will require broad
University discussions.
"We absolutely have to be
ruthless with ourselves in saying
if an activity at Stanford is not
truly excellent, do we really want
to be in that? Or do we have the
resources to make it truly excel
lent? Or should we, perhaps,
think that maybe it's something
Stanford shouldn't do," Rice
said.
While she currently has no
specific programs in mind target
ed for more cuts or elimination,
she did say that to make room for
innovative programs that are
"pressing frontiers, we may have
to take a hard look as a communi
ty at some activities that have
either outlived their usefulness
or just can't be brought back to
life."
Although a specific timeline
has not been set, Rice said she
hopes that these committees can
begin reporting their findings to

the Restructuring Steering Com
mittee by the end of the quarter,
as well as in monthly reports to
the Cabinet, so the administra
tion can "see where we are in
terms of recommendations on the
administrative side of how to
bring down our administrative
costs."

'We absolutely have
to be ruthless with
ourselves In saying if
an activity at Stanford
is not truly excellent,
do we really want to
be in that?'

Adding to $43 million cuts
Rice is following in the foot
steps of her immediate predeces
sors, James Rosse and Gerald
Lieberman, in trying to deal with
an annual deficit. While Rosse
and Lieberman had to work
through Stanford's previous $43
million reduction program, Rice
assumed the burden of a planned
$10-15 million deficit for next
year's budget.
The irony of the situation is
that the $43 million program
caused delays in other costs,
which will end up adding to next
year's deficit. The $10-15 million

deficit "was the administration's
estimate" two years ago for the
1994-95 budget, Rice said.
According to Rice, the admin
istration is "still working to try to
figure out" the exact amount, but
deferred capital and maintenance
costs will create a substantial bur
den on next year's budget.
An additional increase in the
deficit will likely come from
uncertainty about the govern
ment's reimbursement for
research.
The effects of the government's
changes in the Office of Manage
ment and Budget Circular A-21,
which are the guidelines for reim
bursement of the indirect costs
associated with research, are still
trying to be determined. Although
the cap on reimbursements for
administrative costs now stands
at 26 percent, Rice said the admin
istration still has to look at the fig
ures and come up with one that is
"not wildly out of line."
While Rice did say that the
University's previous deficit
reductions paid off, she also con
ceded that it is up to this adminis
tration to "deal with problems we
knew were there but did not
address."
However, she said that because
there is no firm number yet, the
administration does not yet have
a definite plan to deal with the
additional deficit.
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning and a mem
ber of the Restructuring Steering
Committee, said yesterday that as
the group oversees the achieve
ment of long-term financial stabil
ity, it will also look at ways to

address next year's deficit.
But dealing with next year's
problems is a more pressing issue
since the administration has to
submit its proposed budget to the
Board of Trustees in April.
Looking to alums
It is the fact that the deficit has
become a staple of University
operating budgets during the last
few years that spurred Rice to try
to come up with a way to elimi
nate financial uncertainty.
According to Rice, the first step
in fixing the budget is identifying
one of the fundamental problems
within the structure of the Uni
versity's budgets — "we spend
more unrestricted funding than
we take in."
This "basic structural issue"
that the University is facing with
regard to its budget is common
across the country, Cox said.
Rice blames part of the unique
ness of Stanford's problem to the
University's exceptionally low
percentage of alumni who make
annual donations.
Saying that Stanford's statis
tics in this area were "a shock" to
University President Gerhard
Casper, Rice said the University
has to do more to "appeal to alum
ni to help out."
Funds for innovation
Rice said she tends to shy away
from the analogy that a universi
ty is a business, and prefers the
comparison to "a mini-economy ..
. where entrepreneurial ideas"
can flourish.
She believes that a continual
lack of unrestricted funds could

seriously jeopardize Stanford's
academic environment. Rice
points to the fact that this year's
operating budget has set aside
only $2 million to support new
academic programs.
While Rice firmly stated that
she does not want to create u a
strategic plan for Stanford aca
demics," she believes having a
substantial supply of unrestricted
funds is vital to allow any mem
ber of the Stanford community
"to run with a good idea."
Casper concurred: "We have to
find the resources for new innova
tions."
It is through her plan to re
engineer and restructure the Uni
versity that Rice hopes to access
more unrestricted funds. She said
an important first step is to ask
administrators first to think hard
about use of their restricted
funds.
"Trying to bring restricted and
unrestricted funds into a better
balance," is a necessary part of
the process, Rice said.
She said she is not sure yet
where the rest of the money for
more unrestricted funds will come
from — "all is on the table to get
administrative costs down." Pre
vious increases in the administra
tive structure were due to faculty
and student demand, she said.
Rice did say that one of the
main targets are the tremendous
amount of paperwork and systems
that are involved in the day-to-day
processes of the University.
Members of the community
have "to think in terms of 'us,'
and 'us' is the ones that drive aca
demic overhead," she said.
