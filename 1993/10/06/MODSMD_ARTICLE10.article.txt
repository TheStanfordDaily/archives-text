China tests nuke
BEIJING (AP) — Ignoring a plea from
President Clinton, China set off an
underground nuclear blast yesterday
that jeopardized a moratorium on nucle
ar testing by the world's atomic powers.
The United States and other nations
were quick to denounce the Chinese test,
which Western intelligence had predicted
for weeks.
Clinton immediately directed the
Energy Department to prepare for possi
ble resumption of underground nuclear
testing, a step which he had already
threatened to take in the event of a Chi
nese test.
China detonated the nuclear device
early yesterday at its Lop Nor testing site
in the remote northwestern province of
Xinjiang, about 1,450 miles west of Bei
jing-
Hours later, China issued a statement
saying it was developing nuclear weapons
for self-defense and reiterating that it
would join negotiations in Geneva next
January to ban all nuclear tests by 1996.

In the meantime, the blast could
undermine unilateral bans on nuclear
testing observed.
Yeltsin restores order
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris
Yeltsin consolidated his victory over
hard-line enemies yesterday, sacking
three officials even as tanks rolled back
from Russia's smoldering parliament and
soldiers searched for more dead.
The city of 9 million struggled back to
workaday life after a 13-day crisis led to
street battles.
Sniper fire from the blackened parlia
ment building, where an armed challenge
by Communist holdover lawmakers was
crushed Monday, died down during the
day. But Russian television said authori
ties suspected some 10 gunmen remained
in the 19-story building.

Pavel Grachev, formally thanked some
1,300 soldiers and commandos who had
pummeled the marble parliament build
ing for 10 hours Monday.
