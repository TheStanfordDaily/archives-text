# 600 new troops ordered to Somalia
## Clinton defies calls from Congress to end hostilities 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - More than
600 U.S. troops armed with specialized
weapons were prepared to head for
Somalia yesterday as administration
officials tried with little success to quiet
calls from Capitol Hill for quick with
drawal of American forces.
President Clinton summoned his top
national security advisers — including
the commander for the region, Marine
Gen. Joseph P. Hoar — to the White
House to review the situation in Soma
lia.
Clinton's spokeswoman, Dee Dee
Myers, said he was "obviously very con
cerned" but that no dramatic change in
policy was being considered.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin, Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher and
White House adviser David Gergen
briefed more than 150 House and Sen
ate members but failed to placate scores
of Democrats and Republicans.
"The administration needs a plan
and needs it now. We're not hearing it

yet," Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said
following the closed session that lasted
just over an hour.
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the
administration was "in serious trou
ble."
Before the briefing, lawmakers
expressed disenchantment and frustra
tion with the 10-month mission.
"I cannot support U.S. troops being
in the situation of hostilities without an
authorization of Congress," said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Subcommit
tee on Foreign Operations.
However, Christopher said the
recent attacks, coupled with the need to
find missing Americans, meant "it cer
tainly is not the time for us to depart."
Christopher, commenting before his
meeting with the lawmakers, said the
United States wants to withdraw its
forces "but not before our job is done of
providing some security."
Meanwhile, a senior Pentagon offi

cial, speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, confirmed that Hoar's Central Com
mand had requested heavily armored
vehicles for the Somalia operation sev
eral weeks ago but that the request had
been turned down by Aspin.
The Pentagon released a statement
saying, "Deployment requests of vari
ous sizes and configurations are classi
fied in nature and come to Secretary
Aspin on a daily basis. He bases his deci
sions on the best military and diplomat
ic information available at the time."
The Pentagon also announced that
some 650 troops had begun moving to
Somalia by air, including a fleet of seven
Special Operations MH-60 and AH-6
helicopters which are designed to con
duct night-time raids and evacuations
from hostile areas.
The majority of the 12 deaths and 78
injuries sustained by the U.S. forces in
Mogadishu over the weekend came after
the Americans were pinned down near
the crash site of a U.S. helicopter.
