Town meetings should
include concrete goals
of ASSU and students

JUDGING BY the attendance
at last Tuesday's town meet
ing on education costs, the
Council of Presidents has a lot of
work to do in reaching out to stu
dents and their concerns.
Rather than using town meet
ings to discuss educational issues
in general, the COP should struc
ture them to identify the specific
objectives that Stanford students
want their representatives to pur
sue.
Only 15 students took the time
to attend the town meeting in Lan
tana, which lasted about two
hours. Two experts were invited to
answer questions about the gov
ernment's role in giving aid to uni
versities. Inviting professionals to
the forum was an excellent way to
make a complex subject more clear
to students, and should be used in
the future to encourage enlighten
ing discussion.
But some students raised an
issue unrelated to the meeting's
stated agenda that became a major
part of the discussion â€” the impor
tance of student representation on
the University's Commission on
Undergraduate Education. In
creasing the student voice on the
commission is of vital importance
to all students, and is also urgent,
given that the commission is
already late in beginning its work.
More importantly for the future
of town meetings, however, the
COP needs to recognize from this
example that students already
understand the issues they want
the ASSU to address. Students
understand that the COP has a
much better chance of increasing
student representation at Stanford
or resurrecting summer storage,
for example, than of changing the
way the federal government metes
out money to universities.

Sucessful meetings require two
changes. First, the ASSU must
make a much larger effort to
inform students about the upcom
ing meeting and about its topic.
Senators should distribute flyers,
attend house meetings and orga
nize a table in White Plaza to
advertise the time and place of the
meeting. As well, they should offer
more detailed information present
ing the various viewpoints of ASSU
representatives or other campus
groups on the topic. This prepara
tion would help town meetings to
focus on the ASSU's course of
action on behalf of students.
Second, the student community
has no excuse for not participating
more closely in the ASSU's deci
sion making. Historically, town
meetings and other forums have
been poorly attended, even when
focusing on issues that directly
affect the quality of student life at
Stanford, such as budget cuts.
Since all students are members of
the ASSU, they cannot complain
about an ineffective governing
body if they make no attempt to
change it.
From the ASSU's standpoint,
students will be more likely to take
part in town meetings that they are
confident will result in a decision.
Nonetheless, it is difficult to avoid
the observation that most Stanford
students criticize the ASSU's deci
sions without making any effort to
influence them for the better. Stu
dents should take it upon them
selves to find out who their senator
and COP members are and talk
with them about their goals.
Future town meetings should
provide an opportunity for stu
dents make these kinds of recom
mendations, to both ASSU and
administration representatives. A
meeting focusing on summer stor
age, in which students can commu
nicate their problems and sugges
tions to the COP, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson and Housing and
Food Services Director Keith Guy
seems a perfect example of a con
crete, understandable agenda for
the next meeting.
We'll be watching.
