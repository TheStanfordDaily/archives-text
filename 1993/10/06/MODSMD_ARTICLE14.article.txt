# Campus viewpoint Tommy Lee Woon
## New multicultural educator defines task 
### 
I WAS WALKING
down the second
fairway of the Stan
ford golf course when
the Stanford alum
whom I had met on the
first tee began the cus
tomary ritual that is a
prerequisite to spending
the next four hours
together. "So what do

you do?" he asked.
I held my breath and stated as casual
ly as possible, "I work for Residential
Education and the dean of students as
the multicultural educator." The ensuing
silence was something I had begun to
expect since assuming my position on
June 14. We finished playing that hole
without any further conversation. While
walking to the third tee, my partner
stopped, and thinking out loud said,
"Imagine that ... a multicultural educa
tor who plays golf."
I have been conspicuously different
and vulnerable in many places and situa
tions in my life. I have had experiences as
the lone Asian-American male in an
Asian women's class, the best man in an
all-African-American wedding, the only
Asian-American on a Native American
reservation, the person of color in a
mixed audience who was willing to state
that Jews deserved to have people of color
as allies, and the token Asian-American
administrator at other schools where I

have worked. None of these experiences
have left me feeling as awkward as intro
ducing myself as the multicultural educa
tor to an unreceptive audience.
Conversations too often stop when
people hear about my professional identi
ty. Colleagues wince when they hear me
say I am "the" multicultural educator
because it invalidates their equally valid
work as multicultural educators. Some
new students stared at my name tag. Per
haps they were trying to live up to some
self-imposed belief that they should know
something about a term so common as
"multicultural." My immigrant parents
wonder if their investment in my college
education is being used in my new job.
During Orientation I found myself try
ing to find a precise definition to define
my work. I have tried various ways of
introducing myself. I've tried the func
tionalism approach by describing the four
target groups whom I am to serve (new
students, leaders of student organiza
tions, the Residential Education and
dean of students staff and student cen
ters). I've tried the community develop
ment tactic by describing my role as a
multicultural community builder. Like
any new kid on the block, I am trying to
create a hospitable environment for
myself, to be judged by who I am rather
than by a title filled with stereotypes.
I find it odd that multiculturalism and
multicultural education are such heated
issues. For hostile critics these terms are

epithets. To committed proponents they
are our salvation. To me these terms rep
resent an acknowledgment of diversity in
the human population, a recognition that
maintaining heterogeneity is a valuable
state of human affairs, and that living
peacefully will require us to overcome our
ethnocentrism.
Contrary to popular belief, multicul
tural education and multiculturalism did
not start in Res Ed. The basic concept of
multicultural education has existed since
the 1920s in this country, when the
objective was to orient the populace to
newly arrived immigrants. It continued
into the 1930s but dissipated from the
public mind from the 1940s to the early
'60s. The resurgence in the public's
awareness about multicultural education
occurred when historical events con
verged to create a need for the manage
ment of diversity in the late '60s. Res Ed
has only been on the forefront of address
ing the inevitable.
I will need this community's help to
develop the kind of multicultural educa
tion program we need and deserve to help
us flourish in today's world. I can't think
of more interesting challenge nor a better
time to be here in Stanford's history.
For you golfers out there, I bogeyed
that second hole, but I think I parred the
next one.
