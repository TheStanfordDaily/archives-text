## Stanford’s self-defense classes hold no place for men 
### 
THE DAILY'S Sept. 30 editorial
("Gender and equality") provided
an introduction to what we hope
will be an open and educational discus
sion about the place of women's self
defense classes in the university. Howev
er, there were some assumptions about
our class and its purpose which we must
address.
Our class is developed for women, by
women who understand the specific
strengths of women's bodies and specific
ways in which women are assaulted.
Women are usually attacked by men who
intend to sexually assault them. Men are
seldom attacked for this reason. Similar
ly, because women encounter sexual
harassment in many places, from the
street to the classroom to the workplace
to the home, our assertiveness tech
niques are geared to those situations.
Women who take our class may them
selves have been assaulted and would not
feel comfortable expressing themselves in
a co-ed class. Often the student has told
no one about the incident. Sometimes it
is only after talking about these issues in
class that a student realizes that her

father raped her when she was five, or
that her first party ended with an
assault. We cannot know what will trig
ger the release of painful memories.
Offering separate classes for survivors is
not feasible because we — and the sur
vivors — do not always know who they
are.
Classroom dynamics in a co-ed class
are vastly different than in a class of
women. Studies show that in co-ed class
es, men tend to dominate discussion.
Issues of sexual assault are more disturb
ing and emotionally charged for women,
who are potential targets of this kind of
violence, than for men, who usually are
not. A male student may more easily
remove himself from the issue by dis
cussing it on an academic level, thereby
silencing a woman who is just beginning
to understand that she is not "making it
up" or "just too sensitive."
The Daily's example of a non-segregat
ed class on racism or gay-bashing is sim
plistic. Our class is not "about" violence
against women, although we discuss it.
Our class is about identifying the many
forms of gender-based violence in our

lives, identifying potential attackers, and
preventing an assault from ever occur
ring. This is practical, not theoretical, to
our students.
Because violence against women does
not happen in a vacuum, we do not try to
address it as such. We teach physical
moves as specific tools with which to
fight back. We teach assertiveness tech
niques because we believe that acting
assertively may prevent many assaults
from escalating to the physical level. We
include readings and discussion to better
understand the context of violence
against women in our society. We cannot
separate these aspects of the class from
each other to create a "co-ed discussion
group" just as we cannot separate them
in life.
We agree that there needs to be more
co-ed discussion of these issues, but our
class is not the forum for it. Neither are
we a support group. Our job is to teach
women, and only women, how they can
fight back against sexual assault. Our job
is not to teach men how women can fight
back.
College women — the demographic

group most likely to be assaulted — must
have the option to take this as an aca
demic class. Taking credit away insures
that self-defense remains a privilege and
not a right. Only those who can "afford"
to take it — whether they can afford the
time, the money or the units — will do so.
For those who must make every unit
count, or who must stop out and work in
order to pay tuition, the class becomes an
impossibility.
We assume that everyone is aware of
the special place men have held in
academia and the rest of the world
throughout history. Our class recognizes
the inequity that has developed and
makes an effort to correct this imbalance,
allowing women to compete on more
equal footing. To quote The Daily, "the
privilege of one student's comfort cannot
supersede another's entitlement to an
education." At this moment, the histori
cal privilege of each male student's com
fort is superseding the right of every
Stanford woman to an education.

understand the context of violence
against women in our society. We cannot
separate these aspects of the class from
each other to create a "co-ed discussion
group" just as we cannot separate them
in life.
We agree that there needs to be more
co-ed discussion of these issues, but our
class is not the forum for it. Neither are
we a support group. Our job is to teach
women, and only women, how they can
fight back against sexual assault. Our job
is not to teach men how women can fight
back.
College women — the demographic

group most likely to be assaulted — must
have the option to take this as an aca
demic class. Taking credit away insures
that self-defense remains a privilege and
not a right. Only those who can "afford"
to take it — whether they can afford the
time, the money or the units — will do so.
For those who must make every unit
count, or who must stop out and work in
order to pay tuition, the class becomes an
impossibility.
We assume that everyone is aware of
the special place men have held in
academia and the rest of the world
throughout history. Our class recognizes
the inequity that has developed and
makes an effort to correct this imbalance,
allowing women to compete on more
equal footing. To quote The Daily, "the
privilege of one student's comfort cannot
supersede another's entitlement to an
education." At this moment, the histori
cal privilege of each male student's com
fort is superseding the right of every
Stanford woman to an education.
