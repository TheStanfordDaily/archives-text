## Researchers progress in pinpointing neurons Brain-mapping techniques improved with faster, finer-resolution imaging 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
Stanford psychology and radiology profes
sors are working to find a needle in a haystack.
Only in this case, the hay is the human brain
and the needle, 100,000 neurons.
And they're doing it with no special
equipment, just a clever approach to a cur
rent cranial conundrum — how to map out
all the functional areas of the brain.
In the past, scientists were limited main
ly to studying the brain through research
on monkeys or positron emission tomogra
phy (PET), which required a human to
inhale radioactive materials that could be
traced by detecting emitted radiation.
These methods have obvious problems
— monkeys are not exactly analogous to
humans (especially in the area of critical
thinking), and repeat experiments using
radioactive materials are hazardous to sub
jects' health.
The activity of neurons, which carry
information throughout the brain in mil
liseconds, has baffled scientists because of
the difficulty in pinpointing why, where
and when they work.
Now there may be an answer.
Two years ago, researchers at Harvard
discovered a new method for studying the

brain. Using a powerful magnet in a Mag
netic Resonance Imager (MRI), they can
detect active areas by tracing the oxygen
content of hemoglobin in different parts of
the brain as they become more active.
Blood surges through the brain as one
part becomes more active than another.
The hemoglobin in the blood that goes to
these areas has an oxygen content that can
be detected in fme amounts by the MRl's
magnet.
When parts of the brain become active,
they are sent more blood than they actually
need. This excess blood causes enough
magnetic fluctuation that it can be detected
by the right technique.
"The signal is rather subtle.... It takes
some unique skills to extract," said Radiol
ogy Prof. Gary Glover.
"Some other groups have used high
speed imaging [with faster machines], but
cardiac pulsation blurs the resolution," he
said.
The technique used at Stanford takes
about one second per MRI photograph. It's
40 times faster than the PET, but a little
slower than the "high-speed" images.
One second is long enough to avoid car
diac pulsation blurring, which are varia
tions caused by heart beats, but short
enough to be useful in psychology experi
ments.
One second is also approximately the
time in which people "see a word or see a
face," according to Psychology Prof. John
Gabrieli.
Another reason to forego speedier MRIs
is that the research being done by Glover,
Psychology Prof. Brian Wandell, Psycholo
gy Prof. David Rumelhart, post-doctorate
student Adrian Lee and graduate student
Steve Engel could be duplicated for other
brain research throughout the United
States because the Stanford technique pro
duces great precision using a standard
MRI, a mainstay in most medical centers.
Engel called the MRI "tunable, much
like the contrast knob on a TV... instead of
adjusting light, [we] tune the magnet to
pick up magnetic properties." For instance,
bone has different magnetics than blood or
fat.
Another breakthrough that could push
the Stanford researchers ahead of their

counterparts, is their advancement in spa
tial resolution, which indicates the number
of neurons being watched.
The group has improved standard brain
imaging by a factor of 100, according to
Wandell.
Just as satellites can locate geographical
areas better with finer resolution, scientists
can gain a better understanding of the
brain with a clearer, finer MRI picture.
Areas of neuron activity can now be
located to within one square millimeter.
Before, resolution was on the magnitude of
a square centimeter.
The new technique also has benefits car
ried over from the original research at Har
vard:
• less invasive methods — no injection of
radioactive materials or attachment of elec

trades
• no harmful side effects, so individual
patients can be studied again and again
• direct imaging of the healthy human
brain; before, the brain was only analyzed
through inferences from monkey research
or glimpses of humans who had injuries to
the brain.
Similar to the human genome project
which works to find out where genes for
certain functions exist, this project has
international promise in that it could bring
more attention to brain research.
This research also allows neurosurgeons
to pinpoint brain tumors or damage more
accurately. Brain surgery can therefore be
more exact, staying away from sensitive
areas.
Often, to stop epilepsy patients from

having seizures when medication does not
work, doctors may remove the area of the
brain where the seizures are thought to
originate.
To locate this area and ensure that they
do not remove vital functional areas, doc
tors often must put one side of the brain to
sleep and conduct a series of tests.
This process can be a scary one for
patients and only yields minimal results.
The new technology combined with 3-D
computer imaging from Computer Science
Prof. Marc Levoy's lab could create a pow
erful tool to aid these doctors in eliminating
problematic areas of the brain.
For other doctors, it may help them to
determine whether a certain part of the
brain is in danger from a spreading tumor,
and where to operate around sensitive areas.

Stanford psychology and radiology profes
sors are working to find a needle in a haystack.
Only in this case, the hay is the human brain
and the needle, 100,000 neurons.
And they're doing it with no special
equipment, just a clever approach to a cur
rent cranial conundrum — how to map out
all the functional areas of the brain.
In the past, scientists were limited main
ly to studying the brain through research
on monkeys or positron emission tomogra
phy (PET), which required a human to
inhale radioactive materials that could be
traced by detecting emitted radiation.
These methods have obvious problems
— monkeys are not exactly analogous to
humans (especially in the area of critical
thinking), and repeat experiments using
radioactive materials are hazardous to sub
jects' health.
The activity of neurons, which carry
information throughout the brain in mil
liseconds, has baffled scientists because of
the difficulty in pinpointing why, where
and when they work.
Now there may be an answer.
Two years ago, researchers at Harvard
discovered a new method for studying the

brain. Using a powerful magnet in a Mag
netic Resonance Imager (MRI), they can
detect active areas by tracing the oxygen
content of hemoglobin in different parts of
the brain as they become more active.
Blood surges through the brain as one
part becomes more active than another.
The hemoglobin in the blood that goes to
these areas has an oxygen content that can
be detected in fme amounts by the MRl's
magnet.
When parts of the brain become active,
they are sent more blood than they actually
need. This excess blood causes enough
magnetic fluctuation that it can be detected
by the right technique.
"The signal is rather subtle.... It takes
some unique skills to extract," said Radiol
ogy Prof. Gary Glover.
"Some other groups have used high
speed imaging [with faster machines], but
cardiac pulsation blurs the resolution," he
said.
The technique used at Stanford takes
about one second per MRI photograph. It's
40 times faster than the PET, but a little
slower than the "high-speed" images.
One second is long enough to avoid car
diac pulsation blurring, which are varia
tions caused by heart beats, but short
enough to be useful in psychology experi
ments.
One second is also approximately the
time in which people "see a word or see a
face," according to Psychology Prof. John
Gabrieli.
Another reason to forego speedier MRIs
is that the research being done by Glover,
Psychology Prof. Brian Wandell, Psycholo
gy Prof. David Rumelhart, post-doctorate
student Adrian Lee and graduate student
Steve Engel could be duplicated for other
brain research throughout the United
States because the Stanford technique pro
duces great precision using a standard
MRI, a mainstay in most medical centers.
Engel called the MRI "tunable, much
like the contrast knob on a TV... instead of
adjusting light, [we] tune the magnet to
pick up magnetic properties." For instance,
bone has different magnetics than blood or
fat.
Another breakthrough that could push
the Stanford researchers ahead of their

counterparts, is their advancement in spa
tial resolution, which indicates the number
of neurons being watched.
The group has improved standard brain
imaging by a factor of 100, according to
Wandell.
Just as satellites can locate geographical
areas better with finer resolution, scientists
can gain a better understanding of the
brain with a clearer, finer MRI picture.
Areas of neuron activity can now be
located to within one square millimeter.
Before, resolution was on the magnitude of
a square centimeter.
The new technique also has benefits car
ried over from the original research at Har
vard:
• less invasive methods — no injection of
radioactive materials or attachment of elec

trades
• no harmful side effects, so individual
patients can be studied again and again
• direct imaging of the healthy human
brain; before, the brain was only analyzed
through inferences from monkey research
or glimpses of humans who had injuries to
the brain.
Similar to the human genome project
which works to find out where genes for
certain functions exist, this project has
international promise in that it could bring
more attention to brain research.
This research also allows neurosurgeons
to pinpoint brain tumors or damage more
accurately. Brain surgery can therefore be
more exact, staying away from sensitive
areas.
Often, to stop epilepsy patients from

having seizures when medication does not
work, doctors may remove the area of the
brain where the seizures are thought to
originate.
To locate this area and ensure that they
do not remove vital functional areas, doc
tors often must put one side of the brain to
sleep and conduct a series of tests.
This process can be a scary one for
patients and only yields minimal results.
