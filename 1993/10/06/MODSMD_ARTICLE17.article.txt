# Mars probe search: One last Dish effort
## Stanford scientists lament loss of projects, await NASA decision 
### Steve Balt 
With a multi-million dollar
spacecraft carrying two Stanford
based experiments lost in the
heavens, Stanford scientists are
turning to an unlikely friend for
help — the Dish.
On Aug. 21, three days before it
was to enter Mars orbit, the $980
million, minivan-sized Mars
Observer lost contact with its
ground crew. The mission was the
first U.S. voyage to the red planet
in 17 years.

Scientists are hoping
the Dish, a 46-meter
radio telescope locat
ed in the Foothills,
will be able to pick
up the lost space
craff s signal.

Now, Stanford scientists are
hoping the Dish, a 46-meter radio
telescope located in the Foothills,
will be able to pick up the lost
spacecraft's signal.
Last week NASA scientists sent
a command to turn on the Observ
er's Mars Balloon Relay, which
emits a low power signal that was
to be used as a beacon for a
planned Russian lander in 1994.
Although its signal intensity is
weak — about 1/500 the strength
of KZSU's power and 1/10 that of
the Observer's normal radio sig
nal — it operates at a much high
er wavelength, one that can be
received by the Dish.
"We're not counting on seeing
it," conceded Joe Twicken, a sys
tems programmer in Stanford's
Center for Radio Astronomy, who
has been analyzing the data from
the first few days of the Dish's
operation.
Although finding the space
craft won't reestablish contact, it
will give forlorn scientists the
peace of mind that their experi
ments are intact.

The Observer, home to seven
scientific experiments and multi
million dollar data collection and
communications hardware, might
have entered orbit, or it might
have passed Mars altogether float
ing into the interplanetary void.
Or its pieces might be strewn
across the Martian landscape.
"It's gone. I think it's gone .. .
It's a very big loss," lamented G.
Leonard Tyler of Stanford's
Space, Telescope and Radio Sci
ence lab, head of the group that
planned to conduct investigations
of the Martian gravitational field
and atmosphere.
The Stanford crew was to use
radio science data to perform two
sets of experiments.
In the first, they were to probe
subtle variations in the Martian
gravitational field by monitoring
the velocity of the Observer via
two-way radio communication.
Since Mars is not a point mass,
the Observer would experience
variations in gravity according to
the density of the martian crust
below.
These gravitational shifts
would have minute effects on the
acceleration of the Observer,
which would then be reflected in
the Observer's velocity. The
Observer would be, in effect, a
"test particle in a Gedanken
(thought) experiment," according
to Tyler.
The second experiment was to
focus on the Martian atmosphere.
Using radio occultation tech
niques that have been used previ
ously to analyze the atmospheres
and ring systems of other planets
and moons in the solar system, the
Stanford experimenters hoped to
generate a detailed description of
the Martian skies.
The radio occultation measure
ments are similar to comparing
the differences between shouting
through air and shouting under
water.
Immediately before the
Observer passes behind Mars, out
of view from Earth, its radio sig
nals would pass through the thin,
carbon dioxide Martian atmo
sphere for 10-20 seconds.
This would slow the radio

waves somewhat, as compared to
the "direct" radio signal through
space.
With the Observer completing
an orbit every 118 minutes, Stan
ford researchers would have the
opportunity to witness several
appearances and disappearances
(collectively called "occultations")
of the Observer every day.
The result would be a highly
detailed map of temperature and
pressure differences in the Mar
tian atmosphere by the end of the
Observer's projected mission —
one Martian year, or 687 Earth
days.
These dreams, however, may
never come to fruition. Senior
research associate David Hinson,
who hoped that the radio occulta
tion data would permit scientists
to test computer models of the
Earth's atmosphere with the
observations from Mars, was sad
dened by the apparent loss of the
mission.
"We got so close," he lamented.
"It seemed like we were home
free."
As scientists await further
word from NASA officials con
cerning a possible repeat mission,
there is limited speculation about
the options available.
The numerous experiments
aboard the Observer could be
repeated individually, but accord

ing to Tyler, the Observer project
formed "a suite of experiments"
that would yield essentially mean
ingless information by them
selves.
For instance, tracing the gravi
ty field of the planet is useless
without data from the Mars
Observer's laser altimeter, an
Observer experiment designed to
map the topography of the planet.
"I know it's asking the taxpay
ers for a lot of money," said Hin
son, but the only way to repeat the
mission successfully is to rebuild
the entire project.
Although there is some opti
mism, given NASA's stated com
mitment to Mars exploration,
Hinson said a failure to repeat the
projects would be detrimental to
many scientists' careers.
Indeed, the failed mission has
taken a bite out of many careers
already. Tuna Karayel, a graduate
student in electrical engineering,
worked for two years on a thesis
that would have partially relied on
data from the radio science exper
iments.
Tyler, who has been involved in
the Stanford effort since 1985,
admits the Observer mission is a
failure, but is currently working
on a similar experiment involving
a Pluto probe. "This is a high-risk
business," he explained. "These
things do happen."

The Dish points upward for the first time in over a year, searching
space for the lost Mars Observer.
