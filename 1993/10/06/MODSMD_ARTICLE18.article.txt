How does sunscreen
Vi'block the sun's rays? After
all, it's clear.
— Burned

A: Well, if it's so clear,
then why did you
ask? (Maniacal laughter.) You
know, sometimes I just kill me.
Blocking some fraction of the
solar radiation

that impinges
upon your
exposed tissues
every time you
go outside is
important to
your survival.
In addition to
illumination
(visible wave
lengths) and
warmth
(infrared), the

sun's rays also have a consider
able ultraviolet component.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can
give you a nice tan, but it can also
damage the DNA in your cells,
resulting in cell death, mutation
and even skin cancer.
Since cancer is nobody's cup
of tea, nature has conveniently
provided us with a natural
defense against UV rays: the pig
ment known as melanin. The
melanin molecule has the very
special property of absorbing UV
light and converting the energy
into harmless (and even pleas
ant) heat; ergo, it can act as a
sort of bulletproof vest against
UV rays, protecting the living,
growing skin cells beneath the
surface from genetic damage.
Even better, this bulletproof
vest is caliber-sensitive: If you
spend only a little time in the
sun, very little absorption is
needed and your skin produces
an appropriately small amount
of melanin. If, on the other hand,
you feel shame at your paleness
and attempt to compensate by
lying motionless in the sun for
several hours every day, the skin
generates more melanin, and the
level of protection rises — the
phenomenon of "tanning." Pea
shooters to elephant guns,
melanin has you covered.

Being a smart person, you
might have noticed that the
color of melanin — best
described as "dark" — isn't
important to its crucial function.
Simplistically speaking, an
object's color corresponds to,
rather than absorbs, whatever
wavelength of light it reflects.
Since UV rays are invisible, a
molecule that absorbed them
wouldn't necessarily have to be
any specific color at all. Sure,

me 1 anin 's
dark color
allows rich
girls to flaunt
their expen
diture of idle
time as a sta
tus symbol,
but it doesn't
aid in the
absorption of
invisible UV
rays.

In fact,
many completely transparent
compounds absorb the most
damaging sort of ultraviolet light
("UV-B") as well or better than
melanin. Those which are also
easily synthesized and can be
connived to stay stuck to the skin
for several hours have been
exploited in sunscreens.
Most sunscreens essentially
give your body a temporary coat
ing of "wannabe" melanin. The
active molecules of suntan lotion
— PABA is a good example —
absorb a fair share of UV-B, mak
ing life easy on your natural
defenses and hence on your skin.
The extent of absorption depends
on the SPF ("Solar Protection
Factor" or some such), which is a
function of the nature of the
active molecules (some are better
absorbers than others), and their
concentration in the lotion.
Another approach to avoiding
UV damage to the skin is more
appropriately called a "sun
block/' epitomized by titanium
dioxide — that white stuff that
lifeguards slop onto their noses.
Rather than absorbing UV light,
titanium dioxide reflects it.
