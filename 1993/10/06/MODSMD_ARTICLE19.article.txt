## Spikers down Cal in Big Match 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
What started as a seemingly
one-sided match evolved into a
fierce struggle last night in Har
mon Arena, as the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team took four
games to defeat California 15-3,

15-3, 11-15, 16-14.
The Cardinal's victory extend
ed the team's Big Match winning
streak to 21 consecutive victories
over the Golden Bears (7-7, 0-7 in
the Pacific 10 Conference), yet
Stanford had to work for that dis
tinction.
The Cardinal (11-2, 5-2 in the

Pac-10) surged to an early 4-0 lead
at the outset of the match, pow
ered by senior Piper Hahn's tough
jump serves. The Golden Bears
then received their first exposure
to Stanford's powerful front line
in the form of sophomore Marnie
Triefenbach's cross-court smash.
Cal was unable to catch its
breath, not to mention the score,
as the Cardinal extended its lead
with 12 unanswered points. The
Golden Bears managed to scrape
in three points before freshman
Nikki Otto stepped up to the ser
vice line, adding another two
points. Triefenbach's left-side
attack wrapped up the game for
an easy 15-3 victory.
The Cardinal took the same
route in the second game, securing
the first three points. Stanford
proved virtually unstoppable,
scoring another four for a 7-0 lead.
Junior Anne Wicks' unpredictable
float serve baffled California for
another three points, before the
Golden Bears came out of their
haze to tally their first point of the
game.
Sophomore Wendy Hromad
ka's powerful net game boosted
the Cardinal to a 12-1 lead; then
the Bears were able to sneak in
two more points. After a short yet
impressive appearance by fresh
man Catherine Juillard in the
back row, the Cardinal served for
game point and came out of the
second contest with another 15-3
victory.
After completely dominating
the first two games, the Cardinal
lost momentum in game three,
allowing Cal to take its first lead of
the match at 3-0. Then Otto's
float serve came down for a service
ace to put the Cardinal on the
board. Triefenbach then followed
her lead and served for her 13th
ace of the season.
While Stanford's serves
remained consistently strong, the
Cardinal found itself playing
catch-up for the remainder of the
game. The Golden Bears mounted

a much stronger blocking effort in
game three, extending their lead
to 5-3. Entering the game to serve
for the Cardinal, freshman
Colleen Miniuk eventually evened
the score at 6-6.
Led by senior middle blocker
Kara Dane, the Golden Bears
stepped up their offensive attack
and increased their lead to 12-7.
Even though Miniuk, together
with classmate Eileen Murfee,
tried to initiate a Cardinal resur
gence, Stanford continued to trail
11-14. After foiling five Golden
Bear game-point attempts, Stan
ford could no longer contain the
California momentum, dropping
the third game 15-11.
At the same rapid scoring pace
that Stanford displayed in the first
two games, the Golden Bears
served for the first six points of
game four. Even though Triefen
bach's left swing came through for
two points to cut California's lead
to 6-3, the Cardinal struggled
against an improved Golden Bear
front row.
While Stanford managed to
even the score at 9-9, Cal was able
to locate enough holes in the Stan
ford defense to take the lead again.
After an exasperating juggle for
possession, the Cardinal gained
the advantage for the first time in
the game at 13-12.
Stanford then looked to the
always reliable Wendell-Hahn com
bination and was able to stay a half
step ahead of the Golden Bears at
15-14. After briefly relinquishing
the ball to Cal, the Cardinal
regained possession. On Hromad
ka's serve, Otto slammed down the
final kill for a prolonged win.
Coming ofT this victory, the Car
dinal will gear up for the Stan
ford/Bank of America Invitational
this weekend — hosting Texas,
University of Pacific and Colorado
at Maples Pavilion. Stanford will
face Texas at 6 p.m. on Friday, then
appear in either the consolation
match on Saturday at 6 p.m. or the
Championship match at 8 p.m.
