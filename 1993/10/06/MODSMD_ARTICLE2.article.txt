# Provost enjoys busy post behind University scenes

### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
With a regular ear-to-ear
smile that is a certain sign of
her contentment, Stanford's
youngest and first female
provost said that she is having
fun in her new position.
But last year's well-received
promotion means that Con
doleezza Rice stays extremely
busy. However, even as she
works 11- to 12-hour days and

often is double-booked for ap
pointments, Rice said she is
"glad to come to work" every
morning.
University President Ger
hard Casper said that Rice has
"been quite wonderful" since
she took office.
"She has just fulfilled all my
hopes," he added.
Rice reciprocated the praise,
saying that "working with Ger

hard Casper is a lot of fun."
Assuming the number two
position of provost earlier this
summer, Rice has been thrust
into the regular public eye.
Considered one of the coun
try's top experts on Russian mili
tary and political issues, Rice, a
regular on "Nightline" during the
last attempted coup in the former
Soviet Union, said she is "a CNN
watcher these days."
President Clinton invited her
to dinner and asked her to brief

him before he met with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Van
couver earlier this year. Clinton
even took the opportunity on
Monday, when both were in San
Francisco to announce the $237
million project for Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, to ask her
about how she thought things
had gone during the attempted
coup this weekend.
"I said I thought that the
administration had handled it
very well," Rice said.
Rice said she also gained a lot
of experience for her new job from
her stint on President Bush's
National Security Council — like
learning how to handle the press.

Giving daily press briefings to
the White House press corps
taught her how to dodge ques
tions, she said.
But one area that Rice is direct
and steadfast on is l>er commit
ment to nurturing Stanford's
junior faculty members.
Rice, who is proud to say she is
a faculty member of the Political
Science Department, said she
likes to reflect and "look at how
well mentored [she was] within
the department."
Pointing to her early working
relationships with professors, par
ticularly Political Science Prof.
John Lewis, she said, "They all did
things to make me feel good."
