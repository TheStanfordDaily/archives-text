# Jordan prepared to declare retirement

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Michael
Jordan, the world's most famous
athlete and basketball's greatest
player, will announce his retire
ment today, according to NBC
and published reports.
"Dateline NBC," the Denver
Post and the Chicago Sun-Times
reported the news almost simul
taneously last night.
Jordan, NBA scoring champi
on the last seven years, leader of
the three-time champion Chicago
Bulls, two-time Olympic gold
medal winner and NCAA champi
on as a freshman at North Caroli
na, is expected to cite his father's
slaying this summer as the reason
for his retirement at age 30.
"It's time for me to move on to
something else," the Sun-Times
said Jordan told friends. "I know
a lot of people are going to be
shocked by this decision and
probably won't understand. But
I've talked it over with my family
and friends, and most of all I'm at
peace with myself over the deci
sion."
His father's death apparently
robbed Jordan of his desire to
play, the Post said.
Dateline NBC producer Neil
Shapiro said the show learned of
Jordan's plans from "authoritive
sources close to the NBA."
The Bulls have scheduled a
news conference at 11 a.m. EDT
today to make what they called a
"major announcement."
Jordan threw out the ceremo
nial first pitch at last night's play
off opener between the Chicago
White Sox and the Toronto Blue
Jays at Comiskey Park in Chica
go. He left after the seventh
inning, got behind the wheel of a
black Mercedes-Benz and drove
off.
Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the
White Sox and Bulls, said from
the ballpark: "I have nothing to
say tonight. We'll have something
to say tomorrow."
The NBA refused comment,
deflecting queries to the Bulls.

In a copyright story, the Post
said Bulls coach Phil Jackson had
confirmed that Jordan was retir
ing.
The Post said Jackson would
not say if Jordan had indicated
his decision was irrevocable.
According to the paper, a
source close to Jordan said he has
told friends he just doesn't have
the fire to play any more.
Jordan began his NBA career
in 1984 after being named college
player of the year at the Universi
ty of North Carolina in both 1983
and '84.1n 1982, Jordan, then a
skinny freshman, helped Dean
Smith win his first NCAA title at
North Carolina when he hit the
game-winning shot in the final
seconds.
Jordan led the Bulls to their
first NBA title in 1991. The Bulls
won their second title in 1992,
with Jordan again winning MVP
honors. He made it three in a row
when the Bulls beat the Phoenix
Suns to win the NBA title in
June.
Jordan also found nothing but
success in the Olympics.
In 1984, before his rookie sea
son in the NBA, he was coach Bob
Knight's best player as the U.S.
team went unbeaten through the
basketball tournament in Los
Angeles. It was the last time a
team of collegiate players man
aged to win a gold medal for the
United States.
Jordan was back in 1992 when
the Olympics allowed profession
al players into Olympic basket
ball for the first time. Jordan was
the brightest star on the gold
medal-winning "Dream Team"
that also included Johnson and
Larry Bird.
All of that team's stars subju
gated their offensive talents for
the success of the team, and none
more than Jordan. He even took a
turn at point guard when Johnson
and John Stockton were injured,
proving that his skill went far
beyond mere scoring talent.
