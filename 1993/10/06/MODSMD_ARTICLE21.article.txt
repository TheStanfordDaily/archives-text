# Intramural sports offer competitive forum for all athletes
## Rediscover the Olympian in you, as IM inner-tube water polo and volleyball provide a welcomed afternoon study break

With the beginning of the new academic year at
Stanford comes the start of another exciting sea
son of Intramural athletics.
The fall season, which started on Monday, once
again features four-man volleyball, seven-man
football and inner-tube water polo as its major
team sports.
However, changes have been made in the Intra
mural program this year.
Though the all-University, all-women and co-ed
leagues still exist, there has been a major change
in the structure of the all-University division.
In years past, this branch of Intramurals con
sisted of three distinct levels of competition. In
theory, the "A" league existed for the most tal

ented and competitive students, while the "B"
and "C" leagues were for the less-experienced
competitors.
Unfortunately, each year the "A-caliber" teams
did not always enter the "A" league, thus creating
a very weak "A" league with few teams and an
exceptionally strong "B" league.
In an effort to fix this problem, the all-Univer
sity league has been split into two divisions this
season. Division One is the upper division for
more competitive students, while Division Two
serves less intense athletes.
Many students involved in Intramurals said
that the changes were long overdue. "It seemed
illogical to have three divisions and not have the
best teams in the best division. The new divisions
will take care of this problem and put the best

teams on a level where they should be compet
ing," said Student Intramural Director Kevin Jef
feries.
Another recent addition to Intramural sports is
a forfeiture fee, implemented last year.
Designed to reduce the number of team forfei
tures, the fee again applies to all Intramural team
sports and is a $50-per-squad deposit made before
each season begins.
The deposit will be refunded to each team at
the end of their respective seasons, with the
amount returned based upon the number of
games it had to forfeit. The fee for each forfeit is
$10.
For those not interested in team sports, there
are many programs requiring fewer participants.
These include billiards, golf, wrestling, doubles

tennis, basketball and cross-country running.
There is also a place for students who are not
interested in playing sports; the Intramural
department is always looking for referees for the
various team sports.
This quarter referees are needed for football.
No experience is necessary and the pay is $6.60
per hour. The Intramural department can guar
antee those interested in refereeing a job this
year. Additionally, it is possible to both referee
and compete in games, although both judging and
participating in the same activity is restricted.
Those interested in playing Intramurals should
contact his or her dorm or house in order to field
a team as soon as possible. Graduate students can
form teams through their house or their depart
ments.
