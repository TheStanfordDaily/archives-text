# Cardinal field hockey pitted against top Eastern squads

### Christian Leone 
On Saturday, seven games
into the season, the Stanford
women's field hockey team real
ized that crunch time was final
ly here. "It was time to get
psyched and start kicking some
ass," said senior forward Sarah
Hallock.
The players responded to the
accumulating mid-season pres
sure with a 4-0 shutout over
University of Pacific.
Now, the 3-4 Cardinal travels
to Columbus, Ohio, where start
ing today they will play Ohio,
Ohio State, James Madison and
Michigan.
Saturday's victory was par
ticularly impressive, coming the
day after a 3-2 overtime loss to
arch-rival California.
The key to the Pacific game
was the Cardinal's stifling
defense, which should continue
to make much of the difference
in this week's series.
Led by seniors Markley
Bavinger and Danielle Beynet,
Stanford goes into the series
allowing just over two goals per
game.
"Our team defense has gotten
a lot better," said freshman
defender Karla Peterson. "Hav
ing the seniors in the back line
really makes a difference
because they have a lot of expe
rience."
Other Cardinal players agree
with Peterson's assessment.
"Our biggest problem is that we
are never ready the first five
minutes and the other team
pounces on us," Beynet said.
Stanford opens this week's
action today against a danger

ous Ohio squad, which is coming
off a huge win over Miami of
Ohio.
"I am very pleased with our
team's performance," said Ohio
coach Mary Mine, whose team

possesses a 6-3 record. "The win
ensured us a second-place finish
in the (Mid-Atlantic] Confer
ence."
Stanford will have to watch
out for a red-hot Ohio offense

fueled by Marlene Annoni (this
week's MAC player of the week),
who accumulated nine points
against the Redskins on Satur
day.
Stanford is going to have

come out fighting tomorrow as
well if it wants to come away
with a win against a 6-4 Ohio
State team.
Led by forward Emelie
Leewens and goalie Stefenie
Eyerkaufer (who has four
shutouts in seven games), the
Buckeyes are outshooting their
opponents 213 to 126 and allow
ing a miniscule average of one
goal per game.
Traditionally, field hockey
has been a sport dominated by
East Coast teams, but Western
squads such as Stanford are
attempting to overthrow the ori
ental regime. "We have got a lot
to prove." Beynet explained.
"We want to show them that the
West Coast has some good
teams."
After playing Ohio State, the
Cardinal will get set to face off
against Carole Thate and a
high-powered James Madison
team. Along with Thate's 38
points and a 7-2 record, the sev
enth-ranked Dukes bring some
stingy defense to Saturday's
game.
James Madison gives up an
average of just over a goal a
game, and after only nine games
this year they have posted four
shutouts.
Due to two tough overtime
losses to the Golden Bears earli
er this season, Stanford must
beat Cal during their next two
meetings to be eligible to win
the Northern Pacific Conference
and ensure an automatic berth
into the NCAA Tournament.
"We just want to play well
and win some games," said Hal
lock. "Our goal is to make it to
the NCAAs."

Sophomore midfielder Ellse Morgan muscles her way past two California defenders and displays the
outstanding stickwork that will direct the Cardinal offense during the team's trip to Ohio.
