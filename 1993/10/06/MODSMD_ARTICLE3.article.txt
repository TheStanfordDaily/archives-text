# Title IX violation not constitutional issue
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The cancellation of a women's self-defense
course that may have violated federal gender
equity laws has sparked a debate over constitu
tional issues that has gone all the way from the
Women's Center to a local radio talk show.
People arguing about the Feminist Studies
class — titled "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" — casually toss around constitution
al terms like "separate but equal" or "equal
protection under the law."
But in truth, Stanford's status as a private

school means that the class violates not the
Constitution, but the legislative provisions of
Title IX, Stanford constitutional law experts
say.
"The Constitution governs only state ac
tion, and Stanford is a private university. We
are just like any business subject to employ
ment laws," said Law Prof. Kathleen Sulli
van, a widely recognized constitutional
scholar.
Sullivan added that, in fact, the Title IX pro
visions — which forbid any school receiving
federal funds from discriminating on the basis
of gender — take equality one step further

than the Constitution, which does not specify
equal protection for the sexes.
By accepting federal funds, Stanford must
also choose to accept the specifications of the
legislation. "Title IX is not a prohibition in
gross; it is directed solely to those receiving fed
eral financial aid, in particular educational in
stitutions," said Iris Brest, associate general
counsel of the University.
Brest also stressed that there was no actual
court decision about the self-defense class that
would cause it to be considered a constitution
al case.
"It can't be a precedent-setting
case when there's not even an
opinion. The Office of Civil Rights
simply reminded us that they
must take the (Title IX] regula
tions quite literally," she said.
As it was originally planned,
the feminist studies course was
considered discriminatory
because it separated men and
women into separate discussion
sections and did not offer a phys
ical self-defense section for men.
Although the issue of gender
discrimination falls explicitly
under Title DC, this case is slightly
unusual because it involves both
physical activity — which may
legally be restricted by gender —
and "non-physical" discussion sec
tions, which cannot be segregated
under the federal regulations.
"The problem is that, while
we've long since abandoned the

notion of 'sepa - a b t »qual' in
race, gender is different than
race. There may be some practices
that treat gender differently,"
Sullivan said.
As an example, she "the
football team doesn t j.ave to
admit women but i ph> sics class
must. This course falls right
between separate but equal classes
and 'separate but equal' teams."
With the cancellation of the
course, the Women Defending
Ourselves collective — which had
jointly offered the class with the
Feminist Studies department —
has begun to explore other alter
natives to the gender-separated
course. While nothing has been
resolved yet, the collective said it
hopes to have a proposal ready by
Sunday.
"They're looking at separating
out the physical part of it but leav
ing the rest and possibly doing a
separate section through the Ath
letics Department. That can be
done legally. What's not clear is
whether that can be done while

maintaining the original intent of
the course," said Jeanne
Alcouloumbre, program coordina
tor for the Feminist Studies depart
ment.
But despite the desire to make
the course as effective as possible
for its participants, many of
whom are victims of rape or other
crimes, Brest emphasized that
there could be no special treat
ment under the law for admirable
purposes.
"Considerations such as a good
motive won't be factors that have
force against a literal prohibi
tion," she said.
Sullivan added that, while the
gender-equity laws are still large
ly unresolved, any class specifical
ly separating men and women is
likely to come under fire.
"We still recognize the fact that
privacy justifies separation, as in
the case of restrooms," she said.
But in order to separate this class,
"the justification would have to be
rape survivors vs. non rape-sur
vivors, not just men and women."
