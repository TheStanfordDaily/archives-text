# Title IX violation not constitutional issue
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The cancellation of a women's self-defense
course that may have violated federal gender
equity laws has sparked a debate over constitu
tional issues that has gone all the way from the
Women's Center to a local radio talk show.
People arguing about the Feminist Studies
class — titled "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" — casually toss around constitution
al terms like "separate but equal" or "equal
protection under the law."
But in truth, Stanford's status as a private

school means that the class violates not the
Constitution, but the legislative provisions of
Title IX, Stanford constitutional law experts
say.
"The Constitution governs only state ac
tion, and Stanford is a private university. We
are just like any business subject to employ
ment laws," said Law Prof. Kathleen Sulli
van, a widely recognized constitutional
scholar.
Sullivan added that, in fact, the Title IX pro
visions — which forbid any school receiving
federal funds from discriminating on the basis
of gender — take equality one step further

than the Constitution, which does not specify
equal protection for the sexes.
By accepting federal funds, Stanford must
also choose to accept the specifications of the
legislation. "Title IX is not a prohibition in
gross; it is directed solely to those receiving fed
eral financial aid, in particular educational in
stitutions," said Iris Brest, associate general
counsel of the University.
Brest also stressed that there was no actual
court decision about the self-defense class that
would cause it to be considered a constitution
al case.
