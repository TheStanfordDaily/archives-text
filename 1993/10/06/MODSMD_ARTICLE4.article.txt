# Haas, Financial Aids Office offer community-service job program

Instead of hashing at the din
ing hall for work-study money,
Stanford students may now be
able to get paid for being a Girl
Scout program aide.
This fall, in response to new
federal legislation, the Financial
Aids Office and the Haas Center
for Public Service have begun to
accept applications for paid com
munity-service jobs from stu
dents with work-study eligibility.
The legislation, passed last

year as part of the Higher Educa
tion Act, requires at least 5 per
cent of federal work-study money
to be spent on community service
jobs starting next year.
Although the legislation does
not go into effect until July 1,
1994, Stanford is beginning its
program this year in order to de
termine how difficult it will be to
fulfill the requirements.
According to Sue Gray, who co
ordinates the project for the Haas
Center, previously "no more than
a handful" of the approximately

2,000 Stanford students eligible
for work-study financial aid pre
viously worked for pay in the
community. The Haas Center
hopes to increase that number to
about 80 through the program,
and has begun recruiting stu
dents by listing openings on Folio
and at the Haas Center.
Gray said the program would
allow Stanford students who pre
viously had to choose between
earning money for college and
serving the community to do
both at once.
Job descriptions range from
training and recruiting
HIV/AIDS prevention coun
selors at local high schools to
researching the potential for
campus activism in California.
Gray was unwilling to guess
how many applications she has
already received. She believes,
however, that there are still
plenty of opportunities for appli
cants to find work. Applicants
who are hired should be working
within two weeks, she said.
Gray also believes the pro
gram will be a boon to local com
munity organizations, which
would be able to hire Stanford
students instead of using volun
teers since Stanford and the fed
eral government would pay 90
percent of the student's salary.
