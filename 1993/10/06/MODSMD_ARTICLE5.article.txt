While "The Thinker" sits in the center of campus
as a constant reminder of why the University is
here, few students take the time to understand the
nature of his contemplation.
But Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo hopes to
change all that.
As host of the lecture series, "Mindworks: Talk
ing About Thinking," at the Exploratorium in San
Francisco, Zimbardo will spend several evenings in
vestigating what seems like second nature to most of
UB.
"It's really about the nature of creativity, the psy
chology of creativity," said Zimbardo.
"Are people bora creative or are they stimulated
by certain experiences?" Zimbardo asked. "What are

their sources of stimulation? Are there factors that
inhibit or promote creativity?"
The answers to these questions reveal valuable
insights into the mind and the nature of human
imagination, Zimbardo said.
The lecture series is part of "Psychology: Under
standing Ourselves, Understanding Each Other," a
hands-on exhibition at the Exploratorium. Zimbar
do served as senior project adviser for the exhibi
tion, which continues through Jan. 2.
Anna Deavere Smith, associate professor of
drama, will also participate in the series, delivering
t the opening lecture at 8 p.m. tonight in the Palace of
Fine Arts Theatre.
Smith received international acclaim when her
one-woman play, "Fires in the
Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn
and Other Identities," a runner
up for a Pulitzer Prize, won an
Obie and a Drama Desk Award.
In addition to Smith, the
series features Harvard professor
and psychiatrist Robert Coles on
Oct. 22 and "renaissance man"
Jonathan Miller on Nov. 3, Zim
bardo said.
Coles won the Pulitzer Prize

for his best-selling "Children of
Crisis" trilogy. His book "A Call
to Service" studies idealism and
volunteerism.
Miller, a neurosurgeon and
theatrical director, is known for
hosting the BBC documentary
"The Body in Question." His PBS
series "Madness" explores the
conceptual history of mental ill
ness.
Miller's wide range of accom
plishments make him both fasci
nating and intimidating, Zimbar
do said.
"He was a comedian with Sec
ond City, and he's directed plays

and opera," Zimbardo said. "He
talks in perfect paragraphs —
perfect diction, clear organiza
tion. He's knowledgeable on
more subjects than anyone I
know."
Since the lectures are held in a
non-traditional dialogue format,
Zimbardo anticipates stimulating
discussion.
Although none of the lecturers
are psychologists, they are "cre
ative contributors to our under
standing of human nature" in
their diverse roles as dramatist,
psychiatrist and neurologist,
Zimbardo said.
