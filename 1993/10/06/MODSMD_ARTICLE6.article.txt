# Sex harassment policy formally launched today
## 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
After nearly two years of hag
gling and revisions, the Universi
ty's official sexual harassment
policy will be formally introduced
to the Stanford community today.
The long-awaited final draft,
which will be published in its en
tirety in today's Campus Report,
arrives about four months later
than initially promised by Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper. A
final revision was prepared over
the summer by Casper and re
ceived the Faculty Senate's en
dorsement on Thursday.
"I'm extremely pleased that
Stanford University now has a
clear policy and that our position
can no longer be doubted," Casper
said.
Although the designated advis
ers will not be in place until Jan. 1,
a working group of faculty, staff

and students will begin the
process of implementing the poli
cy immediately, by distributing
information and developing rele
vant programs.
The policy maintains a strong
stance for complainant confiden
tiality, in response to several sug
gestions made by students and
faculty last year, and includes spe
cific procedures, methods of im
plementation and a detailed glos
sary of terms.
In response to changes sug
gested at the Faculty Senate last
week, the policy contains two
minor wording revisions.
Casper, who authored the poli
cy, added a statement that
reprisals against complainants
are illegal and not tolerated.
The other change included the
broadening of possible outcomes
for informal resolutions of sexual
harassment complaints. The policy
now states that, in addition to spe
cific outcomes, "any other appro
priate relief' will be provided to
remedy the problem-
Expanding a complainant's
options was a key objective for the
policy, according to Casper, who
said he believes "we've struck a
very good balance between attempt
ing to protect (complainants) on
the one hand and free speech rights
(on the other)."
One of the main arguments
against previous drafts of the poli
cy targeted the "user-friendliness"
of the text — focusing on every
thing from language choice to gen
eral concepts — in order to avoid
deterring a victim from reporting a
case of harassment.
Casper called the final draft
"very accessible."
"I do not think that any Stan
ford student — who by definition is
bright — will have any problems
(reading or understanding the poli
cy)," said Casper.

Though there was some con
tention about exactly to whom a per
son should first be directed to report
alleged sexual harassment, Casper
rejected several suggestions from
Faculty Senate members to have
complainants bypass department
administrators and first contact the
special team of sexual harassment
advisers set up in the policy.
That sexual harassment advis
ing team was listed as an equal
advisory option with department
chairs, deans and supervisors for
sexual harassment victims to go to.
"Part of the underlying philoso
phy of this policy is that any officer
of the University has responsibility
for (sexual harassment cases),"
said Iris Brest, the University's
associate general counsel.
The sexual harassment advising
team will be headed by a coordinat
ing adviser, chosen by the provost
and, who according to the policy,
will be "an expert trained to
respond to sexual harassment and
is responsible for overseeing the
implementation of the policy."
In addition, the coordinating
adviser will be aided by various
other advisers selected by the
provost, as well as a Sexual Harass

ment Panel, chosen by the presi
dent to "advise and assist adminis
trative officers in investigating or
considering action based upon a
charge of harassment."
Though the harassment policy
officially goes into effect today, the
coordinating adviser, advisers and
panel members will not be chosen
and ready to address problems
until Jan. 1.
"We need to do a lot of consulta
tive work (looking) for the advis
ers," said Provost Condoleezza
Rice, adding that she plans to spend
a considerable amount of time
investigating possible candidates.
Until the official advising team
is in action, Tom Matteoli, director
of employee relations and develop
ment as well as a member of the
polity's work group, recommends
that any sexual harassment vic
tims should talk with deans,
ombudspersons or any other
supervisors listed under the old
policy.
"We are entering the second
track of the sexual harassment pol
icy," Casper said. "It will take a cou
ple of months to implement. Until
then, we will rely on more regular
channels (to deal with cases)."

ceived the Faculty Senate's en
dorsement on Thursday.
"I'm extremely pleased that
Stanford University now has a
clear policy and that our position
can no longer be doubted," Casper
said.
Although the designated advis
ers will not be in place until Jan. 1,
a working group of faculty, staff

and students will begin the
process of implementing the poli
cy immediately, by distributing
information and developing rele
vant programs.
The policy maintains a strong
stance for complainant confiden
tiality, in response to several sug
gestions made by students and
faculty last year, and includes spe
cific procedures, methods of im
plementation and a detailed glos
sary of terms.
In response to changes sug
gested at the Faculty Senate last
week, the policy contains two
minor wording revisions.
Casper, who authored the poli
cy, added a statement that
reprisals against complainants
are illegal and not tolerated.
The other change included the
broadening of possible outcomes
for informal resolutions of sexual
harassment complaints. The policy
now states that, in addition to spe
cific outcomes, "any other appro
priate relief' will be provided to
remedy the problem-
Expanding a complainant's
options was a key objective for the
policy, according to Casper, who
said he believes "we've struck a
very good balance between attempt
ing to protect (complainants) on
the one hand and free speech rights
(on the other)."
One of the main arguments
against previous drafts of the poli
cy targeted the "user-friendliness"
of the text — focusing on every
thing from language choice to gen
eral concepts — in order to avoid
deterring a victim from reporting a
case of harassment.
Casper called the final draft
"very accessible."
"I do not think that any Stan
ford student — who by definition is
bright — will have any problems
(reading or understanding the poli
cy)," said Casper.

Though there was some con
tention about exactly to whom a per
son should first be directed to report
alleged sexual harassment, Casper
rejected several suggestions from
Faculty Senate members to have
complainants bypass department
administrators and first contact the
special team of sexual harassment
advisers set up in the policy.
That sexual harassment advis
ing team was listed as an equal
advisory option with department
chairs, deans and supervisors for
sexual harassment victims to go to.
"Part of the underlying philoso
phy of this policy is that any officer
of the University has responsibility
for (sexual harassment cases),"
said Iris Brest, the University's
associate general counsel.
The sexual harassment advising
team will be headed by a coordinat
ing adviser, chosen by the provost
and, who according to the policy,
will be "an expert trained to
respond to sexual harassment and
is responsible for overseeing the
implementation of the policy."
In addition, the coordinating
adviser will be aided by various
other advisers selected by the
provost, as well as a Sexual Harass

ment Panel, chosen by the presi
dent to "advise and assist adminis
trative officers in investigating or
considering action based upon a
charge of harassment."
Though the harassment policy
officially goes into effect today, the
coordinating adviser, advisers and
panel members will not be chosen
and ready to address problems
until Jan. 1.
"We need to do a lot of consulta
tive work (looking) for the advis
ers," said Provost Condoleezza
Rice, adding that she plans to spend
a considerable amount of time
investigating possible candidates.
Until the official advising team
is in action, Tom Matteoli, director
of employee relations and develop
ment as well as a member of the
polity's work group, recommends
that any sexual harassment vic
tims should talk with deans,
ombudspersons or any other
supervisors listed under the old
policy.
"We are entering the second
track of the sexual harassment pol
icy," Casper said. "It will take a cou
ple of months to implement. Until
then, we will rely on more regular
channels (to deal with cases)."
