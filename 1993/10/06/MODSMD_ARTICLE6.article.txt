### Nami Kim Staff writer 
After nearly two years of hag
gling and revisions, the Universi
ty's official sexual harassment
policy will be formally introduced
to the Stanford community today.
The long-awaited final draft,
which will be published in its en
tirety in today's Campus Report,
arrives about four months later
than initially promised by Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper. A
final revision was prepared over
the summer by Casper and re
ceived the Faculty Senate's en
dorsement on Thursday.
"I'm extremely pleased that
Stanford University now has a
clear policy and that our position
can no longer be doubted," Casper
said.
Although the designated advis
ers will not be in place until Jan. 1,
a working group of faculty, staff

and students will begin the
process of implementing the poli
cy immediately, by distributing
information and developing rele
vant programs.
The policy maintains a strong
stance for complainant confiden
tiality, in response to several sug
gestions made by students and
faculty last year, and includes spe
cific procedures, methods of im
plementation and a detailed glos
sary of terms.
In response to changes sug
gested at the Faculty Senate last
week, the policy contains two
minor wording revisions.
Casper, who authored the poli
cy, added a statement that
reprisals against complainants
are illegal and not tolerated.
The other change included the
broadening of possible outcomes
for informal resolutions of sexual
