# Union says Webb violated bargain
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The management at Universi
ty-owned Webb Ranch is illegally
denying housing to workers, ac
cording to union representatives.
Over the past month the union
has been complaining that the oc
cupation of three of the eight
newly installed trailers — donated
to the ranch by the University in
1992 — violates the collective bar
gaining agreement between Webb
management and the migrant
workers who live at the ranch.
United Stanford Workers field
representative Sammy Brooks
said the Webb family, which runs
the ranch, improperly assumed
authority for assigning housing
and has subsequently turned the
three trailers over to people who
don't have legitimate claims to
them.
According to Brooks, one trail
er is housing a ranch "supervi

sor," another was given to a
worker who was not in line for
the home but was granted one
"because he was friends with
management," and a third is
being occupied by a retired cou
ple.
Gary Webb, co-manager of the
ranch, said the current housing
situation is "absolutely not" a vio
lation of the bargaining agree
ment, which states that "housing
at Webb Ranch is to' be used only
by Webb Ranch employees and
their immediate families during
their period of employment."
The dispute over the trailers
represents the latest in a four-year
dispute over worker-management
relations at the ranch that has
also embroiled University admin
istrators and faculty. Stanford has
leased the 237-acre ranch — locat
ed ofT Alpine Road near Interstate
280 — to the Webb family since
-1922.
The installation of the trailers
has been the subject of consider
able controversy since February,
when inspectors found that the
Webbs had not begun installing
them, and the old residences occu
pied by workers and their families
did not have heat.
Spurred by administrative pres
sure from the University, the
Webbs began work on installing
the new portable trailers, but they
were not finished until late August,
Brooks said, five months after the
deadline set by the union for com
pletion.
The eight families who occupied
the condemned trailers were forced
to move off the ranch into apart
ments in Redwood City and Menlo
Park. Brooks said three families
have been unable to return to the
ranch because of the current situa
tion.
A copy of the agreement
between the workers and the
Webbs states that management

must "contract with the Webb
Ranch Tenant Management Cor
poration for all aspects of housing
management," is "to establish and
enforce rules for tenants, and
establish and regulate occupancies
for employees." The tenant council
is to be comprised of ranch "work
ers/residents."
However, Brooks said that: since
mid-September, when the county
gave final approval to the new trail
er installments, the Webbs have
bypassed the tenant council and
assigned housing on its own.
The most contentious and del
icate issue seems to be that of the
retired couple to whom the
Webbs gave one trailer. "What
Webb Ranch has said about the
retired couple is that they have
the right to the trailer," Brooks
said. "But they are no longer
working, so they shouldn't have
access to it.
Brooks added that the Universi
ty had "donated the trailers to the
union," and therefore they "belong
to the workers."
But Webb said the retired occu
pants "lived here for years and
years, before the trailers were
here." While Webb refused to con

firm or deny Brooks' charges about
who is living in the other trailers,
he claimed that advocates for the
workers "just want pro-union peo
ple who have never lived here
before to have the trailers."
Webb said Augustin Gonzalez,
the Webb employees' union repre
sentative will "say whatever will
stir things up."
Brooks said the USW has
appealed to an impartial judge to
arbitrate the situation, but said
he is worried that the judge
might rule against the workers
rather than risk evicting the resi
dents currently occupying the
trailers.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, who
has been an active supporter of the
ranch workers since a 1989 dispute
over low labor wages, asked Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
to look into the recent develop
ments and issue a response, but
admitted Tuesday that "I don't
expect one."
Casper said yesterday that he
has "asked for more information"
on the dispute and will "try to
make a response at next Thurs
day's (Faculty Senate) meeting if I
can."

denying housing to workers, ac
cording to union representatives.
Over the past month the union
has been complaining that the oc
cupation of three of the eight
newly installed trailers — donated
to the ranch by the University in
1992 — violates the collective bar
gaining agreement between Webb
management and the migrant
workers who live at the ranch.
United Stanford Workers field
representative Sammy Brooks
said the Webb family, which runs
the ranch, improperly assumed
authority for assigning housing
and has subsequently turned the
three trailers over to people who
don't have legitimate claims to
them.
According to Brooks, one trail
er is housing a ranch "supervi

sor," another was given to a
worker who was not in line for
the home but was granted one
"because he was friends with
management," and a third is
being occupied by a retired cou
ple.
Gary Webb, co-manager of the
ranch, said the current housing
situation is "absolutely not" a vio
lation of the bargaining agree
ment, which states that "housing
at Webb Ranch is to' be used only
by Webb Ranch employees and
their immediate families during
their period of employment."
The dispute over the trailers
represents the latest in a four-year
dispute over worker-management
relations at the ranch that has
also embroiled University admin
istrators and faculty. Stanford has
leased the 237-acre ranch — locat
ed ofT Alpine Road near Interstate
280 — to the Webb family since
-1922.
The installation of the trailers
has been the subject of consider
able controversy since February,
when inspectors found that the
Webbs had not begun installing
them, and the old residences occu
pied by workers and their families
did not have heat.
Spurred by administrative pres
sure from the University, the
Webbs began work on installing
the new portable trailers, but they
were not finished until late August,
Brooks said, five months after the
deadline set by the union for com
pletion.
The eight families who occupied
the condemned trailers were forced
to move off the ranch into apart
ments in Redwood City and Menlo
Park. Brooks said three families
have been unable to return to the
ranch because of the current situa
tion.
A copy of the agreement
between the workers and the
Webbs states that management

must "contract with the Webb
Ranch Tenant Management Cor
poration for all aspects of housing
management," is "to establish and
enforce rules for tenants, and
establish and regulate occupancies
for employees." The tenant council
is to be comprised of ranch "work
ers/residents."
However, Brooks said that: since
mid-September, when the county
gave final approval to the new trail
er installments, the Webbs have
bypassed the tenant council and
assigned housing on its own.
The most contentious and del
icate issue seems to be that of the
retired couple to whom the
Webbs gave one trailer. "What
Webb Ranch has said about the
retired couple is that they have
the right to the trailer," Brooks
said. "But they are no longer
working, so they shouldn't have
access to it.
Brooks added that the Universi
ty had "donated the trailers to the
union," and therefore they "belong
to the workers."
But Webb said the retired occu
pants "lived here for years and
years, before the trailers were
here." While Webb refused to con

firm or deny Brooks' charges about
who is living in the other trailers,
he claimed that advocates for the
workers "just want pro-union peo
ple who have never lived here
before to have the trailers."
Webb said Augustin Gonzalez,
the Webb employees' union repre
sentative will "say whatever will
stir things up."
Brooks said the USW has
appealed to an impartial judge to
arbitrate the situation, but said
he is worried that the judge
might rule against the workers
rather than risk evicting the resi
dents currently occupying the
trailers.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, who
has been an active supporter of the
ranch workers since a 1989 dispute
over low labor wages, asked Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
to look into the recent develop
ments and issue a response, but
admitted Tuesday that "I don't
expect one."
Casper said yesterday that he
has "asked for more information"
on the dispute and will "try to
make a response at next Thurs
day's (Faculty Senate) meeting if I
can."
