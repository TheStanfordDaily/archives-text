# Union says Webb violated bargain
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The management at Universi
ty-owned Webb Ranch is illegally
denying housing to workers, ac
cording to union representatives.
Over the past month the union
has been complaining that the oc
cupation of three of the eight
newly installed trailers — donated
to the ranch by the University in
1992 — violates the collective bar
gaining agreement between Webb
management and the migrant
workers who live at the ranch.
United Stanford Workers field
representative Sammy Brooks
said the Webb family, which runs
the ranch, improperly assumed
authority for assigning housing
and has subsequently turned the
three trailers over to people who
don't have legitimate claims to
them.
According to Brooks, one trail
er is housing a ranch "supervi

sor," another was given to a
worker who was not in line for
the home but was granted one
"because he was friends with
management," and a third is
being occupied by a retired cou
ple.
Gary Webb, co-manager of the
ranch, said the current housing
situation is "absolutely not" a vio
lation of the bargaining agree
ment, which states that "housing
at Webb Ranch is to' be used only
by Webb Ranch employees and
their immediate families during
their period of employment."
The dispute over the trailers
represents the latest in a four-year
dispute over worker-management
relations at the ranch that has
also embroiled University admin
istrators and faculty. Stanford has
leased the 237-acre ranch — locat
ed ofT Alpine Road near Interstate
280 — to the Webb family since
