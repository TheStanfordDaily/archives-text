BATMAN'S BEST FRIEND ISN'T
ON THE STREETS TONIGHT
People said thai Commissioner Gordon hod heart He was a tough cop, and proud uf it.
Eating right, exercise, vocations —those things were lor guys not so lough
Tobocco was part of it A smoke would |ump-start the day, help
him get through a long night, mellow out the bod hours.
Then one day all the pom m the world collected in his chest and squeezed
Jim Gordon's heort wasn I working right anymore That mode
it hord to be tough And even harder to be proud
