BATMAN'S SECT FRIEND ISN'T
ON THE STREETS TONIGHT
People soid that Commissioner Gordon hod heart. He was a tough cop, and proud of it.
Eating right, exercise, vacations—those things were for guys not so tough
Tobacco was part of it. A smoke would |ump-starl the day, help

Jim Gordon'? heait wasn't working right anymore That made
it hard >o be tough And even harder to be proud.
