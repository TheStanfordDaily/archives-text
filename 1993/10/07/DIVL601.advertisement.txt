Spring Semester in Film for Visiting Students
"As a media arts and science major at MIT, I was
lacking hands-on filmmaking experience, and the
semester at Tisch Jit right in with what I needed."
— David Kung
David was working with interactive video at MIT and found it
was difficult to think about films of the future without knowing
the filmmaking process. "At Tisch, I learned about every
aspect — writing, casting, shooting, directing, and editing. I did
everything!"
David's new understanding of film has been very valuable to his
work with video. "The Tisch program fulfilled my expectations
and much more; it was an amazing experience."
Each spring, we offer students of all educational backgrounds the
opportunity to leam the fundamentals of filmmaking at the Tisch
School's renowned Department of Film and Television. During
an intensive one-semester program, you can immerse yourself in
v t -\ r the study of film while living in the heart of Greenwich Village.
