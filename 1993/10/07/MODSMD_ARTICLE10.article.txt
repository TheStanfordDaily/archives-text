## Clinton planning troop increase 2,000 more soldiers, heavy weaponry could be sent to Somalia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Deflecting
calls for immediate withdrawal from
Somalia, President Clinton will send in
more American troops while setting a
deadline for ending U.S. military inter
vention in the chaotic African nation,
administration officials said yesterday.
One official said the withdrawal date
had not been "locked on" late yesterday
although the most likely time is late this
year or early next year.
Under one scenario, Clinton would
order between 1,500 and 2,000 more
combat troops and more heavy weapon
ry to protect forces in Somalia as they
await a final pullout, officials said.
There currently are 4,700 forces in
Somalia.
The president is expected to
announce his decisions today after
meeting with congressional leaders.
"It is essential that we conclude our
mission in Somalia but that we do it
with firmness and steadiness of pur
pose," Clinton said at an East Room cer
emony.
The president opened his day by
meeting with foreign policy and military
advisers and then called them back for
more talks later.
"We are anxious to conclude our role
there honorably," Clinton said, "but we
do not want to see a reversion to the
absolute chaos and the terrible misery
which existed before."
Inflamed by the deaths Sunday of 12
Americans and the capture of at least
one U.S. pilot, Congress was torn over
which direction to take.
Senate leaders put off consideration

of a defense-spending biil to spare the
administration possible embarrassment
from amendments demanding a pull
out. Clinton said he would meet with
congressional leaders today and then
announce his course.
"It is not time for panic," said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
In a Senate speech, Dole reminded
colleagues of a resolution passed two
weeks ago asking Clinton to state a
clear policy on Somalia by Oct. 15 and
calling for a congressional vote on the
deployment of troops by Nov. 15.
In a stinging rebuff to the adminis
tration, House Minority Leader Bob
Michel, R-IIL, and 64 GOP colleagues
sent Clinton a letter branding his Soma
lia policy a failure. "America's interna
tional standing must not be jeopardized
by an indecisive and naive approach to
foreign policy," it said.
Moreover, the letter asked Clinton
how he intended to secure the freedom
of any Americans held in Somalia and
requested that he state "your intention
to expeditiously withdraw our forces in
a safe and orderly manner."
Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., rejected
calls for an immediate troop withdraw
al, arguing that such a step would cre
ate problems for American troops else
where.
"We must not send a signal that
encourages adversaries to attack our
troops elsewhere and invite in television
cameras in the hopes of forcing us to
leave," Nunn said in a speech on the
Senate floor.

Should a decision be made to send in
additional forces, they probably would
come from Fort Stewart, Ga., the home
of the 24th Infantry Division (Mecha
nized), a Pentagon official said.
Under that recommendation, there
also would be additional tanks and sev
eral dozen Bradley Fighting Vehicles,
the armored transports with night
vision capabilities.
Clinton met twice yesterday with
senior national security aides, including
Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
Defense Secretary Les Aspin and
Marine Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, the com
mander for the region.
Later, in an appearance in the East
Room for a bill-signing ceremony, Clin
ton referred to the talks as "serious
meetings."
He recalled that U.S. troops were
sent to Somalia after 350,000 people
had died amid anarchy, famine and dis
ease.
"Today we are completing the job of
establishing security in Somalia" and
also taking steps "to prevent that terri
ble crisis (of last year) from occurring as
soon as we are gone," Clinton said.
"We are anxious to conclude our role
there honorably, but we do not want to
see a reversion to the absolute chaos
and the terrible misery which existed
before," the president said.
At the State Department, spokesman
Michael McCurry said Christopher
believes it is not the time "to abruptly
change our posture" regarding the
deployment of U.S. personnel in Soma
lia. "I think that's very clear."
