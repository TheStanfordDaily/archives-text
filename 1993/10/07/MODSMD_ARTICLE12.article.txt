Students should be able
to know which senators
are pursuing their goals

AS A DEMOCRATIC body, the
ASSU Senate has some pecu
liar idiosyncrasies, the most
striking of which is the official dif
ference between graduate and
undergraduate representation in
the senate.
Graduate senators are elected by
individual schools, such as the
School of Engineering, and are
directly accountable to that
school's students.
All 20 undergraduate senators,
in contrast, are elected at large and
represent an undefined constituen
cy among the undergraduate popu
lation. As a consequence, most
undergraduate students have no
idea who their 20 senators are or
which one they would contact if
they were interested in discussing
an issue.
Many of the historical problems
the senate faces — student apathy,
unmotivated senators and poor
communication — could be quickly
addressed by bringing senators
into closer contact with their wide
constituency and giving students
the chance to find out which of
their representatives are doing a
good job and which are not. Until
students can point to an individual
member of the senate and compli
ment or criticize that person's
work, "the senate" will remain the
same nebulous entity of the past
few years, having little direct
accountability to Stanford's 13,000
students.
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf
should take it upon himself to rec
tify this situation in two ways.
First, two undergraduate senators
should be selected to communicate
with each undergraduate resi
dence. Furthermore, information
about all senators and the issues
they are working on should be dis
tributed to both graduate and

undergraduate students and resi
dence staff periodically.
Assigning one voting and one
non-voting senator to each under
graduate residence will give stu
dents an identifiable preliminary
contact within the senate to point
them in the right direction on a
given issue. The assignment pro
cess should attempt to keep a sena
tor's own residence close to his or
her assigned district, and should
distribute evenly the responsibili
ties for freshman and upperclass
residences.
The point needs to be clearly
made, however, that the senators
will only be points of contact and
not the final representatives for
each district. Truly residential dis
tricting would be impractical, *iven
that both students and senators
promptly move to a new residence
after the spring election. In recog
nition of the problem that assigned
senators might have different polit
ical goals from those of their dis
trict, students should be informed
when assignments are announced
that they are welcome to talk to
any member of the senate who is
receptive to their ideas.
To publicize the identity of sena
tors to both graduates and under
graduates, the senate chair should
have flyers distributed that include
the names of each district's sena
tors, along with their phone num
bers. Undergraduate senators
should also distribute these to RAs
as they introduce themselves at
house meetings once or twice a
quarter. A list of all senators and
committees should be distributed
simultaneously, identifying the
issues senators are concerned
about and the preliminary legisla
tion they have drafted.
The democratic process can only
function when the polity has the
tools to participate. Among these
tools, knowing who one's represen
tatives are and what they are work
ing on is of paramount importance.
If the ASSU senators want students
to participate in their work, taking a
few simple steps to identify them
selves is not too much to ask.
