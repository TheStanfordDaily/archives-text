## Diana Akiyama Encourage students to question beliefs 
### 
IT IS TRUE, as Pres
ident Casper has
stated previously in
this column, that we
cannot tell students
what to become. When
I consider my particu
lar work and focus at
Stanford, I must also
add: we cannot tell
students what to

believe. And while I think this point is
critical, it has little real meaning
unless we also understand that stu
dents should be supported and even
encouraged to question what they have
been taught to believe, what others
encourage (sometimes even pressure)
them to believe and what they are com
ing to believe because of their experi
ences and intellectual pursuits. The
process of knowing one's religious or
moral beliefs develops in a process
that, for most of us, is gradual and not
without pain.
College years are very often critical
years for students to explore and deep
en their religious beliefs through ques
tioning others and themselves. In the
past ten years, it has also been a time
for students to examine the world of
religion as a newcomer — there is an
increasing number of students who
have not spent their childhood attend
ing worship services or even discussing
the fact of religion. For others, the

world of faith is one which signifies
conformity, control, guilt and denial.
And still others look for a religious
community or leader which will allow
them to affirm their humanity, warts
and all.
The purpose of such searching is dif
ferent for each person, but the process
must be supported and encouraged by
the University. Recent history at
Stanford reveals a knee-jerk resistance
among staff and faculty to persons
claiming to have religious convictions
and a rich faith practice. This same
history also reveals harsh experiences
of rejection, self-righteous judgment
and manipulation on the part of the
"religious" who are convinced that
their brand of faith is the only valid
one. Stories from the classroom give
evidence of professors being challenged
— not to a rigorous intellectual discus
sion — but to a superficial litmus test
of "do you believe what I believe?"
Clearly, if the answer is not dead-cen
ter "yes" the professor is judged as, at
best, worthy of suspicion and, at worst,
an instrument of the dark forces of
evil. It may be exciting to speak up in
class and accuse a professor of having
the wrong beliefs, but the real substan
tive exchange occurs when judgmental
attitudes are released and a genuine
discussion can take place.
The beauty of studying at a univer
sity is the freedom to explore, question

and change one's mind after gathering
new information. This is true for one's
religious life as well as one's academic
life. If Stanford encourages students to
explore and stretch themselves aca
demically and intellectually, it must
also encourage students to explore and
stretch themselves in their religious
beliefs. If a faith is worth having, it
will stand up to doubts, questions and
intellectual challenge. If a faith com
munity is worth participating in, it will
not select friends for its members, it
will not exercise mind control by build
ing up notions of judgment and superi
ority ("we are 'saved', they are not"),
and most importantly, it will not posit
an opposition between exploring one's
intellectual life and exploring one's
faith life.
The challenge of getting the most
out of a liberal arts education at Stan
ford is not to make an art out of being
liberal, rather it is to cultivate one's
growth and development as a whole
person while continually favoring the
freedom of individuals to express
themselves in a manner which they
have chosen for themselves. This is an
ideal educational setting in which to
explore one's religious life and beliefs.
Stanford has a wealth of resources to
assist in the journey.
