## A
						scoring sensation, Martin continues to excel 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Before basking in the glitz and glory, freshman
athletes at Stanford must quickly learn a sense of
balance to survive. Not only physical balance and
the coordination to compete at the collegiate level,
but also the ability to combine the rigors of the
sport with the occasional early morning lecture or
CIV paper.

For women's soccer player Erin Martin, balance
has been a necessity more than a virtue. As a fresh
mem this year, she has had to combine up to four
hours a day of soccer practice with a typical fresh
man classload of CIV, calculus and the bane of all
late-sleepers, Civil Engineering 170 at 8 a.m. three
days a week.
"It seems like I don't have any free time,"
lamented Martin. "I'm working it out all right, but
soccer and class take all my time. Especially if I

have to go to the training room before or after prac
tice, it's more like 2-6 p.m. (rather than just the
regular 3-5 practice). And CE 170 at eight is bru
tal."
However, Martin has apparently made the tran
sition from high school to college without losing a
step. Halfway through her rookie season, Martin
leads the team in goals scored with 10 and is tied
for first with senior Sarah Rafanelli at 24 total
points.
"Coming in to the program, I just wanted to con
tribute as much as I could to the team," Martin
said. "I knew there were a lot of good players
around me, and I just wanted to fit in around that."
She has definitely made her presence felt on the
soccer field. Often rallying the Cardinal by scoring
its first goal of the game, her quick-striking ability
has kept opponents back on their heels. With Mar
tin averaging one goal every 5.3 shots, opposing
fullbacks and goalkeepers have difficulty defending
her excellent footwork and speed around the goal
box, giving her numerous scoring chances every
game.
"Erin's one of those players who can read the
game very well," said coach lan Sawyers. "Her
technical and tactical awareness allows her to
manipulate defenses."
"Erin's a very creative player," added San Diego
State women's soccer coach Leslie Gallimore. "She
has outstanding finishing ability."
Martin has scored in seven consecutive games,
with the highlight of her short Stanford career
coming in the fifth game of the streak. Facing an
overmatched Arkansas-Little Rock team, she put
the game out of reach early on, scoring two of her
three goals for the game in the first thirty min
utes.
An Arcadia, Calif., native, she grew up playing
soccer with her friends. "When I was five, a moth
er of a friend of mine signed her up for soccer, and
I just thought it would be fun. I played one year,
and just kept on playing," Martin said.
A first-team All-California Interstate Federa
tion selection for four years in high school, Martin
set an amazing national scoring record of 288
goals. Her best goal-scoring year was her junior
season, when she found the back of the net a phe
nomenal 93 times.
Through her hard work, Martin has played her
way into the U.S. National Under-20 pool, a train
ing system used to determine the Women's Nation

al Team. She is joined by Stanford teammates Jes
sica Fischer, Carmel Murphy and Stacy Cook on
the Under-20 team.
Narrowing her decision down from six or seven
schools to just Stanford and North Carolina, Mar
tin decided to stay in California despite the Tar
Heels' women's soccer dynasty spanning seven
straight national championships.
"[ln] the overall picture of Stanford, I could see
myself fitting in better," Martin said. "Academical
ly, it speaks for itself. If I picked North Carolina, it
would have been just for the soccer team. I didn't
think I should do that. Eventually, a team is going
to beat North Carolina, and I want to be on that
team."
Martin and the Cardinal will get their chance
when Stanford and North Carolina face off October
17 at the Challenge College Classic in Houston,
Texas. This tournament will be the second major
test this season of Martin's composure and confi
dence — the first came against Notre Dame last
weekend.
"Erin's ability around the box separates her
from other players," Sawyers said. "When most
players are losing their heads in that pressure situ
ation, she's looking to score or advance the ball to
her teammates."
Among those teammates are the All-American
Rafanelli and second team All-Far West selections
Fischer and Murphy.
"When you come into the [Stanford] program,"
Martin said, "they're already a good team, and you
just step in add to that. You have a lot of support
around you. I'm really lucky to be able to play with
[Rafanelli] for a year."
Martin's praise for her teammates is reciprocat
ed in their reactions toward this first-year phenom.
"Erin's an awesome player," Rafanelli said. "I
love to play with her because she's so exciting. She
came in with a lot of confidence, which is difficult
because the college game is so different, so much
more physical.
"She's a pretty quiet player, but she's technical
ly amazing around the box. Not only are the other
teams' keepers surprised, but Erin surprises us
with the great placement of some of her shots."
Martin's goals for her four-year career are mod
est, to say the least. "I want to improve, I don't
want to get to a certain level and then plateau. Of
course, I want to win a couple of national titles in
there too."
