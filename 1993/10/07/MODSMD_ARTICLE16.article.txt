# East Coast Blues: a volley ball story
## 
### 
I think the best excuse for
my ignorance is that I'm from
a small, private, all-boys
school on the east coast. Vol
leyball just isn't popular
there.
Not popular? Well, to my
recollection, it wasn't even
played. Gyms were for basket
ball; nets were for tennis.
The fall was for football;

the spring was
for baseball. Vol
leyball was one of
those sports like
handball and
curling Ameri
cans played at
the Olympics to
humor other
countries. When
I thought of vol
leyball, I thought
of a guy with

â€” n
weird hair and a friend of his
with an equally weird name
that I would see jumping
around on the sand on ESPN.
Okay, okay, so I wasn't
only ignorant. I was just plain
dumb. But I found it hard to
take seriously a sport whose
major venue was the beach
and whose attire consisted of
skimpy bathing suits and
those hideous Oakley sun
glasses that make everyone
look like a Terminator wanna
be. I enjoyed boogie-boarding,
throwing a frisbee and playing
that funky tennis game with
the big plastic rackets and the
little rubber ball as much as
anybody. But I wasn't about
to consider them major athlet
ic contests either.
Go ahead. Call me athleti
cally sheltered, you southern
Californians. But the closest I
came to playing volleyball was
nuke 'em, a great elementan'-
school sport whose popularity
died out in high school. For
those not familiar, nuke 'em is
played on a volleyball court
with the same number of play
ers. But instead of hitting the
ball, you catch it and then
throw it back over the net.

Even for uncoordinated first
graders, a single rally could go
on for all of recess.
Unfortunately for its popu
larity, in about fifth grade
someone discovered that if
you pass the ball to the tall kid
standing at the net, he could
slam-dunk it to the other side
of the court. Rallies started to
last about two seconds and we

short players
began to look
for a different
sport.
Sure we
played some
volleyball in
P.E. in junior
high, along
with square
dancing and
dodge ball.
Honestly, the

sport was too damn hard to
ever captivate me and my
friends. The only cool thing
we had seen on TV during vol
leyball matches was spiking,
and we could barely get a
serve over the net, much less
even dream about putting
away a kill. And besides we
had much more important
dreams. Like trying to dunk a
basketball.
So, with these volleyball
views, I matriculated to Stan
ford. I saw my first volleyball
game (really, the first time I
had ever watched a match
live) during Orientation. I
must have been vaguely
impressed, but with all the
whirl and excitement of frosh
hood my only volleyball game
got entangled with other
memories of Stanfordopoly
and a cappella singing groups.
And that was it. Sure, I
went to a few more women's
games that year, but never to
actually watch the match. Vol
leyball games were more a
social gathering than a specta
tor sport. When the spring
came I attended a grand total
