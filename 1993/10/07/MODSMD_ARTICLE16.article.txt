# East Coast Blues: a volley ball story
## 
### 
I think the best excuse for
my ignorance is that I'm from
a small, private, all-boys
school on the east coast. Vol
leyball just isn't popular
there.
Not popular? Well, to my
recollection, it wasn't even
played. Gyms were for basket
ball; nets were for tennis.
The fall was for football;

the spring was
for baseball. Vol
leyball was one of
those sports like
handball and
curling Ameri
cans played at
the Olympics to
humor other
countries. When
I thought of vol
leyball, I thought
of a guy with

— n
weird hair and a friend of his
with an equally weird name
that I would see jumping
around on the sand on ESPN.
Okay, okay, so I wasn't
only ignorant. I was just plain
dumb. But I found it hard to
take seriously a sport whose
major venue was the beach
and whose attire consisted of
skimpy bathing suits and
those hideous Oakley sun
glasses that make everyone
look like a Terminator wanna
be. I enjoyed boogie-boarding,
throwing a frisbee and playing
that funky tennis game with
the big plastic rackets and the
little rubber ball as much as
anybody. But I wasn't about
to consider them major athlet
ic contests either.
Go ahead. Call me athleti
cally sheltered, you southern
Californians. But the closest I
came to playing volleyball was
nuke 'em, a great elementan'-
school sport whose popularity
died out in high school. For
those not familiar, nuke 'em is
played on a volleyball court
with the same number of play
ers. But instead of hitting the
ball, you catch it and then
throw it back over the net.

Even for uncoordinated first
graders, a single rally could go
on for all of recess.
Unfortunately for its popu
larity, in about fifth grade
someone discovered that if
you pass the ball to the tall kid
standing at the net, he could
slam-dunk it to the other side
of the court. Rallies started to
last about two seconds and we

short players
began to look
for a different
sport.
Sure we
played some
volleyball in
P.E. in junior
high, along
with square
dancing and
dodge ball.
Honestly, the

sport was too damn hard to
ever captivate me and my
friends. The only cool thing
we had seen on TV during vol
leyball matches was spiking,
and we could barely get a
serve over the net, much less
even dream about putting
away a kill. And besides we
had much more important
dreams. Like trying to dunk a
basketball.
So, with these volleyball
views, I matriculated to Stan
ford. I saw my first volleyball
game (really, the first time I
had ever watched a match
live) during Orientation. I
must have been vaguely
impressed, but with all the
whirl and excitement of frosh
hood my only volleyball game
got entangled with other
memories of Stanfordopoly
and a cappella singing groups.
And that was it. Sure, I
went to a few more women's
games that year, but never to
actually watch the match. Vol
leyball games were more a
social gathering than a specta
tor sport. When the spring
came I attended a grand total


Rob
Ross
of zero men's games. That's right,
I didn't even enter Burnham while
the men were on the floor.
With those impressive creden
tials I requested the men's volley
ball beat last year at The Daily. I
understood that I wasn't really
qualified, and I had watched
enough Intramural volleyball to
know there were some real volley
ball fanatics on campus. But I had
heard coach Neives was affable, and
I could probably get in three articles
a week. I might even get to travel.
Before my first meeting with
Neives, I studied my press guide
carefully. I didn't want the head
coach to think he had an idiot cov
ering his sport. I remember two of
the questions I had written down
were, "Tell me about this hitter
Dave Gross." and "Is this a mis
print, or is your setter's name
actually Canyon Ceman?" As
Nieves talked of swing hitters and
back sets, I realized that I had
found where all the tall guys who
kept playing nuke 'em ended up.
I left that meeting secure in the
belief that I knew nothing about
my assigned sport and I was prob
ably the person on campus least
qualified to write about it. I was
pretty low.
Then I started going to the
games and actually watching
them. With the help of a few of
the guys from Sports Info, I began
to understand at least some of
what was going on. And, most
importantly, I began to enjoy the
matches.
Volleyball, I have learned, is an

intrinsically powerful sport. Other
sports have flashes of power, like a
strong safety about to smash
through a slanting tight end, or a
rocket-armed right-hander about
to throw a bullet across the plate.
But I can't think of another sport
in which there are so many
moments of tremendous power.
Each time a hitter elevates
upwards to meet the set and drive
the ball downwards I am overcome
with the thought, "Damn, he's
about to pound that ball through
the floor.
I grew to become a great fan of
the sport by the time the men's
season was over. So when given
the opportunity to help broadcast
the women's matches on KZSU
this fall, I gobbled it up. I knew the
men's game pretty well. How dif
ferent could the women's be?
How dumb could I be? The
women play an entirely different
game from the men. The kills are
slower; the rallies are longer. The
men'B game is dominated by huge,
pounding opposite hitters. The
women's game, conversely, tends
to be dominated by acrobatic
defensive players who lay out for
every dig. Although different, the
sport is just as interesting for
those who want to see seven great
plays per rally, rather than just
one or two.
Which brings us to this week
end. Just a year ago I would have
thought it was a dead weekend for
Cardinal athletics. Now I have
seen the volleyball light, so to
speak. Four of the best women's
teams in the country will be facing
off this Friday and Saturday night
in Maples in one of the strongest
pre-NCAA tournaments this year.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

in which there are so many
moments of tremendous power.
Each time a hitter elevates
upwards to meet the set and drive
the ball downwards I am overcome
with the thought, "Damn, he's
about to pound that ball through
the floor.
I grew to become a great fan of
the sport by the time the men's
season was over. So when given
the opportunity to help broadcast
the women's matches on KZSU
this fall, I gobbled it up. I knew the
men's game pretty well. How dif
ferent could the women's be?
How dumb could I be? The
women play an entirely different
game from the men. The kills are
slower; the rallies are longer. The
men'B game is dominated by huge,
pounding opposite hitters. The
women's game, conversely, tends
to be dominated by acrobatic
defensive players who lay out for
every dig. Although different, the
sport is just as interesting for
those who want to see seven great
plays per rally, rather than just
one or two.
Which brings us to this week
end. Just a year ago I would have
thought it was a dead weekend for
Cardinal athletics. Now I have
seen the volleyball light, so to
speak. Four of the best women's
teams in the country will be facing
off this Friday and Saturday night
in Maples in one of the strongest
pre-NCAA tournaments this year.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I think the best excuse for
my ignorance is that I'm from
a small, private, all-boys
school on the east coast. Vol
leyball just isn't popular
there.
Not popular? Well, to my
recollection, it wasn't even
played. Gyms were for basket
ball; nets were for tennis.
The fall was for football;

the spring was
for baseball. Vol
leyball was one of
those sports like
handball and
curling Ameri
cans played at
the Olympics to
humor other
countries. When
I thought of vol
leyball, I thought
of a guy with

— n
weird hair and a friend of his
with an equally weird name
that I would see jumping
around on the sand on ESPN.
Okay, okay, so I wasn't
only ignorant. I was just plain
dumb. But I found it hard to
take seriously a sport whose
major venue was the beach
and whose attire consisted of
skimpy bathing suits and
those hideous Oakley sun
glasses that make everyone
look like a Terminator wanna
be. I enjoyed boogie-boarding,
throwing a frisbee and playing
that funky tennis game with
the big plastic rackets and the
little rubber ball as much as
anybody. But I wasn't about
to consider them major athlet
ic contests either.
Go ahead. Call me athleti
cally sheltered, you southern
Californians. But the closest I
came to playing volleyball was
nuke 'em, a great elementan'-
school sport whose popularity
died out in high school. For
those not familiar, nuke 'em is
played on a volleyball court
with the same number of play
ers. But instead of hitting the
ball, you catch it and then
throw it back over the net.

Even for uncoordinated first
graders, a single rally could go
on for all of recess.
Unfortunately for its popu
larity, in about fifth grade
someone discovered that if
you pass the ball to the tall kid
standing at the net, he could
slam-dunk it to the other side
of the court. Rallies started to
last about two seconds and we

short players
began to look
for a different
sport.
Sure we
played some
volleyball in
P.E. in junior
high, along
with square
dancing and
dodge ball.
Honestly, the

sport was too damn hard to
ever captivate me and my
friends. The only cool thing
we had seen on TV during vol
leyball matches was spiking,
and we could barely get a
serve over the net, much less
even dream about putting
away a kill. And besides we
had much more important
dreams. Like trying to dunk a
basketball.
So, with these volleyball
views, I matriculated to Stan
ford. I saw my first volleyball
game (really, the first time I
had ever watched a match
live) during Orientation. I
must have been vaguely
impressed, but with all the
whirl and excitement of frosh
hood my only volleyball game
got entangled with other
memories of Stanfordopoly
and a cappella singing groups.
And that was it. Sure, I
went to a few more women's
games that year, but never to
actually watch the match. Vol
leyball games were more a
social gathering than a specta
tor sport. When the spring
came I attended a grand total


Rob
Ross
of zero men's games. That's right,
I didn't even enter Burnham while
the men were on the floor.
With those impressive creden
tials I requested the men's volley
ball beat last year at The Daily. I
understood that I wasn't really
qualified, and I had watched
enough Intramural volleyball to
know there were some real volley
ball fanatics on campus. But I had
heard coach Neives was affable, and
I could probably get in three articles
a week. I might even get to travel.
Before my first meeting with
Neives, I studied my press guide
carefully. I didn't want the head
coach to think he had an idiot cov
ering his sport. I remember two of
the questions I had written down
were, "Tell me about this hitter
Dave Gross." and "Is this a mis
print, or is your setter's name
actually Canyon Ceman?" As
Nieves talked of swing hitters and
back sets, I realized that I had
found where all the tall guys who
kept playing nuke 'em ended up.
I left that meeting secure in the
belief that I knew nothing about
my assigned sport and I was prob
ably the person on campus least
qualified to write about it. I was
pretty low.
Then I started going to the
games and actually watching
them. With the help of a few of
the guys from Sports Info, I began
to understand at least some of
what was going on. And, most
importantly, I began to enjoy the
matches.
Volleyball, I have learned, is an

intrinsically powerful sport. Other
sports have flashes of power, like a
strong safety about to smash
through a slanting tight end, or a
rocket-armed right-hander about
to throw a bullet across the plate.
But I can't think of another sport
in which there are so many
moments of tremendous power.
Each time a hitter elevates
upwards to meet the set and drive
the ball downwards I am overcome
with the thought, "Damn, he's
