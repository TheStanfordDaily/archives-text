Scrums, shuttlecocks and judo,
oh my!
The Club Sports department
kicked off its 1993-94 season with
an informational meeting for all 22
club-sport teams last night. Of the
sports represented at the meeting,
only eight will be seeing action dur
ing the fall season:
Ice Hockey
The hockey team hits the ice next
Friday and Saturday against the
University of Pacific. The games will
be the first of the season for a team
that is looking to battle back from
last year's iryury-plagued season.
Team captain Cory Sammons
feels confindent that the Cardinal
can repeat last season's success:
"The return of so many players who

were injury-ridden last season gives
us a great chance of winning the
Pacific Collegiate Hockey Associa
tion Championship again."
Rugby
Men's rugby began practice for its
fall season on Monday. The ruggers
will see their first action during the
first weekend of November at the
Michelob Continental Rugby Classic
in Tuscon, Ariz. Stanford placed sec
ond in the tournament last year.
The team returns seven starters
from last year's "A" side, including
potential All-Americans Justin
Davis and Vince Otoupal.
Lacrosse
The men's and women's lacrosse
teams begin their seasons with an
organizational meeting this Satur
day. The women's team, which

becomes a varsity team next year,
will train during the fall. The men's
squad plays its first game against
the University of Massachusetts at
the end of October. The team's only
other scrimmage for the fall season
will be against California.
Ultimate Frisbee
Also seeing action this fall are
the men's and women's ultimate
frisbee teams, who are currently
gearing up for the open season,
which consists of invitational tour
naments and competition with
semi-pro ultimate teams. This dif
fers from the spring season, which
is intercollegiate.
The more experienced players on
the teams will head to UC-Davis this
weekend to compete in sectional
play. If the squads excel at section
als, they will move onto regional

competition with the hope of quali
fying for nationals.
With the return of 10 to 12 "A"-
side players and three or four newly
acquired graduate students, the
men's team will have both experi
ence and depth. Team captains
Brian Cameras and Terry Cussen
will try to bring it all together in time
for a successful season. Meanwhile,
the women's team will look to team
captains Tish Clark and Berkeley
Young and 12 returning starters for
leadership and experience.
Equestrian
For the horse-lovers on campus,
there is the equestrian team. The
Cardinal will take a group of riders —
beginners and experts — to Cal-State
Fresno for an invitational tourna
ment on Oct. 23-24. There, the team
will face UC-Davis, Cal-Poly, USC
and possibly the University of Nevada
at Reno.
Running
The running club began kicking up
its heels on Monday at Angell Field.
The club is less structured in areas of
competition, allowing individuals to
enter races at their own pace, as well
as enter the team competitions.
Badminton
The badminton team began hit
ting the shuttlecocks on Tuesday
under the leadership of new coach
Bill Pickthorn. Pickthorn, one of
the top badminton coaches in the
country, looks to improve upon last
year's young team by utilizing the
experience of team captains Karen
Hales and Ken Lim.
Racquetball
Stanford raquetball begins its
fall season on Oct. 11 with an
important informational meeting
at Lantana dorm, from 7-8:30 p.m.
The raquetball team will begin
competition on Nov. 4-5, when it
enters the Davis Tournament. The
tournament, held at UC-Davis,
will feature BYU, California,
UCLA and Sacramento State Uni

Other club teams that are
still active, but do not start com
petition this fall, are bowling,
judo, horse-polo, skiing, squash,
