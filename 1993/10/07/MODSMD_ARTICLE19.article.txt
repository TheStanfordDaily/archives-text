Sarah Hallock said all she want
ed to do was play well and win
some games on the current road
trip.
Guess what? She not only
played well yesterday, she led
Stanford's field hockey team to a 4-
0 trouncing of Ohio at Columbus.
Hallock's second hat trick of the
week gives her a team-leading sea
son total of 14 goals, which sur
passes her total from last year.
Ohio (6-4) had been playing well
coming into yesterday's meeting,
allowing just over one goal per game.
Stanford (4-4), on the other hand,
has recently had a difficult time win
ning, dropping two of its last three.
Even so, the Bobcats could not han
dle the Cardinal's offense.
One minute into the game, Hal
lock hit senior Kris ten Bowman
with a crisp pass after beating her
defender. Bowman then reverse
stick-stopped the ball and fired it
past charging Bobcat goal tender
Gretchen Bush for her first goal of
the season
"Our passing was working real
ly well," said assistant coach Stacy
Gilburg. "We weren't trying to
dribble too much. We were doing a
lot of two-touch passing."
Cardinal goaltenders Loretta
Hidalgo and Kory Taylor split
playing time yesterday and only
had to make three combined saves,
while holding the Bobcats score
less. Stanford's defense, anchored
by seniors Markley Bavinger and

Danielle Beynet, was «cnetrable
once again, posting their second
straight shutout.
"Every time they had a break
away we stopped it," Gilburg said.
"It was an awesome game. It was
our best game of the season. "
Today's opponent, Ohio State,

watched from the sidelines as Elise
Morgan and Danielle Beynet
assisted Hallock in her second and
third goals of the game, during the
second half of Stanford domi
nance.
"In Europe, field hockey is huge
and [Ohio State] has a lot of for

eign players, who have been play
ing since they were born," Gilburg
said. "They beat Ohio 3-0, so it
should be a good game.
"We surprised a lot of people.
They didn't know what to expect.
Now they realize that we are a top
-20 team."
