# Graduate group revolts against ASSU fee policy
## Students to publicize refund process 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Student organizations could
lose a large chunk of their fund
ing this year if a group of gradu
ate students succeeds in increas
ing the volume of ASSU fee re
funds.
This group currently plans to
demonstrate the power of their
money by educating other gradu
ate students this week about the
refund process — which lets them
choose which student groups they
want to fund, and allows them to
get part or all of their ASSU fees
back. Students can receive a max
imum fee refund of about $35
each quarter, depending on how
many groups they choose to sup
port.
Michael Grant, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Engineering
who is working on the refund
drive, said group members "are
going to set up computer stations
at several graduate parties on

campus this weekend.
"For off-campus students,
we're going to have 'happy hours'
during the next week," he said,
adding that the events will "hope
fully get a lot of publicity."
Grant — along with Karen
Seta, a student in the School of
Medicine — is organizing the ef
fort to educate students about the
special-fee process in an attempt
to force the ASSU to reassess the
value of the graduate students, he
said.
"The ASSU has not tradition
ally worked to provide services for
the graduate students," admitted
COP member Ron Brown. "One
of the things that we need to do is
assess the needs of graduate stu
dents and then determine what
services we can provide them."
The largely undergraduate
oriented ASSU has already come
under fire this year from graduate
students.
