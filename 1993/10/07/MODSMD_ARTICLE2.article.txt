# Graduate group revolts against ASSU fee policy
## Students to publicize refund process 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Student organizations could
lose a large chunk of their fund
ing this year if a group of gradu
ate students succeeds in increas
ing the volume of ASSU fee re
funds.
This group currently plans to
demonstrate the power of their
money by educating other gradu
ate students this week about the
refund process — which lets them
choose which student groups they
want to fund, and allows them to
get part or all of their ASSU fees
back. Students can receive a max
imum fee refund of about $35
each quarter, depending on how
many groups they choose to sup
port.
Michael Grant, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Engineering
who is working on the refund
drive, said group members "are
going to set up computer stations
at several graduate parties on

campus this weekend.
"For off-campus students,
we're going to have 'happy hours'
during the next week," he said,
adding that the events will "hope
fully get a lot of publicity."
Grant — along with Karen
Seta, a student in the School of
Medicine — is organizing the ef
fort to educate students about the
special-fee process in an attempt
to force the ASSU to reassess the
value of the graduate students, he
said.
"The ASSU has not tradition
ally worked to provide services for
the graduate students," admitted
COP member Ron Brown. "One
of the things that we need to do is
assess the needs of graduate stu
dents and then determine what
services we can provide them."
The largely undergraduate
oriented ASSU has already come
under fire this year from graduate
students.
"They need to address issues
like graduate housing that are
not being assigned enough impor
tance," Seta said.
This conflict between graduate
and undergraduate students
came to the forefront in May,
when the ASSU Senate voted
unanimously to split the special
fee election in such a way that
each half vail only fund the stu
dent groups that it approves.
However, this split was voted
on after last year's General Elec
tion, so graduates and under
graduates still fund the same
groups — which is at the root of
the refund drive.
Students must approve the
split in an election this year
before it can take effect.
Brown said such changes
should ease the funding process.
"Hopefully we can clear up
some of the misunderstandings
of the special-fees process and the
ASSU," said Brown. "Many stu
dents believe that their fees go
directly to the ASSU and are
wasted. ... I hope the grad stu
dents will recognize that these
groups contribute a great deal to

the community."
But Seta said that they "don't
necessarily want people to take
all of their money back from all of
the groups — we just want them
to know the option exists."
Despite this claim, both Grant
and Seta admitted that their pro
ject is a reflection of their dissat
isfaction with the ASSU and the
special-fee process in general.
"Personally, I'm planning on
getting all my fees back," said
Grant. "I want it to be a blanket
political statement that the fees
process is broken.
"We don't believe that under
graduates should have any power
over graduate activities like the
Graduate Student Association,"
he added.
Last spring, only five of the 32
special fees on the ballot were
rejected by students in the Gen
eral Election. Two of those were
the GSA and the Stanford
Wilderness Educational Active
orientation Trips — the only spe
cial fees aimed specifically at
graduate students.
But according to senate chair
Greg Waldorf, a graduate student
in the School of Business, the
problems with the special-fee sys
tem run deeper than Seta and
Grant might think.
"The problem with the lack of

approval for GSA is just one of the
problems with special fees," he
said. The system "allows a major
ity of voters to encumber the
entire student body. . . . The
problem is that very few people
vote."
Waldorf argued that graduate
students' voting habits do not
necessarily reflect the level of
their desire to participate. "It's
natural that undergraduates
tend to be more cohesive and are
doing more things outside the
classroom," he said. "Graduate
students are in a different place
in their lives."
But he agreed that some
reforms do need to take place. "I
do not want to split the ASSU,"
he said, adding that he would like
graduate students to "feel they're
getting something out of the
ASSU."
"Undergraduates have to
understand that graduate stu
dents took it as quite an insult
when the undergraduate commu
nity voted down the only two
graduate-focused special fees on
the ballot," Waldorf said.
"If undergraduates want grad
uates to continue to support their
special fees they should recipro
cate," he added, stressing the
importance of cooperation
between the two groups.

split in an election this year
before it can take effect.
Brown said such changes
should ease the funding process.
"Hopefully we can clear up
some of the misunderstandings
of the special-fees process and the
ASSU," said Brown. "Many stu
dents believe that their fees go
directly to the ASSU and are
wasted. ... I hope the grad stu
dents will recognize that these
groups contribute a great deal to

the community."
But Seta said that they "don't
necessarily want people to take
all of their money back from all of
the groups — we just want them
to know the option exists."
Despite this claim, both Grant
and Seta admitted that their pro
ject is a reflection of their dissat
isfaction with the ASSU and the
special-fee process in general.
"Personally, I'm planning on
getting all my fees back," said
Grant. "I want it to be a blanket
political statement that the fees
process is broken.
"We don't believe that under
graduates should have any power
over graduate activities like the
Graduate Student Association,"
he added.
Last spring, only five of the 32
special fees on the ballot were
rejected by students in the Gen
eral Election. Two of those were
the GSA and the Stanford
Wilderness Educational Active
orientation Trips — the only spe
cial fees aimed specifically at
graduate students.
But according to senate chair
Greg Waldorf, a graduate student
in the School of Business, the
problems with the special-fee sys
tem run deeper than Seta and
Grant might think.
"The problem with the lack of

approval for GSA is just one of the
problems with special fees," he
said. The system "allows a major
ity of voters to encumber the
entire student body. . . . The
problem is that very few people
vote."
Waldorf argued that graduate
students' voting habits do not
necessarily reflect the level of
their desire to participate. "It's
natural that undergraduates
tend to be more cohesive and are
doing more things outside the
classroom," he said. "Graduate
students are in a different place
in their lives."
But he agreed that some
reforms do need to take place. "I
do not want to split the ASSU,"
he said, adding that he would like
graduate students to "feel they're
getting something out of the
ASSU."
"Undergraduates have to
understand that graduate stu
dents took it as quite an insult
when the undergraduate commu
nity voted down the only two
graduate-focused special fees on
the ballot," Waldorf said.
"If undergraduates want grad
uates to continue to support their
special fees they should recipro
cate," he added, stressing the
importance of cooperation
between the two groups.
Student organizations could
lose a large chunk of their fund
ing this year if a group of gradu
ate students succeeds in increas
ing the volume of ASSU fee re
funds.
This group currently plans to
demonstrate the power of their
money by educating other gradu
ate students this week about the
refund process — which lets them
choose which student groups they
want to fund, and allows them to
get part or all of their ASSU fees
back. Students can receive a max
imum fee refund of about $35
each quarter, depending on how
many groups they choose to sup
port.
Michael Grant, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Engineering
who is working on the refund
drive, said group members "are
going to set up computer stations
at several graduate parties on

campus this weekend.
"For off-campus students,
we're going to have 'happy hours'
during the next week," he said,
adding that the events will "hope
fully get a lot of publicity."
Grant — along with Karen
Seta, a student in the School of
Medicine — is organizing the ef
fort to educate students about the
special-fee process in an attempt
to force the ASSU to reassess the
value of the graduate students, he
said.
"The ASSU has not tradition
ally worked to provide services for
the graduate students," admitted
COP member Ron Brown. "One
of the things that we need to do is
assess the needs of graduate stu
dents and then determine what
services we can provide them."
The largely undergraduate
oriented ASSU has already come
under fire this year from graduate
students.
"They need to address issues
like graduate housing that are
not being assigned enough impor
tance," Seta said.
This conflict between graduate
and undergraduate students
came to the forefront in May,
when the ASSU Senate voted
unanimously to split the special
fee election in such a way that
each half vail only fund the stu
dent groups that it approves.
However, this split was voted
on after last year's General Elec
tion, so graduates and under
graduates still fund the same
groups — which is at the root of
the refund drive.
