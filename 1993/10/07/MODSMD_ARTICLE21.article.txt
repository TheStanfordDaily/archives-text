## 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
•October 1987: University
President Donald Kennedy
commissions the UCMI Report
in response to the demands of
the Rainbow Agenda, a coali
tion of campus ethnic commu
nities.
•April 5, 1989: After 18
months, the 244-page UCMI
final report is released to the
public — six months after the
original deadline of October
1988.
•May 15, 1989: The Students
of Color Coalition — a reorga
nization of the Rainbow Agen
da — and the ASSU Committee
on Democracy in Education,
Council of Presidents and Sen
ate, frustrated with what they
perceived as a lack of support
for multicultural issues and
the dismissal of student opin
ion, take over Kennedy's office
and barricade it for nine hours.
The takeover — which resulted
in 55 arrests — was followed by
a rally the next day in White
Plaza, attended by 500 stu
dents.
•June 6, 1989: Associate Dean
of Graduate Studies Cecilia
Burciaga is appointed to oversee
the implementation of the
UCMI recommendations as
senior assoc. provost/affirma
tive action officer. As part of her
job description, Burciaga is to
chair an annual review panel on
progress toward UCMI goals.
•Nov. 14, 1989: The staff sub
committee of UCMI releases a
30-page report based on a poll
of University staff members.
The report's findings show
staff of color have significantly
lower morale and confidence in
Stanford as an employer, draw
ing attention and concern.
•Dec. 6, 1989: After Kennedy
releases the UCMI Progress
Report, his office creates the
first UCMI Annual Review
Panel. The Affirmative Action
Office moves to Building 10,
which houses the president's
office.
•Januapr 1990: The Affirma
tive Action Office becomes the
Office for Multicultural Devel
opment as director Sharon
Parker takes over. The Office
of Multicultural Develop
ment's role is boosted to the
same level on the administra
tive ladder as the University
vice presidents, and is charged
with overseeing the UCMI

review process.
•September 1990: The first
UCMI annual review panel,
consisting of faculty, staff, stu
dents, alumni and outside
experts, releases its report. The
report praises University offi
cials for their efforts to address
UCMI's concerns, but con
cludes that progress was insuf
ficient.
•Nov. 10-13, 1991: The sec
ond annual review panel, con
sisting of faculty, staff, stu
dents, alumni and outside
experts (some of whom had
participated in the 1990
review), meets to evaluate
progress on UCMI recommen
dations. The report, released
early in 1992, lauds positive
changes, but expresses concern
that some University officials
seem to be "slow in responding
to the UCMI agenda," and that
budget cuts would threaten
progress that has been made.
•April 26, 1993: An internal
draft of the University Cabi
net's response to the 1991
review panel of the UCMI is
anonymously photocopied, dis
tributed to various students
and ethnic community centers
and obtained by The Daily.
Students express concern
about the cabinet's plans to
internalize the UCMI review
process, the report's implica
tions that ethnic community
centers and theme houses pro
mote "self-segregation," and
the lack of student input in the
document.
•May 13, 1993: Office of Mul
ticultural Development Direc
tor Sharon Parker resigns sud
denly, citing family commit
ments on the East Coast. Office
of Development Assoc. Director
Judith Little replaces Parker
as interim director of the office.
•May 28,1993: About 150 stu
dents rally in White Plaza to
express concern over the lack of
student input in administrative
decisions, citing the cabinet's
response to the UCMI review
panel as a key example.
•September 1993: The cabi
net's final response to the 1991
UCMI Review Panel is com
pleted. The document empha
sizes "interactive pluralism,"
and recruitment and retention
of diverse faculty, while estab
lishing an internal review pro
cess, followed by a comprehen
sive review in 1995, conducted
by people from within and out
side of the University.
