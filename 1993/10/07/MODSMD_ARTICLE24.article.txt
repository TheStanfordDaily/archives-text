W hen's a typical
black man ever
on time for any
thing? When he's going to
catch an advanced screening

of one of his favorite directors. No, it wasn't
a Spike Lee Joint (although he's another of
my favorite filmmakers) but a Robert Alt
man original: "Short Cuts," the eagerly an
ticipated, three-hour spectacle about life in
Los Angeles, Calif, circa now.
I just knew Altman would hook up his
screenplay adapted from a book of short
stories by Raymond Carver. Just like he
hooked up Michael Tolkin's movie satire
"The Player" and "Nashville," his crowning
achievement of the mid-'7os.
So there I was in The City, with 45 min
utes to spare. An immaculate brick building
with electronically secured entrances
loomed over a manicured street corner. Up
wardly mobile types in "Seinfeld" business
casuals were busy saying their quitting time
goodbyes. And then there was this conspic
uously dusty, four door American hooptie
with me inside.
I had Del tha Funked Homosapien's sin
gle "Made in America" bumpin' in the Clar
ion pullout as 1 sprawled down low in the
driver's seat with a Michigan baseball cap

casting a sinister shadow over my eyes (even
collegiates dream of being hard). It was me
tered parking and I wanted to hang onto my
laundry money. But by half past five, I had
gotten pretty antsy. Why post pone my date
with Altman's flick any longer?
Breaching the Lab's security perimeter via
the front door, 1 made for the security desk in
my most casually black gait. I had planned to
say, "Eh, daddy-o, where're they peepin' that
new Altman flick, for the press? I'm wit' the
Daily down Stanford way, know-wut-um
sayin'?" But a life time of code-switching
made me unwillingly bilingual. The guard
pointed me in the right direction, but before
I could get in, I had to give the publicist at the
posh screening room's door my name and af
filiation. "Due to limited seating," she said
through a sour smile, "we'll need to verify
that you are who you say you are."
About that time, it occurred to me that
unlike all the other stuffed shirts and blous
es, 1 was in baggy shorts, a backpack and
Nike sneakers; I didn't bother to ditch the
shadow either. I was doing my own thing,

which wasn't unusual. Only this time, it
seemed like my fellow viewers were in one
gigantic clique. Everybody knew everybody
else, not to mention the producer's sister.
And I, with my Cardinal credentials, was
feeling like an amoeba on a tick. And that
was just the tip of the iceberg.
All at once I found the fact that I was the
only black person in the room very dis
turbing. Coming from an academic setting
like Stanford, I should have been prepared.
What's more, it wasn't as if I hadn't been to
lily white screenings in the past. It comes
with the trade. My discomfort was con
nected to something deeper and more nag
ging.
Directorially, Altman's one of my idols.
He's a name I hope to be shooting off casu
ally, 15 years from now — after I've made
five or ten monumental flicks — when the
interviewer asks me what directors have in
fluenced me?
But his films weren't made specifically
for my black ass, just as Public Enemy didn't
make their second album, "It Takes A Na-

tion of Millions to Hold Us
Back," specifically for Tip
per Gore's kids. Likewise,
Fine Line Features, the dis
tributor releasing "Short

Cuts" later this month, could care less about
what America's black minority thinks, let
alone its handful of critics. I wasn't there to
report on "Short Cuts" for my brothas and
sistas in Ujamaa, but for the campus at
large. Imagine, the one "authority" on the
Altman canon among The Daily's small
pool of would-be critics, was the least likely
to make it professionally.
I don't ever remember being as sober at
the start of a movie as 1 was at that three
hour screening. As the lights went down,
there it was up on the screen, laid out in big
white letters, so I wouldn't miss the mes
sage.
"You think you have a tough field to plow
to reap your wild dreams of filmmaking?
Just see if we accept you any faster as a film
critic of any importance. You better pray
you end up as a middle manager in Corpo
ration XYZ, with a bourgeois black wife and
a house in the burbs. We have control of this
critical dial."
Well pardon me all over the place. I think
I'd better rent a black film. ■
