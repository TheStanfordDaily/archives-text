# The 						makings of a Midnight Oil mob scene
## 
### Ed Heinemann 
It sure sounded like it would be a mob scene.
Live 105, blared for weeks that any fan who
brought a copy of the Midnight Oil single "Out
break of Love" to the group's Sept. 29 concert
would be able to go backstage before the concert,
chat with the band and get the single signed. Back
stage passes being a badge of teenage credibility as
much as anything else—"Wayne's World" taught
me that — there figured to be thousands of sweaty
rock-'n'-rollers more than happy to buy into an
exclusive club at such a bargain-basement price.
My crafty editors, not to be outdone in hip,
smelled a story. Their visions were grand.
"What if you get the single, go to the concert,
try to get backstage and then chronicle your ad
venture on our pages? Heck, well even send a pho
tographer, to make it all legit."
I'd claw my way through predatory packs of
Cure fans; do battle with cruel, witless security
guards; and throw myself, bloodied but tri
umphant, at Peter Garrett's size-18 feet — and it
would all be captured in black and white for the
world to see. Oh, boy.
But even if I was less than thrilled at the
prospect of my imminent public humiliation, I
started to see possibilities for the story. The Oils,
the line went, wanted to give something back to
their fans, but the whole scheme shouted "com
mercial gimmick," especially with Live 105's give
away of a Chevy Camaro. Every time the station
played the tune "Bitchin' Camaro" during the day,
the correct-numbered caller could win tickets for
the Oil show — not to mention a shot at driving
the "Bitchin' Camaro" home for keeps. This, from
the band that played a blistering street gig outside
the Exxon building in New York after the Valdez
spill? Get me a stomach pump.
And while I wasn't spouting trenchant com
mentary on the Oils' hypocrisy, I could easily take
their pathetic fans to task. The uniquely American
need to touch fame, to grasp its slimy palm and
come back with a bit of affirming gold dust —
"Guess who I once saw, dude... Tony Danza!" —
would surely be good for a few biting paragraphs.
So as intrepid photographer Vincent Ho and I
cirded the auditorium looking for parking, our
journalistic hopes were high.
Once we got inside, however, the story took an
abrupt face plant. A few hundred fans sat patient
ly on the main floor. And what of the backstage

crowds, circling breathlessly to tear their Aussie
heroes limb from limb in a frenzy of adulation?
Well, we did find an orderly line of 15 pasty, well
fed grown-ups waiting to file past the band.
Even the Bill Graham Presents bullies, usually
pumped for a fight or two with the fans, were un
failingly mellow. Although they refused to let Vin
cent backstage with his camera equipment, they
were darn nice about it. It gave me the willies.
In desperation, Vincent and I created our own
moment of craziness when we realized we'd for
gotten to bring the single — duh — and had to
connive a woman with three of them into giving us
one, but that, as they say, was it By the time I got
my hands on the single, the line had dwindled to
five, and the whole enterprise seemed in danger of
folding for lack of interest.
So as I stood across the table from the band, try
ing to read their half-bored, half-congenial stares
and slightly forced smiles, I wasn't quite sure what
to say. "I just wanted you guys to know I think
you're great," a woman in front of me gushed.
Afraid I might vomit if I opened my mouth, I just
smiled and shuffled on by.
As I walked away from the band with the other
docile cattle, I had to furrow my writerly brow at
least a little. I found myself almost disappointed that
no screaming 15-year olds with navel rings had tried
to dive through my legs for their brush with glory.
Was this what rock and roll, that mover of cul
tural continents, had become? Was the potent
charisma that had Beatles fans crying by the mil
lions now diluted to little more than a means of
momentary solace for lonely thirtysomethings?
Of course, Midnight Oil wasn't exactly the epi
center of musical or cultural hip. Five earnestly po
litical white boys can only wrest so much sway
from the darker, sexier stylings of rap and grunge.
Thinking about it this way, I almost telieved
the single-signing was what they said it was: a gen
uine attempt to talk to real people.
And I almost didn't mind the journalistic let
down, especially when the concert rocked just as
earnestly.
Of course, now that all the excitement's over
and I'm back to the familiar grind, I can't help
wondering about that Live 105 giveaway. As
much as I hate to admit, I wouldn't have minded
winning It would have looked, bitchin' parked
outside my door. ■
