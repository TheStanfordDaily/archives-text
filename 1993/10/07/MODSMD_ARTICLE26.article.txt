# RAP THAT IS SOME THING DIFFERENT
## 
### VICTOR HASEMAN 
Sure white men can jump, but can they
rap? Can a young white male step to the
microphone and let loose jaw-dropping
rhymes serviced by outrageously funky
hornloops and breakbeats that set heads
nodding and hips swaying? Or is the art of
emceeing truly a black thing that most of
young America can groove to but never real
ly understand?
MC Serch and Pete Nice have hipped us to
solid offerings as both 3rd Bass solo artists;
Vanilla Ice went platinum with "Ice, Ice
Baby"; and Snow's 12-inch canopy of Cana
dian raggamuffin covered pop radio for
months. Trouble is, the lot of them sound
pedestrian in comparision to the Gang
Starrs, the Cypress Hills and the Pharcydes of
contemporary hip-hop. For every House of
Pain there are six or seven Young Black
Teenagers, white outfits with decent skills
and a love for the music, but little real talent.
White men can rap ... it's just normally not
very interesting.
Enter an increasingly promising excep
tion to the rule. The UK imports the Stereo
MCs, known for venturing far from the
melodically familiar without ever alienating
their listeners, are rappers... sort of.
Even a continent away, the nasal voice of
group producer Nick "the Head" Hallam res
onates with an edge of exasperation. The
nerve of us Yanks to categorize the group he
started eight years ago with childhood friend,
lyricist and lead vocalist Rob Birch (Rob B on
stage) as strictly rap.
"We just call ourselves the 'Stereo MCs.'
When people ask how we describe our
music," continues the Head matter-of-factly,
"I say, 'I don't know,' because I think it's im
portant for people to listen to our music and
make up their own minds. We don't want to
be stuck in a category."
Call it what you will, the Stereo MCs
have made stitching their patchwork
quilt of Euro-electro pop, hip-hop
and house their top priority, tirelessly push
ing it in new directions, as if in search of our
limits as recreational dancers and listeners.
But that's fine. It's what they do best. Witness
the success of "Supernatural," their Ameri
can debut back in '90. The album's "Elevate
My Mind," a savvy little dance anthem (part
Beatles, part Kraftwerk, part Jungle Broth
ers) was the first English-made rap single to
funk up the Tbp 40 charts. And that was
merely the beginning. Hot on the heels of
"Elevate" came "Lost in Music" and "I'm A
Believer," both of which flirted with the
charts without ever reaching the mainstream
popularity of their sister track.
"Supernatural," propped both American
and English doors of opportunity open for
the Stereos and they indulged heartily. For
"Connected," their third album, not only did
the group's sound strike out in new direc
tions, but its personnel expanded as well.
When the English LP "33,45,78" dropped in
'89, the Stereo MCs consisted of Rob B, the
Head and drummer Owen If. Soon after,
background vocalist Catherine (Cath) Cof

fey joined the group bringing Caron Wheel
er-esque vocals to "Supernatural." And the
group's third excursion, "Connected,"
marked the additions of two more sweet
sounding sisters: Andrea Groves and Verona
Davies.
"It was two years between albums and
we'd been touring a certain way for a long
time," says the Head of the Stereo's balloon
ing personnel roster. "Catherine had been in
the group for the last three years and we were
getting ideas for, y'know, more vocals on
tracks when we were writing them. So we just
thought, 'What the fuck, let's just expand a
bit.' That was it really. We wanted more peo
ple on stage and more vocal power."
Like Arrested Development and other al
ternative rap acts floating about popdom in
good-sized posses, rolling six-deep has had a
lot to do with the Stereo's recent successes.
"Part of what we've done, 1 ' confides the Head,
"is build our reputations on doing live shows.
And that was deliberate because we wanted
to show that we could come off musically
live."
So far, their plan has worked like a charm
on both continents. In England their "no
bullshit" shows, brimming over with Rob B's
near-stream-of-consciousness rhymes, soul
ful harmonies & la Coffey, Groves and Davies,
Owen's explosive kick-drum arrangements
and the Head's frenzied mixture of live and
sampled melodies, have won the group the
reputation of being one of the country's best
live groups.

And no one's knocking their stateside per
formances either. Over the last year and a
half, the Stereos have kept themselves ex
tremely busy with a dizzying mixture of sta
dium and club performances that only re
cently closed with Peter Gabriel's Womad
Tour.
"We did our club tour sort of right bang in
the middle of the tour we were doing with
U2. It was nice going from 50,000 people a
night to like 500 or 1,000. Although we were
getting used to the (format) of the U2 tour,
going back to a small, kind of intimate envi
ronment again was therapeutic."
Of course the Stereo's tour with U2
presented a set of problems even an
opening act's opening act might find
unnerving. Touring with a high-profile
band, explained the Head, can get unnerving
faster than you can spell "Rattle and Hum."
More often than not, the throng of people sit
ting out in the audience would just as soon
eliminate you from the concert process alto
gether. We're not talking icy receptions; try
liquid oxygen ones. Of course it doesn't help
matters any that the Stereos, like most rap
bands, don't take instruments on the road
with them — one of the occupational haz
ards of being a band on studio crutches.
"I used turntables for about five years be
fore 1 got bored with them. Turntables our
very difficult to get good sound out of on
stage. They feed-back, they jump. The way 1
do it now," using pre-mixed tracks, fed out of

a mixing desk on stage, "is just better, even
though we could run a good show with
turntables and drums and vocals."
But turntables aren't the only problem. By
definition, most hip-hop oriented music is
dance-centric. Just because a good deejay can
turn a party all the way out with Das EFX's
"Mic Checka" doesn't mean that the masters
of twisted-tongology themselves can take
their tune on stage and do likewise. The best
rap, like most other live performances, are
spectacle-driven. That's why Hammer, who
gets no love on America's ghetto streets, can
rock Boise, Idaho.
"We could go up against a rock group and
still sound better and get a better reaction,"
explains the Head, putting on his most hum
ble voice. "People would be kind of going,
'Oh, they're just a fucking group of with
turntables. What's that shit!' I think we im
press people; they're shocked we can get over
without even pushing a guitar on stage."
■perhaps, like Hammer, Arrested Devel-
or Digital Underground,
spectacle is the key to the Stereo MCs
success. Then again, they're not exactly rap.
It may very well be an English thing, much
like Gee Street, the Island Records subsidiary
that the Head and Rob B started at the begin
ning of their careers. But churning out suc
cessful remixes of Jungle Brothers, Monie
Love and Queen Latifah back in the late '80s
and, more recently, for Island alums U2, the
Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprosy and RM.
Dawn as alter-ego Ultimatum can't hurt.
"Now that we finished the U2 tour," the
Head continued, "I think we went down real
ly weU and I think it was a really good thing
to do, y'know? I was surprised by the reaction
we were getting. It just goes to show that
we've covered a lot of area this year. We've
come over really well in all of those shows
and it just means we're learning how to deal
with different situations easier."
And not a moment to soon. Touring the
world is most certainly a blast, but nothing
beats laying down tracks for an upcoming
fourth album. The Stereos, who were once as
popular as Gee Street remix wizards Ultima
tum, as they are now as themselves, of late
have been gearing up for their next album
date. But it hasn't been easy setting aside the
time. Last year alone, the Head remembers,
he and Rob B received over 30 remix offers
alone. But as lucrative a business as remix
production can be, the Stereos would rather
be making their own record. "I think it's
more important for us to keep writing songs.
We've got to get our priorities right and pri
orities are the Stereo MCs — that's our music
totally and that's what we're most interested
in."
What the Stereo MCs prove above all else,
without truly being the UK rap group Amer
ica would like them to be, however, is that
white men can rap and rap we 11... especial
ly when it's to the beat of a drum machine
that's tired of sounding exactly like everyone
else. Let's hope their "connection" is solid
state. ■
