# Experiencing the movies, the old-fashioned way

The year is 1925: A hot young writer named
F. Scott Fitzgerald had just penned "The
Great Gatsby," Stanford men were don
ning Stetson hats and the women sought the
look of cool elegance: short hair, pencil-thin
figures and draping dresses. Pop Warner
coached Stanford football, Wilbur was a presi
dent, not a dorm, and students were getting
typewriters — "increase your standing and
prestige with professors," crowed the ads.
After Big Game, chic couples could retire to
the St. Francis hotel for a whopping $4, and if
you wanted to catch the USC game in Los Ange
les, a round-trip ticket by steamship was $22.50,

theatre that doesn't just show the classic Holly
wood films, but also carries on the tradition of
a full-blown movie experience that's been for
gotten in the modern age of 100-plex theatres
and Price Club-style ambiance.
Packard, a tall, mild-mannered gentleman
in his early 50s, is not afraid to plunge
into uncertain waters when he feels like it.
"I think your life should be divided into phas
es," he says while playing some tunes on the
theatre's mighty Wurlitzer organ, parts of
which date from the '20s. "Nobody should do
the same thing six years at a time."
His own life is evidence of that belief.
Packard spent years as a classics professor,
teaching at UCLA and the University of North
Carolina, never even thinking about walking
into a theatre because he thought it represented
"debased popular culture."
"It was only in my 30s, almost my 40s, that a
colleague in Chapel Hill dragged me down to a
theatre to see the"The Wizard of Oz," he con
tinues. The colleague, a distinguished professor
of classics and also president of a local "The
Wizard of Oz" club, piqued Packard's interest
in older movies, which later became a drive to
collect the classic films of the '30s and '40s and
show them in a grand style under one roof.
Packard's conversion was immediate and final.
"I loved 'The Wizard of Oz' so much that the
next night I saw 'Meet Me in St. Louis,' and sud
denly I realized that if there are people a few
thousand years from now studying our century,
classics professors like me looking back, these
Hollywood films are going to be one of the most
important achievements of this century that's
going to interest them, not all the intellectual
films that college professors say you should see
— the films made by intellectuals, for intellec
tuals — but just these films by real people for
real people back in the '30s and '405."
After leaving North Carolina because he
didn't get along with the chairman of the clas
sics department — "you can print that if you
want to," he says — Packard went to Los Ange
les for remedial education. "I became a gradu
ate student in spirit again. I just went to the the
atre every night for years just trying to catch up
and see all the classic movies I could."
A close examination of the theatre's nooks
and crannies reveals where some of the
$6 million and two years spent in reno
vations went. "It was just a mess," he says, de
scribing what the place looked like when he first
rented it to show a series of Fred Astaire films
after the dancer died in 1987. "There were no
curtains, no chandeliers, no paint or decora
tion."
"We rented these films as a benefit for the
Children's Hospital at Stanford, and I remem
ber the first day before the festival, traipsing up
and down the theatre feeling that I'd be happy
if at least 25 people came to share our love for
Fred Astaire. And on the opening night a thou
sand people came, and that happened every
night for the next 14 days.
"No one else expected this. Everyone said,
'Fred Astaire movies are on TV.' He had just
died a few weeks before, so a lot of his movies
were on TV, and you can watch them on video.

a price which included on-board entertainment.
But what to do if a date popped up and you
had to stay local? Then as now, the after-hours
question was a pressing issue.
Well, there was always the Stanford Theatre.
A temple to the opulent Jazz Age, it opened that
year, fitted with Assyrian and Greek details, re
splendent in gold, blue and yellow and adorned
with a red velvet curtain. "Only the best for the
Stanford guest," it pledged, advertising its
showings in The Daily Palo Alto, the forerun
ner to The Stanford Daily.
With passing generations of Stanford stu
dents, however, the theatre slid into disrepair:
the paint peeled, the trim chipped and the de
tails faded. By the mid-1980s, second and
third-run films starring Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger and foreign movies were its only offerings.
The theatre seemed likely to become yet anoth
er yogurt shop until David Packard, son of the
Silicon Valley giant who founded Hewlett-
Packard, turned his love of old movies into a

No one thought anyone would want to come to
a theatre and watch old movies, but everyone
came and they loved being in a big theatre with
a big screen. And everyone would cheer for the
dance numbers. It was just a lot of fun."
From that resounding success, Packard, with
some help from his father — who in his son's
words, "has never liked movies very much," —
decided to buy the Stanford Theatre. He wanted
to recreate the original 1925 theatre down to the
minutest detail, but he also didn't want to be re
membered as the man who flattened a thousand
people during the next temblor. To ensure both
a safe and stunning theatre, two million pounds
of concrete and five hundred thousand pounds
of steel were added to the building without af
fecting its original appearance.
A side-by-side comparison of an early photo
of the theatre when it first opened and the theatre
today reveals few dissimilarities. Packard even
went so far as to hunt down the son of the origi
nal designer who decorated the ceilings and walls
to recreate its earlier appearance. Furthermore,
by searching through old records, the original
watercolor designs for the theatre were discov
ered, and the Stanford Theatre was reborn.
Perhaps the biggest attraction of the the
atre, however, is the Wurlitzer organ,
which is maintained by Ed Stout, a
friendly gentleman whose interest in organs
started at age six, and who takes care of several
organs in the Bay Area.
Stout, like Packard, says he doesn't go near
the modern films of today. "1 never watch
them," says Packard. "I don't see them except

on airplanes and they're silent, so I don't
know." Stout adds, " 'Giant' was a good film,"
and that's about all he's willing to surrender.
Down in the bowels of the theatre, Stout
switches on a massive turbine, a hulking gray
entity that looks like something taken from a
German industrial poster, and seems comfort
able with the incredible roar as he points out,
with visible enjoyment, the organ's voracious
need for wind.
The organ's actual instruments sit behind
the intricately arranged gilded grills that deco
rate the walls of the theatre and on first glance
don't look capable of producing music. Brass
and nickel tubes, which simulate a brass band
and a string section, scrunch next to a glocken

spiel, a gong, a marimba and a xylophone, and
somehow it's all stuck together with pine
boards and some faith. Stout comes in once a
week or so to do maintenance.
This poses several challenges, however —
Wurlitzer went out of business in 1939. The
grill and all instruments are operated by tiny
wind hammers or wind bellows while the play
er at the organ adjusts the numerous keys and
levers and pedals at his disposal.
Currently four organists play the evening
shows. One of them is Jim Rigg, a blond virtu
oso who plays three nights a week and whose
skills have been featured in silent film revivals
and in tours across Britain and Europe. He
began learning piano and essentially taught
himself to play the organ. As for his first time
rising up out of the orchestra pit, Rigg says,"It
was overwhelming. The organ's constantly try
ing to blow itself up."
Rigg, who Stout claims can play the songs of
the '20s and '30s with a "lilting style," says he's
one of those lucky souls who loves his job and
happens to get paid doing it, even though he ac
cepts his calling as being hopelessly anachro
nistic. He tries to put some historical perspec
tive on his performance. "Put yourself in the
audience's place in 1925. There was no MTV,
no TV, no CDs, maybe a gramophone or a play
er piano." Featuring a full accompaniment of
instruments and three tiers of keys (soon to be
four), "the organ was damned impressive," he
says. Its unique sound, and the sight of one per
son at the helm contiolling the multitudinous
valves and bellows delight crowds now as they
did back then. Rigg's regular trips around Bay
Area theatres to play the organ attest to the
organ's continued ability to impress and ama/e
audiences.
Up at the projection room sits Phil
Krikau, 37, who hand-loads the film for
the early evening show — "the way it
should be done," he says. With some distaste,
he describes the process at a conventional
movie theatre, where most films are spliced
onto a massive platter and then run automati
cally. "The scratch-a-matic or dirt-a-matic,"
says Stout, with measured antipathy.
Krikau, on the other hand, changes reels ap
proximately every 20 minutes, alternating be
tween two 1951 vintage carbon-arc lamps

which resemble torpedo tubes. He flips on a
switch that indicates substantial voltage as a
voltmeter needle slowly charges. Down in the
basement, a beetle-shaped machine about the
size of a foot locker converts alternating current
into direct current to power the two projectors.
The carbon-arc lamp, which was carefully
overhauled and modified, gives the best light
and color balance with older films, and the bul
let-shaped carbon reed burns at an intensity
that's painful to look at, even through a black
filter.
Krikau, who has worked as a theatre usher,
custodian and manager — anything, just to be
involved with movies — takes pride in being a
full-time projectionist. The room has been spe
cially outfitted to show flammable nitrate
prints, and Krikau handles them all. A member
of the projectionists' union, he served an ap
prenticeship for several years to learn his trade.
"I feel this is a lasting stop for me," he says.
"Everything has to be perfect. I really admire
what is going on here, and you don't see it any
where else." Then, Krikau flips a switch. The
Austrian curtain, a deep red velvet "waterfall"
design, slowly rises. The early show comes on,
and the projector rattles away.
Standing in the tiled entranceway and sur
rounded by the heavy smell of hot pop
corn, Packard says that he plans no fur
ther expansion of the theatre or bold experi
mentation with the programming. For years
the theatre had a vaudeville stage which fea
tured live performances — once showcasing a
14-year-old Ginger Rogers with the Redheads

in 1926 — but Packard has no plans to use it for
that purpose once again.
As the one who does most of the program
ming and makes the policy decisions, Packard
keeps his approach simple. "I show what I love
and what I think other people should love," he
says. He will occasionally give a brief presenta
tion about the film for the evening, though
Packard says that his speeches mostly amount
to telling people to keep their feet off the chairs.
"Most of the films we book are either worth
seeing or fun, often both," he says."I doubt
we'll show films [firom] after the 19605. We'll
probably show a few Renoir films, and we're
thinking about doing a Satyajit Ray festival, and
maybe a Japanese film festival."
Packard's desire to keep the programming
so strictly defined derives from his need to
maintain the theatre's character. "I think that's
what is so important," he says."The audience
knows what they're getting. The Castro shows
an old film, then maybe a new film, then maybe
some foreign film, and a theatre doesn't build
up a personality that way."
Maintaining a personality makes all the dif
ference in showing a movie, says Packard.
"These films were made to be seen in a theatre
like this. It's one reason why these films are
more successful — it's the atmosphere they're
in. Beethoven may sound great on a synthesiz
er and you might appreciate his genius by lis
tening to it, but it's much greater when you
hear a whole orchestra playing it."
However, despite all the effort Packard has
put into recreating a special experience, he
seems surprised that others haven't hit upon

the same formula.
"These films are so wonderful, and it seems
to me that if anybody ran movies like this every
body would want to come see them. I don't
know why this isn't happening at other places.
It seems to me we're just doing the obvious.
Anybody would want to see Fred Astaire on a
big screen in a beautiful theatre like this. Any
body would want to see 'Casablanca.' "
Packard is right. As long as people like those
at the Stanford Theatre stay alive and kicking,
people will be buying popcorn, sitting down in
a real theatre and cheering a good film as a
common audience as long as they feel they need
to be entertained. Styles might have changed
and Stanford classes come and go, but the Stan -
ford Theatre is back in business, proffering the
entertainment that it was meant to serve. ■
