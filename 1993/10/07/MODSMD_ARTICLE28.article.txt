# Almost another 'Godfather'
## De Niro's 'A Bronx Tale' merely reruns mafia cliché 
### 
A manic-depressive movie of sorts, "A Bronx
Tale" fluctuates between moderately brilliant
and excruciatingly cliched moments. You'll love
this movie ... you'll hate this movie ... and
then five minutes later you'll love it again.
The film's tortuously overdone theme depicts
the childhood and adolescence of Calogero Anel

io (Fred Savage look-alike Lillo Brancato and
Francis Capra), the son of honest, hard-working
and proud Italian-American parents (director
Robert De Niro and Kathrine Narducci).
Based on an actual event in co-star and
scriptwriter Chazz Palminteri's childhood, the
story is set in motion when young Calogero

witnesses a murder and becomes intrinsically
tied to Big Man of the Bronx and young-God
father type, Sonny (Palminteri).
Naturally, Lorenzo Anello (De Niro), a bus
driver, finds himself competing for his son's
loyalty.
The typical tension ensues between Anello's
honest, no-frills existence and Sonny's glam
orous but corrupt lifestyle.
Of course, Sonny's role in the film intro
duces the inevitable and tired "Mafia mystique"
theme Hollywood seems to require of any
movie featuring both Italians and New York.
The only problem is Hollywood anesthetized
the intrigue of organized crime many, many
"Godfather"-wannabes ago.
However, the strong but potentially danger
ous relationship between Sonny and Calogero
make for the film's redeeming moments.
Palminteri, who initially wrote and performed
"A Bronx Tale" as a hugely successful one-man
play, shows his mastery of his character, a vio
lent, sinisterly charismatic man, though one
with a caring side.
Both the younger and older Calogero (Bran
cata and Capra) make fitting dialogue partners
for Palminteri's Sonny, and convey the charm
and intelligence of their characters well — if
not for Calogero's revolting lapses into senti
mentalism.
For example, the subplot of his first roman
tic interest — he falls for a black girl from
Harlem & la young "Jungle Fever" — is sweet
enough to have us rooting for the lovebirds, but
far, far from intelligent enough to do justice to
such complex racial dynamics.
Instead the relationship falls into the ado
lescent, mushy, puppy love genre of romance
— the kind you find in a Sweet Valley High
novel or in an ABC Afterschool Special. Nau

seatingly full of saccharine.
De Niro as actor is disappointingly bland,
not giving us much to like or dislike about his
portrayal of Lorenzo. The stereotypically proud
Italian-American family man he portrays leaves
us thinking that De Niro should be capable of a
much more developed character.
And in his directorial debut, De Niro makes
his behind-the-camera presence known. How
ever, that's not necessarily a good thing. The
often-dizzying creative camera angles — for ex -
ample, a topsy-turvy participant's-eyc view of a
barroom brawl — induce more motion sick
ness than amazement.
The camera-induced nausea is furthered by
"A Bronx Tale" 's total lack of character devel
opment. Instead, the caricature reigns — in try
ing to capture the flavor of the Bronx and its
typical inhabitants in 1960, De Niro and
Palminteri grossly use both exaggeration and
stereotype, which may be humorous but leaves
something to be desired from a human-interest
standpoint.
The nostalgic and impressive '50s-'6os
soundtrack commands a surprisingly influen
tial presence in the movie. For example, the
music switches from doo-wop to jazz to James
Brown as the focus switches from the Bronx to
Harlem.
The reactions which "A Bronx Tale" pro
vokes is no less eclectic. For those of us who
thrive on emotional highs and lows, the movie
creates a veritable roller coaster of feelings —
that is, those of wildly fluctuating admiration
and disgust.
But it's a heck of a lot more than most of us
would expect from a movie that shamelessly
and relentlessly repeats its theme-quote, "The
saddest thing in life is wasted potential."

Many tense interactions between Sonny (Chazz Palmintero) and Lorenzo (Robert De Niro),
like the one shown above, are not enough to save "A Bronx Tale" from death by clich6.
