## The
						Program 
### 
In football movies, there are two types of
trashy dialogue. The good kind — "I'm going
to rip your guts out and watch you die!" — and
the kind that makes you want to tackle the exit:
"Just be yourself Joe, that's all. Be yourself and
that will be enough."
"The Program," an in-depth look at the
high-stakes world of college football (both on
and off the field), is full of both.
James Caan ("The Godfather") is Eastern
State University head football coach Sam Win
ters, a guy who faces the daily challenge of keep
ing the fans and boosters happy by winning
football games, while coaching and "taking care
or his players. Craig Sheffer ("A River Runs
Through It") plays Joe Kane, Winters' Heisman

hopeful upon whose
shoulders the fate of
the team rests. And
Omar Epps ("Juice"),
plays frosh sensation
Darnell Jefferson,
whose struggles on the
gridiron equal his
struggles to stay in
school.
With all three ac
tors having a back
ground in sports,
they're able to pull off
their performances
with sincerity. But

Sheffer's take on the duality of the star athlete's
life — the glory of winning combined with the
pain and pressure of losing — stands out in
particular as one of the film's most inspired
sentiments.
What sets "The Program" apart from other
films of its genre is the on-field action. This is
due to the tremendous effort the production
team put forth to film dramatic and believable
football scenes. The film's producers took a
group of football players and made them into
actors.
To make the scenes even more realistic, the
production team arranged to film all of the
football sequences during the halftime of last
year's Tennessee vs. South Carolina football
game. Astonishingly, the film crew trans
formed South Carolina's Williams Brice Sta
dium into E.S.U.'s Wolf Den Stadium and
filmed all of the sequences in fourteen minutes
fiat.
However, as good as the football scenes are,
the film gets bogged down with too many sub
plots. The "program" faces such problems as
players faking drug tests, cheating on exams
and committing crimes. Add to these problems
two love stories, a controversy between two
players fighting for the same position and girl
friend and a father-son conflict that would
make Freud sick and you have a story too com
plex for a fun football film. Had "The Program"
focused on the playing of football, rather than
off-the-field fiascoes, it could have become a
pigskin classic.
