As most Stanford students
slipped into their academic rou
tines this week, 12 others wit
nessed history.
The students, attending the
University's new overseas studies
program in Moscow, watched Mon
day as troops loyal to Russian Pres
ident Boris Yeltsin quelled an at
tempted coup by some representa
tives clinging to the nation's Com
munist past.
Classes at the Moscow campus,
which is in its first quarter of oper
ation, were canceled Monday and
Tuesday. The campus is only three
to four miles from the Russian

White House, the site of the most
intense fighting during the coup at
tempt.
Maxim Bratersky, director of
Stanford in Moscow, confirmed
that classes resumed yesterday,
though life is not yet back to nor
mal.
"We had to take a couple of pre
cautions," he said. "The [11 p.m.]
curfew is going to be going until
Oct. 10."
Corb Smith, deputy director of
the Overseas Studies Program,
said, "Students [were] instructed
to stay away from the areas where"
the violence was occurring.
