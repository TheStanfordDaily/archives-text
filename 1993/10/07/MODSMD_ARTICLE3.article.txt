# Students witness turmoil in Russia
## 
### Kevin Wack 
As most Stanford students
slipped into their academic rou
tines this week, 12 others wit
nessed history.
The students, attending the
University's new overseas studies
program in Moscow, watched Mon
day as troops loyal to Russian Pres
ident Boris Yeltsin quelled an at
tempted coup by some representa
tives clinging to the nation's Com
munist past.
Classes at the Moscow campus,
which is in its first quarter of oper
ation, were canceled Monday and
Tuesday. The campus is only three
to four miles from the Russian

White House, the site of the most
intense fighting during the coup at
tempt.
Maxim Bratersky, director of
Stanford in Moscow, confirmed
that classes resumed yesterday,
though life is not yet back to nor
mal.
"We had to take a couple of pre
cautions," he said. "The [11 p.m.]
curfew is going to be going until
Oct. 10."
Corb Smith, deputy director of
the Overseas Studies Program,
said, "Students [were] instructed
to stay away from the areas where"
the violence was occurring.
Senior David Hoffman, one the
Moscow students, admitted that
they were "encouraged" not to
wander onto the streets, but many
— including himself — did anyway.
Hoffman added that the stu
dents are staying in Russian
homes, some of which were closer
to the fighting than the site of the
Stanford program. Hoffman lives
on the street along which the Rus
sian army entered Moscow.
Bratersky said he had talked to

many Russian citizens and that the
people's impression of Yeltsin is one
of indecision.
"A lot of people blame Yeltsin
not for using force, but for waiting
so long to use force," he said.
Bratersky said that although 80
percent of the Russian people sup
port Yeltsin, that coalition is
shaky. He predicted that Russia's
current prime minister would be
elected president in the upcoming
election.
Hoffman had also talked to quite
a few Muscovites, and said he had
gotten a feel for the mood of the peo
ple. He related a conversation with a
Russian general who said he was

fighting on Yeltsin's side — only
because he wanted to be on the win
ning side. The general told Hoffman
he really sympathized with the
deposed hard-liners.
That ambivalence seemed to
sum up the mood of the Russian
people. "A lot of people at first were
waiting to see what happened," said
Hoffman. But after it was apparent
that had won, "Everyone was
[Yeltsin'si biggest fan."
And maybe that same ambiva
lence was starting to rub off on
Hoffman. When asked to summa
rize the current state of affairs in
Moscow, he responded, "Every
thing's fine now, I think."
