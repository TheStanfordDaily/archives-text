# Malice

### 
In his latest film, "Malice," director Harold
Becker attempts to craft a suspenseful story, but
the result is merely a never-ending series of
complicated twists that go nowhere. Both the
plot convolutions and the acting are so exag
gerated that "Malice" seems more like a come
dy than a taut Hitchcockian thriller.
The story unfolds when the arrival of a tal
ented young surgeon in a small New England
town coincides with a series of rapes at the local
women's college. Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin)
befriends Andy (Bill Pullman), the dean of the
college, and his angelic wife Tracy (Nicole Kid
man) after saving the life of one of the victims.
But the friendship is short-lived and the cou
ple's life is left a wreck.
Baldwin does a fair job portraying the slick
and arrogant Hill, though his acting cannot
compensate for the inadequacy of the Aaron
Sorkin and Scott Frank script. In addition,
Nicole Kidman, who apparently uses most of
her acting ability to master an American accent,
is unconvincing in her role as the "girl-next
door" turned gold-digging con artist. And then
there is Pullman, whose perpetually confused
expression seems better suited to a situation
comedy than a fast-paced psychological
thriller. Actually, Anne Bancroft outshines
them all in her one crucial scene as Tracy's cyn
ical, alcoholic mother.
For their inexcusable screenplay, Sorkin and

Frank should be strapped to chairs and forced
to watch their film repeatedly. Their efforts to
be witty and suspenseful fail miserably. While
the script's one-liners might work in an action
oriented Schwarzenegger flick, they are
painfully out of place in a film where dialogue
and character development are crucial.
Furthermore, it's rather disturbing that
Sorkin's and Frank's serial rapist is totally aux
iliary to the film; it's only used to reveal a small
fact that could have easily been discovered
without a violent subplot.
Whatever potential the film's concept had
on paper is iost because Becker and company
try to encompass too many genres with surprise
elements and canned dialogue.
Bottom line: if you are bored and have a few
bucks to waste, "Malice" can provide superfi
cially satisfying entertainment. But only if
you're bored.
