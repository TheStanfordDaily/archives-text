# King of the garbage disposal
## 'In Utero' shows Nirvana for their offensive, grunge selves 
### 
Yes, you can call it "music" if you want.
Nirvana's newest release "In Utero" — the
follow-up to their highly touted "Never
mind" album, which topped the charts at
dorm parties all last fall — stakes the group's
claim to the top of the heap of garbage-dis
posal rock bands.
In order to prove they're not selling out,
Nirvana and lead singer Kurt Cobain have
backed up their "Nevermind" effort with
sick-and-twisted, hey-little-kid-want-some
candy lyrics and highly offensive guitar feed
back. Unfortunately, it's not strong enough
medicine to keep the Debbie Gibson fans
away — it just leaves even die-hard fans won
dering what "like most babies smell like but
ter / his smell smelled like no other" is sup
posed to mean.
Cobain is the creative force and song
writer for all but one of "In Utero"s ' tracks.
His emphysema-laced shouts tempered with
whispering vocals will be sweet music to the
cars of those who ate "Smells like Teen Spir
it" up like ra7x>r-filled Halloween candy. But
his evil genius will also succeed in satisfying
the needs of a grunge crowd bound and de
termined to flipping off society by any means
necessary.
The two slut hits on the albums, "Rape
Me" and "Dumb," are unabashed rip-offs of
"Nevermind" 's cash-cow tracks and should
be topping the 35-minute play cycle at an al
ternative rock station near you any nanosec
ond. With catchy tunes and enigmatic lyrics,
they are the dreams record contracts are

made of.
"Rape Me," performed on "Saturday Night
Live" by the group, is an obvious assault on
fairweather fans who devoured "Teen Spirit"
— throwing out nearly identical guitar riffs
and the same beat to the cash-wielding mass
es in mocking disgust. It's as if Cobain is
merely trying to see how many 14-year-olds
he can get to pseudo-sensitively sing the word
"rape" without wondering if his offering "Ap
preciate your concern / You'll always stink
and burn" is directed toward them.
"Heart-Shaped Box," the closest Nirvana
gets to music your parents could listen to,
has already gone several rounds on Live
105. It is an acceptable, not-too-slow song
with a delightfully twisted outlook on love.
Instead of making a prostituted Top-40
slow song Metallica-style, Nirvana has
more deviant aspirations: "I wish I could
eat your cancer when you turn black." Ah,
romance.
And you liked the production quality in
"Nevermind"? It's still amazing, but in bel
ligerent rebellion, Nirvana throws in painful
guitar feedback anytime and evcrytime they
feel like it, just to make your fillings fall out.
Cobain wants to know if you're a real fan.
Overall, "In Utero" is still worth your gift
certificate to Tower. Loud, yes. Offensive, yes.
Still well-produced, yes. It doesn't have quite
the ethereal, sampled perfection of "Never
mind," but it seems like Cobain wanted it
that way.
He got the record contract. He got throngs

of Chanel-combat
boot-wearing,
pseudo-angst-rid
den pubescents to
buy his album. And
his success pissed
him off. So how do
you prove you
haven't sold out
under the crippling
burden of the
almighty dollar?
You give those I
totally-understand-
where-he's-com-
ing-from punks
something to rumi
nate in songs like
"Radio Friendly
Unit Shifter": "I had
nothing to do with
what you think / if
you ever think at all
/ Bi polar oppositcs
attract / All of a
sudden my water
broke."
You don't get the
lyrics, because
there's nothing to

get. Cobain wants it that way. It's great. Once
you figure out what he's doing, you can ig
nore the offensive noise. If you're into the
genre, go with godspeed and buy "In Utero."
If you bought "In Utero" because you

loved "Teen Spirit" even though you wished
you could understand the lyrics, screw you
and the $20 your dysfunctional parent gave
you to buy the album with.

"In Utero," Nirvana's follow-up album to the overwhelmingly suc
cessful "Nevermind," the group sets out to prove they haven't
sold out, while remaining kings of the grunge tradition of garbage
disposal rock bands.
Yes, you can call it "music" if you want.
Nirvana's newest release "In Utero" — the
follow-up to their highly touted "Never
mind" album, which topped the charts at
dorm parties all last fall — stakes the group's
claim to the top of the heap of garbage-dis
posal rock bands.
In order to prove they're not selling out,
Nirvana and lead singer Kurt Cobain have
backed up their "Nevermind" effort with
sick-and-twisted, hey-little-kid-want-some
candy lyrics and highly offensive guitar feed
back. Unfortunately, it's not strong enough
medicine to keep the Debbie Gibson fans
away — it just leaves even die-hard fans won
dering what "like most babies smell like but
ter / his smell smelled like no other" is sup
posed to mean.
Cobain is the creative force and song
writer for all but one of "In Utero"s ' tracks.
His emphysema-laced shouts tempered with
whispering vocals will be sweet music to the
cars of those who ate "Smells like Teen Spir
it" up like ra7x>r-filled Halloween candy. But
his evil genius will also succeed in satisfying
the needs of a grunge crowd bound and de
termined to flipping off society by any means
necessary.
The two slut hits on the albums, "Rape
Me" and "Dumb," are unabashed rip-offs of
"Nevermind" 's cash-cow tracks and should
be topping the 35-minute play cycle at an al
ternative rock station near you any nanosec
ond. With catchy tunes and enigmatic lyrics,
they are the dreams record contracts are

made of.
"Rape Me," performed on "Saturday Night
Live" by the group, is an obvious assault on
fairweather fans who devoured "Teen Spirit"
— throwing out nearly identical guitar riffs
and the same beat to the cash-wielding mass
es in mocking disgust. It's as if Cobain is
merely trying to see how many 14-year-olds
he can get to pseudo-sensitively sing the word
"rape" without wondering if his offering "Ap
preciate your concern / You'll always stink
and burn" is directed toward them.
"Heart-Shaped Box," the closest Nirvana
gets to music your parents could listen to,
has already gone several rounds on Live
105. It is an acceptable, not-too-slow song
with a delightfully twisted outlook on love.
Instead of making a prostituted Top-40
slow song Metallica-style, Nirvana has
more deviant aspirations: "I wish I could
eat your cancer when you turn black." Ah,
romance.
And you liked the production quality in
"Nevermind"? It's still amazing, but in bel
ligerent rebellion, Nirvana throws in painful
guitar feedback anytime and evcrytime they
feel like it, just to make your fillings fall out.
Cobain wants to know if you're a real fan.
Overall, "In Utero" is still worth your gift
certificate to Tower. Loud, yes. Offensive, yes.
Still well-produced, yes. It doesn't have quite
the ethereal, sampled perfection of "Never
mind," but it seems like Cobain wanted it
that way.
He got the record contract. He got throngs

of Chanel-combat
boot-wearing,
pseudo-angst-rid
den pubescents to
buy his album. And
his success pissed
him off. So how do
you prove you
haven't sold out
under the crippling
burden of the
almighty dollar?
You give those I
totally-understand-
where-he's-com-
ing-from punks
something to rumi
nate in songs like
"Radio Friendly
Unit Shifter": "I had
nothing to do with
what you think / if
you ever think at all
/ Bi polar oppositcs
attract / All of a
sudden my water
broke."
You don't get the
lyrics, because
there's nothing to

get. Cobain wants it that way. It's great. Once
you figure out what he's doing, you can ig
nore the offensive noise. If you're into the
genre, go with godspeed and buy "In Utero."
If you bought "In Utero" because you

loved "Teen Spirit" even though you wished
you could understand the lyrics, screw you
and the $20 your dysfunctional parent gave
you to buy the album with.
