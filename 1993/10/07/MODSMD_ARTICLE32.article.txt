## "Don't Know How To Party" The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 
### 
It's appropriate that the lyrics to "Don't
Know How To Party," the latest from Cam
bridge's Mighty Mighty Bosstones, are print
ed on the disc jacket in one long, Faulknerian
paragraph.
Besides making it virtually impossible for
slipshod reviewers to pick out pithy quotes
readily, the lyrical shower reflects the rough
edged, rambling quality of the Bosstones*
work. And similar to, say, "The Sound and
the Fury," you either like it or you don't.
The eight-man Bosstones are unlikely
voices for the unruly Boston youth. They are
nattily attired and well-groomed, and some
band members seem to be still waiting for fa
cial peach fuzz. Like just a handful of groups
haunting alternative radio, the Bosstones arc

biracial. And their
thrash-funk sound
has a certain fresh
ness and intelligence
hidden within it.
But from the
opening riffs of "Our
Only Weapon,"
which begins with
the sampled sound of
barking dogs, it's
clear that "Don't
Know How To Party"

is the work of gangly ruffians who refuse to
grow up. "Our only weapon is a song," lead
singer Dicky Barrett roars with adolescent
idealism. "The arsenal's music and the army's
our friends."
There's nothing dreamy about the music
on "Don't Know How To Party," though. The
Bosstones start rocking from the start and 41
minutes later they haven't really stopped. In
fact, the whole album sounds a little bit like a
bunch of high-school buddies who just felt
like grabbing some amps, going to a garage
and playing as loud and fast as they could. To
that end, the Bosstones are unabashedly male
— sort of "riot grrrl" revisionists.
If you can stand that sort of machismo,
"Don't Know How To Party" is, if nothing
else, engaging. The charming "Someday I
Suppose," with its early Clash-style reggae,
analogizes the disorder of youth with Barrett's
inability to remember what he is supposed to
be singing about. On "What Was Was Over"
— whose simple introductory guitar line is
the closest the band comes to an actual ballad
— Barrett expresses the confused ambiva
lence of ending a relationship: "Thought it
over, thought I'd walk over and over coffee we
could chat / But then, I thought again 'cause
what was was over now I know that."
Musically, the album is unremarkable, al
though the horn arrangements that back up
the Bosstones' heavy melodies are at times
surprisingly intricate. Barrett's growling
voice is a pretty fair facsimile of Tom Waits,
but lacks Waits' empty, strung-out emotion.

Perhaps that will come with maturity.
After all, "Don't Know How To Party"
ends with the hell-may-care abandon of
"Seven Thirty Seven / Shoe Glue," on which
Barrett sings, "Beer here, don't want to see
clear... Turn it up more than a notch / Like
a punch in the face or a kick in the crotch."
Boys will be boys.
