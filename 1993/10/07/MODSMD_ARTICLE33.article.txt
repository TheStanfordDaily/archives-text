# "Tragedy: Saga of a Hoodlum" Intelligent Hoodlum
## 
### 
The inner city, as labeled by the media, is a
place of extreme poverty, shattered dreams and
pathetic failure. But most newspaper articles
and television shows that discuss "What's
going on in da 'hood," are presented by people
who have never owned a ghetto pass. Hip-hop
is a medium that has tried to dismantle these
stereotypes of urban America and recreate its
flavor and culture.
One trailblazer among artists in the hip-hop
movement is Intelligent Hoodlum. On his sec
ond album "Tragedy, Saga of a Hoodlum," the
Hoodlum is back kicking hype lyrics supported
by dope samples, slammin' rhythms and phat
bass lines. On track after track, he uses street
wisdom to educate the listener about the lives
of young black men on the street. A member of
the East Coast rap contingent, Intelligent con
tinues to innovate with lyrics and tracks that re
flect hip-hop's new sounds.
In a toned down "Jazzmatazz-mode," the

Hoodlum comes out swinging with "Under
ground." His trash-talkin' lyrics are backed by
samples from Lou Donaldson's "Pot Belly" and
features members of the black funk-meets
rock band Fishbone on vocals. The beautiful
horns, supported by keyboards, and dope
rhythms are typical of the new hip-hop sound
that has crossed racial and cultural barriers.
The song especially reminds the listener that
most hip-hop comes from the street before it
goes mainstream.
"Funk Mode," a mixture of swing, street and
reggae, is a track that won't have any trouble
packing the dance floor. The Hoodlum's rapid
fire lyrics — floating on top of a raggamuffin
loop reminiscent of Super Cat's "Ghetto Red
Hot" — combine with trumpets and scratches
to contribute a tune which falls in the category
of "funky rap."
Playing the role of an African-American his
tory teacher, the Hoodlum tells a tale of the
black cowboy on "The Posse (Shoot 'Em Up)."
This contribution to the soundtrack of Mario
Van Peebles' "Posse" has booming rhythms
and a hype piano hook reminiscent of an Old
West vaudeville number. The Hoodlum ex
plains to the listener that media and history
books have ignored the fact that blacks were
one-third of the cowboys in the West. His street
acumen is wonderfully articulated by the top
rate production of Marley Marl and his associ
ates.
In all, "Tragedy, Saga of a Hoodlum" is a
solid offering from an up-and-coming hip-hop
artist. With this album, Intelligent Hoodlum
demonstrates just how far hip-hop has come
from its early '80s roots.
