The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy. Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Edith Wharton's bizarre love
triangle, but the script and direction
hang Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona
Ryder out to dry. The verdict: aes
thetic masterpiece, emotional mis
fire. PG
The Ballad of Little Jo
Holy gender-benders, Batman! An
inversion of "The Crying Game" set
in the Wild West, this film focuses on
Josephine Monahan, a society girl
turned cowboy-in-drag — hence,
the moniker "Little Jo." The film is no
rousing action-adventure, but its
subversive deconstruction of gen
der roles is highly entertaining R
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport in which a black man or
woman can't excel?" and answers
with a comically resounding "No."

Unfortunately it's not the movie its
actors (Doug E. Doug, Leon and
John Candy, among others) or film
makers (Michael Goldberg, Dawn
Steel) believe it to be. The real-life
struggle of the first Jamaican bob
sled team in history, it's cute, it's
warm, it's fuzzy... provided you
like being paraded around like a
puppet. Still, it's the kind of light
hearted family fare that's hard to dis
miss entirely PG
Dazed and Confused
Part "Nashville," part "School Daze,"
all "Up In Smoke." That's the best
way to describe writer-director
Richard Linklater's latest film, which
goes back to the future, circa 1976,
to deliver a sly rebuke to the hypo
critical morality of the "Me Decade."
By refusing to wallow in nostalgia,
he comes up with a witty, vital look
at a single day and night of high
school hijinks that today's youth will
appreciate. R
For Love or Money
Michael J Fox plays his usual lik
able Alex P. Keaton character in this

story of a young man trying to get
ahead. But Gabrielle Anwar's brutal
izing performance, along with
pedestrian humor and a limp story
line, topple Fox's best efforts to pull
off typical summer fluff that's not
even good fluff and only intermit
tently funny. PG
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and gor
geous, gorgeous, gorgeous ... this
adaptation of Amy Tan's bestseller is
all of the above. Moving despite its
blatant commercialism, "The Joy
Luck Club" does a splendid job of
bringing the novel to life and marks a
monumental first for Asian-Americans
in Hollywood. R
The Secret Garden
A fine adaptation of the well-loved
novel. Director Agnieszka Holland
("Europa, Europa") is well-attuned
to the work's darker elements —
abandonment, incest and illness —
as well as its metaphor for puberty
and sexual awakening. She extracts
fine performances from the entire
cast without overly sentimentalizing

the story. You might not be moved
to tears, but this film will certainly
hold your interest. G
Striking Distance
Bruce Willis, playing a renegade
homicide detective attempting to
solve a serial killer case, unsucces
fully attempts to create a film of "Die
Hard" caliber. "Striking Distance"
has all the key elements of a suc
cessful film — sex, violence and an
actor with a bad-boy-attitude, but it
fails to do anything creative. You
would think tnat actors like Bruce
Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker
could do something to spice up the
plot R
Undercover Blues
Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid
prove that two spies are slightly
worse than three men when it
comes to babies. Although much of
the humor is predictable, the duo's
acting rescues a mediocre script
and makes the movie almost funny
But watch for a character called
"Morty" to steal the screen and your
chuckles. PG-13
