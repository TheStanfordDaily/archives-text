# A 						tumbling act

### 
So you're tired of the typical a cappella and frat party Fri
day nights on the Farm. How about the Flying Karamazov
Brothers? Performing Oct. 8 at 8 pm in Memorial Auditori
um, they promise to perform "The Gamble," challenging
the audience to come up with three objects to juggle. If the
brothers fail to balance them, the penalty is a pie in the face.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office at 725-
ARTS.
