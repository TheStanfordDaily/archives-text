# I lost on Jeopardy!

"Wheel of Fortune" it's not, but
on Monday, Oct 10, Rolling Stone
Magazine will be staging its own
game show in White Plaza. The
"Rock and Roll Bowl" starts at 10:30
a.m. with teams of three students
answering multiple choice ques
tions for prizes such as Haagen-
Dazs ice cream and stereo equip
ment.
The teams will compete for the
grand prize: a 1994 Ford Mustang
and the chance to advance to the
semi-finals in Los Angeles. Stand
up comedian Mario Joyner will
emcee and provide a free comedy
show after the event.
Just like "Jeopardy."
