# The 						last word on...

### 
When I was little, "Sesame
Street" and "The Electric Com
pany" provided good, whole
some entertainment. I think I
turned out okay, but TV execs
just had to come up with a
Michael Jordan-sized purple felt
dinosaur to "modernize" chil
dren's programing.
With his miniature United

Nations children's chorus,
Barney lacks the imagina
tion to come up with his

own tunes. Singing "I Love You,
You Love Me" to the tune of
"This Old Man Came Rolling
Home" does not count as a phe
nomenon. He's just no Mr.
Rogers, and as far as I'm con
cerned, we're just not in his
neighborhood.
But that doesn't stop him
from appearing on — and jack

ing up the prices of — back
packs, lunchboxes and many
other school-time necessities.
Unfortunately this Jurassic misfit
has pint-sized future Stanford
students goggle-eyed and drool
ing and their parents digging
deep in their pocketbooks.
Please, Mom and Dad, bring
back the Muppets!
