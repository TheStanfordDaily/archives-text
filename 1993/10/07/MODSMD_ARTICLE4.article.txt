# UCMI response reflects back-to-basics approach
## Greater focus on interactive pluralism 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
Multiculturalism, interactive pluralism,
transculturalism, affirmative action . . .
No one ever accused the University of not
having enough terms to describe the con
cept of diversity.
The recently released official cabinet re
sponse to the 1991 Report of the Universi
ty Committee on Minority Issues Review
Panel constitutes one of Stanford's many
attempts to give concrete meaning to the
catch phrases.
In 1989, the UCMI issued a landmark
report intended to define the University's
multicultural goals, focusing not only on
the traditional goal of affirmative action,
but also on "interactive pluralism," the
idea of promoting greater interaction be
tween diverse communities.
But as the University worked to project
the UCMI vision onto all aspects of campus
life — from dorms to classrooms — many
felt Stanford's goals, while still admirable,
had become too grounded in abstract
rhetoric rather than concrete action, a
change often associated with the term
"multiculturalism."
The recent cabinet response, however,
reiterates the UCMI's original emphasis on
interactive pluralism as well as affirmative
action.
Many Stanford community members
say this return to the initial UCMI goals —
punctuated by the re-focusing of the Office
of Multicultural Development and other
related developments — has reaffirmed

Return to affirmative action
Cecilia Burciaga, who acted as affirma
tive action officer from 1989 to 1990 and
initiated the first annual review panel, said
she sees the University "going back to what
historically has worked. What has worked
is affirmative action. . . . (University Presi
dent Gerhard) Casper took an old model
and put it into place."
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Diana
Akiyama said the UCMI's renewed focus
on affirmative action is a sign that the
University "is taking the report serious
ly"
In 1990, the Affirmative Action Office
became the Office for Multicultural Devel
opment, charged with overseeing the
UCMI review process and implementation.
This led to "a de-emphasis of some of the of
fice's historic functions and responsibili
ties," according to the Executive Summary
of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee Report
on the Office for Multicultural Develop
ment.
Rut even as the University now returns
to affirmative action, Akiyama stressed that
it needs to "take a hard look at the term's
current working definition" as something
more comprehensive than racial quotas.
"The common assumption that affirmative
action is purely numbers is degrad
ing to the idea," said Akiyama, a
member of the 1990 and 1991
UCMI review panels.
'Interactive pluralism'
In addition to affirmative
action re-emerging as a top prior
ity for the administration, the
term interactive pluralism is
overshadowing multiculturalism
as the UCMI's catch phrase for
diversity.
The idea of "interactive plu
ralism" stems from the original
UCMI report's finding in 1989
that Stanford's campus activities
and resources had not kept pace
with its "unprecedented racial
diversity."
Burciaga said she feels that in
1988, the University's "numbers
(of people of color) were large
enough where it was not good
enough just to have diversity if
people were not comfortable and
could not feel free about who
they were."
The 1989 report concluded
that a "new commitment" was
necessary — a "transition from
numerical diversity to interactive
pluralism." The report also
states, "We must find ways for
our racial minorities and majori
ty to acknowledge and build
respect for their similarities as
well as their differences."
Casper's recent Orientation
speech to the freshman class,
"Concerning Culture and Cul
tures," affirmed a young admin
istration's commitment to
"interactive pluralism," said
Burciaga, who is also vice provost
for student affairs and Casa Zap
ata resident fellow.
"Casper surprised many peo
ple last week with his talk. . . .
Now he has reinstituted interac
tive pluralism," she said, adding
that previously, there was a feel
ing "around campus that the
president didn't think these
issues were important."
Last spring, some students
expressed doubts about the
administration's interest in mul
ticultural issues, said Burciaga.
Many felt their input had not
been incorporated in the cabi
net's draft response to the UCMI
review panel, and perceived that
the document took a stance that
ethnic theme houses and com
munity centers may promote
" self- segregation."
Akiyama said she is optimistic
about the recent return to the
terminology of the original
UCMI report, but she is "con

cerned that attention is focused
on the definition so that it
doesn't get tired and cynical."
Defining 'multiculturalism'
The term "multiculturalism,"
often associated with the broad-

ening scope of
UCMI and the
Office for Multi
cultural Devel
opment between
1990 and the
present, has
evolved from a
novel concept of
racial awareness
to an idea so con-

troversial and riddled with impli
cations that many are afraid to
use the "m-word."
Akiyama said both conserva
tive and progressive people have
come to regard the term with
cynicism. "It sounds like the title
of a recipe that you can just add
water to and stir," she said.
The May 1993 draft of the cab
inet's response to the 1991
UCMI review reflects an acute
awareness of how jaded the term
"multiculturalism" had become
for many — so acute that the

cabinet considered trashing it
altogether.
The most recent cabinet
response acknowledges that mul
ticulturalism has become a
vaguely defined term, but states
that the operational definition of
multiculturalism implies "a com
mitment to actively learning
about and interacting with a
variety of people."
The short-lived appearance of
the term "transculturalism"
into the UCMI dialogue elicited
more confusion than outrage or
support among members of the
University community. Draft
author and Law School Dean
Paul Brest suggested that the
"ambiguous and politically
fraught" term "multicultural
ism" be replaced with "transcul
turalism," a "vision of interac
tion rather than separation."
Perhaps because many people
had befuddled reactions to the
term "transculturalism," it
never rears its head — ugly or
not — in the final cabinet
response.
Nevertheless, the final
response still emphasizes "inter
action rather than separation,"

stating, "In contrast to historical
practices of exclusion, a multicul
tural or plural university encour
ages inclusion and interaction."
The future: a broader scope
Some at Stanford emphasize
that part of the redefinition of
campus diversity must address a
movement toward expanding the
scope of target groups. While mul
ticultural progress is often
described as a forward or back
ward movement, its future direc
tion must also expand outward,
increasing in breadth as well as
depth.
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resident
Fellow Andrew Lisac said that in
the last few years, he has seen a
positive movement toward
expanding the concept beyond
the four targeted ethnic commu
nities to include other ethnic
groups, such as Arab-Americans
and Jewish-Americans, as well as
women, gay, lesbian and bisexual
people and disabled people.
"Who is to say we are the mul
ticultural and you are not?"
Lisac said. "We are moving
toward a more sophisticated
understanding of the issue."

In May 1989, 55 students were arrested for taking over then-University President Donald Kennedy's
office. The protesters were frustrated with what they perceived as a lack of support for multicultural
issues and the dismissal of student opinion.

Multiculturalism, interactive pluralism,

No one ever accused the University of not
having enough terms to describe the con
cept of diversity.
The recently released official cabinet re
sponse to the 1991 Report of the Universi
ty Committee on Minority Issues Review
Panel constitutes one of Stanford's many
attempts to give concrete meaning to the
catch phrases.
In 1989, the UCMI issued a landmark
report intended to define the University's
multicultural goals, focusing not only on
the traditional goal of affirmative action,
but also on "interactive pluralism," the
idea of promoting greater interaction be
tween diverse communities.
But as the University worked to project
the UCMI vision onto all aspects of campus
life — from dorms to classrooms — many
felt Stanford's goals, while still admirable,
had become too grounded in abstract
rhetoric rather than concrete action, a
change often associated with the term
"multiculturalism."
The recent cabinet response, however,
reiterates the UCMI's original emphasis on
interactive pluralism as well as affirmative
action.

Return to affirmative action
Cecilia Burciaga, who acted as affirma
tive action officer from 1989 to 1990 and
initiated the first annual review panel, said
she sees the University "going back to what
historically has worked. What has worked
is affirmative action. . . . (University Presi
dent Gerhard) Casper took an old model
and put it into place."
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Diana
Akiyama said the UCMI's renewed focus
on affirmative action is a sign that the
University "is taking the report serious
ly"
In 1990, the Affirmative Action Office
became the Office for Multicultural Devel
opment, charged with overseeing the
UCMI review process and implementation.
This led to "a de-emphasis of some of the of
fice's historic functions and responsibili
ties," according to the Executive Summary
of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee Report
on the Office for Multicultural Develop
ment.
Rut even as the University now returns
to affirmative action, Akiyama stressed that
it needs to "take a hard look at the term's
current working definition" as something
more comprehensive than racial quotas.
"The common assumption that affirmative
action is purely numbers is degrad
ing to the idea," said Akiyama, a
member of the 1990 and 1991
UCMI review panels.
'Interactive pluralism'
In addition to affirmative
action re-emerging as a top prior
ity for the administration, the
term interactive pluralism is
overshadowing multiculturalism
as the UCMI's catch phrase for
diversity.
The idea of "interactive plu
ralism" stems from the original
UCMI report's finding in 1989
that Stanford's campus activities
and resources had not kept pace
with its "unprecedented racial
diversity."
Burciaga said she feels that in
1988, the University's "numbers
(of people of color) were large
enough where it was not good
enough just to have diversity if
people were not comfortable and
could not feel free about who
they were."
The 1989 report concluded
that a "new commitment" was
necessary — a "transition from
numerical diversity to interactive
pluralism." The report also
states, "We must find ways for
our racial minorities and majori
ty to acknowledge and build
respect for their similarities as
well as their differences."
Casper's recent Orientation
speech to the freshman class,
"Concerning Culture and Cul
tures," affirmed a young admin
istration's commitment to
"interactive pluralism," said
Burciaga, who is also vice provost
for student affairs and Casa Zap
ata resident fellow.
"Casper surprised many peo
ple last week with his talk. . . .
Now he has reinstituted interac
tive pluralism," she said, adding
that previously, there was a feel
ing "around campus that the
president didn't think these
issues were important."
Last spring, some students
expressed doubts about the
administration's interest in mul
ticultural issues, said Burciaga.
Many felt their input had not
been incorporated in the cabi
net's draft response to the UCMI
review panel, and perceived that
the document took a stance that
ethnic theme houses and com
munity centers may promote
" self- segregation."
Akiyama said she is optimistic
about the recent return to the
terminology of the original
UCMI report, but she is "con

cerned that attention is focused
on the definition so that it
doesn't get tired and cynical."
Defining 'multiculturalism'
The term "multiculturalism,"
often associated with the broad-

ening scope of
UCMI and the
Office for Multi
cultural Devel
opment between
1990 and the
present, has
evolved from a
novel concept of
racial awareness
to an idea so con-

troversial and riddled with impli
cations that many are afraid to
use the "m-word."
Akiyama said both conserva
tive and progressive people have
come to regard the term with
cynicism. "It sounds like the title
of a recipe that you can just add
water to and stir," she said.
The May 1993 draft of the cab
inet's response to the 1991
UCMI review reflects an acute
awareness of how jaded the term
"multiculturalism" had become
for many — so acute that the

cabinet considered trashing it
altogether.
The most recent cabinet
response acknowledges that mul
ticulturalism has become a
vaguely defined term, but states
that the operational definition of
multiculturalism implies "a com
mitment to actively learning
about and interacting with a
variety of people."
The short-lived appearance of
the term "transculturalism"
into the UCMI dialogue elicited
more confusion than outrage or
support among members of the
University community. Draft
author and Law School Dean
Paul Brest suggested that the
"ambiguous and politically
fraught" term "multicultural
ism" be replaced with "transcul
turalism," a "vision of interac
tion rather than separation."
Perhaps because many people
had befuddled reactions to the
term "transculturalism," it
never rears its head — ugly or
not — in the final cabinet
response.
Nevertheless, the final
response still emphasizes "inter
action rather than separation,"

stating, "In contrast to historical
practices of exclusion, a multicul
tural or plural university encour
ages inclusion and interaction."
The future: a broader scope
Some at Stanford emphasize
that part of the redefinition of
campus diversity must address a
movement toward expanding the
scope of target groups. While mul
ticultural progress is often
described as a forward or back
ward movement, its future direc
tion must also expand outward,
increasing in breadth as well as
depth.
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resident
Fellow Andrew Lisac said that in
the last few years, he has seen a
positive movement toward
expanding the concept beyond
the four targeted ethnic commu
nities to include other ethnic
groups, such as Arab-Americans
and Jewish-Americans, as well as
women, gay, lesbian and bisexual
people and disabled people.
"Who is to say we are the mul

Fellow Andrew Lisac said that in
the last few years, he has seen a
positive movement toward
expanding the concept beyond
the four targeted ethnic commu

groups, such as Arab-Americans
and Jewish-Americans, as well as
women, gay, lesbian and bisexual
people and disabled people.
"Who is to say we are the mul
ticultural and you are not?"
Lisac said. "We are moving
toward a more sophisticated
understanding of the issue."
