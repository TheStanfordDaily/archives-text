# UCMI response reflects back-to-basics approach
## Greater focus on interactive pluralism

Multiculturalism, interactive pluralism,
transculturalism, affirmative action . . .
No one ever accused the University of not
having enough terms to describe the con
cept of diversity.
The recently released official cabinet re
sponse to the 1991 Report of the Universi
ty Committee on Minority Issues Review
Panel constitutes one of Stanford's many
attempts to give concrete meaning to the
catch phrases.
In 1989, the UCMI issued a landmark
report intended to define the University's
multicultural goals, focusing not only on
the traditional goal of affirmative action,
but also on "interactive pluralism," the
idea of promoting greater interaction be
tween diverse communities.
But as the University worked to project
the UCMI vision onto all aspects of campus
life — from dorms to classrooms — many
felt Stanford's goals, while still admirable,
had become too grounded in abstract
rhetoric rather than concrete action, a
change often associated with the term
"multiculturalism."
The recent cabinet response, however,
reiterates the UCMI's original emphasis on
interactive pluralism as well as affirmative
action.
Many Stanford community members
say this return to the initial UCMI goals —
punctuated by the re-focusing of the Office
of Multicultural Development and other
related developments — has reaffirmed

initiated the first annual review panel, said
she sees the University "going back to what
historically has worked. What has worked
is affirmative action. . . . (University Presi
dent Gerhard) Casper took an old model
and put it into place."
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Diana
Akiyama said the UCMI's renewed focus
on affirmative action is a sign that the
University "is taking the report serious
ly"
In 1990, the Affirmative Action Office
became the Office for Multicultural Devel
opment, charged with overseeing the
UCMI review process and implementation.
This led to "a de-emphasis of some of the of
fice's historic functions and responsibili
ties," according to the Executive Summary
of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee Report
on the Office for Multicultural Develop
ment.
Rut even as the University now returns
to affirmative action, Akiyama stressed that
it needs to "take a hard look at the term's
current working definition" as something
more comprehensive than racial quotas.
"The common assumption that affirmative
