# Many skeptical of voucher proposal
## Group co-directed by Education Prof. Michael Kirst conducts poll

Though most Californians favor the
general concept of school vouchers, many
are wary that the specifics of Proposition
174 — a school voucher proposal on the
Nov. 2 ballot — could hurt public schools
instead of help them, according to an in
dependent think tank co-directed by Ed
ucation Prof. Michael Kirst.
The group, Policy Analysis for Califor
nia Education (PACE), polled 1,400 Cali
fornians about the widely debated initia
tive, which would amend California's
constitution to give every student a
$2,600 voucher usable at any school —
public, private or parochial.
The poll indicated several trends, ac
cording to Kirst, co-director of the think
tank, which is based at Stanford and UC-

Berkeley.
Californians consider education a high
priority, are not happy with the current
public school system and like the general
concept of school choice, Kirst said.
However, he added, many wanted
more regulation of voucher-redeeming
private schools than the proposal would
mandate. For example, 60 percent said
that such schools should be required to
hire state-certified teachers.
PACE also published a report that an
alyzed the varied projections on whether
the amendment would save or cost the
state money. There was no clear consen
sus.
"Since this is major, non-incremental
change. . . there is no clear analytical
basis to predict whether this would lose
