# Many skeptical of voucher proposal
## Group co-directed by Education Prof. Michael Kirst conducts poll 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Though most Californians favor the
general concept of school vouchers, many
are wary that the specifics of Proposition
174 — a school voucher proposal on the
Nov. 2 ballot — could hurt public schools
instead of help them, according to an in
dependent think tank co-directed by Ed
ucation Prof. Michael Kirst.
The group, Policy Analysis for Califor
nia Education (PACE), polled 1,400 Cali
fornians about the widely debated initia
tive, which would amend California's
constitution to give every student a
$2,600 voucher usable at any school —
public, private or parochial.
The poll indicated several trends, ac
cording to Kirst, co-director of the think
tank, which is based at Stanford and UC-

Berkeley.
Californians consider education a high
priority, are not happy with the current
public school system and like the general
concept of school choice, Kirst said.
However, he added, many wanted
more regulation of voucher-redeeming
private schools than the proposal would
mandate. For example, 60 percent said
that such schools should be required to
hire state-certified teachers.
PACE also published a report that an
alyzed the varied projections on whether
the amendment would save or cost the
state money. There was no clear consen
sus.
"Since this is major, non-incremental
change. . . there is no clear analytical
basis to predict whether this would lose

money or save money," Kirst said.
"There is nothing to compare
[Proposition 174] with. We have
no examples of vouchers on this
scale. We just have pure theory,"
he said.
The only voucher experiment —
which involves just 600 elemen
tary school students in Milwaukee
— cannot be compared to the sys
tem California may implement,
Kirst said, pointing out that the
Milwaukee program didn't even
include religious schools.
Initially, the initiative could
cost the state as much as $1.35 bil
lion as California's 540,000 private
school students are phased in to
the voucher program.
However, Kirst speculated that

some parents and private schools
might choose to stay out of the sys
tem to avoid the perception of state
control.
If enough students choose to
leave public schools, the program
could pump more money into Cal
ifornia public schools. The exodus
would save the state money
because each student would only
take their $2,600 voucher out of
public school coffers. California
spends about $5,000 per pupil.
According to PACE, one sce
nario predicts that about 17 per
cent of public school students
(864,000) would have to switch to
private schools for the state to
break even.
If that happened, the state's pri
vate schools would have to triple in
capacity by the 1995-96 academic
year.
But there is no way to predict
how many students would move,

Kirst said.
"We've never had a subsidized
market for private education, so
how do you predict the outcome?"
he asked.
Kirst said that the proposal
could save the state as much as $6
billion — or it could cost the state
more than $1 billion.
Political Science Prof. Terry
Moe, a supporter of the initiative,
criticized the bureaucracy of Cali
fornia's public school system.
"When do they close bad schools?
Never. When do they fire bad
teachers? Never. What kind of
accountability is that?"
He discounted the claim made
by California Governor Pete Wil
son — a Republican who opposes
the measure — and others that the
proposal could hurt California:
"It's not going to bankrupt the
state. That's ridiculous."
On the argument that it could

violate the separation of church
and state provision of the U.S.
Constitution, Moe said that "the
basic principle here is [that the
money] is going to the parents.
They make the decision on who
gets it.
"A good analogy is the G.I. Bill.
[American servicemen used vouch
ers] to go to places like Notre
Dame and Yeshiva University.
There was no outcry back then."
Under the proposed system, "all
schools will have to be responsible
to parents," Moe said.
"I think people should have a
choice.... They ought to be able to
go to [the school of their choice] and
let the money follow them," Moe
explained. "That money belongs to
the people of California."
Moe also discounted calls for a
more regulated voucher system,
saying that regulations "certainly
haven't helped" the public schools.
