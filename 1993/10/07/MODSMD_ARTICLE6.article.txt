# Business School sprouts 'green' courses
## 
### Danny Siciliano 
More people at the Graduate School of
Business are thinking green these days
— but it's got nothing to do with money.
In response to recent trends in corpo
rate America, the Business School has
gradually been incorporating more envi
ronmentally oriented courses, seminars
and projects into its curricula, focusing
on the interactions between the environ

ment and the economy.
And it is taking a leadership role
among other business schools, with its
participation in a pilot program in envi
ronmental management education. The
program is led by the Management Insti
tute for Environment and Business
(MKB), a non-profit organization based
in Washington, D.C.
MEB has kept close ties with Stanford
since its creation two years ago. Three of

the 12 full-time staff hail from Stan
ford's MBA program and three Stanford
affiliated members serve on its board of
directors.
The Business School and MEB are re
sponding to the growing importance of
the environment to businesses today. In
a recent survey conducted by MEB,
many companies reported that environ-
mental costs exceed 10 percent of
their operating expenditures.
That same report estimated that
environmental protection
accounts for about 2 percent of
the U.S. gross national product
and is likely to climb to 3 percent
by the end of the decade.
On campus, the Business
School is responding to this trend
by creating programs, courses
and seminars that deal with the
environment.
"In 1987 very few of the
nation's 700 business schools
offered environmental manage
ment courses," MEB Chair
William Miller, professor of public
and private management at the
Business School, wrote in his
introduction to the report.
In the past few years, the Busi
ness School has offered courses in
environmental management and
conducted an Environmental
Awareness Week as a part of its
Public Management Initiative.

Part of the Business School's
Public Management Program,
students in the initiative choose
the focus of their studies. Several
times over the past five years, the
students focused on the environ
ment.
"Environmental Management
and Policy Analysis," a course
developed by Business School
Prof. Jeremy Bulow, is one of a
handful of environmentally
focused activities currently
underway. Bulow's course has
been offered for two years in
spring quarter and will be comple
mented this year by a new course,
"Environmental Management,"
offered in winter quarter.
These course offerings are part
of the result of past MBA stu
dents' efforts, said Dirk Long,
executive director of MEB. Past
students have worked to develop
courses and similar environmen
tal projects, he said. Bulow esti
mated that continued offerings of
environmental courses in the
Business School will depend in
large part on the interest levels of
students.
MEB, for its part, has worked

to create course materials that
address the interaction of the
environment with distinct sub
ject areas such as production or
accounting. The materials are
designed for faculty members to
incorporate into classes and sem
inars. MEB hopes to make envi
ronmental information more eas
ily accessible to both students
and faculty, said Business Prof.
James Patell, an MEB board
member.
As a result of MEB's activities
and institutions like Stanford,
Miller pointed out, "Today there
are courses (on the environment)
offered or under development at
more than 50 schools."
Long, who earned a 1989 Stan
ford MBA, is quick to note that
despite the progress at other
institutions, Stanford's environ
mental education "has a number
of distinguishing characteristics."
"Most notably" he said,
"Stanford has access to audi
ences that are important and has
a direct pipeline to leading busi
nesses that can make change in
the field of environmental man
agement."
