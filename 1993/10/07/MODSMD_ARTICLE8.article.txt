Wisconsin bans racist teams
The University of Wisconsin won't be playing
all of their usual opponents this year. Various
teams who have names that are degrading to
Native Americans will be omitted from the play
ing schedule. The same will go for teams that
have otherwise racist or offensive mascots.
Teams such as the Alcorn State Scalping
Braves will be boycotted by the Badgers this
year due to a movement that started with facul
ty, students, alumni and staff and moved into
the faculty senate. The teams also will be
encouraged not to sell souvenirs bearing slogans
or mascots on the Wisconsin campus.
However, traditional rivals in the Big Ten con
ference, including the Marquette Warriors and
the University of Illinois Fighting Illini, will not
be boycotted. Only non-conference teams will be
subject to the boycott.
Some Wisconsin students expressed concern
that the current policy — which won't change the

Big Ten schedule — doesn't go far enough to stop
racism. But James Hoyt, chair of the athletic
board at Wisconsin, said the policy is not expected
to be revised in the near future.
Yale's gays fight for benefits
A committee at Yale University has recom
mended that gay and lesbian couples at the uni
versity have access to the same health benefits
available to heterosexual couples.
After two years of conflict over this issue at
Yale, questions remain about extending benefits
to homosexual couples that are not university
employees or family members — such as graduate
students — since they are not recognized as legal
families in the state of Connecticut.
The committee which made the recommenda
tions studied other schools that grant various
benefits to domestic partners, including Stanford,
Harvard and MIT.
