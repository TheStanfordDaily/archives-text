Law to I.D. species
WASHINGTON (AP) — Amid out
cries by opponents that property values
could be destroyed, the House debated
legislation yesterday that would empow
er the government to conduct its first
coast-to-coast hunt for endangered
species.
The measure, a priority of President
Clinton and Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, would send an army of federal
inspectors out to catalogue exactly
where America's plants and animals
live.
They would need permission to enter
private property.
Opponents complained that the plan
could harm property owners because if
an endangered species were to be found
on their land, existing federal regula
tions could limit or forbid develop
ment.
Supporters say the survey would help
the government avoid bitter battles such
as have occurred in the Northwest,
where logging has been curtailed to pro
tect the habitat of the endangered
northern spotted owl.
U.N. troops go to Rwanda
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - At a
time when its peacekeeping operations
are coming under mounting criticism,
the United Nations has approved a new
mission to send 2,800 troops to Rwan
da.
They will be deployed for six months
to monitor a cease-fire accord between
warring factions and prepare for new

elections. The Rwanda force, approved
Tuesday night by the Security Council,
will include 331 military observers.
Rivalry between the majority Hutus
and minority Tutsi has led to blood
shed over the past three decades in the
small central African nation. The war
ring parties signed a peace accord Aug.
4 to end the latest fighting, which
began in October 1990, killing thou
sands and making more than 1 million
homeless.
Yeltsin gets tough
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris
Yeltsin followed his bloody victory over
hard-line lawmakers with a demand yes
terday that opponents in the provinces
resign, and he yanked the ceremonial
guard from Lenin's Tomb — a symbolic
but potent blow against Communist
holdovers.
In a stern, commanding voice on
nationwide television, Yeltsin said elec
tions should be held in December for
every legislative body in the country —
not just for a new national parliament as
he previously decreed.
His aim clearly was to use the
momentum of Monday's climactic battle
with hard-liners from the dissolved par
liament to sweep his opponents out of
office in cities and regions from Karelia
in the west to Kamchatka in the Far
East.
During yesterday's 15-minute
address on primetime TV, Yeltsin said
everyone who had taken up arms
against the government would be prose
cuted to the full extent of the law.
