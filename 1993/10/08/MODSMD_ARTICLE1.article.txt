# Big Game Bonfire canceled to protect salamanders
## Annual event would 'undoubtedly cook' recently returned animals 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
The salamanders are back, and this time
they have canceled the Big Game Bonfire.
According to campus planner Drew Oman,
this is just one step the University is taking to
protect the re-emergence in Lake Lagunita of
the California tiger salamander, a species once
thought to be extinct from the Peninsula.
A petition to the state by a UC-Davis re
searcher urging the protection of the six-inch
black salamander under the Endangered
Species Act prompted the decision to cancel the
bonfire. Oman said that the University "is con
ducting business as if the species was already
categorized as endangered."

Although there will be no bonfire this year,
chairman of the Axe Committee, senior Steve
Zika, said he guarantees "there will be an event
the Thursday night of Big Game weekend, and
... it will include the traditional rally with the
football team and, if at all possible, a small cer
emonial fire for no other reason than to main
tain tradition."
The increased evidence of the salamanders'
re-emergence will also force the Kappa Alpha
fraternity to change the venue of their annual
winter mud volleyball tournament.
Oman said that Stanford received advice
from both Stanford's Center for Conservation
Biology and the Coyote Creek Riparian Center
that the salamander will ultimately fall under
the act.

According to Mike Rigney of Coyote Creek,
"the Stanford population of salamanders is one
of the largest remaining populations of this
proposed endangered species in California."
Biologists from Coyote Creek studied the
growing tiger salamander population on cam
pus last winter when the University paid the
firm $8,000 to assess the ecological impact of
building new student housing on the Knoll.
The biologists found that the majority of the
population lives in the lake-bed and in the area
of the foothills across Junipero Serra Boule
vard, but some salamanders have also been
found in other grassland areas surrounding
the lake.

According to Rigney, the sala
manders are "geared to rain" and
are drawn to Lake Lagunita during
the first winter rains. They eventu
ally lay their eggs there and stay in
the lake throughout the spring.
When the rains stop and the
lake is drained at the beginning of
the summer, the salamanders "go
into a state of hibernation" and
move to living in the cracks in the
mud and under the dock at the
lake, Rigney said.
"Between the road kills and the
animals we found," Rigney said,
the group calculates the salaman
der population to be at least 400.
Coyote Creek issued the final
report of their research to the Uni
versity on May 29 and, according
to Rigney, it said that along with
possible Knoll housing projects,
"the bonfire and [KA's] mud vol
leyball are inconsistent in Stan
ford's desire to take a leading role
to protect" the tiger salamander.
"A bonfire undoubtedly cooks
quite a few of the salamanders
that live in the cracks," he said.
Duncan Elkins, a senior who
works at Stanford's conservation
center, added that the center felt
"it would not be safe to continue to
have the bonfire until we know
more about the salamanders."
The center is currently
attempting to study the behavioral
patterns of the salamanders,
Elkins added.
KA president Chris Morace said
that his fraternity decided also to
comply with the report and not
hold their annual mud volleyball
tournament in the lake-bed. It will
be held instead on one of the fields
next to Stanford Stadium, pending
final approval from the Athletics
Department.
Saying that the "only reason
[theyl are moving the tournament
is because of the salamanders,"
Morace added that the members of

his fraternity came to a consensus
that they "don't want to kill off
one species to help another."
While mud volleyball will be
moved, Oman said that he and
Zika discussed other possible
places on campus to have the bon
fire. But they came to the conclu
sion that the lake-bed is really the
only area suitable area for accom
modating both the fire and the
large crowd it draws every year.
Sophomore Mamie Hsien said
she sees the decision to cancel the
fire as "understandable," adding it
is difficult to find a balance
between "a few hours of fun
watching a fire and risking the life
of a numbered species."
But, she said, "it is too bad this
good, old tradition has to end."
Zika said that it definitely was a
tough decision to make and he feels
"worst of all about all the frosh."
Insisting that the bonfire is not
being canceled forever, Zika said
he hopes somehow the bonfire will

return next year so the new mem
bers of the Stanford community do
not have to wait too long to wit
ness the 250-foot blaze.
According to Zika, the Axe
Committee is looking at alterna
tive sites and events for the Nov.
18 rally. He said they are talking
with the Stanford Concert Net
work and the Office of Student
Activities and considering a con
cert, fireworks or a laser show
either in Frost Amphitheater or in
the area between Memorial Audi
torium and Hoover Tower.
[The Band] will definitely be
there," he said, adding that the
Axe Committee should have final
ized plans by next week.
The bonfire is a Stanford tradi
tion that dates back to 1898.
Although it was not held from 1976
to 1985 due to crowd and safety
concerns, and again in 1989
because of a lack of student fund
ing, this event "is truly one of the
great campus traditions," Zika said.
