# Big Game Bonfire canceled to protect salamanders
## Annual event would 'undoubtedly cook' recently returned animals

The salamanders are back, and this time
they have canceled the Big Game Bonfire.
According to campus planner Drew Oman,
this is just one step the University is taking to
protect the re-emergence in Lake Lagunita of
the California tiger salamander, a species once
thought to be extinct from the Peninsula.
A petition to the state by a UC-Davis re
searcher urging the protection of the six-inch
black salamander under the Endangered
Species Act prompted the decision to cancel the
bonfire. Oman said that the University "is con
ducting business as if the species was already
categorized as endangered."

Although there will be no bonfire this year,
chairman of the Axe Committee, senior Steve
Zika, said he guarantees "there will be an event
the Thursday night of Big Game weekend, and
... it will include the traditional rally with the
football team and, if at all possible, a small cer
emonial fire for no other reason than to main
tain tradition."
The increased evidence of the salamanders'
re-emergence will also force the Kappa Alpha
fraternity to change the venue of their annual
winter mud volleyball tournament.
Oman said that Stanford received advice
from both Stanford's Center for Conservation
Biology and the Coyote Creek Riparian Center
that the salamander will ultimately fall under
the act.

According to Mike Rigney of Coyote Creek,
"the Stanford population of salamanders is one
of the largest remaining populations of this
proposed endangered species in California."
Biologists from Coyote Creek studied the
growing tiger salamander population on cam
pus last winter when the University paid the
firm $8,000 to assess the ecological impact of
building new student housing on the Knoll.
The biologists found that the majority of the
population lives in the lake-bed and in the area
of the foothills across Junipero Serra Boule
vard, but some salamanders have also been
found in other grassland areas surrounding
the lake.
