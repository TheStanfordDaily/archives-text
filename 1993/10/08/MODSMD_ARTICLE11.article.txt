## Editorial Implement the plan University's new sexual harassment policy needs programs to go with plan 
### 
THE NEW University policy
on sexual harassment re
flects over two years of con
tinuous discussions and revisions.
The policy could have a major
impact on the way sexual harass
ment grievances are handled — but
it could also have very little effect
at all.
One of the strengths of the new
policy is that it expresses a firm
commitment to anonymity, which
should make it much easier for
complainants to bring incidents of
sexual harassment to the Univer
sity's attention. But until people
realize this, episodes of sexual
harassment will be dealt with as
they have been — that is, not at
all. Unless students and faculty
are actively made aware of the
details of the new policy, it will
become no more than another
piece of paper stuffed in the back
of a desk drawer.
In recent years, various campus
organizations have made great
progress in raising awareness on
issues of sexual assault. One such
group is Project HEAR (Height
ened Education on Acquaintance
Rape), whose members facilitate
discussions in student residences
through role-playing. The group's
presentations have been successful
because they pull the issue of
acquaintance rape off the pages of
The Daily and bring it to life in the
dorm lounge.
Unfortunately, there have not
been similar efforts to educate the
Stanford community about sexual
harassment in general. Sexual
assault is one form of harassment
— but it is only one form of many.
The other forms, which are often
more difficult to identify and deal
with, have been virtually ignored in
community education projects.
Interactive presentations that

bring together faculty and students
to discuss sexual harassment are
the key to the success of the Univer
sity's new policy. The vast majority
of sexual harassment incidents at
Stanford occur between a student
and a member of the faculty ; there
fore, it is of the utmost importance
that these two groups are given the
opportunity — and encouraged — to
talk about the issue of sexual
harassment together.
These presentations must also
include detailed information on the
University policy itself, not just on
sexual harassment in general. To
read the document in The Daily or
Campus Report is not enough —
students and faculty need to know
exactly what the section on confi
dentiality covers, and whom they
should speak with first. They need
to know the differences between
informal resolutions and formal
charges. It is only when students
and faculty truly understand the
policy that they will use it.
At present, there are several
organizations on campus whose
aim it is to educate the community
on the various forms of sexual
assault and rape — but there are
none that concentrate solely on the
issue of sexual harassment. This
problem cannot be ignored. We
must immediately begin to educate
Stanford students and faculty
about sexual harassment, and that
education must include the
specifics of Stanford's new sexual
harassment policy.
President Casper, the author of
the new sexual harassment policy,
must not neglect its implementa
tion, which will probably be the
most challenging step in the pro
cess. He must see that faculty and
staff as well as students work
together to develop a method of
educating the entire community so
that everyone will realize the poli
cy's potential effectiveness.
The Administration should be
applauded for its efforts these past
two years to clarify its position on
sexual harassment. But it must not
lose sight of its goal — to ensure
that issues of sexual harassment
are dealt with and not ignored.
