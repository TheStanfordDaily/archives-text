## Mike Perez Help everyone receive an equal education 
### 
MANY OF YOU are returning to
Stanford for yet another year of
college. Some of you are joining
Stanford for the first time. I urge each of
you to take advantage of the many
opportunities available to you at the
Farm.
At the same time, realize that during
your educational experiences at Stan
ford you have the opportunity to help
others.
One example of a need which each of
you can address was the subject of a
report by the American Bar Assn. Work
ing Group on the Unmet Legal Needs of
Children and Their Families.
The ABA Committee published their
report entitled,"America's Children at
Risk, a National Agenda for Legal
Action" in July of 1993. The report sets
forth an agenda to meet the essential
needs of the nation's children, including:
representation of and advocacy for chil
dren and their families; help to working
parents, housing, education, health and
income.
The introduction to the report begins:
"Our society is failing to protect its chil
dren and fails them even more once they
are in crisis."
Examples are provided to demonstrate
the depth of the problem, including the
following:
• Poverty jeopardizes children's
development; it often reduces their IQ,
school performance, health and life

achievement.
• Children — especially the youngest
children — are nearly twice as likely to
live in poverty as any other group of
Americans. Indeed, one in five Ameri
can children lives below the standards
the government acknowledges are
required for bare subsistence. In 1991,
fully 24 percent of this country's
preschool children were living in impov
erished families.
• Child poverty is not limited to the
inner cities — the child poverty rate is
even higher in rural areas than in the
rest of the country.
• Overall, our child poverty rate is
higher than that in any comparable coun
try.
It is painfully obvious that impover
ished children in this country are not
receiving the same attention as upper
class children, and because of deficiencies
in their educations, they are seriously
impaired on their quest for a successful
future.
The ABA report graphically demon
strates the relationship between an edu
cation and a child's future when it con
cludes:
"Educated children are more likely to
grow into productive adults who con
tribute to their community. They are far
less likely than children who lack an ade
quate education to become juvenile delin
quents and adult criminals, to receive
welfare or rely on others for support, or

to have children while still children
themselves.
"According to the Committee on
Economic Development, '[djropouts
are three and a half times as likely as
high-school graduates to be arrested
and six times as likely to be unwed
parents!,l .. . are seven and a half
times as likely as graduates to be
dependent on welfare . . . land] twice
as likely to be unemployed and to live
in poverty.'
Lack of basic skills and marginal lit
eracy mean that the one million
teenagers who drop out of school each
year have gravely diminished chances in
life."
While I was at Stanford I was active
with the Public Service Center, the New
man Center, the Children's Hospital and
El Centro Chicano. Each experience
made me a better person while also giving
me the opportunity to interact with oth
ers in a positive way.
Therefore, I recommend that those of
you interested in public service should
seek to work for an on- or off-campus
organization working to ensure that each
child — regardless of disability, race, gen
der or financial need — receives an edu
cation to which he or she is entitled
under existing law. We will all be better
people for your efforts.
