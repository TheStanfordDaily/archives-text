## University should observe 'common-sense principle' 
### 
JEREMY SMITH dealt effectively
with John Manley's claim that
Stanford fails because it lacks politi
cal morality: politics is very largely
beside the point of what a university is
properly about which is, as Smith
observes, the open discussion of ideas,
learning.
This is, incidentally, the (anti-political
correctness) stand of the National Asso
ciation of Scholars, which has a local
chapter here.
But, though a member, I have pub
licly taken issue with NAS on the values

in question, raised anew by Smith.
The methodical pursuit of open
("Socratic") discussion — our main
effort as teachers — does not preclude,
any more than it did for Socrates, basic
value-givens, such as the bias in favor of
civilized talk. Far more than Smith
implies, we do share a large number of
such values, generally inherited, howev
er tacitly. No matter how tactful a teach
er, those values come through to his stu
dents somehow, and so be it. Let the
best "Show" win . . .
The real difference between Manley's

idea of a university and my own is, then,
double: (a) I demur at the overt politi
cization he favors, which makes for PC
trendiness, lowers standards, by replac
ing vivacious questioning with prema
ture answers — Smith's point — and (b)
the whole thrust of his spiritual energies
is wrong for learning and creating.
As Paul Johnson reminded us in
"Intellectuals," our finest minds have
not always been our most considerate
and loving ones. It turns out that even
Einstein, George Will's model image of
"spirit," had a curmudgeonly side.

We've all had professors like that, some
of the best. Of course, we can't condone
indecencies even in geniuses, but we
don't often get ideal syntheses. When it
comes to tenure, we'd better stick with
proven talent, just as we would on a
professional sports team, or a sympho
ny orchestra, with scarcely a glance at
their political views or their color and
origin. Alas, at Stanford, we have not
all observed that common sense princi
ple.
