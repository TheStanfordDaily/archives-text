## Trying to recover from a strong dose of reality 
### 
GOD HATES ME. And because of
this less-than-optimal relation
ship, I seldom venture into his
house, his humble abode, the gaudy,
overstated tackiness that is Memorial
Church. When I hit the lowest of lows, I
go there to hear the spooky strains of the
organist, reflect in the musty dampness,
and try to force myself to think less
wicked thoughts about humanity.
Only the lowest of lows, mind you.
God with a capital "G" doesn't like me
for my petty, shallow, evil thoughts and my
stubborn resistance to the organized reli
gion that creeps from every corner of Mem
Chu. For this devotion I do not have to the
type of god who would need someone to
gold plate an altar to display their faith.
Last night, however, I made an excep
tion. An exception based on the admira
tion I feel for someone I do not know. An
exception for a tragedy I do not fully
understand and a loss I cannot truly feel.
An exception that was meant as partici
pation in an all-too-small consolation for
friends and family who should not have
to be feeling the confusion they are feel

ing at this moment.
I walked through Mem Chu's doors for
Amy Biehl.
I never knew Amy Biehl. I never rode
my bike through the Quad in the rain
with Amy Biehl. I never laughed out loud,
disrupting the library, with Amy Biehl. I
never sat out in the hall at 4 a.m. dis
cussing my inner child with Amy Biehl.
But there is something about her
story. Something about what I read in
front-page, above-the-fold newspaper
headlines. Something about what she had
accomplished that made me feel it was the
least I could do to settle semi-comfortably
in a pew for her memorial service.
Sit down, stay awhile.
Amy Biehl was a Fulbright scholar.
She wrote a huge honors thesis, I am
told. And I read somewhere that she had
traveled several times to Africa, staking
her claim as a scholar in her field, even as
an undergrad. In a matter of days she
would have been on a plane back to the
U.S. and an awaiting doctoral program.
Amy Biehl was all I ever wanted to be.
And when I heard the story of this

woman I had never met who was killed in
South Africa, I suddenly felt cheated.
Robbed of the perfect vision of the future
I had concocted. Years as a seasoned
world traveler and scholar. Years free of
worries as I visited the friends I had scat
tering the globe. Years that would shape
a life I could look forward to.
Dream a little dream of me.
Nothing would ever happen to me, I
convinced myself as I waved goodbye to
my parents this summer at the airport,
eagerly looking forward to seeing my
Nicaraguan friends again. I could not die,
because it would be too ironic. I was to
conquer the world, and world conquerors
do not get cut off in their prime. They die
at age 83 only after counseling the U.S.
president and appearing on "Nightline"
several times. They never, ever die
anonymously in random acts of violence.
They never, ever suffer "untimely"
deaths.
I spent this whole summer gallivant
ing across Nicaragua, in the midst of
what my parents call "civil strife" — only
now that I am safely home. Driving

through countryside after countryside
where kidnapping, paramilitary groups
run rampant. Eagerly studying what is
generically termed "disorder" by those
who have lost all optimism about the
country's future.
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
When war broke out in my last two
weeks there, my host family joked that
they'd kill the blondes first. My mom and
dad proved unamused as I anxiously
laughed over the phone that they'd be
hearing reports about a nearby town
being seized by guerrillas on the 11 p.m.
news. Nor would they crack a smile when
I pleaded with them not to worry, since I
was safely hidden under the kitchen table.
Tough crowd.
So there I sat in Memorial Church, my
eyes bouncing from downturned face to
downturned face in nervous awkward
ness, guiltily making promises to myself
that I cannot keep. Promises that I would
never have to make my friends be upbeat
in the wake of my death. Never make any
one try to struggle to express the point of
a death that was so obviously unfair.

Never make my dad stand in front of a
crowd and entertain others, trying to keep
the tone light after so many heavy days.
Cry and you cry alone.
So many promises that I cannot keep,
as I frantically try to arrange a chance to
study abroad next year; as I falsely assure
my parents it will not be in Nicaragua; as
I cringe at the image of Amy Biehl's par
ents calling up mine in sympathy and
camaraderie.
I cannot give up my dreams, I cannot
give up the same hope of making a differ
ence which kept Amy Biehl in South
Africa. But now they are both hopelessly,
irrevocably obscured by the sadness and
loss which weighed down Memorial
Church. I will always remember Amy
Biehl, for forcing me to be mortal, to
leave the fairytale of invincibility behind,
to wonder why the world must be such a
dangerous place.
Peace be with you.

house, his humble abode, the gaudy,
overstated tackiness that is Memorial
Church. When I hit the lowest of lows, I
go there to hear the spooky strains of the
organist, reflect in the musty dampness,
and try to force myself to think less
wicked thoughts about humanity.
Only the lowest of lows, mind you.
God with a capital "G" doesn't like me
for my petty, shallow, evil thoughts and my
stubborn resistance to the organized reli
gion that creeps from every corner of Mem
Chu. For this devotion I do not have to the
type of god who would need someone to
gold plate an altar to display their faith.
Last night, however, I made an excep
tion. An exception based on the admira
tion I feel for someone I do not know. An
exception for a tragedy I do not fully
understand and a loss I cannot truly feel.
An exception that was meant as partici
pation in an all-too-small consolation for
friends and family who should not have
to be feeling the confusion they are feel

ing at this moment.
I walked through Mem Chu's doors for
Amy Biehl.
I never knew Amy Biehl. I never rode
my bike through the Quad in the rain
with Amy Biehl. I never laughed out loud,
disrupting the library, with Amy Biehl. I
never sat out in the hall at 4 a.m. dis
cussing my inner child with Amy Biehl.
But there is something about her
story. Something about what I read in
front-page, above-the-fold newspaper
headlines. Something about what she had
accomplished that made me feel it was the
least I could do to settle semi-comfortably
in a pew for her memorial service.
Sit down, stay awhile.
Amy Biehl was a Fulbright scholar.
She wrote a huge honors thesis, I am
told. And I read somewhere that she had
traveled several times to Africa, staking
her claim as a scholar in her field, even as
an undergrad. In a matter of days she
would have been on a plane back to the
U.S. and an awaiting doctoral program.
Amy Biehl was all I ever wanted to be.
And when I heard the story of this

woman I had never met who was killed in
South Africa, I suddenly felt cheated.
Robbed of the perfect vision of the future
I had concocted. Years as a seasoned
world traveler and scholar. Years free of
worries as I visited the friends I had scat
tering the globe. Years that would shape
a life I could look forward to.
Dream a little dream of me.
Nothing would ever happen to me, I
convinced myself as I waved goodbye to
my parents this summer at the airport,
eagerly looking forward to seeing my
Nicaraguan friends again. I could not die,
because it would be too ironic. I was to
conquer the world, and world conquerors
do not get cut off in their prime. They die
at age 83 only after counseling the U.S.
president and appearing on "Nightline"
several times. They never, ever die
anonymously in random acts of violence.
They never, ever suffer "untimely"
deaths.
I spent this whole summer gallivant
ing across Nicaragua, in the midst of
what my parents call "civil strife" — only
now that I am safely home. Driving

through countryside after countryside
where kidnapping, paramilitary groups
run rampant. Eagerly studying what is
generically termed "disorder" by those
who have lost all optimism about the
country's future.
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
When war broke out in my last two
weeks there, my host family joked that
they'd kill the blondes first. My mom and
dad proved unamused as I anxiously
laughed over the phone that they'd be
hearing reports about a nearby town
being seized by guerrillas on the 11 p.m.
news. Nor would they crack a smile when
I pleaded with them not to worry, since I
was safely hidden under the kitchen table.
Tough crowd.
So there I sat in Memorial Church, my
eyes bouncing from downturned face to
downturned face in nervous awkward
ness, guiltily making promises to myself
that I cannot keep. Promises that I would
never have to make my friends be upbeat
in the wake of my death. Never make any
one try to struggle to express the point of
a death that was so obviously unfair.

Never make my dad stand in front of a
crowd and entertain others, trying to keep
the tone light after so many heavy days.
Cry and you cry alone.
So many promises that I cannot keep,
as I frantically try to arrange a chance to
study abroad next year; as I falsely assure
my parents it will not be in Nicaragua; as
I cringe at the image of Amy Biehl's par
ents calling up mine in sympathy and
camaraderie.
I cannot give up my dreams, I cannot
give up the same hope of making a differ
ence which kept Amy Biehl in South
Africa. But now they are both hopelessly,
irrevocably obscured by the sadness and
loss which weighed down Memorial
Church. I will always remember Amy
Biehl, for forcing me to be mortal, to
leave the fairytale of invincibility behind,
to wonder why the world must be such a
dangerous place.
Peace be with you.
