## 'Spotty' early season play concerns Walsh Football coach discusses Cardinal's year 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team has reached the
halfway point in its 1993 season. After five
games, the Cardinal, ranked in the top 20 of
most polls before the season, has a 2-3
record overall, and a 0-2 mark in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference. Recently, Daily football
beat writer David Schwartz spoke with
Stanford head coach

Bill Walsh about the
first half of the season.
Here are some responses
from that conversation:

Q: How do you assess
the season thus far?
A: We're about on
schedule, unfortunate-

ly. We knew we had to
develop and to teach a lot of skills to some
very young players, some very inexperi
enced players, and we've been very spotty.
We've played very well at times, but then
we've made critical, gross errors that have
botched games.
So we're still in the growing process with
a team that is very young, but (has) a lot of
talent at the freshman and sophomore
level. So if we can continue to improve I
think you'll see some wins before the year's
out, and next year we're hoping to have a
very good team.
Q: What have been your most pleasant sur
prises thus far this season?
A: Well, I think our freshmen. So many of
them have come in and played. It's so tough
to play major college football as a freshman
because you have nothing to grab onto.
You've just left home for the first time, as
you know, and you're in a dorm now and
you're going to class — and now you're
expected to carry the load of representing
Stanford University against Notre Dame or
someone — that's really a lot to ask.
I'm pleased with their progress. They've
done as well as you could ever expect. In
particular, Brian Manning among the
freshmen has been very good. Nick Watts
and Brian Batson have been among the
most impressive (freshmen), and also Mike
Mitchell, who's beginning to play now. So
those are sort of the surprises, but we

expected them to do well.
Q: What's your biggest disappointment?
A: The UCLA game disappointed me
because we sort of botched it. They're a
team we might of had a chance to beat. We
lost that game, and we very well could've—
or should've — won it. Notre Dame, we
should have been much closer. We just gave
them some easy scores, but in the mean
time played pretty decent

throughout the game. So
those are two games I
wish we had back to play
again.

Q: What has been the
most satisfying moment
for you so far this year?
A: Coming back and beat-

ing a nationally-ranked
Colorado team is about all I can take pride
in. We were able to beat this team that was
riding high and had destroyed everyone
they had played — and they came to Stan
ford and we won 41-37.
Q: What about the imbalance in the
offense? Steve Stenstrom is having a great
year passing, but at the same time the run
ning game is having a tough time getting
established.
A: It really has. We ran much better against
Notre Dame than we had against anyone,
so I think it will get better, especially as
Mike Mitchell matures.
Now Stenstrom has had a great year —
everything we could have asked he's doing.
We're really excited about his play. He's
carrying this football team right now.
We're hoping our running game will get
stronger and naturally our defense (as
well).
Q: The defense is obvoiusly young and hav
ing some problems. What do you think the
prospects are for improvement?
A: They have gotten better each game, but
there's that critical mistake, I guess you'd
call it, that occurs about one out of every
four plays. Unfortunately it's on third
down every time, so we stop them for two
and they make a third down. So if we can

reduce that error and develop a
little more confidence and
assertiveness, our defense will
improve every week.
Q: What do you think Stanford's
outlook is for the rest of the sea
son in the Pac-10 race?
A: We play a number of Pac-10
games now, and I think it's just up
to us to play as well as we can in
each one of them. If we can win
more than our share, there's
always the possibility that we could
be a bowl team before it's over.
But we have USC lurking out
there, and of course the Oregon
schools and Berkeley who is rid
ing high right now and the Ari
zona schools. I've told our team
we have a chance to win every one
of these. It's just up to us to
improve.
Q: Have you changed what you've
thought of the team in terms of
the beginning of the season? Have
you re-evaluated your goals for
the team?
A: You tend to do that, especially if
you start to lose a few games. You
tend to revise veiy quickly. This is
what I sort of anticipated, but I
was wishfully thinking that maybe
we'd do a little better than this by
now. Had we beaten UCI.A, then I
think we'd be on schedule.

Q: What do you think Stanford's
outlook is for the rest of the sea
son in the Pac-10 race?
A: We play a number of Pac-10
games now, and I think it's just up
to us to play as well as we can in
each one of them. If we can win
more than our share, there's
always the possibility that we could
be a bowl team before it's over.
But we have USC lurking out
there, and of course the Oregon
schools and Berkeley who is rid
ing high right now and the Ari
zona schools. I've told our team
we have a chance to win every one
of these. It's just up to us to
improve.
Q: Have you changed what you've
thought of the team in terms of
the beginning of the season? Have
you re-evaluated your goals for
the team?
A: You tend to do that, especially if
you start to lose a few games. You
tend to revise veiy quickly. This is
what I sort of anticipated, but I
was wishfully thinking that maybe
we'd do a little better than this by
now. Had we beaten UCI.A, then I
think we'd be on schedule.
The Stanford football team has reached the
halfway point in its 1993 season. After five
games, the Cardinal, ranked in the top 20 of
most polls before the season, has a 2-3
record overall, and a 0-2 mark in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference. Recently, Daily football
beat writer David Schwartz spoke with
Stanford head coach

Bill Walsh about the
first half of the season.
Here are some responses
from that conversation:

Q: How do you assess
the season thus far?
A: We're about on
schedule, unfortunate-

ly. We knew we had to
develop and to teach a lot of skills to some
very young players, some very inexperi
enced players, and we've been very spotty.
We've played very well at times, but then
we've made critical, gross errors that have
botched games.
So we're still in the growing process with
a team that is very young, but (has) a lot of
talent at the freshman and sophomore
level. So if we can continue to improve I
think you'll see some wins before the year's
out, and next year we're hoping to have a
very good team.
Q: What have been your most pleasant sur
prises thus far this season?
A: Well, I think our freshmen. So many of
them have come in and played. It's so tough
to play major college football as a freshman
because you have nothing to grab onto.
You've just left home for the first time, as
you know, and you're in a dorm now and
you're going to class — and now you're
expected to carry the load of representing
Stanford University against Notre Dame or
someone — that's really a lot to ask.
I'm pleased with their progress. They've
done as well as you could ever expect. In
particular, Brian Manning among the
freshmen has been very good. Nick Watts
and Brian Batson have been among the
most impressive (freshmen), and also Mike
Mitchell, who's beginning to play now. So
those are sort of the surprises, but we

expected them to do well.
Q: What's your biggest disappointment?
A: The UCLA game disappointed me
because we sort of botched it. They're a
team we might of had a chance to beat. We
lost that game, and we very well could've—
or should've — won it. Notre Dame, we
should have been much closer. We just gave
them some easy scores, but in the mean
time played pretty decent

throughout the game. So
those are two games I
wish we had back to play
again.

Q: What has been the
most satisfying moment
for you so far this year?
A: Coming back and beat-

ing a nationally-ranked
Colorado team is about all I can take pride
in. We were able to beat this team that was
riding high and had destroyed everyone
they had played — and they came to Stan
ford and we won 41-37.
Q: What about the imbalance in the
offense? Steve Stenstrom is having a great
year passing, but at the same time the run
ning game is having a tough time getting
established.
A: It really has. We ran much better against
Notre Dame than we had against anyone,
so I think it will get better, especially as
Mike Mitchell matures.
Now Stenstrom has had a great year —
everything we could have asked he's doing.
We're really excited about his play. He's
carrying this football team right now.
We're hoping our running game will get
stronger and naturally our defense (as
well).
Q: The defense is obvoiusly young and hav
ing some problems. What do you think the
prospects are for improvement?
A: They have gotten better each game, but
there's that critical mistake, I guess you'd
call it, that occurs about one out of every
four plays. Unfortunately it's on third
down every time, so we stop them for two
and they make a third down. So if we can

reduce that error and develop a
little more confidence and
assertiveness, our defense will
improve every week.
