# Water polo team faces tough road
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
For the Stanford water polo team, there is no
time to rest and eryoy their No. 1 national rank
ing.
After beating California Saturday at Berke
ley, the Cardinal (8-1 overall, 2-0 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) will venture
across the Bay again this weekend.
Stanford will compete in the 16-team North
ern California Tournament, held Friday
through Sunday at the Golden Bears' Spieker
Aquatic Complex.
The tournament is one of three which fea
tures the nation's top collegiate teams. The oth
ers are the Southern California Tournament,
which Stanford won last month, and the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament in
Long Beach, Calif., to be held next month.
"All three (tournaments) have the top ten
teams in the nation," said coach Dante Dettaman
ti. "The MPSF is the top conference in the coun
try and the teams are in all of these tournaments."
As well as conference rivals and top-five
squads Cal, UCLA and USC, the field will also
include three out-of-state teams: 12th-ranked
Princeton, 14th-ranked Air Force and 16th
ranked Brown.
Dettamanti looks to this tournament as a
good preparation for the NCAA Tournament,
which will take place Nov. 26-28.
"All three of the big tournaments are
tougher than the NCAAs," Dettamanti said.
"At NCAAs, only the top five teams are there
(in the eight-team field). These are the hardest
(competitions) in the country for collegiate
water polo.
"Also, this weekend we will play six games in
three days. We aren't preparing for just one or
two teams, we have to be ready for six."
Because the Cardinal will be playing so many
matches, Dettamanti is wary of an upset.
"These are the kinds of tournaments at
which upsets can occur," Dettamanti said.
"Over six games, we're bound to have one or
two in which we're not playing at a high level. If
we run into another team that is playing at its
peak, we could be in trouble. We want to guard
against that."
The Cardinal managed to return home victo
rious from the Southern California Tourna
ment last month after posting a 5-1 record.
Their lone loss of the season came at the hands
of USC. Stanford later avenged that loss in the
tournament final, and with that victory, the
Cardinal established itself as the top team in
the country, a position which they have held
ever since.
Stanford will need to win this weekend's
tournament to remain atop the national poll.
"Our goal is to keep our No. 1 ranking,"
senior Larry Bercutt said. "To do that, we'll
have to win this thing. We want to dominate,
especially against UCLA, USC and Cal."
As the tournament's top seed, the Cardinal
received a first-round bye, but will play the
Olympic Club of San Francisco in an unofficial
match Friday morning. The Olympic Club is
comprised of former collegiate players, many of
whom are current U.S. National Team members.
Stanford will then match up against either Pep
perdine or UC-Davis in the second round of play.
The Cardinal is led in scoring by junior Wolf
Wigo (19 goals), senior Chris Wallin (18 goals),
sophomore Jeremy Laster (15 goals) and senior
Antonio Busquets (14 goals). Senior goaltender
Bercutt has recorded 68 saves for the Cardinal
on defense.
