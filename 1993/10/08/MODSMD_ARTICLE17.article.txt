# Greek week two: wanna be starting something
## 
### 
Ybu will have to excuse me. Not
wishing to steal headlines from
the mfyor league baseball playoffs
or Michael Jordan's retirement, I
endured a disquieting 4-6 debut in this
space last week.
With traditional Greek humility, I
admit that my showing was subpar;
however, the word "guru" was not my
idea. I don't write the headlines around
here — any more, at least.
That said, we still have a battle on
our hands, as Athletics Director Ted
Leland could not put much distance
between the guest and yours truly with
a listless 5-5 showing of his own.
Alas, even when Greeks get the
proverbial souvlaki kicked out of them,
they must return the very next week.
No byes, no quirks in the schedule.
Along for the bumpy ride this time is
our "Bad" Dean of Students, Michael
Jackson, a perennial Guest Greek

l 'Thriller" who took a few minutes
from his jam-packed campus-wide tour
to try his "Dangerous" hand at eight
pigskin spreads.
So it is with youthful vigor, lines
from Wednesday's Chronicle and
HOME TEAMS listed in caps, that we
resume our merry journey.
Washington -3-1/2 vs. CAL
Andy: Washington -3-1/2. OK, Golden
Bears, the party is over. Now you get a
real opponent. A real angry opponent.

Good luck, and try not to drag any of
the Huskies' confetti into the losers'
locker room with you.
Michael: Washington -3-1/2. Jackson
cited how seasoned the Huskies were
relative to Cal's Cubs. Serve it up,
Mike. Would you like Dave Barr shaken
or stirred?
Use — 1 vs. OREGON
Andy: USC —1. Last week, Arizona
looked the Trojan horse in the mouth
and performed a vicious root canal.

This week, the lame Ducks will foot the
bill.
Michael: USC —1. "The Trojans are
desperate for a win," Jackson said.
Well, no wonder. How long has it been,
a few thousand years?
Arizona State Pick 'em vs. WASH
INGTON STATE
Andy: Washington State. Pullman is
not the most hospitable of environs,
but the two major reasons I like the
Cougars go something like Washington
State 51, Oregon State 6 and Oregon
State 30, Arizona State 14. Yeah, some
thing like that.
Michael: Arizona State. The Cougs'
inexperience during this period of post-
Bledsoe recovery bothered Jackson. I
think the Sun Devils' taming at the
hands of hapless Oregon State should
