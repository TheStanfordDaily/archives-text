# Greek week two: wanna be starting something
## 
### 
Ybu will have to excuse me. Not
wishing to steal headlines from
the mfyor league baseball playoffs
or Michael Jordan's retirement, I
endured a disquieting 4-6 debut in this
space last week.
With traditional Greek humility, I
admit that my showing was subpar;
however, the word "guru" was not my
idea. I don't write the headlines around
here — any more, at least.
That said, we still have a battle on
our hands, as Athletics Director Ted
Leland could not put much distance
between the guest and yours truly with
a listless 5-5 showing of his own.
Alas, even when Greeks get the
proverbial souvlaki kicked out of them,
they must return the very next week.
No byes, no quirks in the schedule.
Along for the bumpy ride this time is
our "Bad" Dean of Students, Michael
Jackson, a perennial Guest Greek

l 'Thriller" who took a few minutes
from his jam-packed campus-wide tour
to try his "Dangerous" hand at eight
pigskin spreads.
So it is with youthful vigor, lines
from Wednesday's Chronicle and
HOME TEAMS listed in caps, that we
resume our merry journey.
Washington -3-1/2 vs. CAL
Andy: Washington -3-1/2. OK, Golden
Bears, the party is over. Now you get a
real opponent. A real angry opponent.

Good luck, and try not to drag any of
the Huskies' confetti into the losers'
locker room with you.
Michael: Washington -3-1/2. Jackson
cited how seasoned the Huskies were
relative to Cal's Cubs. Serve it up,
Mike. Would you like Dave Barr shaken
or stirred?
Use — 1 vs. OREGON
Andy: USC —1. Last week, Arizona
looked the Trojan horse in the mouth
and performed a vicious root canal.

This week, the lame Ducks will foot the
bill.
Michael: USC —1. "The Trojans are
desperate for a win," Jackson said.
Well, no wonder. How long has it been,
a few thousand years?
Arizona State Pick 'em vs. WASH
INGTON STATE
Andy: Washington State. Pullman is
not the most hospitable of environs,
but the two major reasons I like the
Cougars go something like Washington
State 51, Oregon State 6 and Oregon
State 30, Arizona State 14. Yeah, some
thing like that.
Michael: Arizona State. The Cougs'
inexperience during this period of post-
Bledsoe recovery bothered Jackson. I
think the Sun Devils' taming at the
hands of hapless Oregon State should


Andy Eiser


Michael Jackson
bother him even more.
UCLA -8-1/2 vs. Brigham
Young
Andy: UCLA -8-1/2. Pacific 10
Conference is Pac-10, Western Ath
letic Conference is WAC, and ne'er
the schools shall meet. Sure, BYU
can put up 40 points a game in a
league with no defense, but they
will not fare as well against a Bruin
squad that made me a believer with
its victory over the Cardinal.
Michael: BYU +8-1/2. Jackson also
thought the Bruins would prevail,
but hedged his bet by taking the
Cougars to cover.
FLORIDA STATE -12-1/2 vs.
Miami (Fla.)
Andy: Miami +12-1/2. Hello? Are
the oddsmakers afraid that bring
ing the line any closer will subject
them to xenophobic attack? This
contest will come down to a fantas
tic finish yet again, and the winner
will enjoy a margin not exceeding
one touchdown.
Michael: Miami +12-1/2. "Miami
has motivation to avoid a blowout
after the Alabama game last year,"
Jackson said. While he entertained
a Hurricanes upset as a distinct pos
sibility, Jackson did express his
hope that a Seminoles triumph
could get Burt and Loni back
together.

Michigan -11-1/2 vs. MICHI
GAN STATE
Andy: Michigan -11-1/2. The
Wolverines have looked sharp in
every game except the Notre
Dame debacle, but a porous
defense should not prevent them
from thwarting the Spartans
attack.
Michael: Michigan State +11-1/2.
Jackson also tabbed the Wolverines
to win, but thought the rivalry will
allow the Spartans to close within
the spread. Funny, but that line of
reasoning still hasn't worked for
Cal the last two years.
Oklahoma -11-1/2 vs. Texas (at
Dallas)
Andy: Oklahoma -11-1/2. The
Sooners dismembered Texas A&M,
and the Aggies are still better than
Texas, so this choice was somewhat
academic (like Oklahoma itself).
Michael: Oklahoma -11-1/2. Jack
son also believed that Oklahoma is
O.K. "When they win, they win
big," Jackson said.
BUFFALO -3-1/2 vs. Houston
Andy: Houston +3-1/2. Talk about
needing a win. The Oilers must save
coach Jack Pardee's job Monday
night, so-help-me Bum Phillips.
Michael: Buffalo -3-1/2. "The dis
sension in the Oilers' coaching
ranks has to affect the players,"
Jackson said. Right on, Mike. The
only problem is that a team usually
performs better, not worse, under
these circumstances.
