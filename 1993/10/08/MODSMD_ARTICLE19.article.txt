# Spikers prepare for top-20 foes in weekend tourney

### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Facing off in what head coach Don Shaw called
the "toughest in-season tournament anywhere in
the country this year", the Cardinal will host No. 2
Texas, No. 10 Pacific and No. 11 Colorado this week
end in the Stanford/Bank of America Invitational.
Play begins tonight at 6 p.m. when Stanford (11-
2, 5-2 in the Pacific Ten Conference) meets Texas
(13-1, 4-0 in the Southwest Conference) in a match
which may be a mid-season preview of things yet to
come.
"We'll have a chance to see how good we are right
now against one of the teams we'll probably have to
fight to win the national championship," Shaw said.
After the Stanford-Texas showdown, an 8 p.m.
match pits Pacific (7-4, 3-2 in the Big West Confer
ence) against Colorado (12-2, 2-0 in the Big Eight
Conference). Friday night's losers will play in a con
solation match Saturday night at 6 p.m., followed by
the championship match at 8 p.m.
"We're pretty much going in wanting to win,"
said senior tri-captain Heidi Eick. "Texas is going to
be a difficult team to beat, though — they put up a
really big block."
Stanford's main challenge consists of breaking
through this block — a task much more difficult
than it sounds, considering the height of the Texas
team. The Lady Longhorns average 6 feet 1-1/2
inches and are led by 6-foot-5-inch junior outside
hitter Samy Duarte.
"We're just getting ready for a big team," Shaw
said. "Kim (Oden, assistant coach) and I have been
practicing with them — coming out of retirement —
so they'll be a little better prepared."
The Cardinal, coming off I\iesday night's victory
at California, will be focusing on improving its offen
sive attack. The team hopes to avoid collapsing in

the third game as it did against the Golden Bears as
well as against both Washington State and Wash
ington last weekend.
"We're still at a point in time where we need to
concentrate on doing things on our side of the net,"
Shaw said. "We're going to work on improving our
middle attack and are still looking at combinations
that we feel will work."
Wendy Hromadka, the Cardinal's starting out
side hitter, discussed one of the greatest differences
between last year's offense compared to the Cardi
nal's current system. "Last year, with Bev Oden, we
had a guaranteed kill — now we're working on play
ing good defense and blocking to win rallies."
While the Lady Longhorns may have an advan
tage as far as height, Stanford's front line remains a
formidable challenge for any opponent. Sophomore
hitter/setter Cary Wendell leads the Cardinal with
180 attacks for a 3.8 kill average and a .249 hitting
percentage. She tallied 11 kills against Cal and came
out with 22 sets for 150 assists on the season.
Wendell's classmates Hromadka and Marnie
Triefenbach join her on the front line. Hromadka
has swung for 138 kills this year (a 3.1 kill average)
and a .200 hitting percentage. A player quickly
asserting her power on the talented Cardinal squad.
Triefenbach is hitting .252 with 175 kills for a 3.7
kill average.
In her consistently strong style, senior setter
Piper Hahn has 528 sets on the season and leads the
team in aces with 18, six of which she pounded in
one match. Starting in the middle, junior Anne
Wicks has also proved a consistent force on the Stan
ford squad, tallying 89 kills in 235 swings. Fresh
man hitters Colleen Miniuk and Nikki Otto will also
likely see their share of action this weekend.
Besides Duarte, the Texas attack is powered by

Cardinal spikers are soaring higher than their recent opponents, such as
Arizona (seen here), a trend they hope to continue at home this weekend.
outside hitter Carrie Busch and
middle blocker Katy Jameyson. The
Lady Longhorns have blazed
through the first half of their sched
ule, stumbling only to the undefeat
ed Kentucky in five games. Stanford
leads the all-time series 10-3.
Recently, Stanford's play has
been marked by a troubling pattern.

Against both Washington State and
California, the Cardinal started
strong but couldn't maintain the
attack, dropping late games before
prevailing against these unranked
teams. Stanford hopes to avoid this
dangerous trend after a week of
intense practices.
"We've really been pushing our
selves hard," Eick said. "We're get
ting tougher with every match
because we have to work for every
point we get — every match we
win."
