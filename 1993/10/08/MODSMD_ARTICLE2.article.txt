# Self-defense class will be offered off campus
## Course canceled due to discrimination charges 
### Elissa Lee 
The popular women's self-defense class
that was canceled last week due to charges
that it violated a federal anti-discrimina
tion statute will be offered off campus to fe
male Stanford students, class organizers
have decided.
Self-Defense for Women, which was for
merly funded by the University under the
auspices of the Program for Feminist Stud
ies, will be held at the University Lutheran
Church this fall until organizers decide
how to ensure its compliance with the Title
IX statute.
The Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective, which taught the class previously,
will both sponsor and teach the off-campus
sessions, according Kris Carpenter, the col
lective's spokesperson.
Students participating in the class will
be asked to make monetary donations to
support the class, Carpenter said, but this

is not mandatory.
The Program for Feminist Studies is un
able to carry the class because the program
is part of the University, which must com
ply with Title IX, part of the Educational
Amendments of 1972.
However, the Feminist Studies program
"totally believes that the self-defense class
is a valuable course, and however it gets out
there is great," said program coordinator
Jeanne Alcouloumre.
Title IX prohibits schools which accept
federal money from discriminating on the
basis of sex, race or religion. In the case of
the self-defense offering, the all-women's
class was charged with discriminating
against men, even though a separate men's
section was offered.
The men's section did not include dis
cussions with women and did not offer
physical training.
Both sections of the class were
canceled after the U.S. Depart
ment of Education's Office for
Civil Rights notified the Universi
ty that the class was in possible
violation of Title IX. The Educa
tion Department had received an
anonymous complaint against the
class in mid-August.
According to Alcouloumre, the
Feminist Studies program is
working with the collective to
redesign the class for winter
quarter so that it complies with
Title DC.
Carpenter said the Women
Defending Ourselves Collective
was unable to reorganize the
course in time for the fall quarter,
but still wished to hold the class
and decided to offer it off-campus,
as they do during the summer.
"Primarily, we believes in

teaching self-defense for women
by women," Carpenter said.
The class will run for seven or
eight weeks, with two out of three
sections meeting once a week
from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. A third
section may meet Saturday morn
ings, according to Carpenter. All
three sections will meet at the
University Lutheran Church, at
the corner of Stanford Avenue
and Bowdoin Street in Palo Alto.
Sign-up sheets will be posted
during the first class, for which a
specific date has not yet been set,
said Carpenter. Students will be
admitted on a "first-come, first
served basis." A lottery will be
held for students who do not get
into the class for a small number
of remaining spots, with priority
given to students who have tried
to sign up for the class before.
The all-women class is going to
remain the same, emphasizing
readings, discussions, assertive
ness training and physical self
defense training, said Carpenter.
