# Self-defense class will be offered off campus
## Course canceled due to discrimination charges 
### Elissa Lee 
The popular women's self-defense class
that was canceled last week due to charges
that it violated a federal anti-discrimina
tion statute will be offered off campus to fe
male Stanford students, class organizers
have decided.
Self-Defense for Women, which was for
merly funded by the University under the
auspices of the Program for Feminist Stud
ies, will be held at the University Lutheran
Church this fall until organizers decide
how to ensure its compliance with the Title
IX statute.
The Women Defending Ourselves Col
lective, which taught the class previously,
will both sponsor and teach the off-campus
sessions, according Kris Carpenter, the col
lective's spokesperson.
Students participating in the class will
be asked to make monetary donations to
support the class, Carpenter said, but this

is not mandatory.
The Program for Feminist Studies is un
able to carry the class because the program
is part of the University, which must com
ply with Title IX, part of the Educational
Amendments of 1972.
However, the Feminist Studies program
"totally believes that the self-defense class
is a valuable course, and however it gets out
there is great," said program coordinator
Jeanne Alcouloumre.
Title IX prohibits schools which accept
federal money from discriminating on the
basis of sex, race or religion. In the case of
the self-defense offering, the all-women's
class was charged with discriminating
against men, even though a separate men's
section was offered.
The men's section did not include dis
cussions with women and did not offer
physical training.
