# POLICY ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT
## 
### 
POLICY
It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain the
University community as a place of work and study for stu
dents, faculty, and staff free of sexual harassment and all
forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation. It is funda
mental to the concepts of academic freedom and equal
opportunity that each member of the University community
be treated with dignity and without regard to any factor
irrelevant to participation in the activities of this communi
ty-
It is further the policy of the University to prevent, correct,
and remedy sexual harassment. All students, faculty, and
staff are subject to this policy. Individuals who violate this
policy are subject to discipline up to and including dis
charge, expulsion, or other appropriate sanction.
Reprisals against an individual who in good faith raises a
concern or makes a charge about behavior that may violate
this policy are against the law and will not be tolerated.
Intentionally false charges, however, are grounds for disci
pline.
Stanford is committed to the principles of free inquiry and
free expression. Vigorous discussion and debate are funda
mental to the University, and this policy is not intended to
stifle freedom of expression nor will it be permitted to do so.
Sexual harassment is not protected expression; it compro
mises the integrity of the University, its tradition of intellec
tual freedom, and the trust placed in its members.
Sexual harassment violates State and federal law as well as
University policy. Written information on sexual harass
ment is available at the Office of the Sexual Harassment
Coordinating Adviser Copies of the University policy on
Sexual Assault, which complements this Sexual
Harassment policy, as well as all other documents men
tioned below, are also available at Coordinating Adviser's
office.
WHAT IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
Sexual harassment consists of unwanted sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal, or phys
ical conduct of a sexual nature when:
1. It is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission to
or rejection of the conduct will be a factor in academic or
employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to par
ticipate in a University activity;
or
2. The conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with
an individual's academic or work performance by creating a
hostile and unacceptable educational, work, or student liv
ing environment.
The determination of what constitutes sexual harassment
depends upon the specific facts and the context in which the
conduct occurs. Sexual harassment may take many forms. It
may be subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. It may be
conduct affecting an individual of the opposite sex or con
duct affecting an individual of the same sex. It may occur
between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical rela
tionship. The key question is always whether the conduct is
unwelcome to the individual to whom it is directed, regard
less of the intentions of the actor. Sexual harassment
includes sexual advances that are repeated and unwanted,
even where they are exclusively verbal and not coercive.
Coercive behavior, including suggestions that academic or
employment reprisals or rewards will follow the refusal or
granting of sexual favors, constitutes gross misconduct and
will not be tolerated: A single incident could be grounds for
discharge or expulsion.
CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS
Those who supervise or evaluate the work of others, both in
academic and employment settings, must base their deci
sions on the merits, and must deserve the trust of persons
affected by these decisions. To be effective, they must be
perceived to make their decisions fairly and without
favoritism. There are special risks in any sexual or romantic
relationship between individuals in inherently unequal posi
tions (such as teacher and student, supervisor and employ
ee, or student resident and the individual who supervises
the day to day student living environment). Such relation
ships may undermine the real or perceived integrity of the
supervision and evaluation provided, and the trust inherent
particularly in the student-faculty relationship. They may,
moreover, be less consensual than the individual whose
position confers power believes. The relationship is likely to
be perceived in different ways by each of the parties to it,
especially in retrospect.
The University has no formal policy prohibiting consensual
romantic or sexual relationships among faculty, staff or stu
dents. But relationships in which one party is in a position
to review the work or influence the career of the other may
provide grounds for complaint when that relationship gives
undue access or advantage, restricts opportunities, or creates
a hostile and unacceptable environment for others.
Furthermore, circumstances may change, and conduct that

was previously welcome may become unwelcome. Even
when both parties have consented at the outset to a roman
tic involvement, this past consent does not remove grounds
for a charge based upon subsequent unwelcome conduct.
GLOSSARY
In addition to "sexual harassment." which has already been
defined, the terms "concern," "charge," "complainant,"
"informal resolution," and "grievance" are used in a some
what technical way in the discussion below. They are used
in this policy in the following sense:
A concern is a question or problem involving sexual harass
ment or similar conduct that an individual wants to discuss
without (yet) having made the decision to pursue the matter
further. The reason for distinguishing between concerns and
complaints is that members of the University community
should be able to get advice about behavior that may consti
tute sexual harassment even if they are not certain that it vio
lates this policy, or that they want to take action.
A charge is an assertion that a named individual has violat
ed this policy. A charge may be resolved using informal or
formal resolution procedures.
A complainant is an individual making a charge; the com
plainant must consent to being identified to the person being
charged.
Informal resolution of a concern or a charge means an out
come achieved by advising, mediation, or other informal
process, rather than through one of the University's griev
ance or disciplinary procedures.
Grievances are proceedings under one of the University's
established grievance procedures; these are listed below, and
copies are available from the Coordinating Adviser. The
applicable process depends on the status of the complainant,
but in general, a grievance serves to rectify actions that
directly and adversely affect the complainant in his or her
academic, professional or employment capacity with the
University.
PROCEDURES AND IMPLEMENTATION
SUMMARY: WHAT TO DO ABOUT SEXUAL HARASS
MENT
There are many resources for people who may have been
sexually harassed. Deans, department chairs, and super
visors are all available to hear concerns from or about
individuals within their program areas. The Coordinating
Advise, is an expert trained to respond to sexual harass
ment, and is responsible for overseeing the implementa
tion of this policy. The duties of the Coordinating Adviser
include providing information, personally or through the
Advisers, about the full range of possible ways to pro
ceed.
Any of these individuals may be consulted on a confidential
basis; no records will be kept, and no steps will be taken that
identify the person requesting advice â€” unless and until
that person states in writing that the University may take
such steps. Please note, however, that while this provision
governs the process so far as it is within Stanford's control,
there are certain obligations that may require disclosure
despite University policy. Under subpoena, or in connection
with the applications by others for security clearances or
professional licenses (for teaching, or practicing law or med
icine, for instance) Stanford personnel can be required to
divulge information known to them, even though it was
acquired in confidence. When it is important to reduce or
eliminate even this risk of disclosure, concerned individuals
may wish to avoid giving any names in the initial stages.
Additional information and suggestions about confidential
ity can be obtained from the Coordinating Adviser.
Regardless of whether an individual is following an infor
mal procedure or a formal grievance, a request that it be
reviewed by someone other than his or her immediate
supervisor will always be honored.
CONCERNS AND CHARGES
Students, faculty, and staff members should feel free to dis
cuss any concerns, even when they do not amount to
charges, with the Sexual Harassment Advisers ("Advisers")
or other University officers. The decision to pursue a con
cern as a charge is always one for the individual who
believes that she or he has experienced sexual harassment,
although there may be situations in which the University
must act even in the absence of a formal charge. For exam
ple, when other students or employees may be at risk, the
University may investigate and take action on the basis of
facts it discovers, but without naming the original source of
information.
Any University official receiving a charge of sexual harass
ment must ensure that the charge is investigated promptly
and fully and that effective steps are taken to eliminate
harassment where it exists, even when it is too late for a for
mal grievance to be brought.
A charge may be handled informally or, where applicable,

through a formal grievance process. While a request for
informal resolution may be made at any time, the more
promptly the charge is made, and the more information the
complainant can provide, the more likely it is that a full
investigation can be conducted effectively.
INFORMAL RESOLUTION PROCEDURES
For all parties concerned, informal resolution of charges is
generally the preferable course.
There are several ways in which charges may be handled
informally. These include:
Advice: Some people may prefer to try to deal with the sit
uation themselves, at least in the first instance, and may sim
ply want advice about how best to proceed.
Moderated discussion: The complainant may wish to dis
cuss the matter with the other party in the presence of that
person's department chair, dean or supervisor, or an
Adviser, or both.
Mediation: Where both parties are willing, a more struc
tured mediation may be arranged.
Investigation followed by supervisory action: If significant
facts are contested, the department chair, dean, or supervisor
of the person accused may undertake an investigation, in
consultation with a member of the Sexual Harassment Panel.
Although informal, the investigation will be carried out in a
way that respects the rights of the person being charged and
the privacy of all those involved, including the complainant.
The results of such an investigation will be available for use
in the event of a subsequent grievance or disciplinary action.
Possible outcomes of informal processes include explicit
agreements about future conduct, changes in workplace
assignments, substitution of one class for another, or any
other appropriate relief.
GRIEVANCES
As an alternative to informal procedures, or when informal
resolution efforts fail, the complainant may be able to file a
grievance. At Stanford, grievance procedures are generally
designed to provide a remedy when an individual is
adversely affected in his or her University capacity. The
applicable procedure depends on the grievant's status as a
student, faculty member, or member of the various staff cat
egories. Generally, the process consists of the grievant's sub
mission of a written statement, an investigation by a
University officer, followed by a decision and, in some cases,
the possibility of one or more appeals, usually to adminis
trative officers at higher levels. The relevant procedure
should be read carefully, since they vary considerably â€” for
example, the Bargaining Unit grievance procedures provide
for binding arbitration. Note that if the identified grievance
officer has a conflict of interest, an alternate will be arranged;
the Coordinating Adviser can help make sure this occurs. In
most cases, grievances must be brought within a specified
time after the action complained of. While informal resolu
tion efforts will not automatically extend the time limits for
filing a grievance, in appropriate circumstances the com
plainant and the University may mutually agree in writing
to extend the time for filing a grievance.
These are the established grievance procedures; copies may
be obtained from the Office of the Coordinating Adviser:
Nonacademic Staff Grievance Procedure (see Guide
Memo 22.10) * Collective Bargaining Agreements for unit
members * Academic Staff Grievance Procedure (see
Research Policy Handbook) * Faculty Grievance procedure
(see Guide Memo 21.4) * Student Academic Grievance
Procedure (see Stanford University Bulletin, Information
and Regulations Governing Student Conduct and
Procedures for Their Enforcement) * Student Employee
Grievance Procedure (see Guide Memo 24) * Student
Nonacademic Grievance Procedure pursuant to Title IX (for
additional information, consult the Director of the Office for
Multicultural Development, who serves as the University's
Title IX Officer).
Student conduct is governed by the Fundamental Standard.
(See Student Conduct Policies Handbook.)
DISCIPLINE
Independent of any remedy for the individual complainant,
the University may determine that disciplinary action
should be taken against the person being charged. The deci
sion to initiate disciplinary action is in the discretion of the
President or his or her designee (for faculty and students) or
the administrative supervisor (for staff employees). The
complainant and the Coordinating Adviser will be informed
of any disciplinary action that is imposed.
RESOURCES FOR DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASS
MENT
OVERVIEW
Enforcement of this policy is the responsibility of the senior
University officers â€” deans, vice presidents, and their dele
gates â€” responsible for faculty, staff, and student affairs; the
Sexual Harassment Coordinating Adviser is responsible for
coordinating its implementation. Anyone who believes he
or she may have been sexually harassed, or who has other
individual concerns about sexual harassment in the
University, is encouraged to discuss the matter with any
University officer and obtain guidance and advice about
available procedures. Informal, local resolution of a concern
or charge is preferable whenever feasible. There are, how
ever, a number of individuals specially trained, and charged
with specific responsibilities, in the area of sexual harass
ment. In brief:
* Sexual Harassment Advisers act as resources to individu
als who have concerns or charges about sexual harassment.
All Advisers are trained, and the group normally includes at
least one faculty member with expertise in the field.
* The Sexual Harassment Panel acts as an optional resource
to school or administrative officers responsible to investigate
charges and remedy situations where sexual harassment is
found. The Panel is also a resource to University grievance
officers hearing grievances involving sexual harassment.
* The Coordinating Adviser provides advice to individuals,
supervises the other Advisers, acts as an informational
resource to the Panel, encourages and assists prevention
education in the University community, and keeps records
showing the disposition of charges, and generally coordi
nates matters arising under this policy.
* Each School and administrative unit may also designate
an individual or group of individuals to respond to concerns
or charges.
COORDINATING ADVISER
The Coordinating Adviser, as noted above, is responsible for
coordinating the implementation of the Sexual Harassment
Policy. Because education and awareness are the best ways
to prevent sexual harassment, these are among the most
important functions of the Coordinating Adviser:
* Developing awareness, education, and training programs
* Publishing and disseminating an informational pamphlet
containing this policy and providing guidance for those
affected by sexual harassment * Distributing this policy
statement to all students, faculty and staff at the time of their
joining the University and annually thereafter * Distributing
and posting relevant material and making any reports

required by state or federal law.
The duties of the Coordinating Adviser also include (1) act
ing as one of the Sexual Harassment Advisers; (2) supervis
ing the day-to-day advising duties of the other Advisers; (3)
acting as a resource to the Sexual Harassment Panel; (4) pro
viding information to other University officers about sexual
harassment; (5) being aware of, and encouraging and facili
tating the use of, prevention education resources specific to
sexual harassment; (6) coordinating training for new
Advisers and Panel members; (7) maintaining records of
every charge, including the names of the complainant and
person being charged and the disposition of the charge; (8)
transmitting to the President annually a report of the num
ber of charges made to the Advisers and other University
officers, and their status; (9) taking other action necessary to
implement this policy.
The Coordinating Adviser reports to the Provost.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ADVISERS
Advisers are appointed by the Provost. Sexual Harassment
Advisors may include faculty, students and staff. Although
training will be provided to all new Advisers, whenever
possible, the Advisers shall include at least one faculty mem
ber with expertise in the field.
Advisers are responsible to discuss any concerns or charges
with students, faculty, or staff members, to provide copies of
this policy, and to explain the internal options. If requested,
an adviser may assist an individual in making a police
report. Advisers do not keep permanent records or files
reflecting their discussions. Even if an individual does not
wish to make a charge and no further action is taken by the
University, the Adviser may be able to give useful advice. If
an individual decides to makes a charge, however, the facts
of the charge and the identity of the parties involved will be
recorded, and the Adviser will consult with the Coordinator
of the before taking any specific action to resolve the matter
informally.
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PANEL
The members of the Panel are appointed by the President.
The Panel may include faculty, students and staff. On
request of the cognizant University official, the Panel (or one
or more of its members, as determined by its Chair) will
advise and assist administrative officers in investigating or

considering action based upon a charge of sexual harass
ment. In any formal grievance procedure in which sexual
harassment is asserted, the University grievance officer will
consult the Panel, which will provide guidance and advice.
The Panel will report to the Coordinating Adviser on every
charge in which it is involved.
RESOURCES WITHIN ACADEMIC OR ADMINISTRA
TIVE UNITS
The cognizant University official (deans of Schools and
heads of other administrative units) may handle concerns
and charges themselves or with the help of an advisory indi
vidual or group. The Coordinating Adviser is available to
facilitate training of individuals so designated. Charges
brought to a school or administrative unit (either by the
complainant in the first instance, or because the charge can
not be resolved informally by an Adviser) will be handled as
follows:
1. If the facts are disputed, the charge will be investigated by
the cognizant University official; once the facts are deter
mined, if sexual harassment (or other unfair or inappropri
ate action) is found, the cognizant University official will
attempt to reach a negotiated or mediated resolution;
2. If a negotiated or mediated resolution is not reached, the
cognizant University official will take appropriate action;
3. In either case, the complainant and the Coordinating
Adviser will be advised of the outcome of the investigation
and the action, if any, taken in response to the charge.
Those handling charges brought to schools or administrative
units are strongly encouraged to consult with the Panel (or a
member designated by the Chair of the Panel) concerning
the investigation and remedies. In any event, the disposition
of every charge shall be reported to the Coordinating
Adviser.
POLICY REVIEW AND EVALUATION
This policy goes into effect on October 6, 1993. After it has
been in effect for two years, the Provost will establish a com
mittee that includes faculty, staff and students to evaluate it
and make recommendations for its improvement.
