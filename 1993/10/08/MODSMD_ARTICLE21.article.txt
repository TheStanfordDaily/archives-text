# Men's soccer to aim high vs. Air Force
## Cardinal team hopes to upset 7-1-1 Falcons, earn postseason slot 
### Reagan Demas 
The Air Force Academy tells
recruits to 'Aim High,' but it will be
the 2-6-1 Stanford men's soccer
squad that will shoot for a distant
star when they try to beat the 7-1-
1 Falcons on FViday.
Air Force, who has outscored its
foes 37-9 and outshot them 218-83,
boasts four players who have
scored six or more goals and tallied
10 or more points. They have shut
out four of their nine opponents
and, although the competition has

been less than stellar, the Falcons
have completely controlled all but
two of their games.
"They're certainly impressive as
far as their scoring output," said
Stanford coach Colin Lindores.
"An inexperienced team that can't
hold possession will very easily lose
to them."
Fortunately Lindores doesn't
think his team fits that description.
Certainly they did not last year,
when the Cardinal beat Air Force 2-
1 on the Falcons' home turf. And
that's a tough place to win.

"They've played a lot of home
games this season, and that's a real
psychological and physical advan
tage," Lindores said of Air Force's
Colorado home, over 5,000 feet
above sea level. "The altitude real
ly makes a difference, but a lot of it
is psychological."
This game is on Stanford's
home turf, however, where the
Cardinal played a much-improved
game last weekend against UC-
Irvine. But the Falcons are not the
Anteaters, and it is tough for Stan
ford to admit that they are playing

an extremely strong team in a
game they must win.
"We're going to approach this
game differently because it's our
first in the conference," said mid
fielder Ryan Collins. "If we don't
start winning in the conference our
season is over."
A harsh statement, but if the
Cardinal want to play in the post
season it is certainly a fitting one.
"If this team has any real thought
of the playoffs, we need to win,"
Lindores said. "The odds would
probably say no, but then again,
who knows?"
Most of the Stanford players
know one thing: they can not
approach this game with despera
tion. "We're loose," said Cardinal
forward and leading scorer Rick
Goad. "We know we have to win,
and it does us no good to see how
good they are or who they've beat
en."
The beginning of the conference
season marks the final chance for
the Cardinal to make the postsea
son cut. The top two teams in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion will move on to the playoffs,
and Lindores sees three strong
teams emerging: Fresno, Universi
ty of Washington and Air Force.
"(Air Force) is getting (to the
point) of their season where we'll
find out if they're a playoff con
tender or not," Lindores said.
"They play a high-pressure, deter
mined game, typical of the service
teams. They won't give up."
That means the Cardinal must
play flawless soccer in order to
escape with a win. "This team has
given us glimpses of a potentially
good squad," Lindores said. "What
we need to do is extend those peri
ods, and I don't know if we can do
that this year."
If he had it his way Lindores
would come out of this weekend
with a win or tie against the Fal
cons and a win against Sacramento
State, whom Stanford will face
Sunday. Mental preparation is the
key to the Cardinal's play, and Lin
dores is concerned about his team's
psyche.
"The college soccer player is
such an up-and-down psychologi
cal being," Lindores said. "You
never know which one is going to
show up."
