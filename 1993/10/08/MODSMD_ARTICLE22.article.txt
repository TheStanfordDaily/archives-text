# Booters to play Trojans, Aztecs

If the Stanford women's
soccer team was ever to have a
no-nonsense tournament, this
would be the weekend to
choose.
The Cardinal (9-1) cannot
afford to relax as it travels to
the sunny confines of San
Diego State University and the
San Diego Invitational Tour
nament. Stanford faces South
ern Cal (2-7-1), a newcomer to
varsity women's soccer, Satur
day at noon and then tangles
with a pesky San Diego St.
squad (5-4-1) Sunday.
"San Diego St. always gives
us a headache," said coach lan
Sawyers. "They fight for the
ball and defend very hard. I
don't know much about USC
because they are a first-year
team, but I know they won't
sit down and roll over and let
us win."
The Aztecs bring a young,
aggressive team to the field.
Top scorer Shawn Viloria, with
seven goals and one assist,
ranks 12th in the Western
region in scoring. Other key
players include defenders Kim
Komara and Theresa Miranda,
who draw the unfortunate
duty of checking the Cardinal
scoring duo of Sarah Rafanelli
and Erin Martin.
Stanford will not only face a

tough defensive wall from the
Aztecs, but one of the top
young goalkeepers in the coun
try. Freshman Tina Thompson
boasts a .90 goals-against aver
age, allowing only six goals in
600 minutes of minding the
net this year.
However, San Diego St.
coach Leslie Gallimore still
remains concerned about the
Cardinal's lethal scoring
potential.
"Sarah Rafanelli will get a
goal a game, no matter what
you do," said Gallimore. "You
just have to give her respect
for her incredible ability.
We've been holding our own
defensively, but Rafanelli and
Martin are in a different
league."
Stanford appears to have
shaken the stigma of being a
slow-starting team. After
falling behind early last Friday
to Notre Dame, the Cardinal
fought back with intense
offensive pressure to score
three unanswered goals. Then,
on Sunday, Stanford ran their
season record to 9-1 by putting
away a skilled Texas Christian
University team 4-0.
"Last weekend and this
weekend is a real turning point
for the season," said Rafanelli.
"We proved that we could
come from behind and we are
really coming together as a
team."
