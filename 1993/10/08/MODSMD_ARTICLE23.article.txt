## Diary of a five-foot fear inducer 
### 
I am scary.
My presence breeds fear.
This is what I have been told and I sup
pose it does explain why people never dare
to take my laundry out of the dryer — even
when I've left it there for two weeks.
It also might explain why section leaders
pee in their pants when I raise my hand in
class. Why all it took was a quick chat with
one of those starch-collared administrators
to get me out of Freshman English.
And my high school didn't even have AP.
No shit.
In the past two years not one of my neigh
bors has ever complained about the thun
derous and sometimes curious sex emanat
ing from my room — which surely keeps
them up morning, noon and night.
As if I were Jason or Freddy or a 20-pager
due in the morning, people cower when I
come.
And I honestly don't know why.
What makes me so feared, so loathed, so
intimidating that even my own mother
won't tell me when I've put my shirt on
backwards?
Surely it's not my awesome physical
stature. My 5-foot, 114-pound frame is the
classic example of how man's technological
advances have served to sustain, if not prop
agate, bad genes and unattractive attributes
like freckles and stubby legs. I'm just not
"American Gladiators" material.
Hell, I drive better when sitting on a
phone book, I have to jump to see into my
post office box, I've been carded recently at
a PG-13 movie, and I still wear clothes from
Gap Kids.
One would think I'd be ripe for squashing
or teasing or picking on. On paper, I'm every
bully's wet dream — perfect fodder for
sorority girls' self-esteem sessions.
Not even close.
And it's not that I'm a womyn. I mean,
I'm for equality and sexual harassment poli
cies and support groups. But I'm not out
there with a megaphone burning the tiny

bras I don't really need, if you catch my
drift. Remember, five feet flat.
Maybe it's my boat. That is, my car. It's a
classic road-hogging, gas-guzzling, get-out
of-my-way-bitch, made-by-the-fathers-of
the-kids-I-went-to-high-school-with, 1985
Oldsmobile "Custom Cruiser" Station
Wagon. With wood paneling. It's long and
it's loud. Beneath its wheels, the Honda
Accords and Mitsubishi Eclipses of the
wanna-be-yuppies become easy road kill.
Even with the phone book.

Maybe it's my face. I've been told that I
have a naturally dour expression, so sour
that it looks like my mother fed me lemons
until the age of 10. Or like I'm constantly
constipated. Which I'm not.
More than a couple times a stranger off
the street has muttered, "Smile for a
change." Salespeople rarely think the com
mission is worth approaching me. Even beg
gars shy away when I walk past.
I used to be concerned about this. I con
sidered it a problem. Not quite a support
group-at-the-Bridge kind of problem, but I
did begin to wonder when people would clear
a path for me on the post office line.
Because in general, I consider myself a
nice person. Peace, love, compost, the whole
nine yards. I'm for it. I even think I'm still
in my parents' wills.
But I want to be more than tolerated. I
want to be loved, if you will.

Me and my "significant other" (who once
or twice has even disagreed with me and
survived unemasculated) could use a com
patible couple to do that double-date thing
with. I do have friends — unless they're all
just people living in fear of the repercus
sions if they stop talking to me — but we can
all use a new wardrobe to borrow from every
once in a while.
Or so I thought.
After two years of trying to rectify this,
practicing the patented Miss-Cuyahoga-
County-Fair-distort-your-lips-like-Silly-
Putty smile and the mannequin wave, ask
ing people to "tell me how you really feel"
and feigning interest in how the guy who sat
next to me all last quarter in my stats sec
tion spent his summer break, I have had
enough.
My cheeks are sore (from smiling).
No more, I say! The charade is off! It just
ain't worth it.
I yam what I yam and that's all that I
yam. Intimidating as hell, like it or lump it,
you pansy-assed, touchy-feely types.
Those who are tough enough to brave my
thin-but-abrasive layer can get to the gold
and reap the rewards. Those who can't, the
loss is yours. It's a dog-eat-dog world, all
you mama's boys. Sink or swim, doofus.
I'm going to nurture, not eradicate, my
little disposition.
The power to intimidate is a gift. God
gave me few . . . might as well use this one.
I'll have to check with the CPPC gods
before I list "Being a bitch" at the top of my
resume under Skills and Work Experience,
but I've got a hunch that my innate ability
to command attention, get others to do my
will, and scare all you off might reap a pret
ty price in the global marketplace.
Out of my way, schmuck. I've got six fig
ures coming my way.
