# Put that on a shot glass:
## A 						look at Stanford logo no-no's

Ponderous. Phallic. Coniferous.
So has the tall pine stood for
years, proud symbol of Stanford
University.
Jutting toward the sky, its
few spindly branches sticking
out at odd angles, the tree logo
has graced gaggles of coasters
and caps, shot glasses and poorly
made, overpriced Bookstore
notebooks.
Generations of Stanford stu
dents have worn the tree on
their chests, proudly proclaim
ing "I spent time in a temperate
zone."

The Stanford Stick Figure

But, as noble as the lone pine
seems, it has one drawback: It
doesn't sell. Whether it's too
high-concept or just not cute
enough, the pine tree, along with
Stanford's other officially
licensed logos — a trotter horse,
the block letter "S" and school
seal — just doesn't have legs in
the university merchandising
market.
So, in an attempt to let those
Lufts of Freiheit keep wehtin'
along (or at least keep the green
rollin' in), the Office of Technol
ogy Licensing set up a contest
this past summer to find new,
more profitable logos for the
school.

They even offered a prize:
$500 per accepted logo. Since a
good logo would pull in several
heavy bills, you can do the math
and see the sacrifice they were
making. I think you get the
point.
The good news is the office
received over five dozen entries.
The bad news is that they judged
all the entries — every one of
them — unacceptable.
How bad were the new logo
ideas? We decided to let you be
the judge. And so, we present the
following handful of Stanford
logos that never made it past the
drawing board.
Timber.

The Tower of Power

Donnie's Famous Yacht Club


Cute, lovable, androgynous,
but lacking in mass appeal.


It you can rtad thia and you think you ra funniar thin anything
on this paga call Michaal at 725-2100. and wnta lor Divaraioni

Graceful in flight, but horrifyingly realistic.


He can steal your Schwinn, but, dammit,
he just doesn't steal your heart.

You can almost taste the salty air, but you can't escape the
air of impropriety.


Friendly and phallic, but alienates the older generation.
