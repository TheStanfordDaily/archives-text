# Russia facing painful path to democracy
## Former Gorbachev aide questions fairness of upcoming elections 
### Cametra Thompson 
Russia will not likely see presi
dential elections in the next few
years, Pavel Palazhchenko, advis
er to former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, predicted
yesterday to a gathering of 35 stu
dents, faculty and staff in Encina
Hall.
"Assume that what is happen
ing in Russia now is part of the
transition to democracy," began
Palazhchenko.
An easy transition from a basi
cally Stalinist society to a free and
open one would be a miracle, and
"the miracle didn't happen. The
transition will be a long and
painful one," he said.
Not only does Palazhchenko
doubt the likelihood of imminent
presidential elections, but he
questions the fairness and merit
of the upcoming parliamentary
elections in December. He joined
the 35 percent of Russian citizens
who chose not to vote in the pres
idential referendum earlier this
year.
Explaining his decision not to
vote, Palazhchenko said choosing
to vote involves accepting the fact
that the elections will be "less
than ideal" administratively. He
also expressed doubt about
whether the leaders people elect
will actually assume office. Nev

ertheless, Palazhchenko says he
will vote in December. "We can't
simply say, 'Let's wait it out,' " he
said.
But does democracy have a
chance in Russia?
That question is still open, said
Palazhchenko, who is optimistic
despite the many obstacles. "The
geography of Russia is not hos
pitable to ideal democracy," he
said, citing its location among
non-democratic societies.
Likewise, the poor state of the
Russian economy poses a problem
for the transition to democracy.
The "shock-therapy approach" of
Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs
that worked well in Poland and
Bolivia is not appropriate for Rus
sia, Palazhchenko said.
He noted that "over 70 percent
of the decline in production in
Russia was because of the rup
ture of economic ties between
Russia and the Soviet Union."
Palazhchenko agreed with
analysts who foresee a reintegra
tion of the independent states
that used to be part of the Soviet
Union; the major question
though, he said, is how.
"The real question is whether
there will be a community of inde
pendent states or a group of
states under Russia," he said.
A serious concern of both Rus
sia and the states is the position

and standing of the military.
Reducing the military is more dif
ficult in Russia than it was in the
Soviet Union because the military
now has to reconfigure itself, he
said.
Yeltsin's recent use of force on
civilians was excessive,
Palazhchenko said, making the
military's restoration process
even more difficult.
Despite all of the obstacles to
democracy, Palazhchenko said he
sees no future other than democ
racy. "Democracy is certainly the
goal — that's not a question. The

question is how we get to it,"he
said.
Palazhchenko served as a
counselor to the former Soviet
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is
currently translating Gor
bachev's memoirs and acting as
special adviser to the Gorbachev
Foundation. He served as the
English language interpreter for
Gorbachev and Eduard Shevard
nadze.
The Palazhchenko lecture was
the first lecture of the year spon
sored by the Center for Russian
and East European Studies.
