# Stanford hits airwaves with fiberoptic network

The expanding realm of cyberspace has
begun to reach deeper into the corridors of
this campus, projecting the faces of Stan
ford scholars onto the nation's airwaves.
With the link-up of a new fiberoptic
broadcasting system two weeks ago, Stan
ford professors and Hoover fellows have
been able to appear on "The
MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour," CNN's "In
side Business" and other major news
broadcasts directly from campus.
Before the new system was installed,
Stanford experts often had to drive to other
locations to appear on the msyor news
broadcasts.
"It's incredible," raved Russia expert
Michael McFaul, who appeared on Mac-
Neil/Lehrer to discuss recent developments
in Moscow. "This was the first time I was
able to appear on a program like that right
from campus."
Jack Hubbard, associate director of
News Service, who has been instrumental
in bringing the new system to campus,
spoke excitedly about its first few weeks of
operation.

"It's working flawlessly," said Hubbard.
He said he believes the convenience of the
new fiberoptic system will make Stanford
scholars more appealing to major television
and radio news programs.
"It's so much easier. IThe networks) lit
erally pick up the phone and ask for some
one and we can have them on in 20 min
utes," Hubbard said. What used to be
"three-hour transactions are now being re
duced to a five to 10-minute walk across
campus."
The studio, which is housed in the Hugh
Hildreth Skilling building, is small — an
estimated 20 feet by 20 feet — but it is
"network quality," Hubbard said.
The cost of this new technology —
$120,000 — will come from Stanford's gen
eral fund. But Hubbard said it will save the
University money in the long run. The sys
tem is operated by VYVX, a transmission
network based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The old campus satellite system was
much less reliable, Hubbard said. Crowded
airwaves and bad weather occasionally in
terfered with reception or shut down the
system entirely.
The new system was initiated
in part by faculty members who
were frustrated with the difficult,
time-consuming process the Uni
versity used in the past.
With the old satellite system,
the number of faculty appearances
on TV averaged about three per
month. In the two weeks the new
system has been running, already
three faculty members — including
health care expert Alain Enthoven
— have had their expert opinions

broadcast on the air.
The new system makes Stan
ford "as accessible as anyone" to
the networks, which Hubbard
said are "biased to the East
Coast" by location.
Dale Vennes, engineer-in
charge at "MacNeil/Lehrer,"
acknowledged the convenience of
this new technology.
"It makes it easier and quicker
to get a signal from California to
New York," Vennes said. "There
are fewer arrangements to be
made. . . . We don't have to buy
satellite time, and it's actually a
little bit cheaper."
Joe Wrinn of Harvard Universi
ty's news service said he looks for

ward to the day when their cam
pus will have a similar system.
"Ideally, I would love to have a
room on campus tied directly to a
link-up," Wrinn said.
The future is now at Stanford,
one of the first universities to use
this technology, according to
Hubbard. The new fiberoptic sys
tem eliminates logistical problems
that arose in getting Stanford
experts to local television studios
to connect with news programs in
New York and Washington.
Hubbard hopes that use of this
new system will continue to
expand on campus to include inter
active television, video conferenc
ing and other educational purposes.
