# 'How did a person so small accomplish these things? It leaves hope for all of us.'
## Tears, smiles at Biehl memorial 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Though some had never even met
her, 1989 graduate Amy Biehl touched
more than 300 people who gathered to
remember her at Memorial Church last
night. The story of her life and untime
ly death prompted tears, smiles and a
sense of renewed determination in
those who listened.
"Amy was not fearless, but she was
brave," said Steve Steadman, who
worked with Biehl in South Africa.
"Bravery is acting in the face of fear
and overcoming fear, and Amy was the
bravest person I've ever known."
After graduating with a bachelor's
degree in international relations, Biehl
won a Fulbright scholarship to re

search women's rights and South
Africa's transition to democracy at the
University of the Western Cape in
South Africa.
She was killed in the black township
of Guguletu on Aug. 25, when a mob of
angry youths mistook her for a white
"settler" and stabbed her to death.
Biehl, 26, was the first American vic
tim of South African township vio
lence.
"When there is a white death in
South Africa, there are stories, and
family," Steadman said, "But when
there is a black death there are only
numbers."
"If anything ever happened, Amy
wanted to be just another nameless vic-

tim," he continued. "But she is
too special for that."
Since friends and family have
had a month to deal with their
loss, the service assumed a
reflective tone as words charged
with political resolve alternated
with lighter day-to-day recollec
tions.
"I really expected her to make
a difference some day," said Katie
Bolich, Biehl's best friend. "I
know now that she has made a dif
ference."
The messages of perseverance
and strength seemed to reach lis
teners as, one by one, the crowd
stood in silent solidarity while
the a cappella group Talisman
sang the unofficial anthem of
South African freedom, "N'Kosi
Sikelele."
Marveling at the impact such
an "ordinary person" had on the
world, Biehl's father, Peter,
asked, "How did a person so small
accomplish these things? It leaves
hope for all of us."
"Amy stands as a very inspira
tional figure," said friend Michael
McFaul, a research associate at
Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies. "She combined her
intellectual and interpersonal
capacities with her moral convic
tions to create an incredibly
daunting combination."
In addition to several scholar
ship programs the Biehl family
has established at Stanford, Biehl
is being honored with a United
Nations Peace Prize, and two Ful

bright scholarships will be award
ed this year in her name, Peter
Biehl said.
The Biehl family leaves today
for South Africa, where they will
visit both a children's shelter and
a law conference dedicated to
Biehl's memory. In addition, the
family will attend services in the
township where Biehl was killed,
her brother Zack said.
Along with Biehl's strong com
mitment to democracy, last
night's service also reflected a
fun-loving spirit that friends said
was "just Amy."
"A whole lot has been made of
what she was doing over there [in
South Africal," Zack Biehl said.
"But that's not the whole pic
ture.
At the service, Bolich shared
details of her friend's personali
ty — from her adventurous taste
in ethnic food to her love of
music.
Besides being remembered as a
democratic reformer and a deeply
sensitive friend, Biehl was hon
ored as a dedicated athlete.
Diving coach Rick Schavone
remembered Biehl learning eight
dives in one day — dives only 50
women in the country could do —
so she would be able to accompany
Bolich to the qualifying meet.
Though Biehl was often visibly
frightened by dangerous dives,
"she didn't let fear rule her life or
keep her from doing anything she
wanted to do," Schavone said.
"Amy would want everyone
here to keep living life to the
fullest," said Linda Biehl, Amy's
mother. "She'd have you all do
what you do 100 percent.... No,
make that 110 percent."

mother. "She'd have you all do
what you do 100 percent.... No,
make that 110 percent."
Though some had never even met
her, 1989 graduate Amy Biehl touched
more than 300 people who gathered to
remember her at Memorial Church last
night. The story of her life and untime
ly death prompted tears, smiles and a
sense of renewed determination in
those who listened.
"Amy was not fearless, but she was
brave," said Steve Steadman, who
worked with Biehl in South Africa.
"Bravery is acting in the face of fear
and overcoming fear, and Amy was the
bravest person I've ever known."
After graduating with a bachelor's
degree in international relations, Biehl
won a Fulbright scholarship to re

search women's rights and South
Africa's transition to democracy at the
University of the Western Cape in
South Africa.
She was killed in the black township
of Guguletu on Aug. 25, when a mob of
angry youths mistook her for a white
"settler" and stabbed her to death.
Biehl, 26, was the first American vic
tim of South African township vio
lence.
"When there is a white death in
South Africa, there are stories, and
family," Steadman said, "But when
there is a black death there are only
numbers."
"If anything ever happened, Amy
wanted to be just another nameless vic-

tim," he continued. "But she is
too special for that."
Since friends and family have
had a month to deal with their
loss, the service assumed a
reflective tone as words charged
with political resolve alternated
with lighter day-to-day recollec
tions.
"I really expected her to make
a difference some day," said Katie
Bolich, Biehl's best friend. "I
know now that she has made a dif
ference."
The messages of perseverance
and strength seemed to reach lis
teners as, one by one, the crowd
stood in silent solidarity while
the a cappella group Talisman
sang the unofficial anthem of
South African freedom, "N'Kosi
Sikelele."
Marveling at the impact such
an "ordinary person" had on the
world, Biehl's father, Peter,
asked, "How did a person so small
accomplish these things? It leaves
hope for all of us."
"Amy stands as a very inspira
tional figure," said friend Michael
McFaul, a research associate at
Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies. "She combined her
intellectual and interpersonal
capacities with her moral convic
tions to create an incredibly
daunting combination."
In addition to several scholar
ship programs the Biehl family
has established at Stanford, Biehl
is being honored with a United
Nations Peace Prize, and two Ful

bright scholarships will be award
ed this year in her name, Peter
Biehl said.
The Biehl family leaves today
for South Africa, where they will
visit both a children's shelter and
a law conference dedicated to
Biehl's memory. In addition, the
family will attend services in the
township where Biehl was killed,
her brother Zack said.
Along with Biehl's strong com
mitment to democracy, last
night's service also reflected a
fun-loving spirit that friends said
was "just Amy."
"A whole lot has been made of
what she was doing over there [in
South Africal," Zack Biehl said.
"But that's not the whole pic
ture.
At the service, Bolich shared
details of her friend's personali
ty — from her adventurous taste
in ethnic food to her love of
music.
Besides being remembered as a
democratic reformer and a deeply
sensitive friend, Biehl was hon
ored as a dedicated athlete.
Diving coach Rick Schavone
remembered Biehl learning eight
dives in one day — dives only 50
women in the country could do —
so she would be able to accompany
Bolich to the qualifying meet.
Though Biehl was often visibly
frightened by dangerous dives,
"she didn't let fear rule her life or
keep her from doing anything she
wanted to do," Schavone said.
"Amy would want everyone
here to keep living life to the
fullest," said Linda Biehl, Amy's
mother. "She'd have you all do
what you do 100 percent.... No,
make that 110 percent."
