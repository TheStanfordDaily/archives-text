# Frosh dorm featured in documentary
## 
### Allison Short 
From the moment they timid
ly set foot onto campus until the
day they hugged their dorm bud
dies goodbye for the summer, the
1990-91 freshmen in Trancos
had a year they would never for
get.
But unlike most students
whose first-year memories are
limited to photo albums and the
occasional reunion, they have it all
on film.
"Frosh," a new documentary
film chronicling the lives of
Trancos residents in their first
year of college, captures every
thing from raucous parties to
late-night hallway philosophy

discussions.
Created by film makers Dayna
Goldfine and Dan Geller, two
Stanford graduates, the 97-
minute film debuts Sunday, Oct.
10 in San Francisco at the Roxie
Theater.
The goal of "Frosh" was to
"capture that journey from leav
ing home for the first time and
being put in an atmosphere with
many new perspectives," Goldfine
said.
"We were looking at what it's
like to be ripped loose from your
friends, family and high school
and being put into a highly
pressured community," Geller
said.
And though some students

might be intimidated by the
prospect of having their freshman
year filmed, the Trancos residents
of three years ago adjusted quickly
to life with the camera.

over the table recording his entire
conversation at his first adviser
dinner. "The camera's just there,
and that's it,"he said.
Selling at $195 per copy,
"Frosh" will be shown at universi
ties nationwide and has already
been used in several orientation
programs. The film is not being
shown at Stanford while the fea
tured students still remain on
