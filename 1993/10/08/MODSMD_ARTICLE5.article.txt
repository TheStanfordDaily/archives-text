# Frosh dorm featured in documentary
## 
### Allison Short 
From the moment they timid
ly set foot onto campus until the
day they hugged their dorm bud
dies goodbye for the summer, the
1990-91 freshmen in Trancos
had a year they would never for
get.
But unlike most students
whose first-year memories are
limited to photo albums and the
occasional reunion, they have it all
on film.
"Frosh," a new documentary
film chronicling the lives of
Trancos residents in their first
year of college, captures every
thing from raucous parties to
late-night hallway philosophy

discussions.
Created by film makers Dayna
Goldfine and Dan Geller, two
Stanford graduates, the 97-
minute film debuts Sunday, Oct.
10 in San Francisco at the Roxie
Theater.
The goal of "Frosh" was to
"capture that journey from leav
ing home for the first time and
being put in an atmosphere with
many new perspectives," Goldfine
said.
"We were looking at what it's
like to be ripped loose from your
friends, family and high school
and being put into a highly
pressured community," Geller
said.
And though some students

might be intimidated by the
prospect of having their freshman
year filmed, the Trancos residents
of three years ago adjusted quickly
to life with the camera.

over the table recording his entire

and that's it,"he said.
Selling at $195 per copy,
"Frosh" will be shown at universi
ties nationwide and has already
been used in several orientation
programs. The film is not being
shown at Stanford while the fea
tured students still remain on

campus because of an "unwritten
rule" of privacy the producers say
they have with the students.
Goldfine and Geller came up
with idea of "Frosh" in 1989,
based on experiences Goldfine had
when she was a resident assistant
for two years in Trancos.
After the University approved
the project, the husband-and-wife
film-making team covered the
$75,000 film cost with a grant
from the Gerbode Foundation,
their own part-time jobs and dona
tions from all of Goldfine's fresh
man dormmates, Goldfine said.
The summer before the 80 stu
dents entered Trancos, each was
told about the film and allowed to
change dorms if they were uncom
fortable with the idea. But no stu
dents complained.
In the fall of 1990, Goldfine

and Geller moved out of their
apartment in San Francisco and
into a Wilbur Hall guest room.
"At the very beginning, every
one was awkward because we
were all plopping into a communi
ty just as it was starting," Geller
said. "I was just as nervous as
anyone else, but that subsided
very quickly."
After Goldfine and Geller
began filming, they realizied they
needed to cover a small number of
students, so they turned to those
who were more open and willing
to talk.
The 10 featured students are
Chris Fruhaus, Nick Haas, Deb
bie Kahn, Monique Reece, Sam
Scuilli, Cheng Song, Brandi
Shipp, Shayne Spalten, Scott
Walker and Lara.
All of the residents came to
regard Goldfine and Geller as
friends and dormmates rather
than intruders or adult figures.
Goldfine and Geller were per
mitted to film anything they

wanted unless the students
objected. "All the students had to
do was tell us to turn off the cam
era," Goldfine said.
This only happened twice â€”
with a male student who objected
to being followed on a date, and
then with a woman who had an
eating disorder, Goldfme said.
Scuilli said he didn't think
"that having the camera there
made that much of a difference in
my freshman experience." But
others didn't want their whole
personality exposed.
"I was reluctant for them to
capture me having fun on film
bemuse of my parents," Song said.
"I wish I didn't try to disguise that
part of my freshman year."
"Frosh" documents freshmen
handling religious, political, eth
nic and cultural issues in a new
atmosphere.
Goldfine and Geller even
stayed with each student for a
short period of time over winter
break and in some situations visit-

Ed the students' high schools.
"It was quite an ego trip to go
back to high school with a camera
crew," Song said.
Looking back on the film three
years later, the students all say
they see large differences in their
personalities and views. Lara,
criticized in the film for his
posters of bikini-clad women, still
hangs pictures of Cindy Crawford
on his wall, but he has also devel
oped a taste for art.
The film makers said they have
continued their relationships with
the students by inviting them
back for Thanksgiving dinners.
Scuilli said having his fresh
man year recorded helps preserve
otherwise long-forgotten memo
ries. "When things happen, you
don't have the benefit of seeing it
again," he added. "With this, it's
frozen on video."
Having his classmates watch
the film with him would be "like
everyone seeing a bad high school
yearbook picture," Song said.
