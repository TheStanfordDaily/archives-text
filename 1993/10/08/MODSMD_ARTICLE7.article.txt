# Multicultural office director hopes to effect smooth transition
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
As the interim director of the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, what Judith Little wants
most is to hold down the fort while
it undergoes remodeling.
"I see my role as a diplomat,"
Little said in an interview earlier
this week.
Last spring, Little came from a
10-year stint with the Office of
Development to take the helm of an
agency in transition, and now she is
charged with steering the office
back toward its original course. She
said that as the office redirects its
attention toward faculty and staff
diversity, its role in student multi
cultural affairs will become more
peripheral, as it was in the past.
The office's transition is the
result of a report issued by the Ad
Hoc Advisory Committee on the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, which was convened by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
after former director Sharon Park
er resigned in April.
According to the report, under
Parker there was "a de-emphasis
of the mandated (affirmative
action) reporting functions for
which the office has always been

responsible," because she broad
ened the office's scope to include
student multicultural affairs.
The original function of the
office — called the Affirmative
Action Office before Parker took
over in January 1990 — was the
hiring and firing of faculty and
staff, the reporting of compliance
with federal affirmative action
laws, and coordination of multicul
turalism efforts with the multicul
tural educator.
As the office extended its
purview toward students under
Parker, some felt the original
duties of the office were neglected,
according to Little.
"When I came in, there were
breaches to mend ... in the rela
tionships this office had with other
offices," Little said. "Specifically,
the relationship between this
office and the president's office
was not good.
Along with the ongoing process
of re-establishing office relations,
Little's priorities for the short
term are to re-institute and main
tain some of the original functions
of the office, including gathering
data and reporting University
compliance with affirmative action
laws to the federal government,
analyzing disabled access, and eas

mg the path for the re-instituted
affirmative action counsel.
While she currently has her
hands full with these mandates,
she's not ruling out the possibility
of creating ones of her own.
"I'm thinking seriously about
lapplying for the permanent posi
tion]," Little added.
As the current office diplomat,
Little believes good and appropri
ate communication to be
paramount.
"One function of the office is to
ensure that communication flows
freely, honestly, and discreetly, and
it's important to create an atmo
sphere of tolerance for views that
may be non-normative," Little said.
She also believes that it is time
for the University as a whole to
reassess the progress it has made
on achieving the multicultural
goals as stated in the original Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues report.
"I think there should be a revis
iting of the UCMI report of '89 and
the subsequent recommendations
it made — there were some 108 of
them originally," Little said. "It's
been five years, five very active
years, and I think it's time to
examine things again and see how
far we've come on those recom

mendations."
According to Little, the complex
developments of recent campus
race relations served to pressurize
the environment surrounding the
office — developments such as the
Rodney King trial, the Los Angeles
riots, ethnic theme studies contro
versies and "self-segregation."
She also blamed the UCMI
report's vagueness for some of the
multiculturalism office's troubles.
She said that the change of the

office's duties — and name — back
to the Affirmative Action Office
will not directly diminish Univer
sity support of multiculturalism.
"The shift that Sharon made
was partly because of the void that
was created between the time that
Greg Ricks (former multicultural
educator) left and Tommy Lee
Woon (recently appointed multi
cultural educator) came in," Little
said. "As a result, a lot of the func
tions of that office fell to her."
But Little acknowledged that
Parker's shift in the focus of the
office actually began a year before
Ricks left.
Was the University displeased
with Parker's broader activism?
"I don't want to disabuse you of
that notion," Little said carefully.
"But we just needed to get the
office back on track."
Despite Parker's troubles, Lit
tle acknowledged Parker's value in
the ongoing multiculturalism
debate.
"Sharon did a lot of good things
as far as developing relations with
students," Little said.
Little denies any significance in
the relabeling of the office from
"multiculturalism" to "affirmative
action."
"I've spent time thinking about

it. None of it makes any differ
ence," Little said. "And affirma
tive action is the legalistic, oldest
term for this. You have to name
things appropriately.
"It doesn't take long in this
environment for a term to get
muddied and saddled with bag
gage," Little continued with a
sense of resignation. "In 30 years,
multiculturalism will get just as
steeped as affirmative action."
An ad hoc committee has begun
to search for a permanent director.
In addition, Provost Condoleezza
Rice will appoint a vice provost for
faculty affirmative action and
there will also be an affirmative
action counsel for consultation on
legal affairs.
But considering how long it
took to hire Tommy Lee Woon as
director of multicultural educa
tion, Little may well stay put for a
year, at the least.
Little believes the University
now needs an approachable director
with broad institutional knowledge.
"|The University! doesn't want
someone abrasive and unfamiliar
with the University," she said.
"And they want somebody who
will speak their mind.
"At least, I hope they do," Little
added with a laugh.

"When I came in, there were
breaches to mend ... in the rela
tionships this office had with other
offices," Little said. "Specifically,
the relationship between this
office and the president's office
was not good.
Along with the ongoing process
of re-establishing office relations,
Little's priorities for the short
term are to re-institute and main
tain some of the original functions
of the office, including gathering
data and reporting University
compliance with affirmative action
laws to the federal government,
analyzing disabled access, and eas

mg the path for the re-instituted
affirmative action counsel.
While she currently has her
hands full with these mandates,
she's not ruling out the possibility
of creating ones of her own.
"I'm thinking seriously about
lapplying for the permanent posi
tion]," Little added.
As the current office diplomat,
Little believes good and appropri
ate communication to be
paramount.
"One function of the office is to
ensure that communication flows
freely, honestly, and discreetly, and
it's important to create an atmo
sphere of tolerance for views that
may be non-normative," Little said.
She also believes that it is time
for the University as a whole to
reassess the progress it has made
on achieving the multicultural
goals as stated in the original Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues report.
"I think there should be a revis
iting of the UCMI report of '89 and
the subsequent recommendations
it made — there were some 108 of
them originally," Little said. "It's
been five years, five very active
years, and I think it's time to
examine things again and see how
far we've come on those recom

mendations."
According to Little, the complex
developments of recent campus
race relations served to pressurize
the environment surrounding the
office — developments such as the
Rodney King trial, the Los Angeles
riots, ethnic theme studies contro
versies and "self-segregation."
She also blamed the UCMI
report's vagueness for some of the
multiculturalism office's troubles.
She said that the change of the

office's duties — and name — back
to the Affirmative Action Office
will not directly diminish Univer
sity support of multiculturalism.
"The shift that Sharon made
was partly because of the void that
was created between the time that
Greg Ricks (former multicultural
educator) left and Tommy Lee
Woon (recently appointed multi
cultural educator) came in," Little
said. "As a result, a lot of the func
tions of that office fell to her."
But Little acknowledged that
Parker's shift in the focus of the
office actually began a year before
Ricks left.
Was the University displeased
with Parker's broader activism?
"I don't want to disabuse you of
that notion," Little said carefully.
"But we just needed to get the
office back on track."
Despite Parker's troubles, Lit
tle acknowledged Parker's value in
the ongoing multiculturalism
debate.
"Sharon did a lot of good things
as far as developing relations with
students," Little said.
Little denies any significance in
the relabeling of the office from
"multiculturalism" to "affirmative
action."
"I've spent time thinking about

it. None of it makes any differ
ence," Little said. "And affirma
tive action is the legalistic, oldest
term for this. You have to name
things appropriately.
"It doesn't take long in this
environment for a term to get
muddied and saddled with bag
gage," Little continued with a
sense of resignation. "In 30 years,
multiculturalism will get just as
steeped as affirmative action."
An ad hoc committee has begun
to search for a permanent director.
In addition, Provost Condoleezza
Rice will appoint a vice provost for
faculty affirmative action and
there will also be an affirmative
action counsel for consultation on
legal affairs.
But considering how long it
took to hire Tommy Lee Woon as
director of multicultural educa
tion, Little may well stay put for a
year, at the least.
Little believes the University
now needs an approachable director
with broad institutional knowledge.
"|The University! doesn't want
someone abrasive and unfamiliar
with the University," she said.
"And they want somebody who
will speak their mind.
"At least, I hope they do," Little
added with a laugh.


Judith Little
As the interim director of the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, what Judith Little wants
most is to hold down the fort while
it undergoes remodeling.
"I see my role as a diplomat,"
Little said in an interview earlier
this week.
Last spring, Little came from a
10-year stint with the Office of
Development to take the helm of an
agency in transition, and now she is
charged with steering the office
back toward its original course. She
said that as the office redirects its
attention toward faculty and staff
diversity, its role in student multi
cultural affairs will become more
peripheral, as it was in the past.
The office's transition is the
result of a report issued by the Ad
Hoc Advisory Committee on the
Office for Multicultural Develop
ment, which was convened by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
after former director Sharon Park
er resigned in April.
According to the report, under
Parker there was "a de-emphasis
of the mandated (affirmative
action) reporting functions for
which the office has always been

responsible," because she broad
ened the office's scope to include
student multicultural affairs.
The original function of the
office — called the Affirmative
Action Office before Parker took
over in January 1990 — was the
hiring and firing of faculty and
staff, the reporting of compliance
with federal affirmative action
laws, and coordination of multicul
turalism efforts with the multicul
tural educator.
As the office extended its
purview toward students under
Parker, some felt the original
duties of the office were neglected,
according to Little.
"When I came in, there were
breaches to mend ... in the rela
tionships this office had with other
offices," Little said. "Specifically,
