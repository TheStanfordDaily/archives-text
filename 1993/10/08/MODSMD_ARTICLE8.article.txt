## 5,300 more troops to Somalia Clinton promises to pull out Americans by March 31 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton ordered 5,300 more troops,
heavy armor and naval firepower to
Somalia yesterday to "finish the work
we set out to do." But, facing growing
demands for immediate withdrawal, he
pledged to pull out all Americans by
March 31.
"We started this mission for the
right reasons and we are going to finish
it in the right way," Clinton said in a
nationally televised address from the
Oval Office. "If we stay a short while
longer and do the right thing, we have a
reasonable chance of cooling the
embers."
Under intense pressure from
Congress and the watchful eye of an
anxious public, Clinton said the U.S.
force had to be expanded to protect
troops already there and to make sure
humanitarian missions continued.
The president was looking to quell a
chorus of protest in Congress, and won
an immediate pledge of bipartisan sup

port from Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole.
"I would urge my colleagues that this
is not a time to pick a partisan fight over
Somalia," Dole said. "On this particular
issue I believe the president has earned
the day and deserves our support and I
believe he will have broad support
across the aisles."
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., one of
the most outspoken critics of Clinton's
policy, praised the president's decision
to set a withdrawal deadline but said it
could be done sooner. He also said he
was disturbed by the deployment of
"such a large number of additional
American forces."
The new deployment includes 1,700
soldiers being sent directly to Somalia
and 3,600 Marines stationed on ships
offshore as a quick response force if
needed. There will be 104 more tanks
and other armored vehicles, and
Defense Secretary Les Aspin said air
strikes could be launched from the car

rier USS Abraham Lincoln.
All told, that would mean a combat
force of more than 10,000. Adding
sailors on the carrier and two amphibi
ous ships would bring the total over
20,000.
The president painted a dire picture
of the consequences of an immediate
withdrawal:
"Within months, Somali children
again would be dying in the streets. Our
own credibility with friends and allies
would be severely damaged. Our leader
ship in world affairs would be under
mined. And all around the world,
aggressors, thugs and terrorists will
conclude that the best way to get us to
change our policies is to kill our people.
It would be open season on Americans."
Aspin said he hoped Clinton's deci
sion would lead other nations to beef up
their forces in Somalia. "We believe the
allies will also show more activity,"
Aspin said at a White House briefing
after Clinton's speech.
