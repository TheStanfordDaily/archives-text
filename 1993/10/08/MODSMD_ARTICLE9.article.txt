Yeltsin suspends high court
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris
Yeltsin suspended Russia's highest court
yesterday in a continuing clampdown on
opposition strongholds. But, on a nation
al day of mourning for the scores who died
in this week's violence, he also appealed
for healing.
The government persisted with efforts
to round up and charge leaders of the
hard-line revolt crushed by tanks in the
streets of Moscow on Monday. There were
no reports of new violence.
Yeltsin said the Constitutional Court
had played "a negative and collabora
tionist role" in this week's crisis. Earlier,
he said the court bore some blame for the
bloodshed Sunday and Monday because it
became involved in politics and backed
parliament against him.
The Constitutional Court is a panel of
13 judges charged with ruling on consti
tutional issues. It voted 9-4 against
Yeltsin's Sept. 21 decree dissolving the
hard-line parliament that had stymied his
reforms.

The court's chairman, Valery Zorkin,
frequently sided with parliament leaders
against Yeltsin in the 18-month power
struggle that paralyzed the Russian gov
ernment.
Yeltsin said the Constitutional Court
would be reconvened only after the legis
lators adopt a new, post-Soviet constitu
tion.
Morrison wins Nobel Prize
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - Novelist
Tom Morrison, the first black American to win
the Nobel Prize in literature, said yesterday
that her lyrical works such as "Beloved" and
"Jazz" were inspired by "huge silences in liter
ature."
"Winning as an American is very special —
but winning as a black American is a knock
out," Morrison, 62, said from Princeton Uni
versity, where she has taught since 1989.
In awarding the 1993 prize yesterday, the
Swedish Academy called Morrison "a literaiy
artist of the first rank" whose work is "unusu
ally finely wrought and cohesive, yet at the
same time rich in variation."
